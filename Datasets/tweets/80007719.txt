@pitpatj @KamalaHarris Who forgets them?
@pitpatj @KamalaHarris "Love says I sacrifice myself for the good of the other person. Abortion says I sacrifice the other person for the good of myself..."
@pitpatj @KamalaHarris We are here. And care very much for  peoples lives. We just start caring about their lives before a pro choice person does.

@GeorgeMorrisWV @benshapiro Where people get this wrong is the equate social services and programs to socialism. What socialism is the government taking a free market product and making it government run and forcing it on everyone.
@maggieNYT It is called a joke.

@oregonfan010 @JessiB4u @lisamurkowski Simply because the people on death row have committed a terrible crime and unlike like any time in history they are getting the luxury of an appellate process. However they took a life which makes them unsafe to be in society and undeserving of living off of the state.
I love to be blocked because at that point you can give no logical retort to the debate at hand and run away.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono You have no idea the time and effort I spend with children on a day to day basis. Nice assumption though. Your comments show more about you and how little you think about life.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Why not be for educating the children that grow up to be the adults that they are responsible for their actions? I expect both of the parents to be responsible parents and not blame the system for their actions to create a child.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono This is called a belittlement argument since you can not put a logical argument forth to support your side. There is no force to it they are not forced to have sex they are not forced to stay home when there are pills available in case of mistakes.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Exactly what freedom to her reproductive Rights are being removed. Every woman has the choice from the very beginning whether she wants to have a child or not. The "unwanted" child is the result of her choice to preform the physical acts necessary to reproduce.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Taxation is again another subject entirely and is once again a deflection to the topic at hand.  I prefer to assist in my community as you should in yours not have my earned money distributed to pay for those that live in higher cost areas by choice or to pay to end a life.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Not even close. That is a ad hominem argument I will not be drawn into.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono There is nothing religious to the statement that it is a child. The end result of procreation (undisturbed) is always a child to love. Any other delineation or description is out of pure selfishness of those that have to call it not what it is to feel better about their actions
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono You are seriously said the most degrading things about a woman I have ever heard. Not once have I referred to the process of birth on such a uncaring cold manner. If you are a mother and this is how you feel you were to your child is messed up.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Being a Christian father has more to do with my beliefs on this subject then the current president. I do not want any child to suffer that is why I am also for adoption reform.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono She has all the rights she did before that are medically necessary. But no I do not agree that her child should die because she is irresponsible whether inside the womb or outside.
@ObservatoireUS @cmillslarson @maggieNYT The only deterrent being implimented is jail time for the adults. The children being removed are a result of the the deterrent not working.
@ObservatoireUS @cmillslarson @maggieNYT That is an opinion not a fact. However I as a parent would not preform anything illegal and risk my children to be removed from my person. The only people effected by this are those that have actively preformed an illegal act. Those that went through the asylum process did not.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono You should also educate yourself on adoptions because baby's from birth do not stay in the system. The ones that live through the foster system have some other event that put them into the system well after birth.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Incubators by definition only warms a fertilized egg. A women gives the very nutrients from her body to the fetus and help it develop. Protects the child with her own immune system. Shares her breath and blood with the fetus and removes all the things that it doesn't need.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono That is terrible and should not happen. However this has nothing to do with the subject at hand.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Let me try this logic with you. If a driver is being irresponsible and making poor choices(DUI) while driving is it the government's responsibility to say it is ok they killed their child because it was inconvenience to them to call an Uber or not make the original poor choice
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono We are not regulating women's bedrooms(or Dr visits) infact the goal is to get the government out of your bedroom (or Dr Office) and make you (the person having sex) responsible for your own actions and not choose to kill a child because you are not being responsible.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono More what about isms.  In this case from other countries even. These type arguments are to set an emotional plea over listening to the self responsibility for the largest group over abortions (and your argument also) of convenients of the mother.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono She does have 100% control over her body whether to have sex or not whether to take the steps necessary to keep her self from being pregnant. She has 100% control over if there are mistakes to contact a pharmacy and buy her own "day after pill". 100% of her choices are hers.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono #HowDareYou imply that a woman does not have the right to her body and her actions pre conception. #HowDareYou imply that a child the is born is ever unwanted and just merely unplanned.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono The is where you and I have a foundational difference in opinion. There is never ever a time that a child is anything but a blessing to the world. Don't like the adoption policies then lobby just as hard to change them as you do to kill a child.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono #HowDareYou  belittle a woman's involvement in creating life? #HowDareYou  belittle a woman's ability to make critical choices to control her self and her body before getting pregnant. #HowDareYou  say that the woman is the only one responsible for making the choice toprotecther
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Did I say anywhere in my statements that a woman is a incubator? No. A woman that is an expectant mother regardless if she chooses to raise the child or not is a blessing to the world.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono Cost is a huge issue to access healthcare and could be addressed with vouchers to pharmacist instead of giving multimillions to a single organization.
@DeborahDitkows1 @maziehirono This is what is called a deflection argument. In slang a "what aboutisms" . Do you have anything to say about the actual subject at hand or do I need to officially switch arguments of debate because I really hate switching subject back and forth?
@BernieSanders ...Don't benefit from.  Fees and licensing to use the services our taxes pay for already. Pentalties if we do not comply with laws that benefit only the government who creates it.
@BernieSanders .. again. It might do some one somewhere some good but like the weather or government really has no control on where that going to land.  Much of it wasted in nothingness. Some of it fills political pools  How much is enough? How much time do we have to work to pay for that we..
@BernieSanders Federal income taxes.  The best description I can say is this: if this money was water it is like heating it and sending the steam into the air. Technically some of it could turn to rain and water your crops in your community but in all likelihood you will never see that water ..
@BernieSanders State Lotteries all of which were sold to the states that have them under the guise of helping education systems but in most areas is redirected somewhere else or absorbed by higher education and never makes it to the public school systems....
@BernieSanders Let's examine all of the taxes and other items that ate taken to pay for schools. Property tax ( adjusted by those who have self interest ). Sales tax (this tax is the only one that goes to your community directly). State income taxes( yes I know some states dont) ....
@cmillslarson @ObservatoireUS @maggieNYT So for those reading this to understand is it has been happening before Trump. Still needs to be addressed but it has been going on for a while.
@maziehirono #HowDareYou use the emotional state in which the some women that legitimately need medical intervention to save her life (and the baby's life if possible)(which has always been legal) to push an agenda item that allows abortion mearly out of inconvenience to mother's life.
@PattyMurray As nice as this is this is not what you are paid to do. This is outside the governments Constitution measures.  You can not make people wholly dependant on the government service no matter how well meaning you make it sound.
@maziehirono #howdareyou tell women their only choice is after sex on how to handle  their bodies!
@maziehirono How does it harm girls or women to be told and shown they are worth more then their body or any man's sexual needs?
@maziehirono How does it harm a woman to be put in control and backed on equal ground when pressured to have sex? How does it harm women (or men) to be held to a higher standard of morality?
@maziehirono How does it harm women to think and make a better choice with whom she consents to had sex with and whether either party is prepared for the possibility of having a child ?
@maziehirono Exactly how does it harm a woman to require her to have medical discussions with a doctor in a doctors office verses a medical tech in a mini-mall? How does it harm a woman to require her to either take responsibility for her actions or take quicker action with a pregnancyblocker
@Nate22070299 @MkUltraOps_M98 @BernieSanders ... the only fair tax is flat tax and no other property or sales tax.
@Nate22070299 @MkUltraOps_M98 @BernieSanders Everyone pays taxes. A lot of these people pay more in property taxes in one year  then the average person pays in income taxes for years. They use money to pay accountants to find all the loopholes that are available to all citizens...
@JiveAssTrump @realDonaldTrump So you make yourself feel better and important by transposing Trump tweets into a "jive".  Do you also give yourself "gold star" stickers because the act is the same.
@Nate22070299 @MkUltraOps_M98 @BernieSanders So peoples children (whom by the way all of work to give a better life) are not allowed to benefit from their hard work? And that do nothing to maintain the wealth? We know by the example of lottery winners what happens to unearned wealth.
@AmsRin @GOP @LaraLeaTrump The original version of that meme has Israel as the blade. I see that it is blacked out here but the intent stands because that's what the artist drew.
@AmsRin @GOP @LaraLeaTrump Nice anti-Semitic meme - it makes a statement with no facts, no validity and no logical argument to debate over. When you grow up and choose to have a debate over USA foreign policy and procedures.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump I would love to sit and discuss all the social groups that are causing the issues but I have to get to producing for my family today.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump and some of them that are on "assistance" are regulated and paid not to produce -- this should not be either.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump It is really hard for those living in small towns and who live outside of metropolises to ask or accept help.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump Medicare / Medicaid is a farce applied to the people. Did you know they are allowed to take any or all of death benefits or insurance or the sale of your property by your children after you are dead to help fund the program?
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump I will agree that everything that is pushed from representatives whose constituents are used to living off of the services provided for them in the city environments all tend to be some shade of socialism.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump I will agree we are largely on a fast track on being socialist. I don't think we are there yet. We have social services but at large we still depend on a capitalist market to pay for them.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump That is what our representatives are for. We discuss them and the states discuss them and we adjust from there. Either way it should be a flat tax on either income or sales not both paid locally.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump the civil service that was to be preformed by businessmen(or women) to help come to agreements and represent their districts and then the states represent the interest of the states as turning into self serving career bureaucrats and find ways to line their pockets.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump No paying for roads. Paying for the right to use civil services. Paying our part for having someone else defend us is our responsibility and it is what the federal government was established for.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump No the federal government should not be enforcing through non constitutional departments rules and regulations. If it needs to be a law for citizens to abide then it needs to go though congress. We have so many regulations that are imposed without our representation.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump … should be paid at our local city halls and benefit our communities first before going to the levels above us.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump … those that produce to give up their results of their production to those that do not or can not produce. Do I believe in taking care of those that can not produce? Absolutely! At the community level not the government level. I also believe that the taxes we do pay …
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump To be clear there are some aspects that we should share equally in the funding. Local , state , and national security are among those. These should be a flat tax for all and no forms or loopholes should get you out of those. (Insert any prefix here) Socialism requires ….
@Juneboarder @KamalaHarris What really makes you think the wall is medieval? Do you not believe that the technologies we have in place could erect a wall that is inclusive of the knowledge we have gained in engineering over the last 500 years since medieval times. Or could be the base for other tech?
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump Produce and the product of the that spread across to cover those that do not produce. While the bureaucrats that manage the process benefit directly from your production. Just like a plantation slave owner would.
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump Live on land we purchased at the value that a local bureaucrat that is guided by self fulfilling interests. We are taxed when we die and our children are taxed when the receive the benefits from our production and our passing. Socialism in any form requires the masses to ....
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump Any work that you are forced to perform  and do not get to keep the profits of your production at the threat of forced imprisonment or retribution is by definition slavery. We are taxed at when we produce income and we are taxed when we spend our money. We are taxed annually to..
@leanattorney @GOP @LaraLeaTrump You realize that democratic socialism is the same as electing your slave master. Socialism in every form is slavery under the guise of taxes.

@Juneboarder @KamalaHarris There is no current technology that will span vast space that will proactively keep people from crossing a designated border. Oh wait a wall would do that. Every thing else is reactive and can do nothing but document.
@Juneboarder @KamalaHarris Actually I miss quoted sorry. It is not 600k per day it is 600million per day for all the services attributed to illegal immigrants. The wall will stop people walking over the border like it or not there are huge swaths of border that barely have a fence if anything at all.
@Shitty_car_mods Crying on the inside. This is sad!
@yancypart2 @MattsIdeaShop @RobProvince Are you just sarcastic or do you need to spend some time in the ward? There is no form of socialism that can work. It all requires a form of slavery.

@imanamenotanum1 @MarkMazzettiNYT Russia is the Enemy and are treated as such. But organized media misinformation is also the enemy.

@TheDemocrats 605million per day in fees to manage illegal immigrants.  Nope nothing to see here.
@BernieSanders Seriously not divide the country. Your entire platform is built on economic class divisions!!!
@BernieSanders Because people like free stuff as and don't think of the consequences of how they get free stuff or who has to pay for it as long as it is not them.
@DavidnMuncie @realDailyWire @benshapiro With the train wreck over there he could very well be.

@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Done with you two and you liking each other's assinine posts. Have a nice life. Trump is not god. Trump is a man and has his faults just like you do. Just like the rest of the world.  Your holier then thou crap is more lies to yourself or others.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro It doesn't it just the facts of the story.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro So yes I have the opinion that being unwantly groped in an adult situation is absolutely not equal to rape!!!
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Or the girl that used to live near me that her dad used to rape her and her sisters for hours while he mother watched if it is the same.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Or back to my mother who was sold as a child in the back of a broken down school bus to men including another man that cut her genitals with a packet knife so he can fit if it's the same.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Or ask my wife who was chased down and tagged teamed raped on the side of the road by two black men whether it is the same!!
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro If you could ask my mother who when she was a child was forced to give BJ to the neighbor while he sat on the toilet whether she thought some girl who just got her pussy grabbed by a man comming on to her was the same.  She wouldtell the chick to man up kick him in the nutsandgo!
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No I haven't done anything like it or even close. Again you are using direct insults and ad hominem. Rape, forced sodmy and the like is sexual assult.  Unwanted groping and most is just a moment of uncomfortable and at max is grounds to be fired or knee'd in the nuts and move on
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No I know what is see and I know where my values lay. I am very critical when it comes to people trying to equate being in an uncomfortable position or worse lead a person on then have guilt about it on the same level as actually rape!
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Grabbing pussy != Rape  and as a person that has had friends and family that were rape survivors it is very belittling to what they went through!!!!
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Sexual assault(rape) and unwanted groping(someone being bold) in an imtimate environment(in the same room with obvious expectations) are not the same.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No not illegal unfortunately. Not really happy about it but he is with his legal rights to do.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Let me clarify. Walking up to a stranger and groping her is absolutely wrong but it is not in anyway on the level that rape is. And I hate that people equate the two.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro So you have never ever used any situation to ever benefit you or your kids in a financial way in a completely legal way. Kudos to you but I call BS.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro That is not sexual assault and don't belittle those that have been raped  by comparing someone who has been groped to sexual assault. It is not even close.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro By the way calling him a dictator or autocrat is literally gaslighting him. So throw some more stones there your glass house is broken anyways.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Again your opinion and he is still better off then you so he is doing something right.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro So you can stop the holier then thou BS because if you are man then you have said about a woman and if you are a woman you have said about a man unless you have been saved your entire life. If so well congrats you are in the minority.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro And I will be honest when it has been me and my best friend talking in my pre-saved days we said a whole heck of a lot worse.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Most of them it was just lying.  No not all because yes bad people surround powerful people. Untill they find something that Trump actually done the rest is just fodder.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro BS again if you owned property and could get away with it legally you would. Don't try and lie and talk about how you wouldn't. He is respecting the rule of law but yes I agree it is a law that needs to be looked into.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro BS you know darn well in private settings like he was in. Everyone has said things to some extent that would be vulgar and could be offencive to someone else.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Admin /campaign convictions are largely based on lies and them not being wholly honest not any really wrong doing.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Trump golf trips. - this one I do have a problem with. Even though he is not directly benfiting legally yeah that is walking the line. But tell me if you were in his position you wouldn't. You can't because it is again human.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Bankruptcies when purchasing business are just apart of business. Grab them by the pussy if you were honest you know damn well you have said worse.  Throw stones. Cheating/mistresses again human and although not great but he is not god he is human....
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Anyways you two can have your opinions but do yourselves a intellectual favor. Stop the assignment of opinionated terms that have zero base in fact. Really you are belittling the strife of the people in the world that really deal with dictators or autocrats.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro The things I disagree with are his golf trips and the way he treats people that leave his service. Policy wise there are several things that are blamed on him that are really controlled by the ever growing amount of paperwork bureaucrats in middle management.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No because again those are your opinions they are not facts. You base them of what you are getting off of opinion blogs and probably people like that awful Bea comedian. CNN loves to manipulate reports and for sure manipulates polls.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I can and I will later. Have a good day. And take an pill for the TDS.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I would be happy to argue the finer points of the legal asylum process later. I must go for now to get back to my work.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Then when it comes time use your opinion and vote as will I but calling him a dictator or an autocrat is wrong just an inflated dramatized verbal fodder that honestly is no better then the things you accuse him of.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Yes I used a strawman there to emphasize that the things that the left wants to concentrate on is ridiculous. When we have caravans of people organizing to gain entry via our asylum process is an emergency.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Well in my opinion he was and is a better choice then Hillary or Bernie. I did not vote for him in the primary but he is the president and has way more information available to him then you or even the media does.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No your opinion is that it is not a national emergency. However 600k per day in funds that it takes to manage illegal immigrants is more of a emergency then regulations forced on business to regulate stuff like cow gas.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro If he was a pool business man he would have squandered the original 1 or 14 million. Just because you are given money doesn't mean you make money. Ask most of the lottery winners
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I could really care less if you agree with him and choose to disrespect him that is your right. But call it what it is an opinion.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Then call him that and quit calling him a dictator or an autocrat. It is false message only based on opinion not any facts or actions.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro He is not a ruler that has absolute power or insists on obedience. He is a angry billionaire business man that pushes the people around him to get the job done. So quit using the word that does not apply.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Right because that would be actual dictatorship behavior. And we the people would remove him with force if necessary.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I have seen it more in the last three days in the media and tweets that i have seen it in the last two years. So my opinion is that it has become a buzz word.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I read I don't watch news. I read articles from all news agents and see through what is opinion over fact. I don't agree with everything Trump says or does but like this original thread claimed of him being a dictator he is not. He does not have the media shot or people shot.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Considering they have not been used in the media consistently untill the last three days yes they are
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro And it is your opinion that they are not. Free country he is entitled to his opinion as you are yours.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I get it you guys think he is what ever. I do not hold that opinion because if he was a dictator people like me would have him out of the office faster then they can make his omlet
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro You are correct both things COULD be true and you are allowed to have an opinion that he is a fascist autocrats (new buzz word used by the AP) is just that an opinion you have not facts to back it up.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Memes are not debate arguments they are opinions in picture form and are largely untrue and non vetted to be true either way.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Are you saying the MSM can't be scrutinized right back or do not have to public retract incorrect statements or are not responsible for passing opinions as facts and not classified as opinions?
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro No I am saying that the organized behavior of the MSM is more related to the Nazis then the application of saying "he hates people of color". There are plenty of other news outlets that do and can scrutinize all people in government not just the president.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro That is what is called a Ad hominem and is poor debate tactic which means you have no logic to base your side of the argument on.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Yes my eyes are open and I have a different opinion and view. I see way more then the hatred of the bad orange man. I see opinions expressed and weak minds taking that as a fact.  I see stupid quotes spread without proof or vetting.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro When they are being used as a tool to influence the nation based. Then yes the MSM is the enemy of the people.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Yes and the use of the organized press to attack a person is a Nazi and dictator tactic. And I do say organized press because the buzzwords are repeated across news outlets.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro I am defending the lefts opinionated over dramatic use of words making them much worse then they really are to try and justify their hated and look past the hypocrisy of their own statements.
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro And you would do the same thing if you were constantly attacked by the media. He is a man that is defending himself. Especially when when the media does retract or correct statements from their opinion pieces they are back page or a 2 minute feed and move on. Again not a dictator
@containseggs @BlkCharlieBrown @ananavarro Nice you have an opinion I am sure someone has one about you. But again how does that make him a dictator? Or in bed with a dictator?
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Want to try again?
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Tax cuts for employers helps communities. I have completely different opinions on taxes as a whole so again not proof of a dictator. Those tax cuts are also approved by the representatives in Congress. So again not a dictator.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro He said people in the original protest as fine people not explicitly the white nationalist that took over it. But again either way it is his opinion not proof of being a dictator.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro It had nothing to do with the race it had to do with employees of an organization not following the organizations rules set forth.  So what happens when you disobey your employer you get fired not coddled. He expressed his opinion again not proof he is a dictator.
@BlkCharlieBrown @containseggs @ananavarro Nice you goto insults. He does not attack free press he defends himself from organized efforts to discredit him. the wall is not a campaign promises it is needed. Just because you don't agree with his opinion does not make him a dictator!!! Use your words wisely.
@KamalaHarris Non of those are national emergencies. None of those effect the public at large. Gun violence is individual. Everyone has access to healthcare through the ER if they need we do not need a forced slavery program causing health people's rates to increase. CC is not a gv issue.

@Tazman9197 @lsor8 @Here2motivate @Ashhash5 @0xdemosthenes @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion @POTUS The only thing I see is a lot of opinionated blogs with zero facts or half truths. What I know is red States have people that know how to depend on themselves and work and not depend on all the services cities provide.
@AOC @guardian Here is the difference. Capitalism will invest proft in itself to produce a product including innovating ways to make sure there is a product to sell. Socialism can't produce any profit to invest and in turn does not encourage or fund innovation.
@Redjester91 @PCothron @gogaels @GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump No your state is the worst state on paying it's debts to contractors and businesses that fo business with them. It takes going to court almost all the time.
@0xdemosthenes @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion @POTUS Because Cali is the example of having huge amount of money in state. Taxed at huge rates.  Charged and priced at enormous rates. Regulations on everything. Yet they can't maintain a budget.
@RandyBradley @KimStrassel @WSJopinion And their country is not even 1/16th the size of the United States.
@lsor8 @Here2motivate @Ashhash5 @0xdemosthenes @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion @POTUS But I would like to test your theory.  Tell your local representatives you want type secede!
@lsor8 @Here2motivate @Ashhash5 @0xdemosthenes @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion @POTUS Really without California most of the red States would be just fine. We know how to take care of ourselves. Infact Texas would be just fine without any other state.

@AstroMagnasis @ronwikso @AOC I agree with that. Why should we send money to the federal government hoping it will make it down to our communities for schools. Why shouldn't we give out income tax to our local cities first. Biggest TDE is the federal government!!

@SenSchumer Oct 3, 2018 · From 1970 to 1991, the infant homicide rate more than doubled, from 4 to 10 deaths per 100,000 children under age 1. The rate remained fairly stable from 1991 to 2000, but the subsequent trend has been generally downward—standing at 7 deaths per 100,000 in 2016

@prizzotweet @derrickemery @DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke I am so sick of hearing people say we need more tech. Tech is 100% reactive it doesn't do anything to actively keep people out.

@GRIP2013 @TheDemocrats @GOP @POTUS I know there is a point you are trying to make here but the context is wrong.  God is disclosing in Genesis how the world was made perfect and man's own sin created the separation between him and us. Not some sort of works that we have to do to please him.
@ThomasjDowneyjr @TheDemocrats Because that is not what the government is for. The government is to secure our nation not start and maintain business enterprises. Electricity production is a business.
@SenGillibrand Statistically how is it a racial issue when the same statistics are seen when you apply to family units. Father and mother in home statistically a more stable environment. So drop the attitudes that your entitled to something and fix the real problems in the relationships.
@KenHedges @BillKWisdom @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiff However you must be missing his point. Congress people come out of office multimillionaires on a corporate mid management or director pay. It is highly unlikely it is all smart investing that is causing their coffers to fill.

@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump 607 million dollars per day that it costs and that is accounted for that goes to illegal immigrants or the processing , managing , and in some cases caring for.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You realize there are more registered democrats that have committed mass shootings then the alt right.  There have been more religious and anti religious zealots that have shot people then alt right people shooting any where at any time in history.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump It goes to over paid administrators that treat schools as businesses. It goes to all the government people that have to process paperwork and make sure that schools have the right test scores. Teachers pay goes to cover new sports stadiums and equipment.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You know you are right about that one. Sales tax , bond issues, property tax are all supposed to go to local communities first and they are to take care of the schools in their areas. Lottery in some states. YOu know where most of that money goes?
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Again you brought guns into the conversation. Which do you want to talk about illegals and the wall or guns.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Yes highways and bridges need regular maintenance they are used regularly. This walled structure will only need maintenance when damaged by intruders or weather. It will not be a toll road of structures.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump you can not compare consumer products to the technologies used with government scanning and documentation. The requirements alone cause it to be an ever increasing cost.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump your statement is as true as not all fingers are thumbs but thumbs are fingers.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump and people in poverty still make poor decisions.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump 607 million per day sure could be used for something else.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Why would you want to keep self responsibility away from politics. Someone who sees the picture for what it is instead of the emotional manipulation baggage that gets used by our politicians.  Legal guns do more that you never hear about then all the bad things you do.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You are the one trying to relate the two as bad as the mass shootings are there are far more deaths regularly in the hands of gangs, cartels, and thieves  and we have documented proof that they run off of drugs, human trafficking some of such run across the border.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Who is responsible for mass shootings the shooter himself or all the CC carriers that where died because they were not denied the right to carry their legal weapon because someone was afraid of something they don't understand.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump who is responsible for the mass shootings then people that dumped on the person or was not close enough to them to recognize they are having mental health issues.?Or the people who manufactured and sold them the gun.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Tell me who is mostly responsible for school shootings the parent of the bullied kid who happened to own a gun legally or the administration that kept punishing the bullied kid for standing up to the bully. or even the bully's parents who did not teach their child right or wrong
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump That is such a ignorant lie.. you cant account for what you have not caught. we have not let millions of people or even a million people cross the POE unchecked. Yes tech there would do good. So would a tunnel.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You mean that steel and concrete and the expertise to repair the wall when someone damages it will change greatly change from year to year in greater percentage then ever changing digital technologies and the always increasing salaries for that? Doubtful
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump it is the same way people who live pay check to paycheck afford tattoos. Income level has nothing to do with the amount of guns you have.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You stated most of the illegal immigrants are above poverty line. To me that makes it worse that they don't go though the process to get right with the law.
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump There is no gun control problem there is a mental health and accountability problem. Every school shooting goes back to those to issues. Try again
@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Anything that we do is technology.  A wall costs less to maintain then digital technologies that have constant maintained by technical personnel and ran by other technical personnel to tell BO agents where to go but not proactively stop anyone from crossing.

@bobbyboyphoto @billionbubbles @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump And in my opinion their income levels are not relevant if they are illegaly in the country. Thanks below the poverty line in that case get a little leeway because if your not legal and can afford the lawyers and fees you are worse.

@diss_max @Ckot89Cheryl @EllenDegener8 @fancy_spancy_22 @SenSanders What would you call 17,000 people in caravans in the last three years? A  picnic? A social gathering? Mom's chilli cook off? No!

@toorsdenote Enjoy! Believe it or not I like these conversations to get other peoples views. I may not agree but I feel we should all be able to talk about them.
@toorsdenote I personally would like to continue helping underground movement and orphans in these peoples home countries.
@toorsdenote Sweet keep it up! You can choose to use your labor for money that you pay for them. I am not at this point in life. And most of America is struggling for every dollar and working 60-80 hours per week.
@toorsdenote and the no government assumption comes from your Decolonize Everything on your profile.
@toorsdenote So answer my question from earlier. How may can fit in your mansion? I am all for refugees with sponsors!
@toorsdenote I apologize for the CA statement but it seems that only people that live off of cities are the ones just willing to allow all this to happen unchecked. I am for letting people in just limit it control it. borders matter for every country
@toorsdenote You look at zero negatives even in any sort of realistic manner and pretend that is it all rosy and based on your profile you don't believe in any government. Seriously CA needs to join Mexico and leave the rest of us that care about the USA and USA Citizens alone.
@toorsdenote here we go everything in the world is the "USAs fault" and yet everybody wants to come here.  Has nothing to do with greedy people in the countries doing anything at all.
@toorsdenote You betcha! Just like your opinion that all refugees and illegal immigrants are super duper people and never game they system.
@toorsdenote It can.. it always can.. people are the ones that can make it happen.
@toorsdenote Legal immigrants that go through the proper immigration process ALWAYS are. Refuges that come to a POE are one step below them but living for any time in USA illegally is always a drain. Do it right or go home and part of doing it right is accepting that sometimes the answer isno
@toorsdenote You can lessen the burden.
@toorsdenote There is no data in link that it is a statement by a reporter.
@toorsdenote I know it is hard and not what people want but walking away leaves the problem for generations more and that is unacceptable.
@toorsdenote Make Something Be Something and Fight back!  That is the reason the US will never have a dictator because we would take his ass out.
@toorsdenote I know 6 year-olds that where making a living for themselves and their family. Governments of any kind can only be there because their citizens allow it. I know people in hiding because their government wants to kill them but they are fighting to get rid of their dictator!
@toorsdenote Your research is like I said hyper focused. You can make a report that says anything you want when you don't include the entire dataset. So no I do not believe it.  No I do not expect my kids to pay my Medicare Bills. It is not hey I am going to raised you to take care of me.
@toorsdenote Because if they were worth a salt they would be making their countries better. No they run
@toorsdenote It is not outsiders it is people not willing to make their lives better except for living off of other people. So may of them get paid cash and still live on the system.
@toorsdenote Yes is does! especially property taxes do you not pay any of those? For any increase of population in a community the schools and infrastructure must adapt to them. You can say all you want that the refugees and other non citizens pay also but they don't.
@toorsdenote No one said you having a kid is good for the economy. I person is not good for the economy unless they are actively producing. And I already stated that that study is hyper focused on refugees and the problem is larger then that. The system is being abused!
@toorsdenote Listen it may not be all murders and gangsters and rapists but it is not all rainbows and cotton balls either. There is cause and effect and I feel that every amount of tax I pay that is not sales tax is paramount to slave labor.
@toorsdenote A larger population directly effects that! You having a kid having a kid does effect my debt in the form of my income and property taxes. Is it miniscule on that level but when you add it all up it does add up.
@toorsdenote A lot has changed. We are struggling to pay our own people and have several trillion dollars of personal debt to pay for the things we need. We can not take in people who don't work to change their home countries.

@toorsdenote Pilgrims were not refugees there was no established government in the land. Ireland was 1847 and Italy was 1890 both of those OVER a hundred years ago. So not valid today.
@toorsdenote This report only is addressing refugees and the whole situation is non-citizens (refugees and illegal immigrants) and if you cross our border and don't walk right up to a BP or POE then you are illegal period. We have spent 19 Billion this month alone on the immigration/refugees
@toorsdenote I could give a rats butt about their skin tone. I believe in one race the human one. It is all about whether we as a country can continue to absorb other countries problems just because they wont fix them but keep taking aid.
@toorsdenote hey that's great that was then and this is now.
@toorsdenote I have seen in the communities people paid cash for jobs and still getting benefits. yes there are those that are citizens that do it also but the rest are non citizens.
@realDonaldTrump Here is a fix for the crisis with the wall. Create dormitories cities on areas on the border with the wall that people can stay. So instead of shipping them all over the country or having to catch them. As long as they are there they get priority processing.
@toorsdenote There is a fix to this though and I think it is one even people on your side could agree with. If we can get people to give up a little land on the border from both counties. And that is to create true refugee dormitories and "cities" that they can come to request.
@toorsdenote Because it is being abused! People taking advantage of the actual crisis's in Venezuela and Nicaragua going on right now. So you have to stop and say no more until we get a handle on it. Not because people just want to come to the US do they get to.
@toorsdenote No that is the lie that is constantly being told that all these people come over and start working and everything is rainbows.. the truth is because they have not don't it the right way we have to support them until the might possibly get a job. they can work in their homecountry
@toorsdenote It is not a human right - a human right is breathing and the ability to provide for your family. Not forcing another country or person to take care of you while you get your feet under you. GO though the immigration process for that.
@toorsdenote You don't seriously think the UN says anything more then.. hey wee need you to take x amount. We doo all of the vetting from then on out.
@toorsdenote TAXES for food and bored from an already stressed system!
@toorsdenote Which one of those two senerios is acceptable? People who ask and need help? Or the person breaking an entering? A thief is still a thief if he takes from you to better his life.
@toorsdenote And when it is in other countries and not banging on our door it we have more control over who and how.  Example. Your Uncle Joe and Aunt Beverly say they need help and call you. You choose to allow them to live with you. Your cousin Bob jumps your fence and says I am here - deal
@toorsdenote So how many refugees are you taking in to your house? I just read your profile and since you want to abolish ICE and open the borders for anyone and everyone I can only assume you are ok with people living on your dime in your house.
@toorsdenote Yes these caravans are not the same as a planned asylums from countries like you mentioned. We had time to plan and prepare for them and keep them from negatively impacting our countries and we said who could or not come over right from the airports. the caravans are wrong period
@toorsdenote We provided transportation and approved all of them in their home countries. They did not cross a land mass to get to us. Not even remotely the same.
@toorsdenote There have not been these caravans like this that I remember in my life time.
@toorsdenote You can not prove or justify the mass exoduses from the south is persecution or these people are living in fear of anything other then whether they have food or not and that is what humanitarian aid is for. Not for them to come live in the USA and sing happy songs
@toorsdenote Internationally the only way that mass asylum is allowed is environmentally such as a volcano or other then that EVERY case is individually assessed.  I never claimed to be an absolute expert there are nuances none of us in the public know.
@toorsdenote These people are not fleeing persecution they are trying to take advantage of the system and playing on the poor me emotions instead of staying and fixing their countries.
@toorsdenote Done at AG discretion and not don't in large organized caravans across multiple country boundaries forcing their way to the US. It is not anywhere close to the same.
@toorsdenote full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United States.
@toorsdenote no nationality, the country of the alien’s last habitual residence) in which the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and where the alien would have access to a
@toorsdenote (A) Safe third country	Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney General determines that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of the alien’s nationality or, in the case of an alien having
@toorsdenote I don't know who lied to you but there is no provision in the international law that say they can cross the border out side of the POE and that in anyway it is guraenteed
@SheldonBeatty @TPPatriots @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yes because no Christian has ever continued to sin and need to ask for forgiveness after becoming Christian. We humans sin and need forgiveness. I am sure you are absolutely perfect in life.
@sfchronicle Sorry but there are American citizens getting their children ripped from their hands because the state thinks so. It because they committed a crime. If she had not crossed the border illegally then she would not have been separated from her child.
@toorsdenote @SenBlumenthal They can follow the immagration laws.
@toorsdenote @SenBlumenthal Asylum applies to the first border they cross not the country the "want to" go to.  Those from Mexico do not qualify for asylum because their nation is not suffering from economic collapse or environmental events.

@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump The only ones of those I see are you and the krasshole brothers. An Dr e nuff already. So starved for attention you have to be the first ones to tweet back to Trump.

Domain rights keep the lawsuits out especially since most of the land owners along the border support a government funded wall so they don't have to pay.
@Lee_Roges @fourinthefluff @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So you want more annual salaries on payroll plus support staff and equipment over a one time wall. Repairs will never be a annual expense in the millions.
@ThereseMary76 @hardhatdiver06 @Lee_Roges @fourinthefluff That your only answer. Someone disagrees with you and they are a bot. What a weak cop out. I am absolutely not a bot.
@Forestdirt_Hams @rhamannoodles @KeathMayes @BobSampson01 @KamalaHarris Keep working
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump No the first amendment keeps them from establishing a state or government run religion and either giving them rights that is not given to others or forcing you to join it. In this case it is only legally allowing voluntary access to it.
@payolahhh @realDonaldTrump Oh my that is just devistating is your kind like Groot. Is saying the same phrase over and over supposed to mean something? I bet you are the smartest scholar of your kind.  Please please enlighten us more with your knowledge.

@blkshpstudio @realDonaldTrump So that is the second tweet to you that has been deleted. Cant handle the truth?
@blkshpstudio @realDonaldTrump Not sure where my previous message went to thanks twitter.  Separation of Church and State means that they can not force you to be a religion not that a representative cant be a religion or that access to religions can not be in schools. so try again.
@blkshpstudio @realDonaldTrump Does it say "Separation of Church and State".- NO it says that the Government cant force you to be any particular religion not that our representative cant be of any particular religion Nor does it say you can not have religion available to those in schools. Try again.
@RedDragonWing Not a thing. Reread the Constitution and try again.
@PattyAshley03 @funder Not a thing. How about reading the Constitution instead of misquoting it.
@blkshpstudio @realDonaldTrump Actually it is not. I challenge you to find it in the Constitution.
@LauraLuchtman @marcorubio How about you quote the Constitution exactly where that phrase exists? I will help you out. It doesn't exist in the Constitution at all.
@ManMadeMoon @mattdpearce @onlxn That should be done from all politicians.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Find that phrase anywhere in the Constitution.  What it does say is the government will not impose any mandated religion. Any religion as an elective is completely legal.

@BlueRobotDesign @lyncofta @TheDemocrats You do realize that if there was ANY proof that this was true conservatives would be the first to call for his head.
@KamalaHarris Then on top of that get bullies parents involved. If that doesn't work by 3rd time. Long term in school suspension for the bullies.  No free vacation in suspensions.
@KamalaHarris You want to fix school shootings. Stop punishing the bullied as much or more the the bully. Start letting the victims stand up for themselves.  Give them the tools to do so. School shootings are not about guns they are about the mental bullying all the way up to the adults.
@BernieSanders You just end up making more poor people.
@BernieSanders It is not possible to do. Quit lying to yourself and others that it is.  You can not keep taxing the rich or middle class to pay for other people. College should not be as expensive as it is but with the more government loans and other guaranteed payments to them they won'tchange
@EDoggTheRed @maggieNYT Encouraging self responsibility is more kind then saying "oh we are so sorry (faked to make a situation look worse and political gain) we are on your side. " None of these politicians care one iota about the people affected by this.
@maggieNYT Considering the average government worker makes 74k per year (via indeed)  and that is about 20+k more per year that the average person and has the risk of being unemployed at any moment, says to me the gov employees going to food banks do not know how to budget or plan.

@BernieSanders You want a better education system allow communities to control more than just their sales tax. And not have to use global metrics on schools and let them assess the needs of their students and community.
@BernieSanders You want more scrutiny on where tax money is spent then go from the community to the federal and I guarantee you that there would be no wide-scale misappropriation of funds because everybody would be watching and waiting for every dime to come to them.
@BernieSanders You want more effectiveness for taxes make it flat with no loopholes for anyone. Then have them paid at the community level like their local city hall. Then let the money flow up from those communities to the federal government.
@BernieSanders You want a better education system for kids quit putting money on test grades and attendance. Quit putting money on metrics and allow the teachers to teach on the children's level instead of training them to take tests.
@MarkWarner @TheDemocrats Yeah that sad however it is the same out side government also so quit with the poor me stories. There families in your town that have to decide between heat and food.
@ewarren You call it tax. However it sounds more like Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling and exaction) and it is the criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an individual or institution, through coercion or threat of persecution.
@MarALagoComedy @realDonaldTrump I have no racist intents since I believe there is only one race the human race. However illegal entry is still illegal. "they are just bettering their lives". So is a thief at your expense. And Mexico needs to take down these cartels for their country to grow.
@MarALagoComedy @realDonaldTrump Then to take it step farther NO invading force it logistically going to be able to use the tunnels in a mass entrance.  So sick of these stupid what aboutisms
@MarALagoComedy @realDonaldTrump On top of that I have heard that they plan on dripping and extending rebar another 3 feet below the footer. Tunnels also can be found when the BP agents don't have to spend as much time chasing the people that they just watched crawl over the car barrier fence
@MarALagoComedy @realDonaldTrump Try tunneling 7-10 feet down and through rock. Most of the tunnels found are just a little bit under the surface within mostly top soil. Try again.
@WIRED So let's just move the fuel consumption up the chain to the car manufacturer and the electric producers and mine up more land for batteries just to feel better about ourselves while drinking from our plastic water bottles and wearing our plastic shoes.

@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 It is deflection because you explicitly targeted my family and name your comment to throw a person in to defence mode. By the way how many races are their on Earth?
@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 Several are true statements most  are generalized  one is self promotion and confidence. Only one is a "lie" and only because it is splitting hairs and he knows it. And one is opinion.
@despinosa1978 @TheDemocrats They did also put funding to the wall. Not as much as Trump wanted but something.  The trend of caravans leaving failed countries and by passing every other nations that are granting amnesty is what makes it more urgent.
@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 The fact is the left meaning well wants to believe that all those that are crossing the border illegally are people that want a better life. The right see them as law breakers because the disregard our laws to get here. Thief wants to better his life at your expense.
@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 That is called a deflection tatic. Yes my family tree above me has all of those including pedos. And it was stopped in my generation. So being the truth and knowing it can't hurt my family it is just a faft and doesn't bother me.
@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 He wasn't my first choice but everyone that is opposite him has been a complete obstructionist and pealing his words apart trying to make a statement but not for the gain of the country.
@lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 That is their choice to be PC not my issue.

@Applesaucey5 @karenripplinger @lemortebarthur @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 Probably true.
@karenripplinger @lemortebarthur @Applesaucey5 @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 That seems like an over sexualized and aggressively dominate statement. You should probably see a therapist.
@TeamPelosi @TheDemocrats You BOTH are holding the American people in your political equivalent of two school yard spoiled kids. YOU have been in congress for 30 plus years and dealing with immigration for 20+ years and Trump has been in office for 2 years. This IS your fault as much as it is Trumps.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Hey you have a blessed day also! I appreciate that. Except for the cussing it was pleasant to discuss your point of view with my point of view.  It gives all reading somethings to think about on both sides.
@MelissaNymeros @MSMAGC @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi My issue with the studies is they are tainted (In my opinion) by the opinions of those that do the studies.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Agree to disagree
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Then don't demean what they did by addressing them as a police state or a military state which incites fear when they are just citizens securing the location that do not need to be feared.
@MelissaNymeros @MSMAGC @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi So in every opinion that was listed in that article is a gun owner being irresponsible.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi We are in agreement there.  But a government knowing that the citizens could keeps them from doing something that it could do if the citizens where unarmed.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Police are members of the community that are purpose trained to deal with emergency situations and are armed. They are not soldiers that are trained to kill or control situations with lethal force.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi two things - the term itself does not exist. but the closest definition is "A fiscal-military state is a state that bases its economic model on the sustainment of its armed forces, usually in times of prolonged or severe conflict. " - so no
@MelissaNymeros @MSMAGC @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Although the young lady is attractive in the GIF you chose you are missing the point.  Owning a GUN does not mean that you are going to shoot people and those that do mass shootings always pick areas where there is not likely someone with a gun to stop them. More guns = safer
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi And you are using police state improperly. Security at a school is not equal to "a totalitarian state controlled by a political police force that secretly supervises the citizens' activities."
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi In several countries you are encouraged to own a weapon and they have the lowest gun related crime statistics.  Then there are those that do where the police cannot even carry guns and are powerless to stop a situation when someone has a weapon of any size.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Not if the children are taught both in there homes and at school how to behave around a gun instead of the fear of a gun or the fact that they don't see them often makes them curious.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Purchasing a gun with the intent to kill is illegal regardless the state. Open carry keeps people from mass shootings because like I said they are more likely to go where they can to the most damage with as little risk to themselves.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi She should be able to put that anywhere she can safely keep it close to her. You people act like walking into a school is like and arcade. You pass by people all the way through. I also believe that there should be police active on campus for two reasons.  Safety and remove fear
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The mass shooting in schools coincides to the removal of authority in schools and the restricting of the bullied to be able to handle this themselves without getting punished for doing so. It also coincides with the increase of electronic babysitting parents are doing.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Yes yes there are always exceptions but again the likely hood that a person is going to go through the license process to do so and I going to make a life ending choice like that are far fewer then the day to day stuff. Everyone should have the right to wether they do it or not.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi You are assuming that the timing was relevant. I would be more apt to believe that during that time frame in meetings with his staff that he changed his mind based on their recommendation. Yes since I don't see Trump as evil I am going him the benefit of the doubt.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi They are through tarriffs and trade negotiations that money then goes into the economy where it is spent and taxed nullifying the cost of the wall.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi I am for  anyone at any age over 18 to beable to legally defend themselves with what ever means they feel necessary. That is their  individual rights. If Ms Brown chooses to go to the range and train then so be it.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi It is the same as an unarmed person in a classroom.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Because Ms smith is going to be able to spot and determin the person is a threat well before a military dressed officer on a military base is seen out of the ordinary. And since you are not allowed to carry loaded weapons on base unless you are on patrol or in trainging.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi If you think that Trump did this because of Ann Coulters remark then you have a set of issues that cannot be resolved on Twitter. Congress is the ones putting people out of work for less then 1% of the budget.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Fort hood were both terroristic attacks not some random mentally ill child. And bank robbery are two different subjects. Most people that want to actively die by a gun will actively seek out a police officer
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Had he not then they would have given the money as normal and the BP could have used it for the wall without being a issue.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Every other year though there has not been stipulations on how the border security funds were to be used. This time the Dems are willing to give them my but explicitly saying it can not be fore a barrier or stucture of any kind on because Trump made an issue about the wall.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Congress has given money every year in increments. But yes Congress failed then and are failing now regardless the side of "the wall" you are on. Both sides trying to capitalize politically on the crisis.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi And if an adult would have been allowed to have a gun in the school there would not have been a shooting because mentally ill or not they do not seek out places that are armed. They go where they can make the most impact without immediately being shot themselves.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Increasing would economic issues south of us with Venezuela and the effect that has on surrounding countries. Not official but a civil war in Nicaragua. The list goes on.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Reports of BP seeing but being powerless to stop groups of 80 to 200 people crossing at a time in areas where the border fence is designed to stop cars.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi In the last full year there are now 3 separate caravans that have made it or are in route to our border. What is manufacturered about that?
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The people buying a tank are not going to be the unstable teenagers. The too subjects are not even remotely the same.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Or that the adults to active roles in the children's lives on behavior. Or that teachers were not powerless to punish bullies.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi To take school shootings into context every single one of them would not be if the bullied did not feel powerless to do something because when they fight back with their hands that are punished at time harder the the bully.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi On top of that a lot of these locations would not have the mass casualty rates if there were armed legal citizens in the vicinity
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Oh I really hate this argument with the percentage of weapons that are in the general Publics hands there would be more if it took just owning a gun to want to go shoot up a venue.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The name one piece of technology that can proactively keep people from crossing the border. Every piece of technology out there other than the wall is reactive and requires us to chase people down and does not keep them from crossing in great numbers.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Yes any weapon the military has up to weapons of mass destruction should be able to be licensed and purchased by citizens.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi So with citizens being able to maintain military rifles that a soldier can carry we have a Fighting Chance if we resisted.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi You are correct to an extent if the military used the high powered weaponry on citizens they would be against international law. It is more likely that in the case that the military was use they would prefer to round up citizens and contain them rather than destroy them.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Militias however have been stigmtized to the point where when the you join them you are on a watch list and your movements and freedoms restricted.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Because at this point we have been discussing for 20+ years and Congress has not fixed the issue. So The President is saying give me this so I can actually do something wether it is affective as the general public wants to debate about is no longer of relevance.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Every illegal immigrant that we help even for a short period actively removes that amount we can give to a citizen in their time of need.  Money is finite.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi There is also a department for over stay visa called ICE but sanctuary cities actively block them from doing their jobs.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The government in itself is only as trust worthy as the citizens are informed and able to defend themselves. The amount of representatives don't matter because Parliament was with the king to control the colonies by military force.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi As far as your stance on military style weapons I believe a citizen should be able to be licensed for any weapon that the military soldier can use.  Protection from crime is one thing but keeping a government in check was the main reason for the 2a. Hunting was not.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Again you put a number with something we can effectively account for with something we can't unless we catch them. We have added over 220 miles worth of barriers in the last decade also.
@seabolt_kim @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi I did read that but it is not effective or efficient. And they have no power to stop large groups of people.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Because the use those background checks with ever changing mental health requirements that are so general that they could effectively remove huge groups of people for something as simple as being treated for depression.
@seabolt_kim @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi More immigration reform is needed but Congress has been working on this for 50+ years. In the 80s we just gave amnisty to 11million and that only encouraged more to come when we should be encouraging them to fix their home country and make it like the US they want to live in.
@seabolt_kim @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Military drones just fly over and spot and although it's nice still requires a BP to get to an area an catch them. On top of that we are seeing them come hundreds at a time what are the BP agents to do there.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The wall makes it harder on criminals and the gun laws make it harder on legal citizens.
@seabolt_kim @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi All reactive technologies. That still does not reduce the amount of BP agents doing active patrols across a 2000 miles span. BP are only effectively patrolling 20 miles at a time. So you would have to staff 24/7 a minimum of 3 agents is 300 agents. Drones can do nothing but watch
@AJPMann @NikkiJoy17 @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi But there is no technology that can be active 24/7 that stands at a designated spot and proactively keep people from crossing said designated spot. Oh yeah there is it is a Wall.
@AJPMann @NikkiJoy17 @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Cool another great what abouism. The only reason that number is higher then what goes over the border is because you can't account for what you haven't caught. However this area is where technology could do better.
@MelissaNymeros @AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi No that is not what we tell you about guns. Restricting access for legal gun owners to obtain or use their weapon is not the same as making it harder for criminals to to break the law.
@MonkOnAStump @GravXReviews @richardfoc @SubParHusband @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi Senate is not an independent branch of the government. It is part of the legislative branch. In which representative of the states majority interests vs the house which are regional interests.
@AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi The wall is to stop groups large and small. Curtail the drugs/human trafficking by making it harder but yes criminals will figure out a way to overcome the law but that doesn't mean we just throw our hands up.  BP can not be everywhere 24/7 and technology is reactive.
@AJPMann @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi So many things wrong here.  Only organized crime can tunnel and even so having a 7ft deep footer puts it in the hard rock that takes special equipment.  You can't safely go over a 2+ story wall. Drones can't carry the volume of drugs you think. The ones that can show on radar.
@AppropsDems @HouseDemocrats @LeaderHoyer @POTUS If you are not watching well enough to see that both parties are equally responsible for this.  Both dug in and only seeing their view and listening to echo Chambers like this.
@amerycan @blazerella1 @AppropsDems @HouseDemocrats @LeaderHoyer @POTUS On top of that you are missing the fact that it is not just families here in there escaping bad lives. It is entire caravans of thousands to try and integrate and only a small precentages want to assimilate. The rest want their life style from there here.
@amerycan @blazerella1 @AppropsDems @HouseDemocrats @LeaderHoyer @POTUS Considering how much is open it is a start. We pay approx 19bil per year in actions related to illegal immigrants. In that same time frame is 285 billion. So even if we stop 1/4 of the traffic with the wall that is 71 billion.  Plus the trade agreement funds between Mex and US.
#GovernmentShutdown 1.) Apparently the government employees are not paid enough to plan for the future. 2.) Or they have poor planning skills and are in charge of our day to day federal lives 3.) Only surpassed in the private sector by Walmart for the number of employees. #taxes
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio The dispute that I have with your image is it ,being atheistic , disregards the Word. Gen is very clear to have said to have made us in his image and Dominion over the earth.  However to each his own I will live my life knowing there is a God and the Joy that brings me.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio You are correct there I am assuming that God had a fixed outcome to get to. Outcome none the less he already knows good or bad for humans. We just have to take the long way to get there.
@lemortebarthur @Applesaucey5 @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @Patriot303 Yes he was on several TV shows over the years.  He was also managing the operation of several business. He knew who to hire to get things done. It was not until he ran under the R that Hollywood turned against him. When he is no longer president they will be begging for his money
RT @BootUpPD: BootUp is proud to announce our acceptance as a STEMworks by @WestEd accomplished program, clearing rigorous design principle…
@kanakasue @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Ok this is the most asinine what aboutisms to date.  There are agencies to deal with them hence why they were caught. However they are citizens wether you like it or not. They can spend the rest of their lives in jail for their crimes but has nothing to do with the subject.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio lol that is an interesting .. not my thing but wow.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I hate to say it this way but it is a bit like writing code with and endless amount of random variables but checks and balances to get your desired outcome. You know what your outcome is because that is what you wanted. However the path there is not fixed.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Simply put God can see the entire lifespan of a molecule from the moment it is created. I personally like to envision (just in a kidding way) a person with a microscope and a petri dish and watching the results of the environment he created all at once.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Ok watched your video.  I believe in evolution with the support of Gods creation. Since God does not deal with time billions of years is of no consequence like we look at it.  With the big bang or even series of big bangs. God wrote the rules(physics) we all are created by.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio … even current stuff we "know" like the temperature of the sun or what our sun will do in millions of years. These are things that we think we have figured out that as a realist we also have to admit that we could be wrong.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio There is no unintelligent design because we only know what we can experience. Everything is created by the original rules set forth from the big bang. We as humans only apply our theories based on the observations but we can not ever know everything ...
@foodhealthlife @JesseCharlesLee Congress failing to pass a budget and have failed to do so twice a year for many years. We have been running paycheck to paycheck
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I have to admit I appreciate the challenge.( steel sharpens steel.)  I had to look up the word "epistemology"
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Taking that scripture in context it is not referring to life or death it is the context of those that falsely not believing in resurrection after Christ. aka falling a sleep in our faith.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio As and earthly father knowing the love for my children I have how much more is an eternal perfect father having love for me.  Yes I was using Pascal's wager as a basic starting point. I am however in no doubt and do not live for this life alone.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Start here if you are willing https://t.co/L7mfhapadE
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God did not cause the flood he removed himself from the world and gave an option to Noah who had to choose to follow the instructions and be faith full in executing the instructions. Babel was humans pride that he told us through prophets would happen if we continued.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio In this very statement you prove that regardless what is in your path steering you still have the choice to do what you do or not.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio When it comes down to it nothing I say will change your mind. You have the free will to do what you want. I know who God is and he is good. I will enjoy my life and after life with him. The bible does promise an everlasting live for all it is just whether it is in heaven or not.
@RepKatieHill @HouseDemocrats As terrible as this is the air traffic controlers should be a privatized industry since the bulk of air traffic is commercial traffic. There should be a federal liaison there to monitor the government's interest but all controllers should not be on government payroll.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I am not here to prove to you that God exists. I know he does. I see him in everything. I feel him through the spirit. You will have to make the choice to follow or not. I am sure you know the old saying. If I am wrong and there is no God no big deal. If you are wrong then well.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio To a child a father can seem cruel or uncaring of what the child is going through as the father trying to guide the child to a life that he wants for them. The child still must choose the path they will take.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God exists. That is why the microverse is the same as the macroverse. The rules that he set into motion still move and are not predestined. God may know what has happened but he just created the rules what we call the laws of physics.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I did not say Satan made me do it. It is of my own choice when I sin. God only does what we ask though obedient prayer. Satan though being selfish will tempt and complicate and use God's word against you. Your choice to listen or not.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God sent Jesus to die for our sins. To make it were our work is not what gets us to heaven. A father that wants his people to be with him had to make up for Adams first sin. A father that can not force himself on our lives.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I don't know if you have children or not. When they are young you try and keep them from harsh lessons by communicating with them the right way and occasionally punishing or omonishing them when they go the wrong way.  They have absolute free will when they are an adult.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio With the holy spirit as his messager he speaks. Today's world is so out of tune with the spirit that when the message went out it fell upon def hearts.  We in our forms are sinful so God can not be here.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Just because God has placed someone in your path and communicates does not mean he swiped his hand down and moved you like a chess piece. You have to choose to follow his directions. If you don't then someone else will.
@ZiegenfusChuck @senatemajldr What are the Bill numbers?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP What is the bill numbers for us to research?
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God knows it all and knows your heart and obedience but he is not forcing you to be obedient. God will accomplish his goals regardless your obedience.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Adam and Eve let in sin to this physical world. Which means Satan owns this world. bad things happen not because of God but because of disobedience and sin.  God can not go outside of a rule he has created. Breaking his word would be a sin. If we are not obedient someoneelse will
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Your Phillip reference is incorrect. The angel of the Lord appeared to him and told him where to go. Phillip had to make a very specific choice to follow the Lord to meet Enoch. If Phillip did not respond and choose to Obey, God would have allowed someone else to fill the need.
@LMFinney ahh so it is chronologically backwards. Thank you. I wish I can find its corresponding S or HR because I need to read it and see it. otherwise it is just hearsay in my opinion.
@LMFinney I am really not trying to be difficult but this has been repeated over and over even by representatives but I can not find on the legislative website where they actually worked on it.
@LMFinney That is misleading as no where other then the title does it say it is actually passed.  "McConnell says the Senate will vote on the bill Wednesday"  "wall appears to have ended" "proposal in the works" "If no bill is passed by Congress"
@LMFinney @RoyBlunt Name the S- Record or the HR Record that you are referencing because this 116th congress has worked on 1033 different items and HR 48 was introduced specificity to block the wall.
@blogvader @RoyBlunt They put 3.2 Billion to it the last two years. So they were working on it.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Oh and look at the wonderful barrier they are crossing right over.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump These type people.  https://t.co/qw6b5MDb5t
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Why not do both? Why not plug the holes in the wall and the system the wall supports.  There is no illegal metering system. POE are not currently hotels. We know the system is broke. Congress has to fix it. But turning a blind eye to those that cross illegally is not the answer.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Then they can stop at the first stable  border they cross. And I am sorry but local gang violence is not a reason either. Only government oppression or waring factions like in Syria.
@3x10to8mps @NewDay @SenBlumenthal One person did not do it alone. Wether he is taking responsibility or not. Congress has failed the American people it is supposed to support. Government should not be paycheck to paycheck
@SenGillibrand No
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Just crossing the line and saying I want a better life does not make you a refugee in need of a better life.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump ...of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself...
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump There is a finite amount of people that can be processed at one point and time.  On top of that they are also in a country that has offered them asylum. Asylum is not guaranteed just because you don't like your home country.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio And speaking of Phillip - Phillip had to obey God and willingly choose to be obedient to what God wanted. God did not act unilaterally
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio I’ve put a huge stone on the road to Mount Zion, a stone you can’t get around. But the stone is me! If you’re looking for me, you’ll find me on the way, not in the way.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio were doing. They were so absorbed in their “God projects” that they didn’t notice God right in front of them, like a huge rock in the middle of the road. And so they stumbled into him and went sprawling. Isaiah (again!) gives us the metaphor for pulling this together: Careful!
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio embraced what God was doing as he straightened out their lives. And Israel, who seemed so interested in reading and talking about what God was doing, missed it. How could they miss it? Because instead of trusting God, they took over. They were absorbed in what they themselves
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Isaiah had looked ahead and spoken the truth: If our powerful God had not provided us a legacy of living children, We would have ended up like ghost towns, like Sodom and Gomorrah. How can we sum this up? All those people who didn’t seem interested in what God was doing actually
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Isaiah maintained this same emphasis: If each grain of sand on the seashore were numbered and the sum labeled “chosen of God,” They’d be numbers still, not names; salvation comes by personal selection. God doesn’t count us; he calls us by name. Arithmetic is not his focus.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Either or both happens to Jews, but it also happens to the other people. Hosea put it well: I’ll call nobodies and make them somebodies; I’ll call the unloved and make them beloved. In the place where they yelled out, “You’re nobody!” they’re calling you “God’s living children.”
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio right to shape one lump of clay into a vase for holding flowers and another into a pot for cooking beans? If God needs one style of pottery especially designed to show his angry displeasure and another style carefully crafted to show his glorious goodness, isn’t that all right?
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Who in the world do you think you are to second-guess God? Do you for one moment suppose any of us knows enough to call God into question? Clay doesn’t talk back to the fingers that mold it, saying, “Why did you shape me like this?” Isn’t it obvious that a potter has a perfect
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God is given the glory to all things and is completely capable of doing all things however he is a lawyer and a judge. He can not break his own rule of law. God does not make or allow bad things happen.  He will however do what you ask of him is how healings happen.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio These are all examples of the individual pushing away from God and God stepping away.   Paul in his case still had to accept the healing that was give to him.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,1 he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work. - Timothy 2:21 it is up to the individual to chose to follow God.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God prepared the way no different then the brick layer laying the path.  We places them down it is our choice to follow the path or make out own.  The potters clay is only as good as the land it was pulled from our how it is purified cooperating with the Lords will.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Most of Gods "intervention" in the Bible are people pulling away from God so they are not under his protection.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio @YouTube Considering I am a person that understands my job does not fall with in the hours of business. I see where his doesn't stop or start when you think it does. Non of us have the right to judge or apply generic business standards to the presidency or even congress.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio Rev 3:20 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.		doesn't sound like a being forcing you to do anything but waiting for you.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio 2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio @YouTube Understand the being president doesn't mean your job is at your desk. He is constantly being briefed on one thing or another. Official meetings are one thing but I will agree that he needs to stay off the golf course unless he is conducting business.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio @YouTube Please young man look past opinionated things like this. Full of half truths and cherry picked information.  Trump is a man like any other man.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio No hostility meant or implied. Just giving advice that you seem to be intelligent don't squander it on memes. Take it or leave it is your choice.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio God knowing the outcome doesn't mean he can intervene as he wrote the rules he must abide by.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio It says mercy and compassion. Which is in reference to exodus 33:19 where he says gracious and compassion. You are using the vs out of context. In the letter to the Romans he is telling them in your love of God you want to follow the will of God.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio Lol ok you got me there. Next time use your intelligence not you memes. And take it step further and wright or call his office.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio No what is holding our country hostage is political stances on both sides. Congress in my opinion is more at fault for it since they have had decades to address this. The current push is because there are oganized caravans (3) either here or headed this way.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio If you want immigration reform talk to your representative. That's what they are there for.  As far as the added judges and BP agents their salaries also come from your paycheck and now it would be annual instead.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio Some more BP is fine and doing technology to the ports of entry are fine. And you mean immagration judges because the lawyers are up to those crossing over.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio Google usa today and border video and you will see how open out borders really are. People like to say  the wall has been proven in effective but then quote that illegal immigration is down in the last 10 years. Which happens to coincide with 300 miles of border wall/barrier.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio How is securing a border in the way that most BP request it be done destroing all that we hold dear? Or just in a way that you feel is wrong? Quoting scripture doesn't make you a pastor it is the result of being Christian and applying that faith to your life.  #Haveawonderfulday
@chrisgeidner @maggieNYT @gabrielmalor Ok explain to me why it is wrong to put stipulation on the place that asylum can be made. If there are places not directly on the border to start the process of asylum why is that a bad thing.
@SenSanders You have just as much power to do so. It takes less then 1% of the total budget to put a stop to this. Wether you agree with the way he is doing it or not he is at least trying to end it.
@AliDee12017 @veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump That I will agree with because it gives them a false since of righteousness because they assume that all illegal immigrants are families wanting to better there lives. My counter to that is a thief wants to better his life at the expense of yours. Illegal immigrants are the same.
@MarceloMezquia @marcorubio Seems like a violent reaction to an innocent tweet. You might want to seek counseling.
@chrisbrownofca1 @Rapieress @marcorubio There is a difference between knowing the outcome and no free will. We know the outcome of the Alamo. Did we remove their free will to participate in it? God I outside of time. When the first seed was planted he seen the forest turn to dust.
@LawsNatural @marcorubio Fact is the only people responsible for the death of an individual is the person holding it and pulling the trigger.
@LawsNatural @marcorubio You take all responsibility from the people actually pulling the trigger on through Rubio to the gun manufacturer. Why stop there? Why not blame the steel industry for making the barrels? Or all the engineers that sit and think up more efficient ways to make the elements for guns
@SharinStone @marcorubio Who implied he was? Or even dictator?
@AliDee12017 @veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Facts are that people from all political parties seem to ignore the law when they feel it is in their way or doesn't directly apply to them. Or being opposed to the law that doesn't effect them personally in any way but gives them a false since of Justice to stand up to it.
@veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Then by nature you can not assume that it is racist to want to keep people out since you can not know what race they are. It is however racist to assume you do.
@mythdebunker @veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump And to be within the letter of the treaty true asylum must be requested within  the first stable border you cross.
@mythdebunker @veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Where in my thread have I treated the two as the same? And the quotes are not needed because it is either legal or illegal neither term is up for question or debate. Legal asylum is a process in itself. Can also be started before ever leaving.
@AliDee12017 @veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump I appreciate the support but do not stoop to the generallities they speak.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Again I would fight or die. No one on this Earth will harm forcefully take my children. I do understand because I do have friends that are fighting in their country.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump I did not imply anything of the sort. But the law has to be applied to you equally as someone who walked 10ft. Asylum is a process not a magic wand. Asylum can be requested before stepping a foot out of your home country.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Personally I would fight. That is my nature. I would teach my children to fight. I would change what I could or die trying.  No one can force you to do anything. You make the choice to submit or not.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Talk to your representative about your ideas of a solution to the problem.
@veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump You assume there are no Caucasian people south of the border? Or that it is not sometimes easier to get a visa into one of those countries and then travel to our southern border?
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump I always ask the question. Why can they not make their lives better in their home country's? No government or military can stand against the collective will of it's people. Why is it considered stronger to leave and leave your family and friends to continue to deal with it.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Yes that is the only reason. Yes I am ok with it because I personally do not imply there is malice in it just logistical reasoning. There are no family detention centers.
@veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump It is law. Policy is to enforce it. Either reference is breaking the law and is a misdemeanor. In this case though the people must be detained and not allowed to cross into the US. Eventually returned to their home countries.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump The only time children are not returned to the adults when they are released is if there is question to the fact that the children belonged to the adults. And occasionally some bureaucratic red tape at times. This does not mean there is malice.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Just because you ask for asylum does not mean you are granted it. You have to meet the criteria and prove who you are.  Even then you are not to be just released into the population unaccounted for. Asylum is not a magic wand for citizenship.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Seeking asylum has to be done at a port of entry and sometimes the answer is no. Crossing the border illegally twice is a felony. However even as the first time they can not just write them a ticket and release them into American population. So they must be detained until deportd
Me too. https://t.co/0dbRyqbPlI
@tonysnapon @GeoffRBennett @HallieJackson This is an unsubstantiated assumption. You assume that Trump is guilty of a crime before the facts are out. The 6th amendment applys to him equally as it applies to you.
@BoltonMom @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump That only applies to the first border you cross and you have to go to a port of entry. Those in Mexico are not fleeing for their lives. They are running from them. There is a difference.
@Kinkajou5123 @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump No one said or implied for life. You are making and unsubstantiated claim that the children are never returned. The only children that are not is if there is question to wether they belonged to the people who brought them in the first place.
@momofcon @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump You realize that is just as much of a conspiracy theory as those that said Obama was going to declare marshal law and detain everyone in old Walmarts. And has as much validity as a Flat Earther.
@my_shenanigons @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Citizens are removed from their families daily when parents or care takers or even the children make poor choices like break the law.
@LinusAlso @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump As sad as it is the only people responsible for that child's pain and anguish is their own parents. They made the choices to cross illegaly vs going though proper channels and following the law.
@GinnyMorse3 @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump The same could be said to people that have a emotionally bigoted view like yourself.  Facts are the law is the law. And the law must be upheld. If you don't like the law talk to your representative.
@Disneypixiegirl @t_inker58 @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump One last thing. Trump is not doing it. The law is. Don't like the law, being that is a representative republic, talk with your Congress person.
@Disneypixiegirl @t_inker58 @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump There are no detention centers that house families either. If one was created it would be a logistical mountain to overcome to ensure safety for each unit of various size and keep other people in the detention area from harming them.
@Disneypixiegirl @t_inker58 @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump You are assuming that there is malice in the intent of the execution of the law. Regardless of legal citizenship status if you break the law you go to jail and since a minor can not go to the same facility as an adult. Logistically they are separated.
@veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Please also point out in the law where the BP had any leeway to transport people to a port if they were caught. It is no different from and officer letting you go after speeding. You still broke the law and he is mandated to uphold it. The executive order just upholds the law.
@veabiler @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Not exactly sure your point of reference but it is actually racist to assume only people of any race could be caught crossing the border illegally.
@KiddShilo @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Technically it is not in the Constitution. And even if it was the Constitution does not apply to citizens or non-citizen  it is an agreement between states. The bill of rights only gets applied to non-citizen people because of a SCOTUS decision.
@DagDahlo @astosia_s @Brimshack @KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Seeking asylum through a port is not illegal. Crossing second time is a felony. The only kids not immediately returned to the adults they were with were either born in custody or there is question that the adults and the kids belong to each other and that it was trafficking.
RT @KayaJones: I want to show other celebrities who voted for @realDonaldTrump it’s ok to come forward. Better yet let’s show the world how…
@_SeanDonnelly @bethanyshondark https://t.co/pC5xdTS3co 	 Does this make her racist against people? Or just a fan? You see what you want to see in the photo of the boys.
@_SeanDonnelly @bethanyshondark No you are assuming because that is what you would be doing and thinking in your mind that they have malice in their hearts. Being a black out game and they obviously have school spirit they went all in no different then your nfl fan that does the same thing any given Sunday.
@PH4901 @BillieJack12 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Since the intelligence factor went down here let me explain it simply.  No not my thing. To each his own but you can take your offer and your scat fetish and go sit and spin in the Twitter corner repeating to yourself. "momma says I am specials"
@MaddowBlog @maddow You should be sued because this is flat out slander.
@_SeanDonnelly @bethanyshondark Blackface is not just the action of putting black paint on. It is doing so with the intent to do stereotypical black actions or as the early TV shows. Anyone that says that it is, is intellectually dishonest.
@jacobsoboroff @maddow Can no one put any responsibility on the parents? These aren't just people who where legally running to the grocery store and kids got kidnapped. They were breaking the law and have to be put in jail. Kids can not be kept with their parents in jail.
@agileborgi @jacobsoboroff @maddow How about trying facts there is no mass conspiracy to suppress voters from either party.  So much disinformation out there that just keeps getting repeated.
@Simoinfinite @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Calling harassment when you commented on my post and the best you got is "you wish". Ouch that hurts. Think on this. If you take a moment and look completely at the facts on anything Trump related you will see that the common denominator is he is working on a solution.
@Simoinfinite @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson https://t.co/987XJIHmFF
@Simoinfinite @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson So you are in the free lunch line then? Because if you think for a living and spit the junk out you just said then no one is going to pay you for it.
@PH4901 @BillieJack12 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Considering her response was 100x more intelligent then the vile you spilled from the cut in you face. She is smarter then you.
@Simoinfinite @adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson And you have to wait for a good fart to clear your train of thought.  I am so sick of your left sided assumption filled vile hate and disrespectful nature. Regurgitating the stuff over and over wishing it was true. Learn to think for yourself if you can.
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Fact is he did not immediately make a judgement like everyone and I include myself in that did. He waited till the facts were out. And he would have condemned the boys had the story been true.
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Fact is he walked up into the teens face. Face is nobody says anyone has to move when someone comes into their personal space. Fact is the all the adults in the manner acted disrespectful.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson For an MD you are the most deceitful person I have ever seen.
@jbrown_67 @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump That unfortunately is the law of precentages.  This is not Trump's wall even though he is pushing for it. BP  wants it. And it is a start not the whole solution.
@SenSanders Prove actual racism. Not just your opinion.
@jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Ann Coulter had no more control over it then you did.
@jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump And you realize that the Senate is not willing to negotiate over less then 1% of the budget. For something that all of them but the freshman have voted in favor of several times in their carrier and Trump is just standing up to them.
@jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Hmm who didn't pass a budget before the last day? Who has the government running paycheck to paycheck? Who has been "working" on immagration reform for years and years before Trump has stood up to them to make them do/start something.
@caywill18 @jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Cool fact. More drugs and human trafficking then that. More what aboutisms.
@jbrown_67 @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump There is a percentage that does and the only reason we have numbers for it is because you can't account for what you haven't caught.
@jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Oh need to fix your hash tag. #govermentshutdown  Because all of our government has failed us.
@jcglezt @DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Because there are miles and miles that have little to none. Google usa today and border video. See for yourself.
@DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Trump did not create the mess. He just happens to be in office to deal with the current caravans. We are up to 3 now.
@DeLaHay14534 @gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Actually if you look at the facts we have been increasing border fencing and walls for the last decade. So you would be incorrect to say they have had no impact on people crossing.
@mjetowin1 Thanks for the info.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You are right you can't stop them so what is your solution? Do nothing?
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump So like the point 0.001%  of all crime associated with white nationalist. Yep sounds like a real high priority there. So is am not seemed racist "black panthers" crime rate is not on my priority list either.
@gravy469 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You may think you have the mic drop but you are forgetting this is our entire governments failed policies for 20+ years.
@KamalaHarris Spend another term in Senate and have something more the orange man bad. I like the energy but I feel is lacking in experience. I am willing to cross the isle for someone with credentials and experience.
@David01243 @truebot9 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Truebot9
@David01243 @truebot9 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Ha ha he blocked me
@KamalaHarris Can someone please show me what she did before being in the senate? She has only been there 1 year. Sincerely not being negative.
@truebot9 @David01243 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Kim was being more and more embolden knowing he could push and no one was pushing back. When Americans said enough through Trump then he backed down and wanted to negotiate.
@truebot9 @David01243 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump And as far as what is true on the last days of Obama returning millions of dollars to an active terroristic country. It should not have been done and he knew it is why he waited to his last days.
@truebot9 @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Funny - Salem Saberhagen - I don't watch just one news agency because I do want the truth. I also watch world news to see what they are saying. The hostility from N Korea has dropped dramatically across the board. You making an assumption and insulting me tells more about you.
@jhollon @realDonaldTrump You know as well as anyone even if he did your type of people would still find some fault because that is all you are looking for. Be negative all you want it changes nothing.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hmm just like a that the two biggest deflection agents and the "what aboutisms" on Twitter speak. Even if he did something today you would spin it saying he is making people work without pay. So both of you shut up and quit dividing people.
RT @JohnnyAlbertini: @da_wessel @TheDemocrats Only the party of @TheDemocrats would cheer and hope for the President to fail. If the Presid…
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I have not heard of Kim wanting to blow up us or our allies in a while. So by those standards it is progressing to the peace that you people say you want but want to tear down people at least trying.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Prove it or shutup. You say you are in the media go to Russia do the journalism to back the proof that Russia is puppeting Trump. When it comes down to it real people see you for what you are nothing but a YouTube/tweeter that repeats the trash to bring Trump down and you up.
@ReallyBobCoyle @SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump (cont) I believe that Congress has failed us on this subject for 20+ years. Especially on this subject. And yes it should have been delt with before now. However even in our own lives we let things build up until we just have to deal with them. Now it is the time to deal with it.
@ReallyBobCoyle @SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump I appreciate the respectful response. I believe some of it as you say posturing. Form both sides. The MSM controls the news so your question on why we don't see it. They are still there and there is now a third one comming up through Mexico now.  (Cont)
@andreaabwob @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump An opinionated ignorant comment. Virtual fencing requires transmit and receiver. Do you want to tag all foreigners so if they break our border they get shocked. Of course you don't because that statement is just as dumb as yours.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Your opinion doesn't matter. It would be different if you were ever center on any issue but if Trump says it it is bad. He did not say HIS administration did it alone. He said it is going on now during his administration.
@bjuberg @SenSanders Do you not understand that Congress could have delt with this issue well before Trump dug his heals in. As far as that goes both him and Congress need to get it together.
@Jurka13196390 @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse If you think that way maybe you need see the Dr about that zit on your neck it is about to pop. He is a man and I agree with him on the wall. He is human and not above reproach or replacement.
@MarshaShelton17 @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse On that subject I did not vote for Trump because of his personal life. I voted because he had business sense and wasn't a Clinton.
@MarshaShelton17 @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Deflection on the current discussion stay on task.
@brownchubbybear @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The those that say they do not know what is going on are lying or intentionally playing stupid so that they can make it seem like the president has no plan. When he has taken into advisement the things that the BP that he met with and those that came out of committee.
@brownchubbybear @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Congress has details from committee that they gave him and he is putting in to this. It's how it works. Put your hate of trump aside and see that he is only doing what he can being opposed at every turn. If he wipes his ass with the left hand you people spin it ashatredforlefties
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats No waste is salaries for life for Congress that fails us more and more each year.
@brownchubbybear @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Do you need details? No it's not your job.  Let BP handle the details.
@12eal7alk @Jeremy42432067 @LelaJamonique @WilliamBLong21 @Uncle_Jimbo You also know that there are still tribes that actively hate other tribes and only stand in unison against outsiders. But would also prefer the other tribes not exist.
@RepMcGovern He did not create this crisis alone Congress has failed us by not addressing all of these issues from border security to immagration reform.
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse The current walls and segments of fence should all be updated with new technology in both monitoring and physical design. It should always be that way.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @WhiteHouse Easement covers all property disputes. Desert has to be covered because that is the easiest to do and to cross at. Cliffs that are higher elevation still need something even if it is just a negative angled barrier at the top. Water is no barrier it is a hindrance at best.
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse I will admit that one is the smallest I have ever seen but 50 amp is only good for lightweight metal.
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Missing your point I did not dispute that a set of plasma cutters could do the job. My dispute is groups of individuals can get bolt cutters and go though the chain link fence people want to put up. If they go though this plasma cutting effort it is going to take time.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @WhiteHouse We don't have a wall in large swaths of land. Take a look.  https://t.co/VXrDHNo9DA
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Agreed which makes them more visible to BP and in conjunction with an artificial intelligence driven camera network makes a stronger solution.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @WhiteHouse I have been saying that tech alone can not do it. Patrolling agents can't do it alone.  Wall+tech+BP+immigration reform+drug therapy for addicts = solution.
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse A generator to do so is 100-250lbs. Plus fuel. You can not carry that any amount of distance.
@brownchubbybear @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr That's why his proposal includes adding more agents.
@Melanin007 @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Bankruptcy in big business is common practice to stop collection  in a purchased asset and fix the business to be profitable.
@Melanin007 @1greenpirate @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You do understand that our national debt figure is not the amount of money that the government owes and one. It is the sum of all borrowed money by consumers.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @WhiteHouse What you can't even agree to use technology in conjunction with the wall?
@iheartbmovies @fishy_wanda @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Powers to do so can not be carried. Cameras can easily be installed on the infrastructure. And if Walmart can have an AI that can track you picking up a product and putting it down elsewhere then we can apply that to minimize the staff
@HempBags @ScribesShade @SpeakerPelosi Proof or quit throwing out false hoods to draw a line from people who think differently than you to the boogie man of Russian involvement.
@freekev22 @ScribesShade @SpeakerPelosi No it is not. It is a democratically elected representative republic. This keeps mob rules of the ever swaying public view from crushing other views.
@sanfranreed @ScribesShade @SpeakerPelosi 21 billion from the people that actually deal with it. The 50-70 billion is a number thrown out by Democratic committee members off the cuff with nothing to back it up. As far as the time frame so it is a large project. It has been worked on in some form for the last 20+ years.
@fishy_wanda @WhiteHouse Hmm that sure looks like an earlier version of what is currently proposed. So if replaced it would be even better.
@Soldier_Cynic @GOP @realDonaldTrump Three separate caravans in two years=crisis  And name a piece of technology that covers large expanses of land at a designated spot available 24/7 that proactively deters people from entering. All other tech is reactive and still allows people through.
RT @PeteHegseth: Apparently #ExposeChristianSchools is trending in the US. 		Let’s start a real one:		MOST of today’s PUBLIC (or government…
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Fence can be cut through with a $10 pair of bolt cutters.
@iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Great am glad that is in this proposal also. You know its like they are listening to the people that actually deal with the border.
@TheDemocrats Please reference the HR bills that these 9 are. Because the people deserve to see and read them for their selves.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse To continue on the water if there was a large convoy of militarized people coming to cross they could easily have boats.  The desert lands mostly have automotive barriers nothing to stop walkers.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Water is not a barrier as anyone who can swim. Carry a pool noodle or inflate a pair of jeans can get across. Cliffs the have to climb up are the only natural barrier. National parks. Great government already Owens them. People's back yards it is called an easement.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse You may be joking but unfortunately a large swath of people believe that is a valid argument against the wall.
@SenSanders Congress has failed us! The government should not be paycheck to paycheck! Do your job so the President doesn't have to hold your feet to the fire. Federal governments #1 is protect it's people not pander to those that run from theirs. And not to creating endless federal jobs.
@fishy_wanda @iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Over 30 feet of ladder is 100-200lbs to have to get up and over. Risk being seen carrying it and installing it and risk not falling to your death from 3 stories.  Would be easier to make it through the port. Oh wait that is why the proposal also has money for them.
@iheartbmovies @MckillopTony @WhiteHouse You do understand it is organized crime that builds tunnels not individuals wanting a better life on top of that with the proposed barrier they would have to dig 7ft down and back up. To do that without being killed would take time and money and carry the risk of being seen.
@MckillopTony @WhiteHouse Because the wall is part of the over all solution not an end in itself. The sad part is you logically knew that and because of your hatred of Trump can't see the think it through.
@SenatorLeahy Before I get the other technologies argument. There is no other technology that can span long distances at a designated spot 24/7 that can proactively deter people from crossing. You can quibble over the design but a wall is better then a fence in strength, durability.
@SenatorLeahy It is funny how everyone says the wall I ineffective but likes to refer to they steady drop over the last 10 years of border crossing. It is because we have been building more and more walls and other barriers in that same time frame.
@RanchoGordo @SenFeinstein In my opinion you have shown exactly why the federal government needs to stay out of  business management. You choose to do it. It should NOT be mandated to them. You probably maintain less turn over and a better quality employee.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Nice rebuttal.  Have a nice day!
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP If you can name one piece of tech that can stand great distance and actively deter people from crossing the border I will concede that we don't need a wall.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Everyone say tech tech tech. It would be amazing if we had a piece of tech that can stand 24/7 in place and deter people from crossing a designated area. Give you an answer it's a wall.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP To expand on it there are about 5 different versions of the wall / fence / auto barriers along the border as each new group comes in with s new idea on what will work. So as the OP said it was not working there so let's find out why and fix it on the next version.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP I do read statistics I also know the only way to have acurate statistics is to actually stop and account for them.  Numbers show higher at the ports of entry because this is where we can count. You can't count the ones you didn't catch.
@ReallyBobCoyle @SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump Kinda sick of this line of thought. For the facts they did spend money on the wall. 3.2 billion. it is now a crisis because as of today there has been 3 caravans of people during the last two years. So 17000 people give or take is what a party ?
@rnelson0 @JohnBoozman @All100Senators Again for the nth time today. This statement keeps getting repeated but no one can point anyone to an specific HR bill that was addressed and passed. Please provide it or stop repeating it.
@PsychoHazard @tailsct @erinely @earlessvangogh2 @king_jeremy_b @mikedenali1 @curaider @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @GOP Still keep hearing this but there is nothing on the legislature site to back this claim up. If you have a specific HR measure provide it otherwise quit repeating this saying.
@tinat1967 @simplydan @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump And both years they put money to the wall. Total of 3.2 billion so far.
@Deerlake18 @Yamiche *throw
@Deerlake18 @Yamiche I love how you have to through Russians and Trump together when you have no proof of anything other then an ill timed business deal by his company. The ceremony has just as much validity as Dems showing all of the federal workers that are bad with money and planning.
@jhmallah @WhiteHouse @BBCJonSopel Prove your claim.  Facts over opinion
@SenBlumenthal Richard really so what. You want the laws changed for dreamers work on a bipartisan deal to make it happen and the president will sign it. Stop seeing your way for the path to citizenship as the only way. Quit using them as pawns in your battle to stay relevant to your constituen
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris To pay for it through taxes. This person is paid 10 per hour. So for 10 hrs he is effectively the other person's slave. I have simplified it for example and even if the percentages change the fact stays the same. If the money is not voluntarily give it is stolen/slavery.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris When it comes down to it there are compassionate people in the communities willing to help. But you can not mandate that people be slaves to others.  Say for example a person that doesn't work has healthcare that costs 100 per month and another person who does work is mandated...
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris People are dying because of their own poor choices. They have the ability to make these changes for themselves. Skill levels, the communities they live in and the people they work for. As federal socialism grows it removes those choices.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris This is a community issue not a State or federal government issue. If a community what's to provide to encourage people to live there then by capitalism they can. You do not need make people from across the nations pay for people's poor choices.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris I do not agree with corporate bailouts either because they are done only to keep employees working. You will always have a poor class and a middle class and an upper class. If you move the poor up where the middle class is now everything shifts up.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris Healthcare is an individuals choice. Mandating that others pay for someone else's healthcare is making them slave to the person that did not make the proper choices in life to maintain them selves or learn skills.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris ...ity based services and are not socialism as they are bid services and people in the communities have the choice how many of the services they want to offer to their community to entice people to live there. Again not socialism as it is a bid process managed by community.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris I hate that people compare socialism to infrastructure. The only reason the federal government is involved in roads is the minimum standard for roads that cross state borders. There for the federal government is there to manage the states.  All of the other services are commun...
@CharlesPPierce @JRubinBlogger @tedcruz How is a term limit a bad idea? There should not be carrier politicians on one office.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Please show us pictures of what you described so we can address the issue with it.  Technology used for tracking is purely reactive and does nothing to keep them out. Might as well spray them with ink like in the money bags. Effectively it is the same and depends on others totell
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats As a representative it is beneath you to imply that the president is a Russian asset without concrete proof. All you or your supporters have is opinion and conjecture. Trust me that if there was concrete proof we the conservatives would be calling for his removal also.
@ananavarro As a conservative I am ashamed of these young men.
@AnyDem2020 @RhinoSpiderCat @jaydeeaman @KamalaHarris Please describe to me what you really believe socialism is? Capitalism Allows the people to control change with their money to change businesses attitudes that we don't like. If the government is that "business" that has the effect of making you a slave.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP To further the "but more come into the port of entries". Less BP having to patrol open spaces means more at the PoE. These are locations where technology actually works to be proactive. However anywhere else technology is just reactive except for the wall.
@bren2915 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Love to dispute this stupid image. If the people had the technology and wherewithal to build a boat then land on the shores they would have a better chance of escape. The Canadian and those NW countries do not have a mass exodus to go live in the USA.
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson I never said though as a deterrent. The deterrent should have been to the adults in the child's life that put them in this situation with the slim hope that they will magically have a better wealthy life by comming to the USA. #fixyourhomecountry. #standup
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson I do. However my compassion for the individuals in the situation does not over power my logic that there is not much more they can do to care for a large group of individuals in the same place keeping them safe and looked after. Is it ideal? No
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson You are applying the label to Trump not truly understanding that if he was as you say you would be imprisoned or shot for saying it. He is not any where close to that. The government as a whole has to much dictation over day to day lives.
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson Interesting I do not see the presidents signature on this internal memo. You are assuming that because that the president is vocal in his support for securing the nation that he personally directed the bureaucrats to do this.
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson And the caging you speak of has been proven as a stunt. Yes detention centers have bars and walls so that people can take leave. This does not mean they are put into kennels like dogs. Detention centers are for their safety as well.
@JimDavi22164385 @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson There are thousands that are separated from their families that are citizens that commit crimes and those that some softhearted DHS personnel feels is improper treatment put in foster homes where they may or may not be cared for.  This is not a Trump thing this is GOV in general.
@lindgstevens @OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson Hey thanks for that. Did not see it. So it also says as a policy that parents on reentry which is a felony are separated from their families. That is the result of committing a felony.
@LeoTakacs @WA205581508 @themattrusso @SenSanders Hmm deflection. Most of us don't care. That all in all is the beauty of USA is if it doesn't effect us or our immediate family we don't really care. However since to those people that are gay tend to gravitate to media and design related work we get a disportionate representation
@DonGreg7 @SenSanders Governments only want increased minimum wage because it increases the tax revenue for them. Both income and sales tax.
@DonGreg7 @SenSanders Either way it is none of the government's business. Neither state nor federal.  Employers want to balance the product going out the door with the least possible costs. This includes employee costs.
@DonGreg7 @SenSanders Considering there is no slavery. The employees have the right to find another job. Then if an employer sees that it is effecting his product then her can make the changes necessary to retain employees. Employers don't have businesses to have employees they want to make money.
@WA205581508 @LeoTakacs @themattrusso @SenSanders That it only reason I returned to Twitter to start calling out hypocrisy and misinformation and add a flow of logic. Insults is what I get back more then actual logical arguments.
@OversightDems @RepCummings @RepJerryNadler @BennieGThompson The article literally says nothing. It gives a quote of an opinion ,from a person publicly denounces all things from the Trump adminstration, that this document is proof. Then quotes two other admin people who say no. Where is the actual documentation?
@LeoTakacs @WA205581508 @themattrusso @SenSanders Does that make you letters? For the left to say don't be shaming people for how they look sure do a lot of it. Hypocrite.
@SenSanders So you are saying smart businessmen started a series of business to make money and they did. *shocked*  Employees have the right to go to other businesses that pay more. The government needs to stay out of it.
@Kerry3T @al_dalluge @MidAmericanGuy @TheDemocrats @GOP @AOC @RashidaTlaib @FoxNews Yes I do. Unfortunately it has been distorted to make it look attractive to people that don't work for what they got.  To use the old adage socialism only works untill you run out of someone else's money.
@al_dalluge @Kerry3T @MidAmericanGuy @TheDemocrats @GOP @AOC @RashidaTlaib @FoxNews Social security is not socialism it is a forced retirement program. Unless it is misused you get this money back.  Medicare is no socialism it is an cheap government controlled healthcare supplemental benefit. Socialism is giving everything you have or most to the government.
@SenWarren All of Congress has failed us the American people. The government should not be running paycheck to paycheck. It should never get to the point of shutdown if you guys were doing your jobs.
@pdonkim @realDailyWire How is the vague attempt to compare Trump to a dictator relevant to the pro-life discussion? You want to make a point them make a case instead of posting a stupid meme.
@TheDemocrats Please name the HR references please.
@jgthomas204 @davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT ... worrysome. I am absolutely for bipartisan laws based on explicit terms of the type of reported issue mental health and defined length of time it is in effect. So we are in agreement on that part.
@jgthomas204 @davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT I agree that because out governing people in times past have restricted laws for groups they don't agree with. I am for criminal background checks and other limited to legal cases such as active restraining orders. But adding in mental health as it is currently defined ...
@jgthomas204 @davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT I agree legally there is nothing they can do but continue to try and enforce stricter gun laws. The effects of which only apply to law abiding citizens. Give the government the power to Target anyone when it comes to restricting rights is dangerous it can be used against you.
@jw_pincus @marcorubio I really dare you to show anywhere in the Constitution where it either says that phrase or where is says that any branch of the government has to remove their beliefs to serve the American people.
@jw_pincus @GoWyoRollTide @marcorubio The Constitution applies to the states just like every federal law. Not the individual citizen. States choose to prosecute citizens in reference to the federal law.
@jw_pincus @GoWyoRollTide @marcorubio Letters that a founding father wrote have no relevance to the Constitution and that phrase has been misused so much people believe it is in the Constitution. It is sad really no one even questions it. It is also sad that people thing the Constitution applies directly to people.
@jw_pincus @GoWyoRollTide @marcorubio No I am sorry you are so misinformed. He can apply his beliefs and way he chooses as long as he doesn't come to your house and forcefully say you have to be x religion.  Creating laws that may align also with the views of Christianity is not the same as forcing you tobechristian.
@jw_pincus @GoWyoRollTide @marcorubio Literally you are missing the point of a representative. His views Christian and otherwise are what his majority constituents elected him for.
@jw_pincus @marcorubio Jackson please stop using that phrase that shows up no where in the Constitution to validate. It says the government can not force you to be a religion but it does not say that your representatives can not be. Don't like Christian representatives to bad those that elected him do.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 The employeer has the right to choose what programs they want just as much as the employee has the right to work there or not. The federal / state government has no say in it.
@MickeyM593 @davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT Yep - not fear of them.
@jgthomas204 @davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT Because the only way to have the gun control you people what is to remove them from law abiding citizens. Therefore removing our ability to protect ourselves from non law abiding people.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 All abortions not medically necessary to save the mothers life. Can be prevented pre conception with birth control actions mentioned or the morning after pill.
@mryannagy @realDonaldTrump Very racist of you to say.
@ChrisJRhea @realDonaldTrump I have a problem with your statement. It takes all responsibility off of the individuals themselves. Anyone of us government employee or not has the risk of losing their jobs and they should have had a plan for it. Congress needs to do their jobs.
@evelyngerson @JohnCornyn That is an excuse.  People know exactly what they are doing. They are the ones seeking out "pain clinics" to get "DRs" to prescribe them to them.  Not matter where you are what you are doing your choices got you there.
@evelyngerson @JohnCornyn You want to know who is to blame for Opioid Crisis - Those that take the opioids. Self responsibility. Stop passing the buck.
@Isaythere @SenJackyRosen @SenatorLeahy Also the irony in your statement. It is very narrow minded in believing your opinion is the only intelligent one.
@Isaythere @SenJackyRosen @SenatorLeahy Thing about it is Trump is just another man. Not a dictator and if he ever did turn dictator then I would be right there fighting against it. Good luck in life to you as well as you seem to blame your current financial and family crisis on the government instead of yourself
@Isaythere @SenJackyRosen @SenatorLeahy Reaching down to insults shows you have no facts to back up your opinionated dramatized position.
@Isaythere @SenJackyRosen @SenatorLeahy This is not Trumps fault alone this is our failed Congress putting the government living paycheck to paycheck. The same goes for the individuals living pay check to pay check.	Congress has had time to put 1023 measures un budget related on the table since Jan3 - Fix that.
@Darryl_Dan @JohnCornyn This bill is the epitome of living pay check to paycheck and has been continued since 2017. However again the misinformation is "12/20/2018 Motion to reconsider laid on the table Agreed to without objection." is on H.Res.118 and is not a budget approval.
@Isaythere @SenJackyRosen @SenatorLeahy Please elaborate on how Trump hates citizens by insisting on securing the boarder and protecting us from those that can not follow the rules of law. Democrats are literally putting illegal and non citizens above the 800000 now. It is not a budget issue of &lt;1%
RT @GHOSTIN31234211: @KamalaHarris If people said that this was "white man magic" y'all would flip out. What does color and gender have to…
@davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT Adults fail to address bullying and end up making it worse on the victims of bullies. Fix that and there would be zero school shootings not gang related.
@davidhogg111 @ChrisMurphyCT Other then opinions give me one good reason for Americans not to be able to protect themselves how they see fit. Gun or not is your freedom as it is mine. Kids that have died with guns are because the Adults around them failed the kids. Not the gun.

@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Look up the USA Today video fly over.  It's an hour long video.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I will disagree there. A river is not a barrier of any sorts. Hindrance at best at high water season. Can be crossed with little to no effort. A cliff is a natural barrier.
H.R.695 - “Sec. 141. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there is appropriated for ‘U.S. Customs and Border Protection—Procurement, Construction, and Improvements’ $5,710,357,000 for fiscal year 2019, to remain available until September 30, 2023
@Darryl_Dan @JohnCornyn H.R.695 - “Sec. 141. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there is appropriated for ‘U.S. Customs and Border Protection—Procurement, Construction, and Improvements’ $5,710,357,000 for fiscal year 2019, to remain available until September 30, 2023
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I could agree with that.  The part that is on the budget for approval right now is just over 200 miles and it is left to the discretion of the Border Patrol to apply it. Even though this issue is addressed during every budget discussion every year. More political this year.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Lol - Slower people better picture -
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump We could also privatize several of the other departments. That way we can bid it out.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I think that through our representatives that every document and every department staffing levels should be addressed by congress. In businesses (large ones mainly) people can falsely justify the need for staff when really it is just an adjustment of process. Government is same
@SenGillibrand @senatemajldr Although I agree with you that there should be nothing more important on the docket then getting the budget done. The house has sent 600+ non budget related items through just since the first of the year. So everyone get it going.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump There is a lot of it that is only vehicle barrier that although not comfortable but you could walk through it.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Approximately 600 miles with nothing but river.
@Darryl_Dan @JohnCornyn I am sorry I still am not seeing and actual budget discussions or resolutions to pass the budget on that day.
@CashApp is there away to tie kids cash app to mine so the kids can order a card?
@Darryl_Dan @JohnCornyn Do you happen to have the bill ID for that because I am not finding it on the list? May be just missing it or it may be misinformation repeating as truth.
This goes for everyone you are responsible for the government shutdown. You either voted for the representatives or not. You allowed this to happen. And I am included in this. We need to remember this next election. #GovernmentShutdown #peopleenforcedtermlimits
@LawsNatural @marcorubio The only way children die around guns is if they are not taught to respect them or someone is bullied and ignored by adults untill they feel it is their only option. Guns don't kill children. Adults ignoring their responsibilities to children do!
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders It is a choice. It is a choice to continue to be victimized or feel like a victim. It is a choice not to make that change in your life to make it better even if it means working every waking minute. The 40 hr work week is a false narrative.
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders I sold door to door paper goods at the age of 10 to put food on my families tables. I have been one paycheck away from being out on the streets. I have also scene a young 6 year old man selling banana left creations to make money for his brothers and sister.
@andwal79 It literally is. You are not entitled to anything. Don't like your job get another. Can't find one in your area create one or move.
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders You always have a choice. The lie that keeps people down is that other people effect their choice and there is nothing they can do about it.
@ssudswilowicz @SenateGOP @DHSgov @SpeakerPelosi Skewed facts because that is the only place you can get some sort of figures. You can't quantify what is making it across the open borders if you can't catch and documents them.
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders The number one problem people make is trying to replace what their parents had in 1-5 years not understanding it took them 20+ to get there. This helps them justify debt and false entitlement. You know what your entitled to? Breathing that's it. Everything else you work for.
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders Yes because they feel like they need time off or they need this thing while neglecting the important things. Not planning.  I have been there. My parents have been there. But it takes smart choices and self control and determination.
@KamalaHarris Get a better job.
@Chrisrasa2 @TheDemocrats Do you understand that it is only organized crime people who tunnel? The average person is just going to walk a cross the open land areas. Or pay the gangs for passage.
@andwal79 @usey0urbra1n @fauxpunx1 @RonaldVandenPol @silva0072 @roknrollmartian @fireguy_bulldog @SenSanders Poor decisions keep people poor. That's it.  They have every opportunity anyone else does to work and bust there ass and get more skills and more work.
@SenSanders No proven over that it actually causes more poor people. More money in poor peoples hands that make poor decisions only makes the rich even richer.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Daca is the immagration bill not the bill to restart the government by approving the budget.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump That is your opinion and I respect that but I believe the issue is larger then you do.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump On your topic of drones that carry people I believe that law enforcement and EMTs in major metropolises need to have them before the regular public. BP should have then also.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Incomplete data = incomplete and up for interpretation and manipulation of the predictions. I would rather have the physical security that there is no way for a mass migration to easily happen.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Dude do you not understand I am not for this because of trump. Trump is starting the narrative and pushing for it. But Trump is President not my blind dictator or lead lemming. I think absolutely for my self. in my opinion I believe it should be done.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I agree that you could do it without the wall but if the wall was there it would be easier with the added benefit of actually stopping people.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I want more agents there and a wall every where else. And I want a tunnel at ports of entries that pass through different scanners that detect other stuff. Why can we not agree to have both? Even at 70 billion dollars over estimated ten years to complete is not that much.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump They continue to grow with no accountability. They 100% depend on tax payers to pay their salaries and benefits ever increasing the burden to the tax paying Americans.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I do not like bueracrates because they have the ability to effect people  lives without being elected or accountable to the American people. The government was never supposed to have these other agencies epa irs or anything else like that.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I am sorry that is a person. Right now I want to stop groups of people and organized groups of people.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Your right I assumed. I apologise for that. I do have political biased because of the examples of ideas that comes from people the representatives and Senators on the  Democratic side.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So if the wall is working and stopping some logically more wall will stop more.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You literally have the same amount of power to fix the issue.
@MarkSKrikorian I have one problem with this poll and really any poll that includes conservatives. Do to our very nature and personalities there are huge swaths of people not polled because they are either working, don't spend time online, and will not talk to anyone not needed on the phone.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 Cool information. But again how it is the employers issue? I do not believe the employers should provide any or deny any. If they choose to have a insurance that doesn't meet your needs then it is up to you to supplement it or find another job. Employers will adjust if needed.
@ReadFirst_ @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Your projecting. Because you are making it about race all the time that the people in charge even care about race. If it was 10000 white or one of each race in the world it doesn't matter. Come in legally or stay out.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I also can think of the fact that with the wall there ia infrastructure in place to add technology to like cameras where if someone does cross it can be alerted to a group and a image created that people could be found. And have actual numbers
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Mainly because you are basing it firmly on the number that can be reported. I get it we get reports from the agents that actually catch people at the border. Even they don't know how many they don't catch at the port nor the open border areas.  It is imposable to know.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Your solution have not actually stated a solution to stop people walking actoss the border. You have said more BP agents and technology. But no actual plan to protect the border only to catch more of the ones who risk going through a port.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump These people are paid to track these thinks. Do you not think they would have included this on the report. And personally if I was to want to cross illegally into a country i do not think I would go to a port even now because the Risk to be caught is higher then just walking in.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I know this has been said but I am not finding the link to the actual bill or even the bill name. If you have it I would love to look at it so I can do my duty and talk to my representatives
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Because the government has no way to generate revenue on it's own. So more employees means more taxes to tax payer.  Name one peice of technology on the market that can proactively stop people at a designated spot for an extended length of land.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I looked it up after we talked and the only references come from the one side so personally I have to take into account who it is coming from. As you do from the other side. I distrust
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You literally bring up every other thing then the fact that the wall does work. "What about visas" "what about ports" it is the wall
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Even if Trump's speech is partially incomplete to the public he has more data then you or I of Jon q public ever will.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You have been through in insults from the the first tweet. No projection just fact.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Its been on a decline for two reasons. The barriers that have been put up already. And the fact that Americans have had enough.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You literally have been calling me stupid from your first tweet to me no projection there.
@Team_Mitch @benshapiro Can anyone post a link to the bill that the passed? I can only find OP EDs on the subject and no source documents.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump And neither of those senerios actually proactively stop a person from crossing and will only deter a small portion. And does not take into financial consideration of all the support and bueracrate costs. So 5bil gets started and we can evaluate next year.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Adding drones military grade at 30k per hour to run and to have constant coverage is 4 on the low side. Is an additional 1billion annual cost on top of the 62 mil each to build them. Then you still have to factor in privacy concerns.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Federal BP a make 94,613 per year top level and 35,423  low level. My estimate of effective patrol area is 100 miles (2 hrs each way / 4 passes a day ). That puts the need for 200 agents in an 8 hour shift. 600 per day. Taking a conservative average 60k x 600 is 32mil base salary
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump If a wall stopped half of those expected to successfully enter illegally without going through a port of entry at the southern border over the next 10 years, it would save taxpayers nearly $64 billion — several times the wall’s cost.		Same report.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump costing $12 to $15 billion stopped or deterred between 160,000 and 200,000 illegal crossers — only about 9 to 12 percent of those expected to successfully cross in the next decade — it would pay for itself. -- Center for immigration studies testimony before Congress.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump and Medicine (NAS) for immigrants by education level. Based on the NAS data, illegal border-crossers create an average net fiscal burden (taxes paid minus services used) of approximately $74,722 during their lifetimes — excluding costs for their U.S.-born children. If a wall
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump savings from having fewer illegal immigrants in the country would be sufficient to cover the costs of the wall. This analysis takes the likely education level of illegal border-crossers and applies fiscal estimates developed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump This testimony is based on a report published in February of this year by the Center for Immigration Studies. The findings of the report indicate that if a border wall stopped a small fraction of the illegal immigrants who are expected to come in the next decade, the fiscal ...
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I will admit that all of Congress and the executive branch are at fault for us getting to this point. Both budget and lack of bipartisan immigration reforms and they need to get the government flowing again.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So from what I read. Homeland security says 21 billion and Democrats are the only ones saying 70 billion. And that is based largely on paying higher then average price for land. And only partially that they haven't finalized design.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I disagree. I see a fixed cost as reasonable over continuing to add government employee and there ever growing support staff. I wish it could be just more tech. I love tech but it just isn't there yet in my opinion. I like employing people but I don't like government employees.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Have not seen the 70 billion please cite source.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump We also compartmentalize sub categories and deal with them within there column of issue. That in this case is how we see the difference between the over stays and the ports and the wall and more agents and technology. They are all different issues to us.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Your answer is to do nothing there because it is not a big deal to you that people coming across and you make large assumptions based what the rest of us consider incomplete data.  We want a physical reassurance that that problem is taken care of then we move on to the next issue
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You like to talk down thinking you are the only one that can have an opinion and that the only side that's right is yours. You also forget that people from different backgrounds will fix the problem differently then you.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump No like most of the people on your side you like to bring other items into the conversation trying to compare them invalidly or draw an emotional ploy to manipulate the argument. You think your so smart and Pat yourself  on the back that you look pasted the original issue.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump 2/2  the conservative annual budget is 4.407 trillion. Not that I am just happy about spending 50billion but I want a start.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump 1) visa is not a border issue it is an immagration issue. It is a false narrative to combine the two. 	2) BP not having to as frequently active monitoring wall means they can be ports. 	3) do you realize even at it most expensive estimate I have it is 50 billion one time. 1/2
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I am not wrong. I am just through repeating myself.  Great you feel you are so smart.  65% does not include those that do not poll online because there is a huge silent majority that does not poll.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Good i definitely encourage community support. Keep it up. God bless.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump If you so choose. I have nothing to hide.  From you or the government. Anyways I must now go because i have other obligations.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I believe I mentioned donating money to groups of people that are involved in a civil war and orphanage that is caught in that. What have you done?
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump No more the fact that the president of my country is tagged on this post and I deal with legal and contract matters through proper channels and government agencies.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Do you? Because the compassion you show for those that have left there are hundreds more that did not and they have to live in. I offer support and encouragement to those that actually want to change their countries way of life.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump How have I defended it happening? Show me one statement that says I support governments causing harm to their people.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That I am not willing to discuss. Thank you for your interest.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Did I say even once that I wanted them to die? Do not put words in my mouth!  I have a different opinion then you on how to handle the situation that is all.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.- 1Cor 4:3-4
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That really shows you may need to revisit the Word if you choose because "There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?" James 4:2
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Considering I have had sit down meetings with communication infrastructure directors (and in the case of one country the general above him. ) Of three central American countries. I am not at a loss of the government officials. Again you assume to much.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump " I will absolutely judge you by what true faith demands" - was your statement not mine. I am not condeming you but I am citing scripture that you judging me is against scripture. If you are trying to use your opinion of my personal faith as a club to beat me with.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump However I feel that if you could cite the information specificly then you would have by now. Telling me that you can and not puts no value to your assertive statment
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You don't know anything. I have told you over and over that I will stand up to my government if you can site specific instances of government involved malicious economic or political destabilization of specific governments. Fact over opinion is all I am asking.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You have made all of the judgemental claims about me and my relationship with God. I do not know your plank that is between you and God.  I am not judging the refugees and I challenge you to find anything in my statements that shows I did. You can love without enabling.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Being honest? Why do you consider my opinion dishonest?
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump your brother’s eye. “Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.	Matthew 7:1-6 NKJV
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?  Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye?  Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You have no authority to judge me and it is okay if you have an opinion.  “Judge  not, that you be not judged.  For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.  And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Okay you've officially lost the argument you are back to just insulting I thought for a minute that you were really trying to have an adult conversation and express your point of view and allow me to express my point of view and we can walk away still disagree if necessary.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You sir are making the claim even if I have the information to make a good debate you must be able to back up your claims on your own and site your claim on your own. It is not ignorance of history it is the opinionated interpretation of set history that is at debate.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Considering one of your earlier post that you are an atheist/agnostic how about you leave God out of the conversation as you are not skilled with a knowledge ofmy Bible or the basis to my religion since you reject it.  I know exactly how I stand with my God and my faith.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Simply put the original thread that it's racist to assume that only white or non Caucasian people are the only ones crossing the border still stands. Your opinion on how my government manages the refugee issue at our southern border is just that an opinion
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump So mr. Canadian you can save your opinionated judgments about my government for your coffee shop or Twitter conversations. Having fun at yelling at people over the internet. and making claims that you choose not to have the burden of proof to back up.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump And then the Wikipedia information shows historical interactions between military and fractions of people trying to overthrow or fix their governments but 0 facts on how it was an intentional destabilization of the country's economic infrastructure
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump And of course the first article that shows up was an f pinion article which is laced with facts of history interactions and their opinion on how they applied to the government's removing the responsibility off the governments themselves for their actions
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You have no idea what u do or don't know. You have provided know facts rather than juvenal insults to back up your claim that the u.s. intentionally destabilizes Nations south of our borders. To humor you I did a basic subject search engine search.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 And my physical measures I was referring to a vasectomy or tubes tied.  Not  the others because they are not physical they are chemical. But a condom is. Technically not. It is still a chemically created barrier.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I can live with that. Might I ask which country do you call home?
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump No I have read and understand plenty of history. I am not saying the US has not had a positive or negative impact on other countries but my disagreement is your claim that it was done intentionally to cause world problems. Latin or other wise.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump "I hope your children are better people than you." Funny thing is I know they will be because that is the way I raised them.  "I hope your grandchildren live in a world where than can forgive you" - Forgiveness from them is not necessary. I am not doing anything wrong.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 Yes and adding on to your claim not disputing it for the original OP that none of it is the employer's issue or responsibility.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You made the claim so in this case the burden of proof is on you.  …provide facts, evidence, and statistics to support your position. …provide reasons to support your claim…cite experts who agree with you
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I hope that I have taught my children the values they will pass to theirs and treat people with respect but not let anyone not event the government step on you.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Revolutions change governments. Yes people will die but it is the only way to fix improper greedy leadership in governments. To lie to yourself and say their is nothing you can do is wrong.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump No my country may have an issue but that's why it is a representative republic we will vote them out. Proof of actual intentional destabilization or it is conjecture.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump And minors with no parents I have no issue with them getting absolute first priority to be processed in the country.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Unless you have proof of that then I have to treat that as rumor and blaming the US. If you have proof I will stand up to my government and remind them it is not what we stand for.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I absolutely will because I know my heart and God does to. I also know that Jesus and that he died for my sins. I do not need to donate to get me out of hell. I donate because in this case I know the people and the people running the orphanage.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump If the government here was to turn to tyranny then I would be right there to fight to change it and give my life if that was what was sent to be.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I am absolutely not saying go home and die. I am saying go home and fight!! Fight for your children! Fight for your home land! Be a leader in a movement to make a change!
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump God knows my heart and I know where I stand with him. I do not need to justify that with you.  And you have no idea whom I support abrode. I have sent money to people in the mix of a civil war because that is what I believe. This also includes children that are orphans.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Do not equate my wanting to fix the root problem or understanding that the people in the countries are the only ones who can fix their countries to being actively wanting them to suffer. But I do expect them to follow the law even when the law says no.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Wrong of you to assume my education just because my views differ from yours. The US doesn't keep them unstable if you have links to specific examples I will stand with you to the US representatives and help make them stop. Same goes for actual racism.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I do not want anyone to suffer there or anywhere in the wall but I look at the root of the problem not the symptoms.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Immigration and refuge asylum are two different subjects. You want to immigrate do it through channels and do it right and those that do are more productive. Those that don't are not.  Asylum should only ever be temporary. Sometimes the answer is no and you have to deal with it.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump The governments at all of these places are the ones that cause the problems and they have to be fixed. And outside pressure sometimes helps it normally squeezes the ones who need the most help.  People from within are the only ones who can change their country.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I am not uncompassionate to their plight but enabling people to run from their problems doesn't truly help them, their family or those they left behind. And like the race card the asylum card is being used as a "get out of jail free" card.  I would rather lean on the governments
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I don't care their race! Period. Race card declined. Nor do I care where they come from or what is happening in their home countries because I am of the mind set that until a enough people stand up governments don't change. Natural Disasters are the only exceptions.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump "Did you know that they're blocking people from claiming asylum?" fixed it for you to make it an adult conversation.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Yes because it is not guaranteed to anyone. And only applicable to the next border crossed that accepts refuges by the 1951 treaty continued into the 1968 ratification.  On top of that they are required to follow our laws period.
@RepAnnieKuster @SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi and every Senator is just as at fault for this as the president. Get it together or we are going to remember this at election time and to use a quote from someone else  "your fired"
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump The OP called Trump racist when you can not prove their race of an person choosing to illegally cross the boarder is a particular race or even an assumption of race. As far as their problems they still need to enter the nation properly because it is the law. Bad situation!=asylum
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Oh and by all means I will pray for you and your love of Satan. Accept it or not is up to you. God bless you I hope you don't have to learn near the hard lessons that I did growing up.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump More insults. Nothing valid to say because  you know people implying that Trump or any other white male is racist because of border security is really inflecting their own racism on to the subject. Grow up with the insults. I would hope you are better then that.
@Kokomothegreat @realDonaldTrump And your response is really mature yourself. Hypocrite.
@CheerioHerio @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Can you invalidate anything I said or is your intelligence and rebuttal limited to insults?
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 If you absolutely can not deal  with kids then make the changes or don't have intercourse. Not required to live or even have an orgasm.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 To continue I was responsible and did what I needed to make sure no more kids even the unexpected ones could happen.  But again NOT my employers issue. Mine and my wife's that's it. Want to have sex = you might get pregnant unless Physical measures are taken.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 Absolutely not but it is completely their responsibility's if for whatever reason they get pregnant. Not the employers issue.  And not to be taken out on the baby.  I have 4 kids. Planned all but the first and last one.  Even though inconvenient at the time. The are awesome.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 Great that right it is health care. Not an employer issue. So in my opinion NO company should have to pay for ANY of them ever regardless of the religious leanings of the owners of the company.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump It is also racist for you to assume and imply that all the murders and drug trafficking that comes in from the southern border is committed by non white races.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump It's racist for you to assuming that only non white races will break the law and enter our country illegally. It's racist of you to assume because Trump is white that he has a problem with non white people.  Legal status has nothing to do with race.
@LuluFrenche @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Not a Presidential issue. Contact your insurance company they set the prices.
@mermaidfaggotry @mirsam2005 @jnd4588 @kylegriffin1 Controlling yourself by abstaining. 💯. Taking responsibility for yourself and pregnancy while not abstaining is 💯 not the employers problem.
@SaxonThegn @djrothkopf @peterdaou @AriFleischer Foreign investors should always be required to partner with a citizen of the USA so no foreign entity can own land. The slope is too slippery to allow even the local elected dog catcher to be voted on by a non citizen. If you do what's the point of being a citizen?
@adzesband @AriFleischer Insults person's appearance. Very tolerant and progressive of you. Hypocrite.
@joer138 @RandyFeenstra @benshapiro Racist and sexist of you to say. You want people to stop judging by skin color or sex or sexual preference? You stop also.
@iLLWiLLTHEMiCK @RandyFeenstra California is so poorly run that they out of every state in the union owe my friends company 22 million for the free cell phone contracts and they tried to not to pay them at all!
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Anyways Dark angel I am through wasting my time on you. Enjoy your life.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Overstay Visas = ICE problem. Different subject. Wall stands in place 24/7 every day in all weather with a fixed cost. BP is an ever expanding annual expense and includes all the support people on top of the actual agents. Why can people not understand this simple logic?
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Yes 24/7 but they can not and never will be able to effectively patrol a 2000 mile border. It just is not logistically possible.  Try as the may. Really it doesn't matter if it is 10 per day or 10000 per day it has to stop.  Every country has it's border protected. Why can't we!!
@SaxonThegn @djrothkopf @peterdaou @AriFleischer It is very simple. If you are not a citizen of the USA you should not be able to vote or own property in the USA.  And if you are a US citizen but not a State citizen you should only have the right to vote at your home state / city. Nothing racist about it.
@RepDianaDeGette @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Build the wall. It is 1% of the amount you people representing the American people spent on stupid non productive research grants.
RT @BenShapQuotes: https://t.co/CH5PrYHPKB
@MasengCarmel @WhiteHouse I am sorry I have known several farms go away because the next of kin could pay the estate tax on the property. So yes DT kids might benefit some day but so will millions of Americans who deal with this. Can you stupid people please put your pitch forks away. #WitchHunt
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump BP yes some more needed. They can not be everywhere along the border standing there waiting for people to cross. That is not feasible. The solution is a barrier that is there 24/7 and then you can add the technology which is still largly reactive to alert the BP of a border cross
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You have no valid data to back that up. 19mil did not come through the ports of entry and not all of the remaining precentage  came from over stay visa like we discussed is a different subject completely. ICE can deal with them.
@ChecklistGone @WhiteHouse @ICEgov Do you support more agents on the border?
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends How about you two brothers do something productive with your time. Lean on your reps as hard as you are on the president to be in their office coming up with away to end this. Not some stupid offer but a real one. Or just approved it and take it from the other bloat in budget.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Come on people you really have to admit all of or representatives should be in Washington DC dealing with this. Head down buckle down get to work because we the people you represent will fire you all. #fixorgetfired
RT @RealCandaceO: LOL!!		I’m a daughter of a high school dropout. I began my life in a low-income housing structure, sharing a bunkbed with…
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump As far as the waiting list is what you get it doesn't matter if it is 10 days or 10years it doesn't validate crossing illegally. Doesn't mean that people don't have a heart for them but there is a process and that doesn't negate the need of the wall.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump The funnel points should encourage them to do it the right way! Through a port of entry. If you pass over the boarder illegally you are not looking for asylum.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump My biggest point here is you can not staff the 1954 miles 24/7 with board patrol. It is not feasible and BP agents are an ever increasing annual cost. A wall is not. It has a fixed cost of installation and can have a capped cost of maintenance.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Hey great walls work. So great of you to admit that.  In kind I will admit and am willing to support immagration reform. 5billion to keep things moving and reopens the government and moves on.
@DumboRat4000 @kennwatley @SpeakerPelosi Riots and a mob were attempting to force their way into our country. Tear gas was mercy.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Then what will be there in place the entire length 24/7 to keep people out that can't just be cut through with a $12 pair of bolt cutters? What do you think should go there to protect the sovereignty of the nation?
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump We agree there we don't know none of us on either side of this issue. Because there could be people crossing every hour and we just don't know. Does that mean no action should be taken?
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Asylum is not guaranteed and per international treaties only valid at the next country to the country they are leaving. Asylum can also be temporary only. Asylum is also being abused as a get out of jail free card.
@WhatDoesMatter9 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Question what technology do you really think is going to keep people out? Drones? Cameras? Who manages this? Military? Does this technology actually stop a person? More BP ok great. More annual pay and benefits for them and all the support people for them. Well more thenawall24/7
@woopwoopjkftp @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You might be fried right now but stay on topic we are talking about the shutdown not your goat weed.
RT @jcoh11: @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Would you please act like the adult in the room and give him his wall in exchange for something…
@serfspodcast @RealCandaceO @AOC Capitalism is literally responsible for every technology break through you enjoy! So get bent.
@ManMadeMoon You all suck. And if these are real feelings you should be ashamed. My kids are awesome and I let them know it everyday. And as a father I hug and encourage them. I pray for all of your children.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah because everyone on here is privey to the secret classified information and knows exactly how to perfectly handle every situation ever in their lives. Let throw stones at Trump or any  leader when 99% of you couldn't do it at all. Insults is all you have.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Can you admit at least it is an attempt to finally push through something we have been talking about for over 30 years with no solution.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Ok I will meet you halfway on this. I believe a large fence would be a good start but not as effective. And honestly we don't really know the true stats because that would imply we have caught and detainded all of them.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So using that logic if they want things to change they must convenience people why. Not run from it and expect that the place you are running to to welcome you in with open arms singing hallelujah. I am sorry IMO people that run are leaving the problem for someone else.
@kennwatley @SpeakerPelosi Then they would be at risk for sanctions and UN intervention for interfering with a sovern nation's security.  Walls work for those "good people" that want to break laws to better their own lives.  A thief just wants to better his life at the expense of yours. Difference?
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Untill the people in the countries  stand up and say enough is an enough will things change. All the benefits from US to them does a trickle down benefiting the ones that are in power.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity One of my favorite movies. Later
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity It is not like you see in movies with drones chasing people down and police following. I am sorry it just isn't.  A wall is the basic technology to get the job done. They can add technology to the wall to make it even better.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity I understand that but the alternative in my permission is not proactive enough.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Anyways I have to go for now.  Feel free to ask another question just might be a while before I respond.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity That's where I would hope you would hold your representatives to the fire as much as I hold mine. Trump does understand budgets with business but even he could do better.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Trust me I want that also. But the current .001% is the current issue.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity No because it is there when the BP and drones are not. Really you can not be this dense. You have asked good questions to follow it up with something as stupid as this and pretending not understanding the Basic function of a wall.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity These questions are asked and answered all over the place and yes asked and answered by the people doing the actual jobs instead of people that just like to tear an idea down because they think they are the smartest person in the room.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Congress does not do budgets very well. Everyone is allowed to just keep increasing their portions of the budget.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Oh my goodness seriously.  Yes to spell it out a regular guard would have to go down the the wall either with a drone or by patrol just not as frequently on patrol.  Do you really think any one thinks you just put up a wall and for get about it?
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity More "what about" issues when talking about the drugs at the port of entries. That is where the BP and the technology could be best utilized and honestly it should be a half mile long tunnel instead of a gate.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Tunnels take time and not the random person is going to be able to do it successful. Walking across a fence is easy. Again with the ladder. The average person that could normally walk over not going to be able to do it.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity We have been talking in Congress for 20+ years about this. On both sides of the isles and have finally someone making a real issue about it and he now knows more they we John q public ever will being in the meetings he is in. Budgets matter and Congress sucks them.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity " What about" arguments are old. Over stays are an ICE/FBI issue and a different subject. The wall would stop them so the BP would not have to put their lives on the line to chase them down. Again technology even from your own statement is reactive. You can't have drones 24/7
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Like it some good points.  He's right the companies should higher engineers and contact environmental impact scientist. However the tired old line of they can get a 32 foot ladder is old. You can't from the top move a ladder of that weight over the wall. 3 story fall sucks.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity It keeps the people from just crossing with ATVs or even just walking.  Makes them more visible if the have to try and go over but ultimately keep them out. but it's ok what's your address and I will tell my BP friends to send them to your house.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Technology it great but almost purely reactive. Great pictures of people crossing the boarder. Then what? They still going to be there then the BP is 100 miles away?  I am all for technology with the wall with the BP agents. Use all the tools available.
@1followernodad @netflix I am sure it is good and appealing for some but I did not appreciate having it as the promoted program when I turned on Netflix to auto play and old lady talking about masterbation. So Netflix let's keep in mind that TV-ma or the like may not be appropriate to just auto play.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Because a wall / fence protects and defines property when it is not manned. You know that was the point and you are playing games with the word. Are you going to pay all the salaries and benefits for not only the BP but all the support people ? 1:10ft? 1:10miles? 1:100miles?
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Yeah yeah split the words when you know exactly what I was talking about. Deflect defelct deflect
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity Lol ok I laughed at that. Still think we need the wall so we can have the BP doing more effective work then patrolling vast areas of unprotected land.
@SmokiestLemming @seanhannity So. Do you not fix a leak in your house if it is still dripping?
@MrsAnnyG @GOP Absolutely should be walled and everyone that is for it wants it applied there too. However there are more improperly ran countries south of us so they have the most citizens fleeing. Fleeing instead of standing up to their government.
@Clay_c1965 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I agree with this in principle. However all of Congress has failed us. @gop and @dnc.  Both of you groups get off your arse and put something together that is not an insult.
@CW2_FP @GOP Like what? What is more important then security? Hmm ? Hand outs to people that continue to make bad choices? Wait people are poor because the rich make them poor. Maybe they just don't make the decision not to be.
@LenoraMesibov @GOP So what's your answer? Adding more BP agents? Who have salaries and benefits. Then the bueracrate support people to mange them with more salaries and benefits? The ever increasing amount of workers that depend on the government? Who pays for that? Annually?
@MrsAnnyG @GOP So? Do you have the stats of the people that just walk across in areas not protected by a wall? Technically no one does because is can't been calculated. Also standard  people don't build tunnels. Walls work so the BP can spend time finding the tunnels.

@JimKilbane @realDonaldTrump Because you were a nomadic people that had not established government or rule of law. Or show of ownership on the land.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I have put a lot of thought into it and it could even help get honest people to come forward and get right with the law. Or if they are caught they are sent here with an option to bring their family and they get first priority processing if they have a clean record here.
@NetflixIsAJoke @netflix Yeah because when I turn on my Netflix I completely need to hear some British woman talking about masterbation.  If it is TV -MA it should not be premoted on the opening screen!!!
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I agree with you the immigration laws need to be changed. But like it or not sometimes the answer is NO or not now. Just because you are breathing and want to come to the country doesn't mean you just get to. They have every way to make a good life in their home countries.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump More personnel is more salaries of not only them but support personal. Plus benefits. A wall helps it just sits there and only costs maintenance which should be bid out each and every time to get the best deal. Technology is reactive only at this point. Wall is proactive.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Nice copy and paste oh and very professional from a business man.
@babstheshopper @JudgeJeanine Seriously sick of the race card being used. How is this wall racist? There are people of several races that have the ability to do it. Are you saying only one race has the ability to follow the laws of a sovereign Nation? If so that is pretty racist of you.

@ClosC1 @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Lives are impacted no matter what the deal is. This is a larger scale yes but it is the same none the less. So what would you do if someone was trying to hold you hostage by using the emotional needs of people you never met with a budget? You would give in. People will get paid
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So your answer is to do nothing? Just to welcome everyone in open arms and flood our boarders with people that do not respect out laws. To immigrate the proper way regardless of how hard it is. It takes strength of character to do it right.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Upkeep is far cheaper then thousands of peoples salaries and the support people salaries that they have to have. Even if it is 10 times the amount it is projected that is still 1-2% of the total ever increase in budget.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump No give me a break. No government in the world no matter how bad it is can stand up to the collective will of it's people.  Some will die but if they push together they will change them or remove them. But yes some will die.
@ClosC1 @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Sometimes you have to walk away from a deal to let them know you are serious.
@EmperorKhaleesi @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump You know Congress has had the time to do this well before the shutdown also.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I do have a fix though. A few thousand acres given up from both countries on the border. Create a sanctuary City that is walled off on both sides that can dorm (not house) a finite 10000 people. No cars, 4 cafeterias and office spaces for government workers. They stay there.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump More patrols means more annual costs.  A wall doesn't require to be fed or health benefits. Doesn't need someone to cover for it when it's kid is sick.  More patrols = more taxes annually. So wall is my vote.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump 11-19 million illegal people depending on which ever report you listen to. Just because your roof leaks a little less does that mean you don't fix it? These same people can fix their home countries. They have every way to stand up to their leaders just like you are to yours.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Yes we need more BP and to use them more efficiently not driving over vast spaces as frequently. There should be a wall on the north but again there are more poorly ran countries south of us.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Ok let me make this as simple as possible. Not having to patrol large vasts of land allows more effort and action at the ports.  The wall is only part of the plan. A place to start that makes a visiable statement to stop and go through a port.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump The time is the time it takes they don't get to live here untill it happens. That defeats the purpose.
@RolfBachmann @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Hey sometimes the answer to asylum is NO! And guess what you don't get to live here while we make the decision. You stay in your home countries!
@PegandpauljPaul @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld And like I have said over and over. He never meant they would write a check !!!!! Tarriffs / economy based transactions pay for the wall!!!
@PegandpauljPaul @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld So Trump's translators based on a hateful spin.  1) ladders it is a three story wall. Feel like you can jump from the third floor safely? 2) tunnels - BP not worrying about large gaps of land to patrol allows them to concentrate on finding tunnels with technology.
@MarchandJanet @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Will you people not stop and repeating the same old crap. All of us that you thought about it realized he never meant they would write a check. Tarriffs and other negotiations are paying the economy back. Which in turn pays for the wall.
RT @GenevaCHenders1: @RepScottPeters @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Fine! Put more agents and security at ports of entry. But the problem…
@joy_afi @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke I did read the article. It is an OP ED based on cherry picked data on one subject. Learn to differentiate the two subjects. There is a large group of people who caravaned up here to seek a better life. Hence draws attention to all the other data and causes notice to a crisis. Bye
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump They do apply equally at the northern boarder. However there are more impoverished countries south of us that cause the need for more immediate measures there. However if you are an illegal Canadian your but gets deported also. Race or nationality has nothing to do with it.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Trump does understand it but let me simplify it. 1.) Asylum is the next stable government of the border you cross. 	2.) Asylum has to be approved by the government. 	3.) If it is not done at a port of entry it is illegal 	4.) Sometimes the answer is no
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Time is an option. It is a lie that it isn't they have no more guarantee of a life change here as they do in thier home countries
@joy_afi @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Oh and I love how people forget that articles like this are opinions not news and not thought out plans.
@joy_afi @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Hey um stay on subject here. Legalized Mary Jane is a different subject. Has nothing to do with the immoral choice to actively defy a nation's borders or laws.
@joy_afi @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Haha I love this argument. "What about tunnels." If the boarder patrol has to not worry about the broken fence line or open spaces then they can spend more time finding tunnels and using technology to secure the boarder. #triage do what you can to stop the bleeding thendo therest
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I welcome all immigrants that does it the right way. Even into my home. I support people making a better life.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I do however agree that the laws in place could be worked on so we have to work with our Congress to fix it. Still does not justify crossing illegally.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump And just because it takes a long time does not justify doing it the wrong way.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It has nothing to do with race. I would shoot a person crossing my fence that is properly marked no tresspassing reguardless of race or gender well before they can get close enough to threaten me or my family.
@joy_afi @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Walls deter people from walking in your house and getting in bed. Moral people that is. So if a wall doesn't work at the boarder it says alot about the morals of the people comming. And the people could fix their home countries and quit blaming their problems on us.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Do you really think that matters? Quite using the "what about" argument. Fact if the people were not here illegally then the crime they committed would not happen. Fact the funds to deal with said law breaker from the police to the paper pushing bueracrate would not be spent.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You are pretty done for a Dr.   People's choices get them in the situation they are in. They have every opportunity to get themselves right with the law and choose not to. So guess what they are in prison.  Emotional string you pulled. Yeah that's cut now.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Your @ring doorbell can alert you to people being at your house but the locked door discourages people from just walking in and living there.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke Here is the thing technology is great. But largely it is reactive when applied. It doesn't proactively deter people from crossing a designated area of border wether it on the US border or your own back yard.
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump When it down to it if the people comming to the boarder were good people they would come to the entry points and follow the law. They do not have the right to come to the USA just because they feel like it. Follow the law and do it right. Then people like me will welcome you home
@DarkAngelAW1986 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump When do you determine the threat when they cross your border or when they have the gun shoved in your face? 2A allows me to assess the threat to myself and my property and my sovereign Nation.

The wall stops those comming across land so the officers can then spend their time locating tunnels. As far as ports and such that is what we have the DEA, FBI and Coast Guard.  #triage
@LamagiaSmith @GuyCreal @jeffqv @SpeakerPelosi You are a fool if you think Mexico was going to write a check. He has always meant in trade and tariffs.
@RussPalmer @realDonaldTrump Tell your representatives also. They have just as much power to end this.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Your an idiot you are reading into his personality what you want to. there is no basis of the stuff you described here.
@InterestedDutch @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot. The amount that you state can be passed between slats or over the fence is minute based on what can run over with old cars or dune buggies or ATVs. Which a wall will stop. Like I have said before the wall is the first part of the triage to help fix the USA.
@realDailyWire Simply put it you follows Jesus commandment to Love above all and love him you will not be able to break the ten commandments.
@solace1952 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer When the people actually working the wall are begging for it not funding the wall is not funding security.  The wall is a stop gap so we can then use other technology. First rule of triage is to stop the bleeding on the worst visible wound. In this case our southern boarders

@CBSEveningNews So more regulation more government oversight. More wasted tax payer money because they have the ear to someone who writes the laws. You are also limiting the companies rights to advertise within a mediums that gets them response.

@realDonaldTrump we the people understand that the wall is just one part of the plan to fix the security of America. First aid on a hemraging wound. #BuildTheWall

@BipiddyBoo @HowellJanie @jdawsey1 @realDonaldTrump Maybe you don't understand first aid. You fix the area that you can see is bleeding the most first then you move to the next issue. Here the wall may not be the final fix but will stop/slow the bleeding there.

@TheCW @realDonaldTrump This is the media brainwashing by associative imagery no different than product placement on the screen. Your writers are associating Nazism with Oklahomans in the mind of the people watching. @JimInhofe @GovMaryFallin Is this how Hollywood should be? https://t.co/ZWc6chRdLX
