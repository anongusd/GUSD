Opinion | Trump got played by Kim Jong Un ‚Äî again https://t.co/Ad3ez3eKdp  This is a good read.
@chasbottom One judge I knew, beat up his girlfriend in a hotel room in Carmel, CA.  He almost lost hid judgeship.  Now, he would have lost his position.  Things are slowly improving.
@chasbottom I've known some fine lawyers, as I used to work as a paralegal. On the other hand, there are corrupt attys, as well as judges.  I also knew them.
@chasbottom You can't be surprised that Trump hired shady-type Michael Cohen.  He worked for him for 10 years!
@chasbottom Dean's name was invoked at the start of the hearing.  Why not ask him?
How much Provigil has Trump taken tonight to stay up, tweet from Hanoi and watch Cohen testimony?  #oodles
I read Cohen's opening statement but it's far more powerful rhetoric, as recited orally.
@chasbottom I turned it off.  But of course, the one hour I watch. . . ü§Æ
.@DonnyDeutsch why in the hell are you friends with a grifter/con-artist and fraud like Michael Cohen?
@chasbottom How about if you're not a criminal, don't work for free and endorse Russia?
@chasbottom But Trump sycophants are mainly going to prison.  That has to upset you. Or am I reading you wrong?
@chasbottom He was in charge of the Trump campaign.  Why no vetting?  I can't stand Trump, but not interested in impeachment. I just find Trump's hangers on (is that a real phrase?). I'm well aware you're not a Trumper but why not rail against his Rogue's Gallery?
@KimH1313 @Danish49755110 @alanhe @lrozen Indeed. Keeping my fingers crossed.
@Danish49755110 @alanhe @lrozen But we need 4.  Who else will come on board?
@Danish49755110 @alanhe @lrozen Thank you for the update.
@PhilipRucker @kylieatwood @Kevinliptakcnn Trump is beyond ignorant.  All he knows is flattery.  I want to ü§Æ
@alanhe @lrozen So, there are 2.  Do you see any more defections?
The Trump love affair with Kim Jong Un is really bizarre. I know it's an often used trope but what if Obama said he were in love with Kim or any other dictator? #impeachment
@lizzieohreally She's my imaginary best friend for all things.
@chasbottom Not me.  But get real. Manafort's crimes are blatant. I know you're not a big Trump fan, so why do you ignore the obvious?  He claimed he knew only the best people.  Come on.  There's no way you believe that.
@chasbottom He surrounded himself with felons and thugs. And we don't know what SDNY knows or about new claims from Cohen.
@chasbottom Rogue's Gallery of criminals - a few		3/7/19: Paul Manafort sentencing in EDVA case		3/13/19: Paul Manafort sentencing in DC case		3/13/19: Michael Flynn status report due		3/14/19: Roger Stone status conference. Trial date likely to be set.		3/15/19: Rick Gates status report due
@chasbottom I didn't say his admin. Why are you twisting my words?
@chasbottom You seem shocked.  üòÇ
You'd think the White House &amp; @PressSec would have some shame, given the rogue's gallery of criminals who surrounded Trump.
@atrupar I hate to be superficial and/or rude but that boxy suit of Trump's is making him look even tubbier.
@yashar You have a lot of love from followers.
@nycjim Kindly, what is it that Trump understands?
@nycsouthpaw That's the typical deflection.  Trump also says that.
@AdamParkhomenko @ddale8 Trump wears reading glasses.  Yet, we never see him wear them.  It's all part of his narcissism.
@GottaLaff It‚Äôs ok. We know how you feel.
@GottaLaff I loved it.
@GottaLaff One hopes.  This is a racist stereotype from the 1950's.  And yet, Trump claims Spike Lee was being racist.
@thegarance @nycjim .Why does Trump have to try and ruin everything?
@chrislhayes Let's be honest.  She's a moron.
@chasbottom watch/read this.  It's chilling. https://t.co/OL1ugD9qmA
@atrupar How is that a success?
@chasbottom Income inequality &amp; a large homeless population. They gravitate to SF b/c the weather is moderate.
@chasbottom I don't live there.
@chasbottom The article I posted has nothing to do with tv. Are you OK?
@postpolitics .@PressSec is obfuscating and at best, delusional.
@chasbottom I've never fainted.  Although, I understand right wing snowflakes often do.
"And so it has come to this: Europeans now see themselves as stewards of a vision of American leadership in the world that America‚Äôs leader no longer subscribes to."  The America we love, no longer exists. https://t.co/TEfYB2WXUD
@atrupar .Let's ask Trump about the Central Park Five as winners.
@yashar Some people, have way too much time on their hands.
@RamonasVoices @allinwithchris @chrislhayes @SenSanders I feel the same way.  It's a visceral reaction, a complete disdain for the man. I almost feel guilty but no, I could never vote for him.
Build Your Own ‚ÄòMedicare for All‚Äô Plan. Beware: There Are Tough Choices. https://t.co/c6WTdhD5Iw via @UpshotNYT
@chasbottom I think his career may be over. And rightly so. But again, I don't understand the motivation. Is the guy mentally ill? I've already spent too much thinking about this. üòÇüòÇ
@eugenegu And nurses. You're always supportive of my fellow Brothers &amp; Sisters in Scrubs. Thank you.
@chasbottom did you see the presser from CPD re: Smollett?  Well-placed anger. But this guy is never going to jail. I still don't understand how claiming to be a victim of a hate crime would be a huge payday.
@sam_vinograd @AshaRangappa_ I hope some of his friends turned him in after reading his violence-laden screeds.
@RichardEngel But the ideology behind IS remains. That's what is frightening.
@chasbottom I would hope so!! Thanks.
@maggieNYT Trump‚Äôs a coward.
@chasbottom They only charged him with disorderly conduct? What the heck?  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@lrozen @maddezmom @mrspanstreppon I eagerly await Cohen's testimonies, many of which will be  limited to written transcripts or leaks. How is it we've a reached a time where justice is subverted?
@lrozen @mrspanstreppon Oh, I see.  Thank you.
@lrozen @mrspanstreppon Will we ever learn the depths of Trump's corruption? Will these issues become paramount in #2020?  I fear not.
@chasbottom üíäüíâ None. But if my patients don‚Äôt get to sleep soon...üòâ
@chasbottom I‚Äôm passing meds.
@AshaRangappa_ @yashar @nadabakos I was surprised people don‚Äôt know about bath sheets. They‚Äôre a wonderful indulgence.
7 hours at work and I‚Äôm finally able to sit down for 10 minutes. #patientcare
@chasbottom Or elect a reality tv president.
@chasbottom I have a better one.  Don't hire Rudy Giuliani, ever. üòÇ
@chasbottom One crime, may lead to other crimes, as well as lying to authorities. You admit Cohen is an idiot. That idiot was Trump's personal lawyer for over 10 years. Ergo, Trump is also an idiot.
@chasbottom The article addresses the Cohen case, much of which is SDNY &amp; has nothing to do with Mueller.
Hey, Trump.  I'd vote for a centipede over you, any day.
@chasbottom Prove it.
@chasbottom I make no claim to be a legal expert or findings of clear and convincing obstruction.  However, the appearance of same, gives one pause.
@PrettyFootWoman I turn off the tv every time pundits bring up Sanders.
Who else is already sick of the #2020 election? Why do these campaigns begin so early?
@chasbottom Read the article.  The evidence of obstruction appears strong. I've always been against impeachment but I may rethink.
@peacebang Yes, I have those too.  They're great!

Everyone could see this coming. Except maybe, Simple Stone. https://t.co/61ympvZLyQ
@chasbottom Yep.
@chasbottom when he kept the rope around his neck on the way to the hospital I felt the story was a crock. I never tweeted abt it. I‚Äôm no fool. Well...üòâ
@chasbottom That‚Äôs the hot take. üòÇ
@yashar I'm with you about wash clothes.  Single use only. But I use mine to also gently exfoliate and remove makeup. I must own over 60.
@MSNBC @mitchellreports Yay!
@KirstenPowers Kudos, Kirsten.  But I haven't seen you as judgmental, instead a a reasonable arbiter. But you're wise to do what's necessary for your own personal growth.
@lrozen And we're supposed to take this administration seriously?  Talk about juvenile.
@MotherJones Why does the WH keep putting him out there?
@WestWingReport I need an omelette update. :)  After all, we're experiencing a national emergency.
@ThePlumLineGS @charlie_savage @DouthatNYT @LizaGoitein @BobbyChesney Bad faith is Trump's modus operandi.
@CillizzaCNN And there's still omelette bar time!
@GeorgeTakei A novel this convoluted would never be published.  Too fantastical. But that's the state of the Trump union.
@politicalwire He just rambles. . .
I love @SpeakerPelosi . Bright, wise and clever.  Surely again, Trump will be overwhelmed.  I couldn't be prouder. #NationalEmergency
@yashar So much needless drama.
Can someone please define "national emergency"?
Trump is a Drama King.
@chasbottom I see you're a humorist.  Or maybe, fabulist would be more accurate?
@TPM We'll tie Trump administration up in court for years! Yay!
@chasbottom Her points in the questioning of Abrams were important, but her overly contentious style lost me. Amy Klobuchar could have landed similar punches but with aplomb. Is that asking for too much?
@chasbottom Trump plays that game. New Congress members need to talk about policy, talk to media and not rely upon tweets. Not if they want to go anywhere.
@chasbottom Indeed. She also looks like nothing but an uneducated provocateur. Aren't there enough of those?
@chasbottom Someone is doing her one-sided homework. There's nothing wrong with confrontation but this is beyond the pale. It's sad she has no idea this is making her look crazy.
@chasbottom have you seen this? My gawd. This is horrible.  https://t.co/TcpNergqHY
@GottaLaff Pompeo and especially Bolton are frothing at the mouth for a war with Iran.  This is their fodder.
@RosieGray She needs to scrape the mold off Brexit and get to the bottom of what's right.
@RalstonReports You're a wonderful advocate for disabled, as well as a loving, accepting parent. Kudos.
https://t.co/ERBg1VJEhY  Per Trump, "only the best people".
@chasbottom She's a WH spokeswoman/counselor? üòÇ
@ianbremmer @USATODAY Trump should be forced to utilize a food bank.
@davidfolkenflik The sheer ignorance of this woman. . .
Just watched @mercedesschlapp on #CNN. She may be an even bigger fabulist/liar than @KellyannePolls
GOP politicians are infuriating, as all they do is coddle &amp; fawn over a childish and negligent Trump.
@GottaLaff I've seen little or no cable coverage on this topic. But, I work &amp; can't be sure. Do you know if this message is getting across?
@AllenMcDuffee Jesus is a fantasy.
@TPM Who still gives a damn what he thinks?
@OneLegSandpiper He's an ASMR genius.  It's why we love our pets. Calming.
@mmurraypolitics .The MAGA hats will be there as this a campaign rally.  It's certainly not reflective of the state.
@OneLegSandpiper He's doing a great job. What a sweetie.  Is that called executive time?
@markknoller @SecPompeo So much for freedom in Hungary. Even Fox is reporting this:  https://t.co/RkO24nS2vL
@lrozen I didn't know a law firm that worked with Manafort was fined such a large amount.  I learn something new from you everyday. Thanks.
@alivitali Good. üòâ
@yashar I love the little scalp fuzz.
@kenolin1 Be pleased he doesn't have a dog. He's probably abuse it.
Can someone please give @alivitali a hat? #MSNBC #cold #snow
@chasbottom You can have all the conservative ideas you choose. I'm not here to judge. My neighbors are conservatives &amp; we're great friends. However, I believe Trump is a sociopath. I will never let up on him.
@chasbottom Whatever.  But Trump is evil and most likely a criminal.  I'll get the last laugh.
@RonBrownstein Thank you for reminding everyone of Trump's condemnation of Central Park 5. Not to mention birtherism, which oddly, seems no longer important.  :(
@chasbottom Indeed.
@chasbottom It's all very absurd and lengthy.  Do other countries have these protracted elections?
@chasbottom Is it wrong that I don't care?  Wake me up in a year.
@chasbottom  I refuse to back anyone. Give me at least another 12 months. By then, maybe they'll all be in prison. üòÇ
@chasbottom There's no reason for people to run for POTUS 20 months ahead of an election.  Talk about crazy.
@Yamiche .Trump is running scared.
@chasbottom One state solution?  Huh?  Do you know what you're voting for? Frankly, I doubt it.
Read this. https://t.co/X67f3bnoyF
@chasbottom There's something wrong with US citizens voting?
Yes. https://t.co/wmkoSJO70M
@chasbottom Standard bearers?  They're crap disturbers.  Surely, you must see that.
@chasbottom Balance of power has shifted.  It's about time.  Get used to it.
There is no better example as to why why Dems now hold power and insist on oversight. #WhitakerHearing
I think Whitaker wants to to body wrestle @RepJerryNadler.  He's not going to win.  #WhitakerHearing  Brains always win.
@bobcesca_go What a total arse.
@GottaLaff I'm really pleased cable news is covering this.
@chasbottom Finally, Congress has oversight.  You should be pleased.
@stealthbadger I thought Cindy McCain was in charge of human trafficking.  :)
I hope media are fact-checking #Whitaker
Remember to vote for Dems in 2020.  Thank you Congress for your oversight.  #Whitaker
@brianstelter .AMI looks horrible.  But please tell me, who reads the National Enquirer?  I'd really like to know the demographics.
@TPM No one should be physically threatened but why did Conway stick around for 10 minutes, listening to a woman's complaints? Doesn't really make sense.
@NorahODonnell @AdrianneHaslet What a heroine.  I wish her all the best and the ability to run another marathon.
Poor Anderson @AC360 He's having a difficult time saying d*ck pic.  I don't blame him.  I don't even tweet that stuff.  #CNN
AMI/National Enquirer is real journalism?  They're a tawdry outlet. I've had it with people calling AMI journalism.
@foodwishes Or be BFF's with someone named Pecker.
Extortion is illegal. But I have a difficult time finding sympathy for 2 extremely wealthy guys fighting in the public domain. Take it elsewhere. I'm not interested in your grievances.  #JeffBezos
I want to thank every voter who chose a  Dem in Nov. Finally, we have true Congressional oversight of that malignant narcissist, Trump. I won't be surprised to hear they find WH criminality.
@yashar @DSWT What a beautiful survivor!
@lizzieohreally Yes, I do. You're a good advocate for our furry friends.  Thank you.

@chasbottom I'm kinda a hard-liner on immigration.  Yes, believe it or not.  üòÇ
@chasbottom But he's in charge.  It has his name and he had to know those undocumented immigrants were working for him. Why didn't they use E-verify?  And only now, 2 years into his presidency they are finally doing so. Don't let him off the hook.
@chasbottom I can 'understand a stupid college freshman trying to dress up as a rapper, but a 25-year old medical school student?  But it's still bad.
@soledadobrien This isn't a difficult call.
@chasbottom I'm all for E-verify. Why didn't Trump use that at his golf courses?
@chasbottom you grew up in the South. What in the hell is wrong with Virginia? And during the 1980's why was black face popular? I'm asking seriously.
@chasbottom Yes, I'm a more a reliable narrator than anything Trump has to say.
@chasbottom They're running to ICE and hoping to be granted a way to stay, even if temporary. And numbers are down.
@chasbottom The border "crisis" is a hoax, perpetuated by Trump to get his grand wall.  I thought you knew that.
If Trump says "sex" one more time, I'm gonna hurl.  ü§Æ #SOTU
So much for Trump's #SOTU being uplifting. He's the new Debbie Downer.
Now, Trump's just making up crap.  #SOTU
@greenfield64 Trump still hasn't apologized about the Central Park Five.

I give credit to @SpeakerPelosi for being gracious. That's where she owns Trump. #SOTU

Well, Trump managed to button his jacket but his red tie is sticking out from under like a little tongue.  ü§Æ #SOTU

@ddale8 Trump's a charlatan. I think we can all agree on this.
@Political_Index There is the Puppy Bowl and just ignore the other.
@dpleasant I'd like to know why that is.  The Civil War still plays into their thinking? A lack of integration but that doesn't seem to be the case.  Talk about a tough nut to crack.
@dpleasant Thank you. Sometimes, I feel like I'm living in an alternative universe, having grown up in CA and also living in MA. But the US is changing and modeling progressive states.  It's about time.
@dpleasant You make a good point.  I've never lived in the South but were iconic racist memes that popular in 1984?
@atrupar .Calling Trump Doofus-In-Chief might get his attention and be more accurate.
@chasbottom People die from measles and boys can be left sterile from mumps.  Measles is one of the most deadly viruses in the world and most communicable.
@chasbottom I'm not Florence Nightingale and you've reached into the wrong century.  It's a small outbreak, statistically insignificant, mainly in S. CA due to poor hygiene.  I'm more concerned about babies born into wealth &amp; not receiving MMR.
@chasbottom I did?  Provide proof.
@MeetThePress I always thought there was a difference, but a small one.  Plus, never thought the GOP would be represented by a doofus like Trump.
@kylegriffin1 Trump WH messaging has always been in disarray. It's getting worse.
@chasbottom @Yamiche Yes.  A continuation of the Obama economy.
@Yamiche What a load of. . .
@Yamiche Ha?  There's nothing great about the Trump administration.  Some are going to prison or indicted.
@ddale8 ,Why didn't press ask Trump about the location of new wall building and how many miles it will or does include?  It's frustrating.
This is grotesque. https://t.co/SzgTeshOD8  They can be fed via IV/TPN and not be subjected to painful NG tube insertions/vomiting, etc.
@SabrinaSiddiqui Reading is difficult for Trump.
@atrupar Like a weirdo?  He is a weirdo.
So many lies from Trump.  Isn't everyone sick of him?
Trump is delusional claiming @SpeakerPelosi would want to build his wall.
@MollyJongFast What a disgusting man.
@PeterHamby Hot button? Those folks need to join the 21st century.
@dpleasant Lock Her Up.  üòÇ
@dpleasant Remember when Hillary did that and had the nerve to run for Potus?  What goes around. . .
Trump said Mexico would pay for his wall. Why doesn't media continue to criticize him on that refrain?
@chasbottom Where do you suggest people live?
@chasbottom I love your sense of humor.
No Trump Border Wall  I've voted Dem all my life.  Are you listening to me? @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris
@oliverdarcy But Wikileaks aren't important?  Only personal and mainly true info about Bezos?
Franklin Graham is delusional, denying Trump's continual lies.  #MSNBC

@atrupar So, why is Trump meeting again with Kim Jong-un?  I give up.
@IsItCotton @imillhiser Most "socialist" countries like Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, etc., have a private insurance supplemental. We should follow.
I will always be shocked that Roger Stone is only 66-years old.  I assume being a miscreant is aging.
@imillhiser Most people who have Medicare also have Medicare Advantage or other private supplemental insurance.  People are so uninformed about Medicare, it's crazy.
@ErikWemple @HallieJackson Is cable tv going overboard airing so much Roger Stone &amp; Jerome Corsi nonsense/bloviating?
I am so sick of seeing Roger Stone &amp; Jerome Corsi suck up so much time on cable tv. Bring back @BarackObama  Those were the good old days of decency.
@BrookeBCNN @LisaFranceCNN @RandiFurmanCNN I heard over and over about handsome Bundy. How gross.  I wanted to hear more from the victims' families.
@joshrogin Yet, Trump remains in love with Kim Jong-Un.
Remember the Obama presidency when WH aides weren't being indicted &amp; Roger Stone was just a stain on humanity? Same for Jerome Corsi.
@chasbottom Our state is doing just fine.  CA has a large surplus, unlike what Trump is doing- running huge debt and deficits.  How, as a conservative, can you support him &amp; his ridiculous tax cut for the wealthy?
@HeidiNBC I like her but putting on jammies after a long day at work, washing face and applying moisturizer isn't novel. Many older women (like myself) do the same thing.

@chasbottom it's nice you want to re-follow me. (Is that a thing?) ü§£ But, I'm still a progressive &amp; share my POV. Just warning that I may again offend you. But, I never make things personal. If I did so, my Glenn Beck loving neighbors wouldn't speak to me.
@chasbottom He‚Äôs a little man and tall for 18 mos. You must be doing something new. I‚Äôm at work. No changes here. Are you gearing up to vote Democratic in 2020?

Contrast and compare. @KamalaHarris is offering a positive message. We desperately need this. Not the message of negativity from Trump.
@DeanObeidallah Does he have a weird name for her yet? 3,2,1
That's my Senator @KamalaHarris.  Running for president. #2020 #patriot
@brianbeutler She reminds me of early Barack Obama.
.@KamalaHarris is offering a positive message, unlike. . . Trump.
She's bringing it.  Go @KamalaHarris
@joshtpm Is this stuff fueled by Bernie &amp; friends?
Remember when @BarackObama was president &amp; no one associated with the WH was indicted? Let alone having to hear from Stone, Cohen &amp; Manafort? Those were blissful days.
@AprilDRyan when is Trump's next annual physical exam? This month?
@nycsouthpaw Translation:  he's just like Trump.

@JRubinBlogger @CNNSotu @RickSantorum There is no real future in defending Trump.  How much is CNN paying Santorum to spew this nonsense?
@politicususa Let's hope.
@atrupar I think obvious to anyone with a brain and not named Stephen Miller.

@MattGertz Every toy I try to purchase for my baby grandson makes noises/ songs.  Enough already!
@krassenstein Kudos to Dems.  Always. I wish you'd stop supporting Bernie.  He's no Democrat!
@TheRickWilson Isn't Trump due for his annual physical exam? I suggest at his next exam, extensive cognitive testing and executive functioning assessments.  Someone in the press needs to ask @PressSec about the date of his next medical evaluation.
@DanaHoule Not to change the subject too much, but when is Trump's next annual physical exam &amp; report?  It should come do this month.
@KagroX Soon to be a Netflix doc.
For weeks, Dems told Trump to open the government &amp; then work on security issues. Meanwhile, federal workers suffered. Voters will remember this Trump debacle.
Where is @AnnCoulter?  Washing her hair in the toilet again or going for the gin bottle?
@dpleasant Finally, Dems have held firm.  I'm so proud. The last few days have been great.
@MWJ1231 He's dark.  I wouldn't doubt it.
That had to hurt, Trump.  Not eve $1.00 for your wall. We Dems won, @SpeakerPelosi won, you're the loser. On Apprentice, you would have been fired.
So far, no apology from Trump for shutting down the government and workers going without 2 paychecks.
Lies, lies and more lies from Trump.  Appeasing the base requires same.
@brianefallon As a lifelong Dem, I'm really encouraged.
This is just Trump trying to appease his base.
Remember when Trump was going to build a huge &amp; very tall cement wall across the Mexican border that would be so attractive, he'd put his name on it?
How many more indictments until Trump resigns? An ethical man would have done so months ago.
@digby56 She's his Good/Bad Mom who understands he's a sociopath and needs to be controlled.
It looks like this is going to be a great day for @SpeakerPelosi  I couldn't be more thrilled.
@JRubinBlogger I never understood that.  But, I live in the SF Bay Area and have always respected her strengths.
@Green_Footballs And it proves he's a crap negotiator.
@KellyO Not just back pay, but a bonus should be included.  I'm fine with my taxes going to that.
@lrozen Karma.
@lrozen He's a creep. I wish being the Father of the Birther movement was an indictable offense.
Trump, Stone and all the other liars, deviants &amp; criminals associated with the WH should be very afraid of @RepAdamSchiff.
@ianbremmer His hair transplants were also a bad idea. Where did he have them done? One of those S-hole countries Trump likes to talk about?
@imillhiser As in a real emergency.
@DanaHoule Roger Stone saw a way to advance his "career" &amp; grift.  Now, that would be a better headline.
@WestWingReport No wonder many people have huge credit card debt.  Wages need to increase and people must learn how to save. But, for many it's just not possible.
@PorettiRobert He looks better in spats.  :)

@Green_Footballs What in the hell took so long?
@JoshDorner Lock Him Up!
@GottaLaff No damn wall!  I have a nice life &amp; great job but I work too damn hard for my taxes to go to Trump wall boondoggle/vanity project.
There's something rotten in the House of Trump.  Actually, many things. https://t.co/ZdXhSXMnHV
I'm going out to dinner with friends tonight &amp; will receive my usual paycheck tomorrow. Tonight, I'm donating to help feed federal workers, who are going without food, let alone the small pleasures in life. @WCKitchen
@sfpelosi @AdamParkhomenko Holy hell.  I still do that dramatic pause and emphasis.  It works wonders with my ex-husband and 4 grown children.  :)
Dear @SpeakerPelosi @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein You represent me in CA.  NO funding for any wall, let alone a down payment.  This is a Trump sham. I work too hard for my taxes to be wasted. cc:  @SenSchumer
@davidfrum Best tweet.  You win the internet today.
@peterdaou Why doesn't he just live in a hotel?  Because it's all about ego.
@GavinNewsom Wilbur Ross should be forced to provide zero interest loans to each &amp; every furloughed worker.  Same for Trump.
Trump &amp; Wilbur Ross should be forced to provide zero interest loans to all furloughed federal employees.  That's at a minimum.
@ktumulty @GeorgeWill I too, had to look it up.  :)
@NBCNews My heart is breaking for that gentle little soul.  Condolences to his family and friends.  RIP dear one.
@DavidCornDC Trump ruins everything.  Fact check:  True.
Thank gawd I have to leave for work in a few minutes. Cable TV is horrible.
Media &amp; @chucktodd keep forgetting Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. Why keep normalizing this as a budget item?
@ZekeJMiller Hook them up to a polygraph.  They're lying.
@imillhiser That man has no spine. It's amazing he can walk and talk at the same time.

@nytimes His attorneys look like they're dressed by the Gotti family.
@owillis To be frank, I can't believe Dems are holding strong against Trump.  It's about time.
@LOLGOP Trump just wants tv time. Who woulda thunk?
@amyklobuchar She's so out-of-touch.  Much like her father-in-law.
@LisaDNews Trump needs an audience.  End of story.
Trump: Give a SOTU when government is open.  I stand with @SpeakerPelosi and I'm hardly a radical.
@GottaLaff My dad is 91, my mom 89.  They've been Democrats all their lives.  They're hardly radicals.  They support @SpeakerPelosi as do I.  Trump is delusional.
@Yamiche My dad is 91 and my mom 89.  They've been Democrats all their lives.  They support @SpeakerPelosi  I wouldn't call them radicals.  Or myself.
@bobcesca_go Cohen's testimony was going to be my Valentine's gift to myself.  Dang!
@Joy__Hart It amounts to obstruction by Trump.
@maggieNYT This is obstruction.  Plain and simple.
@evanperez Is Cohen under subpoena?
@maggieNYT @MichaelCohen212 What if he's subpoenaed?  Can he just cancel at whim?
@Karoli Alex Witt is even worse.
Trump thinks he's a King or emperor.  This has to change. Vote him out.
@NicoleBelle @NBCNews @MSNBC I refuse to watch Chris Matthews.  They need to get rid of him. My favs are @AriMelber and @NicolleDWallace .  Yes, I know she's a Republican. But her show is insightful.
Trump should just tweet his SOTU.  It would probably be more meaningful to his followers. That's all he cares about.

@JoshDorner Let's hope a Democratic Congress can get to the bottom of this. Criminal charges seem to be in order.

@costareports Meanwhile, fed workers and contract workers still can't pay their bills or feed their kids.
@dpleasant I'm disgusted. Awaiting Trump to give out free Happy Meal gift cards to families in need.
@dpleasant Let alone fold an umbrella. He's not just inept but impaired. Where is his soaring rhetoric to convince those of his positions? His policies are guided little whispers into his ear by Stephen Miller or Coulter. Meanwhile, people can't pay their bills.
Moral purity?  Have they recognized Trump is president? The school that hired Karen Pence requires applicants to disavow gay marriage, trans identity https://t.co/wOswFrDhKb
@dpleasant You're right. I'm not sure of time either.  I watched PMQs today on Brexit. The questions are pre-screened but I can't believe Trump, like May or Corbyn could respond in real time, even with notes. I think Trump has a serious cognitive deficit.

@sahilkapur Unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence?  So, they're calling him a moron. That's a fact, not speculation.

@Normsmusic Good for you. I slept soundly through his wall word salad.  That's one benefit of working 11-7AM.  I can sleep through most of that BS.
@markknoller It's immoral and unethical to force people to work without a paycheck.
Glad I'm up early to hear from @KamalaHarris on @Morning_Joe  She's great.
@dpleasant I'm with you. It eludes logic that someone with a serious personality disorder could hold this office. It's almost too depressing to contemplate.  #RealitySucks
@peterdaou Yes and no.  I thought @SenSchumer would fold.  Not so, for @SpeakerPelosi Her resolve is famous. So far, so good.  #NoWall

My heart goes out to every federal worker or contractor who won't be paid on Jan 11th.  Trump needs to end this debacle now.
@Will_Bunch Ha.  I wish you would write about a lack of cameras in the Supreme Court.  Many states allow cameras.  MA allows filming appellate cases before SJC. Why can't our highest federal court allow same?
@PBS @RoadshowPBS Woo Hoo!
Arguments before appellate courts are important MA SJC allows cameras.  Why can't our Supreme Court provide the same transparency?
As we see cameras in a MA courtroom #Spacey we still don't have cameras in the Supreme Court.  That's wrong &amp; should be changed.
Dear @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer I've voted Dem all my life.  But if you give into Trump on wall funding, I will never vote again. That's a fact.
@TheRickWilson Time for jowl liposuction.  Or how about wiring his mouth shut for the next 2 years?
@nycsouthpaw "Eight prototypes bidding to become the model for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall cost between $300,000 and $500,000 each to build -- with the Department of Homeland security footing the bill."  More waste of $.
@ThePlumLineGS Trump is a con artist. Elevating him above that is ridiculous.
@DutchRM Good one.  I'm sure Trump can put together an IKEA wall.  As if. . .ü§£
@Endora_ If one watches, keep a barf bag nearby.
@KFILE She got close to quoting Paul Revere's Ride:  "One if by land, two if by sea".  :)
@CNNPolitics Hey, Trump.  No one went out on strike.  You're responsible for the shutdown.  Own up to it, stop trying to deflect.
@MeetThePress @MickMulvaneyOMB Trump gave up the concrete wall long ago.  This is just posturing.  No Wall! No money for a wall.
@Shoq @AlexWitt @maddow Witt never pushes back.  She's worse than @smerconish who does that both sides schtick.

@KenDilanianNBC He's unfit.  I watched his last presser with a discerning eye. I treat &amp; care for patients with serious dementia and they make more sense than Trump.
@brhodes Children will go hungry.  Trump doesn't give a damn.
@sam_vinograd @DHSgov Forcing people to work without pay.  We need these draconian measures to enhance border security.  But no wall, never, ever.
@RadioFreeTom I bet Trump would believe you.  Well, after the earlier presser. . .anything is possible.
Trump certainly failed to show empathy for workers going without pay. He really believes landlords &amp; mortgage companies are going to wait for payment? Talk about living in a bubble.
@Patrice_Brost1 I hope you're OK.
@CharlesPPierce I care for patients with severe dementia and they make more sense than Trump.
@poniewozik Serious question:  do we know if Trump watches television shows other than cable news?  What about films?  After all, there is a movie theater at the WH.

@dpleasant As an aside, I have utter contempt and disdain for Bernie Sanders.  I swear it's almost irrational. I support many of his suggested policies but he irks me to distraction.
@dpleasant I appreciate Chris Hayes taking a good look at reportage but he's only one.  Not enough. I want to hear from all candidate, not even close to making a decision. But, I'd vote for a wet paper towel over disgusting Trump.
@dpleasant The Warren bashing on both MSNBC and CNN is depressing. Media hasn't learned a thing post-Hillary.
@esglaude Dementia or drunk?
@samstein Stephen Miller?
Dear @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi Do not cave on the Wall. If you do, as a lifelong voting Dem, I will never cast another ballot.
There's nothing Mitt can do to change Trump. It's too little, too late.  Fighting a pathological narcissist with a personality disorder is impossible.
@Shoq That's horrible.  I once had my Social Security number revealed via Disqus.
Andy Card, again calling Romney a freshman senator. Way to demean, without being cruel.  #MSNBC
@jayrosen_nyu Has media learned nothing post-Hillary?  It's extremely depressing.
@tommyxtopher @MittRomney It's 2019 and people still don't recognize that Romney will do whatever is self-serving?
@poniewozik I'm afraid to watch. Dust bunnies may have to die.  As well as crinkled tees.
@MattGertz Does someone record the Fox shows for Trump?  And then tweet for him, almost quoting the shows verbatim.  Or is that a WH mystery?
@GottaLaff @ewarren There's a lot of Warren bashing going on.  CNN may be even worse. Media hasn't learned a thing post-Hillary.
There are no provisions in Trump's NAFTA 2.0 to have Mexico pay for the wall.  Are his followers really so stupid to believe him?
@joshtpm I'm sure he sent Trump another love letter.  Can we FOIA that?  :)

@tomandlorenzo Richard Quest moments are even more so.

@HeerJeet That said, both of my husbands served as officers in the Army during the era of the Vietnam War. They were both physicians but didn't go Vietnam . But they weren't cowards.  And didn't lie about their medical status.
@HeerJeet True.  I remember some of our family friends trying to fake urine tests for diabetes, anything to get out of going to Vietnam. One young friend was granted conscientious objector but those were rarely given. It was a horrible time.  That said, Trump is being dishonest.
@CapehartJ It's pathetic Trump can't at least be shamed into doing what's right. His pathological narcissism overrides reality.
@HansNichols That seems to be stabilizing the market.  LoL

@SopanDeb He got Wall Street mixed up with Santa Claus.
My husband and I loved playing Santa üéÖüèª for our 4 children. Of course, they figured it out, but it was fun, a fantasy and an enjoyable family tradition. Thankfully, Trump wasn't around to spoil it all.

@jaketapper .So much for the Stable Genius.  He's "blowing up" diplomacy if not the world. I mourn a cogent strategy for dealing with Syria.
@danpfeiffer .Does Trump understand many federal workers live pay-check-to-pay-check? What worker who needs to meet rent &amp; pay for holiday gifts will want to bring Trump his Diet Coke? I'm disgusted.
Hey, McConnell - Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. End of story. Stop dissembling

@joshtpm @RadioFreeTom .Trump's entire life &amp; of course, his presidency , is all about immediate ego gratification. He doesn't care about this country, only about his pathological need to dominate a news cycle, while trying to present an alternate &amp; fallacious reality. He's a psychologically ill man.
What a difficult surgery for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She must survive the Trump presidency and long after. My heart aches for her pain &amp; wish her a speedy recovery w/o complications or metastatic disease. #MyHero
@dpleasant I'm sorry if I sound grumpy. Just tired, it's been busy at work.
@dpleasant I subscribe to both but spend far more time reading WaPo. Writers at WaPo seem to understand the gravity of Trump's aberrant behavior &amp; underscore the spineless GOP. NYTs offers little insight &amp; still haven't acknowledged their lack of judgement &amp; damage w/their Hillary bashing.
@dpleasant My sentiments exactly. Also, Trump is clearly unstable &amp; headed off unrestrained to engage in his dictatorial proclivities. But where is the hard journalism detailing this, with primary source quotes? I'm disgusted.
@chucktodd It's time to head for the bunkers.
It's obvious. The crazies like Stephen Miller are now in charge.
@ColMorrisDavis You're being too kind.
@RadioFreeTom And Trump puts Stephen Miller on CNN.  This is crazy.
Is there a local psych unit that can pick up Stephen Miller?  He's off the rails.
@jwgop He's even more unhinged than Trump. He's frightening.
Stephen Miller is spouting crazy talking points w/o any type real analysis or way forward. This is who Trump trots out? The man is a moron.
OMG, hairless Stephen Miller is on CNN trying to put a good spin on Mattis quitting.   Oy vey!

Lanny Davis wants us to believe Michael Cohen has reformed &amp; close to sainthood. . Come on, get out of here. And the comparison to John Dean falls flat. #MSNBC
@BenjySarlin I'd love to see a US version of PMQs. I bet Trump would sign on for the tv rights.
.@tommyxtopher Trump is again relying on the lies that people crossing the border are bringing in disease and in need of immediate/chronic medical care. #xenophobia #lies
@tommyxtopher @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer A thing of beauty.
It's about time Trump was called out publicly for his damn lies. Well done, @SenSchumer &amp; @NancyPelosi
Dear @NancyPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer I've been a Dem all my life. If you give that little Trump Tyrant $5 billion for a border wall, I will NEVER vote again.
@TerrySilliman Your profile is absolutely charming.  Ha!  Do they allow you to tweet from prison?
@nycsouthpaw So presidential. Well, at this point in time.  :)
@AndyKroll @longform @Longreads A really good piece of journalism. Thank you.
@McFaul No.  He's just a moron and actually thinks that's how it's spelled.

The Trump presidency is a criminal enterprise. By now, that has to be obvious.

@MattGertz And what is wrong with Stuart Varney? He didn't push back on this hateful and incorrect rhetoric. It's pathetic.
@atrupar @replouiegohmert Fox Business and Stuart Varney should apologize immediately for allowing this type hateful rhetoric.
@jbpollster @RJC @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with Stuart Varney?  He just moved on, as if nothing controversial or outright lies had been spewed.
@owillis I like your mom.  By the way, I mentioned hair transplants to my son.  Ha!
@MaxBoot .And Stuart Varney is a coward for not speaking up.
@sahilkapur Good.  No $5billion for that damn wall!
Trump's facial expression looks like his spanx are riding up.
The clothes are even more gorgeous on Season 2 of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
Watching a 10-yr old episode of @KQEDcheckplease. It's wonderful &amp; I swear @lesliesbrocco must have been 20 and hasn't aged a day since. I want her secret.
@GottaLaff Yes, yes.  I do like a frightened Trump. On the other hand, he could get scared and blow up the world.
@GottaLaff And he's also damn nervous about Flynn.
That arse Flynn, better get prison time. After all, he led the lock her up Hillary chants at Trump rallies.
@jgabb8381 @foodwishes Gorgeous.
@aravosis .I'm proud Trump blocked me. Who needs to see any more examples of his narcissism?
.@EricTrump Your father can't admit the Central Park Five were wrongly convicted and he called for their death.  I call that horrific.
@LOLGOP .Is there a genetic trait that negates the Trump children from introspection?  Or is it all a joke/trolling?
@nytopinion @paulkrugman .That map looks like a uterus, so it's clearly understandable why GOP would fight it.
@JohnJHarwood Poor little Eric.  So unable to view his father's life.

@cpeitsch1 Hey, big boy.  Get a few more followers before you respond to me. Thanks in advance.
@Green_Footballs I think she did.  But @CharlesPPierce was a bit too strident.  I love him but his points came across as angry. I don't think that was his intention.
@rolandscahill Trump's vain. You'd think he'd do something about the bloat, not to mention the cum stuff in his hair.
@markknoller .That's fine.  No one from Bush family wants them there.
Suddenly, in death, Trump feels he should pay his respects to George H W Bush?  That is all kinds of wrong.
@JuliaAdair He and Melania are going there tonight.  Disgusting.

@owillis If Trump gets $5 billion in funding for that damn wall, I will NEVER vote again.  I've let both my Dem Senators know this.  No compromising.
I don't think it's appropriate for Trump and Melania paying their "respects" to George H W. Bush.  The hypocrisy is too much.

Trump is paranoid. That should be obvious to all. The WH doctor needs to check him out. A STAT mental health exam.
@page88 @lrozen @AvBronstein This is so true.  As a Jew, I love Israel, but abhor the right wing politics. I hope that makes me a good person.
@Johngcole You're so damn wonderful.
Trump is as close to a dictator as possible. This is serious.
Dear Trump, I live in CA and the 9th Circuit isn't against you, or immigration.  It's called the rule of law, and the Constitution. Got that?
I have to go to work in an hour.  When will Trump complete his "thought"?  By that I mean, twitter babbling.
@dpleasant It's entirely reactionary and ego driven.  How pathetic is that?
Could someone please show Trump how to use an ellipsis?
@dpleasant So the 0th Circuit isn't independent?  His thinking is so bizarre.
@yashar This is frikkin' unbelievable.
@historylvrsclub @DianeToucan I needed to see that today.  Thank you.
@CBCKatie Is US still an ally? Not by my observations.  How sad.
@RF_P0TUS Roberts spoke out against Trump.  Give him that.
I take great umbrage with CNN warning children shouldn't view images of starving children in Yemen. How else will they know the horrors? There were no warnings when I was young viewing Vietnam soldiers dying &amp; killed. I'm a mother of 4 and these images need to be viewed by all.
@stevebenen I'm still shocked Roberts did this and also in awe. He has more guts than Congressional GOP.
@dpleasant But eventually, it will be a fail.  There's only so much this nation can withstand.  Roberts' opinion is a good start.
@dpleasant I am in complete shock.  But GOP will deride him.  It's just a matter of time.

CNN is airing a show on "Furries".  Don't exploit them. They need psychiatric care.
@WSJ @TheRickWilson If only Trump felt that way.
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump I live in Northern CA and we clear the brush around our homes.  Never heard the use of word floor.  Ground is often used as in ground cover, which is far different from what Trump's pitifully trying to describe. He also wants "great climate".  Trump isn't very bright.
@JonLemire .I hope Gov. Brown and Gov.-Elect Gavin Newsom lectured the hell out of Trump about the causes of the fires and climate change.

@brianbeutler Thank you for that important correction.   NYTs should note.
Children playing down the street are wearing masks, due to the poor air quality.  #CampFire No words of compassion from Trump. He's a sick man.
@jimsciutto Whitaker needs to recuse himself.

@USATODAY Retire gracefully &amp; put all her $ in the bank?
@DavidCornDC I request you ask every day, "when will Trump visit our military in Iraq and Afghanistan."  Is Trump lazy or a coward?
@darth Panko or regular bread crumbs?  Add some garlic in the buttery crumbs.  The best.
Has Trump tweeted anything about the death of Brent Taylor? By the way, when will Trump visit our brave troops in the Middle East?  Is Trump too afraid to enter a combat zone?  https://t.co/IM7TmzyXqY

@joanwalsh @JohnJHarwood You have to ask?  Maybe, I can send him a pre-school level book about Judiasm?  With lots of pics?
@JohnJHarwood I think Trump was trying to say Shabbos and blew it.  It sounded like Sabbos.
@ddale8 He's always defensive..
@ddale8 Like election results?  Which he disputes?  His vocabulary is pathetically small.
Trump can't even pronounce "Shabbos" correctly.  It's not difficult.
@blakehounshell It's a beautiful occasion for Jewish family/ community.   The last thought anyone's mind is "pack a firearm".  Jewish celebrations will not be forced into furthering possibility of gun violence.  At least, not in my lifetime.

@ddale8 Trump used the word "results".  I think he meant facts.  Instead, it sounds like he's talking about an election.  He has a one track imbecilic mind.

@GottaLaff Trump knows they will be stopped and questioned at the border.  The fear mongering is beyond the pale.  As for turnaround, I'll take that over his earlier tweet :  "MUST BE CHANDED".
Is there nothing that will have a salutary effect on Trump's conduct &amp; egregious tweets against media?
@mags_cooney @pbump It's a pre-school in San Francisco.

Bingo! https://t.co/8t6xWZW7Yn
@GottaLaff Only if you own or wear a #MAGA hat.

Trump is such a hypocrite.  His rallies do nothing but support/promote violence.  And no apology for his disgusting #MAGA rallies.
@Green_Footballs Coward!
Who in the WH thought it was a good idea to have Melania address the nation over a domestic terrorist attack?
Trump needs to offer a full apology for his #MAGA rallies which do nothing more than promote violence against liberals.
@lrozen That's going to leave a good forensic trail.
Trump needs to address the American people and also shut down his #MAGA rallies.
@kenvogel @georgesoros @AlexanderSoros @nytopinion I couldn't agree more.
@GlennKesslerWP I hope you have strength. With 10 more upcoming MAGA rallies.  You're going to be shoveling heavyüí©.

@RonaldKlain We've eradicated smallpox, polio is on the decline, not to mention pertussis &amp; diphtheria. I assume science only matters to Trump when trying to discern sex.

@speechboy71 It's so bizarre. Where did Trump learn to use "strongly"?  I didn't learn that in college, nor anyone I know.  Scientific evidence strongly suggests Trump is a moron.  Strongly.

@owillis Like most in GOP:  Spineless nematodes.
I like interesting discourse, but why in the hell is Corey Lewandowski on MSNBC? He lies at the same rate of Trump.
@brianstelter @soledadobrien It's pathological lying.  Media needs to begin saying this.
@AymanM @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS And fueled by Fox &amp; Friends this morning.
@BrendanNyhan Trump saw it on Fox &amp; Friends.  Of course.
@MattGertz I knew it was going to be "intel" from Fox.  Trump's disgusting, an intellectual moron and pathological liar.
It took SA 2 weeks to come up this story? This reeks to high heaven.  Talk about a cover-up.  Of course, Trump is in on it.  I'm sick over this.
@kaitlancollins @Olivianuzzi The incredulity of it all.  But, it's very Trumpian.  People are quick to buy absurdity.
@JoyceWhiteVance We need, no, we demand a statement from Pompeo and Trump.  STAT.
@brianstelter Why is this information released on a Friday night?  Is SA in collusion with Trump for a Friday night dump?
@RNicholasBurns And Trump has been playing into their hands.  Rogue killers?
@blakehounshell I want to scream and cry at the same time.  This is horrible.
@erin_pelton @GlennKesslerWP It took them over 2 weeks?  This is pathetic.
@houdini77 @joshtpm It's the go-to pity party. Not buying any of it.
@DeanObeidallah I hope you've notified the authorities. No one should have to put up with threats of violence or death.
@dpleasant Trump is bordering on fascism.  I hate to even write that, but when one looks at his speeches, or just interviews, isn't that obvious?  It's a fine line he treads.
@dpleasant I think Obama brought out the right wing hatred &amp; now b/c of Trump they feel free to express their bigotry.  Pent up angry is ugly.
@markknoller Trump is supporting violence against journalists.  Is that OK with you?
@dpleasant I have neighbors who support Trump based on $. It makes no sense when Obama brought them out of a disaster.  I think it's more about bigotry.  Few want to admit prejudice, but they do so, passively by supporting Trump.
@JohnJHarwood .Trump's a pugilistic legend in his own mind.
@ZekeJMiller .Why not say "Trump lies?"  That's factual.
@dpleasant Where is the pathology in his voters? White males? It's disturbing that even college grad white males support Trump. Will well-educated women and people of color have to save the US from the autocrat Trump?  That's a heavy load. I'm not as optimistic as I sound.
@dpleasant Trump is making it open season on all journalists.  I may ü§Æ
@dpleasant I've watched a lot of these Trump rallies.  This one is bizarre and applauding violence against a journalist?  This won't work.  Most of US cares about #JamalKhashoggi
@chrislhayes I'm almost physically ill by this Trumpian outburst.  The bar is even lower than I thought possible.
This is wrong on every level.  Is Trump that desperate? https://t.co/nBrzWCSQwV
@PhilipRucker This is sick.  Is Trump so desperate and have the memory of a gnat? We will never forget #JamalKhashoggi and the legitimacy of the press.
@Green_Footballs And violence against reporters.  Has Trump learned nothing? #JamalKashoggi
Trump is endorsing violence against reporters. Stand up against this. Hear that GOP?  https://t.co/gpZA0RKC5e
@seungminkim @Bencjacobs Again, Trump is endorsing violence.  How can this continue? I'm sick.
@ddale8 @Bencjacobs This is outrageous.  Again, Trump is endorsing violence.
@ddale8 That hair thing?  Beyond bizarre.
@Acosta It's a major comb over w/some kind glue on the side. Such important issues. Ego-driven Trump.
Trump's #MAGA rally is all about his ego and now his hair?  WTF?
@ddale8 This entire rally is all about Trump's ego.  It's pathological.
I enjoy reading @ddale8's feed on Trump rallies. Hell, I even try to watch sometimes. But then the nausea ensues. Kudos to @ddale8 for a job well done.
@nycsouthpaw That has to be illegal.
@maggieNYT Every child in middle school or early high school must take a class in critical thinking, that includes proper sourcing. Without a basic education in fact-finding our country &amp; future is in peril.
@PressSec And due to tariffs, you're giving them money we borrow from China. Your administration is crazy.
@jimsciutto @Rene_MarshCNN @FoxReports The grifting by this administration never ends.
@owillis He's like a small puppy re-eating his vomit. Where is his strength &amp; conviction?
@joshrogin @PostOpinions I've read the piece several times.  I'm torn between screaming and crying. This should never again happen, while US is partnering with SA.  Now, can we stop the war deaths &amp; famine in Yemen?
Jared Kusher &amp; @IvankaTrump have no business being anywhere near the WH.  We need to call for their resignations today.
@waltshaub @juliaioffe @jaketapper Several layers of duplicity.  That's difficult for people to unpack.  What's the number one by Trump? Saving his finances or his ego?
We need to hear more from media about Jared Kushner in hiding.  #JamalKhashoggi
@markknoller Not another Vanity Rally?  Most of us, are sick of his repetitive, lying rallies.
@SenBlumenthal Has Trump no decency?
@yashar Horrendous, absolutely ghastly.
Babysitting my grandson &amp; reading. https://t.co/f0R5IYJ7nG
@MichaelAvenatti This isn't going to help.  Trump is a pig and his voters love him like that.  How sad.
It's really sad, when Trump sees Democrats as evil. How does he think Congress can work with this divisiveness?
Yay @PeteSouza I love your photos &amp; thank you for expressing the need for dignity in the office of the President.  I've purchased 5 of your books.  I'm a fan, to be sure.
Trump calls Storny Daniels horseface, yet Trump blocked me on twitter b/c I called him a pathological narcissist. One is truthful, the other not. Let's never forget Trump is thin-skinned.
@JoyceWhiteVance @JRubinBlogger Everyone needs to wake up.  It's frustrating for me, living in CA, where we think little of Trump and will vote overwhelming for Dems.  Take heed folks &amp; vote Dem 2018.
@GottaLaff Have they no decency?
@MiaFarrow @ELLEmagazine Forgettable?
@Green_Footballs No public meetings today. So, it's a Trump free for all.
So much for #BeBest.  Dear @FLOTUS your husband just described a woman as horseface. You should control his urges to bully, before getting claiming moral ground.
@ddale8 But even Fox News wouldn't want Trump to refer to Stormy Daniels as horseface.
@tomtomorrow The WH physician needs to evaluate him. And provide meds.  This is beyond crazy.
Horseface?  This is the way Trump describes a woman?  Dear WH physician,  Trump needs medication. This isn't normal conduct by any president.
@byHeatherLong @TimOBrien Just what we don't need.  More campylobacter.
.@jacobsoboroff goes to Staten Island to find out why Trump voters like Trump. This is tiring.
@JakeSherman Then, why is Trump tweeting about Warren this morning? Lindsey needs to call his BFF, now.
So pleased to see @ThePlumLineGS on @MorningJoe.
@brianstelter @60Minutes Is Trump's lying is so profligate he forgets there's video?
@mtaibbi I predict Trump's response:  "Who cares?"
@joshtpm There's a Trump dating app?  WTF?  ü§Æ
So, Mike Pompeo went to Saudi Arabia to help cook up the defense about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?
@ProPublica after watching #unprotected I made a donation to your organization. Thank you for your excellent reporting.
@katiemeyler You're a monster.  Get a job flipping burgers, you don't belong near children or in any way promoting education.
@NBCNightlyNews @NBCNews How about distributing meals?  One bottle of water?  This is just a photo op.
@bobcesca_go Nader is on daily progressive radio. I'm a progressive, but refuse to listen to his twaddle.
The only thing Trump knows about Sears is the catalog he hid under his bed &amp; torn pages displaying models in their bras.  That's a fact.
@joshtpm People are becoming inured to Trump's moronic statements.  But historians will not be so kind.
.@FLOTUS needs to understand the most important First Ladies weren't angry nor display acts of entitlement. They were educators &amp; uplifting. They also didn't they send coded messages to media.

@ddale8 Melania needs someone to help her with messaging. This one backfired. Bigly.
@karentravers @jonkarl I saw Jon Karl's face during the Kanye "production".  It was unbelievable &amp; put a smile on mine.
@CiaoSamin Cheese, pork &amp; foccacia.  It's a beautiful show.  And never forget the olive oil.
@CiaoSamin I'm loving Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. I buy fresh rosemary foccacia every other day, but nothing like yours. This is a brilliant show. Thanks.
@QueerEye Can you please give @SteveKornacki of MSNBC a makeover.? His khaki pants, blue shirts &amp; rep ties need major updating. Thanks.
Trump says curbing arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to missing journalist is ‚Äònot acceptable‚Äô https://t.co/n7Xgzuy32A  Pathetic response by Trump.
@GottaLaff Of course.  But Kayne has serious mental health issues and shouldn't be anywhere near the White House.
I don't want to see anyone with mental health used. That's what Trump did today with Kanye.  It was a serious psychological break, flight of ideas by Kanye. He isn't healthy.
@GottaLaff Kanye isn't well.  He has serious emotional health problems, as were demonstrated today. Flight of ideas....Yet, media will take Kayne seriously.
@JoyceWhiteVance Bingo!
@lrozen Yes.  On board with Crazy Town.
@eugenegu Are you watching Kanye?  As I wrote earlier, he needs mental health care &amp; medication.  It's a flight of ideas, bordering on "crazy".
@joshrogin I thought it would be CRAZY.
Flight of ideas, is a psychiatric term.  It refers to Kayne, right now. He needs help.
@aravosis This is the most bizarre thing I've seen in years.
@Yamiche You know he has serious mental health issues.
Dear Kayne, you need your meds adjusted.  This is really sad.
Kayne's stream of consciousness is beyond sad. #Trump
@steveweinstein She has Stockholm syndrome &amp; probably an iron-clad prenuptial.
.@CapehartJ Please shave.  That's all.
@ParkerMolloy Trump is a pathologist narcissist and liar. This is factual.  Stop expecting him to act in a normal manner.  It's impossible.
@JohnJHarwood This is really pathetic.  Trump can't do better than these D-listers?
@colvinj .This is so pathetic.
@mitchellreports @kwelkernbc .Call it what is it:  Department of Propaganda.  We see this in other authoritarian states.  Never forget that.
Who is advising Melania? This is the most distorted &amp; self-indulgent thing I've heard.  She's as narcissistic as her hubby.  https://t.co/3mjmdYSTTv
@eugenegu I have problems with Trump using Kanye.  He has serious mental health issues &amp; is being used by Trump.
@nycsouthpaw Let's test Trump.  Can he define stare decisis?  ü§£

@davidfrum Geez.  They're going full on gangster.
@brianbeutler Trump supporters are these rallies are wholly ignorant and applaud or repeat refrains for everything he says. It's kinda scary.
@ddale8 Kanye has serious mental health issues.  Trump is using him and he doesn't know it.
@ddale8 What in the hell does this mean?  More crazy talk from Trump?
@MWJ1231 @BetoORourke Yay!!
@lrozen These are ego rallies for Trump.  People are tiring of his rhetoric.
@peterdaou @GOPChairwoman Trump just called all Democrats "dims".  This is beyond crazy.
This may be one of Trump's biggest lies. https://t.co/Yhnv2meB09
How does @ddale8 do it? Fact checking Trump rallies in real time.  Kudos!
@ddale8 what's with the green MAGA hats?  Is that something new?
Trump rallies are interesting. People clap for anything. Most political rallies have tag lines, that receive applause. For Trump, they just randomly applaud.  Weird.
@ddale8 Finally, Trump may have said something accurate.
Trump has such a sophisticated audience.  Chanting "lock her up" and referring to Democrats as "Dims".
@ddale8 Talk about an angry mob.
@jdawsey1 Kanye.
@lrozen There are shoes to sell.
Is Trump aware Kanye has serious mental health issues?  He's being played &amp; used by Trump. https://t.co/m6j2TVsJ6F
Kavanaugh and Trump believe we're all idiots? This speech was nothing but GOP propaganda and attempt to rehab his image.  How pathetic.
Who advised Kavanaugh to give this speech? No one can possibly believe what he's trying to sell, at this late date.
Wait.  Now Kavanaugh wants to be a great justice for all?  We're to ignore his disdain for liberals?  He's lying again.
Justice Kavanaugh has no shame.  He should be humble, instead we hear nothing but his bravado and partisanship.
Justice Kavanaugh should apologize to the nation for his bizarre/angry/partisan outburst during the hearing, instead of his adoration of Trump.
@GlennThrush Project Rome and no gladiators?
@Patrice_Brost1 Good.  Keep pushing her to vote.  Sometimes, that's the only way. Be a nag.  She's too bright, not to vote.  Oh hell, just shame her into voting. üòÇ

@jayrosen_nyu As a subscriber of NYTs, these types of articles annoy me.  Why dismiss facts and go with blustery Don as a successful president?
@WestWingReport Does Trump have any plans to visit our troops in Afghanistan? His absence is glaring.
Two of my patients I cared for last night, both women in their 80's are appalled by Kavanaugh &amp; upset he is going to be a Justice. It's not just the young.  #VoteDemocrat

@Green_Footballs Elections have consequences.  Always vote for Dems.  This nation needs a thorough cleansing from the taint of Trump.
Don't come crying to me when Kavanaugh is the next SC Justice.  Elections have consequences.  Vote for Democrats.  Always.
@GideonResnick So, damn obvious.
The Kavanaugh tide is with GOP.  Remember, elections have consequences.  Get out and vote for Democrats in Nov.  The End.
Mitch McConnell actually referred to Kavanaugh as a potential collegial member of SC.   Yeah, when he isn't inappropriately ranting, raving &amp; screaming.

Thank you @AprilDRyan for bringing up Central Park Five. Another dismissive answer by @PressSec
I pay @PressSec salary.  I do not pay her to lie.
Facts? Trump's tone about Dr. Ford was dismissive and derogatory.  What is wrong with @PressSec?  Lies and more lies.
@JohnAmato @PressSec After the election, Trump is going to need Democrats.  They have no long-plan?
As of November, Trump is going to need Democrats. Why does @PressSec  &amp; Trump continue to disparage?
@Shoq More isolationism.  And Bolton wants war. Will my grandson survive the debacle of Trump &amp; his sycophants?

@KenDilanianNBC .Let's get Trump's tax records.  STAT.
What sickens me is no WH reporter will ask Trump about this. https://t.co/CdUcKU4Tji  cc: @brianstelter
@KenDilanianNBC .I'm reading it.  And not surprised.  Why isn't red-state America horrified by this?
@owillis Did you see the Today Show interview with Joel Osteen?  He's another grifter.  No one seems to care. Color me jaded.
@owillis No one the right cares. He's the president and we have to bow down to his ignorance and criminality.  It sickens me.
@Green_Footballs Kavanaugh believes he can lie with impunity.  Just like Trump.  It's actually that simple.  It's all about the credibility of white men. They aren't to be questioned.
@KFILE A real choir boy.
@jimsciutto .It takes time when you're lying.
@HoarseWisperer Witness tampering between friends.  Oy vey.
So, Kavanaugh is now involved in "witness" tampering?   He's a total disgrace.
@yashar I'm sure if they allowed cameras in the Supreme Court, the justices would ask for security.  How sad is that?
@chrisgeidner That sounds like Ted Bundy's defense.
@CharlesMBlow Trump never pays a price for his lies.  It's abysmal.
@TODAYshow @JoelOsteen He's nothing but a con man/grifter.
@FoxNewsSunday @PressSec Why not?  If it leads to the truth?
@dpleasant I'm sorry if she was sexually assaulted but who can take her seriously?  Even @morningmika sees through her and won't book her. Jake Tapper didn't ask her about Kavanaugh's temperament, which is key.
@StevenBeschloss Can you imagine of Obama had said this?  Trump's ego is everything.  Love Letters From Kim?  A new Broadway play?
@owillis On this point, one has to give @morningmika credit.  No more @KellyannePolls
I have nothing but sympathy for @KellyannePolls but why would she work for a serial abuser?  Stockholm Syndrome or denial?  Did she file charges as Trump feels is paramount? https://t.co/L57kuFUFM1
@rickklein Another Benghazi debacle?  Enough of this tripe.
@hapkidogal @KellyannePolls The hypocrisy. . .
@jackshafer Sperm facials, Bunny tattoos, composting your daddy, etc.  See, I fixed it.
I'm sorry @KellyannePolls was sexually assaulted but she's a bit flippant about it. Why is that? #CNN
Why isn't @jaketapper asking @KellyannePolls about Kavanaugh's anger?  He certainly wasn't judicial in any manner.
@brianstelter It's reported ppl at the Trump rally are shouting "lock her up".  Are they aware it's 2018?  They need a better slogan.
I'm proud to live &amp; vote in California  https://t.co/l98rlhfSKa
@AshaRangappa_ His entire rebuttal was one of lying, dissembling and prevaricating.  Let's not forget he is hiding documents from Judiciary Committee.
@jdawsey1 .Good piece. But Kavanaugh isn't a very effective liar.  He has a "tell" almost every time.  Don't others see that?
@ditzkoff .Funniest damn thing I'll see all day.  Thanks.
@DeanObeidallah Let's not forget, Kavanaugh was bragging about being an excellent student. As if drunks can't perform? Is he aware there are drunk and drug-addicted physicians seeing patients every day? (10 percent of the population is adversely affected by drugs or alcohol.)
@matthewamiller .He crossed a line beyond indignation when he began inappropriately interrogating Sen Amy Klobuchar.  I don't want a Justice that irrational.
Warning:  Slithery Serpent Ted Cruz pontificating and lecturing while being condescending.  Those are his only "skills".
Sen. @amyklobuchar is calling out the cowardice of Republicans, &amp; hypocrisy over Merrick Garland delay tactics.  Shame them and shame them again.
@imillhiser We call that a lie.
Aren't we tired of Sen. John Kennedy's hokey routine?  It's become predictable and boring.
Kavanaugh can't run away from his inability to invoke an FBI investigation.  And same for GOP.
That smarmy, slithering Ted Cruz.  ü§Æ
Excellent line of questioning by Sen Cory Booker.
@LOLGOP But I don't think Roy Moore was as angry.  Dumber, but not as angry.
@RonBrownstein And his anger.  I found it frightening.  How is that judicial temperament?
@GottaLaff @maziehirono I attended a Catholic high schools and the biggest drinkers were the jocks.  That's a fact.
@Karoli She's so bright and a true progressive.  But damn, every time I see her, I want to go on vacation and fly to Hawaii.
Ted Bundy was also a nice guy.  Got that, @GrahamBlog?
Let's be clear. Kavanaugh doesn't have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice.  How can he continue to go forward as a federal judge?
@joshtpm But we know he lies.  That's a fact.
I think it's clear Kavanaugh  knows its over for him as a SCOTUS justice.  He's clearly trying to save his current federal judgeship.
@lizzieohreally Not Trump.
Now, he's sorry for being a douchebag?  #yearbook  And can't stop crying.  Oy vey. #KavanaughHearings
Dear Kavanaugh:  stop crying and take a polygraph.
Can someone give Kavanaugh a break?  He needs to gather inner resources.  This is beyond pathetic.
@HoarseWisperer Truth!
Clearly, Kavanaugh isn't emotionally stable. This is sad.
Is there any current SC Justice who is as crazily partisan as Kavanaugh?  How can he possibly be fair when ruling on Dem legislation?
Way too much anger from Kavanaugh.  SCOTUS is a collegial &amp; caring body. Who would want to work with this crazed man?
Now, Kavanaugh is crying?  He's the victim?  Damn!
Kavanaugh needs anger management classes.  STAT.
I agree, this is a circus.  And Kavanaugh is the clown.  Angry, unhinged clown.
Kavanaugh is too angry.  This is a Trump ploy, but not one to garner sympathy.
@VeraMBergen Cowards.

Trump now admits @Nytimes is doing very well.  Of course, due to him.
@WestWingReport I think right and left should be frightened by Trump's ego &amp; flight of ideas.  This isn't an emotionally healthy person.
@GottaLaff I just opened a bottle of wine.
Trump's policy on Israel and Palestine:  everyone needs to be happy.
@brianstelter Trump's flight of ideas and paranoia are on display.  This is pathetic.
Trump heard smiles.  That's a new one.
Everyone should be frightened by Trump's lies and bizarre flight of ideas.  This is not a well man.
@CillizzaCNN All Crazy Ego, No Substance.
Trump's ego is talking. He doesn't care about issues.  It's all about his perception of winning.
Trump again, misstates the Iran deal.  So, what else is new?
It's elucidating that Trump has no idea he sounds bizarre, delusional &amp; paranoid.  He needs medication.

@ErikWemple @jaketapper @MichaelAvenatti Yes, indeed.
@TPM Woof-woof.
@SenJeffMerkley Wonderful news.  Thank you.
What?  @MSNBC is reporting from deep red state Montana to get a "feel" on Kavanaugh? I'm sick of this. Come to blue states.

@NYTNational He's playing the long game and running for POTUS.  And I support him.
@daveweigel That's really gross.  Even for that crowd.
@RonaldKlain @brianschatz Reminder:  Trump's casinos failed.  This is the same thinking.
@markknoller @USAID Meanwhile, her husband called them S-holes.
@jimsciutto @OsborneInk Kavanaugh has  grotesque handwriting.  Even for a teen.
My pet peeve?  A lot of words come out of @DanaBashCNN's mouth before she gets to her point.  She works too hard to play "both sides".
@ZekeJMiller .Since when?  This must get more media attention today.  Alas, that probably won't happen.
@ddale8 GOP will claim it's just "horseplay".  How disgusting.

@sahilkapur It's not about guilt or innocence.  This is a job interview.  So, far I wouldn't hire Kavanaugh.  Would you?
When I type Cosby, my brain says to type Trump.  How sad is that state of American politics?
@brhodes What will Trump do as revenge?  That's what scares me.

@jdawsey1 @DavidNakamura @agearan The world knows Trump lies.  Who isn't going to laugh at this clown?
Trump lashes out at second accuser, Ramirez.  #UNGA laughing at him, was too much for his little ego.
@KFILE Absolutely horrible.  What's wrong with these people?
@jdelreal And this is a man who claims to respect women?  What a disgrace.
@AlecMacGillis This is disgusting.  How did a teacher approve those yearbook pages and not question the students about their assertions?  What a horrible place.
@joanwalsh Didn't you see his testimony?  He's far from articulate.  And now he's lying even more.
@digby56 Can Kavanaugh prove he was a virgin until well after college?  Well, it has to be asked.

Trump is promoting a Fox interview with Judge Kavanaugh &amp; wife.  This is grossly inappropriate.
@dpleasant I think you‚Äôre losing if you have to ‚Äútry‚Äù your case on Fox. I knew we‚Äôd end up with RW nuts on SC. But for the brouhaha over Hillary‚Äôs emails. Grrr.
@dpleasant Who advised him to this?  Hannity et al? This is a big mistake.
@soledadobrien Another asterisk by his name.  How pathetic.
@tomandlorenzo She's sporty and can manage a ball or two.  I love her.
@poniewozik have you seen John Goodman in Black Earth Rising? What a great performance.
@davidfolkenflik Of course, it's Fox.  And all media outlets will pick up his interview and play snippets.  Where's the critical questioning?  This is a PR/ad campaign by Kavanaugh.
@agearan @HassanRouhani @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump At least, he's being sensible.  Not so much from our president, Trump.
@owillis He's so desperate for this job.  It's bordering on pathological.
@Phil_Mattingly .As was Merrick Garland, if not more so.
@HeidiPrzybyla @SenateMajLdr .There was no "dirt on Gorsuch proffered by Dems.  Maybe, because he was truly vetted and didn't have a shady background.
@ryanjreilly No one saw this type of confusion in the Obama White House.  This isn't the fault of media.  It's the fault of Trump &amp; his crazy admin.
@davidfrum .Confusion and obfuscation reigns, as they say in the Trump White House.
@ErikWemple according to Pete Williams @MSNBC Rosenstein hasn't resigned/ or been fired.  Color me confused.
Can anyone imagine if @BarackObama had as many scandals as Trump?  Remember, Trump's presidency is anomalous.  We're headed into unfamiliar territory.
Trump is proving himself today:  an autocrat.  That's not what our Founders envisioned.
@bobcesca_go It's very frightening.  If you're not scared, there's something wrong.  GOP and Dems alike, we should all be wary.
@ChrisCuomo Trump can't fire someone, as he's at Trump Tower.  Despite his Apprentice Show, he lacks the courage.
@CitizenCohn Now, they're party to obstruction of justice.
Meet Noel Francisco, the man who will oversee the Mueller probe if Trump fires Rosenstein https://t.co/kgkZzzJ7mE via @voxdotcom
@greenfield64 Let's just mark our calendars as Saturday and enjoy a long weekend.  Is that possible?
I'm sure Mueller has contingency plans. Rosenstein's firing/resignation was  anticipated.
@yashar Who do I believe?  Conflicting information sucks, though it is understandable.
The Trump White House is a total üí©show and has been from Day 1.  This can't continue into another presidential term.
@brianbeutler That's a hopeful thought.
@peterdaou .Fired or resigned, this is going to backfire on Trump.
@ErikWemple I want clear facts.  Kinda tiring of CNN &amp; MSNBC speculating over firing or resigning.
@joshtpm It's all so damn complicated.  But, I still see obstruction of justice by Trump.
Firing Rosenstein is obstruction of justice.  Got that, Trump?
@PreetBharara Is this constitutional crisis time?

@anamariecox They're not black or white, and not legally admissible.   But hey can be a useful tool to help discern overall veracity.  The FBI routinely uses them for in-house personnel inquiries.
@CharlesPPierce Will Kavanaugh agree to a polygraph?  If not, he's a coward and most likely, a guilty predator.
@nycsouthpaw .Let's never accept Kavanaugh's conduct as normal, high school sexual advances by "nice" boys. That's what the right will claim, meanwhile smearing Blasey Ford's reputation.  What a brave woman.
@GottaLaff They will refer to his aberrant conduct as "normal" boyish sexual play.  It's disgusting.  Meanwhile Blasey's reputation will be smeared.  Let's support her honesty and bravery.
@AaronBlake Brave woman, knowing her reputation will be smeared by the right, in 3,2,1.
@imillhiser But do they have the courage?  I sincerely hope so.  But, I seriously doubt that will be the case.
@aravosis We need non-stop pressure on the right to put this nomination aside, until there is full-vetting.  It's called shame the hell out of the GOP.  Unfortunately, is that even possible in the age of Trump?
@PhilipRucker @emmersbrown What a brave woman.  The right is going to smear her and she did this as a matter of civic responsibility.. Kudos to her.
@GenePark @alexburnsNYT I'd like to see Kavanaugh agree to  take a polygraph. But, that's never going to happen.

.@chrisgeidner is the cooperation deal between Trump's counsel &amp; Manafort defense null &amp; void?  Or will they continue to share info via any type of post-conviction relief?
It's sick that Americans voted for Trump, while his campaign manager is nothing more than a blatant &amp; admitted felon.  The bar for competence in anything associated with Trump is too damn low.
@brianbeutler I'd like to know what Manafort has left in his bank accounts?  How much money or property was he allowed to give his wife for her continued support?
@BradMossEsq @aravosis Like the rats they are.  They thought they were too smart to get caught.  Ha!!

@GottaLaff Flippity flip.  Which Trump felt Manafort would ever do.
@evanperez .I wish we could hear or watch Manafort's allocution.  I want to hear his shame.  Or maybe, like Trump, he has no shame?
Let's be reminded Trump believes,l Manafort, an admitted felon has an excellent character and is a good man. This is the bizarre world of Trump.

@matthewamiller I'm no longer easily shocked by Trump but his latest tweets are beyond callous and lacking all scientific evidence. I'd almost qualify them as evil.
@tomandlorenzo Trump is denying scientific data that shows people died from a lack of services &amp; medical care. His ignorance is unbelievable.
@BenjySarlin Scientific data supports the thousands of deaths related to lack of services &amp; medical care.  And Trump is supporting illogical bunk? Save us all from this moron.
According to Trump, those in Puerto Rico who died from lack of oxygen or supplies of insulin don't count.  I'm not easily shocked but Trump's ignorance in his latest tweet is unforgivable.   #HurricaneMaria

@HeerJeet Is anyone surprised?  These Trump supporters have been brain-washed/ under the spell of Stockholm Syndrome.
@PeteSouza Has Trump lost his mind? Something his defense attorneys are asking this morning.
Good god. Trump accusing media of starting war. It actually works the other way. Media scrutiny of war is their obligation, which can bring peace. His other tweets are similarly deranged.  It's lie, after lie, after lie.

@EugeneSurratt Bingo.
@EugeneSurratt Gene, you know I love you.  I enjoy conservative conversation.  There's not enough of bipartisan conversation in this nation.  Now, that's the true end of story.  But it should be the beginning.
@EugeneSurratt But the US "forced" Medicare on everyone 65 or older.  Yet, it remains the most popular program in the US. So, don't see a doctor if it's too burdensome for you, but don't apply for bankruptcy b/c when the bills come due &amp; have no insurance.  End of story.
@EugeneSurratt Health insurance works well in France, Switzerland and the Nordic countries for all citizens.  Everyone needs healthcare at some point in time.  For those who can't pay, others make up the difference. Why not insure every citizen? Medicare for All.
@jayrosen_nyu @nytimes The piece qualified for People Magazine, if that.  And I'm a @nytimes subscriber.  What does that say about me?

@washingtonpost .Rand Paul always plays the same game.  He questions the nominee and then relents.  What a bore.
@EugeneSurratt Where is there hubris in wanting healthcare for every citizen?
@AaronBlake .Exactly.   When will the Trump campaign ditch Rudy?   He's a blowhard and losing any type of credibility on his pretzel-like defense of Trump.
@susanorlean But then, I'm keenly aware it will soon end.

@MeetThePress Because Sam Nunberg has about as much credibility as Trump.  Birds of a feather. . .

Peter Nararro has always been a crank. He needs to apologize to the nation and on tv.  Not just Fox but CNN &amp; MSNBC. He needs to be shamed and removed from his position.  It's that simple.
@joshrogin @PostOpinions Thank you for your excellent coverage of the Summit. And discerning tweets.
@PetrePowder @clw4usa @WestWingReport A trump supporter?  Are you for real?
@markknoller Meaningless blather.
@kdrum @MotherJones What a waste of time &amp; my tax dollars.  It was  PR stunt.  Shame on Pompeo.
@digby56 Why does media continue to engage Trump with his bluster, hyperbole and lies? This was predictable.  I freakin' give up.  And I'm not one to bash media.
The only winner in the #TrumpKimSummit?  Singapore.  #tourism
@McFaul @Cirincione Beyond low bar. https://t.co/7VLJD1e1SE
@WestWingReport So, this entire meeting was pointless, except to provide positive PR for both Trump and Kim?
This was nothing more than a photo-op for both Kim and Trump. It sickens me. #TrumpKimSummit
@McFaul Indeed.  What a meaningless "agreement".
@ddale8 Who can believe Trump?  Less than 72 hours ago, he said his relationship with G7 countries was a 10.
@JohnBerman .Bottom line:  it's meaningless and nothing that hasn't been in the works before.
@McFaul As I said earlier, this a Nothing Burger.  By the way, no McDonald's franchise?  :)
@WestWingReport This is just more of the same thing.  Only worse b/c no one can trust Trump, let alone Kim.
Yeah, like that's going to be reliable. https://t.co/b0fcrNvwnJ
@speechboy71 A play date.  Who is gonna bring the Play-Doh?
@McFaul Everything about Trump is strange.
Trump treats @JustinTrudeau like crap but invites Kim to the WH and says they will meet multiple times? This isn't the America I know &amp; love.
@doctorskillet Let's check Ivanka's trademarks on that one.
Media should be upset this "letter" hasn't been released.  Where is the outrage? https://t.co/2bA21VFrXM
@doctorskillet It's worse than that.
@nickschifrin Trump also said his relationship with G7 nations was a 10.  The man lies. How can you trust anything he says?
@JDiamond1 This is so strange but goes along with Trump running a reality tv show.
It's obvious, Trump is more interested in a reality tv show than being transparent.  He's all about drama. #TrumpKimSummit Where is the signed document?
@Acosta @JayMcMichaelCNN Why?  Phones don't work?  This is bizarre.
Where is the document?  I pay your salary, Trump.  #TrumpKimSummit Stop the drama.
@ZekeJMiller Why?  This is bizarre.
@davidgura Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau is an ass?  I give up.
@McFaul After pm;u a few hours, who would even get a second date?  Let alone an invite to the White House.
.@KellyO has this right:  Art of the Tease by Trump.
@annafifield .Why wasn't it handed in advance, which the usual protocol?
@McFaul Trump is dragging this out, like a reality tv show.
RT @markknoller: "Today we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind," said Kim Jong-un at document signing with Pres. Tr‚Ä¶
@markknoller ,What about all the lives Kim has taken, not to mention his human rights abuses?
My tax dollars are going to pay for a Kim to visit the WH?  I work too hard to pay for a mass murderer to be there.
@WestWingReport This is crazy.  Inviting a despotic murderer to the WH?
Trump invites a despotic murderer to the WH but not me?  In fact, Trump won't even unblock me on twitter.  Calling Trump a pathological narcissist is horrible but Kim rates a WH visit?
@ddale8 Trump looked very uncomfortable during that question.
This is pathetic. https://t.co/rDA0qB7ZG4
@agearan Oh for gawd's sake.  I give up.
Trump invited that despot and murderer to the White House?  Tell me it's not true. #TrumpKimSummit
Trump developed a special bond with Kim but not so much w/our greatest allies?  What a sad day.
@HallieJackson It could be a cocktail napkin but in Trump's view it's HUGE.
What the hell are they signing? #TrumpKimSummit
Trump is being very secretive about this alleged "historic document".  The reality tv show continues.
@nycsouthpaw I thought it was all about getting a McDonald's franchise?  :)
@goldengateblond @Karoli They're setting up play dates.
@markknoller I wouldn't want to leave my fingerprints there either. It could come back to bite him. :)
@annafifield Cocktail napkins?
@markknoller By now, Trump must be very bored.  He has the attention span of a gnat.
I rarely complain about media but what bugs me the most, is their inability to discern Trump as a liar &amp; taking his comments as fact.
Oh for gawds sake, CNN is rerunning footage from that crazy Dennis Rodman interview.  Byeeeeeeeeeeeee.
@jimsciutto @jeffzeleny Big Nothing Burger.
Hey @ChrisCuomo Trump also said his relationship with G7 nations was a 10.  Why do you believe anything he says?
@tarapalmeri @yashar Rodman said Kim is a big kid.  So, it makes sense.
@speechboy71 Matthews is an idiot.  What a waste of punditry.
@brianstelter @ChrisCuomo That's a fact.
@nycsouthpaw Tiptoe Through The Tulips.
@ZekeJMiller How long will it take for Trump to unsign it in a pique of temper?  He unsigned the G7 Communique.
@brianstelter How can anyone trust Trump's signing something?  He unsigned the G7 Communique.
@AllenMcDuffee @ChrisCuomo :)
@gabrielsherman .And Rodman said Kim Jong Un is a big kid.  So much for meaningful analysis.
@lrozen This is a 3 ring circus.
@Shoq @ChrisCuomo For gawds sake, Rodman is crying.  This is such a circus.
@Karoli CNN isn't any better.  They're actually interviewing Dennis Rodman.  I frickin' give up!
Talk about a nothing burger.  #TrumpKimSummit
@dpleasant This is such a sham. And flying the US and NK flags together?
@AndrewBeatty @lrozen He wasn't too tired to lie his ass off on CNN on Sunday.
@skrspooky I have no sympathy for Kudlow.  He's a liar but I'd never wish death upon him.
@jimcramer @JakeSherman He lied his ass off on Sunday on CNN.  Let's address that.  OK?
@digby56 Energized.  Frankly, I thought he was back on cocaine.
@jdawsey1 I thought he was back on coke, given his interview on CNN on Sunday.
@PhilipRucker Maybe, Kudlow would be healthier if he hadn't spent so much time on Sunday, lying his ass off.  Just a thought.
@JakeSherman Wow. All that lying on CNN on Sunday didn't help his health.
Just a reminder to CNN &amp; MSNBC.  Quit your fawning over this despicable man. https://t.co/HHmfeLlHpF
@jimsciutto @jeffzeleny .Yeah, cause those warnings have really helped in the past.  Did they put it on a big card to remind Trump?
@ZekeJMiller I know it's your job and all, but quit hyperventilating.  Thanks in advance.
Must see tv. Looking at empty streets in Singapore. https://t.co/t8CIZVZp6d
Now CNN is talking about Kim's weight.  Could this get any more banal?
@PorettiRobert @ZekeJMiller I'm sure Ivanka already has a trademark for them.
Hey, @camanpour stop being so captivated by Kim.  Your words not mine.  Just. Stop. It. #CNN
Kim Jong Un can't even pay his own hotel bill &amp; Singapore is on the line for many costs but CNN &amp; MSNBC are treating him as if he's the second coming.  I give up with all the fawning over this meet &amp; greet.
@stefsstuff @MSNBC @BWilliams @maddow I did a similar thing yesterday.  Just to get away from all the cable bs,  I watched the last 6 episodes of Endeavour again.   It really helps.
@stefsstuff @MSNBC @BWilliams @maddow CNN isn't any better.  The fawning over Trump and Kim is despicable.
@davidfrum Similar thing for Trump's airline. A complete failure.
Please, someone tell Trump there were "real deals" in the past with NK.  NK broke those deals. Why is a Trump deal any different?
@splcenter I am in mourning for what was once our wonderful nation.
What in the hell is wrong with @DanaBashCNN?  She's going out of her way to support Crazy Trump. I give up.
@jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Unfortunate?  How about wildly ridiculous and harmful?
Bring our border children back!  They deserve to be united with their families. There's no excuse for this.  GOP - Party of family values?  Not so much.
@DianeToucan We need an emoji for #TrumpShitShow
.@KatyTurNBC please stop saying Trump is transactional. He's a small-minded petty reactionary. Similar to a toddler. It's all about his narcissism.
@joshtpm @TPM Was Nixon WH as corrupt at this one?  I'm not sure.
.@JRubinBlogger is so right. All @marcorubio is doing is tweeting about Chick-Fil-A.  How pathetic is that? #MSNBC
@JoeMyGod OMG! ü§¢ü§Æ
@EdKrassen Narvarro is a crank.  Everyone knows that including GOP, but they're loathe to admit it.
@JoyceWhiteVance .As you well know, people are often convicted on circumstantial evidence.  Let's keep our fingers crossed on this.
We know this about denying Democratic voters.  How pathetic. https://t.co/ierfHUZzqH
@Taniel It took my liberal state (CA) to get there. We need inclusiveness. This is horrible, denying people the right to vote.
@Shoq @owillis @MeghanMcCain At least, Trump doesn't block.  Although, on second thought, that may good.  It's a bitch having to work around that block.  And I'm a nice.  How did I get into this?  I called him a pathological narcissist, which is factually true.  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@sevdaktmn @foodwishes That looks good. Thanks for sharing.
This is a carnival, bedlam w/Rodman arriving.  Doesn't media get that?  Why promote chaos?  #TrumpKimSummit
Why is #MSNBC giving Dennis Rodman publicity?  This is just another one of his stunts.
@DutchRM I had no idea. Oh yes, I remember him. Cutest thing ever.  I need you to keep me relevant. Thanks.
@DutchRM You're the best researcher ever.
@DutchRM Thank you. Good find.  I guess they still have time to "deep throat" each other and pretend everything is great.  ü§¢
@The_Borg_Queen_ @MSNBC De-stress and you have the perfect recipe. Hell, I went back to work just to get away from Trump.  It's far easier and more relaxing than hearing about him 24/7.  You have a great time.  You deserve it.  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@DutchRM Good info.  I didn't know the specifics. Dotard needs his blankie, which he left in the WH. ü§£
@RNicholasBurns So, how will Trump define success of the summit? A poorly planned &amp; loosely written agreement to denuke?
@The_Borg_Queen_ You have a great time.  My only advice:  indulge, indulge, indulge.
@JRubinBlogger .Again, they're only speaking to an audience of one.  What happened to representing and helping "we the people"?
Web of elite Russians met with NRA execs during 2016 campaign https://t.co/8ZR9MS8iEo  This is reprehensible.
@DutchRM Yes, that's what Mitchell just said on MSNBC. I guess he's going to leave shortly after his meet and greet with Kim.  Remember, he said the summit could possibly go on for a few days?
@emmartin173 But, I expect more from Pompeo.  He's a smart man, unlike Trump, with a fantastic education, who is shaming himself with constant sucking up to Trump. I give up. This entire admin is in shambles.
So, now Trump is going to leave the #KimTrumpSummit early?  As if we couldn't have predicted this.
@SenatorDurbin @SpeakerRyan As if that's going to happen.  But good to try.
I love @AliVelshi &amp; @SRuhle.  They breakdown financial issues into easily understandable information. Thanks. #MSNBC
Can't we slap a huge tariff on Trump and make it impossible for him to return from Singapore?
@PhilipRucker Your question to Pompeo was important. He's obviously embarrassed about Trump's conduct but unable to say that.
@TPM Trump needs psychiatric help.  This is beyond bizarre.
@willripleyCNN @joshrogin @camanpour North Korea can't even pay their own way and we're taking this country seriously?  As an equal partner?  I give up.
Pompeo setting the standard for #Summit #NorthKorea #LowBar https://t.co/E8Dym9hsZz
@GoAngelo And it's never about policy. Trump sycophants will support him no matter if he changes his mind in an hour. It's cult-like.
It's obvious to everyone, Trump isn't mentally stable. https://t.co/79wtkcz3T1
It's morning in Singapore.  No doubt, Trump is on a  Provigil bender &amp; indulging in his extreme narcissism. Maybe, he can take a shower today, &amp; get into a clean suit? He's so slovenly appearing.
@ddale8 Was Kudlow high?  He sure seemed "energized".
@rolandscahill Skin doesn't usually blanch that way, unless there's underlying problem with edema.  I don't think Trump is very healthy.
@jonathanchait .And no one is stopping Trump.  The GOP is impotent.  Shame on them.

@GlennKesslerWP @Neil_Irwin But, Trump lacks comprehension, especially if it means he might have to backtrack on his ridiculous assertions.  Remember, his ego comes first, facts last.
@RBReich Why does Trump need to sit down?
@politico Facts and figures?  Who needs those? Trump goes by "feel".  :)
@jdawsey1 This is so sweet.  @Bourdain could be a real mensch.
@paulkrugman .All of American policy is based on Trump's narcissism.  This can't continue.
@joshrogin If it wasn't clear prior to today, it is now:  we elected an idiot for president.
John Harwood is rightly worried about Trump's state of mind.  Yes, so am I.
This is crazy.  Trump is showing off his paranoia.  What a gift to North Korea.
@Bencjacobs Pffffffffffffffffffffft.
Is Trump on drugs?  "My touch, my feel, it's what I do."
Isn't everyone getting sick and tired of Trump bashing CNN?
@JohnJHarwood What's with blaming Obama for Crimea?
OH, FFS.  Trump is blaming Obama for Crimea?  What the hell?
@brianstelter I admired and respect @Bourdain so much &amp; never missed his shows.  So tragic &amp; condolences to his family, friends and loved ones.  Thanks for your CNN coverage.  It means a lot.
@rolandscahill I torn between crying and screaming. He felt like a friend. Devastating for his friends and family. Especially his young daughter.
@HBK112 I felt like he was part of my family. I loved that man.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking.
@matthewamiller OMG.  This is devastating news. Condolences to his friends and family.
@mkraju .Does Trump get to see it in advance?
@MichaelAvenatti Shame on Rudy.  We know @StormyDaniels to be intellectually bright s and honest.  Give her our best.
Of course, this presser is all about Trump.  What a pathetic president.
@SupermanHotMale I plan more when I go to a new gas station.  Not so much, with Trump.
@JoeMyGod .That shrieking banshee should be locked up.  Not AG.
Trump doesn't read &amp; has the attention span of a gnat.  So of course, he hasn't prepared for the meeting with Kim. Nuclear weapons are mere play things in Trump's arsenal for good ratings.
@brianschatz I'm an RN and prepare hours for family conference/care meetings. Can you imagine if I walked with just "attitude"?  My god, Trump is such a dumpster fire.
@CathyinCO @lrozen I'll stick with Sessions.  Good lawd.  Did I just write that?  üòÖ
@PeterAlexander What?  Attitude?  Trump is a sick puppy and has no business being president.
@lrozen I would think her latest speeding (driving) fiasco would nix all her grandiose plans.
@jbendery Let's ask him about the War of 1812.  Can't you just imagine the buffoonery?

It's going to be another day in hell.  Starting off the day watching @KellyannePolls on CNN. Why is she on tv?
@maggieNYT .Like a baby, Trump is constantly self-soothing, no matter the cost.  Is there some way, we could get him some mental health care?
@jdawsey1 No one in their right mind believes that.
@jeffzeleny He said this again?  Trump is clueless.
@ZekeJMiller @maggieNYT .I'm still blocked by Trump and all I did was call him a "pathological narcissist".  I call that telling the truth.
I went to vote this morning &amp; the polling place was full.  This heartens me given I live in a secure Democratic district.  We Dems are out in force!
@GottaLaff And nothing will come of this.  It makes me ill.

@jbarro If she declines the pardon, I'll buy her books and home goods.
@CorissaRowlands @AshleyRParker Of course, you're correct.  But it's so obvious.  Does Trump ever play his cards close to the vest?
@lrozen There could be a new TV Spinoff of Apprentice.  Pardons R Us.
@The_Borg_Queen_ I was just thinking the same thing.  He sounds like an idiot.
@AshleyRParker I can understand Martha Stewart but Blago?  What the heck?

@TeresaKopec Thank you.  I'm an RN &amp; was concerned over Melania's extended hospital stay. But, now this is getting ridiculous &amp; I pay taxes to support her stay at the WH.  We deserve the truth, not more Trump/Melania trolling.

@lrozen Shame on us &amp; our system of juris prudence for immigrants.
I pay the taxes that help house @FLOTUS at the WH. Why can't she be honest about her condition?  Why is she in hiding? I demand to know.  Hear that media? @brianstelter

@AmandaMarcotte Bingo.   I'm an RN &amp; was seriously concerned for her health, given the long hospitalization.  But, now it's becoming a joke.

@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse You're in hiding.  Why is that?  Your husband is a liar.  Why should we believe you?

@techweenie Now, that's funny.  I needed a good laugh. Thanks.
@Bencjacobs That's his Axe thickening shampoo talking.
@WestWingReport ABC made the correct decision.  But they never should have employed her in the first place.  She's always been beyond bizarre and prone to conspiracy theories.  Good riddance.
Trump Asked Sessions to Retain Control of Russia Inquiry After His Recusal https://t.co/ztYPUycNqT  Obstruction.  Plain and simple.
@rolandscahill Her staff said today she has been taking meetings.  But where?

@lrozen I'm so confused.  How about you?  :)
Roseanne Barr Crosses a Line, and ABC Draws One https://t.co/6gdwm3zE1G  Hear, hear.
@chasbottom Wrong.  All of America cares.  Your hyperbole is crazy.  Day drinking again?
@GlennThrush Trump will just call it "fake news".
@jennpozner @JamilSmith Roseanne sold it and so did Trump.  I'm not letting him off the hook, either.
@tomtomorrow I'm with you on the "no" vote.
@ianbremmer Brevity is the soul of wit.
If only we could fire Trump as quickly as ABC got rid of Roseanne.
@JohnAmato @RoseanneOnABC Waiting for Sara Gilbert to fold.

@chasbottom your GF, Roseanne Barr had her show cancelled.  So much for progressive thought dying.
@joshtpm Why?  We know why.  Because at heart, he's a coward.
@ray8686 @brianstelter That is true.  They did wake up.  Finally.
@brianstelter Best news!   Good for ABC.  They did the right thing.
Fantastic. https://t.co/pGEzIsUHKu
@soledadobrien Let's be honest.  Barr is a racist.
@dpleasant Indeed.  And Joe wrote a ridiculous op-ed today in WaPo about Dem voters, yet refuses to take responsibility for his part in the election of Trump.
@dpleasant @morningmika @ABC Point taken, but Barr's tweets are worse.
@chasbottom why are you always so angry? You have the president you wanted, both houses of Congress &amp; yet, you still biatch non-stop.  Liberal policies &amp; successful states like CA aren't going away. Getting stronger by the day.
@brianstelter Good.  I hope this is just the beginning.
@chasbottom I live in the real world, in California.  Things are great here.  Get your head out of your arse.
@chasbottom Stop selling BS.  Don't you have some Rosanne Barr tweets you'd like to fave?
@gazoscreek @HeerJeet Wear it proudly.  Trump blocked me.  Kinda the same thing.  :)
@HeerJeet Exactly.  I expect the worst from Roseanne Barr but ABC needs to be humiliated into action.
@chasbottom 5th largest economy in the world.

@Taffy_Tart @elyzajayne @ColMorrisDavis Thanks.
@MoElleithee Any word yet from ABC?
@MattGertz Congrats.  Have fun with the new baby and enjoy!!
@ColMorrisDavis @TheDemocrats @owillis has been trying to point this out for a long time.  We all need to wake up.
@elyzajayne @ColMorrisDavis No, I have not.  I'm never profane on twitter.  All I tweeted at Trump was that he's a pathological narcissist, which tells me, at some level it's an acknowledgment that I'm correct.
@frontlinepbs @anjalitsui And yet, Trump continues to lie about this.
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump At one time, I thought Trump was capable of controlling his narcissism.  No longer, which is why I correctly referred to him as a pathological narcissist.  He also blocked me for stating that.
I detest Trump but refuse to be angry 24/7. If I give in, he'll win. Not me. Get out there and vote Dem!

@owillis It's accurate to say Trump lies.  If he corrected his lies, I'd be more prone to accept the term "misstatements".
@joanwalsh @CNN @ReliableSources @brianstelter If Trump bothered to correct his lies, I'd be more willing to call them misstatements.

@CillizzaCNN Everyone writes that.  Don't you have anything interesting to offer?
@JamesFallows Everything about Trump is abnormal.  My concern is media seems to forget that and offers  a low bar when it comes to Trump.

No one is plotting against Trump. Can we say he's paranoid?  Come on media.  Step up.
@lrozen That's beyond absurd. They forgot they were negotiating with N. Korea?  Oh. my. goodness.  The breadth of their inexperience is startling.
@emptywheel It's very easy to do.  Pull one end and cut the other. Just keep it all very clean.
@agearan We knew that.  It sounded like a teen love letter.
@Yamiche .We could tell.  It sounded like a teen love letter.
Just watched last epi of The Americans. I'm confused. So many peripheral narratives.  Only 1 epi to go. How will this all wrap up?
This is a joke.  Trump has done nothing but degrade Gold Star families.  ü§Æü§ÆAnd now he gives the Medal of Honor to true heroes?
@chasbottom I really don't bash that moron as much as I should.  And I don't ridicule others.
@LeonAndJune @mastersdelight Embrace joy.  Life's too short to do anything other.
@chasbottom I guess you forgot, I have a real job.  Still. . . you're afraid of a truth teller?
@YesBiscuit I hereby demand an answer.  If only that would help.  :)
@lrozen your tweets are important &amp; always informative.  Thank you.
@chasbottom you didn't follow back. It must be tough being a little snowflake and so skeered of differing opinions.  üôÉ
How degrading for  true military heroes  to receive Medal of Honor from Trump McSpurs.
Trump is giving military advice.  Oh lawd.
Trump McSpurs is praising the military.  I may vomit.

Memo to Trump:  no one except you is calling it SPYGATE.
Trump does little or nothing to deal with gun violence, yet focuses on MS-13.  The man is a moron.
I understand Trump's end game to tarnish Russia probe but SPIES?  Come on.  This is beyond bizarre.
Trump is paranoid.  Spies?  Really?
@elianayjohnson @PhilipRucker Does Trump hereby demand changes?  :)
@chasbottom How did such a well-educated man become such an idiot?

Carter Page is on CNN.  Good grief.

@chasbottom I'm well aware of the appeals process.  No death penalty?  No extended appeals.  Plus, there are extra costs associated with death row.  I pay the bills, you don't.
Everyone who surrounds Trump is corrupt.  It's almost unbelievable.  When your personal attorney is a thug, and engages thugs. . . End of story.
@chasbottom I pay the taxes to keep those people on death row.  It's over a $1 mil per death row inmate.

@JoshDorner I'm waiting for the indictment and arrest of Don Jr.  At least!

@Acosta @PressSec So much for the Trump administration commitment to reducing gun violence.  It's all a game of charades for them.
@chasbottom Benghazi cost over $7 million and no one was indicted.
@CathyinCO There was no Obama corruption. I may not agree with GOP policies but aligning with Trump is wrong. The man is an amoral pig.

@TheRickWilson As do all rational people.  But why wasn't Trump at her side, or with her when she awakening from anesthesia? Odd.
@DutchRM Yes.   But staying the hospital for almost a week is bizarre. She goes home to 24/7 care at the WH.  Something doesn't add up.  #NurseSleuth
@aravosis I assume holding her hand in the recovery room  while coming out of anesthesia wasn't on Trump's mind.  Why?  No photo-ops?
Sounds like @Flotus has a type of kidney tumor.  Staying in the hospital for almost a week is unusual   I wish her a speedy recovery.

@joshrogin @RepEdRoyce Trump's disdain &amp; jealousy over Obama will override all critical and sensible thinking.  How sick is that?
@jennpozner @NewYorker I disagree.  I don't believe that's why he became AG.  Doctors who abuse drugs or their patients don't go into the profession for that express purpose.  It's a crime of opportunity.
@jennpozner His abuse was probably far more subtle and chronic than is known.  That's what makes him so dangerous and able to leap to physical abuse with such alacrity.
@GlennThrush Does Melania do this on purpose to try and embarrass her husband's administration or is she just ignorant?
@chasbottom No.  Don't twist what I'm saying.  Dems were quick to respond to Eric Schneiderman, whereas cons like you, refuse to call out sexual deviant, Trump.  Instead, you support him.
@chasbottom 19 women have said he sexually assaulted them.  There's bound to be a minor in there.  And don't forget Ivanka.  He still lusts after her.  #sicko

@dpleasant Jackson is denying all allegations but at this point, how could he effectively lead the VA?  The mind reels.
@dpleasant Bingo!
The sheer chutzpah of Dr. Ronny Jackson to think his past wouldn't come out.  Hubris and then some.  Typical of Trump administration.
@pbump I'm an RN, married to a physician &amp; was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But this is beyond the pale, not to mention illegal.
New Allegations Emerge Against Ronny Jackson as White House Digs In https://t.co/mWpqtUFuGb  It's over for Dr. Ronny.  The End.
@Acosta Indeed.  It's an appalling record.
I stand with @Acosta in his completely appropriate questions to @PressSec  #CNN
Use of Provigil &amp; Ambien for long travel is standard but records have to be kept for medications dispensed.  That's the issue.  It appears Ronny Jackson didn't do that.
@GottaLaff She's really spinning and lying today.  I guess that's not new.  üòÇ
Trump clearly said with regard to Ronny Jackson, experience is an issue.
@Yamiche Forget being drunk.  There's no drinking while a physician or nurse is on duty.  End of story.
OMG.  That @PressSec is pretending there was a thorough vetting process of Ronny Jackson.  She such a liar.

@CillizzaCNN Trump also channels that vetting is an egregious process that no one should have to withstand.
@LisaDNews He's also suggesting no one should be vetted.  That's it's too difficult.
Macron sounds so reasonable compared to Fat Boy Prez.

@TheRickWilson High as a kite when he gave the presser abt Trump's checkup.
Per CBS abt Ronny Jackson:  ‚ÄúImproperly dispensing medicine‚Äù and ‚Äúexcessive drinking‚Äù are some of the allegations that have stalled the confirmation of VA secretary nominee Ronny Jackson, who said Trump was in ‚Äúexcellent health. Trump selects only the best.  Sad!
I guess it can be inferred that Ronny Jackson was high as kite when he gave that weird health checkup about Trump.  CBS alleges misuse of drugs, drinking, etc.
Doesn't the WH vet their candidate?  #RonnyJackson  Concerns about him are so serious they can't hold a hearing.  Improper conduct?  Improper oversight?

@GottaLaff You're affirming Pres. Obama's gracious behavior.  That's as it should be.

@DanaHoule But most who dismiss their attorneys, don't make out well legally.  Is Trump aware that turmoil of attys only give Mueller more time?  The man is a dolt.

@RobertMackey @Lawrence And how many would want to carry on campus? My nephew is a teacher &amp; occasional hunter.  No way, will he bring firearms into the school. His targets are food the family can eat, not people.

@owillis @CNN CNN is the worst conservatives/Trump defenders.  Aren't they aware of this? Is it callous indifference? Ratings &amp; controversy?  Help me out here.
I assume Trump gets aroused reading print pieces about his sexual assaults. He's a sick man.

@NBCPolitics .Trump has been running for president for over a decade.  The rest of Trump's tweet is beyond crazy.
A reporter just shouted out a question to Trump:  "Do you feel vindicated?"  Media being ridiculous.
@GottaLaff @thedailybeast "Unwitting" today, "witting" tomorrow.  It's just a matter of time.

@dpleasant Remember, all the times Trump would praise Bernie?  Using the same playbook, coordinated effort? If it walks a duck. . .
@maggieNYT .Awaiting a Trump tweet claiming it's all a hoax and/or fake news.
@ddale8 @GottaLaff It's sane to avoid early news reports. Eventually, the truth will come out.   Why be wrong so early into the investigation?
@BruceBartlett .He'll just blame Dems.  That's Trump default position.
Watching CNN.  My heart is breaking.  Meanwhile, Congress &amp; Trump do nothing to end gun violence.
His desire to gut our social safety net is what makes Paul Ryan pure evil. https://t.co/qZ4I008dMT
@justinjm1 There are too many damn firearms in this country.  If only, we could institute a buy-back program, as they did in Australia &amp; new regs about owning/buying new firearms.  I know, it's a dream...
@KagroX .No doubt, a Whitman Sampler for mother.
Trump is a coward.  He can't face the nation knowing NRA donations to his campaign are a source of continued gun violence in this nation. https://t.co/iKPn7CNhg1
Florida must be forced to pay all medical care &amp; family needs that are necessitated by those injured in today's shooting &amp;  all funeral costs &amp; family/friend travel expenses.  If they're hit hard enough financially, maybe Florida would change their lax gun laws.
@GottaLaff But Hillary's emails.   I 'effin' give up with the hypocrisy by GOP/Trump admin.
@peterdaou Let's start with allowing CDC to study the issue of gun violence.
@davidhldunn @imillhiser He has a Ph.D in history &amp; is a professor. His students &amp; friends are well he's American. But when meeting people in the local pub, he's too embarrassed to say he's a US citizen.
@MittRomney .How about a promise to NEVER take money from the NRA?
@imillhiser It's become a huge embarrassment. My son lives in London and will often say he's from Canada, to avoid the fallout.  How sad is that?
@cliffschecter Marco Rubio should be forced to view every dead body &amp; attend every autopsy of those killed by gun violence.  Then, he may finally see this disaster, as it really occurs. Not whitewashed.  The ugly, unvarnished truth of gun violence.
@lrozen He's afraid of sitting next to the "regular" folks?  Well, well...
@EricBoehlert @FLGovScott @NRA I will never visit Florida again.
@owillis Every member of Congress should be forced to view raw photos of gun violence victims, as well as their autopsies.  Maybe, then they'll do something.  Nah, who am I kidding?
I just got home from work - was so busy today, didn't hear about this horrific school shooting.  Sending love to all involved and my complete disdain &amp; disgust for every member of Congress in their failure to address &amp; curb the glut of gun violence in the US.
@pbump He's such a cute little feller.  Happy Valentine's Day, Thomas.

@PhilipRucker @KatyTurNBC Trump's incapable of having compassion for abused women.
All Trump had to say was he's upset &amp; sorry for the pain experienced by Porter's ex-wives.  That's not difficult.  Trump is amoral.
@danpfeiffer .Trump lacks compassion &amp; empathy.  He's a sick man.
@DeanObeidallah Trump lacks an empathy gene.  Sick, sick man.
@CillizzaCNN .A total &amp; complete lack of compassion for the pain of the women involved.  Trump's a sick man.

@GottaLaff John Kelly, Chief of Staff, commented:  'Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.'		Gawd, I hate these people!
@aravosis @JohnJHarwood Thanks. Trump's taste is so horrible he doesn't understand trimming the back would make it appear fuller.  But like everything, Trump chooses to disguise his deficiencies, instead of addressing them "head on".  #PunInteded
@aravosis @JohnJHarwood Men don't lose their fringe hair. Hair transplants (donor sites) are taken from the typical back/occipital fringe area.  If it's real, Trump certainly has bizarre male pattern alopecia.
Is this real?  If so, this is gross.  I wonder what's growing under all Trump's back- comb-overage? https://t.co/e1FDvY2x0c
"Plugged In" with Greta Van Susteren?  VOA should reconsider the name of the show.  More like "Unplugged Caspar Milquetoast to interview incredibly banal people".   https://t.co/pFiRyni6Jj
@CathyinCO @BarackObama We will have to agree to disagree.
Watching Biden on CNN, I'm overwhelmed by the gravity of our nation's loss of norms, critical &amp; progressive thinking, which was so ably demonstrated by @BarackObama administration. Under Trump, our nation is in disarray &amp; heading down the path of authoritarianism.
@brianschatz Nothing more than a TrumpVanityParade.  My WWII vet dad is appalled by this.
Does anyone truly believe Trump has the attention span,  let alone the ability to read or comprehend the Dem's 10-page memo?
@bobcesca_go Strict laws against nepotism.
@kylegriffin1 .Everything is being treated like a damn reality tv show.
@oliverdarcy This type of parade would only make Trump look more impotent.  Doesn't he understand that?
@pbump How about Trump goes to France and doesn't return?
@dpleasant OMG. It's all about feeding  Trump's crazed ego.  Can't someone rein him in?  Doesn't he understand the political fallout from this type of military display?  I hate to be hyperbolic, but little by little, we're becoming more N. Korea than USA.

@brianstelter This is a huge nothing burger.
@dpleasant Indeed. I must have my phone at work, but in a hospital setting it's easy to lose or drop, so that's why I go with an older model.  It does everything I need it for, pics of family, streaming, etc.  I'm a bit too practical.
@dpleasant I'm holding onto my iPhone 6 even though I can write a new phone off my taxes.  It just seems wrong to keep upgrading for naught.
@RamonasVoices @NicolleDWallace Indeed.  Also @jheil
Don't trash me but I really like @NicolleDWallace's show. She does her homework &amp; is taking on Trump. Plus, great guests. My 88-yr old mom agrees.  #MSNBC

@Atrios Can we put him in a box and send him far, far, away?
@jdickerson That's a beauty!

Merry Christmas üéÑüéÅ to everyone. And may the New Year bring you joy &amp; peace. https://t.co/AplqzAFNJC
Trump needs a mental status check STAT. There was never a war on Christmas, except in the inner depths of Trump's mind.
@Green_Footballs A complete dotard move.  Even is base is laughing at the old fool.
@TeresaKopec We continue that tradition, even with grown kids  &amp;  some are away.  We recall special memories with our children. It's lovely.
Before Trump was pres, I remember the time I was close to being arrested &amp; hauled off to jail for saying "Merry Christmas".  We've all had that experience.  Right? üòÇ
@pbump I'm Jewish and have always said "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" when trying to combine Christmas &amp; New Years wishes.  Even his base is aware this is a non-issue. Why does he play stupid?
@sdkstl @brianstelter @MSNBC @joanwalsh @NBCNews Shame on @MSNBC.
@tommyxtopher @MSNBC @joanwalsh @MarkHalperin And Happy Holidays to you.
@tommyxtopher @MSNBC @joanwalsh @MarkHalperin It makes me almost physically sick. And Mika tried to stick up for Halperin.  Where is the allegiance to Joan &amp; her major contributions to MSNBC? I hope CNN picks her up.

@NervyBastard @Karoli Hell, I left retirement &amp; went back to work just to get away from Trump.  Unfortunately, it hasn't really worked.  üòâ
@Karoli @NervyBastard This is so wrong &amp; the world is laughing at the US playing victim.  I may be ill.
@chasbottom have you seen the new film "Darkest Hour"? It's really good.  I think you'd like it.
@CathyinCO We had a wonderful Hanukkah and I'll be with  my grandson and all my kids on Christmas.  So, it will be fun.  You take care.
@CathyinCO If I don't see you in the next few days, have a great Christmas and Happy New Year.
@CathyinCO Corrupt?  Let's talk about the swamp that Trump was going to drain.
@chasbottom Calm down.  Or take your meds.  Thanks.  üòâ
@CathyinCO I don't think I'm over-reacting.  As a person, she's fine. But now she's claiming we can withhold funds from UN.  It's crazy.
Is this the first time US has played victim?  #UN #NikkiHaley
This UN speech by Nikki Haley isn't going well.
@chasbottom Wrong again, Kreskin.
Nikki Haley playing US victim?  Oh fer gawds sake.
@chasbottom She's "making a list, checking it twice, gonna find out..." I'm disgusted by Trump admin.
Nikki Haley is taking names? WTF? https://t.co/XWyWJAYNrD
@chasbottom I file long form.  But, the question is:  why is he hiding his tax returns?  By the way, I calculated my taxes under new bill.  No savings for me. But, I'd rather pay more to ensure Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.  CA is thriving under higher taxes, unlike Kansas w/lower
Today, would be a great day to see those Trump tax returns?  What is he hiding?
@RepDanKildee @LOLGOP Trump &amp; Company has no shame.  Where are those damn tax returns of his? I wanna see 'em!!  STAT.
"The long tweets are not a benefit to society." says @AliVelshi Absolutely correct.  #Trump #MSNBC
@Gyggy @davidaxelrod They're called entitlements b/c generally people pay less in, than is paid out.  I should have qualified my statement.  Sorry.
@davidaxelrod I just calculated my tax "savings".  As I live in CA there is no benefit for me.  Frankly, I'd pay more to ensure entitlements like Medicare-Medicaid-Social Security remain untouched. California is a model state for increased taxes &amp; productivity.
Democrats Are the New Republicans https://t.co/rKhJx2LKJo We're far better than traditional Republicans which is why they should vote for Dems.

How did this tax bill get passed w/o seeing Trump's tax returns?  I'm disgusted.
@speechboy71 More free?   Who the hell is he trying to kid?
@NPR With or without alcohol?
This tax bill does nothing to lower my taxes. I live in CA. In fact, I'd pay more in taxes, if only the federal government could be as successful as here. #JerryBrown
@brontyman Thank you.  You're so sweet.  I'm having a Hanukkah party tonight &amp; moving on to Christmas.  Takes my mind off Trump.

@CathyinCO But I doubt they can do that.  I want everyone in Congress to be above criticism regarding sexual harassment.  Kick 'em all out.  But with Trump as president, how is that possible?  At least Pence isn't a perv, though he's beyond weird.  I just don't know.
What a sad day.  But an important day in taking the moral high ground.  #Franken
