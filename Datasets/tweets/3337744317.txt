@AnnCoulter Is your ugly ass really talking smack about the way somebody else looks
@RealCandaceO @AppleSupport @Android The Android is a democrat
@TomiLahren Your truth is!!!
@realDonaldTrump Coming from a 5 time draft dodger who criticizes war heroes
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends How about listing off the things you used to say before going right and haywire
@RealCandaceO Watching you be a Republican tool is fun stuff
And for the love of God will somebody remind @RealCandaceO that she is black.  She hates black people more then David Duke
Trump says your not a hero because you got captured, he prefers those who aren't captured.  I prefer my presidents not wearing a robe on the cover of a magazine laying on a bed like a dipshit.  To each his own I guess
@RealCandaceO Your her replacement you lost little wacko
I'm actually stuck now.  Does @AnnCoulter face look more like the Scream mask or a foot.  Tough call

@TomiLahren Attention seeking sinners
I just keep reminding myself that all these shit talking Trumpers will have to deal with life after Trump eventually.  That's gonna be an amazing time for a lot of people
It's so hard living in the middle of Trump town North Carolina.  I'm gonna lose my mind when the RNC takes over in 2020.  I've become an expert tongue biter
@ShadowingTrump @markjgreen Didn't we hear similar words towards North Korea and he ended up buddies with them. Trump is a tough talking pussy

@20indicia I think they need to drive home other issues.  So to answer your question yes I do get annoyed with the Russia topic but it doesn't mean I don't think it's a problem
@20indicia Honestly I think Trump is disgusting and I personally think he's as guilty as can be.  I just don't think anything will come of it.  They will never do anything to Trump it's obvious.  Democrats need to start to try to win elections and they aren't gaining votes talking Russia

@RealCandaceO Awe how cute, your a lost little girl and your finding a home

@AnnCoulter Your a crazy bitch
@RealCandaceO Token
@JAlexander319 @mr_anders39 @FoxNews @BarackObama So Obama couldn't get his supreme court nominee even considered because he was on the way out but he was supposed to jump into the hacking problem so Trumpsters could cry and say that there is a conspiracy against Trump being elected.  You hated Obama, you love Trump all bias
@AnnCoulter Instead of saying stupid things like it's spelled wrong use your platform to convince people that both the F.B.I. and I.C.E. are important
@AnnCoulter You a wacko
@realDonaldTrump So you'll admit that the Russians did something but don't do a damn thing about it.  Fuckin piece of shit
@TomiLahren Imagine if our country moved forward and stopped worrying about an irrelevant lady who lost the election.
@kailah_casillas Nope.  Go home!!!
@tedcruz @NancyPelosi And you wonder why this country is a mess.  Grow up.  It's one thing for everyday people to immaturely attack each other on Twitter but your a senator who ran for president.  Remember what it was like hearing about your wife and father.  You are all a bunch of idiots
@cuyler_edwards @matthewjdowd @Trumpnado2016 It definitely would have gone down a lot different.  The cop is incredibly incompetent
@real_PaulL When I see the word Russia I tend to ignore what's being said.  The left is killing themselves with that nonsense.  Used to be a Dem now I'm Independent and frustrated
@IndigoARose @matthewjdowd @Trumpnado2016 Absolutely.  The cop totally failed in that situation.  I just want to see everyone start being able to voice their opinion and other people just agree to disagree.  Now the guy was being aggressive as he kept getting in the women's face so this was a bad interaction
@real_PaulL ANTIFA is not the Democratic party.  That's the same thing as calling the KKK the Republican party
@real_PaulL @JohnEdwardBake1 @Dewitt4Congress You handled that well good for you.  Being fired is different then being hired
@matthewjdowd @Trumpnado2016 I'm in no way defending the guys actions but what he's doing is no different then what a lot of the left is doing when they interrupt people eating or giving a speech.  Everybody needs to step back and relax a little bit.  This is getting old
@RealDeanCain @RubinReport @prageru Did Mr. Rubin ever stop and think that maybe the right is more tolerant right now because their candidate won the election.  They weren't too tolerant when Obama was president.  Not saying that he isn't an interesting guy but he's overlooking a big part of the equation
@Rindoukan_DOJO @TomiLahren Very true.  It just becomes nonsense when your criticizing criticism because you have the right to.  Not what you would expect from self proclaimed intellectuals
@TomiLahren I thought the "Intellectual Dark Web" crew was all about preaching people being able to voice their opinion.  Not sure why he would be criticizing you.  I've been listening to their podcasts lately and although i like a lot of what they say they do tend to act superior.
There's going to be a serious change in my tweets.  Starting to realize how my mind had gotten stuck on the left and how hypocritical I was being
@RealCandaceO I was a leftist hardcore and I'm starting to realize that I'm more of an Independent for sure.  I just want to know why you went from the left to the right and now have such animosity towards the left?  Just curious not bashing you in any way
Stop arguing and start conversation with people.  I've been doing it lately and I've really learned a lot about not only other people's views but a heck of a lot about myself as well
As much as Trump bothers me, I do think we need to stop talking to people who agree with everything we think and start talking to people who disagree with you completely.  If we don't this country will never get to where we really could be

@wildlyirritable Got you beat.  The amount of money you make is irrelevant but I do very well.  Your an asshole it's apparent.  Get over yourself
@tony3879 @TomMorrisJr1 That cop was so ignorant and so are the people commenting who don't know the struggle that comes with getting clean
@wildlyirritable Don't be ignorant, I'm recovering, take suboxone and probably work three times as hard as you.  Don't speak if you don't know the truth
#LivePD calling someone on methadone or suboxone a drug addict is ignorant as can be.  The doctors hook addicts who need help on it
