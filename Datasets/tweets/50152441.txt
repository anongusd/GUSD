Anyone marching under a Confederate or Nazi flag deserves the scorn of #liberty-loving Americans.
Confederate statues should be taken down, but in a lawful way. Lincoln was right: No grievance is a fit object for redress by a mob.
Secession is ultimate rejection of America and rule of law. There are no American heroes in the Confederacy or its modern manifestations.
The bigotry that came to #Charlottesville is a rejection of the very principles on which our nation was founded.
