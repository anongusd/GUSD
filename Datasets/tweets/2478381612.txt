@allinwithchris @SenBlumenthal It's amazing liberals lie constantly, yet they are outraged when they think other people have lied, yet with liberals it's ok if they continue to lie.
@allinwithchris @SenBlumenthal It's amazing Mr. Blumenthal can't even tell us what he thought that Donald Trump Jr. lied to congress but can't even say what Mr. Trump allegedly lied about. Pathetic that liberals are persecuting people based on the testimony of a pathological liar.

@RealSaavedra Mrs. Northham was teaching those kids the horrors of being shaved.  Raw Cotten is not pleasant to handle let alone pick and kids are not shaved anymore, horrors of slavery must be taught to all children regardless of race.
@DonaldJTrumpJr If Mrs. Northam was trying to teach the kids about the horrors of slavery there is nothing wrong with doing that. It is my understanding that picking cotton was hell and the raw form of cotton horrible to handle, she just wanted to show the kids how awful it was.  Not racist.
