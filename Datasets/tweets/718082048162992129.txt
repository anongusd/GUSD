Most importantly, John Dingell has brought love, joy and meaning into the lives of all of us blessed to know him.  Godspeed, John. (5/5)
The world was a better place every single day John Dingell was in it.           	I am thankful for all that John Dingell has done for our country, and for his values—his impeccable integrity matches his immense accomplishments. (4/5)
John Dingell will go down in history as one of the true legislative icons in American history and knowing and learning from him will always be one of the highlights of my life. (3/5)
My life, like countless others, has been deeply enriched by knowing John Dingell. As a young legislative assistant to Tiger Teague in 1974, I could have never dreamed that I would one day be able to serve in Congress with John and have the privilege of his friendship. (2/5)
