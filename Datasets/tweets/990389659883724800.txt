@NedLamont I’d like to revisit this. How do you feel now that you’ve partly won thanks to purjury? Will you stand up for justice now as quick as you did for the fraudster? Some how I think you wont, for Democrats would not be Democrats without fraud and manipulation of the public mind.

@NewYorker They convince themselves farce is truth. Any psycologist can tell you repeated exposure to a memory changes how a brain replays the memory, slowly distorting the actual event, sometimes to the point that one makes up events yet completely believes them true. #Evidence is needed.
@NewYorker Another psychologist from left wing academia making ‘I think’ claims from 35 years ago. #StandYourGround, these people make up rules all the time to remove accountability &amp; place blame where they ‘think’ it belongs; which is almost never on themselves.
@thedailybeast And that would be #NATURAL #LAW AND #RIGHTS FOR ALL. Enforced, recognized and promoted by Government. No positive law necessary.
@thedailybeast The institution which touts #HumanRights around the world &amp; yet, considers them ‘soft law’; meaning they don’t enforce it. The #UN is global despotism wrapped up in a pretty facade; all an attempt to make America look bad and to task away what #WeThePeople have bled &amp; died for.
@brianstelter ‘Life upended by scrutiny of media’. I beg to differ; the media has fawned all over Ford, promoting her story as gospel, with no evidence, like partisan hacks. The people scrutinizing are truth seeking #Americans calling out a left wing plot to, yet again,undermine our authority.

@ChrisMurphyCT @Lj_maloney When it comes to reading the U.S. Constitution for what it says, Chris rejects the scripture saying “thats not what it really says, those words weren‘t what the writers meant; they actually meant, *proceeds to rewrite the USC and fill it with positive laws*.” #DefinitionOfATyrant

I understand the appeal of power, but despotism is a millennia old ideology whose ass got kicked in 1776.  It’s trying to make a come back. #NO!
@ChrisMurphyCT @Lj_maloney Oh trust me, the fear and desperation on display by the #DeepState is clear to all, even those who doubted a deep state existed. The fact that they fear #WeThePeople and our decision for POTUS says it all about how they think of us; #StupidPeasants. Sounds a bit like a...#Tyrant!

@danpfeiffer #Projection It is not the Republicans worrying about “wins” that were never democratically voted for but rather politically pushed through the courts. That would be Despotic Democrats. #WinInTheCourtsDieInTheCourt Try putting the “Democracy” you always tout that we are to work.
@nesteggPUB @danpfeiffer Are you implying that there are some in the GOP who are part and parcel to the Deep State? If so I completely agree. Those are the very #Cucks I was referring to; who do not stand up with the #SpiritOf76 against the #AntiAmerican loyalists infesting and corrupting our Republic.
@danpfeiffer Nothing the Republicans do will appease the lefts bias against America. They will always be seething in hatred that 1776 happened and that America told the old world political philosophy of despotism off. #StandYourGround. Don’t be a #Cuck and capitulate to tyrants.
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey Whether we agree or not is irrelevant to my observations of the words and tone to which you’ve spoken. But if agreement is what you look at, in truth, its quite obvious you don’t agree with what I’ve said by simply questioning it. The degree of disagreement is in the context.
@swin24 @GideonResnick Key word; Accused.		Notice the lack of the word; Guilty.		BIG difference. Nice try though. Keep up the tasking; you don’t realize how much it gives your loyalty and philosophical positions away to Americanists and #WeThePeople.

And let me be clear; these Democrats, while legally American Citizens, are NOT &amp; DO NOT hold Americanism as their value system. They’re loyalists to Despotism and seek to rule over us with positive law rather than abide by Natural Law. #AntiAmerican They’re upset we won in 1776.
This #Kavanaugh debacle from the Democrats is no surprise. They’re the party of pushing sex changes at 6 years of age, not investigating pedophilia or killing babies. They’re tasking us in hopes to divide &amp; hold Americans accountable for their actions before they’re born.
@schmodiddly @CJPatruno @joncoopertweets @BarackObama Cringe all you want. Task #AntiAmerican values to Americanism all you want. 		I will still fight for government to recognize that their only job is to protect Natural law and your Natural Rights; not create positive law, which only bolsters despotism. #TrueAmerican #SpiritOf76
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey I observed you question the existence of our creation/creator as the source of moral authority. To question this is to question lifes meaning. A far cry from believing &amp; questioning. Using the information observed, I deduced #Nihilism’s in your realm of philosophy. No assumption.
Editorial: Bob Stefanowski’s Tax-Cut Promise Needs Details https://t.co/BfnBDwWzst		Now call upon #NewTaxNed for details about his proposals or this article is just more proof Media is biased #FakeNews looking to manipulate the populaces opinion rather than simply inform.
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey One can not assume an observation, they can merely observe, horrifying as that may be. 		The Rights afforded to us, such as free speech/thought, is an observation only recently recognized by (Thanks to USA!) governments, not an assumption.		No Creator? Are you &amp; I real? #Nihilism
@CJPatruno @joncoopertweets @BarackObama I also just want to point our for the record that we are a democratic-REPUBLIC. As in a REPUBLIC with democratic process’. To say we are a Democracy is demonstrably false and #AntiAmerican.
@CJPatruno @joncoopertweets @BarackObama First, I didn’t reference what religion I hold. God is a generic term referring to the Creator that gives us Natural Laws and Rights. Nice try tasking me to a book of rules I don’t follow.		Second, if you believe all which you say, how do you believe Obama upholds any of that?
@schmodiddly @CJPatruno @joncoopertweets @BarackObama The God that gives you Natural Laws and Rights? The one that is fundamental to our freedom? The only people I know against that God are despotic Europeans and their loyalists looking to undo the movement started in 1776.
@lmaxwell223 @amjoyshow When your mission is to task a person trying to control the situation with bigotry, it makes sense to make the situation complete chaos and then label the effort to control the situation as bigotry. In reality, that strategy is known as #FakeNews manipulation.
@kylegriffin1 @AshaRangappa_ Truth is treason in an empire of lies.		Even though #FakeNews try as they might to gaslight what is and isn’t truth, #WeThePeople know what is and isn’t truth. You cannot tell me the thorn(overbearing gov’t) in my side is in my foot and actually a be stinger. I can see the thorn!
@MarshallCohen I’ve seen some of the decisions these ‘judges’ have made. Completely illegal, #AntiAmerican and #AntiConstitution. #Unnatural 	They seem to use there positions to try tasking America with European Despotism because most (Europeans at heart) are still sore over the loss in 1776.
@KamalaHarris #FakeNews If you want election meddling, look at how Poroshenko was ‘elected’ president of Ukraine. 	Also, how dare Kamala go against the word of the Great Obama. 	#WeThePeople voted for Trump &amp; did it on our own accord. We weren’t tricked by Russians; just thought Obama SUCKED!
@amjoyshow Now report on the influx of boarder jumpers. Most aren’t even from South America! If I had to guess I would say that Leftists and their Media lackeys are bringing these migrants in to try and ‘prove a point’ that POTUS is ‘evil’ #ThePeople see this and reject it. #Trump2020
@CJPatruno @joncoopertweets @BarackObama You say civility; you’re saying ‘politically correct’.	You say Justice; you’re saying ‘Governments rule over Gods’.	You say Equality; you’re saying ‘you cannot see physical differences between us’.	You say Democracy; you’re saying ‘Majority Rule’.		All of which are #AntiAmerican.
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey You suggest Moral Virtue governs. History shows it cannot. If it could, there’d be no need for government(as is for physical law), alas murder is prevalent. This begs for need of institutions which protect rights observed to be afforded to us at birth. Not created them on whim.
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey I agree that is true about the laws of Physics (which our animal body adheres to), laws of human action are different. These laws can be broken, sadly. It’s up to us as a species to recognize these laws, to prevent them from being broken, to become worthy servants of our Creator.
@NedLamont Spreading the property tax across more of the peoples personal property is not lowering property tax, it is only lowering the percentage to which tax on your property makes up the total amount of property tax we pay. #FakePlan #NoGoodForConnecticut #NewTaxNed
@k_rad @mnmpat @AnnieLowrey I agree, that is why law making is best left up to our creator, however no system is in place to make sure we follow that law. We all wish for Moral Virtue to govern; it can’t. Hence the need for gov’t that recognizes only Natural Laws. Gov’t promoting Positive Law is despotic.

@k_rad @AnnieLowrey What doesn’t? Whole tweet or individual word(s)?
@k_rad @AnnieLowrey No study, just an educated guess based on just how many of our Government institutions exist and function solely because there is a positive law demanding it. Truely governments only job is to protect and promote Natural Laws because Moral Virtue alone cannot. #IrrationalBeings
@k_rad @AnnieLowrey I would argue that 95% of the current federal employees are unnecessary; only there because positive law requires it.

@KamalaHarris And I don’t blame the teachers for this, for they were once those children being awarded the badge of “educated”. I blame the Political Elite abusing their powers to bolster Positive Law over protecting Natural Law. #Despotism
@KamalaHarris They aren’t teaching the most important thing a child needs; the ability to self teach &amp; forever learn. Instead they indoctrinate for political elite; deeming children ‘educated for life’, handing a document declaring this so. Most children now are dumber than 19th century kids.

Laura Ingraham’s monologue about demographic change in America is spot on; it has been through mass immigration &amp; a lack of assimilation to #Americanism that Despotic ideals of Europe &amp; the old world have seeped into #USA, degenerating our fight for Natural Laws &amp; Rights for all.

That being said, how can we let any foreign national task America(ns) as suffering from bigoted political chaos, when A.) America clearly is not intolerant and B.) most of those who are being bigoted intolerant political anarchists are EUROPEANS masquerading as Americans.
To all #Americans, I ask you, if while studying abroad you felt as though the country you were in was bigoted, could you desecrate their flag and be hailed for it? As most countries are ruled by despotic ideals, I would think not. #AmericaFirst USA is best https://t.co/odwlJoH41H

@SenJohnBarrasso Now lets stop being tasked by European despots and their loyalist and continue to expand this great nation! #NaturalLaw is for ALL and to stop short of bringing it to everyone is inhumane and UNAMERICAN. #BeAPatriot #ManifestDestinyIsNotRacist
@imagesbyluke @jaketapper Lose the war against #NaturalLaw and the movement started in 1776. European despotism is on it’s last legs along with the loyalists promoting it.
@imagesbyluke @jaketapper No, but continue to believe so and you are sure to lose.
@SenatorEnzi What happened? Why have we stopped expanding? Nothing about #ManifestDestiny is racist, #NaturalLaw is THE law of ALL. Not bringing it to the world is inhumane. Being complacent to the @UN human rights SOFT LAW is #UNAMERICAN. Are you a European loyalist or an #AmericanPatriot
@SuzanneKelleher @realHarryLetap @jaketapper @nytimes Yes, Europe and it’s loyalist love despotism; Americans ended it in 1776. That is why you constantly see European ideals, such as a cabal, being tasked as ‘American’; it’s their strategy to eliminating #NaturalLaw, but Americans are smarter and Europe will lose, again and again.
@jaketapper #POTUS is 100% right. History shows that since #WeThePeoples movement for #NaturalLaw in 1776, the powers of Europe and their loyalists have been trying to task America with their despotic bigotry. NO MORE! #AmericaFirst
@austintyowens @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump It’s the perfect list; listing all of the despotic ideals of Europe that it and its loyalists have been so eagerly tasking to America in an attempt to undo what #WeThePeople brought to light in 1776, #NaturalLaw.
RT @realDonaldTrump: NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!
@RobinLynneKelly @realDonaldTrump Can you imagine the anxiety those families will have when Europe completes its tasking of America with despotism and finally removes Natural Law as THE law; undoing what #WeThePeople started in 1776? I can and is why I stand with #POTUS in saying #AmericaFirst. #TradeWarWhen
@SoozUK There’s no stretch. Simply play it out long term. If what we’re striving for is true gender equality, eventually polygender society will become perceived as bigoted. A monogender world is a society thats erased lesbians or any other ‘gender’ for homogeny. This erases humans too.
Failure to recognize Natural Law as the pinnacle of rule only promotes the despotisms of Europe. On need not look further than the ‘Feminists Clash with Transgenders at London Pride Parade’ https://t.co/sYrNGdfIkW #Trending via @pjmedia_com 	Don’t let 1776 be tasked by such vice.
@TwitterMoments A European Loyalist on one of the most dangerous machines of all time; and yet he would have it and all its danger tasked onto America(ns).
@RudyHavenstein “Your privacy comes first, as always” yet it is literally last. #FreudianSlip 		Why LARP as a freedom fighter against European Despotism, yet task the very people trying to rid America of those European Despots with European Despotic Bigotry? Stop with your #AntiAmerican hate.
It is sad; tragedy after tragedy people flock to find a motive &amp; seek to create Positive Law as a means to prevent future tragedies, yet never stop to think that with each new Positive Law, tragedies occur more frequently &amp; that it’s the Laws which may be to blame, not guns.
@ShaunKing One race cannot oppress another. Only Governments oppress a people. At one point the US Government made up of whites oppressed blacks, yes. Today the US Government is diverse and as such oppresses all citizens. Positive Law (which you advocate for) is oppression like no other.

@SaintWandi @ambslynnn @DoctorDiva51 @Danaleeha @kanyewest Americans too faced enslavement by the British. A famous quote from that time still gets passed around today; “Give me Liberty or give me death.” 		If you are not willing to die for your Liberty why would you expect anyone else to? Being a slave is a choice.
@Alexbear111 @kanyewest There is but one choice; are you willing to be a Liberated Human willing to die for your liberties or not?		Choose the latter and the consequences fall only upon your shoulders.
@sanele_mkhonza Meanwhile in reality, it is displaying for all Liberated human, a show of ignorance that only those locked in a mental prison can create.

To everyone who believes that Slavery is not a choice I ask you, would you take Liberty or take Death? 		Free men would choose death over their liberty being dethroned.	 	Choosing to live without liberty is a choice made only by those willing to be slaves. #Slavery #Choice
It’s unfortunate the term ‘Slavery’ has been branded a race based class of people, when in reality, anyone living under a government of positive law is technically a slave; forever bound in servitude as the states property/responsibility.		We must embrace the #love of #NaturalLaw
Which rule of law do you support? #LawDay
Remember to take a moment today and give #love to our Almighty Creator (who/whatever he/she/it is) for giving us life, dreams, Liberty and Natural Laws to unify behind. #TheGreatGive

Through time, circumlocution and devisive rhetoric, those in power have reversed the roles of the US Constitution to be laws for the people, rather than government, to follow.
The United States of America, in all of history, is the nation which has come the closest to achieving this feat, creating a Constitution which established law for a heartless Government to follow, not the citizens, for the citizens can feel the law in their hearts.
To truely find #Liberty for all, we must break free from Civil Laws and embrace the #Love of Natural Law.
With this being said, a #freethinker realizes their thoughts are not governed by a government, but rather themselves alone. #NaturalLaw
Therefore, if ‘Civil’ is Law by Government, would not a ‘Civil Right’ be Rights by Government?
This leads us back to the first question still left unanswered; “Whose law?”		With this context in mind, it is clear that the answer is the Governments Law.
With this we are redirected back to the definition of ‘Civil,’ but also see ‘Private Rights’ appear again; leading one to assume it must be referring to our inalienable rights. 		When looking at the definition of ‘Private Rights,’ one can see they’re far from Inalienable Rights. https://t.co/5usDE9JpkK
The first red flag is the last definition in the section highlighted, ‘established by law.’ Whose law?		The second definition to look at here is Civil Law. https://t.co/2XbWjWDNhZ
First lets look at the definition of “Civil.” https://t.co/cKHCUDaAwe
Civil Rights are hate put out by government trying to manipulate.
@RepRobinKelly The only job of the Federal Government is to assure that our #UPoH are protected and promoted. Anything beyond that is #PositiveLaw and an exploitation of the rights of the constituents you serve.

Shangri-la is but a place where Government strives to promote and protect Moral Virtue.
Government is but a necessary evil when faced with the fact that Moral Virtue lacks an ability to govern.
Moral Virtue is but a fundamental ideal that all Human, infallibly, can be independently good and just.
#UPoH are not entitlements awarded to some by Government, but rather a mandate to all by Mother Nature.
