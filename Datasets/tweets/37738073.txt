12/Questions like these have been raised in North Carolina, and North Carolina both just invalidated a federal election and undid acts by a legislature due to electoral cheating.  These are powerful new developments to consider as we move forward w/greatest scandal in US history.
11/My point - central question of our nation's Russia probe isn't collusion, it is whether America picked our President in 2016, or whether Russia did. It is about our sovereignty, whether we exercised it in 2016 and how our system handles a matter like this in the future.
10/Also in NC last week - a judge invalidated actions by the GOP legislature because the court determined that their power was illegally acquired through cheating https://t.co/PFFw3KZHTv
9/And lookie here, just last week, North Carolina determined that due to one side engaging in a massive effort to cheat, a recent federal election was invalidated and a new one ordered.  https://t.co/5quhglf0Vl

7/In addition, there is a great deal of evidence already in the public domain that Trump broke many campaign laws in 2016, and cheated his way into the Presidency.  https://t.co/DsnQ4r7jQ5 Scale of the efforts to cheat jawdropping.
6/Ferocity of Trump's efforts to make Russia attack on US go away has been astonishing, and for good reason - it gave Trump the Presidency.  For the attack was MASSIVE, and changed the outcome of the election.  Something he clearly knows.  A thread: https://t.co/phgNePwD8W
5/We have to recall that Trump has not only blocked an investigation into the Russian attack on the US, but he has repeatedly denied it even happened.  https://t.co/ro1i17BI1C Would be like FDR questioning whether Pearl Harbor happened, or Bush 9/11.
4/Scale of effort to block legit natl security investigation into an historic attack on US is itself treasonous. No possible justification for it.  Need to understand what happened, prevent it from happening again.  That Barr may keep all this secret leaves US w/o an accounting.
3/Trump's gone to extraordinary lengths to hide his connections to Russia, impede what may be most important US investigation in our history. He still hasn't sat for an intv; prevented a bipartisan 9/11 commission; fired critical leaders of DOJ/FBI.  https://t.co/5j97diHV9Q
2/First, and most importantly, the US was attacked by perhaps our most consequential enemy in 2016, and through this attack helped ensure the narrow victory of their choice for US President.  https://t.co/C8Lx52mkxo That this happened is not open to debate.
1/A thread abt the investigation into Russia's attack on America in 2016, &amp; why the goal of finding collusion between Trump &amp; Russia while important isn't all that matters.  Let's focus on what we already know for a bit, as this AP piece does so well.  https://t.co/ASJQCwufNd

2/I've expanded on that call in recent weeks, fleshing out the idea a bit further.  We should all commit to not use the illicit tactics of Russians and others against one another in Democratic primaries, and to more aggressively call out those who do.  https://t.co/ZfUwobPjPj

@FaizaPatelBCJ @McAndrew Good questions.  I address the scale and impact issue here https://t.co/phgNePwD8W IMHO with 30 yrs in the business Russian campaign in US was massive, had huge impact, changed outcome of the election.  Key here is Trump owes Putin, acting that way since elected.
Trump talks Iran, Venezuela, the border...are these our greatest threats? Distractions I argue, distractions fr our greatest threats - weakening of the West, Russia, climate change, cyber exploitation of our openness.  A thread challenging Ds to step up:  https://t.co/F6mxxgcUTp
18/The Dem Presidential primary is off to a great start.  Inspiring candidates, a range of voices and approaches, big crowds.  But soon these candidates have to go bigger &amp; together craft a muscular foreign policy for a new age, and new and evolving threats.  Time now.  End//////
17/Let's commit together to stop taking the daily bait tossed out there by a venal, traitorous POTUS, and focus now on the greatest threats facing us - the weakening of the West, Russia's unchecked aggression, cybersecurity/our openness, climate change.
16/But time now to lift our heads up fr the day to day Mueller filings, the cowardice of Congressional Rs, the welcome hires by House Committees. Not abt investigations alone - we know what happened.  Russia attacked, Trump aided, it continues.  What are we going to about it?
15/There are now encouraging signs of bipartisan cooperation to challenge Trump's Russian influenced foreign policy, and his ongoing distractions from the real threats facing the nation.  https://t.co/lcVrt1piyP
14/But what makes it all worse is that we've been unable to extricate ourselves from Trump's never ending cover up of Russia's attack, and his support of it.  We haven't learned from what happened, and built a strategy to prevent, counter Russia's malign influence.
13/The President's clear and obvious cooperation with the Russians in 2016 to alter the outcome of our democratic election was the greatest crime in the history of the United States, and among the most significant events in our entire history. https://t.co/phgNePwD8W
12/That America still has no comprehensive strategy in place to counter Russia, to prevent their ongoing interference in our elections and in those of other nations, remains just jawdropping and hard to comprehend.  That we aren't even talking about is even worse of course.
11/Stephen Miller talk about sovereignty and physical barriers can no longer be had w/o talking about the greatest violation of America's sovereignty in our history - the Russian attack on our nation in 2016, and their success at manipulating our democracy to choose our POTUS.
10/My point is this - it is time for American policy makers and media to begin to far more seriously challenge the President's never ending distraction from the true threats facing America today.  Was interesting to see this recent poll: https://t.co/T0zFdU0DUw

Important to remember that Democrats wanted a 9/11 style commission to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election.  No investigations.  A commission.  Trump said no, fired Comey, and we got Mueller, separate Senate/House investigations.  All of this is Trump's fault.

6/Nostalgia may be attractive in movies and music but in politics it is dangerous, fool's gold.  America First still feels to be a Russian/European import, not suited to our story, our history, our circumstances.  Story Trump tells is disconnected from truth, today, our future.
5/At some point Dems must become more aggressive abt explaining how Trump has weakened the nation. State of the Union isn't good. Economy, health care, immigration all weaker. Not safer or stronger. Corruption/degradation of democracy dangerous. Opposite of greatness. Decline.
4/Repudiation of Trump's foreign policy by IC/Senate GOP/both chambers has become perhaps most important short term dynamic in Washington, and something not sure we've seen before.  Gap btn Trump and everyone else huge now, unsustainable.  https://t.co/lcVrt1piyP
3/And Trump's blowing the recovery he inherited is consistent with terrible performance of GOP Presidents since Berlin Wall fell.  In new age of globalization Dems have brought prosperity, Rs decline.  Contrast is stark. https://t.co/WzNN7cIk4K
2/At core of Trump's narrative remains a monstrous lie - things were bad before he arrived, &amp; he's made them better.  He inherited a strong economy, and despite massive spending it's weaker today: job growth slower, real wages lower, deficits much higher. https://t.co/qgKkkZq9od

"In this new age of globalization it isn't the nation which has failed, or our politics, it has been Republicans."  A new thread challenging Schultzian bothsiderism and Trumpian BS on the recent history of the US.  Two parties not the same.  https://t.co/WzNN7cIk4K
16/In this new age of globalization it isn't the nation which has failed, or our politics, it has been Republicans.  Democrats have repeatedly governed well, brought prosperity. Rs have repeatedly brought decline. That is the central story of our time. https://t.co/li0DRIkfD3
15/Going into 2020, it is essential that all Democrats learn this data, and make this argument.  Facile framing of D vs R, rather than prosperity vs decline, success vs failure, modern vs nostalgic, forward vs backward is just inaccurate and wrong.  We have to make this case.
14/The story of the American economy, and America itself, since the end of the Cold War has been one of prosperity and progress under Democrats, under-performance and decline under Republicans.  There isn't symmetry between the two parties - there is a dramatic, stark contrast.
13/What my colleague @ctaylor551 argues is on this fundamental issue, the performance of the economy, there is a vast difference between the two parties, an asymmetry, and that kinds of bothsiderism we've heard from Schultz and others is just ignorant, wrong, polemical.
12/The poverty rate fell by 0.4 percentage points per year under Clinton/Obama, and has risen by 0.2 per year under the Bushes/Trump. https://t.co/VmAsxrQuzo
11/The Bushes and Trump have all seen the uninsured rate climb during their Presidencies, Clinton and Obama saw declines.  Years of dramatic declines under Obama have given way to a rising uninsured rate under Trump, even during a time of growth. https://t.co/3pxbSgqXio
10/On managing the budget, Clinton/Obama reduced the annual deficit of the US govt by 0.4% of GDP per year, Bushes/Trump have increased it by 0.5% of GDP per year. Trump may in fact be most fiscally reckless POTUS in US history. https://t.co/5hzPOactbR
9/Democrats have outperformed Rs in the stock market by 6 fold over last 5 Presidencies. Clinton/Obama averaged 14.9% gain each year in the S&amp;P 500, Bushes/Trump 2.5%.  Trump far behind Clinton and Obama. https://t.co/PYK3Owcfm8
8/On average median income grew by 1.2% in each year of the Clinton and Obama Presidencies, and declined by -0.4 annually under Bushes/Trump.  Last 13 years of GOP Presidents have left Americans poorer.  Pretty amazing stat. https://t.co/7m196HcqFX
7/Median income saw significant increases under Clinton and Obama, declines under both Bushes, and modest growth so far under Trump.  Rs have not been able to match strong econ performance of Clinton, 2nd Obama term at any point since 1989. https://t.co/RjvVXwhyoe
6/Clinton and Obama also created jobs at annual rate of almost 4 times greater than Bushes/Trump, 2.1m per year to 0.6m per year. https://t.co/7MwLNiVs89
5/Lets drill down on the data since 1989, when America entered a new  post Cold War, global economic age and everything changed.  Let's start with jobs.  Clinton/Obama created almost 4 times as many jobs as Bushes/Trump, 34m to 8.8m. https://t.co/l43857HklH
4/In this new @bpolitics analysis, critical to note that Trump not only places behind Clinton and Obama but also Jimmy Carter, and only ahead of W Bush, whose economic performance was certainly among the worst in all of American history.
3/In a new analysis, NDN's @ctaylor551 shows that the difference in econ outcomes btn Ds and Rs has been particularly acute since the end of the Cold War, and a new global economic age began.  Since 1989 Ds have brought prosperity, Rs decline.  https://t.co/li0DRIkfD3
2/That Dems have been so much better at managing the economy over the past generation of US politics is simply absent from the public debate.  It's the fundamental asymmetry in our politics today, and is a reminder that the two parties are not mirror images of one another.

3/Next the 2020 campaigns should make their commitment to forgoing use of illicit tactics public and detailed.  It should be on their websites, and clear to all.  They should have staff monitoring this activity, and pledge to report illicit activity to sm media platforms, FBI.

16/I wrote abt all this for @usnews once.  In working w/Donna Brazile in 2016, we tried to get the RNC to stop spreading Russian disinfo.  Donna repeatedly asked Priebus to stop.  He repeatedly refused.  https://t.co/OSrkP5b5h0  Role of RNC in all this not adequately understood.
15/So please join me in correcting any effort to minimize what Russia did in 2016.  It was a massive, multi-pronged, sophisticated effort to throw the election to Trump.  And it worked.  Our nation was penetrated by a hostile adversary, who continues to exert influence today.
14/But coming to this conclusion requires an accurate understanding of the enormity of the Russian attack on Clinton/DNC in 2016.  There is no question, no question at all, that Russia gave Trump the Presidency.  Which is why he is so beholden to Putin to this day.  He owes him.
13/What Donald Trump and his family did in 2016, coupled with the extraordinary efforts to cover it up since, is the greatest crime ever committed in the history of the United States. There has been no betrayal of our nation to come anywhere close to this.
12/So Donald Trump knew in 2016 that a hostile foreign power was attacking the United States and what did he do? He encouraged it. He urged them to do more.  He directly amplified the attacks. And he failed to tell FBI/Intel Community at that time when asked, lied abt it since.
11/Looking back at news accounts fr 2016, news orgs reported abt suspicions Russia was behind Ukraine platform change, DNC attack. Was not a secret.  Everyone knew.  And we know now Trumpworld had been talking to Russia/Putin abt all sorts of stuff.  So they all knew.
10/And what we know now is that at every step of this massive Russian attack on the Ds, Trump/his campaign/RNC knew it was Russia.  They had met w/Russians in June who offered to go after Clinton. Family gave ascent in the mtg. Manafort changed Ukraine platform wording. Game on.
9/Russia also waged a MASSIVE social media campaign designed to further degrade Clinton with voters across the spectrum.  It reached hundreds of millions of people, reinforced core Trump campaign narratives, created permission structure for Americans to believe things not true.
8/By amplifying Russian attack on Clinton/DNC, Trump campaign was waging information warfare, denying the ability for Clinton to tell her story.  Russia/Trump blocked her fr reaching voters, dramatically disrupted operations of campaign and DNC.  But that is not all Russia did.
7/Every escalation by Russia was cheered on by entire GOP establishment.  Almost every Fox News hit I did during the general was about a Wikileaks related event.  Between Russia's attacks and focus on Clinton emails Clinton campaign had no news hole to fill w/positive stories.
6/But the Russian attack on the Ds didnt end there.  Encouraged by Trump, his campaign and RNC, Russia escalated.  Not content with taking out one DNC Chair they went after the interim Chair Brazile and Clinton Chair Podesta.  High value targets, further degradation of capacity.
5/So it is my belief that the Russian attack on the DNC at the Convention was among most significant events to take place in modern American history.  It alone threw the election to Trump, dramatically disrupted Dem campaign, costing 1-2-3-4 pts - the election.
4/But damage from direct Russian attack on an American political party and its leadership was much greater than a chaotic convention. Entire general election plan, operation wildly disrupted.  Huge amounts of time devoted to mitigating damage sucked capacity fr normal campaign.
3/Two days later DNC Chair and most DNC senior staff were gone. Old fissures resurfaced. Early days of convention dominated by negative messages, chaos, confusion, and clearly cost Ds 1-2-3 pts that week. Losing 1 pt alone through this one intervention gave Trump the White House.
2/On a Friday morning, hours after Trump became the nominee, delivering a speech which was wildly critical of America and its historic mission, Russia dropped a massive trove of emails designed to harm the Democratic Party and its Convention which was beginning in a few days.
1/Critical to making sense of today's Stone news is for all of us to get to a more accurate place about the impact Russia's intervention had on the 2016 election.  Many of the words used - hacking, meddled, interfere - are all far too benign to describe what happened.
And everyone knew it was coming from Russia.  Everyone.  No ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know‚Äù - everyone knew, campaign went ahead anyway and has lied for years.  Lying is critical here - if everything was cool why did everyone lie? https://t.co/Ej12LOfprk

6/So the reasonable scenario now is Trump‚Äôs bill fails in the Senate, Dems pass their own bill with no wall funding. Where are we then Mr President? Is this leadership and a path forward? It‚Äôs monumental incompetence and intolerable stupidity, holding us all hostage.
5/Folks need to keep asking - why can't the President just bring his immigration ideas to Congress as all other Presidents have for hundreds of years? Have the debate, go thru the process we set up in the 18th century.  Why does the govt need to be shutdown? This is the issue.
4/More on all this in a thread from earlier today: https://t.co/6WedrIbHfe.  Bottom line - Trump is asking for something no Speaker can ever give him - a structural weakening of the legislative branch.
3/Debate isn't really abt immigration/border it's abt Trump and McConnell conspiring to make Trump something more than a President, an authoritarian, a Mad King. Trump made no concession today.  He just changed the terms of his anti-democratic demands.  https://t.co/9gHtYrXJ4K
2/And to me this is the rub - the President is literally trying to change how our democracy has worked for hundreds of years.  He has to do this because his immigration plan can never pass as is, and he needs to break the system to get what he wants.
1/Key point: Trump is not going to reopen the government until he gets his immigration bill passed but offers 1) a plan which cannot pass Senate or House 2) path which would preclude regular order - no committees, hearings, studies, debate, votes.  Process normally takes months.
5/After all this time he has spent talking about the border he doesn't even know that San Antonio is hundreds of miles from the border and has no wall.  Jawdropping stupidity from the President.  https://t.co/PCvcAI7sGg

The imm reform bill which passed the Senate twice in past 13 years called for legalization/citizenship for all 11m undocumented immigrants.  That is the position of the Dem Party.

4/There is no border crisis; there is no plan for why more wall is needed; he promised we would pay for the wall; offering BRIDGE Act/TPS is a f-ing joke and like a middle finger to Dems not a real offer; Trump is still living in Foxlandia not Washington.  https://t.co/OJtnFQgrxS
3/In a thread I posted this am, reviewed how disconnected from reality the President's call for more wall is.  They have never supplied data or evidence for why more wall is needed.  Never.  https://t.co/eZ8Ay7MTa4
2/Every commentator today will need to get very granular about what the border package is the President is proposing, and whether it addresses any of the actual challenges we face at the border today.  Data, evidence, reality has to become part of this debate at some point.
If the President doesn't reopen the government first, and then enter into negotiations over immigration and the border, he hasn't actually made any concessions.  He will have just changed the details of his demands, again, for at least the third time in the last few weeks.
6/Great chart from the @TheEconomist on border flows, and why all the areas of the US which need to be walled have already been.  https://t.co/1X31JVR4PS
5/Hopefully the President will offer us a way out of the shutdown today. As a political matter he should - his standing w/the public has taken a HUGE hit, he has lost the big argument, and further escalation is likely to drive his numbers down even more.  https://t.co/8iB08acYTJ
4/Despite a year of outrageous demagoguery, natl guard/DOD mobilization, kids in changes, etc public rightly does not believe what is happening on border is a crisis.  Extraordinary failure of Presidential leadership, yet he keeps selling failed policies. https://t.co/9gHtYrXJ4K
3/So appears we are going to be talking "caravan" again.  Reminder that US apprehends 100-200 people/day on border on average; this caravan likely to be about 200-300 people, one days worth; and they all turn themselves in, not crashing the border. https://t.co/qlH6B8fv7u
2/As backdrop to his petulant demand of $5b for more wall w/o any justification, reminder the President cited the rising deficit his own policies have created as a crisis significant enough to prevent federal workers from getting a pay raise.  https://t.co/EuSMWSDGxG
1/Wait, is he saying we already have hundreds of miles of "Wall"? Oh, we do.  So why do you want more? Where do you want it to go?

The key to this thread is that after a year of wild demagoguery Trump hasn't convinced the country the border is a crisis.  Without a crisis no reason for a shutdown.  Which is why he is being blamed for the shutdown, and why his numbers are dropping.  He's lost the argument. https://t.co/SKXpTpqJK1
7/Adding a new @CNN poll which has slightly higher numbers on whether it's a crisis, but similar numbers on who's to blame &amp; very clear signs of Trump erosion - in past month he's gone from -13 (39/52) to -20 (37/57), now net negative w/non-college whites. https://t.co/Wy5d3CAY7K

5/All of this polling suggests Trump is a diminished figure, and is losing his argument about the shutdown and the border, badly.  The longer this goes on the more feckless he will appear, risking lasting damage to already battered brand.
4/In the ABC/Post poll only 49% of GOP voters say what's happening on the border is a crisis.  In the CBS poll it's 62%.  After a year of endless demagoguery, natl guard, huge military deployment &amp; shutdown, Trump is struggling to convince even his own voters it's a crisis.

2/If Rs want Dems to make huge concessions like dropping legalization/citizenship for 11m, what do we get in return? All the deals being discussed right now require MASSIVE CONCESSIONS by Ds, none by the Rs; with many of the Rs demands being unreasonable, with no data to support.
So, legit question abt future negotiations over the border and immigration - are Dems supposed to just drop their long held views on how to reform the system? Dem starting place is CIR - legalizing 11m, changing legal imm system, smart border/immigration enforcement. https://t.co/3X6arwrq3q

Anyone think it important that the Administration still hasn‚Äôt produced a document outlining where more wall will go and why? We have lots of wall.  Why is more needed, and where should it go? That we still don‚Äôt know shows what a farce this whole thing is.
8/Putin's insurgency vs the West is built upon exploiting xenophobia in Europe.  Trump's relentless embrace of it here, even when it no longer makes political sense for him or his party, may not just be a sign of his stubbornness but of Putin's ongoing influence over him.
7/Which is why I return to this piece I wrote prior to 2016 election which raised alarm bells then abt how much Trump sounded like Putin.  https://t.co/U0fI1gOGBm
6/But what if Trump's clinging to his outrageous racism/xenophobia is also abt his fealty to w/Putin, his need to keep his partner/ideological fellow traveler happy? Having US President embrace neo-fascist "Putinism" was always Putin's greatest achievement, win or lose in 2016.
5/As a political lifer I can tell you that what Trump is doing on the border and the shutdown never really did and certainly no longer makes political sense.  It feels like something else is driving this - fealty to his base perhaps, centrality of this issue to his brand.
4/So absent a crisis around "those people coming to get us" Trump has to invent/cause one.  üëáI explain how/why we got here, that he told us he would ruin the country to get his wall which is what he is doing now.  https://t.co/C8kZq9yEAc
3/Country was never there on "America First."  Domestic support for trade and immigration has risen since Trump came to office, was already very high.  What Trump always needed to make this work was a terror attack - just abject fear of "others" he could exploit.
2/"America First" and its bigotry and isolationism never felt like a good fit for the US, always felt like a European/Russian import.  It's tenets really didn't "exist in nature" as @maddow says, didn't arise fr a body of thought/thinkers here in the US.
1/A "war against cultural pollution" is the fuel driving the rise of neo-fascism here/around the world.  Was never really going to work here given our immigrant history, containment of terror threat, success of current wave of migrants. Trump leaned into it in 2018, got trounced. https://t.co/AjXLNTq6LN

The rancid lying about something as siginificant as terrorism is an unacceptable betrayal of their oath to serve.  		Current system has not allowed a single foreign fighter attack on US soil in 17 years.  What has changed which requires a change in policy? And why a wall? https://t.co/3gXKOy2oT9
A lot going on but WH just did a complete 180 on Syria, one of the most vexing foreign policy challenges the world faces.  In other words the PRESIDENT DID A RECKLESS AND CRAZY THING which would have harmed the US and caused tens of thousands of our allies to die. He has to go.
One of the wealthiest men to ever become President telling us that govt employees working without pay are happy to do so.  Sit with the morality here for a second, and imagine ever believing that asking someone to work without pay was okay.  Ever.  For any reason. https://t.co/O1qU8W0GSt

2/Mini-thread. Trump failed to get his imm plan thru GOP Congress and is now demanding wall &amp; big changes to imm law w/o hearings, studies, debate or even bill text. He lost the debate, now holding US hostage.  https://t.co/oJzLgLYyf9.  Ds must oppose - not how democracies work.
To be clear - the Administration has NEVER EXPLAINED why additional wall is needed.  Not in their new letter to Congress or presentation.  No data showing new flows into unwalled areas; no data showing border is being penetrated in new ways.  Is expensive, unnecessary, clickbait. https://t.co/S6SYFLIAvI

3/Trump has already declared fictional natl emergencies around the deficit, trade and the border, invoking emergency powers to go around Congress.  His rancid abuse of these powers is now going to have become a major issue for the House Dems.    https://t.co/h2PUkRgjcv
2/And why Dems can't give into this kind of petulant authoritarian behavior.  If they do so now incentivizes Trump to go around Congress again.  Critical now for Dems to reestablish regular order - hearings, bills, analysis, debate.  Democracy. How its worked for over 200 years.
Thanks Glenn.  Have learned much from you. Your big insight - that our system much punish candidates who cheat or it incentivizes even greater cheating in the future - has convinced me that the DOJ has no choice and must indict the President prior to his re-election. https://t.co/zVMn59VnR1
Reminder Trump's border plan was rejected by a GOP Senate; Dems offered him $25b for the wall which he turned down; and now he is rejecting Jan/Feb Senate/House debate. He has utterly failed to get his way thru democratic means so he is blowing up our govt instead.  It's insane.

7/So it appears the President broke all sorts of laws to win in 2016.  He cheated at a massive scale, and he is a crook.  As @glennkirschner2 has argued, given the weight of all this DOJ has to indict him.  Failure to do so encourages future cheating. https://t.co/xJqOGNLS3t

I can't believe how insane this argument is.  FY 2019 DHS budget is $74b of which 40% ($30b) goes directly to border and immigration enforcement.  Adding Coast Guard and other funds you are probably up to $35b or so.  No one is shorting the border! https://t.co/NxNnPCObFH

Deserves mentioning that law enforcement officials at DOJ and in NY, DC and MD have filed documents in open court which suggest Trump has committed a variety of crimes as candidate and President.  And they provide evidence.  He hasn't been charged but these docs not nothing.
2 years of most GOP control of Washington since the 1920s and Trump could not get his border wall.  And because of this he throws a tantrum and shuts down the government.  Think about what a precedent this is.  Every year POTUS doesn't get one thing and whole country goes dark?

Thread.  @Maddow's great work last night on Russia's ongoing influence over Trump is must watch TV.  But this influence is far greater than she was able to detail last night, and goes back to the origins of Trump's candidacy.  On many issues Trumpism=Putinism.  New thread üëá https://t.co/dNZuVQV1Y3
6/As I wrote in 2016, "America First" itself, to use @maddow's term, did not exist "in nature" here in US until Trump.  It did however exist in Europe, as a Russian export.  https://t.co/U0fI1gOGBm Trumpism's DNA comes from Moscow, and has since its beginning.  They are allied.
5/But this gets to bigger issue - where exactly is Trump acting in natl interest of the US? His econ/tariff plans doing harm to US economy/companies/deficit.  He's done damage to US health care system, weakened enviro protections, broken imm system, harmed US relations everywhere
4/So turns out oil producing countries don't like electric cars.  And data is now coming in that EV adoption rate far faster than anyone predicted, becoming real threat to OPEC/MBS/Putin üëáSo Trump starts attacking American made Chevy EVs? WTF? https://t.co/HPO2YKSOTe

4/Finally it always comes back to fossil fuels - Russia, Saudi (Mexico, Canada too).  Q climate science. Attack GM's electric cars. Reduce EV subsidies here. Trump has placed his bet w/politics of petro-dictators - vast dark wealth/plutocracy/corruption.  https://t.co/0Ik6qHwPtv
Democrats should be wait and see on the deal.  Let him come brief Members/Senators; pressure him to remove all tariffs; consider asking for something big - reversal of tax cuts, infrastructure, shoring up ACA, imm sanity - in return for Dem votes. https://t.co/RDHxZnyqgt
3/Kushner‚Äôs attempted Moscow back channel was there to help manage the monitization of Putin relationship.  And one wonders if that has been Kushner‚Äôs role - manage the monitization, post Presidency deals with Putin, MBS, Israel and perhaps now Mexico.  Keep biz partners happy.
2/General election was joint Putin Trump production. MASSIVE intervention by Russia - disrupt Dem Convention, knock out DNC chair/senior staff, daily harassment of Clinton/2nd DNC Chairs. huge integrated social media/public messaging campaign. Trump owes his Presidency to Putin.
1/One thing always wondered abt was how email to Don Jr resulted in such a quick June 9th mtg at Trump Tower. Now we now Trump Kremlin talks had already been going on for months.

This thread matters.  Huge numbers of people have voted against Trump twice now; and Dems had a lot of people vote for them - millions more than Rs - in each of the last two elections.  Dems have far more of a mandate than than Trump or GOP now. https://t.co/gVgsKiGHxm
@MarkFeierstein @nprscottsimon Vote share also equals power.  More seats, more chambers, more public support for agenda.  Agree w Mark here - margin matters a lot in politics not that much in baseball.  Whole lotta people have voted against Trump now, twice.  Opposite of mandate.

So I think @FiveThirtyEight had it close to 9 on the generic, -11 on Trump job approval and high 30s for Ds House pickup.  All 3 appear to have been right on the nose.
And note continued GOP erosion in the Southwest - Beto gets to 48, AZ Senate too close to call and Dems now lead House delegation 5/4, success in NV/NM/CO, and House p/ups in CA.  GOP lost ground in Midwest/Rustbelt, and SW.  Problematic for 2020. https://t.co/IL0rKVQFEH

I'm sorry my friends, but this is going to be a very bad night for Donald Trump and the GOP.  House will flip, significant GOP erosion in Midwest/Rustbelt and Southwest, and Trump remains extraordinarily unpopular. https://t.co/Y4lq5jRv7Y
3 notes: 1) Midwest/Rustbelt rough for GOP, critical for 2020, undermines Trump's core narrative 2) For all Trump's muscle in rural/red areas evidence now of caravan backlash in heavily Mexican-American areas of AZ, CA, CO, NM, NV and TX. 3) Trump can't win w/o Rustbelt AND SW.
Reminder @FiveThirtyEight had Trump approval -11, generic at almost 9 +D and Dems winning 39 seats in the House.  The exits have Trump approval at -11, and early House returns are promising.

2/Some questions abt 2018 am still thinking about.  Why did Trump close with the caravan and not the economy? Did he really ignore all of his advisors? If so, will his mismanagement of the close become a big issue this week? Or he is just a vile racist seeking violence, conflict?

5/Want to go on record saying that what worries me abt how the President closed is that it didn't seem designed to win the election, but more about summoning dark forces to protect him as his own personal reckoning nears.  Could signal very challenging days ahead for the nation.
4/The President's decision to close with caravan - after the spate of scary violence which broke out in America - deserves far greater scrutiny.  It made his party look menacing, dangerous and cut against other clearly articulated approaches by his own campaign.  Why?
3/Tension in "caravan vs economy" found in the Trump ad with suburban mom and violin playing daughter which got drown out by the President's own unhinged rants, mobilization at the border.
2/Want to repeat that I don't think Trump's decision to close with the caravan is easy to understand through a political lens, particularly after escalating right wing violence, by his own admission, was derailing his end game strategy.
1/I just saw the closing "caravan" ad from Trump on the teevee and I just want to say that it makes him and the Republicans look crazy.  Crazy.  Perhaps it is motivating a few folks but for many reasonable people the ad will raise fears about the President's fitness for office.
Using @FiveThirtyEight's "adjusted" tool Trump's approval in latest polls has been net negative 13, 12, 8, 9, 11, 10, 11, 8, 13, 11, 14, 16, 11, 20, 10, 15 and he ends only  at 42.

7/What worries me most is that it's not clear this dramatic escalation vs the enemies of the tribe is going to help Trump in this election.  So what is the goal? Trump's actions have confirmed that violence is now a legitimate response to the "threat" - where is this going?
6/Use of US military - 800 troops, now 5,200, maybe 14,000 - is a government sanctioning of martial means to combat the enemies of the white nationalist tribe. Almost nothing Trump could have done after Pittsburgh to have shown greater support for movement which killed those 11.

7/What disturbs me more than anything else is that this the 4th time this year Trump has invented a fictional national emergency.  The other 3 were 1) original flow of kids, moms to border 2) deficit to cut federal worker pay 3) tariffs, repeatedly.  This is authoritarianism.
6/And so the President has now finally had to make up a fictional migrant threat, complete w/Middle Easterners, MS-13, using terms like invasion. He has even mobilized the American miltary - not just Natl Guard - to fight this fictional assault on the US.  https://t.co/fCb5SEe6f2
5/The European right wing model was never going to work here for we have had a different experience both with terrorism and immigration.  Was always a huge flaw in the Trumpian strategy, and why his extremist immigration strategy was never going to work. And it hasn't.
4/Despite more than a billion tourists entering US since 9/11 we haven't had a single foreign fighter attack.  Our immigrants are assimilating,  productive.  Crime rate is down, economy is booming, migrants commit  crimes at rates lower than native born.  Where's the threat/harm?
3/As Trumpism was derived/informed by right wing European parties and Putinism, Trump has been desperately searching for his enemy - dangerous migrants, terrorists - from day 1. Problem is we don't really have that here in US.  So his political project hasn't ever really worked.
2/Trump is now full on wag-a-dogging a fictional national security crisis right before our election.  He/his Admin are ignoring a massive domestic terror incident to focus on a ragged group of migrants 40-50 days away fr our border.  Whole thing is absurd. https://t.co/GLO6BhSRw2

3/Today is 4th time this yr Trump has declared a natl emergency: 1) border earlier this yr 2) deficit to stop pay increases for federal workers 3) tariffs.  This dangerous man is doing things we know from history can end democracies - there is more at stake here than it appears.
Do not share the President's new tweet re the caravan. It has uncorroborated assertions in it that are far more likely to be lies and disinformation than truths.  Do not share this tweet.

9/And have also now laid the groundwork to challenge legitimacy of a Democratic victory this fall.  https://t.co/v7bLCFVDkJ Timing and substance of Pence speech should be clear warning shot at what may come now.  No one should be surprised.
8/Trump and the GOP need the 2016 Trump Putin collaboration which undermined our democracy to be thrown into the memory hole and disappear.  Pence's speech made it clear where they going.  If successful w/Kavanaugh they now have fresh playbook to use against Mueller probe.
7/Trump's acceptance of illicit Russian help has aligned American with Russia and against Europe on these fundamental matters.  Imagine that on the day Europe took these steps we not only did not stand by them but actively worked to undermine them?
6/And on this day when our govt is saying "its China not Russia" Europe/UK took some of its strongest steps to call out and condemn relentless Russian interference in other countries.  https://t.co/EN44LoKQ4k So by not pulling the speech Pence undermined these efforts.
5/But dangerously, today the Trump Administration escalated its charge these retaliatory tariffs are a form of "election meddling," and that China is in fact now working to throw the election to the Democrats this fall. https://t.co/ycKI4k9DJ9
4/Which is why it is fair to read NAFTA 2.0 as Trump caving on his trade agenda to help reduce the damage these policies are having in the fall  election.  He got very little in the deal and in exchange embraced both NAFTA and the TPP.  https://t.co/aaBxjIP0uf

3/For me it is how our "Judge" has handled last few months which should be grounds enough for voting him down.  He exposed himself as troubled, intemperate, partisan hack willing to run roughshod over democratic norms for his own advancement. Is opposite of judicial temperament.

Through our three teenagers my wife @cdurkovich and I have met many young women who have attended the @HoltonArms school over the years.  Some are in our current soccer carpool.  All of them have been strong, independent and thoughtful young women.  We are thinking of them today.
9/Correction. Using @CookPolitical ratings, Ds are on track to clearly win 205 seats, and need to win 13 of remaining 57 Toss Up/Lean Rs seats to flip the House.  Right now Dems are on track, based on the analysis above, to get that done.
Friends, enough people just tweeted at me that a tweet I had just posted was not verified that I took it down.  My mistake.  If indeed it is substantiated, I will put it back.  Doesn't happen that often - I apologize.
8) But to be very clear - Democrats do not have this thing in the bag.  It is leaning their way.  But most competitive races for Gov/Sen/House are too close to call, so any late swing either way could be very meaningful.  Why shakeout on this #Kavanaugh fiasco matters so much.
7/In addition, Rs are at 45% or below in 9 additional races.  So 9 clear leads, 9 other races Rs underperforming late in lean D year, only 5 clear leads.  So let's be generous and say parties split those 57 districts.  Dems end up w/about 230 seats.
6/House.  Using @CookPolitical ratings, Ds are on track to clearly win 203 seats, and need to win 15 of remaining 57 Toss Up/Lean Rs seats to flip the House.  In @Nate_Cohn's latest polling of 30 of these districts, Ds have leads outside margin of error in 9 races, Rs in only 5.
5/Very strong showing of Dems in AZ, CA and TX continues a trend we first saw in 2016 - Trumpism is not playing well in this region of the country.  Very good #s too for Ds in CO, NM, NV.  Keep an eye on this. https://t.co/x5npCuRY8k
4/GOP wipeout in MI and PA deserves far more attention.  4 GOP candidates for MI and PA Gov and Senate in the 30s.  The 30s.  Dems likely to win these races by 15-25 points in two of Trump's most important states.
3/Rs not leading in governor's races in FL, GA, OH, PA, MI, WI, IA and NV - all critical 2020 battlegrounds.  Could end up winning some but GOP can't be happy here.
2/My take is Rs now have a very low ceiling across the country.  Of 45 top Gov/Senate/House battlegrounds w/recent polls Rs over 50% in only 4 or 5 (not incl TX Sen or AZ Gov); and have no lead outside margin of error in any Gov or Sen battleground.  https://t.co/4G7bwzYpJQ
1/Thread - a snapshot of current polling in midst of #Kavanaugh fight.  Using @FiveThirtyEight over last few weeks Trump's favs improved a bit, now 41.5/52.8 but the generic has worsened for the Rs, now stands at 49.6/40.9.  Both these results suggest a very good year for the Ds.
Look the bottom line is that the GOP argument about process is just ridiculous and should be dismissed out of hand.

Reminder, Kavanaugh 1) lied repeatedly under oath 2) helped lead effort which hacked into accounts of 6 US Senators  3) helped suppress 100,000s of his documents.  Any one of these things should have disqualified him fr the Court.  This is abt a terrible nominee not the process.
What just blows my mind is the incessant lying, and the implicit contempt it shows for our democracy and the American people.

6/Conclusion? Dogfight. Rs ceiling appears to have come down in last few weeks, Dems have clear shot at flipping both chambers (Senate a bit tougher) and winning Govs races in critical 2020 states.  But this thing isn't cooked, and unlike 2016 Dems will have to close strong.

3/Looking at Senate since mid August, Rs do not definitely lead in any of the major battlegrounds (AZ, FL, IN, MO, MS2, MT, ND, TN) w/possible exception of North Dakota.  In Texas Cruz has been up by 4 pts or less in last 4 polls.  And folks need to start paying attention to MS2.
2/National landscape appears to have shifted 2-4 points towards Dems since mid-August.  @FiveThirtyEight has Trump's approval going fr -10 in mid August to -13/14 now.  Looking across many polls feels like there was a structural shift, making pre late August polls unhelpful now.
1/Spent some time look at post Labor Day polling and have some thoughts, observations.  A short thread.
I know there is a whole lotta crazy coming fr the WH these last two years but media hasn't really grokked iepic level of crazy Trump's trade policy represents.  He has no authority to be doing what he's doing, doesn't understand how this all works and is doing direct harm to US. https://t.co/Oz6lsHS3w3
Our out of control erratic and ill informed President has launched a reckless trade war which is hurting our economy, our citizens and our nation.  Congress must challenge what he is doing more directly.  A new series from @NDN_NPI: https://t.co/mTUYDnRCta
In light of morning, clear now Trump has launched a very direct assault on the investigation into Russia's historic attack on the United States.  Further confirms our fears about his obeyance and fealty to Putin, for he perhaps more than anyone else is most direct beneficiary. https://t.co/keNzTJv1bX

History of Rs using illgotten materials from Dems to advance their agenda not pretty - Watergate, Kavanaugh 2001-2003, 2016 (Clinton, DNC, DCCC) and Spanberger 2018.

4/Trumpism's comfort with inequality, racism, plutocracy - of reestablishment of dominion - makes it not just wildly reactionary but also deeply at odds with the American creed and what has made us an inspiration to the world.  It is un-American at its core.

2/Big American idea was to begin process of ending one man's, one tribe's dominion over another.  At its core vision of Founding Fathers was truly radical, imperfect, but historically among most important ideas ever advanced.
1/American creed has always imagined "pursuit of happiness" to be universal aspiration, not exclusive to tribe/nation.  While imperfect in its application in our history, advancing these views today dishonors central source of American greatness: idea that we are all equal. https://t.co/zeIabQheTU

8/So where sit now is GOP has become invested in normalization of these illicit tactics party-wide.  And in age of foreign hacking, it is not just illegal, wrong but is invitation for hostile foreign powers to hack and launder their propo thru willing R partners.  Batshit crazy.
7/Why does this matter? Because GOP's use of hacked/illgotten Dem materials for their own political gain at very center of two biggest scandals of modern era - Watergate and TrumpRussia. GOP cannot renounce these tactics now because would be admission of their crimes in 2016.
6/And last night, a GOP party committee, the NRCC, made clear they could not sign on to a pledge that would put them on record against use of illgotten materials.  https://t.co/7v0LEmCoSz
5/Bigger point - GOP has not only never renounced illegal, illicit use of illgotten Dem materials for their own gain, but are now trying to put a man on Supreme Court who himself participated in such a conspiracy 15 years ago from the White House.
4/Stepping back, Watergate was GOP using illgotten materials fr Democrats for GOP political gain. Kavanaugh did it for Bush.  We know Trump/GOP did it in 2016 - Clinton, DNC, DCCC.  Was done to Abigail Spanberger few wks ago.  Why can't GOP renounce this tactic once and for all?
3/Sure appears Trump, who is under investigation for illicit conspiracy to use stolen Dem materials for GOP political gain, has chosen man to be swing judge on his case who himself participated in previous conspiracy to use stolen Dem materials for GOP political gain.
2/An illicit conspiracy to use materials stolen fr Democrats for GOP political gain is at the very core of the Mueller investigation.  Given that it sure appears Kavanaugh was involved in a previous effort to do just that - and cover it up too - makes his nomination mindboggling.
