@drbarnard Agreed. But surely they could improve if they tried a little

@sarahlane Yes! Even a chatbot haha
This also accomplishes what personal styling is supposed to do: push people out of comfort zones to try new things.
Even better, they could upsell by pairing a no item with a fix. (Customer hates sleeveless, so they add a shrug. Customer hates minis, so they add tights. Whatever.
That said, all is not lost. A bit of personalization at StitchFix could go a long way. If company needs to dump excess sleeveless shirts due to seasonality (even to ‚Äúno‚Äù customers, a simple note like ‚ÄúI know you said no X, but I love this piece!‚Äù
Amazon could def compete with Prime Wardrobe and better rec algos (not to mention Echo Look data &amp; the in-house stylists it brought on) just so long as amazon recs didn‚Äôt favor own brand items, bc yuck!
The best thing about StitchFix is not the clothes or styling. It‚Äôs the convenience. Not only in getting a box shipped, but using USPS for returns.
Age of shopper doesn‚Äôt seem to be considered. Despite asking for age, the lineup tends to feel more ‚Äújunior‚Äù /millennial/trendy.  (Crop tops aren‚Äôt for everyone!)
The lineup, which increasingly includes own brand items, lacks natural fibers, like cotton. There‚Äôs a lot of cheap fabric, like polyester (a choice Amazon also uses for its fashion brands, for similar cost savings)
You start to get the feeling that maybe you aren‚Äôt interacting with an individual stylist, but a system. An algorithm.
The stylist never seems to really get to know you. Picks are hit or miss. If you always return pants, e.g., they don‚Äôt have a way to directly interact to ask why. They often blatantly ignore instructions, like ‚Äòno sleeveless.‚Äô There‚Äôs no chat feature, just feedback forms.
As an on-again/off-again user, I feel like StitchFix lives or dies based on the stylist‚Äôs picks, which vary between sessions. https://t.co/qs1fgnoVGA

Even if some of these kids seem to be (or say) they're willing participants, can they really be? How will they feel when they're old enough to get that mom/dad used them for money or free stuff? Or when they read the comments written by the pedos these videos tend to attract?
In addition, it encourages other children to put themselves on YouTube, too. And not all parents are watching what kids are posting.
A preschooler, young school-ager does not understand what YouTube is or what they're consenting to. It's not just posting a baby pic on Facebook. It's actively monetizing your own children by displaying them in front of a broad audience.
fwiw, I also cast a side-eye at the mommy vloggers who spend all day making kids film skits for YouTube where they act out things or play with toys. Just let your kids play like normal children and stop milking them for money.

Instead of fighting, let‚Äôs just fix both problems. https://t.co/dWffm3g7c6
@CindyApontePR Def an ongoing challenge!
Yep https://t.co/H0F0yQBaYy
@BKramer Yep! As with most 'kid problems,' solution is actual parenting
@BKramer If that means she sometimes watches toy unboxings, fine. I watch those for iphone, so what can I say? :D
@BKramer And in many cases, better - she loves craft vids, and science experiments, e.g.
@BKramer I watched plenty of dumb stuff on TV as a kid. A lot of what my kid watches on YT is stupid, but harmless.
@CindyApontePR If the headphones go on, I check in. (she's only ~8 so doesn't use them as much as tweens/teens though)
@CindyApontePR Yep. I wasn't allowed to watch HBO on our cable box when I was a kid, but parenting YT is harder bc it can be private.
@BKramer but this is not as easy when they're older. most of their friends watch YT &amp; it's a part of their culture, as big as TV was for us as kids.
@BKramer this is much easier when kids are little. I def had no YT when she was preschooler, like yours (i'm guessing based on programming)
@ScottPorch but w/YT subs, I find she's more likely to tune into the subs I've pre-approved than go seeking new content. &amp; i have watch history access
@ScottPorch it's ok, but not perfect. good to have if u want to turn search off, e.g. and child less likely to fall into 'dark yt'
@JohnWilson only when it comes to untrustworthy platforms like YouTube.
but tbh, the most imp thing I do is allow her to play outside often. given the freedom to be outdoors w/friends limits the appeal of devices
I'm sure she's been a victim of the algorithm at times, but as a schoolager, I can't just let her watch for hours without some checking in
1) She has an account so I can track viewing history 2) all subs are previewed first before adding 3) I regularly ask she's watching
the only solution I‚Äôve found is to be pretty on top of my child‚Äôs YouTube viewing. I have a few rules: https://t.co/LS1Zsj3ybg
