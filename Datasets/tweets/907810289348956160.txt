The left keeps reiterating the point that the NRA and its millions of members are a terror organization, as it advocates for responsible gun ownership and gun safety, along with the preservation of the 2A. This goes against their debunked gun control agenda pushed for decades.
The left vocally supports against a border wall, against CBP and ICE whose job it is to detain illegals and secure the border, against the abolition of sanctuary cites that endanger Americans, and are pro mass migration. Don’t tell me they don’t support open borders. That’s a lie
The Dems midterm platform is not only continuous obstruction and incompetence, but to endanger the public by advocating for open borders and the abolition of ICE, whose job it is to detain and deport criminal aliens while securing the border along with CBP. Vote R! #MAGA

Allowing mass migration from the Middle East endangers American citizens, as many individuals affialted w/terror organizations pose as refugees to enter the country. They then commit acts of terrorism killing Innocent people. If 1 American is at risk,the risk is not worth taking
The executive branch has the authority to determine who enters the country regardless of where they come from in matters of ntl. security, because the U.S. is a sovereign nation. The Supreme Court’s verdict was indisputably correct
The Democratic Party continues to prove that they believe anyone who disagrees with their statements or views is a Nazi or not human. Their tactic of viciousy attacking people who disagree with them is beyond dispicable.
Over 63 million Americans voted to elect Donald Trump because they felt that the ruling class didn’t put their interests first and wanted someone to change that, To preserve the country we all love, and to serve the will of the people. The left will never legitimize this, ever
Instead of engaging in civil discussion, the left resorts to comparing opposing views to those of the “Nazis” and evil. This is something never before seen in American politics where one side doesn’t treat the other as human. The left is sincere, and won’t ever back down
The democrats &amp; their media allies know that the agenda they’re pushing doesn’t connect or relate to the everyday struggles of Americans, &amp; their policies are both disastrous &amp; ineffective, so defending illegals is their strategy, plus amnesty, to bypass Americans in elections
Don’t tell me that the left cares about American kids suffering in the liberal run inner cities without safety, an education, and a functioning family, because they don’t. The separation issue is only a political tool ahead of the midterms because they have nothing else to offer
President Trump, VETO any bill passed by Congress granting amnesty to illegals! It’s not what the American people voted for, it doesn’t put their interests first. Trust your instincts and keep your promises. It will help you, not hurt you. Please the people, not the bureaucrats!
If you don’t want to be separated from your children, DO NOT cross the border illegally!
Comey, Strzok, page, and others should be behind bars tonight. This kind of corruption and bias shown in federal law enforcement should not stand. Period. The deep state, exposed once again, needs to be locked up! Protect and preserve the constitution!
Happy birthday, President Trump! Thank you for all you do to fulfill your promises and make America great again! Let’s keep it going all the way to November and beyond!
As the RINOs in Congress are pushing for an immigration “compromise”, Trump needs to trust his instincts and just say “No” to any bill that includes amnesty and excludes his populist priorities. He signed the omnibus under pressure, he better not screw up. Fire Marc short too!
As crime continues to surge in  Britain, police are convincing the public that “hate speech” is the real threat instead of radical Islamic terror and stabbings. Political correctness isn’t only destroying the U.K, it’s destroying Europe. Populism can cease this
The Trump-Kim summit, something of extreme historical significance, not be only shows that Trump is a master negotiator and determined leader, but also proves that America is more respected on the world stage, that America is taken seriously. #MAGA #Americafirst
Why doesn’t the left want a president that stands up for American interests and values abroad without folding under pressure? A president that says the same thing behind closed doors and in public? A president that upsets the elite and pleases the American people?
The left feels “so embarrassed” that their president is very firm about the interests of the country. America believes in nationalism not globalism, that America’s interests will be ahead of the rest of the world in the viewpoint of the president, the way it should be.
@Jansinclair9 The liberal MSM can’t stand a president that not only stands up for America and it’s interests, but is also respected for doing so. Totally different with Obama where he didn’t recive a red carpet in China unlike the other world leaders as an example of many
At the G7 globalist summit, Trump puts the interests of Americans first by committing to fair trade practices that don’t harm American workers/companies. He made it clear that The U.S will no longer sit back and let other countries take advantage of us
If you are a republican and vote for lame duck Ryan’s amnesty bill, you aren’t a republican, you aren’t a democrat, you aren’t a public servant; you are a liar and a traitor to the American voters who trusted leadership to put forth their interests. This doesn’t. #RemoveRyan
On Twitter Liberals high five each other disrespecting the flag in a way beyond disbelief. These people aren’t proud Americans nor do they take pride in its traditional values, and that should concern those who are patriotic, who want to preserve values we hold dear
While the left continues disrespecting the flag and those who fought and died for it, Trump held a ceremony today celebrating the National Anthem that sets us apart from the world. Liberals take pride in unpatriotic actions, while the rest of the country proudly STAND! #MAGA
Sadly, the political division in America has evolved into proud Americans vs spoiled Americans. Many of those who align with leftist values have dissatisfaction for the US, &amp; those with conservative values have more pride in their country. The dem party is unrecognizable in 2018
AMERICA, love it or leave it.
The Ntl Anthem kneeling issue is a legitimate reason why the left aren’t proud of their country and take every opportunity to tread on the flag. They use the constitution to their defense, but forget this is the only country that would allow that type of disrespect

@NazarethII My thoughts exactly. Spot on!
The left is the first to call out racism, but when the left participates or engages in racism, there is suddenly a double standard. It’s ok for them because they’re “fighting facism!” This is what the American left has evolved to
By dividing the country in methods such as race baiting &amp; race blame, the democrats use these strategies to keep themselves in power through the votes of minorities, another way to stay in power for generations. Turning the country against one another will have consequences
Af. Am. have just as much of a chance to become whatever they want in life as long as they work for it, just like anyone else. Liberals believe that without government subsidies and benefits, they can’t succeed, which isn’t true. Race doesn’t define a person, the left disagrees
If one American life is at risk, that risk is not worth taking. After the attack in Toronto, these “refugees” shall be barred from entry to the U.S. Trump appears to be only world leader along with the Hungarian PM to enforce its borders and stop mass migration
The U.S. and all nations should permanently restrict immigration/migration from the Middle East where there is a known Terror threat, as individuals with links to terrorism can infiltrate refugee flows and commit mass murders once they reach their final destination
Any sovereign nation should not only secure its border, but put limits and restrictions to its immigration policy. When euro nations take in MASSIVE amounts of migrants, increases in crime, murders, and terrorism occur. Political correctness won’t solve the issue, toughness will
Schools are not the place for political protest, they are a place for learning. It is a place for students to gain their education. Keep in mind, with these protests, where a police presence is needed, is at the expense of the American taxpayers.
Schools allowing walkouts are headed down a slippery slope. If you’re going to allow protests for a liberal, progressive cause, allow one for a conservative cause. Hell, If they wanted to protest against what’s being served for lunch they can. If it’s all about “free speech”
The media has their own political agenda, to completely shred Trump’s presidency to bits in coalition with their allies in the Democratic Party. The focus isn’t on the issues that really matter, only the ones they see fit to damage the credibility or image of President Trump
The liberal MSM, still throbbing from Trump’s victory, still can’t come to reality with the fact that he’s the president. They can’t accept that his populist agenda connected with Americans, &amp; their fake, heavily biased reporting didn’t. For them, it’s all about ratings
The radical left wing Democrat agenda favors more criminals roaming the streets, a border wide open, regime change in the Mideast, higher taxes, more regulations, globalism not nationalism, and men in the women’s room. Don’t elect this in Nov. #MAGA #RedWaveRising2018
Am I disappointed with the Syrian airstrikes? Yes. Is the #MAGA movement dead? Absolutely not. This should not be a defining moment of Trump’s presidency after all the promises delivered and kept. Let’s worry about what lies ahead, not in the past.
Where did regime change and pointless wars get us in the Mideast? Let’s see: Thousands of civilian casualties, countless fallen US troops, an international migrant crisis, 7 trillion wasted dollars, and the rise of ISIS.
@realDonaldTrump should focus more on the border, rather than a hellhole that the US has no business hanging around in. Securing the border would be the last step in perfecting the presidency. Build the wall, not an unstable “democracy” in Syria #Americafirst
The Syria “chemical attack” doesn’t add up. Why would someone winning a war sabotage themselves? Why would the world consider striking Syria when they were wrong last time? @realDonaldTrump remember what you said about Syria. NO MORE POINTLESS WARS #Americafirst

It’s simple why the Dems don’t want a secure border with a wall; the more illegals flow across the border, the more votes they receive. It’s a way to stay in power for generations. We the people have the power to deny that, which is why we need to vote GOP in Nov. #MAGA
Trump has kept so many of his promises made to the American people in almost a year and a half. Building the wall should now be his top priority regardless of what the neocon globalists advise him to do. He’s the president, they’re not. #buildthewall #promisesmadepromiseskept
When asked for a definition of an “assault weapon,” liberal protesters could not define it. Why should they be given the authority to make policy they lack the knowledge to comprehensively understand?
If I am correct, the 1994 assault weapons ban statistically did not reduce gun violence nor did it prevent the unfortunate occurrence of mass shootings. Why would it work in 2018?
Washington swamp isn’t shivering in fear in the aftermath of the “March for our Lives” protest, in fact, they are gleeful that these kids are endorsing their agenda that they’ve been trying to implement for decades. No Mr. Hogg, they aren’t fearful, they are grinning in delight

I wonder if Trump is considering signing the crappy omnibus because it provides at least some money for the wall. By November 2020, if the wall is not built, or even started, why should his voters show up? He is taking every chance he can get to build the wall no matter what

POTUS delivered his unfiltered message straight to the American people at his Pennsylvania rally. Huge crowd with lots of enthusiasm! Trump at his best (aside from making America great again) 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Even if Tiger doesn’t win at the Valspar tomorrow, I’d consider him to be back. Short game spectacular, long game drastically improved from previous weeks

The MSM is an ally of the progressive agenda and the Democratic Party. Their main goal is to destroy the Trump presidency. They could hardy care about what Americans think, they only care about enacting their own agenda. 91% of Trump coverage negative!
The media, the same so called experts that so carelessly claimed that HRC would win the presidency, now claim that Dems will experience a “blue wave” that will carry them to overwhelming majorities in Congress. Another attempt to discourage Republican voters and energize the left
President Trump’s tough talk on NK got the regime to come to the negotiating table and finally respect America and its allies. I thought the MSM said that Trump’s rhetoric was so “dangerous.” Wrong again! Another example of USA being respected on the world stage #MAGA

After a year of breathless investigations (taxpayer funded) to find “collusion” btwn POTUS and the Russian Federation, NO evidence has been found! Trump didn’t collude with Russia, he colluded with the silent majority #MAGA🇺🇸
The whole gun control ideology spouted by the left relates back to the unfortunate events of terrorism in Europe; instead of going after the terrorists/ radicalized people, they went after everything but that. Here in USA, they go after guns, not the person behind the trigger
A new CNN poll, disproportionately surveying Dem voters and Dem leaning independents, shows POTUS approval at 35%. BS. Rasmussen shows 50% and he’s above that by polls w/out bias. Just Another tactic by the MSM to discourage Trump supporters which won’t ever happen!

If a mentally unstable person or terrorist cannot acquire an AR15, then they’ll use a shotgun, then a pistol, then a knife, then an explosive, even a vehicle. Blaming guns and not the individual responsible is the reason that inncocent people’s lives are taken too soon
Restricting guns from law-abiding citizens is not the answer to preventing the next mass shooting. “Comprehensive” gun reform isn’t the answer either. Cities in US with “comprehensive” and “strict” gun laws have crime rates soaring... EX: Chicago, Baltimore, etc
Why was it so hard for Democrats to stand or clap for non partisan statements by the president? Oh wait, that doesn’t follow their motto of “resist” and obstruct
As Trump paid tribute to honorable Americans such as veterans, grieving parents, and local heroes, Dems were too busy playing candy crush, sitting on their hands, and playing with their dentures
Great speech given by President Trump! The agenda outlined for the new year is ambitious, and pro-American. Dems against jobs, record low unemployment, strong military, secure borders, pro illegal immigration (plus MS13)
House intel committee voted earlier to #ReleaseTheMemo! About time! This is only the beginning in terms of exposing the corruption and bias in federal law enforcement! Dems don’t want people to know that probes were tainted in their favor! Total left wing bias!

I trust that Trump will do the right thing and stick to his promises as he always has, but this was a huge mistake to offer amnesty to 1.8 million illegals! Please do the right thing Mr President, we are counting on you

Btw liberals, 60 votes are needed in the senate. Republicans only have 51. That means democratic votes are needed to keep the government open. Senate dems obstructed. It’s what they do. #SchumerShutdown
The #SchumerShutdown will only hurt the democrats in 2018. Holding the military and their families as well as thousands of people dependent on their paychecks hostage is not a strategy. This is what they have to offer to America. Disgraceful!
We now know what Democrats really stand for; putting the interests of illegal aliens ahead of American citizens, including veterans and hardworking government employees, and even Firemen fighting fires in California. This was a partisan attack on the American people
Sen Dick Durbin who very poorly represents my home state and has been known to be a corrupt and dishonest politician, keeps reiterating the failed Dem talking point that Trump is a “racist.” This is why Trump and the GOP are winning big! Keep it up, Nov. 2018 is fast approaching!
What Democratic candidate in 2020 will have a meaningful message to the American people? Economy soaring, ISIS swept away, military strong, border secure (wall coming), strong foreign policy, US more respected, etc. Dems have no strategy. They have nothing to run against! #MAGA
RT @realDonaldTrump: AMERICA FIRST!
The discredited WAPO, citing anonymous sources, states that Trump referenced Haiti and western African countries as “s***holes.” Trump is right. America should review how importing people from unstable countries doesn’t benefit citizens already living here
Many conservatives are worried about whether or not Trump will fold on immigration. It won’t happen. Period. That meeting on the 9th was to prove to the MSM that he is mentally stable and in control. I am confident  that Trump will keep his promises on immigration
The WALL absolutely MUST be in any immigration bill that Congress is negotiating plus ends to chain migration and the visa lottery. Dems just want to import voters, ultimately changing the electorate
“Journalism in America is dead.” -Sean Hannity
Very much enjoyed watching White House policy advisor Stephen Miller mop the floor with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Another example shown that CNN doesn’t like the truth to be exposed on air
If Trump is so “mentally unstable” and “idiotic” as the Dems and their MSM allies claim, why is our country witnessing so much success over the past year? Economy is soaring, America respected again, etc. I’d consider the POTUS a smart man
The Trump/Russia “collusion” narrative is completely falling apart, so much that dems and liberal MSM don’t want to admit it. Time to move on to get important things done in DC, such as building the wall and fulfilling other key promises to #MAGA!
A deep cleansing needs to occur in the Justice Department and FBI. From anti-Trump investigators to partisan attack teams, and using that partisanship for Justice to not be delivered to those who are guilty of crimes can not be tolerated. We the people deserve an independent DOJ!
@Trumpisforyou Make sure you unfollow Democratic senators that you currently follow, as you have a pro-Trump account. Those senators are against the #MAGA agenda
I love reading the responses to POTUS’ tweets by triggered, immature, uninformed leftists who think they’re doing everyone a favor by yelling at a hand. A fine example are the two Krassenstein dopes. That’s just the tip of the iceberg
The nasdaq composite reached 7000 for the first time, shattering record books. S&amp;P as well. Dow continues to soar #MAGA
If congress approves of the plan to build the wall so desperately needed, plus enhanced border security, among other key promises, I have no doubt the GOP will keep majorities in 2018
