@KendraKat13 You don't know the law. You can't be sued for comments about a public figure. Otherwise, many Dems would be sued for things they say about Trump. And many Rs would be sued for what they said about Obama and Michelle.
@tia48544709 @MmMin57 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Ah, a bot with the name of Meghive. Nice try, #bot.
@KendraKat13 Sarcasm seems to go over your head. https://t.co/bKB6KK863P
@RatedArrrrrr @MmMin57 @iamkatiei @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse I guess stating that Meghan spends too much money that is from the taxpayers is vile. That you consider any criticism of Meghan as vile shows you are an unthinking cult member.
@KendraKat13 Look at your intelligence response!! Typical Meghan Cult Member supporter. A picture of troll dolls and name calling. You are SO clever!!!
@KendraKat13 You said you wanted the tabloids and the Markles silenced. I call that censorship. I was wrong?
@IlhanMN That you could say "It's all about the Benjamins baby" and not know that is anti-semitic?? I don't believe that. Therefore, everything you say I see through the lens of your hatred of Jews.
@RealSaavedra @AOC Which ones were these?? She just keeps at it. Insult, apologize, insult, apologize. I would feel sorry for her, she's new and young and receiving lots of criticism, but she just is relentless in her bigotry.
@WayneDupreeShow Her first statement was anti-semitic. Anything she says after that should be seen through that lens. She just keeps putting her foot in it!
@KendraKat13 Oh, so your cousin was in the Pentagon on 9/11?? I guess that means you have every right to ask for press censorship. Do you know what missing the point means?? And my husband was a firefighter in NYC, working that day, so sit down.
@NorahMackenzie @SoccerNana @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Oh, new rules!!!
@sussexpodcast @SoccerNana @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Says the woman whose entire twitter feed is devoted to a C list actress who had to marry for fame. Irony. LOL!!
@SoccerNana @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Look at the name-calling by a Meghan cult member!! So much for #kindness. Hypocrite.
@kablair @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse So anyone with a negative opinion of Meghan is a troll?? This is the worst PR move of the royals I have EVER seen! LOL!
@dee5269 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse It's KUDOS. Another illiterate Meghan Cult Member.
@Cat61485968 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse So you are an American who is calling for censorship of royal reporters in england whose job is to report on the royals. That is seriously F'd up. You're crazy. Or a bot with that ID. I think a #bot. Reported.
@KendraKat13 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse So you are an American who wants freedom of the press curtailed cause they don't print good stories about Meghan?? That's messed up. Do you want Trump protected in the same way? They are both supported by the public. You want us to be North Korea, then?
@ILuvSummer6 @lademarcia @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Valid criticism is NOT hate speech. You and Meghan can't figure that out.
@ForumsMeghan @JFrances107 Says the cult member with Meghan's picture as her profile.
@Aqarius_girl @ForumsMeghan @JFrances107 @Twitter So you want no freedom of expression on twitter? Censor anyone who doesn't worship Meghan? Does the same go for those who hate Trump? Should twitter censor them, too??
@Barbee_O @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse I just saw a tweet where you called someone who didn't like Meghan an "IDIOT." You are a hypocrite, Meghan cult member.
@ptroyall @MmMin57 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse As much as they would like to be North Korea, KP can only control what people put on their account. Others are free to still be honest about the fame hungry Duchess.
@tia48544709 @MmMin57 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse A huge waste of taxpayer money. And why didn't they do this for Kate??
@Canzaus_Kid @MmMin57 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse libel
@KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse The citizens have every right to complain about her spending and her lack of protocol. Instead of addressing that, you dox people and threaten to sue and arrest them. One would think you are hoping for a republic, cause that's what you are going to get. Let them eat bananas! - MM
@KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse Dear Royals, in 100 years from now, when historians study the worst PR mistakes of the 21st century, this move by Meghan's new PR guy to shut down criticism of the divorced American actress who spends a fortune and ignores protocol will be one of the top blunders of the century.
@MmMin57 @iamkatiei @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily @ClarenceHouse So, should I attach some tweets MEghan's fans sent to me? Called me ugly, old, a hag, jealous, I should die, I should kill myself. You are lying.

@Caliicoder3 @geologistgreg Check out my tweet on @Amy_Siskind - even smart Dems are wary of her and afraid of the damage she is doing to the Dem party.
@mikebwonder I think climate change is real and we ignore that at our peril. I also think the elitist way the far left Dems and all of the nominees are talking about addressing it is absurd and elitist. I live in rural NY - my neighbors can't afford to buy new cars or change heating systems!

@Maxxflyy @scottsantens @johniadarola @AOC Right. NY state sometimes run out of the fuel money that my poorer neighbors get - and they have to beg on Facebook for wood for their stoves to heat their houses. These are working folks, mostly, who just can't make it in today's economy. Rural America is a whole different world
@TeamPelosi @AOC @IlhanMN @JahanaHayesCT @RollingStone Keep listening to them and we will win the House, Senate AND presidency in 2020!!
@johniadarola @AOC You and @AOC: Who pays for my poor neighbors to change their heating systems and cars? You? @AOC? Sounds good but this is one of the most elitist programs invented. You are all clueless re: rural poverty.
@scottsantens @Maxxflyy @johniadarola @AOC Who pays for my poor neighbors to change their heating systems and cars? You? @AOC? Sounds good but this is one of the most elitist programs invented. You are all clueless re: rural poverty.
@scottsantens @johniadarola @AOC The poorest Americans can’t implement these changes the elitist @AOC wants in her Green New Deal! New cars? They drive cars from the 90s! New heating systems? They can’t afford to replace a broken window! Elitist laws for the rich and clueless.

@xan_desanctis And this #infanticide is one of the main reasons I have #WalkAway from the Democrat party. Also, reparations, immigration, #2A, taking away private health insurance and the idea that poor folk will be forced to buy new cars and redo their homes. Dems have gone NUTS.
I’m starting to think I am going to have to run against the Dem for a NY State Assembly seat as an Independent cause the GOP chairperson never gets back to me. Maybe on the Conservative line? MAGA #KAG #2A #StopInfanticide

@LydiaLynn89 True - but there are unions in schools in NY, and also there can be protections for firing teachers for politics or ageism. Blanket tenure is what is damaging to the kids.

@RealJamesWoods OMG!! This was a horrible story!! And so many liberals try to excuse this! You tell who people are by how they treat those they don't have to be nice to. I'm running for office and I've NEVER treated anyone like this!!
And not just lose them to foster care. If you abuse your children, they should be allowed to be adopted by good, loving parents. I'm so tired of seeing abusive parents get their innocent children back.
I know of a young woman 7 months pregnant, who is drinking and smoking crack every day. We can't do a thing about that, cause her baby is not a baby. I want to lock her in a house where she can't get anything, but no...children have no rights. Unfit parents should lose their kids
Under Obama, many children were orphaned and adopted. He even said that would happen. So suddenly, our President is trying to protect these innocent kids who were dragged here, and he is blamed for horrible things. Why don't we do this with unfit parents??
Please explain this to me? Illegals cross the border, some are criminals, the govt takes their children and puts them in foster care so they aren't in tents, locked up, and the government is evil?? Why? Kids can die on this trip, we protect them and we're evil? #ImmigrationReform

@IngrahamAngle The left turn of the Dems brought me back to the R party. Late term abortion, victimhood, the hatred of white people or anyone over 50 since November? I don't even recognize the Dems anymore! Joe Biden is considered conservative!

@MarieAn02268606 @sussex1015 @scobie @GMA I'm quite happy, thanks. And we in the US had to pay for State Dept security for a D list actress married to the 6th in line, here on a private trip?
@LaBelle529 @scobie @GMA Yes, a D list actress who was thirsty AF for fame and couldn't get it on her own meager talent marries a PRince for it, and spends taxpayer money like a drunken sailor. SUCH accomplishments!! ;)
@LaBelle529 @scobie @GMA Did you miss the vehicles with State Department plates? So much for knowing "how things work."
@assassinQuenn @TobiRachel_ Anyone who calls themselves Princess on twitter is either 14 years old, or has some serious mental health issues. Which are you?
@malefiquefawn @ddt959 @chrisshipitv @lizzyprose @MailOnline I'm pressed at the extravagant waste of taxpayer dollars. Charles cut off Andrew, who even has to pay for his own security. William will certainly do that to Harry and Meghan.
@rydoboy13 @SCarter1000 @TobiRachel_ My point is that Meghan has turned her back on her African roots every chance she has. She seems ashamed of her ancestry if you look at how she acts, as opposed to her virtue signaling when she talks.
@sussex1015 @scobie @GMA Hotel, plane costs, security. What do you think they spent?
@LaBelle529 @scobie @GMA It's our money for security, both the UK and USA. For a D list actress who married for fame.
@Barbee_O @scobie @GMA So do you send substitutes when you can't make a party?? How odd is that?
@AngellaMinott1 I should pay attention to someone who is a cult member of a D list actress who had to marry to get fame? A famewhore who spends the Brit's money like a drunken sailor? Sorry, you have zero power to shut me up. Go back to clipping pictures of Meghan and putting them on your mirror
@malefiquefawn @ddt959 @chrisshipitv @lizzyprose @MailOnline What fame did Meghan have? She was able to move freely around in Toronto, no one knew her. She was thirsty for fame her whole life and had to marry a man to get it. Fake feminist and fame whore, that's your gal! And I don't listen to low IQ people who tell me to stay in my lane.
@AngellaMinott1 @TobiRachel_ Here you go, calling me a racist cause you have no real argument. Low IQ Meghan cult members.
@L72457453 @scobie @GMA Her "friends" like Gayle King? Meghan had to Rent-A-Friend to make it look like the narcissist has real friends. Sorry. Not buying it.
@243Fr @scobie @GMA Is this English? It makes no sense.
@Barbee_O @scobie @GMA Really?? Can you link to a list of them there?? Gayle King, too?
@Imnotbovvered @TobiRachel_ No, I just think it's ridiculous that a royal need an American pop star to defend her!!
@ddt959 @malefiquefawn @chrisshipitv @lizzyprose @MailOnline I'm not. For a D List fame monger who had to marry to get fame and fortune. No, stay in England, Meghan.

@GuileneJeanty @scobie @GMA Hey, you are a real sweetheart - just looked at some of your tweets. I think you need to get back on your meds. :)
@GuileneJeanty @scobie @GMA What happened to that #Kindness movement you are all screeching about???
@LaBelle529 @scobie @GMA If they were on official trips, no. If they were here for vanity PR and using my tax dollars, I would have. But they didn't.
@AFarray @TobiRachel_ Another intelligent response from a 14 year old Meghan cult member.
@scobie @GMA 2/2 I can only imagine what Princess Ann says in private about Meghan.	And yes, my USA tax dollars paid for this Vanity Trip for a fame whore.
@scobie @GMA Where were Meghan's friends at her wedding? 	Spending 500K on a 5 day vanity trip, regardless of who paid for it, is terrible tone deaf and drags the royals into Kardashian land, rather than the generally discreet royal way of doing things. 1/2
@lawalazu @TobiRachel_ Why would you like Meghan? She has denied her black roots for most of her life? White friends, white boyfriends only, white husbands only. She doesn't seem to appreciate being biracial.
@SCarter1000 @TobiRachel_ OK, say you like Beyonce. Why would Beyonce like Meghan, a woman who couldn't get fame and fortune on her own, but had to marry for it? Like B or not, she earned her fame and fortune. Plus, Meghan has lived a life in denial of her black roots. All boyfriends, husbands, all white.
@TobiRachel_ BTW, I think Beyonce, who worked hard her entire life and earned her own money, is being sarcastic about supporting this C list actress who married for fame she could never get with her lack of talent. Plus, Meghan has lived a life of denying her African American roots.
@AFarray @TobiRachel_ I can't believe people like this famewh*re who married Harry for the fame she could never get as a low-talent C list actress. Look at her face!! She LOVES the attention. Narcissistic personality disorder, for sure.
@RoyalMarines @KensingtonRoyal Meanwhile, his wife spends $500,000 on a vanity PR trip to the US, using MY tax dollars to secure Duchess of Excess. You really do want a republic, don't you? Cause spending like this is headed that way.
@TobiRachel_ Beyonce is a pop star married to a cheating husband. No one over 16 with any brains cares what she has to say.
@FreedomWorks @AOC Is she still lying about this? Why not just own it as an early draft, mistakenly put onto her website. This young woman can NEVER admit any mistakes. She will have an ugly career if this continues.
@AOC You really have a big mouth and are a very stupid young woman. Thankfully, you are the gift that keeps giving to the GOP. :)
@josephmagazine1 @AOC Not if AOC and the left have any say. It doesn't belong to anyone white or over 50. We should just die.
@AOC 2020 belongs to the Republican party cause you and your nitwit pals kill jobs, want to support those "unwilling to work" and take away my private health insurance. 54% of Dems want the party to be more centrist, yet here you are, blabbing your big mouth off every day. :) LOVE IT!
@AOC @guardian I LOVE you!! While 54% of Dem votes want the party to get more moderate, you and your nitwit pals are pulling the Dems hard left. Conor Lamb, all the other seats you won, you will lose in 2020 and put Trump back into the White House for 4 more years!! #MAGA #KAG #Trump2020
@charliekirk11 @AOC She is a perfect gift to the GOP in 2020. Do Dems like Conor Lamb want her running around killing jobs and supporting those "unwilling to work"? She is going to give the House back to the Rs and help Trump win. Yet, they all cheer her on?? Nuts.
@seanhannity @AOC - a gift to the Republican party. 54% of Dems want the Democrats to move toward the center. AOC and other crazies are hard left and the nominees mostly are following her lead. How do they think that will work out?

So since a man has to support a child, he should have a say in the birth of that child. And if he doesn't, why does he have to support a child? (I'm for supporting the child, btw, just pointing out the hypocrisy!) #Stopinfanticide #KAG2020 #IFB #WalkAway #prolife #Trump2020
For years, when I was a Dem, I used to have huge arguments with liberals over WHY men have no choice over whether their child is aborted or not, but have to support that baby until 18 if the woman gives birth?? Either the man is important or not - can't have it both ways! #MAGA

It's kind of amusing to watch the Dems' heads explode over @HowardSchultz running for Prez. If they are so sure their ideas like Medicare for All are so great, why are they so worried Trump will win?? 🤔 Maybe cause they won't nominate anyone moderate, but rather go with a crazy!

@allbrill @StefanMolyneux I like that Trump is an alpha male. I like that he is a man who has always taken care of his family, his children. Alpha men are not bad - they are necessary for our culture to survive.
@alsoblusierra @ChaseVasic @usethesonic @StefanMolyneux I'm smart, I'm educated, but I stayed home until my kids were in school. I don't criticize women who work, but for me, staying home as a wife and mother was important. I love strong men, love being a feminine woman, and still being strong.
I'm very feminine, I love men, I love dressing like a girly-girl woman with long hair, heels, dresses, but that doesn't make me weak.

@ChaseVasic @usethesonic @StefanMolyneux I never thought about it this way. I'm a woman, very feminine, and proud to be so. Don't need to be screaming like an angry banshee about feminism, and hating men. I love men, and love men being gentlemen. I have a voice, I'm strong, but don't have to hate men to do so.
@StefanMolyneux I'm very feminine, and don't need to be screaming I'm a feminist. I speak out to those who are unfair or men who cross the line. I don't need a Big Daddy to protect me. And I love long hair, make-up, heels and being a girly-girl woman!! Women are mocked for being women.

@neenee_annette @LoriinUtah @nancy_hamm1 Which is fortunate for America. 🤣🤣🤣
@LoriinUtah There are NO moderate Dems!! This election was the final straw for me and the NY abortion law. These crazies are the new Democrat party. Not for me. I was a lifelong Repub, and am back home - these people are nuts! And they hate anyone older and not of color.
RT @2AToddNY: @RepublicanHipp1 @GOP Interested in your potential run.  I'm here on Long Island and cconsidering same.
@2AToddNY @GOP I contacted the county chairman, told him about my return to the @GOP and the reasons I came back. They are going to let me know if they will support me. I am praying they will!!
@2AToddNY @GOP My Assembly woman, NY113, is a Dem who ran a few times and lost. In 2014, she won and the GOP ran a 21 year old against her last time. She won, but not by much. It's a right leaning district, no reason to have a Dem baby killer who voted for the abortion law in that office.
@Consti2tionAlly With rape and incest, I support early abortion if the woman/girl wants it. But EARLY. As in morning after. With drug use, I am conflicted. Many women use hard drugs in their pregnancies, and the damage is great. I really struggle with this. Never after 1st trimester.
@5550nly @KatieFLelite7 @GOP We seem to have turned a corner. I would support anyone with a smart and sane policy. I don't care if they are a man or woman, or what race. But the Dems have become a party of identities.
@USNGunnerDAV @GOP Well, I was a lifelong Republican. I was angry at the Iraq War, and switched, but always voted on policy, so generally Republican.
@carolina52 @GOP I LOVE purple!! I saw it and thought it was lovely! I'm an artist also, so I like colors.
@American1299 @GOP I have no idea. As an adopted woman, I have wondered that for years. Another reason the Dems and I didn't fit.
@Natural74 @GOP Thank you so much!
@5550nly @GOP Who POSSIBLY could think there is any reason to abort a full term baby rather than deliver and put up for adoption? This is #infanticide, last straw from the Dems for me.

@JayneGalt @kayleighmcenany @AOC As an example, I like Joe Biden. He likes Republicans, gets along with everyone, isn't hard left. The new Democrat party has been calling him an old white man whose time is over, and that he will never by their nominee and if he is, they won't vote for any old white. HUH?
@JayneGalt @kayleighmcenany @AOC Right?? Before the election, there were pockets of crazies, but the party wasn't completely hard left. @AOC and other crazies were elected and suddenly we have no compromising, late term abortion, and more. I had to #WalkAway
NY 113 Carrie Woerner voted for the horrible new late term genocide abortion law. I am thinking of running against her since coming back home to the @GOP. Hope to rev up support on twitter once I get the go ahead! #WalkAway #MAGA

@davidharsanyi Hey, as a person who just left the Democrat party because of their hypocrisy over #MeToo, their late term abortions, their hard turn to the left, I welcome Hillary running!! #RunHillaryRun!!! LOL!!!
@IngrahamAngle I work in drug counseling and since the ACA, every clinic has to hire full time people to fight the managed care that used to be Medicaid. These managed programs don't pay, cut down stays, and that hurts people trying to recover.
@IngrahamAngle Good point!!
@IngrahamAngle She is SUCH a hypocrite!! She employed a sexual harasser, so much for #Metoo She had policies as a DA and Atty General that hurt people of color more than anyone else. I wish you would take her record apart, and show she is a phony progressive. Kamala is for Kamala. Period.
@IngrahamAngle I emailed last night! Hope to speak to you! I'm exploring running for NY State Assembly against a Dem rep to overturn this horrible abortion law.

@mcuban The Dems have been running to the far left since the election. That is why I just #WalkAway from the Democrat party and went back to the GOP. There is not center/moderate party anymore.
@JudicialWatch Interesting...I haven't heard this anywhere in the MSM!
@kayleighmcenany The race to the far left of every Dem all of a sudden is one of the reasons I left this past week - they have lost their minds with @AOC and Kamala, who was terrible for people of color! Others will follow and #WalkAway
@RealJamesWoods The far left policies and the ignorance and continual self-promotion of this woman is one of the reasons I #WalkAway. I predict the far left leaning of the Dem party will cause many more to leave the Democrat party as I did.

@The_Trump_Train Yes, you can. Which is why I just left the Democrat party and am looking to run for a state assembly seat again my Dem rep. All #MAGA NYers should step up and run for something!
#ACA #obamacare  OK, so as a Dem, I had been told over and over that the @GOP wanted to take away healthcare of people/remove protection for pre-existing conditions. I HATE parts of ACA - they have destroyed Medicaid w managed care, very limited coverage. Looking for your ideas!
@DianeFiore I would love to run for Congress, but I have @RepStefanik , who I love, in my district. However, Faso was just defeated by the carpetbagger Delgado. Hmmmmmmm..........

@DocJk @WayneDupreeShow Exactly!! I don't understand why any baby would have to be killed for the mother's health when the baby is viable outside of the uterus?? This makes no sense to me at all.

@IngrahamAngle I'm a drug counselor, and black tar heroin is a powerful horrible drug, and it kills!! It needs to be stopped!! #MAGA BTW, I just left the Democrat party. Would love your support in a run for a NY state seat to defeat new abortion law.
@says_beau @anhonyf97 @RealJamesWoods Do you think we would find out if she couldn't serve?? She would never retire!

@BuzzPatterson @BillClinton @hillary Oh, that's wonderful!! So glad I did it, too!! I'm trying to run for a NY state assembly seat to try to fight that new law about abortion. :(
@usminority @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Hypocrite. Employed sexual harasser, brought him to the Senate with her. 	 It's only #MeToo when you are a Republican!	https://t.co/p5qaToCTje
LOL!!! Obama!!!!????!!! https://t.co/pgkEMvGhXT
@usminority This is great!! I'm a brand new member of #WalkAway. I want to run for office as a Republican!!
@usminority @realDonaldTrump I'm so glad you created this!! Just found out about it after leaving the Dems this past week. So excited to come back home! I was a Republican until Iraq War, but the Dems have gotten extreme and hateful. Such a warm welcome back!! #WalkAway
@freedom7930 @proxcee Yes, even kids who are violent can't be removed.
@MaryOsb36485285 @BuzzPatterson Hey, this is why I just left the Democrat party and rejoined the GOP. I want to run against my Assembly woman who voted for this.
RT @BuzzPatterson: So, if you’re a murderer in NY, you can’t be sentenced to death. If you’re an unborn child, you can. That’s where we are…
@BuzzPatterson Yes. This was the final straw and why I just left the Democrat party and I'm going to run for a seat in the NY Assembly. To overturn this and other craziness.
@BuzzPatterson This would be the greatest thing ever for America!! Trump would win in a landslide!
@BuzzPatterson @realDonaldTrump Ooooh, I LOVE this idea!!
@BuzzPatterson @BillClinton @hillary So you no longer support the Dems?? Did you #WalkAway like I just did?????
RT @FuctupMike: It's amazing to me that no one is DEMANDING to know where Ruth Bader Ginsburg is.
@FuctupMike I'm really thinking something is up! If so, I pray for Amy Coney Barrett, bring back some balance on the pro-life issue.
@Pink_About_it She is SUCH a hypocrite!! And did you know about her staff member who sexually harassed someone and the state had to pay a $400,000 payout??? No #MeToo when you are a Democrat! 	https://t.co/p5qaToCTje
@freedom7930 @proxcee Exactly the same!! And no one shot anyone during recess!! The breakdown of the family is causing a lot of these issues!
@JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump
@bigskyjim @Lrihendry 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@Lrihendry Another reason I left the crazy Democrat party!! What the heck?? Dems kept saying this nonsense. Bernie a Russian operative?? He is the only one who talked about the little guy like Trump did. Bye, Dems!! #WalkAway

@realDonaldTrump You are being silly, Mr. President!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@garnet495 @BishopBarron @NYGovCuomo Thanks, Mollysmom!!! I appreciate your good wishes!
@TexasJoeDuck I have always been conflicted. Under SOME circumstances, I support abortion up to 12 weeks and I do support it earlier. If the mother to be has been using drugs, which I see a lot, I support it. But this law is a travesty. It is just crazy to allow this up to term.
@debrahvt I just followed you!! I'm a drug counselor.
@debrahvt Thank you so much!! As soon as the NY State Assembly went Democrat, they passed this horrendous law. We need to take it back!!
@TerrDonCantrell @Pink_About_it I hadn't put this together with Kamala Harris' anti-Catholicism. Disgraceful.
@ghaleyk85 @RealJamesWoods No, don't give in!! And I'm in my mid-50s, and starting my first run for public office!! I may not run as fast as when I was in my 30s, but I'm a LOT wiser!!
@MothrOfADragon @DLoesch No, Ken likes Chai Tea!!!
@AmsRin @DLoesch Amen!!! #2A
@DLoesch Amen!! My daddy taught me to shoot when I was 12 and my mother was on a rifle squad. And many of my poor neighbors don't eat meat if they can't hunt! Not taking my gun away!!! #2A
@DLoesch Another reason I just left the Democrat party. Their complete hypocrisy and hatred of anyone who is pro-life, pro #2a, pro-country.

@RepMarkMeadows Mark, this kind of nutiness is why I just left the Democrat party and came back home to the GOP!! Thank you for all you do to protect America!!
@recallmtibbetts @H2oVolk Thank you!! I'll follow back!!
@Pink_About_it Really...where is she?? If the worst happens, I'm praying for Amy Coney Barrett!!
@Pink_About_it Another reason I left the Dems...the hypocrisy. Kamala can sleep her way to the top, and lie about how her policies hurt people of color more than anyone, B. Clinton can rape someone, but it's ok if you are a Democrat!!
@Pink_About_it Kamala...the biggest phony ever!! Her stint as DA and Atty General hurt people of color more than anyone! And now she plays the big liberal. Just like Gillibrand.
@tnasee @Pink_About_it They can try!! 🤣🤣🤣
@Pink_About_it #WheresRuth
@Pink_About_it I think she is very ill. Why else would she not be around??
@Pink_About_it So mean!! But hilarious!! 🤣🤣🤣
@Pink_About_it Agreed!! This NY state abortion law was the reason I finally came back to the GOP after a decade. Other stuff too, but this especially. I'm running in NY Assembly to defeat this law. Praying for Amy Coney Barrett for SCOTUS!!
@ghaleyk85 @RealJamesWoods Absolutely. I know that won't change the NY state law, but it may change the whole tone. I'm praying for Amy Coney Barrett - the liberals' worst nightmare!
@garnet495 @BishopBarron @NYGovCuomo I am. I emailed the County Chairman and they asked for a resume and letter of intent explaining why I left the GOP and why I came back home. I hope I was convincing.
@archangel333777 @BishopBarron @NYGovCuomo Thank you!! I'm praying I can succeed.
RT @sistronk: Welcome back!!!! 🙌🏻❤️ https://t.co/oTfxNJxMi6
@sistronk Thank you!! It feels so good to be home, on the side of those who care about life and protecting Americans!!
As an adopted woman who respects all life, this new law in NY has gotten me to change parties. I am disgusted at my rep in NY113 for voting for this.
Thank you to all my new #MAGA friends for all the Follows!! I just sent my letter of intent to my county chairman to run for a NY state assembly seat to help defeat this horrendous new abortion law.
Kamala Harris' office paid $400,000 out for an aide who sexually harassed a woman and Kamala didn't know?? It's only #MeToo when you are a Republican @KamalaHarris https://t.co/p5qaToCTje

@RealJamesWoods This is the final straw and my reason for leaving the Democrat party. I am going to try to run against my state assembly legislator, who voted for this abomination.
@BishopBarron @NYGovCuomo Bishop, I just left the Democrat party over this, and I'm going to run for a NY state assembly seat in NY to help defeat this. This is pure evil.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany If they pick Kamala, Trump will keep WI, MI, OH and FL. Gillum was supposed to win and DeSantis wiped the floor clean with him. I think only Biden has a chance, and the Dems don't want him cause he's old, and white.
@jdvskyfrog I actually live in a pretty moderate area. Not a very Dem area. So I have a chance!!!
@raftersranch17 @KLWorster @GOP I agree...I can't even understand who might think this is remotely a good idea.
@beanie402 @GOP Thanks for letting me know.
@says_beau @anhonyf97 @RealJamesWoods It really is weird that she has been missing. I don't know if she died, but I don't think she is doing well. #WheresRuth
@raftersranch17 @KLWorster @GOP I hope so!! I hope to help end abortion and especially late term abortions. It is a crime and absolutely disgusting.
@freedom7930 @proxcee Yes, in some rural schools where I have lived, it used to be that way, too!!
@Education4Libs As a recent ex-Dem, I approve this message! #WalkAway
@brithume More craziness from the liberals. This is why I and many others have #WalkAway!!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Stay strong Sarah!! So much abuse of you here. Dems only like women when they are liberal. Otherwise, they are sexist jerks.
@RealJamesWoods James, who would replace her, if she did pass away?? Praying for a pro-life justice - I am running for state assembly in NY to help defeat the new horrible late term abortion law. :(
@ghaleyk85 @RealJamesWoods I'm not ageist, but she falls asleep and seemed seriously ill. And her replacement may help with abortion and the new NY state law may be easier to defeat.
@RealJamesWoods You should get this trending! #WheresRuth???
@Havoc_70 I will on you, too!! Just sent a letter of intent to my new GOP County Chairman!! Hoping they let me take the Dem on who supports late term abortion. Good luck!
@charliekirk11 Cause they are hypocrites??? Another reason I just left the Democrat party. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #WalkAway
@cnn interviewing Brian Maienschein for leaving the Republican party. Why don't they ever interview people like me, who #WalkAway from the extreme Dems, the party of abortion and division????? #MAGA
@jdvskyfrog Thank you, Gunner!!! 🌞🌞🌞 I just filed a letter of intent with my county's GOP chairman. Fingers crossed!!!! 🤞🤞🤞
@mikeossur @LadyThriller69 I just washed my hands of the Democrat party. They are extreme on abortion, guns, and hating anyone over 40, and any woman who isn't liberal.
@LaylaAlisha11 OMG!! So Beto got fewer votes than we thought!! LOL!!
@LadyThriller69 You are smart and beautiful!! Bravo!!
@nodror @LadyThriller69 @AOC @realDonaldTrump Right?? She is quickly making herself into a ridiculous meme!! With Dems like her rising, Trump will have an easy path to victory!
@LadyThriller69 @AOC @realDonaldTrump The worship of this nitwit and other extreme left wingers who do not deal in ANY facts is one of the reasons I just left the Dem party. They just care about having young, dopey people in their party.
@TheBreckWorsham My kids are all young adults now, and they are the same. They are great, compassionate people!!!
@Hatmanslyvanbea Thank you! I saw it firsthand, and I can't abide their hypocrisy anymore!! 👌
@Familyvalues100 @NRA Thank you, PJ!!! Much appreciated! It's so nice to be back home!
@angel4thelost @MarkGeistSWP Exactly!! And why don't the Dems see this about either of these women?
@deanhcross @ValKHeadley @SandraTXAS This is true.
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris She is SO arrogant!! And she had policies that hurt people of color over and over again. Then runs as a liberal. #Hypocrite

@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris What are her thoughts of employing a man who paid out a sexual harassment suit AND taking him to the Senate with her?? #MeToo is only for the GOP.
@Havoc_70 @plaidshirtguys @cvpayne @KamalaHarris I sure do!!! 🤣🤣🤣
@Havoc_70 @plaidshirtguys @cvpayne @KamalaHarris Right??? LOL!!!
@plaidshirtguys @cvpayne @KamalaHarris Go read how horrible she was to people of color. And Attorney Generals do push for new laws. 	https://t.co/38R2IbK5Vo
@NealHudson10 @SandraTXAS @codeofvets As a recent Dem, it's the hypocrisy that sticks in my craw!!
@SandraTXAS Another reason I just left the Dems. Kamala sleeps her way up, hires a sexual harasser, and that's all OK. But God forbid a Republican do anything wrong?? They are called immoral, disgusting, vile. Compare how they supported B. Clinton and vilified Trump. #hypocrisy
RT @brithume: Sorry to see @tombrokaw catching hell for saying Hispanics need to do a better job of assimilating. This proves that any crit…
@brithume @tombrokaw This is one of the reasons I just left the Democrat party, among others. They have gone even further into the party of identity politics and there is no disagreeing with them, or you are abuse and called vile and racist. It's crazy.
@angel4thelost @MarkGeistSWP It's always all about Hillary. Always. Kamala is the same.
@MarkGeistSWP That would be GREAT for the GOP - up and down the ballot!!
@oldpcgamer @NRA Exactly!!!!
@NRA My daddy taught me to shoot when I was 12, and my mother was on a rifle team!! Their hatred of guns is one of the reasons I just left the Democrat party. #2A
@proxcee My daddy, an exUSMC, taught me to shoot when I was 12, and my mother was on a rifle team. The Dems think guns are evil. It's a huge issue I've always had with them.
@chuckwoolery Hillary is all about Hillary. Just like Kamala Harris is.
@garnet495 @GOP Thank you!!
@cazfasho Thank you so much for the nice welcome!!
@GailWind55 @SaraCarterDC @RepAdamSchiff @DonaldJTrumpJr That will never happen!! The MSM doesn't even discuss any of this!
@johncardillo Who would Trump nominate if Ginsburg leaves??
@RealJamesWoods We have to secure our borders!
@TheMaverick_M @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris Another reason I just left the Dem party and came back home. They are losing their minds over Kamala and @AOC.
@HowardSchultz I think you should run if you like. If you win, that's fine. If Trump wins cause centrists peel off of the Dem party, who have lost their minds with people like @AOC determining policy, then they deserve to lose.
Come on, @GOP, give the new Republican who came back home some follows!!! I want to run and need to get my profile up there!!
@renato_mariotti @HowardSchultz Let him run!! If his candidacy gives the victory to Trump, then that is what America wants.
@costareports This is great news for Trump!!
@qanon76 We do, and mine is to make up for my mistake of changing to a Dem!! I came back home and I'm going to run for office as a Republican!!
@Melishous @marsinahmuraka1 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Thank you!! I'm following you now!!
@Kugelerd At least the GOP doesn't kill 9 month old fetuses. That was the final straw for me.
@Melishous @marsinahmuraka1 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods This is the issue that put me right over the top. I am nauseous when I think about it and didn't know what to do - so I decided to change parties and run for office to stop it.
@DiamondandSilk Of course she did!! Only Dems are allowed to rape women (Clinton,) hire sexual harassers, (Kamala) and sleep your way into office!!! It's ignored or celebrated!!
@premierepastime Thank you!!!
@rlewis3841 @OANN She is SUCH an opportunist!! As DA and Atty General, she had many policies that hurt people of color, such as her locking up single mothers for truancy. Suddenly, she is the Great Liberal Hope!! Ugh. She and Gillibrand, both of them!
@MyPupDaisy @OANN Part of why I just left the Dems is their abject hypocrisy and lack of shame. I didn't vote for Bill Clinton cause he was a rapist! And Kamala also employed a sexual harasser for years, brought him to the Senate with her! #MeToo is only for the conservatives!
@MarkYoungTruth And in NY, it's ok to kill them the minute before they are born!!
@chuckwoolery It's OK!! She's a Dem!! And it's ok that she had a man on staff for years who was a sexual harasser!! #metoo only applies to GOP!
@born1938 @w_terrence @KamalaHarris The Dems not HATE anyone old or not a person of color.
@debrahvt @kimusastrong @CraigAr64 Thank you SO much!!!!!
@SaraCarterDC That never hit the MSM!! Shocked!!
@Melishous @marsinahmuraka1 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Bless You!! I am amazed at how nice Republicans are on twitter! On the Dem side, they are ageist, sexist against any woman not a liberal and vile!
@Brass0331 @Melishous @marsinahmuraka1 @RealJamesWoods I have found nice people again!! The Dems are so vicious - if you don't agree with everything 100%, they just attack you and are vile!
@GailWind55 @SaraCarterDC @RepAdamSchiff @DonaldJTrumpJr You never hear that on the Dem side. This is new to me. I have lots of research to do. Thank you!!!
@debrahvt @kimusastrong @CraigAr64 Are there any local groups? I looked at #WalkAway on twitter, but didn't see any local groups.
@marsinahmuraka1 @Melishous @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Hey, Friend, we should make a support group!! Are you going to run for office? I am! I talked to the county chair today, have to send over some stuff for them! I'm SO excited!! Dems never wanted me - over 40, white, moderate.
@LeslieBessette The link is broken??
@MZHemingway Schultz has my former party members absolutely crazed with the idea of him running. :)
@JohnBurchardt @Livenjesus9 @GOP Why do you say that? I’m not aware.
@DoingRight1 @RicMaldonado2 She has become a joke, a meme for big mouth, little brain. Or at least very few facts.
@KarenOliver30a I think we need sane people running.
@AnthonyBauman5 @zinniasinmay @usminority @GOP Thanks! You too!
@KarenOliver30a @Maureenhommagm1 Thank you so much!
@BrantleyStephen @MZHemingway She was actually a pretty bad "cop," who targeted people of color with her policies. But the Dems ignore that.
@steve_litvin @MZHemingway Same as Gillibrand. Both have changed their tune when becoming Senators. 	https://t.co/mp6iZoiFNO
@Atticus1971 @MZHemingway And how her stint in the DA's office and as Atty General targeted people of color
@MZHemingway PS - She is a DREADFUL speaker who is NOT a progressive. Her reign in the DA's office and as Atty General targeted people of color AND she employed a man who paid out a sexual harassment suit and took him to the Senate with her. So much for #Metoo
@MZHemingway Progressives also get away with being sexist, ageist and making homophobic jokes and other progressives applaud. That always bothered me.
@zinniasinmay Sure, just message me!
@Kugelerd Not much to associate with the Dems right now.
@unknown_sgt @dbongino The Democrats won't run a woman who is over 40 anymore. Not in my area.
@LT47415009 Thank you LT. Much appreciated!
@blive1 Thank you, Ben!! Appreciate it!
@jdvskyfrog @Maureenhommagm1 Thank you, Gunner. Appreciate your nice words!!
@AfricamSueW @chicksonright Thanks for explaining your thinking. I appreciate it.
@socalpony2 @Maureenhommagm1 LOL!!!!
The Democratic party - they not only tolerate, but they celebrate AGEISM and SEXISM against any woman who isn't a liberal.  #WalkAway
@AfricamSueW @chicksonright Now you are sounding like the Dems I just left cause they are so ageist!
@chicksonright Well, he is better than Kamala. More dangerous to us, at least.
@JohnLegere Only if you follow me!!
@jato791 @magaxxoo @RealJamesWoods I despised Clinton, loved the first Bush and GW, but really opposed the war. But this is a war on America, on babies, on gun owners, on any woman who isn't a liberal. I couldn't take it anymore. 👍🇺🇸
@babar7519 @GOPChairwoman Thanks!!! If I do, I'll announce on twitter and need MAGA help!!
@charliekirk11 They just lost me. I became a Dem after Iraq war, but I'm done. Abortion, gun laws, disrespect for women who aren't liberals, the mocking of anyone over 40. I'm going to run for state seat to overturn this law in NY as a Republican.
@greta Maybe to upset @realdonaldtrump	It was cruel!!!
@bw01052017 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods For me, it was abortion and the attitude toward anyone over 40 and many women who weren't liberals. How hypocritical!! My daddy taught me how valued I am, I was a real Daddy's girl, and he valued ALL women -  I can't believe how the left treats women.
@wrath04 @ColobusFelton @NRA Thanks, Spence!! Everyone here is SO nice!! The Dems rip you apart if you think for yourself. I have trauma from having an opinion as a Dem!!
@AndiThompson12 @Maureenhommagm1 I pray so, too!! I am working on all of my friends and family who are still Dems! #walkaway
@wllmwlcxsn @Maureenhommagm1 Thank you so much!!!
@Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Amen!!! 💙❤️💜
@cazfasho I agree...and not have hypocrites continually tell everyone how to live!!
I am SO glad that I decided to #WalkAway from the Dems, the party of late term abortion, witch hunts, gun control and hating anyone over 40. So glad to back in the GOP, and looking to run in NY for state assembly to overturn that horrible abortion law. You all are SO kind! 💙💋
@Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods I just saw that!! Thanks for letting me know!
@cazfasho The Dems would HATE YOU!!!! They say MAGA folks are mean and rotten - they are VILE to anyone who doesn't love AOC and Kamala.
@CliffClavin5 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Yes, to punish those who succeed is so counterintuitive.
@bevj13533001 @DiamondandSilk Oh, lovely!! Adultery, then.
@zinniasinmay @usminority This is one of the main reasons I just came back to the @GOP. I want to run against the co-sponsor of the abortion bill.

@usminority I just woke up....I was a Republican until the Iraq War, but just walked away from the Dems...abortion, gun control, witch hunts, AOC and the hatred of anyone over 40 and white, piling on if you don't support AOC and Kamala....I'm done!!! @GOP forever!!
@wllmwlcxsn @Maureenhommagm1 Thank you, Bill!! I appreciate your good wishes!!
@cazfasho Thank you!! Feels like coming home to people who don't hate me because I"m over 40 and, gasp!!! White!!!
@debrahvt @kimusastrong @CraigAr64 I just #WalkAway! I was a Republican, switched after the Iraq War, but needed to come home. The Dems have lost their minds!! I need support!!
@claudiaswright @SpeakerPelosi @WCKitchen @chefjoseandres And @AOC voted against opening the government. Such a hypocrite!! She wants ICE abolished. It's a solution from a 5 year old to a complicated issue!
@KathrynJStock1 @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC Oh, me too!!! I just did #WalkAway. The NY abortion law, AOC and the new Dems who all hate anyone white and over 40, gun laws...I'm done. I'm going to run for office as a proud REPUBLICAN!!! So excited!
@Maureenhommagm1 Just did!! And going to run for office as a PROUD REPUBLICAN!!!
@BrianCo83157832 @realDonaldTrump Me, too!!! #WalkAway
@Maureenhommagm1 I just did #WalkAway from the Dem party. The new abortion law in NY, gun control nonsense, AOC and the other far left Dems who hate anyone over 40 who isn't white...I am done. I am looking to challenge the state assemblywoman who sponsored the abortion law. Wish me luck!!
@jato791 @magaxxoo @RealJamesWoods Thanks, Elaine!! Did you #walkaway too?? :)
@realDonaldTrump If the Dems nominate Kamala Harris, you will win in a landslide.
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren @RepStefanik God Bless You, too, Friend. :)
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The economy is booming, Trump tries to help the little guy and is thwarted by the so-called party of the people, and the Dems are going so far left, they won't nominate anyone over 60 who is white. Done.
@MikeCbodyguard @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Not surprising. She made laws that were horrible for people of color and now she is trying to pretend that she is all sorts of liberal. #hypocrites.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes!!! I just left the Dem party and came back to the GOP because of her nonsense, AOC and the young Dems hatred of anyone over 40, NY's new abortion law and gun issues. Would like to run in NY113 to take out the Dem there. :)
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren @RepStefanik I know that now!! LOL!!! Nice chatting with you!
@dbongino When they make statements like this, they make themselves look unreliable. They don't need to do that anymore than they do already.
@cvpayne @KamalaHarris And I may never get rich, but if I did, I don't feel I need to give 70% of it away!!!
@cvpayne @KamalaHarris Kamala is SUCH a hypocrite!! When a prosecutor and Atty General, she continually pushed for laws that would disproportionally hurt people of color and now she tries to claim the liberal mantle. Sheesh.
@AndersOdegard2 @SaraCarterDC @RepAdamSchiff @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL!!!! That's funny!!
@SaraCarterDC @RepAdamSchiff @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm confused. He wants Mueller to compare them?? So if anything is different at all, then it's perjury?
@Brass0331 @BobDunville @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods I don't think we have them in NY. :(
@19harvey30 @pr_barnett @dbongino Oh, yeah!!! That would be awesome!! Would love to go to that. I was too young for the first one!
@RealJamesWoods This is true, and they have ceded any moral high ground with this abortion law in NY. They lost me over that so I switched. Also, the young crazy Dems who hate any of us who are over 40, sane, fact based.
RT @RealJamesWoods: This is the greatest threat to the viability of our Republic since the Civil War. #IllegalAlienInvasion #DemocratVoterF…
@BobDunville @DanimalVet @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods I voted for Trump in 2016 even though I was a registered Dem. I liked the attention on the little guy. Bernie did that too, and once he was out, I had to vote for Trump. 👍
@munnu789 @brithume @AOC How rude!! My daddy taught me to never converse with an abusive person. Have a good day.
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren They seem to have left me. I was always a conservative Dem, voted for @RepStefanik, despised the phony Gillibrand, really hated Hillary, I liked Bernie, though!! He and Trump were saying a lot of the same things about the little guy, so I had to vote for Trump. Glad I did.
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren I was a lifelong Republican, but I was very upset over the Iraq War, so I switched. I voted policies, never party since then. Now, the abortion law in NY, the hatred of all guns, this nonsense 70% tax, and AOC and other new Dems - they and their followers all hate anyone over 40.
@Brass0331 @BobDunville @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods That's a lot of common sense! Don't expect the Dems to get it. :)
@Brass0331 @BobDunville @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods That sounds very interesting. That is true. Those who can get out, do get out. Those who can't are left behind to be preyed upon. Much of our immigration issue would be helped if we could help those countries help themselves. 👍👍👍
@KeeAmericaGreat @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods I wonder if my area would do that. That would be terrible. But the GOP ran a 21 year old against my state assemblywoman, Carrie Woerner, NY113 last time. She wasn't going to win. A sane adult would.
@BobDunville @DanimalVet @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods I knew Trump would beat Hillary because he talked about the little guy who lost his job, the companies putting trillions offshore. I wanted him to make progress on these issues, hope he still does it.
@DanimalVet @BobDunville @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods I understand what you are saying.
@LeslieBessette @JudicialWatch Thank you!!! Much appreciated!!
@Brass0331 @BobDunville @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods I would, but NY needs more sane Republicans. This Republican area with a co-sponsor of this horrible abortion law has a liberal Dem rep. I think I can beat her.
@RicMaldonado2 Thanks for the nice note and the Follow!! Yup, they are cutting their own throats, following these crazy new Dems and throwing out anyone with experience. Except Hillary - they would embrace her again. 🤣🤣🤣
@munnu789 @brithume @AOC The hypocrisy of those who excuse @AOC yet crucify Trump is astounding. Lies are lies.
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren I know!! Me, too!! I paid them off. And yes, the issue is tuition. Lots of great colleges are holding on to their huge endowments instead of helping the kids get an education. And I agree - my daughter is paying off a huge loan!
@BobDunville @DanimalVet @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods At this point, so am I. Not many other choices.
@CliffClavin5 @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Thank you!! I hope they will accept me, since I just came back to the GOP! Fingers crossed!
@jfcsoup @Brass0331 @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods OMG!!! I am definitely calling tomorrow to find out about running against her!
@chicksonright @AOC is another reason I just left the Dem party. She and her followers hate anyone over 40, anyone who isn't a minority. They are vile!
@chicksonright The new law in NY was the final straw for me. Just left the Dem party and rejoined the GOP. I want to run for a state seat to help defeat this law. I'm beyond disgusted.
RT @chicksonright: The Democratic Primary is going to be something else. https://t.co/fuaL3uB9lk
@chicksonright A bunch of hypocritical women. I'm out.
@chicksonright I just left the Dem party and want to run for a state seat in NY. Can I join the Chicks on the Right??? :)
@davidwebbshow @GOP @LamarAlexander @susancollins @CoryGardner @JohnnyIsakson @lisamurkowski @MittRomney @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump I think Trump should just declare an emergency and get it over with.

@Brass0331 @DanimalVet @RealJamesWoods My state assembly rep is a Dem and is far left. I'm sure she supports late term murder of babies. I'm calling the county tomorrow and asking how to run. Thank you so so much!!
@OmarHamada This is so disgusting, I just left the Dem party and went back to the GOP. I want to run for a state seat against the Dem in my area to help fight this terrible new law.

@conservmillen This was it for me. Just changed my party from Dem to GOP. This is murder. I want to run in NY for state assembly to try to get rid of this.
@RealJamesWoods I'm still trying to get my head around this story!! I really don't like her at all, and she has a HORRIBLE speaking style and voice. And cackled like a crazy woman today!! Ugh. The Dems have gone around the bend.
@DanimalVet @Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods Who would you vote for?? I want to run for office in NY for a state assembly seat, to try to get rid of this horrible abortion law. :(
@ColobusFelton @NRA If feels SO good!! My daddy taught me to shoot a rifle when I was 12 years old, my husband was a cop and we used to go shoot and I was better than he was!! Guns are not the problem. Crazy people are!
@Lisacpc1 @RealJamesWoods Thanks, Lisa!! Feels good to be back home!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💚💚💚
@Janis67381570 @RealJamesWoods Thanks, Twinky!! It feels great to be back home!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@MarshaBlackburn @VP Congratulations!! Do good work!!
@Brass0331 @RealJamesWoods They are going so far left, they are going to destroy themselves. Moderate Dems like me are going to leave.
@RealJamesWoods James, I just left the Dem party over abortion, gun control craziness and the new Dems' hatred of anyone over 40, anyone who is not a person of color running, and their crazy 70% tax rate. They are losing their minds.
@Franklin_Graham Good for them! I'm going to run for office to help fight this law. It is disgusting.
@Franklin_Graham @NYGovCuomo This was the final straw for me. I just left the Dem party and came back t the @GOP and want to run against the Dem in my area for her state seat to get rid of this. Anyone want to support me, I'm going to start looking into this. This has to stop!!
@rcbvt @ZaackHunt I'm saying here in NY that I just switched parties and I'm going to run against the Dem in my area for a state seat and work on changing this law. It is disgusting.
@ZaackHunt Why would a mother have to abort at 39 weeks rather than deliver? This was the final straw to make me leave the Dem party. It is infanticide.
@BBN1971 @theartistrandal @The_Trump_Train Thanks!!! Saw the light again!! I can't wait to vote and may try to run in NY against a Dem to get rid of this late term abortion law. Just sickening.
@19harvey30 @pr_barnett @dbongino Thanks!!! It took me awhile, but I saw the light again and came home to the GOP!! Can't wait to vote!!
@RealSaavedra I have noticed that it is ok for Dems to make homophobic jokes all of the time. Why is this?
@RealSaavedra Jake Tapper is the most annoying and idiotic person on tv.
@JudicialWatch I hadn't heard this! The MSM won't tell us this, that's for sure!
@TideAc @dcexaminer @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump 👍👍👍	Nothing.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump This is amazing!! I am a drug and alcohol counselor and I really admire him for doing this!!! 💋💋💋
@TexasJoeDuck @MonicaCrowley Thanks! Much appreciated.
@LeslieBessette @JudicialWatch You have any good places to find out what is the truth. You know the MSM hasn't told the truth.
@TexasJoeDuck @MonicaCrowley Thank you!! I wish you well, too. I can't run as an Indep, that is an issue here. I would like to help heal the party. Be well!!

@realDonaldTrump We haven't been able to give free education, free healthcare, because we have been paying for the security of countries that have been able to do these things. We need NATO allies to step up more!!
@LindseyGrahamSC The Dems have to compromise and give some money for the wall, and maybe they can be given something. Both sides need to give!!
@TexasJoeDuck @MonicaCrowley The Dems are done...lost their minds. Hate anyone over 40 and the abortion issue? I'm pro-choice, but before 12 weeks. I think the GOP can be brought back to sanity, like we had with GHW Bush. I want to run in NY to help do that.
@AnnCoulter I left the GOP after the Iraq war. I'm back to the Republican party because the new Dems are crazy liberal, hate anyone over 40, are disgustingly immoral on abortion, nuts on guns, 70%?? I have seen the light!!
@kausmickey Jared seems like a very metro wimp.
@AnnCoulter This is funny!!! Old technology can have its uses.
@Perrylegal @JudicialWatch And she always supporter her husband the pervert. This hypocrisy always bothered me.
@JudicialWatch Nothing in the MSM about this. I used to kind of, reluctantly support her, but if she is crooked, she needs to pay.
@JudicialWatch Is this true?? I used to support her, but if she was doing illegal things, she should be held to account - hard to get a real read from MSM.
@Amerwilbgrtagai @DiamondandSilk Her voice is really grating, and she laughed and laughed, it was embarrassing. 🤣🤣🤣
@MagPieSC1972 @ZacRutherfor @ChrisChastainSC @LindseyGrahamSC So are Dems. They just lost me in NY with their late term abortions. I changed my party to GOP and I'm going to run in NY as a Republican now.

@LindseyGrahamSC Did she really say this?? @AOC is the worst thing to happen to Dems.
I just left the @TheDemocrats and rejoined @gop. The new Dems like @AOC hate anyone over 40, anyone wealthy except politicians, hate facts, hate the truth, are hypocrites, support late term abortion, hate all guns, etc. etc. Looking to run for office in NY113 to bring sanity back
@DaveBal58143517 @MonicaCrowley And the new Dems hate anyone over 40. Another reason I just left the party.
@MonicaCrowley Oh, dear God!! This is a horrible idea for Dems.
@TexasJoeDuck @MonicaCrowley Well, I left the GOP after Iraq, but just came back after a dozen years as a Dem. They have lost their minds on many, many issues.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The Dems have to admit that this is a concern. I don't understand why they won't do it!
@rolltidecorndog @Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren True, but the interest is like 12%, which is unfair when all other interest rates are so low.
@Spiralgrove @SaraCarterDC @ewarren This is an issue. I wish Trump would talk about this. He would have the support of all of the millenials.
@SaraCarterDC @ewarren I'm done. Just left the Dem party for this 70% nonsense, abortion and hatred of any guns. I was a Republican and I'm back. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 Can't wait to vote! And I want to run to knock out a Dem state assemblywoman who is HORRID!!! NY 113!
@munnu789 @brithume Then why can't she come prepared with actual numbers? She just makes up crap as she goes along.
@brithume Ugh!!! The worship of this nitwit is one of the reasons I just left the Dem party and changed back to Republican. She just makes things up, and then they say Trump does that. She can't get anything right!!
@GOPChairwoman Yup. I just left the Dem party cause they left me. The new Dems hate anyone over 40, anyone who is the least bit moderate. Proud new Republican! I want to run for office. We need sanity in my area!
@GOP They need to shut up about this 70%. It is never going to happen, that @AOC is a dope, and they are giving the election away. Dopes.
@GOP Raising hand!!! Moderate Dem who just left the Democratic party. I can't stand @AOC and her lack of facts, their late term abortions, their complete hatred of any guns, and I want to run for office as a Republican, which I have been most of my life.
@EricTrump Really?? That is an amazing thing. Thanks!
@DonaldJTrumpJr That was really rude.
@Livenjesus9 @GOP This is true. I'm a substance abuse counselor, and you will get suboxone and sent out the door, even with medicaid or Obamacare.
@GOP And Kamala had policies that were horrible for people of color, but liberals all praise her to high heaven!! Hypocrisy. The Dems have left me, and anyone sane.
@clave123567 @DiamondandSilk Hypocrisy at its finest. Many people say they are for immigration so their pool can be cleaned cheaper.
@DiamondandSilk 100% - why is this so hard??? Just enforce the laws!!!
@Amerwilbgrtagai @DiamondandSilk She didn't get it from her public speaking skills. She is a HORRIBLE public speaker!! I was stunned at how bad she is.
@DiamondandSilk Was Harris married at the time? I can't get a straight story from the MSM.
@Crazyworldstop1 @DiamondandSilk Oh, dear!! LOL!
@DiamondandSilk Kamala Harris had policies that were HORRIBLE for black people, so why is everyone cheering her on? The hypocrisy of the Dems and other horrendous policies made me just leave the party and become a Republican again.
@DiamondandSilk I love you guys!! You are awesome!
@Mason40392794 @theartistrandal @The_Trump_Train Working on them seeing the light. Any party that allows late term abortion have lost their way. That's just one of a dozen crazy things happening.
@Mason40392794 @theartistrandal @The_Trump_Train Thanks!! I'm talking to all of my friends about what is going on - ageism, sexism against any Republican women, infanticide. Ugh.
@rneuffer @dbongino @AOC and the phony Kamala Harris are going to put Trump back in office. The Dems might win with Biden, but they decided he's too old and too white.
@dbongino After seeing how new Dems are behaving, &amp; watching how they all seem to hate anyone over 40 and white, I left the Dem party and came back to the GOP. Abortion, gun control and their unwillingness to allow politics to determine Trump's fate sealed it. I want to run for office!
@mediadudester @marklevinshow @AOC would be bringing her morality and leaving her numbers in her office. Along with her brains. (Sorry, she just seems SO dumb!)
@marklevinshow Can't wait, Mark!! I always enjoy your show.
@pr_barnett @dbongino I love America, I'm very moral, and I'm not Christian. I love to dance in the forest and love Mother Earth!! LOL!!
@dbongino I was a Dem for the last 10 years. I had been a Repub until the Iraq War. I think liberals feel everyone needs a fair shake and schools and the law can seem disproportionately harsh on minorities. So now they want Kamala Harris, whose policies targeted black people. Hypocrisy
@dbongino I haven't had a chance to really figure out what is going on in Venezuela. Can anyone recommend a good read on this?
@JesusMHernand13 @oakej9207 @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano How about women who actually talk facts, not make up numbers and then say morality is important, not facts when Anderson Cooper called her on it????? She is such a hypocrite!
@oakej9207 @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano Is she as abjectly ignorant?? Ugh. I can't stand how dumb she is. She gives women a bad name!
@RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano That's funny!! People like Milano, @AOC, they hypocrite Kamala Harris, abortion and gun control are why I just left the Dem party. They seem to now hate anyone over 40 and any sane, common sense policies.
@The_Trump_Train Maybe @AOC was running around with her video camera, watching everyone accused of wrongdoing instead of doing any actual, um work, and learning facts and numbers???!!!???
@The_Trump_Train Do you think they leaked it?? Or was CNN watching?

@HJMarshall2 @The_Trump_Train Even if you are pro-choice, how can you support abortion after life is viable?? This is one of the many reasons I just left the Dem party. Another is @AOC and the party of identity. :)
@theartistrandal @The_Trump_Train I am SO disgusted over this, I just changed my party from Dem to GOP. Ugh. Sickening.
@The_Trump_Train This is one of several reasons I just left the Democratic party and came back home to the GOP. I'm not totally against choice, but to allow abortion until the moment of birth? This is so immoral, I can't stand being a party to it anymore. What are the Dems thinking?
@marklevinshow I don't understand how he was supposed to win all along and then DeSantis came along and just kicked his butt. How were the polls so wrong??
@amgilstrap1964 @marklevinshow The Koch brothers are all about money. That's it....that's all they care about.
@NRA One of the reasons I just left the Democratic party and want to run for office as a proud new Republican is their absurd stance on guns. Guns are not the enemy. Crazy people are.
@2Nicco2 @NRA I don't like his hypocrisy.
@NRA One of the reasons I just left the Democratic party is their total opposition to any guns. Many of my neighbors don't eat meat all winter without hunting. We need to be sensible again!!
@SteveKerr Nicolle, do you think the GOP will run someone against Trump in 2020?
@RepStefanik Thank you for standing up for the working people in our area!
@SaratogaGOP Hi, I'm very interested in running for office in NY 113 for 2020. Is there someone I can call? Thanks much!!
@NeganTrading @AOC Thanks!! I have had a couple of businesses too. Still working on them!
@NeganTrading @AOC Yes, unless you are trying to start your own business!! Then, it is so much harder to get traction and get going!
@NeganTrading @AOC That's not the divide. The divide is between those who work, those who can't work due to disability, and those who refuse to work. If you work, you should get a fair wage.
@redwavebret @AOC As a smart blonde, I appreciate this!
