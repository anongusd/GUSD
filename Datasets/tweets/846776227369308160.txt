@FredfromFlorida @JimLoCascio84 American Patriots strongly opposed the taxes in the Townshend Act as a violation of their rights. Demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company.https://t.co/6bXNr3pvUn
@FredfromFlorida @JimLoCascio84 In 1913, the 16th Amendment was ratified, permanently legalizing an income tax.The Boston Tea Party was a political and mercantile protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 16, 1773. The target was the Tea Act of May 10, 1773
@FredfromFlorida @JimLoCascio84 State and federal inheritance taxes began after 1900, while the states (but not the federal government) began collecting sales taxes in the 1930s. The United States imposed income taxes briefly during the Civil War and the 1890s.

@JerryH1501 4  Thousand  dollars a  month is what S.S.&amp;  SSI , SSDI   should be a  month . If  the state would stop  funding  adoptions  they could  finacially aford to give  the people raises but  they  will  REPLACE  us instead . That is why the altright chanted  you will not replace us
@JerryH1501 I  went  yesterday  to look  for a apartment . A one bedroom in Melbourne Florida is 1 thou  dollars. If someone only gets 700  or a thouin disability or  SSDI that is not enough  for rent  or food.and this is causing people to be homeless. SS &amp; SSI     should be 4 thou a month.
