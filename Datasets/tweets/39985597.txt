I’m not a pearl clutcher, but I don’t know why a great school like Purdue would spend so much tine worrying about IU. Maybe I needed to grow up here, but I tend to think it makes Purdue look small when they do that. And it’s not necessary. https://t.co/ZEFQxJwkID
At 6-5, I thought they were average at best. When they started winning, I thought they might win an NCAA tournament game, tops. Now I don’t know what to think. So I’ll just stop thinking and just appreciate this Purdue team. By ⁦@DustinDopirak⁩  https://t.co/eQFFrrhcXg
Well played. https://t.co/9D1DcxOZWU
The more I watch the Pacers, the more it bums me out that Victor got hurt. Really think they could have made the EC Finals with him. Not that they’re doomed now, but it’s hard to see them getting that far without their top player.
Really impressed that Matt Painter would take the microphone during Senior Day festivities and implore Purdue fans to stop with the IU sucks chant in the future. He’s right. Purdue is better than that. And IU should be better than the garbage they yelled at Matt Haarms.

@bnl1988 Last two years? Not good. For his entire time at IU? I’d have to think about that one. But Archie is his signature hire. If he doesn’t work out, that will be a reflection on the guy who hired him.
I have thought about it. But I’m inclined to see how Allen and Miller perform. Both have only been at the job two years. https://t.co/s2NKEpW84m

@DavidBROeller @TYHilton13 Yes they were boyhood friends.
Brown may be bad news, but the Colts aren’t putting together a church group. Any team has flawed, difficult and even lousy human beings on it. I’d do a deep dive on Brown, consider the cap impact and any trade issues, and go from there. One of the best WR in the league.Gotta look
Johnson was 34 while Brown is 30. I see what you’re saying, but I’m not sure it’s an apples to apples comparison. https://t.co/2KlBRIRDp0
I don’t think they’ll make a great effort to get him, but I would look long and hard at it: Can you imagine Andrew Luck with Hilton, Brown, Ebron and Doyle? Yikes. https://t.co/SHUhCZz6oA
If I’m the Colts, I’m doing my due diligence on Brown. You can talk all you want about culture, but defensive coordinators lose sleep thinking about how to stop elite wide receivers, not defending culture. (Stole that from Rick Venturi). https://t.co/XJJlOsqJNv

Kravitz: Colts are a playoff no-show against the Chiefs, but there's still cause for optimism  https://t.co/yRXsrvoLwP
Colts offense finally does something, Luck to Hilton for the TD, but it's too little too late. And Vinatieri misses the PAT. Missed a 23 yard FG try earlier. Crazy.
This reminds me a lot of that 41-0 playoff loss to the Jets many years ago. Colts just outclassed in every imaginable way. Even the offensive line is having a rough day. Luck: pedestrian. Hilton is hurt. Not much going right.
Luck gets strip sacked because, of course. KC ball.
Darius Leonard with the strip and the Colts are set up at the Chiefs' 20.
What was Denico Autry doing? Stupid. Shameful.
Vinatieri hooks a 23-yard field goal try wide left, an almost perfect ending to a horrendous first half for the Colts, who trail 24-7. Got 4 first downs the whole half, all on that final drive. Four defensive penalties, A drop. Bad stuff.
First downs with 1:40 left in the first half: KC 18, Indy 0. Colts have run 12 offensive plays for 12 yards. That's it.
Mahomes scrambles and gets in for another touchdown. Right now, Andy Reid is having his way with the Indy defense. 24-7. Indy's goal before half: Get a first down. Like, on.
Colts block the punt and recover in the end zone for a touchdown. Goode with the block and Pascal with the recovery. There's life. KC, 17-7.
Incredibly, the Colts do not have a single first down. A horrendous performance against one of the league's most porous defenses.
Well, that's kind of a victory for the Colts, limiting KC to a field goal. Still...17-0.
Another defensive penalty keeps the Chiefs second drive alive, and then Hill goes around left end 36 yards for the touchdown. This is going south very quickly. KC 14-0.
An Ebron drop on Indy's first possession. Two defensive penalties on KC's first possession.. Chiefs go 90 yards in 10 plays for the touchdown. Chiefs 7-0.

We think Coutee scored a touchdown there, but it's being reviewed. Hard to see it overturned. Colts, 21-7 -- tentatively. The good news is it took 16 plays for Houston to score. Still 10:57 left in the game

On the play, Inman was wide open in the end zone If Watt doesn't make that play, it's 21-zip.
Just like last week in Nashville. Colts could have put the Texans away, but Watt deflects the Luck pass at the line and it's intercepted.
Kenny Moore with the interception on the Texans' fourth-down try. Indy ball at the 50.
Think that's gonna be hard to overturn.
Colts ran 7 times for 50 yards on that drive. That's a very good sign.
Colts look unstoppable today. Reich putting on a playcalling clinic. Mack goes in from two yards out and it's 14-zip Colts. A dream start.
So much for Houton figuring out a way to slow down TY -- first drive, three catches for 63 yards.
That was easy - well, relatively so. Luck hits TY for 38 yareds, then finds Ebron from 6 yards out for the opening-possession TD. Colts, 7-0.
I would really like to see the Colts play a lot of no-huddle, up-tempo today. Gave the Texans fit earlier this season.
Could be an important contributor for Houston. Had a good game against the Colts the first time the two teams met. https://t.co/qH6PyNSFoQ

A ton of hockey coverage. https://t.co/eK0TLMF0GX
Incredibly, the Colts are going to the playoffs. Play at Houston Saturday. Go figure.
The Colts are close to becoming just the third team since 1970 to start 1-5 and reach the playoffs. Wasn't supposed to happen this quickly. But it has. Great story.
After the Titans turn it over on down, the Colts get it at the Tennessee 8 and Mack runs it up the middle for the touchdown. Vinatieri with the missed PAT and its 33-17 with 2:24 left.
Wilkins' TD run was negated by a penalty -- again -- but Vinatieri kicks a short field goal and the Colts are in good shape, lead 27-17 with 3:58 left.
Kenny Moore with a huge interception. Colts need to make this a two possession game here.
Somehow, it's still a game. After a short punt and a nice return, a long Henry run and a pass to Stocker for the TD. Colts lead, 24-17, with 1:47 left in the third. Totally one sided game everywhere except on the scoreboard.
I don't know what they said on TV, but I was wondering why Vrabel accepted the illegal block in the back penalty. If I'm on defense, I'd rather give Luck just one chance on 3rd and 17 than two chances 25 yards away. I didn't get that.
Luck to Hewitt for the TD after the Colts convert on the third and long on the Tenn penalty. Huge drive. Colts lead 24-10.  Big play was pass to Inman, who continues to shine.
No clue why Vrabel accepted that illegal block in the back penalty.
RT @HolderStephen: Total domination by the Colts everywhere but the scoreboard: 		Total yds: IND 253, TEN 97		TOP: IND 20:39, TEN 9:21		Pas…
Succop with the 38 yard field goal to finish off the first half, with the Colts somehow leading only 17-10 despite near-complete domination. They've basically gifted the Titans with their 10 points.
Somebody needs to tell the Colts it's no longer gift-giving season The pick six, the fumble by Mack that took at least three off the board and now the silly late hit.
Vinatieri from 53 yards for a very large field goal. Colts 17-7 with :39 left in the first half.
TY not a decoy on that play.
Great play by Tennessee's Jayon Brown. Strips Mack and recovers the fumble after the Mack reception with the Colts in scoring position. Colts have dominated, but turnovers, turnovers.
Adoree Jackson misplays the Rigo punt, Milton recovers for the Colts. Indy ball on the 9.
What was that? Luck has been nearly perfect all game, and throws a ridiculous pick-six. Held the ball too long, tries to make a play that wasn't there. Titans are back in it.
Great throw, great catch by Ebron for the TD. The Colts are dominating. Completely. Two long TD drives and it's 14-zip Indy. 90 yard drive, 16 plays. Wow.
TY is largely a decoy at this point. He's really gimpy at this point.
Luck was 7 of 8 for 87 yards on that opening drive.
Dontrelle Inman has been a revelation this season.
Colts go on a game-opening 12 play, 92 yard drive, Luck 11 yards to Inman after scrambling away from the rush. If Tennessee can't get a rush on Luck -- and they're playing without Casey and Orakpo -- it's gonna be a struggle. Colts, 7-zip.

Anthony Schwartz for the touchdown. It's 49-7 with 5:36 left in the second quarter. If I'm a Purdue fan, I'm going to Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and forgetting this ever happened.
Blough's pass is deflected, ball ricochets to Big Kat Bryant - yep, that's his name -- and he runs it in for the touchdown. Now 42-7 with 12:29 left in the second. Oy.
you are correct and I was not -- thanks for pointing that out -- https://t.co/e5WkE51CK2
Purdue has one Rondale Moore. Auburn, it appears, has a bunch of them, at least athletically speaking. Slayton takes the screen and out-runs the Purdue defense for a score. Second play of the drive. Auburn, 35-7 and we've just started the second quarter.
Welp, that didn't take long. Second play of the drive, Stidham hits Slayton for a 74-yard bomb. Had plenty of separation on the Purdue defender, redshirt freshman Kenneth Major. 28-7. Still in the first quarter.
Purdue with a terrific answer, finish off a 78-yard drive with a Rondale Moore jet sweep from the 7-yard line. Auburn leads 21-7.
Whitlow in from one yard out. Now it's official. 21-zip. Not sure how long Brohm will stay with Blough. He's looked very skittish. Also, Auburn has a heck of a front four.
After review, they say Stidham's knee was down short of the goalline. No TD. Yet
Two plays after the interception, Stidham keeps and goes in for the touchdown It's 21-zip and there's 7:10 left in the first quarter.
Blough throws a horrendous interception and it's Auburn ball at the 18. Getting away quickly.
Rough start for Purdue. Cason drops a sure interception and probably a pick six, then Auburn goes on an 87-yard drive to score another touchdown Auburn, 14-0. This is the Auburn team its fans expected it to be this season.
On third play of the first possession, Auburn fakes the QB run, Stidham steps back and lofts a TD pass to a wide open Whitlow. 66 yards for the score. Auburn, 7-0.

Hooker with the interception and that's it. The Colts survive 28-27, Now time to watch Pittsburgh and New Orleans.
Colts have climbed all the way back after trailing all game. Luck to Rogers from one yard out and Indy leads 28-27 with :55 left in the game,
Huge stop by the Colts, limiting NY to a 27-yard field goal after another long Giants' drive, NY leads 27-21 with 9:20 left in the game
Colts are keeping pace, another long drive, bailed out by a defensive holding on a strip sack/lost fumble. Then Mack from 1 yard and it's Giants, 24-21 with :32 left in third.
This looks like vintage Eli, and he's had plenty of time to throw today. No pass rush from the Colts. Giants take a 24-14 lead on a Manning sneak after a long pass to Evan Engram down to the 1 yard line
Colts coming alive, score a TD on their first possession of the second half. Key play, a 55-yarder to TY, Scored in 2-yard TD pass to Inman. Giants, 17-14.
Kelly (neck) and Ebron (concussion) are both gone for the game.
RT @AWalkerColts: Injury update: C Ryan Kelly (neck) is QUESTIONABLE to return.
Colts answer with a terrific TD drive, finish it off with a one-yard run by Hines. Giants up 14-7 with 4:09 left in the second quarter.
If Luck has thrown a worse interception this season, I can't recall it. Tries to throw it away and it's easily picked by the Giants. Horrendous.
Not sure if Desir thought he had help over the top from Hooker or not. Either way, receiver was wide open. Colts have done a great job of keeping plays in front of them this year, but not that time.
Horrific start by the Colts. Penalties, giving up long plays, just brutal. Giants lead 14-zip late in the first quarter. Trap game, for sure. Time to get to work.

So it New England beats Pittsburgh in the 4:30 game and Baltimore continues to beat Tampa, the Colts will control their own destiny. Win out and they're in the playoffs. In a rebuilding year. After starting 1-5. Go figure.
Colts beat a Houston team that had won nine in a row. About to beat up a Dallas team that won five in a row. I'm telling you, nobody wants to see this Colts team in the playoffs.
Colts have done everything they needed to do Kept Zeke and Cooper under control. Ran the ball. Played beautiful complementary football.
Vinatieri with a chip shot after a 12 play drive, two defensive penalties on Dallas, ate some clock. Colts 23-zip with 6:57 left. This is a butt-kicking.
I haven't had a chance to watch the other rookies who are up for the Def. ROY award, but if there's anybody better than Darius Leonard, I want to see him play. Leonard with a huge fourth-down breakup. Colts have stopped Dallas on two huge fourth downs.
The ultra-efficient Colts are winning with running and defense. Another drive, their fourth scoring drive in five possessions, Vinatieri hits from 45 yards. It's 20-zip with 1:36 left in the third
I'll be curious to see how committed the Cowboys stay with their vaunted running game. Trail 17-0 but it's early third quarter.
Coming into this game, the Colts weren't supposed to be able to run the football on Dallas.  Well, never mind that. Mack dominates Indy's first drive of the second half and scores from six yards, and the Colts lead 17-0.
Colts with a very nice two minute drive, culminates in a 43-yard FG by Vinatieri. Colts up 10-zip at half. Cowboys dominated TOP but it didn't matter. Thirty-eight plays and no points.
TY may never practice again. Missed all of practice and was a game time decision this week, and he's out here making plays.
How was that not intentional grounding on Prescott?
Still trying to figure out why TY got flagged for taunting. You see anything? Water under the bridge, but that was curious.
Fourth and 1 from the 3, Zeke gets stuffed by Hunt and Adams. Great play by Hunt, getting penetration. Adams cleaned it up. Huge play.
Took a couple of tries, but Mack punches it in from the one and the Colts lead.
Love the Colts coming out in no-huddle after the blocked field goal. Getting Dallas on its heels. First and goal at the one.
Maher field goal blocked by Autry. Leonard runs it back for the TD, but after review, the return is properly overturned.  Colts ball at the Cowboys' 44.

RT @JakeArthurNFL: T.Y. Hilton has now broken Marvin Harrison's team record (11) for career 150-yard games.
Andrew Luck is pretty good. Makes some gorgeous passes, ultimately hits Pascal for a 12 yard TD and the Colts lead 24-14. Luck with 313 yards passing. And he had 14 yards passing in the first quarter.
Houston goes for it on fourth and inches at the goalline. Go with direct snap to Miller, who runs it in for touchdown. Colts still lead 17-14.
During the 9 game winning streak, the Texans have averaged 172 yards rushing per game. They've got 36 in the first half; Watson the leading rusher with 31.
Andrew Luck threw for 14 yards in the first quarter. Threw for 233 yards in the second quarter. Mostly up tempo.
Heck of a scoring drive there. Got the ball on their own 11 with 1:14 lleft in the half and walk away with a Vinatieri 54 yard field goal. Colts 17-7 at halftime.
Colts have gone up-tempo here in the second quarter and their eviscerating this Houston defense Luck to Ebron for the TD. Colts lead 14-7.
TY in Houston. Because he owns the Texans down here, Luck to Hilton 60 yards, then Mack 4 yards for the touchdown. Tied at 7. Amazing what happens when you catch the football.
Would have been a tough catch for Passcal, but he's got to haul that in. Instead, it goes off his hands and Houston intercepts First good Indy drive and they end up with nothing.
This is the same Indy offense that averaged nearly 35 ppg through five games before last week's shutout. Now they look inept.
Not sure what Hooker is supposed to do there? Hit the receiver with his shoulder. Should have been a Geathers interception.
Colts commit three defensive penalties on the drive  and Texans take a 7-0 lead on an Alfred Blue run up the middle. 7-0 Texans
Ruled incomplete.
Ebron with the drop that would have been good for  first down and now Swoope bobbing catch near the sideline, being reviewed. He catches it clean, its a first down.
Colts don't blitz much, but when they do, they make things happens,
Colts need to be really smart about the way they rush Deshaun Watson. Kind of a mush rush, can't let him get outside the pocket, where he's so dangerous.

Kravitz: Reich’s risk-taking crosses the line into recklessness – The Athletic https://t.co/1tQGvNNbv4
I can't recall ever seeing a Luck-led offense look this lost and inept for such a lengthy stretch of a game. Jags are just dominating.
Jacksonville goes ahead 6-0 with 11:42 left. Right now, the Jags defense is absolutely overwhelming Indy's offense.
At half of this barn burner, it's Jags 3, Colts 0. That is all.
Jags dent the scoreboard, go ahead 3-zip with 2:03 left in a generally dreadful first half. By both teams.
Got to take the points there. This is a terrific Jacksonville defense. And it's not like Kessler is going to put up big numbers. Reich got greedy there.
Just a poor decision, poor throw by Andrew Luck. Simple as that.

Colts hold on, 29-26. Brutal second half performance but a big win that keeps Indy relevant.
Shows what I know. It's overturned. Fumble. Colts ball.
That's gonna be really hard to overturn. Ball started to come out when Greene's knee was close to hitting the ground. Hard to see them overturning.
Vinatieri is wide right from 52 yards and Jax will take over at the 42 with 2:53 remaining. Colts have not scored in this half.
Lambo kicks a 55 yarder with 4:03 left in the game, and a 29-13 lead has turned into 29-26. Colts must deliver here on this drive.
Colts driving, but Luck pass is bobbled by Alie Cox and Tevin Smith intercepts for the Jags.
Lambo misses a 53 yarder -- his first miss of the season -- and Colts continue to lead 29-23.
RT @Colts: Andrew Luck joins Manning and Brady as the only players who have thrown at least 3 TD passes in 6 consecutive games. https://t.c…
Great long drive by Jax to open second half. Bortles with an easy 1-yard flip to Fournette for the touchdown. Colts now lead 29-23. Fake field goal was the huge play on the drive.
The firing of Bobby Petrino can mean only one thing: They're going to come hard and heavy after Jeff Brohm. Will he jump? I don't know, but if he does, I couldn't blame him. It's his alma mater, so many connections at Louisville, grew up down there. Gonna be hard to say no.
At half, Colts lead 29-16 after a late Jacksonville field goal. Luck 16 of 20 for 217 yards. Ebron three touchdownns. Most first half points by the Colts since 2014.
After Jags penalty, Colts opt to go for 2-point conversion from the 1-yard line and convert. Indy leads 29-13.
Call upheld. Touchdown.
On second thought, he lost control as he went out of bounds. Being reviewed.
Jags still have a highly rated defense, but you'd never know it. Colts with a 75-yard drive, Luck to Alie Cox from one yards out, and it's Colts 28-13. Offensive masterpiece.
Almost forgot: Colts defense isn't very good. Jags drive for the Fournette touchdown in six plays. The PAT is blocked by Autry, recovered by Walker, who ran it all the way back, but called back because of a block below the waist. Colts lead 21-13.
One coverage breakdown after another for Jax...Luck lobs an easy pass to wide open Ebron (yes, him again) for Colts' and Ebron's third touchdown of the day. Colts lead 21-7 and look unstoppable.
Creative play calling by Reich, Sirianni: Luck hands to Ebron on a jet sweet sort of play and he runs easily into the endzone for the TD. Colts, 14-7.
Colts receivers are continually wide open against the league's No. 1 rated pass defense.
Bortles hits Donte Moncrief for an 80-yard bomb and a touchdown. Brilliant throw by Bortles, who simply owns the Colts for some strange reason. After PAT, the game will be tied. Probably.
Luck to Ebron, 53 yards, for the touchdown on the Colts first possession. That's Ebron's eighth touchdown catch this season. Indy, 7-0. Not a bad start, to say the least.

I just hope the tie they turned into a loss isn’t the difference between making and missing the playoffs. Houston would be 4-3-1 and Indy 3-4-1, just one game out of first instead of two games behind. Colts have second easiest second half schedule and play 5 of 8 at home.
Love you too Becky. Just trying to be realistic. https://t.co/U3pV3KST1D

Make no mistake, this o-line group has improved dramatically, but it should, right? Three first rounders and a second rounder. Pretty good pedigree. Lots of hope for the future but two, three games don’t make you elite. No yet.
Elite?  They’ve had two tremendous games. Against two terrible teams. Let’s see a bigger sample size before making that pronouncement. https://t.co/g0i8ABu8o4

RT @ByJerrySullivan: Bills go over 300 yards for the first time all season! Try to look on the bright side.
After the Moore interception, Mack runs it in for the touchdown. But for the second time today, Vinatieri misses the point after. Strange. Hasn't been kicking it well all day. Colts up 37-5.
Luck rolls out and finds TY for the touchdown. Time of the score: 13:13. Colts lead 31-5. It's a different game when you don't make a bunch of mistakes. And it helps that Buffalo doesn't have its quarterback or running back. Still, terrific performance.
Strip sack by Turay, recovered by Wilson, who runs it down to the 2 yard line.
Ryan Kelly's shotgun snap eludes Luck, rolls out of the back of the endzone for a safety. First significant mistake of the game by the Colts.
After the Mitchell interception (and he's been a nice addition with Geathers and Farley out), Vinatieri kicks a 36 yarder. Colts, 24-0 at halftime.
Welcome back, T.Y. He hauls in a short touchdown pass and the Colts lead comfortably (I think) 21-0 with 1:38 left in the first half. Excellent run-pass balance today.
Buffalo whistled for two penalties, ball is placed on the 1 yard line, so Colts going for two. Mack runs it in and it's 14-0.
Luck checks it down to Mack, who is completely uncovered and runs 29 yards for the touchdown. Vinatieri PAT is good this time. Colts lead, 13-0.
LeSean McCoy has been ruled out of today's game due to a head injury.
Buffalo driving, but Anderson pass to Clay is fumbled, forced by Mitchell, recovered by Leonard. Being reviewed but I'd bet it's confirmed.
All Swoope does is catch touchdown passes. Grabs another one from Luck for the touchdown,  but Vinatieri misses the extra point. Colts, 6-0.
Turns out McCoy is being treated for a head injury, not his leg.
LeSean McCoy is heading into the lockerroom after injuring his leg.

Never thought I'd see the day when Purdue would crush a great Ohio State team, but it just happened, 49-20, and the fans are rushing the field. Can't say I blame them. What a night for the Boilers.
Rondale Moore is an absolute marvel, and to think, he's a true freshman. Takes a short Blough pass and makes magic on the way to another Purdue touchdown. Boilers, 42-20 with 3:37 remaining.
He did it again. Purdue's D.J. Knox goes 40 yards for the touchdown, and barring a miracle, the Boilers are going to pull off the epic upset of No. 2 Ohio State. Now 35-13 with 6:46 left in the game.
Ohio State finally gets into the end zone, Haskins to Dixon for the score. Purdue, 28-13 with 9:36 left in the game.
Purdue is putting it to Ohio State. Knox takes a quick handoff up the middle on third and 9 and goes 42 yards for the touchdown. Purdue leads 28-6 with 11:39 left.
By my unofficial count, that's Antonio Blackmon's third pass breakup in the endzone tonight. Purdue keeps Ohio State out of the end zone after they had four cracks at it inside the 8 yard line. OSU has been in the red zone four times, just six points.
Purdue comes right back with a touchdown drive, aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on a Purdue punt. 73 yards, 10 plays, Knox from one yard out. Purdue, 21-6. It's happening....
Haubeil kicks a short field goal and Ohio State pulls within 14-6.
Haubeil? We're so far up in this press box, you can't see numbers. https://t.co/BclYVGT0Pj
One play later, Blough rolls right and hits Rondale Moore for the touchdown. Purdue, 14-3 over No. 2 rated Ohio State.
Jeff Brohm, folks. Purdue fakes a 30 yard field goal as the holder, Schopper, runs for a first down. That's how you pull off an upset. First and goal at the OSU 9 with 31 second left in the first half.
After a 15-play drive, Ohio State kicker Sean Nuernberger misses a 33 yard field goal attempt. Purdue still up 7-3 in a surprisingly low scoring game.
Purdue's defense stiffens after Ohio State gets to first and goal at the 7, Buckeyes kick a 24 yard field goal. Purdue, 7-3, early second.
Officials gave Purdue a big break on that scoring drive. On the big screen play, Knox fumbled forward and out of bounds. Ball should have been placed around the 17 rather than the 12, which earned Purdue the first down.
Purdue caps a 98 yard drive with a 13-yard TD pass from Blough to Zico. Boilers lead, 7-0. Fifteen play drive.

Pacers' 29-rebound advantage over the Grizzlies is the team's biggest rebounding disparity since 2003.
Pacers 109, Grizzlies 83. And it was never close. Total control all game long.
Sabonis with 8 points, 8 rebounds and there’s still 6:45 left in the first half.
Pacers are on an 18-2 run and lead the Grizzlies 41-18. I say a running clock is in order.
Pacers are out rebounding Memphis 20-5 and have built a 34-18 second quarter lead. Pretty dominant performance.  All this and Oladipo has just one point.

10. https://t.co/XpI7SUlhKe
Luck to Rogers, 17 yards, for the touchdown to pull within 42-34 with 1:51 left. Onside kick coming up...
Since Chris Ballard took over, the Colts are 5-17. When Jim Irsay said he was willing to get worse before he got better, I'm not sure he was figuring on them being this bad.
If I'm not mistaken, the Jets have scored on their last eight possessions. Not good.
That may be the back-breaker. Luck throws into coverage, gets intercepted, not sure he ever saw the defender, and Jets have it again in scoring position.
Colts are making rookie Sam Darnold look like a six-year vet. Jets come away with another field goal and make it a two possession game, 36-27 with 9:40 left in the game,.
Colts receiver Ryan Grant has an ankle injury and he's out.
Luck to Swoope for the touchdown and it's a game again, Jets lead 33-27. Once again, he's been terrific, as has the offensive line, especially in pass protection.
Myers with a 37-field goal for the Jets and it's 33-20 with 3:53 left in the third.
Colts finally get some productivity from the running game (Marlon Mack) and then Luck hits Ebron for the touchdown. It's 30-20 Jets with 8:44 left in the third quarter.
Darnold to Herndon who was so wide open, a Colts receiver could have caught the ball (maybe). Coverage bust, you would assume. Jets zip right up the field with the first possession of the second half and it's 30-13 Jets. Following up a terrible half with more terrible stuff.
Awful. Jets get the ball at the 28 yard line with 42 seconds left and come out of it with a short field goal to take a 23-13 lead. Just a complete defensive breakdown. This is a winnable game, but the Colts are finding ways to lose it.
After the interception, the Jets go backwards but Myers kicks a 48-yard field goal and the Jets lead 20-13. Still 1:25 left and the Colts have two tight ends. To score, though, may involve actually catching the ball.
Turbin has a shoulder injury, return is questionable
Two picks, both off Luck's receivers' hands.
Grant bobbles a catchable (tough but catchable) ball and New York intercepts, the Colts third TO of the first half. Brutal. Can't anybody here catch a football?
Wait, I thought I was supposed to be the snarky one. https://t.co/ad0MOOLygL
You might be onto something. https://t.co/WsVDuw9tiY
The Jets, the worst red-zone team in the league, score the go-ahead touchdown on a Darnold pass to Terrelle Pryor. Take advantage of the Turbin fumble. Jets lead 17-13.
Just catching up...Turbin fumbles, Jets recover and now New York has it first and 10 at the Colts 21 after a first down pass.
Shades of the Philly game: Colts have issues in the red zone, settle for the Vinatieri field goal after the Jets fumble. Two turnovers in Jets territory leads to just six points. Colts, 13-10.
Pass caught by Kearse, fumble forced by Leonard, Colts recover. Set up at New York 41. Second turnover forced by Indy.
First and goal at the 1-yard line and no Robert Turbin...please explain.
This will come back to bite them: Colts had first and goal at the one, two plays get stuffed, then Hines drops a sure TD pass. Vinatieri with the chip shot and the game is tied at 10.
Intercepted by Hooker. First of the season. Colts ball at the Jets' 35.
Jets put together a long drive, finish with a 30-yard field goal by Jason Myers. Jets lead 10-7, 4:33 left in the first quarter.
Colts respond, Luck steps up in the pocket, Marcus Johnson makes a nice adjustment and Luck hits Johnson 34 yards for the TD. Tied up. Strong response.
Nice start: First, Rogers drops a catchable ball. Then Mack bobbles a screen pass, ball ricochets to Claiborne, who runs it in for the touchdown. Brutal. Jets, 7-0.
I will after the Jets game. Promise. https://t.co/8r1EVOaqRj
Colts inactives: Hilton, Geathers, Maulet, Good, Doyle, Hunt and Autry. Mack and Castonzo are good to go. Glowinski to start at right guard and Braden Smith at right tackle. Newcomer Mike Mitchell will start for Geathers.

Luck threw 62 passes Sunday. He's throw 58 tonight. That 120 passes in four days. That's gotta be a record, no?
OK, Luck to Ebron for the meaningless touchdown. Pats, 38-24 with 1:11 left.
After review, officials say Swoope was down at the 1/2 yard line.
Luck hits Swoope for the late touchdown, Swoope's second of the game. Luck is throwing the you-know-what out of the ball, but he needs help. Like a running game. Receivers who can catch. Stuff like that.
Farley has a hamstring (of course...they all have hamstrings) and he's done tonight. Might have pulled it while posing for the mock photo after his interception. (I'm sorry, but I hate that stuff...when you're losing).
One minute, they were back in the game, down by just a touchdown. And then the roof fell in, like it always does in New England.
Pascal bobbles a perfect pass, ball ricochets to Patriots for the interception. One play later, Michael runs in for the touchdown. This is one of the worst performances i can ever remember from a group of receivers. Brutal.
Brady has all the time in the world and hits Gordon for a 34-yard TD. Ball could have been intercepted or knocked down, but was misplayed by Milton and Farley.
Luck has been brilliant except for one mistake. Hits Swoope from 13 yards and it's 24-17 and we've got a football game. Credit the Colts for playing through all the injuries and mistakes. They're making the Patriots sweat.
Scoring change: The Gronk catch and fumble has now been ruled as an interception, which should not make Tom Brady happy.
One thing we can clearly say: Andrew Luck is back. You could see it vs Houston and he's throwing well again tonight. Just doesn't have anybody who can catch passes.
Terrible drop by Chester Rogers. Terrible.
RT @BenVolin: Patriots have 9 giveaways this season. They had 12 all of last season
You get what you pay for. https://t.co/WFsHBhBdiM
Gronk fumbles after getting hit by Farley, ball ricochets to Goode, who grabs it. Colts are hanging around, but can't keep making mistakes. Got to play error-free the rest of the way if they want any chance.
Wilkins makes the catch for a first down, then gets stripped and loses the fumble.
Good news: Farley with the interception. Bad news: A bunch of guys ran to the endzone and posed for a faux photo. You're losing. Stop with the histrionics. (Get off my lawn!)
Autry is officially out of the game with a hamstring injury. I believe the Colts will be heading back to Indy in an ambulance. Been doing this a long time, and never seen a team quite this depleted by injuries.
After a nice Rogers punt return, the Colts take advantage of field position and Luck hits Ebron for the touchdown. I could, however, live without Ebron blowing kisses to the crowd, but that's just me. 24-10 Patriots
Geathers with a neck injury and concussion and he's out of the game.
Denico Autry has a hamstring injury and is questionable to return.
Another drop. And another drop. And another...  Luck is not getting much help tonight
After the interception, Gostkowski kicks a 45-yarder and it's 24-3 with 13 seconds left in the half. If you didn't see this coming, you just haven't been paying attention.
Luck, under duress, throws a poor pass that's intercepted by Patrick Chung.  Thirty eight seconds left in the half.
Brady to White for another touchdown. Not sure what the Colts were doing defensively there. Not much. Too easy. Pats, 21-3 with 1:34 left in the half.
Margus Hunt is questionable with a knee injury and Walker is out with a concussion.
Geathers questionable with a neck injury.
Vinatieri from  54 yards is good. Patriots, 14-3. Colts pass protection has improved since that first drive. But, then, how could it get worse?
Geathers in concussion evaluation, we've been told.
Just wondering, have they called an offensive player for lowering his head this season?
Brady sneaks it in from one yard for the TD (14-zip) but I'm most concerned with Geathers, who took a head shot. You just hope it's not his neck again. Will keep you updated.
I'll take your word for it. We're pretty far away here in the press box. https://t.co/vJ68MuYgEh
After the Edelman drop, Colts pull themselves together and put together a very nice drive. But Vinatieri hits the upright, no good, from 38 yards. Wonder if the injured groin played a factor. Just don't see that very often.
Anthony Walker in concussion evaluation.
Three and out for the Colts. Luck sacked by everybody for a loss of 10 and then Ebron drops a short pass that would have come up way short of the first. Punt. Get used to it.
Castonzo is not starting. Smith and Clark at the tackles.
Well, that was easy. Brady to Patterson, one yards, for the touchdown on the opening drive. Brady was 9 for 9 on that 12 play, 75 yard, 6:02 drive.

It’s been a couple of hours and I still have no idea what Frank Reich could have been thinking. https://t.co/oduBPIv1bn
Looks to me like while the Colts practice fiscal discipline, the fans are following suit. Smallest Colts crowd in the short history of Lucas Oil.
Fairbairn is good from 37. Houston wins 37-34. Reich has some explaining to do.
I like Reich's onions and I'm sure some analytics will show it was a smart move, but I think he got a bit far over his skis on that one.
OK, so now the offense is headed back out there. Try to draw them off again? Nope. Incomplete, low throw to Rogers. Houston ball with 24 seconds left at the Colts 43. Crazy.
Colts are going for it fourth and four at own 43. Probably trying to get them to jump offsides.
Colts keep Texans out of the endzone, Fairbairn makes a chip shot and it's tied at 34 with 1:50 left in OT.
Johnson drops a sure first-down pass and the Colts will have to try a 44 yard field goal. Vinatieri is good -- of course he is -- and the Colts lead 34-31.
Pascal and Hines have really come of age during this comeback. Colts driving again, first-and-10 at the Houston 33.
This is the Andrew Luck the Colts missed the last year-and-change. And give credit to the O-line, which played well down the stretch and gave Luck time to make plays.
Indy will get the ball first in overtime.
Fairbairn will attempt to win it from 59 yards and it's...short and right. It's heading to overtime. Unreal.
Luck hits Rogers on a runn-pass option for the two point conversion and, incredibly, this game is tied at 31 with 45 seconds left. Nine plays, 85 yards, 2:13 on the game-tying drive. Colts trailed 28-10 early in the third.
Andrew Luck is at his best in the no-huddle. This is a recording.
Brilliant drive by the Colts and they're almost all the way back. Luck to Hines from 9 yards. Need a 2 pointer to tie. Thinking Indy Special.
Houston with an important, 10-play drive, several third-down conversions...Fairbairn with a 40 yard field goal and it's 31-23 Houston with 2:58 remaining.
TY Hilton has a hamstring injury and will not return to the game.
Luck catches the Texans napping, finds Ebron in the endzone for the touchdown. Remarkable drive when you consider they stopped themselves three times with holding penalties. Two point try is no good. Texans, 28-23 with 7:41 left.
With a fourth and 7 at the Houston 42, Ebron commits a false start. Pitiful. Now the Colts will punt.
Odd playcalling. Two runs on second and third down, both completely blown up. This O-line is getting worked over, and it's not just the reserve tackles. Clowney has been quiet all season -- until now.
Desir with the interception of Watson. Colts will take over at the Houston 45.
Finally, somebody caught a contested pass. Hines with a nice TD reception, Colts pull within 28-17 with 5:14 left in the third quarter.
Now THAT'S what Indy has been waiting for: Luck deep to Hilton.
How is that intentional grounding? Watt got a piece of Luck's arm on the throw. I thought.
Thus far, the Colts best offensive play is a neutral zone infraction committed by Houston.
By the way, this is the smallest Colts crowd ever at Lucas Oil Stadium. Announced crowd is 57,716. That's just 86.1 percent of capacity. Can you blame anybody?
Reviewed, upheld, touchdown Texans. They lead 28-10.
Watson with a keeper for the touchdown on Houston's first drive of the second half. This defense is gassed. Smart of the Texans to go uptempo there. Texans, 28-10. (But the TD is being reviewed).
Colts cornerback Kenny Moore is out of the game with a concussion.
Vinatieri breaks the all-time record for made field goals (566) with a 42 yarder with 2 seconds left in an otherwise desultory first half. Houston, 21-10.
Two plays later, Watson to Hopkins for the easy touchdown. Houston, 21-7. How bad was Austin Howard that he couldn't make this team's roster?
Watt with the strip sack. Houston ball. Tackles are getting used.
Chester Rogers=Lance Stephenson.
The Colts defense is keeping this thing under control. Gave up one TD drive on a relatively short field. Other Houston TD was a gift from the Indy offense. Plus, they spend the whole game on the field with the offense struggling.
Clowney is hurting people out here. Dominant.
A security guard got hit and had to be carted off. https://t.co/SITgARFz31
Texans take advantage of great field position, five plays, Watson hits Fuller from three yards out and Houston leads, 14-7.
With two reserve offensive tackles, no TY and no Doyle, I have no idea how the Colts are going to move the football.
TY has a chest injury and is questionable to return. https://t.co/vr2Kouubda
Huh? You loved the butt fumble, well, there's the butt snap. Kelly with an awful snap in the shotgun, Houston recovers in the end zone for a gift touchdown. Ridiculous. Seven-all.
That was quick. Luck to Paschal for the touchdown. Big play was 40 yard catch and run by TY. Colts, 7-zip but TY went off the field to get checked after he injured himself on the big play.
Nice meeting you, Drew.
Le'Raven Clark will start at left tackle and Denzelle Good will start at right tackle.
Inactives for the Colts: Mack, Quincy Wilson, Castonzo, Doyle, Stewart, Ridgeway and Tarell Basham is a healthy scratch once again.

RT @KBowen1070: Andrew Luck finished today with a career-low 4.1 yards per attempt.
Brissett is in for the Hail Mary. Incomplete. What a terrible loss.
I have no idea what the Colts are doing here. None.
Colts are dinking and dunking, may score on this drive sometime Wednesday. What the heck? Throw it up and hope for a PI.
Colts penalized for holding on the punt, so now the Colts have to go 89 yards in 43 seconds, no timeouts.
On the previous play, a pass to Hilton, TY's shoe came off during his route. Figures.
On fourth and three at the four, Luck gets sacked. Couldn't maintain his balance. Philly ball with 1:13 left.
This is the kind of situation where Luck made his name early in his pre-injury career. Has Indy down to the Eagles 11-yard line with first-and-10 and 1:35 left.
You must have heard Ballard from your couch. I don't get it, either. https://t.co/JwYtgD9ajE
So it was a 17 play drive, 75 yards, 11:18, four defensive penalties. Eagles go ahead 20-16. Now it's up to Luck to do something he hasn't been able to do all game. There's 3:02 remaining. They lose this game, they'll kick themselves all the way home to Indy.
After the longest, weirdest, most frustrating and penalty-laden drive in forever, the Eagles go ahead on a Smallwood 4-yard TD. Colts had them in third and fourth and forever and penalties doomed them.
I'm deathly afraid that GM Chris Ballard's head is gonna explode. He's in the press box and he's a little bit worked up. The Eagles have been on this drive since last Thursday. Or Wednesday.
Defensive penalties. Defensive penalties. Defensive penalties.
Luck has thrown for 80 yards. And the Colts are leading. Leonard with his second sack, doing Leonard things. This defense is about a thousand times better than I ever expected.
RT @ColtsConti: With that field goal, @adamvinatieri has tied Morten Andersen for the most field goals made in @NFL history with 565
Colts have now had two opportunities to get TD's after forcing turnovers and end up with two field goals. If they lose this thing, that's going to haunt them. Vinatieri with the chip shot and Colts lead 16-13. Vinny FG ties the all-time FG made record.
Andrew Luck's receivers are not really doing much to help the quarterback, especially on throws to the endzone.
Great play by Margus Hunt, who strip sacks Wentz and then recovers the fumble. Colts ball at the Philly 13.
Philly has outgained Indy 311-129, time of possession 27:28 to 14:42  But...13-all. Which is what matters.
Bend but don't break...Eagles engineer a long 13-play, 75-yard drive but have to settle for a field goal. Tied at 13 with 2:50 to go in the third.
Haeg has an ankle injury and he's been ruled out for the game.
Vinatieri needs one more field goal to tie the all-time record. Has made two so far today.
Colts take the lead after the Walker interception, Vinatieri with 31 yard field goal and the Colts lead, 13-10 with 8:23 left in the third quarter.
The play would have been called back because of a hold, but Rogers has got to catch that ball, too.
Intercepted by Walker and the Colts are in business at the Philly 16.
Yeah, just saw the replay in the press box. Tough catch but he should have had it. https://t.co/EbiIvnUmRG
Vinatieri kicks a 35 yard field goal and the game is tied at 10. Thought Luck could have run for the first down on that third and four. But it's easy from up here. Rogers was open, so...
Playing to win. What do the Colts have to lose?
Onions. Reich goes for it on fourth and 2 at the philly 28, and they convert it.
The Colts have got to feel incredibly fortunate to be in this game, trailing just 10-7 at half.
Why not run the ball on third and forever and force Philly to use a timeout?
Philly has out-gained Indy 212-63 (just 24 yards passing for the Colts) but they trail just 10-7.
RT @ColtsConti: Andrew Luck matched his career-long rush (33 yards), which he originally set against Houston on Dec. 11, 2016.
Elliott makes a chip shot to put Philly ahead 10-7, but good job by the Colts defense in the red zone. Still, too many coverage busts. Got to clean that up.
Luck hits Grant from 5 yards for the Colts' touchdown. Thought the Colts caught a break earlier in the drive with a very questionable PI call on a deep throw to Hilton. Game tied, 7-all.
Elliott misses the 55 yard field goal attempt and the Colts still trail just 7-0. Tough kick in the rain. Colts have good field position.
Colts with a coverage bust on Wentz TD pass to finish off long, game-opening drive. Eagles didn't waste any time getting Wentz going, having him throw early and often. 7-zip, Eagles. And they made it look easy

A defensive masterpiece. Indy 21, Washington 9. Best defensive effort since a 34-6 victory at Minnesota in December of 2016.
I am hard pressed to remember a better defensive effort by the Colts in recent years. Dominating.
Darius Leonard is everywhere. Strips the ball from Jordan Reed as the Skins were driving and it's Indy ball with 5:00 left.
Quincy Wilson has a concussion, will not return.
Luck to Hilton for the 2-yard touchdown. Terrific drive after the five previous drives had netted just 18 yards. Colts, 21-9 with 7:32 left in the game. 13 plays, 75 yards, 5:56 on that drive. Huge.
For the second straight week, we're not seeing much of Eric Ebron. Strange.
Darius Leonard is having a Pro Bowl type game. But he's been special since Day One of camp. No surprise.
The Indy offense managed five yards of offense in the third quarter. Five.
Again, Colts make plays deep in their own territory, sack by Leonard, etc. Hopkins kicks a 49 yarder and it's Indy, 14-9.
That's four straight three and outs by the Colts offense.
Good job by the Colts defense, limiting Washington to a short field goal after the Luck interception. Indy still up 14-6 but this offense needs to find itself in the second half. Luck's gotta be better.
Peterson and Thompson combined for 294 all purpose yards last week vs. Arizona. Getting stuffed today.
That would qualify as a bonehead throw by Luck. Intercepted by Swearinger. Hilton was double covered. Washington ball at the Colts 29.
The Colts defensive front is absolutely dominating this game so far.
I'd say that qualifies as a trend. https://t.co/1B4DjyW72g
Big miss by Hopkins on the 49 yard field goal attempt. Looked like the Colts might give up some cheap points late in the half, but Hopkins misses. Colts will go into halftime, with a 14-3 lead. Very impressive half, especially defensively.
You have a point. https://t.co/jejbCVIrij
After review, it's ruled down by contact, so @calabro13sports owes me a beer.
Wilkins has an ankle injury and is questionable and Ridgeway is out.
Crowder fumbles, Hooker recovers, but it's being reviewed. Looked like he was down by contact, but it's gonna be a close call.
Terrific run by Hines, eight yards for the Colts' touchdown. Another fine drive. Keeping Wash off balance with running game and short passes. Colts, 14-3. 8 plays, 75 yards, 4:41.
TY Hilton is having himself a heck of a first half. Just drew a pass interference call.
Hassan Ridgeway questionable with a calf injury. Colts already thin on the interior with Autry out.
Hopkins good from 49 yards and Washington is on the board. Colts lead, 7-3. Great work by the Colts defensive line, getting lots of pressure.
Great series for Sheard.
Big injury loss for Washington. Scherff, their center, is currently out of the game with an injury.
Surprising number of empty seats here in Washington.
At the very least, the Colts flipped the field after starting out deep in their own territory. Washington takes over at the 42.
Luck pass batted into the air by Mason Foster at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by Swearinger.
Great block by Ryan Grant to spring Hilton for 22 yards catch and run on third and 12 at the 3. Huge play.
Should be Denver, not Washington. https://t.co/idGtLzztZc
Colts are absolutely flying around defensively. Big hit by Geathers, then a solid tackle by Kenny Moore II. Washington will punt. Still 7-0.
Pierre Desir, who did not take a defensive snap last week, is starting at corner.
Washington was last in the league against the run last season, but they were besieged by injuries all season. Felt they'd be much better with so many guys returning. Not so much. So far.
Beautiful opening drive by the Colts. Ran the ball well, converted several third downs, then Luck to Ebron from 7 yards out. for the TD. Perfect start.  Colts, 7-0..
Shocked at Purdue's lousy start, three losses by eight points, lot of it self inflicted. IU looks solid, but we'll know more after they play Michigan State Saturday. https://t.co/tkx42dUSLx
Hassan Ridgeway, who had such a productive preseason, will start for Autry at defensive tackle
Le'Raven Clark will start at left tackle and Joe Haeg at right tackle. Gulp.
Colts inactives are Chris Milton, Lenzy Pipkins, Christine Michael, Tarell Basham, Denzelle Good, Anthony Castonzo and Denico Autry. Marlon Mack is active. Basham is a healthy scratch, which tells you all you need to know.

RT @AWalkerColts: #Colts head coach Frank Reich says CB Chris Milton (concussion) is the only injury to report today.
Doyle makes the first down catch on the Colts drive, but fumbles, recovered by Cincy and returned for a touchdown. Twenty four seconds left. Ball game. Bengals up 34-23.
Bullock kicks a 39 yard field goal for Cincinnati and the Bengals lead 27-23 with 3:57 left in the game.
Aided by three Colts defensive penalties, the Bengals take the lead on a Mixon drive from the 1-yard line. Bengals up, 24-23. Colts led by 13 not so long ago.
Margus Hunt out here, making us forget about John Simon for the time being.
Can't blame Reich for trying the field goal from 55. Vinatieri has shown he's got that kind of distance. Trying to make it a two-score lead.
Vinatieri's 54 yard FG try is no good. Bengals ball with 12 seconds left in the quarter. Colts lead 23-17.
Dalton hits AJ Green for a beautiful 38 yard touchdown and it's Colts leading, 23-17, with 4:09 left in the third.
Reich is having a hell of a game calling plays, lots of quick hitters in the passing game, creative, going uptempo.
This is about the point when the Colts starting falling apart last year, leading in the second half. Reich has emphasized finishing, so we'll see...
Luck to Hilton on the short slant for the Colts' touchdown. Another efficient drive, lots of quick passes, death by a thousand paper cuts. Luck's got to love this offense.
Credit to the Colts offensive line; they've held up reasonably well against a very good Bengals' front.
Chester Rogers needs to know that it's OK to fair catch the punt. That's twice he's fielded punts with a guy in his face.
Two spectacular defensive plays by Margus Hunt, first on a run and then sacks Dalton.
After the interception, Luck settled in, finished the half 20-of-25 for 170 yards, one TD and one INT.
Vinatieri with a 52 yard field goal with 6 seconds left in the first half to give the Colts a 16-10 lead.
Bengals respond. Big run by Mixon, a pass interference on Quincy Wilson, 5 plays 75 yards for the touchdown on a Dalton pass to Ross. Colts lead, 13-10.
Another efficient drive by the Colts. Vinatieri finishes it off with a 38 yarder. Colts up, 13-3.
So this is the offense Reich has kept under wraps. We're seeing RPO's, quick throws, great offense.
Coming into the game, I felt like Ebron would be a problem for Cincinnati, and there he was, catching a 26 yard TD pass from Luck. Colts with another good drive, lead 10-3.
AJ Green makes the catch,  but Farley strips it and Leonard recovers. All Farley does is make plays. Colts ball, game tied at 3.
Reich smartly changes his mind and sends out Vinatieri for the chip shot.
Take the points, Frank. But he's not. Going for it on fourth down.
Bengals safety Shawn Williams ejected from the game after a vicious helmet-first hit on Luck after a first-down scramble. Right call. Dangerous play.
Bengals drive 69 yards and finish the drive off with a Bullock field goal. Bengals, 3-0. Get used to the bend-and-don't-break stuff from this Indy defense.
...And the Colts give it right back. Luck intercepted on a pass intended for Doyle. Officially, our first bonehead play of the year.
Moore easily intercepts a Dalton overthrow and the Colts are set up at the Cincy 7 yard line.
Rookie Jordan Wilkins will start at running back for the Colts. Haeg at left tackle, Webb at right tackle.
No Marlon Mack, no Anthony Castonzo today. Gulp...
The Luck snowboarding injury does not appear to have impacted his protracted rehab, but snowboarding with a hurt shoulder was foolish, at the very least. Interested to see if Luck’s old contract prohibited that kind of thing. He’s lucky he’s the franchise qb and not a depth guy.

At what point do we focus just a bit on Serena, who completely lost her cool? Should the ump have been less sensitive? Maybe. But like NBA players who are being officiated by refs who are quick to call a technical, you adjust. Serena is the best, but this was a bad moment.

While I’m thinking about it, the penalty for excessive celebration was atrocious.
Still trying to figure out why Brohm went for the PAT instead of the 2-point conversion, even after the Boilers were pushed back because of a penalty. One point does nothing for you there.
Purdue is good enough to be a bowl team, but it’s not smart enough to be a bowl team. Devastating loss to Eastern Michigan.

Great stat, but I think you need to get out more, Chap. https://t.co/vThPd7jrtP
My sense is the Colts didn’t think Simon was a fit at defensive end in this scheme and was ill suited to the outside LB spot in the 4-3 because it requires an LB to play in space. All I know is if you preach competition, you need to reward the guys who produce. Odd move.
This likely means Ross Travis makes the team.colts have been high on him from the start. https://t.co/IQZNHQZgmw
Simon is not a perfect fit at defensive end, but you can’t tell me he isn’t one of this team’s best defensive players, wherever he plays. This team can’t afford to dump players like John Simon.
A few weeks ago, I wrote if Simon isn’t a big part of the Indy defense, something is amiss. Well...he’s been cut. Something is, in fact, amiss. And it sends a bad message to the rest of the locker room. All Simon did was produce. Total pro who changed positions without complaint.

I have no issue with the Colts not trading for Mack. I hope they inquired, but two first rounders are too much when you figure Indy will be drafting pretty high the next year or two, at least. Plus he would cost too much for a team that’s a ways from contention.
Chris Ballard’s biggest challenge today will be knowing when to stop cutting. Just not a good roster.

Final: Northwestern 31, Purdue 27.
One of the silliest plays I've ever seen: Purdue had Northwestern stopped on third down, but Lorenzo Neal gets nailed for a personal foul for throwing the runner down after the whistle. Terrible play. Now there's just 2:06 left, Northwestern had the ball at the P19 and 2:06 left.
Purdue field goal pulls the boilers within 31-27 early in the fourth. Purdue has 150 yards more offense than Northwestern but those three interceptions hurt them badly.
Purdue defense has found its footing and has forced Northwestern to punt on three straight possessiions.
I thought Rondale went to Trinity, Romeo New Albany. What am i missing? https://t.co/PkIm8QPF05
Honest to goodness, do we have to review every single play?
D.J. Knox starts off the first Purdue drive of the second half with a 45-yard run, then he finishes it off from 2 yards out. Northwestern leads, 31-24. In a related story, I'm thrilled I'm no longer on deadline these days. First half took about 2 hours.
David Blough starts the second half for Purdue
For the record, the all-time single-game record for all purpose yards is 578. Emmett White of Utah State. in 2000 Remember that game like it was yesterday.
The all-time Purdue single-game record for all-purpose yards is 312, set by the great Otis Armstrong. So Moore is 10 yards shy of the school record by just 10 yards, and we still have a half to play.
Purdue's Rondale Moore had 302 all-purpose yards in the first half in his college debut. That's the third highest total in Purdue history. Yeah, he's good.
At half, Northwestern leads, 31-17.
Well...Blough in for Sindelar with 37 seconds left in the half. Can't blame Brohm. Sindelar made terrible decisions.
Larkin runs it in from four yards for Northwestern, taking advantage of Sindelar's third first-half interception. Wonder if Brohm might turn to Blough eventually.
Sindelar throws his third interception of the first half. Two of them were terrible throws under pressure. Gotta be better than that
Spencer Evans with the 38 yard field goal for Purdue, and it's Northwestern, 24-17.
Green with the quarterback sneak for the score and Northwestern leads 24-14.
Looked like the receiver, Skowronek, pushed off on the 40-yard pass, but no call and Northwestern is set up at the Purdue 15.
Northwestern answers with a field goal. On the TV broadcast, they're saying both NU quarterbacks are on a pitch count of sorts, which explains why they replaced Thorson with Green after two terrific TD drives.
Did I mention that Rondale Moore is gonna be special? I was wrong. He's special now. Goes 76 yards for the Purdue touchdown. Incredible vision and speed. A star is born.
I'll be interested to learn why Northwestern turned to the backup quarterback, TJ Green, after Thorson led two picture-perfect drives that resulted in touchdowns.
Purdue' freshman Rondale Moore can play. Starts the drive with a nice kick return, ends it with a 32-yard catch for the touchdown. Now they've got to stop Northwestern. Like, once. Northwestern, 14-7.
Sometimes you forget, Northwestern has won 10 games each of the last two years. Pretty apparent why. Cats drive quickly and efficiently, 5 plays, 65 yards in 1:04 to take the lead 14-0.
The Boilers have lost seven of their 11 starters on defense and 9 of their 12 top tacklers from last year.
Tough start for a Purdue defense that is very inexperienced. Northwestern goes 11 plays and scores a touchdown. Lots of broken tackles. Cats, 7-0
Terrible throw off the back foot by Sindelar, easily intercepted by Northwestern on the game's first drive.
No cheering in the press box. https://t.co/HhZushpqez

Forgot to mention, newcomer Ryan Delaire is making a huge impact in just two weeks. Making play after play.
Colts George Odum makes the interception, and this game is done. Colts, 23, SF 17. Not a bad performance. Not great running or stopping the run, lots of questions still, but generally solid all around.
Badgely with another field goal, Colts lead 23-17 with 1 minute left. Niners are out of timeouts.
I'm not sure how you evaluate the Colts running backs today. Not a lot of room to run, and yes, this is a recording.
Niners with a long drive, score the touchdown and make the 2-point conversion. Colts lead 20-17 with 4:07 left.
Tweeted it yesterday, but not writing a column. Written about this subject three times this week; that's enough. https://t.co/AWrXzw8GeN
Badgely with a 51-yard field goal, Colts extend lead to 20-9. Good way to get a job somewhere else in the league.
Bad news: Denzelle Good is gone for the game with a knee injury. Just what the Colts need at a position where they have no clear starter and minimal depth.  Don't know how long he'll be out'; should know after the game.
Niners fumble deep in their own territory, then Badgely knocks through a 25 yard field goal. Colts, 17-9 with 9:03 remaining.
After a perfect 53-yard throw to Seantavius Jones, Christine Michael bulls his way into the end zone for the score. Colts, lead 14-9.
Gould kicks a 32 yard field goal and Niners lead 9-7. SF has moved the ball pretty easily today, but penalties keep bogging them down in the red zone.
The good news is, Darius Leonard is always around the ball. The bad news is, he has a difficult time catching the darned thing. Nearly had two INT's so far this game.
Another long Niners drive, but the Colts stiffen in the red zone. Gould kicks a 27 yarder and it's 7-6 Colts.
Colts dormant offense finally finds a rhythm, Luck finds Ebron in the endzone for a touchdown, 15 yards. Colts, 7-3.
Niners run the ball down the Colts throats but the drive stalls due to SF penalties. Then Gould kicks a 37 yard field goal. SF, 3-0. early second quarter.
It should be noted that Alfred Morris, who is running over the Colts presently, was available to the Colts and everybody else just a few weeks ago. Think Indy could have used him.
Jordan Wilkins starting at running back. Reich has seen what we've all seen. He's been the best of the Colts healthy backs.
I know Frank Reich wants to play it really close to the vest in terms of not showing his hand, but I'd like to see the Colts get some reps tonight with the no-huddle and some RPO's.

WISH is reporting it has fired former-driver-turned-analyst Derek Daly from their station after learning that Daly told the original story, a story that included a racial slur, that bob Lamey retold. This corroborates the reporting of WTHR, which leaned about Daly from our source

Ravens take advantage of Hines' fumble, Jackson to Moore for the touchdown. Baltimore leads 17-10.
Nyheim Hines is playing his way down the depth chart. Fumbles the kickoff to start the second half. Ravens recover. Not good.
Hassan Ridgeway has been very productive the first two games of the preseason. Another sack on Lamar Jackson.
Quincy Wilson might just be one of those guys who doesn't perform all that well in practice, but shows up on a game days. Might be...
Jordan Wilkins has a terrific drive, but fumbles inside the Baltimore 5-yard line, only to see Chester Rogers recover in the endzone for a touchdown.
OK, I've seen enough of Luck for one day. Not a very good performance. Held on to the ball too long a number of times.  Best to sit him and try again Saturday vs. the Niners.
Reich sending Luck back out there with 9:38 left in the second quarter. I'd be a little leery of taking too many chances with this Balt defense and the presence of two young offensive tackles.
Luck gets hit hard from the blind side by Terrell Suggs for the sack, but he pops right back up.
Ravens take the lead, Flacco to John Brown for the touchdown in the back of the end zone.
@james_mcglone Excuse me, Denico Autry.
Colts drive stalls, but Vinatieri nails a 57 yard field goal. I'd just tell him to spend the next two weeks in the Bahamas and check back for the regular season opener.
All John Simon does is make plays. If he's not the starting defensive end, something is very wrong.
That's a bad call on Darius Leonard. Let with his shoulder, not his helmet, in my humble opinion. The officials are still trying to figure this whole thing out. As are the players.
Luck intercepted in the red zone. Intended for Doyle but tipped and caught. Shaky start for the Colts' offense.
Baltimore fumbles punt return and Colts recover, take over at the at the Balt 14. Geathers with the strip.
On a team that generally lacks depth, the Colts are set at safety. Farley is an excellent backup, made a great play to break up a bomb on Baltimore's first drive.
Stuff I want to see in tonight's Colts game: 1) Somebody who can play right tackle. 2) One of the young running backs to step up. 3) Ditto with the WR's; TY is not playing tonight, so lots of opportunity. Oh, and Luck, of course.

Colts win, 19-17. But the result isn’t important. Luck’s return, that’s important.
Nice third-down run by Jordan Wilkins on a play that looked like it was going nowhere. The rookie has been impressive in camp.
Why do I feel like Chuck would have left him in the game last year? Reich ain't playing, even in a preseason game. https://t.co/l3p3l2z525
Joe Haeg is back in at center for this possession.
Well, that's not a possession center Mark Glowinski will want to watch on tape Friday. Two fumbled snaps under center, then a shotgun snap goes awry, the Seahawks recover in the end zone and it's Colts, 19-17, with 3:15 left.
I'll take "TV in the 70's'' for $200, Alex. https://t.co/VqAe1ipYop
Colts' safety Shamarko Thomas gets disqualified after a dangerous, head-first hit on a Seahawks receiver. That one was blatantly obvious and it was called correctly. Don't know if this is going to cut down on those kinds of hits and the resulting concussions, but it's a start.
@jakequery @Chris_Widlic MaryAnn or Ginger? Hey, it's the fourth quarter of a preseason game.
Colts DL Hassan Ridgeway is showing up tonight. Nyheim Hines in the return game...not so much.
Walker hits Darrell Daniels for a 10-yard TD, another nice drive, and the Colts lead 19-10 with 10:42 left in the game.
Seahawks and Colts trade field goals and the Colts lead 12-10. Nice drive led by quarterback Phillip Walker.
@iamkickz007 Do not know.
Right tackle Austin Howard still in there for the Colts deep into the third quarter.

It's still newsworthy, in my view. Couple of Dolphins knelt before their game. Let's be honest: Our country is hopelessly polarized as it is. Noting that no Colts knelt isn't going to change that. https://t.co/MuGtKvZwVu
Vinatieri is good from 45 yards and the Colts move ahead, 9-7.
Think it's painfully apparent the Colts desperately need a healthy Anthony Castonzo back at left tackle. His replacements, Haeg and Webb, both have been beaten for sacks.
Some how, some way, John Simon is going to make a nice impact for this Indy defense. Nice series, walks away with a sack and a half.
And yet you follow me. Check that: You used to follow me. https://t.co/9gOLrO9kuF
Jacoby Brissett is warming up and looks like he'll be coming into the game. Luck, the Colts and Colts fans have to be ecstatic. Luck was 6 of 9 for 64 yards. Led two scoring drives. Now we'll have to see how he feels tomorrow and the next few days.
Hairston intercepts backup QB Austin Davis in the endzone and kills a Seattle drive. Nice play.
Nice to see Luck stepping up in the pocket and making throws. Except for the one hiccup, a sack given up by Haeg, the O-line has done a nice job.
Vinatieri is Vinatieri, kicks a 51-yard field goal to bring the Colts within 7-6. Another solid drive. That might be it for Luck. We'll see.
Mack is out for the game.
Mack with a hamstring injury.
Marlon Mack limped off the field. Being checked on the sidelines.
Get used to this: Seahawks go ahead after a long drive, 12 plays, 75 yards. Colts had them third and 16 earlier and gave up a 15 yard pass. Went for it on fourth and converted.
Excuse me, 12-play drive for 60 yards. Hey, it's preseason for me too.
Luck was 5 of 7 for 55 yards on that first drive.
A sight for sore eyes: Luck makes all the basic throws and Vinatieri kicks the field goal after an 11 play scoring drive. Luck took a hit and bounced right back up. Promising start.
Chester Rogers HAS to get that first down, but the Colts convert on fourth down. Luck very sharp.
For the record, I did not notice any Colts players taking a knee or raising a fist to the air during the national anthem. And there's your weekly anthem update.

To reiterate, the Pacers will not pick up Lance Stephenson’s team option, but the door is not closed. Depending on how they fare in free agency with $20 mill in cap space, they can still re-sign him July 5. Column/blog on the way. Eventually.

Indiana All Stars win easily 109-81. Not sure how this group lost to Kentucky down at Bellarmine, but they did. Romeo wins the game's MVP. As you would expect.
Today's crowd is 8,266, a significant improvement over the last few years. Back in 2008, the crowd was a paltry 5,071. This might be a Romeo-inspired one off, but it suggests the Indiana-Kentucky All-Star series still matters. Especially here.
Warren Central's electric Dean Tate hits a corner 3 and the Indiana All Stars are rolling, 34-17. Langford with 13 points.
Most impressive player I've seen so far is Ben Davis' Aaron Henry, who is going to Michigan State. Big, strong, athletic. Oh, and Romeo has 9 points, playing much better than he did last night at Bellarmine.
Terrific crowd for the Indiana-Kentucky All Star basketball game. Think most of New Albany is here. Romeo sells tickets.

Hinchcliffe reports a major vibration in the car and does not take the green flag. Won the 2016 pole, and now he's in danger of missing the race.
With less than 20 minutes remaining, James Hinchcliffe is not in the race. Waiting in line to get back out there.  Wow.

If the Pacers lose, and it doesn't look very good right now, they'll regret those couple of minutes when LBJ was out of the game and the Cavs extended their lead. The whole series, the supporting cast has been criticized, but today they were good enough, especially Thompson.
That's a killer: James takes a sweet pass from Korver and lays it in. Cavs up 102-96 with 30.2 left.
Pacers pull to within 100-96 with 50.1 left after Oladipo goes in for a largely uncontested layup.
Myles Turner fouls out with 4:33 remaining.
Cavs started the fourth with a 10-2 run to start the third, all while James was on the bench. That's a problem.
Bad sign: the Cavs are playing well with LeBron on the bench, now lead 86-76 with 8:40 left.
Three horrendous possessions in a row, terrible shot selection, and the Cavs extend the lead again with James on the bench, 82-74.
LeBron dealing with leg cramps.
LeBron returns to the court with 11:05 in the fourth.
RT @joevardon: The Cavs' trainer -- Steve Spiro -- and LeBron's persona trainer, Mike Mancias, are back there with him
At the end of three, the Cavs lead 76-74.
LeBron James just went to the locker room. No word on what the issue might be.
Really, for all the whining the Cavs do after every call, they're gonna give Collison a tech for waving off the official?
I'm sure Tyronn Lue is following my Twitter feed... https://t.co/ZQ4I9Ep2OF
Bogdanovic knocks down a 3 in transition and the Pacers take a 59-58 lead with 7:12 left in the third. Have outscored Cleveland 16-4 in this quarter. Great Indiana ball pressure on the perimeter.
Not sure why Cleveland doesn't use LeBron in the post every single time down the floor. Love vs. Young isn't working for them. LeBron playing bully ball does work.
Pacers are having another effective third quarter and are on a 9-0 run to pull within 56-52 with 9:11 left.
That's about as poorly as the Pacers can play and as well as the Cavs can play. Just one TO for Cleveland. LeBron with 26 points. Zilch for Bogey and Turner hasn't even had a shot attempt.
Cavaliers have 11 second chance points, seven offensive rebounds. Thompson is giving Turner the business. Can't happen. Cavs lead 54-43 at halftime.
At the very least, McMillan needs to get more size and strength on James, like Thad Young. Cuz this isn't working. Obviously. Cavs 49-37.
James taking over again, just posting up Lance and pushing him under the basket. Pacers have to double and get the ball out of his hands. If the other guys make threes, they make threes.
We'll see how long Ty Lue stays with his bench (and LeBron). Getting beaten up the way they've been getting beaten up all series by Indiana bench.
Pacers on a 12-2 run and pull within 37-33, but you kind of knew they would. Been that way all year.
If the Pacers can't get out in transition off Cleveland turnovers, they're going to struggle. This looks like a Cavs team that's been to three straight NBA Finals. The Pacers...not so much. But it's early. really early.
That was a regrettable first quarter. Oladipo, Bogey and Turner all scoreless. LBJ with 13 points already. No turnovers by the Cavs. Cavs lead 31-19 after the first quarter.
Cavs have no turnovers so far and have come out far more physically than the Pacers.
Thompson already has six rebounds. Making an impact.
Agreed. https://t.co/RL158P6NG8

Actually, it's the biggest postseason margin of victory in the Pacers NBA and ABA history.
This is the biggest margin of victory in the Pacers NBA postseason history. Thirty-four points. A bludgeoning.
If McMillan left Oladipo in to get a triple double, and he has one, that's ridiculous. This isn't about stats. It's about avoiding injury and resting for Game 7. Silly.
Why in heaven's name is Oladipo back in the game with a huge lead and 6:30 remaining.
I would tend to doubt that we'll see LeBron again tonight. The Cavs are tapping out. Pacers up 29 with 9:51 left.
It's Game 1 all over again. The Pacers are dominating, lead 92-67 after three quarters.
Oh!ladipo with the slam over LeBron. Pacers up 21.
Turner and Bogdanovic with three-pointers and the Pacers surge ahead 74-54 with 5:50 left in the third.
The beauty of Twitter is, you can stop following me. Here, let me help you... https://t.co/zuQoPefyxO
Very solid first half from the Pacers. Only five TO's. Oladipo and Collison have combined for 27 points. Indiana leads, 57-47.
After watching the replay, James basically ran into Young's elbow. Right non call.
Ruled incidental contact. No foul. Ok, then.
LBJ with a towel over his left eye after apparently taking a shot to the face by Thaddeus Young. Bleeding. Officials going to the replay.
After one, it's Pacers 29, Cavs 26. Couple of defensive breakdowns by Indiana, but they've gotten lots of production from their backcourt.
Oladipo already has 15 points, 5 rebounds and 2 steals. Collison much more aggressive. Pacers up 29-24.
