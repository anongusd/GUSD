@100ydzero @yigsstarhouse Yig. I agree that MSM has not answered this question.
@100ydzero @yigsstarhouse I am still curious why an official White House document is an obvious and proven fraud. This theory of a conspiracy, is still a theory, with the evidence in existence of a fraudulent document. Why issue a fraudulent document? What motivates that? That's the next question IMO.
@100ydzero @yigsstarhouse "Mr Trump never adequately explained why he's had an apparent change of views after raising questions about Mr Obama's birthplace as recently as earlier this year. Those questions aren't going away."	Quote from your linked source, 5.56.	Article says Trump "put it behind him"
@100ydzero @yigsstarhouse The question is posted above. Focus please.
@100ydzero @yigsstarhouse This document, from 1961, references a country of origin for the father, said country did not exist in 1961.	Thus, this document is a self exposing fraud. 	Question: why was an obviously fraudulent document released by Obama Whitehouse?	Just a question.

Q already gave us enough hints, and we have done enough research to KNOW about these criminals infiltrated into government, media and corporatocracy. We the people bring accusation against criminals. We petition our government for Redress.
@realDonaldTrump	For national security, it is your duty to publish for public knowledge what our Civil servants have done under our supervision. We the people are the hmfic. Some of them are lieing to us. Tell us who. Prove it. Publish it in undeniably truth settling terms.
I want to see the fisa applications. Redactions be damned. People are starting to kill each other in this country of ours, because they BELIEVE the other side is cheating.	Un damned acceptable. This isn't a drunken poker game. All cards to the top of the table. No redactions.
So, (under oath) one of the following:	He lied about the difference. Or;	He is putting his understanding of what the public knows about the fisa application, as erroneous public knowledge  or;	RR misunderstands what the public knows. Or;	The application changed.	Opinions, please
FBI and DOJ are playing a game! DOJ Rosenstein says the fisa application sworn statements (affiant) are FBI agents. He reviewed. He signed. A team of DOJ lawyers reviewed. Then he says that the Carter Page fisa, as the public knows it, is different from the renewal he reviewed ?
Wait. What if? 	What if we abolished Ice? 	That would not relieve the President of his duty to defend the border. He would need to immediately replace border security and immigration enforcement personnel with equally tough hombres. While he's at it, reorganize FBI and DOJ.

@Thomas1774Paine J Edgar Hoover tactic. James (Whitey) Bulger is another example. 	The book teaches that wickedness increases when punishment is delayed.	Real life examples like Bulger and Epstein prove that true in our lifetime.	Reforms needed at FBI, and local law enforcement, with CI policy.
