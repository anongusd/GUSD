@AdrianCJax @SamClay31111035 This isn‚Äôt really relevant but is there any emoji more annoying than that condescending shrugged-shoulders one (ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)? It like a full-torso smirk just inviting a block.

@ABCPolitics Glad they hired a PR firm to get their story straight!
@ABCPolitics https://t.co/6q0Rd4WXgl
@RepThomasMassie Yeah total respect https://t.co/HcPmQFrZyk
@KATUNews Clearly such respect to their elders https://t.co/vmkd4z5yzs
@KATUNews Doesn‚Äôt mean 50 little jerks weren‚Äôt surrounding and heckling the veteran.
@cjzero Hormones amirite
@MySportsUpdate @DoremusJ Yeah but other video has turned up since then that really calls the original narrative into question.
@davidwebbshow @AOC David knows what marginal tax rates are, he‚Äôs just lying to the rubes to protect the nation‚Äôs wealthiest.
@JamesMartinSJ I mean really, the boy had absolutely no options except to stand there and smirk. The PR firm his parents hired are the only ones to believe here.
@nytimes He‚Äôs totally guilty of... approaching the group!
@nytimes The video shows he looks like a Native American and that‚Äôs all the proof the Magats need!
@davydawg @DanielMyers76 @tfinley266 @nytimes He surrounded those 50 kids!
@nytimes And then the man with the drum surrounded the 50 kids and made them jeer at him!
@lukeoneil47 Actually there‚Äôs another video that shows the chicken is fully cooked, so...
@Scot_Blog But Imma stop now, because you probably actually have serious stuff to do, and maybe I shouldn‚Äôt waste your time. Later!
@Scot_Blog But hey, I think they should be expelled, you don‚Äôt. There you have it.
@Scot_Blog Are you talking about that pass interference non-call?
@Scot_Blog Come to think of it, you‚Äôre way the hell off in your original notion that these kids should get cut a break, or not be defined by this, or that many of us might have done similar things. So you‚Äôre NOT a racist, you just had a garbage take: It‚Äôs really the Internet‚Äôs fault!
@JordanUhl Pompous asses should stop acting like pompous asses.
@MAGABOT1776 @bandlersbanter Pantywaist? What is this 1958?
@Scot_Blog @normltn Ok, I didn‚Äôt look you up and glad you‚Äôre doing what you do. But jeez, settle down, no need to go after an anon twitter troll with 40 followers. (And as you know there‚Äôs plenty of hypocrisy out there on this.) and no need to pot-shame either. Sheesh chill the f out.
@johncardillo Dudes, the school and diocese have already apologized. Are they in on the scam also? #MagaFools
@Scot_Blog Ok now do the same thing for minority kids caught with weed
@buckeyes1980 @tomwatson @kurteichenwald You had a point?
@CyrusMMcQueen Cool, as long as you washed your hands first.
@gogamecocks Hint: she called herself ‚Äúgritty‚Äù.
@JesseKellyDC To all those saying Jesse is just joking... that‚Äôs exactly the modus of professional (and schoolyard) bullies: Always have a get-out-of-jail-free card of ‚Äúit was just a joke!‚Äù Then they get to bully, deny bullying, plus the bullied are portrayed as humorless on top of it. So, no.
@rev_entertain @I_say_Toad @PositivePyrami1 @RealJohnCain @ConservaCatGal @JesseKellyDC Yeah, no, not really that funny, try again.
@SteveDaines @JoelKrautter @realDonaldTrump Funny thing is that when Trmp is finally gone, Steve will pretend he was the one holding him in check. Try to lie a little less in blind service to your master.
@buckeyes1980 @tomwatson @kurteichenwald If a minority did that to you, Gary, you‚Äôd cry for the cops.
@larryhouse @ABCPolitics Hey Larry why don‚Äôt who weigh in with the school and diocese, which have already apologized? Great ‚Äúeconomics‚Äù thinking there bro.
@PraisingJesus2 @ABCPolitics Unable to think of anything coherent to say, Jimmy Freeman weighs in with a Trmp video about immigration in order to .... condemn a Native American veteran?  Cluelessness level 11.
@wellingtonmiley @ABCPolitics Hey Miley, school and diocese already apologizing. Better let them know of your top-notch detective work so they can quickly recant their apologies before it‚Äôs too late!
@AndrewGillum I‚Äôm sure Fox will dig up an old jaywalking tickets for Mr. Phillips, and failing that will just invent something to make it seems like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs no angel‚Äù

@francie_berens @thrillout @soledadobrien @jamesjgutierrez On the bright side it would open places in college for non-jerks.

@francie_berens @soledadobrien @jamesjgutierrez How about the adults get fired then?
@jamesjgutierrez @soledadobrien Oh man
@jennalockard1 @maxwelltani And yet, the school and the diocese are already apologizing. You‚Äôd best contact them with this brilliant insight so they can withdraw the apology and condemn the Native veteran!!!
@adamwright1997 @cc_qso11 @maxwelltani Adam is the real victim here amirite?
@jenwendcincy @kjhealy Just because they teach reading doesn‚Äôt make them liberal
@kjhealy You may be joking, but the sympathetic stories about the hardworking students/teachers/admins/priests sad they are being painted with a broad brush are no doubt being pitched in newsrooms as we speak.
@Chris_Cheetham @MariaLaoise @mariajudy_ @RaheemKassam Sure Jan
@Chris_Cheetham @MariaLaoise @mariajudy_ @RaheemKassam I mean he‚Äôs right there threatening the mob!

@ktumulty I mean won‚Äôt anybody think of THE POOR LITTLE RACIST KIDS
@ktumulty Then they could come back and start every new racist generalization about Native Americans with, ‚ÄúWell, I spent a week on a reservation once, and I think....‚Äù
@ktumulty Maybe the people on the reservations don‚Äôt want these entitled little shits around them?

@ByronTau Also ‚Äúposturing‚Äù?   How awful you are.
@ByronTau Hey Byron, have you run to the defense of, say, black teenagers caught with a bag of weed or nah?
@ByronTau Gee Byron sounds like you have some things to get of your chest.
@TracyJan @tomwatson Don‚Äôt packs of shitty little kids usually  have grownups with them?
@banville Maybe...but always seems to me most newsers bend over backwards to sanitize many awful people, and it‚Äôs never going to be enough. For bigots and people blind to their own privilege, down-the-middle reporting will always seem biased.
@HumanProgress @johanknorberg Ok, so there‚Äôs been economic growth in India and China, which combine for about 1/3 the world‚Äôs population. Math isn‚Äôt really your strong suit, is it.
@jeremynewberger Ok but who gets to pick the music on the new Fox MTV (cue 1980s MTV guitar riff) üé∏üé∏
@Kevin_A_Reilly @johncardillo And also that the ‚Äúmoronic‚Äù premise is probably the right one.
@johncardillo Yes, ‚ÄúThat would have been moronic!‚Äù is pretty much the defense line at this point.
@redsteeze @ddale8 Well, for starters, one is exactly consistent with previously documented acts by the President and his attorney, and the other is built on previously debunked rumors that relied on an irrational bigotry against both Muslims and immigrants. Complex, I know.
@GlennKesslerWP Thinking about it logically isn‚Äôt their thing.

@JMForCalifornia @OurRev305 And humility too I see.
@JMForCalifornia @OurRev305 Bernie-approved talking points... yawn and Not true. Yes she was a prosecutor and put people in jail but that‚Äôs a pretty mainstream position. But keep trying for attention whoever you are

@JMForCalifornia @OurRev305 Thread, not threat, but that almost works too
@JMForCalifornia @OurRev305 So according to this threat, she‚Äôs too SF-Berkeley but also the establishment candidate. And about ID politics, I guess because it‚Äôs her fault she has both Black AND Indian heritage. Too bad she‚Äôs not fucking perf like Bernie, right?
@MikeAhernHumour @AOC @DailyCaller Conservatives POSTED the video, tried to shame her for it. Even you can‚Äôt be as stupid as you‚Äôre pretending to be, but it‚Äôs close.
