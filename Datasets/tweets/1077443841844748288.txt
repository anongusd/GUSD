@realDonaldTrump You couldn't save Roger. FBI worked without pay. Ha ha. So now the government is open &amp; you can have your SOTU so you can spend 90 minutes lying through your teeth. Sad. NO WALL NO WAY.
@mcspocky @sabulosaa His strategy for for trying to protect his friend Roger. Didn't work. FBI did their job without pay. Just my thought. After the arrest the gov. re-opened.
@tweetmommybop Fake news.
@EdKrassen @BrendaGremli Or Cheetos
@Nicoxw1 Nooooooo!
@MamaForChange Not in Chicago. Whew. We got snow &amp; ice &amp; single degrees. Enjoy it.
@Kristin_Hook It seem's like such a coincidence that he opened the gov. after Roger go indicted. No need to keep it closed now, the FBI still got him. Just sayin. The witch Hunt continues.
@aglorios Congratulations &amp; many, many more yrs. to you. Stay happy &amp; stay healty.

@kcullen_21 @giufuliafa 2018 wasn't the worst or best. Bumpy &amp; his family may be out soon with Pence &amp; we may have a President Pelosi soon. 2018 made us work really hard, &amp; that's a good thing.
@realAliTweets Hmmm. Maybe because we learned what not to do &amp; hopefully we will not have Russian have Russian hackers in 2020.

@MariahFrederick @EdKrassen She is an expert at Reagonomics. I read most of her book &amp; was very good. She knows just what to do &amp; not to do. Could be very interesting.
@KARENSTEVER @EdKrassen *want
@KARENSTEVER @EdKrassen Please make that a big if. He has got to be OUT soon. I don't to see dumpy running again because it's too stressful.
@EdKrassen We'll see. I'll go with that. Life get's more fun in 2019.
@funder Oh Lord don't get me started. Ummmm. Trumpy &amp; Pency out &amp; Nancy in at til after 2020. The Trump clan indicted. All of them. &amp; life harder for the REPS.
@leftyjennyc @HillBeverlyhill @DNC Is he running as a Dem.? Sigh. Getting funner.
@waltshaub @LadyRaven3 Ya, i went to bed at 9:00pm filled with champaign, &amp; it was good. Now have to master through Rose Bowl Parade. Yeah!
@mosweden @realDonaldTrump Capitan bone spur is too good for him. What about officer.
@realDonaldTrump You hired the FAKE general's. You hire only the best one's. Your hiring techniques suck. Bad businessman. Should have picked another career like painting porches.
@essenviews Ya. We can see how it goes. I think she can be a long standing contendent. It'll be fun &amp; interesting. Joe may not run so we need people with background. Than she can pick a younger up and coming to run with her because she's very smart.

@bubbagump324 I think she might. We need some good people. She has fire. Let's see where the wind blows us.
@Tennesseine Nope.
@SassyKadiK She could be good. She could put us back in place. Waiting to see what happens.
@GeorgeTakei I say 2016 was one of the worst. One. There were other's. This year was just, well not exciting. 2019 will be better.
