@CliffordAsness @erikbryn For what it’s worth, I’m not sold on Warren’s plan vs. a large increase in inheritance taxes. 		I am sold on the idea that the combination of a huge increase in top-end wealth/incomes and stagnation for the middle class is a serious problem for the US. I can’t tell if you agree.
@CliffordAsness I mean this: There is abundant evidence of stagnation for middle class and poor since the 1970s and especially since 2000. Weak income growth. Weak wealth growth or worse. Flat or falling life expectancy. Unhappiness about country. Etc. What do you think is the right response?

5. The GOP remains with Trump, for now. But it's not guaranteed to remain so. Trump is already weak. Add a government shutdown, a barely loyal staff, Mueller's investigation and the Democrats' newfound subpoena power -- and the next few months are treacherous for him. [fin]
4. Several GOP senators running in 2020 will be doing so in states that just went for the Democrats in the House popular vote, as this chart shows. https://t.co/m85SANzds0 https://t.co/HiRC8kOBLK
3. This is a problem for Senate Republicans, especially those running in 2020. Remember: presidential-year turnout tends to help Democrats. Turnout in 2020 is likely to be at least 10 million votes higher in 2020 than it was in 2018.
2. Let's start with the numbers. At Trump's current approval rating (about 40%), the GOP was trounced in the midterms. It lost the House popular vote by almost 9 percentage points. 		By comparison, no presidential race has been so lopsided since Reagan '84.
1. Trump is in a considerably weaker position than many people realize. If he loses any support from Republicans, his presidency could easily enter the sort of vicious spiral that Bush's did in 2006-8 or, perhaps more relevantly, Nixon's did in 1973-4. https://t.co/m85SANzds0
@Barnes_Law I’m sorry you didn’t like it, Robert. But I hope you’re well. Let’s have this debate in person sometime.
Trump is weaker than is often understood:	- The Republicans lost the popular vote in the midterms by almost 9 percentage points, according to the final count.	- 40% is not a good approval rating	- He's more likely to get weaker than stronger in 2019. https://t.co/m85SANzds0

An impeachment in the next few months likely shores up Republican support for him in Congress. And that support is by no means guaranteed over the rest of 2019. https://t.co/BBlNFBG09S
Remember: Nixon was never impeached. But he was effectively removed. 		The goal today needs to be persuading Republicans that Trump has violated his constitutional oath and is unfit for office. Impeachment, right now, doesn’t do that. 		Investigate Trump. Focus on his corruption.
President Trump is manifestly unfit for office and deserves to be removed, just as Nixon was. 		But Democrats should understand that a rushed impeachment would actually help Trump stay in office. A much better approach for now: Sustained investigations.  https://t.co/xNERmm5PFc

5. Achieving this outcome won't be easy. And it should not involve a Democratic House quickly impeaching him -- which would actually be a favor to Trump. But achieving his removal from office is more plausible than many people seem to realize. 	https://t.co/Oj0Ym6Rs12
4. For the country’s sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.
3. This list instead focuses on demonstrable ways that Trump has broken the law or violated his oath.		ONE: Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.	TWO: He has violated campaign finance law.	THREE: He has obstructed justice.	FOUR: He has subverted democracy.
2. Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors can be separated into four categories. And this list is conservative. It does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with Russia, nor his lazy approach to the job, like his refusal to read briefing books.
1. The unrelenting chaos that President Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office. https://t.co/Oj0Ym6Rs12

It's true that Cornyn's approval ratings are not spectacular. But I think progressives who see him as a weak are wishcasting a bit. Approval rating: +15 (per below). 		And Cornyn's history of statewide margins:	2014: +27	2008: +12	2002: +12	1998: +10	https://t.co/tkQdShGat1 https://t.co/x2GAh8gCVU

True! But it also strikes me as a bad idea. He is likely to lose against Cornyn, a high-ranking, generally popular incumbent. Then O'Rourke's political career is probably over. A loss in the Dem primaries (or a Plan C) would seem to leave him with more options. https://t.co/MMkVW0k496

@DeFeliceJanette @AAUW Thank you for the critique. 		My problem with universal debt cancellation is how many well-off people it serves. It would widen the racial wealth gap, e.g. Targeted debt relief can narrow it. https://t.co/XnTa2KIM2D		I’d much prefer fiscally “irresponsible” anti-poverty policies.
@amandadeibert Yes. There are. The average pay for four-year college grads is about $70k a year. Paying $3k a year in debt service is entirely doable for many of them. 		I’d much prefer that money go to fighting poverty or climate change, making preK universal, etc.
@amandadeibert Thanks for the critique. I guess I’d say: Isn’t nuance in student debt an argument against forgiving all $1.4 trillion — and using that money to better help people who truly need help? There are a lot of people doing just fine who don’t need $25k (or whatever sum) from the govt.
@NickScrimenti Thanks for the feedback. Do you have data on this?

@ryanavent I agree.
@edfischman @SusanWTurnbull But this feels different. Universal debt forgiveness *excludes* many of the needy.
Do the 2018 exit polls deserve to be taken more seriously than the 2016 exit polls did? (That's not a rhetorical question.)		https://t.co/yzMGJBkGBr
@ryanavent Let's just not put the upper middle class at the front of the line.
@wickedzeus75 Not many. But the answer change if you don't take "Ivy" literally. People who graduate from selective colleges make up a meaningful portion of student debtholders. Thus those Urban numbers.
@ryanavent Or we could pay for universal pre-K, better health insurance, a payroll tax cut, free community college or one of many other programs that doesn't disproportionately help the upper middle class!
A much better approach is 1) a big expansion of federal financial aid and 2) debt forgiveness for people who really need it (and not for all the doctors, lawyers and people in tech, finance, media, etc who are paying off their loans and don't need federal help).
... but remember: If you're in favor of universal debt elimination, you're in favor of eliminating the debts of lots of Ivy League grads who really don't need the federal government's help. They're doing just fine. They're making good money and repaying their loans.

@rortybomb I understand that. I worry that journalists, academics, Congressional staffers and think-tankers too often lobby for handouts for the upper-middle-class — Eg themselves — and veil it as progressivism.
@rortybomb Sure. And income-based debt forgiveness can address much of this. But universal debt forgiveness is a huge handout to the upper middle class.
@studentactivism @SallyLHudson You are correct. I don’t think, for example, that kids from upper-middle-class families with some college debt who are temporarily working in modest-paying early-career jobs should have their debt erased.
@SallyLHudson @studentactivism That may well be right. I’m in favor of a huge increase in financial aid for low- and middle-income students. I’m not in favor of universal debt forgiveness, because it’s regressive. 		Other universal programs — like preschool — are not regressive, whatever one thinks of them.

@MarcGoldwein And they’re often not paid.

@MarcGoldwein That’s true. And also true of tobacco taxes. Cars are not really the right analogy.
@jmp_nyc That'd be fine too. But the problem isn't just one artificial sweetener.

And clearly this risk has occurred to Obama. As president, he became well aware of how he could polarize a debate and hurt his cause by taking a high-profile stand. Which makes it fascinating that he now thinks the benefits of speaking outweigh the costs. https://t.co/MdLOJ1Maav

@gelliottmorris @LiberalVirginia @mlow29 We agree. They’re ahead. With lots of uncertainty.
@LiberalVirginia @mlow29 @gelliottmorris I’m always willing to listen to @gelliottmorris! My point was merely to highlight the uncertainty right now.
@KevinQ @UpshotNYT Sole purpose of that word was to avoid suggestion that I deserved any credit for this project. 		But it’s also the case that you’re not a young man anymore.
@ThePlumLineGS I agree with that.
But of course these are only partial results so far, which is part of why I'm fascinated to watch the experiment. (5/5)
@ThePlumLineGS People who confuse a probability of 70% with one of 100%. I promise there are many such people.
True, the GOP incumbents are below 50%, which is often a problem for incumbents. But anyone who thinks the House is a shoo-in for the Democrats should rethink. (4/x)
The biggest takeaway from this new House polling, to my mind: The Democrats really may not win the House. The races polled so far - in California, Kentucky, Illinois, Minnesota - are the kinds Democrats need to win a whole bunch of. Yet they lead in none of the four races. (3/x)
It shows, for example, what a tiny percentage of pollsters' attempts to reach people actually lead to interviews. (2/x) https://t.co/1NVuw8KA4i

5. So Dems don't need to above 50 in the primary vote share in Calif. to feel good about the general. High 40s would be enough, based on historical averages. [End.]
4. The second point seems undeniably true, though: In recent Calif. elections, the Democratic share in general-election has been larger than in the primary. That is, a larger share of Rs show up for primaries than for Ds.
3. Time will tell, as the great journalistic cliche holds.
2. But it's unclear how much more positive the final vote count will be for Dems. @SteveKornacki says he's pursuing this (and he's worth following). @PatrickRuffini says Dem vote share may tend to rise more as general-election votes are count and not so much for primary votes.
1. Lots of pushback on the meaning of these numbers, which I RT'd. People are saying they're not meaningful for two reasons: a) They're not near the final vote count, because California counts slowly; and b) Democratic vote share tends to rise from primary to general. https://t.co/Cx5Lb9UlCR

@gelliottmorris Yes, I don't think most people are doubting the import of the numbers. I think Dems are saying: It's not very meaningful that the D share is currently under 50% in these districts.

@neeratanden No, I'm all for critical feedback. (And I should know that thinking out loud on Twitter is risky.) What I really would like to see are *initial* 2014 numbers, to see how much of a swing it is on an apples/apples basis. But those aren't so easy to find.

@bqbedbears @daswenson Those are two different questions, though: Should/do they fill their ranks with only kids who get the best SAT scores? (I'd say they shouldn't. And they clearly don't.)

The answer isn’t to make college a form of education only for the elite. Over time, mass education should grow: high school in the 20th century, college in the 21st. 		[end]
Or this piece, by @FernandaZamudio: https://t.co/yRZTwaiWT2
Or Bartik’s essay on the Upjohn website: https://t.co/Ed3mKyGFf3
And it’s telling that to make their case, skeptics sometimes resort to describing the data inaccurately. 		For more, read Bartik’s extended response on Twitter: https://t.co/1mFkry6gSn
When it comes to their own children, the college skeptics realize this. They make darn sure their kids go. Then they tell working-class families: *You* don’t need college. 		College for me and not for thee.
Understanding this gap is important. But it’s clearly a mistake to confuse “Who gets the biggest benefit?” with “Does college bring any benefit to lower-income students?” The answer to the second question is: Yes, an enormous one.
You can also see that college is often even more financially valuable for non-low-income students. At the median, for example, college is worth $514k for non-low-income students vs. $443k for lower-income.
As you can see, college grads consistently earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more than high-school grads. The median college grad from a low-income family earns $443,000 more than the median high-school grad from a low-income family, for example. https://t.co/7dWCod2s5p

@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias I find both your argument and that of your critics to be serious.
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias Your last tweet is the heart of it. I’m don’t think I agree with “never work with Trump”. But I don’t find the view antithetical to serious policy argument. I find it part of such argument.
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias My point is that the “don’t work with Trump” is a *substantive* view. The fact that people express it doesn’t automatically mean they’re trying to undo norms or paint the other side as unserious. It’s a debate to have on the merits, rather than on the legitimacy of the view.
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias On other hand, it’s not as common as sometimes claimed by people who are being criticized. And it’s not the same as tough but substantive criticism that calls you wrong and your view damaging. Latter seems fine to me – including when I’m on the receiving end.
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias That people criticized you for doing so seems aok to me. But how did they do so? If you're claiming they tried to disallow you from participating in a debate, be specific about how. Called you corrupt? Something else? I agree that this is a real phenomenon.
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias Marc: I see your point. I also find that point more persuasive when it is specific. As Matt said, it's perfectly legitimate for people to criticize you for supporting any part of the Trump agenda, just as it is for you to support a specific Trump policy. Both are coherent views.

@PeterKeaneMusic Not what I said. Only the reductive nature — “it’s only one, not the other!” — is counterproductive. Talking about racism is productive.
4. There is no need to make this an either-or debate. Cultural anxiety (including, yes, racism) and economic anxiety are both major political forces. 	(end)
3. Well, why is it less of a "good deal to be a white, Christian male in America"? In significant part because so many of those men and their families have suffered from slow-growing living standards for decades. 		Which one might reasonably summarize as "economic anxiety."
2. Here, for example, is the author of a new study claiming to refute economic anxiety as an explanation: "It used to be a pretty good deal to be a white, Christian male in America, but things have changed and I think they do feel threatened." https://t.co/NMm9psmuNq

@MarcGoldwein @BudgetBen @ppi That explanation seems to be working hard to apportion credit equally: When the Dems pass a fiscally responsible bill, the GOP deserves credit for motivating them to do so. 		Sure, that dynamic plays a role. But let’s hold each party responsible for the bills it actually passes.
@MarcGoldwein @BudgetBen @ppi Dems has WH and Congress in early 90s and made a big push to cut the deficit, which succeeded.
@eszterr2 And yet if you control more rigorously for economic conditions, Obama ends up looking much better. His major legislation was either 1) temporary (to combat financial crisis) or 2) paid for.
@MarcGoldwein @BudgetBen @ppi There’s probably some of that. And yet it wouldn’t explain the fiscal conservatism of the 1993-94  Congress or of the ACA. When GOP has WH and Congress, it has sent deficit soaring; not true of Dems.
As have the national population and the national productive capacity. https://t.co/zLHJgUlqAj
@TheStalwart Fair enough. Long term, we can't just increase the deficit, right? So I believe in fiscal responsibility from a first-order perspective. But that doesn't mean any individual president should bring it down.

The GOP’s vote-suppression efforts are abhorrent. But they’re not the main reason for low turnout among progressives.		Consider: Which of the big, left-leaning demographic groups has the highest turnout rate? African Americans. 		https://t.co/ClYGOYRj1j
@dabeard We will see. Turnout among 18-29 yo was 16 percent in the 2014 midterms.
@joke2power @nytopinion @jayrosen_nyu Not true. It mentions those efforts in the context of the impressive African-American turnout. Progressives are fooling themselves, in a self-defeating way, if they think suppression is the main reason for low turnout among the young and others.
To put it another way: Most of these Trump disapprovers don’t vote. https://t.co/ufXejeTyGg

@PGourevitch @paulkrugman I think the best short-term chance to win on DACA is not through a fight that makes it the most salient political issue in the country. Maybe that's not possible, but it's worth a shot. And if it's not possible, I'm not sure the Dems can solve it without retaking Congress.
Here's why I think the Democrats did the right thing today: https://t.co/6Xp6Iwh0JS
@PDG887 No. I'm saying the best chance to win on DACA is not through a fight that makes it the most salient political issue in the country. Maybe that's not possible, but it's worth a shot.
@qazz_qq Tell me more. Why do you think it's a win, not a draw?
@PGourevitch @paulkrugman My central question is: How do you see DACA being solved? I don't think it's through a long, high-profile shutdown in which illegal immigration becomes the No.1 political issue in the country.
@lucasfleischer I tried to get into this in a follow-up tweet. My central question: Why do you think a long shutdown over DACA would solve the issue?
Can someone explain -- in tweets or a fully argued piece -- why a long shutdown would likely lead the GOP to fold on DACA? I get why this deal doesn't solve it. I just don't see how a long shutdown does either. Why would R's feel pressure to cave? The politics are good for them.
@speechboy71 This was already a DACA shutdown in the minds of most people paying attention. I know the Dem argument about why that wasn't fair. But fair or not, it was the *political* reality.
Right. Also: "Never surrender!" sounds inspiring, but there wasn't a good endgame for Dems if this went on for weeks. The politics were not clearly bad for the GOP. They may even have been good. So it's not as if "Never surrender!" was likely to lead to big Dem policy gains. https://t.co/kChXSMfHGM

Janet was also a fierce and necessary advocate for women at the NYT. She knew the obstacles they face, here and everywhere. She knew we had to do better.
One day, during the planning, I sheepishly went to her and said, “I think we need another editor.” She looked at our plan and said, “I think you need two more.” (And Janet was not usually in favor of spending more of the NYT’s money.)
... more than any other NYT executive, she pushed for the creation of The Upshot, and she made sure we had the resources we needed to succeed.
Janet’s background was polling. She ran the NYT polling operation for years. She pushed it to do substantive polling, on race, class and other issues. She was rigorously skeptical of the newfangled ways that polls were and are being used. And yet ...

@DouthatNYT Yes, there are two problems on the corporate side: 	- It's a tax cut, not tax reform.	- It's too big of a tax cut.		Eliminating the second problem would help the politics of passing the bill but still leave the corporate part unimpressive from a policy standpoint.
Another way to say "out of whack": The corporate side of the bill is mostly the easy stuff, like rate cuts. It is very light on the hard part of reform: Reducing wasteful tax breaks. 		Thus the huge overall cost of the corporate part of the bill. https://t.co/1kGGd8yyDk

4. Today’s historically low tax rates on the wealthy drive inequality. Now Trump wants to cut those rates further. https://t.co/SCgrAtcuz4
3. Why? Many reasons. But one was a tax code with much higher rates on the very rich. It discouraged $10 million or $100m pay packages.
2. It was a different era. CEO’s willingly accepted less than maximum pay. The ratio of CEO pay to an average worker’s was only 20-to-1.

@holdengreene @EconCharlie Thanks very much.
@inishmuse Thank you!
@Fortunes_Wheel @savagecolin You get the last word! Thank you for the substantive criticism.
@Fortunes_Wheel @savagecolin I'd put it differently: I have enough confidence in progressive ideas to think they'll ultimately win on the merits, in an open debate.
@savagecolin @Fortunes_Wheel I don't think you want the answer to that. He was super conservative!
@Fortunes_Wheel @AnnalisaIIKG @savagecolin I bet I agree with you on the substance of many issues. But I'm not comfortable having liberals define good, acceptable conservativism.
@BraveSirDave It's the dominant position of the political party that currently controls the White House, Senate, House and most state governments. Alas.
@savagecolin @Fortunes_Wheel If the Flat Earth society had as much support as climate denial, I'd say yes. We don't beat these all-too-popular ideas by ignoring them.
@Fortunes_Wheel @savagecolin The trouble is, ideas that many liberals consider ridiculous are core tenets of conservatism. Should we bar them all from the op-ed page?
