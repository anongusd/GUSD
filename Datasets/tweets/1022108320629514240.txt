@HeathenAngel @girlsreallyrule Don't worry. I'm going to be the only Trump who doesn't end up being arrested by Mueller and sent to prison. Well me and grandson Barron. But he's not REALLY a Trump. His real dad lives in Russia.

@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett Shut up already, Donny.
@MinaANDMaya Please say you name him K. Rex
@dumptrump33 She's using the same math that nitwit Paul "doofus" Ryan used when existing the benefits of the tax cut.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Said the idiot who colluded with socialist Russia
@realDonaldTrump You liked like a big fat hippo, Donny. Your mother and I insist you lose 75 pounds before you have a heart attack. Son, your arteries have got to be clogged with vegetable oil by now.
@deeebeeezz @realDonaldTrump He used your greed and ignorance against you. https://t.co/fC1J5BjbYK

@kaitlancollins @SpeakerRyan didn't you get enough of my son's butt in two years of kissing it? Need more already?
@PapenShannon @FlaDems Normally I don't say things like this but Matt looks like a rich prick. Well except for his ghetto cheap suit and horrible haircut. Matt, who's your hairdresser? We should have Mueller investigate their beautician license and take it away.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don jr. Not a single charge of collusion or sexual assault among them either. Grandson, you're not as smart as you look. Update: You don't look very smart.
#MAGA https://t.co/M6tp5HbSUq
@donald_j_putin Agreed. See the pic below. These are just the figures for illegal immigrants. Imagine how much more tax revenue would be generated if you have them a legal path to work here, taxed it properly, and have them protecting against exploitation? Donny you idiot, you're throwing away $ https://t.co/TxtIpffEuM
@donald_j_putin Wait until he realizes how much tax money immigrants contribute to the coffers he wants to spend from.
@cydbennett11 @joncoopertweets He's also a moron, but neither is anything new.
@mattgaetz I'd build a wall myself it could stop you from ever talking again. You're as dumb as my son, Donny. And that kid is very very dumb. The dumbest!
@EdKrassen "We need an ocean wall that floats. A big beautiful wall made out of styrofoam. Effective immediately I'm putting a tariff on Chinese styrofoam." - My idiot son.
@WCCO @turnerdl307 I'd bet all my money hes a Trump supporter.
@FlaDems @PapenShannon Can a wall stop Matt Gaetz from talking? If it can I'll build it myself.

@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Let's here those numbers, kid.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Just curious Charlie, hire many black people are you friends with? How many of them have you had over to your house for dinner and then hung out with? Now the same question, but for Hispanics? Muslims? Asians? Anyone not white?
@charliekirk11 They tried that with Obama, how many prosecutions did it result in? Asking for 320 million friends.
@realDonaldTrump Obama never commited treason against the people of the United States. Donny, you're like a frog in boiling water, you don't realize how hot it is until it's too late.
@realDonaldTrump If they were Republican, Donny, you would be accusing the woman of making stuff up and saying the blackface makeup is just a joke and everyone needs to get over it.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, it's really too bad you never got to play @BarackObama in a round of golf. He would have schooled you, son, I've seen him play. I've also seen you play, Donny your long game REALLY stinks.
@realDonaldTrump "There's an emergency at the border, nice putt Tiger!" These two things counterdict each other Donald.
@realDonaldTrump Here's someone who saw it; I'm not sure she's actually applauding it and clearly you're oblivious to what she's actually saying to you, but when you've got the brain of a donkey, well, they name you Donald. https://t.co/gYsVeJyPuK
@realDonaldTrump Only my idiot son would brag about a grade of less than 50%. That's not even a D Donald! It's an F. Hail Zeus! You're as dumb as Don Jr.! And that kid is as dumb as a bag of broken tea cups!
@realDonaldTrump Here's another woman to clap for you and make you feel special, Donny. https://t.co/mnWOokJmMv
@realDonaldTrump Well besides that unlimited investigation and harassment of Bill Clinton over a sexual encounter, and then when they went after Reagan for the contra affair, and then that Nixon guy and Watergate. Nixon got it to stop by resigning son, maybe you should too.

@ItsJeffHudson Hanging with Donald has that effect on people
@dumptrump33 Alec Baldwin dressed as Donald
@senatemajldr That's not what your MAGA idiots are saying Mitch. They're saying your #Taxcut screwed them.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Jesus Mark, how does my son's ass taste? Clearly you just French kissed his rear end like a school girl after prom.
@annalise_webb @terrycrews He did that on his own.
@Kokomothegreat He's thinking "Can Donald smell that I pooped in my pants? There is no way Nancy doesn't smell it, but what about Donald? "
@MKGenest I think that's her "I'm passing gas, I shouldn't have eaten that potato borsch" look. The squinty eyed harpy could fuel air Force one after eating potato borsch. Not joking, her Russian KGB trainers modified her intestines to generate toxic gas.
@InspiringU2 Fart.
@siano2020 Honestly I think that kind of thinking prevents is from countering the stupid arguments and lies he's going to make tonight. It's difficult to tell Republicans what he said was wrong if you didn't see the speech in order to counter it.
@Ironhorse76 When they impeach my idiot son
@RealMuckmaker Eric = Idiot
@e_schimpf78 They (IRS? Dems? u didn't specify) find out what your income is when u file your taxes, not when you post a picture humble-bragging about buying a Ferrari. No doubt you paid a sales tax, probably a gas guzzler tax, maybe luxury sales tax on your car. Still Not related  to income
@e_schimpf78 I'm going to go out on a limb here and say income tax is figured based on your income, not what you spend.
Republiturd tears taste sweet and savory https://t.co/dRg2e4wKbu
@GrassrootsSpeak @averagejousa The companies earned those billions anyways not the billionaires. They are running the companies blind and the proposed higher taxes will take what they steal from the workers and give it to the workers via government representation.
@trumpdictionary @realDonaldTrump Is Putin a Republican too? Seems like he's pretty involved in the Republican party.
@MattDav72811123 @realDonaldTrump I bet Hillary's emails aren't looking so bad right about now. @HillaryClinton how do those conservative tears taste? https://t.co/FiP2UknWbO

@RawStory @OdoyleCharlotte Eric, you were my last hope of a Trump kid not going to prison. Don't screw this up, just shut up and go run Trump Corp. By the way, you were adopted.
@siano2020 Generally I feel the same about "people" but "they" is almost the same in my book. Of course my son Donny uses them interchangeably. "He" is an idiot, however so don't take "that" to 💓.
@JAG_atthebeach @Jared_Carrabis Oh I bet your Non-Patriot fan friends are going to suffer greatly this year, John. You don't happen to play fantasy football do you?
@SocialPowerOne1 So, Tony did your mom get pregnant on her own by irresponsibly having sex?
@Jared_Carrabis @JAG_atthebeach What can't the NE Patriots do?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A wall won't stop the sexual assaults and violence from occurring. So please explain how Donald Trump will work to help stop sexual assaults and violence against these hopeful migrants who hope to become Americans? What has he proposed to stop the sex assault and violence sweety?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No wonder they want to get the Hades out of Mexico. With all that going on, we should welcome these people with jobs, they will be grateful to escape and become tax paying members of the community!
@welcomet0nature @RoseBeckley The LA Rams should have started him as running back.

@Wendys What is it if you think you win Everytime, but you actually turn everything you touch into a smoldering pile of dog crap?
@atDavidHoffman I'll be watching if only hoping to see Nancy lose her mind and put Donald in a head lock. His mother used to do that to him to get him to stop eating off everyone else's plate.
@maydaymindy9 That's close to Don's favorite. He loves a brick of lard on a stick dipped in mayonnaise. Usually washed down with a mountain dew mixed with some coffee. You should smell his breath.

@Fraughty @atDavidHoffman So if billionaires get taxed at 70% or 90% all they need is to use some math and do a little planning, a little planning guarantees they'll get a return even when taxed at 70% or 90%. Good lesson to share, Chris.

@DearAuntCrabby It might be worth a dollar to have my new name "Mynutz AreIchy" scroll across the screen. I could throw an extra dollar in to scroll my grandsons new name "MAGATARD McDUMBSHIT" across the screen to. There's all kinds of possibilities for a person with a creative name.
@KayKosmos I wouldn't have minded then taking my kid away back in 62, would have saved his mother and I (and most of you) a lot of trouble.
@Santiagojjjr @Avid_Maddow_Fan It also says "I am an ignorant ignoramus"

@JohnJHarwood Then he doesn't need funding
@naretevduorp @LindseyGrahamSC It happened on December 30. Look at his tweets they changed on that day.
@WalshFreedom God wants Sarah to be unable to find employment outside the White House. So she's stuck right where she is at.
@RealMuckmaker Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons, Orange Stars, Green Clovers, and Blue Diamonds!
@Kokomothegreat @KevTKel Is your mom single? It's she into older, rich ghosts?
@KellyannePolls Great big fake news, Medusa.
@KaitMarieox Honey, You're not Donny's type, he won't sleep with you. Your chest is too small, and you're about 25 pounds overweight. You're way more likely to get into the White House by trying to get Don Jrs attention. He has low standards and poor taste in women. Your low IQs match too.
@SethMacFarlane Giggity!
@EndDeportations https://t.co/tqvBdMkBoF
@realDonaldTrump Maybe that's why they are fleeing Mexico. You're making a better case for more border crossing staff and not a wall.
@realDonaldTrump If it's already being built then what do you need the money for? You were always like this Donald begging for money but no business plan or budget sheet to show me how you were going to use my money.
@realDonaldTrump Thanks to you son the GOP has become the party of Dumb and dumber.
@RandPaul How much are you pitching in to that Wall you so passionatly believe in?
@RandPaul Congratulations. Maybe you'll be able to afford a decent haircut now.
@realDonaldTrump Oh crust on a piece of toast, Donald you didn't even know Viet Nam existed until your mother told you about it in 1983
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I heard there were five headed to the Canadian border
@realDonaldTrump Im sure you'll say something disappointing and it will ill evaporate to a 3000 point drop over the next week or so
@donald_j_putin @OdoyleCharlotte Big stupid bear is the secret services code name for my son.
@george_capen He could have just sent a couple of powerful hurricanes and raging wildfires, no need to give us a double whammy by putting my knuckle headed son into political office.
@BettyBowers What are the odds in Vegas that Stone also rubbed that morticians make-up all over his giant, saggy, thin gray pubed balls too? If I had $50 I bet I'd win $1000s because count chocu-nuts here smeared that stuff on his sack.
@donald_j_putin @OdoyleCharlotte I find your story hard to believe. My son would never give something to eat away too another person or animal. He is very territorial about food. My guess is he ate the other guy himself. No one says he wasn't a cannibal.
@DogginTrump Did he say it while wearing that awful brown-black face make up?
@donald_j_putin @OdoyleCharlotte I don't understand a word this guy said, but he sure looks like Vladimir, my son Donald's best friend going back to when we sent him to a Siberian summer camp in 1974. I was hoping the tundra would swallow him whole never to be seen again Vlad saved him from the tundra. Sad.
@arappeport @PressSec looks like he wasted you to be sick in a dead end job with zero integrity, ethics or hope for a future. Yep, @god workers in mysterious ways, Sarah. I'm sure he doesn't want your husband to leave you. Yet.
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseForeign You're a racist moron.
@SpiesVespers @PapenShannon I just threw up in my mouth a little. Actually we're taking about Roger Stone. I threw up in my mouth a lot.
@dylanmsmitty Half of the white people and all of the brown people. 		Did I get it right?
@pherring So you make money recycling the materials? Run into asbestos walls in office still or are they mostly gone?
@donald_j_putin @OdoyleCharlotte That Squinty eyed harpy is even more litigious than my idiot kid. Plus she is a Russian agent sent here to be a handler if the KGBs dumbest asset, my Donny. Don't be fooled by her "Slovenian" origins, birth certificates can be faked, as my son is so fond of claiming.
@pherring ok I'll bite. What's your strange job?
@ewarren @OdoyleCharlotte @senatemajldr Move it to a Saturday.
@tedlieu @SummerSoldier12 @realDonaldTrump Ted. That's not true. Some if the American people are not stupid. And then there are Trump supporters, you know those idiots that voted my kid into office? They're Americans too. And totally brainless, and they haven't caught on to his schtick yet.
@RawStory @OdoyleCharlotte There's a pretty good chance god wants Sarah Sanders to be unable to find employment outside the White House too.
@TheGoodGodAbove Well if God wanted Donald Trump to be president then I'm pretty sure he wants @PressSec to be unable to find anyone to hire her. Because everything happens the way good wants it to happen Sarah. When a million Twitter users send you hatemail, it's because God wanted that too.....
@HowardA_Esq @Zeus350Z He also wears depends and has since he turned 61. He wore diapers until he was 11 and still wet the bed until 15. I'm not so sure he ever stopped really. One things for sure, my son had been soaked with pee his whole life. Why do you think that great hair turns yellow?
@maximiana_p @TSearcaigh @realDonaldTrump How you doing? https://t.co/P81SPi9YzJ
@joeyandmosh @OMGno2trump @BoogidFfskw2002 SWOOOOOSHHH. You might do something differently, the part you missed in my tweet is that Donny hasn't learned and he's going to do the same exact thing and he expects different results. Hence, he is insane.
@OMGno2trump @BoogidFfskw2002 The definition of insanity: doing the same thing expecting different results.
@CNNTonight @miguelmarquez @realDonaldTrump Donny, you moron. Mother told you to quit watching do much television! Look how is rotted your brain.
@TSearcaigh Blood sucking vampires need to cover their pasty white skin so regular humans don't recognize them during the day. Seriously if ever there were a candidate to be the real Nosferatu it's this freak.
@realDonaldTrump Donny are you going to build a wall around Kansas? https://t.co/3qTPPdkkMs
@realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTheMF if you law makers don't then you are bigger idiots than he is.
@televictim22 What's your save word?
@pirateskull21 Oh Simpleton Samuel! She's a con artist? How can a fellow who sent her $250k get his donation back? Asking for a grandson. Not Barron. Not Eric.
@BryanDawsonUSA @betteramerica5 Maybe that's the wall he thinks he's trying to build
@MollyJongFast @SFnativekelly @HowardSchultz That's debatable. The better hair part.
@AngelaBelcamino @betteramerica5 More thoughts and prayers from my idiot kid. Donny you're all talk and zero action.
@JohnHargenrader @GeorgeTakei This guy bots.
@maggieNYT @RGilfert On his head, I hope. I only dropped him on it one time.
@treasonstickers @Atencio1Ron I agree. @StormyDaniels is a financial genius. Donald should have dumped the squinty eyed harpy 12 years ago and proposed to Stormy. Trump Corp would be worth 2x Apple Corp.
@bjcreigh @MonaMdmeupanova I can't upstage this in anyway. Except maybe to say that Donald has actually shit the carpet. He also has a hairy ass. I imagine that Donny has trouble cleaning back there. It's got to be like wiping peanut butter out of shag carpeting.
@in_pubs @tucsonrosie2001 Nailed it. Someone should make that guy suck on a bar of soap.
@SarahPalinUSA So he asked you to deliver the address Sarah? You should be honored and jump at the chance. Especially considering you ruined John McCain's chance at winning the presidency. You've done more for Democrats than they can thank you for. You gave them Barack Obama.
@seanhannity Haven't you had my son on your dirty trailer house of a show enough this year?
@jmsexton_ @dianerocks52 Donny, you idiot! The reason you got people smarter than you is so they can do the thinking and you can do the golfing. Quit meddling and let them do their job! By the way, a 3 for a handicap? Bull feathers!
@clevergalCA @SarahPalinUSA You know how she said she can see Russia from her house? I think we found the source of collusion. Somebody tell Donny we found the witch they've been hunting for.
@MollyJongFast @shannonrwatts Wasn't she the star of "Real lives of trailer house wives".
@ShelbyKStewart This woman needs to walk into Congress wearing only a thong bikini bottom and rainbow colored nipple tassles. Half the old bastards will drop dead of heart failure and we can finally vote new blood in. Tell her to avoid Donny's office though, he can't keep his hands to himself.
@KamalaHarris @dianerocks52 My son needs to support you so please add him, president at https://t.co/j76Hwfa79Z.
@StormyDaniels How about "The Witch Hunter: a tiny tale."
@StormyDaniels @SummerSoldier12 @MELANIATRUMP someone mixed you and stormy up again. Tell Barron Grandpa says hi. Have him color some more pictures for my fridge door. Thanks.
@DerekCressman He should be looking for who stole his pot of gold. It was last seen at the end of a rainbow. Kind of careless for a leprechaun like Graham to misplace his Lucky charms.
@davidhogg111 @stsabinachurch Socks are the most requested item by homeless people at a shelter. Bring extra socks every time you make a donation.
@mela_shea this made me think of you. https://t.co/xYjmqyMzet
@TheGoodGodAbove Listen here God, this is your fault! When you were handing out brains my kid was in the back of the room and clearly you gave him one you dropped on the floor and didn't pick up right away OR rinse it off. Now look at what an idiot he's become. #ThanksGod
@TomiLahren Look at you. You sure are a cute little Barbie. My grand daughter, Ivanka the terrible used to collect dolls like you and play tea time and dress up with them when she was little. The dolls were a little more animated and a whole lot more educated, however.
@tundra5010 @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/KAAN0lWuhA
@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you built a wall between Canada and the United States the weather would be contained in Canada as nothing stops anything like a wall does.
@bwh333 Donny wanted to date Mary, his mother too. He also fondled her in much the same way. It was always awkward with that kid.
@56blackcat Zzzzziiipppp
@MrFilmkritik Mitch isn't going to run for president in the Democrat ticket is he? Weird flex but ok.
@CyrusMMcQueen Honestly he looks like the dead guy in "Weekend at Bernie's 2". That makeup looks like the makeup a mortician uses.
@AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump I think Donald is getting laid tonight for sure. Can you imagine the pillow talk between those two?
@WalshFreedom For example after the next school shooting a democratic president could declare a national emergency because Americans are dying and seize all the guns and ammo in the country. If building a wall is an emergency surely protecting school children is as well.
@MarshallCohen No one dumped that old queen at sea in a burlap blanket. I think he's going to be ok.
@Bravewriting Who's Bernie?
@56blackcat Just curious about how long it took for the first one to show up in your dm after posting this.
@essenviews I get the feeling he's turned on by her outfit. He just doesn't know how to express that in a healthy way. If course just look at him. I don't think that dusty sack of bones has ever understood how to talk to a woman his entire life. But hey no judging right?
@SenGillibrand I'll help! #Impeachmyidiotson
@RealMuckmaker I know that face all to well. Donald has just shart himself. That's when you try to fart and a little shit comes out. He does this all the time mostly because he eats greasy fast food every day. All that wealth and he eats like he's only got enough to buy a value meal.
@Dax_x98 That looks like something straight out of my son Donald's diaper when he was eight.
@siano2020 Just because Donny's a law breaking idiot doesn't mean she shouldn't follow the rules laid out for the three branches. Besides I'm looking forward to the Bad Lip Reading video on YouTube the next day. No one has done a better job making fun of Donny then that guy.
@Dangchick1 You should have heard his squeaky voice when he was 5, the kid would never shut up. One night I tried to hold a pillow over his face just to shut him up. He ate his way through the pillow and kept talking. He hasn't stopped since. It was like a nightmare raising that kid.
@VABVOX I kind of want that AOC lady to win the Whitehouse. Now that would drain some swamp. And it would turn half the GOPs hair instantly white. Even the toupees. On the other hand I think Michelle Obama should run. #Michelle2020 @Oprah what do you think?
@B52Malmet @SpeakerPelosi Unfortunately I have penned in my schedule that I'll be taking a poop at that time. Sorry Donny, dad's going to miss your big boy speech.
@RWPUSA Out of character: I think this poll came from a bubble. Trump supporters are disillusioned and holding on even tighter to his crazy ideologies more than ever. People who might voter dem voted against Hillary not for Trump, but they still bad mouth her, even while bad mouthing him
@stucam7771 @sillymickel Have you tried telling them to shut up because they are idiot Trump supporters? It's fairly effective. Especially when you're his dad. But even when you aren't, it works.
#Trump2020 and #BuildTheWallAndCrimeWillFall supporters, you should know my son had absolutely no idea what he is talking about and he just makes this stuff up as he goes along, hoping you will accept his numbers without evidence of any kind to support his blathering. https://t.co/CbmEUCsAdZ
@BrienneOfSnark_ @sue_sume I hope she can beat Donny. My kid is an idiot and shouldn't be in charge of anything. Let alone "the country".
@ReneeLibby2 Do you mean this @JacobAWohl ? He sure is a quaint little fellow. I bet he's really good at showing people how to wear Oakleys and Revos.
@Stop_Trump20 Double ewww. I wouldn't be surprised if my Donny is sleeping with both of them.
@thehill Are we sending out "save the date" invites weekend ahead of time for arrests warrents now? What are you a blushing bride? What mamby pamby kind of country do you think this is, Roger? God knows you're wearing more make up than a bride on her wedding day.
@ROBBIEGARCIA67 @realDonaldTrump You know my son Donald has cheated on all of his wives and is accused of raping one of his ex-wives. Do you actually believe he reads the Bible?
@HowardSchultz No thanks. Plenty of people to choose from who have done good for America, and we all ready have a corporate meglomaniac candidate in the GOP side so I think we're good.
@atDavidHoffman No thanks. Hillary can't be on the ticket. Democrats love her. Like crazy. But non Democrats generally don't and Republicans loathe her. You want dem candidates who will do good AND lure independent and GOP voters to ensure Trump loses Put her on the ticket, you have 4 more w Don
@AOC @dianerocks52 Then they call scooping up that money "earning" it and say it's unfair to tax what they fairly "earned" sorry but the entire company and all the workers "earned" the money, if you won't pay them then we will tax you and return the "earning" to them that way. 'Merica!
@GreatScott1991 When you brag about your new house insurance rates it does.
@mcspocky @riotwomennn Hey Jerry all those shootings in 2018 have been carried out by Christians-extremist terrorists!
@KenPaxtonTX @TXsecofstate So Republicans have been using non US citizen id's to register and illegally cast votes for GOP candidates in Texas? Well damned be all the Republican wins in Texas, let's have redos on every GOP held office since Republicans are cheating with fake voter registration in Texas
@mkraju @CNNSotu Rolling over and showing your belly isn't concession... It's complete surrender. It's the little nuances of the English language that makes it so expressive.
@bwh333 Come on now Brad I heard there were at least six Democrats in the United States that might want the wall. When asked they said "Meh... Yeah I don't know. Whatever." They were quoted in the survey as saying "...Yeah..." When asked if they want the wall. That's many according 2 Fox
@WoodyWoodcaster Woody, my friend, that squinting harpy is a double secret agent actually from Russia. She's what the CIA  called an asset handler, in my day. It won't take long for anyone with a brain to figure what asset she's been handling or for who. Did I mention, my son is an idiot, yet?
@WoodyWoodcaster Can we build a wall around Florida? Not just at the border, the whole thing? Asking for 299 million friends
@WoodyWoodcaster Let's deport this terrorist back to his country of origin! Someone call ICE! Where's my son? Donny! Send this terrorist back to the country he came from!
Deport these terrorists to their country of origin, Donny! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/CbtvIvz5qd

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends So @tedcruz the zodiac killer didn't beat @BetoORourke ? Well son, declare a miselection and let's see who wins, Ted or Beto?

@stonecold2050 Donny, you should be trying to sleep with this woman! She gets things done. If you could get her to take over your job as president, you wouldn't have to work and you could play golf all day!

@tedlieu @loisvilla @realDonaldTrump Whose the bigger fool, Donny? The guy who let's good country shut down and damages billions of dollars in resources in the process which will be spent recouping the loses to get absolutely nothing in return or the people who follow and support a cackling crow?
@NightlyPolitics Tell my Donny that you'll use the first five billion of her tax to build the walls and he will get the republiturds to support it. They aren't that bright and they do whatever he tells them to do if it makes sense or not, and it might be worth it to get the tax passed
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That's also where the next caravan is coming from. I think. Didn't Donny day that a couple days ago?
@realDonaldTrump Donny, you should offer to help Juan get a wall built to keep the Mexicans out of Guatamala, you've done such a good job here, I'm sure he'd appreciate your advice.
@realDonaldTrump Donny, it's not that great of a witch Hunt. They have yet to find any witches. So far just traitors to the United States and people who have colluded with a foreign government. Your FBI has found more colluders than Obama's did. You should be proud of what a good job they do!
@RepDavidTrone @realDonaldTrump Did I hear my idiot son say he wants to start a draft to build the wall now?
@tonyposnanski Clearly my son has been been sleeping with that hissing gargoyle. She's injected him with her poisonous venom and it melted what little brain power he has.
@thomaskaine5 Well. Isn't that what history had shown, all dictatorships are only temporary. Like 50-100 years temporary?
@MKGenest WOP. You don't have to be a genius to figure the acronym out. Problem is they wouldn't have a problem with it.
@SassyKadiK Look, you can't seriously believe an intelligent person would follow my kid? He is followed by people with lower IQs than his!

@phantastic99 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump There's only one reason to make a correction like Mueller did and that's because he's about to release his report on you Donny.

@realDonaldTrump Open American government again, or America will close it's borders to you and the government, Donald. You won't be able to fly anywhere starting Monday. #MLKStrike #TSAWalkout  on #MLKDay
@realDonaldTrump If you really believed this, son, you wouldn't be in bed with the Russians. You also wouldn't have America stuck in this ridiculous shut down. That's not putting America first. You're mother and I are so disappointed in you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Grandson, what about your father's blatent antimuslim hatred? How about holding him accountable for that "king of the travel bans" Don Jr? I wouldn't hold your breath either.  The smell is unbearable.

@VABVOX Buttery Males
Donald! You've done this to yourself you miserable oaf! I always told you never screw the people who do the work for you it will come back to haunt you. I hope everyone retweets the hashtag #MLKWalkout and helps bring Washington back to reality when the planes can't fly.
Time for a #MLKDay  #TSAWalkout there can be no better tribute to Dr. King than to protest oppression of the poor, the downtrodden, the forgotten workers of this country who do so much to serve and protect our country while they languish unpaid like slaves. #MLKwalkout please rt!
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump What's wrong with prayer mats, anyway?
@jbendery @bk_pitt I don't know about you but after my kid gets impeached this cupcake is going to be an easy but annoying ride down hill to a Democrat victory in 2020. Democrats hurry up and #ImpeachMySon so we can run over this idiot and get some laws passed.
@csu_scientist Nip this one in the bud just like you did to Steve King.
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Question: what makes you think  you'll find anything but more lies and frustration hidden in his tax returns? They are always under audit. He lies and cheats on everything he does. It's not like the truth fairy will pop out wave her wand and suddenly it will all make sense.
@EdKrassen why aren't you and your brother organizing a #TSAstrike for MLK day? #MLKWalkout and peaceful protest would be a healthy American tribute to Dr King, clearly an American hero and send a message to Washington that my Donald isn't in charge.
@TalbertSwan Donald, if these are the people you are relying on for support, your political adventures are in more trouble than I thought.

Another well thought out stunt, son. More proof that your brain has been rendered inactive by all the hamberders you have been eating during your wall shutdown. Donald, you're an idiot! https://t.co/Ns6purFaCJ
Enough is enough. Time for a #TSAWalkout until Donald gives in. It will take about 48 hours of pressure on the white House from corporate America if air travel is shut down in this country. TSA workers we have got your back in this &amp; we need you more than you know.
@SethMacFarlane could you say "the fat sex is the best sex Lois! I don't know where your rolls end and mine begin! "
@KimDHello @KevTKel @ndrew_lawrence @LouDobbs It's not illegal to be stupid, Kim. Which is how my son Donald has skated along for so long.

@SBusinessDreams @IndyPendant1776 @kate_mccrea Donald you should have married @StormyDaniels she's got guts, good looks, brains and good business sense, all gaps that you have She would have been great @ running Trump enterprises but instead you wanted the squinty eyed harpy who incidentally was pregnant from that Russian guy
@Hbobrow1Hbobrow @dlspace108 She thinks she is part of the shutdown.

@tomselliott @bbennett94 Tom, the Irony here is that the only one that doesn't know about it being out there is Sen. Graham himself. Like a dog scared of his own shadow. Or a Donald scared of his dad's ghost.
@omzmusic @TrumpFighter @realDonaldTrump You forgot me. I'm almost hurt.
@ChadPergram How about being the president in this case and sending your squinty eyed wife in a government funded plane to Florida 8 hours later? I mean who can blame him I'd send her away too, but at tax payer expense, come on Donald!

This one is going on my Pinterest page I titled "Nailed it!" https://t.co/3EHoylhZbE
@aravosis @shurtis123 He might be more afraid that they'll be more excited to see her than they were to see him. It's a bit like when his sister would come home from school and his mother and I would meet her at the door excited to see her. When Donald came home we would flee the house.
Donald since you're letting friends and family fly on the government dime how about letting Barron fly out to visit Grandpa for the week. We'll do some horseback riding and go snipe hunting. https://t.co/sUEzHlGsQd

@Stop_Trump20 Donald's mother took this of him when we were vacationing in Disney back in 75. She says he was still burning off his baby fat.

Donald, son! Good news! https://t.co/CLjYH0GssJ
@Acosta Of course he does, my son is a moron and doesn't get the finer art of networking or political negotiations. In the end this ill timed stunt that he no doubt stayed up all night with Nazi Miller putting it together will come back to haunt him such as when his wife flies to Florida
@keithboykin Kissing my son's but I'm the oval office, no doubt.
@NightlyPolitics She squints like a harpy.
#TSAsickoutFriday #TraficControllerSickoutFriday	What's Donny going to do, fire you all and replace you with unpaid workers? My son's an idiot! Go on strike Friday morning don't come back until he opens the government. You'll be back to work by Tuesday morning. Rt please!

@bluefish787 I ask myself that every morning
@seacane @CNN @FoxNews Can you resign from an unpaid position? Asking for 800,000 friends.
@realDonaldTrump Left, right, up, down, a, b, a, b, start, continue, start this tweet sounds like one of those post it notes you used to leave by the Nintendo video game machine you had installed in the Trump tower board room. I told you that thing would rot your brain! Get back to work Donald!
@realDonaldTrump Timing is everything son. Just ask Bill Cosby. Get the girl a drink AFTER getting her consent, no crime. You're an idiot, Donald. You're making you're mother do the thing where she fans herself with the newspaper again. She's very upset!
@SpeakerPelosi Atta girl Nancy. Stick it to that fat tub of lard. He's running the family business anyway by giving it to Junior and Eric the elastic man.
@B52Malmet 2 scoops? Is Donald on a diet?
@B52Malmet He probably saw that corpse woman Kelly Conway walking around. That would scare the be Jesus out of me before or after morning coffee.
@JeriFinke @Phil_Mattingly @SpeakerPelosi @FoxReports @arogDC #TweetOfTheUnion address, instead of #SOTU . Donald will go for it if he sees the idea.
@MissMelicious @Phil_Mattingly @SpeakerPelosi @FoxReports @arogDC That little Nazi Stephen Miller that came here from the 1940s Germany through a time machine will write it. Someone get that guy away from my kid! He's dangerous. I don't know how he and Kushner can sit in the same room without trying to throttle each other.
@maidinbritain2 @Phil_Mattingly @SpeakerPelosi @FoxReports @arogDC He can't. I would know.
@coleyworld Just when I thought that hideous horsetoothed gargoyle couldn't get any more frightening, someone takes it up three notches. Someone send this to Donald, it might weaken his Viagra fueled super-erection.
@GeorgeTakei George, it's 2019.
@perlmutations @Suma4720 Unfortunately my child IS the Russian plant and my grand children will almost all end up in jail with my idiot son, except maybe my step grandson Barron. I'm kind of sweet on that kid, he's got potential. He can color between the lines. Donald would just scribble all over.
@RandPaul @foxandfriends Evidently it's because Isis is winning now.
@Kokomothegreat @Suma4720 "During the press conference I would say Isis is defeated. Obviously I never said this and I never meant they were done fighting back and doing terrorist stuff. " -my idiot son Donald's statement for later this afternoon.
@GeorgeTakei "I never said Trump himself hacked the servers himself, he didn't actually sit down at the computer and do the hacking. He has people for that." -Slimey Giuliani
@jhchilcutt @Rose52413 @NightlyPolitics @AnnCoulter That hissing gargoyle is as dumb as my son and maybe even more narcissistic than he is. Normally any woman with real self esteem would be out of his league but she's got 2 things in her favor, an ego to rival Donald's and his brain is clouded by a back-up of sperm.
@Dazshand26 @cyferPtVila @johnupton You mean Mexicans don't build monster trucks and go mudding before tailgating with some Bud Light before shooting it up at the gun range?

Where's Donny? https://t.co/7OuLDPVIXM
@realDonaldTrump is your toilet broken? Are you constipated? We haven't seen you sit &amp; shoot off an hour of ill timed and poorly thought out tweets in 48 hours. Someone should do a welfare check on Donny and make sure he isn't in a coma from eating 1000 leftover BigMac hamberders
@thistallawkgirl What I want to know is who built the time machine to bring that Nazi Miller here from the past? Donny I think you've hired one of Hitler's actual henchmen.
@othello38 @DiamondandSilk They're well paid by my Donny to pander their "views" as genuine. They'll keep it up until the money stops coming in.
@Bill_Maxwell_ I don't know who this fellow is but he could use a haircut.
@GeorgeTakei George, remember that beautiful Tammy Wynette song, D-I-V-O-R-C-E ? This moment reminded me that we used to Rock Donald to sleep in his crib to that song. Of course he was 22 by then, but then again he still wet the bed so it was all the same to us.
@B52Malmet Tweet of the union
@keithboykin @shivas65 When are they going to pay for it? Indirectly over time... Via compound interest deductions that trickle down through tax reimbursement stamps... Donald!!! What kinds of horse apple peanut butter is this crap? Of all the cockamamie schemes this has to be your most idiotic one yet
If they had they would have found my son's Squinty eyed harpy wife and my step grandson Barron. That little Russian kid may not have my genetics but he has something that Donald doesn't which I can be real proud of. An IQ higher than his age. https://t.co/IV174B63DJ

True story. https://t.co/ZattWa3iKp
Somebody fly Donny out here and tell him the Democrats caved and built the damned wall. It's not like he can tell the difference between Canada and Mexico.

@JoeNBC Earlier today I heard some of Donald's idiot supporters saying you shouldn't lock your doors or windows if you don't need a wall for national security. If Isis is defeated why not have the Republican national convention in northern Syria? Donald, you're a blunder head, son.

@DavidBrodyCBN @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump David if you think my boy can play checkers let alone identify a single game piece in chess then you should give your bachelor's degree back to whatever fake college Wikipedia says you received it from.

@itsJeffTiedrich A future Soviet annex?
@GenXNukeBaby @bluefish787 @TSA I don't know if you noticed this but my idiot son, Donald Trump, doesn't read, at least not what other people write. Unless it is completing some bullshit thing he thinks he's done, then that half-wit will half-read it and then brag about what it "kind of" said.
@Onabender716 @bluefish787 @TSA *cat not car. I do despise auto-correct.
@Onabender716 @bluefish787 @TSA Donald dips his hard-boiled eggs in dipping chocolate, sugar and then that Carmel you dip apples in before salting them, It's disgusting! You should smell his breath afterwards! My dead car Orvis has better breath after gently licking his own balls clean on a hot Summers day.
@bluefish787 @senatemajldr Donald, you should listen to this guy. He's got a point.
@RandPaul Donny who is this idiot, and why in Hades are you entertaining a single word he says? He sounds like a communist to me! A pinko red hiding in the bushes the kind that would steak your mother's purse in Central Park and her underwear too. I think this guy would wear them.
@itsJeffTiedrich @nytimes If you're excited to see the pee tape, wait until you get a "load" of the poop tape. And I mean load. My son Donald really can polish away 100 hamberders on his own and that really generates a really really big really fine load. https://t.co/kY4kNCTMFu
@krassenstein I'm sorry, did you say wetting? Donald's been known to wet a bed or 2 and would wet the bed every night until the age of 15. He even shit the bed a few times when he came home on Xmas break from military school. Why the school had Xmas off when the military didnt was beyond me.
@realDonaldTrFan You sound just like my kid!
@costareports @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachMyMFSon
@realDonaldTrump Donald we donated millions to the Democrats in the 80s and 90s to benefit our real estate business by lobbying them to vote for laws in our favor. We also donated to the Republicans at the same time. Why in horsefeathers are you dumping on them now?
@Stevespoc @realDonaldTrump Why punish the homeless and make them meet my idiot son?
@realDonaldTrump This sounds just like the crap you would say as a child Donny. "Billy's mom and dad let him ride a Lincoln limo, why can't I? There are 26 other rich kids riding a helicopter to school but I have to walk..." Always whining about what the other kids have. You disappoint me, son.

@bill_auclair @Candy_Smitty @realDonaldTrump He's right Donald, you Lilly livered schmuck! I should be the only voice in your head you listen to. I may be dead but I'm still your father, Donny Dum dum.
@kathygriffin @Candy_Smitty Please, Kathy, Donny's mother and I are trying to clean up his filthy mouth. Could you try using more appropriate language such as "Why are you a lazy tub of lard?" I find calling out his fat gut helps keep his ego in check as a little bonus on the side.
@SteveFM20 @GrudzienBarbara The myth that many of my son's moron MAGA supporters being that the liberals don't buy guns is a dangerous one. Plenty of them own and buy firearms. They just want to prevent crazy MAGAs from buying them and killing children at school or people at concerts.

@treasonstickers @ACFOSTER66 Hey @senatemajldr you're winning the popularity contest! Mitch I didn't care much for you when I was alive and I like you a whole lot less now that I'm dead. One thing about you Mitch- you're still an amateur. You shouldn't have done business with the Russians. They will collect.

@bluefish787 @TSA Now this is #Resistance in action. @TSA #furloughed workers should strike back and really shut America down. My idiot son won't know what to do when the workers rebel and there country starts throwing eggs at the white House. Of course Donny might try to eat the eggs.

@jimmykimmel hi it's me Donald's dad. Don't act suprised like you didn't see this coming one day. I've got a theory that my idiot son's supporters would believe the world is flat if they thought Donald tweeted it. You should test this theory out. Or get Donald to tweet it.
@GOPLeader Hey Kevin as long as you're whispering sweet dreams of a prison wall between the USA and Mexico to my moron son, why don't you also let him know there are zero feet of wall between the USA and Canada where more drugs cross the border than do in Mexico. Where's the Canadian wall?

@nickiknowsnada @JAG_atthebeach It's no wonder my kid is so fat, eating this garbage. I can only begin to imagine his triple digit cholesterol in the high 300's and the double digit A1-c can you imagine how dysfunctional Donny's liver is?
@KnittelFiddle *deflate gate
@HaroldItz @JAG_atthebeach All that class and fries too, ehh, son? Donald your mother literally rolled over in her grave today. She wouldn't feed that crap to your step-son Barron. Then again she used to feed Don Jr cat food when we would baby sit him when he was 3, which explains a lot.

@funder @realDonaldTrump Technically that idiot son of mine isn't making a deal for Russian money. I taught him one thing and that's too deal in Swiss francs. It's the only thing he's listened to so far and I can promise you it's Swiss money... From a Russian guy.
@CNN Morons! If you don't stop my kid as a team he'll abolish your office soon and the Appalachian Hill billies are going to help him do it. Don't kid yourself, my son's received specific instructions from his wife's boss, Vlad. I'm counting on you!
@rawbanana88 @ProudResister I don't know if this is important but Melania talks to a guy named Vlad on burner phones and getting instructions on what my boy should do next. Everyone is so busy watching him, whose watching this woman? Maybe they should have a witch hunt for this squinty eyed harpy.
@Avid_Maddow_Fan How dare you insist my mutton headed son isn't a vegetable himself? Look at that fat gut! He looks like a human tomato! Donald, what is that orange business all over your skin? Have you been playing in mother's makeup again?
@HawkeyePacker81 @maxywon @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl Normally I'd argue that title belongs to my son and grandson, Donny and Don Jr. These two bozos look like they just stepped out of a Vegas casino and not a classy one on the strip but one of the off strip dumps my kid picks up bags of coke and cheap hooker's from.
@SamuelA71459883 I can't argue against that idea, Samuel. I was thinking that we could smear Jack black from head to toe with some carrot colored food dye, fatten him up with 80lbs of KFC and keep him stoned during every scene in order to play Donny. He will still be too smart in that state.

@CNN This is my fault. I thought letting Don eat as much of this crap as he liked in his college years that he would get diabetes and miss VietNam. Didn't know how long it took to get type 2 eating this crap I'm sure he has it know. I did get my podiatrist to help him skip the draft

@DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Grandson, how many parents of school shootings (I call them "Murdered by MAGA parents") have been booked on Fox? Just wondering Don Jr. BTW Wipe that grease out of your hair. You look as foolish as your father did in '86 when he wore extra pomade for his interview w @DanRather
GREAT ZEUS! Who IS this walking corpse of a woman Donny? You brag to me in your bed time prayers about all the hot women you're banging and that you are surrounded by. If this is one of them you need your eyes examined. Son, I think I just saw her eat a raw infant liver.. https://t.co/M0a0JfgqRE
@TravisAllen02 @shannongalloway #ImpeachMyIdiotSon
@briantylercohen @BlindMelon1967 Mary and I greatest regret is letting Donald grow up eating that garbage in NYC. We had access to private chefs but most of the time Donald would request junk food like this and they would go get it for him we should have fired them!
@danacarvey #bunchafuckunbullshit
@SocialPowerOne1 @bully4me16 This guy looks like the living scarecrow from the wizard of Oz. Seems like he's got a brain made of straw getting mixed up with my idiot son Donald. That's career suicide! Someone get this guy some help before he hurts himself.
@RF_P0TUS @LynneGarrison Meghan is right. My son IS too dumb to be a spy, but Ivanka the terrible and Melania the quiet harpy aren't. You can bet that my moron son is just a mark designated in the long game by Melania who manages him via her connection with her boss Vlad. She's a smart cookie. Don, no.
@krassenstein @bully4me16 Great Scott! This IS good news. If my son impregnated one more woman the seventh seal was going to break and end the world as we know it.
@itsJeffTiedrich @bully4me16 @realDonaldTrump Jeff, my son can't actually tell time, and they actually had him call the local gyro delivery shop. Close enough to being Erdogan for Donny and at this point we don't want to confuse him more than he already is. On that note you should come over we have extra schwarma. And chips.
@goldengateblond @LynneGarrison My idiot son has a 12 year old son? Donny what are you 72 now? You mean you actually believe you fathered that kid at 60? Donny. No way that kid is yours. Besides being able to read, I hear he can put together coherent sentences. Nice kid, but he ain't yours Donny.
@LouDobbs @Burns95085638 Morons! This should read, do you think Donald Trump should Rob the military budget which is used over seas to defend US assets and citizens to build my dumb sons fantasy castle wall and moat and at the same time  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it?
@thehill @Burns95085638 Donny, you moron, never tell at your employees in public! How many times have I told you do that in the backroom. No one will work for you if you keep this up.
@realDonaldTrump Donald why do you keep pandering to those backwards hillbillies? They don't buy our hotels!
WHAT AN IDIOT!  I always thought you were the dumbest of my children but you really proved it today, Donny Dum Dum. https://t.co/xtOCLLiRsO
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Donald, someone has to clean up after the hurricane. And those guys at Fox aren't your friends, they're just using you. They think you're a mark. I thought I taught you to find the marks not to be one, dum dum.
@bemason9 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi And then the rest of your pay will go right back to my son Donny, to build the wall you are going to pay for.
@AuthorTSTJames The Munsters scare you?
@dcrenmama @timkaine How about we offer them amnesty, tax their paychecks, use the tax from their checks to build a wall, then the mexican really do pay for the wall?
@dcrenmama @MarkWarner So my son Donny can fire all the Hispanic border patrol agents? Good! Trump hotels needs someone to hire to replace all the illegals that idiot son of mine just deported. Tell me what idiot deports half of his lowest wage working staff?
@19usandlotbeast I used to have a secretary that typed like you. Her caps lock key wasn't stuck she just had a defect in her brain that made her think that people could read and understand all capitals better than proper punctuation. I found her extremely annoying &amp; only kept her 4 her naw-naws
@bryce_edward 306, 4124, 938
@bjcreigh My money is also on half-wit. My Donny always had been light on the brain power and heavy on the lip service. His mouth operates 3x fatter than his brain can think. No way he orchestrated a great plan to infiltrated the US. He stumbled on this accidently.
@essenviews @averagejousa Lambchops here reminds me of a kid I used to hire in the late 60s to help clear out some California property ownership "issues". He was obsessed with the zodiac. A little fatter than that kid was.
@KassandraSeven @bully4me16 @tedcruz @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @SteveKingIA My idiot of a grandson Don Jr could use a good tongue lashing. And who the hell is this Barron kid? Are we sure he's a Trump? Why would Melania actually let Donny impregnate her is beyond me. Oh wait. Maybe he's Don Jrs. He always did have a step mom fetish.
@realDonaldTrump Donny. Son. You need to resign. It's for your own good. Your mother's worried about you. You've gotten so fat. You talk gibberish. You cite things that don't exist. Your wife is showering with one secret service agent, sleeping with another. Your son Don Jr is the Russians $280m
@realDonaldTrump #ImpeachMySon
@realDonaldTrump Jesus, Donny, are there even that many people in Mexico?
@realDonaldTrump Donny, you have always been the worst salesman I've ever known. You're making it sounds like you already have the border will guarded and preventing millions of bad guys from crossing it. You're supposed to make it sound like you aren't stopping any of the bad guys, dum dum.
@realDonaldTrump Speaking of being there, where's Melania this week, Donny? Not that I've been watching her shower but when you watch from... The afterlife you can see everything. And she doesn't shower alone. I'm not judging son, you crazy kids do your thing. It's just he's there when you aren't
@chrislhayes you certainly are a tall, handsome man.
@chrislhayes Great Scott! I haven't seen lamb chops on a man like that since Fred Ackerman showed up to the NYC building authority New year's Eve mixer in 1940 looking like Howard Taft. On a side note that kid looks a lot like a fatter older version of the zodiac killer.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I told Donald not to call him Schitt. But Donald doesn't listen worth a Schiff. 		See what I did there?
@PalmerReport My son is no where smart enough to be a spy. He is however, dumb enough to get suckered into what he thinks is a great deal where he's going to rip the other guy off when in reality he's getting the screws put to him &amp; everyone around him. What idiot voted to put him in charge?
@realDonaldTrFan @Beaufort_Gage If I didn't know better, I'd say this really was tweeted by my son. It certainly sounds whiney enough to be his material.
@realDonaldTrump Sometimes I think I should have pulled out. Your mother does too. She also says to tell you not to be so numpty, Donny.
Oh my grandson and the slicked back Guido haircut. It looks like the kind of crap his dad would encourage. Jr, are you using vegetable oil for that coif? Do you want to end up like your father? Look at that ragged mess of corpse hair on his head. Consult a stylist grandson. https://t.co/wZ06rMtk7q
@Brasilmagic Probably Donny's penis. When he was born the doctor recommended we skip the circumcision, or there wouldn't be much left. Mary, his mother being a Scottish Catholic agreed. Never the less there isn't a whole lot that couldn't be hidden behind a peanut shell in Donny's shorts.
@CatEarthSociety @realDonaldTrump I was going to say something similar but you seem to have put it together rather poignantly, so I will instead refer to your tweet today.
@amyklobuchar @Beaufort_Gage If you see my son, throw snow down the back of his shirt and tell him I said to quit whining and start working.
@realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne didn't you get fired for this kind of tweet?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Seriously though, how is it that Twitter doesn't force him to take this down as a racist hate tweet? Doesn't anyone hit the report button?
@realDonaldTrump Donny just don't let anyone know we're Germans, in NYC that isn't good for business, remember we tell everyone that were swedes! We're from Sweden. Remember Donny, we're only secretly Germans, but we pretend were swedish!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Son, why are you keeping ILLEGAL ALIEN CHILD molesters in jail, instead of deporting THEM? Don't you have a bunch of ICE guys running around deporting people? Deport the molesters, Donny! Use your head for more than a place to hang those awful red hats!
JESUS who is this guy? Why does he get Disney so wound up? Every time he tweets Walt wets himself and threatens to climb back into his cryo chamber https://t.co/V5mwnEJhMm
If you had half a pound of horse sense Donald you would have bought Amazon back in '95 like I suggested &amp; saved yourself the press, of course you accused me of having Alzheimer's. Oh, who am I kidding, if you bought it you would have run it into bankruptcy by the time I died. https://t.co/RCQP7aWBTf
@Alt_FedEmployee @LynneGarrison That would be a pretty good way of describing my son, who was in the back of the room when god was handing out brains. He's lost his damned mind. Trump hotels employes thousands of illegals. Do you have any idea of how much we make on pocketing the SS tax we fake withhold?
When she was little I would tease her and call her Ivanka the terrible. Of course she was the smartest of Donny's kids in that she could read and speak in complete sentences before she was twelve. I owe Disney $50 - never thought she'd marry this scumbag but Walt called it. https://t.co/gkrzXTIt1N
Instead this idiot bribes the Russian authorities. That's the wrong jurisdiction. Donald, I thought I taught you better. If I did, your kid must have fallen down and banged his head and forgotten everything I ever taught any of you.
I'm not sure I want to admit this idiot is my grandson. Part of the reason he isn't taking a vacation is that the authorities have asked him to let them know when he leaves town. Back in my day that meant it was time to bribe the local s authorities. https://t.co/UUtpe9bpyG

Oh, my dear son, Donny. It's no wonder you failed geography and I had to bribe your teacher with $50k and a new Buick to pass you in 11th and then a Cadillac in 12th grade. The good Lord knows your mother and I couldn't take an extra year of you in high school. https://t.co/LEY2zTyOIz

Jesus your tweets sound whinier then your letters home to mother when you were off at military school Donald. Always crying how the other kids had better uniforms or sports gear than you, or a nicer car. How many times did I tell you to quit whining and be a man, Donny? https://t.co/82jk1K0X9K
Donald, my son. You are such an idiot sometimes. The little thing in your hands that you tweet with? Your phone? Yeah that thing has a camera but into it, perfect for sharing pictures of the snow covered Rose garden. Donny, look! Your mom is crying! Now look what you've done! https://t.co/BisCv3DJQC

Donald, I gave you $100 million dollars to start your empire. You should be worth trillions by now. Instead you cowtow to the tiny little Russian prick that owes me money for financing his overthow of Gorbachev when Bush was in the office. Son, how did you mess that one up?

@latwonwash @CNNTonight @VelvetBooger Murder and rape are state laws. So you let those go? Sounds like a Trump supporter.
