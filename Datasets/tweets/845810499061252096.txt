@callmewillc @FightBackBR You're going to have to give me credit for my own intelligence and curiosity and trust me to do ample research on my own.
@callmewillc @FightBackBR I read these articles already and can't re-access them because I won't give the NYT my money. But they didn't convince me remotely, they weren't detailed enough, and I've been cross-referencing to publications going years back instead of retrospective summaries.
@callmewillc @FightBackBR I'm reading outwards from the question, "DID SHE REFORM THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT FAIRER AND MORE PROGRESSIVE?"	So far (not very far yet) I'm finding that in fact she did. I'm finding some fault but on balance, not outweighing the progress.
@callmewillc @FightBackBR Again, we're on Twitter and these are just "boom boom boom" simplistic points without details. I've been reading extensively for a week, pages upon pages dating back a decade. She didn't "stand for" any of these things.
@errollouis https://t.co/5LJu2ycKqO	cc: @504Dems
@kaoconnor @errollouis Has been for decades. Nothing changes.
The 504 Club has only been talking about it for YEARS and it's tragic that people with disabilities are commonly an afterthought.	Here's advocacy from a few wks ago:		https://t.co/atSo8ibbNz		@exenezoom talks about it CONSTANTLY		#ADA #CripTheVote #accessibility https://t.co/RNx1PAyvDl
@FightBackBR @callmewillc It appears to me that the program helped overwhelmingly to keep people OUT of the system.		https://t.co/B4FY2MWstx
@callmewillc @FightBackBR Take a few minutes to research, as I did. All your questions will be answered.	It seems that reports going back over a decade are still readily available through a Google.
@FightBackBR @callmewillc And as I understand the program, it was elementary school students. I'm still digging into the background, but I have found a lot of generalizations on Twitter that don't match the finer details at all and just allow "Kamala is a cop" narratives to proliferate.
@FightBackBR @callmewillc There were exactly TWO parents prosecuted under the truancy program; all families got services that were needed to help address the root causes of truancy, which were beyond the capacity for ACS but able to be boosted with the AG budget.
RT @MeCookieMonster: Cowabunga! Me look fantastic! #10YearChallenge https://t.co/DIwcMMZio1
@Mike___Weaver @RepMaxRose Everyone within the geographic area is a constituent.
@callmewillc Again, it's Twitter. Everything is abbreviated.	So I'll pick just one:	How many parents did she prosecute for truancy? And why is it NOT progressive to get chronically absent (unexcused) children to school? Is it progressive to leave those kids neglected?
@callmewillc *five other things
@callmewillc This is bigger than a tweet.	But you took a 1.5 minute clip where she actually is direct about answering a question and are criticizing that she didn't add fine other things that YOU want her to talk about.
@callmewillc Bullshit. She answered it extensively. 	I will push back against this narrative.	It's a planted bit of propaganda I'm seeing word for word relayed by you &amp;others.	I am a critical, nitpicking person who will not hesitate to point out flaws and transgressions.	THIS AIN'T ACCURATE.

@MomsThoughts @melissarvh All true. 	Also, take the "grade 2" and throw the concept out the window.	There's no metric of how you're doing better than your OWN sense of how you're doing.		If your first goal is to keep it from worsening, you already are on the right track for help!
@melissarvh @MomsThoughts Indeed, Melissa! You're a trusted resource, esp as you advocate how different we all are with GP.	I, for example, fare much worse with liquids than solids.		#FODMAP avoidance had helped me greatly, and @KateScarlata_RD has been a lifesaver dietitian for me.
@MomsThoughts Start with Melissa VanHouten @melissarvh and I'll gather a few other resources too.
