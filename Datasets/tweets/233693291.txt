Non-scientific ESA regulations impede economic growth across the country, including Arkansas. In 2014, I introduced the Common Sense in Species Protection Act. @NatResources Chairman Emeritus @DocHastings held a field hearing in Batesville over regulatory abuse in Arkansas.
The letter of the law states that for an area to be ‚Äúcritical habitat,‚Äù it must first be a ‚Äúhabitat.‚Äù SCOTUS‚Äôs ruling affirms that @USFWS was abusing its regulatory power and its rulemaking was not grounded in statutory law. #ESA
There is no reason for @USFWS to hamper the economy by placing restrictions on areas where endangered species do not and cannot live without substantial alterations. #ESA

@djchlapecka @DinadesalvoA @realDonaldTrump Oh, and last item of note. You or anyone can text me at 870-292-6747. I‚Äôll get back as quick as I can. Over 1800 constituents are active talking to me there and I really enjoy the discussions we have.
@djchlapecka @realDonaldTrump I also seek to visit with folks when I‚Äôm at home and do so often. I‚Äôve been in Stuttgart today visiting with people and was in Batesville earlier this week. It takes people talking about issues and sharing their perspectives.
@djchlapecka @realDonaldTrump Thank you for the question, Jordan. I‚Äôve taken a lot of steps towards connecting with my constituents that works best for them - like my texting service. Folks can text me and engage in a non-monetized way like Facebook and discuss issues.
That other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, ATF, and others, used to pinpoint this person in their investigation. As @realDonaldTrump said a short time ago, these actions have no place in America and must end.

The perpetrators should be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for what they have done ‚Äì and we can all be thankful that our Bomb Squad/EOD experts are right there, helping out in our communities across the country. (End)
These men and women are absolute experts and are who we want at these scenes/in these situations when called for. They are going to be able to assist any/all law enforcement agencies with granular data to catch the person(s) who have done this
It is my hope that when things like this happen, we will remember those who get these calls, that they are heading full steam ahead to the threat, hoping to render it inert, diffuse it, or, if called for, detonate without any possible collateral damage.
May be dealing with.  They can also put on significant protective gear to guard themselves against a blast that would otherwise harm or potentially cause fatal injuries (see my previous tweets for pictures of these two examples)
Depending on the description of the device and even if there isn‚Äôt much of a description, they can now deploy robotic equipment that can go inside to a scene/location and provide live video of what they...
These experts who get these calls have a multitude of tools and resources now to assess the scene/device, more so than when I would join local law enforcement many years ago. We would have to get "eyes" on it directly to proceed
We had to do all we could to ensure the least amount of harm possible to civilians and our unit as we assessed the device and what needed to be done. Initial Success, or Total Failure
When I got called for different circumstances/situations, we had to determine what kind of device we were dealing with, its potential for harm, and how to secure the area around the device/munition
There is no consideration for any other factor when they get the call about a device other than to determine what they are dealing with and what the immediate next steps should be to prevent harm/injuries
The slogan we operated by in my unit was ‚ÄúInitial Success or Total Failure‚Äù and that is exactly what these individuals think of when they get the call of an IED/or explosive device
Quite literally ‚Äì they are trained to handle a bomb of ANY kind and what to do with that device in the circumstances that they find it in and determine what to do accordingly
All of these men and women who are a part of the bomb squads/bomb disposal units who get these calls are some of the best trained and are experts in how to handle a bomb of any kind, in any situation
As a former bomb disposal technician, I wanted to share some personal insight about what goes on in situations like we have seen the last few days based on my own previous experience (Thread)

I will be on @IngrahamAngle tonight at 9 pm (CT) talking about the explosive devices being discovered across the nation. Be sure to tune in to hear my thoughts and perspective as a former Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist.
I expect that our law enforcement will conduct a rigorous investigation into these explosive devices and I am confident that they will find the perpetrator. I have the utmost respect for our 21st century bomb techs on all levels, they are well trained &amp; have advanced technology.
@realjimrussell @toddstarnes It exacerbates the problem by creating a potentially poisonous powder to go airborne rather than it being contained in an envelope.
This afternoon I spoke with @toddstarnes about the advanced training and technology that our nation's bomb techs have access to. Here are a few photos of some of the gear we might see them use to respond to the bombs we've been hearing about in today's news. #Bombings https://t.co/keOZSTNXhA
This type of act is condemnable and it not consistent with our values as Americans. We now need to look to our law enforcement community to investigate motives and I know that they will do so very thoroughly. #Bombings -Live on @toddstarnes
Based on the pictures I've seen, it looks like a very elementary basic pipe bomb. However, it looks like it was accompanied by an envelope of white powder which would've really caused even more of a problem had the bomb detonated. - Live on @toddstarnes
The evidence is going to be speculated and that's human nature. But even if it's a hoax you don't ever leave anything to chance and you have to assume that it's a live device -Live on @toddstarnes #Bombings
I‚Äôll be joining @toddstarnes in a few minutes to talk about the explosive devices being found across the country. These acts of terrorism are despicable and we will find who sent them and bring them to justice.

I fully support President and Speaker Ryan's decision to take additional time to get health care reform right instead of right now. #AHCA
Big gov. under Republicans = big gov. under Democrats. With WH, Senate, and House, why aren't we using this chance for full repeal? #AHCA
#ACHA is not the repeal conservatives have called for, the tax credit creates a new entitlement program when we're $20 trillion in debt.
