8/Corps dropped the NRA in less than 2 weeks b/c we told them we weren't gonna give them our money until they did. If Noam wants to hide behind free speech so he doesn't have to make a decision then we have to use the highest form of free speech in protest: withhold our money.
7/You want the Cellar to take a position on CK? Don't go there, don't perform there, don't drink there. Noam isn't going to do the right thing on his own.
6/You say you're for workplace safety and think you're a hero for not allowing shoulder rubs, but you let a comedian who has has ADMITTED to exposing himself and masturbating in front of women in the same room as your employees &amp; customers, you're complicit.
5/You let your friends say sexist &amp; racist shit, you're complicit. You say you want pay parity &amp; work equality, but do nothing to employ women &amp; POC, you're complicit. You say you're for gun safety, but give perks to the NRA, you're complicit.
4/You are the company you keep. You are the people &amp; businesses you give your money to. You are the people and the rhetoric you give a platform to. No lives, no one's safety matters until they costs those in power money and their reputations.
3/Men say that they know what the right thing to do is, but they have no idea HOW to do the right thing. They will hide behind free speech and the free market rather than do the hard, messy work of living up to the responsibility that comes with power.
2/Most men in power will never experience the abuse and violence that POC, women and children face and they have never been given any reason to develop the principles, moral courage or basic empathy to know how to stand up and do the right thing for anyone else other themselves.
1/My answer to Louis CK allowed at the Comedy Cellar is the same answer I have about the Griffin allowing the Proud Boys in, the Catholic Church, Trump, family separations, police violence, guns and Twitter not banning Alex Jones.
So the owner of the Comedy Cellar doesn't allow employee shoulder rubs, but is having a tough time deciding if he should let his employees &amp; customers  be in the same room with a guy who has ADMITTED to using his places of work to prey on women. 	https://t.co/MhzgzHNM7l

The 50 who take their own lives by firearms every day are teens,parents, spouses, grandparent &amp; friends. Their names aren‚Äôt on handbags or TV shows &amp; their deaths will never be covered by the news. They die by having easy access to a permanent solution to their pain. They matter.
It‚Äôs very easy for us to pay attention when there‚Äôs a mass or  school shooting. Every single day over 90 people die from gun violence. Over 50 of those deaths are suicide by firearm. Every single day.  https://t.co/Bj5ThatmDp
