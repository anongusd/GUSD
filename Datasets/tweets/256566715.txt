Each time I'm praying and hustling for money, I pray that my friend is doing the same, because I wanna see them win, and make money too, I don't wanna be that guy with money, when my friends are broke. May we all win and make money together.
Its very important to make friendship that is deeper than gossiping, slaying, drinking, smoking &amp; hanging out. Make friends u can run to in times of financial % emotional needs. Make friends that can support your life goals &amp; make u a better. friends can spoil or beautify ur life
We smile and walk away..... 	We make the prisoners of their own conscience

Don’t try to fast-forward yourself into a future you haven’t yet earned or aren’t yet ready for.
Make someone happy today. Do a good deed. Be kind, even to a stranger. Spread goodness. Smile. Do whatever it takes. Just do it. Happiness never decreases by being shared. Let us spread it far and wide!

You’ll reach that point in life that you do not expect people to do the same to you. It is when you understand that someone is never meant for you. It is when you grasp the idea that someone’s love for you  is not meant to last. It is called MATURITY.
Pray and let God, be God.
Just because someone smiles always doesn’t mean his life is perfect. It’s a sign of faith, hope and strength. It’s a sign that yes, nothing lasts and things will get better. The Almighty is with us every step of the way. Satan will make you doubt that. Don’t!

Don't run after those who’ve left you. Don’t be distracted by their departure. They’re gone for a reason. They have served their purpose. It’s part of the Almighty’s plans to bring new people into your life. He’s worked it all out so just go with the flow.
Remember, you don’t need people’s approval to be happy. If they have issues with you, it’s not about you, it’s about their insecurities. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Let it go or you’ll end up frustrated. Get your approval from the Almighty.

The biggest regret that people have on their deathbed is that they lived the life expected of them instead of a life true to themselves.
Sometimes you have to let go and see what happens.
The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence.
Women are better at remembering pretty girls' faces because they are seen as potential threats.
Your mind is like the most powerful horse on the planet. If you can control it, you are sure to win every race in life.
Find someone who wants to invest in you, learn from you, see you win, support your visions and fall in love with u daily#billionairesmindset
Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy
It's not about having the perfect relationship. It's about finding someone who matches you and will go through everything without giving up.
RT @Fact: Sometimes you have to walk away from people, not because you don't care, but because they don't.
Always tell someone how you feel because opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye, but regret can last a lifetime.
Maturity is when you keep your mouth shut when you want to say something mean to someone. Only people at peace with themselves can do this.
Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them.

We are so detached from reality, holding on to our much misguided filial loyalties...
Loving someone you don't see everyday is not a bad thing. It's just a proof that love is not in sight but in the heart.

Never jeopardize a good thing for a new thing.
Don't ever be afraid to show who you really are, because as long as you are happy with yourself, no one else's opinion matters.
You'll never live a happy life if you always care about what others think about you.
Nothing is certain, everything is possible.
Be proud of yourself for how far you have come, and never stop pushing to be the best you can be.

In life nobody wants to know how hard you have worked,its by the results they see, they will celebrate and associate with you.
Tact is the ability to describe others as they see themselves.
