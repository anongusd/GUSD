@LawlzSchool @JurisPettiness It used to drive me crazy, not because she was able to focus only on school, I would’ve seized that opportunity, but bc she would be insanely jealous that I somehow held it together with a part time job on weekends, a workout schedule and a bf 🤦🏼‍♀️ not my fault I ran a circus
@katesquire I shop online like an over-caffeinated wild woman 🙈 I mean true 💁🏼‍♀️
@LawlzSchool @JurisPettiness She used to try to tell me that school kept her to busy to go to the gym, clean anything (incl dishes) or do anything but homework so she couldn’t work or do anything but study and sleep. It was tough
@LawlzSchool @JurisPettiness Her mother would would clean the apartment and if I left anything out she’d go in my room, whether I was there or not to put it “where it belongs.” Out toilet used to clog for absolutely no reason (we didn’t even have to use it) and she refused to fix it (bc ew gross)
@LawlzSchool @JurisPettiness Last year during my 1L year I lived with another 1L and I thought it would be good because we’d understand what the other was going thro but my goodness she lived in another world.

@sassygirll6102 Girl, I can’t 😩😩
It’s almost 11 so it’s past my bedtime. I could either (1) go to bed w/o bf or (2) wait for him and then go to bed. But in reality, I’m going to (3) wait up for him but fall asleep on the couch and get woken up by him when he gets home from work in an hour and never sleep again
@sassygirll6102 If I called out from work tomorrow, I’d have a 5 day weekend and I’m sooo tempted
This woman on the bus sat next to me (in aisle seat) and I stood up at my stop and said excuse me and she ducked her stomach in instead of standing up. Excuse me but I have a backpack and my tote and 3 textbooks so chances are I’m hitting you with one of these sorry not sorry

@AshaRangappa_ Maternal grandparents met in grade school, started dating at 12 (😳), married at 18, had 5 kids (1 boy then 4 girls). Paternal grandparents also met in school married, had 5 kids (4 boys and 1 girl). They then moved to same town as my mother
@AshaRangappa_ #ImmigrantStories Maternal gf immigrated at 2yo from Canada, maternal gm immigrated from Ireland at 3 months old. Both arrived in same town, same year. Never moved away. Paternal gf immigrated to Chicago from Lithuania at 6 years old. Gm was born in Chicago.

@_EMMinem Thank you for saying that! I’m certainly not complaining about being pushed but I’m constantly on edge that I’m doing something wrong and that is not teaching me anything. I want to learn, improve but I can’t when they take projects away from me and call me stupid constantly
I should clarify I’ve worked at 4 different firms during undergrad. I graduated college summa cum laude with 2 majors. I’m not entirely incompetent. But to have my boss take assignments away from me for asking a simple clarifying question because I’ll “fuck it up anyways” is 👎🏻

@lawstudent86 My torts law exam was so wild I included torts law, property law, and criminal law in it because he spent so much time talking about the “intersectionality of the 1L courses” all semester 😰😰
RT @lawstudent86: THIS IS ME CURRENTLY https://t.co/LUjlDmv7hA
@inPari_Passu I mean she got the answer she wanted. We found a way to help her. And I asked J if any of mistakes were accidentally offensive or insulting, but they weren’t so I don’t understand what upset her so much that she had to yell at both of us??
Later when I talked to my boyfriend about it he was upset, but remained calm. This happens to him whenever he speaks English incorrectly. We should not be dissuading or discouraging non-native speakers from learning, trying, and inevitably making mistakes along the way
She started yelling at him for being with a “gringa estúpida” and that he should know better. She hung up the phone. Then she yelled at me that I shouldn’t speak Spanish if I didn’t know what I was saying. I was mortified
I tried to explain that my boyfriend is teaching me and I’ve only just started to learn. But I’m on the phone with him, why don’t you ask him? She agreed so I disconnected my headphones and gave her my phone. He helped her choice the correct spice. Then she went OFF
I took out one of my headphones. She asked me, in Spanish, something about two different spices she had in her hand. I didn’t understand entirely what she was asking (again, I’m learning). She told me, in Spanish, that she asked me because she heard me speak Spanish
We get dirty looks and questions constantly. But today a woman at the grocery store yelled at me for not being a fluent Spanish speaker, but using it regardless. So I was on the phone with my boyfriend with wireless headphones. I was using some Spanish. A woman approached me
Sometimes, we use all 3 in the same sentence. Yes, it’s weird. Yes, we’re annoying. But when we started dating, communication wasn’t our strongest aspect of our relationship if we both relied on only one. I get that it sounds weird to outsiders who don’t know us
So here’s the thing- Spanish is my boyfriend’s first language and therefore he is most comfortable speaking in Spanish. I am trying to learn and every time I know how to say something in Spanish, I do so lines don’t get crossed. (We both speak English and french also)

So today I learned how to bike by myself and made some doggo friends 👌🏻
I start heading back the way I came. I never found him but was able to get myself home. He was waiting at home
So I played with the dogs for a few minutes. Then I decided to be on my way. Ya know, try to find my dad /10
So the dogs are jumping all over me. Normally I don't like other people's dogs but these were little baby doggos and they were hella cute /9
I start to panic. Then dogs start barking. So I stop, unclip. Get off my bike cause I don't want them coming after me while I'm clipped in 8
I come to a dead end in the road. Dad isn't there. Remember, I'm clipped in and at least 20 miles from home. No phone. No gps /7
Didn't know what to do but went straight. He never takes a turn without my knowing and the left of the fork was more pronounced /6
Normally I lead, but today I didn't. Just my dad and I. He got way far ahead of me. Couldn't see him and came to a fork in the road /5
Ever since then I've been terrified to go alone. Dad (or uncles-all amateur racers) ALWAYS go with me. But they are much faster /4
First time out when I was 15 on an actual race bike I got in horrible accident. Scraped all the skin off my body, concussion, broken ribs /3
I started biking (ya know, clips and spandex, the whole sha bang) when I was 15 (21 now). Dad is amateur racer and thought I would enjoy /2
Alright, storytime. This is about how I got lost while biking close to 20 miles away from home today /1
