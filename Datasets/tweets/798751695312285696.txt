How do I say to my friend, “Biotch, your-drunk-txt, please. I just finished sending my crush a bagillion posted letters… to his job. How you gonna tell me about a drunk text? I did that shiot sober AF.”		We all need a little star boost in our life.		This is why I turn to blog.

Saturdays, humph!) saying I wouldn’t be writing to Ossifer JK anymore.		That said, I do have oneeeee postcard on standby, just so when I mail all subsequent letters directly to the LP city USPS holding, then he had be made aware via postcard “Pick up further love letters at…”
I refuse to talk to the officer, only leave voicemails. I tell him, you love me, I will love you forever, come find me in Fairfield.		I do this. And I don’t stop.		I actually just pretended to stop, by leaving the Station a Saturday voicemail (no detective of mine works
and think about this ‘Golden Eyes’ police officer. Better get cracking and tell the guy.”		So I do. I send him one letter. I send him fifteen more letters. I fill out a journal, and I fill out sheets of paper and shove all this into parcel envelopes. I do this. I call the station
Oh yeah, state your case Stellllla. My god. Here’s me, a year plus ago, about-to-pop-pregnant, and this Ossifer JK shoots golden light out of his face. A year later, and I’m all: “I’m STILL madly, obsessively in love with this guy. All I do is eat, sleep, date my boyfriend,
and I did it all by sending the parcels to his job. *drum roll please* And he is a police officer.		Ninja, I can’t even buy herb from my buddy any more because of this love i have for a police officer.
and words about my favorite study subjects, lists of words copied out of a thesaurus [what?! i just wanted him to enjoy my handwriting], song lyrics, and a whole act from one of Shakespeare’s plays: I poured out my soul to a man via post
To correlate embarrassments, I can barely begin: since the end of April, I had been steadily sending my Crush letters via the USPS. More than thirty letters, I can imagine; and more so:  everything from letters, drawings, a journal (or two) full of maps and charts and graphs
her bravery as a woman to make it in the industry of patriarchy will force over money, and I love her concern.		When she reached out this morning, she was mortified. Her Cinco De Mayo gal pal had snagged my friend’s phone and began texting The Crush.
May 6, 2018		I am love freak, but I don’t lament it.		We all need a little star boost in our life.		This is why I turn to blog.		Because I love my friend. I love her. I love her compassion towards the world,

The thing is, even though we (I) do this, I don't want it acknowledged, just shouts in the void, for this vaper breath is but a moment, and I AM but a lifetime looking for the lifeline to save humanity, again.
Like the sword of Damocles, the denunciation of contamination is yet the menacing foreboding... mundane souls making noise in the void, of which, I will be recipient, but hardly enough reciprocate.

Neither we nor he nor I have handlers, so we will handle situations better when handlebars and mustache rides are motor bikes and mutton chops in the 1800s life; as for the 21st century, I say draw the finish line, turn around, and head back,
Because even soft parts are hardware when got hard is me. He will rise, madam, lady, sisters, for me, when his molecular structure stands with the standing up for me, he and all of thee.
Golden eyes, a pregnant woman’s hallucination, and I’m still waiting to understand how optical nerves firing – prepared by He – will only allow me to wait until his synapses, brain’s software, fires towards me – oh telepathy!
Platitudes; Attitudes: platypus ponds or platinum mines on Pluto’s atlas? 	I try. I fly. I die daily, loving the stripes earned and stars in my stargazer eyes. I do not lie: I simply wait, allowing the truth to manifest and permeate.
You may allocate: try!	You may designate: fly!	You may evaporate: die!	Yet eternity, realize, is still each our own choice, and even ever mistake begins and ends continually, continuously perfection is attained in each of us exponentially.
and should more Noble pursuits grant you Mercy and be an Eastern prayer, that is better than fine by me. Shiva, Brahma, Ashram; allow me esoteric theosophy! To each their own form of unity! No ownership of knowledge and the Spirit of Wisdom, so long as all are made free.
STRIPES AND STARGAZERS	PART IV	Eternity realize is not “old/new and part three;” it is ALL words, frequencies, testaments and testimonies: held accountable for all paired individuals, exponentially! See, go forth and be fruitful is only applicable if you “shall taste and see;”

And by the way father I'm sorry I asked for your help on the apartment but look now Tiffini is using my Twitter to prove that you should continue to ignore your daughter didn't this mess start with livejournal at age 16
Cuz don't you think it's a little hypocritical to tell me I don't deserve to live near my son or that I haven't proved myself worthy of even being near my family Tiffini		#cunt
Yo tall guy father is she even up to your belly button I can hardly remember it's been so long that is like sign of serious psychological illnesses on both your parts pair up appropriately weirdos

The Jew b**** halfling is always bitching about what a terrible dad you are but she's kind of the one who made you a terrible dad by allowing you know you and us to grow apart for like a decade since she stepped in the picture

11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.		12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.		13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.		King James Version (KJV)	Public Domain
9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.		10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.		7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.		8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:		4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.		5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew 25:1-13 King James Version (KJV)	25 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.		2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

Sunshine Peace Lily and a Penned Letter
to feature the Host in moments sequestered;	to pay it forward in bursts and sputters;	to love the Lord: His words,	and our use of them.
to articulate the subconscious,	and grasp hold of the fleeting;	to remember authenticity;	to experience the Creator;	to mimic something given	not without but with also.	Why write words?	Why words: redundant, or rewarding?	To sanctify inspiration:	to gather redeemable sources;
Why Write Words	Why write words?	Why words: random, archaic?	To archive- to achieve:	to set in motion the mind;	to exploit vernacular;	to explore capabilities;	to feel the struggle	or the ease enjoyed.	Why write words?	Why words: pathetic, or purposeful?	to quench- to correlate:
there is fulfillment;	when you thrive in fulfillment,	there is peace;	when you stand in peace,	there is perfect love.
Perfect Love	When you receive perfect love,	there is no fear;	when you experience no fear,	there is understanding;	when you submit to understanding;	there is discipline;	when you suffer for discipline,	there is wisdom;	when you labour in wisdom,

2013, young dumb and broken
I too can form	this place	(in your mind):	the creation mimicking	divine exhalation.	And as it is, finally, I am going home.
As it is, this place	is more than words,	yet not, if you have	the courage	to know the Word	formed the worlds	and brought forth	the first light;	and so, if each	atom comprises of Breath,	then maybe if I inhale	deeply,
resounding	this gain, as now,	not just mine,	but here in your mind:	yours, these green floors	of flora, the living	encompassing us;	more made by Him	than we then	I would flee, and go home.
If not for the explicability	of this place	how glorious design	crafted man	to shape the land	into use,	that is:	this place	providing for so many,	yet how easily	it could have never been;	or at least for me,	and my family;	and how easily	obtained;
that is: another	with His mind	shimmering the rays	of love through	optical orbs;	kind eyes	that light up	the night.
As it is, such joy rides	are just that:	inspiring a firing	of synapses	and creativity ensues;	escalated by a fascination	to absorb the details	of existence,	another’s duration,	and feeling relieved	in assurance	of joint beliefs,
together through shared	spirituality, that is:	calling on the same King,	and being of His holy family;	both of us heirs	and joint heirs	with the One who formed	the world	in which we maneuver	then all together, I might go home.
If not for the affinity	of this place	with its cozy lake-side rides	in circles, spilling details	of a life summed up;	as if: each turn	down the lane	of memory	could be explained	in two breaths;	years uttered in moments,	an entire history	on less than	a quarter tank of gas;
I will press on	till this is done,	till His finished work	has begun a new journey	for me with you as company.
that is: no longer	any division, but those	who follow after a singular	decision; to stand	in the name of Adonai	the Lord of Lords	who will never shy	away from the call	of those whom believe;
As it is,	there is work to be done,	between the bouts of fun	company, when even a simple	phrase could change	another’s identity; they no longer	hesitating to tell	a Gospel story,	but being an example	of His Holy love through	one body;
no longer a functioning organism	evolved towards modern humanity,	but a child of the One	whose hands	hold eternity	then II might openly head towards home.
that is: soft words with harsh reality,	pliable in my mouth, carefully	selected, meticulously	sought out through	studying scripture	like a devout scholar;	as if I could holler in the faces	of the spiritually blind, opening	their eyes to see their Maker;
If not for the bipolarity	of this place	which is really just me	and my manic perception,	where I move in frantic	direction, setting a straight course	towards my eternal destination;	purposefully pursuing my Creator	and speaking His voice	with my feminine nature,
choose your side.	#secondComing #whoreOfBabylon #NWO 		@Pontifex  @POTUS @POTUS44 @MichelleObama 	@TheEllenShow @Toastmasters @Eminem	@KensingtonRoyal
As it is,	with visions as clear in my mind	as if: I had read it upon pages	and saw such images sublime,	and while this place,	still from sleeping still,	these words I keep:	to share with you,	who either know such a battle	or are like GMO-fed cattle	waiting for the slaughter:
I moved quickly, swiftly,	East to West, till the expanse	of the world either believed	or died; not even satan	himself could scare me,	for I am in the Lord’s army;	a general, perhaps not,	but a messenger, indeed then	I would be unwise, at this point to leave and	go home.
as this was: the end of days	and I saw ways to keep	fighting; victorious	every time;	I wielded no weapon	sans that of my mouth	and that of my mind;	conquering foes;	even then dead relatives	showed their allegiance;
having seen myself a warrior	with the power	to speak the Truth,	so sure; to instantly	convert, or dismiss	if conversion was denied;	there were only two sides:	Christ or nothingness.	I saw each member	of the human family	either falling away	or standing in bravery,
If not for the (dreams)	of this place	when I had stayed up latest	and yet, rose first;	awakening when slipping	unwillingly away from visions	so surreal:
where our two minds	are one within infinity;	there is a promise	I call the Holy Trinity;	allow me just a little more	of your time; together,	we’re changing your mind.
or	the Kingdom of Heaven, you as God’s son	or daughter;	either way, the new world order	will see to your slaughter;	I implore you:	accept the Father;	enter into His presence	like a child and ask Him	to reveal Himself, anywhere,	anyhow, maybe here:	from the Wild,
dear one,	only repeated sorrow	will any of that bring;	I tell you the truth now; augmentation,	that is: an All Powerful GOD changing you	into His representation;	that is: allowing you to choose	your inheritance:	absolute nonexistence, when death has come,
bring along the storms and hail	of condemnation; look down	your nose if that is your preoccupation;	to remain dead on the inside	for the sake of intellectual	argumentation; boast in yourself,	your abilities and clever schemes,	but I assure you,
-then I would give away my pen without a fuss,	and go home.	As it is, this place	grants me the opportunity	to share my prized possession,	that is: these words	which are my thoughts	conveying belief unshakable;	put away your richter scale,	my hope in Him will	always prevail;
where what has happened is no longer	a memory, but a lesson learned,	all options illuminated, motives	directly revealing every course	of action,	that is: “all things work together for good	to those who love the Lord,	and are called according to His purpose,”
seeking	out always the will divine,	that is: His Holy pursuits	put into action during my prime	and carried out until time	seems to slow,	to stop,	to cease,	until forever is now	and always on
another’s chance	to submerge hot skin	working to save;	but the flesh will always die,	and salvation is not an occupation,	but it is a full-time job, day and night,	not a prayer uttered once,	albeit said in sincerity,	but a life time continually	renewing the mind,
that is: to believe is granted eternity.		If not for the generosity	of this place	the way time has such significance,	in bouts of the flourishing,	between swimming and rest periods;	that blast of a whistle:	the tantalizing scream	of human breath forced	through metal;
a testimony, a promise,	a pact made in blood,	that is: perfection died,	and was risen,	and lives,	to make a new home	for you; because He desires	none to die twice,	yes, may the prison called flesh	fall away, but allow your spirit	with Him to stay with certainty;
As it is,	the divine has its time	through simple ink to shine	on your heart, for if even	one thought has changed,	it was worth it from the start;	that is: to compose	words so compelling	that you start telling	His story too;	where words are His Word	living through you;
because He made me to love,	don’t you see; He made you	to be loved for all eternity then	I would put down this pen,	and head home tonight.
when all will either perish	or become one with the Light;	when it is no longer about religion,	but the decision to follow after	something better than myself,	that is: the One who made me	wants me to recognize his	sovereignty; which is His	right to love me unconditionally;
If not for the spirituality	of this place when	countless stars appear,	reminding me “yes, we’re here,”	when all the while, forgotten	in a mortar and plaster life,	that is: being at home,	in all its man-made delight,	yes the heavens burn bright	telling tales of the end of night
no; not chance, but love divine,	that is: all power residing at the core	of the universe which revolves	around an omnipotent GOD	who gives this to us both;	those things, and this place.
with its opalescent light;	we glow, as we know the certainty	of truth, that is:	One GOD,	One Way,	to make all life make sense,	that is: understanding our purpose;	benevolence granted; each breath	(could you believe it chance?)	organs, and organisms, and orgasms,
somehow, time is made irrelevant,	for something like this can be made	monumental; in that: a purpose	for us both; one to read	and one to write;	as if: we are both consecrated,	as in: you’re here with me tonight;	poised on a dock,	under a three-quarter-full moon
that is: handwriting	pressed into paper,	each new page full of hieroglyphics;	the etchings of words already written	and yet, did you think ahead	to see me back then,	which is now;
for the fruit of my lips is ripe,	and never could this have come	if I were home to type;	words are just words	until you bring them to life,
a granted permission;	to give YOU, dear one	a vision of hope and certainty,	that is: a destination called eternity	then I would put my pen down, and go home	directly.	As it is,	I am here now, blessed entirely;
wherein my humility,	a humble servant, a slave	by choice: this here in silence	is my voice,		because now I am real;	my words: heard, read,	now inside your head,	I become more than myself	because I live not for myself,	but for Him,	and He declares this allowance,
such as these never quite slumber,	but hold tight, quiet	till dusk;	when alone, I must,	with a pen (so foreign,	yet familiar), as if:	relearning the notion	of motions similar:	the grasp, the hold, the pressing stroke	on paper, soft, damp	from humidity;
If not for the clarity	of this place when	alone with moon beams	on my face, I seek	to transcribe	the transcendental,	that is: the moon glowing amber	dimpled and smiling,	that is: the dock underneath	bobbing and throbbing	with the pulse of the night,	when all is asleep, yet sounds
which is: why boast	in the ordinary,	when you could look up	and realize the extraordinary	is calling you	to this place:	where you see yourself	whole, without blemish,	sanctified in love	and ready to fulfill your purpose
I could mock the world	back home,	where what is made known	seems more shallow than the waters	before me, where I could dive	until my ears burst in cold	and still come closer to truth	within the depths of	clay murk;
As it is, this place,	full of mystique;	in that: no television screen	can project such honesty	as the night breeze	over a still pond, right	here on this dock:
as if: routing the way by fore-arm designs,	that is: knowing how best to speak,	to soothe, to say the words of love	resounding within my mind then	I would shove myself back home.
that is: as wild as bare feet and shoulders,	both sun-kissed, freckled;	those marks of not just hours	at play, but constellations	of my own boasting; an astronomy	upon my skin, a celestial map	atop my body,
If not for the scarcity	of this place remote,	farm-encompassed,	off a series of highways,	down country roads,	yes, even gravel kicked up	against tires known for traveling	repetitive routes, now breaking free;	a caravan carting us into the wild,	where summers are spent uninhibited
and then my blood	in a winged body	spread across these pages,	as if: our spirit never ages	but becomes more in tuned	to the one who grooms us	for victory;	that is: conquering all fear	and mortal uncertainty.
As it is, bug guts	in my ink; the humidity	so thick I could sink my teeth	into the air:	like crab apples	plucked from a tree	planted in memory of	a sleeping saint;	the smear of an earthly	life now over,	the nectar:	and then the drip,	the taste, death giving life	to my lips;
just blurred lines by the refined	light of the sun bouncing off our moon,	to shine on this page,	else dying (which is: not trying);	where bullfrogs and lark	chant a chorus in the night 	then I would take flight, and go home.
If not for the hilarity	of this place	where spiders weave webs	large enough to capture my whole body	as if: effortlessly ensnaring the haphazard	and yet I know the work,	the labor, the toil,	just to eat a bite,	else dying;	where I write by moonlight	words scrawled across a page,
just an attitude of altitude	of adherence to the laws	written upon the heart;	where the Source of the start	concludes His finished work in me.
as it is: there is an ease	about dedication;	as if: one could reach the clouds	in supple strides,	to hide among the heavens,	where even drone planes cannot see;	at last, free to move, to breathe about	without fear; perseverance:
As it is,	there is a charm about being	isolated from the consistent whirl	and buzz of constant corporation;	while here, in	this place, there is moderation;	that is: a sensation to clear	the senses, and be yourself	entirely free of expectation;
that is: air pumped out sucks in	my productivity: to compose,	certainly, this epic explanation	of a summer home vacation then	without any hesitation, I would go home.
as if: anything unnatural	could be toxin to my chi;	as if: the AC could drain me	of my energy; hot potentiality	need not be cooled;
If not for the memory	of this place	with metal swings	echoing a to-fro song,	and slides white-hot	burning as you go along	down, sweet sweat	dripping	albeit, better than	sitting any where	claustrophobically cool;
{{BE HERE}}
that is; the doing away	of evil, till all existence is pure;	as if death were an illness,	His name is the cure.
join me here,	in this place,	upon the straight path;	that is: knowing we are	to be like Him, a brethren	of Heaven, a royal family;	and like this place,	protected from every	form of animosity;
how indeed I strive to say,	obey the Holy, Holy, Holy One,	who reigns on high, who came	as His Son; to live, to die, to rise	into the sky	and unto His throne,	where there alone now,	He sits to speak, to plea	on our behalf,	to help the world evade	His Father’s wrath;
As it is, I mock not those	who sink their toes into the sand,	transformed by His hand,	to achieve His plan;	else the wrath of disbelief	would surely command their being;
that is: a scenery of smoke signals	and a forecast, not cumulus, but emotions	in devotion to this place,	a sanctuary, an escape,	a retreat, a safe haven then	else I’d be rightfully behaving to go home.
If not for the serenity	of this place where	history starts now,	never before; and we bring ourselves	new, each time, to the shore	of waters designed;	as if: inclined to know the need	of each; to feed the soul	without breaching	the contract of the clouds divine,
that is: recognized by the very soil	spread between my toes,	as if: it can be absorbed:	osmosis, straight towards my DNA:	for this place has made me,	thus why I can hear it call my name.
As it is, this place	whispers, like my love: it speaks	in rhythm; it murmurs in rhyme;	it gives pause and a chance	to change, to grow, to progress	in a time of recess	from the life back home;	it is known and being known;
with health	and well being, a true chance	to see the land raw 	then I would do my all to go home.
If not for the tranquillity	of this place 	the way crows caw at dusk	in a field still tended	by human hands,	or the way trees are never	trimmed, as there are few power lines here;	just defined times, here, to grow freely	sprouting up willingly,
a toy like joy	to be passed around, shared significantly;	to remind us that days apart	can be overruled by the heart	when it has been years	that we’ve known one another.
yet with purpose, defining moments	when cordiality cannot surpass	yet does surmount to kindness;	with brevity, we utter	simple truths;
that is: passing by just to say hi,	and to tell someone you care then	I would square up and head home.	As it is, this place knows compassion:	a thriving community of nomads,	where home is secondary	to walls (like mine) that house spouses	left behind;	and this is whimsical
If not for the humility	of this place where	individuals look out	for one another;	as if brotherly love	was not doctrine alone,	but applicable in every way;	each circumstance	another opportunity to shine	the light of love;
(though I may)*	on vacation.
when really, one heart beats in two bodies;	no distance ever means separation,	for our love never goes	(though I may
this place	of so many years	where first or last loves	conjured or conquered	my fears: to be a child, unconcerned;	to be a teen who had learned;	to be a woman, I yearn	for looming hands in the night,	despite the right to take some time apart,
yes, our lake was a creek on a farm	long ago, and the wild thing is how now	one source of water could bring	so many together upon its shore;	I implore, I would be dire to leave,	If not for the way I need to be here:
If not for the reliability	of this place how	it continues to progress	without ever seeming to change;	that is: rearranging the map	while the roads stay the same;	where new faces share old smiles;	where many come from miles	to submerge in man-made waters;
in green waters	mucked by algae	and circling minnows;	who cloud my sight	by stirring the siltthen	I would surely split, and be home in a long	instant.
friends in lifeguard stands,	surveying their own cognition	over the glisten	of sun rays on oiled flesh;	the sheen of their coats shimmering	upon the surface of surrounding water,	encircling the floaters,	the drifters,	the passionately lapping swimmers;	while I tread with flippers
as in: words, hot truth,	scalding nothing	but opening the senses to reveal	an honesty;	that is: with those	whose work is my vacation;
If not for the partiality	of this place where	footfalls land	on common ground	and everything around	seems pure in its sun-bleached brilliance then	I would, without hesitance, race home.	As it is, my feet propped,	poised for prose,	to compose with vernacular	something spectacular
the cadence of crickets in the night,	or the way moonbeams wake me	at just the right moment	to see constellations rise and fall then	I would deny it all and return to my own	home.
that is: to reclaim the realm	of a summer home,	whose voice (a million birds upon the breeze	and the wisp of a billion butterfly wings)	is still inside my heart,	where no amount of time apart	can alleviate like that which soothes:
waving a fare paid in common curtusy;	that is: a decency to recognize humanity;	fellow dwellers on plots aligned,	signing off on time spent	with family, or those chosen	for similar propensity:	whether basking or asking	those akin who wish	to begin again;
If not for the veracity	of this place where	sun burns yearn for aloe vera,	and campfires conflagrate marshmallow;	where bottle caps under tires on asphalt hot	stay compressed forever	a- bump bump- as we golf cart	and four wheel along,	pressing our hands to the air,
and now, as adult,	there is only choice: to return,	to listen, to stay,	to keep at bay the way this blanket	holds my heat alone,	while my husband is at home.
As it is, this place belongs to me:	each blade of grass,	my carpet;	each branch of tree,	my canopy;	where every rock has a story,	and the dock knows my patter,	to tread lightly before leaping	into named waters;	for my childhood knows the sounds	of its voice,
If not for the rarity	of this place where	guards in squad cars	speak the language of herbs,	and the way the road curves	past our site; everyone waving	in friendly delight; a thrill	to be known, yet still strange	in temporal rite then	I would hike home, even through the night.
where every hurt	is no longer sore, but healed,	and strengthened, transformed:	to be used by the One	whom gave us this formthen	I would scorn this hallow ground, and return	to my home.
alleviating the temptation	to negotiate an allocation of time	spent meandering in a world	with no actual destination;	true to the self of others,	caring as if maternally concerned:	real being with real feelings,	so translucent we see through	to the core:
cards and literal boards;	no longer leveling up characters,	but developing our own character;	that is: socializing in the physical;	that is: allowing the spiritual side	to take hold, to mold and transfigure	our emotions;	that is:
If not for the gaiety	of this place the	rush of time spent sun basking	and lake bathing;	moments sequestered without cellular signal	or screens blasting electromagnetic waves	in our faces…	we enjoy the surf without the web	and games are played in the tangible,	that is:
If not for the sincerity	of this place the	sight of families,	for a moment, assured	in love, that is: a circle	round a fire, and laughter	licking the flames of summer then	I would surely head home.
I’ve known my husband whose	hand I would reach	towards in the night,	when our village life	has its own star-dimming light;	an aura that makes	our fingers clasp tightly,	like the fibers of wool	loomed to make a blanket.
If not for the familiarity	of this place the	scent of still waters,	the night bright with stars,	paths taken knowingly without stumbling then	I would be sick for home.	As it is, this place,	with its allure, that is:	a home away from home,	a place I’ve known longer than

I cannot lie.	I am a star crier, and my fire is lit.	Stay lit.	Stay on fire.	Stay the course.	Stay love.	**	I do this for the service of the Word	of God. “In the beginning was the	word, and the word was with god,	and the word was with god.” This	is the word.
. I have the right. I	have the knowledge, discernment,	and foresight. I have the courage. I	have the integrity. I have the honor 	of love made whole inside me. I	have the justice of love made	strong inside my faith. My failures	showed me the truth. My suffering	made me the truth.
life. What are	they? What have you made? What	has, within you, grown? Grown up	strong? What have you done?	I did this.	I thought this.	I said this.	I tried this.	Do that. Do that like you want that	forever to have been wanted by	you, and done by you. Do that.	I have the ability
Work your Summer.	Feel the harvest coming. Feel the	coming harvest. Feel it. Know it. It	is coming. The harvest of our souls.	We will be made whole. Harvest.	Harvest the depths of your soul.	Harvest over kernel of wisdom.	Harvest ever root of love. Harvest	the fruits of your
Cry for love. Cry for the light	of love. Cry for the regal	retribution of love made pristine.	See it happen. Do your part 	ignorantly, so none glean from	your harvest but those in need.	Make your fields ripe. Sow your	seeds, and let none stop you. Know	your Spring.
We know love. We must know love.	You must know love, child. You	must know love, father. You must	know love, mother. I am your	child. I am you. I am not you. I am	the love of love, and that love lives	in you, surely, for surely it must	live. Light your fires, lover, star	criers.
I want my fire so lit, the	wicked are blinded, cowering, until	I hold them, lift their life from the	shadows of death, and their	blindness is true vision; only from	the darkness do we emerge, from	the womb, from the tomb, from the	room, we step into the light of love.
of faith.	I want the lantern of my faith to be	so fired up, others have hope. I	want my faith to be a light so	bright, others are at home in my	glow. I want people to bask in the	love I have for god, and that god	lives in me. I want the love to glow	off me.

Make life a more beautiful place.	Make yourself a more beautiful	person. Make right your own life.	Make perfect, or ish, or what have	you, your own story. You have a	story, yes? Your life. Your story.	Make it your story. Make your life	the living story of awesome.	Awesome is just
Do that thing that	makes people question their own	goodness, and do it ignorantly: do	good thing like no one will know	how good are you. Do things that	makes made-known the goodness	of love, and if you name is never	mentioned, all the better. Best yet.
Win 	at the hopes of vanishing lies. Win	at the joy of making people a better	people, make nice. Make good.	Make it alright. Make it better than	best yet. Do something different.	Do that thing that makes me	wonder how I ever didn’t do that	thing first.
There is	nothing more than the feeling of	love, and the absence thereof.	There is a higher way. The good	fight is won. Battle no more. Fight	no more. Win at love. Just life win.	Win at loving life. Win at loving	those who share life with you.
Move on. Move	over, fear, this dear on is moving.	Move to the unexpected, and be	ready. What’s next. Take another	stride. Stride, don’t strive, and	without strife, go stepping. Step.	Step hearty. Step in such a way	that evil gets out of way. There is	no fear. There is no fear.
Kiss the mirror. That’s god.	Kiss the stars, star criers: lift up	your love of life. Find a way. Do it.	I’ll chase the Voice of Silence. I will	run the way of the Lord. I will side	step the shadow steps, I will walk	in the light of love. I will love the	light of life. Move.
Just love.	Fix your eyes on that flame.	Find your light. 	Find that source of the Source	within yourself. It’s there. There is	none else to turn towards, yet that	which lives inside yourself. There	is god, yet god lives in us.	Kiss a tree. That’s god.	Kiss me. That’s god.
Money love is the evil root. All	fails when money is loved.	Cherish human life. Cherish the	breath of your lover’s sleep.	Cherish the smell of strange	passing by.	Cherish the idea of the dumb.	Cherish the words of the mute.	Cherish the ideas of the weak.	Cherish the love of all
If you find yourself at a table- in a	circle of circumstances, with	people, at a life station- and there	is no love, leave.	Flee.	Run like hell.	Run to heaven.	Get out of there, and find the table	of love. Fight for peace. Peacefully	endure the battle. Wages are for	war.
You do you. 	That’s how life works well. When	we come to the table, unexpected,	and find ourselves welcomed, even,	ignorantly invited. We were always	wanted at that table.
There is enough.	Enough.	Enough.	There is enough ugliness in the	world, and so much more beauty.	Be the ugly truth.	Be the righteous beauty.	Be the reason you shape up, shake	the system, rock the boat or build	the boat or know the waters.	Do you. You? #omg
What is your rhyme? Do you know	your mechanism? Do you know	why you do what you do, and when	you do, do you like it? Do you sleep	well at night, knowing who you	are? Do you wake happy in the	morning, knowing what you’ve	done? Do you live a life of	wakefulness, knowing who you	are
light your torches. Cast	light on the liars. Star criers, lift	you life. Lift your life and see the	valley. See the mountain. 	Star criers, lift your fire. Lift your	flames, star criers. Why do you do?	What do you do and why? What is	your love? What is your reason?
Know the liars, star	criers. Mark them, and leave them.	Liars will kill you. Liars will wait,	privy, waiting for blood. Liars will	lurk. Liars will build up their lies	until you are dead. They will catch	you with their lies. They will	harness you with their death.	Star criers,
Cross.	Cross over. Wake up. Wake up. Be	awake. See the love. See the colors	of every soul. See intention. Know	reason. Know love. See love. See	the reason to love. See	manipulation. See idealisms. See	social standards. See expectations.	Know the lies.
Fire it up. Stay lit. Fire it up. Stay	lit. Fire it up. Stay lit. Fire it up.	Stay lit.	Light your torches, children. Carry	your flames higher. Lift. Lift. Hold.	March. Go. Go harder. Go hard for	the sake of the crossing.

You are my diamond christly lover.	Fire rabbit to fire tiger, honey blue gone orchid:	keep me as your cherish,	and know that any love I have had for another	is only guide for how greatly I cherish each individual.		Your love is more and more coming.
I want not to tarry far from you,	albeit the absence in always reaffirms	the goodness we have earned in having each other.
chamber with star lights upon us,	and most, my love, a few animals to comb wool	and spin yarn, dyed from our hands and looped	into the clothes we all wear.		To go from here, pertinent, yet I find it unnecessary,	to visit HPG and the Locked Porters would	be yet another away spot.
You and I will buy this land here at so fair,	plant the flowering shrubbery and berry patches,	grown the herbs and spices, till the soul	and soil for production. Sauna and green	houses, a yurt for writing and meditation,	a slumber
I Saw it, as if eyes closed	revealed your rainbowed crystaline form.	I saw you tonight.		So know this.	There had been gold,	and there will always be smoke and mirrors;	I will write to change the world	because I know what I can do;		yet you and I?		Too Precious, Keep On
The difference is the reciprocation.		YOU LOVE IN RETURN.		This seems natural, yet it is phenomenal.		Tonight, I saw a diamond from your gaze,	stary gazing lover. And when we embraced,	my third eye saw the diety of a christ	among you.
Sananda, you are the epitome of all the goodness	that I had hoped possible.		When I look out the tomes of my former days,	I hope you are Qanna, jealous for the magnificent	love I would choose wisely, yet openly, to distribute	to he whom I admire.
I have wandered through streets, climbed	mountains, crossed oceans; I have wished on stars	and hid in the forests; I have died, walked	silent, been alone, cried for the life I 	believed to come:		you are come,	and you brought me all the way	together: us.
All the love, towards all the people, young men and beyond, preperation	for the fullness I can have towards you.		I have been among the throng, within the cluster, 	cloistered among many and scattered abroad.
the perfection of unity	shared in the joy of two distinctly different lives meeting in the middle.		I have earned you, just as I am also your prize.		The journey of life has unfurled in such a way that I was made ready for you.
So when you see the words of this love or that love, know in earnest	of our love. OUR LOVE is in every look, more than words; our love is the	energy in the room, the softness of slumber,
And while his once encounter carried me,	the golden was just the final push 	to you.		It's you, my love.		I suppose, the purpose of this is to reaffirm the greatest treasure of my love:	it is forever expounding.	I have no less.	I have only ever more.
Qanna Prana Sananda,		As I look back on some of the books from the beginning of the OMG series, I think to myself, HOW COULD I HAVE LOVED PRANA AND WRITTEN SO MUCH ABOUT JAKE?		My darling, love is a magnificent force.
And just like that, the life of love is more than the vacancy of anything.

Adulations, undulating, utter	terrifying	glory of silent proportions.	When you can be all the	beings in a blink	and the moment is fleeting,	do you	often dwell on the	perfectability	of already perfect perfection?
The inevitability of fluidity,	the transition from fire,	to earth, to water, to air	is yet an exquisite affair.	Remember your vows; to	which degree	do we- of our own voalition-ɱɱ	organize a coalition, a	vocation	of educating those with more	formulated	education.

If you would let me go, and go	hard, until hardly even	enough,	I would still, hoping so greatly,	wonder 'what chapter is next	for this	next round of destiny."
This is small time, small	stakes,	low importance, great	significance.	The time is a menu, a platter	of choosing:	what buffet is worthy of	fulfilling.	Overstuffed, it is rough.	Too many talents, not enough	energy.	Ha. Try me.

The glimmer of hope is the	flickering	portal of doom, lol, too soon?	If you see the sun as a hole in	the fabric of the sky,	you too will wonder	is it too soon to say goodbye.	If you followed the light, met	yourself	on the other side,	would you return: to try	to fly
we are more so	and if you dare	implore	to try to outflight our gliding,	you may or may not learn to	soar.
I like the idea, to build up an	ideal,	inspiring the place of the	empire.	The truth of all that is feeble is	the undertaking, the staking	for the taking:	we are not devoured yet;	we are not done or that	exquisite:

The engaging cooperation	is an exquisite art:	supposing enchanted,	we rearrange the reenacted.	Which arrangement, which	scenario	is present. Present are	viablities,	our super abilities:

This is real, and this is all really	happening.	Already all ready. Already is	done.
Transition and	change. The threshold of fear	is an opportunity to feel the	pangs: and in the enduring,	we are the overcoming proff	of our own astral powers	waiting to be more than a	hallucinating spoof.
Flowing	waters, waywards humans,	changing the climate: and yet	it is all suitable. Transition.	Transition.
Let us remember, this is	weirdness and a blessing.	Putting for words as	transpiring, almost	effortlessly. If someone is	going to do, why am I	wrestling with a shy feeling, a	sense of inadequecy: can you	see the perpetual need to	create a testimony.
A'gain, a'gain, a'gain, AGAIN!
What is the fuss.	Measure your moments, and	your caliber of trust.	Spark up	And one more time, say your	fire in your silence of breath,	let the airs move, or stay still,	the stagnation is passing; this	fleeting time is a'testing.
We	are	here	to learn a good lessons	those throes of bad are still	a third of the fun.	Stay thirsty, never drink too	much.
See what we think and feel	and say and do,	well,ɱɱ	it's all written down for me	and for you.
See, the heart of confessing is	not in the hearing;	it may perchance being in the	recalling and remembering.	We never truly forget. Our	perception is shy.	We reach to the akashic	records; every deed and	thoughtɱɱ	says "Hiii!"
Oh mother of granddaughter.	I am Miranda. This is my	chapter.	Each moment this is written,	two hours put into tome.	This is a fleeting moment:	DO YOU WISH YOU HAD	KNOWN?
No flesh vessel surpassing	another,	let's just switch bodies and	surplant one another.	You be me, and I'll be you,	and we'll see in this game	red queen or blue	which square is black	which square is white	onto whom will it be a proof.	Oh professor.
We move beyond	understanding, exponentially	devolping the suppositions of	maintaining	equality.
What is the purpose of an all	as one	nation.	We gather the peoples; we	move to the stars:	every planet- every planet! - is	yetɱɱ	ours for exploring.
I love the Knowing	of chosing my own Divine	The splendid smell of	premonition,	the relaxing of the pair of eyes	to gain clearest vision;	determing, dictating,	dictation.
What prison is our own mind	What rapture will set us free	Whose god is an alien	and which book are you	reading?	I love golden light	shining from ossifer eyes.
Goddesses blessing out	patriarchal	puumpkin spice lattes.	If I may believe my own	chosen	salvation, what salute	may salute the stature of one	nation	among the cosmos	among the stars	across the street corner	down at them bars.
The ideas are rough.	The proving of purpose is fun.	Let your stars shine	We may have a crazy	president.
The way is simple.	The path is hard.
I thank you	I thank you -- suprise!	Surplanting, sequesting,ɱɱ	making it mine.	The prize is perfection,	can I make you make it thine	too to celebrate your own	chosen divine.
she is letting it loose	not to lose hold of the go	of the plan.	Oogling eyes ponder and pry	I thank you

The world of this foilage and	fauna want you to know	another messiah, this one a	woman, has come to us	let's watch where she goes!	star girl, start gurl, what is	your find?
There we were united.	Fires of fires of fruits of fire	inside.	The earth is calling out.
Approved in the stillness of	the silent, wooded, autumn	night; I wondered	I admired, the positioning so	right. If there Were we	wondering.
Thanks to this budha girl,	stars in the silence of her third	eye.	Allah is merciful. Trust me. He	told me too.
Effortlessly we switch into, if	you will, Christ consciousness.	I have to propell what I know	to be true.
WHat time of day dictates	what we ought say to	ourselves. When does whom	do this and that, and I ought	do it too? Remarkable efforts	are escaping this mutilated	mono dimensional static.
Is there influence or affluence	or deeds done and deemed as	such.	What a bunch of lovelies are.	When did you eat lunch.
Is there an effort, a deed that	is good.	Is there an affonted mother	who would.
a remarkable destiny, and it's	coming to us right on time. In	a theater near you, which	story is true? Do you know of	a girl, a star, whom must do	what she ought do? Is there a	woman, a wife, and a bride. Is	there the purpose of	wondering inside?
What do you want	What do you need	what is convieniant	to what do you plead	please and thanks are okay	who will carry you all the way	is there but you to		cross		the finish line
Each moment is splendor,	when we chooe would	splendor ought to do	to us in a glimpse and the	glimmer	of hope choosing you.	To do as we do, as I move into	cue,	the queve is limited to each	and every	one's own perspective.
Set a marker in the sky.	Look to the stars.	Be of the dust.	Be of your own self.	To whomesle ought I to trust?	I am that I am and I am am	am.	I rise in the morning, and in	the night, I realize the plan.
when do we bunker down	when do we...	choose not to ...	but	just fly.	Why oh why, do you dare to	try.	Set a date.
To have a star girl forever?	Star is our lady, our queen, our	goddess to usher us through.	The cosmos is shifting, and	our planet	is shitting itself while we wait	and wonder	what do we do	where do we go	where do we hide

The godhead is real, this is but	a daughter.	You wanted a son: good.	This is your next flower.	Oh lotus. Oh blossom. Oh	stargazer lily.	Livid.	Are we?
Kneel, Miranda, you are	owning your own gift from	Heaven.
To believe to belittle to belate	the endeavor, we embrace the	remarkable splendor of one	another: spell binding or spell	casting or casting calls and	curtain calls, what bow before	which thrown do you	surrender?

We seek to taste of the	perfect fleet	to travel us onward. The mark	is the center,	or left of there too.	If we are rightous, is there an	off kilter	skit to perform?	Anid the acts, what art is	calling you.
FLY.	The uniqueness of us all is	ubiquitious.	The deciscion to be identical is	unanimus.	The animal in us wants to be	one.
ENOUGH.	Let us one together be a	united vessel.	See no qualms, lest in your	own eye.	Stare into the mirror, see your	own light.	Do you want it to...
Set into stones and stores and	precious, perilous storms+	sanctified purification process	completely	transforms our equlibrium. We	rather gather	and be, than bishop and plea,	Our god is a goodly...
The glory for each and all for	all kind.	This is kinda, I mean, but life	the point of my own purpose.
This is because	this race is just mine.	Just me.	How could it be!		#lynette
The victory is certain.	The pirze is all mine.	I've set the rules to match,	seen the finish line.
Let us raise up a vibration,	achieve	the other shore. Let the	remarkable	endeavors grant us the final	score.
If one woman could just let	herself be	you'd find a grander life when	you meet	your greatest granddaughter's	graduation	delight. When we live to let	sons be soliders	in spiritual wars, flesh never	maimed, yet	often, at times, sore.
We are expanding the brains	of the brainiacs, lest the manic	attacks	seem to be what brought us	back.
Catch me on	towards the source of all fun	doing	remarkable talents exude in	the effortless escapiong.
Each time you eye us,	to pry us open one gift at a	time,	poised unto certain obligation,	and admission for one.
Feast on the feminine,	dear men: we will lure you in,	and yet, in the devices of your	own desires	your own demise, we quandry	the quary of inqyiry	each time.
The power is purest when it	isn't stuck saving.	The grace of it all is the grease	on a wheel	already invented. Invest it.	Ask me about order,	I'll order you introspection.	Bon bon appitite.
What makes us remarkable is	the triumph awaiting.

Christ is the body of all the church. Collectively the Christ speaks all thoughts yet not their own, for they have none of them self, just all of others. They are the empty vessel, they are all but none, and they are not, for they are all else.
What is Christ is the collection of collective human thought. What if the anti christ is the one to take the backlash as propitiation. What if Yeshua was wise because he mocking-bird repeated all human thought.
I don't even want to be famous or popular or identified in any way because it's creepy and weird and not ready

there would be no superficial affection. We would not tarnish our promised perfection, even if he hadn't seen it, the Vision was certain.	He sat down on a rock, closed his eyes, bowed his head.  It looked like he was praying, and then, it looked like he was trying to remember
He tilted his head at me, that coy smile on lips desiring to be kissed. I wouldn't kiss him.  He was still at the point of fleshly desire. 		I too wanted all his kisses, yet until his flesh was removed from the understanding, until his whole spectrum melded into one with me,
required to ease through; I could make it too, even carrying the burden in the my arms, the depths of necessity in my soul.  I could make it to the doors.

He squinted his eyes, as if closing his field of vision would make the sight line zoom to the fire alone.		"How many fires are there?"	He turned towards me quickly, "One?"		"All."

He turned back to look at the flames. "Fire is fire, is all fire, is a sample of something so unique it is identical whenever it appears.  All fire is fire, and all fires are of the fire that alone is fire."
ALL
"How many fires are there?"		He turned towards me quickly, "One?"
He squinted his eyes, as if closing his field of vision would make the sight line zoom to the fire alone.
"I want you to look at the fire. I don't want you to see anything else."
"What do you see?"		"Well, the fire is slightly obscured by the leaves of that tree closter..."
He stood at attention, feet planted shoulder width apart, knees unlocked, shoulders back, head errect.

"What about the fire?"		"We won't loose sight of it."		We moved through the brush, keeping the flaames a point of light in sight.		"All right, Jake.  Look at the fire."		"From here?  Couldn't we have--"		"Just look at it."
I began building a fire as the sun lowered; the rains hadn't come, and there was enough dry leaves and timber to make a blaze.  When the sky was inky with diamond stars and the breeze on our mountain sent the ocean airs unto us, I asked Jake to follow me into the forest.
"Huh?"		I was enjoying this so much. I had learned all of this on my own, surrounding by crowds of either party goers, family members, or complete strangers. 		This guy had me, after being gooned, plucked up, and dropped  back on Runyon's market whatever first real woods LP
"Releax your eyes, focus your heart, eas your mind and be the Source.  I want you to look, that state, until you no longer see, until Sign offers you the Vision."
He sat down on a rock, closed his eyes, bowed his head.  		It looked like he was praying, and then, it looked like he was trying to remember a recipe.  		I would have looked away, given him the privacy of his own solitude of thought, except his whipped upwards his chin and

He tilted his head at me, that coy smile on lips desiring to be kissed. I wouldn't kiss him.  He was still at the point of fleshly desire. 		I too wanted all his kisses, yet until his flesh was removed from the understanding, until his whole spectrum melded into one with me,
as if, I would refrain from the objective just enough to assure it was his own idead, from my soul to his body, two minds, one heart with two beats.		"How about I avert the rain?"
He saw the storm approaching, looming.  He understood my implication, which was one of his first skills I would happily accept as mastered, joyyously.  He was able to read between my lines, understand when I didn't tell you what to do, that what was unsaid was the initiative,
what if i said the only way we get anything is to realize this is the MIDDLE of nothing unless you do something about old sutff and what's to be done now so next old stuff is some how okay ish better ish STILL NOW ISH no matter what until why when where how death stops? done
"Imagine something, bring it to fruition."		"Like what?"		I huffed a sigh.  "Something you Know can be attained."  I pointed to the front moving it. The rains were about to pour down.
"What are we supposed to be doing, Miranda?" He looked at me imploringly. I knew that look. It was interesting to see it, that look, directed at me. So many times, imploringly, had I called out to the universe?  How many times had I sought answers from the cosmos? How mnay times
He saw the fruit in my hand and extended his own palm, a voluntary effort to open the fruit unto drink and meat.

"I feel like I should be doing more, more than, you know, just hanging out on this island."		I raised my eyebrows and shook my head.  "What good wwill you do anyone? You hardly keep from doubting yourself, here alone with me, and we are triapsing through paradise."
It was cute, everytime he asked, the audacity, the suretry, the dire need for certainty.  This time, he was carrying a machete and bush whacking through the undergrowth.
When the government quit dicking around, they skipped Jake and Me to the Samoan island I had thought necessary, A-. 		"So I am the Second Coming of Christ?"
I sparked light inside myself when I sang a certain note.	I healed myself with sound when I sang a certain Hz.		I know we are not alone, despite our infinite loop of self existence.	Self awareness.	Self actualization.		There is more.
If I go on just right, push until i'm out of breath, until I think I'm either going to feignt or wet myself, I push through the tone, the song, the note, the chord, the signing, the breath; push through until radiant colors and streams of light and conceots poured through my mind
When the ceremony started, I lit the candle asking to understand 'fruition.'		During the course of the trip, Sound was brought to fruition.		I realized the power of tones that can come from human life forms.  If I drone on, sing, at the right frequency, Cosmic Center will hear me

I have always waned to believe her. And now you're here...."		Jake couldn't take his eyes off the small, dark child, with steel grey eyes and a bubbling mouth and fingers and sprouting teeth, babbling to himself.
A small child in a walker scooted across the wood floorboards. "I know who you are. I just can't believe you are here.  Miranda said you would come. I wanted to believe her.

"You name is Jake?" The woman asked, inviting him in.  "Jake you go get her I'll steal back my own son's bike on table and ruturn i got tent runyon NOW"
There were tears in the woman's eyes. Jake instantly felt the worse.  His golden girl had died.  This was it.  This had been her mother all along. And as he sought about the town for his golden girl, she must have.... he was no fit... NO (Fiction)
There were tears in the woman's eyes. Jake instantly felt the worse.  His golden girl had died.  This was it.  This had been her mother all along. And as he sought about the town for his golden girl, she must have....
A young woman. I, uh, I dropped her off here once. Never saw her again. Mam, does anyone else live her?"
every time he had looked for golden girl.		"I'm sorry, mam. Good day. I was looking for someone.
Jake was flooded with disappointment. He had secretly hoped She, his golden girl, would open the door.  As if all these months of daring to just knock on the door would prove her some sort of hermit, a recluse, a shut in.  Instead, the same woman he had seen, the gold van driver
He hadn't seen her, and he had to see her.		Knock knock.		The Ames street house door opened. A comely motherly woman answered the door. A look of awe spread across her powdered face.   Blue eyes stared up at him.
He had to see if the Golden Light girl really existed.		He hadn't seen her go into the house.	He hadn't seen her go through town again.	He hadn't seen her golden light, except everytime her thought of it, it was as real as the touch of her cold hands on that night.

The free will of writing is that while I hope some are buying these tomes, reward such efforts unbeknowing in propensity yet to me, the hope is that these words in a world gorwn old, will invigorate to expose something you find worthy to expose.
I have suffered for my ways of expressing thought, as if provoking others to feel as I have felt. That is having dominion over another, and that ought not be sought.

@MoggyDrake The fact that my brain is LSD fried, and so I live my life like I really am the 2nd Coming of Christ... and like there ISN"T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT. It's my wonky brain. Forgive me. #MentalIllnessMisconceptions
I once nailed the first interview. Then they found out I had a mental illness. They compared me to the liability of some previous employee's mental health status. I didn't want that job after that. #MentalIllnessMisconceptions
@UNICEF In Will County Illinois they took my child at Birth after a perfect home delivery because I was bipolar and off my medication and saying weird things. I have not held my child since October and he is almost a year old. #MentalIllnessMisconceptions
@melynn2378 That the government would take your child at Birth because you're bipolar and went off medication to have a healthy child. Or maybe that's just me.

The joyous inevitability is the sequestered rite to make certain the inquiry of spiritual endeavors. We travel to try, we dream to experience, why, to mark the date, and x marks the time in our minds; if only we had carbon burned the crossing. Lunar What. Solar Who. #admireMe
Our unity is for the sake of propensity to make seriously the devotional write of writing the story of a life well lived in the notion forgiving the humility of the human experience, even into the form of a divine plan to humble even the body carrying the head wearing the church

Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: "after this, therefore because of this") is a logical fallacy that states "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy.
