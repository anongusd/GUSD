@ConchoQueen @TheDemocrats so then you admit the tea party is full of racists too?   Ok
@ConchoQueen I was referring to the rhetorical use of the word not Webster's dictionary I can think beyond and understand the connotation
@Wheetypie @ConchoQueenI understand that the #GOP and #TeaParty prefers rhetoric (regime) over country following the lead of Pat Buchannan
@ConchoQueen @Wheetypie "Regime"  Your rhetoric is the real problem.  They are elected officials.  #TeaParty is the real party of fascism
@franmcc14 @Mo Obama didn't make the remarks.  The Leader of the #TeaParty expressed the outrage, she's a public figure
@Morning_Joe It is disingenuous for ANY #TeaParty mmbr to express outrage over Hoffa's remarks as @BarackObama's been vilified for 3 years
@Wheetypie @ConchoQueen I think that people are insane to think they can survive on their own in global economy.  Build a cabin
@Wheetypie I agree.  I think the country should be separated by states so conservatives can live where they want and so can progressives.
