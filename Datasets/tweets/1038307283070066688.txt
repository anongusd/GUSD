@EmmanuelMacron Bless your service and family sir and I hope to see many good things from France once again bless you FRANCE praying for peace @netanyahu
@EmmanuelMacron Erase the value of safe harbor in our travels bless your service and day sir I'm praying for that blessing in unity done only when we can walk our own streets in peace in each situation To know the people who can come legal and know why we need that kind of reassurance
@EmmanuelMacron Bless you I haven't forgotten @STVALENTINE'S  in Louisiana also part of Spain French war I love the history of America and the building beauty we have forgotten in America how the French do beautiful work not just all steel and dirt its beauty is very enriched&amp; let no prejudice
@EmmanuelMacron It's a blessing to know more about France and our people are still there I know it can be changed the direction of our beauty of the world is constant we must remain constant in helping our own countries contribute to the USA fresh French bread and more the figs from the river
@EmmanuelMacron Animals and our cultures from completely being destroyed also the best value of trade in farming is prosperity of the land also the rights to learn heritage and know good behavior not intolerant behavior I'm thankful I'm relearning the beauty of where some of my blood went
@EmmanuelMacron I'm sending some word to understand also why France was aiding Palestine in the RIVERA it's the criminal activity that was funneling to Israel by terrorism they got caught @netanyahu doing it as well as stopping Iran from terrorism in the western values here protecting our farm
@EmmanuelMacron But a goal to move forward I'm a private thinker but look what happens when I think allowed stolen credit happened and yeah Obama did steal credit for a lot of things also did spoiled plans to keep it hidden his real lies to the USA @tv7israelnews @JudicialWatch
@EmmanuelMacron British troops had been treated and left behind by socialist in office lately and no race is a good race without the run and no injustice like injuries of the past but we can try to look beyond but with the lies of predators and prejudice is not only a goal to understand
@EmmanuelMacron Thank you the understanding is they didn't want to even budge on the exclamation point on the growing number of terrorism happening and trying to get them to open their eyes has been critical but they decided to keep under the table it feels like that and not happy with the way

@USMC I still have to go back to the VA for paperwork on it an so I can honor his service and yours very much so because one story is never a lonely thing it is a real deal to forget but bigger deal to be pushed around by people trying to steal who he really was I'm thankful for
@USMC But seeing I can overcome the crooks and bullshit is better for me I'm thankful for your service but I really gotta know all my story on my grandfathers because I hardly got to spend much time with them my first look at an actual purple heart was from my grandfather Scott
@USMC I actually wish you the best valentine's in your years&amp;I miss talking to many veterans when I would visit the VFW to see my grandfather my other grandfather was here also in my home state its hardest thing to lose the farm because of some jokers playing with our American history

@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins Another right given time the wrong unstable system if a shiria law that could kill a witness or even damage them further it's about growing and learning better ways of teaching not them coming over to take our teaching skills away it's about time to say the kids are being heard
@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins Yeah it does it says they wanted to bypass laws for a sanctity that they have no idea about it's like they wanted to over throw government for these high treasonous criminals in which beatings are happening and child endangerment if they don't get it right it could be
@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins It's a long way to get the aid we needed to the people on shutdowns but it's also the way of making it self evident on what they were hiding from them because of the second shutdown we saw all the things they were not telling us about the foreign ran democracy
@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins Citizens legally here were protected not forgotten they made their voice matter when noone was listening again its not about right or wrong is definitely wrong because its about what is right as a whole not for others saying that foreign powers should run their rights
@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins That democracy was not running for them but against them healthcare unmanageablity to the prejudice against the American voices in the health care reform act they wanted better than going to an illegal for medicine and getting our workers again to take on the American workers so
@MeetThePress @SenatorCollins That is what it was about but they chose the very illegal policies of a badly ran democratic party and they also chose to be part of such movements that hurt the democracy if Democrats are working without pay it says something to the rest of the people or it should

@pablocasado_ @PPopular Wrong they were running to evade taxation so how is it that these matters where not pointed out ????
@pablocasado_ @PPopular Why because of the cost no I think it was always an issue of the cost not low enough and negligence happened
@pablocasado_ @PPopular I think looking over their cases is a great plan because of the way they are not left to chance and if the people see it fit for them to return to population it's a real crime study things I look forward into studying further
@pablocasado_ @PPopular This is true they lie cheated and stolen from many villages and has put up a false vanity to sway many women into their nets just to make it harder for them to wing free from their deceitful behavior in our country we have no time for these criminals
@pablocasado_ @PPopular Is happening so a lie @tv7israelnews @osiyo_tv I believe in justice done for our many people not the way you said nonew crimes has happened even into Russia where Crimea is land locked
@pablocasado_ @PPopular No actually asking for aid to your part of many like Chile to Mexico to even porta Rico has been a task because many are stuck in crime waves saying they are but are not for the good of the people its that we needed a honest vote on by the way the passe way you are saying nothing
@pablocasado_ @PPopular Thank you for your time and I'm praying for my fathers innocence in the pursuit of truth in my life he is by the way I know because my mother lied on many men but many she helped were liars it's not easy to explain but better the story of the truth than a big lie of many
@pablocasado_ @PPopular Also women lying about their acts and saying that they are the blame in more greater matters but also grooming women at a young age so men will be arrested in most bad ideas a man could ever be arrested for not all mothere are good mothers because I've seen this activity
@pablocasado_ @PPopular No I'm still wondering why you would say that with all the crime that America has had to deal with and the more radicals are not from our republic I honor my Spanish blood but I'm sick of them lying about coaching children to many things I've seen it and even seen it openly

Would they hate me well I'm guessing yes and hostel interest are not good I've spoken to many who say they have to escape the hate but where is the hate ?? Yeah like I guessed all in their minds like mine no it's more I think a problem of poverty but no it's more https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
Are from why they wanted divisional assaults against the children of the lord and why they chose to tamper with private accounts in our society with them not even just but one African man and a Somalian woman it's sad that labels are the same in America if they knew I was Jewish https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
Bad news and that they have their medical affordability taken care of but I'm only human and they are as well the bigger issue is that they haven't even said nothing to me I like a person that helps with just being human in the world stage 1 is not that but the origins where they https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
Tell me again why they dont aid their poor or even help them if they stray off from a mosque or even help them find each other unless it's in a deadly cycle of hate I actually an seated next to a man and his wife who are Muslim hoping they make it out of the er with Good news not https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
All the way to saying they are not really sick all in their heads or even find reasons to make fun of them and publicly attack them its sick bullying cycles like this in Islam and in Eruope that should not be respected https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
Yeah personal emails with jobs like ms cheap and more titles done by them its pathetic that they'll pick on their poor educated but they will not help their own people get out of poverty steal their land and their rights even Medical affordability to credit to work programs https://t.co/Kgg3VbD19Z
