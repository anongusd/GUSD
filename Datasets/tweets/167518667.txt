@greg_ip @sam_a_bell I think China is obviously a huge part of the story for Australia. But even if it wasn't so heavily tied to China's economy, I think the fact that it's never hit the ZLB (though it's getting close now) means it likely only would have had mild recessions
@greg_ip @sam_a_bell Fair enough. I picked 2008 just to get a sense of how far below a 2% trend line we've been during the current cycle — basically, how much would this have changed things if we'd been using it before — but the Fed could just as easily start from this year, if it wanted.

@jeffspross Through bank lending
@jeffspross I don't think that's right. The real reason a large debt burden might be inflationary is that you might be tempted to print money to pay for some of it. Or you might be more willing to use some combination of financial repression &amp; modestly higher inflation to reduce it.

@binarybits @asymmetricinfo What about believing in federalism https://t.co/xjHZddteB6
What's strange is how politically timid this more extreme version of MMT is. Instead of arguing that Medicare for All or a Green New Deal would be worth the taxes to pay for them, it retreats to a "we don't *really* have to pay for them at all."		No tradeoffs required!
But MMT has allowed itself to become unmoored from any ground with the more extreme interpretation of "taxes don't fund spending". People think this means that we don't ever have to pay for things, that they've discovered The Secret that "they" don't want you to know about.
In other words, MMT is at least on *some* ground when it says that fiscal policy should be responsible for keeping inflation in check rather than monetary policy. I think that's a bad argument for practical reasons, but at least it's reality-based.
"Good" MMT assigns economic importance to a mundane, mechanical observation: that the government spends money before it's taxed or borrowed it.		"Bad" MMT assigns deep philosophical meaning to it instead.
I think that, far too often, @MattBruenig is correct that this is what MMT is actually about. https://t.co/XYe6PnmxQ2 https://t.co/7P0xxVkgdu

@zachdcarter @Neil_Irwin That's assuming fiscal policy would even reliably work as a way to control inflation. I'm skeptical. 		Not to mention that the politics of "we need to raise taxes to keep inflation down" are a lot worse than "we need to raise taxes to pay for things you want".

The Fed's "capital position" is an accounting fiction. It's not like investors are going to lose faith in the Fed because it doesn't have enough dollars when it can create an infinite number of them at will. It's something that clueless people worry about to try to appear savvy.
First off, the only reason the Fed is "insolvent" on paper is that it's been remitting all of its mega-profits the past few years to the Treasury. Second — and more importantly — this is totally irrelevant. It doesn't change anything about the Fed's ability to do its job.

Either the natural rate of unemployment is a lot lower than the 4.5% the Fed thinks it is, or there’s no such thing as the natural rate of unemployment, or inflation is going to increase a bit the next few years. 		Take your pick, Fed.
There’s still a disconnect between the Fed’s unemployment &amp; inflation projections. The Fed thinks inflation will stay flat at 2.1% the next few years despite unemployment being at 3.5% — a full point below its supposed “longer run” level — for that entire time.

The bottom line is that the broad contours of the last 10 years might have looked pretty similar if Lehman had been saved, just smaller.		But that’s everything. https://t.co/t5p8QxH8HK https://t.co/FoJP9sp0Da
China, meanwhile, would have had a much smaller stimulus—it was 19 percent of GDP in actuality—and a much larger trade surplus as a result. 		At a time when the U.S. &amp; Europe would have been languishing with near-zero interest rates, this might've become a political flashpoint.
The result might have been a sharper but shorter euro crisis, with everything that happened from 2010-15 being compressed into a much smaller window.
Kicking out Greece might have given Merkel the political cover she needed to do more. And faced with the prospect of 60 years of integration unraveling over the course of 60 hours, the ECB would have bought bonds big time. The Fed would have had to open swap lines too.
What Lehman taught us, though, was that we couldn’t have any more Lehmans. So without it, there might have been a little less willingness to bail Greece out.		Which means there might have been an even European crisis in 2010 or 2011.
Europe still would have had its own crisis. It had had unsustainable flows into Greece, Spain, Ireland and the rest, and eventually those were going to stop. That’s what unsustainable things do.		Lehman merely brought that forward a little.
This might have gone on until unemployment was 7 or 8 percent — and the recovery still would have been slow since households had so much debt.		There still would have been a stimulus, but not quite as big. Still a pared down version of Dodd-Frank as well.
The simple story is the housing bubble had been supporting a lot of demand, so without it things would have been tough. 		Originally, unemployment had been going up because housing prices were going down, but then housing prices would have gone down because unemployment was up.
The problems in the financial system were amplifying the problems in the real economy, but those problems in the real economy still would have been there without a panic.
There still would have been a pretty nasty recession in the U.S. The easiest way to think about that is that we had two problems back then: the housing crash, and the losses the housing crash was causing the banks.
This had worked in the early 1980s when losses from the Latin American debt crisis had left a few big banks technically insolvent.		The best case, then, is that we had a few years of zombie banks trying to fix their old problems. Undead is better than almost dead, though.
A few big lenders directly exposed to the housing market — think Wachovia — likely still would have gone under. 		But avoiding an all-out panic *might* have let us avoid a TARP-style bailout. The hope is that banks might have been able to earn their way out of their problems.
Even if the Fed had been able to grease the wheels for a Lehman deal like it had with Bear, AIG still probably would have needed to be bailed out, and the other investment banks likely would have needed to sell themselves.
Our world changed 10 years ago when Lehman failed. But what would things have looked like if Lehman hadn't gone under? I talked to Tim Geithner, Frederic Mishkin, Barney Frank, and many others about that. https://t.co/t5p8QxH8HK

Repatriation is significant for stock buybacks &amp; CEO pay, but not for jobs &amp; investment.

It was entirely predictable that Trump's tax cuts wouldn't make companies repatriate much money. That's because most of the $2.6 trillion that's being held "overseas" is actually already in the U.S. It's being invested in things like Treasury &amp; corporate bonds. https://t.co/ile2ZBxQoB

For another, Britain's biggest trading partner — the euro zone — went through a double-dip recession that weighed on Britain quite a bit too. So did North Sea oil drying up. 		So did a million other things before you'd get to being slightly meaner to bankers.
For one, Britain turned to austerity more &amp; earlier than we did. Between 2009 &amp; 2012, its structurally adjusted balance shrank 2.8 percentage points; ours shrank 1.3.		And the parts of Britain most affected by austerity were more likely to vote for Brexit https://t.co/GscL4sEzgD

Besides, as we have learned, the Fed is not "out of ammo" when interest rates get to zero. Its job just gets a little bit harder.		That's why it'd be *nice* if the recovery went on long enough that rates got high enough that they didn't end up at zero next recession.
Raising rates when it's not warranted will only push the economy into a recession, so you'll end up cutting them right back again.		What we want is for rates to go up because it's justified—either by higher growth or inflation or both.

Trump and Erdogan have turned Turkey's economic crisis into a Coen brothers-level farce. Total incompetence all around. https://t.co/PT24J9zvno https://t.co/npcew6mEZs
The last thing to keep in mind is that Turkey's people already hold a lot of their money in dollars instead of lira. Those bank deposits could make for a tempting target for the government, something it's already had to deny thinking about.
As @paulkrugman points out, it's hard to imagine that this doesn't end with some kind of default/repudiation and capital controls. The only question is how long it takes Erdogan to get there. 		At the speed the lira is falling, it might not be long. https://t.co/pFWKU9HePt
In fact, Erdogan has criticized the “traitors” who are saying that Turkey might need capital controls.		Maybe the worst sign, though, is that Erdogan insists that Turkey has “strong economic fundamentals.” (It doesn’t). That’s what you say right before things get really bad.
Erdogan continues to say this is an “economic war” that the Turkish people need to fight by selling their dollars &amp; gold for lira, suggesting that he won’t do what’s necessary—rate hikes, spending cuts, and probably capital controls— himself to prop up the lira.
Why is the lira falling so much? Trump’s tariffs aren’t helping, but this is mostly a story about Erdogan’s mistakes. He’s forcing the central bank to keep interest rates low in the face of rising inflation &amp; a weakening currency, and he’s not backing down either.
The Turkish lira is down another 6.4% today to 6.87 per dollar. It’s nearing the level where Goldman said some Turkish banks would begin to run through their extra capital. 		It’s no wonder, then, that their central bank just cut the reserve requirement ratio for their banks… https://t.co/cuSRlFnI73

Another way hyperinflation ends is when the economy spontaneously dollarizes so much that people just refuse to use the old currency at all. This is how Zimbabwe's hyperinflation ended in 2009. 		Again, something like this is starting to happen in Venezuela, but only starting.
Sometimes similar is starting to happen to the extent that Venezuela—which doesn't print its money itself, but rather imports it—is having some trouble paying for new money.		Venezuela, then, barely has enough dollars that are worth something to create bolivars that aren’t.

@ModeledBehavior @yeselson Maybe! It’s great that Powell seems open to trying to push the unemployment rate down even further.
@yeselson @ModeledBehavior I don’t have a good explanation for it other than maybe pent-up deflation or just companies getting used not to not having to offer raises in a ZIRP environment. Maybe it will change there—and here too!
@yeselson @ModeledBehavior The fact that Japan has both a lower unemployment rate and a much higher prime-age employment-population ratio, and *still* has no wage growth might be a canary in the coal mine for us.

@Nikopol5 @APHClarkson @ajlamesa You're right, it's inconceivable that a government that might create what's either illegal debt or illegal money might break other rules. Nothing to see here!
@APHClarkson @ajlamesa As you say, immigration is another potential flashpoint. But you're acting like the euro's third-largest economy talking about creating what looks like might be a parallel currency isn't a big deal. It is.
@APHClarkson @ajlamesa I'm well aware of how difficult it is to leave the euro. So MS5-Lega will *probably* back down on their economic plans in short order. But the fact that they're talking about mini-BoTs suggests that they might not—and that's significant.
@APHClarkson @ajlamesa You keep arguing against straw men. I never said this "automatically ends the rule of law," just that I wouldn't be so sure something wouldn't happen simply because it was against the rules.
@APHClarkson @ajlamesa I don't quite understand why you're so defensive about this. I never said anything about the strength of the rule of law in the US. The point is simply that populists everywhere tend to not let themselves be constrained by these things. I'm sorry if that offends you.
@APHClarkson @ajlamesa A government that wants to/feels forced to leave the euro will not necessarily care about constitutional checks &amp; balances. Saying it won't happen because the rules won't allow it is painfully naive.

@michaelbd That's not what I'm doing. His ugly nationalism definitely has an appeal, but the point is that he was in power before the immigration crisis and likely still would be even without it given how he's stacked the deck in his favor.

Finally, to the extent that the EU is a “German empire,” it’s worth thinking about how much it was an unplanned and unwanted one. It started out, with the Coal and Steel Community, as a way to help France’s economy while reassuring it that Germany wouldn’t be a threat again.
The point is that you can’t always tell a simple story of Europe’s plucky-but-a-lot-of-times-horrible populists rising up in defense of their own sovereignty. There’s definitely a lot of truth to that, but sometimes—i.e., Hungary—it’s more about how fragile democracy really is.
It’s hard to generalize from Orban. He’s a politician who his opponents always suspected of having authoritarian tendencies, who, guess what, does! He’s latched onto immigration after the fact, but it doesn’t explain his rise or the fact that he still has power.
It’s true that in the most recent election, Orban ran against the EU, immigration, and George Soros in openly anti-Semitic terms, but *he had already consolidated power*. The outcome wasn’t really in doubt.
Orban set about rigging the rules in his favor—extreme gerrymandering, getting rid of run-offs that hurt him, packing the courts, harassing independent media, and turning the state broadcaster into pure propaganda—so that he won another supermajority in 2014 with fewer votes.
Here’s a telling example: Hungary’s Orban isn’t in power because of a reaction against Merkel’s immigration policy. 		He came to power in 2010, because his party was the only major one not discredited by the Great Recession. https://t.co/aD4AY8Qcdi

Broader unemployment, or U6, fell to 7.8%, which is the lowest it’s been since … July 2001.

So Reaganism might only work as long as "starve the beast" is something that's used to justify deficits, not put into action. Which is to say that spending—or rather "spending"—is only unpopular until it's actually being cut.
Republicans would actually have to cut Social Security &amp; Medicare at some point. Now, there are a lot of true believers like Paul Ryan who are itching to do exactly that ... but a lot of other ones know that would mean the end of their political careers.
The national GOP hasn't had to deal with this because the federal government can and does run deficits all the time. But it's going to become an issue pretty soon as the Baby Boomers start retiring in bigger numbers and Social Security &amp; Medicare spending go up more.
State GOPs are showing us the problems that the national GOP is going to run into soon. States *have* to offset their tax cuts with spending cuts, so there's no hiding that people are losing essential services, like education.
The most predictable part of all this is that Republicans, like former Kansas governor Sam Brownback, called this tax-cutting a "real live experiment" ... and then didn't change their minds at all when it failed.		You might even call this an obsolete dogma....
Republicans really have taken the low-taxes-low-services model as far as it can be. It turns out that cutting school to four days a week to pay for tax cuts for the rich doesn't make the economy grow more. 		Who could have known!

To recap: job growth is stronger and wage growth is weaker than you’d expect with unemployment at 4.1 percent. That tells us we aren’t close to full employment yet.		Fed Chair Jay Powell was right when he said it might be 3.5 percent. Maybe we should find out?
Broader unemployment, U6, was unchanged at 8.2 percent. It’s actually up a total of 0.2 percentage points from October. (The regular unemployment rate hasn’t changed at all over that time).
The household survey shows BIG job gains: +785k employed. The employment-population ratio was up 0.3 percentage points from 60.1 to 60.4 percent.
+313k, +54k in revisions, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1 percent, and average hourly earnings were only up 2.6 percent the past year.

The postscript to all this, of course, is that now that they have the White House, Republicans are pushing more money into the economy when unemployment is 4.1% and falling than Democrats did in 2009 when unemployment was 8.1% and rising.
Republicans also vilified the Fed for trying to do its job to help the recovery—raising the political cost of action for it.		Heck, during the 2011 primaries, Rick Perry said Ben Bernanke’s policies were “treasonous” and would get him treated “pretty ugly” in Texas.
Why has it taken 9 years? A lot of reasons. We had a deep, deep hole to dig out of. The stimulus wasn’t big enough, and when we needed more, Republicans not only blocked that, but also held the debt ceiling hostage to push austerity.

One note of caution: wage growth numbers tend to be especially volatile, so a big increase this month *could* be offset by a big decline the next.		Still, though, faster wage growth is what we would expect with unemployment so low, and this month at least, we finally got it.
Broader unemployment, or U6, actually ticked up from 8.1% to 8.2%. It’s still down 1.2 percentage points the past year, though.
+200k in January, -24k in revisions, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%, and wage growth increased to a post-crisis high of 2.9% the past year.

Average hourly earnings only up 2.4% the past year. Even with 4.2% unemployment, there’s no sign of wage pressure or inflation in general.
Broader unemployment, or U6, fell from 8.3% to 7.9%. Big drop.		It’s down 1.6 percentage points in the past year too.
The household survey shows the labor force shrinking by 765k in October, and the number of people with a job falling by 484k.
Despite the very solid jobs numbers, the unemployment rate fell for the bad reason that A LOT fewer people were looking for work.
September is revised from a loss of 33k jobs to a gain of 18k gains. That means the record streak of positive jobs months is back.
+261k in October, +90k in revisions, and the unemployment rate is down to 4.1%. Definitely time to replace the Fed Chair.

@ScottElliotG @kpomerleau Around $2bn a year once fully phased in. So it seems like $250-300 bn would probably be a decent rough estimate?
@ScottElliotG @kpomerleau Right, I figured that first part. TPC estimates that a $500k cap applied to all mortgages would raise around $18bn in 2027 after increasing
@ScottElliotG @kpomerleau That first decade number? (I know you haven’t run the numbers yet, but does something like that sound right to you?).

Because Trump’s tax plan can’t be permanent under reconciliation. It adds $3.1T to the deficit in its second decade, when it can’t add any.
But just as important, Trump would have to raise taxes on the middle class forever (chained CPI) to pay for *temporary* corporate tax cuts.
Some fun facts about the Trump tax cuts: 45% of families with kids would get a tax hike, including 34% of those making $10k-$20k.

@de1ong I wasn’t clear. I meant that they seem to think inflation is a risk to their wealth.
@MattBruenig Seems like a lot of rich people are irrationally afraid of inflation, and prefer to maximize their risk-free returns.
It’s no coincidence that the only two times the bottom 20% have gotten real raises was when unemployment was well below 5%.
Whether we get unemployment down from, say, 5 to 4 percent—especially for people at the bottom of the income ladder.
Higher unemployment isn’t really a threat to the top 5 percent’s wealth. Higher inflation is. But for everybody else, it really does matter
So it’s no wonder that the rich would rather the Fed head off potential inflation than see how low unemployment could potentially go.
It turns out there’s a statistically significant relationship between unemployment &amp; real income growth for every group EXCEPT the top  5%.
Lower unemployment matters to everyone but the rich https://t.co/vq7xJh0ZCx https://t.co/1XZv57vHji

@SenRandPauI Never mind that Rand Paul just endorsed a plan that even a minimally competent senator would know is impossible.

@SenRandPauI So Rand Paul just wants to cut the corp tax rate without any pay-fors, but the GOP can’t cut the corp tax rate without big pay-fors.
@SenRandPauI That’s how much a corporate tax cut changes behavior: a 3 year cut adds to the deficit after 10. And Paul wants to cut it even further!
@SenRandPauI The problem for Republicans is that cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent for just 3 years adds to the deficit after 10 years.
@SenRandPauI But if you’re going to cut taxes with only 51 votes in the Senate, like the GOP is trying to, then you can’t add to the deficit after 10 yrs

@carney @evergreentwete A 44% bracket on income above $1 million (or $5 million, whatever it is), would hit super-duper-uber high-earners very hard.
@carney @evergreentwete This is much less of a challenge if you ask whether the top 1 percent *on average* get a tax cut, like a TPC distributional table would show
@carney When it comes to the top 1 percent, Dems are just endorsing what *was* Trump's Treasury Secretary's position a few months ago.l
@carney Maybe! I could see something like Pease. Who knows. The point is that you’ve constructed an absurd gotcha based on ignoring half of reform.
@carney You're leaving out that Republicans are ostensibly pursuing tax *reform* not tax *cuts*. This whole scenario you've invented is BS.
@carney Nope. If you wanted, you could cut lower brackets &amp; deductions so that top 1 percent don't pay less and any tax cuts are paid for.

3. But a country’s trade balance is about exports *and* imports. And that balance is determined by their savings minus investment.
2. Germans say “It’s not our fault our exports are so good that people want to buy them. What should do, make them lower quality?"

This is definitely the behavior of someone who has nothing to hide https://t.co/XPJw8OWAkQ https://t.co/CGgJ0FSMzC
Flynn said he'd be in jail if he did 1/10th of what Hillary did. So what if he did infinity times more? https://t.co/YD4Qgn4RP7 https://t.co/NVi5l5Io3L

@MattBruenig I think it's more likely to succeed if you use price controls to shrink healthcare spending as a % of GDP &amp; slowly expand govt coverage
@MattBruenig 1) That's not trivial, and 2) I think the "net of what you paid in premiums, this isn't *that* huge a tax hike" is a hard message to finesse
@MattBruenig Running on tax hikes that high would probably be a bad idea politically.
This is why turning single-payer into a litmus test is a bad idea. Better to focus on other price controls. https://t.co/jVmQFSyzkA

But what about the tax cuts? 😥

Trump must be really worried about the new CBO score on his healthcare bill &amp; is just trying to distract us with some impeachable offenses.
I’m old enough to remember when leftists were saying that the Trump-Russia stuff was just a “new McCarthyism”.
Poor Paul Ryan. He’s just trying to cut taxes for the rich and take health insurance from the poor, and this stuff keeps happening. https://t.co/yv354JaQDn

@dziblatt 5. In what sense is the GOP, which is doing the best it has since 1928, “weak”? Here’s Ziblatt’s explanation: https://t.co/b24FDCpsJp
@dziblatt 4. Put another way: the far-right can only gain power when the center-right goes along with it.		It’s the difference between Trump &amp; Le Pen.
@dziblatt 3. Basic idea is that democracy dies when the center-right is so weak that it gives in to the temptation to try to use the far-right.
@dziblatt 2. You should buy Daniel Ziblatt’s new book “Conservative Parties &amp; the Birth of Democracy”. Could not be timelier. https://t.co/04i5uh0lbM
