Glenn: We need to fix animal health through the use of innovations, and we need USDA to come to the table to help with that.
Wyant:  Anything come to mind on how USDA could help enhance the adoption of biotechnology?
Glenn: They are business people and they want the newest and latest technology. This is critical to the conservations we are having right now and training all people to understand technologies.
Wyant: What have you seen with younger farmers adopting technology?
Meet the Farm Hands: Bill O'Conner, Watkinson Miller https://t.co/jYR8mBU8Xd https://t.co/YfN56OjKdP
Bobo: Science at the beginning of a conversation is polarizing. Stop telling people what you do and explain why you do it. We need to talk about why we do what we do. Farmers and scientists are both passionate about their jobs.
Ricketts: More and more people need to talk about where food comes from and what farmers and ranchers do.
Wyant: Consumers worry plant biotechnology is not safe. How do you overcome the emotion of that?
Abrahamsen: We need to explain the importance of innovation and how it helps animals with heat tolerance.
Wyant: How do we bridge the disconnect of people who are concerned about global warming and those who are not?
Ricketts: We need to look at the regulatory process between FDA and USDA and see how its working.
Wyant question to panelists: What's the one thing you would suggest as an improvement in the regulatory process for plants or animals?
Bobo says we need to understand consumers. Yes, they want to know if GMOs are in their food, but they also want to know if DNA is in their food too.
Bobo: We need to change the nature of the conversation. It's not about certain genetic apples people eat but also about food waste.

MacAulay: 3 countries need proper regulatory processes, so other countries feel comfortable that when they eat food from North America they know it's safe
Next question to Perdue, Villalobos and MacAulay: Where can three countries work together to open new markets, especially in Asia
Villalobos: Farmers won't be able to meet the 'big challenges' of growing population without technology.
MacAulay says it's moral obligation to speak out about the safety of biotechnology.  We cannot decide that we’re not going to use something because someone THINKS it’s bad
.@SecretarySonny says US moving expeditiously as possible on USMCA consideration, optimistic on congressional approval by summer (drawing laughter from counterpart) 'We'll build momentum as each nation ratifies'
.@SecretarySonny It’s important that we function as one. ... three countries are committed to 'upping our game' on African swine fever
Canada's MacAulay: Three countries must be prepared to deal with African swine fever before it comes, not after. 'Just hope we can work together ... not after, but before'
Villalobos says preventing pests requires that we continue communicating and sharing technologies and recognizing mechanisms that each country has
@SecretarySonny asks whether 3 countries can work together to protect farmers from pests
Villalobos says more than 50 percent of Mexico’s population lives in poverty and that is unacceptable
Villalobos on USMCA: Now it is up to us  to look for ways to make it a reality and to get the benefit, not only for consumers but also for farmers, especially small and medium scale farmers
.@SecretarySonny says USMCA includes provisions to enhance information exchange and cooperation on agricultural biotechnology.
.@SecretarySonny singles out EU for criticism, noting it has approved safety of biotech crops. The EU continues to import GMO animal feed yet the EU prohibits farmers from planting these crops.
.@SecretarySonny says he's worried about 'fear your food' movement. It has the potential to sideline, deter, critical technologies that we already use and derail technologies in the pipeline, he says

Trump says good night and God bless America after about an hour and 22 minutes at the podium. Check back with Agri-Pulse tomorrow for more on the speech.
Trump: What will we do with this moment?  How will we be remembered? ... Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.  Our most exciting journeys still await.  Our biggest victories are still to come.
Trump: I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment … this is not an option, this is a necessity.
Trump also asks Congress to pass the Reciprocal Trade Act.
Trump: I hope you can pass USMCA to bring back our manufacturing jobs, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:  made in the USA.
Trump: I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.  But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
Trump: We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.
Trump: Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
Trump: In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall - but the proper wall never got built.  I will get it built.
Trump: Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
Trump: Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.
Trump: Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill...
Trump: This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – in some cases after years and years of waiting.
Trump: An economic miracle is taking place in the United States - and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.
Trump: "Members of Congress:  the State of our Union is strong.”		A “USA-USA-USA” chant briefly broke out in the chamber.
Trump on tax bill: We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
Trump: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.  Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
Trump: Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. … The decision is ours to make. We much choose between greatness or gridlock.
Trump: There is a new opportunity in American politics if only we have the courage together to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country.
Trump: Agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican or Democrat agenda, it’s the agenda of the American people.
Trump: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
President Trump is set to deliver the State of the Union address soon. Stay tuned to Agri-Pulse for live updates. #SOTU

Wheeler, in answer to question from Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., says, "I do consider myself a conservationist; I still hike, I still camp. I’m an Eagle Scout."

The House has passed the farm bill in a 369-47 vote. The bill now goes to President Trump for his signature.
BREAKING: House passes farm bill.
Senate Ag's ranking Democrat, @SenStabenow, is in the House for the final farm bill vote
House is starting the vote on the farm bill conference report. H.R. 2.
The 5 Democrats who were critical to saving the farm bill rule: Costa, Lawson (Fla.), Peterson, Ruppersberger and David Scott. All but Ruppersberger are on House Ag. Eighteen Republicans voted no. Rule was approved by 3 votes.
House adopts rule for the farm bill, 206-203, setting up final congressional vote on the legislation later this afternoon.
House procedural vote is 220-191, on party lines. The vote on the rule itself is starting.
Correction: Peterson voted against ordering the previous question, a preliminary vote https://t.co/6PnHYAbPX5
Correction: This vote is on ordering the previous question, not the rule itself.
Rule for debating farm bill now has 217 yes votes, a majority of the current House membership

How to convince farmers of benefits of sustainability? Need more proof of best practices to convince producers that spending a little money today (on soil health for example) will make money in the future, Vilsack says
Vilsack: Need global agreement on definition of sustainability, with metrics that can reassure consumers the standards are being followed
Europeans see sustainability as a marketing opportunity and advantage, Vilsack says, citing his work with @USDairyExporter
Vilsack: Consumers and importers are demanding more info about their food, including whether it's being produced sustainably, 'not just a buzz word' anymore

As a note: The RFS and the move to year round E15 sales both have bipartisan support and opposition.
Trump: My administration is protecting ethanol … today we are unleashing the power of E15 to power our cars 12 months out of the year, not just eight. … The Dems will take away ethanol if they can, so you better go out and elect more Republicans.
Trump on immigration: 'We’re going to have people coming in to help on your farms, we’re going to have people coming in, but they’re going to come in legally.'		Chants of “build that wall” begin from the crowd.
President Donald Trump now speaking at a campaign rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa: We’re going with E15 year round … I made that promise to you during the campaign … promises made, promises kept.

Trump says his biggest concession was making the deal: “We could have done it a different way, but it would have been nasty and it wouldn’t have been nice."
Trump: Dairy was a dealbreaker, and I know Canada can’t open it up completely because they have farmers too, but they could open it up more and we have more access for our farmers.
Trump says tariffs will remain in place “until such time as we can do something different like quotas perhaps.” Says negotiation on that subject are ongoing.
Trump: The steel and aluminum tariffs are staying … You’ll have cases where countries are not going what is fair and reciprocal, so you use tariffs.
Trump: Think trade deal will pass through Congress, but if it doesn’t, we have a number of other alternatives.
Lighthizer: New agreement will serve as a template for other agreements under Trump administration under pillars of fairness, digital trade, and provisions targeted at unfair trade practices.
Lighthizer now speaking: Agreement is historic in many ways … we have done this in 14 months, and in trade negotiating terms, that’s like warp speed.
Trump: Farmers aren’t able to sell most of their products in the EU. We’re having a successful negotiation there, but who knows. I have a feeling we’ll be successful.
Trump: Without tariffs, we wouldn’t be talking about a deal for those babies that talk about tariffs, including Congress.
Trump: I plan to sign the agreement by the end of November then submit it to Congress.
Trump: This landmark agreement will send cash and jobs into the United States and into North America. Also good for Canada and Mexico.
Trump: Requiring a tremendous portion of automobiles made to be made with high-wage workers, which will reduce outsourcing of labor.
Trump also says the new deal will allow for greater access for U.S. dairy industry.
Trump: Especially great deal for our farmers … we’re working on some other deals that are going to make them very happy also … Agreement will give our farmers and ranchers far greater access to sell produce in Mexico and Canada.
Trump: Once approved by Congress, this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date agreement in the history of our country.
Trump gives his “highest regards” to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trump also thanks other administration officials as well as outgoing and incoming Mexican government leadership.
Trump recognizes Lighthizer “No one understands how hard he’s worked … whenever you call him he’s always in the office or in someone else’s office."
Trump: The jobs were leaving, the factories were leaving, and we can’t have that.
Trump: It’s my great honor to announce that we have completed a new agreement to terminate and replace NAFTA with USMCA.
Now USTR Robert Lighthizer and WH staffer Jared Kushner appear. Two minutes until Trump speaks, we’re told.
A number of administration officials staged behind where Trump will speak, including Ag Secretary Sonny Perdue and USTR Chief Agricultural Negotiator Gregg Doud.

Roberts concludes committee meeting by saying we “must provide certainty and predictability” for farmers and consumers.
Ohio GOP @RepBobGibbs: Oppose cushion of credit language in Senate farm bill, would be costly to rural electric cooperatives.
Illinois Dem @RepCheri: Pleased to see energy program funding in the House and Senate farm bill.
California GOP @RepJeffDenham: Hopeful that we will prioritize research and development to ensure crops thrive for years to come. Also want to make sure USDA biomass, bioenergy programs include biomass from trees.
Louisiana GOP @RepAbraham: Successfully moved away from old cotton program and moved cotton into PLC. Support including nieces, nephews, and first cousins in actively engaged definition.
Arkansas GOP @RepWesterman: We’ve been loving our forests to death, need to include provisions in the farm bill to help with management.
Arizona Dem @RepGrijalvaCS: Have responsibility to be good stewards of our environment, encourage colleagues to remove language on endangered species issues from farm bill.
Utah GOP @RepRobBishop: Hope we can have robust forestry language in this farm bill before fire issues continue to cause problems in the West.
Vermont Dem @SenatorLeahy: Wrote the organic program bill when I was chairman, want to make sure that program is protected in this bill.
Kentucky GOP Rep. James Comer: Last farm bill opened door for industrial hemp, encourage this conference to adopt language to allow hemp growth to continue to expand.
Virgin Islands Dem @StaceyPlaskett: Farm bill must create economic opportunities for our most economically disadvantaged farmers. Also call on farm bill to be fair to residents of U.S. territories.
North Carolina GOP @RepMarkWalker: Some people have called SNAP reforms cruel. I’ll tell you what’s cruel; not being able to lift people out of poverty is cruel.
@RepKevinCramer Cramer: Cushion of credit language should not be included in final farm bill.
North Dakota GOP @RepKevinCramer: Happy with increase guaranteed loan levels, optimistic about ARC/PLC changes.
New York Dem @RepPaulTonko: Final version should protect dairy farms, protect SNAP families, and promote sustainability.
Illinois GOP @RepShimkus: Let’s fix the digital divide, let’s not overbuild capacity. Need better broadband coverage maps, don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
North Carolina Dem @RepAdams: Provision on OSHA’s process safety management rule is unnecessary and should be removed.
Georgia GOP @RepRickAllen: Want to maintain House definition for actively engaged in farming.
@RepArrington Arrington: Think the AGI reduction is a threat to the safety net. The net income is what matters.
Texas GOP @RepArrington: The young guys can’t get in this business if we don’t do this right and do this quickly.
V.P. Pence weighs in on the farm bill as the conference committee meets. President Trump did so earlier this morning. https://t.co/M4VORebnCa
Kansas GOP @RepMarshall: Agriculture is a risky endeavor. I see no reason for federal government to place rules on who should be covered or how their business should be structured.
North Carolina GOP @RepDavidRouzer: Pleased both versions of the bill contain language to address disease response preparedness, FMD vaccine bank. Look forward to working that language out.
Florida GOP @RepTedYoho: Best tool to fight poverty is a job. It’s a simple as that. Also want to lend support citrus greening research and merger of CSP and EQIP.
@RepAnnieKuster Kuster: Only have 10 legislative days to pass a new farm bill before current law expires Sept. 30.
New Hampshire Dem @RepAnnieKuster gets a happy birthday wish from @RodneyDavis.
Illinois GOP @RodneyDavis: When I speak to any business in my district, one of the biggest issue is lack of a skilled workforce. If not now, when? When do we make these investments in our work force
New Mexico Dem @RepLujanGrisham: Important the we support nutrition programs, find the balance between supporting farmers and protecting our environment.
Missouri GOP @RepHartzler: Farm bill needs full mandatory funding for FMD vaccine bank, common sense reforms to conservation. Top rural development need in my district is access to rural broadband.
@RepMcGovern McGovern: I get it. Beating up on poor people is easy. For some, it may play to their political base. But it’s wrong.
Massachusetts Dem @RepMcGovern: Let me do something I rarely do, I want to praise my colleagues in the Senate. Says House farm bill process was a very frustrating experience, is critical of SNAP language.
Georgia GOP @AustinScottGA08: Think it’s important that producers have options when choosing safety net programs. … One of my primary concerns is Senate language on actively engaged.
@RepMarciaFudge Fudge: Just as we shouldn’t turn our backs on farmers struggling through a down economy, we also shouldn’t turn our backs on hungry Americans.
Ohio Dem @RepMarciaFudge: For the record, and despite what you might hear from some of my colleagues, most of the people who are on SNAP who can work do work.
Alabama GOP @RepMikeRogersAL: What better time to build up an American workforce with increased job force training than when the American economy is booming?
RT @PhilipBrasher: Former House Ag Chair Lucas, without explicitly opposing House SNAP work rules, says he's waiting for results of pilot p…
Walz: How we approach the nutrition title is an issue of our moral character.
Minnesota Dem @RepTimWalz: Not a week goes by that a dairy farmer doesn’t come up and tell me that their 4th generation operation is in danger.
@SenJoniErnst Ernst: Can do better and fully fund the response program for foot and mouth disease vaccine bank.
Iowa GOP @SenJoniErnst: Senate bill includes priority provisions to reduce CRP rental rates, ensure that land being enrolled is environmentally sensitive.
@RepFrankLucas Lucas: Pundits in this town said when we were creating 2014 farm bill that prices were so good, we would never need a farm bill, but safety net has kicked in.
Former House Ag Chair @RepFrankLucas: Our responsibility is not to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors. Bad policy created the 1930s and 1980s.
@SenJohnHoeven Hoeven: Average age of a farmer is about 60. We’ve got to get these younger farmers on the land, have to do more with access to capital.
North Dakota GOP @SenJohnHoeven: More important than ever to pass a bill on time.
@RepJimCosta Costa: I will not be able to support a conference report that raises barriers to SNAP eligibility.
California Dem @RepJimCosta: Support fully funding specialty crop research and separately funding fight against citrus greening.
Heitkamp: We hear all about this great economy, guess where it isn’t; It isn’t in rural America.
North Dakota Dem Sen. Heidi Heitkamp: Farmers need the certainty of a farm bill. They need to know this body can deliver a farm bill on time. Will literally give them something to take to the bank.
Goodlatte: Hemp is something this farm bill should address.
Former House Ag Chair Bob Goodlatte: Merging CSP into EQIP results in comprehensive national program that can reach across the US and provide opportunity in all sectors of agriculture.
Boozman: We must ensure that our livestock and row crop producers retain access to EQIP.
Boozman: Have concerns that actively engaged policies in the Senate bill are policies that no farmer has asked for, think the House did a better job on this subject.
Scott: Let’s make sure nothing happens during these discussions that in any way would jeopardize the $95 million.
Georgia Dem @repdavidscott: Beginning farmers faced with new obstacles, and we have to do more to bring them into operation. Praises $95 million 1890 land grant program.
@SenSherrodBrown Brown: Some in this body think certain commodities are entitled to a USDA payment even when those commodities are above 10-year price highs.
Ohio Democrat @SenSherrodBrown: Troubling that the House passed a partisan farm bill. As McConnell said, we need to get a farm bill done this year.
House Ag vice chair Glenn Thompson: Time for SNAP to evolve to serve Americans better, and that includes strong work requirement and employment training language.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell jokes “I can’t remember the last time I appointed myself to a conference committee.”
.@HouseAgDems RM Collin Peterson: More than any one issue, I want to get a bill done, get a conference report we all can sign.
Stabenow: Know there are differences between our two bills, but also believe we can come together and get this done.
Stabenow: Should pursue meaningful payment limits as the Senate did.
Stabenow: Massive SNAP eligibility changes don’t make sense to me, don’t have support of the Senate or strong majority in the House.
.@SenateAgDems Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow: Know that feeding people in need and helping them find jobs doesn’t have to be a partisan issue, and it shouldn’t be.
Conaway: I’m willing to stay here nights and weekends to get this done.
.@HouseAgNews Chair Mike Conaway: Acknowledge differences between two bills, but see no reason we cannot produce a bill.
Roberts: To those who say passing a farm bill in this environment will be difficult, I say together we can get it done.
Roberts: I share the goal of work for SNAP recipients, and we can accomplish that goal by improving the program.
Roberts: Not an exaggeration to say the nation’s food and fiber supply hangs in the balance of what we do here today.
.@SenateAgGOP Chair Pat Roberts: Getting a farm bill done is paramount to any other concern. Very close to the finish line, but still a lot of work to do.

House Ag Chair @ConawayTX11 ends hearing by telling Giancarlo he has changed position on increased @CFTC funding, says agency needs more
Giancarlo says @CFTC watching the soybean futures market 'very, very carefully' because of tariffs
Giancarlo pressed by Fla Dem @DarrenSoto to describe impact of trade war on futures market: 'We are seeing volatility in markets .... pinpointing it to specific world events is difficult'
Giancarlo expresses concern that expansion in crop insurance has diminished farmer participation in the futures market. 'Healthy markets are markets with a lot of diversity'
Giancarlo defends scrapping @CFTC proposal to lower swap registration level from $8B to $3B, says that would have pushed local utilities, agribusinesses, banks out of the market, making users more dependent on Wall Street banks
More Giancarlo:  'The swaps market is a safer place than it was at the time of the crisis because of those reforms' implemented by @CFTC under Dodd-Frank
Giancarlo tells Democrat @RepAnnieKuster that swaps market is 'dramatically' better regulated than it was in 2008, thanks to Dodd-Frank
Giancarlo worried about Brexit impact on global economy because of unresolved issues with billions of $ in bilateral swaps contracts between British and EU entities
Giancarlo says he would not allow US clearinghouses to be forced to comply with EU law &amp;  EU would likely bar European funds from using the @CMEGroup, other US clearinghouses
Brexit led to changed EU approach to clearinghouse regulation, undermining 2016 US-EU agreement for mutual recognition of regulations, Giancarlo says
Giancarlo tells @RepFrankLucas that he shares concern that capital requirements are affecting market liquidity, has talked to Fed about it
Giancarlo: Europeans have fundamentally different approach to how the use of collateral by clearinghouses should be regulated - EU will allow political considerations
Giancarlo: EU has not backed off insistence that US futures clearinghouses comply with EU law as well as US
Giancarlo says @CFTC is functioning well &amp; in collegial fashion and has two new members awaiting Senate confirmation, which would fill the commission

Wheeler: Cannot forget that the U.S. is the gold standard worldwide for environmental protection.
Wheeler: Goal of making all permitting decisions within six months. I’m not suggesting that we approve all permits within a set amount of time, I’m suggesting that we make a decision.
Wheeler says he will continue Pruitt’s priorities on Superfund cleanup. Says President Trump asked him to pursue clean air, clean water, and regulatory relief.
Wheeler to EPA employees: When it comes to leadership, you can’t lead unless you listen … I value your input and feedback and you will find me and my team ready to listen.
Wheeler says he spent a lot of time lobbying for healthcare, pension benefits for coal miners. Says his grandfather was a coal miner. Says United Mine Workers endorsed his confirmation because of that work.
Wheeler on his time in lobbying: I had a number of clients. If you read in the press, I only had one. I did work for a coal company, and I’m not at all ashamed of the work I did for the coal company.
Wheeler to EPA employees: I do understand firsthand the stress that goes along with a change in management or a change in organization. I want you to know that I do understand that and I will do my best to reduce the stress that goes along with that.
EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler has taken the stage in an address to EPA employees. Announces Henry Darwin has taken on role as acting deputy administrator.

STORY: Senate Ag advances new farm bill, 20-1 https://t.co/f47OBr13sh
#Farms large and small could benefit from #cropinsurance tweaks. https://t.co/GIgd0v7YyT
The Senate Ag Committee has passed its version of the farm bill 20-1. Sen. Grassley the lone no vote.
Committee now considering amendments to Title I.
Thune withdraws amendment after getting assurances from Stabenow and Roberts to work on amendment through floor action.
Stabenow and Roberts suggest working on a floor amendment to accept parts of amendment rather than entire amendment including payment rate cut.
Thune introduces amendment that lowers CRP rental rate to 85 percent, but keeps at 88.5 percent on continuous contracts, addresses haying and grazing flexibility, an increase in the acreage cap.
Klobuchar introduces amendment to reauthorize energy title programs at 2014 levels and reimburse dairy farmers for MPP premiums. Back and forth with Boozman, but amendment passes on voice vote.
Klobuchar introduces, withdraws amendment addressing small refinery exemptions under the RFS. Grassley says Pruitt should exercise authority to reallocate waived gallons.
Klobuchar offers amendment that would give governors option of opting into sodsaver program in their own state 		Roberts says amendment strikes a good balance by leaving it up to the governors. 		Amendment passes on voice vote.
McConnell: We consulted with Justice Department, FDA, chair and ranking member of Judiciary Committee, incorporated a number of their suggestions.
Grassley notes objection to procedure on hemp amendment, says it is the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, which he chairs.
Klobuchar second degree amendment on the Hoeven amendment passes, as does the underlying Hoeven amendment.
Hoeven goes back to title 5, offers amendment to increase FSA loan guarantee rate.
Heitkamp amendment on Cuba trade passes by voice vote.
Committee now hearing amendments to Title III. Heitkamp offers amendment on Cuba trade.
No amendments to Title IIX, VII, VI, V, or IV.
Committee considering Title IX and passes Bennet biogas amendment by voice vote.
Title X cleared with no amendments.
Committee done with Title XII, no amendments to Title XI, but Sen. Stabenow says Sen. Klobuchar may offer an amendment when she returns from a different hearing.
Thune amendment to increase monitoring stations to address issues with drought data is passed by voice vote.
Committee considering Title XII. Sen. Fischer discussed an amendment on pesticide registrations, but did not ask for a roll call vote.
Committee will consider amendments by title in reverse, ending with Title I.
Opening statements have wrapped up, managers amendments and en bloc amendment pass by voice vote.
Sen. Joni Ernst: Must do more to help SNAP recipients rise up out of poverty. U.S. economy is booming right now, must seize this opportunity to help folks become self-sufficient.
Sen. Perdue: Solid common sense, fiscally responsible bill, but says he’s concerned about changes to Rural Utilities Service cushion of credit program and how cost of electricity could be impacted.
RT @PhilipBrasher: .@SenateMajLdr McConnell talking to Senate Ag about his hemp provisions in the draft #2018farmbill says it will be espec…
Sen. Daines: Believe the forestry title could be stronger. Believe we could do more to encourage active management.
McConnell on his hemp amendment: I think people by now have realized that this is not the other plant.
McConnell: We’ll get to the farm bill before July 4th. Hope the House can move a bill soon as well.
Roberts: Both leaders have committed that once we finish our business here, we can finish our business on the floor of the U.S. Senate
Roberts introduces Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, thanks him for working to move the bill quickly.
.@SenTinaSmith: Thankful this bill includes many of the proposals I have been working on, including maintaining the sugar program and improving the dairy safety net.
.@SenGillibrand: Don’t think we’ll get to vote on a pollinator amendment today, but might consider it on the floor.
@SenJohnThune Thune also says the committee will vote on an amendment today to raise the CRP acreage cap.
.@SenJohnThune: Made attempts to modify ARC, but simply ran out of time to get necessary changes through CBO. Feel we could have made some changes to this bill that would have resulted in better policy, but there are those who chose to put them off for another day.
Boozman says he’s also concerned about changes to food aid in the bill.
Sen. Boozman: I have concerns about changes to RCPP … fear we are opening the door to conservation dollars being directed to certain organizations rather than private dollars being leveraged.
.@SenStabenow found common ground to improve #SNAP integrity 'while preserving critical food access for millions of families in need'
.@SenStabenow Despite a tight budget 'we were still able to work together to protect some of the most important parts of the farm bill'
Senate Ag ranking Democrat @SenStabenow touts additional improvements to dairy's Margin Protection Program, $100M more funding
Roberts: To those who say it will be tough to enact a #2018farmbill - We must embrace the attitude of  our producers - optimism and ingenuity
.@SenPatRoberts says 66 amendments included in the manager's amendment that the committee will consider
Senate Ag Chair @SenPatRoberts US food and fiber production capability hangs in the balance with what we do here today
Grassley: Disappointed base bill does not include common sense reforms on program eligibility. Also dismayed that we do not have a CBO score.
Sen. Chuck Grassley the first to offer a statement. Speaking on CRP, he says farmers were especially incensed about being outbid for land from a government with a $20 trillion deficit.
Committee Chair Pat Roberts has gaveled in the meeting, and the markup is underway.

Pruitt says by the end of 2018, EPA will have processes in place to make sure decisions are made on permit requests submitted to the agency within six months.
Sen. Hyde-Smith asks Pruitt if new Office of Continuous Improvement will help with things like pesticide registration. Pruitt says it will in addition to meeting other statutory deadlines.
Pruitt says he does not recall instance of requesting use of sirens, lights on security vehicles.
Pruitt says he was not aware of tweet that mocked Democratic senators for their votes, says the agency should not have done that, but stops short of apologizing.
Pruitt: Plan is to address WOTUS withdrawal by third quarter of this year, have a replacement done by the end of the year. Anticipate new proposed definition to be released this month.
Pruitt says he’s instituted a new policy that any expenditure related to his official duties that exceeds $5,000 has to be approved by three high level officials at the EPA.
Pruitt: There have been decisions that looking back, I wouldn’t have made that decision. But some of the criticism relates to processes at the agency that were not properly followed.
Those protestors removed outerwear to show t-shirts that said “Impeach Pruitt” and walked out of the hearing room.
Pruitt: Indisputable that we have made enormous progress in achieving President’s reform agenda while improving environmental outcomes.
A small group of protestors hold up signs that say “Mr. Corrupt” as soon as Pruitt starts talking. Signs taken down immediately after warning from Capitol Police.
Leahy: A Vermonter told me Pruitt’s reason for flying first class over security concerns was silly. “Nobody even knows who you are."
Leahy: But the embarrassments these scandals have wrought continue, as does a patter of putting personal and special interests ahead of the well-being of the American people. (2/2)
