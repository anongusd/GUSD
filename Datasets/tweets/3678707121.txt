@cacameronGOP @noah_vilagi @marcorubio Maduro isn‚Äôt looking at Twitter. The American people are and our other allies. pictures like this are how support falters. Gaddafi was a monster but he was also he raped and murdered In the street.
@noah_vilagi @cacameronGOP @marcorubio It shouldn‚Äôt be squandered with flirtations with execution. The Gaddafi one was ridiculous to be promoted by a US senator.
@noah_vilagi @cacameronGOP @marcorubio Though honestly I don‚Äôt think these are constructive posts from Rubio. Romania was notorious for having one the more violent transitions from communism to liberalism. Their is bipartisan unity in congress and a coalition of South American support.

@JD___Robison Here is warren piece she wrote from foreign affairs which I also disagree with but I think is very close to Sanders in many regards. https://t.co/S7Dknn44Tc
@JD___Robison For example I support our pressure on the  Maduro regime and I am happy  sanders criticized  it. However he had no plan to act. There in no liberal opposition in many authoritarian nations but Venezuela has one and its not an opportunity to be squandered.
@JD___Robison Like Elizabeth warrens, at  first glance it seems like a very well defined liberal) in the international sense)view of our role  in the world. However once you get below the skin it gets a bit shakier especially when trying to push on the methods of ya implementing said vision.

@benjaminwittes @lawfarepodcast @lawfareblog A daily read of the most relevant article would be great or maybe a weekly editors pick of a few choice articles like the Economist podcast does.
@JD___Robison She‚Äôs scapegoated our intelligence professionals and state department as warmongers. I can accept criticism  of campaigns or decisions but to demonize the entire post war order is a thank you next for me.
@JD___Robison To be clear 5 meaning I will vote for any democrat but her like canvassing sheets lol. She met with Assad which is enough to make her someone not deserving the nomination. But also her views are way to non interventions for me.
@JacobAWohl Does your mom know what you‚Äôre up to? You know she gets worried about you. You may use her phone number again for another fake intelligence firm.
@JD___Robison However when that time comes I think some moderates in the mix will help  solidify a Democratic Party stance on our allies and role in the world. I‚Äôm a solid 3 on all candidates, even Bernie can win me back. Gabbard is my only true 5.
@JD___Robison No ifs not the best tine for moderates but they share a more traditional post war foreign policy view and even if they can‚Äôt win I‚Äôm hoping they pull the frontrunners towards that. No one wants to talk foreign policy so I‚Äôll have to wait until the debates for it to even come up.
@JD___Robison I‚Äôm hoping Hickenlooper or mike Bennet jumps in o think they can add something to the mixup.

as well as the civil contract between the people and its leaders. Don‚Äôt applaud the chaos that‚Äôs ensuing, instead for lack of a better word pray for France and pray for Europe.
France has had 5 republics in its history as well as empires, monarchs, fascists, and socialists in between. Revolution may as well be a part of its identity. However that doesn‚Äôt mean we need to applaud what is a tragic breakdown of law and order
France like all other nation states have a rich tapestry of culture and heroism while also having darker periods. No matter what you think of French politics or it‚Äôs leaders  this not sustainable.
I‚Äôve seen Fox News praise it as a populist insurgency on the liberal elites while on the left publications like Jacobin are praising the French Tradition of social revolution. Both sides seem to applaud the chaos that is ensuing.
French politics and the tradition of left and right are very different then than America. Different relations between monarchy, republicism, liberalism, nationalism, socialism. That being said the ‚Äúgilets jaunes‚Äù have elements that both the American left and right are praising.

I voted for McCain in 08. I was inspired by his service and constitution. My politics may have changed a lot since 08 but my admiration for the man never did.  Many principled conservatives I know say that the Republican Party will die in Arizona.
John McCain has passed away. He was was a deeply patriotic and decent man. Throughout the 08 campaign he didn‚Äôt allow the racist elements of his party take control. He confronted his own supporters and praised Obama as a good god loving family man.

Personally I feel that a lot of the attack on bankers and globalists relies on some antisemitic rhetoric. If you didn‚Äôt notice it that‚Äôs ok but a lot of the discussion is by people who did see it that way.
@plutotastic @AngryxGoat @SachiKnight @lucianaberger I personally can see where one can find antisemitism in the mural but that‚Äôs just what I see. Perhaps I‚Äôm over blowing it but it does look bad to me.
@plutotastic @AngryxGoat @SachiKnight @lucianaberger Usually the whole bankers controlling the world trope is deploy regarded as an antisemetic conspiracy theory. It may not seem like one now but these stories go back to the 19th and 20th centuary. Rothschild conspiracies date back to heavy antisemitism   against the family.
@plutotastic @AngryxGoat @SachiKnight @lucianaberger Im not sure about particular characters in the mural I‚Äôm only Stating what opponents are saying is wrong with it. I mean the idea of a caricature is that it doesn‚Äôt reflect how a group of people are diverse but instead a racist exaggeration. I know I feel gross looking at it.
@qjurecic Is there any more to this? What did they want with him?
@plutotastic @AngryxGoat @SachiKnight @lucianaberger The ‚Äúglobalists‚Äù have the stereotypical enlarged noses used in antismetic caricatures.
@federalreserve it be great if you could start linking to explainers on how the Fed works. So much of America are still filled with conspiracy theories. A federal reserve podcast would be great :)
@BillKristol been betting beers on the order of which cabinet officials will be leaving the White House. Your leaks have we won two in a row!!!
@JulianAssange Hostile is arbitrary but any state owned media company is by definition a foreign agent and be resisted as one. Their is no crime about being s foreign agent but it is a classification that does exist in our law.
@SecretaryCarson @HUDgov Maybe cut down on the table sets. That‚Äôll be a good start.
If firing a senior FBI agent 2 days before retirement was such a right thing to do, why was it done 10 on a Friday night?
@BillKristol I really appreciate that you are trying to find a nobler motive but I think it seems more likely sessions is just holding on to his job for sessions.
