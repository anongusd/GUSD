USGS scientists continue to investigate the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that rocked south central Alaska on Friday and are working closely with Alaskan state seismologists and emergency managers. Right now, aftershocks are at the forefront of discussion. 	https://t.co/GV6ddqHgLF
The USGS family also knows that earthquakes can be upsetting for people and will continue to provide information to help people stay safe and care for themselves and each other. (2/2)

@Donna4843 @YouTube 3/3 The more localized subsidence caused by lowering groundwater levels is a completely different process. These processes, in addition to others like tectonic movement, can change the elevation of land surface, and will continue to do so in the future.
@Donna4843 @YouTube 2/3 During droughts, terrestrial water volume is decreased (less weight), and the crust responds by uplifting. Conversely, during periods of more terrestrial water availability, the crust responds by lowering.
@Donna4843 @YouTube 1/2 Pacific Northwest, uplift is actually occurring throughout the west (not just PNW). The leading hypothesis is that the earth's crust flexes in response to water volume (isostasy).

@dancermommd To answer your other questions, the 4% figure refers to old-growth trees remaining after European colonization. The vast majority of these were felled around the time of the CA Gold Rush
@dancermommd Redwoods average about 500-700 years, but some can live up to 2,500 years. Old-growth in this sense means forest that has stood for hundreds of years. These forests have a much richer biodiversity than second-growth and younger tree stands.

Turbidites are sea-bottom deposits formed by massive slope failures.  These slopes fail in response to excessive sedimentation load and sometimes earthquake shaking, sending the sediments sliding down to the ocean bottom to create a turbidite. #Geology101 https://t.co/RofOBPOC6u https://t.co/iCYmheTnl3

@manar_rizk @cobonics It is highly likely there will be a M6.7 event or higher EQ along the SA in next 30 yrs. See this map: https://t.co/r82dKHAMFr.
@manar_rizk @cobonics Occurs w/ one tectonic plate sliding beneath another plate. Downgoing would be oceanic Cocos Plate (left) under N. American plate (right) https://t.co/tmHhKpmBLp
@cobonics EQ was normal faulting (extensional) within the subducting Cocos Plate
@manar_rizk No, its more likely to cause continuing aftershocks within few hundred km of main event
@ChiefFaceroll The M8.1 event has nothing to do with hurricanes in the Atlantic. This is ongoing subduction of the Cocos Plate under NA Plate

@DesantaFrankie The scale doesn't go up that high.

@RomanSteele2 Check the eruptive histories (that include VEI) for volcanoes here https://t.co/6IzthMIf4l
@120codex Checking this scale even the highest VEI eruption would be unlikely to reach the East Coast with ash.
@volcano_ben @MtStHelensNVM Glad you enjoyed it.
@adityanag2002 @USGSBigQuakes You're very welcome.
