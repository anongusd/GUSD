@Maggyw519 @DavidShuster You know, I left a lot of the Bernie fb groups because of crazy conspiracy theories and such. Glad to see it's not just us Bernie Bros/Gals who come up with that sort of madness.
@davidslavick Not that there is much to gain from explaining nuance to these people anyway.
@davidslavick Eh, libel must be proven to be malicious with public figures, it can't merely be incorrect, though. Trump wants to "reform" those laws, so who knows what will happen.

@PriceActionTool @SadiqKhan @AlertTrade Um... London wanting to ban certain advertisements on public property is no different than any other organization doing so. Are you against free speech because you don't want a Mars Bar ad on top of your house?
@natalie_allison Just looked in my 80-yo family Bible, with two of my Confederate 3x great-grandfathers... nope literally nothing about the civil war. I'll have to scour my contacts for my few non-communist friends to get them to check theirs.
@KneeGrowPleaze @CRonin565 @livemusic4me @justicedems @Marshall4House Um... sorry to say that she did none of those things. She's supporting the nominee. They both argued for their experience and platform, and now they will both fight for Democrats up and down the ballot.

@lessig Relevant to all the folks rejecting big PAC money: What power do they actually have to say no to it? Can't these PACs work without their permission?

@biephiephus @Redistrict @BillKristol tbh, I don't think that they are as interested in our midterms. Putin wanted to destabilize us, and was afraid of HRC from her time as SoS.
