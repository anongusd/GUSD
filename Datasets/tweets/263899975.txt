@VP @POTUS Your tax reform helps u @realDonaldTrump &amp; others who make money and get the tax brks give tax breaks to those living payck to payck
@SpeakerRyan Prove it your tax reform is beneficial to those who are billionaires @realDonaldTrump not those who work for them
@SenateGOP Giving tax breaks to billionaires @realDonaldTrump isn't helping those who live payck to payck give it to those who need it

@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump wants to pay less taxes then he does or does he pay taxes?&amp;tax to death those living pay check to paycheck
@SenToomey @pastatenaacp And as for civil rights this administration is horrible
@SenToomey @pastatenaacp Your only goal is to pass impassable bills you really have let your constituents down Hlthcr was a bad deal now lower txs for billionaires
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump and his billionaire buddies don't need tax relief those who live pay check to paycheck need tax reform
@realDonaldTrump You just sign a bill to lessen FEMA those poor people I pray for TX&amp;LA
@HouseGOP DidYouKnow we r not interested in txbreaks for @realDonaldTrump and billionaires the person who lives check to check should get the benefits

@SenateGOP @SenatorLankford You use the insurance you want the Americans to have and I'll have yours- deal??????
@StateDept Why is this your major concern with Russia? Respect is being honest so let's get on with the open testimony of those who had meetings wthem
@WhiteHouse @POTUS No the bill that you proposed would have failed the people. Thank God for those who voted their conscience and not party lines
@VP @POTUS Well then You use the insurance as written and give us a better one
@realDonaldTrump @dekelley14 They DID THEY VOTED THIS HORRIBLE BILL DOWN!!! Thanks you to the senators who voted their conscience rather then party
@FoxNews @dekelley14 They need to do what right for the constituents that voted them in. I'm glad for those who have done this

@TheView We have become the nation of idiots to Russians. Who can blame them?
@NewtTrump @dekelley14 The. Testify and have trump testify and throw in Clinton this is ridiculous
@WhiteHouse Nothing there from the trump corp - they pay about five cents an hour to countries SHAME ON THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR TRYING TO PULL THIS ONE

@POTUS @WhiteHouse And all your crap has made in China Bangladesh- I can go on
@GovernorTomWolf What a narcissist fool
@FriendlyJMC @dekelley14 I believe he should do more.  We agree to disagree
@SenToomey For someone who claims to care about vets children elderly and the disadvantaged you sure have a lot to learn
@FriendlyJMC @dekelley14 But leading by example is best
@FriendlyJMC @dekelley14 Factory about 10 miles from me cost more but they do great work. Unfortunately they are looking at closing their plant
@FriendlyJMC @dekelley14 He should lead so others follow - allow manufacturers in US to do his lines
@GOP @PAGOP Celebrating the great out doors by allowing less laws for a greener planet. Get a grip you really shouldn't say this unless foolishness
@GOP @PAGOP Foolish smoke screen - he doesn't use Americans nor does his daughter to make there wears. Lead by example oh wait that's no this admstrn
@HouseGOP For who? The billionaire or the everyday man???
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Hope your budget doesn't flounder like healthcare  it's just sickening how this administration is working
@StateDept Then you need to do more sanctions to several more countries in that area.  We the people are getting tired of this nonsense
@realDonaldTrump Write bills that help and not hurt - you try using that healthcare. Wait you don't care all you want is what you consider victories.
@StateDept And what about those who housed the terrorist of 9/11 - your sending him over there to make nice.  Think before you do and tweet
We the people are possed off

@realDonaldTrump 36% put aside your narcissism for a bit a look around. We the people are pissed off
@VP @dekelley14 @POTUS Then why do you stand against giving all Americans affordable healthcare that isnt barebones? Start here
@WhiteHouse Hard to even say that with a straight face when trump industry uses poorest of poor to make his over priced items givethe work to Americans
@WhiteHouse Then have trump industry produce American goods.  How two faced can one be? He has enough let the American workers gain too
So it goes https://t.co/rVUSq2i1Em
