Here at Aqua Creek in Missoula where thanks to tax cuts, Brian hired new folks and is expanding their facility. Can't argue with those RESULTS... yet that's exactly what @jontester voted AGAINST. #DefeatTester #MontanaFirst #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/VpxqMdqBVI
GREAT first stop on our #MontanaFirst tour! Glad to visit with the hardworking folks at the Cost Care Clinic this morning in Missoula. Montanans deserve affordable health care options! #AmericaFirst #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/W1yAIVsF2w

If we want to put an end to these disgraceful and shameful tactics used by Democrats then we ALL have a responsibility to defeat @JonTester this November! #KavanaughConfirmation #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol
Time and time again, @JonTester has proven that he stands with the LIBERAL RESISTANCE over President Trump and Montanans. #KavanaughConfirmation #mtsen #mtpol
With his NO vote, Senator @JonTester¬†made it clear that he would rather stand with the far-left, who will do anything to destroy someone for political gain, than with the people of Montana. #KavanaughConfirmation #mtsen #mtpol
Our nation achieved a great victory today - the U.S. Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Despite the liberal smears and politics of personal destruction, a good man and a great judge is now on the highest¬†court of the land. #KavanaughConfirmation #mtsen #mtpol
RT @aaronflint: #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/xUbAYnBqUu
A GREAT victory today! Brett Kavanaugh was CONFIRMED to the Supreme Court! @JonTester voted NO. It's time to send #TwoFacedTester back to his farm for GOOD THIS NOVEMBER!!!¬†#MAGA #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/Fj0fOwVozA

Beautiful evening at the Townsend Fall Festival and grateful to spend some time with Rep. Kelly Flynn. Keep fighting! #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/JO4fDD4tZH
Join us this Saturday (tomorrow) in Billings for a Rally in support of Brett Kavanaugh! While @JonTester is voting against Montana, we will be STANDING WITH KAVANAUGH! https://t.co/pF0QKYYJGp #ConfirmKavanaugh #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol
#FBF ---&gt; @JonTester cites PATRIOT Act for Kavanaugh opposition.		Best part? Backed PATRIOT Act supporter Hillary Clinton for President.		Tester: "Hillary is the most qualified person on the ballot."		#TwoFacedTester #DefeatTester #ConfirmKavanaugh #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/bUwPPKJCAU
WOW - @JonTester's SuperPAC allies misleading Montanans but remember folks, #TwoFacedTester doesn't like money in politics ... #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/gJkzzCGtfb
We've had enough of the smear and destroy tactics from Senate Democrats. It's time to put an end to this and confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. #ConfirmKavanaugh #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/gWLUZX8OQQ
Folks, @JonTester's opposition to Brett Kavanaugh proves that he's become another Washington Democrat who puts the liberal resistance above the people of Montana. #ConfirmKavanaugh #mtsen #mtpol
CLAIM: @JonTester blamed WH for cancelling his meeting with Kavanaugh | FACT: WH did NOT cancel the meeting ... "Tester's staff reviewed its records and confirmed the White House account." #ConfirmKavanaugh #DefeatTester #TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/MQccwuZkq5

.@KellyannePolls is right. @JonTester and his Senate Democrat friends will SMEAR &amp; DESTROY simply to derail President Trump's nominees. That's unacceptable to me.  https://t.co/XMEavYOl7y #TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol
24 hours later and @JonTester still has NOT apologized for calling us "Fake Montanans." Classic Washington Democrat .... #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/lV9dqJVuH9
The Liberal Smear: @JonTester created it with Ronny Jackson, the Democrats have perfected it with Judge Kavanaugh #ConfirmKavanaugh #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/pHleyR7fca
This is just who @JonTester is ... He says he will protect our #2A BUT then confirms judges who will TAKE OUR GUNS AWAY! That's NOT protecting our Montana values! #TwoFacedTester #DefeatTester #MAGA #AmericaFirst #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/Bqgdwe2mZ5
Since @JonTester‚Äôs voting NO on Brett Kavanaugh then Montana needs to VOTE NO ON TESTER this November!!! https://t.co/ne0fDRrbjO #ConfirmKavanaugh #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol
The Democrats smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh is a DISGRACE! That's why we need to stand together and #ConfirmKavanaugh!! #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/SJZimwpPaf
The lies from #TwoFacedTester carry on ... @JonTester talks tough on border security YET he called Trump's border wall a 'waste of taxpayer dollars.' Tester's WRONG- We need to #BuildTheWall!!! #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/tNwnjMRZgS
We need to stand AGAINST the obstruction and smear campaigns and WE NEED TO #ConfirmKavanaugh!! All @JonTester does is OPPOSE President Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominees. Montanans deserve better. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/3Iva6tDNok

Glad to have you back in Montana, Mr. Vice President!! #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/MiyYY3wznf
Welcome to Montana @pdoocy! Great conversation this morning on why we need to #ConfirmKavanaughNow &amp; RETIRE Swampy @jontester this November!!! #MAGA #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/HOyz5jmnW7
More #TwoFacedTester ---&gt; @JonTester says he opposes sanctuary cities then he votes THREE times to PROTECT sanctuary cities. It's time we #DefeatTester!!! #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/VNzwQl2Z7n
Montana has God‚Äôs greatest gifts and they belong to all of us. That‚Äôs why I'll always fight to protect and expand access to our public lands. This is the #LastBestPlace ‚Äì let‚Äôs keep it that way! #PublicLands #MAGA #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/ez87Y3gmGG
.@JonTester promised Montanans he would meet with Kavanaugh- he NEVER did and he LIED about it. We've had enough of this smear campaign and political circus. We need to #ConfirmKavanaughNOW!! #TwoFacedTester #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/IvwUaksRUp
Say what you want @jontester, but since you‚Äôve been in office, you‚Äôve raised the debt ceiling 11 TIMES!!! #TwoFacedTester #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/zEG0c7QQJT
Washington changed @JonTester. He became intoxicated with power and privilege. That‚Äôs why we need term limits and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôll only serve two terms. I‚Äôll get the job done and come home. #MontanaFirst #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/vgaksMxmau
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt deny that @JonTester's the NUMBER ONE recipient of lobbyist contributions across the nation, more than Nancy Pelosi and more than Chuck Schumer.‚Äù #DrainTheSwamp #TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol
Did @JonTester miss this headline ---&gt;  Washington Free Beacon: Tester Opposed to Dark Money Benefits From Group Spending $1.3 Million https://t.co/9HtSAR8TUQ #TwoFacedTester #mtpol #mtsen
Interesting hearing this from @jontester when his dark money groups are spending MILLIONS to help his campaign. #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/QbFBjX64hK
Just a sample of @JonTester's SuperPAC and dark money allies spending millions to prop up his campaign ‚Ä¶.		End Citizens United: $2 million		Majority Forward: $1.3 million 	 	LCV: $1 million 	 	Chuck Schumer‚Äôs SuperPAC: $1 million 		#TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol
To listen to @JonTester talk about secure borders ... 		Opposes the border wall.		Protects sanctuary cities.		Backs catch and release.		Enough already!		#MAGA #AmericaFirst #DefeatTester #mtpol #mtsen
All you need to know: @JonTester #1 recipient of lobbyist cash. Number 1 out of ALL 535 members of Congress. Imagine that! #DrainTheSwamp #mtsen #mtpol
The vote @jontester cast for #Obamacare gave us SKYROCKETING premiums that made health care completely UNAFFORDABLE for Montanans. #mtpol #mtsen
I'm taking on Big Pharma to expose their secret contracts and lower the price of prescription drugs for Montanans. #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol
Does @JonTester really want to talk about premium increases?! He GAVE US these premium increases. It‚Äôs called #Obamacare. #mtsen #mtpol
Save Montanans money ... that's what @jontester promised. #Obamacare isn't saving money for the people of Montana! #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/QRTLs3kUD4
"Everyone in the state knows that @JonTester brought us #Obamacare. He was the deciding vote." #mtsen #mtpol
11X @JonTester. You increased the debt ceiling 11X. You can‚Äôt hide from a record like that. #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol
Montana is the Last Best Place and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll always support and expand access to our public lands. Montana First ‚Äì always! #MAGA #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol
This is @JonTester‚Äôs record when it comes to Supreme Court Justices ‚Ä¶. He ONLY backs Obama‚Äôs extreme liberal anti-#2A judges. #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/sqRgnJovps
The debate starts momentarily .... Be sure to tune in now and hear more about my vision for Montana: https://t.co/sqXfvN9wpU #MontanaFirst #mtpol #mtsen
Ahh yes, let's not forget about this .... #TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/BcNaN3xKgj
This is ALL you need to know about @jontester...	#MAGA #TrumpCountry #TwoFacedTester #AmericaFirst #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/2rd6zUb2Sq
If we want to drain the swamp, we can't send @jontester back to his million-dollar swamp home. #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #AmericaFirst #MontanaFirst #TwoFacedTester #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/k98doTCU8o
Only 39 more days and then we're done with @JonTester's lies!!! He told Montanans he'd 'put politics aside' on Kavanaugh but he didn't. Tester's opposing Kavanaugh's nomination! #TwoFacedTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/EoFqcpMjhg
This is laughable. Jon Tester is totally against dark money in politics, unless it's being spent on his behalf. Be honest with the people of Montana. 	https://t.co/icE8YUhVr9 #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/1d4FQsjV6K
KEY PHRASE: "Not a surprise." We ALWAYS knew that @jontester would stand with Chuck Schumer and Washington Democrats over the people of Montana. 100% for Obama's SCOTUS nominees; 0% for Trump's nominees. The choice is clear in November. #MAGA #ConfirmKavanaughNow #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/zkzYyF1R0T
We stand with Kavanaugh. #ConfirmKavanaughNow #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/Pt8jz6JB2O
Remember- @JonTester OPPOSED Pro #2A Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. So, why would he treat Brett Kavanaugh any differently? #ConfirmKavanaughNow #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/HL5gpBaDMn
Is it Election Day YET?! @JonTester said he would NOT rely on Dark Money .... BUT .... $1.3 Million in DARK MONEY is being spent to HELP his campaign!!! #TwoFacedTester #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/hdQytEj1ir
#ConfirmKavanaughNow https://t.co/L426QInjWK
This 11th-hour political circus to destroy a good man's reputation &amp; hurt his family is disgraceful. The Senate should immediately vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. #ConfirmKavanaughNOW #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/UJzMCBtSeK
How Senate Democrats handled these allegations have been harmful not only to Judge Kavanaugh and his family but to Dr. Ford as well. #ConfirmKavanaughNOW #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/eFJF52Zhbk
From the very beginning, Senate Democrats made the decision to oppose Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination and do WHATEVER IT TAKES to keep him off the bench. Rather than seek the truth, they engaged in a SMEAR process plain and simple. #ConfirmKavanaughNOW #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol
Bob, we are going to fix the problems at the VA and deliver to all our Montana veterans the health care they were promised. Thank you for your support! #MAGA #AmericaFirst #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/vnK43wLR7A

Exactly | ‚Äú@JonTester pretends to be a hunter &amp; outdoorsman. The only problem is the last time he bought a hunting license was the last time he was up for re-election. He doesn‚Äôt actually hunt, he just shows up for the photo op.‚Äù -DTJ https://t.co/ISVN9Ew4TP #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol

Only 47 days to go and #TwoFacedTester is still saying one thing, doing another. @JonTester claims he listens to the people of Montana but he REALLY listens to CHUCK SCHUMER 89% of the time!!! #MAGA #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/TAQ4DZKGNV

Want more proof that @JonTester has changed? Talks about importance of hunting but rarely hunts. Says one thing, does another. That's the #TwoFacedTester way!! https://t.co/nxbXhcDeyM #MAGA #MontanaFirst #mtsen #mtpol
With 50 days until the election, we thought it'd be a good time to remind Montanans EVERY DAY of the 50 LIES #TwoFacedTester has told all of us. Starting at #50 ... All @JonTester's lobbyist cash! #DefeatTester #MAGA #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/oAmYPvO2Nh

The swamp has changed @JonTester ‚Ä¶ Collecting $1.1 million from lobbyists. Top recipient of their cash! Can you imagine! #DrainTheSwamp #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/NVOJyznUED
This is how extreme @JonTester has become... He shut down the government earlier this year to try and grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Think about that. He's not representing our Montana values! #AmericaFirst #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/ehVgXd2CZf
Jon, you don‚Äôt even realize it do you?? ‚Ä¶ YOU ARE THE SWAMP!		SuperPACs and Dark Money groups are spending MILLIONS to HELP YOU! Hypocrite!!

Instead of cracking down on illegal immigrants, @JonTester supports the dangerous policy of ‚ÄúCatch¬†and¬†Release‚Äù... and he opposes BUILDING THE WALL!¬†	How about we put #AmericaFirst‚Äì not illegal immigrants!	#MAGA #DefeatTester #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/OP29gz7GAV

You deserve MORE JOBS and you absolutely should be able to keep more of your HARD-EARNED MONEY ... So, think about this: @JonTester voted AGAINST lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for Montanans - that's NOT putting #MontanaFirst. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/VqXA8vFK0u
FACT CHECKING @JonTester's new commercial. The result ... LIES!!!¬†Don't listen to #TwoFacedTester! We're going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!! #DefeatTester #MAGA #mtsen #mtpol https://t.co/3hR5aYetcb
