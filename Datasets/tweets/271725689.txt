@thejoelstein @cassandrabarry Wow. Thank you for this. I am not alone! I KNEW it!
You know what would make childrens birthday parties better? If nobody ever had them, and nobody ever had to go to one. http://t.co/GPNWcLWX
A lot of grown ups had grape scented stools this morning.

I hope my taxi driver is sitting in a soiled diaper right now, because if not, there is no excuse for what he has just put me through.

@herbadmother @AllanaHarkin When I hear people say things like "raisins are Nature's candy" I know we are going to have a problem.

@canadiancomedy Thank you SO MUCH. This is both an honor, and for my Canadian friends, an honour.
@robdelaney @AnaGasteyer Awww. The stuff dreams are made of.
@AnaGasteyer will agree with me on this: green tea tastes like somebody else's toenails boiled along with a bunch of forest twigs.
I just *addressed* a pimple between my eyebrows and unintentionally gave myself a bindi. I think it makes me look very wise.

@jianghomeshi it's my dream to open a butter-tarts-only restaurant here in NYC! Let's go into business together!
I can't see out of my own eyeballs. I would stab someone for a tiny bag of used coffee grounds right now.
Trying to give up coffee, starting today. Sometimes I surprise myself with how stupid my own ideas can be.

@wilnervision That's right. The flight scheduled 2 hours later than mine is departing. @aircanada genius level business model. Twitter War!
@wilnervision I don't see you. Are you hiding somewhere?
Is there a reason why beverages can't be cold at airports? Do happy, hydrated people make airplanes fall out of the sky?

Ideal petting zoo combination (based on child's interest): shark, wolf, man-eating dinosaur. Also: fuck llamas.
Why are there llama's at children's petting zoos? All they do is give you the evil giant eyeball and daydream about trampling your children
On second thought, chemical combination may have just created mustard gas in my mouth. Please don't tell anyone how I died.
