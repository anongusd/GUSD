#AChristmasPrince you‚Äôre in a fucking palace stop wearing chucks! At least invest in some tasteful flats! Jesus!
#AChristmasPrince seriously where are they finding these clothes? I haven‚Äôt seen a women‚Äôs mini button Henley in a store in at least a decade.
#AChristmasPrince so many questions. Why is he wearing tights? Did they take the queen on a toboggan ride? Why does no one have a warm coat? Why does Amber have two of the same ugly ass coat in two different colors? Why is there a random wolf? Wtf was the budget for this movie?
