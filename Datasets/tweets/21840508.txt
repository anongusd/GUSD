And, interestingly, the complaint was sent to the press before the FPPC even had time to review it or send a copy to @jlwedel
It is telling that Mr. Cassano (who is a donor/endorser of @jlwedel 's opponents) amended his report just a few days b4 filing the complaint
The complaint against @jlwedel is completely without merit - it is hard to believe that Walnut Creek has sunk so low.
