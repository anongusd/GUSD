While Chuck and Nancy used their primetime address to attack President @realDonaldTrump, the President used the moment to highlight both the plight of American families affected by illegal immigration and the perilous journey for illegal immigrants. 		What a contrast!

Final takeaway for this evening...		Never underestimate my home state and story of #ElectionNight 2018: Florida! ‚òÄÔ∏è
It is now undeniable: President @realDonaldTrump was our closer, our game changer at the @GOP in so many of these key races. 		We faced close polling and at times deficits in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee and elsewhere, but the President rallied and we prevailed!
Governor Rick Scott is soon to be SENATOR Rick Scott!		My 18-year-long dream of replacing Bill Nelson has finally come true! @ScottforFlorida has earned the trust of Florida voters and will be an incredible addition to the U.S. Senate. 		Thank you Florida voters! #ElectionNight
History was made!		The @GOP will expand our Senate majority, picking up 2-4 seats in one cycle alone.		In 80 years, the sitting President‚Äôs party has only picked up 7 seats collectively in midterms... over 8 decades!		The political tailwinds of @realDonaldTrump are powerful! https://t.co/xjtbVRg3KE

Why are Dems so averse to protecting US citizens? Case in point:	(1) Shut down govt for illegal immigrants at expense of healthcare funding for 9 mil US children 	(2) No border wall funding to protect us from MS-13 &amp; no fix to loopholes that cause family separation	FIX THIS DEMS!
Democrats need to stop trying to score cheap political points and get to work ‚Äî let‚Äôs protect American citizens from the ravages of MS-13, end the devastating congressional loopholes that require family separation, and find a deal on DACA. Stop politicizing, start working Dems!
