@AngrierWHStaff I thought about it a lot also. What bothers me the most about Meadow's tirade was not that he brought up his relatives of color,it was when he said very few people know of it. While it may not be true,he made it sound like he has hidden them until he could make a political point.

@ChrisCuomo It's true.  Any action taken by the legal team is because of the client's decision to take said action.  Lawyers represent their client,  they aren't the client.
