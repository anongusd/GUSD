King led a disruptive, radical, bold, resistance movement, one intent on structural &amp; social change. Today, we celebrate the impact of the resistance movement of the 1960's. However, at the time, many considered the movement's work to be "unwise and untimely". Sound familiar?
This weekend we celebrate the example of Martin Luther King Jr., a man &amp; a movement which provides us a blueprint. Organize. Mobilize. Legislate. The "resistance" of today is the evolution of King's movement building work.
These unprecedented &amp; uncertain times demand unprecedented organizing &amp; mobilizing, just as we did to preserve the #ACA, to affirm #BLM, the rights of our #transgender community, the urgency of #guncontrol &amp; so many other issues of consequence to our country &amp; to #MA7
The "resistance"of which I speak is a multi-generational, multi-racial/cultural, multi-abled, cis, trans, queer intersectional coalition of community/movement builders, grassroots orgs &amp; ldrs who collectively seek to advance a policy agenda to realize equity, justice &amp; equality. https://t.co/0WizJJkHgm

By intentionally raising our children to not perpetuate these evils actively OR to be complicit in silence. And by electing leaders who will resist in #MA &amp; in Washington #vote #midterms
We will not allow anyone to erase someone's identity, or to deny someone citizenship by birthright, or to keep children separated from their families. We defeat #whitesupremacy #antisemitism #homophobia #xenophobia #sexism #racism by calling it out every time.
I am also reminded, (especially today) of the laughter &amp; innocence of children, and the power of love. We can only defeat hate with love. And we will only defeat systemic racism &amp; oppression by dismantling discriminatory policies &amp; passing new, fair, just &amp; inclusive ones.
tagged on their building. Today is #Halloween &amp; it reminds me that the scariest elements of society are too often wearing a mask---and when the monster of its bigotry and hate reveal itself--we feel betrayed, hurt, afraid &amp; fragile.
Locally, we're still mourning 8 #Boston lives we lost in 10 days due to #gunviolence, along with 2 lives lost in #Kentucky &amp; 11 in #Pittsburgh bc of racist and anti-semitic #hatecrimes. Just today, students at one of our #BPS schools were met with Black racial epithets graffiti
which feels welcoming &amp; safe for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, identity expression, faith or religious practice, where everyone is safe in their workplace, neighborhood, at their school or place of worship.
Have fun today. Today is #Halloween &amp; #RedSox parade after all. Have fun with the kids, celebrate our champions--&amp; then tomorrow let's get back to work. I look forward to the day when we can clap &amp; cheer that our city is one

And please, stop saying "#BrettKavanaugh is a "good man". This characterization is no evidence of his innocence. Good people do evil things everyday &amp; most perpetrators are not strangers hiding behind bushes waiting to attack, they are people we know &amp; trusted, just like our govt
This #KavanaughVote is a blow to the integrity of the United States Senate, a permanent black eye on the institution and a betrayal to every #survivor
He is a threat to our #civilrights to the rights of #women #immigrants #workers #POC #Kavanaugh His track record proves he lacks the impartiality &amp; his testimony that he lacks the temperament to serve on the highest court.
From the very beginning this #KavanaughConfirmation process has been plagued by a lack of transparency. Justice should not be a partisan issue. And I am supremely confident that this nominee can deliver none. He has proven himself to be unhinged, unfit and unqualified.
Survivors matter and we do vote--and run for office too!  We have been ignored, but not silenced #midterms A vote to support #Kavanaugh confirms more than one man, to the highest court in the land, you are also confirming #privilege #entitlement #injustice
Our perpetrators tried to stifle our voices too--and, WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. We will not be silenced or moved. Today, survivors will keep organizing, sharing our painful and hard truths until the very last hour, and then we'll take our fight to the ballot box.
I went to bed feeling betrayed--perhaps even enraged. I woke up, still feeling betrayed--but resolved. I still believe #AnitaHill. I still believe #ChristineBlaseyFord I still believe #survivors #women They have knocked us down, but not out. I still believe in the power of us.

I recall when my stepfather (who has been deaf since he was 6yo) was on a train during 9/11 &amp; people began screaming &amp; rushing off of the train. He had no idea what was happening. Announcements about what was happening &amp; what to do were only made on the sound system.
We all need to better understand &amp; communicate to the public, what are the #evacuation plans (in the event of a city emergency, including extreme #weather) for persons w mobility challenges, those who are visually impaired/blind, hard of hearing/deaf in #BPS, city bldgs etc
It should not take 45mins to onboard one #wheelchair onto an #MBTA train or shuttle bus. People should have more than one access point to a building &amp; not be limited to one side or door of entry, so long as it does not conflict with fire codes or create new security risks
it is also about all those with physical challenges, those who are visually impaired/#blind, hard of hearing/#deaf, &amp; the #elderly continuing to be considered &amp; integrated into our #planning &amp; #development, supporting their #mobility, #safety, #dignity &amp; self agency

This week, I released the #CriminalJustice section of my #MA7 Equity Agenda. This plan will: 		- End juvenile life without parole	- #EndCashBail	- End for-profit prisons	- Require automatic, independent investigations for police-involved shootings	- Protect women in custody
In MA, Black &amp; Latino residents make up 17% of the population but account for a majority of inmates. In the #MA7, black residents are incarcerated at 6 times the rate of white residents. And low-income/minority communities account for a disproportionate # of inmates.
The disparities in the system are not new. They are not secret. 		- 2.3 million people sit in US prisons and jails.  	- 60% of people behind bars have never been convicted of any crime. 	- Women are its fastest growing population. 		This amounts to $182B in spending each year. https://t.co/s7JvuUpzYe
#PrisonReform is not an abstract issue for me -- it's personal. I believe in justice and dignity for all. I believe that the solutions live in the lives of those most impacted. 		That is why, I stand in solidarity with all of the inmates taking part in the national #PrisonStrike. https://t.co/TOuYmUfitM

(11/11) but this is what I mean by, "THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PAIN SHOULD BE THE CLOSEST TO THE POWER, DRIVING &amp; INFORMING THE POLICYMAKING". It's about #cooperative #governing &amp; developing #solutions in #partnership with the people most impacted by an issue #MA7 #changecantwait
(10/11) I co-convened a working group for 2years, resulting in  recommendations &amp; an amendment to the BRJP which grew the # of #women in the #building #trades 3x what it had been, &amp; 50% of those #women are women of color I could further elaborate, &amp; I will
(9/11) (E) When I wanted to better understand how to strengthen the Boston Residents Job Policy (BRJP) to grow the number of women &amp; POC in the trades, good union paying jobs, critical to closing the wealth &amp; wage gap,
(8/11) &amp; worked diligently with 2 Mayors, the Boston City Council &amp; State Legislature to reform a 100 year old law making it easier for #restaurants to open in historically underserved communities &amp; to be owned by #women, #immigrants &amp; #POC, creating dozens of #restaurants #jobs
(7/11) (D) When I wanted to better understand how to address the #disparities in walkable #amenities in the form of #neighborhood sit down #restaurants I invited aspiring restauranteurs &amp; other stakeholders to the table
(6/11) resulting in the creation of a bereavement room at Boston Medical Ctr, better coordination of services &amp; a spotlight to support impacted families in their #trauma
(5/11)  this resulted in the 1st City Council hearing in history which was "listening-only" forcing lawmakers, providers &amp; city agencies to listen to 300+ families about their #trauma from fatal &amp; non-fatal shootings
(4/11) (C) When I wanted to better understand how to support #families impacted by #gunviolence after dozens of vigils, funerals &amp; community mtgs w/grieving families, I went to @LDBpeaceInst &amp; asked them
(3/11) (B) When I wanted to better understand why we were seeing an increase in #bicyclist &amp; motor vehicle collisions, I contacted @bostonbikeunion I invited them to share their stories &amp; struggles, 4 hrgs later, we had a crash data report &amp; the 1st sideguard ord. in the country

This ruling underscores the need to fully repeal the Hyde Amendment and guarantee women access to reproductive health care -- including abortion services -- regardless of their financial situation.
These tactics are coercive and unacceptable. This decision by the Supreme Court is terribly disappointing, and will harm women across the country who are in need of accurate, unbiased medical information and care.
Access to healthcare is a human right. So-called ‚Äòcrisis pregnancy centers‚Äô oftentimes engage in deceptive strategies that target at-risk women and withhold information about the full range of medical options available to them while posturing as medical professionals.
Let us be clear: the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling this week about crisis pregnancy centers was not about freedom of speech, it was about disenfranchising women, specifically low-income women and women of color. https://t.co/wWEjKxGdVC

Congestion and traffic affects cars, but we need to examine and think about how it affects buses as well.
This sort of unreliability is incredibly destabilizing for students trying to get to school, workers trying to get to a job that they could lose if they‚Äôre late, and for parents getting home to spend time with their families.
The 111 bus has the 3rd highest ridership of any line in the MBTA system, carrying nearly 12,000 riders per day. Of those riders, 63% are people of color, and 46% don‚Äôt have access to a drivers license. It travels 2.7 miles and can take up to 45 minutes.
Today, our campaign released the transportation plan of our equity agenda to tackle this and so many other issues relating to inequality in access to high-quality and reliable transit. Check it out here! https://t.co/ZFVnr4gEm7
