US Congress laughs behind his back while shaking his hand in hopes of avoiding a constitutional crisis. They know he is a quack but he has enough support among you yoyos that they won't speak up, violating thr oath of office.	but what comes around goes around,
He is an embarrassment to every American:	conservative	liberal	republican	democrat	every sane person old enough 2 know right from wrong	screw party bulls^it	everyone knows how horrid his unconstitutional policies are	every other country in the world is either laughing or crying
it is followers of his bigotry like u make him more of a monster, stroking his ego like a terrier on a table leg. It is the 30% of u who call urself Americans that cause legislators 2 fear him. His regime will go down in history as the worst+his policies suck like hoes he hates.
The man has no idea Wtf he is doing AND refuses to be advised by individuals who DO know what they r doing. Kim Jung Un is laughing his ass off while stowing nukes in plain site wondering how else he can get over on our POTUS with the acting personality of a 15 yr old teen.
I have more things on my mind than my personal affinity 4 a POTUS who cannot read, spell, or acknowledge his shortcomings. He belittles every1 in his path. When he wants something, he smiles at you. After he is done with u, he throws u under the bus + refuses 2 pay ur legal fees!
