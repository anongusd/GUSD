To Congressional leadership and President Trump: reopen the government and end the suffering for folks like Philip. He, and so many others, chose to work in the federal government due to belief and commitment to the value of public service. They deserve better.
Philip now has no source of income in Silicon Valley, one of the most expensive regions in the country. This is unsustainable for him and the hundreds of thousands of Americans directly affected by this shutdown.
Unfortunately, he learned that because he had resigned his previous job voluntarily and technically had not been furloughed because his new job with NASA had not yet begun, he was not eligible for public assistance.
Philip's planned start date came and went with still no resolution in sight, so he applied for unemployment assistance to help pay the bills and buy groceries until Congress and the President could come together and end the standoff.
Much to his surprise, the Republican leadership at the time chose to adjourn through January 3rd, and when Congress gathered again, the Senate refused to pass the same funding bill that they had passed unanimously just a month before.
When the government shutdown at 12 A.M. on December 22nd, Philip was worried, but figured that Congress and the President would sort things out sooner rather than later given that 800,000 jobs were at stake, including his.
Philip, from San Jose, was set to begin his job with the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View earlier this month. When he received the offer back in December, he resigned from his previous job in order to prepare for this important new role.
This government shutdown has real, human consequences. My office has received many calls and messages from constituents personally hurt by President Trump's and Senator McConnell's obstructionism and refusal to reopen the government.	Here is one story

The shutdown not only harms 800k federal workers and their families, but the White House admits that it's slashing economic growth. It could reduce GDP by half a percent or more, costing tens of thousands of private sector jobs. Mr. Trump:  Support our workers. End the shutdown. https://t.co/smY6fbtdv0

Charters were never supposed to be a substitute for good public education as they have become in the LA school district.

There is no crisis at the border other than the one created by the Trump administration. Instead, the real crisis is climate change, and that is what we should be discussing. We need a Green New Deal that puts people back to work and combats climate change. CC: @sunrisemvmt https://t.co/ODmAhVWhHA

Soon there will be more U.S. troops on the U.S.-Mexico border than in Iraq and Syria combined.  The President's decision to send troops to the border is a misallocation of resources.
On this day in 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun became the first African American woman elected to US Senate. She has won my admiration for her role as a trailblazer for representation of minorities and women in government and as an advocate for social justice.

Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill to subsidize the wages of employees at multibillion dollar corporations. People who work hard for successful companies deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor. My bill with @SenSanders will push to make that a reality. https://t.co/CbiplnblOh

I’m joining @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews at 8:50pm ET to discuss my bill with @SenSanders which would provide basic fairness to every taxpayer. Rich corporations should provide living wages for their workers and our plan will ensure that those who don't are held accountable.
PRRI released a study which reveals 46% of California youth think college is too risky of a financial gamble. Education is the backbone of this nation. We must not let exorbitant tuition and debts get in the way of all those who want to continue to learn.
When companies underpay their employees, it forces taxpayers to cover services that help low-wage workers make ends meet. This is unfair to both their workers and to American taxpayers who pay taxes for the common good, not to boost corporate quarterly earnings reports.

We cannot give up on anyone who wants to work. As FDR recognized, it is a fundamental right.
Wages have been stagnant for years. At the same time union participation is at an all time low. These two things are connected.

We should not just lock children in prison with their parents. That is not a solution. This is not who we are.
rather than civil offenses, as immigration law has historically been done in this country. And it hinges on a federal judge modifying the Flores Settlement Agreement reached in 1997, to allow them to detain children beyond 20 days.
It does not take us back to the status quo before Attorney General Sessions issued guidance in April, and again in May 2018. Rather, it will continue the Trump administration’s decision to prosecute every single immigrant who crosses the border with criminal offenses,
THREAD -- The President’s executive order is a very small nod towards decency by ending the barbaric practice of separating children from their parents. But it simply just replaces one problem with another by locking up families in detainment together.

The same people who blundered our nation into the 2003 invasion of Iraq are still in charge of our nation’s foreign policy, and their record has been a total failure. We must begin earnestly seeking new ideas beyond trying to bomb ‘freedom’ into the Middle East. #BernieTownHall
The Saudis do not share American values of freedom and democracy. They are authoritarian monarchs who have already dragged our nation into a destructive civil war in Yemen, and we cannot let them drag us into a war with Iran. #BernieTownHall

The absence of a healthy, competitive market enables drug manufacturers to charge exorbitant prices. I co-founded the Congressional Antitrust Caucus because we need a new approach to merger evaluation, one that prioritizes the long-term industry health. 	https://t.co/eIg5nTphEX
The #GOPTaxScam leaves many lower and middle income Americans worse off due to higher insurance premiums or loss of coverage resulting from the individual mandate repeal. How can you spend $1.5 trillion and not help the people who need it? https://t.co/jpzwpIzMwc
I'm hopeful this opening with North Korea will lead to real progress. However, we must close the possibility that a rash decision by @POTUS leads us to a brutal war. David, thanks for your support and for making your voice heard by writing to the @nytimes. https://t.co/KDo9xwsqsV
These decisions are more than statistics. They impact the real lives of so many working families for whom the @federalreserve is statutorily required to  provide "maximum employment"
African Americans (still facing double the white unemployment rate) and impoverished rural families are the very last to receive benefits of a strengthening jobs market economy. The @federalreserve must always think of the impact on jobs and wages first.
Banks have done fine in this economy. We need the @federalreserve to prioritize our struggling workers and let job growth continue.
Given these figures, the @federalreserve has no basis for raising interest rates, which by design slash job creation and wage growth.
But wage growth continues to be well below the already meager target of 3.5% meaning we cannot be at the level economists call #fullemployment. And many of these new jobs may not pay enough given the high cost of living.
Thread — We all should be glad that 313k jobs were created this past month. This is good news for hundreds of thousands of families who want to work.
This is Waleed, a human rights lawyer in Saudi Arabia. In 2014, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his activism. As a participant of the Defending Freedoms Project, I am advocating for Waleed because he deserves the freedom that we exercise daily. #WeStandWithWaleed https://t.co/fBPUTejSCK
4/ Pro-diplomacy Congressmembers support dialogue. One way to show	support is to join 68 bipartisan cosponsors of HR4837, No Unconstitutional Strike on North Korea Act. The Constitution is clear:	the president must gain Congressional approval for an unprovoked first strike.
3/ Our sincere gratitude to S. Korean Pres. Moon, who averted a confrontation with potential for unimaginable escalation. He steadfastly insisted that no U.S. attack would be tolerated without	their approval, working adeptly to defuse tensions caused by Trump's	erratic threats.
2/ Kim's offer to halt nuke/missile testing, accepting the US will	conduct military drills including simulating killing Kim, is an unprecedented and meaningful offer. As talks progress, the military-to-military talks I propose are needed to ensure against unintended escalation.
1/ The world breathes a cautious sigh of relief as Trump commits to direct talks with North Korea. I recently urged Trump to take this step, and am thrilled he's heeding the advice of experts such as former DOD sec'y Bill Perry, and the South Korean govt.

Every day, 175 families lose a loved one because of the opioid epidemic. When we talk about dealing with the opioid epidemic, we must talk about saving lives and reducing the harm that addicts do to themselves and those around them.
3/ Congress has a long way to go on guns. But I believe that this bill is a strong step in the direction we need to go as a nation.
2/ I have cosponsored the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act as a first step in keeping guns away from domestic abusers. This bill will give local courts and families the power to keep the abusers in their lives from acquiring firearms.
THREAD  -- 1/ Domestic abusers, men who use violence on family members and intimate partners, should not have access to firearms. People who do not respect the bodies of those closest to them should not have the power to take their lives as well.
The levels of poverty in America are shameful for such a rich country. While American corporations profit for globalization abroad, domestic wages have flatlined. Congress needs to pass legislation that empowers working families and puts cash in their pockets.

We must protect DREAMers, but we shouldn’t let misleading and prejudiced voices destroy our immigration system in the process.
Winners of the diversity visa system must meet certain educational and work requirements and are subject to all appropriate security vetting. In fact, they are likely to achieve more professional success than other immigrants.
Family-based immigration is not "unlimited" but restricted to spouses, children, parents, and siblings and takes decades. President Trump's proposal would tear families apart to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
Multiple reports conducted over many years show that immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. They are already subject to intense background and security checks.
Immigrants don't steal jobs or services from Americans. They actually launch more than 25% of all new businesses in the US, creating millions of jobs for Americans. They also contribute more than $12 billion per year to our Social Security fund.
Here are some of the reasons I oppose President Trump's proposal:
THREAD: The GOP is using DREAMers as bargaining chips to push restrictive immigration policies. Instead, we should pass a clean Dream Act and then have an honest debate on immigration reform that recognizes the value immigrants bring to this country.

As population and inflation go up, non-defense discretionary funding goes down every year – compounding the adverse impact of these enormous cuts. I cannot support the President’s proposal and will continue to prioritize working Americans and the middle class in Congress.
The President’s plan slashes investment in health care, anti-poverty programs and economic growth initiatives, including $1.7 trillion in cuts to Medicare and our other safety net programs over a decade.
We must invest in modernizing our nation’s infrastructure so that we can compete in and thrive in a 21st century global economy.
His proposed drastic cuts to non-defense domestic programs after 2019, while terminating a host of other programs such as the Manufacturing Extension Program, moves our nation in the wrong direction and away from his promise for robust investments in infrastructure.

Thank you @RepJoeKennedy for inspiring our nation to reject false choices and offer an inclusive positive vision for the future.
I will continue to be a voice for jobs and equality, full funding for CHIP, a clean DREAM Act, and necessary disaster relief funding, as well as long term economic solutions for working families.
I listened to the president tonight and will continue to do my constitutional duty to hold him accountable and serve my constituents and our nation.
Finally,  Trump and the Republicans cheered about handing a $1.3 trillion tax break to wealthy corporations with their tax scam that hurts working families who need it most.
Tonight, Trump talked about immigration. His perception is flawed. Real lives are at stake, and I will not stop fighting for the 800,000 DREAMERs who deserve nothing less than a clean DREAM Act.
I took moments tonight to honor Heather Heyer, and Recy Taylor, and Erica Garner, among many others I’ve admired for their leadership and passion in pursuit of justice, equality, respect, and ultimately, what is right and just.
Absent in his remarks was a comprehensive approach to common sense gun safety and combating violence and bigotry in our divided nation.
The president’s speech ignored the concerns of millions who opposed the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality. Big telecom companies should not be permitted to slow down their competitors and charge consumers more. Everyone should have equal access to the internet.
From someone who once said we’d have health insurance for everyone, there were no words for our citizens to have access to quality, affordable care all deserve. We need Medicare for all.
He didn’t acknowledge what is now world’s worst humanitarian disaster in Yemen or what should be our foreign policy imperatives of peace, and diplomatic relations.
The president spoke on foreign policy. It seems he doesn’t remember that we have 30,000 of our own troops stationed nearby North Korea’s nuclear weapons and in 14 other countries.
If the president wanted to support working families and invigorate the economy he would have presented a tangible agenda to enrich the lives of ordinary Americans and working families. We didn’t see that agenda tonight.
I will keep working to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and policies supporting tech jobs, apprenticeships and was economic growth.
What we need is action and a plan for our nation’s well-being, from job creation to health care, to education and climate change. We can all agree with his proposals to expand job and vocational training, but his economic policies and tax cuts haven’t supported that goal.

This administration thinks it's fine to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. I'm proud to serve on the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and will continue fighting for the rights of all Americans. https://t.co/W0hoVryKTE
On #EITCAwarenessDay, help @IRS put money in the pockets of working Americans who are eligible. I've introduced the GAIN Act, a massive a expansion of the EITC that would provide a much-needed boost to our economy, making up for wages lost to inflation over the past four decades. https://t.co/ZvGf73cdgq
Over 80% of Americans support a path to citizenship for DREAMERs. Trump's proposed cut to family-based immigration is drastic and throwing one of the best parts of our nation away. There is no policy rationale for it. What we need is to pass a clean Dream Act now! https://t.co/5mjxC25EwH

That's why I led 32 of my colleagues in urging this administration to establish direct military communications with North Korea. This is a non-partisan, common sense measure to make us safer. https://t.co/PvQk8LKosA
After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to create a military-to-military communications line to prevent misunderstandings that could lead to nuclear war. We shouldn't forget the lessons of history, especially when the stakes are this high.

In 2015, 49% of children ages 3 and younger relied on CHIP or Medicaid insurance for poor Americans. It’s been 96 days since the GOP let CHIP expire. Unacceptable. We need a long-term solution for these children. Kids’ health care can’t wait.

@SenSherrodBrown I am disappointed that the tax bill demonstrates Republicans think it’s better to serve the interests of the very wealthy than everyday people.
I will continue to fight in Congress for legislation that helps working families, like the GAIN Act, my bill with companion @SenSherrodBrown, that roughly doubles the earned income tax credit for working families and increases the credit for childless workers almost sixfold.
In my state of California, not to mention the rest of the country, families will be forced to pay taxes twice on much of their income by scaling back their ability to write off state and local taxes.
Compare that to the top 1% who will receive 83% of the gains in 2027, with the top 0.1% getting 60% of those benefits. This is flawed policy that will increase income inequality in our nation even further.
This horrible Republican tax bill increases deficits by $1.5 trillion over ten years that favors corporations and the wealthiest Americans, while doing nothing for the middle class. 53% of taxpayers will pay more tax in 2027 than they do today.
I’ve heard from many #CA17 Californians that the GOP tax bill, to put it simply, only looks out for  the top 1% and wealthy corporations. Keep speaking out!
Ending net neutrality only benefits the big internet service providers. It’s imperative that we pass @USRepMikeDoyle’s bill to reverse the FCC’s decision and restore net neutrality.
