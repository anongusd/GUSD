@KShapiro2024 @charliekirk11 Exactly, he is assuming they are democrats because of the color of their skin. He is the one assuming, no one else, he is not responding to a tweet. This tweet was created naturally.	Charlie is just like the people he complains about.
@Camellia_Alexan @charliekirk11 is he saying this to you, to me or to black people?	He is assuming they are all democrats and they don't have to be one, because they can be republicans instead, just like him.	He is using race as bait to persuade them to his party.	That makes him not better than the democrats.
@KShapiro2024 @charliekirk11 But what is he telling them? to educate themselves about their options.	to free themselves from the bipartisan system.	No, he is just using race as bait to add more people to his party.	In conclusion he is not better than the rest that does the same thing.		He had the space.
@Camellia_Alexan @charliekirk11 but isn't he the one assuming this.	He is not responding to anyone specifically.	So this tweet is natural, done by his own assumptions.
@KShapiro2024 @charliekirk11 He is assuming all black people must be democrats, so he felt he needed to tweet this because of his assumption.	I feel he uses race as bait to persuade black people to become republicans. If he is doing that, then he is not better than the people he complains about.
@Camellia_Alexan @charliekirk11 I guess all of us are racist.	It is interesting his assumption that if you are black you must be a democrat, it must be the reason to write this tweet. Otherwise this tweet wouldn't exist. 		Unless, he is just using race as bait to persuade black people to become Republicans.
