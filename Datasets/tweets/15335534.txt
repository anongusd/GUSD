Demanding Northam's resignation but not moving forward on removing him from office is essentially declaring, "you are an embarrassment to the entire state and you're harming the state and people by remaining in office, but you don't have to leave if you don't want to."
Oh and apparently every single lawmaker in the state demanding a governor's resignation is the sort of thing you can just ignore and it will go away after a while.
Dammit, autocorrect, I meant "corroborating"
@JohnEkdahl I suppose, but... he just happens to pose with his buddy in a Klan outfit on his way to the dance contest?
So a month later, we're left with no way to prove it's Northam under the hood someone else... and no cooperating accounts of his Michael Jackson dance contest.
Putting shoe polish on your face out of some sort of devoted fanhood of Michael Jackson is tasteless and bad, but probably not quite as horrible as dressing up as a Klansman -- a racist terrorist group.
@BiasedGirl In fact, did anyone ever come forward with anything to corroborate the story of Northam dressing up like Michael Jackson for the dance contest?
Most of us figured Northam admitted to Michael Jackson stuff because he feared photos of that would come out. What if we were wrong?
I noticed we never ended up seeing pictures of the Michael Jackson costume or dance contest either. You figure if anyone still had those, they would have surfaced by now.

In Venezuela, Maduro’s stepsons plotted to skim $200 million from the state-owned oil company. Chavez’s daughte has more than $4 billion hidden in bank accounts in Europe. Finally, Bernie Sanders found some “millionaires and billionaires” that he likes.		https://t.co/83oLXjXLPp
Please, no mealy mouthed excuses on Sanders behalf, claiming his mild label of “undemocratic” is substantive criticism. We’ve seen Sanders angry, castigating “the millionaires and billionaires and the big banks” with bug-eyed, finger-jabbing, full fury.		https://t.co/83oLXjXLPp

@OregonPerson One of the ways you ensure you never get a One Child Policy enacted is telling government officials "THE SIZE OF MY FAMILY IS NONE OF YOUR G***AMN BUSINESS” whenever they bring up arguments about the morality of family sizes.
@kmd2210 FWIW, she said the landlord for the previous congressman’s district office wanted to hike the rent for a new tenant.
If she holds to the $52K-per-year minimum, Ocasio-Cortez will likely hire fewer staffers than other offices. That’s all it means. You can argue whether that will hurt constituents or whether higher-paid staffers will do more/better work. 		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF
The less you know about the budget process for congressional offices, the more AOC's $52,000-per-year minimum for all staffers stance sounds bold or wasteful. Each (non-Speaker) member gets the same allocation for personnel.		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF https://t.co/jYKq97xNdg
In fact, the legislative branch appropriations bill passed before the shutdown, meaning that there should not have been any disruption to the funding of her office.		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF
AOC’s district office is under construction and is expected to be open by early March. The congresswoman blamed the government shutdown for the delays, but other freshmen members of Congress managed to get their offices up and running.		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF
We don’t want government officials going anywhere near the argument that one size of a family is moral and a different size is immoral. It’s funny how quickly the argument “my body, my choice,” disappears outside of its most prominent context.		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF https://t.co/tm0enXdeCl
Because of her status as the Progressive id, we should expect her to only become more prominent, arguably the de facto leader of the Democratic party, even if she holds little formal power.	 	https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF
Ocasio-Cortez expresses the repressed desires of the progressive movement — as Trump did so for a significant chunk of the conservative movement.		https://t.co/BrPY8ftWdF

Because there's no way the Trump era could possibly end with your faction in the minority, right?
Because conservativism was always so powerful and had so many natural advantages in national debates, that we have an excess of talent and energy and can just purge our way to even more victories, huh?
A lot of Righties seem really convinced that when the Trump presidency ends, neither Trump fans or Trump critics on the Right are going to need each other. We're just going to have so many people on one side, that the ones who disagree can be purged, huh?
@rkylesmith Trump responds, "I would get a much better deal than that trade. I'd get a whole case of bottled water for three of me."

@michaelbd Thank you! I had really wondered what you would think of all this.

Also in today’s Morning Jolt, @LizMair makes the case for William Weld. Your mileage may vary; I find that for a Republican, Weld spends a lot of time talking up the virtues of traditional Democratic party positions and candidates.		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c https://t.co/jfhmlicQhO

I recently ran across a chain e-mail about dangerous, horrible migrants overrunning Paris. No one who forwarded it found it strange that the pictures of anti-social behavior on the Paris metro had New York City subway maps in the background. https://t.co/p6hERvXkrG
@Coach_Crash That was me, bring it on. ;)
How do you beat foreign-government-assisted disinformation, propaganda, and “fake news”? You cultivate a less credulous and better-informed public, that doesn’t automatically believe everything they read on the Internet. 		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
Maybe I’m cynical, but I figure Democratic candidates seize upon this Politico article and the data within to dismiss these less-flattering topics as “Russian disinformation” unworthy of further discussion.		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
@IAMMGraham The truth is always worth repeating in different venues!
The exception is the claim of Beto O’Rourke leaving a message using racist language on an answering machine in the 1990s. I found two tweets about this. Was this some big online rumor and I just missed it?		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
"negative memes attacking Warren on her Native American heritage claims and memes surrounding Harris’s relationship with Brown…” except Warren’s Native American heritage claims aren’t “disinformation”! Why wouldn’t/shouldn’t they be fodder for “attacks”?		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
Sure, a meme takes an Elizabeth Warren quote out of context, but she was indeed a registered GOP from 1991 to 1996, used to be a regular welcome guest of Lou Dobbs, and her 2003 book got some praise form the Right. Fair game in a Dem primary!		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
I haven’t seen the meme that purportedly tries to "sensationalize [Kamala] Harris’ relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.” But the relationship and nepotism involved is pretty sensational as is! 		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
As much as I hate Russian bot farms trying to meddle in our politics, the fact that some Boris Badinov account is putting stuff out there doesn’t automatically make it “disinformation.” 		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
I noticed that three of the four examples cited in a Politico article about a "foreign state actor-driven” “disinformation campaign” against Democratic presidential candidates involve anecdotes that are… true.		https://t.co/65QrpZg62c
It’s Not a Disinformation Campaign if the Facts Are True https://t.co/85CYK2AGwH
One other less-mentioned factor in the NeverTrump debates of 2016: for much of that cycle, he looked like political suicide that would lose and drag down other GOP candidates. Once you’ve won, you dispel the argument “that guy can’t win, so why support him?" https://t.co/5sAhI2IYVi

Hoaxers understand that many people in prominent positions would choose to believe their stories, because their tales reaffirm those preexisting beliefs.		https://t.co/C2I2HaOSw7
@RoushSkylar What percentage of reports are investigated to the point of an arrest? And if the case is unresolved, how do we discern the actual ones from hoaxes?
Right now, lots of Americans feel fear, and they hear other Americans insisting that their fears are unrealistic or silly or paranoid, which drives political anger. 		https://t.co/C2I2HaOSw7
Yes, the number of reported hate crimes increased by 17% from 2016 to 2017. But about 1,000 more police organizations started sending data to the FBI in 2017 than the previous year. 		https://t.co/C2I2HaOSw7
The way we measure hate crimes is imperfect; more police agencies are collecting data and providing it to the FBI than in the past, making year-to-year comparisons difficult.		https://t.co/C2I2HaOSw7
It’s not accurate to say, “This sort of thing almost always turns out to be a hoax,” and it’s also not accurate to say, “This sort of thing almost never turns out to be a hoax.” 		https://t.co/C2I2HaOSw7

But we don’t know that the hate crime occurred, and even if we can definitively establish that an assault occurred, it is a separate step to determine if it was driven by “hate” or by some other motive (theft, a personal dispute, etc.).		https://t.co/Gq3j3yMzDr
We _know_ Smollett described being the victim of a hate crime &amp; was treated at the hospital. We _know_ Chicago PD publicly declared that they were treating the incident as “a possible hate crime.”		https://t.co/Gq3j3yMzDr
One of the things they’re supposed to drill into your head in Journalism 101 is differentiating between what you know and what you think. What you know belongs on the news page, what you think belongs on the op-ed page.		https://t.co/Gq3j3yMzDr
Media organizations have rulebooks about these sorts of things called “stylebooks,” laying out how terms like “allegedly” and “accused” should be used. They aim for choosing the right word for both clarity to the reader and in part to protect themselves from libel suits.
News organizations use the term “possible hate crime” in situations like this because the news organization does not know, with 100% certainty, what happened. 		https://t.co/Gq3j3yMzDr
My favorite complaint about the skepticism about Smollett’s account was the declaration that "references to ‘possible hate crimes’ are far more frequent, far more insidious, and deeply dangerous.”		Nope. Nope. Nope.		https://t.co/Gq3j3yMzDr

If people really want the news media to change its behavior and judgment, the incentives have to change.		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK
You know why they call it “clickbait”? Because people click on it.		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK
Why do some journalists put out inaccurate, narrative-advancing versions of events? Because often there’s a bigger, or at least more-easily reached, audience for the inaccurate, narrative-advancing versions of events than the accurate, non-narrative one.		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK
@ChoralReave Gee, if only they had addressed it, Russell.		You got a beef with what I write, come to me. You got a beef with someone else, take it to someone else.
The “tell me what I want to hear” crowds aren’t the only news audiences out there, but they’re among the biggest &amp; easy to reach. Offer the right kind of story to those audiences, they will read, share and praise it.		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK
Various news organizations — some openly ideological, some not-so-openly ideological — have cultivated two audiences, each one eager to get the latest version of “here’s why we’re right and good and they’re wrong and bad.”		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK
Anger often _feels good_. It creates a dopamine rush. We’re often much more comfortable feeling angry over something than sad or vulnerable.		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK

If you ever want to understand a particular human behavior, look at people’s incentives. This applies to the national news media as much as anyone. 		https://t.co/YWW4L2GKKK

I didn’t get into it in the List of 20, but what was Amy Klobuchar’s toughest race? She’s won two nonpartisan AG races, and the Senate bids in 2006, 2012, and 2018. She’s always had the wind at her back and run on friendly territory. 		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ
Remember how Scott Walker had big accomplishments and a wonky, affable demeanor and got largely ignored in those first few 2016 GOP presidential debates? Not hard to imagine the same thing happening to Sen. Amy Klobuchar in 2020.		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ
Soft-spoken, allergic to controversy and full of “Minnesota nice,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar would be the opposite of Trump in many ways. You just have to wonder if 2020 Democratic presidential primary voters want that - or trust that style could beat Trump.		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ

In 2013, Sen. Amy Klobuchar backed Harry Reid’s nuking the filibuster for executive branch appointees and non-Supreme Court judicial nominees. By 2018, she said, “I don’t think we should’ve made that change, when we look back at it.” 		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ
Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of Amy Klobuchar is that Justin Bieber once said, "she needs to be locked up” over copyright legislation she sponsored.		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ
OpenSecrets. org found that Klobuchar sponsored or co-sponsored 103 earmarks totaling $200 million in fiscal year 2008, 88 earmarks totaling $133 million in fiscal year 2009, and 88 earmarks totaling $117 million in fiscal year 2010. 		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ

Klobuchar voted for the ACA, which included a new 2.3 percent tax on medical devices. Almost immediately after passage, Klobuchar set about trying to get the tax repealed, lamenting "its impact on manufacturing and innovation across our country.”		https://t.co/sN98hjKIoZ

Year by year, Warren became more like the rest of the Dems, and the rest of the party became more like her. Stands out less. But she’s not the next Hillary.

Also, if you’re the Congressional Democrats, are you sure you want to get into a high-stakes theatrical showdown of stunts and taunts? Isn’t this Trump’s home turf? Is that really his weakness, compared to, say, the details of legislation and the nuts and bolts of government?
A normal president would fear the negative coverage that comes from a government shutdown. But Trump isn’t a normal president in a lot of ways. Besides, he gets negative coverage every single day; how much worse has the past month been?
The Schumer/Pelosi strategy was to ensure Trump got blamed for the shutdown (helped by Trump’s comments) and await his surrender. But Trump clearly doesn’t fear the current blame nearly as much as the consequences of a surrender on the wall.
Each side’s strategy for ending the shutdown so far:		1. Taunt and blame the other, and repeat arguments they’ve made a thousand times before.	2. ???	3. Accept the opposition’s surrender.

In her memoir, Clinton called the criticism “fairly remarkable, considering that Joe himself campaigned for me all over the Midwest and talked plenty about the middle class.”
"You didn’t hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly line making $60,000 bucks a year and a wife making $32,000 as a hostess in restaurant.”
Joe Biden on Hillary’s campaign in 2017: “This was the first campaign that I can recall where my party did not talk about what it always stood for — and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class.”		https://t.co/BfJ9ErSLhk
In a 2014 speech denouncing predatory lenders who focused upon military familys, Biden denounced, “these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.” Days later, he called Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew “the wisest man in the Orient.”		https://t.co/BfJ9ErBapM

Biden voted against authorizing the use of force in what became known as the Persian Gulf War in 1991, accusing the United Nations of being “willing to fight to the last American.”		https://t.co/BfJ9ErBapM
In 1991, Biden boasted that the crime bill he cosponsored was “the single largest expansion of the federal death penalty in the history of the Congress.”		 https://t.co/BfJ9ErSLhk
Biden cosponsored the 1984 Crime Control Act, which abolished federal parole, reestablished the death penalty, expanded civil asset forfeiture, and increased federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana.		https://t.co/BfJ9ErBapM
More Biden on Bork: "Part of what Bork argued remains a legitimate concern: if you let nine individuals appointed for life set the bar, then what stops them from simply making up fundamental rights on their own?”

Yes, the state has an interest in reducing truancy. But if you press criminal charges against parents, you take a family problem and now give a parent a criminal record. Under Kamala Harris’ backed law, CA chose to put 2 mothers _in prison_ over this. 		https://t.co/jMQeipkKAl

Harris touts her high conviction rate as a DA, which was indeed high. But her office’s conviction rate in felony cases that went to trial wasn’t nearly as impressive. The overall rate was boosted by pretrial plea agreements (as with many DAs).		https://t.co/jMQeipClYV
@JamesAGagliano @CNN @HLNTV I’m glad they caught the guy, but I wonder how many people gave DNA to the testing/ancestry companies knowing it could be accessed and reviewed by the government.

I wouldn't argue that familial DNA searches have never had value. But CA can collect DNA from you if you're arrested, but charges are dropped. Do we want the government having vast databases of citizens' DNA, even if it was initially voluntarily given to a genealogy web site?
The joy of writing these articles is the sheer number of "whoa, I didn't know that" moments: Kamala Harris is a big fan of civil asset forfeiture, familial DNA searches and charging parents with crimes for truant children.		https://t.co/jMQeipClYV

@historyball If the networks want, once the president is done, they can use as much prime time air time as they like with Democratic congressional leaders and/or experts, generals, etc. disagreeing/denouncing Trump’s move...
You cannot plausibly argue that the broadcast networks were stingy with Obama, or that Trump is making some unreasonable, unprecedented request. 		https://t.co/wjujQlmIbS
Yeah, in 2014, the networks refused to air an Obama address on immigration. But by then, Obama had done 3 prime-time press conferences and addressed nation in prime time on ACA, OBL kill, Afghan war, Boston Marathon, Syria, Iraq, and government shutdown.		https://t.co/wjujQlmIbS
This isn't a close call. The Oval Office address is a long bipartisan tradition for American presidents, and this is the first time Trump has done this. We’re almost two years into his presidency. Come on.  https://t.co/eVpeTcGDXs
You’re telling me that after Donald Trump got an estimated $5 billion in free media during the 2016 campaign from networks televising his speeches, NOW they don’t want to televise an Oval Office address?	 	https://t.co/wjujQlmIbS

Twenty Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Bernie Sanders https://t.co/XTlwM2cQnj
While different political campaigns will have different atmospheres, my sense had been that quite a few  presidential campaigns feature short-lived relationships that often turn into messy affairs. 		https://t.co/e924BvY4vT
@michael_steel That would at least act as a strong deterrent to nominating or keeping clearly flawed candidates in future cycles.
Option one: Bernie Sanders and the top men around him really were oblivious to harassment or tolerated it. Option two: The kind of women who are likely to volunteer for Sanders are naturally more inclined to interpret interactions with men as harassment.		https://t.co/e924BvY4vT
If Trump gets a primary challenger and goes on to lose the general election, it guarantees a market for a “We would have won if the Establishment hadn’t stabbed us in the back” narrative for the next four years.		https://t.co/qc78NwIddx https://t.co/lwJKoOik9O
If Trump gets a primary challenger from the left, the president will probably squash him in the contests —  but he’ll also have a convenient (if not terribly plausible) scapegoat for any 2020 defeat.		https://t.co/qc78NwIddx https://t.co/2u8TE2XSkv
How likely is it that Trump will do something in the next two years that spurs Republicans to no longer support him? The vast majority of the Republican party’s voters have tied themselves to Trump the way Ulysses tied himself to the mast.		https://t.co/e924BvY4vT https://t.co/ytvcD0Ynkd

@bitterclinger4e @winningatmylife In part, yes. The media gives little to no credit for demonstrations of good character, and the electorate at large doesn’t seem to, either. Nor did either significantly rebuke below-the-belt tactics from Democrats/The Left.

At a 1996 rally for his congressional campaign, feminist Gloria Steinem called Bernie Sanders “an honorary woman.”		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj
@peterdaou So you came to the piece with the belief that it had to be an “oppo drop,” and then concluded it had done a bad job at being an “oppo drop.” These are the knee-jerk bad-faith reactions that make Twitter such a pain.
Bernie Sanders, 1988: "I have my own feelings about what causes cancer and the psychosomatic aspects of cancer.” 		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj
@peterdaou If this was some sinister “oppo drop,” why would I put that sentence in there?
@peterdaou No, jackass, this isn’t an “oppo drop.” This is just a list of things I found out about Sanders and decided to write about. Stop seeing monsters under your bed.
1985: “Representatives from the Irish Republican Army have stopped by [then-Mayor Bernie] Sanders’ office during the past four years.” A subsequent Boston Globe article stated, “members of the IRA were regularly invited to City Hall.” 		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj
(In the preceding few years, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan, shot down Korean Air Lines flight 007, and pushed for the institution of martial law in Poland.)
Sanders in 1985: "A handful of people are making decisions, whipping up Cold War hysteria, making us hate the Russians. We’re spending billions on military. Why can’t we take some of that money to pay for thousands of U.S. children to go to the USSR?” 		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj

In a 1971 special Senate election, Bernie Sanders became the Liberty Union party’s nominee by showing up and raising his hand when they asked for a volunteer. He won 2 percent of the vote.		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj
In the 2016 presidential election, Bernie Sanders received 18,218 write-in votes in Vermont — 5.68 percent of the overall vote.		https://t.co/EWgIphZsWj

Amazing how the Patriots defensive backs apparently never, ever, ever commit pass interference, at least according to the referees.

Tom Brady may no longer be in the MVP discussion, but he still could get a Best Actor Oscar after falling down and drawing that roughing-the-passer penalty. #NYJvsNE
@DAitken90 I was hoping for a mid fourth-quarter punt, on 4th and 2 at midfield, down two scores, with Bowles trusting his defense to get the ball back quickly.

@paulalfieri It’s really fascinating that Trump’s plan to build the wall included building just 40 miles of replacement bollard fencing, and THEN waiting for the GOP to lose the House, before starting in earnest.
@gtotango This is one of the better counter-arguments I’ve encountered.
@JimjamFr Er, the “veil” that passing legislation requires horse-trading, compromise, and coalition-building was “lifted” for anyone paying attention for a long, long time.
@Kyle_Beckley But I guess he would rather have “executive time."
@Kyle_Beckley Heck, visit the six spots along the border, where they’ve replacing deteriorating fencing with the 18-foot bollard fencing, let the CBP talk about the advantages, etc. Go out and make the case to the public. Cite evidence. Help them see the problem and solution.
@Kyle_Beckley Yup. At the very least, he would probably get folks calling their House member or senator and starting to apply some more pressure to fund a wall, or part of a wall, or bollard fencing, or whatever.

“Passing a major piece of legislation shouldn’t require a whole lot of horse-trading, compromises, side deals, and little extra goodies to bribe people into supporting it!” Maybe it shouldn’t. But we live in the real world, not how things should be.

@smbunten Volunteering to become a spy, a soldier, a sailor, an explorer or make some other arduous effort in an American cause or innovation is pretty much the opposite of victimhood.
@smbunten So they should take it up with the folks who write children’s books on veganism and memoirs about illegal aliens. The stories I mentioned are pretty potent counter-arguments to the familiar minorities-as-helpless-victims-throughout-U.S.-history narrative.

“Dear God, this tape of Putin and Trump proves that Russia’s been pulling the strings of the White House since day one! Better not release this until after the midterms, though."

According to the Pew Research Center’s methodology, the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has declined from 12.2 million in 2007 to 10.7 million in 2016. I suspect many believe that the number of illegal immigrants is increasing. 		https://t.co/DzC3fINtFc

Sometimes it’s healthier to let the public enact a bad idea so they can learn that it doesn’t work. I’m thinking of the U.S. “yacht tax” enacted in the 1990s, aiming to “make the rich pay their fair share” but that ended up wiping out a lot of boat-building jobs.
If you’re worried about angry populism in the UK, I don’t think you can say “well, we tried to work out a deal on #Brexit, but it was too hard, so we’re not going to do it” and expect the 52% who voted for it to say, “oh, okay then."

President of what? https://t.co/IgMZRkx8Mw
In Ohio, the GOP won the races for state AG, secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer. Sherrod Brown won by 6.5; as recently as early October, polls had had him up by 18. For a purple state, Ohio looks awfully red. Maybe it’s more of a “Magenta State.”		https://t.co/GiY63UFeTj
Before we start flaying the pollsters, observe that no amount of weighting, sample size, or other adjustments to a survey can compensate for respondents not being honest about the candidate they support!		 https://t.co/GiY63UFeTj
That East Tennessee State University poll had Phil Bredesen and Marsha Blackburn tied; Blackburn won, 54.7 percent to 43.9 percent. Maybe they oversampled Taylor Swift fans.		https://t.co/GiY63UFeTj
Maybe there is still something of a “shy Tory” effect. Hawley won by 6 points in Missouri’s Senate race, much wider margin than most of the final polls. Three of the final polls in Florida showed Senator Bill Nelson with a lead of four percentage points.		https://t.co/GiY63UFeTj
Was there a “Bradley effect” in Florida?  Gillum led 16 of the last 17 polls, although it’s worth noting most of those polls had Gillum up by a point or two, so a DeSantis victory by seven-tenths of a percentage point shouldn’t be quite so shocking.		 https://t.co/GiY63UFeTj

After Gillum &amp; Abrams, when you look at where Dems actually picked up governorships – Janet Mills in ME, Steve Sisolak in NV, Michelle Grisham in NM, Laura Kelly in KS – maybe national hype for a first-time gubernatorial candidate is counter-productive.		https://t.co/2bRse1s6z2 https://t.co/1FYeGcIRCU
In other words, Abrams/Metz need 60 percent of the remaining absentees in a state that just went 50.5-48.6-.09 — conceivable, but highly improbable.
As of this am, there are 3,886,414 votes cast in GA governor race. To get Kemp below 50%, Abrams &amp; Libertarian Metz need to gain 19,432 votes out of the remaining absentee ballots. Abrams campaign calculates that there are about 100K absentees out there. 		https://t.co/2bRse1s6z2
Some of these seats, like Darrell Issa’s old seat in California, are probably lost to Republicans for a long, long time. But some of these Democratic wins look like flukes or fairly easy to win back, like the Oklahoma City or coastal South Carolina seats.		https://t.co/2bRse1s6z2

This isn’t good for GOP, but this county split 51.5% for Hillary, 44.6% for Trump in 2016 https://t.co/GgVXJVsjVX
Look, maybe Tim Kaine was always going to have a big advantage this year, but maybe a normal GOP candidate at the top of the ticket might have helped Comstock, Brat, and Riggleman? 		https://t.co/xUoJngB5ot

Nobody’s going to click through. Everybody’s going to respond “BUT WHAT ABOUT X?!?” when X is addressed right there in the linked article.

@Neoavatara https://t.co/HBcfFiXECc
The false “Soros was a Nazi” accusation helps out Soros by giving him a glaringly implausible charge that makes his critics sound like paranoid loons. The truth about George Soros today, and the agenda he seeks to enact, is bad enough.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
@undiplomatic I’m not doing anything like that, and you’re an awful human being for making that accusation. I’m laying out Soros’ worldview in his own words. All quote from public sources. No conspiracy-mongering here. Your knee-jerk accusation reveals that you’re the hateful one here.
It isn’t surprising that those who believe in military responses to terror attacks, secure borders, who support Israel and who are wary of the notion that China’s government “functions better,” would see Soros as a malevolent force in politics.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
None of the quotes from Soros I listed today are from the rumor mill or secret recordings or secondhand claims. Soros openly lays out his beliefs in interviews, speeches, and articles. His viewpoints are not a secret.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Soros contended that the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal is “effectively destroying the transatlantic alliance.”		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
In 2017, Soros said, “[Hungarian Prime Minister Orban’s] plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.”		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Soros wrote in 2007, “I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel’s policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby’s success in suppressing divergent views.”		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Soros has made several comments that some interpreted as blaming Jews for anti-Semitism, such as, “I don’t think that you can ever overcome anti-Semitism if you behave as a tribe… the only way you can overcome it is if you give up the tribalness.”		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Soros has generously donated to groups that call on governments the world over to sever or downgrade their diplomatic relations with Israel and calls for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
In 2010, George Soros declared that China has “a better functioning government than the United States.”		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
In 2006, Soros said, that “the main obstacle to a stable and just world is the United States.” Not Iran, not Russia, not China, not Islamist terrorist groups, not transnational crime . . . the United States.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Soros declared the U.S. response to al-Qaeda to be morally equivalent to the terrorist attacks: “We abhor terrorists, because they kill innocent people for political goals. But by waging war on terror we are doing the same thing.” https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Whatever Soros’s worldview and philosophies as a boy during World War II were, he’s an outspoken, extraordinarily deep-pocketed liberal progressive now. It is not an exaggeration to say Soros’s views are radical compared to the U.S. mainstream.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
Did Soros help with the inventory? It’s difficult to argue that cooperating once in order to maintain a non-Jewish disguise constitutes an unforgivable sin while sitting in a country that ran Operation Paperclip to win the Space Race.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
The whole “Soros was a Nazi collaborator” claim stems from whether he helped a man posing as his godfather during one trip to an estate, where the godfather took inventory of Jewish properties confiscated by Nazi occupiers. 		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6
No, George Soros was not a Nazi.		https://t.co/JCS4YA4FX6

Bredesen’s sinking polls probably don’t represent an anti–Taylor Swift backlash, just a red state reverting to form as Election Day approaches.		(I mean, Blackburn’s base of support can’t all be Taylor Swift ex-boyfriends, right?)		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO https://t.co/yeHlXZUWQv
Celebrities may not really affect elections much at all. In early October, Taylor Swift endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen. Big name, wildly liked, local ties. Yet the GOP's Marsha Blackburn appears on track to win, with little movement in the polls.		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO https://t.co/UDrn50ekSV
In fact, the popular perception among Republicans that celebrities and pop stars help the Democrats might be wrong. If celebrity endorsements really persuaded voters, Republicans would never win a race.		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO https://t.co/rOMlYOsu6U
I know everyone is capable of ignoring the political thoughts of celebrities, because there are far too many celebrities to keep track of and most people tune out their manifestos, declarations, and diatribes.		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO https://t.co/nMoRWQmLme

FWIW, a CBS News poll found Beto winning voters under 30 by a margin of 57% to 35%. That’s nice, but the same poll found O’Rourke tied Cruz among voters under 44 and Cruz was clobbering O’Rourke among older voters. Beto needs a HUGE surge of young voters. 	https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO
Voters under 30-years old were 13 percent of the total electorate in Texas in the 2014 exit poll. Pretty likely it will be higher this cycle… because that’s a low bar to clear!		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO
I keep seeing excitement because “voters under the age of 30 in Texas have increased their turnout [in early voting] by 508%” compared to 2014. Well, yeah, I’ll bet the total number of young Texans who voted early in 2014 was _really low_.		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO
More Arizona early vote: "The median voting age for the state is 64, and slightly more females than males have voted, at 50.6 percent.”		https://t.co/9QJOlC2tEO

@ashsoles If those who wrote and adopted the 14th amendment had wanted to say it did not apply to those who entered the country illegally, they could have written it to make that clear.
@ashsoles I don’t think a statement from a senator overrules the plain meaning of the text in the amendment, but I suppose the Supreme Court could agree with you.

Dems, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, Libertarians, Greens -- they're the opposition, not the enemy. Those terms shouldn't be used interchangeably. The enemy are those who wants to kill us - ISIS, al-Qaeda, ruthless cartels,  hostile foreign leaders, armies, Intel services.

The opposition is going to enact policies you don't like. You may really loathe those policies and the way they impact your life. But no serious official for any office in the United States is secretly plotting to kill you, much less a part of a vast conspiracy w/the same goal.
And it does matter, but... not quite in those terms. But how shocked can we be when somebody out there takes it literally? Who begins to see political divisions as a form of "kill or be killed"?
We get a lot of political rhetoric that contends, explicitly or implicitly, "This is a matter of life and death! If the other side wins, people will die! The opposition wants to destroy you and everything you love!" Common hyperbole when you want to convince people it matters.

The fact that the mad bomber over here can threaten people for years and have no consequence from Twitter, while others have their accounts suspended or shut down for much lesser offenses, confirms Twitter only worries when a Tweet offends or bothers important or famous people.

O’Rourke fans will look at the news that Bexar County in Texas saw 16,827 votes cast by 2 p.m. today; 4 years ago, there were 13,436 for the whole first day. And Bexar is mostly Dem-learning (Hillary won by about 80K votes). But not always - in 2014, Cornyn won by 35K.
In Tennessee, 289,974 early votes have been cast so far. NBC analysis says 63% GOP, 30% Dem.	On the one hand, WHOOHOO IN YOUR FACE TAYLOR; on the other hand, there should be something like 1.3 million votes cast, based on the 2014 turnout.		 https://t.co/ML4Q8QipLX
So yeah, the early vote in IN, MT, NV looks good for the GOP. But none of those states hit 100,000 early votes yet. Based upon 2014, MT should have about 370K total votes, NV should have at least 500K votes, and IN should have at least a million. 		https://t.co/ML4Q8QipLX
Bigger numbers for early voting don’t always translate to higher turnout overall. In 2014, it was the highest percentage of early votes to date! And then the lowest turnout since World War Two.		https://t.co/ML4Q8QipLX
Every cycle, the percentage of ballots cast early goes up another few points. It was 40% in 2014. If historical trend holds, it will be about 45% this year. So we shouldn’t be all that shocked by the “EARLY VOTE UP COMPARED TO 2014” figures. 		https://t.co/ML4Q8QipLX
