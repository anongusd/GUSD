My doctor wasn't able to remove all the Endo with this surgery.#Surgery #Fail  #Endometriosis #EndoSisters
Still having Painful Spasms and some lower back pain…all in my right side:(
#Endosisters My bandages came off and looks swollen and red, but seems to be healing okay. #EndoWarrior #Endometriosis
I am feeling a bit better today lots of swelling and painful spasms  #EndoWarrior #Endometriosis #EndoSisters
I had a set back as the catheter during surgery caused an infection with high fever #Endosisters #EndoWarrior #Endometriosis

@EndEndoForever It has already been cut from my bladder and colon…it is back and deep:(
I would like to thank the day surgery staff at Hutcheson Medical Center
This is my second surgery since my total hysterectomy two years ago. Endometriosis could not be removed from my bladder and kidney today.
Thanks for all of your prayers and continue to keep me in your thoughts as the positive energy is helping me;)  #EndoSisters #EndoWarrior
I go back to the doctor on Friday to remove the bandage, check stitches and talk about my options on what next. #Endometriosis #EndoSisters
I am sore, tired have no voice from the anesthesia and have been running a low grade fever off and on. #EndoWarrior #Endometriosis
Surgery went well, however, was not a success. Doc was not able to remove all the endometriosis around my bladder and kidney #EndoSisters
