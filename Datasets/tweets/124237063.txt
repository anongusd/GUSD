#NIH has invested heavily in an $81M partnership with DoD/VA on a research study for non-drug approaches for pain management, and a special focus on service members and veterans. #PainMonth18	https://t.co/0eaaCODskL https://t.co/A3kF94G9gJ
We agree! #NIH increasingly favors pragmatic trials to test prevention and treatment strategies. Given the heterogeneity of pain syndromes and other comorbidities in those affected, we really need evidence that can be applied broadly in the real world. #PainMonth18 https://t.co/HcWjlHBQHn
This is an important issue. For people w/acute pain, &amp; for those with chronic pain who are not addicted, we need to be sure they have access to effective therapy. Over-prescribing of pain meds is dangerous but under-prescribing for legitimate needs is also a mistake #PainMonth18 https://t.co/Q2WrjwCkHk
Not all pain follows the same pathways. To know whether we're on the right track for a new treatment, we need objective measures that the treatment is working on the right pathway. That's what biomarkers offer. #PainMonth18 https://t.co/2lFlKmswpO
Intractable generally means severe, continuous and unresponsive to treatment. NIH aims to find personalized, non-addictive approaches to all kinds of pain so that in the future, none of it is intractable. #PainMonth18 https://t.co/XcPc23o15q

Q2:Cancer prevention&amp;screening are key parts of #CancerMoonshot, including increased uptake of standard of care&amp;new research approaches -DL https://t.co/BgvW4JZDzl
Q1: NCI has several new initiatives to improve understanding&amp;mitigation of cancer health disparities&amp;it is important for #CancerMoonshot –DL https://t.co/BgvW4JZDzl
#CancerMoonshot will support data collection from many institutions &amp; require #datasharing https://t.co/6s4Y5LDuHh
Increased data sharing is front and center with the #CancerMoonshot. The Moonshot has already had a positive impact with more to come -DL https://t.co/fMtS51lVP3
First step is timely release of all data. New rule requires that w/in 1 year for all U.S. Clinical Trials. #CancerMoonshot https://t.co/rrVgta21mg
#NIH/ @theNCI continues to strongly support basic research that does not have immediate clinical implications.  #CancerMoonshot -DL https://t.co/7maJ33ksnP
Tough problem, but a major focus of current clinical trials, especially immunoTx.  Check out: https://t.co/3etPVug6vZ #CancerMoonshot https://t.co/RndErf7zBD
We want to tackle all &amp; that includes working with @US_FDA who is determined to accelerate review of cancer clinical trials. #CancerMoonshot https://t.co/nW9FuhCqYG
Increasing patient participation in #clinicaltrials is an important goal of the #CancerMoonshot. There is no targeted percentage – DL https://t.co/510mjR1epY
#NIH invests 53% of its budget on basic science. The next breakthrough in cancer might come from a totally unexpected place. #CancerMoonshot https://t.co/7maJ33ksnP
We must advocate for sustained increased funding for biomed research and for prioritizing support for young investigators-DL #CancerMoonshot https://t.co/SCo9uRffYL
A major focus of #CancerMoonshot is building teams w/patients as partners. Do you agree @MargaretAinDC? https://t.co/6nDcM9DznA

.@BL00DB0RN Research provides the evidence needed for effective mgmt &amp; care, so it’s all part of the same solution. #NIHchat
.@statesdj A sophisticated question hard to answer in a Tweet but we believe this can be managed #NIHchat
.@orphanwriter based on NIH coding, $3.5B/year (11%) on #RareDisease research. NIH largest funder of #RareDisease research in world.#NIHchat
.@RecursionChris It is critical for industry to make compounds available for rare diseases that are already known to be safe #NIHchat
.@TheChildrensInn Safe and effective treatment as soon as possible! #NIHchat
.@DR_E_A_M precision and personalized are about the same and include genomics, but also environment and health behavior. #NIHchat
.@4P_Pharama All of the #NIH Institutes work on rare diseases and it’s good to have that integration. #NIHchat
.@anisaderr @US_FDA on average approves drugs faster than Europe. Be careful about safety of unapproved Tx. #NIHchat
.@Wilsvick #RareDisease advocates should make point that research on rare diseases informs common diseases. We all benefit. #NIHchat
.@Birth_Writer There are new designs that involve only a few dozen patients, which helps for diseases where it's hard to find more #NIHchat
.@Wilsvick If you count # of Americans affected by #RareDisease, it’s about 26 million, so everyone likely knows a family affected. #NIHchat
.@SDFatPhRMA Many are due to DNA misspellings, in those cases genome sequencing can provide rapid answers. #NIHChat
.@alsadvocacy #RareDiseases teach us about common diseases &amp; vice versa #NIHchat
.@alsadvocacy You can never tell where a breakthrough will come from so it’s best to support research across the board #NIHchat
.@CROWRDREAM That’s why 1 million participants is so critical; we need to ensure representation across all ethnic &amp; racial groups #NIHChat
.@wchung Good idea, drugs that encourage cancer cells to senesce are a promising approach. #NIHchat
.@Wilsvick NIH makes decisions based on scientific opps &amp; health needs, but we could do more w/more resources. #NIHchat
.@emilymullin We are working to define rigorous methods to be sure the answers are 100% reliable. #NIHchat
