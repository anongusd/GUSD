PRESS RELEASE - President Stands Firm on Need for Border Barrier and Ending Asylum Abuse, Says FAIR https://t.co/rvSr9mBkPD
"Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.  So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
"Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way way down."
"In the past, most of the people in this room, including @SenSchumer voted for a wall -- but the proper wall never got built.  I will get it built."
"I pledge to you tonight, that I will never abolish ICE"
"In the last 2 years, our brave @ICEgov officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings."
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for highlighting the angel families who deserved better. They are why we need secure borders. They are what the immigration debate should be about.
Democrats resist Trump and the facts: By their grimaces tonight they show they simply don't believe the borders are under siege, or that border enforcement matters. Where's the unity of purpose as a nation?
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is actually very cruel."
"Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.”
“We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.”		@realDonaldTrump reminds us – the most important stakeholders in U.S. immigration policy are the American people, not the people who break our laws.
"This is a moral issue.  The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans."
"Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
It’s deeply offensive to invite illegal aliens to the State of the Union. The rule of law is the bedrock foundation of our democracy and giving VIP treatment to people who consciously and proudly violate the law speaks volumes about the Democrats’ contempt for it.
