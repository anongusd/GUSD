@realDonaldTrump Great! You won‚Äôt be missed.
Thank you @AdCouncil for telling the stories of discrimination that #LGBT people face day in and day out. These brave individuals show why we need equal treatment for all. https://t.co/LsNw0wHxU6
@Franklin_Graham You‚Äôre welcome to hold discriminatory views. It‚Äôs your 1st amendment right. But ‚Äî as a public official ‚Äî you MUST uphold equality for everyone, regardless of your personal views. So, if you advocate discrimination against your own citizens, no, you shouldn‚Äôt hold public office.

@RyanNewYork civil disobedience is resisting a law designed to oppress you. she's not engaging in civil disobedience but insubordination
@RyanNewYork my point exactly. That's why the precedent is so scary.
@RyanNewYork hyperbole perhaps but when 1 says 1 does not have to obey laws because God tells you not to, where does the slippery slope end?
@RyanNewYork that wasn't about her looks it was about her beliefs which are, like his, theocratic in nature

@NewMissionWkshp nice empathy for a family who lost their son. Happy Thanksgiving: hope nothing that awful ever happens to your family

@spookie_1 thanks for showing some empathy for the family jenny. It sadly seems in short supply on social media these days.
@spookie_1 agreed! But should a twelve  year old for because he did a db thing kids are wont to do?
@Cletis4 if we shot every idiot in America we would depopulate the country.
@JesseHiggason I'm liking you more with each tweet. :-)
@gtawwekid dumb, yes. Lots of 12 year olds are. I sure was. But I don't think they deserve to die.
@JesseHiggason ok I guess we agree on that!
@IchibanRon sorry: it's not "cop hating garbage" to express concern about the death of 12 year old with toy gun. It's freedom of expression.
@JesseHiggason what about all those white people carrying guns to support open carry laws: should they be shot too?
I'm impressed by how many people immediately said it was ok for a cop to take 2 seconds before deciding to shoot a 12 year old. #ferguson
