It is now untenable to pretend there was no collusion between agents and entities aligned with Russia and Trump campaign operatives to subvert the 2016 election. Only substantial question is its full scope and nature and whether those activities violated U.S. law. #TrumpRussia
It remains to be determined whether Russian funds funneled to #MichaelCohen is another instance of Russian help for the person it helped win the 2016 election. This question must be answered &amp; that calls for investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/7VPusqGXp3

How could the Chief of Staff not know that his Staff Secretary was charged with domestic violence when the Chief of staff knew that the FBI could not provide the Staff Secretary with a full security clearance?  The answer is simple.  They just do not care about domestic violence.

Erica also stood alongside ‚Äúmy sister‚Äù and her Grandmother Gwen Carr, a Mother of the Movement. She pushed back against injustice and pushed America to be better when others faded away. We will miss this young spirited woman. No doubt her spirit will remain as we mourn her loss.
Today, we lost a young champion with a big heart who fought for justice with passion and who achieved much at such a young age. She fought for all of us.  And she fought for her dad Eric Garner who deserved justice. #EricGarner #BlackLivesMatter

Our system of elections is predicated on the premise of fairness and accuracy in reflecting the people's will.  Accordingly, Judge Moore should recognize that he lost, proceed with dignity, and help us restore the Voting Rights Act so that all voters are protected.

We are living in challenging times and law enforcement faces difficult challenges in keeping our homeland secure and our people safe.
The homicide rate in the United States is about 6.9 times higher than the combined rate in 22 other populous highly-developed countries.
We must keep weapons intended for military use out of the hands of persons who would use them to massacre civilians.
Clearly, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you're too dangerous to buy a gun!
I've introduced H.R. 5470, the ‚ÄúStop Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act,‚Äù it will prohibit transferring a semiautomatic assault weapon.
We can make it more difficult for those who would do our people and communities harm by making those weapons more difficult to obtain.
