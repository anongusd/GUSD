@DrewMeseck laying out a concrete case -- as always. I think @Hickenlooper is going to occupy a really interesting sphere in the primary: progressive goals accompanied by non-dogmatic policy approaches. I cannot wait to see what he has to offer! https://t.co/NcYnFy5kCI

Congratulations to @MaxRose4NY in the #NY11 congressional district! You are going to make an excellent congressman
@ForecasterEnten Someone's not adhearing to AP Stylebook Poll reporting guidelines... I see those decimal points @FOX5Atlanta
@realDonaldTrump This is all we get from our Commander in Cheif... sad. Thank you @VP for your strong condemnation of this horrific act of terrorism. I wish I could say the same about our President.

@ForecasterEnten NY-11! Only republican district in New York City. The district got a ton of coverage in the primary (Michael Grimm v. Dan Donivin), but the dropped off for the general even though the Democrat @MaxRose4NY is putting up a great fight! Going to be a great race to discuss/watch!
@JasonKander The only word to describe this is brave. Thank you for everything that you have done to inspire millions of people across this country. I can not wait to see you get through this and come out even stronger than you were before. Keep fighting -- we are with you, Jason.
Trump just claimed that he got 52% of the woman's vote. That is a lie. Trump received 52% of the WHITE WOMAN'S vote. #TrumpPressConference
