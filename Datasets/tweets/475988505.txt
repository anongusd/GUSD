.@SenatorCollins — political courage and class. I salute my wonderful friend and her principled leadership.
Happy to congratulate @WalkerStapleton on a terrific primary victory last night, and to join him in thanking those backing his campaign for Colorado Governor. Walker is good man, and will do a great job if elected.

Quite moved by this announcement by @MethodistHosp. The atrium is beautiful, but recent developments notwithstanding I have not taken up residence here. The doctors, nurses and support staff are so nice, but the second I get the green light I’m outta here. https://t.co/VkWHmxzI6c
My family and I thank Mayor @SylvesterTurner, his terrific staff, @houstonpolice, @METROHouston, @SBCHouston, @StMartinsDOK — and really all Houstonians — for your professionalism and obvious care in making Barbara's visitors and funeral guests feel so welcomed. Thank you all.
