@Hunde_Haus @K9Apart Yes...horrible!....He does get for real angry though...like when he gets in trouble(ie. Has an accident in the house)...although rare, its hilarious, he'll growl back at me 😳😁
@Hunde_Haus @K9Apart Nikki pretending to be angry...he's playing around after a bath &amp; being toweled off.

@chronically_abi ...keep talking about it to the ppl u know that luv u-until ur ready to talk about other things. This moment in time is temporary, it will eventually pass. Is there anything u can learn from now?
@chronically_abi Dealing with prednisone/steroids, especially given any particular length of time, can be difficult (to say the very least). It can make hiding a disorder impossible...especially in adolescence/young adulthood (as if there isn't already enough going on)...Just keep talking about..
@9ODayFianceTLC Wow thank you so much for saying so...The Mask of Sanity, is a great read. It may take a little work to get the original work from 1940's (1948-I believe) but if u can find it, it's worth it.
Thank you for checking out my article. Hope u liked it! 😁😁😁

@KevinHooverK910 @RCSD U go pup!!...or should I say Mr Lady's pup...u hv girl friends all over...!! 😳😀😀
@jereth_samson @gsrescueelite Today's menu for my pups is self fed Eukanuba with a side of whatever Im having(i.e. Mac n cheese, Ramen, pizza etc...a nutritionist I am not) 😀
@jereth_samson @gsrescueelite Good to know they will be eating far better than us-they deserve all of it! 😀
@SheriffChody @K9Nemo @lifetimetv Id still like to get a calendar if possible. 😀
@marcusdipaola @melissalrobbins Thank goodness u guys are there! Id no sooner leave my dogs than I would children. People please dont do this!!
@jereth_samson @gsrescueelite Well hope the GSD pup finds a forever place asap. My pups would probab lov the raw meat...but their also used to marinades &amp; ordering options (my fault).
@melissalrobbins @K9Falo Been there too with my first GSD puppy pup....she went through 3 couches-literally. I made alot of mistakes with her but she was an awesome dog. Like Ms. Maddi-Im wrapped pretty hard around their paws...so onto the flooring store 😳
@gsrescueelite She totally deserves the pork chops but hope theyll be cooked right?
@melissalrobbins @K9Falo Uhh...hmm..mmm...yea i checked....chomp...chew..im definitly the best girl. https://t.co/ssfkSqXAoQ

@Dealingwithinc1 ...Im not saying Chrons doesnt totally suck-it does &amp; its very REAL, especially when uve got active dx!
@Dealingwithinc1 Yes I know &amp; w/o going into all the details-ive got some idea of wht u mean. With the strength &amp; the power u DO have, what kinds of things make u a little less focused on ur dx?....
@gsrescueelite This is heartbreaking. Anyone who knows the GSD code of conduct/inherent loyalty they have to their owner(even when they dont deserve it) knows it likely contributed to his death. Shame on them!
@Dealingwithinc1 Hey chrons peeps! Would like to remind u, u are not your dx, its only a part of u (albeit sometimes a violent/messed up part...)but none the less, a PART. Dont let this dx define u!
@NatPoliceAssoc Hey Guys!! Thanks for following!
@ReginsJuen @joclarke232 @K9Falo Hes a triple threat kinda guy....handsome + charming + a winning personality.....
@gsrescueelite Totally agree! Im not sure any breed could manage this well but this has got to be pure hell for a GSD! Tells u alot about the human-who doesnt deserve the breed in the first place!! Come on people, we hv to do better!!!

@ibreatheflames @DrunkFed @PoliceUg @RedPepperUG @Ugaman01 @beewol @kasujja @jkkarungi Goodness, how terrible...what happened? My first guess is this man appeared either medicated, off meds/maybe too many, intoxicated, maybe mentally ill? Either way-obviously no excuse... .
@OurHeroDogs Andrew...aka-"Andy"
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Im geuinely asking, how would u hv known if Mr.Putin was lying?He is well trainined in deception/adved interviewing etc so how were u deciding this?
@EBraeden Im sorry for ur loss &amp; it is truely a loss. We're soo lucky to be entrusted with the care of GSDs &amp; the time goes by so fast. Maybe when ur ready, u can have another one in ur passed dogs' honor.
@brittanyacbd How did u decide when it is/isnt worth ur time?
@ShepherdsDaily ....dont let the GSD cute fool u....there's a whole lotta trouble wrapped up in all that cute!! 😳😜😜😀

@Jmiller423 @TheTalkCBS With all due respect, alot of people have Bipolar Dx &amp; dont behave this way. We werent there so its difficult to say but Im wondering what else was happening w the person u mentioned.
@Averytwenty Your not alone...Watching it &amp; Reminded of the horrible tradegy re; Rosemary/lobotomy...Our history of care the mentally ill is tradegic yet so important. So sorry we didnt know better!

@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite Thx! My boy is the best. Hes sorta big but super gentle-gentle giant according to some. Hes super smart too...plus, the girl dogs love him.
@MariahCarey Sooo well said &amp; more timely than u know!
@gsrescueelite Makes sense...theres a number of pups uve posted that id love to have.
@sheppolly @gsrescueelite Thx for asking....no he said dirt like granuales."
@gsrescueelite Do u guys ever rehome these beautiful pups to the U.S.?
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite Hey, hows ur beagle baby?
@valtester59 @gsrescueelite Thank you! He seems better today &amp; hes eating good. Sooo hope this is just a UTI. 😀
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite Nikki seems a little better than yesterday. He ate good-full bowl of his Eukanuba(small bites 😀) &amp; ate atleast 10 cookies. Hes so good-he even ate his 2 chewable antibotics (without any xtra hotdogs).
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...im a pretty patient person &amp; Im only just really worried about him. Dont care about belongings like the love seat(1 of 2 pee spots)-just want him happy, healthy &amp;safe...i'll move mountains to try to get that for him!
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite When it comes to my boy Nikki I guess im one of "those kind of moms" that he can do no wrong-well mostly, &amp; it would take waayy more than that to get me mad at him...
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ....which ofcourse at that point i become my late father &amp; say...."Well, ok...we're gonna try alil harder next time right? U AND ghost dog are gonna try harder to tell me when u gotta go out right &amp; i'll try to listen better." ...i know, im so wrapped...!
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...me in the doorway, stand up on his hind legs &amp; put his front paws up on both my shoulders with head hung &amp;play growling, &amp; "momma ur gonnabe mad but ghost dog snuck in again. Swear i tried to stop him."
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...on the potty accidents, even funnier is theres been several times lately if Im in a diff room &amp; about to walk into the accid rm, he'll stop me...
@ShepherdsDaily What?..... . https://t.co/dKI2zdrUwZ
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ....if i say anything to him like "who did this potty in the house? U do this potty?"  He"ll start play growling like he gets alil mad at me...mad that, tht one ghost dog snuck in again 😳😳
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...after he has whatever accident in the house he'll come find me with his head hung &amp; its like he"s tellin on himself...&amp;
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite About Nikki"s potty time-yes hes having alot of pee accidents in the same 2 spots in the house...on a funny note...
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...hope her fits arent that!
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...vet said she was waaay too young to be hving the symptoms she was hving. Said she likely had distemper and probably wouldnt survive the tx.
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...w/in the first 12hrs of bringing her home she was sleeping and went into full blown horrible siezures. Rushed her to the pet ER &amp;...
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite Ur beagle baby sounds lucki to hv u. U mentioned she's hving fits...i hope the fits arent actually seizures. Long long time ago i had a huski pup 8wks old....
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...i was hoping maybe it was bc he was examined or bc maybe the antibotics are helping push out whatever infection is present. I planned on calling in tom am to ask about it.
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite I did mention the blood thing but by the time of the appoint it had only occured once or twice in total. Over this weekend its been happening more like one drop every few hours...
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite No... i hv seen him do that kind of thing once in a awhile maybe like 2 or 3 times his whole life but not recently at all.
@gsrescueelite Thank u for ur thoughts, i really appreciate them....and yes, he is soooo handsome, im sooo in love w this pup &amp; sooo wrapped around his paw.
@CindyAnneMunro @gsrescueelite ...feeling a little bit better since we started the antibotic-Baytril 68mg tabs 1 &amp; 1/2 pills 2x a day. What do u think?

@gsrescueelite Thx again &amp; I definitely will!
@SiDix67 One could argue that laws governing the protectn of service animals shd be harsher than that of humans-Their nt able to provide consent..(despite what the avrg working GSD would hv one believe).
@gsrescueelite ...the pee sample taken was very very small &amp; done outside. Nikki has truelly been an amazing/pretty close to perfect dog! He deserves soo much better!
@gsrescueelite Thx so much! I just want to educate myself on this &amp; try to get him whatever he needs. Im hoping its just a urinary tract infection...

@ameliamheinle @YRInsider @ginatognoni @sharonlcase Your performance of someone in a domestically violent relationship was so POWERFUL! Beside the obvious Grammy u earned, know uve made a huge diff in the lives of many!

@noybsk2017 @thedailybeast Much like assessing one's risk factors for acquiring cancer, there are risk factors to assess ones risk for future acts of violence to start with.
@noybsk2017 @thedailybeast Ppl need to udrstd there is no one single factor that if ided is gonna stop various acts of vio.. Instead there is a constellation of factors that need effective &amp; honest eval...plenty of blame to go around!
