@AnthonyDiComo I know we say this EVERY year.... But, IF they stay healthy and Cespy comes back as his old self - Mets have one hell of a lineup to support that pitching!
I completely agree-but I'm definitely not holding my breath. Thanks Bernie Madoff for preventing this big market team from spending like one:( https://t.co/5Twq0Wsv3o
@NeverDotard Your right. Unfortunately, I do think he is. The superdelegates and DWS kind of screwed bernie over and created a D civil war. That's why I'm leaning towards Warren this year - for that reason alone. But in the end - I'll support any D candidate over what we have.
@NeverDotard hypotheticals are tough. Trump won 18 states by fewer than 250,000 votes.  Much closer than people think.  I think Bernie would have outperformed Hillary in many. She was too polarizing. Bernie and Trump both represented anti-establishment.  That's what the masses want.
@NeverDotard Ironically - Warren/Bernie are the 2 biggest anti-establishment candidates on the ticket. That's exactly why they have the best chance of beating Trump. And if D's got smart - would know they have the best chance of winning
@Mazzarella20 I wish! Definitely not holding my breath! And then there's that bellicheat guy. He's not going anywhere anytime soon. ü§¨ü§¨
I bet on the Pats and still wholeheartedly rooted for the Rams to win the entire game. My brain has many levels of complexity. At least I'm miserable with a little more $$ now.
@NathanHRubin If you had a time machine and took $1 billion in cash back to Jan 1, 1 AD. You could burn $1000 a day every day, and you would still have over $250 million left today.
Dems hating on Shultz for running as an independent is the exact reason why we should fix our broken political system by implemented ranked choice voting. More independents (def not less) is exactly what we need in this era of polarization!
@NanaHeidy223 @RussOnPolitics Ahh - gotcha
@RussOnPolitics Bernie running as an independent would be a nightmare for the Democratic party. It would pretty much guarantee a 2nd Trump term.  Any sane person needs to support whoever wins the D primary. He/She will be better than the alternative!
With all of this democratic gloating - the country will not be in a good place in a month and 3 weeks from now. We will be back in exactly the same place we were yesterday - except Trump will be much less likey to fold.
@TheRealJAG @GEAggas BP did not always want a wall. They used to think it was a waste of $$ as well. They are just now being made by this administration to say so. https://t.co/fdP0fGmYYb
NFL playoff rule change - both teams should have a chance to score in OT (college style) regardless(TD or fg, u should have a chance to match) A special talent like mahommes never got to pay in ot. NFL is not doing their sport justice.
I also understand the very complex science of how shovels work.
I listen to both sides.
I feel like those close calls always go the pats way. Let's see
To end asinine shutdown, Dems should offer Trump/GOP $10B towards 'immigration security" specifically to spend on ports of entry and any vulnerable security threat(s).Absolutely no money towards a worthless physical barrier. Deal would make both sides happy.
I never thought flopping would be applicable to the NFL - but of course Tom Brady would be the recipient.
Todd Bowles should have accused the refs of placing bets on the Packers today (with absolutely no evidence). Use your inner Donald Trump Mr Bowles!
Phew!! Jets had we really worried today. I thought they were actually gonna win. Most conservative playcalling ever for a team playing for nothing. No offense. Bowles has no balls.
Bowls does not know how to show any urgency. Ever! That will be his downfall. Down by 2 tds with 7+ minutes left in the 4th quarter with a team that has next to no chance of making playoffs. Let's punt.  #firebowles #jets
I absolutely love this! https://t.co/Q7B884EJfT
@realDonaldTrump You got that that caravan? Now don't forget to check Twitter on your cell phones...
Our president is just a rich, white, privlidged Don King who only promotes himself. I feel like he says the same thing in every interview. Same exact talking points regardless of what he is asked. Won't this get boring to everyone after 4 years? https://t.co/9N58NSCBLG
If only more people thought this way - especially politicians -  this world would be a better place. https://t.co/12qarRtCKK
Remember when Bledsoe got injured by the Jets and Tom Brady was born? History repeating itself? Hmmm. At least the browns aren't in the AFC east! #jets
RT @jefferiesshow: Corporations are not your friends. If you want to affect real change, donate to charity! Buying Nikes to support Black L‚Ä¶
I'm really not used to seeing a Jets score that starts with a 4. I can certainly get used to it! Go Jets!!!
Politics often frustrates me. This explains some of my frustration very well: "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.‚Äù	Isaac Asimov
@BillOReilly I think your 'jump' to conclusions matt just malfunctioned. It's amazing how quickly people are just ready to turn on allies that have supported the US for so many years.  Why don't you Just say hail Trump
@billmaher The biggest difference between the left and the right is that "liberals" are willing to actually admit when the other side does something right. Well said @billmaher.
The 1st president in 40 yrs to not release his own taxes to the public is the driving force behind the 1st major tax overhaul law in 30 yrs. Ironic? Only if you actually believe Trump knows what's in the bill.

@RichCimini Good GMs pay market value for a player. Supply and demand dictate what a player is worth. Fitz - go get more if you can...
