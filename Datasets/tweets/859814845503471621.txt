At Will Employment is faulty. There should be contractual rules that prevent employers from dismissing employees without adequate rationale during an employee's 6 month probation period.
No more job interviews. Give the candidate a test to pass instead. Ideally, give them a description of their job and then have them work at it for a day. If they perform well enough they earn the position.
Sale, posession, and use of all substances should be legalized. Place recommended dosages based on body shape and size on packages to aide in preventing unlawful behavior.
Legislation needs to be created to control America's population growth. Registration with one's state to ensure one can conceive without burdening our planet. 7.2 billion is already excessive.
No more days off for holidays. Celebrate the holiday either the weekend before or the weekend after.
Higher investment into ecto-genesis. I want to be able to reproduce on my own.
Everyone should be required to work 9-5 pm except for retail stores. They will be open 11-7 pm. Buy your 'necessities' after work.
Children should be required to attend school year round. Summer breaks are anachronistic.
$22 minimum wage and a 20 hour work week to count as full-time.
