That Tweet was a few back. And I‚Äôve already broken my 3 replies rule on Twitter about this because you were making so little sense. Night
@PhilGChapman @Annette_Taddeo So Guaid√≥ is ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù on the ‚Äúcenter left‚Äù. 		Lol. 		Have a good night. https://t.co/v0VSE04I3G

@foswi They can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre doomed. But I‚Äôd rather be doomed without expanding the police stare and incarcerating people
@PhilGChapman One more time		https://t.co/Vwn1nJv73e
@JuanPenalosa @helepoleo @FlaDems You said ‚Äúinvited to the presser.‚Äù The presser invite doesn‚Äôt say Guaid√≥. 		Solution: write better press advisories, make sure the Helenas of the world get them.
@AdamWeinstein @helepoleo @MiamiDadeDems @FlaDems @jguaido Nexus being foreign policy and immigration, at least as I implicitly understood it. 		Pivoting from that, I don‚Äôt understand where there‚Äôs not more Dem message discipline to pin the GOP down on TPS for Venezuelans
@PhilGChapman @Annette_Taddeo I never said coup. You did. And you said ‚Äúright wing‚Äù but then said Guaid√≥ isn‚Äôt right wing. The goalpost-moving is jarring		It‚Äôs a bit hard to follow. But you do seem to want to argue about this. And I have the person for you. 		https://t.co/JaccsjBvm2

@lissie_w It was not a sane response based both on 1) what I wrote and 2) what I have written. 		The most reasonable explanation is anger
@JuanPenalosa You referenced your advisory. I posted the advisory. So yes. I get to hold you to it. 		What‚Äôs wrong with printing Guaid√≥s name? Oversight?		BTW, your problem is with the Helenas of your party. You might want to chat with her
@PhilGChapman Lol. You think Guaid√≥ is a right-winger?
@AdamWeinstein @helepoleo @MiamiDadeDems @FlaDems @jguaido It‚Äôs an emotional issue so I didn‚Äôt see it as not being germane
@lissie_w Well, I can accuse you of projecting. But I‚Äôll hit chalk your reply up to ignorance. It‚Äôs odd because you follow me that you would have this take. However, it seems that if you don‚Äôt understand, you should unfollow if you‚Äôre getting this needlessly mad

@treehuggingsis You think people generally are emotionally, viscerally attached to health insurance policies?
People generally do not have an emotional, visceral attachment to a health insurance policy. A relationship with a doctor is another matter. But insurance plans? Doubtful. 		So the fuss over Sen Harris‚Äôs call to eliminate private insurance plans is likely more noise than signal

@jimhigdon sorry. I got my announcement days crossed
Tweet corrects prior post that had a specific date (Wednesday probably not the day). Also, DeSantis was relaying the thoughts of voters, not him
DeSantis said he‚Äôll make an announcement on medical marijuana soon. He said people are ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù and that they think there has been ‚Äúfoot-dragging‚Äù with implementing the amendment https://t.co/CXXm8kzQHz
@Maccagnano_Life @RonDeSantisFL Live tweeting and the announcement hasn‚Äôt been sent out via email
DeSantis promises an announcement concerning Israel and Florida soon, says he‚Äôll be back soon
Judge Luck closes with the blessing known as Ata Chonen from the Jewish prayer, Amidah: ‚ÄúYou grace humans with wisdom and teach humanity perception. Bestow upon us Your knowledge, insight and understanding. Blessed are you the grantor of wisdom.‚Äù
Judge Luck praises DeSantis for his support of ‚ÄúIsrael and, by extension, the Jewish community.‚Äù He bites he‚Äôs the first Jewish member of the Florida Supreme Court in 20 years. Luck shifts to judicial philosophy: ‚ÄúThe constitution, not the judiciary, is supreme.‚Äù
Judge Luck, noting he went to kindergarten at Scheck Hillel Community School where the announcement was held, says he‚Äôs a 5th generation Floridian: ‚Äúservice is a team sport.‚Äù
DeSantis said Judge Luck has a cool temperament and was attacked by a defendant physically in court. DeSantis: ‚ÄúJudge Luck immediately dusted himself off, repeated what happened for the record and refused himself from the case.‚Äù
Circuit Judge Robert Luck appointed to Florida Supreme Court by Gov. @RonDeSantisFL who calms him a ‚Äúman for all seasons.‚Äù  It‚Äôs DeSantis 2nd Miami appointee. DeSantis said the former prosecutor and judge was one of many qualified applicants: ‚Äúmy cup truly runneth over.‚Äù

@Saltlifeismine He said he wouldnt have originally signed the law re this. But he hasnt said (hasnt been asked) if he'd sign a repeal. There's resistance to a repeal in the Florida Senate
Here's the executive order 	https://t.co/VBoZvlytNR
Here's our story	https://t.co/KsJtJlaaFe
"This is about politics, not about Parkland," says suspended Broward Sheriff Scott Israel. "I will speak out against gun violence and I will continue to speak out against gun violence until the rest of my days on earth."		A new battle over guns has begun		https://t.co/HuHm65CSda
Why did Gov. Scott not suspend Israel?	"You'll have to ask Governor Scott," DeSantis said. He also noted that Scott didn't suspend a troubled Okaloosa County superintendent that he suspended this morning.
"Why was no one at the FBI fired?" DeSantis asked of the agency's repeatedly ignoring warning about the Parkland killer before he went on his spree. "It was a complete dereliction of duty." He said the agency has performed a "bureaucratic two-step" and avoided accountability.
"If the families come to me, I'm certainly willing to listen to that," DeSantis says of the push to suspend School Superintendent Robert Runcie.	The catch: DeSantis said he might not have the authority to suspend an appointed school  superintendent. He can suspend an elected one
New Sheriff Tony pledges "I am not here for any type of political or grandiose agenda. I'm here to serve."
"On the same day I pardoned the Groveland Four, Greg Tony will be the first black sheriff of Broward County," DeSantis said, noting that what was key in Tony's appointment was the "content of his character" and his qualifications
DeSantis: "I have no interest in dancing on Scott Israel‚Äôs political grave." He praises new Sheriff Gregory Tony, who had a security company that specialized in active shooter training
Also, Parkland dads Fred Guttenberg and Tony Montalto are here, too, supporting DeSantis‚Äôs decision
DeSantis is flanked by three Parkland parents (Andrew Pollack, Ryan Petty &amp; Max Schachter) who lauded the suspension of Israel and the appointment of Tony.
Ron DeSantis just announced that Sheriff Israel was suspended from office and, as we first reported in this story below, appointed Gregory Tony as his replacement https://t.co/HLtNOpiK7B

We had a good conversation, Bezos guard &amp; I, about the limits of privacy, the rights of a public figure and, of course, the hypocrisy of the Washington Post owner having a guard confront a woman who dared take a picture of him because she thought it was cool. Transcript below 4/4 https://t.co/WiattQBzZb
I asked the guard for the Washington Post‚Äôs owner why he asked the woman in the restaurant to delete a photo of Bezos &amp; his friend dining nearby &amp; he said  ‚Äúpeople are trying to enjoy dinner‚Äù and praised the woman for having the ‚Äúcommon courtesy and decency‚Äù to delete the pic 3/4
I thought it a bit hypocritical for the owner of a major media company to have a guard exercise a type of censorship of a private citizen over a photo. The woman agreed as did a friend of hers (who took a pic of Michelle Obama in the same restaurant w/no problem from guards) 2/4
So about this pic of Bezos dining w/his alleged mistress/mystery woman in DC last month. I coincidentally was there. More scandalous to me @ the time was the Washington Post‚Äôs owner's guard got a woman to delete a pic of it. She felt uneasy &amp; complied 1/4 https://t.co/xDvY3MBD6l

@JamesMcGrew1 @RonDeSantisFL Lol. He just hasn't been suspended. Yet.
I'm told by top sources close to DeSantis that 1) he did not suspend Israel 2) he plans to suspend Israel when 3) he decides on a replacement for Israel but is still reviewing candidates
@TooProlix @Wudang96 @Publix 100%
So to be clear: DeSantis was sworn in TODAY. His administration starts in full force TOMORROW.
@blessedbradys Welcome to electronic (and sloppy NY) media
@blessedbradys @RonDeSantisFL ugh. false
Whelp. Apparently the NY Post, is sticking with DeSantis "suspended" Israel when it has not happened. Again, it has not happened YET. https://t.co/NUVfwSMe6t
I'm not dissing the reporters. Everyone gets it wrong at least once. But if you're out-of-state media and you're reporting Florida stories, be careful about your sources for a Tallahassee story. And if you get it wrong, own up and move on.
Unfortunately for FOX, its Twitter image card still bears the false headline that Gov. @RonDeSantisFL suspended Broward Sheriff Scott Israel. DeSantis did not. Yet. FOX went offsides and used bad sources to do so. The story is more accurate but it should come with a correction https://t.co/Vi3oiZyT9y
@witherspoon_ron Y2K bingo
@MontanaHippy @KyleKashuv It‚Äôs false. DeSantis is 99.99% likely to suspend Israel. But today is not that day.

@MidrangeMoses @AbramsonFL Yeah, my sentence is carefully worded. Trump is 		1) "favored" (because he's an incumbent and they usually win and)		2) "at this point," which is now when he has no serious announced candidates against him.
@AbramsonFL A safer way to say it is that Trump is favored to win FL at this point
@megansmolenyak Sumter County, home of the mammoth/booming Villages retirement community, had a 76.5% turnout in the gov race, highest in FL (61.6% t/o ). It backed DeSantis over Gillum by 70-29%.		Collier t/o: 72.2%. DeSantis over Gillum: 65-34%.		DeSantis loses the race w/out them
More US residents moved to Florida (133k) than to any other state in the past year.
