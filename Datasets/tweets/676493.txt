@jbeals Precisely! I think most people who are invested here moved to apps to make it easier, the web is way too linear.
@meghanbeattie I haven't heard anything yet, but I see their flaws. They'd need Twitter to report those numbers to be accurate.
If you're like me, you switched to an app within the first month or so. Does that explain the drop?
Interesting. Nielsen reported a 40% drop off on Twitter users, but they only track web traffic, not apps/mobile. Does the metric stand up?

@dgtlpapercuts It's hard to say. It really depends on where the community is. Could go back or to a new startup.
@Daan83 That depends on how easy it is to port it over. Open APIs will let another service handle that quickly. Still, people have to use it
@mleis Exactly. Brightkite is another one that seems to be getting a little traction. Still just a tremor.
@Daan83 That's very true, Twitter's value = people. The switching cost is very low, however and you could see some movement away.

@MackCollier @LewisG I'm with you both. Need to make the time and expand my topics a bit too.
@MackCollier Thanks 4 that, I feel behind on the blog. I need to stay around 2-3 posts per week to be really happy. I miss my readers!
@MackCollier I feel your pain.

@eyecube @nejsnave I am speaking more about the medium. Conversations happen everywhere, but the experience of itself will be social.

@badgergravling You're right, but it's already mainstream in the way people think about/limit/segment the tools into a broader construct.

@comcastcares I think it's very helpful and a nice best practice for any service business. Thanks for replying!
@TJustinMoore Relevance is super-critical on Twitter. Doesn't matter who you are.
@torstenherrmann I hate that as well. My biggest pet peeve are the ppl that thank everyone individually 4 following, never posting anything.
@TJustinMoore LMAO. No worries and thanks for clarifying to your peeps ;)
@TJustinMoore It is all about people after all. Some types of accounts do add value through links. It's about how I want to consume info.
@collisionbend Auto DMs seem to be the biggest thorn in everyone's side.
@shilpikadas Thanks for that. Taking things offline is something that @comcastcares seems to really get.
@hdbbstephen Agreed. Selling works in the right channel (see @delloutlet), but selling IS the value. Normally giving is the key.
@jinal_shah @shahpriya The only time I've seen protected updates have value is when you need to verify age. See @greygoosevodka
@JNels LMAO! Thanks for clarifying.
@shahpriya I'll check that out. Thanks!
@GeoffLiving I agree, and I'm not looking for rules so much as hints on how to succeed. There are really no rules. All depends on strategy.
@collisionbend HA! I've not heard of Twunk (tweet drunk), but I like it
@AJAG I rarely  follow people who do not have replies in their first page unless it's an informational account.
@SAJansky Wonderful! Not following those that follow you irks me as well. Hard to listen if you don't follow.
@jinal_shah Interesting. I'll keep me eyes open now that you mentioned it.
@JNels That's great. More context and specificity are needed across the board.
@SarahSchacht Ahhh...this is true. We should do an experiment (but I know you're right)
@kholloway I said brands, but it applies to everyone. Relevant content = being helpful = worth following
@rnadworny Now THAT is a great succinct way of putting it. Being helpful is the goal, eh?
@DJLitten That's one of the phrases that turns me away as well as people who boast follower counts.
@jimbrazytis Those are great. You have to be part of the larger community which = time/effort/connecting/sharing/living
@jinal_shah Very interesting. Thank you for that insight. Would love to get some examples of what you're talking about.
@melle Another great suggestion. I totally agree.
@gianandrea Fantastic! Thank you

@DJLitten LOL. That's a whole other can of worms. I think if most clients asked their agency how they've handled SEO in Flash they'd be mad.
@christopherscot That's a great point to keep in mind
@kalisurfer That's true, but I don't think people are aware of the pitfalls.
@sammillersells There are a lot of platforms that don't handle Flash well. Mobile is one.
@ejly I saw that the other day. Will be interesting to see the ETA.
@LenKendall I did see that. Will be a game changer on mobile platforms I think.
If your site is built in Flash it is invisible on iPhones (other devices). Something to think about.
@RogerSmolski It was a slightly different poster, but I did read it with my iPhone.

@BethHarte That completely flies in the face of this space IMHO. It's never been easier to learn by doing/reading/communicating. Oh well.

@shelleyryan I tried Tweetie, Twittelator, Twitter mobile, Hahlo, Twitterific, Twinkle
@rhino88888888 For me it's stability. Twittelator was crashing/not picking things up.
@chuckhemann It is easy. They need to add the "RT" shorcut for it though.
@chuckhemann I've given them all a thorough test and I like it better. Twitpic/search/multiple accounts
Finally settled on Tweetie as my Twitter iPhone app. Much more stable/functional for what I need it to do.
@lzone Exactly. Yesterday, however they were open and I posed that question about age verification. Smart on their part to pull it back.
@DJLitten They also changed their Twitter account to a private one where you have to request updates. Smart on their part.
@clevelandkevin Yikes! If it gets that bad I'll just stay at home :)
@repeatnone That's interesting to know. My updates from them come in waves
@repeatnone qwitter is very buggy. I stopped updates and it still sends them to me in waves.

@stevegarfield I saw that meme crossing Facebook. It's cool to see patterns that started in blogs move to a new platform and engage new ppl.
@LukeArmour has found a way to be more productive in this economic climate. He's ready for anything! http://tinyurl.com/b2bnrq

@AdamSinger Can't wait to hear your creation.

@Adam_Wilkens Google'
@Adam_Wilkens The issue is that *engagement* w/ the feed IS aligned with objectives. Very aligned. We need a better way to track it, U know?
@Adam_Wilkens Right now Feedburner, but I know the numbers aren't right. Nothing really comparable at this point. Too many downsides to move
@Marc_Meyer It's a very hard balance. Grouping in Tweetdeck helps a lot.
@joemarchese look for @dberkowitz at OMMA Social
@CIFF Agreed ;)
@Geletka Thanks for the RT.
@brianchappell It's an open opportunity esp for small business. Hyper local, measurable, conversational. Who could ask for more?
@webconsigliere Very nice, I'll place the order for you ;)
@myklroventine I cannot take credit. Saw it on a Tweet from the deli.
I like that a local deli is on Twitter (@martinsdeli) and is thinking of offering a TFD (Twitter follower discount). Smart and measurable.
@daveknox Cinci has a great network of them too. My dogs love visiting my parents (Mason) b/c they know it means trip to the dog park at VOA
@AmberCadabra Woot! Good to hear. Like I said it will make you look at things *very* differently.
Trying Grotto (new wine bar near me) service is horrible and selection is subpar. Low chance of return.

@Armano That would be nice. Let me know what you land on.
@whatsnext No problem. I've run into the same thing and that's WAY easier ;)
@Armano I like Hahlo myself. Pretty simple, no download (web-based)
@whatsnext As a workaround you can take the screenshot into Powerpoint, make the annotations and do another screenshot within PPT.
@GodsMac That's true, but it would have helped to have some assurance. Silence and lack of support is not a good thing.
Feedburner stats just bounced back to normal. Took six days to adjust. Don't lose hope ;)

@RichardatDELL We should do a photowalk after our hat/boot/buckle outing at SXSW. Any chance to shoot is alright with me.
@michsineath LMAO. 2 much of a good thing? Good web design is balancing content w/ form & adding function 2 add value, not sparkle.
@brandlessblog It's a constant struggle when you are here. Need a cool ideas exchange to match people with ideas/skill and help move to $.

@nicmitham They removed all of the stats you used to have to get you to go to Google Analytics #feedburner
If you use Feedburner and have not moved to Google yet, check out this post I just did that gives you the 411. http://tinyurl.com/9on9z5
@exitcreative Not many people can/would say that either.
@JasonFalls Highly recommended. Also Hahlo for Twitter, Shazam is a MUST have (blows people's minds), urbanspoon is good too

@exitcreative I feel like Marv Albert should be yelling out something now. That's cool in a creepy way ;)
@JasonFalls Do you have MobileMe? I use that with IMAP Gmail and it works like a charm. Worth the price.
@exitcreative Is it really any different than Jordan back in the day? ;)
@ConversationAge @livepath I'll send out a link to the video tomorrow. Need to shoot a little more of the "after" footage.
@ConversationAge Any time! I have a video of the process that I'll post tomorrow.
@AmberCadabra Hehe. That reminds me I need to update my annual "Google is stalking me" post http://tinyurl.com/6hfu48
@ConversationAge You have until Feb. 28 to switch (definitely do it before then) and you have an open invite to call me anytime you like :)
@ConversationAge Seems Google's play w/ Feedburner is the AdSense. I know few who use that. Feedburner is very removed from the users imho.
@AmberCadabra No choice at this point. They drop all of the analytics from the dashboard and make you use Google Analytics.
@ConversationAge Yes, they have had a 2 day drop. Help forums say it'll bounce back. I think there is a too many ppl changing at one time.
@AmberCadabra I just did it and seems to have worked so far. Took about an hour to transfer the big feed.
@jowyang I prefer the term "BlueTools" to describe them ;)
@jojobickley I've been reading stories about prolonged subscriber drops and emails not going out. I hope it works out well!
Moving Feedburner to Google account. Crossing Fingers. If you don't hear from the blog again, you know what happened ;)
@RichardatDELL @Armano Can't wait!

@jojobickley Very true. Too many people sell without knowing best practices or even ethical practices.

@andrewgerrard I saw that a couple of days ago. Context is so hard to have in 140 chars. Makes transparency all the more important.

@badbanana I have heard an equal mix on it. Time will tell if it works or flops.
Adobe Lightroom or Apple Aperture? Which is better for workflow and photo management?
@garymoneysmith seemed pretty un-MSFT to me. Of course it's high value it's a lead to something larger and there is lots of chatter.
@adamkmiec You and I are talking. Lots of major pickups as well. I've heard more about that ad than anything they've done for a while.
@collisionbend But you're talking about them. Would you have been otherwise? Was it really so bad in your opinion?
@garymoneysmith @badbanana Being in ANY conversation is better for them. Better than being forgotten. They need a strong follow up.

@Pistachio Agreed on Pownce, but Jaiku has all if not more of the features, but without the critical mass it's just an aggregator.
@Pistachio The technology is definitely there (Jaiku/Pownce/etc.) but it's the community that would all have to move at once.

Nice to see Feedburner is semi-back to normal
@Armano Which conference are you tweeting from? I've been out of the loop the past couple days.
@tangerinetoad That's exactly what I was thinking. The current system is just not that great.
@drewcovi I know it's not their fault, but it still makes me angry to not be able to give them more money ;)
@tangerinetoad Absolutely. Studios are missing the boat. I want movies through iTunes and am not going to watch them any other way until HBO
@tangerinetoad No late fees, but the movie dies 24 hours after you start watching. I started on a flight and couldn't finish and it expired.
@desaraev I completely agree. I think it's their deal with the studios. I would have bought at least 3 of the movies for my trip.
Anybody know why Apple stepped backward 10 years with their video rental service to the old Blockbuster model instead of being innovative?

@superbowlads Life Water gets a .5, still not really sure wtf.
@superbowlads Garmin 2.5, Toyota 2 (seems like I've seen it before...a lot)
I think Dell had their messaging wrong. Support (RED) should be before Buy a Dell. It reads better and would have made me more comfortable.
@superbowlads I chuckled at the FedEx commercial 4
@superbowlads UnderArmor ad gets a 3 (probably a 5 if you are male under age 21)

@freshpeel I am not sure. They're using 8 measurements now instead of 4.
@conversationage Thank you! Can I just tell you how much I am looking forward to seeing you again at Blogger Social?!
Did anybody else see the new AdAge power 150? Holy metrics batman! I seem to have jumped up a couple places.
It's official. I am now the Director, Digital Marketing at Fleishman-Hillard here in Cleveland. http://tinyurl.com/ynoxf4
@mackcollier I'll start the popper ;)
Announcing some big news later this afternoon. Stay tuned.
i could get used to weather like this in January
@Armano, @prblog or maybe this http://snurl.com/1wuvq
@prblog I think you're on to something Kevin.
@cfast It's a very strange look indeed.
@Armano Bingo. I think somebody fell in a pool of Kool-Aid.
What are your thoughts on the new Xerox logo? http://www.xerox.com Seems a bit off-brand for me.
@heyitsnoah LMAO I was just saying the same thing to my wife.
Checking out my Twitter stats here http://tinyurl.com/259jbf. Could TPM replace CPM? ;)
@Herb here is a good resource http://snurl.com/1wq4p
@freshpeel I'll be doing some live streaming, surely others will too. I'll let you know closer to the event.
Trying out Twhirl as an alternative to Twitterific. I'll let you know how it goes.
@ikepigott Lists are so 2007. We need to go list-free and move to who has the best content. A fruit-squid-jerky conference has some legs.
Hmm, it seems that Twitterific can't handle the tweet volume I am seeing. Anything else out there you guys like for Mac?
@dougmeacham Thanks for that! My goal is to be a filter to cut out the junk and focus on the key pieces that have value.
Buzz Friday is up now. Check it out to catch up on the week in social media and new marketing. http://tinyurl.com/25ta5g
@Aubs Hey I was thinking about skiing at Boston Mills this weekend...that's close to Tahoe skiing right? (kidding) Enjoy!

Heading out to run some errands, then working on Buzz Friday later today.
@georgenemeth I'll be tuned in!
Wrapped up reading Now is Gone by @GeoffLiving. Working on a review post.
Happy new year to you all!
@aermano sounds fabulous!
@dougmeacham happy new year to you too! wishing you and your family the best!
@philmang dry creek zin. very good.
drinking old vine zin with friends
@Herb Thanks for that suggestion. I most definitely will feature semantic apps.
Chris Brogan and Keith Ferrazzi have great tips on goal setting http://tinyurl.com/28qoje
Getting ready to head to the gym. Loading up the iPod
@dougmeacham One of the biggest pains is that you need to know MT's language to make design/structural changes. It's flexible, but a pain
@dougmeacham Depends on what you want to do. Typepad has its own limitations.
Qik crashes my browser. Anybody else having problems with it?
Welcome @onepinktee. Nice to tweet you.
@tbrunelle I got the Facebook message. Still no email. Very, very weird.
@MackCollier I have a couple people like that. I've had to drop and re-add to see updates.
@scobleizer I often accidentally hit the 'Mark all as read' button instead of the 'refresh' button. They should really separate those two.
@tbrunelle I did not. Can you resend it? Sorry about that.
Have you seen the Mountain Dew DewMocracy site? Interesting. http://www.dewmocracy.com
@jojobickley Thanks for that, glad you liked it. I enjoyed your top viral videos post.
Heading out to dinner with family, destination downtown Cincinnati.
How do you avoid doing stupid things in marketing? http://tinyurl.com/2gcae7
@ckepiphany Trust me it takes lots of practice to finally feel comfortable. Sound was okay for me. Loved the cat!
Anybody else out there with 37signals made one product with all of the best features in one place? Each is missing something from the others
@MackCollier She is custom made for video blogging.
Watching CK's video post. Look out world! http://tinyurl.com/2byv6a
@infinitypro Thank you.
@rodrakic thanks for weighing in!
@digitalmaverick thank you. that's a very valid point.
does the word fanboy have a positive or negative connotation to you?
how do you use this week to start the new year with a bang?
visiting my sister the barista
Slowly coming out of Christmas food induced coma. Hope everyone had a great holiday and a great last week of '07.
Finished the last of the wrapping, catching up on feed reading.
@prblog That's hilarious! Thanks for the link.
@ryankarpeles At a minimum, direct your domain to your blog until you decide on something else.
@Marti_L That's great news! Thoughts and prayers going out from here in Cleveland.
Am I too late with my peavatar? I hope not!
Heading to dinner with the wife.
I miss saying Merry Christmas in this PC world, so I'm saying it now. Merry Christmas!
@georgenemeth I have wondered the same thing. Seems arbitrary ;) Blogger meetup last night was fantastic btw.
Wouldn't you think Verizon would put a store in downtown Cleveland? Evidently not.
Trying to go cold-turkey and stop using Microsoft Office suite. Giving Google Docs a go. Anybody else made the switch?
Heading to the Cavs game. Hoping LeBron is playing.
@scottmonty I hope you have traction control on that driveway of yours. yikes!
Now *this* is football weather. I'm just glad I'm not there ;)
Buzz Friday post is up and live http://tinyurl.com/2ljonk
@DougMeacham The Shure's are petty amazing.
@acafourek Congrats man! Enjoy the day.
@gpittman, @tbrunelle Agreed. Seems to just sit there. Worst off, there is no way to auto-push tweets into it like on Jaiku.
@ByteEngine Agreed. Much easier to extend and develop around.
@infinitypro I am about the same way. I feel kind of bad about it though.
@servantofchaos I am the same way. I ignore it unless somebody adds me as a friend.
Is anybody using Pownce? If you are, what are you doing there? Are you active?
Off to the gym. If I don't tweet by 8pm, send help! I'll be curled up under the treadmill.
@davidmead Zocalo on E. 4th. Pretty good, cool vibe.
Just back from a great Mexican lunch downtown. Love the new restaurants opening up around Cleveland.
@ckepiphany No worries. I know where you stand and I know why you took that position.
Holy irrelevant PR pitches batman. *sigh*
A look at Beacon one month later http://tinyurl.com/2njhfy Would you recommend a client use it?
@acafourek I know. I wish they would concentrate more on the current seasons. I wonder if that will change to mirror what the other nets do
@mvellandi Yeah, I think the HD option is going to push more and more sites to adopt.
You've heard about NBC's Hulu video service. Check out my latest post to get a tour and see what it's all about. http://tinyurl.com/2lla9e
@markgoren I have been for a few weeks and really like it. It's Firefox in a more attractive package.
Copy of Now is Gone just arrived. Looking forward to reading it this weekend.
What should I do for the person who leaves comment #1000 on the blog? I'd like to do something unique. Send your suggestions to @mattdickman
@kaitswanson Thanks so much! There is some great architecture in this city.
Finally put up some new black and white shots on Flickr http://flickr.com/photos/mattanium/
@Armano Great post yesterday on digital and branding. Passed it along to many people I know.
