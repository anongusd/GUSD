So, thank you, Senator. It was a good day.
During the short ride the Senator asked questions and chatted with the kid about favorite things to do at the Capitol. It was a fun moment. Removed from politics and the usual Q and A I usually find myself engaged in with lawmakers.
My son couldn’t control his excitement and rushed on board as the doors opened, cutting off a Senator in the process. I sheepishly apologized. The Senator couldn’t have cared less, sharing my son’s excitement at a rather routine event for those of us who work on the Hill.
As expected, the radio booth I work out of can’t compete with the Senate ice cream shop and automatic train. So we headed down for a ride.
My son had the afternoon off school. Despite me taking the day off, he asked to see the Capitol and my broadcast booth. “Great! Let’s do it,” I said.
A short thread to remind us, all politics aside, lawmakers are good-hearted people who can make a kindergartner tagging along with his dad to the Capitol feel special.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) believes a national emergency declaration will be challenged "and is of dubious Constitutionality." She says it undermines the role of Congress in the appropriations process "and it's just not a good policy in my opinion."
Senate approves government funding/border security package 83-16. It now heads to the House, where passage is expected late this evening.
Pelosi also laid out concerns many Republicans have expressed about a national emergency precedent. "The epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency....A Democratic President can do that."
Procedural vote on gov funding/border security bill clears the Senate 84-15. Now voting on final passage.

"I challenge leader McConnell to say our climate change crisis is real. That it is caused by humans. And that Congress must act," Democratic Leader Schumer says, in response to what he calls McConnell's "cynical stunt" of Green New Deal vote.
When will they vote? Still unclear. Majority Leader McConnell said he hopes his colleagues advance the conference committee agreement "later today." Also, we expect the Senate to take a final confirmation vote on Barr's AG nomination.

The Senate uses an S Res to express nonbinding positions. So, not legislation that would need to be taken up by the House or signed by the President. In this case, that statement would be "Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal."

Of interest to me, at least, Schumer also spoke on the Senate floor about the deterioration of local small and medium sized newspapers. "What's more important, having our newspapers....or having a hedge fund raise it's market profits by five points?"
Schumer, on Senate floor, urges President Trump to accept the deal "and not, not, not cause another shutdown."

And VP Pence votes in the affirmative, breaking 47-47 tie on motion to proceed to CR.

Sen. Murphy (D-CT), who led filibuster last week, says he's "mortified" by today's votes.
All four gun-related amendments fail to advance in the Senate. Sen. Feinstein's (D-CA) 'no fly-no buy' measure is blocked 47-53.
Senate fails to advance Sen Cornyn (R-TX) 'no fly-no buy' proposal 53-47. Senate now turns to Sen. Feinstein 'no fly-no buy' amendment.
On expanded background check measure, three Democrats voted no (Manchin, Tester, Heitkamp) and 1 Republican voted yes (Kirk)
Next up, cloture vote on Sen. Cornyn's amendment delaying gun purchases by terror suspects. Like the others, will need 60 votes to advance
Sen. Murphy's (D-CT) amendment, expanding background checks to all gun sales, fails 44-56.
Senate now voting on Sen. Murphy's (D-CT) expanded background check amendment. It, too, needs 60 votes.
Senate blocks Sen. Grassley (R-IA) background check amendment 53-47. Needed 60. Next up Dems' expanded background check plan.
Voting still on-going, but Sen. Grassley's (R-IA) background check amendment has more than 40 no votes.
@BitterBeard1 Because these are cloture votes on amendments, and not votes for final approval, threshold is 60.
@Motherto2angels Not a simple majority because this isn't final passage. It is cloture votes. Senate procedure.

RT @jamiedupree: The "actual" delegates in NY will be elected later at district meetings and by the NY GOP state committee in May
Even if there is an early race call, there's still drama. Margin of victory matters in both Democrats and GOP race. Enjoy!
Bottom line: New York is a winner-take-most for GOP. But there is definitely delegate pick-up opportunities for all three Republicans
If a candidate tops 50% in a CD, they get all 3. Otherwise, it's a 2-1 split for 1st and 2nd, unless 2nd place doesn't get 20% of the vote.
The next 81 delegates are allocated by each of the 27 congressional districts. Each CD has 3 delegates.
The first 14 delegates are "at-large" awarded to the statewide winner. If Trump clears 50%, he gets all 14, otherwise proportional.
We'll go over it on air, but New York GOP primary delegate allocation is a little tricky. In total, 95 delegates.

Great follow up by Jake Tapper on Common Core. I think it's one of the most misunderstood election issues.

Donald Trump just said if he doesn't get an apology from Sen. Cruz, he'll file a lawsuit "pretty quick."

Trump goes full-tilt against Pres. George W. Bush. Debate audience doesn't like it, but it gets cheers at Trump rallies.
Remember, W. stumps for Jeb Monday in SC.
When in doubt, insult the audience. #GOPDebate
John Dickerson is correct. Justice Kennedy was nominated in 87, but confirmed in 88 (an election year).
President Obama will address the death of Justice Scalia at 5:30pm PT/8:30pm ET from Rancho Mirage, CA. #fnr
More Reid: Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of our constitutional responsibility.
Senate Minority Leader Reid: President can and should send Senate a nominee right away. #fnr
Senate Majority Leader McConnell: "This vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President." #fnr
Another colorful dissent from Justice Scalia. Politics aside, his prose in judicial writings will be missed.  https://t.co/tl7sKR4JLa
And in Obergefell: "The world does not expect logic and precision in poetry or inspirational pop-philosophy; it demands them in the law."
Recently, Scalia offered some of the most heated SCOTUS dissents. In King v Burwell: "We should start calling this law SCOTUScare."
Chief Justice Roberts: "I am saddened to report our colleague Justice Antonin Scalia has passed away." #fnr
Absolutely stunned at news of Justice Scalia's death.
Former VA governor Jim Gilmore has suspended his presidential campaign. GOP field is now six candidates. #fnr
@debitking Interesting thought. I know members of Congress have been sued. Not sure about the institution as a whole.
Quite the Valentine's weekend: GOP debate Saturday and Bernie Sanders on @FoxNewsSunday.
Another fun one on one debate in the middle of a race far closer than most expected by Feb. 2016. And nice job PBS team.
Sanders accuses Clinton of "a low blow" during back and forth over criticism of President Obama.
Henry Kissinger will not have a role in the Sanders administration
"It was a hard choice."-Clinton
Sharp analysis from @LisaDNews and @tamarakeithNPR that can only be honed on the radio. #radioontv

No one will take the "you are no Ted Kennedy" bait?
Hillary Clinton claims Bernie Sanders would grow government by 40%. He doesn't offer another estimate.

Senate has approved customs bill that includes permanent ban on internet access taxes. Vote was 75-20. Now heads to POTUS. #fnr
Happy Birthday to @LaceyHalpern, who, by virtue of being my wife, qualifies in the top 1% of patience.
Senate approves North Korea sanctions package 96-0. #fnr
Senate is now voting on North Korea sanctions. Sens. Cruz and Rubio both expected to vote after earlier campaign stops in SC.

Couldn't have asked anymore of @JessicaAtFoxRad, @tony4ny, @julieroginsky and @david_avella tonight. Let's do it again soon!
Fox News projects Sen. Bernie Sanders will decisively win the Democratic New Hampshire primary and Donald Trump wins the GOP contest.
I got a haircut ahead of our NH primary coverage. Hope it plays well on the radio. cc @JessicaAtFoxRad
Polls (at least most) close in NH at 7pm. That's when we'll start our coverage on @foxnewsradio stations. Big guest list. Join us!
Yes, NH will dominate today's agenda. But it is also Budget Day at the White House. https://t.co/CRFSZjXCfg
New to me this morning: Dixville Notch has been remarkably predictive of eventual GOP nominee.

@KyleClark Dad confirms. Exit for crew in case the cockpit door jams or getting out through the cabin is not possible.
@KyleClark I could be wrong, but I believe it's an emergency exit.
Final CNN/WMUR tracking poll before NH primary	Trump 31	Rubio 17	Cruz 14	Kasich 10	Bush 7	 MOE=5.2%

RT @jaketapper: in case you were wondering -- 2014: Donald Trump speaks at dinner honoring James Foley		https://t.co/ngDS2q2KBW
Did Cruz say James instead of Bowe?
Trump agreed to a three hour debate?
Rubio is having a better second hour. I'd be interested to know viewership trends between first hour and second.
Powerful moment for Sen. Cruz.
Just a thought, Carson would get a bit more time for answer, if every answer didn't begin with complaint about lack of time.
RT @brithume: Cruz now claiming "carpet bombing" is "targeted." Actually carpet bombing refers to what bombers did before technology permit…
Christie land another jab. Audience again boos Rubio answer.
Kind of like our radio coverage https://t.co/ofA6pqVGQf
RT @LisaDNews: NEW PRO-TIP: attack the audience.
So far, biggest boos for Trump and Rubio. Mostly Trump.
Fair to say if this presidential bid doesn't work out, Chris Christie won't be running for Senate.
Will CNN get a rebuttal?
Kasich nearly got Fiorina'd
I'm so confused. Why didn't Trump and Carson walk out?
Go get em tonight, fellow @ICParkSchool @ICJournalism alum @DavidMuir #GOPDebate
Two candidates, an open format and wonky policy. Fun debate.
Speaker Ryan on proposed $10/barrel oil tax: "As this lame-duck president knows, it's dead on arrival in Congress"
Jim Gilmore says he won't use Fiorina's "tactics to intimidate," but tells ABC all of the candidates should be included in NH debate
Shkreli declines to answer question about rare Wu-Tang Clan album purchase.
On the advice of counsel, Martin Shkreli declines to answer questions at House Oversight Committee hearing.
The winnowing continues. Santorum out. Endorses Rubio.
Fox News confirms: Sen Rand Paul is suspending his presidential campaign. #fnr
Several reports Sen. Rand Paul will end his Presidential bid today. Stay tuned.

Iowa Democratic party makes it official: Hillary Clinton is the caucus winner with 700.59 state delegate equivalents. Sanders had 696.82.

Iowa caucus is in the books. On to New Hampshire. We'll do it again next week.
The Senator from Texas does not yield.
@brettborz Fox Radio coverage transitioned to Clinton
A couple campaigns ended tonight. O'Malley and Huckabee suspend after lackluster Iowa finishes.
Make no mistake. A BIG win for Marco Rubio in Iowa tonight.
Caucus ready from our broadcast spot in downtown Des Moines #fnr https://t.co/xEnyQUIe6W
A lot of reports of long lines at caucus sites around the state. Big turnout expected and the snow probably holds off until overnight.
