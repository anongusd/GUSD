To my GOP friends who summarily reject everything Michael Cohen says because he previously lied, I ask:  if a convicted liar wanted to come clean about a murder and offered to lead police to the body, would you shout "liar" and ignore him?  I'm guessing not.
I agree with conservative @MaxBoot:  Trump must resign or be impeached. This trainwreck Presidency must be brought to an end before our country sustains even more damage.  #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/jfjcLn8ogm

@mdfarnie @FrankLuntz Look deeper.  No debate that Medicare is far more efficient than private insurance, &amp; patients &amp; providers increasingly like it better.

Kavanaugh's angry defiance starting to look unhinged - not the choirboy temperament he previously tried to project. If he's this aggressive while sober, imagine stumbling drunk at 17. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford &amp; the other accusers.  This man does not belong on the Supreme Court.

Trump just read a statement that tries to limit damage from his Helsinki meltdown.  Claiming he meant to say "wouldn't" instead of "would" is pathetic.  We're not that stupid.  We saw the whole press conference.  He clearly chose Putin over our intel community.
Experts on the right &amp; left are calling Trump's Helsinki meltdown a terrible day for America. I think it's good day because Trump was fully exposed. Everyone saw in undeniable form what I've been shouting for many months: he's dangerously compromised &amp; must be removed from office
The line is drawn: you're either with USA or with Russia/Putin/Trump. Responsible members of Congress &amp; Trump's cabinet should start demanding resignation now. Allowing this to play out for months will only add to serous damage wrought on our country &amp; our standing in the world.
