Glad to see House Republicans banning all earmarks for a year. Earmarks have been the engine that drives excessive spending.
I applaud the House GOP for adopting ban on earmarks. Do you think the Senate should follow suit? I do. VIDEO- http://bit.ly/cXF53g

Tried to hold Senate accountable tonight by requiring spending be paid for, as new law requires. Missed by 1 vote!  Will keep up fight!
Good arguments today at S Ct. Believe justices will hold that second amndt applies to states and right to bear arms cannot be violated.
Headed to the Supreme Court to hear Chicago case on 2nd Amdt. Right to bear arms is individual right; court should stike down the law.
Thought we were going to accomplish something at the health care summit, not just make speeches.
Thanks for the great response on the healthcare question. Please keep the input coming.
Should we modify the current health care proposal or start over with a step by step approach?
http://znl.me/PNPD4U The fishing industry needs our attention. We need sound science and I will continue to fight for our state.
Very productive meeting with Pres. Uribe and Min. of Defense Silva. Colombia is our closest ally in region and needs our full support.
Met with Col Pres. Alvaro Uribe to discuss trade, strengthening democracies, & U.S. counternarcotics cooperation. http://twitpic.com/13zqha
Great visit to the Panama Canal. Expansion will bring great trade opportunities to Florida. We must have our ports ready by 2015.
Hard to fathom challenge for Haiti. Haitian govt needs long range plan not just to rebuild, but to build better and outside of capital.
Happy to see many volunteer drs and nurses from USA, and especially Florida. Saw my friend Dr. Frank Sanchez from the U. Miami.
Devastation in Port au Prince is unbelievable. Looks like war zone. Just saw Cathedral in shambles. The cross, amazingly, still stands.
Just landed Port au Prince with a congressional delegation. Today is one month from day the quake hit, and is a nat. day of mourning.
Another troubling step toward a nuclear armed Iran with today's announcement. Appeasement did not work in the 30s, will not work now.
Our motto is to get 6 yrs out of 16 months. We did not think it would carry over to the weather!  30 inches of snow and still counting!
Having a great sushi dinner here at the Orlando airport. Stop in on my friend Shinji at the Hyatt if you are passing through.

Obama will likely oversee more deficit spending in first 2 yrs than Bush in 8 yrs. ($2.13 trillion under Bush, 2.75 projected for Obama).
Proposing new law to cut taxes for workers and buinesses. Will give workers 3 percent pay hike and money for businesses to hire workers.
Failure of Senate to pass spending reform is like a cancer patient who will not seek treatment. Americans are outraged and should be.
Preposterous to think 50 minute interrogation of Abdulmuttallab was sufficient.  Terrorists should not be tried as common criminals.
The people of Mass. have spoken for America tonight--enough is enough!  Too much spending, too much government. The people get it!

Headed into the Capitol with about eight inches of snow on the ground. Always good to have a friend with 4W Drive!  DC looks beautiful!
Headed to the Capitol for a 1 AM vote.  The American people do not want us to rush health care through. They want us to get it right.
Today, I introduced S.J.Res.22 ‚Äì a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.  We cannot afford to stay on current course.
Signing of commuter rail bill by Governor Crist today gives Florida a real chance to secure high speed rail and transform Florida.
