Biden: "The president did the right thing by walking away. A bad deal is worse than no deal. But I hope we get down now to hard, hard facts."
Biden: "The president’s advisors told him that this is really really really going to be hard. The president treats everything like it’s a real estate deal."
In Q&amp;A Biden is asked explicitly about breakdown of KJU-Trump talks. "I hope I don’t come across as condescending. … I hope the president has learned a really important lesson: Diplomacy matters. Preparation matters."
Biden: "We have to focus on basic fundamental American values. That’s why, that’s why the rest of the world had repaired to us. ... [Now] the world is watching us walk away from it. And they're confused as hell."
Biden closes: If a skinny guy with a father from Kenya, and an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton who stuttered badly all through college, can end up as president and vice president of the United States you can do anything.
Same thing happened with Senate Intel https://t.co/5IsIOaBDUG
As Pres. Trump returns from summit with KJU, Biden mocks the "love letters" between them, Trump's embrace of Putin and "thug" in Philippines.		"Our national reputation is being tarnished. We’re at an inflection point for American leadership and for the institutions we’ve built"
Biden: Every president since the end of the war has talked about a Europe whole, free and democratic, and prosperous. It is now being challenged. … Only the US has the clout to hold it together. All has been thrown into jeopardy by this administration’s America First policy.
For second time in as many weeks Biden talks about the differing receptions at the Munich Conference for him and @VP Pence. When Pence addressed leaders, there was a "deafening silence."
He returns to prepared remarks, about how the "failure of presidential leadership is creating incredible doubt about America’s staying power." For first time in generations "American leadership and engagement is in doubt."
Biden is talking about the genius of the Marshall Plan when a phone rings in the audience. "That’s President Trump calling me," he jokes. "Tell him I’m busy, but I’m happy to help."
Biden talks about a trip to Afghanistan with Hagel. Ends with a lesson: "The idea of ever having a united Afghanistan under one rule was never going to occur in the cards in history."
Biden jokes about seeing Omaha and thinking it was "Obama." 		Obama of course won this single electoral vote in '08. I came here with him for a post-SOTU tour where audience had signs of "Obamaha"
Hagel: "Joe’s a Democrat, I’m a Republican. But that never mattered to Joe. He always understood that what matters most in public life … is character. That public service is a privilege to be earned."
Hagel, introing Biden, recalls his first Foreign Relations Cmte meeting. Biden came to GOP side, "put his arm around me and another newly elected committee member and welcomed us to the committee. An uncommon gesture in politics."

FACT CHECK: Ranking Member Jordan attacks Cummings for having Cohen as the first witness before the committee in this Congress.		The Committee has had two previous hearings, on prescription drugs and executive branch ethics with multiple witnesses

Cummings: "I have made it abundantly clear to Mr. Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ."
Cohen's testimony is "deeply disturbing," Cummings says, and should be troubling "to all Americans."

As that story also noted, Biden was also increasingly clear eyed about political challenge of primary. Seems now that's where he's trying to get comfortable.
Putting a lid on this - it appears the family meeting Biden referenced has happened since last week when we reported he planned to meet with grandkids as he ran the "final traps." https://t.co/RRofT1IL5t
Someone in audience shouts: "Oh God just say yes!" Audience erupts
Biden says he wants to make sure if he runs there's "a clear shot that I can be the nominee. I think we can. I think that’s where we are. But theres still a couple hurdles to go through to make sure we have all this in place."
Biden: "I’m certain about where the family is. But the second piece is I don’t want this to be a fool’s errand. I want to be sure that if we do this, and we’re very close to getting to a decision, that I am fully prepared to do it."
Biden said first hurdle for him on 2020 was effect on family, especially in a race against President Trump. "I don’t think he’s likely to stop at anything no matter who he runs against."		More on this from me last week: https://t.co/RRofT1IL5t
Meacham now asking Biden explicitly about 2020. Biden says he just had family meeting with all grandchildren. 		"There’s a consensus – they, the most important people in my life -- want me to run."
Biden on a long riff about Obama's character. Says they didn't disagree much, and when they did it was usually "on a tactic, not on substance."
Biden: In Obama administration, most crises they faced were "crises of first instance. It was not like we could go back in history and see how it was handled."
Biden adds the public punishes officials who turn out to be different than what they sold themselves to be
Biden: "The American public rewards public officials -- even if they disagree with them -- if they believe they’re authentic and believe they’re expressing what they believe to be the best course."
@nycsouthpaw A question for the Senate Rules Committee!
This is taking a turn. 		Meacham jokes mid-yarn: "I have a series of nudity stories about world leaders."		Biden interjects he has one too, and is talking now about a "stark-naked" William Fulbright in the Senate gym
Of course, BIden as former VP will get a bust outside the Senate chamber one of these days. All VPs have one (except Gore, who didn't like the look of the first stab at his)
Meacham talks about his "oil portrait test" for political leaders, says he'd ask Trump if he could to ask what he wants us to think about when we see his portrait.		Biden: "I don’t have an oil portrait anywhere!"
Biden for second time in as many weeks holds up GM as example of why some Americans, as he puts it, "are losing faith in the capitalist system."		"No CEO took a hit when 17,000 people lost their jobs."

But Dems are not just focused now on 2016 campaign collusion, which is Mueller's narrow focus. Cummings' clear focus ahead of Cohen testimony is on hush payments, Trump Org broadly, and other alleged criminality beyond Russia
One, it's hard to square that given how Dems already beating the drum loudly for full disclosure of Mueller findings and work. And Chairman Burr, a Republican, is also having Cohen in private
The larger argument seems to be Dems don't want the public to hear Cohen on matters related to Mueller probe. Two points here.
Also interesting in that piece that Meadows, who has attacked Dems for bringing Cohen to testify at all, also criticizes them for not having Russia-related testimony in public.

RT @TNJ_malbright: From everything I’ve heard, people don’t realize how busted the DE Democratic Party was before Biden and Carper came in.…
@akarl_smith he talked about this at length last month, too
Last month Biden said he was actually once recruited to run for office in Delaware as a Republican, because at the time "that was the progressive party" in Delaware. But he was anti-Nixon because of abuse of power
Biden bluntly says there were "a bunch of racists" in the Senate when he first joined, including Dems. "I ran against [them] during the civil rights movement."
Says he got a second dog after being told it would add years to Champ's life to be around a pup. "Major's doing well, taking care of Champ."
Biden asked about his new dog. He first jokes that his older German Shepherd, Champ, was his reward because he didn't want to run for vice president.
Biden: "I don't begrudge anybody making millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. But I do think there's some shared responsibility and it's not being shared fairly for hard-working, middle class and working class people."
Then came "godawful" Trump tax plan, shifting money overseas. GM "not investing here after we bailed their rear-ends out."
Biden notes he was leading advocate in Obama admin for auto bailout. But after they repaid taxpayers and returned to profits, "they didn't invest in new plants and equipment. … They bought back their own stock."
Biden asked his takeaways from campaigning for Democrats in 2018. "People were looking for people of character. Just simply people of character. It was higher on the agenda than any other issue."
"We've go to respond" to anxiety among middle class. "There’s a lot of people justifiably worried. We have answers but we’re not speaking to these people, this middle class that’s scared to death about what’s coming."
Biden is giving familiar answers to some basic questions about the state of America now but with a bit more edge in his voice.		"It's time to restore America’s soul. Remind ourselves of who we are," he says
Biden said Obama admin had worked to allow Central American nation citizens to seek asylum at embassies in their own countries, rather than come to the U.S. to do so. Trump reversed because he wanted to demagogue on issue
Biden compares Obama admin Northern Triangle initiative to rebuilding Europe after WWII. "It was overwhelmingly in our self interest to do that."
Biden: Those efforts were bipartisan and were working. But "this president came along and essentially let it all blow up."
Biden addresses the "hysteria" around the southern border and talks about efforts he led in Obama admin to support Northern Triangle countries
Biden says he (unlike Pence) "got a standing ovation" in Munich, "led by the American delegation" both Democrats and Republicans in Congress
Biden: "Name me one consequential problem from global warming to a nuclear arms race that can be solved by us alone. Name me one. So this is an inflection point."
And meanwhile Pence -- "I know him. I like him" -- but he was received with a "deafening silence," Biden says, as he spoke on behalf of Trump and "lectured NATO about their obligations."
Biden: Angela Merkel, "now freed from the leadership of her party," gave an incredible "refutation of American foreign policy as it relates to NATO."
Biden, reflecting on Munich, says an administration rooting for the breakdown of the European Union "is the dumbest thing in the world."

How punchy is Whitaker after that? The star-struck acting AG stops to shake hands with @mkraju. "I see you on TV all the time."
.@RepJerryNadler is wrapping today's Whitaker hearing, at just under 6 hours including breaks.		Nadler says there are issues the committee will seek follow-up from him. Calls it "not credible" that he interviewed for a job on Trump legal team and did not comment on Mueller probe
.@RepEscobar uses more than 30 seconds to ask Whitaker not to unnecessarily take up her time with long answers
Whitaker says he did not receive any WRITTEN guidance from DOJ ethics officials on recusal.
Whitaker on ethics guidance on recusal: "They told me it was a close call."		Dean: So you go the other way?		Whitaker: "To not bind my successors, yes, I believe on a close call ... I made the right decision. It was my decision to make."
We are now on the second-to-last Democratic member for questions
Dean asks about convos with Trump between when he was named acting AG and recused himself. He declines to comment but notes he has had regular interactions with the president
"It was not a substantive phone call," Whitaker says.
Dean: How did you learn you were acting AG? 		Whitaker says he got a call from POTUS, but later acknowledges Trump's tweet may have come first.
Now @RepDean up. How many positions did you interview for in Trump admin?		Whitaker identifies two - the job Ty Cobb got and the one he got as DOJ chief of staff
Stanton also asks about a "Religious Liberty Task Force" that AG Sessions announced in July 2018. Whitaker says it may not have "been effectuated yet."
Rep. @gregstantonaz asks about impact of government shutdown on DOJ.
.@lucymcbath starts her Qs by saying she has seen voter suppression firsthand in Georgia.		Whitaker: DOJ is committed to upholding the voting rights of all Americans

Only two Republicans still on hand for this hearing https://t.co/0fvxIf4KVg
Again Whitaker declines to comment on conversations with POTUS
Now @RepValDemings asking about Whitaker involvement in other personnel decisions in DOJ.
Whitaker: "I appreciate your passionate about this issue." Points to DHS, HHS for their role in this process
Jayapal really drilling Whitaker about the impact of family separation policy, and consequence of officials not tracking when a parent or legal guardian was separated from child. "Do you know what kind of damage has been done?"
"There was no family separation policy," Whitaker says. Jayapal says that claim has already been given four Pinocchios.
.@RepJayapal now the first Dem to really focus elsewhere, asking Whitaker about family separation policy
At this point there appear to be no other Republicans present who have yet to ask questions. But still about a dozen Democrats
We're back, and @tedlieu asking Whitaker about whether president can be indicted. Whitaker begins referring to OLC memos before Lieu cuts him off, and motions to submit the U.S. Constitution for the record
Two minute break now
Swalwell: Can you say that to the president?	Whitaker: I am not here to be a puppet to repeat the terms and words you say
Swalwell: Is Mueller honest?	Whitaker: I have no reason to believe he's not honest.	Swalwell: Is he conflicted?	Whitaker: I don't have any reason to believe that
Whitaker says he hasn't been involved in any conversations about pardons for figures Swalwell named
Swalwell asks if Trump asked Whitaker about recusing from Mueller probe before appointing him. Whitaker says he already answered.
.@ericswalwell now asking about other jobs Whitaker may have spoken to WH officials about, including as part of POTUS' legal team
Real fighting words: Collins raises again point of order about @ericswalwell question being beyond scope of hearing.		Swalwell tells Collins if he wants to be Whitaker's lawyer he can join him on floor.		Collins charges back about Swalwell using this hearing to run for president
Rep. @reschenthaler asks Whitaker what DOJ is doing to stop sanctuary cities.		Whitaker notes attempt to withhold funding through some DOJ grant programs
Cicilline: Did Trump lash out at you after Cohen guilty plea. 		Whitaker, eventually: "No he did not."
.@RepCicilline enters into record various articles in which Whitaker criticized Mueller probe prior to working at DOJ. Begins questions with warnings about long answers
.@RepBenCline raises immigration. Whitaker notes that the number of immigration judges "has been overwhelmed by the number of asylum seekers." Now putting more judges in areas of need
The payoff from Jeffries: Do you still agree that Mueller probe is a "lynch mob"?		Whitaker: I was retweeting "an interesting read."
Jeffries now ticking through a by-the-numbers of the Mueller probe - indictments, guilty pleas, etc. Whitaker largely agreeing with his accounting while noting he doesn't have facts in front of him
. @RepJeffries starts off: We're all trying to figure out who you are, where you come from, how you became AG

Whitaker also says in response to Richmond that he would not have a problem with transgender person working at DOJ
Richmond: Were there good people on both sides in Charlottesville? 	Whitaker: "There is no place in a civil society for hate, for white supremacy, or for white nationalism."
. @RepRichmond, former CBC chair, asks Whitaker if there are African Americans in senior leadership of DOJ. Whitaker says no, pending nomination of head of U.S. Marshals
McClintock: Why was Roger Stone treated differently than Bob Menendez? Whitaker says he can't address that in open hearing.
Today multiple GOP members have said that CNN was, as McClintock just put it, "obviously tipped off" about Roger Stone indictment. CNN has long ago explained why it was there and that there was no heads up
.@RepMcClintock, citing among other things Gregg Jarrett's book, asks Whitaker why DOJ isn't probing the dossier, Uranium One etc. 		Whitaker notes there is a DOJ IG probe of issues about DOJ misconduct
And we're back after that 15-minute 5-minute break
We're taking a 5-minute break. Whitaker jokes: "Five minutes for lunch?"
Whitaker said it was a nonpartisan group that filed complaints against members of both parties. Asked which ones, Whitaker refers to the group's website
Dems vote to table GOP motion. Bass continues with Q about Whitaker serving as executive director of conservative group that called for investigations of Democrats
Ranking Member Collins raises point of order that questions @RepKarenBass was beginning to ask were outside the scope of a DOJ oversight hearing. 		Committee now voting to table Collins' objection
Whitaker gives his explanation: for 13 months I was chief of staff for AG Sessions. I was aware of everything going on at DOJ that he wasn't recused from. I think POTUS comfortable "that to continue the momentum" at DOJ that "I was best positioned" to be AG
Deutch explains that while it's not a confirmation hearing, there's a need to understand why Trump chose Whitaker as acting AG instead of other officials in line
Whitaker, to @RepTedDeutch, says he has not communicated info about Mueller probe to WH/Trump-aligned people through intermediaries

Whitaker says he has not denied any funding for the Mueller probe.
. @RepCohen: Is Mueller probe a witch hunt? 	Whitaker: It would be inappropriate for me to comment on an ongoing investigation
Q from @RepCohen about OLC memos involving emoluments, Trump hotels. Whitaker says only that these are subjects of ongoing litigation, and that DOJ would be involved in it
This gets at the very heart of an ongoing investigation. Whitaker will not answer whether scope memo identifies specific Americans for potential investigation. 		He does agree with Jordan, though, saying we investigate crimes not people
.@Jim_Jordan asking about the scope memo outlining parameters of Mueller probe. Whitaker says he has viewed full, unredacted memo. Jordan pressing about whether specific names involved
In response to Q from Jackson Lee, Whitaker says foreign interference in our elections is "very serious and ongoing concern," and "I also feel that voter fraud is a serious concern."
Again, members have flights to catch today and every minute used up for sparring is likely a question not asked.
We're getting bogged down in procedure as @JacksonLeeTX18 wants yes-or-no answers, and Whitaker is giving longer answers
There is the fact he made his views known on television before he was chosen, of course https://t.co/KYI0kDaG3h
. @RepSteveChabot asks Whitaker about the opioid epidemic
"No I did not," Whitaker adds in direct response to Lofgren's question.
Lofgren: Did you share opinions of Mueller probe with Trump, others prior to joining DOJ, as private citizen. Whitaker says he made nor was asked to provide commitments or promises about Mueller before taking job.
What was basis for statement that Mueller probe nearing its end, @RepZoeLofgren asks. Whitaker initially declines to comment
After a long break for votes in the full House, the Judiciary Committee is resuming its hearing with acting AG Whitaker. Only 2 of 41 members have asked questions, but it is a getaway Friday
Less than an hour into this and barely after opening statements, Whitaker uses a moment to question why he hasn't been asked yet about the hard work of the department. "This is not a confirmation hearing."
Collins, top Republican, opens his questions by asking about CNN being on site when Roger Stone was indicted
Whitaker ultimately answers the question. "We have followed the special counsel’s regulations to a T. There has been no event, no decision that has required me to take any action."
Whitaker tries not to answer question from @RepJerryNadler by pointing out to him his 5 minutes were up. Quite something
Whitaker takes the oath. Nadler gives him 5 minutes to deliver his opening statement https://t.co/KhoGcZOkvm
Democrats defeat the motion 24-10. The hearing continues
After accusing Democrats of making this hearing nothing but political theater, Collins says they should have a popcorn machine set up and makes a motion to adjourn
Collins: this is not the Senate. Democrats trying to run a confirmation hearing for official about to leave his post.
"This hearing is pointless," Collins continues. Attacking Democrats for raising issues about Whitaker's personal financial dealings just before the hearing
Ranking Member Doug Collins comes swinging in his opening statement: "This is nothing more than a character assassination."
Nadler: "It is my intent that there be no surprises today, Mr. Whitaker. ... We have nothing to hide from you.  We hope you have nothing to hide from us."
Chairman @RepJerryNadler: "When our members ask you if you conveyed sensitive information to the President, or ignored ethics advice at the direction of the President, or worked with the White House to orchestrate the firing of your predecessor, the answer should be 'no.'"

There's concern ahead of tomorrow's hearing that Whitaker will still cite either exec privilege or ongoing investigation as reason not to answer Qs.

@TruthDG19 @itsmommy @World_Of_Hurt @Tom_Winter @thehill @politico GOP voted to defeat a Dem motion specifically to send unredacted transcripts to Mueller for his use.

@TruthDG19 @itsmommy @World_Of_Hurt @Tom_Winter @thehill @politico Also - Mueller is seeing some transcripts for the first time now. There were 6 GOP didn't include in September release, and 2 more interviews that Dems conducted alone
@TruthDG19 @itsmommy @World_Of_Hurt @Tom_Winter @thehill @politico This is what happened:		Sept vote to release most (but not all) transcripts TO THE PUBLIC.

Biden: "When you don't treat people with dignity they become alienated." And people who become alienated put strains on our institutions.
Biden, pacing the stage talking about importance of recognizing dignity in working class. "My point is we don't talk about those things because Democrats are scared to death about offending you, and Republicans don’t think it’s necessary."
Biden: when in fact you don’t respond – the political leadership of both parties doesn’t respond or there’s no unity in responds – you become susceptible to demagoguery.
Final Q to Biden is what's his advice about how to make a difference? He's 15 minutes into an answer centered around working class anxiety. "Will there be a middle class and what will we do about it? People are scared. They’re scared to death."
Biden talking about same-sex marriage, and refers to what he said on "Tim Russert's show." (David Gregory was hosting @MeetThePress when he made that particular bit of news)
Biden, still answering the Thurmond question. "I come from a faith where redemption is possible. It doesn’t make any of these men what they weren’t when they were alive."
Biden: "I really think it’s important to try to get to know the people you so vehemently disagree with, as it is those you agree with."
The next question to Biden from the audience: Why did Strom Thurmond ask you to deliver his eulogy. The ex-VP says: "I watched him change, not because of me, but because of exposure."
Biden then spoke broadly about state of the country. "We're in a battle for America's soul." Condemns Trump response to Charlottesville.		"It's time for America to get up and move again."
More Biden on 2020: "I’m running the traps on this. I don’t want to make this a fool’s errand."
NEW: Biden on 2020: "I’m a lot closer than I was before Christmas. We’ll make the decision soon.”
Biden on Obama: "Whatever your politics are, he had an enormous amount of integrity." When they both were asked what most proud of, "Not one whiff of scandal."
Biden recalls the family discussion when Obama asked him if he'd agree to be vetted for VP. Jill Biden told him: "It'd be better for the family if you did it."
Next Q to Biden is about relationship with Obama. In his career, did he ever think among his accomplishments would be "creating the standard for bromance?"
Biden says advances in this research part of why Jimmy Carter is still alive. Predicts soon you will be able to inoculate against some forms of cancer. "There's a lot of hope."
Biden now deep in the weeds on the work he and his foundation has done on cancer research. "There are major, major opportunities now."
RT @RebeccaBuck: Political taunts in the year 2019: “Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter” !!! https://t.co/zrfn2mvc55
But he again praises Upton for being among a small number of Rs who stood up to support big infusion of $ for cancer research. "It’s about being able to arrive at a consensus."
Biden addresses NYT/Upton story again. "it made it sound like Biden’s out there and he’s not a good Democrat. I’ve campaigned for more Democrats than anybody in the country has. I went in to over 50 races on the ground" in 2018
How does this change, BIden is asked. He points to shutdown. "The public finally said enough his enough his enough." Republicans decided "it’s more of a threat for me not to challenge [Trump] than it is to challenge him."
Biden: "We’re virtually not getting the nation’s business done. Not just on the wall, quote unquote. All across the board." 		Notes he was close friends with many Rs. "It's difficult to get anything at all done. And we can’t function this way, folks."
@JoeBiden Biden opens with familiar story - how Mike Mansfield instructed him how you could question a man's judgment but not his motive. 		"Today you notice all attacks are based on motive."

Biden spox amplifies his boss’ pushback on the pushback to Biden/Upton event https://t.co/5IDnHPXU4I
Event wraps after about 75 minutes. Not one direct question to Biden about his political future.
Biden: "I want ... Beau’s son and daughter to know I was true to their dad’s wishes."
In an aside, Biden refers to President Obama as simply "Barack." "I call him Barack instead of the president because I don’t want to confuse him with …"
Biden: "There’s a lot at stake right now on the court with RBG. If she stays healthy and a Democrat is elected president it will be a very different court than if President Trump is reelected."
Biden talking about his role in SCOTUS nominees for decades. Had studied separation of power and emphasized equality of the three branches. "If I got elected president I might not believe that anymore."
But Biden also says "I make no bones about it. I’m a partisan guy in terms of my ideological points of view." But inability of people to work together today in politics "frustrates me"
Biden: "One of the things I’ve always been relatively good at since I was a kid is bringing people together, negotiating, trying to make things work."
Biden hits similar note to this morning as he describes start of his Senate tenure. "I get criticized for reaching across the aisle. But I don’t know how we get things done if we don’t move together."
Biden: "What informed my public policy was the abhorrence of the abuse of power." Says in Delaware at start of his career, GOP was the progressive party. "The Democratic Party was the southern Democratic Party."
Biden talking about what gave him purpose. Among lessons growing up was about abuse of power, including men over women. "I almost got arrested because I intervened when a man was pushing his wife around in a supermarket."
Biden: "I get up every day hoping that Beau’s proud of me. Because he made me promise that I wouldn’t quit. I wouldn’t step aside. I’d continue to work on the things that have animated my whole life."
@JoeBiden Biden: "Family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Everything revolves around family."

Tough hits coming in against Biden for that Upton event. But in midterms VP did events in 22 states for 65 Democratic candidates, including multiple Michigan stops.
Biden's closing riff: "I think we need to start believing our people again … They’re looking to be lead."
Biden talks about one of first meetings with military leadership he attended with Obama. "You know what the military said was our greatest threat? Global warming!"
Biden leans into the green energy component of Recovery Act, which Obama admin feels it didn't get enough credit for. "The threat we face in climate change is existential."
RT @MariannaNBCNews: Partial government shutdown day 34 https://t.co/RmdUfZdNQT

"The more dysfunctional this town has become, the more consequential local officials become," Biden says. "Not a joke. It’s a reality. ... All the innovation in America is coming from the governors, the mayors, the county executives."
Biden, after railing against "dysfunctional" Washington. "I read in the New York Times that one of the problems I'd have if I ran for president is I like Republicans. Bless me father for I have sinned."
No surprise: Biden using remarks to Mayors Conference to tout the Recovery Act, which he led implementation of. "It literally saved us from sliding into a recession."

Biden tries to end on optimistic note. Recalls standing on train platform in Wilmington, a city scarred by riots in '68, to wait for arrival of Obama to travel together to DC for inauguration.		"Don’t tell me things can’t change!"
Bloomberg appears to have left the event after speaking. Not at table for Biden remarks https://t.co/7tb1fZK9Rx
Biden speaks directly to his record on criminal justice: "I haven’t always been right … but I’ve always tried" to do right.		Talks about working with Obama to end disparity of sentencing on crack-cocaine, other efforts
"One thing we know for certain -- we learned it over and over again through history, whether the holocaust or the civil rights movement -- silence is complicity. We have to speak out."
With MLK III present, Biden says: "We’ve learned in the last two years it doesn’t take much to awaken hate. ... 50 years later the hate that cut your dad down is still nurtured by those forces of darkness."
No acknowledgment from Biden of Bloomberg as the other did to him. Begins formal remarks by talking about visit to Memphis recently to receive honor from museum on civil rights and visiting Lorraine Motel
.@JoeBiden opens with a plug for Amtrak after teasing he had an "announcement to make."
Sharpton now lavishing praise as he introduces Biden, calling him true public servant. On Obama's choosing him as his "partner" for eight years: "That’s why many of us saw a man that would put his shoulder to the wheel to move America forward."
Bloomberg says MLK would have been especially proud to see election of @lucymcbath. Notes he paid for radio, TV and direct mail that helped elect her.
And talks now about his efforts on gun violence. Says that had Dr. King lived he has "no doubt" that he would have made gun violence an important part of his life.
Bloomberg focuses on his education record as mayor, doubling budget during tenure. But if Dr. King saw "the little progress we’ve made in giving all minority children a sufficient education to succeed over the past four years he would be shocked."
Bloomberg then sort of teases that he hasn't had a chance to talk with Biden today, but that he looked forward to getting "some pointers on what it’s like to live in Washington, DC."
. @MikeBloomberg acknowledges @JoeBiden, a "great American."		"Whatever the next year brings for Joe and me, I know we’ll keep our eye on the real prize, and that is electing a Democrat in 2020 and getting the country back on track."
Sharpton introing Bloomberg now. Sharpton says the night Bloomberg was elected mayor he got a call from him, promising to always be accessible even if they wouldn't always agree.		Notes he hadn't talked to the then-sitting mayor (Giuliani) in 8 years.
Sharpton: "The White House has not only shut down those [federal] workers, they shut down the King holiday."
Sharpton, speaking now, notes that the White House has no official event today marking MLK Day. "This is an insult to the American people," he says.
Seated together at head table: MLK III, Biden, Al Sharpton, and Mike Bloomberg

RT @DJJudd: .@mikememoli asked Elizabeth Warren about the shutdown while here in Ankeny, IA. Here's what she had to say: https://t.co/YaCX6…
Warren: "This is an extraordinary moment in American history. It is a moment when America faces great danger. But it is also a moment when democracy itself is rebuilding, is strengthening and it is being the kind of representative government we need in the 21st century."
Warren talks about the significance of the 2017 Women's March and how it defied pundit expectations to sustain into 2018.		"The march was not the apex. The march was the beginning," she says
Warren notes she never ran for office before '12 Senate race. "The most astonishing part of it was that after I said I’m going to do this, how many people -- how many women just came off the benches ... to say, 'Girl, you take that part and we’ll do everything else.'"
Warren ask if folks remember pre-approved credit cards. "I am, I think, America’s first pre-rejected nominee."  Before Pres. Obama could nominate me to lead CFPB, "Republicans sent a letter over saying we will never confirm that woman."
Asked by moderator about the decision to seek public office, Warren says she's "probably the most unlikely senator you will find."
Warren apologizes for her raspy voice. "I spent the holidays with grandchildren, otherwise known as little petri dishes."
Warren takes stage with women candidates from Iowa. “The rest of America is counting on Iowa to get this right.” https://t.co/KYmoHO0y6A
Crowd filling in for @ewarren’s final public event on this first Iowa swing. She’ll be appearing with five women just elected to the state legislature https://t.co/8TTsLQ5tDP

RT @ktumulty: When George Will decided to write a book about baseball, did anyone question his qualifications to do it? One of the best-sel…

RT @rubycramer: In between questions for Elizabeth Warrren in Des Moines, someone in the crowd shouts: “Do you like to dance!” (cc @AOC) Se…
Warren explains the lottery system to ask Qs (everyone given a ticket at the door, then moderator reads off numbers): The idea is everyone gets a chance to ask a question, not just those who run to the front fastest
She goes on to again largely pivot away from Trump, a trend of the weekend. "We gotta stay focused on what matters to us."
Warren asked how she debates someone who doesn't deal in facts. She deadpans, "Did you have someone specific in mind?"
Warren, answering a question about separation of church and state, gets opportunity to drop in another bit of bio: "I was a 5th grade Sunday school teacher. … All I can say is no one was injured."
Warren closes with call for a grassroots campaign in the Democratic primary. "We together can dream big and fight hard, and that’s how we will make change."
... "And I am determined that we will be a country that invests in opportunity for every one of our children."
Warren's bottom line: "My daddy ended up as a janitor and I got a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor and a United States senator because America invested in opportunity to me. ...
Warren: "We can talk about a lot of these pieces but I want to put on the table an idea. And that is we need change --- and not just one statute here or one law there. … We need big structural change."
Warren "Today in America African American home ownership rates are the same as they were when housing discrimination was legal. … Young people in America are getting crushed by a trillion and a half dollars in student loan debt. We have got to turn this around."
Warren team says 725 inside, 500 outside for event in Des Moines. She's addressed close to 3,000 Iowans in 2 days so far.
@ewarren Warren, now speaking indoors: "The bad news is, I've caught a cold. The good news is, nevertheless I persist."

The punch line: GOP co-sponsors of Warren's hearing aid bill included Iowa's own @ChuckGrassley
Next Q: what have you done in the Senate that would make you a great president? 		Warren is talking about legislation to bring down cost of hearing aids
Second Q for Warren is how do Dems put out an agenda that can appeal to everyone. 		Warren says government is about identifying the things we value and then figuring out how to pay for it. Pivots quickly to GOP tax law
Warren: "Because ultimately what 2020 is going to be about is not my family but the tens of millions of families across this country who just want a level playing field."
Warren: "Now I can’t stop Donald Trump from what he’s going to do. I can’t stop him from hurling racial insults. I don’t have the power to do that. But what I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families."
Warren: "I’m not a person of color. I’m not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship and I respect that difference."
First audience question for Warren: Why did you do the DNA test?		Warren: "I’m glad you asked that question. I genuinely am."
For second day in a row, Warren has given a 15-or-so-minute stump speech that never mentions President Trump.
@ewarren Warren pitch: "Washington keeps working great for people with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call it out for what it is: it is corruption pure and simple and it needs to stop."
. @ewarren in Iowa Day 2: Sioux City’s Orpheum Theater https://t.co/kUiOG3IgS7
Warren talks about visiting detention facility at the border. "I saw cages full of women. It was unbelievable. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse that was dirty."		Says U.S. needs immigration policy the distinguishes between criminals “and 9-year old girls."
Warren asked about refugee/immigration issues. "We cannot give up the dream of immigration reform, for our Dreamers, for our refugees."
Warren talks about political corruption that comes even in countries with autocrats technically elected.		"So this economic message that I talk about is one that we not only need to live here in the United States. We need to walk the walk in the world about this."
Warren asked generally her foreign policy view and how she'd deal with challenges she'd inherit. 		"I want to talk about it in a little different way than most folks talk about it," she begins. "I think one of the biggest threats we face is the rise of autocracies."
A woman who has known Warren since law school got called on, asked about abortion.		"For me this is a question about the role of law. I know that these are very hard personal family decisions. I think the role of government here is to back out."
A new one for me on the presidential campaign trail: Attendees were given tickets when they arrived and now numbers being announced so those lucky ticket holders can ask question
Warren: "I am grateful to America down to my toes. I am grateful but I am also determined. I am determined that we build an America were not just the children of rich children get a chance to build something."
And the sound system is back
One might say she is persisting.
And the sound system went out at Warren event. She asks crowd to be quiet and keeps speaking. 		Someone in audience jokes: "Russian hackers."
Warren on stage, ahead of schedule. “These are dangerous times for our country. And Iowa is going to have a big part in determining where we go next.” https://t.co/D6lFgXuQtV
And sure enough Warren briefly addressed the crowd outside apologizing that there wasn’t room

Comey: Trump's insecurity is a "root cause" of his failings. Presidents have always had external reference points to base decisions. Trump's is simply about need for affirmation.  "Those are words I never thought would come out of my mouth about a president."
Comey: Obama was the best listener, Trump the worst.		Trump, unlike other presidents, stays behind Resolute Desk in group discussions. And is always talking. 		"Silence is threatening to an insecure person. Obama had the confidence to be quiet."
Comey on investigation he ordered of leaks from NY field office: "Knowing the Bureau, I’m highly confident that it’s either ongoing or it reached conclusion. Because that’s not something our internal affairs people let go of."
Comey says he told DOJ inspector general "I think if I had chosen to conceal this [Weiner laptop] you would be writing a report that would savage me to American democracy."
Do you feel guilty about Clinton email probe?		Comey: "I don’t." Always had to consider bad options. “One sucked, one sucked worse.” We "always sought to choose the least bad option."
Comey repeats what he said in book tour. "I hope Donald Trump is not removed by impeachment. Because it would let the country off the hook." Can't have situation where a third of the country believes there was a "coup"
Comey names Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan for refusing to join bipartisan warning about Russian election interference, "to their everlasting shame." Says they’re going to have a hard time defending that to history
Q: What would you have done differnetly if you were Obama in fall '16: 		Comey: O "was in a tight spot." If he announced Russia was "coming for the election, has he helped them accomplish their goal." He also thought DT did’t have a chance to be elected president.
Comey says he would be worried about a "significant independent candidate" -- names Kasich among others. "Because that’s Trump’s reelection ticket." Also worries Dems will nominate someone with very narrow appeal, and the middle stays home
Comey: By accident of history I have a role to play to speak about the rule of law and the truth
@NicolleDWallace : Would you ever run?	@Comey : No ... You don't have to run for office to be useful.
Comey: "All of us should use every breath we have to make sure that the lies stop on January 20, 2021"
Comey very careful in answering Q about whether Russia has leverage over Trump. "If there is significant information that would expose a lie by a major public figure that the adversary knows, yes it’s a major concern."
Comey compares what he observed in Trump team to Casa Nostra. "It’s not about anything else except the boss. And when that’s the culture people don’t tell the boss the truth. It’s a fear based leadership."
Comey on reaction to briefings: "I started going to the whys. Something really weird is going on here. … He would not even criticize Putin in private."
Comey, on briefing Pres-elect Trump on dossier: "That was a difficult experience. I was nervous on a lot of levels."
Comey, on initial meeting w/Trump, transition team at TT on Russia: There were no Qs like what Obama asked, how do I protect country. It was all backward-looking. "They began at the table wordsmithing" about how they were going to play this to media. I'd never experienced that
RT @DafnaLinzer: Comey says “potentially obstruction of justice,” since statute requires intent. https://t.co/MlhwyJXaM3
Comey: "Obviously it’s evidence of obstruction of justice." Decided to keep to a small group. Waited to tell senior DOJ leadership because at time Sessions was only Senate-confirmed leader. Waited for Rosenstein to be confirmed
Comey said he was to brief @realDonaldTrump on "some pretty hair-raising stuff" in a security briefing. But "he seemed pretty distracted." Asked him to stay behind to speak alone. "He asked me, and I took it as a direction, to let him go. … I didn’t let it go."
Comey says that in a typical White House, having FBI interview a senior official as they did with Flynn early would have occurred only after multiple discussions w/counsel. But "I thought it’s early enough let’s just send a couple of guys over."
Comey: "I’m a witness. Potentially" in obstruction investigation. Says of Trump's efforts to discredit him publicly: "If I were a prosecutor … that’s something that I would look at very closely."
Comey on the "sleeping giant" of Americans waking up, and must focus on 2020. "We must hold him accountable. It’s not a Republican thing or a Democratic thing it’s an American thing because this is unacceptable."
. @NicolleDWallace: What would be happening to someone like Trump if he wasn't president.		@Comey: That person would be in serious jeopardy of being charged. The government wouldn’t make that sponsoring allegation if they weren’t seriously considering going forward.
Is @realDonaldTrump an un-indicted co-conspirator?		Comey: "If he’s not there he’s certainly close."

It was especially important to Gardner that he serve at least one more term. 2020 will be 100 years since the first time New Hampshire held the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, and he hoped to be part of that anniversary
A rather surprising result. Gardner supporters hoped they had closed the gap in the final weeks but few were confident he would win.
GARDNER HANGS ON		Second round of balloting: 	415 votes cast.	208 needed to win	Bill Gardner 209	Colin Van Ostern 205	Scatter - 1
And here we go - voting appears to be over.
RT @joshrogersNHPR: Through it all, the F-K ballot box has held steady. https://t.co/QXRupNprEx
Peak NH https://t.co/sVaQf6pErc
The previous vote took at least a half hour. Stay tuned.
And now the New Hampshire legislature -- known as the General Court -- will vote again on secretary state. First vote was 208 Gardner, 207 Van Ostern, 1 "scatter." A majority of ballots cast +1 is required to win.
Van Ostern supporter says both parties have affirmed that New Hampshire will stay first in 2020. But warns that because of new voting restrictions Gardner has supported, states may seek to jump ahead in future elections
Bradley: Gardner has protected New Hampshire's presidential primary. "An experiment with anyone else undermines that first in the nation status, which is not only important to New Hampshire, but is important to the United States of America."
NH Legislature now moving into speeches on behalf of the two candidates once again, but just 3 minutes instead of 15. Gardner supporter Jeb Bradley first.
Add, now, this: Gardner telling dean of NH press @jdistaso he thinks he has already won https://t.co/40Os7BSNdX
Trial by fire here as multiple motions and questions are being posed to the just-elected New Hampshire Speaker of the House, Steve Shurtleff. Democrats just won back control of the chamber in the midterms.
I suppose it is fitting that 2018 should end with a vote for the chief elections officer of a state heading into confusion over the rules of the election itself
Confusion now about why rules of the House (most votes win) shouldn't apply to secretary of state election, which is a "joint convention" of the State House and State Senate.
Some context here - New Hampshire's is a citizen legislature. 400 state reps and 24 state senators who earn $100 a year. Each represents just about 3,000 people.		Something to watch: will all 416 who voted on first ballot remain for second?
Actually, this is risking going off the rails. Now a legislator stands to question why the candidate with most votes, even if not a majority of all votes, shouldn't win. Speaker explains that rule has been precedent for constitutional officers
The legislature will now vote on whether to allow Gardner and Van Ostern to address the legislature (challenging ruling of the chair that they would not).
New Hampshire speaker says the candidates did not agree on whether they should both address the legislature. State senator challenges that ruling.
New Hampshire legislature now back in session. A state senator is now making a motion to allow both candidates to address the legislature personally
Election requires a majority vote of all non-blank ballots cast.		Gardner won his first election 218-174. Only other notable contested race was in 1984, when he won 284-123.
According to a memo on the voting process produced by a supporter of Van Ostern, ballots pre-printed with both candidates names, and space for write-in. It is a secret ballot
Joint legislative session now in recess. House Speaker said both sides would have a chance to address legislature again before presumably another vote. But considering that Gardner hasn't faced a real challenge for this job in 4 decades, they're likely brushing up on process

Biden: "Democrats choose hope over fear. Democrats choose unity over division. And most importantly, we choose truth over lies."
Biden: "Where’s our competition if we remember who the hell we are? There’s nothing beyond our capacity. 		"The only thing strong enough to tear apart America is America itself. And we’ve seen it start. But we have to stop it."
Biden mentions Mitch McConnell in warning about potential entitlement cuts. Crowd boos his name but Biden says: "He did us a favor because he was the only one that was flat out honest!"
Biden: "But that’s not what built America. .. America was built by leaders who had integrity and empathy for others. Have you heard any words of empathy?"
Biden: the "new" GOP "seem to believe that shared American values are some form of outdated political correctness. That committing to something bigger than ourselves is naïve, that we're suckers. That facts are relative."
Biden updates the tally, saying he's done events for 63 candidates this midterm cycle. Everywhere he travels, "there’s an insatiable desire for women and men with character to occupy our public office."
Biden in full nostalgia mode despite his weak voice. Says when crowd says “Run Joe Run” reminds him of running to or from a fight in streets of Scranton https://t.co/vUYqFF4DXP

Especially blunt Biden on GOP now saying they'll back protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. "Lie! Simple unadulterated lie!"
He does this most events, but Biden is especially leaning in to his ties to @BarackObama here in Iowa --  "he’s one of my personal best friends" and "all the memes are accurate."
Biden keeps updating the numbers of states he's been to and candidates he's done events for -- 24, and 54+. Says mission for Dems is the same everywhere: "Our job is to restore dignity to the political discourse and restore the basic bargain in America."
During his usual riff about neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the alt-right and others allowing hate to fester, Biden adds a reference in Iowa to "guys like Steve King"
Biden says Republicans "seem to have lost their nerve." They’re spending more time protecting the White House and choosing party over country.
It used to be in a Biden speech you could count on multiple Irish poet references. Now, you can be sure of him quoting at least one conservative columnist
Biden was sticking to his prepared remarks here much more than usual, until he found himself choked up talking about his son Beau. "So many of you were so decent to my Beau ... Literally hundreds and hundreds of Iowans wrote beautiful letters to me about my boy."

Biden, more than a half hour into a speech he promised to keep brief, invites two youngsters in the audience  who looked like they were fading to sit down on stage with him
Biden: "This is about character, this election." Adds that "we need Republicans of character."
Biden says as he travels the country, people don’t bring up a specific issue. "They bring up the mood of the country. They ask if it’s going to be ok. They’re looking for people who tell the truth. People who are authentic. People who don’t belittle other people."
Biden said he had two friends who belong to Pittsburgh synagogue targeted this week. Talks about pipe bombs sent to him and others. "Folks, this is not who we are. We need to recognize that words matter."
.@JoeBiden to students at U-Wisconsin: "But for 72,000 votes nationwide in basically 5 states, this being one of them, we wouldn’t be having the debate I’m about to engage with you."		My piece on Biden &amp; Obama trying to win back the Obama-Trump states https://t.co/1YrujUUTie
Baldwin says she didn't understand why she became top target of outside groups like the Koch Brothers. But "I decided I would wear it like a badge of honor. Because these folks have figured out that I’m not afraid to stand up against them. And I will always fight for you."
Baldwin recalls a highlight of her career, being in the White House to watch @barackobama sign the Affordable Care Act into law. "I wasn’t close enough to hear what the Vice President whispered. But it is a BFD."

@MEPFuller @Bencjacobs @igorbobic in fairness @latimes style was healthcare one word. I can't unlearn that training.
Obama: The biggest threat to our democracy does not come from one person in the White House or Republicans in congress. ... The biggest threat to our democracy is indifference. The biggest threat to our democracy is cynicism.
Obama: "One election won’t fix everything. But it’s a start."
Obama: "Michelle is not running for president."
And as part of Obama's focus on more than just Congress, he makes a specific pitch in Vegas for an automatic voter registration ballot initiative.
Obama says he's been encouraged at new civic activism. "We’ve got a movement of citizens out there, including record numbers of women."
Obama's pitch to millennials to vote. "You wouldn’t let your grandmother decide what you should wear. You would not allow your parents to decide what’s on your playlist."
@Bencjacobs me, two seconds faster
Obama: "I know you can bet on anything here in Vegas, but you don’t want to bet that Republicans are actually going to protect your healthcare."
Obama: Let me say something as the man who passed the law that protects people with preexisting conditions from being discriminated against: they have no way of protecting people with preexisting conditions in anything they've proposed
There it is! After the mention of Mitch McConnell elicits boos in Vegas, Obama say: "Don’t boo vote. Booing doesn’t do anything. Booing doesn’t help. Voting helps." Adds. "Don't boo. Don't hashtag."
RT @SchreckReports: Alex Jones just showed up at the Trump rally in Houston
Obama's NV pitch: "We have a chance to restore some sanity in our politics. We can tip the balance of power back to you, the American people. Ultimately there is only one real check on abuses of power … and that is you and your vote."
Obama: "Republicans in power want you to feel cynical. They want you not to vote. Instead of addressing the challenges that exist, they exploit some of the history we have in this country of racial and ethnic and religious divisions."
Obama, without naming his successor: "So when you hear all this talk about economic miracles right now, remember who started it!"
Obama recalls the situation he inherited in 2008. "I just hope that people kind of notice the pattern .. They run things into the ground and we have to come back and clean things up."
Obama says the midterms are "more important than any election in my lifetime. And that includes when I was on the ballot!"		Says consequences of staying home "would be profoundly dangerous."

Biden: "Mark my words ... if we do not win back the House the next major move is a massive cut of Social Security. These guys know exactly what they’re doing."		Two women then shouted out: "Ditch Mitch!" And the Kentucky crowd goes wild.
Biden says Obama didn't want to go out and give a victory lap after passing the Affordable Care Act. Talks about GOP attacks on law now, including preexisting conditions. "The biggest thing we did was give people peace of mind."
Another thing Biden talks about now with more gusto than he did pre-16: his relatively minimal financial holdings, not owning stocks, not accepting speaking fees, etc. "It’s not wrong to do that. I didn’t want anyone to ever be able to say I was being influenced by money."
Biden talks about how they don't teach shop anymore in schools. "Not everyone has to go to college to make a good living. But everyone needs more education than they’re getting now. And that includes early education."
An issue Biden talks about routinely on the trail that you don't hear often: the prevalence of non-compete clauses for service jobs, like fast food workers. Says the only purpose they serve is to keep wages low by preventing job mobility.
Biden: "The question is not who is Donald Trump is. America knows who he is. The question is, who are we?"
Biden turns back to Turmp. "Let’s not forget. The world is watching us. They see a president who has debased our values and ceded global leadership to tyrants and thugs."
Biden, without naming Merrick Garland, says he convinced Obama to nominate him rather than a more liberal judge. Why: "Republican senators had said wonderful things about him. But we sent him back they wouldn’t hold a hearing."
Biden: "This is not your father’s Republican Party. These folks are choosing, are choosing party over country."
Biden turning up the heat on Trump: "Today the example we’re showing the rest of the world is sad. Our values are being shredded. Our democracy is under assault. The president has put his own interests before our ideals."
Biden: "Character is the single most important thing that Amy brings to this race in my view. Character is the single most lacking commodity among those serving us in the United States Congress today."

McGrath: "We come from an entire generation that doesn’t remember government working. I want our children to believe that public service is a noble cause."
McGrath wins huge applause from 2K+ on hand for saying she has refused to respond to negative ads with attacks of her own. "I trust the voters to see through this sad, worn out tactic."

@davidgura It depends on where the other votes land. His no vote could not matter
The only thing that would stop McConnell from "plowing ahead" is if Flake has secured commitments from Murkowski, Collins and other to withhold their votes contingent on the one-week delay
They reported the motion to the floor after Flake asked for a one week delay for FBI review. There's nothing stopping McConnell from still scheduling the final vote sequence to start this weekend as planned
@AaronKAlbright they just reported it to the floor.
There appears to be no enforcement mechanism yet for what Flake has just asked for. Unless it's the leverage of other Republican votes.
Exactly what Coons proposed before he and Flake left the room together https://t.co/jE2kE0qG1i https://t.co/SdKBwpEV1S
More Coons: "...  One week only. Not to spread this out past the next election, not to pursue some partisan goal, but to allow a professional FBI interview with everyone who may have relevant information."
Key line from Coons remarks? "I worry sincerely about the message we are sending to assault survivors if we plow ahead with this nomination despite the seriousness of the allegations. And I have conveyed to my friends and colleagues that I wished we would take a 1-week pause ..."
The eagle-eyed @rickbosh noted that Flake entered during the Coons remarks and they left together after
Coons added: "There has been far too much of that in this process, in a way that frankly will make it very difficult for us to take off our partisan jerseys and at some point get back to the important work of finding solutions to the real challenges facing this country."
Coons also quotes @JoeBiden, who seat he now holds: "It is always appropriate to question another senator’s policies. It is always appropriate to question another senator’s priorities. But it is never appropriate to question another senators motives."
Coons remarks earlier: "In our Twitter-fueled, smash-mouth politics of our day we must ask ourselves: what about our conduct ... here would encourage anyone to come forward with credible allegations of sexual assault, to seek a nomination to a federal court ... or to serve here?"
A key hint? From about an hour ago https://t.co/1rkrX3JSgQ
It's remarkable what can happen when spending/wall fights aren't the top story across cable https://t.co/GbO8mTEO11
Possibilities would include some new procedural play. But a reminder: even if Flake has change of heart and votes no, that doesn't mean the committee still can't send the nomination to the floor.

This moment also suggests, to the extent there's still hope of a vote, Kavanaugh knows other female senators hold his fate in their hands.
Kavanaugh just apologized to Klobuchar at least for doing this. She accepts, while indicating she has a parent who is/was an alcoholic. 		No apology to Sheldon Whitehouse, though.

@PChurlispian Yes
And another thing: this would be a very different conversation if McConnell didn’t extend filibuster rule change to SCOTUS nominations for Gorsuch.		Also: Imagine if he hadn’t had to last year?
The committee vote isn’t like a primary, where you have to win the vote to move on. It’s a motion to send it to the floor with a favorable recommendation. Nominees have advanced with negative recommendations
A note in light of Flake’s statement: Kavanaugh nomination can still go to the floor without a majority vote to support him in committee.		Then-Chairman Joe Biden voted no on Clarence Thomas in committee, but nomination still went to floor with committee evenly split 7-7
Biden closes by again invoking his late son, Beau. He died of "a terrible disease." But talks of another disease, "a plight on America, this disease of homophobia. And we can end it."
Biden, voice rising as he gets to what has become 2018 rallying cry: "We are in a fight for America’s soul. ... What has become of us? Our children are listening. And our silence is complicity." 		But tells @HRC Dinner he's confident the vast majority of the country is with them
Biden returns to endorsing marriage equality in 2012 before Obama had. "I was told how I was ruining the chances" for reelection. "I said I’ll make you a bet – the American people are already with us."
Biden singles out a young man who was essentially disowned by his family -- father threatened to stone him -- after coming out. Says he and the country have his back. 		"No court decision or law or policy or poll can replace the impact of the loss of unconditional love."
Biden: Instead of using the full might of the executive branch to security dignity, safety for all, "the president uses the White House as a literal bully pulpit." #literally
Biden to @HRC Dinner: "Despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion these forces of intolerance are determined to roll back the progress you have all made." Some of these are "the dregs of society," he says.
Biden acknowledges @EricHolder who is also speaking later at the @HRC Dinner. "When I made that announcement on @MeetThePress, all the sudden there was a cascade out of the administration."
Biden now talking about his late son's role in advancing marriage equality. Championed legislation in Delaware and joined challenge of DOMA before SCOTUS
. @JoeBiden notes @ChadHGriffin credited him for endorsing marriage equality "early -- but it was very late," he says. Adds he had made it clear to Obama staff he wouldn't shy from question if asked directly
. @DrBiden talks about incorporation of LGBT "As You Are initiative to work of the Biden Foundation. "When the history books are written we want to be on the side of equality."

An interesting speech for Biden, -- at several points has made note of times in the Obama administration where there were real differences on economic policy. Times when they wouldn't go as far as he wanted to provide middle class relief
Biden distracted during remarks when someone holds up a sign. "Am I talking too long?" he asked. Then reads what it says. "Oh, 'Run Joe.'"

There are many Dems who have wished Obama would speak out more often about the state of affairs. But his relative silence sharpens the focus on those moments when he does speak, as we'll see now in reaction to his McCain eulogy.
Obama says he and McCain would sit together often in the Oval Office, meetings that weren't advertised. 		"We considered our political battles a privilege. An opportunity to serve as steward of those ideals here at home and to do our best to advance them throughout the world."
"I was grateful but I wasn't surprised," Obama says of McCain pushing back against supporters questioning his background. "He saw himself as defending America's character, not just mine."
"What better way to get the last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about you to a national audience" - Obama, on McCain asking him and W to deliver eulogies
As George W. Bush begins his eulogy for McCain, am reminded of this comment at funeral for slain Dallas police officers:		"Too often, we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions."

@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler @RepBonnie Now, a question from @RepDougCollins: When were you last subjected to a polygraph?
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler @RepBonnie Watson Coleman closes by criticizing the FBI for in her view costing Clinton the election. "But for you, we would have had a legitimate president elected."
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler @RepBonnie Strzok, given by Watson Coleman some uninterrupted time to speak, warns that this exercise comes at a cost.		"I cannot stress enough that I ask all of you to take deeply your responsibility to maintain our system of government."
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler @RepBonnie Watson Coleman: I have never seen Republicans so desperate to protect a president we all know isn't fit to serve
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler . @RepBonnie, who I think has been in room for the entire hearing, has had enough of Gowdy, accusing him of being "out of control."		"This is not Benghazi!" she says.
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries @TGowdySC @RepJerryNadler Multiple Republican members have yielded their time to Gowdy, who has used his multiple opportunities to tick through various texts Strzok sent and ask for an explanation.		This was covered in Chapter 12 of the IG report, and in June closed hearing before same committees
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries . @TGowdySC: How many Americans have been indicted for conspiring with Russians.		Strzok: None.		@RepJerryNadler: "Yet!"
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador @RepJeffries "This hearing is a kangaroo court," Jeffries says, after referring to Putin, Kim Jong Un, and even Roy Moore as "degenerates"
@DesJarlaisTN04 @Raul_Labrador . @RepJeffries is the 30th member to pose questions to Strzok. (Some have yielded time to others). 		He's raising the litany of indictments, guilty pleas already produced by the Mueller probe
@DesJarlaisTN04 . @Raul_Labrador asking Strzok if Russia has attempted to interfere in U.S. elections before 2016. He says yes.		Labrador then raises Obama's "flexibility" comment, connecting it to Obama rebutting Romney on whether Russia was biggest threat to U.S.
.@DesJarlaisTN04: Do you like Donald Trump?		Strzok: "It's fair to say I'm not a fan."
. @RepGutierrez raising a host of issues he said the committee should be investigating but isn't, including family separations. Also raises women who've accused Trump of assault
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan @GerryConnolly @RepTedDeutch Deutch now asking about GOP insisting Strzok answer Qs about ongoing Russia probe when the DOJ IG just issued a report faulting DOJ officials for discussing ongoing investigations
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan @GerryConnolly . @RepTedDeutch calls GOP efforts to undermine DOJ "truly shameful." Noting attacks against Strzok and other DOJ officials, says he wishes "even a slight degree of that same fervor [was] directed against what the Russians did in 2016."
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan @GerryConnolly Connolly reading statements critical of Trump one by one, asking Strzok if he wrote them. Each time, "No." Connolly then identifying the Republican who actually said it. Among those he's read:		Sen. Sasse, Rep. Roby, Rep. Comstock, Sen. Lee
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan Rep. @GerryConnolly says today's hearing has all the makings of a Russian show trial. 		He's now comparing sentiments Strzok expressed in his texts which GOP said show bias to critical comments Republicans have made about Trump
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan Strzok responded to Gohmert, saying his comments reflected on his own character.
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan Democrats on the committee howled as Gohmert invoked Strzok's marriage. Nadler now questioning the appropriateness of impugning Strzok's character
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan WOW: Gohmert railing against Strzok as a "disgrace," saying he's embarrassed the FBI. He's even raising Strzok's extramarital affair to question his honesty
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan And now it's time for @replouiegohmert. He's the 19th member to question Strzok
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan Strzok again stating that his texts do not show bias because no one has been able to demonstrate that any official actions he took in the investigations were linked to his personal views
RT @jeremyherb: Rep. Tom Rooney, a House Intel R who was heavily involved with those Russia interviews, has strolled up to this Strzok hear…
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan Gowdy asking again about when the first witness interviews occurred after the Russia probe was launched July 31, 2016. Strzok says he doesn't know, last reviewed case file a year ago. (Gowdy says first was Aug. 11)		Gowdy asks how many interviews before July 31. Strzok: "None."
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan We're now back to arguing about what questions Strzok can answer. 		Strzok: "There is an appropriate time for oversight, and it is at the end of an investigation."		Goodlatte says he can answer now, which Nadler says is an example of GOP "sabotage" efforts
@RepCohen @Jim_Jordan I never had contact with Fusion GPS, Simpson or Corn, Strzok tells Jordan
@RepCohen Rep. @Jim_Jordan focusing his questions to Strzok on the Steele dossier now. Aiming to flesh out how it was incorporated into the Russia probe
"If I could give you a Purple Heart I would," @RepCohen tells Strzok during the 4th hour of his testimony
@DarrellIssa Amazing: Issa has Strzok reading publicly some of his own texts.
And we're back! @DarrellIssa is the 11th member out of ~76 able to question Peter Strzok
@RepZoeLofgren @RepMarkMeadows @RepMattGaetz @RatcliffeTX4 We're heading into the first break in today's Strzok hearing, as the full House has some votes coming. So far 10 of 76 members have asked questions
@RepZoeLofgren @RepMarkMeadows @RepMattGaetz . @RatcliffeTX4 repeatedly noting that Strzok and Page were exchanging personal views on official government phones.		In DOJ IG report, Lisa Page explained they used work phones "because we were trying to keep our affair a secret from our spouses."
@RepZoeLofgren @RepMarkMeadows This question also prompts @RepMattGaetz to ask if this could also apply to interviews with Andrew McCabe and other witnesses. Dems seem open to all but no final decisions
@RepZoeLofgren Back to procedural back-and-forth: @RepMarkMeadows suggests he's open to releasing closed Strzok transcript if it's scrubbed for personal info, and delayed until after Lisa Page testifies tomorrow
@RepZoeLofgren Strzok again expressing regret about his text messages but denying bias and that any views he expressed affected official acts.
@RepZoeLofgren 6 down, 70 members left to question Strzok
Senior Dem member of House Judiciary @repzoelofgren says in 24 years in Congress she's never seen anything like the "circus" happening today in Strzok hearing.

@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell @RepJerryNadler And now @RepCicilline suggesting he may just unilaterally release that transcript, saying he sees no prohibition in committee rules.
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell @RepJerryNadler Nadler now motions to release transcript of private Strzok interview last month. 		Goodlatte says practice is not to release transcripts of ongoing committee investigations.		Nadler: Many of same Qs are being asked today, and some answers were leaked
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell @RepJerryNadler Nadler: Republicans, Trump "are scared." 		"Accountability is coming one way or another, and they are scared and are trying to undermine the investigation."
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell .@RepJerryNadler asks Strzok a series of questions about the gravity of ongoing threat of Russian interference in U.S. elections. Then proceeds to attack GOP for focusing oversight on Clinton, Trump probes instead of dealing with that threat.
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell Goodlatte notes that other members of the team surely have exchanged texts, too. Strzok repeats that Mueller likely concerned about the appearance of bias
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell .@RepGoodlatte asking about Mueller decision to remove Strzok from the Russia probe. 		"He mentioned the existence of the text messages and based on that he asked me to immediately return to the FBI."
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell . @RepGoodlatte asks Strzok if it was appropriate for Comey to make his July 2016 announcement about Clinton email case. Strzok initially declines, but when pressed says he knows it was not taken lightly
RT @kasie: Me: “Can you expand on that?”	Ryan: “No.” https://t.co/9QZC0j6NPs

@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell Rep. Cummings asking Strzok about decision in fall of 2016 to prioritize the Russia counterintelligence investigation just underway over the discovery of Weiner laptop.		Strzok: "I can think of few more severe threats" than Russian interferene

@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell One other interesting note: apparently there are not enough seats in the room for the members of both committees. Some are standing or taking turns filling seats.
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell During a vote on Swalwell's motion, Rep. Issa now raising whether the votes of members who serve on both committees should in fact be counted twice, or just once. Goodlatte says once
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell Staff for both committees getting a workout during all these procedural inquiries. Lots of conferring with members and each other to advise what's in order, what's not
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes @RepSwalwell (Bannon did ultimately appear, but members said did not answer many questions)
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes With threat to hold Strzok in contempt, @RepSwalwell makes a motion about holding non-cooperative witnesses before House Intel Cmte, like Steve Bannon, in contempt.
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes Strzok now making a very forceful rebuttal, that whatever personal political views he has expressed privately were completely separate from how the investigations he participated in were run
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes Have committee members exchanged text messages about today's hearing? Might they show bias during their investigation? What about committee staff involved in various investigations?
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes The nightmare of the digital age: Just imagine for a minute if your private, often flippant text messages were in public view, and all the questions that could be asked by your bosses
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes The five minutes per member limit for questions is already out the window. There are ~80 members of these two committees (though some serve on both)

@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress @DevinNunes We barely got through the first question without a near total breakdown of committees running this over whether Strzok can follow DOJ counsel guidance not to answer certain questions
@RepGoodlatte @MeetThePress Questions about the circumstances surrounding the opening of the Russia probe in July 2016 are also at the heart of the many GOP document requests that @DevinNunes and others have been making
@RepGoodlatte Consider this: as Rudy GIuliani made clear Sunday on @MeetThePress, Trump won't agree to interview "unless they can satisfy us that there's some basis for this investigation."		Gowdy now asking Strzok about this very issue
And now @RepGoodlatte is already threatening to hold Strzok in contempt if he refuses to answer the initial Gowdy question
Expect this a lot in the many hours to come: In response to a question related to the Russia investigation, Strzok turns to his attorney and says he is under instruction from DOJ not to comment on ongoing investigation
Targeting GOP, Strzok calls hearing "just another victory notch in Putin’s belt and another milestone in our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart."
Strzok: "Russian interference in our elections constitutes a grave attack on our democracy. Most disturbingly, it has been wildly successful - sowing discord in our nation and shaking faith in our institutions."
Strzok: "This investigation is not politically motivated, it is not a witch hunt, it is not a hoax."
Strzok makes significant defense of his objectivity, noting that if he really wanted to defeat Trump, he had ability to leak existence of counterintel probe of his campaign before election. "The thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind."
Strzok adds: "But let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took."
Strzok explains those texts: "At times my criticism was blunt, but despite how it’s been characterized, it was not limited to one person or one party – I criticized various countries and politicians, including Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, then-candidate Trump and others."
As Rep Elijah Cummings delivered opening statement staff held up large signs showing five individuals who have pleaded guilty so far in Mueller probe. GOP briefly objected https://t.co/0p0JtR5vZq

Much of the focus will be on those text messages. Worth noting that the DOJ Inspector General devoted an entire chapter to these texts in his just-released report. Includes Strzok explanations https://t.co/RgxQd4LEio
Strzok already appeared for a ~11 hour closed hearing in June. Transcript has not been released
Peter Strzok in the hot seat today in what will likely be a day-long public hearing before House committees. GOP members already teeing off on "bias" he showed in text messages with FBI colleague

@VaughnHillyard That Madison County number of 2,696 absentee ballots returned was nearly double what they saw in that county in 2014 general election, when all state constitutional offices were on ballot.
@VaughnHillyard So what to make of that? AL Sec/State said turnout in August primary was 18%, runoff was 14%. He was projecting 25% today. But these absentee numbers suggest could be higher still
@VaughnHillyard Baldwin County (east of Mobile): 1,528 absentee ballot requests, 1,178 returned through Monday p.m. Circuit Clerk estimated that's 2 to 3 times the primary and runoff.
@VaughnHillyard Shelby County Circuit Clerk Mary Harris: "I’ve done these for 45 years, and this is higher than what I anticipated. ...  I’ve already ordered more ballots three times."
@VaughnHillyard Shelby County (Birmingham burbs): 1,182 absentee ballots through Monday, compared with just 170 for the primary and 270 for the runoff.
@VaughnHillyard Tuscaloosa County: 1,157 voters submitted absentee ballot applications— six times as many as primary and the runoff. County elex manager says they “usually base everything on the absentee requests" re: final turnout
@VaughnHillyard Montgomery County: 1,834 absentee ballot requests logged, 1,495 through Monday. "This is a huge increase for us” Circuit Clerk told us, saying for special elections usually that number is a couple hundred
@VaughnHillyard Madison County (Huntsville): 3,411 absentee ballots sent, 2,696 received by Monday p.m.		August primary: 528 absentee votes	September runoff: 554
@VaughnHillyard Jefferson County (Birmingham): ~3,200 absentee ballot requests. For primary and runoff was less than 1,000 each
@VaughnHillyard We called around to the state's biggest county election officials, who gave stats on absentee ballots sent/received, comparing to past elections.
So election days are all about making the most of what data we have until polls close. Some notes ahead from @VaughnHillyard and me pointing to potentially higher turnout
