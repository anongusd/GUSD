@SisterUnity Thanks! So much fun meeting you!
I'm glad Lady Gaga didn't stay in her lane. Same for Chris Jericho,Justin Timberlake, Mark Wahlberg,The Rock,etc. As an American,I have the right to change careers, have multiple careers, try new things&amp;make money how I see fit. Sorry if that's scary to you.Have a juice box&amp;relax https://t.co/mCZkT7H94X
I did improv with Tim Meadows and Upright Citizens Brigade in LA. I've acted alongside Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd, Danny McBride, Jamie Kennedy, Jason Segal &amp; Courteney Cox. Once I did a little TV show called Saturday Night Live. Too bad I'm not funny or talented enough to try comedy
@warriormama1019 How can you read Laurie Kilmartin's tweet and NOT think she was being a petty twat to me?
Wait. So other comedians do it for free and don't want anyone to pay attention? I guess I really am doing it wrong! And she wasn't suggesting I learn. She was being a petty hateful twat to someone she's never met. https://t.co/aD6ATFK7DV
@XBIZ @BillBailey_XXX This is heartbreaking. I was lucky enough to direct and perform with Bill. He was such a gentleman and joy to have on set. He will be missed terribly. My deepest condolences to all his family, friends and fans.
@SheanaMG Where are you located?
@SheanaMG This is so terrible! I am so so sorry that happened.  What can I do for you?
@HondoAllDay Bless her heart
Wow!So supportive. I AM an "actual female" but I'll never get women who just tear other women down&amp; I know it's not a "reward".

@EddieGEastcoast You have no idea what you're talking about. I LOVE being on the road...which is why I've spent so much of my life traveling over last 20 years. This post is about the anniversary of someone working with me.
@garymoore1985 Also very true
I'm actually a very accomplished whore. And since I succeeded in getting that NDA thrown out like I wanted, guess I'm also a whore winner. You're still just a silly troll though. https://t.co/o2vfJ3Mqor

Whoever runs the @AerLingus twitter account deserves a raise and promotion because they are the only ones who seem able to get shit done! Thanks for handling my issue and saving the day!
@DShadowof At the Oxford Union. Laugh away, bitch
@brooklyndmc2009 @AerLingus Not getting paid. And I'm in Oxford.
@TrumpTheHaters1 @AerLingus You're an idiot. And you missed the point. I never said what my speech was about. You implied I don't need toiletry items to get ready because I work "in porn". You even suggested I instead only wanted them for some sort of demonstration.
@BillyNiner23 @TheStranger Too Late! I already rubbed my snatch all over that city. Be careful where you sit! Hahaha! I'm already scheduled to return, too. You should probably just move.
@kmarsh625 @AerLingus I consider the Oxford Union to be important, don't you?
@CeJayC Thank god I never put him in my mouth
@TheNewYorkTony @TSearcaigh This dirty whore is giving a speech at the Oxford Union today so I guess someone takes me seriously.
@TrumpTheHaters1 @AerLingus Don't be an asshole. I don't want to give a speech at Oxford without looking and dressing appropriately. Has zero to do with my profession in porn. It's called respect.
@safetylawyer1 @AerLingus They have been in touch
And you can't spell https://t.co/CtHHi3unCx
Thanks for all of my nominations @XBIZ https://t.co/PYwFl57WZ5
@CPoTLCandC @AerLingus Completely agree but I'm set to give Oxford Union speech in a few hours so I'm freaking out more than if this was just a regular trip. But absolutely, not the end of the world and my heart breaks for others. Thank you for your kind words and perspective
@audioexpression @AerLingus They cannot even answer that question. I already asked.
@onthecurbprodu1 @AerLingus At the Oxford Union if you must know. Go fuck yourself
This sounds like an ongoing problem @AerLingus Where the FUCK IS MY LUGGAGE!? Flew 10 hours to give a speech and cannot do that without any of my things. https://t.co/4dTZxMFtsZ
@lguck1 @AerLingus @seatac At least you actually GOT yours! Its been almost 24 hours and still don't know where any of my luggage is. No answers. No help. Waste of very expensive business class tickets.
Warning!Never fly @AerLingus I flew business class(this airline doesn't have 1st class)&amp;ALL of my bags were lost.I can get no answers or help.I gave myself over 24hr before my important lecture just in case but now it appears I STILL have to cancel because I have none of my stuff

@brooktheflood Touche'. Please send my sincerest apologies to your undercarriage. It was insensitive of me.
@YourMarkLubbers Not true. I have done over 200 movies over last 15 years.Only 1 scene with my husband was anal so get the facts straight. But it doesn't really matter. She tried using my job as a reason to discredit me. (Consensual) sexual choices does NOT make someone less of a human.
I don't even do anal movies, you ignorant twat. That's like saying you are known for your beautiful rendition of The Star Spangled Banner. https://t.co/azOOZMDGdw

@BarroniBaloney yes
@bronk34 @AC360 @andersoncooper @CNN @MichaelAvenatti It is not a joke.  If one (or a few) people contribute a large sum, it opens myself up to rumors of being influenced and/or accused of simply being a pawn for a rich person's agenda. I did it this way to protect myself.

So much... where to start? Wish Twitter had a red pen. I think you mean "loser" but I DO find the irony of "looser" funny even if you're not smart enough to have done it intentionally. I'm not broke. I've been a very successful director in the industry for 14yrs. https://t.co/p6W8Hszxl4

The word you're looking for is "lucrative" LOL. And of course once I made you look ignorant, you take the easy/pathetic route of lashing out and attacking my appearance. Is a "your momma" comment coming next? https://t.co/AvRgsZ8VqC
If THAT is what you got from my tweet, you are a complete fucking moron. I didn't refer to guns in any way...but if you MUST know. 1. The "Dems" have not paid me. 2. I don't want your stupid guns. I have my own (not a tit joke) Thanks. https://t.co/0UvUcrnNG5
Seriously? Who gives a fuck about me, money, attorneys, spankings, affairs, etc right now? IF you care about anything other than those 17 children right now, you are more disgusting than I could ever be. You can resume calling me a dirty whore at a later time. SMH

@TashaReign I thought you did a fantastic job on the movie and looked incredible (fuck, am I even allowed to say that?) and it makes me sad that you'd make such an erroneous claim about me and the people that I VERY carefully select to work for me. We are done here and forever.
@TashaReign And I find it beyond offensive that you think as a female director I'd ever allow someone to work for me who'd behave like that. I'd kick someone's ass myself if a girl was mistreated on my set. EVERYONE knows that about me. I'm not stupid. I see a set up.
@TashaReign You were not. I was right there...as were several other people and NONE of them will agree with you. How dare you try to undo 15 years of my reputation and his career. I will not allow it. Find me one person who will state otherwise. Best wishes
@TashaReign If you are questioning my integrity as a director or "the environment" on my set, you and I are going to have a HUGE problem. And you will have zero chance of finding anyone to say they've been treated poorly on one of my shoots EVER. Take your agenda elsewhere.

Beware of the Stormy in 2018....you've all been warned.
Horses all got adjusted by chiro and had laser/massage treatments today. I had drive thru and am still limping. #priorities #spoiledbrats
@ImBrettRossi Love to! If you follow my personal IG you can see my herd. Lol
@ImBrettRossi I stalked your ponies on IG. Love them!
@ComingLinguist It was a general statement not specific to the Globes. I've overheard some disgusting conversations amongst women lately bashing men. I also saw a poor elderly man nearly get castrated for holding the door for a woman at Sears last week.
@ComingLinguist Not to same degree. I HAVE been discriminated against/passed over for jobs simply for being female. That being said..for each jerk who did that,I've had 50 guys work for me(crew&amp;talent)who didn't give a fuck about what I have between my legs.This blanket manbashing is upsetting
@ImBrettRossi Fingers crossed for ulcers or bots...both are easy fixes and will show on the scope.
@ImBrettRossi @Atravelerxxx Yes...totally possible. I'd also soak your hay cubes. I have 7 horses, 1 of which has a very sensitive tummy.
@FootLngBankRoll I'm fine with doing so in their acceptance speeches. NOT in presenting nominees/awards. No one has the right to take that moment from a winner...esp one who has done nothing wrong. Filmakers pour their souls into their work. Its not ok.
Instead of thinking"what a great time to be a woman"all I find myself thinking is"what a terrible time to be a man". How horrifying to have a penis tonight at Golden Globes.Not all men are monsters.Making EVERY award about your agenda is not right. Its like Kanye/Taylor on repeat
@ImBrettRossi @Atravelerxxx Never saw it...I'm sorry. I just turned off my privacy so you can see/respond.
@Atravelerxxx @ImBrettRossi Could also be ulcers. If so do a round of Ulcerguard (cheapest I've found is on Amazon) and then Aloe juice (walgreens) for maintenance
@Atravelerxxx @ImBrettRossi Sounds like an impaction that didn't quite clear. Have him scoped and if don't feed SandClear, start asap
@mystik8285 In Dallas. And of course!
@LilyLanexxx With the help of pain meds I did something similar recently. Stuff started arriving a few days later and I was like WTF did I do?
I will immediately fire anyone who does this. And text me whoever you're referring to so I don't hire them. https://t.co/x9wVhlLVzs

@AHiddenAccount Which I think is also crazy. I think it should absolutely remain an attempted murder charge to knowingly infect or not disclose diseases to someone.
@masterbearjedi Natural selection at its finest
Wait...wait...some people (IN the industry) want to allow those who have tested HIV+ to perform? Have you all lost your fucking minds? I don't give a damn if its "discrimination"! Fuck that&amp;anyone who thinks this is ok. Nope nope nope
Seriously considering buying some beer&amp;taking a chair to the walmart near my house to watch the Black Friday fights. Sometimes you just wanna watch the world burn.

Thank you to Nexxxt Level and Spiegler for never fucking me over and being honest about your talent when I book them

@JJJwrighty the magazine. Thankfully. For now. But very justified question

HE TOUCHED MY FACE! I'd rather someone touch my butthole that touch my face!
Please send vodka and bail donations to seat 14A on Southwest flight 618 or I may be forced to jump
He seriously just tried to stick his earbud in my ear so I could hear "some Creed, the best band ever!" Please start a gofundme for my bail
The girl on the other side just threatened to slap him. I had a glimmer if hope but she has since retreated to the bathroom, abandoning me
He's playing air guitar&amp;singing Journey and I'm "unpatriotic" for refusing to sing with him.
Started with "I'm afraid of heights so took some pills.Sorry if I drool on you".He's elbowed me in the tit 5x in 10 min&amp;lost his phone twice
I'm 99% sure I'll be going to airport jail thanks to the dipshit sitting next to me on this flight
May 20 and 21 I will be performing at the @penthousephilly Make your lap happy and come see me ;)

RT @WickedPictures: #WantedWednesday @StormyDaniels' @XBIZ Awards #AcceptanceSpeech. Miss @Amber_Raynexxx was so happy that night. #RIP htt‚Ä¶
@vajayjaylov I hired Ameristall
@vajayjaylov Do you do metal buildings? I want a steel barn with 10 stalls
@jonathaneriley FML‚Ä¶Luckily all the fencing is already in place and really nice.
@vitasamsung I didn't even know they were fighting
No clue how anyone survives building a house. I'm just looking at metal barns &amp; the plans/financing/etc/etc makes me wanna jump off the roof
@omgitsjhphans Of course
@marcuslondon @greg_battiste Wow! Thank you Marcus. That means alot coming from you
This photo is hilarious! Galli SO big that you can't even see me‚Ä¶ https://t.co/C1ytVWkNzd
@lfgg536 I'm retired. I only did things I wanted to. My body, my choices.
@dhauck75 hell no
@kun69kun The flowers represent love, a boy who stole my heart and my home state. The clock is stopped on the time of my daughter's birth
@jamesjohnson560 @stevenusc79 The director was awful and treated everyone like shit. Only time I've ever walked off a set
@scottchampagne nope
@kun69kun That is definitely a good one. I also like the one in Crime of Passion with @tommypistol
@aenrique73 Thank you and yes
@lordhenry17 Usually not
@oriolmusic Way more than anyone should
@oriolmusic Hell no!
@prozac33 I've already done a lot but I wouldn't say no to something cool
@swanton83177 You are very welcome. Thank you for all your support
@jeremyfamous  Not much. It is hard work on very little sleep.
@scottchampagne Yes! Thank you
@adsb81 Thanks! That one was a lot of fun. So many of my favorite ladies
@swanton83177 Not at this time. Hopefully I will be back
@dra_88tx Nope‚Ä¶he missed his chance ;)
@anzac_p Thanks
@cms15 We got lucky this time‚Ä¶everything was south of me
@aegtrc Off
@harshishooligan Not really
@swanton83177 No idea. I have 5 unreleased scenes left but not sure when releasing
@kun69kun I am not shooting anymore but I have some unreleased stuff coming up
@stallio34504631 I don't live in LA.  I'm not shooting anything for awhile
@anzac_p He's coming along nicely. I posted lots of pics and video of him yesterday
@friscoktank I picked the last five but they weren't shot in a particular order
@mstcambot Definitely comedy
@adsb81 @rachelstarrxxx Sorry‚Ä¶I only directed her. And she was AWESOME. We may be convinced to collaborate on a web scene though ;)
@kun69kun Nope. I have some unreleased ones but that is it
@friscoktank There are 5 unreleased ones and that is all
@stevenusc79 I've only done one and it was awful
@adsb81 I only have one left to be released and it is with Kleio Valentin and Asa Akira
@david_altruiste I'm going to the barn to ride so I'm in a black sports bra
@stevenusc79 Wanted and Divorcees
@adsb81 Performing‚Ä¶although I DO love directing them both as well.
@stevenusc79 None
@adsb81 Asa Akira and Sammie Rhodes
Saturday morning Q&amp;A? Why not‚Ä¶.Got a question? Ask now.
@dc_geoff He got injured in Feb at a show in FL and its not healing correctly. It is a simple surgery but I'll miss all this show season
@dc_geoff Ziggy and Buzz both had surgery this week.
@firefightnsprks That is false. All of mine lay down and nap every day. Ziggy spends several hours a day stretched out snoring in his stall
Up early on a Sat &amp;I'm not going to the show because my horses are in the hospital. "This sport will never love you as much as you love it"
@puckguy14 I've posted some photos and videos of him. Scroll thru my timeline.
@puckguy14 We're doing ok. He's still a tad suspicious of me(can't make fast movements) He misses his mom but he's realizing I'm not too bad
@rachelstarrxxx Yes ma'am! I bet your dog agrees ;)
