@marcorubio Your vile president verbally attacks Americans daily. The people cannot be expected to be civil to uncivil rulers. But you know that. Direct your words to the president.
@GrassrootsSpeak @SpikeArt McConnell and Sanders both get on TV and talk about Democrats (me) as though they are the enemy rather than Americans with opposing viewpoints. If I were to see either one of them you can bet I would say something.

@DrewAvera @smotus I don't think that's true, although it is possible. Either way it shows a vicious divide in this country and Trump exacerbates it on purpose. That we feel like one side attacked the other instead of like a sick person attacked our country is very sad.
@claudiatenney @ABrindisiNY https://t.co/fUaiIp14BT
@marcorubio Um praise for a congressman body slamming a reporter? The Second Amendment people will take care of Hillary? Marco Rubio is a coward and a sycophant.
This could have been a RWNJ, or a crazy liberal pretending to be a RWNJ, or a conservative pretending to be a liberal pretending to be a RWNJ. What I know is that our country is so bitterly divided, and Donald Trump and his vile sons sow this division with purpose and vigor.
@marcorubio It's almost like you mean what you're saying. But your actions speak louder than your words and you have failed your country.
@marcorubio You could have stopped this a long time ago. Trump's entire presidency is based on dividing this country. You could have chosen to take a stand against tyranny and people on both sides would have stood with you.
@senatemajldr @SecretService @USPS Americans are united in absolutely nothing and you have yourself to thank you POS.
@funder Just think if Congress had stood up to Trump, Dems and Republicans together, we would be united in bringing down a corrupt tyrant and restoring government as its meant to work. @SpeakerRyan has missed an opportunity to unite his country because he hates poor people.
@marcorubio Have you had enough of this tyrant yet? Your words are meaningless without action you know good and well that Trump is dangerous for America. This comes straight from the top.
@PressSec This vile division between Americans is only going to get worse. Your president and his administration identify Dems as enemies rather than fellow citizens with differing views and beliefs. All this for a fucking ignorant, ugly, untalented, immoral man.
@mrbromwich This picture is one of the first things I thought of when I woke up today. Heartbreaking and maddening at the same time.

@nbcsnl thank you for easing the pain.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump We're more than half of the country. If more than  half of the country has lost faith in the government it's not better. And it's going to get a lot worse and you can thank yourself.
@SenatorCollins since you did not take the time to investigate Ms. Swetick's claims it's shocking that you are on TV saying they aren't true. Mark Judge told his girlfriend that this did happen. It's not that uncommon, as shocking and disgusting as it is. You are a disgrace.
@MichaelAvenatti @chucktodd @ChrisCoons Please tell Ms. Swetnick there are many who support her. She must feel like she was punched in the stomach that people at the highest levels don't care.
@AdPowPow @MichaelAvenatti @chucktodd @ChrisCoons No one cares. He lied and it's an objective truth and they don't care. We have a spoiled brat lying misogynist alt-right Supreme Court Justice now. Disgusting.
@MichaelAvenatti @chucktodd @ChrisCoons These old fucks want a cookie for not tearing down Dr. Ford during her testimony and then confirming her assailant. Ms. Swetnick's claims may sound sensational, but it's not that uncommon for this to happen. Nothing would have stopped R's from confirming him so blame them not her
@pattonoswalt I needed a real laugh, thank you!
@JohnCornyn Careful, he likes beer, but as you saw in the hearings he gets really pissed when anyone else mentions drinking. That's because he's an alcoholic.

@RadioFreeTom I have many skeletons in my closet, but I am not seeking a position that would allow me to have real impact on the lives of millions. I lied about a DUI in college and was therefore denied a second job as a cashier in my late twenties. So I think SCOTUS must be 100% clean.

@nbcwashington This jackass doesn't get to say what non partisan researchers do studies on.
@thehill Sorry, a tax cut that allows us to buy the deluxe mac and cheese while politicians feast isn't good enough. And I have a really good job. Saving for college for two kids, to care for aging family members, and my retirement is where my money goes. Fuck the GOP.

@sdebbieharris @what88888 @ND_Knelly @CliffShep @Asehpe @davidhogg111 Insurance guarantees that money is available for the victims. If you sue a gun owner who has nothing, you get no payout. You may be able to destroy their credit but that's really not the goal.
