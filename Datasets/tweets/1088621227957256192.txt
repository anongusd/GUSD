@AOC Hey @AOC it's OK to fly or use Uber.  But what you should do is offset the carbon emissions from these activities so your net emissions/carbon footprint is Zero.  It's easy to do and we can help you do it.  #ZEN #ZeroEmissionsNow https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWhitehouse Senator, one way to get some press would be if you went on each show to announce how you and many other members of Congress are stepping up and doing the right thing by offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint.  Walk the talk and lead by example. #ZEN #ZeroEmissionsNow
@RepArmstrongND Congressman, a great first step would be to have our elected officials and Presidential candidates lead by example and offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  We have asked many of the GND sponsors to do so yet they ignore the requests or see it as trivial.  Walk the talk.
@AOC Not sure who is on your staff but hope you have at least one token environmentalist. You know the guy/gal that makes sure your recycling, sets up carpools, bikes/walks to work, works to make sure your office is energy efficient, &amp; also measures and offsets your carbon footprint.
@amyklobuchar @3M Great things are happening.  Imagine how many small businesses could do the same thing. Then imagine that you show them how to do it by offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint via alternative energy offsets.  It is easy and we can help you do it.
@saikatc @SenMarkey Just not enough to offset his campaign's carbon footprint... #ZEN #ZeroEmissionsNow
@cdbrzezinski Leaders lead by example.  America is sick of hypocrisy.  Each Senator's offset may be a small amount of Co2 that would be eliminated from the atmosphere but it all counts.  This has to be "Do as I Do" they can't ask consumers and businesses to change when they won't.
@cdbrzezinski Great changes can be made by grass roots efforts.  Offsets can fund investment into wind, solar, and other energy sources.  Why wouldn't you want your leaders to start this process of transforming our energy economy?
@justicedems @SenMarkey Too bad he did not announce that he was actually going to walk the talk and offset his campaign's carbon footprint.		He could have challenged every single Senator to offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  That would have been #Action.		Sad.		#ZeroEmissionsNow #ZEN
@AOC RE: Climate Change you have great intentions. It's your decisions and actions that seem to lack the conviction that is needed.		So what would be great decisions.		1- Offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint	2- Opening your NY office in a LEED certified building		Walk the talk.
@amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Looking for action on Climate Change?  Perhaps you can run a Carbon-Neutral campaign?  Lead by example - walk the talk.  We can help you measure and offset your campaign's carbon footprint.		https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs		#ZeroEmissionsNow #ZEN		#
@saikatc @RepSeanMaloney America is full of ambitious and can achieve great things.		What will happen first		- Land a manned spacecraft on Mars	- Get every GND supporter to offset their campaign's carbon footprint		One of these should be easy but we are betting on the Mars landing. #ZEN #ZeroEmissionsNow
@RoKhanna @RoKhanna can we count on you to offset your campaign's CO2 emissions?  This is everyone's problem yet politicians are not willing to offset their emissions.  Will you be the one to do the right thing?  Walk the talk and lead by example.  #ZEN #ZeroEmissionsNow
@fromhello2hello @Ilhan Thank you.  We really are trying to get people to understand that this is everyone's problem.  Reducing carbon emissions should be as common place as recycling aluminum, paper, and glass is today.
@dolphin_howard @BernieSanders Yes it is true that the way to get to the places he wants to be is a private jet. However, he should measure and offset his carbon emissions.  The campaign should not increase GHG levels and exacerbate global warming.  We really want him to lead by example - others will follow.
@BernieSanders Bernie will you offset your campaign's carbon footprint? The last go around you spent over $5 million on air travel. How much will it be this time? Will you pledge to measure and offset your campaign's carbon footprint? Leaders lead by example. Walk the talk, feel the Bern.
@BernieSanders Unless they make you fly commercial.  Then it's on like Donkey Kong.  Step up and offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  Last go around you spent over $5 million on air travel.  The earth needs you to do the right thing.
@KamalaHarris Well it sounds like we can count on you, one of the many Presidential Primary Candidates crisscrossing the country, to measure and offset your carbon footprint - right?  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Offset your campaign's emissions and others will follow.
@amyklobuchar Well it sounds like we can count on you, one of the many Presidential Primary Candidates crisscrossing the country, to measure and offset your carbon footprint - right?  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Offset your campaign's emissions and others will follow.
@SenWhitehouse Perhaps a good start would be to offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  By doing so you show you are a man of action.  It's time to walk the talk.  Getting to Net-Zero emissions begins with one person doing the right thing - will it be you?
@SenMarkey Senator, we really like what you are saying.  But it needs to be backed up by your actions.  By offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint you show that you really do care about Climate Change.  It is a small but symbolic action that others will follow.  We can help you do it.
@Ilhan Talk is cheap - offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint is too.  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Until you offset your emissions you are part of the problem - not the solution.  We can help you do it.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@justicedems @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt We are still waiting for a major political candidate to offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  Maybe things are changing but until these leaders start leading by example it's all just talk.  It's time to walk the talk.
@saikatc @sunrisemvmt @senatemajldr Are they asking why politicians don't offset their campaign's carbon footprint?  		Working on our new motto:		We're building an army of young people to ask politicians why they don't offset their carbon footprint and piss off just about everyone in the process.
@KamalaHarris We are on board.  But we are still waiting for your commitment to run a Carbon-Neutral campaign.  It's easy to measure and offset your carbon footprint.  We can help you.  It's time to walk the talk.
@amyklobuchar That is a lot of traveling.  We assume you probably flew on airplanes to get to those places.  Any chance you would consider offsetting your carbon emissions from those flights?  It would be a great statement to run a Carbon-Neutral campaign.  Walk the talk.
@TheBabylonBee Sad but so true. Our most vocal politicians refuse to offset their campaign's carbon footprint. They would much rather spend money on more yard signs, brochures, and bumper sticker than run a Carbon-Neutral campaign. Until they offset they are part of the problem not the solution
@AOC Politicians that don't measure and offset their campaign's carbon footprint are worse than... well actually there is nobody worse.  Walk the talk - lead by example.  Keep it 100
@evanlweber @justicedems @sunrisemvmt @TheDemocrats @SenFeinstein The sad fact is that politicians won't measure &amp; offset their own campaign's emissions. It would not be a huge cost for them but until they do this small but symbolic step they are part of the problem not the solution. Getting to Net-Zero should start with them leading by example
@McReynoldsJoe @brianschatz Great points. There is no reason why emission reduction and offsetting can't be accomplished by a "mass public consciousness" of the climate change issue which is sparked by our leaders actually leading by example. Any GHG reduction is good even if it is only symbolic.
@McReynoldsJoe @brianschatz Perhaps our elected leaders should be held to a higher standard of doing the right thing - maybe even before the law requires them to do so.  There is no reason why emission reduction and offsetting can't be as sensible and common place as recycling is today.
@McReynoldsJoe @brianschatz Landfilling aluminum cans is not illegal.  We did not need laws or regulations in most states to have people responsibly recycle cans.  So we shouldn't expect members of Congress to recycle their aluminum cans until we have a law requiring it.
@McReynoldsJoe @brianschatz We are asking our leaders to do the same thing they are asking of others.  Why can't they operate Carbon-Neutral campaigns?  They should reduce emissions and offset the ones they can't eliminate.  That is the same thing that they want everyone else to do - get to Net-Zero.
@brianschatz Great sentiment.  However, it would mean so much more if you would walk the talk and offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  How do we get the whole country to Net-Zero when our leaders refuse to offset their footprint?  Sad but true reality.
@daenku32 @AriNatter @theGSpledge Most politicians have no shame.  If they did they would offset their campaign's carbon emissions.  When it comes down to it they would rather spend money on more yard signs than get to Net-Zero emissions.  Sad but true.  @AOC @SenMarkey
@SenMarkey @kelleratlarge @wbz We will be tuning in.  We hope you will announce that you will be offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint to get to Net-Zero emissions.		Really hoping for a leader to step up. And lead by example.  Climate Change will require everyone to reduce emissions.
@AOC We are aghast that you didn't think offsetting your 2018 campaign's carbon footprint was something worthwhile. It is amazing how much air travel and Ubers your campaign needed for a campaign in NYC.  It's OK we know you would rather spend $ on a new iPhone that carbon offsets.
@AOC @desusnice @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Lots of double standards in DC.  Like how about how you want everyone else to reduce carbon emissions and be Net-Zero.  But when it come to offsetting your campaign's emissions it's no can do.  I guess getting a new iPhone is more important than being Net-Zero.
@saikatc @Slate Unfortunately the @justicedems &amp; @AOC camp has blinders on re: the GND.  GND has no real policy details yet they think it has been validated.  Realty is the @AOC campaign won't address it's own carbon emissions and clearly won't walk the talk of the GND when it affects their $.
@justicedems @AOC @SenMarkey Real, meaningful climate legislation should be backed up by actions.  Too bad @AOC, @SenMarkey, and @justicedems feel they don't need to be Net-Zero emissions, offset their emissions and be Carbon-Neutral. Walk the talk - lead by example.
@saikatc Until members of Congress start offsetting their own campaign's carbon footprint they really have no foundation to ask for others to change.  It's a shame that hypocrisy is acceptable.
@brianschatz How about politicians offset their campaign's carbon emissions.  Leading by example is always good form.  If that doesn't work maybe we could bottle up all the cow farts and send them in a rocket aimed at the sun - @elonmusk can you help us do it?
@sunrisemvmt Anyone know any kids in NY or DC that we could hire to go to @AOC office and ask her why she did not run a Carbon-Neutral campaign?  It's her goal to have Net-Zero emissions but she did not offset her own campaign.  Crazy world we live in.
@DanRiffle Everyone needs to make sacrifices when we have big issues like Climate Change.  Sad to hear that @AOC is not offsetting her campaign's carbon footprint or operating in a LEED certified building in NYC. Good thing the weed bar is still fully stocked in the break room - priorities.
@nowthisnews @justicedems Anyone know any kids in NY or DC that we could hire to go to @AOC office and ask her why she did not run a Carbon-Neutral campaign?  It's her goal to have Net-Zero emissions but she did not offset her own campaign.  Crazy world we live in.
@wlawren90 @justicedems They understand but won't spend their own $ to offset carbon emissions.  Sad that GND poster child and @justicedems pawn @AOC didn't offset her own 2018 campaign's carbon emissions.  Would have been well worth the $ to lead by example.
@davidhogg111 @SenFeinstein Anyone know any kids in NY or DC that we could hire to go to @AOC office and ask her why she did not run a Carbon-Neutral campaign?  It's her goal to have Net-Zero emissions but she did not offset her own campaign.  Crazy world we live in.

@cmclymer @AOC A good first step is to have politicians run Carbon-Neutral campaigns.  Not even @AOC cares enough about Climate Change to achieve her own goal of Net-Zero emissions for her campaign.  They need to walk the talk and lead by example.
@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Ouch!  Hey kids we feel your pain.  We have been asking our elected leaders to offset their campaign's carbon emissions and we get the same response you did.  Even from proponents of the GND!  Keep up the fight, maybe one day they will walk the talk and lead by example.
@justicedems Perhaps 2050 is a more feasible target.  It's not like anyone running for Congress actually offsets their campaign's emissions.  What about PACs like Justice Democrats?  Do ya'll measure and offset your carbon emissions - or is it a problem for everyone else to fix?
@AOC @AOC - So up here in the cheap seats we have been shouting that our elected leaders should walk the talk and lead by example.  Get to Net-Zero emissions by offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint.  Makes sense right?  We can help you measure your emissions and offset them.
@AOC We have noticed that you seem to be pinching pennies when it comes to offsetting your office's carbon footprint. Although we like what you are doing by paying a solid wage we also hope that you can lead by example vis-a-vis Climate Change and get to Net-Zero emissions via offsets
@UCSUSA GHG's are non-discriminatory.  Even the carbon emissions from the most vocal Congressional leader contribute to global warming.  We are working with our leaders to get them to lead by example and offset their campaign's emissions.  Help spread the word.
@AOC Common sense would be to offset your campaign's carbon footprint or green house gases.  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  We can help you measure and offset so your campaign can get to Net-Zero.		https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@justicedems @AOC Goal #1 - Net-Zero Green House Gas Emissions		Nice goal.  Now how about we get all the members of Congress to offset their GHG Emissions that are created by their campaigns.		It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Yes even @AOC		We can help - https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@amyklobuchar So can we count on you to lead by example and offset your campaign's carbon footprint?  America responds to action.  We can help you measure and offset your travel and other activities that lead to carbon emissions.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Maybe you could show him how serious you are about Climate Change by offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint.  Actions speak louder than words.  If you walk the talk others will follow. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC @yayitsrob Perhaps you should of offset your 2018 campaign's carbon footprint and selected a NY office in an energy efficient building.  Actions are loud.  Your words and retweets are just fluff and delegitimize a serious issue.  Walk the talk. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC Meanwhile is real life you still won't offset your campaign's carbon footprint or operate your NY office in a LEED certified energy efficient building.  So why not follow some of the key principles of the GND?  Walk the talk sister.
@RepBobbyRush @HouseDemocrats So your saying there is a chance that all @HouseDemocrats will start to measure and offset their campaign's carbon footprint?  Who will be the first to do it?  Who will spend campaign funds on carbon offsets to run a Net-Zero emissions campaign?
@KamalaHarris We sure hope you are backing up the Climate Change talk with some action.  Is your 2020 campaign going to be offsetting it's carbon footprint?  Purchasing carbon offsets with your campaign funds might sting a bit but maybe approve it after your morning blunt.
@saikatc Unfortunately much of the GND will be written off as babble and rhetoric. Actions speak louder than words. When the backers of the GND fail to offset carbon emissions and run offices in inefficient buildings the hypocrisy drowns all aspiration.
@RoKhanna Just like every other member of Congress.  All talk and no action.  But it's not too late to measure and offset your 2018 campaign's carbon footprint.  Walk the talk and lead by example - others will follow. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC Amazon is working hard to reduce carbon emissions. @AOC campaign - not so much.  Walk the talk and offset your carbon footprint.  Lead by example.		https://t.co/Semh8wRXrL
@AOC Amazon is working harder than @AOC to reduce emissions and get to Net-Zero carbon emissions.		https://t.co/tiKeKBsa8P
@AOC Hey @AOC, So your foe Amazon is actively working to reduce carbon emissions and working towards having all their shipments be Carbon-Neutral.  Seems like they are working towards your Net-Zero goal more than you are.  Where are the offsets for your 2018 campaign? Walk the talk.
@AOC It's almost like someone pointed out the hypocrisy of your GND Net-Zero emissions goal when your campaign didn't even offset any of airfares, buses, or hundreds of Uber/Lyft fares. Ooops did we just do that...  Any way how about you walk the talk and lead by example. Offset Baby!
@BernieSanders When you say the U.S. must lead the world that must exclude you right?  Cause we have yet to see you commit to offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint.  Walk the talk Bernie.  The world deserves it. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@BernieSanders Hey Bernie, Can we count on you to offset your campaign's carbon footprint?  Just keep track of your air travel, cars, buses, etc and we can help you do the rest.  Your political campaign should not contribute to global warming.  Walk the talk and offset.
@charliekirk11 We want all the 2020 candidates to measure and offset their carbon footprint.		These leaders need to walk the talk.  Please follow and RT and spread the word.		https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@CTEnvironment @SenBlumenthal The best first step towards Net-Zero emissions is to get politicians like @SenBlumenthal to measure and offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  America responds to leaders that lead by example.  Time to walk the talk.  We can help you do it. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWhitehouse @RI_CRMC @CranstonLibrary Imagine the response of the American public if our leaders like @SenWhtehouse would measure and offset their political campaign's carbon footprint.  It would show that they are actually concerned enough to spend campaign funds. Best $ ever spent. Walk the talk - lead by example.
@SenFeinstein How about a program to educate and train members of Congress on how they can and should measure and offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  If our leaders lead by example others would follow.  Why not walk the talk. We can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@RoKhanna As long as political candidates are not required to follow the same policies-right? How many 2018 political campaigns offset their carbon footprint?  How many members of Congress seek to operate their home state offices in LEED certified buildings. Lead by example, walk the talk.
@amyklobuchar So on the first day of your campaign did you also start documenting your campaign's carbon footprint so it can be offset?  Seems like a great first step for a candidate that is committed to fighting Climate Change. We can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@saikatc 10 years is ambitious for sure.  What is the timeline for political campaigns and members of Congress to offset their carbon footprint and have offices in energy efficient buildings.  Is the target 9 years 11 months and 30 days. Leaders should lead - right?
@saikatc We think it's Climate Change.  Then a close second is Hypocrisy.
@RoKhanna Climate Change is everyone's problem including our political leaders.  First step towards wide spread change is to have our leaders (like you @RoKhanna ) offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  Walk the talk and lead by example and others will follow.
@HillaryClinton @HillaryClinton we appreciate your concern for Climate Change but it does seem like just lip service when your pledge to offset your 2016 campaign's carbon footprint fell short.  Everyone needs to walk the talk and lead by example.  That is what leaders do.
@AOC More like,		@AOC - Everyone needs to reduce and offset carbon emissions.  This is urgent - we need to get to Net-Zero emissions.		Earth: So you offset your campaign's carbon emissions - right?		@AOC - No, but you see we have limited funds and I needed a new iPhone.		Earth: Oh 😢
@saikatc @JohnDelaney One way to backup your "urgent action on climate" statement might be to run a political campaign that is Carbon-Neutral or Net-Zero emissions.  Seems like an easy way to lead by example. Can you disclose @AOC campaign's carbon footprint and your steps to make it neutral/net-zero?
@davidhogg111 Hey @davidhogg111 - We are trying to get our leaders in Congress to lead by example and offset their carbon footprint of their campaigns.  America responds to actions.  Help us spread the word.  https://t.co/Y1qOsaLXNS
@KamalaHarris An imminent threat requires immediate action by everyone.  Please lead by example and offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  We can help you.  Walk the talk and others will follow.  https://t.co/Y1qOsaLXNS
@BeachyRhode @SenWhitehouse @SenateGOP Beachy Rhode-We hope you don't think we are attacking our leaders by asking them to offset their carbon footprint.  The goal is to have them lead by example. Leaders that are the most vocal proponents of reducing carbon emissions would be the ones to do so.  We want to help them.
@SenWhitehouse So about offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint... Oh forgot you were all talk.  Lead by example and offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  Walk the talk @SenWhitehouse
@IlhanMN Great sentiment.  However, both @AOC and @IlhanMN fail to see the urgency to offset their own campaign's carbon footprint.  It's all talk and no walk. https://t.co/Y1qOsaLXNS
@RepAdamSmith Would you say that #ActOnClimate would include offsetting your own campaign's carbon footprint?  Seems like most politicians are more talk than walk.  Ever try leading by example? It works.
@SierraClub @SenWhitehouse @senatemajldr @SenWhitehouse has a plan.  It just does not involve him offsetting his own campaign's carbon footprint.  Some leaders want to lead by example... Others just pass the buck and tell everyone else what to do.  Walk the talk.  Lead by example.  Offset your carbon footprint Senator.
@AOC @guardian @AOC is all talk.  If she cared about Climate Change  and believed that Net-Zero emissions would help slow global warming she would have offset her own campaign's carbon footprint.  Instead she got a new iPhone.  @AOC are these the GND priorities? iPhones over the Earth?
@CongressmanJVD Jeff you make some good points but you know what a great first step would be.  What if every congressional political campaign offset it's carbon footprint.  America responds to actions and leading by example.  Walk the talk and offset now.
@RepJimmyGomez Hey Jimmy, we think Climate Change is an emergency too.  Problem is that we are finding it difficult to locate any congressional political campaigns that felt the same way.  Why don't any campaigns offset their carbon footprint?  Will you do it. Walk the talk and lead by example.
@SenWhitehouse @SenateGOP We love your talk.  Now it's time to walk the talk.  How many politicians offset their campaign's carbon footprint?  Why not lead by example?  Wouldn't it be great to know that your political campaign did not contribute to Climate Change?  Think about it @SenWhitehouse
@amyklobuchar Keep track of all that campaign travel so you can offset your carbon footprint.  That is if you want to lead by example to fight Climate Change.  Your political campaign should not harm the earth.  We think Amy will walk the talk (maybe?)!
@RealSaavedra She is a real believer in the GND except the part about Net-Zero carbon emissions.  Has she ever offset her campaign's carbon emissions?  If she really cared why would she not offset her carbon footprint?  Walk the talk.  Lead by example @KamalaHarris
@IlhanMN We don't really believe you that you think Climate Change is a #NationalEmergency - if it was you would have certainly offset your campaign's carbon footprint.  When did leading by example become uncool?  Walk the talk @IlhanMN How are you getting to Net-Zero?
@AOC Sounds like something you said regarding offsetting the @AOC campaign's carbon footprint. 		“I didn’t need to do this” @AOC says about purchasing carbon offset credits instead of an iPhone.		“I didn’t need to do this” means your commitment to fighting Climate Change is not 100%.
@KamalaHarris Climate Change is an emergency.  Yet very few if any politicians ever offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  It's a trade off between more campaign yard signs and purchasing carbon offsets.  Yard signs win again.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@amyklobuchar He just doesn't get it.  Politicians make lots of promises and statements they really don't mean or intend to follow.  Like all the politicians that say Climate Change and reduced carbon emissions are so important but then they don't even offset their own campaigns footprint.
@Ilhan If Climate Change is important to you why did you not offset your campaign's carbon footprint?  It seems like an easy first step.  When did leading by example become uncool?  Walk the talk.
@AOC Says the congresswomen that won't offset her campaign's carbon footprint or open her NY office in a LEED certified energy efficient building.  Both key goals of the GND.  Walk the talk.  When did leading by example become so uncool?
@saikatc Two of the goals of the GND are Net-Zero emissions and Energy Efficient Buildings - right?  So why is it that the 2018 @AOC campaign was not Net-Zero (aka Carbon-Neutral) and the NY office is not in a LEED certified building.  Isn't that your bailiwick?  Walk the talk.
@thehill Hey Pramila - We can see that Climate Change is very important to you.  But just not important enough for your campaign to offset it's carbon footprint though.  We understand it would mean less yard signs but isn't the Earth worth it?  Walk the talk.  Lead by example.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Hey Alyssa, we really like your enthusiasm for Climate Change.  But how about you show them who's the boss and offset your carbon footprint by purchasing carbon offset credits.  Lead by example.  We can help you do it. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@PeteButtigieg Pete, maybe you could be the first candidate to offset their campaign's carbon footprint.  Why not lead by example and walk the talk.  Think about it.  We can help you.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@RoKhanna Climate Change is a national emergency.  Everyone should be doing their part.  However, you don't quite see it that way as your campaign will not offset it's carbon footprint to be Net-Zero or Carbon-Neutral.  Why is that Ro? Walk the talk. Lead by example.  Really - Just Do It.
@AOC @sunrisemvmt Nothing says environmental like jetting around the country promoting the concept of reducing carbon emissions.  Will this campaign be Net-Zero emissions or Carbon-Neutral?  Lead by example and walk the talk. Hypocrisy is so uncool. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@saikatc Exactly.  Like when an organization is looking for office space.  They should now look for LEED certified buildings that are highly energy efficient.  The rent may be more but it's the long term goal that is important.  @AOC's NY office for example - is it LEED certified?
@SenMarkey @RepDebDingell We learned about Climate Change in school.  We learned that market based approaches like purchasing carbon offset credits is an effective way to cut &amp; reduce total emissions.  Have you thought about leading by example and offsetting your campaigns carbon footprint?
@saikatc Howard Schultz &amp; Starbucks are advocates for the Climate Change issue.  They have actively addressed many fronts to reduce emissions and decrease energy consumption while embracing renewable energy.		Where is the carbon footprint report for the @AOC campaign?		Lead by example.
@justicedems @AOC Perhaps you could start by asking candidates to run Carbon-Neutral campaigns and offices. Net-Zero emissions and energy efficient buildings are the foundation of the GND.  You can offset your carbon emissions now and have offices in LEED certified buildings. Yet no one does.  SAD
@amyklobuchar Any chance your campaign will be offsetting it's carbon footprint?  Net-Zero or Carbon-Neutral what ever you want to call it your campaign should not contribute to Climate Change.  It's time to walk the talk.  Lead by example and offset.  We can help you get it done.
@RoKhanna And yet your political campaign's carbon footprint is not important enough to offset?  @RoKhanna - it's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Otherwise your just talk and no action.  Don't be that guy.
@SenMarkey What would be great is if you could show that you indeed care about Climate Change and carbon emissions by offsetting your campaigns carbon emissions.  Lead by example.  Walk the talk. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC So when you fly to PR do you offset that carbon emission/footprint by purchasing a carbon offset?  How about other flights, Ubers, shipping, etc.  Why not lead by example?   It's time to walk the talk - run a Carbon-Neutral campaign and office.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC Hey @AOC, actions speak louder than words.  Maybe if you ran a Carbon-Neutral campaign and opened your NY office in a LEED certified building people would follow your lead.  It's time to walk the talk. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@AOC Have you ever thought that running Carbon-Neutral campaigns and offices might show that you are serious about this issue?  Sure, it won't move the needle but you should lead by example then everyone follows suit and that will move the needle. Think about it.
@amyklobuchar Will your campaign be Carbon-Neutral?  By purchasing carbon offset credits you can get to net-zero.  Walk the talk.  Lead by example.  We can help.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWhitehouse @SenWhitehouse - Wouldn't it be great to be able to walk into any meeting or hearing knowing that you walk the talk?  By making a statement and offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint you would show your dedication and concern for this issue. Why won't you?
@RepJimmyPanetta A wonderful first step would be that everyone cosponsoring the GND would pledge (and actually do it) to run Carbon-Neutral political campaigns.  Walk the talk.  Lead by example. We can help.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@RoKhanna So about your campaign's carbon footprint.  Will you be offsetting that so that your campaign is net-zero?  Your offices are in buildings that are LEED certified - right?  Walk the talk.  Lead by example.  We can help.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@tedlieu @RepGraceMeng @RepHoulahan @RepDarrenSoto @RepThompson Hey Ted - We would like to highlight a successful campaign that has been run Carbon-Neutral.  Can you share how you ran your campaign and how you measured and purchased carbon offsets to become Carbon-Neutral.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@BernieSanders Bernie, Bernie, Bernie chants the crowd... Now Senator be even bolder and offset your campaign's carbon footprint and become Carbon-Neutral.  Can you imagine the results when America observes it's leaders - leading by example.  Walk the talk Bernie.  https://t.co/DVBBxXMcuN
@SenWhitehouse @EndPlasticWaste People can do wonderful things.  Just think if every political campaign for the last 20 years was Carbon-Neutral.  Everyone would follow this example and offset their carbon footprint.  Senator, it's time to walk the talk. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWhitehouse Hey Sheldon, do you need some help running your campaign and offices Carbon-Neutral? Seems like that would something you would like to do.  We can help.  https://t.co/DVBBxY3Nml
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @BarackObama Sen Whitehouse, you know what might actually draw some attention to this issue.  What if every member of congress that believes in the climate change issue would offset their campaigns carbon footprint.  Actions are loud.  Walk the talk.  Lead by example.
@RepAdamSmith We hope that you will run a Carbon-Neutral campaign.  Americans respond well to leaders who lead by example.  Walk the talk and offset your carbon footprint. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@amyklobuchar @realDonaldTrump So before someone donates to your campaign shouldn't they know that their donation won't increase the level of CO2.  Will your campaign be Carbon-Neutral?

@saikatc @ChrisMurphyCT It is also realistic for @ChrisMurphyCT to run a Carbon-Neutral campaign by purchasing carbon offsets yet for some reason this just doesn't happen.  Walk the talk, lead by example.  Maybe even drink the Kool aid before you serve it to America. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenGillibrand @AOC @SenMarkey We really hope you step up and run a Carbon-Neutral 2020 campaign.  America respects politicians that back up the talk with actions.  Walk the talk and lead by example. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWarren @AOC @RepAOC @SenMarkey How about running a Carbon-Neutral campaign?  By offsetting your campaigns carbon footprint you show America that you actually care about the problem and show that it is everyone's problem to fix.  Walk the talk and lead by example. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@saikatc As long as there are exemptions for political campaigns and politicians - right?  It would be refreshing to see a Carbon-Neutral campaign.  Walk the talk and lead by example.
@AOC We are glad you are on board but concerned since your campaign was not Carbon-Neutral.  Offsetting you campaigns carbon footprint and having your office in a LEED certified building align with your GND goals right?  We can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@amyklobuchar Will your 2020 campaign be Carbon-Neutral?  Asking for a friend (well actually the earth).  It does not take much to walk the talk and lead by example.  We can help you. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@RepThomasMassie We are working to get all the GND sponsors to lead by example and walk the talk.  That is they should be running Carbon-Neutral campaigns and also making sure their home state offices are in LEED certified buildings.  All good things they support - right? Help spread the word.
@RepJoeNeguse Hey Joe, it's is true that Climate Change is a real threat.  So can you help us help you by offsetting your campaign's carbon footprint?  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example. Lets have a conversation. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@saikatc Maybe the best pivot might be to refocus @AOC's attention to real actions to combat climate change.  Step 1 would be to get the 2018 campaign Carbon-Neutral.  Step 2 would be to have your NY office in a LEED certified building.  Walk the talk, lead by example.  We can help you.
@KamalaHarris Dear Kamala, you seem to be genuinely concerned with the issue of climate change.  Yet you don't seem to offset your campaigns carbon footprint or operate your offices in a Carbon-Neutral manner.  Please walk the talk and lead by example.  Actions tower over words.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President please help us in working with the Members of Congress to ensure that they offset their campaign's carbon footprint and operate their offices as Carbon-Neutral.  We want them to walk the talk and lead by example. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@RoKhanna Hey Ro, still waiting for you to walk the talk and offset your carbon footprint.  It just makes sense that you would - right?  And your CA office - it's in a LEED certified building too - right? Lead by example - offset your campaign's carbon footprint. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@SenWarren @WellsFargo When most people lie on college applications about their race to get admitted or better scholarships and get busted they loose their scholarship and admission.  When you lie about your race you just keep bumbling along. That's a rigged system.
@RepHuffman Hey Jared, can your help us find out who of these nearly 60 Members of Congress walk the talk and run carbon-neutral campaigns. Actions speak louder than words and offsetting your campaigns carbon footprint would show you really care about climate change and not just a few votes.
@saikatc So is there any chance at all that @AOC will lead by example and walk the talk.  Running Carbon Neutral campaigns and congressional offices should be easy.  We can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@brithume What do you think the chances are that any of these 2020 campaigns will be Carbon Neutral?  You would think that they would lead by example and walk the talk.  However, it seems that more ads, buttons, and yard signs are better for planet Earth.
@seanhannity Hey Sean - here's the deal.  You would think that @AOC would run a Carbon Neutral campaign - right?  We want to help them do this.  They should walk the talk and lead by example.  Help us spread the word. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress @AOC - just one question.  What is more important to you - a new iPhone or purchasing carbon offset credits for your campaign?  We think we know from looking at your FEC reports but please answer.  Let us help you. Walk the talk. Lead by example. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@NPRinskeep @NPR @AOC @MorningEdition @aoc - Step 1 - make sure your campaign is carbon neutral by purchasing offsets for your carbon footprint.  Step 2 - make sure you lease office space in a LEED certified building.  Call us when you need Step 3. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@IngrahamAngle Hey Laura, we have been trying very hard to find them but we don't think any of the 60 Cosponsors of the #GreenNewDeal run Carbon Neutral campaigns. We want to get them to walk the talk. Can you help?  They should lead by example. Contact us. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@RepAOC @SenMarkey Hey @AOC, can you help us.  We think that these 60 Cosponsors would like to show that their campaigns are Carbon Neutral.  All the airfare, shipping, Ubers, etc can be easily offset.  Let's work together so you can walk the talk and lead by example.
@RepJoeKennedy @SenMarkey @RepAOC Hey JK3, glad you are on board.  Now can we work to get your campaign Carbon Neutral.  Americans see actions loud and clear.  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Let's talk - we can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@RepCarbajal @HouseDemocrats We sure like that Climate Change was number 1.  Better yet would be if we could get our elected officials to run Carbon Neutral campaigns.  Lead by example and walk the talk.  We can help.  https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@politico @RepJoeNeguse Actions speak louder than words.  You need to wonder when @AOC has the campaign funds available for a new iPhone but unable to offset the campaign carbon footprint.  True colors.  Lead by example and walk the talk. Hey @AOC we can help. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@chelliepingree Words have so much more meaning when they are backed by actions.  Lead by example and offset your campaigns carbon footprint.  A Carbon Neutral campaign should be the standard.  Walk the talk. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs

@Ilhan So it seems you have concern about climate change.  But do you care enough to run a Carbon Neutral campaign? We can't seem to find any carbon offset purchases from your FEC reports. Can you help us help you to make your campaign Carbon Neutral. Lead by example and walk the talk.
@amyklobuchar We hope it will be a Carbon Neutral 2020 campaign!  Lead by example and walk the talk.
@OscarTRamirez @AOC @JoeNeguse @JoaquinCastrotx @PramilaJayapal @RepYvetteClarke @AyannaPressley @tedlieu @RoKhanna @RepBrendanBoyle That is cool!  What would be even better...  How about if all of these people's 2018 campaigns were Carbon Neutral.  It does not take much to lead by example and walk the talk.  Help us help you and the world. https://t.co/Y1qOsb3zcs
@brianschatz We could limit the flights to/from Hawaii... not so good for HI. Or maybe offset those emissions with carbon offsets.  Is your campaign Carbon Neutral?  It would not cost much to lead by example and walk the talk.
@brianschatz Now that does not sound very fun!  But we could drink every time a member of Congress purchases a carbon offset for their campaign to be Carbon Neutral.  Unfortunately we would probably only need a six pack.  Can you help us and lead by example and walk the talk?

@AOC Please help us confirm that your 2018 campaign was Carbon Neutral.  We have gone through the FEC expense reports but can't find any known Carbon Offset providers.  It's time to walk the talk and lead by example.  Let's get everyone on-board and reducing CO2.
@AOC @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt Love it!  Now @AOC can you help us find your campaigns Carbon Offset purchases?  Checking the FEC reports shows lots of airline travel and Uber fares but we don't see any purchases for any offsets.  Please lead by example.  Global warming is everyone's problem.
