This Committee is still, and always will be, bipartisan. We apologize for any confusion the name change has caused. Please feel free to call 202-225-3527 with any additional questions.

Thus, this account is no longer a reflection of the Committee at large, but rather the official Twitter account for the Committee‚Äôs Republican Minority.
