This strategy is not limited to nat'l politics either. I see evidence of it in other states too.  	There was an obvious GØP power grab in #NorthCarolina evidenced by the lame duck legislative actions of adding amendments to the #NC constitution one of which limited voting rights. https://t.co/aWRufw7VdI
❓Why does the GØP continue to support him? 	Either 1) they want to complete their own agenda, 2) they are complicit with Russia, or both. 	The GØP seeks power and 💰 which are synonymous to them.	And, they are riding this TR☭MP 🚂 as long and as far as they possibly can. 2/3
🔥Of course, Tr☭mp is trashing US Intelligence. His very 'presidency' is a sham, a fraud. All intelligence agencies agree Russia 'interfered' in the 2016 election. Therefore, to his mind, everyone else is wrong and his 'perception' of reality has become his reality. 1/3 https://t.co/0eVLmIioQw

🔖3. Learn more. Join us for our next Indivisible National Call on January 10 at 8pm ET/ 5pm PT to find out what’s coming up next during these #100Days!	https://t.co/pW4QUvkXRP	10/11
⭐️2. Don’t have an event near you? Call and tell your MoCs to end the #TrumpShutdown. The GOP-controlled Congress gave into Trump’s tantrum in the final days of 2018, &amp; now it’s time for the new Congress to fix the mess that Trump and the GOP created.	https://t.co/QAV3knbpkv	9/11
Our agenda:	👊🏼1. Show up. Find a day of action event near you on our map. Get your new Whose House, Our House! gear, gather your friends, and tell your MoCs to end the #TrumpShutdown. 	https://t.co/EZDZUMyOln	8/11
Tomorrow is a HUGE day. And we’re ready to start 2019 off with a bang! 7/11 https://t.co/twquEm4y23
Meanwhile, #Indivisibles all over the country will start their day off at district offices and rallies to welcome their new MoC's and remind them of the blue wave that voted them into power. 	https://t.co/EZDZUMyOln	6/11
One of the first votes they’ll take will be to end the #TrumpShutdown. The previous Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass a clean continuing resolution and partially shut the government down on December 22. 5/11
And MoC's are sworn in, they’ll vote on the rules of the House, which will govern House procedure over the next two years. Then they’ll begin what is their most important job: responding to the needs of our country. 4/11
New House members will go to their new offices, settle in, and begin their time in Congress with important votes. They’ll vote to elect the next the Speaker of the House, @NancyPelosi  3/11
Tomorrow morning, January 3, 2019, our new members of Congress (MoC's) will be sworn into the 116th Congress. It is an enormous honor and responsibility to serve in Congress, one that very few people ever get to experience. 2/11
[Thread] 	Huge day tomorrow, huge year for all of us who worked so hard to make the #BlueWave a reality. 	We ARE the change we seek. 	Congratulations are in order! 	Take a moment to pat yourself on the back. 	Then we get back to work to #DefendOurDemocracy! 1/11 https://t.co/4eM5t16DdX
