@TheBluesMan361 @RareCamellia @Steffi_Cole Parties generally give overt preference in primaries to incumbents up for reelection (incl. Massie, Amash) because incmbts have an edge in general elections. It keeps serious challengers out of the race so red-district reps don't have to fight to keep their seats.
@RareCamellia @Steffi_Cole @TheBluesMan361 I think it should be handled on the party side. GOP could cut off automatic endorsement for incumbents after 4 or 5 terms. They can still run, but have to compete in a fair open primary w/o party funding.

@Riley_Fowler13 @morganisawizard I am pro-life. What I'm saying is, we've gotta be incremental and talk about issues that people (aside from libertarians) care about. Most people don't give a damn about legal prostitution, and we'll never attract anybody to the cause if we make that issue front-and-center.
@morganisawizard ...like abortion, taxes, wasteful government spending, gun rights, criminal justice reform, marijuana, etc. Avoid the more "out-there" topics, that will come in time. Complete liberty will not be achieved overnight, just gotta keep pushing a little more in the right direction.
@morganisawizard I think her point is to focus on issues that people actually care about. If libertarians continue to jump right into prostitution, hard drugs, abolishing drivers licenses, and the like, people will continue to brush us off as nutjobs. Focus instead on mainstream issues...

@CollectivzdPaki @stanford_garey @NoMoSocialism75 @19Jackson90 @JediPrincess38 @Lap_Dancer_ American slang for northerners. Foreigners use it to refer to all Americans, from what I hear.
@CollectivzdPaki @NoMoSocialism75 @19Jackson90 @JediPrincess38 @stanford_garey @Lap_Dancer_ Because it was kind of a new idea at the time and everyone was used to mercantilism.

@NoMoSocialism75 @CollectivzdPaki @19Jackson90 @JediPrincess38 @stanford_garey @Lap_Dancer_ Most did just out of loyalty to their state/defense of their homeland.

Just as many supported Russian revolution because they wanted change &amp; freedom from tsar, not because they wanted communism.
@CollectivzdPaki @NoMoSocialism75 @JediPrincess38 @stanford_garey @Lap_Dancer_ @19Jackson90 Many people supported revolution against the oppressive tsar and feudalism. Doesn't mean they supported the bolshiveks who brought tyranny just as bad if not worse.

@stanford_garey @NoMoSocialism75 @Lap_Dancer_ @CollectivzdPaki @19Jackson90 Even if we cut the budget to pre-9/11 levels, we could eliminate the income tax without increasing the deficit. Were we living in a desolate 3rd world wasteland with no infrastructure in Y2K?

@AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic Romney (sitting Senator and former GOP nominee) would make things more interesting probably. 		Sasse would be even more interesting, challenging him from the right, like Reagan and Buchanan to Ford and Bush. Trump's popularity among Republicans would have to plummet first though
@AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic Trump is polling &gt;80% in Iowa and around 90% nationally (primary). Weld was a governor who has been out of office for over 20 years (think Gilmore, Pataki). He also left the GOP and endorsed Obama. He won't poll above 5%, will drop out early, won't be a significant factor.

@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty That would be a great way to turn mainstream Republicans against libertarianism. Tea Party wave was caused by disappointment with the "big government conservatism" of Bush &amp; Co. Not by the GOP losing an election.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty The GOP establishment hates libertarians precisely because they blame (or anticipate) the LP for costing them elections.	Cooperation between GOP and LP to defeat socialism would be better for everyone.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty Not if there's no Republican in the race. He'd get 20% minimum, and would have a much better shot at actually winning that than the Presidency.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty There's no Libertarian with the name recognition &amp; fundraising capability to be elected president. Why? Because there are no Libertarian Senators, Governors, or congressmen. Why? Because there are only like 6 Libertarian state legislators in the whole country. Start local.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty 5% in an unwinnable Presidential race is better than a seat in congress? This is why Libertarians don't win things. Priorities.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC @AP4Liberty On the contrary. Running against the most well known congresswoman in America (assuming he's the sole opponent, no GOP candidate) would get him a lot of media coverage and donations. Probably even a Fox News appearance at least once.
Draft @LarrySharpe to run against @AOC in 2020!		https://t.co/zdPaqBIb3j
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe @AOC Think about it this way:	- They won't vote Republican. People are tribalist/partisan, usually don't care much about the actual issues in congressional races	-Somebody who's not a Republican has a better chance, and Larry would get $$$ and media just for being her sole opponent.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe Unless they get a self-funded billionaire or sitting politician to run (someone who could actually win), they'd do less damage by just sitting out Presidential elections IMO. Gary Johnson reinforced the stereotype of libertarians as kooky potheads.
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe Once they actually get somebody elected to congress, they will be taken seriously. 		That said, @LarrySharpe should run against @AOC üòâ
@MilsurpMike @LPNational @LarrySharpe I like Larry. But nobody knows who he is aside from libertarians and New Yorkers maybe. The LP should focus their limited resources on state legislative or congressional races where only one major party has a candidate.

@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw Trump has the highest approval among black voters of any GOP president and higher than anyone except W Bush among hispanics, last I saw. People are starting to see through the lies.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw People who actually care about any of this are the vast minority. They tend to be white, upper middle class, college educated. 		The rest, normal ppl, might buy subtle SJW shit or basic repeated propaganda, but they won't buy the current outright lies that defy all reality.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw So we prove them wrong with real results, not empty pandering. Their claims of racism have reached ridiculousness and the last thing we should do is give them any justification.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw @Steve_Sailer The Democrat success in racial collectivism has largely been based on the use of past oppression as a uniting factor. classic commie tactics whether they know it or not. Gramsci's cultural marxism. There is no historical, or major present, hardship that unites white people.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw Any emphasis on whiteness just wouldn't come off well from a party already frequently accused of being "the old white guy party".
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw @Steve_Sailer It won't work. Whites are a majority and haven't historically been oppressed in the USA. White collectivism will alienate even most white people.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon @tombrokaw Right now its ridiculous enough that people see through it. But if the GOP embraces white collectivism, it won't seem so ridiculous to normal people anymore and that will backfire bigtime.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty @AudaciousEpigon The fastest growing immigrant groups are Hispanic and Asian. Neither votes as a bloc (IIRC 60/40 D and 55/45 D). Still favorable to dems but not out of reach. Good policy.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman @AP4Liberty More minority GOP candidates would help. But above all, results. Bring jobs back to the minority communities. Listen to their concerns &amp; integrate those ideas into the platform.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman (2/2) The best way to combat this is to get the truth out and produce meaningful results for these communities as Prez Trump has done. He has record high approval among both groups as a result. The dem coalition is cracking.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman That's a misrepresentation. The majority of the 90% black &amp; 60% hispanic who vote Democrat don't hate whites. They've been lied to that Republicans are racist and Dems have their best interest in mind by MSM, public ed, etc. (1/2)
@HowardSchultz I suggest you google Duverger's law. Three parties can't succeed long term the way our election system is set up.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman Breaking the left's collectivist blocs is a better strategy long term than trying to build our own. The likely result of a party built on white collectivism is not something anyone wants to see.
@Str8DonLemon @GOP @GOPChairwoman Please don't. This will fuel the left's attacks of "racism" and further alienate voters of all races, including white. Identity politics is the left's game &amp; the ppl who fall for it would never vote GOP anyway.

@Miss_Violet2014 @LibertyCliff And what did we gain? $5 Trillion in debt, an expensive extra layer of bureaucracy over existing federal agencies, infringements on our 4th amendment rights, and unnecessary military spending that won't be reversed because politics. Then Obama came &amp; spent twice as much.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Whatever we're paying for obviously isn't gaining us much long-term. Bush spent more money than every president from Van Buren to Clinton combined. Still waiting to see the long-term payout from that...
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Then HS-educated can't compete for jobs, 4-yr degree becomes the standard, and masters or more advanced degrees are required to compete for the "good" jobs. Keep this up and we'll all be in school until we're 30.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Economic fallacy. The economy is not a zero-sum game. Value is created on both sides of every transaction. Despite growing divide between rich and poor, America's poor have become richer and are among the wealthiest 1/3 of the world.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump New jobs will be created that we can't forsee yet, as always happens when new technologies are developed.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump If we cut the budget to pre-9/11 levels, all income tax revenue is surplus. Debt is paid off within a couple decades. Were we living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with no bridges in 2000? We've been "doing things" too much for 20 years.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Let the "market" decide. If students want it, they'll take it. If they don't they won't. Tax break or not we can't afford sh*t. $22 Trillion in debt. Paying that off needs to come before we think about building anything or sending anyone to free college.
@lolitscharlie @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Public schools are looking out for their funding. They won't allow anything that would get them bad publicity or negative gov't attention. In my school there weren't many teachers who were open about their religion, in a part of the country where there's a church on every street
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump They cancelled Economics in my school because no one except me signed up to take it. I reckon religious classes would be created/cancelled the same way.
@KickinBrass1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump No, Missouri.
@lolitscharlie @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This isn't true. Even here in "garbage bodunk" "flyover country" that y'all like to hate on so much, the public schools are pretty liberal. Maybe one or two isolated cases.
@Miss_Violet2014 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump They will exist if there is sufficient demand among the students and teachers willing to teach them.
@KickinBrass1 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump That's not true. There's plenty wrong being taught in public school, but we were not taught Sharia (at least not circa 2011). We were simply taught the differences btwn Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and the history of each.
@RenAngsty @mikeso3691 @realDonaldTrump The President, in his capacity as an individual or his campaign, has the freedom of speech to promote it.  On an official Presidential letterhead or the @POTUS twitter account that would be different.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Sure, why not? As long as it's completely optional and students aren't pressured to take it / put in the class without explicitly saying they want to take it.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump How so? It's not establishing a national religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. As I understand, it's only making this an optional elective in schools. (for the record, yes, I'd be completely fine with similar Torah, Quaran, etc classes).

@WichitaCindy @BryanLowry3 @GregOrman I forget his name but I remember seeing his ads. I reckon if he really wants to be a Senator, now is his chance without a same-party incumbent to run against.
@WichitaCindy @BryanLowry3 @GregOrman Not Orman, the doctor who challenged Roberts in the GOP primary.
@WichitaCindy @BryanLowry3 Maybe, but with the GOP Senate majority at risk, why even take the chance on a guy who just lost statewide in a state where 44% of voters are registered Republican? Obviously not the smartest candidate to run. He needs to stay out.
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash That's the power of gerrymandering... how AOC got in office too. They'll vote for literally anyone with a D next to their name.

@Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @repedvillegas @realDonaldTrump @justinamash From what I've gathered he's firmly against the big tech companies, for better or worse.
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Some people don't like him because apparently he isn't in the district much and he votes pretty establishment. It's cool to have an auctioneer in congress though.
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash If it's him vs Greitens and no one else I think no one will care and enough will be willing to just sacrifice the state to Galloway lol
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Yeah he's running for Governor now
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash I voted for him but I liked John Brunner better in the primary. Brunner is a liberty guy. Greitens seemed a little overly ambitious, like you could tell he just wanted a stepping stone to be President.
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash If Parson decides not to run and we're left to choose between Greitens and Monetti that's gonna be tough
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash He has an exploratory committee lol. He will NOT be governor but I think there's enough Republicans still butthurt about him resigning (37 percent of the population) that he might have a chance in the primary.
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash How'd they vote in the 2016 Republican primary?
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash no idea, I'm more interested to see if Chris McDaniel runs for Gov of MS and if Greitens decides to make a comeback primary bid against Parson here in MO lol
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Romney won't lose his Senate seat unless he wins the Presidency, which ain't happening lol
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash same. I remember how excited everyone was when she first got elected, first black female Republican rep.
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash I hope so, but that district voted for Hillary and suddenly all their moderate GOP state reps are switching parties to Dem. She does seem too progressive for suburban Kansas though and they might end up not liking what they voted for.
@repedvillegas @Vets4AP @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash I feel the pain. We had a GOP congressman on the Kansas side of KC who was a really great guy and pretty independent from Trump but he lost basically just for being a Republican.
@Vets4AP @repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash They should at least kick the Nazis out of the party though. It doesn't reflect well on the rest of us. Same with that pedo who ran as a Republican in Virginia- ban him from the GOP forever!

@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash yeah but statewide that hasn't seemed to workout so well. Even in deep-red Louisiana they ended up with a Democratic Governor.
@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash I disagree with Harris on just about everything, but she seems smart and well intentioned. Feinstein is just plain evil.
@Tamaraw68415067 @repedvillegas @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Lol only if he ran as a Democrat with their jungle primaries.
@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash You Californians need to start running Libertarian types as Democrats in primaries against these commies. If you emphasize the right issues (dude weed lmao) it might be a worthwhile strategy.
@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Definitely Harris. I don't like her but Dianne Feinstein is the biggest King George III wannabe alive other than maybe Eric Swallwell.

@Tamaraw68415067 @repedvillegas @realDonaldTrump @justinamash So who y'all got between Hawley and Blunt? lol. I campaigned for both in the generals. Have been disappointed with some of Blunt's votes but no way was I gonna let Kander be elected. Hawley hasn't exactly let me down yet but he's only been in there for 3 weeks.
@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash I think if the GOP nominates a hardcore neocon after Trump, it might be the ideal time for the LP to nominate a strong Republitarian like Rand Paul. Still won't win, but it would be their best opportunity. I don't see the GOP reverting to that though.
@Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash But Missouri, unlike Georgia, nearly voted for Ted Cruz in the 2016 primaries (Trump only won by 1800 votes), so I think we would have more Tea Party Cruz types who voted Trump 2016 but might switch to Amash 2020. So maybe GA goes slightly red and MO goes slightly blue.
@repedvillegas @Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Same, I hope he runs for Senate or waits until '24 to run for President as a Republican or Vice President on the ticket with Rand.
@Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash Georgia seems pretty similar to Missouri politically. Usually Red but y'all almost elected Stacy Abrams. With Amash splitting the GOP vote more than the Dem vote, both MO and GA would probably be pretty close between the R and the D.
@Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash (2/2) So I'd probably have to go for @realDonaldTrump. But, in the unexpected event that @justinamash is polling &gt;30% in Missouri, I'd be leaning towards him.
@Tamaraw68415067 @realDonaldTrump @justinamash It'd be a tough decision. Here's what I figure:		Even in a three way race with the strongest possible libertarian candidate (sitting congressman elected as a Republican, maybe with a lot of cash somehow), Missouri is most likely to vote for the Republican but could swing Dem (1/2

@Diglibertarians @LPNational @GovGaryJohnson @GOP @AP4Liberty ...but MO is not NM and Campbell isnt as well known as a former governor and two-time prez nominee. If he spoils the election, which the polls show that is a possibility (47-47 in a 2 candidate poll, 47D - 42R - 4L - 2G when L &amp; G included), the LP will be to blame for McCaskill
@Diglibertarians @LPNational @GovGaryJohnson @GOP @AP4Liberty Ok, ill give you an answer.		I'd rather see Gary win than the Democrat. But I'd probably rather see the Republican win over Gary, because Gary supports abortion and has exhibited questionable judgement (though I haven't researched the GOP guy enough to say that for sure)...
@Jeannine8Carol @MissouriGOP @clairecmc @HawleyMO Kinda what I figured since she didn't vote for Gorsuch. Would be nice if she'd be upfront about that though, so the 60% of Missourians who voted Trump in 2016 will know to vote against her!

@DaveMBP @Jack4liberty @DrRandPaul @GovGaryJohnson And encouraged people to vote against them.		The GOP doesn't have a socialist caucus (with literal communists), or dancing naked people at the convention, or anarchists, etc, and its actually a VIABLE PARTY nationwide, which the LP hasn't managed in its ~50 years of existing
@DaveMBP @Jack4liberty @DrRandPaul @GovGaryJohnson Defund PP is a step in the right direction. But would he vote for a Constitutional Amendment to guarantee the right to life to the unborn? Will he vote for SCOTUS Justices who will overturn RvW?

@DaveMBP @Jack4liberty @DrRandPaul @GovGaryJohnson ...	Would Gary be preferable to a Democrat? Yes. But I wouldn't vote for him in a 3 way race. Will have to research the GOP candidate. 		And don't forget, if Gary does get elected the first Libertarian Party Senator, he becomes the face of your party forever...

@Shawtypepelina @NoMoSocialism75 @P3D0K1ll3RZ @SiddonsDan @AP4Liberty @KyleKashuv ... its bailing out a practically insignificant industry at the expense of everyone else. Like socialism.
@Shawtypepelina @NoMoSocialism75 @P3D0K1ll3RZ @SiddonsDan @AP4Liberty @KyleKashuv Would you really rather pay 25% more for nails? This tariff might save jobs in the nail-manufacturing industry, but will kill jobs in construction and other industries that use nails b/c increased costs. It is not to the net benefit of the US economy...
@Shawtypepelina @NoMoSocialism75 @P3D0K1ll3RZ @SiddonsDan @AP4Liberty @KyleKashuv An interesting fact for your consideration: in the 1980's, we put a tariff on Japanese automobiles with the intention of saving American auto jobs.

@Shawtypepelina @NoMoSocialism75 @P3D0K1ll3RZ @SiddonsDan @AP4Liberty @KyleKashuv Charging customers 25% more is bad for American consumers, and American businesses that use the products, is it not?

@erin_crosby1 @Raker57 @KaitMarieox @KyleKashuv I didn't say it would lead to campus carry. The goal is to lower the handgun age to 18. And no sane MO lawmaker would suggest banning AR-15s or anything remotely similar.

@erin_crosby1 No, I'm suggesting that people under 21 (legal) should carry off campus (legal) to obtain the right to buy handguns. We can worry about campus carry later.
@erin_crosby1 @KaitMarieox @KyleKashuv We don't currently have campus carry. Just in general, open carry off campus/literally anywhere else. You can even carry a gun into the state capitol if you feel like it, but not on a college campus...
@erin_crosby1 @KaitMarieox @KyleKashuv "We're exercising the 2A in the only way we can under current law.

@erin_crosby1 @KaitMarieox @KyleKashuv I don't know what the laws in other states are. But, in MO, its legal to carry a rifle at 19 but you have to be 21 to buy a handgun. So we LEGALLY carry our rifles around, which will draw attention &amp; piss people off, and then we tell our lawmakers, (1/2)

@PatriotSubVet @GayRepublicSwag I can agree with this. But a wall is just a bandaid fix that will not solve the root of the problem. If we ensure 100% that illegals do not have access to welfare or public services of any kind, and make legal immigt'n easier to start (but more thorough!), they will not come.

@cbbruuno Criticizing Dr. Paul's rhetoric, "he sounds like he hates America", not actually saying that he hates America
@cbbruuno @joshtpm I have a hard time believing this, and if he did say it this is probably out of context. Need a source.
@constans @joshtpm Absolutely, 100%. And as of right now I see no reason to want Gov. Greitens out of office unless he commited a crime. I do hope that he chooses not to seek a 2nd term, because regardless of the outcone of his trial the damage has been done &amp; he cant win. Don't want Gov. Galloway
@constans @joshtpm No. I like him as a politician, but that is a different matter entirely. I support rights even for those who I disagree with, and I support fair punishment for crimes commited even by those who I agree with.
@joshtpm If Greitens turns out to be guilty in court, he should resign and be punished accordingly. No one is saying otherwise. But if he is innocent, he will stay &amp; it will make @HawleyMO , @clairecmc , the entire media and half of Missouri's politicians look like asshats. That simple.
@joshtpm I don't think he was ever part of #TeamLiberty since he donated $50K to Hawley the Chicken. We still support his rights though.
RT @AP4Liberty: @joshtpm Yes, I do. He hasn't had his day in court yet and I will do so until facts and evidence prove otherwise.
@cbbruuno @joshtpm Idk what you're talking about, he was too sane for the LP. 		Petersen: "No, you should not be able to sell heroin to a five year old"		LP crowd: *Boos*
@joshtpm Innocent until proven guilty. I, for one, support Governor Greitens until and unless the court system finds him guilty of the things he's been accused of. The MO Attorney General of all people should know better than to assume guilt before trial.
@joshtpm Great ad, thanks for helping spread the word. We of #TeamLiberty believe in due process, honesty, and we want politicians who have the guts to face their opponents &amp; constituents.
