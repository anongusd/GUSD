@somenycguy @jjjauque @Mike31385536 @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul I've learned a lot about the nitty-gritty details of SCOTUS cases and executive/legislative actions from that podcast. I disagree with their politics but I learn a ton from them.
@somenycguy @jjjauque @Mike31385536 @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul Speaking of podcasts, if you listen to those, please check out Opening Arguments. They're leftists and open about it. It's a funny guy interviewing an insanely intelligent lawyer. They're very honest when they're about to say left-leaning things, but they're so intelligent

@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul We haven't declared a war since WWII either. So as far as I'm concerned all wars since the 1940's are unconstitutional.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul Wrongfully so, and I hate every president we have had since like.. Calvin Coolidge and even he wasn't that great. He basically did nothing which was his best quality.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul No
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul WAIT are you asking if I consider it an emergency right now? Like today is it an ongoing emergency? Hell no.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul 9-11? Absolutely. That's entirely consistent with what I'm saying. Do you think I'm saying there is no such thing as an emergency? I must be doing a piss poor job of explaining myself if you think I don't believe in emergencies.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul Oh you meant 9-11. Yeah, time played a giant role in responding to that. Congress did not have time to convene, debate, and pass legislation regarding handling the situation. That's the exact example of an emergency. "Time" being the most important factor, NOT severity.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul Thankfully, legislation regarding 911 calls is specific enough that there is no question of whether you can call 911 to stop a termite infestation that might, in 5 years, result in devestating damage to your house.
@somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @Mike31385536 @RandPaul I can't figure out how to fast forward and I am way too impatient to listen to stuff about flannels and I accidentally sent a heart when I tried to skip to the stuff.
@jjjauque @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul They essentially have if SCOTUS doesn't do something about defining the word "emergency."
@RobThom02868784 @somenycguy @Mike31385536 @RandPaul "If you've been called an anarchist, a hippie, a fascist, a liberal, and a neocon, all in the same day, you're probably a libertarian" 		^my experience on Twitter lol
@somenycguy @Mike31385536 @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul I agree. I think the same of the right though. There is no left and right. There is only liberty and statism. One person's particular flavor of government tyranny is still tyranny.
@RobThom02868784 @Mike31385536 @RandPaul I'm not at all debating whether or not we should secure our borders. I'm not even debating whether we should have a wall, or whether it is POTUS' responsibility to secure those borders. I am only saying that appropriating  treasury money is not POTUS' job.
@somenycguy @Mike31385536 @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul There won't be an overall ban. Liberals are too scared to repeal 2A in at least my lifetime. However, you can effectively ban firearms by using hundreds of minor changes that amount to a massive outlawing of private ownership when put together.
@RobThom02868784 @Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RandPaul It is to people who feel opposite politically. Personally I agree that protecting our borders is something we should do, and gun control is something we shouldn't do. But I do not support the president having the ability to appropriate spending on even my favorite thing ever.
@somenycguy @Mike31385536 @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul Well what I meant was I agree that government can violate the second amendment. Trump already has in this presidency with the bump stock ban. SCOTUS has been more quiet on 2A than any other issue. The precedent was set prior to this century.
@RobThom02868784 @RandPaul You and I both know that what I meant was there is time for Congress to meet and debate and write legislation. An ICBM isn't in flight to NYC. A volcano isn't about to decimate Hawaii. There is time for legislation to be written. And it has been.
@RobThom02868784 @Mike31385536 @RandPaul Not a particular right, but a separation of power that indirectly represents the right of the people to have a voice in decision-making (through legislative representatives)
@Mike31385536 @somenycguy @RobThom02868784 @RandPaul I agree on that
@smoshersra @RandPaul "I don't care about your God damn 'shall not be infringed!' Children are dying in schools."		Limitations on power are important. We don't have Kings anymore.
@Robert99474738 @RandPaul I'm an idiot who wants to end the war on drugs and abolish the DEA and Controlled Substances Act. Come at me.
@jonnoyes2 @RandPaul Lol I've never been registered Democrat. I'm registered Libertarian and have been registered Republican twice to vote in primaries. 		And yes, it is technically legal only in the sense that Congress did not define the word "emergency" when it should have.
@RobThom02868784 @RandPaul The powers they gave unfortunately did not define the word "emergency." Interpreting that wording will have to be left to the courts now, or to clarifying legislation. But this is clearly not an emergency. Emergencies are not a function of severity, but of time. And there is time
@RandPaul All these people saying "just build the wall" would become constitutional scholars overnight if it meant explaining the legality of a similar action by a Democrat. 		Thank you, senator.

@RGdyk @iamgreat127 @RepStefanik ...time for Congress to convene and vote. Immigration is not a matter that is so urgent there is no time for a vote, as Congress has already convened and voted numerous times. It may be important, but it isn't an "emergency."
@RGdyk @iamgreat127 @RepStefanik One of the funds being drawn on can arguably be used for the wall, but the courts will have to determine the definition of "emergency" first, because the related legislation does not provide a definition. Most reasonable people would assume it means there is no.....
@RGdyk @iamgreat127 @RepStefanik The president has the power to control and execute matters related to national security by drawing upon funds already appropriated by Congress. Congress made no such appropriation for the wall. At least 2/3 of the funds being drawn on now cannot be used for a border wall.
@RGdyk @RepStefanik No, the president does not have the power to interpret legislation. Is the legislation itself does not provide a definition (in this case, it does) that is up to the judiciary.

@politcallyerect @justinamash @POTUS Since he hasn't answered, and I'm a fanboy so my guess is probably close enough to the truth to be helpful, I would bet he supports ending US policies that attract illegal immigration as a primary focus to the issue. We can end certain expenditures to lower migration. Save tons.

@XCL1233 @RepStefanik Okay well "border security is needed" was a non sequitur in the sense that it has nothing to do with whether the president is acting ultra vires. Border security being needed isn't grounds to shred the Constitution. And you tweeted it at someone who already agrees with you.
@redwhiteblue68 @RepStefanik This was not a vote on the wall. It was a vote on whether the president has the power to legislate and allocate funding. The president does not. Read the Constitution. It is possible to support a thing but not support its being done by dictatorial means.
@brendalsellers1 @RepStefanik I'm no Democrat. Hate em. But I love the Constitution. This was the right vote. I wouldn't want my most passionately held belief realized by unconstitutional means and neither should you.
@XCL1233 @RepStefanik This wasn't a vote on whether to have a wall, it was a vote on whether the president (any president. The office. Forever. BOTH parties) has the power to legislate by declaration of emergency.
@Noonex8900 @v_ktv70 @RepStefanik EXACTLY. They had two years to get the wall done. Any idiot can see they never wanted it in the first place, they just wanted to be able to blame the Democrats when they didn't build it.
@GabrielLahendro @RepStefanik Translated: 	"The executive power of the country wouldn't be overstepping his authority in a way that resembles a dictatorship if the representatives of the people would just let him do whatever he wants."		Totally won me over with that one.
@tthayerii @RepStefanik 1. RINO*	2. What is your specific constitutional argument for how this emergency declaration is legal? This has literally nothing to do with whether there should be a wall. Why do you believe the power to allocate funding should be moved from the Article I power to Article II?
@RGdyk @RepStefanik It's actually not. The law you're referencing specifically defines "military construction project." So while your personal vocabulary considers it that, the law in question defines the projects it applies to, and the border wall doesn't fit into any of the projects listed.
@diatribestress @OutFrontCNN @justinamash Amash explains every vote on Facebook and, to the best of my knowledge, he has never missed a vote. And there is a pinned tweet at the top of his profile about the dangers of putting party over country. And he says he only runs as a republican because he has to to get elected. üá∫üá≤

@nihilistcomhour @brianschatz I totally understand that concern. This needs to be ruled unconstitutional in the Supreme Court. That's how the Constitution has protected us against the tit-for-tat scenario you just described. If this emergency thing works, it is because SCOTUS failed us.

@RoyPentland How did you arrive at that number?
@RoyPentland I don't know, I believe the people who make a career out of calculating that.
@RoyPentland Literally everything is a problem at the wrong levels. I need to eat iron to live, but I'm not drinking a prison bar milkshake.
@RoyPentland I'm not denying reality. Yes, CO2 has been very high before and planet Earth was fine (humans wouldn't be). Yes CO2 is extremely necessary and good for humans. At a certain specific level.
@RoyPentland It's on the graph... Making it appear relevant.  It isn't.
@RoyPentland The fact that a planet has a thing on it is not an argument for why homo sapiens should consider that thing healthy for homo sapiens.
@RoyPentland I don't know of any stegosaurus who is registered to vote. If CO2 was at the levels on at least 90% of this graph, we would all die in minutes. This graph makes no point whatsoever.
@RoyPentland There are literally points on this graph where the OXYGEN level in the atmosphere would have killed you. I mean there is an optimal level of everything for any given purpose. I can't believe I'm explaining to an adult why the JURASSIC period is irrelevant to Humans.
@RoyPentland Okay but point to the part in history that humans were alive for that teaches us something and is on this graph
@RoyPentland I'm not saying it supports any argument. It doesn't. It might as well be a picture of an orange. It's completely and utterly meaningless. It doesn't support my argument, yours or anybody's. 		It is entirely meaningless.
@RoyPentland The welfare of dinosaurs is relevant to our political discourse?		That's terrifyingly stupid.		Also there are two ice ages in the time covered on that graph. The worry with global warming is that it will lead to an ice age.		So if this supports any argument, it's anti CO2.
@RoyPentland I mean it's just depressing that anyone thinks this graph is even mildly relevant to any conversation. The tiny little part at the end that is practically flat is the entire history of our species. It makes me sad that people think this graph means ANYTHING at all.
@RoyPentland Imagine being so dumb that you don't know the little flat part at the end is the entire history of the human species.

@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr I'd assumed we were having the same conversation, but we are talking about two different things. You're just mad people won't vote for the wall. Im mad when they don't vote. I won't hold the "dipshit" comment against you. You're obviously emotional about this.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr I was aware of that bill. I thought you were saying a vote was blocked by Democrats somehow, not that they just voted no. That's normal. I like when the government is shut down, so I don't care how anyone votes or what ends up passing, but let representatives vote.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr Right. So send it to a vote, it won't pass, and time to start negotiating. I'm not upset about the stalemate, I'm upset about votes being blocked altogether.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr I've been following this for months. Well, years. I don't really stop following bills through Congress. I think your information is wrong.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr I'm going to need to know the name of the resolution you're referring to. I can only find information on bills that: received a vote in the house and failed due to Democrats voting No (proper procedure) and bills that have passed house and are not receiving a vote in Senate (bad)
@bIindspottings Well the allegory is told as one lady freaking out in space. Would definitely recommend Interstellar over Gravity to someone who wants a space movie.
@bIindspottings The synopsis would be: One lady freaks out in space for 2 hours.		Come onnnnnnnn
@bIindspottings Gravity is the worst movie that has ever been made. 		Agree on Children of Men.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr The point of the shutdown is that there isn't a bill that has been allowed to pass through all proper channels. If there had been, it would be law... bills don't cause shutdowns. 		Btw if my leftist friends heard I was just called a liberal, they would be pissing themselves.
@jcthunder40 @aerosmith67 @Tyisha71223862 @gelles @kaitlancollins @SenMajLdr Which bill are you referring to? I think you're combining facts about two separate bills, but if you can give me the name, I'll look it up. And we can both forget about the fact that you resorted to name-calling. We can pretend you're above that.

@kambaskets5854 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Every majority leader who puts politics over country by refusing to vote on important issues is guilty of ignoring their constitutional duty. Regardless of party affiliation. As voters, it's on us to replace them.
Hmmmm what's it going to take? If only we had elected leaders to record their votes on spending bills until a compromise, or veto override is reached. https://t.co/ftOdKmlQuk
@SteveScalise Probably a vote in the Senate on any of the many spending bills awaiting a vote. You need a link to an online copy of the Constitution? We all know you guys aren't voting because you're too scared to go on record either for or against the bill, and for or against veto override.
@EileenSollars @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr I am aware that both parties do this, and I've been complaining the whole time. And I'm not going to stop.

@jayallenhill @justinamash @jaketapper What do you propose?
@CrickerNC @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr The person who has the power to call a vote on spending is Mitch McConnell and he is refusing. He is a republican. However, I don't blame his party. I just blame him. Plenty of Republicans are pissed at what he is doing, and I salute them.
@vstoler1 @TheDonald4Life @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr "Only care about getting power." 		The power to spend money rests in Congress alone. By refusing to allow a vote at all, because the president will veto it, Mitch McConnell is handing power of the purse to the executive branch. This is black and white unconstitutional. Here. https://t.co/ZnLyUgG5jK
@vstoler1 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr I was freaking out and saying it was tyranny.
@kyllacon @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Yes, I want them to vote. If they vote No, it is time to negotiate. If they vote Yes, it's vetoed, and not overridden it is time to negotiate. Until then, this is a #MitchShutdown.
@kyllacon @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Characterizing votes as anything other than the Constitutional duty of Congress is a great way to lie down and let them rule you absolutely.
@vstoler1 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr I'll parrot the Constitution any day. The president does not have the power to spend money, but McConnell is giving that power to him. Checks and balances are eroding by the year. Let's follow up when a Democrat president has equal power because you sat and said nothing. https://t.co/gVo8i0QYwT

@TheDonald4Life @vstoler1 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr They are entire bills for (over)funding the government. One such bill was passed unanimously, 100-0 in the Senate already. These are not jokes. They are bills. If you are in the lowest tax bracket you work 10% of the year to fund things like the Senate not voting or working.
@kyllacon @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Right, and putting those issues to a vote is the way to decide that, correct?
@onesticknick @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Yes I was equally outraged. If you think every person who criticizes a politician is of the other party, you're part of the tribalism that is eroding American discourse, and American loyalty to the Constitution.

@vstoler1 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr The spending bills the House passed are sitting on @SenMajLdr McConnell's desk. The shutdown has occurred without there ever having been a vote on those bills. It is the job of Congress to allocate spending. This is a #MitchShutdown. That isn't my opinion. It has stopped at him.
@vstoler1 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Flip the situation in your head. Democrat president wants Medicare for all. House passes a spending bill that doesn't include it. Democrat Senate Majority Leader will not even allow a vote on it, because the "President won't sign it." You're cool with that?
@AngrierWHStaff @williamlegate My girl read that tweet to me without any warning and there were tears in my eyes I was laughing so hard.
@sharenell @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Personally, I like shutdowns. They should pass a bill to shut more of it down.

@kimberlyconroy @justinamash Federal workers are the government. When you work at a place, you accept the terms of working at that place.

@Benglesmith @JuliusGoat @justinamash I have no idea what your point is, but ummm no? Does that in some way invalidate the argument that both political parties are capable of awful things?

@infuzi0n @EricDJuly I'm sorry, do you actually think all the slaves on a piece of property just stayed there and took it because they were afraid of the owners?

@AOC @washingtonpost This is fun watching you try to say your lies and Trump's lies are on different levels of lying.
@AOC I thought being factually correct doesn't matter as long as you're morally right. And since people can have different morals, we all get to make up our own facts. So what the hell are you complaining about?

@morganisawizard I thought they were suspending accounts that call for vigilante violence against pedophiles. Which is illegal, and pretty normal to suspend as a business practice. If they're banning people for saying pedophiles are bad, I would like to know. Can you provide an example?

@Rocky4President @RepThomasMassie Okay, but the climate is very nuanced, dynamic, and balanced. Similarly to an economy, massive changes become shocks and create a problem by upsetting balance. There was a time when everything was huge because of high oxygen levels. Same levels today and you'd faint.
@scottspjut @RepThomasMassie I think the general idea is to support a lack of regulation on CO2 emissions. I personally disagree with that policy, but it's really the argument itself that feels sort of straw-man. I don't think you"ll find one person on Earth who wants to regulate it to 0.
@RepThomasMassie Just to be a voice of reason, which I know you're not immune to (unlike almost all of DC), I kind of see where you're going with this and want to remind you it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Like in an all-oxygen environment, you'd pass out, but you breathe that.

@stevieanntas @jimsciutto @stuartpologe Right and he is explaining those decisions. Pulling out of Syria would be one example. This is a boss being transparent with his employees about why the projects they are working on are being altered. He's not insulting the fact that they work there.
@stevieanntas @stuartpologe @jimsciutto The POTUS has control over how the military is used, yes. And he was explaining why he is making the changes he is making.

@mhartgerink1956 @PattyMurray And we both know that is wrong. It is not a tax, it is a fine. Sometimes (usually) a level of government is wrong. Please read the Constitution. It's sort of important.
@mhartgerink1956 @PattyMurray Did you know that, to uphold ACA, the government had to define NOT buying something as "an economic action?" Every breath you take, you are legally taking billions of economic actions. Think about that.
@mhartgerink1956 @PattyMurray Can't wait for the Not-Visiting-A-Golf-Course Tax. We both know that's ridiculous. So do the activist judges who decided that. The Constitution is clear.
@MaryLou39506562 @PattyMurray I'm surprised it took this long for someone to realize that the Constitution makes it illegal for the Fed govt to mandate purchases. Are you against ACA or do you want Trump to have authority to mandate we buy his steaks? Because that is literally the legal decision here.
@mhartgerink1956 @PattyMurray At least that would technically be legal. Individual mandate is forbidden in black and white. If the I.M. is legal, it is legal for Trump to mandate consumers visit his golf courses. Think about that. The founding fathers knew what they were doing when they wrote these laws.
@PattyMurray What is your specific legal argument for how it is constitutionally legal for the federal government to require individuals to make a purchase? I am searching hard for any argument that specifically addressed legality. I referenced the Constitution. It is Illegal.
@SenSanders @SenateDems Why do you want the Trump Administration to have constitutional authority to require individuals to purchase a product? If it's legal with health insurance, it's legal with anything. The Constitution forbids it. Doesn't matter if it's nice, it's Illegal in black and white.
@Sen_JoeManchin Do you have a relevant statement that addresses the Constitutionality of the federal government requiring someone to make a purchase. Can you back up wanting the Trump Administration to have legal authority to make consumers buy a product? Because everything you said dodged it.

@lgsawyer @jarvis______ @KashJackson2018 @justinamash Both major parties are playing games like that. If you think that's only coming from the GOP, it's probably got to do with the bias of whatever news media you're accessing. If all you watched was Fox, you'd think only Democrats do it.
@lgsawyer @jarvis______ @KashJackson2018 @justinamash I agree, but WE need to fix it.

@SenatorMenendez @SenatorMenendez only has opinions on things where he doesn't have to think about policies. Because he has no opinions. On anything. He supports whatever pays him. He's my senator. Jersey deserves almost literally anybody else. I'd take 4 cats in a man suit over this.

@leavetheraft @Debmoley @RandyEBarnett It is so annoying when people pretend one major party is full of children and the other is not. It's both. Both are children and they do all the same things as each other.
@Debmoley @RandyEBarnett If by "they" you mean anybody in either house of  congress, and either party, then I agree.
@EricHolder Conservative alternatives that are acceptable to you?????? Not a chance. If a person said "I believe abortion is murder," you'd find a way to say they're unqualified. Your opinion on this is irrelevant, because it is a rubber stamp "No" on conservatism.
@SenatorMenendez @SenateDems You're a rubber stamp in a senator's suit and I'm pretty sure you haven't read the Constitution... or most laws in general... including the ones you've signed... and the ones you've authored. The only thing you stand for is pretending you stand  for things. #emptysuit
@SenateDems New Jersey (my state) deserves an actual senator. Can you please just leave? You haven't had a legitimate political opinion in years.
@morganisawizard @AP4Liberty Not you too, @morganisawizard ! Please. There is no difference between this and the 8 years of crying and whining by the GOP under Obama. They would have pulled the same shit on a different issue. The GOP is trash, as are the Democrats. Stop pretending this is new from either.
@AP4Liberty I thought you were running as GOP for the election potential, but were still a libertarian at heart. If you're legitimately buying the narrative from either party that the other is the bigger problem, then you're the problem. Glad Johnson won the nomination that year. Voted him.
@AP4Liberty I think this is a legitimate question.. did you not see the same behavior from the GOP during the Obama years? I hated Obama. Hated him. But the Republican party ignores the Constitution, common decency, and general intellectual integrity as almost a policy, as do the Dems.

@ThePigskinGuy so my fantasy week comes down to whether I can get 16 points from OJ Howard tonight. I'm 1-1 and it's non-PPR. I will be singing your praises if I win.
@ThePigskinGuy Yeah it's non PPR, which makes it even tougher for me. Looking like coin toss time! Thanks for narrowing it down
@ThePigskinGuy I'm a Jets fan and I started Taylor last night. Also last night: dropped my phone, caught it HARD against my own nuts, dropped my beer on the bed, threw my phone and collapsed in pain. And that was the best part of my evening.
@ThePigskinGuy I'm really not into "set my lineup" tweets, but I have no idea on this one. I have to bench one: DJ, Drake, Bernard, Coleman. Leaning bench Bernard. Watchu think, fam? I totally abuse the privilege of tweeting you but after Howard you're the hero I need right now

@ThePigskinGuy Also considering a drop for Conner if I can get him, or Kelly or your boy Trent Taylor. Too many people I want to stash. I guess my main question is should I be trying to do something about QB or sit on Carr and see what happens? Trubisky is also available.
@ThePigskinGuy Think I was having a little post draft panic and was probably overvaluing Watson since I got sniped on him. I have  Adams and Hill starting (Alex Collins in the flex. Non PPR) and then Landry, C Davis, R Anderson, and Kupp benched. TE's are S-J and Njoku
@ThePigskinGuy Drafted today. Pretty happy with the results but I waited too long on QB and got Carr. What do you think about him? I could probably do something like Seals-jones and Landry for Watson, because that owner needs those positions. Both are on my bench

@ThePigskinGuy if they're the best options at your turn in the draft, are you taking Garoppolo, Mahomes or Watson? Seeing some doubt about Watson after the last game.
@EmKuhn29 @tylmel @WalshFreedom I voted for Gary Johnson. It's hysterical when people tell me I really voted for Hillary/Trump, depending on who I'm talking to.

@DragRoute420 @puppyluvr312 @justinamash @instapundit It was upheld because the courts decided that NOT buying health insurance is an "economic action." They made it legal for the federal government to force people to buy anything it wants. Sorry but the courts were dead wrong here.
