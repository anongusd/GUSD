@NeilDiamond I love you Neil! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@DonaldJTrumpJr JR, can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre still yakking. You‚Äôre indictment is coming; you should be packing your bags for Russia. It‚Äôs your only safe Haven. Naughty, naughty writing hush money reimbursement checks to Cohen... Run Forest Run! Bahahaha!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Dude, save the kids. Save the enterprise. Save yourself. RESIGN! They are going to find every penny you ever ILLEGALLY wrote off on your taxes; each one will be a tax fraud crime. And that will be just the ‚Äúminor‚Äù crimes...  Run Forest Run!
@krassenstein Don JR is going to prison! It is without a doubt he will be indicted!
@tonyschwartz I‚Äôve never been around him and all I see is pure idiot and asshole.
@Newsweek @sarahkendzior Kushner is a security risk. The CIA and FBI should take action if THEY believe a true risk exists.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hahahahaha how do you feel about stripes? And... not pin stripes. How about bars? And.... not Hershey bars. How about cells? And not stem cells. Point is sonny, we will be seeing a lot more of you until the trial is over!
@krassenstein Gonna be EPIC! EXPLOSIVE!
@krassenstein I‚Äôm holding you to it Brian!
@krassenstein If the GOP stands behind him, that makes every one of them JUST AS BAD!
@Tinker_Bell_04 @Nicoxw1 Donald J Trump will NEVER be re-elected. He will be lucky to be sitting in the WH throughout the rest of 2019, let alone get another 4 year term. He needs to be focused on keeping his family out of prison and the only way to do that is to resign from the Presidency.
@sianoresist Perfect analogy!
@funder Total USA embarrassment!
@myserenity69 @Nicoxw1 Why another chance? Who is this judge? Ito? This judge needs to go! Stone broke the law by not abiding to the gag order - to jail he goes - NOW!
@realDonaldTrump You are a sick man.
@krassenstein There is NO bigger idiot than Donald J Trump. No one. He has proven what an incredible asinine idiot he is. Anyone that supports this guy supports Russia, North Korea and the rest of our adversaries.
@1DGrand @gtconway3d But seriously just use Kushner‚Äôs security clearance as an example. Trump had to be the one to authorize it. Why is he denying it. Stand up and say, Yes, I authorized it. Big damn deal, admit it. But instead he continues to lie about it. Lies, lies, lies... I can‚Äôt take it!
@gtconway3d I guess that is what blows my mind and I do not understand! HOW can Trump supporters NOT care about all the lies? That alone should make them withdraw based on ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù but they do not. WHY? I cannot support such a liar, EVEN if we had the best of times in history!
@EvanMcMullin @MalcolmNance Our CIA and FBI have to remove him. What are they waiting for? Do it NOW!
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Just resign... slip out the back door quietly... shhhh
@thehill What a loose cannonball! This guy is CRAZY! I think they need to lock him up for his own protection against himself. He. Is. Nuts!
@padresteve @MalcolmNance I don‚Äôt give a crap who he played hide the wiener with, but if he wrote hush payments off on his taxes, I have issues! If he defrauded the US Government on his taxes, then our current President has big issues with the people of the US and needs to answer for his actions.
@_SJPeace_ @SetserSusan I don‚Äôt condone violence but she is a hero for stopping violence against another person. Someone had to do it!
@ADIC33 Ohhh hell yeah!
@tonyschwartz As badly as he deserves it, he will never spend a day behind bars. Hopefully his kids will do time though. The Trumpster will be pardoned for his crimes. It‚Äôs not fair but it‚Äôs reality.
@thehill Haha I never cared for Pence as a politician... or his values. I bet he HATES himself for agreeing to be the VP! His career is ruined by association. Although I am glad because his morals and values suck. But, he could have had a more balanced, quiet life without the Trumpster!
@thehill If he had the right, and if it was legit, then why the hell is he lying about it. Stand up and say, damn right right I ordered it!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump If I was @realDonaldTrump , I‚Äôd resign from the President and focus on trying to save my empire. Trump Enterprise in going to go down in flames! All the Trump kids are going to go to jail. Trumpster‚Äôs wife and little kid will end up eating peanut butter and jelly forever.......
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Oh my gosh, I can‚Äôt even imagine what the accountant has to share! Bank applications, tax returns, under the table deals, prostitution pay offs, YIKES!!! Indictments, indictments, indictments!!!
@joncoopertweets Loyal to who? Not the USA! Give him life.
@thehill He said he would never testify against Trump. I say he is going to roll like a snowball. Pretty boy doesn‚Äôt want to rot in prison with tricky-dick on his back. Every prisoner looking for a cornhole is going to want to take a poke at Nixon!
@pdacosta Meadows is a bully, plain and simple.
@realDonaldTrump You sound nervous....
@thehill I wonder how it feels to be a ‚Äúwinner?‚Äù

@BossRobinVos Are we sure the money got handed out?
@ScottWalker How many people did you rob to do it? We know you didn‚Äôt fix 1 road... we know you stole from hard working people. Haven‚Äôt raised minimum wage in a decade. Correction people are $6 under the average pay. Teachers can make the rent... you are scum Walker!
@WiscoPotitics Vos is a douchebag

@TheOtherMandela It‚Äôs time to end prohibition and move forward! It‚Äôs time for republicans to back the will of the people. It‚Äôs time for the people to vote OUT those that do not support to people‚Äôs demands. Goodbye Fitzgerald and Vos; it‚Äôs time we abolish the Wisconsin Mafia.
@BossRobinVos Yes, Walker and his Mafia friends, @repvos @SenFitzgerald  have ruined our state and run it like the Mob.
@BossRobinVos Why will he NOT go away!!! He‚Äôs like a bad frickin smell....!

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He won‚Äôt resign until JR is indicted... then the resignation will come.
@funder I am still convinced that he resigns when Kushner and JR get indicted. He swings a special deal with Mueller to release the boys and all 3 walk with no jail time. He doesn‚Äôt get impeached or indicted because Pence would Pardon him.
@joncoopertweets Shit, the Trumpster and family are going down! I wonder if JR hopped that jet to Russia yet?
@thehill I dare him to do it again. His own GOP party will string him up by his ... ahhemm... you know!

@msommerhauser @SpeakerVos Who the hell does Vos think he is? He has a little itty-bitty chunk of Wisconsin as an Assembly Rep. He needs to go represent his area of Wisconsin and let the Governor that WE elected deal with Foxconn. Vos, Fitzgerald and scumbag Walker screwed up enough when it comes to FC!
@JeffreyGuterman @GovernorVA I don‚Äôt think he is going to resign. He‚Äôs hoping something big takes over the news and that his name fades away into the sunset...
@WisconsinStrong Who were those 11 people... Vos? Fitzgerald? Or wait, just good buddies of theirs right?
@WiscoPotitics @SenFitzgerald @GovEvers @SenFitzgerald  the citizens of Wisconsin will be watching how Fitzgerald, Vos and the rest of the Republicans vote when legislation is introduced. Many believe that several are in bed with Big Pharma. A vote against marijuana may anger many to initiate a demand to resign!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What did he think he‚Äôd gain by mentioning investigations? Did he think everyone in the room would say, well then we better drop them? The threat accomplished nothing but gave the general public a good laugh I presume. üòä

@BossRobinVos Walker, @SpeakerVos  and @SenFitzgerald  were conning us along. Lining their silk pockets with Wisconsin funds. Most likely knowing the deal was a bust down the road... they are the Wisconsin Mafia and Fitzgerald is the Mob Boss.
@krassenstein Greases back hair = Washington Cartel. Just playing the role he was given...
@JairiBurke @breweronhill @ScottWalker @SpeakerVos @SenFitzgerald We have to vote the rest of the Walker tribe OUT! They have done nothing but ruined this State while they have filled their own deep pockets!
@MollyBeck @journalsentinel This is our Wisconsin Republicans with deep pockets making bank for themselves. This is another reason Walker is gone and @SpeakerVos  and @SenFitzgerald  have to get voted OUT. They have been running Wisconsin like they own it with no regard for the citizens of the State.

@funder Yep! Tick tock! Then the Trumpster will poop his pants... or, he will disregard JR as some low-life that was just ‚Äúa gofer‚Äù and didn‚Äôt mean much anyhow...
@realDonaldTrump Why is it always ‚Äúthe other guy?‚Äù Just ‚Äúa gofer.‚Äù Just a nobody.... Nobody significant or important to you... like everyone around you is, was and most likely always will be trash. You are loyal to NOBODY! You cannot be trusted; I hope those lying for you wise up.
@stonecold2050 This is heartbreaking and sad.
@DogginTrump Trump will pardon Stone, watch and see....
@funder Kushner next... then the Trumpster uses JR as a bargaining chip. Resigns if they agree not to prosecute JR. Of course, the public will never be in on that deal...
This country is going to have a media crash when the Trumpster is no longer in office. What the heck is everyone going to talk about in 2021? Back to Global Warming I suppose...
@ScottWalker You are so pathetic. You ruined wages and benefits for most workers in Wisconsin. We will NEVER let you back. And, we will get rid of the rest of your stagnant, polluted, Republican crooks that helped you ruin this state. @SpeakerVos  @SenFitzgerald
@DogginTrump Jr will become Trumpster‚Äôs bargaining chip later. Don‚Äôt prosecute my son and I will resign......
@tonyschwartz So to all those Trumpster supporters, are you people on drugs? Don‚Äôt you people remember what Nancy Reagan said? ‚ÄúJust say No!‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I think at this point you need to just worry about your ‚Äúown house‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even referring to the White House. You‚Äôre in a pickle!

I wonder how @HillaryClinton is feeling about the Roger Stone indictment? Pretty pumped I bet...

@JeffreyGuterman @jasonlawrence13 Go Jeff, be our insider!
@SethAbramson @VetsForObama Total diversion to keep us focused AWAY from Mueller. Now that arrest of Stone has been made, with more to come hopefully, maybe Trump will open Government. He needs to start focusing on his own freedom! Maybe the arrest of JR will get his attention? Fingers crossed!
@thehill I don‚Äôt think there will be a Trump campaign for 2020... unless he can govern from behind bars?

@LouDobbs @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump So everyone should bring a brick to the party on Saturday? He‚Äôs been in office for 2 years and you say ‚Äúfor the first time....‚Äù Yikes...
@CaliConservati6 @KamalaHarris Sorry to hear... different story in CO? Why is that? Nothing but opioids and heroin happening in WI... it‚Äôs sad!
@DonaldJTrumpJr And back on Earth Gillipie, these crazy humans keep talking about this person called ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù Ugh...... is it 2020 yet???
@KamalaHarris The drug cartel is right here, the wall will keep them in! Big Pharma and our doctors! Free marijuana federally and watch opioid abuse dwindle. #dismantleUSCartel
@kylegriffin1 Barr is clueless on so many issues... he is NOT our next AG! #NoBarr
@funder Awe, picture them all... sitting around with their Burger King crowns...
@ScottWalker You just can‚Äôt stand losing can you loser...? Take your ball and go home... to Colorado, your destruction is done here.
@kylegriffin1 @CoryBooker Excellent job @CoryBooker !
@SenFeinstein Barr is absolutely NO good! He thinks blacks have been treated as fair as whites? Where has he been? He doesn‚Äôt want to end marijuana prohibition? Good grief, bring in the clowns because the circus is here!
@cannabis_times I hope something happens before Barr gets the Attorney General spot! He just told @CoryBooker he doesn‚Äôt believe in the legalization of marijuana!
@vanitaguptaCR @CoryBooker @SenatorDurbin He needs to crawl back under the rock he was hiding under if he thinks for 1 minute whites and blacks have been treated fairly! And we have to decriminalize marijuana and fix our criminal justice system. Geez!
@NAACP @CoryBooker If Barr thinks whites and blacks are treated fairly, what rock has he been hiding under?
I can see the Class Action Headline now... Wisconsin citizens take out Wisconsin Mafia........ https://t.co/HIsMaPaK3f
@NORML @CoryBooker We just got rid of Sessions... #NoBarr
@DonaldJTrumpJr What. Is. Wrong. With. You? Why are you purposely starting a twitter fight? Narcissistic....
@jessieopie Insurance companies want to rape people with pre-existing conditions and cap the amount they are insured for. They will NEVER get quality care under Republican Health Care Bills!
@jessieopie The issues are ‚Äúhow much will it cost‚Äù and will there be ‚Äúa cap‚Äù on the insurance? People with conditions want the same affordable health care as someone that does not have an identified pre-existing condition. Republicans want to strip those 2 issues away.
@AOC @SableViews Imagine if you earned $10 and the the Wisconsin mafia boss @SenFitzgerald  and his cronies heard about it... they‚Äôd find a way to take it all away at a lame duck session in the middle of the night! Shhhh
@SethAbramson @ECmadtown Maybe someone should send the WH one of those little crowns... haha! ‚ÄúKing of the castle!‚Äù
@tobykeith Love ‚ù§Ô∏è ya babe!
@jessieopie @GovEvers @TheOtherMandela @GovEvers  and @TheOtherMandela  is going to have to make it clear that the Mob Boss @SenFitzgerald  doesn‚Äôt run the State of Wisconsin anymore... ‚Äúwe‚Äù the people do.
@BossRobinVos What a disaster... @GovEvers  this should be a priority! These kids need help!
@realDonaldTrump Was there a microwave available? Can‚Äôt eat that yucky stuff cold! ü§¢
@ScottWalker YOU would take $7 from a kid!!!!
@USATODAY Haha hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, special orders don‚Äôt upset us...
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Can you imagine how the world is laughing at us? Make some popcorn Martha, it‚Äôs week three, episode 24 starting....
@ForecasterEnten @jaketapper Unfortunately we ALL are losers now. We are all in the damn box.
@RepJayapal @repmarkpocan @HouseJudiciary It‚Äôs about time this country stands up to racism!
Oh my gosh! Pray for this family! How is this even possible in today‚Äôs world with today‚Äôs safeguards!? https://t.co/uy63M9QpOb
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Open the government, legalize marijuana and pay for border security.
@Jduckham Must have been cold!
@tomscocca @chrislhayes All bad people must go! How did those bastards get there?
@realDonaldTrump So sick of it all... I want the whole swamp drained... ALL of you out now! Open up the Government and legalize marijuana. Use the revenue to secure our border. It‚Äôs not like the wall is going up overnight anyhow; there is a lot of property to secure first.....
@Save_the_Daves @breweronhill Speechless...
@DonaldJTrumpJr Go on vacation dude, who gives a shit where you go?
@lukasnelson @WillieNelson Nothing better than @lukasnelson and @willienelson love ‚ù§Ô∏è you both. I wish I could smoke with Willie to shrink this brain tumor! He‚Äôd be singing a new song!
Praying for a safe return! Keep a lookout Wisconsinites! https://t.co/nB47B8lAR4
Wisconsin sure could use this revenue @GovEvers  @TheOtherMandela  The people of Wisconsin are waiting to see if our elected officials are listening https://t.co/ev5wyNWzSy
RT @MarijuanaPolicy: We're glad that this is being acknowledged ‚Äî but we still need our federal lawmakers to fix this problem. https://t.co‚Ä¶
This dude has got to GO! https://t.co/d72ot9QJON
@cannabis_times @John_Boehner_  you go John! Teach these politicians that Big Pharma is out and cannabis is in!
@RepSpreitzer @BeloitDailyNews To not listen to us about anything, including medicinal marijuana, is shameful, and will cost elected officials more jobs. Just ask Scott Walker...
@RepSpreitzer @SpeakerVos Thank you!
@dmgElliott @fox11news @gofundme Uh oh!
@ehananoki @chrislhayes OMG, got my laugh for the day!
@secularcitizen2 He‚Äôs best buds with Bill O‚ÄôReilly too
@BossRobinVos Ugh, once an idiot always an idiot. Is he ever going to go away????

@BossRobinVos These people, like Vos, will show up on the ballot again. This last election showed just how terrible some of our leaders truly are. It will take some time but we will clean house. Remember that old saying... forgive but don‚Äôt forget... we won‚Äôt forget.
@CoryBooker Big Pharma is in bed with our politicians so bad they have bed sores! So deep into our politician‚Äôs pockets that if you cuts off their pockets, goober runs down their legs! So damn crooked!
@SpeakerVos At what cost?
This Country is clearly divided... Wall or No Wall... reopen the Government and the Polls. Let the American people vote on the damn wall. Two questions; Wall or No Wall!
@DylanNoBandz @GovEvers 1 million people demanded legislation
@Wisco_DOC @GovEvers With walker gone maybe the wage structure can be repaired now.....
@MidMulPenn @GovEvers How about is @JoshKaulWI
@MollyBeck @SpeakerVos @GovEvers Over half (1 million +) voters in Wisconsin also supported marijuana within Wisconsin. This wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrequest.‚Äù Citizens of Wisconsin demand legislation on marijuana. So let‚Äôs get the process going.
@SenDanFeyen held a town hall meet last night. Discussed medicinal marijuana, healthcare, lame duck session, road conditions, among other important issues. Good session; looking forward to continuing dialogue with @AlanRupnick and 104 million marijuana supporters.
@CBSNews So what are we going to learn from this? More ecoli a month from now? Or the FDA recalls another one of their own approved drugs two weeks from now? FDA... useless...
@CBSNews Nothing but trash talk and childish! Pew!
@realDonaldTrump Cutting off funding is not the answer. Improvement in management and prevention is key; any good business person should know that @realDonaldTrump  don‚Äôt make me get out the duck tape again!
@realDonaldTrump And... if you legalized Nationwide first quarter, you‚Äôd have enough revenue to build the wall 3rd quarter; problem solved! Boom!
@realDonaldTrump Legalizing marijuana nationwide would take it off the black market and stop marijuana border trafficking, reduce other drug use such as heroin, and make the US billions. Doesn‚Äôt solve the wall issue but reduces some of the border traffic and solves some of the US drug issues. $$$
RT @AlanRupnick: Sign the petition to legalize #cannabis in #Wisconsin https://t.co/f5mz5TYgE8
@AlanRupnick @SenatorRoth @SenDanFeyen @SenFitzgerald In addition, over 1 million citizens of Wisconsin have demanded some form of marijuana legislation. It‚Äôs your job to get it done. Yes, you work for US...
@CBSNews Officers required to make ‚Äúlife and death decisions‚Äù failed in this case...because there wasn‚Äôt one. What alarms me is if the officer made such a poor decision about a chihuahua, what was he capable of doing to a person he ‚Äúthought‚Äù was a threat?
@willsommer @jaketapper Is this the next damn check mark on our birth certificate? F. M. X. L (lizard)?
@CBSNews Sunk her ship on day one. Dumb kids. Disrespectful. She is what is wrong with our Country. No class. Certainly not ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù to be in politics...
HUMP DAY! Now, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we all just get along?‚Äù
@cannabis_times Our Wisconsin Republican leaders are going to cost our state millions and millions of dollars! Of course people are going to drive across the state lines!!! Idiots!!!

@washingtonpost Opioid abuse is coming from Big Pharma, FDA and Republicans that refuse to pass medicinal marijuana reform. Plain and simple.
@TheOtherMandela @ForOurFutureWI Mandela‚Äôs gonna rock it!
@madisondotcom Research shows where marijuana has been legalized, heroin use has been reduced by more than 25%. It‚Äôs not our ‚Äúcure-all‚Äù answer but it would be a start to reducing our WI drug abuse issues! Nothing else has worked!
Hoping one of these has to do with medicinal marijuana @GovEvers https://t.co/yYntAXQ4bd
@RepSeanDuffy Illegal drugs penetrating Wisconsin through the southern boarder is a national problem. Locally, let‚Äôs discuss our opioid overdose problem and how to get a handle on the abuse. More than 1 million WI citizens voted to legalize some form of marijuana which will reduce this abuse.
@ScottWalker Coming from someone that just lost an election because he wouldn‚Äôt listen to the people of his State... ummm... doesn‚Äôt mean a lot Scotty.
