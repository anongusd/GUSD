One of the most special moments for a daughter, especially a "daddy's girl" like me, is having her dad walk her down the aisle. I'm blessed to have my dad around and was able to experience that last night. Yes, we walked down the aisle to "Guantanamera". #NavarroCardenasAtLast https://t.co/aCUCouRyOI
@RobertIrvine @gailkimITSME Love you guys
We’re getting married today!	I’m in no-politics zone. If something big happens, pls send messenger pigeon.	Excited. Nervous. Humbled by the love &amp; support and friends who’ve traveled far &amp; wide to be here. Worried I won’t be able to breath in the dress.😳	#NavarroCardenasAtLast
My friend Lisa Quiroz died from pancreatic cancer. She gave me earrings she wore at her wedding. She said, “I know I won’t be at ur wedding. Please wear these so a little part of me is w/u”. I’m wearing them down the aisle on Sat. Wore today b/c I need to get the tears out now.💔 https://t.co/PIW6mKEOWa
If a Democrat running for President, hell, if a Democrat running for city council in a city of 1,000 people, said the stupidity Trump said about Kim re #OttoWarmbier, Republicans would be demanding they resign &amp; Russian troll farms would be raising holy hell on the internet.
Comgratulations, to everyone at @TheView, especially those behind the cameras. https://t.co/4oe9IDhrQ4
Trump’s a lame excuse for POTUS.	Doesn’t  believe US Intel, but believes:	-Putin didn’t interfere in elections;	-Saudis didn’t plan Khashoggi murder;	-Kim in ignorant bliss re Otto Wambier. 	Republicans -any American- willing to accept this, have lost their damn mind...and soul.
At times, I think Trump has hit the bottom of the barrel and cannot possibly go any lower, cannot possibly become more loathsome. He always proves me wrong.	👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼	“Trump defends North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over death of Otto Warmbier” https://t.co/vUDtKEqOxG

@GOP, Michael Cohen was one of your three National Finance Chairs along with Wynn and Broidy. One resigned because of sexual harassment accusations. The other had to resign after it was revealed he impregnated &amp; paid hush-money to Palyboy Bunny. Maybe you sit this one out. https://t.co/oYIdTSZ6ca
These Trump-world congressional hearings have ruined scripted TV dramas for me. Crazier than fiction.

Trump is capable of protecting Americans, but only if their named “Trump”.	He is capable of showing empathy to immigrants, but only if they’re his in-laws.	He is capable of moments of sanity, but he is not stable.	He is capable of speaking truth, but he is fundamentally a liar. https://t.co/6KbwtYp04T
It’s one thing to strongly support/defend Trump. This is threatening a witness on his behalf.

This may not be a popular opinion, but I’m impressed with the resourcefulness of thinking of eating a salad with a comb, and more so, with the ability to eat a salad with a comb. Good thing it wasn’t spaghetti.
Been a hell of a week for legal analysts: Smollet charged; white supremacist charged; Stone gagged; sex-trafficking ring in FL busted; R. Kelly charged w/sex crimes; Alex Acosta-approved Epstein plea-deal found to have broken the law. And there’s still 2 hours left in the week.😳
Epstein Scandal was revealed @MiamiHerald months ago. Crimes occurred in FL. Victims -at least 80- were Florida girls.  Plea deal a judge found to be against the law, was cut by @SecretaryAcosta. FL Sens, @SenRickScott &amp; @marcorubio should lead efforts so these girls get justice.
Hard to give much of a damn about Kraft soliciting paid sex. When over 80 girls -some young as 14- were sexually assaulted by monster Jeff Epstein. @SecretaryAcosta, US Atty at the time, gave him a sweetheart plea deal. Judge found he broke law by not even telling victims. Gross!

I saw Smollett speak about diversity and inclusion a week before this, on a panel moderated by @nischelleturner. He advocated for minorities/LGBTQ.

@cfresh2180 If you’ve been reading my opinions, I’ve repeatedly said this is ultimately up to Venezuelans. I don’t think US should intervene militarily. But I do think the US and international community should continue to apply all the diplomatic and economic pressure they can on Maduro.
This feels weird. I echo every word of this tweet. Maduro’s a monster oppressing &amp; starving Venezuelans. He’s driven millions into exile. Maduro must go! 🇻🇪 		I can’t believe I agree w/Trump.

In case you’re keeping track, Trump squeezed in declaring a “national emergency” in between weekends playing golf in Florida....on taxpayers dime.
Great having @HurdOnTheHill on @TheView. He’s pragmatic, &amp; focused on telling the truth about the border instead of going along w/Trump’s fabricated “national emergency”.

Maduro is a monster, killing Venezuelans. Like most Americans, I’m not in favor of US military intervention in Venezuela. US &amp; international community’s diplomatic &amp; economic actions to try to push Maduro out, is right approach. Has bipartisan support in Congress. Small miracle!
It’s no secret, I can’t stand Trump. His 1 redeeming quality for me is his spotlighting the humanitarian &amp; political crisis created by Maduro. I’m grateful Trump Administration leading international community’s opposition to Maduro &amp; solidarity with freedom-loving Venezuelans.🇻🇪

@EdwardCarter17 Well, the problem is I’ve lost all hope of Republicans having a sense of shame. So, I I guess still expecting it from Democrats sounds rather unfair. Sigh.
@jtyler1128 Honey, Ive been trying for three years! It’s like all sense of shame has been lost since he had the gall to keep running after Access Hollywood tapes, and Republicans had the lack of decorum of electing him President even after that (with a little help from the Russians).
@CRLSLisaTK +1
I can’t believe Northam is still Governor &amp; Fairfax still LG. Ultimately, it’s up to Virginians, Democrats &amp; the conscience (or lack thereof) of these 2 guys. I guess gone are the days when elected officials were expected to quickly resign when something shameful was revealed.🤷🏻‍♀️
@NoahCRothman Agreed. I was also disturbed by her misinformed tweets re Venezuela, She’s only been in Congress one month. I hope she will be open to learning and listening. That’s how I interpret an apology. Far too often these days, elected officials choose to double down and not apologize.
For those of us who called on @IlhanMN to reconsider her actions, this is a time to recognize she did just that. Apologizing is a sign of strength, not weakness. https://t.co/KeZX9JvtZb

@lauren_marinaro I voted for Hillary. I find Harris engaging and Klobuchar seems solid.
@TaoJonesing Don’t make this about sexism. She turns me off. I already voted for a woman in 2016 and would vote for Harris or Klobuchar without much agony.
@Am12625142 I can’t stand her policies or persona. Clumsiness re Native American thing is icing. Others say they find her phony, self-righteous, awkward, unlikable. I don’t hear that re Harris, Biden, O’Rourke, Booker, Klobuchar. Beyond policy, something about Warren like nails on chalkboard
Some didn’t like hearing Warren repels Anti-Trump R’s/Right-lean Indies. I get it. D’s will choose who the hell they please. Short of Ortega or Maduro, I’ll vote for anyone not Trump. In 2016, a few thousand votes (+Russia) made the difference. Warren turns-off gettable voters.🤷🏻‍♀️
Thank you for this, @JoeBiden.	This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It is about human rights and solidarity with a suffering, oppressed people. Your statement of support matters. https://t.co/B4QYYC74gz
@EllenCotler Not necessarily. What I’m saying is to get voters outside and beyond the Democratic base to vote for a Democratic nominee, it’s best to nominate one who doesn’t repel these voters, who can connect. If not, you run the risk of people staying home.
This isn’t a priority for D primary voters, but to beat Trump -which is my priority- need to nominate someone who can appeal to Right leaning Indies +  Republicans in Exile. I’ll vote for anyone, a mannequin over Trump. But not everyone will. Truth is, Warren repels many of us.🤷🏻‍♀️

Let me correct it for him: “No issue better illustrates divide between the lemmings in Trump’s base and Donald Trump than illegal immigration.

Northam has “Yearbook Amnesia” too.	He’s now qualified to be Trump’s nominee to the US Supreme Court.
This is not a US coup. Millions are in streets all across Venezuela demanding Maduro’s exit. The international community, with US leadership, has exerted economic &amp; diplomatic pressure on the dictator. The ones risking their lives for freedom, are Venezuelans. Maduro must go!🇻🇪 https://t.co/zmFM3MIngP
Agreed. 	Also, the American people deserve better representation than what we have gotten these last two years. https://t.co/qdrJLBpl8d
@hjbartling I have.
It’s hard to apply same standards &amp; measuring stick to those we sympathize with as to those we don’t, to those on our team, as to those on the opposite team. Inconsistency leads to hypocrisy and losing moral standing. We shouldn’t excuse the inexcusable, even when it’s hard.
Worst case scenario, Northam’s one of the people in the stupid, racist, awful photo, either in black-face or KKK garb. Hard to decide which costume’s worse. Best case scenario, he put a stupid, racist, awful photo of other ppl in his med school yearbook page. All are inexcusable.
Last wk, @GovRonDeSantis⁩ rightly so, made his newly-appointed Sec of State resign after a pic of the guy in blackface became public. This photo of Gov. Northam depicts inexcusable racism, insensitivity &amp; stupidity. There’s no denying or explaining it. https://t.co/KZZdIucqrp
If nothing else, there is a lesson for other candidates to be learned from this Elizabeth Warren fumble: do not let Trump goad you. Do not react to his provocarions. Do not take his bait. It’s exactly what he wants you to do. https://t.co/apcStul5sz

FLA elected Democrats -local, state &amp; federal- stand against Maduro. They’re informed about oppression in Venezuela. They know &amp; represent Venezuelan exiles. For us, it’s also a local issue. It could decide elections -not in Minnesota, but yes, in Florida. https://t.co/daXnCSb6Ii

1) Engagement = sanctions/diplomatic/economic pressure, not troops; 2) Maduro destabilizes our Hemisphere; 3) Maduro provides US enemies beachhead in our hood 4) 2k Venezuelans a month seek asylum in US; 5) international community should give a shit about crimes against humanity. https://t.co/XJjxM81GjJ
I dislike Trump viscerally. How we see him, shouldn’t taint how we view what’s happening in Venezuela. There’s a reason why Dems, well-informed about the issue, like @DWStweets &amp; @RepShalala support interim President, @jguaido. Maduro’s a thug killing &amp; oppressing Venezuelans.🇻🇪

Town-hall format was made for @KamalaHarris. She has an Oprah-like domain of stage &amp; camera. She connects w/people on personal basis. Remembers names. The questions have been all over the map. She’s answered w/empathy &amp; policy. Unlike Trump, she laughs easily and contagiously...
I don’t have a dog in this fight. I’m happy about this @KamalaHarris Iowa townhall. It feels like we’re finally off to the races in the effort to rid ourselves of the stain in US history that is the Trump Presidency. All I want is a candidate who can beat him (and the Russians).

@SolaceVz It’ll be determined by Venezuelan people, protestors, Army, opposition. The international community can &amp; should show solidarity by pressuring Maduro. Ultimately, it’s up to Venezuelans. Gone are the days when US could swoop-in to a country, remove one leader and put-in another.
Re Maduro:	-He kills, jails, beats opponents &amp; peaceful protestors	-ppl are starving	-millions are on streets protesting him	-millions in exile, inc US	-Defending Maduro is not defending socialism. It’s defending a criminal	-Venezuela’s destiny will be determined by Venezuelans🇻🇪
Trump was a fluke. Annals of history full of ppl w/big egos and/or deep pockets, who fell for consultants’ siren song that they could make a difference running as 3rd Party candidate. Perot, Nader, Jill “Russia Today” Stein...all asterisks for “spoilers”. Et tu, @HowardSchultz?
Has Tom Brokaw assimilated to being on Twitter, yet?
@enriquesapene @CNN Technically, he’s still there and still giving orders. Until he’s out (can’t wait for that to be the case), “former presidents” is never gonna fly. I’ll try to thin’ of a term that can reflect the reality. I have a few choice words I myself would use to describe Maldito Maduro.
@enriquesapene @CNN I hate Maduro. In my eyes he’s a corrupt dictator w/Venezuelan blood on his hands. A monster who is starving, killing, jailing Venezuelans. American media will never refer to him as such. In the eyes of the world, he won an election. Gag.	Serious question: what term do u suggest?

@dango9 I will accept whatever the majority of Florida voters decided. The argument for a transparent, accurate &amp; complete count is weakened if you start the conversation saying you don’t like one or the other. It’s less about the candidates. It’s more about the integrity of elections.

Trump fired Sessions for 1 reason: his recusal from Mueller Investigation. He’s obviously trying to undermine the investigation. This is one more chance for the Republican Senate to prove they are capable of doing the job of being a check and balance. Don’t hold your breath...

@RosLehtinen, in Congress for 28 years and could have stayed for another 28, representing the district I live in, in Florida, was known for her excellent constituency services. I hope newly elected members, including @DonnaShalala and @DebbieforFL, follow in her footsteps.
Congratulations @AndrewGillum for running an inspiring campaign.	Congratulations Florida for being the center of the political world...again.	Congratulations @RonDeSantisFL, next Governor of Florida.

Floridians, Early Voting begins today! Ignore the polls. We’ve all seen them be wrong before. It’s a cliché, but it’s true, only poll that matters, is the election. Many Florida elections have been decided by precious few votes (Bush/Gore 2000). Ur vote does matter. Just do it✔️
Don’t know @AndrewGillum. But I detest those stoking fear by saying he’ll turn FLA into Venezuela, Cuba or Nicaragua. It cheapens the pain of millions of Floridians who fled those regimes, which beat &amp; kill opponents. Much like Trump’s friends in Saudi Arabia. It is demagoguery. https://t.co/AEbTaXQSUS
That was 1 question I really wanted answered by DeSantis. “Is Trump a good role-model for your children?” He dodged it. It’s such a simple answer. “No. Donald Trump is not a good role model for children. I hope my wife and I are good role-models for our children.”. Period.

What Trump’s doing right now, talking about the immigrant caravan, praising guy in Montana who body-slammed reporter, it’s all with purpose of diverting &amp; distracting from the pressure he’s getting re #khashoggi. Don’t let the murder of a US Resident be swept under the Saudi rug.

Whether u’re Democrat or Republican, whether u’re a Trump supporter or opponent, we should all condemn this &amp; demand more from our own government. This isn’t about partisan politics.

Let’s try not to get distracted talking about Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother &amp; Hillary defending Bill re Lewinsky. Focus on winning elections &amp; bringing much needed checks &amp; balances back to government, damn it! And don’t forget Khashoggi or Florida.
@myoaktown People ask Melania &amp; Ivanka re accusations against Trump.	People ask Julie Chen re accusations against Moonves. 	Some may deem unfair -surely these women do- but it is, what it is. If u put yourself in public eye in defense of such men, u’ll be confronted w/the inconsistency.🤷🏻‍♀️
Talking about Lewinsky is clearly difficult for Hillary. It involves her husband. She gets defensive. But until &amp; unless, the Clintons have a coming to Jesus, acknowledge &amp; show remorse for how badly Bill acted, this will keep haunting them. In 2018, ppl don’t look the other way.
Trump is en route to hurricane affected areas of Florida. Quick! Somebody make sure to tell him Panama City and Mexico Beach are part of Florida, before he starts talking about building a big, beautiful wall cutting-off the panhandle.
Honestly though, shouldn’t  Elizabeth Warren have waited 3 weeks to release her DNA results? There are tight races all over the country. Seems to me, best use of time for any potential Democratic presidential nominee candidate right now, is helping elect other Democrats.

I am grateful to Dr. Blasey-Ford. Her courage and selflessness gave rise to a national conversation on a taboo subject that so many had kept silent about for so long. She gave voice to so many victims who for the first time felt free to share their trauma. Thank you, Christine.
Elections. Have. Consequences.		You want a different result? 		Vote!
I don't pretend to know how John would have voted on Kavanaugh. But I do know, I miss McCain's measured voice and moral clarity in the midst of this spectacle.
I am so old, I remember when a Supreme Court nominee calling herself a "wise Latina", was considered a scandal.
Starting the day with a little comic relief:	While we were all distracted fighting over the future of the Republic, Trump climbed all the way up the stairs of Air Force One, with toilet-paper stuck to his shoe.  https://t.co/QoSDcjwliL
Even if you feel no sympathy towards Kavanaugh, even if you feel no sympathy towards Dr. Ford (I do), it’s impossible not to feel sympathy for the distress this has got be causing their families, especially their kids. They have nothing to do with it. Keep them in ur thoughts.
It’s been a long day, folks. It’s getting late. Try to get some rest. Wake-up tomorrow with renewed energy and fight for what you believe in. It’s what Democracy is all about. Good night, tweeps.

If an Obama nominee asked Cruz if he ever blacked-out from drinking, or blamed her tough confirmation on a “vast Right-wing conspiracy”, with voice breaking &amp; chin quivering, Republicans would vote against her...assuming they would have held an actual vote on an Obama nominee.
Break from all politics, all the time time, for an unpaid, non-political plug: This is the 1st time I fly @JetBlue. I couldn’t love it more. There’s rosé. The seats are comfy. There’s live tv with tons of options. And most importantly, the crew is crazy nice &amp; helpful.
What do 	-The Catholic Journal	-The largest organization of Christian churches	-Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens	all have in common? 	They all think Kavanaugh should not be on the Supreme Court.	None of them are Liberals.	None of them are pro Roe v Wade.
👇🏼 https://t.co/EmsXq1uXL8
Like Kavanaugh, every Trump nominee to SCOTUS will be against Roe v Wade. That’s the reality for Democrats.		Unlike Kavanaugh, not every Trump nominee to SCOTUS would have honesty, partisanship &amp; fitness of character baggage. That’s the reality for GOP.		There are better choices.
For many, this Kavanaugh vote is all about overturning Roe v Wade. So when even the largest group of Christian churches comes out against Kavanaugh, it says a lot about just how divisive and destructive this nomination is. https://t.co/8sYJaS11aQ

Regardless of whether Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, Dr. Ford coming forward was not for naught. She empowered victims. She put perpetrators on notice. She opened America’s eyes as to what can happen to girls. She told her truth. She opened the door for others to tell their truth.

If you listened to that opening statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and it did not break your heart, please go see a cardiologist because you have no heart.
This is so excruciating to hear.
Why didn’t this come up in 6 FBI investigations of Kavanaugh? B/c these women, like many others who experienced similar things, remained silent. 	Why are they speaking now?	Because it’s a nomination for SCOTUS.	Because it’s 2018.	Because women are no longer ashamed or afraid.
Every American -every Senator- listening to Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford testimony today, should remember, this is not about ideology. It’s not about wanting or not wanting a Conservative on Court. That’s a different issue. This is about right &amp; wrong. It’s about fitness of character.
So many last minute revelations and plot-twists today...	This Kavanaugh process has ruined telenovelas for me.
If this was happening with a Democrat President’s nominee, Republicans would have called for an FBI investigation and demanded to hear from Mark Judge and his ex-girlfriend. They should be doing the same now in order to have the most information possible to make a decision. https://t.co/nTXER7IAHs

Every GOP Senator should ask themselves:		1. “If Merrick Garland had been accused of committing sexual assault 35 years ago, what would I have done?”		2. “If it was my wife, sister or daughter making this accusation, what would I do?”		Some things shouldn’t be about partisanship.

So far, there’s 1 allegation from 35 yrs ago vs Kavanaugh.	Standard for life-time appointment to SCOTUS were he’ll make decisions -some might involve sexual assault- affecting us all should be amongst highest in land.	Kavanaugh &amp; Christine Blasey Ford deserve to be heard on this.

@samparker926 Currently off the Amalfi Coast. Overdosing on relaxation.
After two divisive years in American history, remembering the extraordinary lives of John McCain and Aretha Franklin has unified us in sadness, uplifted our spirits and reminded us America is great because it can produce exceptional men and women capable of inspiring us.🇺🇸
At a time when we are so divided, when racial tensions are so high, McCain chose to reflect the diversity of Arizona &amp; America in his service. These were people he knew and loved well and who knew him well. This is the John I knew. Color, race, creed did not matter to him. 🇺🇸
I’m out of the country and trying to keep up with politics back home. I’m seeing Cruz allies and GOP posting pictures of Beto O’Rourke looking young and I guess doing rather normal things young people do. I’m confused....are these supposed to be effective negative attacks?
As McCain is honored in Arizona and Washington this week, I cannot think of a single other sitting US Senator or Representative who’d elicit such national grief &amp; respect &amp; would qualify to receive such honors. The lack of inspirational American leadership saddens &amp; worries me.
Sharing a little of Dubrovnik. The sight of Game of Thrones. Beautiful beaches, the bluest of waters, friendly people and the history and architecture are simply amazing. https://t.co/eqs3WsyIBw
So fitting Arizona 1st to say goodbye to McCain. He fell in love with Cindy and her State. He loved its Grand Canyon, watching its birds, its tribes and Mexican food. He loved the creek behind his ranch in Cornville. He was crazy about its sports teams. He was Western at heart.🌵
As a Floridian, it was my hope this Governor’s race would be about the pressing issues facing our state -rising tides, algae outbreak, trade, economy, jobs. I had hoped it would not be one were racism was front and center. That hope lasted all of 10 hours. https://t.co/KeBENvMovw

@davidmweissman I try to look at the sourcing. For example, the audio of the children crying inside the detention center, has been independently verified by CBS news. The image of the two year old girl crying was taken by an AP photographer. These are credible news outlets in my opinion.

@redkody It was not legal in all states until 1967. The Lovings, who brought the case, could not live as a legally married couple in Virginia. I am sorry for your loss.
Sham elections in Venezuela today. Everyone already knows there’ll be fraud. Nicolas Maduro will continue what Hugo Chavez started in 1999, a regime of corruption &amp; oppression, which turned a once prosperous nation into one where ppl die of lack of food, medicine &amp; freedom. 🇻🇪

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officialize their love today. It has remarkable significance. In the US, it wasn’t until 1967, in the case of Loving vs Virginia, that the Supreme Court invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriages. 	Love is Love is Love.
This is just beautiful...for some many reasons. https://t.co/4EpqgFvNHX

As we celebrate moms, I am grateful to have my wonderful “mamá” in my life. Nothing compares to that kind of unconditional love. But today can be hard for children who’ve lost their mom, and mom’s who’ve lost a child. Sadly, in my family, there’s both. Keep them in your thoughts.
@RosLehtinen She saw the kind of mom you became. She owls be also so very proud of the super-grandma you have become...except for the home-cooking part.

If u support a dude who boasts of “moving on women like a bitch”, AND forcibly kissing them, AND grabbing them, AND is accused by over a dozen women of sexual assault AND lied about paying hush-money to a porn star, maybe u shouldn’t spike the football over Schneiderman. Really.
If keeping track:	1. Trump boasted of groping women’s genitals, is accused of sexual assault by +12 women;	2. Gov of MO had sex w w/a woman he tied-up in his basement, tried to extort her w/pics;	3. AG of NY, slapped &amp; choked women he dated;	4. Folks, we need to elect more women.

What can I tell you, I dont like roasts. I have never liked the idea of skewering people sitting a few feet away to get a laugh. But I think it’s hypocritical for people to take offense at harsh jokes by a comedian and yet defend the nasty stuff Trump says constantly. https://t.co/eS9Y08tGRi
We’re supposed to take a comedian seriously, and attacks from POTUS as jokes. @Michelle Wolf did what nobody else has been able to do: get Trump supporters to stand up against offensive attacks on women. What about @Rosie, @morningmika, @CarlyFiorina, @megynkelly, Heidi Cruz...?
Let’s not pretend “Aunt Lydia”, softball coach, “Cousin Sarah” comments werent re SHS looks.

I’m so disappointed. Forget disappointed, I’m so pissed-off, Paul Ryan -who started as a “Jack Kemp Republican”, a pro-immigration guy, and made promises on the issue-is leaving Congress without having done a damn thing, nothing, on DREAM Act. Ugh.
Going a little further back into GOP Speakers: Paul Ryan’s retiring. John Boehner’s hawking marijuana. Dennis Hastert’s in a halfway house after being released from federal prison for charges related to sex crimes, and Newt Gimgrich is at the Vatican as his 3rd wife’s + 1. 🙈🙉🙊 https://t.co/RV3G1zeVpr
Paul Ryan has 8 months as Speaker. He’s finally free of political chains. Time to put country over Party. He should remove Nunes from Intel Committee, have a vote on Dream Act, move legislation to protect Mueller, and denounce Trump’s unpresidential actions &amp; words at every turn.
Ryan’s a good, compassionate man. But allowed Trump to define him. Did him so much harm. Painful to watch. Paul chose to stay silent &amp; inert when faced w/actions that went against his principles, in order to be a team player. He’ll now be free to find his voice again, if he wants
Just waking up. A little afraid to look at #PresidentLoco’s twitter. What’s he been up to, today? Is Alan Dershowitz Attorney General yet...or is he the new Chief of Staff?

If GOP had any sense &amp; spine, instead of going on tv to warn Trump about dire consequences of firing Mueller, they should move on Graham/Booker legislation to deter this outcome. Should have done it months ago. Trump is in a bad head-space, &amp; downward spiral. Capable of anything.

Melania &amp; Americans know Trump cheated. What she does re her marriage is her choice, not for any of us to meddle in. I just call on her to either tell Trump-base bullies to stop the crap vs the Parkland kids, or she should stop claiming she’s leading anti-bullying campaign. https://t.co/ZVhoKmeSq9
Melania claims fight against cyber-bullying as @FLOTUS goal. We know she (&amp; nobody) can control her husband. But it’s unjustifiable that she’s been silent re vicious lies &amp; attacks, particularly by Trump supporters, against Parkland students. Girl, schtick’s getting a little old.
Don’t know how many times I heard or read, “Hillary Clinton should step off-stage”....I mean folks, the woman’s giving paid speeches in other continents, signing books at Costco, being a grandma, foraging for mushrooms in woods of Chappaqua.

No. When I say “attack”, I mean calling these Parkland kids, “Neo-Nazis” &amp; “communists”. Spreading doctored pictures. Lying about their whereabouts during shooting.

Some folks’ obsession to make @davidhogg111 the focus, &amp; attack him is an effort to distract from strength of this student-led movement. Keep going David, Emma, Sarah &amp; all the millions who marched with them. Kids, Don’t stop pushing to make change happen! https://t.co/gm9XiZzA00

Only 10% of the vote is in, in PA-18, and am already seeing Trumpeteers squirm on tv, distancing themselves from and trashing Saccone already. The guy is right of Attila the Hun, and they are calling him “Establushment”.
Hey, @realDonaldTrump, firing a Cabinet Secretary seems a mighty good way to distract us from your affair with + hush-money payment to a porn actress. Since Stormy not going away, I’d like to suggest a few others, in no particular order: Carson, DeVos, Munchkin, Zinke, Pruitt...
Man, @MittRomney should send the Russians a fruit basket today for having blocked his appointment as Trump’s Secretary of State. 		As far as Rex Tillerson goes, being fired by Trump for not being a “yes man”, will one day be the most honorable and distinguished line of his resume
Trump Cabinet:	-Price resigned in scandal	-Cohn resigned fed-up	-Tillerson fired	-Carson scolded for $31k table	-Zinke scolded for $139k doors#	-Pruitt scolded for I can’t remember what	-Munchkin too many to mention	-I forget other guy who got scolded	-DeVos stars in “Clueless 2”
Today:	-Pennsylvanians vote in PA-18;	-We learned Trump’s Rasputin, Roger Con...Oops! I mean, Stone was in contact w/Assange;	-Tillerson finally taken out of his misery. Will be replaced by Pompeo;	-We haven’t heard from Stormy, yet.		It’s not even 9AM.	Pace yourself, America.

Wow. @GeraldoRivera went into CPAC, the lion’s den, and stood his ground, advocating for increased age restrictions, for something to be done on gun laws. I have a feeling he was thinking about his own little girl and others like her, and their right to feel safe in school. https://t.co/LfsEk8fh42

Good start.	We should also allow Counties/municipalities to pass their own restrictions. Florida has very urban areas and very rural areas. In some parts of Florida, guns are used for hunting animals. In other parts of Florida, they are often used for killing people. https://t.co/kLJ3HPYHs8
Trump spoke at CPAC.	-He lead crowd in chants of “Lock her up!” against Hillary Clinton. Ironic, considering many of his close associates indicted or have plead guilty.	-He lead crowd in booing John McCain. Pathetic, considering McCain is home dealing w/ravages of brain cancer.

-In SOTU, Trump demonizes immigrants...again.	-Deadly GOP train/dump-truck accident. 	-Still no solution in sight for #Dreamers.	-FEMA says “adios” to Puerto Rico today, even though 1/3 of The island still has no electricity.		I think I need an emotional support peacock.
Anyone thinking of using the Republican train derailment as a metaphor to make a political point, please don’t. There are people injured. There were children on the train. Keep them in your thoughts and realize how for all of us, life can change in an instant.
Wow. Several Committee Chairmen resigning. Tells you one thing, they’re concerned about becoming the minority, and having to endure handing over the gavel. https://t.co/j0K5rUTxNM
I realized listening to Trump read his State of the Union, I don’t trust one word that man utters. I was unmoved by all of it. Meaningless. Like listening to him read from my car’s owner’s manual telling me how to operate the sound system. Made me sleepy.
@realDonaldTrump says, “we all share the same heart.”	No, Donald. We don’t.
Trump tells the people affected by natural disasters, specifically Puerto Rico, “We love you. We are with you”.	Tomorrow, FEMA officially shuts-off operations in Puerto Rico. https://t.co/xAhVZLpjwV

So does anyone -Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, Progressives, Liberterians, Librarians, Rastafarians- actually like the Trump immigration proposal? 	Anyone, anyone...Bueller?
The hard left is a hard “no” on wall and curbing family reunification.	The hard right is a hard “no” on citizenship.	Yup, Trump hit a hell of a sweet spot.
Make no mistake, this immigration bill is trading hostages -in this case, #Dreamers- for ransom. Trump is asking for a high ransom. But you know what you do when you are emotionally invested and love the hostages? You pay the damn ransom.
Other than Devin Nunes -who must have been dropped on his head as a baby- is anyone seriously stupid enough to think trained US intelligence officers would be stupid enough to refer to a secret society, as a “secret society”? They need to come up with a better conspiracy. Really.

Grab some popcorn and a coke, turn on the TV and watch @GrahamBlog questioning memory-impaired DHS Secretary now. 🍿
Really, how can anyone w/a shred of dignity debate shit-hole vs shit-house? The 1st syllable is the “shit” that matters. He was describing predominantly black/brown countries. It’s not about a word. It’s not about profanity. It’s about racism by the American President.🤦🏻‍♀️

There are 800,000 #DACA beneficiaries. Even more qualify as #Dreamers. They’re our friends, neighbors.Part of our communities. If we don’t fix this issue, America will see this scene play out over and over. Children w/o parents, spouses w/o their partner, employers w/o workers... https://t.co/a3qRWIeD3Q
If you don’t have what it takes to see Trump’s words against black &amp; brown immigrants as racist, if you don’t have what it takes to condemn those hateful words, then, you don’t have what it takes to put out statements  &amp; photos commemorating #MLK. Do us all a favor, and don’t.

@NewCityofGold @theJenMartin I was born in Nicaragua. My parents had the resources to bring and keep me here legally, hire immigration attorneys, etc. For which I’m grateful. It took a long time and effort on their part, but after more than a decade, I was eligible for permanent residency, then, citizenship.
@shondarhimes Thank u for this, @shondarhimes
@freedm_of_spch Thank you for sharing your story.😘
My parents fled communism &amp; made the choice to bring me to America when I was 8 year-old. But for the Grace of God, I’d be a #Dreamer. #iMarch for those who like me, love America &amp; want to contribute to make it great. So they can achieve their American Dream. I am a Dreamer too.

@farenthold, @alfranken, Conyers, @RepKihuen....and God knows how many others. The tax-payer hushfund needs to end. The American people have a right to know how much and for whose misdeeds we have paid. Oh, and they need to pay us back...with interest. Now.
Zero tolerance for sexual harassment means speaking-up and taking action even when you like the harasser, even if he is a member your tribe. Good for @SenGillibrand, @clairecmc, @maziehirono, @SenatorHassan for doing so. https://t.co/9zZ6wHYxbk
@realDonaldTrump, u are not #TimePersonOfTheYear. The #MeToo  movement is. But if it’s any consolation, you can take some credit for inspiring it. Many women got mad as hell to see what you’d gotten away with, and decided to stick together and speak up!

Honest Republicans know, if Hillary Clinton or any Democrat POTUS had done half of what Trump &amp; his minions did w/Russia, Republican Congress would be moving to impeach. But b/c Trump’s a member of GOP tribe, it’s a different standard. It should not be. Country over Party.🇺🇸

Hard lesson from VA: stick to ur principles &amp; be true to urself. That way, if u lose election, u don’t also lose ur identity in the process.
Canary in mine: Last month in S FL, GOP State Rep -who embraced Trump/was on Apprentice- lost special election vs D lady who’d lost 5 races.
Election 2017: historic night for LGBTQ candidates; historic night for A-A candidates; Trump treated like toxic waste...oh, + “peninshula”.

Some applauding Pence act of protest, condemn NFL players exercising same right (NOT on tax-payers' dime). Constitution doesn't cherry-pick.
Republican cannibalism: Trump spanks GOP legislators; Bannon threatens primaries vs those that don't act like trained seals; the base claps.
Pence, NFL players &amp; every American have right to protest. Spending $240k tax-payer money to stage it, that's not a right &amp; it's not right.
