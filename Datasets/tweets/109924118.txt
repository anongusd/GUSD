The US refugee program saves lives.	It helps... 	The child who lost her parents.	The family who saw their home bombed &amp; a government unwilling to help.	The man who fled so he could be with the man he loved w/out fearing for his life.	Let's help them	Is that really so much to ask?
States &amp; communities across every corner of the country are ready to do their part, as generations of Americans have done before. 	It's time that @realDonaldTrump, @SecNielsen, @SecPompeo &amp; Stephen Miller actually listen to the American people who want to step up to do their part
The US Refugee Program isn't a drain on America.	It revitalizes America.	Refugees are doctors, teachers, business leaders, innovators, chefs, business owners... the list goes on and on. Refugees are hardworking, tax-paying, contributing members of our society. #RefugeesWelcome

This year @realDonaldTrump (i.e. Miller again), set the refugee goal at 45,000 (the lowest goal ever), then did nothing to try &amp; reach it. Now they are using that as a reason to cut the goal in half again! Millions are in need, and the US continues to turn away.#WhereRTheRefugees
The Trump Admin. continues to try and pit asylum seekers against refugees. This is a false choice. The US has been a global leader in offering protection to the few who need it AND offering protection to those seeking asylum. We can and must do both. #RefugeesWelcome

Our country has turned away at the worst possible moment. The need has never been greater. Years from now, people will ask "what did you do to help".

In the meantime, thousands of people are kept from safety &amp; home. Refugees aren't able to reunite with family. Refugees who need urgent medical care aren't receiving it. The US has been a historic leader in offering protection to refugees in need. Not anymore. #WhereRtheRefugees?
Congress isn't powerless. They could be calling hearings &amp; conducting far more vigorous oversight to tell the administration: this is unacceptable. This is not the way this program, &amp; our government, is supposed to work. The refugee program is at deep risk... where is Congress?
The President has the power to set the refugee admissions goal. But the law says Congress must be consulted. @realDonaldTrump told Congress they'd seek to resettle 45,000 refugees in FY18. With 2 months left, they haven't even tried to get to half. #WhereRtheRefugees? https://t.co/fj5BUh299F

The refugee program isn't just a life saving program. It's also a job creator. Refugees pay taxes, create jobs, start businesses, bring cultural diversity, open restaurants, serve in our armed forces, and serve in local and national office.  https://t.co/Ntu4D5tAvq
In fact, @realDonaldTrump's COS John Kelly has said he'd prefer that we let in between zero and one refugees into the US! Such a statement should be unacceptable, period. https://t.co/pW9H2WenBc
They set the goal at 45,000 refugees to be admitted this year, the lowest ever. And now, they say they have no intent of even trying to reach even half of this devastatingly lowered goal. Next year, they'd like to lower it even further.
At times of far less need we've done far more. Since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, over 3 million #refugees have found safe haven in America. Yet @realDonaldTrump &amp; Stephen Miller are destroying this lifesaving program. They wont be satisfied until no refugees come here
The US Refugee Resettlement Program is a lifesaving, public-private partnership for #refugees with no other means of finding safety. Fewer than 1% of the world's refugees are ever resettled. The US has been a global leader in the protection of refugees, but that's all at risk.

Indeed, for our Democracy to survive, we must not remain silent. We must speak out. We must challenge that which we do not believe in. https://t.co/j9gk0dtIaB
While we might be stuck with this Administration for a few more years (2020 can't come soon enough) we aren't stuck with letting their lies, alternative facts, and baseless statements go unchecked and unchallenged.
Willing to bet that John Kelly might have a similar story to tell in his family history? The point: immigrants &amp; refugees make our country better - indeed, they make it great. And the dividends of their contributions live long beyond them. https://t.co/Ntu4D5tAvq
Newsflash: That's ridiculous. I have family that came from Italy &amp; Ireland in 19/20th centuries with elementary educations, some of whom didn't speak a lick of English. They went on to work hard, and create a lineage of family that have contributed in countless ways.
His comments don't reflect the America our founders envisioned nor are they remotely reflective of what it means to live in a "modern society". His comments basically presume that if someone has an elementary education and doesn't speak English then they don't belong here. What?!
This Administration's continued attacks on people of every stripe is just baffling. And it is beyond frustrating. John Kelly's remarks about immigrants &amp; family separation... honestly, they should be disqualifying for public service of any kind. https://t.co/YbXK4nvkiW
