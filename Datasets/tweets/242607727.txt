@realDonaldTrump @BobbyJindal Jindal is right though, you can't debate any policy with anyone, too ignorant, arrogant and yes Agly

@realDonaldTrump Bu Jeb has never filed for bankruptcy like you have done, He pays his bills and you don't

@KTNKenya then its a felony  for your dad to seek the presidency for the 3rd time
@SkyNews the Jesus Christ Royals
@ReutersAfrica UK not ready for a black PM
@TheSunNewspaper let her go, who cares? The speaker is a gentleman, He can always get a better one
@ntvkenya this man has been a criminal and will always be a criminal unless he is locked up
@OurRevival Bibi Must know that without america, Israel wont exist, He must respect the American presidency, MUST respect Obama
@OurRevival Netanyahu is a war criminal,
@dailynation He is the most polarizing president the country has ever seen, too secluded to one tribe
@Mosiarah @ntvkenya yap Never, the Regime is so secretive
@ABC @ABCRoyals tired of this royal stuff, as if they are super human
@JoyCTV @CTVNews all these people have nothing better to do than waiting other people's babies!!
@KTNKenya Even the 2017 election is already stolen, No respect bro!
@1010WINS I wonder what kind of knews this is...
@ntvkenya No Kenyan is seeking explanations after all who cares abt Kenyatta's trips?
@CNBC this is a joke!!
@CapitalFM_kenya At least you've realized 99% of MPS are clueless!! How do pple like Sonko legislate, ashame to Kenyan leaders
@UKenyatta @KBCChannel1 security meetings in jordan and yet we have just lost 147 of our own?
@K24Tv the man should be in jail at the moment; but it looks like UhuRuto Regime is on his side that is why he is a free man at the moment
@DWStweets And out of A man God made a woman
@Independent dodgy PM
#GarissaMemorialConcert RIP the 147 fallen ones; but the question remains, why 7 hrs wait for the so called 'rescue team'
@HuffingtonPost No American would ever want a bully in the white house
@StandardKenya The Regime started acting tough by invading another country, thats why we have lost lots of our fellow citizens
@ntvkenya That wont help a thing, many have already bribed their way to attained kenyan passports; you cant deport cotizens
@FaceTheNation @SenJohnMcCain @amyklobuchar Its time Mccain to retire, he gets irrelevant by the day, he wants to cling to power till death
@HuffingtonPost just like the whole country is glad that Mitt Never won the presidency and NEVER will
@CapitalFM_kenya working hard to enrich yourself out of tax payers money...Shame on u bro
@CarolineMutoko I'd rather have FAITH drive me into believing on something I can't rather than both faith and fear
@ntvkenya The closure of that refugee camp might solve this problem, these guys are brought in as refugees only to kill us
@ntvkenya RIP Leah, The response from the regime to rescue you substandard
@LarryMadowo Still the question will always remain, why did it take so long to respond? That must be answered by the regime in power
@SunPolitics cheap politics mr Cameron
@KTNKenya the lunatic's days are numbered
@DomenicoNPR @HillaryClinton @tamarakeithNPR And Jeb Bush has been claiming to be Spanish until he started running for president
@politico2016 @DomenicoNPR It is either you are in or out...stop that decision within days crab
@WilliamsRuto Isn't that what you studied to become a smart lawyer who grabs neighbor's land and steals maize meant for the poor?
@WilliamsRuto You just discovered only that 2 years into your Regime? How about more well trained police who dont loot phones after tragedy
@citizentvkenya This is a testament on how detached, dysfunction and paralyzed this regime is
@SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @PressSec You'll always be the looser Senator McCain, you were reckless and naive thats why you lost to Obama
@NRO Prince George and Prince Jeb, the American Royals
@Newsweek the retirement age MUST be respected, none over 65 can effectively hundle the presidency in this era
@seanhannity @katebrower Yes I always wonder how he managed to turn the economy around and created 22M new jobs and left the country better
@LibDems the war days are over bro!! campaigning against a war that is over shows how out of ideas you are
@TheStarKenya she aught to be ashamed of herself if she said or hasn't said a word about the attack
@AmbassadorRice keep an eye to the president while in Marley's house, remember he loved ganja as a young star..
@TheStarKenya they should be electrocuted
@HuffPostPol I hope Arizonians reject him like America rejected him 2008. Its time to retire....dont be too greedy
@K24Tv @Remmymajala @chegetm inherited insecurity from who? Jubilee leaders were all from the previous government....
@KTNKenya So why are u still with him?
@VBessler true
@VBessler I doubt if she did that, that is just propaganda
@thedailybeast that has nothing to do with her running for president
@StandardKenya is that news????
@AmbassadorRice while America stood aside and watched
@TheStarKenya so what?
@StandardKenya thats stupid stuff to report, there are important stuff to report instead of this gabbage...
@StandardKenya thats silly
@LadyOnTheRight1 He thought the republican congress could act on it, since they refused, be had to do something abt it...NOT AMNESTY
@LadyOnTheRight1 Is executive order by the president illegal? I thought it was one of the powers any president have
@LadyOnTheRight1 Becca, you are trying to twist the true meaning of the word 'amnesty'. Amnesty is what Reagan and the Republicans in 80s
@LadyOnTheRight1 @ScottWalker you think she is not qualified?
@LadyOnTheRight1 @ScottWalker True, but none of the republicans have questioned her qualifications but have refused to confirm her.
@ScottWalker And 47 years later Scott Walker and the Republicans oppose the first Minority woman to be the attorney General
@AnnCoulter @oreillyfactor so what?
@KTNKenya "I did not have any relationship with that woman, Ray C", Kikwete.
@dailynation @HassanAliJoho You MUST RESIGN U ARROGANT THIEF
@rose_ngahu @MissKiama87 @AngelaAngwenyi @HerboTawa @NationFMKe we are better off being colonized than seing the chosen few stealing from us
@WanjiraKamau @KoinangeJeff @JulieGichuru its not about dwelling in the past but trying to understand who really the man is.
@WanjiraKamau @KoinangeJeff @JulieGichuru its absolutely relevant bcos it defines who he is as a man and what really drives him
@WanjiraKamau @KoinangeJeff @JulieGichuru Any Idea why he was fired from CNN?
@Ed_Miliband you got my vote bro
@CitizenTVNew he just discovered that an apology is need after 2 yrs in office....
