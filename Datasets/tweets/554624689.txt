Souls will be saved in the name of Jesus because we are not a loveless  church (Rev 2:1-7) Stay from people who pursue these ungodly and deadly habits as God's glory shines through purpose &gt; (Rev 3:1-6) #faith #love #power #obedience
Free us from the corrupted church (Rev 2:18-29) and let the church say Amen.
Deliver us from the compromised church (Rev 2:12-17)
Dear God, give us divine protection over human souls. Let us hear what the Spirit says to the church as little lambs/cubs. Help us from a persecuted church. (Rev 2:8-11).
Y'all really need to evict satan out of the church. He's been residing in the church for 2000 yrs. Paid no rent. Just steals alot of souls.

The crime is having the peep camera and is being extremely  ignored for a laughable reality show, while people are flaunting their new found wealth while people are suffering.
There are so many important issues to focus on. What I wear everyday should not be an issue. This is not normal!
The amount of time it took them to release that information, the same time they could have reached out to their kids that are alive. #smh
That doesn't make sense! One day, for the first time, I decided to wear a body slimmer because of the dress I was wearing shows my love handles. The wanna be's who are trying to steal my shine said I was covering my stomach of the erroneous abortion count they created. Crazy!
Phone calls and emails are obstructed to harm. This is political interference.
Everyday there's a selfish effort to take away a women's femininity, her reproductive rights, and her quality of life from the lens of something negative. This needs to stop and it will stop.
When will they turn the camera on themselves?

Quit saying every false scenario is damaged. Just confess you spent someone's money.
Right now, we see candidates that might not fit into a tradition profile of an election.  But because of their party's unity, regardless of their issues, they have a strong unified front to support their candidates.  It's about winning seats.
The Trump name cannot alone win every election for every Republican  candidate. The party has unity to win for all candidates.  This is how you revive your base or the base party.
If a party is divided by feelings, cults, &amp; affiliations then there's no unity.The devil is clever. If he causes disunity, the other party wins, then the Republican candidates are left feeling unappreciative or unwanted by their own party. If you have a unified front, we all win.
The problem is we have people who are looking in the lenses of a sexual predator. Everything to them is sexual in tone because that's who they are. They want everyone to believe what the believe, see, or hear.

Biblical justification regardless of a histroic event: 	1. Matthew 22:37-40	2. Acts 3:19	3. Exodus 20:13	4. Mark 12:7-10- Greed has led to many perishing. This would be ungodly justification. 	5. Genesis 12:3- Your trust in God's promises is biblical justification to confirm evil

I move forward in my constitutional rights, with my loved ones in thought, that are no longer with us. Because of this decade-long war that was senseless and unbiblical. Let's stay with the facts a d issues  that needs to be addressed.
I think it's insensitive to be unapologetic of the tragedies that have taken place. How can one state be open-minded, than the other? Maybe, they don't know the magnitude of sin, and to be blinded by lust?  Maybe these shegnagains are healing blockers to see truth?
Some of these attacks have nothing to do with me and everything to do with alliances and love /lust relationships.This is unfair. This has nothing to do with me. It strips the state and districts of real change.
Second, A candidate comes back to serve their state, with promises of support, only to be fronted with outdated issues and personal attacks of distractions, only to have a witch hunt of disqualification. Some of these attacks are dangerous and frivolous.
First, I'm tired of @bjakes1 worried about what doors opens for me in my home state, only to have them closed from ppl who fear him. This is sickening. Enough! My life goes on. This is a ten year effort everyday, EVERYDAY.w/no actions of repenting. Biblical justification?

This is crazy! The mechanic said to drive the car 60-70 miles, so it can pass emissions. He gave proof of the repairs and the time it's been in the repair shop. You've failed to mention the car sat because it was descending down the highway. Witch hunt!
However, I will not start any projects under the scope. This isn't fair.
