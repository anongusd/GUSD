Hugo Ruiz eats a huge right hook from Gervonta Davis, thinks about it for a second, then goes down to one knee. Great shot, better stoppage by the ref. TKO-1 @Gervontaa #DavisRuiz
Yeah Gervonta Davis is still really really really good #DavisRuiz

@watfordpodcast Just started asking me the score of the game, which he clearly had seen already. It's OK. They're in League 2, we're in the Champions League places.
So many good middleweight fights are possible, especially if Canelo can beat GGG in a rubber match. Jacobs, Saunders, Charlie and even Hurd are waiting. #CaneloGGG
Official scores: 114-114, 115-113x2 for Canelo. Probably a fair result. Last round could have easily gone to Canelo on my card. A new legend is born. All respect to Golovkin, a true champion. #CaneloGGG2
Wow. That was a championship fight kids. Amazing efforts from	both champions. Last round was brutal. I gave it to GGG, making this a draw on my card 114-114. Let‚Äôs see it again. #CaneloGGG2
Canelo fades early in the 11th then rallies, but GGG still wins the round. I‚Äôve got it 105-104 going into the final round #CaneloGGG2
They are killing each other in there. Golovkin rocks Canelo in the 10th with a right hand and appeared to hurt him temporarily. 96-94 Canelo but this fight is still there for the taking. #CaneloGGG2
Fight is really heating up. 9th is close again but Canelo took it for me. 87-84 Alvarez #CaneloGGG2
Close 8th Alvarez slows down a bit at the end and lets Golovkin steal it. 77-75 Canelo Alvarez still in control. #CaneloGGG2
Canelo just looks more effective in there tonight. His left hook and left uppercut to the body are slowing Golovkin down. GGG only really landing the jab and occasional right hand. 68-65 Canelo after 7. #CaneloGGG2
Close 6th but I give it to Canelo. He‚Äôs up 58-56 halfway through the fight. Golovkin looks like the body shots are taking a toll. Or he‚Äôs getting old fast. #CaneloGGG2
Canelo with great bodywork and head movement, looks like the sharper fighter so far tonight. He‚Äôs up 48-47 on my card after 5 Rds. #CaneloGGG2
Canelo is moving forward, GGG is circling. 4th goes to Alvarez, 38-38 after 4 Rds. #CaneloGGG2
Neither of these guys is trying to fight 12 rounds. They‚Äôre both trying to win early. #CaneloGGG2
GGG looks to have stolen the 3rd but close round with lots of slipped punches on both sides. Canelo looks better overall but down 29-28 after 3 #CaneloGGG2
Canelo lands some good body shots and takes the second to square the fight after 2: 19-19 #CaneloGGG2
Canelo with a nice left hook to the chin and then a right hand. Golovkin sticking with the jab in Rd 2 #CaneloGGG2
Canelo was aggressive with body shots but Golovkin wins the 1st with his jab. 10-9 GGG #CaneloGGG2
GGG using the jab well but Canelo not surrendering ground early. Looks like this will be an action fight. #CaneloGGG2

@digital25 Well deserved Gary. Hope all is well.
Swift Jarrett Hurd of Accoceek, Maryland is now the 154-lb unified champion of the world. Earns split decision over Erislandy Lara in Vegas with a last-round knockdown 114-113, 113-114, 114-113 #LaraHurd @Swift_JHurd
Hurd always comes on late. The kid has so much heart. Whatever the cards say, he showed he is a champion tonight. @Swift_JHurd @SHOsports #LaraHurd
That knockdown should do it. Hurd wins it on my card 115-112. A draw would have been fair until the knockdown. Of course who knows what the judges will do. #LaraHurd
Hurd knockdown Lara in the 12th!!
Great 11th, very close. Hurd is slowing but pushing through. Lara still sharp and accurate with the left hand. I have it 105-104 Hurd with one round left. #LaraHurd
Lara fights back in the 10th but Hurd takes it on my card with his early work. I have the fight tied 95-95 with two rounds left. This has been a great fight, interesting contrast of styles. #LaraHurd
Hurd pouring it on in the 9th. Lara has a swollen eye and his legs look heavy. If Hurd keeps up this pressure the pipe could burst #LaraHurd
Very good 8th from Hurd he needs to keep up the pressure
Quiet 7th from Hurd he might be feeling it a bit. Lara boxed well, if he stays in the middle of the ring he will probably win. #LaraHurd
Lara nicks the 6th I have him leading 58-56 halfway through. Hurd has been attacking the busy all night it should start paying off soon.
Lara sharped in the 5th, edges ahead 48-47. Hurd still doggedly in pursuit. #LaraHurd
Hurd goes to work in the 4th as Lara takes a breather. I have this even after 4 rounds. #LaraHurd @SHOsports
Jarrett Hurd‚Äôs greatest asset is his work ethic, it‚Äôs how he got here. Lara doesn‚Äôt want this level of action for 12 rounds #LaraHurd
Lara looks sharper early inside but he should stay on the outside. Hurd is very strong and has a great uppercut, can wear down opponents #LaraHurd
Lara finding a home for his left hand early. Hurd is gonna get lit up if he doesn‚Äôt start using his jab to close distance #LaraHurd
Of Hurd getting tagged early with the left #HurdLara
Hurd is a lot bigger but Lara knows how to fight taller foes
@fightingwords2 Yeah they could have definitely shown this fight on Showtime Extreme
Dislcaimer: I'm not objective, but Hurd has a good chance. Lara is very skilled but he has trouble against longer boxers. Hurd is very solid defensively and has enough power to keep the Cuban at bay. Hurd by close decision or late KO. #LaraHurd @SHOsports https://t.co/od9lkBVVNl
Congrats to Gary and BATB, which has done as much to build the DMV fight scene as anyone outside the ring https://t.co/ovVUSjHSms
Having covered Jarrett Hurd more and longer than any reporter save @digital25, it would truly be something to see him beat Erislandy Lara tonight and clearly establish himself as the best junior middleweight in the world. #LaraHurd @SHOsports @Swift_JHurd

Donovan Mitchell is just silly. He‚Äôs already one of the best clutch players in the NBA as a rookie and he‚Äôs just getting started. @spidadmitchell
To be clear, this was the best fight of Deontay Wilder‚Äôs career. He showed heart and determination against a very good opponent. But he does not look complete enough to beat Anthony Joshua without landing a lucky right hand. #WilderOrtiz
Sugar Ray Robinson he is not, but man Deontay Wilder gets the job done. Now 40-0, 39 KOs #WilderOrtiz #bombsquad
Wilder hurts Ortiz with a counter right. Then a few wild punches puts the Cuban down. Right uppercut finishes it and Deontay Wilder closes the show. TKO-10 Wilder #WilderOrtiz
Wilder showing fortitude himself by rallying in the 9th. This has turned into an excellent heavyweight fight. Wilder clearly just a one-two fighter, albeit one with incredible power. Ortiz has more variety and it shows. #WilderOrtiz
Wilder looks spent in the 8th he needs to land another big right hand or this will be over soon #WilderOrtiz
Ortiz showing tremendous heart in Brooklyn tonight to get off canvas and take control of this fight #WilderOrtiz
Ortiz rocks Wilder in the 7th and pours it on for the last 40 seconds. Wilder looked out on his feet. Momentum has swung completely on a counter right hook to the point of Wilder‚Äôs chin. Ortiz firmly back in control. #WilderOrtiz
Ortiz understandably cautious in the 6th but Wilder more aggressive and well, wild. 57-56 Ortiz halfway through the fight. Wilder coming on but he gets reckless and is open to the counter. #WilderOrtiz
Ortiz needs to rally quick in 6th or this will be over fast #WilderOrtiz
there it is Wilder lands a straight right and downs Ortiz at the end of the 5th. Ortiz looks hurt. This is why we will pay to watch Deontay Wilder. #WilderOrtiz
Wilder finally starts throwing the right behind the double jab but Ortiz still controlling distance &amp; landing the harder shots. 40-36 Ortiz after 4 rounds. #WilderOrtiz
No one has landed anything big yet but Ortiz is more in control and his bodywork should tell ok Wilder‚Äôs legs of the fight goes deep. 3-0 Ortiz.
Wilder looks a little unsteady and Ortiz is very calm in the pocket. Ortiz has better timing, allows him to negate Wilder‚Äôs longer reach. Wilder needs to jab and counter with the left hook. #WilderOrtiz
Thought Ortiz looked a little sharper in the 1st but these scores should be academic. One of these two is gonna walk into a straight punch. Ortiz working the body well. #WilderOrtiz
Good matchup of undefeated heavyweight contenders on @HBOboxing right now. Picking Deontay Wilder with the right hand KO. #WilderOrtiz

South Indian Cooking tips from Periamma:	1. Don‚Äôt fry till oil is really hot	2. Put turmeric in everything	3.

Lunch time. Apparently the top end of the banana leaf is the dank part, which is why it costs more at the market than the middle or bottom. The top should always be on your left when you eat. üçöü•óüçÖüçó https://t.co/FxcaZPaj28 https://t.co/YwCHvCH9YB

Have enormous respect for Lamont Peterson, who has pulled off his share of upsets. But Errol Spence looks like the real deal, the kind of fighter who will someday top the pound-for-pound list. Picking Spence on points. #SpencePeterson
RIP to Walt Swanston Nueva-Espana, a lovely woman who did more to advance diversity in newsrooms than any of us. Her warmth &amp; encouragement at monthly NABJ roundtables in DC was one of the reasons I stayed in journalism. She will be missed https://t.co/HtX5Q9Tv5w

We all lose, we all get knocked down sometimes. Mike Reed is still a great fighter, and one of my favorites to cover. Whatever he does next, he will be a success. @YesIndeed_Reed #RamirezReed https://t.co/9EfJKh9wKf
Jose Ramirez stops Mike Reed in the 2nd round. Hurts him with a right hand then two knockdowns from constant combinations. Ramirez was too big and too much pressure, Reed couldn't handle the barrage. #RamirezReed https://t.co/iDyuAY5OcZ
Beterbiev finally scores a knockdown and stoppage in the 12th round. Chalk it up. Time for #RamirezReed. Haven't seen much of Ramirez but Reed is good, though he faces a hostile crowd &amp; maybe hometown judges.
Beterbiev coming straight ahead with his jab. Keeling has nothing to dissuade him. This all feels so cold and impersonal.
TV fights on @espn about to start. My neighbor @LukieBoxing on press row says Enrico Koelling looked scared of @ABeterbiev at the press conference. That just means he's smart. This fight is just a potential highlight reel KO for Beterbiev.
Almost a full house already tonight at Fresno State university to see local favorite Jose Ramirez. Vocal crowd enjoying undercard, will be a tough fight for Mike Reed. Nothing like being back at ringside after more than a year. https://t.co/RTdbFuLfcI
