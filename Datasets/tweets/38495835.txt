Another dangerous criminal apprehended by law enforcement! Congratulations to law enforcement once again! Perhaps the media &amp; the Left will finally tone down their campaign against our police. But I doubt it.
My solution to the illegal alien caravan: since Trudeau has opened Canada to illegal aliens,Trump can ask Trudeau how many caravan travelers he wants &amp; put them on Greyhound buses to Canada.This way, everyone’s satisfied. 😊
Why was this criminal, who sent all these packages, out of prison? Criminal justice reform? Instead, how about more law &amp; order. And as an ex-felon &amp; future felon, I assume he’ll get to vote one day, right? Let’s hope not. That’s another absurd idea.

TONIGHT ON LEVINTV, THE LEFT IS FURIOUS WITH TRUMP’S ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY BECAUSE THEY WANT AMERICA TO HAVE OPEN BORDERS.	https://t.co/K1ngwPpniZ https://t.co/AqOuybRsVT
As predicted ... https://t.co/qIRFnP6sJo
By demanding amnesty and refusing to secure the southern border, the open borders Democrats and their media propagandists, joined by RINOs, are incentivizing lawlessness, chaos, and the human misery that comes with it.
It is the Obama administration that schizophrenically separated from adults and detained some illegal alien minors, but also allowing illegal alien adults and children accompanying them into the country without upholding immigration law.
It was the Clinton administration that settled a lawsuit in 1997 resulting in the release from detention of illegal alien kids in 20 days, thereby separating them from the adults who are being processed through the immigration system.
The open borders Democrats and media policy: if you’re an alien adult and come to our country illegally with a child, you’re welcome here.
