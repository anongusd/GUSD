@Steve_Taylor_DC @rollcall @CQnow Same - please do submit one. I cannot guarantee its publication, but I will lobby the decision makers on your behalf.
@Steve_Taylor_DC @rollcall @CQnow My article does not say that every single charity is doing as well as every other. I'm sure they would all like more $. But when giving has risen about as much as it has in any other recent year, and indeed is up more than the rate of inflation, I think the headline is fair.
@Steve_Taylor_DC @rollcall @CQnow Blackbaud data indicates some sectors and smaller charities are lagging bigger ones, but they are up, and the overall up is more than the Fundraising Effectiveness Project has it. Let's call a spade a spade: The doomsday scenario has not happened.
@Steve_Taylor_DC @rollcall @CQnow The Fundraising Effectiveness Project says it surveys 18,000 nonprofits and that overall giving is running 2.6% ahead of 2017 through Q3 -- that's flush considering that charities were expecting a drop in giving because of the increased standard deduction in the 2017 tax law.
