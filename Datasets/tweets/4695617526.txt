@IlhanMN I'm a bigot? That's a dangerous word to throw around. The only bigot here is Ilhan Omar.
@IlhanMN Ilhan Omar is like a child, albeit, a dangerous, antisemitic one. We should just ignore her, stop giving her the attention she so desperately craves and make sure she loses the next election.
@RepTedDeutch It's terrible that the Congressman even needs to say this. The naive excuses no longer hold up. Ilhan Omar is an antisemite who is stirring up dangerous rhetoric and age old stereotypes about Jews. She wants to get the media's attention. We should just ignore her.
@IlhanMN Posting an article from #alJazeera, a #Qatar government funded and state run so-called media outlet doesn't carry much water or weight...
@TeamPelosi @AOC @IlhanMN @JahanaHayesCT @RollingStone I have to say that it's offensive that you are posting this tweet, while saying nothing about the most recent anti-Semitic trope that Ilhan Omar just made about those of us who are Jewish and the claim of allegiance to a foreign power.

@BernieUpstateNY @TheJeffGoldman @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY Antifa are defenders? Is that a joke. They are violent thugs.
@BernieUpstateNY @TheJeffGoldman @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY And the truth comes out. You are now calling Jews Nazis. You've proved my point, the fringe left is just as racist and anti-Semitic as the fringe right.
@BernieUpstateNY @TheJeffGoldman @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY And what would you say about the far left supporting Farrakhan who invited violence and hate against Jews? Is that any different?
@BernieUpstateNY @TheJeffGoldman @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY And the far left is abandoning America's greatest Ally, Israel, making false claims about the so called occupation of the Palestinians. The far left is supporting antisemites like Farrakhan. What's your point? Both sides are screwed up.
@BernieUpstateNY @TheJeffGoldman @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY You are actually trying to educate two Jews about Nazis.
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY But those very loud voices on the far left and right are using scare tactics to fear monger, making American's think false enemies are lurking around every dark corner trying to destroy their way of life. If we don't watch it, we're going to destroy our 'shining city on the hill'
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY Wish I shared your optimism. But both extremes want to censor &amp; destroy the other. Patriotism, it doesn't mean we turn a blind eye to the problems that afflict us, but it does mean we still celebrate our greatness. The lack of it is putting our American way of life at risk.
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY I have a feeling it's going to get worse on both sides, before it gets better
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY Or, the country will just continue to become more divided and fooled by the false saviors from both sides. At the end of the day when you go extreme left or extreme right, they end up meeting each other and are the same. It's like comparing fascists to communists.
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY I don't know. Antifa vs Alt-right. They are both scary choices üòÇ
@TheJeffGoldman @BernieUpstateNY @GiancarloSopo @USATODAY I don't think it's a huge gift for anyone. We need centrists in both parties to work together and compromise. That's what the founding fathers intended and while both parties become more extreme, it's the American people that lose.
@GiancarloSopo @USATODAY Well done! Hopefully the Party starts to realize they are moving down a dangerous path that will only serve to backfire on them eventually if they don't move back towards the center.

@Ocasio2018 Actually you are running from the far left and the scary thing is that you have no idea what that even means. There is a big difference between campaigning and governing. Stirring the pot with no understanding of the legislative process is dangerous &amp; will only get you so far.
Don't get me wrong, I love my Italian shoes. 		But this socialist takes the cake, apparently Alexandria #OcasioCortez doesn't buy American üá∫üá∏. Her worn out campaign shoes were made in Portugal... Oops, great job @Ocasio2018 https://t.co/5DQa6lXhKe
@Ocasio2018 @SalazarSenate18 Leftist socialist democrats like you all have ruined the party and forced former democrats like me to run as fast and as far away as possible. So, if the far right has ostracized half the country, democrats like you have ostracized the other half.
@ArielElyseGold It has nothing to do with your activism for Palestinian human rights but everything to do with your advocating of a boycott of Israel and causing harm to its economy. Why should they let you in? Makes absolutely no sense. Hope you enjoyed the airport üòÇ
@codepink @ArielElyseGold Well done üáÆüá±. She just serves to harm the Jewish state and encourage boycotting and hurting its economy.
@GiancarloSopo This couldn't be scarier. It's the far right vs the far left with nothing in between and no chance of responsible compromise. Not the way the founding fathers intended.

@Dana2B @ACLU @MarcACaputo @RepAdamSchiff A US Congressman should never meet with an individual that is under investigation and will most likely be arrested. Assange will likely have his day in court. In the meantime, WikiLeaks is doing their best to manipulate the media and fight his case in the court of public opinion.
On this #MemorialDay weekend. Let us honor those heroes who died defending our nation and freedom and democracy throughout the world. Let us honor the greatness #America https://t.co/D0aES0Rq7P
@wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU Apparently I hit a nerve @wikileaks. You all are aware that his arrest is pending, as soon as he walks out of that embassy. You  also know that he violated section 793 of the Espionage Act and now you are trying to twist the media to fight his battle ahead of a potential trial.
@debbiedoo131 @wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU The Supreme Court has ruled over and over that free speech has its limits. It's not ironclad, especially when classified documents are leaked or even when someone yells fire in a movie theater. It's not a guarantee. Section 793 of the Espionage Act makes this clear.
@FreeThought84 @wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU Section 793 of the Espionage Act is quite clear. A violater can be imprisoned for 10-20 years. And while this hasn't been used often, in this case, the government can charge him and prosecute his case in a court of law.
@wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU The 1st amendment protects up to a point but it does have its limits. It becomes irrelevant when classified US documents are released that put US assets in danger. It's not legally ironclad as evidenced by multiple court rulings.
@wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU Plus Assange is not a journalist and #WikiLeaks is not a news organization, making it easier to charge him under the Espionage Act.
@wikileaks @MarcACaputo @ACLU Julian Assange and #WikiLeaks put lives in danger by publishing top secret US documents and he should be tried in a court of law.
@MarcACaputo @ACLU You didn't collude with the Russian government to meddle in a US election &amp; potentially put US national security at risk. Also, if he broke the law to get the information he leaked, that's illegal as well. There are four ways to Sunday that he should be tried in a court of law.
@ACLU @MarcACaputo If Russia uses Assange and WikiLeaks intermediaries to release hacked emails and meddle in the US presidential election, then he should be prosecuted.

@GiancarloSopo I'm probably the first one to frame the argument this way...
@GiancarloSopo I couldn't agree more. This is another example of Americans telling other nations what is best for them. When we do this it has serious ramifications because we create animosity towards America, helping to prop up leftist dictators which use that to their advantage.
@GiancarloSopo Latinx is so ridiculous, I don't even know where to begin. Changing linguistics in this way makes me think of those that attempt to whitewash history and the real danger of these practices.

@ejmarkow @YehudaJFriedman @TimesofIsrael My ethnicity is Jewish, but I'm an American. If I was a concentration camp guard, I'd still be considered American. But the reality is that no one is trying to attack modern day Poland, the issue is an historic one that the Polish far right is trying to whitewash history.
@ejmarkow @YehudaJFriedman I'd say he is a Polish American until his citizenship was taken away. His country and nation was Poland, despite being Ukranian. If a Jewish American oppressed or killed people, they would be considered American because that is their nation.
@ejmarkow @YehudaJFriedman Correct. Which means that the Ukranians in Poland were still Polish. As are Americans who make up all kinds of different ethnicities.
@ejmarkow @YehudaJFriedman So Jakiw Palij is still Polish. He's Ukrainian Polish.
@YehudaJFriedman @ejmarkow So are Colombian or Cuban Americans ethnically not American but instead only hold US citizenship? Your argument is fallacious.

@Ojdadana @Agent_00PL @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum Even Lech Walesa apologized https://t.co/5x2PeeeTB0
@Agent_00PL @Ojdadana @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum Of course he says that because the Poles want to whitewash history. It's abhorrent actually.

@Agent_00PL @Ojdadana @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum Let's start with the Kielce pogrom in 1946, the Krakow pogrom in 1945.
@Agent_00PL @Ojdadana @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum That may be true. But the Polish people did in fact go after the Jews.
@Jano_Top @karolkasm @AuschwitzMuseum @YehudaJFriedman @AmbWittig @GermanyinUSA Reverting to name calling when you know you are peddling fallacious history about the Polish complicity in the Holocaust and how they happily helped cart Jews to concentration camps.

@karolkasm @NadaLewa @YehudaJFriedman @AmbWittig @GermanyinUSA Stop judging? Poles that killed, raped and beat Jews. The craziest part is that many resisted Germany but still chose to go after Jews. So forgive menfor judging these animals.

@Ojdadana @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum Sure. Look at the Atlantic as well as the Washington Post.

@BlueMoon085 @YehudaJFriedman @karolkasm @AmbWittig @GermanyinUSA While poles we're fighting the occupation, at the same time, Polish police worked with Germans as it relating to persecuting Jews. There's no doubt that you all are right wing antisemites trying to whitewash history.
@davidmweissman No doubt David, all of that needs to be taken into consideration. I agree with you.
@NadaLewa @YehudaJFriedman @karolkasm @AmbWittig @GermanyinUSA That makes no sense. I grew up in America. I'd risk my life for all my people, Jews, African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Haitians, you name it. You are quite wrong. But underneath your words, especially when you use goy (a word I don't use) there's no doubt, you're an antisemite.
@Ojdadana @haaretzcom @AuschwitzMuseum 'Ethnic Poles were the primary perpetrators in approximately 25 percent of the pogroms (killing, raping and beating Jews)'

@iamwhoiamnana @LouisFarrakhan Your facts are wrong and your arguments are fallacious. You're the racist.
@politico @POLITICOMag Loyalty isn't a one way street. To have longevity in politics, it must go both ways. To gain respect you must prove loyalty to those you employ, to those that serve the nation. Without that, you have nothing and your aides will turn at some point, that's just a political reality.
@jaketapper @ItaiBardov Right on Jake, you hit it on the nose. Thanks for standing up to bigotry, no matter where it stems from. Left or right, it's all abhorrent.
@iamwhoiamnana @LouisFarrakhan You are clueless and just like your antisemitic leader, you are spewing lies and falsehoods. That's dangerous.
@iamwhoiamnana @LouisFarrakhan Get your facts straight. The immigration issue has absolutely nothing to do with Ethiopian Jews, they were all brought to Israel by the government. The issue at hand is influx of illegal immigration of those from African nations who snuck into Israel through the Egyptian border.
@LouisFarrakhan You're a jackass, albeit a dangerous one. You're words cause hate and hate breeds violence. By the way, we love our Ethiopian brothers and sisters, and despite your lies, we made sure they were safely brought to #Israel. I don't normally speak this way, but you suck Farrakhan.

@LTCPeterLerner @POTUS While I'm not sure I agree, we can't take away the reality that Peter has been on the ground and speaks from an experience and perspective that many of us lack.
@FergHodgson @Pontifex I agree, freedom of religion is imperative and people have the right to freely express it. I have no issue with the Catholic religion, my religion as well, if you read it literally, also calls these sins. But there are many in both religions who do not subscribe to those beliefs.
@FergHodgson @Pontifex Again, if any religious school from every faith fired someone who commits a biblical sin, the the workplace would be empty. But let's agree to disagree.
@david4florida Should someone committing adultery also be fired? If so-called sins in the Bible were grounds for dismissal, no one would have a job.
@FergHodgson @Pontifex It's a private school, so as long as she isn't sharing her personal life with students or not teaching the curriculum of the school, then it's irrelevant. Should someone committing adultery also be fired? If sins in the Bible were grounds for dismissal, no one would have a job.
@FergHodgson @Pontifex It's a sin if you are an Orthodox Jew as well, but that doesn't stop the majority of Jews in the US who aren't Orthodox supporting equal rights and not being discriminated against in the workplace.

@AdamMilstein @UN They have confirmed but what have they done? They spend far too much time admonishing the Democratic nation of Israel and ignore real threats and authoritarian and dangerous regimes like Iran.
It saddens me that we live in an age, a political climate that has lost any inkling of civility. Nothing monumental can be done, no compromises can be made and nothing accomplished that has any real meaning if we don't address this elephant in the room. Enough is enough.
@GlennaOn10 @MarioDB @WPLGLocal10 It's a pragmatic move. If he attacks the President it does nothing to ensure the DACA children are protected.

@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Since Jews aren't a race, that's a confusing statement ;)
@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Agree, we need to hold leaders accountable, not fighting you. But the line is thin, the false #Israel narrative was created by anti-Semites
@noga4811 @sober_ginger @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Criticism of the Israeli government  if it's done fairly, but the anti Israel rhetoric isn't fair it's anti-Semitic hidden under a veil
@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post That anti-Semitism &amp; anti Israel aren't linked. If you can't recognize that media bias exists, then there's nothing I can say 2 persuade you
@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Because I believe in fairness, no that you didn't say... but much of what you say is a false narrative created by anti-Semites
@RogerJStoneJr All I can say @RogerJStoneJr is Oy Vey. They're ganging up on you the same way the media gangs up on #Israel
@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Agree. But slanted anti-Semitic media bias is unacceptable. You're being fooled by fallacious narrative created by extremists in Arab world
@JamesRosenTV @thebeatles @SIRIUSXM James, I'll be sure to tune in! Just steer clear of #BackInTheUSSR ;)

@sober_ginger @noga4811 @ArtemisEnodia @Jerusalem_Post Au Contraire. While it's appropriate to hold Israeli leaders accountable, the blatant media bias is abhorrent and created by our enemies.

@KellsDTells @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye I don't need to prove myself to you but if anyone is a friend of mine on my Facebook, they can search my wall.
@KellsDTells @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye For both. I was a lifelong democrat, now NPA but support folks on both sides. #Bipartisanship matters!
@AmandaRenteria I agree @AmandaRenteria. #Bipartisanship matters!
@AGBecerra I couldn't agree more @AGBecerra! #defendDACA
@KellsDTells @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye The answer is Yes, I called out many.

@KellsDTells @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye There are plenty of posts on my facebook making clear that Obama should not be personally attacked.

@antonio_hickman @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye WRONG
@realDonaldTrump @angela_rye I said the same thing about President @BarackObama and disagreed with much of his policy. I believe in our Democracy &amp; our electoral system.
@antonio_hickman @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye WRONG. I did and defended those who did the same thing. I don't have to agree with my President or like them but they are still my Pres.
@justjalina @angela_rye it's dangerous when anyone suggests that we don't accept that a democratically elected President is not OUR President. That's the issue.

@beekaayy Every US President is my President.
@StraightG408 @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye But you acknowledge the reality no matter where you stand. We must accept our elections, once we stop that becomes dangerous to Democracy.
@eifjaydeux @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye Did I say where I fall politically? I just said that he is still YOUR President and if you are a US citizen or resident. That's CIVICS 101.
@HustleBunnee @realDonaldTrump @angela_rye @BarackObama Yes I did, I say it about every President.
