@fmtoday An old time politician who had some good principles is going wayward . Forgetting old friends n becoming racial is turning the clock .  Good time for the allies to form a new alliance . PH needs good critics n opposition  to perform better !
@ShahrilHamdan We need a legislation to put an end to politics of race !
@malaysiakini Are we reaching this stage ?
@mkini_bm BN should fear Pakatan ‘s strength . We can do it  !

@MeetThePress @MarkWarner Very well put Senator. !
@niknazmi The Bumiputras can be taken care of other then Umno n Pas !
@fmtoday But u can’t run this country with just votes from one race !
@Independent That’s the question all Commonwealth countries should ask Teresa May !
@Independent That is the true image of Trump !
@theborneopost Very good move . High time the Federal Government does that too !
@Suara_Rakyat7 Pas will ally with any party that will make it strong !
@mkini_bm This happened in Cameron’s too ! Will this be the trend ? What will PH do to fight this future trend ?
@malaysiakini What about race n religion ? Din’t that play a big part ?
@malaymail PH losing Symnyeh is only a temporary setback . Carry on doing what is necessary n what has been promised .PH will surely win in Pru 15.
@fmtoday Some voters don’t think that way . Their impatience is being exploited by the opposition !
@malaysiakini Looks like PH lost some Indian votes to BN .  Indians need lots of help especially the poor n the stateless . This must be addressed soon for PH to be on firmer ground .
@malaymail The payment made through a third party maybe !
@politico Kelaynne defends Trump blindly !
@CNNPolitics His Master’s voice !
@realDonaldTrump As parents they will feel it . U are now siding the Korean guy !
@washingtonpost Family deceptions !
@malaymail Johore should endeavour to have sufficient water supply n cut off depending on Singapore !
@malaysiakini PAS guys like high n good life.  !

@fmtoday Corruption prone but not corrupted as yet !
@saladinMY These are the things that should be publisised !
@JonLemire His style does not suit foreign diplomacy ?
@staronline Because he was honest ha2 !
@NBCNews So maybe Trump is not revealing the whole truth !
@NST_Online Bossku for only those who took dedak !
@malaymail Bossku or celebrity kleptocract ?
@MalaysiaGazette We cannot compare u with the calon ! He is simple n honest but u are a celebrity kleptocract !
@malaysiakini What about Pencuri ku  !
@malaymail U are very right Tun. !
@hwabeng @sarawak_report So the 90 million is real !
@limkitsiang Race n religion seems to be the order of the day . N may continue until the next elections. !
@malaymail Celebrity Pencuri. !
@washingtonpost Cohen was Trump ‘s lawyer for ten years!
@Newsweek Wasn’t it Trump inspired ?
@politico Trump style of threats ? Isn’t this a form of obstruction ?
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak U should apologise for many more things !
@politico What about a responsible President Trump tax returns ?
@Khairykj This guy may know something about the 105 million !
@ernamh What about Cap Pencuri ?
@NBCNews They were just used to promote Trump ‘s Golf Course !
@staronline What about Cap Pencuri
@fmtoday Bilari is just a frontman for the Government ! He should be on the lookout for Singapore Baru  come their next election!
@fmtoday This guy is criticising the government but does he know the baggage he is carrying ?
@malaysiakini What about a cap pencuri ?
@washingtonpost Why?
@MalaysiaGazette Any excuse for these no gooders to create a faracas.
@fmtoday It is nonsense n a naughty statement . There will thousands who will use the road . It is a pity that the previous government never thought of this ?
@ABC Your story !
@malaymail What is MCA waiting for ?
@malaymail What about those racists n those who use religion ?
@anwaribrahim I think there should not be any increase in charge .!
@saifuddinabd Are all UmNO leaders like this or will the party continue to be racist ? The government must stop this legislatively at least !
@realDonaldTrump Favourite. ?
@malaymail I believe they may support Tun only in Parliament !
@DailySabah Then what was US n NATO forces doing in Afghanistan ?
@malaysiakini Yes . Enjoy this celebrity !
@CGTNOfficial Don’t play with the lives of people !
@mkini_bm See how a husband publicises his wife ! How long  will this voice be heard  ?
@daxmuhamad For the moment it is a good decision !
@MalaysiaGazette Pas is now a party of confusion ! Can we trust them ?
@realDonaldTrump Trump will soon be history !
@staronline MCA has always been a lackey party. No voice at all . Now u talk n demand too much . Did u ever listen to the raayat ?
@malaysiakini EE too Brutus !
@MalaysiaGazette Najib should know that he is a celebrity or notorious because of 1 MDB.
@fmtoday Removing toll or reducing toll is part of the manifesto. Nothing wrong in making the announcement now !
@washingtonpost The wall !
@MalaysiaGazette Look at this ! Whom is this Minister telling this story ?
@PattyMurray Trump n US behaving like a third world country. !
@staronline Somebody has all the skills including being a no. 1 Kelptocrat. !
@SenWarren Hold the Saudis responsible but US must review its own Foreign Pollicy too !
@staronline No Hadi is a magician !
@Newsweek Treason  n can he be deprived of his citizenship ?
@armanamin330 Betul3
@MalaysiaGazette U are to be charged ! LGE is the Finance Minister n that is the difference  !
@Newsweek Improve America’s technology first !
@MalaysiaGazette Good point  !
@MalaysiaGazette This has been said for some time . Action needed now . Don’t retrench but deploy n reorientate them with other jobs .
@washingtonpost The Minister has made a mistake here . The girl must be allowed to come back n charged under relevant law !
@EricPaulsen101 Well done Tun M ! We can’t live with a tainted judiciary !
@malaymail This guy is off his head !
@staronline Empowering OR Nepotism
@malaymail Another delay tactic frustrated! Any more ?
@NBCNews Your time is over too !
@CNNPolitics When the gap between the poor n the rich is great  then the  answer is socialism !
@theedgemarkets Don’t have to fly figures to cover 10 year period . People need Houses now . Talk of one term ! That will help in next election !
@malaysiakini Pas has invented another lie ‘ !
@PattyMurray It should be challenged .
@theborneopost Good idea !
@malaysiakini A clever answer !!!
@malaymail Lots of questions ! Hope government can come with details n answers. Bauxite brings money n income but at what cost?
@malaysiakini The judiciary looks tainted. Can we live with it. ?
@fmtoday Before n now if enforcement lacks everything will go out of control . Extreme vigilance is needed !
@CNNPolitics She talks like Trump too .
@NST_Online Moral of the story . Don’t walk alone !
@realDonaldTrump Everybody except Trump. !
@malaymail Yes yes . Lots more changes needed in RTM .
@MalaysiaGazette Pas is playing politics n a dirty one too. !
@staronline If the State Government does its job there is no need for its people to go abroad in search of jobs !
@staronline Those guys who taunt a Minister is not permissible! Serious action must be taken . No VIP should interfere !
@fmtoday Pas encourages lying !
@Newsweek Good move. !
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Miller is the architect behind the emergency move.
@NBCNews Shameless request from White House !
@malaymail Is the beginning of yr rift with Rafizi? His contributions to the party is big.
@MalaysiaGazette Can we trust Pas  ?
@MalaysiaGazette @NajibRazak When u criticise a Minister be mindful of the baggage u carry!
@realDonaldTrump We need the Mueller investigation ! More than any time .
@fmtoday Pas needs such leaders ! Are there any people like that ?
@NajibRazak How to support a kleptocract n his friends ?
@politico No results yet but Trump is expecting the  Noble Peace Prize!
@fmtoday Why is  Najib involved ?
@SinarOnline Gachua dodol Boleh memang ka ?
@malaymail Already there is confusion ! Wait for more !
@fmtoday U talk like Trump too !
@andreaprasow Is that what Trump wants ? What’s happening US ?
@itvnews @realDonaldTrump Will he get it ? I doubt !
@guardiannews But Trump does not care !
@politico But both are going to lose their voter support !
@mkini_bm Interesting point too! Let’s hear from Pas !
@NST_Online So Umno is alone !
@mkini_bm Isn’t this something new ?
@fmtoday So the Mullah is encouraging his followers to lie !
@mkini_bm A mullah who endorses lies !
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump himself is a national emergency !
@malaymail Cops should not have accepted those trips !
@CNN Double standards. !
@Newsweek Must be challenged !
@fmtoday But must remain friendly with Warison .!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson He is akin to a leader of a third world nation !
@malaymail Should be investigated !
@fmtoday Understand was approved by the previous government nevertheless. ....
@malaysiakini If someone lies on his degree then he can lie on other things too !
@TerenceFnandez It seems to be a fashion to buy fake certificates n to keep quiet about that. Isn’t that a bad trend !
@CNNPolitics He is obese !
@fmtoday PKR should be the party of choice. It is a party for Malaysia Baru  !
@senatemajldr Hope he will not be influenced by Trump. !
@NST_Online So politicians don’t have to go to school ?
@NBCNews Should be legally challenged. !
@washingtonpost So it is golf TV n Twittering  !
@xrockybrux @mujahidrawa That is correct !
@staronline He lied ! Must be investigated !
@NST_Online How is the trip going to help a retiring Police Chief ?
@fmtoday Nobody should question EAC! But please do a good job . Economic policies need clarity !
@SenateDems @SenatorCarper U could well be right !
@malaysiakini Hope what u say holds water !
@NajibRazak Give more dedak ? Ha ha
@hannahyeoh Good candidates. Am sure they will do a good job .
@malaymail Good show .
@washingtonpost Indirectly preparing her for a Presidential post .
@MalaysiaGazette @abdulhadiawang No money to repair lift ?
@NST_Online @NajibRazak U should have done all this when u were PM not seeking attention n publicity now !
@NBCNews That is cruel. !
@NajibRazak Because u are notorious not famous. !
@malaymail What an easy path for the 7 MPs. ?
@malaymail Why drag the father’s name?
@Aisehman So Pakatan does not believe in tenders. !
@MalaysiaGazette @NajibRazak Boss lanuns. !
@faekah_qkn5 Why does it take so long to appoint the right members ?
@craz33sufri @BuletinTV3 @YBFatimah @NewsMPB Does it take so long to get them out. ?
@CNN Trump does not !
@USATODAY Whose is going to pay ?
@VP @IlhanMN At least she apologised but  what about Trump. ?
@EricPaulsen101 Learn to be kind !
@mitchellreports @VP @IlhanMN U should do that to Trump too .
@politico It is known as the Trump Theatrics. !
@LouDobbs @CharlesHurt Democrats should be able bargain the wall for DACA . This is the right time.
@mkula It is timely n a good decision !
@realDonaldTrump That’s a lot . Then carry out the work without any fuss .
@NBCNews Isn’t that Trump inspired. ?
@malaymail There should be a new trial date. !
@politico Like yours too !
@politico If that is your yardstick u should have resigned long ago. !
@HuffPost Trump inspired !
@Newsweek The figures have to be verified !
@business Trump is king of disharmony. !
@ABCPolitics Trump must be challenged !
@mitchellreports @kwelkernbc That’s it. ! We need someone to rebut Trump ‘s so called facts on the need for the wall !
@HuffPost TV n Twittering does not constitute hard work !
@CNNPolitics What is so difficult ? Quid pro quo ! DACA for WALL !
@realDonaldTrump Trump should stop making unnessary demands. !
@MSNBC It is known as the Trump tax cut !
@Newsweek TV n tweeting n golf takes a lot  of executive time n that’s working hard I suppose  !
@NST_Online It’s only your words. !
@realDonaldTrump Exaggerated facts n figures ! All to get the wall ! Like a child crying for its candy !
@waterfall8187 Probably they are given discounts because they are special Mullahs
@MalaysiaGazette @NajibRazak Electioneering before nominations !!!
@niknazmi @weekasiongmp Is there a problem ?
@malaymail Your indulgence in good life is already being watched . Are your members tolerating such flamboyance n wealth ? What about the poor people of Kelantan ?
@fmtoday The legal battles are to start on Tuesday !
@fmtoday Don’t be too long in the dark ! Raayat want to know !
@malaymail So what is your educational background ? What to know out of curiosity !
@Jeff4Malaysia Celebrity patients take longer to get better !

@Newsweek Trump has mocked Warren ! Now she must learn to mock Trump !
@SinarOnline Abdul Bari is a hero .
@fmtoday And Honesty. !
@RepSylviaGarcia @HouseDemocrats @RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary Trump’s cruelty. !
@MalaysiaGazette @RinaMohdHarun If u are truthful u have nothing to fear.
@malaymail But politics teaches deligence  n honesty !
@malaysiakini Must be a celebrity chef. !
@NST_Online The MB is now a celebrity. !
@mkini_bm The late Tunku’s  cabinet had  Ministers who had less certificates n less education but they were honest n good Ministers !
@NST_Online From an MB to a celebrity ! Why ?
@USATODAY Looks like Dr . Conley is making a prediction !
@ABCPolitics Public money for legal bills ?
@malaysiakini Yes the sooner the better !
@fmtoday Is Pas that Angelic ?
@MalaysiaGazette Be entertained !
@Newsweek Whitekar has already appeared rude n obstructionist !
@VP @CBP Your obsession with the wall is no better than that of Trump . Hmm looks like His Masters Voice !
@NAR In the meantime let’s be entertained by him !
@malaysiakini Admit n see whether your party still needs u. !
@staronline No academic qualifications required to become a sec gen of a party but maybe degree will be useful if u are a deputy / minister  !
@fmtoday This guy can be of big help. !
@theSundaily Even if it is real am wondering if grassroots like this liaison ! UMNO does not need an ally like Pas
@MalaysiaGazette @NajibRazak Some more charges ?
@malaymail Am sure Wismaputra will not be proud of their Deputy Minister !
@NajibRazak Is this the real reason  ?
@KhalidSamad Why delay ?
@realDonaldTrump It is premature . Wait until Mueller finishes his work
@bharianmy What about the grass root supporters ?
@ABC It is a cruel thing to do ! Where is the humanity ?
@politico OR seeking business opportunities ?
@realDonaldTrump Are u sure it was well received ? Why no mention of the shutdown ?
@malaysiakini But u need a politician who is honest !
@LouDobbs @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump They are needed for America’s security too !
@cnni The magazine itself should be boycotted !
@Ambiga_S As a leader if can lie about your degree then u are capable of other lies too !
@MalaysiaGazette Looks like it’s time for guys with false certificates !
@fmtoday Very good point ! Whose responsibility is it check this ? The disease is still there !
@SUHAKAM It is serious ! It is cheating ! How many more such guys are there in Malaysia. ?
@limkitsiang Can we trust Pas. ?
@Newsweek Watch TV n Twittering. !
@politico Must be Trump’s man. !
@NBCNews His concentration power must be Zero. !
@senatemajldr Why are the Republicans not involved in a comprehensive Immigration Plan ?
@senatemajldr In this u must be  a Republican not a Trump man !
@Ambiga_S MACC needs to look into this case. !
@senatemajldr U n the Republicans also did that !
@HuffPost More such women are going to bring u down soon !
@TIME The guy knows no protocol. !
@MeetThePress Not a word in the speech on the shutdown !
@hmetromy A good political rest is what is needed !
@USATODAY Then u will be considered a failure !
@chucktodd Is US negotiating for an honourable surrender ?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump DACA. ?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Americans are already hurt by the Trump shutdown !
@ABC Is Trump an enemy of DACA ?
@WSJ Good as a museum !
@DailySabah It’s a shame !
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The shutdown has damaged Trump n the Republicans !
@NBCPolitics @NBCNews @PeterAlexander So it’s Trump contractor ! Hope it’s Trump money !
@politico Selling his Wall idea !
@realDonaldTrump But u have made the Chinese unhappy !
@senatemajldr Trump will drag down the Republicans !
@USATODAY Minority leader !
@Newsweek That’s what happens when u are in the shadow of somebody !
@realDonaldTrump But u lost the House !
@senatemajldr @POTUS Nothing concrete ! Has created a topsi turvy world !  Multi  literalism is slowly being eased out when other countries need it . Allies are not interested in US  n it’s Trump’s doing .
@HuffPost Trump ‘a excutive time was watching TV n twittering. !
@Newsweek So Trump cannot be trusted by his allies. !
@Newsweek Watching TV n twittering is also creative !
@KhalidSamad A cash donation  can mare  evidence ! This EX had a lot of cash in his apartments .
@WSJeurope His tone changes often ! Bipartisan means DACA in exchange for money for the wall. Doesn’t Trump understand this ?
@guanenglim @NgaKorMing Find the money !
@HuffPost Trump likes drama ! So your guests must create the drama !
@NajibRazak Looks like this EX visit will be to PD before he is needed in the courts !
@usatodayvideo @USATODAY His choice of senior officials are as controversial as he is !
@business It will be legally challenged by the Democrats !
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Exaggerating facts n putting fear into people ! He just needs the funds to please his supporters !
@washingtonpost She is a captive in her own country !
@fmtoday Police n MACC must come into this case !
@MalaysiaGazette The EX is defending Pas . Why?
@hannahyeoh Just say Kong Xi Fa Chai n they will take care of u !
@malaymail Are these monies not accountable ?
@fmtoday @NajibRazak Your words these days are definitely big question marks !
@Ambiga_S Explain your oppulance !
@realDonaldTrump And Your game ?
@malaymail Local councils are not doing enough ! We need the whole nation ‘s participation !
@HuffPost Best interest? OR business interest ?
@NajibRazak A popular EX.
@fmtoday Will the truth ever come out ?
@niknazmi We may want to follow what other countries like Australia does . But government agencies overseeing infra structure works are also to be watched . Their demands are a burden to developers. Not standardised n unpredictable. In the end developers pass the cost to the buyers !
@JohariYazid @anthonyloke This needs explanation !
@fmtoday Is it the beginning of a nuclear war. ?
@malaysiakini So that’s your hope ?
@NajibRazak Just strengthing friendly ties !
@MalaysiaGazette So Tun M  should visit Pekan too !
@fmtoday So what has happened to the accusations ?
@malaysiakini Why out of court ?
@mkini_bm So was there some truth ?
@Ambiga_S It may not be true   But what is Dap doing about this perception ?
@NajibRazak This chap is entraining too
@staronline More can be done !
@malaysiakini In some way we must thank this man ! His follies helped bring down Umno / BN. !
@SenateDems @SenatorCardin All for a wall !
@SenWarren The INF treaty could have been expanded with China in n more rules n safety regulations in place ! What is Trump up to ?
@realDonaldTrump Now a surrender is being worked out by your administration ! But in terms of long term security for the US are u doing the right thing ?
@politico The rest of your speech will be on the wall !
@MalaysiaGazette A valid question !
@fmtoday A shameless request !
@washingtonpost That is double standard. !
@VP @POTUS @DEAHQ N together both of u will lose the next election !
@fmtoday Up to now it is still confusion ? What next ?
@mitchellreports Trump may need a new Intelligence service ! One that panders to him !
@fmtoday Does Hadi n Pas survive on race n religion ?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump It is a dignified surrender !
@EricPaulsen101 Good decision. EU is not US. !
@politico And u as Press Secretary !
@fmtoday Religion loses its meaning when u use it as u like !
@CNNPolitics Dan Coats should produce an intelligence report that pleases Trump ! Look what America has come to !
@fmtoday EC should take action !
@MalaysiaGazette Not all members are happy with the courtship  !
@malaymail Yes yes yes This should have been done long ago. !
@realDonaldTrump Your own intelligence !
@CNNPolitics Republicans should start looking for a replacement for Trump. !
@malaymail So it boils down to enforcement !
@nsurendrann Correct looks a minor offence blown out of proportion! What if Mano had won ? Did anyone take note of all the other infractions ?
@malaymail His strategy is too simplistic. Try n get more Malay support. Many still don’t trust PH.
@NBCNews The stumbling block is Trump !
@mitchellreports @NBCNightlyNews Trump concorts n contradicts his own foreign policies. His allies don’t trust him n so do his advisers !
@fmtoday Why the run around ? This should have been decided by the CABINET  n followed by a written statement .
@TSMusaHassan First of all treat them as human beings !
@politico Not to be believed !
@lawyers4liberty All politicians must speak like u Mr. MP !
@malaymail Education ministry should do something !
@501Awani We have that young lady in Pkr !
@NewsBFM Good idea !
@fmtoday Ministers are not appointed on merit but on quota . A few think it is their right ! Some still to show their abilities .
@mkini_bm The right formula should not repeat not include race n religion!
@MalaysiaGazette It takes two play the game ! But it is dangerous trend n harmful for the country.   Government must find ways if necessarily legiitively to check this trend.
@politico Too much politicking !
@TheEconomist It is unavoidable ! It is today the best 5G superphone !
@CNN All are welcome. Must get Trump out. He is doing lots of damage to the American people.
@fmtoday Cameron’s can still be considered a rural constituency . DAP strength is mostly in urban areas . To penetrate Pahang PH has to strategise new ways n there is renewed awakening of the Malays !
@NBCNews No no no. U are just covering Trump !
@fmtoday The public are also confused !
@malaymail Don’t they discuss such things in the cabinet ?
@NST_Online Let us have a clear message . Don’t talk in riddles !
@malaysiakini What results ? Start honouring your manifesto ! Maybe raayat reacting for going back on manifesto !
@NajibRazak Are the people still there who can put their trust in this man in the future of our country ?
@malaysiakini It is a wake up call !
@realDonaldTrump Tunnels are still being used ? A wall can help but it is not the answer !
@UMonline @NajibRazak Most voters need the Pahang Government which is BN !
@malaymail Another example of right hand not knowing what the left hand does !
@MalaysiaGazette So what is the real situation ?
@staronline Hadi has a point !
@realDonaldTrump Wall is not the answer !
@MalaysiaGazette Sorry next let PH put in a Orang Asal  candidate . Manogran will understand.!
@malaymail It shows  BN is still strong in Pahang !
@MalaysiaGazette BN won but u have big battle to fight !
@hmetromy Hasn’t he got a new name ?
@MalaysiaGazette Good move! Look for a new deal !
@NBCNews A fair deal ?  Money for wall n a DACA package !
@malaysiakini Exorbitant! What a deal the Najib’s Government has gotten into ?
@SenPatRoberts @realDonaldTrump Not border only but a comphrensive immigration package . America is not just the border only !
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Hope Democrats can get DACA in the new deal !
@washingtonpost Women mean business !
@washingtonpost What sacrifice ?
@malaymail U are right on KJ !
@Ambiga_S Right on Ambiga ! Voters should not listen to rogue n a party that is dying or dead . Go for PH n u got Malaysia Baru !
@chegubard Well said !
@UMonline That’s the word ... People should be ashamed to vote Umno ! Said Tun M .
@CNNPolitics Didn’t know that even the wall has a down payment !
@Newsweek Trump n Wilbur Ross can be put in one house !
@business Is it reincarnation of Indira Ghandi ?
@mpklang @mkula @nytimesworld R&amp;B song from a PM on vacation !
@NST_Online Whose is to care n feed them ?
@art_harun @mariachin No no no . As of now u are doing a good job !
@_PHSupporter Is it Najib law ?
@sumishanaidu We need that !
@DrDzul If u do not want to be accused of cronyism then both of them must go !
@fmtoday The PM on vacation !
@malaymail BN Pahang Government must be brought down soon !
@CNNPolitics Sounds good ! What about a permanent DACA ?
@SenWarren @SecretaryRoss Wilbur Ross can’t feel the Trump Shut Down ! Pitiful isn’t it ?
@fmtoday Hope u are right https://t.co/7lt8rYnmcA Minister on vacation!
@malaymail How is Tok Mat responsible for Non Malay votes for BN? Or not at all !
@malaymail Cronyism n Nepotism ?
@NST_Online What lies ?
@CNNPolitics A country in chaos ?
@senatemajldr U are just playing to Trump’s  manipulation ?
@ABCPolitics It is in Trump ‘s hands to  clear the mess he created !
@fmtoday Denial syndrome ! How long can that go on ?
@malaymail Signs of cronyism  n nepotism. What should PH do ?
@malaysiakini In the West the Prime Minister would have danced with them!
@malaymail Can her words n the picture be used as evidence ?
@CNN He was cruel inconsiderate n inhumane? Bat qualities of a President / bad
@washingtonpost Resign or must be forced to resign !
@mkini_bm What is happening ?
@ABCPolitics Probably perpetuated by Trump !
@cnni Trump n Price are running shot of ideas to justify the money for the wall ? Using MLK is cheap. Get some funds for security but exit shutdown n provide citizenship for DACA boys !
@washingtonpost Yes yes yes it is a Trump creation !
@realDonaldTrump It’s a Trump crisis. !
@fmtoday Are we dealing with fanatics. ?
@malaymail Listen to the Mullah !
@fmtoday Can u separate Islam from this party. ?
@fmtoday A celebrity ex PM !
@MalaysiaGazette Novel way of engaging with them ! But what about the votes ?
@realDonaldTrump U are so unpredictable n that is even worse !
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse What role are u playing in  ending the shutdown ?
@VP @POTUS American leadership ? Zero!
@UMonline Is BN still taking credit for this ?
@VP @margbrennan @FaceTheNation @POTUS Hostage taking. That’s not what is America !
@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump U have forgotten history ! America needs friends ! Your security depends on keeping the world safe which u are not doing !
@SkyNews The cops !
@sitikasim @dapmalaysia Ask him to prove it . How can Pas get support from the non Muslims ?
@malaysiakini A very tactful statement ! Is BN in a position to help the settlers unless an Arab gives BN a donation
@mkini_bm Kenapa. ?
@malaysiakini Why. ?
@Independent What extension ? They should be given a path to citizenship as a permanent solution !
@MalaysiaGazette Does he have to ?
@malaysiakini Am not surprised ! It now up to PH officials to dispel this thinking ! Hope those who met him would have asked the most important question !
@limkitsiang Going by the likes this former PM is supposed to be getting he has won the election already !
@LatheefaKoya A backward looking counytry may work towards banning dancing totally! Is that what Malaysia  Baru wants ?
@MalaysiaGazette @drasyrafwajdi @PPUMOnline A backward thinking !
@malaysiakini Nobody should be apologetic ! Umno youth must grow up !
@BBCWorld Until Trump comes to his senses !
@mariachin @chedetofficial Israel builds homes in occupied territory . That is unacceptable !
@malaysiakini Is dancing with your wife a crime ? Was there a court in session ?
@SkyNews Should have given him a ticket ! Ha ha !
@CNN Simple logic is better. Nothing to do with common sense !
@Newsweek What to do? U are inviting yourself to impeachment !
@LindseyGrahamSC Does not look complete n permanent. Plan a comprehensive permanent immigration law that provides eventual citizenship .!
@itvnews Looks like Prince Phillip had broken some traffic laws !
@mkini_bm Popularity yes but votes I doubt !
@CNNPolitics Doesn’t Trump know that ?
@malaysiakini Does this Mullah know that religion n politics don’t mix !
@Khairykj He is still the 1 MDB boss ! Perhaps he wanted the voters in Cameron’s to know that !
@fmtoday It is law my friend !
@malaysiakini DAP is there n why do u need MCA ?
@NewsBFM A heritage from the previous government !
@business Don’t expect anything! Trump too can go for his golf !
@fmtoday Hope Kelantan takes a good lawyer !
@fmtoday What’s the problem. Why the delay in appointing members ?
@malaymail Well done . ! Go for all the guys who abused Orang Asli ‘s Rights!
@malaysiakini No it is not your fault . It is the system u developed to make 1MDB work for u. !
@politico Grounded. !
@malaymail But he has the time for all these activities !
@malaysiakini Follow what Thailand does !
@fmtoday What nonsense !
@RandPaul That will show the world how divided America is !
@fmtoday A timely warning !
@malaymail Everybody but not me ?
@limkitsiang There is only one way to uplift n care n develop the Orang Asli ! Make them the Bumiputras of this country n they are . The rest will take care of itself !
@NajibRazak Cameron’s visited by VVIP eminent persons !
@EricPaulsen101 Does not sound right . We should not interfere with international sporting bodies .
@RohanBeg @saifuddinabd Present day Pas guys are not like Tuan Nik Aziz !
@CNNPolitics Maybe on behalf of Trump !
@mkula Yes highest members of the previous Malaysian Government !
@RandPaul U are also taking away security for America !
@CGTNOfficial Only apology ?
@senatemajldr Republicans have become puppets of Trump .!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump For the first time US foreign policy has become directionless !
@CNNPolitics U n Trump are better placed to stop the furlough !
@malaymail Hope the voters in Cameron’s will welcome Najib with open arms !
@realDonaldTrump Walls won’t work. Tunnels are being used !
@politico It is an issue . U are losing !
@NajibRazak What is the message ?
@staronline Interesting !
@malaymail What a reason ?
@UMonline He should. Let the voters see the famous man! Wonder what he will say !
@CNN How ‘s Trump helping them?
@patel4witham Put in your input !
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump What victory ?
@MalaysiaGazette Cronyism. !
@CNNPolitics Trump should also pay the wages of those affected by the shut down !
@fmtoday Looking for tit for tat !
@politico That sounds better !
@washingtonpost Bolton is a Hawk in the White House !
@fmtoday Why are u saying all this only now ?
@politico Senate GOP have unwittingly aligned too much with Trump . In the process they are becoming weak daily. The next election will show what they have done to themselves !
@malaysiakini Is the former PM on vacation ?
@NajibRazak Now Pakatan has something more to talk !
@malaysiakini He could be an asset or a liability !
@CNNPolitics US should be concerned !
@SenWarren This shutdown deliberately played up by Trump n GOP is going to show clearly in the next elections !
@NBCNews Not 6000 !
@malaymail An inherited  legacy from Malaysia !
@Newsweek Ineffective n lame duck leader . At least Democrats tried to get workers wages n back to work !
@fmtoday Civil servants tasted favours n wrong lessons from the previous government. Ultimately corruption became the order of the day. Little Napoleons were all over. People n business men lived in fear n were forced to use money to get results.
@Independent All in the family. !
@fqadi @JustinTrudeau But not Trump n US !
@fmtoday Why the request now ?
@bharianmy This is not something that Trump should be proud of. !
@The_Endie @saifuddinabd Wonder what he has to say to this !
@CNNPolitics Does GOP care ?
@ABC Border Wall will be of no use. Tunnels are being used to cross !
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Border Wall is Useless . As tunnels are used n easily available ! What a shame as Trump is making so much of fuss ! People are out of jobs n consequently no wages too .!
@SCMPNews Hope we have a law like that. !
@fmtoday Very refreshing to hear that !
@Newsweek U have never been a calm man. ! A bully always secumes to temper tantrums !
@CNN Plan C . Get rid of Trump by denying a second term. !
@NBCPolitics It will be court challenged !
@realDonaldTrump For a useless wall. !!!
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews We know what to expect !
@malaysiakini Then don’t take anybody until next election ! OR no holding any position until next party election !
@Ambiga_S Anyway will that make any difference to PH ?
@stevescott_itv @itvnews All good things must to an end !
@SCMPNews I don’t think he is a big loss to Davos ! He can’t even solve the shut down created by himself. !
@CNN @ForecasterEnten One businessman has already proven a disaster !
@malaysiakini The more the merrier. ! See what the demise of BN can do to Democracy !
@malaysiakini An apt request ! Legal practitioners should move with time !
@CNNPolitics What an irresponsible Senate leader. ! Voters should punish him .!
@politico Another lie ! He is now trying to get out of this crazy idea. !
@mitchellreports @SenatorDurbin This Senate leader has become beholden to Trump. !
@Newsweek U need crazy legislators to challenge a crazy leader. !
@fmtoday Academic !
@fmtoday Looks like PH slow in responding to criticism !
@malaysiakini Why should it be ?
@fmtoday What can we expect from PH to keep to its promise  ?
@CNN His so called facts are lies too. !
@MPOZAustralia Is the money safe ?
@Independent He is the culprit. !
@SenateDems He wants it because he promised his voters. He is afraid that if he does not get get the wall he will lose his reelection. !
@CNNPolitics A crisis of conscience which Trump doesn’t have. !
@501Awani The reasons are not convincing .!
@ABC @jonkarl The VP is just His Master’s Voice !
@aliranmalaysia What a statement from a so called Muslim leader ! He should just be an Imam !
@NBCPolitics That’s best .
@CNNPolitics There is already peoples’ angst against Trump !
@mitchellreports What he has done does not make sense at all ! Americans understand that !
@HuffPost She just continued with Trump ‘s lies !
@ABCPolitics An invented emergency !
@NBCPolitics We need the Democrats view too!
@ABC @jonkarl It is a Trump made crisis. !
@lawyers4liberty Religion again !
@washingtonpost She is just His Masters Voice !
@politico A lie !
@washingtonpost Right to return speech should be there !
@fmtoday May be true!
@mkini_bm A concerned ex PM ! What about our National Dept ?
@NBCNews Six yes . But not 5000 !
@HuffPost The Trump disaster. !
@politico Many senior Americans are reluctant to serve Trump. !
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS Come back to the table. Bring in DACA !
@washingtonpost Another damn lie !
@NBCNews This is Trump ‘s media show ! Not many would want to watch that !
@politico U lied ? 5000 terrorists ?
@SenWarren @ChrisVanHollen That should be the priority !
@malaysiakini Isn’t this taxpayers money ?
@CNNPolitics The court will rule against that !
@Independent I think most Americans will agree with that .
@malaymail We welcome a kinder F Minister.
@politico Yes . DACA is equally important !
@NBCNews Unconfirmed facts ! Probably lies !
@staronline We need enforcement too !
@fmtoday @chedetofficial Politicise the need ! Emphasise the importance! Make it compulsory with a Pass in English !
@malaysiakini It is common for states to borrow from Federal ! But Finance Minister should not rub in like that. We need a kinder Minister !
@BBCWorld Thailand should not give in to Saudi request .
@TIME Can relate but still hard hearted !
@CNNPolitics Don’t give in to blackmail. Trump is noted for his bully tactics !
@malaysiakini New government new King.  !
@bharianmy Bersatu should take a pause !
@mkini_bm Are your voters still there ?
@fmtoday Poor enforcement
@Ambiga_S Why is that some of our Muslim friends ignore this Hadith ?
@NajibRazak When u lose the PM’s job. This is what do
@sitikasim @Ambiga_S Why are we so slow ? Are u going to blame  BN for the delay ?
@washingtonpost Don’t use offensive words ! Democrats should not behave like Trump !
@politico It is your word !
@CNNPolitics Nonsense ! They are not striking ! They can’t work !
@mkula Don’t resort to advance rally meetings. !
@HuffPost Another lie !
@costareports Trump is using all media channels to promote his Border Wall. Likewise the Democrats should do that too!
@fmtoday Tender for the jobs . That is realistic !
@malaysiakini Asking for contracts is realistic ?
@malaymail How much are people listening to this man these days ?
@hannahyeoh Wishing u a lasting marriage !
@politico The Kid in the White House must grow up !
@MalaysiaGazette U cannot be so definite !
@malaysiakini Don’t buy from  China . Set a up JV company n make them in Malaysia. !
@malaymail Should have announced midnight !
@LotteLeicht1 @hrw So US does not follow UN human rights mechanisms ?
@ABCPolitics U used the border patrol officials for publicity !
@malaysiakini Yes Tun. We are strong . But don’t let them take advantage of Pakatan !
@Newsweek Yes yes yes
@politico Trump should listen to the house too !
@business He should take the blame too !
@washingtonpost It could also cost him his second term !
@politico The Presidency these days is full of politics ! Trump does not talk about the average man in the street !
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Border wall is not the only thing for the American people !
@malaymail He could be right too !
@CNNPolitics Then resign from your other roles too .! A Senator n u can’t do anything ?
@Khairykj Why the delay ?
@malaysiakini The Chinese must ensure that PH keeps its promises. Otherwise do what u think is right at  Pru 15.
@malaymail Whenever there is a new law our neighbor S’pore ensures that the law is well understood n enforced. No halfway measures . PH can do it !
@XHNews This President does not listen to his generals !
@CNNPolitics Not look foolish but u are foolish !
@limkitsiang In fact voters know this now !
@realDonaldTrump U have forgotten DACA ! How can u get the wall ?
@malaysiakini @anwaribrahim Anwar should act. !
@NBCNews Is Trump impervious to this nightmare ?
@CNNPolitics Trump is unpredictable. !
@realDonaldTrump Your tweet interrupts market forces ! Don’t u know that ?
@washingtonpost Trump does not care . He is not a compassionate guy !
@malaymail Why the ban.? Make it available !
@TIME The world is disappointed that they are not getting that leadership! SAD.
@politico Then Romney should not blindly support Trump !
@washingtonpost Like the shut down !
@realDonaldTrump Does Trump read books ?
@realDonaldTrump Trump tweeter treats. !
@malaysiakini Why ?
@NBCNews Even otherwise he is so unpredictable !
@NST_Online Azmin is speaking. !
@NBCNews What a comparison. ?
@fmtoday He needs a lots of credit to pass. !
@business Then it is a glut !
@Newsweek In other words insane !
@NST_Online Air Asia should be mindful ! If Chef Wan says it then attention is needed !
@NST_Online Sounds encouraging !
@NBCPolitics Well said general. A medal for Mr. Trump !
@CBSNews It is still an excuse for the shutdown . Have a joyous New Year Mr. President !
@realDonaldTrump Trump is still the culprit not the democrats !
@CBSNews Pity the Federal workers who are affected . Political victims of Trump !
@malaymail Rent seeking caused the demolition of a government. The culprits are still around ! They too must be hunted down . But more important is that PH. Must stop this scourge .  These are the middle men looking n living on free money without any effort !
@AzminAli N Build a new alliance. ?
@TerenceFnandez UMNO 2 . The signs n inclinations are there !
@realDonaldTrump Sign DACA ! U can get some money for the wall !
@fmtoday Open tender ! Bid for the jobs ! Nothing on the platter ? That is Malaysia Baru. !
@USATODAY Sexy outfit. !
@fmtoday PH reforms are on going . People’s expectations are increasing daily . There should be less excuses n less politicking. Pace must be increased. !
@fmtoday Very good point . ! To stay relevant I doubt. Majority of people have already discarded him. Soon his writings will make people more angry . Eventually he is going to fade . I think some people are just humouring him.!
@malaymail Lame excuse. ! U don’t need big funds to function as effective opposition.
@washingtonpost Proof tha Trump has double standards !
@politico An obsession no one can understand !
@ahmadmaslan Boleh buka kedai. !
@MalaysiaGazette Lompat Boleh . But no party post until Pru 15 !
@Newsweek How long will US farmers live on subsidy ?
@Reuters @msk8blake US must be more humane. Behaves like a third world country !
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It will still not work satisfactorily . Try giving in to Border Wall  for DACA. It will work !
@realDonaldTrump Hope it is not false hope !
@washingtonpost But u are the cause !
@fmtoday Well said Tun. But are they taking heed ?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump , this is not the way to punish the Federal workers for the Border Wall. !
@SyedSaddiq Just for u. !
@fmtoday Is this the beginning ?
@NST_Online @drwanazizah @rafiziramli Rafizi’s appointment will bring unity to Pkr.
@NAR Be suspicious but it’s an advanced technology u cannot avoid.!
@MalaysiaGazette That’s the spirit. !
@fmtoday A worthy n  laudable move !
@bharianmy Bukan Pas. !
@politico It is very glaring what his priorities are
@washingtonpost That is discriminatory !
@fmtoday PH must be business friendly too !
@NBCPolitics Pre 2019 dinner . Prepare for a second house onslaught.
@NBCNews Full of lies !!!
@Newsweek Pass DACA.
@Newsweek That is just an excuse. !
@NBCNews Looks like a threat ! Will become a lame duck President soon. !
@malaymail But do not become a champion of only race n religion! Be a champion of Malaysia Baru . All races want that !
@Newsweek Is it ?
@realDonaldTrump These are poor countries!  They should be helped !
@CNNPolitics It is your word .Maybe Trump would have asked u to say that !
@NST_Online Great
@fmtoday Must be enforced soon n deligently .
@washingtonpost Is she wearing the right dress. ?
@fmtoday That is the type of unity that makes a responsible democracy in our country !
@USATODAY MAGA hats came from where ?
@malaysiakini Why should Dap do that ?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Can Trump still have a good year end holiday. ?
@Reuters Democrats must insist on DACA for Border Wall !
@CNNPolitics Lies again ! It has become Trump ‘s trademark !
@washingtonpost So Trump is punishing the Democrats. !
@MalaysiaGazette Tun M must continue with the good work! Polls are misleading these days !
@NBCNews So it is selective furlough. !
@realDonaldTrump The Trump type !
@fmtoday Birds of a feather. !
@MalaysiaGazette Pas appears to be sending different signals !
@CNNPolitics Bringing politics to the military is dangerous !
@malaysiakini But still ! Why the increase. ?
@malaysiakini What suffering. ?
@malaymail Hit n Run. ?
@MalaysiaGazette Sounds a good advice. !!!
@TIME The Trump Cruelty. !
@malaysiakini They produce responsible opposition . Must be encouraged.
@CNNPolitics Get a good Democratic candidate n beat him. !
@malaymail Strange. ! LGE announced the allowance in October n now after  about 100 days still appears not ready to dish out the money. Why the BN list ?  So it is Dedak still !
@washingtonpost Trump was the Tornado. !
@CNNPolitics It was a PR trip ! Troops should have been thanked n given reasons for their continued stay in Iraq . Instead he talks about border wall.!
@fmtoday We know what Pas wants. !
@fmtoday Some people have planted wrong ideas into receipients of PTPTN ! Their mindset must be changed. A regularalised form of loans with strict adherence towards payment must be enforced. This can’t go on. !
@CNNPolitics Just a Trump creation !
@politico Border fence maybe ?
@mkula Is it necessary to issue such threats ? Very unsettling !
@NBCNews He is busy trying to get the wall !
@malaysiakini The lanuns n the plunderes must be caught !
@lawyers4liberty Resistance is only from some Malaysians  !
@realDonaldTrump An inflated opinion of u n what u are doing! What about the Federal workers without work n wages.  ? Cruel isn’t it ?
@washingtonpost It is still taxpayer’s money !
@malaymail Very good suggestion. We must be seen to be fair to the voters. !
@malaymail The Ayatollah is creating waves overseas ! But at the subject !
@Newsweek The Trump / Mnuchin fall. !
@Independent Is there a Trump apology. ?
@theborneopost Sarawak should be an example to all States !
@bharianmy Looks like one of the Ayatollah I know of. !
@malaysiakini A Pas turnaround !
@washingtonpost Could be true. !
@malaymail Bless u.  !
@malaymail I thought these were traits of the previous government !
@bharianmy Do not become a champion of negativity !
@CNNPolitics But u have left the Khuds in the lurch. !
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan The Khuds need your help. !
@fmtoday Well said ! This is the type of extremism our government must avoid.
@malaysiakini Why isn’t Pakatan not listening to the former PM ?
@malaymail Why cops ? MAHB should attend to criticism !
@malaysiakini What PKR needs is total unity n a period of calm n quiet. Don’t just bring negativity criticism. It is already broken n needs repairs ! PH also needs repairs . Don’t let the opposition take advantage.
@Newsweek Alarming ! Is this how US foreign policy works ? Disgraceful !
@politico Now Trump is his boss.!
@fmtoday It is not proper for one Minister to ask his cabinet colleague to step down ! Highly inappropriate. !
@fmtoday Must a motive !
@mkini_bm World oil price has gone down . What about Malaysia. ?
@BBCNews Man City can lose n so can Chelsea. !
@malaysiakini BN should just do that ! Can Umno / BN do that ?
@politico Trump will get his second chance in 2020 !
@politico What did Trump win before he became President? Look what America is going through now ?
@ABC Terrorists in Morocco ?
@CNNPolitics Say that again to Trump ?
@mpklang @staronline Don’t encourage a media war. !
@washingtonpost Go for impeachment. !
@realDonaldTrump Your obsession with the wall is not a life n death issue !
@AnasZubedy It is so clear ! Some of them lack leadership qualities !
@NBCPolitics Wonder how US citizens feel ?
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Mattis expose shows Trump ‘s slow road to chaos !
@politico Will show at his re-election ?
@washingtonpost Slow move to chaos !
@washingtonpost Powell has nothing to do with market results ?
@CNNPolitics Executive interference. ?
@realDonaldTrump Trump has been shutdowned !
@HuffPost No big deal at the expense of the Federal workers !
@malaymail Can’t these things be discussed within the 4 walls? Why attract media attention ?
@fmtoday Then who does ?
@fmtoday HRDF is already tainted ! It must be scrupulously managed . No more bad names n any suspicions .
@fmtoday Old wine in a new bottle !
@NST_Online It should be honoured to have Tun M as PM for two years.
@washingtonpost Some Federal workers may not be to celebrate the holidays !
@SenateDems What is important? Workers wages or the wall
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Can his words be trusted
@malaysiakini Good decision. Religious teachings should be home managed !
@malaymail What is wrong ? U understand nuts ! Then u should be staying I Mecca not Malaysia !
@washingtonpost Miller is the architect of some of Trump ‘s follies !
@CNNPolitics He is setting the momentum !
@washingtonpost Middle East minus US  ? It is going to be explosive !
@washingtonpost Does not make sense !
@malaysiakini Apologise for what  n coming from another Cabinet Minister . What is happening ?
@fmtoday If Tun M listens to them then it is not Democracy but anarchy. !
@aliranmalaysia Yes that is true !
@CNNPolitics The Kurds are vulnerable !
@politico It is worrying !
@washingtonpost He is trying for two years ! Success does not come easily
@HuffPost Trump is Twitter n Twitter is Trump. !
@washingtonpost Trump has abandoned the Kurds !
@washingtonpost Islamic State is still there.! Trump is hasty in his withdrawal decision! What about US comittment to the Kurds ?
@Daily_Express Maybe overdressed. !
@malaysiakini Not another excuse I hope !
@washingtonpost Looks like an autocratic decision!
@aliranmalaysia Good if Rafizi’s report is discussed at PH council Meeting !
@NBCNews What a comedown for US. !
@SenWarren Good move .
@malaymail Why the protest ? Looks like that some people are using the slightest excuse for protests. Must be discouraged. !
@washingtonpost Barack the Santa. !
@malaysiakini Smearing or criticism ?
@malaymail Is this a threat ? Should we give give in ? No no no !
@fmtoday Some people never learn !
@LiewChinTong @dapmalaysia A new Umno to reflect Malaysia Baru ! That is what the raayat would want !
@malaymail Some people are not thinking right. !
@malaysiakini Well said.! We don’t need a strong majority just to get 2/3 majority.
@fmtoday Such leaders are dangerous to our society. !
@HuffPost Signs that she may leave soon.
@NST_Online A good advice from the Chief Secretary.  A total change is necessary in line with Malaysia Baru. The change must include kind n friendly n humane too. They must learn to be responsible n conscious n give the money ‘s worth. Most of all level of efficiency must go up. !
@fmtoday U are right on Kadir !
@HuffPost At 32 one is quite matured. !
@malaysiakini Cut red tape at all local governments n u see the change.
@politico Buying votes maybe !
@washingtonpost Play with the child. !
@CNNPolitics How can u link the wall to a partial shutdown ? Sounds crazy !
@NBCNews Cruel isn’t it ?
@CraigCons @saifuddinabd Compassion is part of humanity ! No matter what religion !
@malaymail Signs of a rogue company !
@malaysiakini Very sad !
@Ambiga_S Sacrifice of an innocent life .! What a lost . ! Must get the culprits . May his soul rest in peace .
@NST_Online Al fatihah.
@washingtonpost These terms must be familiar to Trump. !
@theborneopost Let Warison do the job n be an ally of Pakatan.
@washingtonpost Can a foreign country do that ?
@CBSNews Don’t tripod Trump too much. U can be sacked too !
@patel4witham Brexit is what u wanted. Accept it n go ahead with whatever u get. Don’t flog a dead horse. !
@washingtonpost Guiliaini is afraid that Trump will mess up. !
@malaymail The aide to PM. Was he blindly accepted.
@fmtoday Who won’t be scared n frighten of this party
@niknazmi There is a big difference in accepting Tun M n other members of Umno. !
@Kamzam64683743 @saifuddinabd @chedetofficial Malaysia must strongly object to this. !
@washingtonpost The big question is what do we do with him now ?
@HishammuddinH2O @staronline @AzminAli Is he defending Azmin ?
@HuffPost She has all the time been His Master’s Voice ? How can she be honest ?
@USATODAY Biden can give a fight
@business It is so true !
@jsadiq Democracy was hijacked by the previous government but should not happen again. !
@art_harun @saifuddinabd What PH is doing now is to put right the Democracy that was tweaked by the previous government !
@washingtonpost If Trump relishes a shut down do it .
@MalaysiaMFA @saifuddinabd @RamlanMFA Was Australia pressured by US ?
@washingtonpost US is also a country of immigrants. Are they also dirty ?
@SyedSaddiq Call in MACC. The system needs to be put right.
@Ambiga_S They also need water (money) without which they will die. !
@fmtoday Do they think it that way ?
@LatheefaKoya We want a responsible opposition not necessarily a strong opposition. !
@malaymail Money money money !!!
@fmtoday Pakatan should learn to strengthen itself now. Don’t take members from a party rejected by the voters. Otherwise at the next election voters who are watching the scenario unfolding now will not trust PH n vote them out  in Pru 15.
@msianinsight @Khairykj Will Zahid go. ?
@fmtoday Australia also has Muslim s as their citizens. !
@patricklsk @Ambiga_S Look at the Thais. Why are we waiting ?
@washingtonpost Trump thrives on corruption n lies !
@mkini_bm Who is lying ?
@CNN Just a sorry ?
@HuffPost Small crime maybe ?
@politico Yr border patrol guys were careless maybe !
@washingtonpost Why not ?
@mitchellreports Is US becoming inhuman ?
@501Awani Ex Minister ?
@theborneopost Is there problem with PKR in Sarawak ?
@malaysiakini The bleeding continues. !
@NewsBFM Look at the smile !
@mkini_bm @Khairykj Go for the no 1 post KJ . There is still future  in Umno.
@malaymail Party Peribumi must make good decisions when talking in new members !
@NBCNews @NBCLatino Good gesture !
@MalaysiaGazette Once a suspended UMNO member. !
@RandPaul Are they terrorists because they kill Israelists ? When they kill Palestinians what are they ?
@ABCPolitics He always says that first ! It is different when he sacks them !
@malaymail Can such a bargain be made ?
@malaymail This mullah is talking unsubstantiated nonsense again . !
@dyanasmd @limkitsiang @bharianmy Any more politics Dyana ?
@Newsweek Sound racist. !
@malaymail A lady frog. !
@Ambiga_S Building up 2/3 majority from frogs does not look nice n perhaps not honourable ? Why the hurry ? Let them languish in the wilderness for some time !
@malaysiakini @tokmatn9 @chedetofficial What about that case years ago. ?
@fmtoday The message is so clear. !
@Ambiga_S Like rats abandoning ship. !
@fmtoday Is this the right way of strengthening n building up PPBM. ?
@HuffPost Lame duck ?
@NBCNews Is having Trump’s name an asset ? No more these days !
@501Awani What Reformasi? The warlords seem to be happy with present situation.  No changes UMNO is good as dead !
@NBCNews Was it worth covering his dirty deeds ?
@VizlaKumaresan @Ambiga_S Some parties prefer child marriages .
@UMonline That’s what he says n thinks ! I don’t think he is right. The ship is sinking !
@Independent Looks like he can give  a good fight to Trump !
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Lobby system is very much an American outfit . It breeds corruption. Good law. Hope u succeed in getting it passed .
@fmtoday Hope Party Peribumi is not another UMNO in the making !
@Newsweek The whole family must be against him. !
@NBCNews Proud ? No it is stupid !
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak The loyal heroes !
@cnni Other countries also have their nationalists. !
@malaysiakini @chedetofficial Are they joining Bersatu. ?
@politico Maybe American people will welcome the impeachment. !
@malaysiakini @Tabung_Haji @abdulhadiawang Depositors need to know. !
@fmtoday Like film stars !
@MalaysiaGazette This guy can still talk !
@bingregory @Ambiga_S Depositors savings used as dividends ! What cleverness? Let’s hear from Pas .
@TIME Very presumptius. !
@TheSun Google may be right !
@waterfall8187 How come no reaction from the two Malay parties on TH scandal ?
@washingtonpost U are no better ! U only know how to tripod Trump.!
@Newsweek Trump lies . People of America must not allow this to happen.
@EricPaulsen101 High handnesses ?
@fmtoday Pas n Umno behaving goodie goodie on TH scandal. What hypocrites ?
@501Awani Is this the beginning of a new political liaison ?
@fmtoday DAP is trying. If not it will only have a narrow base of raayat support. Get rid of it’s Chineseness !
@GOP Malaysia may need such a law if there is not one yet !
@malaymail Still u can declare what u got. An answer like that can show u are poor but u must still put something on record!
@fmtoday Not a good rating but Ministers must work harder n be exposed to the media. Let the raayat know what their ministeris are doing n not harping on the wrong doings of the previous government only.
@MalaysiaGazette Nothing. ?
@ivyjosiah @Ambiga_S Everyone n everybody must accept that there is such a thing as human rights!
@fmtoday This itself constitutes obstruction of justice. !
@lawyers4liberty The mullah say that non Malays are here at the mercy of the Muslims . This is how a leader speaks. !
@malaymail Call in the MACC .
@staronline Ku Li u as elder statesmen should have advised them before the rally not after !
@mstaronline Is this still happening in our country ?
@MalaysiaGazette KPI under the Civil Service Act . Possible isn’t it ?
@staronline They harped on same subjects race n religion !
@malaysiakini @kinitv So DAP has Malay support !
@malaymail So there were children too !
@fmtoday Yes yes yes. Why the delay? There should be no exemption !
@fmtoday @LatheefaKoya So is this the new trend in PH ?
@Jeff4Malaysia A rally for the early demise of Pakatan . ? Interesting !
@malaysiakini If that is happening then what is the difference?
@MalaysiaGazette Malays must be helped n must have political power . But not necessarily under UMNO n PAS .
@MalaysiaGazette The Mullah speaketh !
@mkini_bm This does not trust PH !
@washingtonpost If Tillerson says then it must be true. !
@RandPaul Is Saudi a rogue state ?
@pearllee22 Take off all burdensome fees. Be humane but strict in collection. PTPTN is not a money making outfit. !
@washingtonpost Rex has hit the nail right on. !

@HuffPost What an irresponsible statement !
@HuffPost Trump is special !
@SusanRaqib @USGAO Isn’t this a human rights violation ?
@malaysiakini When u take a loan don’t u sign a contract ?
@fmtoday Why the cover up then. ?
@fmtoday Attempt to cover up is an offence !
@malaysiakini A terrible disease that needs serious remedy !
@fmtoday Cabinet sanction is more important .
@washingtonpost Trump wants to be different. Most of the time !
@fmtoday An immature statement ! Our problems are not insoumental . Singapore need not be the whipping boy !
@washingtonpost Like to see a changed Trump. !
@fmtoday @chedetofficial It is endemic! Now Pakistan n even US seriously bringing new laws to tackle corruption!
@fmtoday The mullah has no principles. !
@fmtoday That should be understood first !
@malaymail The guy needs a brain shake up.!
@malaysiakini @kinitv He should have known better !
@fmtoday Good point. !
@501Awani It should be thumbs up all the way. !
@malaymail Is the Mullah seeking fame. ?
@thetimes Human Rights violation  !
@CNN Prove it at the Primaries. !
@politico The change is noticeable. !
@HuffPost This Rep is off his mind !
@fmtoday Sabah wants Ubah says Warison
@malaymail Business company? Maybe a good discounted price !
@fmtoday From disappointment to credibility. It is already happening !
@fmtoday Contents of manifesto can be achieved. Give credit to what is being done now.
@adrianlimcheeen A questionable voice of a mullah. !
@daxmuhamad Voice of a bitter man. !
@malaysiakini Though late but necessary .
@fmtoday Should have been done long ago. !!
@theedgemarkets That will be left with how many more. ?
@TheSun Such loyalty !

@GlobalHM She deserves nothing !
@CNNPolitics What more Mr Trump? Mattis has said it .!
@UMonline We still need sharp schooters !
@mkula Hope no more cheating by anybody in future. !
@CNNPolitics US must react in more meaningful ways. Trump is suspect as he invariably links it to his business interests. !
@mkini_bm TH Let us hear the voices of the mullahs !
@malaymail Why the Perkasa rally ?
@fmtoday The lady is powerless.!
@KenRoth India must think carefully on their relationship with the Saudis !

@Ambiga_S Bless him!
@mkula @limkitsiang Another bye election ?
@fmtoday Blame the Saudis!
@malaymail Great idea. Don’t that die on the drawing board. !
@fmtoday Very good idea . This must be persued. Understand in India they have something like this too n it is working well .
@NST_Online Interesting !
@EricPaulsen101 Kelantan is always different.! I wonder why !
@weechookeong @chedetofficial @anthonyloke @fmtoday @MY_Airports @IATA Maybe Air Asia will pay the difference!
@CNNPolitics Let the ethics committee say it. !
@hannahyeoh @SyedSaddiq Well done .
@SenCortezMasto @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @CFPB They should not be rewarded. !
@CNNPolitics Can it be true  ?
@theborneopost Ask for help from the Cow lady.!
@501Awani A no ICERD rally is good for everyone !
@malaysiakini @titm_official A NO Icead rally is good for everybody !
@kalpenn @JohnBrennan Get it translated. Don’t give excuses.!
@malaysiakini @kinitv What an answer !
@EricPaulsen101 Looks like the lawyers are to be blamed too. !
@HuffPost If it is not climate change then what is it ?
@politico Isn’t Trump to be blamed ?
@malaymail Faking innocence. !
@Newsweek Tear gas on children is a Trump job.  !
@fmtoday People need to know !
@CNNPolitics Don’t be inhumane .
@SenateDems Workers losing jobs in Ford n GM .
@CNN Elvis would have come out of the grave if he heard that. !
@fmtoday Manifesto helped but Najib contributed to BN ‘s downfall. God ‘s will too!
@fmtoday Overinflated fears OR reluctant to change mindset ?
@fmtoday Some people are overplaying The ICERD card . Surely this won’t get them off the jail anyway !
@NST_Online There were Dalangs at work too !
@malaysiakini Land mark achievement !
@fmtoday Blind loyalty. !
@NST_Online Good suggestion !
@malaysiakini OR give thanksgiving sermons in the mosques !
@malaymail What about those who don’t know how to read Jawi. ?
@malaysiakini What are u saying ?
@staronline ICERD is not the immediate priority. Our unity n peace is important. We all should work towards this. !
@syahredzan @saifuddinabd Who judges whom as a Muslim. God or u ?
@malaymail Isn’t this obstruction of justice ?
@hannahyeoh @saifuddinabd Saifudin Abdullah is respectable gentleman well suited in the FM’s post. Must be a true Muslim. Why any doubts about his role in PH ?
@CNN He should go. !!!
@NajibRazak Murtabak promoter. !!!
@SenWarren Trump must have a motive for shutting himself off climate change ! Maybe he does not understand the subject at all !
@saifuddinabd Some comments on u are uncalled for Mr. Minister. Stay strong n steadfast. We will overcome these soon.
@malaysiakini Minus MCA n MIC. !
@malaysiakini @kinitv An offensive question !
@malaysiakini Why mix faith with policy ?
@malaysiakini Any reason or excuse will do !
@malaysiakini But maybe comrades in arm. !
@malaysiakini Is hard work discrimination. ?
@EricPaulsen101 Like some Bumiputra communities Orang Asli families also need aid n other help. They need that most.
@malaymail Fussing !
@malaymail They still need aid n help like other Bumiputras.  !
@EricPaulsen101 U can’t n will never be a man of moderation.  !
@mkini_bm Why ?
@guardiannews Self praise is no praise at all. !
@CNN Perhaps morally weak.!
@guardiannews Why the double standards. ?
@CNN America is not Trump alone. !
@theedgemarkets Tun M is right. Why are they denying it?
@mkini_bm More opposition MPs should support this move. That is cooperation.
@v_vivekkk Enough is enough. Can somebody put all this right !
@hmetromy Is the opposition trying to bully the new minister?
@malaymail The idea is good. It may not be viable for hotels to allow their pools to be used. Make it a 5 year program. Build pools in big schools n let them share with small schools. This idea will work. !
@malaymail N discussed what ?
@fmtoday Called Anwar for what purpose. ?
@fmtoday Scholarship from stolen money. ?
@malaymail Professional ties ?
@fmtoday @NajibRazak But Jho Loh was aided n abetted.  !
@politico Trump is a contradiction. !
@fmtoday Well said. Efficient service is important. Petitions won’t work.
@malaymail Good idea. Big schools can build swimming pools too.
@malaymail Our premier Mullah needs to be schoold !
@ABCPolitics A president who does not trust  his CIA is indirectly supporting the Saudis.
@hmetromy Permission is needed . Otherwise mullahs will interfere .
@mitchellreports It was all a publicity for Trump n his business. It is not America first but Trump first !
@malaymail MPSJ should also be pulled up. !
@limkitsiang They were unruly !
@saifuddinabd @chedetofficial This is not something new . Tun M has been saying this from those days !
@Nimalan21 @saifuddinabd With Malaysia Baru this must change.  !
@business @IngrahamAngle @bopinion But Trump does not understand that. !
@annafifield @jagowriter @joshrogin This is not diplomacy!
@louisliaw @saifuddinabd The guys took the law into their own hands. Must face the law !
@NAR We may face that soon.
@saifuddinabd To use race n religion is always a dangerous thing. We must not allow that .
@CNNPolitics It is not America first! It is Trumps business first. Hope Congress will do something .
@fmtoday He epitomises the great guys in BN. ARROGANCE. !
@maggieNYT @nytmike Now will he do that to Ivanka ?
@malaymail This is not what Malaysia Baru wants. !
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump US government must believe in their own CIA .!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Trump will have a good X Mas .
@fmtoday Why?
@CNNPolitics Wasn’t Hillary accused of the same thing?
@malaysiakini See how this mullah talks ?
@malaymail Can’t a Minister criticise  ?
@shahbudinE @Zahid_Hamidi @NajibRazak @ahmadmaslan @BiswardiHasbi @LokmanAdam It is race n religion again !
@NST_Online Have u any choice ?
@usatodayDC @USATODAY Threat to press freedom!
@mkula Yes that is the right thing!
@Newsweek Trump is challenging the courts !
@UMonline Why should we listen to these guys ? He is a Minister of the PH Government.
@McFaul @INTERPOL_HQ Interpol will become a Russian outfit.
@HuffPost U don’t give a grading to yourself. People should give u a grading. !
@fmtoday N Senator. !
@malaysiakini MCA n MIC. ?
@fmtoday Offensive remarks should be avoided. !
@malaymail The top guns are calling for merger but the members are crossing parties in big numbers!
@MalaysiaGazette A party leader n a Senate President should know better. !
@Daily_Express The billioner’s wife still spends taxpayers money.
@Newsweek He does not practice freedom of the in US .Period.
@Newsweek He bullies
@mkini_bm Umno available to marry any suitor ?  Siapa mahu kahwin ?
@malaymail Another race n religion get together. !
@malaysiakini @kinitv Probably your enemies want u to fade out of the Federal world.!
@malaymail Dewan Negara President needs to learn procedures n protocol !
@malaysiakini Musical chairs being played. !
@fmtoday Popularity. ?
@malaysiakini One time u did not allow anyone to talk about 1MDB. !
@PostBaron Trump does not value press freedom.  !
@HuffPost Envy ? OR laughing stock ?
@Reuters Why only Hindus ? India can do better !
@CNN @CNNOpinion Hillary please call it a day .
@EricPaulsen101 Pl do not force them. !
@bernamadotcom @SyedSaddiq Good suggestion. Will they do that when the old cows are still producing milk.!
@Newsweek When u keep on talking nonsense like this your credibility goes zero. !
@fmtoday Listen to Najib the expert. ! We would not have lost so much money !
@fmtoday Umno forgets that they are no more government!
@MalaysiaGazette Income Tax has a big list to work with. !
@fmtoday Don’t let anybody to use religion to further their personal interests.
@malaymail Good move.!
@malaymail Cat naps should be allowed. But should not be abused .!
@Newsweek It is not working. He may need medical attention. !
@malaymail Regulate child caregivers. It must be a regular affair n information on them must be well regulated.
@guardiannews What an excuse !
@fmtoday Perhaps we should rethink n re do the whole election .
@cnni But Trump thrives in the Twitter world. ?
@malaysiakini If the goods are the same then what’s the difference ?
@Ambiga_S @saifuddinabd We have to overcome this type of opposition which is bound to be there. PH must think of its commitment to the voters n its manifesto. Show u are different from BN. Then be prepared to lose Pru 15.
@aliranmalaysia Notorious guys are joining Party Pribumi now ! Why ?
@malaysiakini Who is warning whom ?
@fmtoday There is always a middle path !
@AJEnglish Are Saudis still innocent ?
@itvnews PM May is just carrying out Brexit  wanted.!
@mercan_resifi @saifuddinabd Good gesture.!
@thetimes @MatthewParris3 Blame those who voted in favour of Brexit .
@marklowen @lemondefr @SylvieKauffmann He has become a joke. !
@SenWarren Did US collude with the Saudis in attacking Yemen ?
@AriFleischer Is it mental ?
@mkula Maybe enough reasons for MACC to step in!
@chenweihua @ChinaDaily Then u should not have attended. !
@anwaribrahim Welcome to RPDYC Dato Seri.
@Newsweek He lies.
@suakeris @TSMusaHassan So PKR can be categorised as corrupt ?
@aliranmalaysia The lanuns must go. !
@mkula Go for them
@fmtoday Naik does not understand the multi racial set up of our country.
@WSJ Scandals all over.!
@abbydphillip @BrookeBCNN Is Trump a racist. ?
@Newsweek Trump looks hassled .
@Newsweek Behaving like a third world dictator !
@sahouraxo @TSMusaHassan Saudi must have a conscience. !
@DrRaisYatim Minister Anthony Loke will not like to see this !
@malaysiakini A good decision at last !
@zaidibrahim Tun M n Pakatan do not have to listen to Tun  Diam n his billionaire friends. But their advice have been good so far!
@SenSchumer @SenateDems That’s the right thing to do.
@malaymail Worrying but it is happening. !
@scheekeong @hannahyeoh @saifuddinabd Take away race from our sports world. Sports unites Malaysians. !
@fmtoday U may be somewhere else .!
@SkyNews Bring impeachment because of obstruction of justice !!
@MalaysiaGazette Hope he will be fine soon .
@fmtoday Delivery is slow !
@NBCPolitics OR a Disruptor. ?
@HuffPost He is just being obnoxious !
@realDonaldTrump Is Trump afraid of Mueller. ? Anything he does now will be construed as obstruction of justice !
@fmtoday Utusan should reflect the image n raayat ‘s picture of Malaysia Baru not mouthpiece of Umno. !
@KasthuriPatto Mr Umno President please take away the words race n religion when  fighting for your party . OR u can’t ?
@politico Trump appeared agitated with Democrat’s victory in the House. He was just going for the media guys. !
@Newsweek Obama is always Presendential . Trump behaves like a gangster .
@HuffPost Trump behaves like a street fighter. !
@Newsweek Pre existing medical conditions ?
@thetimes Pakistan should allow her to leave to any country that offers her asylum !
@Reuters Could Trump become lame ?
@SkyNews @tedcruz @BetoORourke Cruz will be out the next time. !
@malaymail My advice : if he is a liability then abandon him now. Wake up Umno. !
@NBCNews Yes that is correct. !
@mkini_bm Election to watch. Victory for Pakatan. !
@Pgkpm1 @saifuddinabd @JIIA_eng @chedetofficial Getting donations for Yemen is great but more laudable will be for our country to play a more serious  n in depth role in brokering peace to Yemen. !
@MalaysiaGazette The plane was not fit for flying. ! Lion Air n Boeing must be held accountable.
@Reuters Trump advocates racism. He is divisive. Vote out Republicans !
@Reuters These women will be formidable. !
@BarackObama Bring back America’s face n identity by voting Democrats. Trump does not represent the American value that we know of. He is worst than a third leader.
@fmtoday MCA must establish a new identity n free of any incumberances. The Chinese need a party like that to mirror n voice their feelings n reactions to Pakatan. Slowly u can regain support n strength n be ready for Pru 15.
@fmtoday Isn’t this the right time. ?
@malaysiakini Don’t Umno own Utusan. ?
@malaymail Your leadership was zero. U obstructed justice n used taxpayers money to buy people n votes .
@fmtoday PAC was used n abused. !
@malaysiakini Is 1 MDB faultless?
@Daily_Express Modi blunder. !

@cynthia_gabriel Fat hopes !
@malaysiakini Travel tax. Yes
@GOP @realDonaldTrump How prosperous is America n its people ?
@Pgkpm1 @saifuddinabd @getpaul We are with u. Do what u think is best for Malaysia Baru.
@fmtoday U are correct n off to politicians in sporting bodies. But some politicians still want to do that. They must be behaving their own agendas .
@MalaysiaGazette Baru tahu ka ?
@malaysiakini That itself is already a big saving. !
@CNN Why must Trump be always personal ?
@CNNPolitics The army is used to fight a war !
@malaysiakini A reasonable budget for all Malaysians. !
@Independent U learn from Israel !
@malaysiakini What charge ?
@limkitsiang He is trying to con the whole world. !
@MalaysiaGazette GST at 6 per cent was too high n a real burden to raayat. Caused your government to fall !
@malaymail A foreign PR chief ?
@ABCPolitics @jonkarl U are not fighting a war !
@HuffPost Cooking up stories to win votes !
@CNN How efficient is the White House these days. ?
@ABCPolitics @marykbruce U are not fighting a war ?
@Newsweek Fabricate ?
@bungamanggiasih @Ambiga_S @monaeltahawy Saudi Government laws are outdated. !
@fmtoday Paying up the debts u have left behind. ?
@malaysiakini What supremacy. ?
@HuffPost Can be challenged in court.!
@malaysiakini Is religion alone enough ? What about food n other necessities. Maybe Pas can provide !
@aliranmalaysia Good idea. !
@politico Should be challenged in court. !
@Newsweek Hillary got the popular vote. !
@IngrahamAngle @MailOnline Why protesters ?
@malaymail Why should Pakatan give important posts to ex Umno guys as soon as they join. Is Pakatan so hard up to get their services. The best way is to make them ordinary members for a term. They should only stand for party posts after one term.
@malaymail Will PKR do such a thing ?
@AJEnglish Why Australia. ?
@NAR Why ? Not Malaysia. ?
@EricPaulsen101 Whistle blowers are still not well protected. !
@malaymail Interesting !
@malaymail What supremacy are we talking of. ?
@HuffPost Sarah. are u anti the media ?
@malaysiakini All involved must face the law. Let the courts decide .
@malaymail Not surprising. !
@malaymail Do u need Pas. ?
@malaymail U could have done this yourself earlier. !
@CNNPolitics To fight with the Fourth Estate is to demolish Democracy. And Trump is just doing that. !
@NBCNews Trump mouthpiece. ?
@malaysiakini One way of him keeping busy. !
@HillaryClinton @BGTX Texas for Democrats !
@HuffPost Tell that to Trump.
@fmtoday It is serious.
@malaysiakini He is good n the right person.
@MalaysiaGazette What a loss ?
@HuffPost Who will ever think of a Noble Peace Price for Trump. ?
@malaymail They already have !
@fmtoday Party Zahid Hamidi. !
@MalaysiaGazette What is MP splitting hairs about ?
@fmtoday @NajibRazak A very considerate move. !
@fmtoday Could have been more civil !
@malaymail It will be a party of losers.!
@malaysiakini Is that correct ?
@MalaysiaGazette Don’t ask for a stage managed media interview any more .
@malaysiakini I don’t think it is a good idea. Indian Muslims should join PH.
@malaymail Tok Pa is a good guy . Will be great to prop up PH in the East Coast States.
@malaymail Shared prosperity n equal responsibility. No more rentier class I hope.
@mizik_25 @LatheefaKoya @klubbkiddkl A journalist was enough to ruffle up our great ex PM.  What about the prosecuting team ?
@malaysiakini Kelantan is still a poor state n not well run. Religion alone cannot bring food to the table. The leaders are well off. And the people ? Should seriously think of changing the Government !
@limkitsiang Birds of a feather !!!
@Newsweek No takers but Trump !
@tombrokaw Efficient FBI .!
@jagowriter We dint trust these guys n we won’t.  !
@fmtoday A good deal n a big saving !
@malaysiakini What about the people ?
@malaysiakini @kinitv U used taxpayers money to settle whose debts. ?
@fmtoday The plan is good. We need both Grab n separately taxi service too !
@mkini_bm Umno is quite divided these days. !
@JohnKasich What Trump is doing is Unamerican. ! What about his migrant background. ?
@HuffPost Does he realise the high security risk  ?
@malaymail A friend in need is a friend indeed. !
@malaysiakini For how long ?
@malaymail Curious to know what same circumstances mean ?
@fmtoday Minting money la. !
@Daily_Express Such opulence ?
@malaymail Another good move. ‘
@1Obefiend Is he God’s emmisary ?
@lelaki_solo He should get used to this emptiness these days. !
@hmetromy A state that has no money to pay the salaries ! What shall we call the state ?
@fmtoday Good income for a civil service man !
@malaymail He should know that by now !
@Newsweek The murder is also part of modernisation of the country. !
@malaysiakini Some leaders are funny. !
@fmtoday We need Grab n separately taxis too.
@fmtoday He has been making wierd statements recently.  !
@DailyMirror Her a father was a actor who could have financed her.
@mkini_bm Betul ka ?
@malaysiakini Reformasi from billioner th ... !
@fmtoday Are the laws sufficient? Are they been enforced degintly?  Have there been negligence ?
@HuffPost Should the Senator have done such a thing ?
@501Awani A very revolutionary idea !
@malaysiakini @kinitv Maybe his cousin can help him !
@malaysiakini I believe your leadership saw similar happenings. !
@501Awani So Najib is still the Superimo !
@MalaysiaGazette Together we fall.  !
@fmtoday Good idea !
@SCMPNews How beautiful is Ted Cruz. ?
@Newsweek This is an example of Trump’s nonsense. !
@fmtoday Why u and why now. ?
@CNN They need asylum. Period .
@malaysiakini @kinitv Since when. ?
@malaysiakini But our image abroad is also a vital aspect of our country. Don’t give the impression that we are a Kuching kurap country.
@malaymail Is it a good decision ?
@theedgemarkets I am still not sure. We need a change in mindset too. But are the civil servants getting more efficient. Slow may be  !
@MPOZAustralia Authorities are blamed too. Not being strict is one of the cause. !
@CNNPolitics Politicians should always avoid offensive remarks.  !
@Daily_Express And become a rogue state.  !
@fmtoday That is an ideal situation. But business people are still struggling with corruption. Minus corruption we will find more efficiency n less cost.
@politico It is just like Americans trusting Trump !
@usatodayvideo @USATODAY Die in a brawl. ?
@amnesty @Ambiga_S @JZarif @khamenei_ir Human rights. ?
@malaysiakini Don’t ask when free money is given. !
@SkyNews Are Consulates n embassies safe. ?
@mkini_bm Justifying receipt of stolen money !
@NajibRazak What a relaxed life ?
@aliranmalaysia Fifteen guys sent to kill somebody.  Killed in a fight ?
@malaysiakini Maybe RMK 12. !
@politico What is so great about the statement . The world has lost a great journalist. !
@aliranmalaysia Cyber spy industry ?

@mkini_bm Good. It is high time!
@HuffPost Maybe Saudi regime can now qualify to be a Rogue State. !
@malaysiakini Well said DSAI. U become our conscience keeper. !
@malaysiakini Najib just gives very simplistic reasons.
@NBCPolitics Trump must not favour the Saudi Kingdom. It has numerous human rights violations.!
@Independent Republicans should blame Trump for the defeat .
@MalaysiaGazette It must be checked n not allowed to become a habit. Not like other parties.
@shanmuga_k @Ambiga_S Some thing new  !
@zaidibrahim Are they with one voice ?
@MalaysiaGazette Hope he gets good lawyers.!
@malaysiakini So u failed! Tun M is right in going for the crooked bridge !
@fmtoday Get a good lawyer.
@Newsweek Tax cuts mean less income. !
@msianinsight Angkat bodeh !
@CNNPolitics Very well said Senator. For Trump it is all money.
@hmetromy Isn’t PKR another UMNO in the making. ?
@HuffPost A rude guy. !
@SinarOnline Be an consummate MP. !
@fmtoday It is a must. The sooner the better. Corruption should be wiped out!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump needs the prayers for the mid term elections .
@malaysiakini There is lot of changes needed . There should always be a level playing field. Don’t let the big parties take advantage.
@malaymail Hope she will contribute toward a compassionate Islam in Malaysia .
@malaysiakini Yes but not that bad la.
@MalaysiaGazette I thought JASA was not needed any more !
@MalaysiaGazette Is this a new trend. ? Show u are different from BN.
@fmtoday More titles for PH then BN   !
@CNN Does it really matter. ?
@hmetromy A father mother daughter party. Who’s next. ?
@politico Trump needs that prayer !
@NajibRazak Fellow Parliamenterians. !
@fmtoday The award list looks bigger than that of BN.  !
@NewsBFM We should insist on local candidates not imported one.  !
@malaysiakini People are beginning to react. PD by election will indicate direction. Do voters still prefer PH ?
@malaymail Too many PH people getting titles. New trend are ?
@_muhammadRais What is the work of MDPD. ?
@FoxNews @GreggJarrett More Trump cronies will come in !
@malaysiakini Why now? What were u doing when u were PM ?
@malaymail A hero for the people n the country !
@SinarOnline What hypocrisy from a kleptomaniac  !
@fmtoday Ta payah parti kechil. !
@malaysiakini Is Pas part of the State Government. ?
@malaymail There are many more things being done. Voters will understand if there is a delay with good reasons. Don’t let full adherence shackle the implementation of the manifesto.
@fmtoday Does not convincing. !
@HuffPost Could be a mental. !
@Ambiga_S Welcome news. !
@theSundaily It looked like a good suggestion that PH can follow.  !
@malaysiakini What assets have been sold so far. ?
@malaysiakini Public expects a higher standard from Malacca ex co man. !
@malaymail What if he joins Umno after the election. ? Wait n see .
@malaysiakini The conscience keeper of our country.  !
@zaidibrahim MP first PM later!
@SinarOnline Exgeration !
@limkitsiang As though Najib did not that. !
@fmtoday Why two laws ?
@malaysiakini Is that allowed. ?
@thomasfullerNYT Like third world countries. !
@SinarOnline Blinding passion sometimes yield bitter fruits. !
@NewsBFM But some people are impatient. !
@fmtoday How can a man who has landed us with a one trillion ringgit debt talk like this ?
@SinarOnline Perfect the system without embarrassing people. How good are moral police !
@zaidibrahim Tun M has spoken on this. !
@EricPaulsen101 Still with the opposition mentality. !
@zaidibrahim Saman is old fashion. This is Malaysia Baru.
@mkini_bm Set more rules . Possibility of more infractions. Must create level playing field. !
@theSundaily They don’t value savings. They relish spending. !
@MalaysiaGazette Close the party or merge lah. !
@Daily_Express Fashionista. !
@malaysiakini Isn’t that a government decision ? Minister or PM ?
@Ambiga_S Isn’t there a limit to election expenses ?
@malaymail Another flip flop !
@Ambiga_S Not in the vocabulary of Malaysia Baru !
@zaidibrahim Khalwat is a tool used by some ulamas. It has no place in Malaysia Baru !
@MalaysiaGazette Do we need his help ?
@DSAIsupporters @mkula Tun M n DSAI will make PD great n a PM town.
@malaymail Yes yes yes Let religion be between u  and God.
@fmtoday What is Pas trying to prove ? It is not a party for non Malays.  !
@malaysiakini Excellent idea. ! Tks for thinking out of the box. !
@fmtoday @SyedSaddiq Just ask MACC to investigate before more money is lost.
@malaymail Well said.
@EricPaulsen101 That’s it. Tun M n Malaysia Baru.
@malaymail What a tragedy. ?
@Independent Fraud. ?
@HuffPost Abnormal ?
@fmtoday Who is an independent judge . ? What about some of the judges u had before u earlier on. ?
@SenWarren @SenSanders @RepRoKhanna @amazon @fightfor15 Federal minimum wages should be raised too !
@MelGohCNA @xrockybrux Some things can be true !
@syahredzan @saifuddinabd Washington Times is an insignificant mosquito paper. Should not compare with likes of Wall Street Journal !
@fmtoday Likewise people can tell stories about u too.!
@HuffPost He has gone bonkers. !
@malaymail Another thriller. !
@fmtoday What a cheap thing! So money can do everything ?
@malaysiakini Another visit ?

@zaidibrahim Welcome to PD Waterfront.
@fmtoday So be it.Hope all other retirees can work up to 95. !
@syedhamidalbar Only few leaders speak like this n only few countries take such a stand.  !
@Newsweek Ford probably over dramatised the whole thing. !
@EricPaulsen101 She is a disappointment. !
@fmtoday He is just opposition . Dismiss his story. One time he never liked Tun M. !
@501Awani Guan Eng must listen to the opposition too!
@mkula How independent? Any bite ?
@mpklang @staronline The whole world must boycott that lady !
@malaymail N free with vitamin M. !
@MalaysiaGazette Another warlord .!
@malaysiakini More orange shirts are needed.
@malaysiakini Is there a direction ?

@fmtoday Did DAP ask for a unity government. ?
@fmtoday But they now know u as part of the kle p... gang.  !
@malaysiakini The guru . And the wrong one.  !
@MalaysiaGazette Masalah macam apa ?
@malaysiakini Why unity government now ?
@MalaysiaGazette Good suggestion. But some people should also be sacked. !
@malaysiakini Also feel that way. Groping!
@MalaysiaGazette But u are symbolic of success !
@malaysiakini Why obsession with a unity government ? When the raayat has rejected Umno ?
@fmtoday Hadi is not part of PH. We do not have to listen to him. He has ulterior motives.
@malaymail Economic aid from Malaysia to US.  What a joke !
@malaysiakini PD voters will reject u .
@malaymail U don’t qualify any more. PD voters will reject u .
@malaymail What about arrogance n corruption. ?
@SinarOnline It is not cleaning the beaches only .More needs to be done in PD. Railway from  S ‘ban to PD should be revisited as it will bring in tourists . Highway from KLIA to PD must be https://t.co/btJThda2Ml gets congested. Overhead roads must be planned n implemented.  Etc etc .
@malaysiakini What a reunion meeting   !
@fmtoday @YouTube It is funny. The guy was afraid to stand in the last election. He is standing to break votes. Just an agent. He has lost before he won.  !
@ArenaHM @hmetromy It is a rip off !
@MalaysiaGazette It is a sure win.
@NajibRazak A warm welcome to a new Umno. !
@hannahyeoh Not a Michele Yeoh please .
@malaysiakini Never.
@SinarOnline Is something wrong with Berjasa in Negri. ?
@fmtoday Is that an excuse to leave Umno ? In the last election he was afraid to stand in PD. Why now ?
@theSundaily OMG
@mkula Same old story. !
@fmtoday A very familiar face ...!
@MailOnline I am sure this will be great news in our country !
@malaysiakini And I spent freely. !
@saifnasution @501Awani @bharianmy Good choice .
@malaysiakini Insist on a suite. !
@Independent U are not a clown Mr. Trump.
@malaymail Would have n should have? No unity maybe !
@HuffPost They loved his clowning. !
@malaysiakini Changes like what  ?
@malaysiakini Sounds like a false hope !
@fmtoday Yes spend as u like n put the government into a one trillion debt.
@EricPaulsen101 Malaysia must play a leading role.
@aliranmalaysia Isn’t Umno destined to be opposition for some time. ?
@Independent Isn’t he a laughing stock. ?
@theSundaily JJ was a secret billioner....  Any more please put up your hand .
@malaysiakini @kinitv Irony : today Wan Azizah chairs the cabinet . First woman n history.
@malaysiakini A lady ‘s first. Congrats.
@arabnews @Media_Selangor Is somebody missing there  ?
@fmtoday Callings are a plenty.  !
@syahredzan @hannahyeoh People should not forget his perseverance commitments dedication n sacrifice . The same goes for his party colleagues. Nothing is on the platter.
@zaidibrahim Wait for the Hollywood movie under same title Billion Dollar Whale !
@malaymail Nice to see our FM exposed to UN role !
@EricPaulsen101 We must play the leadership role.
@NBCNightlyNews @mitchellreports All that he said must be verified. OR bull ?
@fmtoday @Hishammuddinh20 What nonsense. ?
@niknazmi Not join . Take the lead. !
@malaysiakini Why should they ? Suite to Orange ?
@malaymail Other things have not gone up. Why should fish food n restaurant prices go up ? More stringent enforcement needed. Do it before raayat n opposition react.
@cnni Does Trump represent America. ? Sadly NO.
@CNNPolitics Part of his speech are lies ! Americans know that. !
@malaymail Will PPBM become an Umno offshoot or outfit ?
@SenWarren The housing secretary is a black. Ironically!
@malaymail Obama did not go to Najib . Probably Najib would have gone to Obama! Sometimes the lobbyist would have done the work. !
@malaysiakini Why Chinese letter ?
@fmtoday Malay interest or self interest ?
@malaysiakini Looks like a near walkover For DSAI.  !
@CNNPolitics U don’t report after 30 years. !
@tiniz @Ambiga_S Are Tafiz special. ? No our mullahs make them special. !
@malaysiakini An ominous sign !
@NewsBFM Why further education? When 18 is matured for many things!
@NAR 5 G will dominate the world soon !
@501Awani Excuse him. He is only doing the work of an opposition politician.
@fmtoday Then what happens?
@politico Everything is old n blurry. Like stirring Sh... t
@NajibRazak N won US ten million not billions.  !
@malaysiakini Dissolve BN n be a good opposition.
@malaysiakini UMNO  Don’t let the warlords decide. LET the delegates decide.
@hannahyeoh Well done. !
@NAR Unshakle the Chinese hegemony. !
@SkyNews Where there is a will there is a way.  !
@limkitsiang Another sandiwara
@zaidibrahim Why is the Ministry hesitating. TAFIZ has been in headlines too long. !
@SenWarren @SecPompeo Where is US conscience ?
@zaidibrahim Most of the mullahs choose to keep silent when we need their views n participation most !
@fmtoday Why shouldn’t they pay ?
@SinarOnline A loan is a loan. Borrowers must pay n make attempts to pay up. Outstanding amount of 36 billion ringgit is too much. Why the leniency. ?
@syedhamidalbar Are people expecting different treatment? OR are we having two laws. ?
@malaysiakini Well said !
@fmtoday They wanted votes. !
@MalaysiaGazette Pusan Tafiz still not well regulated n supervised.
@malaysiakini Here’s the way to do it:- bring the Fedreal Law in first. Then convince the States to follow suite like Selangor. We got to  start somewhere. !
@fmtoday All complaints must be looked into. !
@fmtoday @YouTube Why give discretionary powers to the officers. ? Make all those to wear. Review SOP.
@niknazmi @LeeChongWei Hope u recover soon. God bless.
@fmtoday Hope IPCMC is independent n with enforcement powers. !
@Jeff4Malaysia POS Malaysia needs rejuvenation. Is it part of Malaysia Baru ? OR still BN? U choose. I prefer DHL.
@mitchellreports Isn’t Trump interfering?
@CNN Trump must be restrained from his authoritarian tendencies !
@mkula Another good news !
@malaysiakini Victim of a BN defeat. !
@NewsBFM A book as witness ?
@theSundaily Do u need them ?
@NBCNews It reveals a lot of things. !
@malaysiakini @kinitv Bad luck? U did not get a donation !
@SinarOnline Yes yes yes if we all work hard. !
@malaysiakini Good show. Now make it work. !
@Ambiga_S Will they do that. ?
@fmtoday Enforcement my friend. !
@fmtoday They can still be made relevant n useful to those who voted them.  !
@fmtoday Very noble statement. Little late !
@Jeff4Malaysia More on the way. I heard.
@RTM_Malaysia Mr Mister please ask your Ministry to relook at all those holding diplomatic passports other than Wismaputra officials. I get a feeling that the previous government has abused this privilege.Tks.
@malaymail Umno is losing its direction n significance .!
@MalaysiaGazette Wrong! Who will do this. ?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Does US have to do this. ?It has lost its moral importance.!
@fmtoday Tok Pa is an embodiment of a consummate politician. One of those guys who was outstanding in the previous government. Of his experience n services can be used n continued.
@Jeff4Malaysia Go for high end use of rubber not just a rubber producer .
@zaidibrahim Why is there a delay on this  issue. ?
@malaysiakini Umno has lost one decent politician in Tok Pa. shouldn’t he have done that long ago?
@SinarOnline Why Jho Low only? What about the other big man ?
@zaidibrahim Well said Dato. But in today’s world people use loyalty quite freely n is thrown off when not necessary.   !
@theSundaily A political blackout for Singaporeans May be necessary too. !
@Jeff4Malaysia Why favour Air Asia only. ?
@fmtoday So isolate DAP.  ! Must be joking.  All u guys have become clowns.!
@malaysiakini It’s a joke !
@Jeff4Malaysia Pas guys are noted for oat ostancaious living. !
@hmetromy High time !
@501Awani Pas is courting MCA. !
@malaysiakini Then who is the opposition. ?
@DailyMirror Must be a nut. !
@501Awani Betul betul !
@malaymail Isn’t that the arrangement ?
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews It was a work in progress. Obama started it .
@malaysiakini Umno only wants to be in the government.  !
@fmtoday Media publicity is not enough. Prove it court.
@CNN It is unethical for anyone to bring past cases like this. Don’t do that to destroy a man ‘s career. !
@malaymail Maybe sooner. !
@fmtoday Can see this in two families. !
@malaysiakini It is not ethics but political expediency. !
@malaysiakini Does courting mean infiltration ?
@fmtoday Doesn’t this sound weird. ?
@malaysiakini Can’t be true.  !
@fmtoday Why not ? The election is necessary n in the interest of the party n the nation .
@malaymail That should be the way.
@malaymail People ‘s choice.
@malaysiakini Danyal is a hero. PKR should be thankful to the Dato. !
@malaysiakini @kinitv Clash of the giants. !
@Jeff4Malaysia A drop out.  ?

@fmtoday Sounds a great idea.  !
@malaymail An innocent man speaking. !
@fmtoday Is it in Negeri ?
@fmtoday Join the bandwagon. !
@fmtoday It will look the same. !
@malaysiakini People will respect u if u had asked for a  RCI when u were part of the then Government. !
@malaymail Cooperation. ?
@malaysiakini Nonsense!
@HRDipendra @saifuddinabd Is it a fashion for PMs to keep money in their houses?
@tictoc @SyedSaddiq N a dynamic one !
@fmtoday PD is a safe seat!
@malaymail So u are part of the kitchen cabinet ?
@FoxNews @VP @nytimes Yes Unamerican ! What about the Unamerican things Trump has been doing ?
@Khairykj @DARDOfficial Why din’t u  n the previous government do it ?
@theSundaily So Pas did not get any Umno votes.
@limkitsiang Welcome back. !
@malaysiakini Did they keep cash in their houses ? What is the role of the Treseurer ?
@realDonaldTrump US is also to be blamed. U but every damn thing from China. !
@EricPaulsen101 Don’t do  Lee Kuan Yew   !
@malaymail Yes yes yes
@malaysiakini When is the honeymoon. ?
@adibahnoor @Shilaamzah Get the person arrested .
@Independent Can we believe his story. ? Usually he is noted for not telling telling the truth.  !
@Jeff4Malaysia Hope it is not ramai. !
@malaymail Pas Government lah !
@NajibRazak Hope the authorities can release some details to the former PM !
@malaymail Good show. Let them protest . No arrest.
@SyedSaddiq What is the Home Minister doing ?
@malaysiakini Should be released !
@Ambiga_S Let them protest. PH should be more tolerant. !
@Newsweek Aren’t u the cause. ?
@theborneopost MACC must take heed of the request.
@malaysiakini We are still in big debts. !!!
@malaysiakini Race n religion ? Can this work ?
@malaysiakini At first no fee but now from a former PM to the lawyer. Interesting. !
@fmtoday An alliance that spells a bad n dangerous trend for the country. !
@malaysiakini Smile of a new bride / groom of an impending marriage between Umno n Pas. Hurrah
@malaymail Outdated thinking. !
@malaysiakini Olympic Council should help. .
@malaysiakini An irresponsible statement !
@zaidibrahim Telepathy ha   !
@NajibRazak I wonder what goes in the mind of the Rojak Mama  !
@CNN What words to describe your own AG. ?
@theSundaily Is Trengganu influenced by the Mullahs. ?
@niknazmi It is a good idea. !
@Khairykj @maszlee @IIUMOnline Betul. !
@falah_se7en @Khairykj @maszlee Why is the Minister getting involved ?
@malaysiakini A new liaison. !
@theSundaily Do not allow states to take the law into their own hands.
@malaymail They should have realised that it was a weak case from the beginning. !
@mpklang @AJEnglish Against   China ‘s economic colonialism. !
@CNN Federer should retire. !
@CNNPolitics Both will be losers. !
@malaysiakini Yes RTM is still relevant. It needs relook revamp n strutural change. Make it competitive. Compare with CNN n BBC. Right now we can give 4 out of 10. Long way to go la !
@fmtoday Then why the canning. ?
@malaymail N a curse from the rest of humanity. !
@malaysiakini Tuan sahaja. ?
@Newsweek Good decision. !
@malaysiakini Did Pas ask for a white paper on 1MDB ?
@fmtoday Weaknesses everybody has but that should not be used as an excuse.
@NajibRazak BN cannot be blamed. It needs a lot of praise !£
@malaysiakini What to do if that community does not change ?
@MalaysiaGazette Shybas !!!
@malaysiakini OR Malaysia semua Boleh ?
@IngrahamAngle @BreitbartNews Does Trump like that ?
@fmtoday It is also a different political landscape !
@macfaisal @hannahyeoh I don’t think Umno is letting them do that. Probably they are used as front men. What say KJ ?
@zaidibrahim Dato, Is it self imposed silence ?
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ellisonbarber Stop threatening .
@FoxNews Trump wants to make US richer !
@Newsweek Naughty eyes !
@malaysiakini Tell that in court n tell also who asked u to do that. !
@msianinsight This a dangerous insinuation. !
@fmtoday Siapa kata. ?
@realDonaldTrump They are not after u. They are after Russia. !
@malaysiakini Words of a loser. !
@imfsea_aruna @chedetofficial Why are people still expecting handouts. ? What will happen to the country if just want to live on handouts n corrupt money ?
@malaymail From the air.  !
@USATODAY That’s a pretty impressive number  !
@saifuddinabd Still confusing.! He says something else. !
@Newsweek Looks like it. !
@ABCPolitics Mr Vice President Why u quating the President all the time.?
@malaysiakini @kinitv A party should have been held at Shangrila.  !
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Democrats should get the Republicans votes out .!
@malaysiakini @kinitv But GST was good for u.  !
@malaysiakini @kinitv What does this man know about moral questions. ? Ha ha ha
@staronline @mkula Great !!!
@theSundaily Trump is operating in isolation. No cabinet no White House !
@ABCPolitics Scaremongering!!!
@malaysiakini Salute DAP a matured n responsible party.!
@ahmadmaslan What a Malaysia Baru. ! Without the lanuns n a thieving Government. Celebrate well!
@thehill Not all Trump says is correct.!
@DarellLeiking It is our Merdeka too. Together we will all celebrate. !!!
@AwaniReview @Ambiga_S Make it our way ...
@malaysiakini An example of the wealth the oppulant life stile showcases what the previous government was n stood for. We may hear n see many more. !!!
@Ambiga_S It is the raayat ‘s day. Celebrate to the fullest. U made it work n u need to enjoy Merdeka.
@PaulMayATL Can Trump be like him?
@malaymail Competition is good.
@Independent Trump did not do enough.

@mkula Hope PKR wins the case !
@malaysiakini @kinitv Do young voters like PAS ?
@BBCNews He talks like a third world leader.
@realDonaldTrump What about the wall ?
@NajibRazak Of course not realistic! What about the rates u have dealt with?
@mandeepkarpall @Ambiga_S @bersih2 Today we have Malaysia Baru.! Be grateful as it is God’s gift .
@malaymail Malays can be strong n are strong. It is only a perception  that they are weak. Why feel weak all the time. !
@henrykoh45 @EricPaulsen101 @FortifyRights @pakatanharapan_ It is for this reason we need ICPMC.
@NewsBFM Pl do that. There have been a lot of abuses. Political giveaways too. Those qualified did not get it n there were many just enjoying taxpayers  money.!
@malaymail Right move but aim to ban child marriage.
@SCMPNews @shirleyZhaoXY Should have water taxis from Mainland to Penang !
@malaymail ECRL is necessary. If the price is right should go ahead with that !
@saifuddinabd All previous government ‘s program need not be abandoned. Some are people oriented n necessary too. Put away the ego n think of ways n means to continue with these programs . In the end u still have to meat people ‘s wishes n not yours.
@realDonaldTrump So it is a bilateral agreement n nothing to do with NAFTA.!
@CNN @CillizzaCNN He appears confused. !
@cassleeyy Well said . She is a Malaysian first .
@fmtoday Abuse of power. !
@malaysiakini Ex Minister u have no excuses for what u did. !
@khalidkarim @Jeff4Malaysia We still have lots of poor people ! Brim or any form subsidy is still necessary for these people .
@n_izzah The guy is not right choice. !
@malaysiakini Why Anwar. ?
@Newsweek Another Trump scandal. !
@hannahyeoh Brim was abused. Deserving people still need it.  It should come  under social welfare. It will then look meaningful.
@malaymail Individuals n companies have the right to sue the government for not releasing the refunds in time. !
@malaysiakini Giving Brim should have been selective.
@malaysiakini His ham should have known that ! No reasons can justify what he has done. Period.
@niknazmi Let us wait for the results. Is the new liason between Pas n Umno going to work
@fmtoday The Minister should have discontinued using those escorts. He also knew that  he was not entitled to  government paid escorts. !
@malaysiakini It was used to get votes. !
@fmtoday Well said. We all should follow that principle !
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Must respect unionism !
@politico A great loss to US n the Republicans. An honest n principled man !
@malaysiakini The extra vagansas will be off I hope. !
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC So time to change yr A G. !
@fmtoday N 6 per cent GST tax from poor people. ?
@malaysiakini Escorts for a fallen government minister. !
@hmetromy Brim has always been viewed as a vote catching tactic.  !
@501Awani All animal lovers will love to hear this. !
@Newsweek New meaning to crime. !
@malaysiakini Really. ?
@NajibRazak This is not criticism. It the words of a arm chair critic. !
@fmtoday @NajibRazak @pakatanharapan_ He must be joking.  !
@malaysiakini Days o extra vagansas must be reduced. !
@SenWarren @EPAAWheeler @EPA Trump n his cronies are involved in corruption in many forms !
@tonyfernandes @mkula Tony ‘s encouraging words are most welcome. All Malaysians must take that attitude.
@mkini_bm @saifuddinabd New kid on the block  !
@teresakok Good move  !
@CNNPolitics Interference ?
@malaysiakini @mkula Should find an answer .
@malaysiakini @mkula Economic colonialism  !
@Newsweek Another threat ?
@malaysiakini @mkula @kinitv What has Jibby got to say to this. ?
@CNNPolitics Are these treats. ?
@malaymail How can it be a success when the previous PM has messed everything up. !
@AC360 @CNN @David_Gergen Look at the guys around him n the charges they are facing. It is a matter of time  before he is implicated. !
@fmtoday Hard time but raayat will go through it. They must.
@malaymail Another money making scamp n a disaster for Mic. !!!
@CNNPolitics Was Manafaat the conduit for Trump ‘s campaign financing. ?
@SenWarren He claims to have the best people. !!!
@MalaysiaGazette Tks. N good show Tun Diam
@malaysiakini Good show. That is responsibility.
@malaymail Good. Pl don’t take foreign doctors who can’t speak Malay or English.
@CNN Republicans are only yes men to Trump.
@FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton @netanyahu Is Israel running US Foreign Policy. ?
@malaysiakini Very well put. !
@CNN Black is Taboo for Trump.!
@malaysiakini Is MCA n Umno meant for only one race. ?
@lawrencelow85 @chedetofficial @protoncar Let’s see a new direction for Proton !
@fmtoday The MPs need to reform themselves. !
@realDonaldTrump The more he says that the more I believe that there was collusion. !
@SenWarren Indirectly US is responsible !
@NBCNews @PeterAlexander Talk about pardon even before he is sentenced ! What system.  ?
@bernamadotcom @chedetofficial Malaysia Baru.  !
@mitchellreports Did they go home for the weekend ?
@NBCNews The interest is because he is the President of US !
@malaymail N English !
@malaysiakini Less sugar for better health. !
@malaymail It is still a failure !
@malaysiakini @StPinkie What about a zero for Pas ?
@theborneopost What was the fine about ?
@malaysiakini @kinitv Must have been instructed to that. To save somebody’s head .
@fmtoday A new party to nowhere !
@malaysiakini BN makes good opposition but responsible . Not yet! Let PH run the government for some time.
@SharaadKuttan Do not use Islam to deal with LGBT
@hmetromy Give preference to Malaysians first !
@malaysiakini He should be referred for that unparliamentary word.
@Newsweek He probably does not know that dogs are loving animals. More loving than some human beings.
@Jeff4Malaysia It is nostalgic. I was one of the officers accompanying him in his earlier official trips. Have a successful trip Tun.
@CNNPolitics News media will always remain friends of the people !
@matthewfsmith @EricPaulsen101 @FortifyRights Great !
@fmtoday Why use the illegal route ?
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 One lady is going to be unhappy !
@EricPaulsen101 Is there a political will? Then the government should go the extra mile.
@EricPaulsen101 It should be part of Malaysia Baru.
@fmtoday Nobody should rush to take BN members. A waiting period is essential.
@bernamaradio @mkula Engagement is important.
@fmtoday It is against Human Rights !
@malaymail LGBT community should be part n parcel of Malaysia Baru. They should not be alienated. It is also against Human Rights !
@EricPaulsen101 @mkula Mic could not do much . N the voters are aware of this.
@faekah_qkn5 Talk n write in Bahasa. Can talk English lah...
@staronline @mkula Good move.
@malaymail What about English in Wismaputra? Very essential. !
@CNN Zero
@politico He needs a bottom n a nipple. Ha ha
@limkitsiang U.  Can now see a lot of pretence in this man !
@malaymail He now qualifies.
@adrianlimcheeen We all use Bahasa Malaysia. But why are Malay friends afraid of the English language ?
@Newsweek Trump listens to knowbody !
@fmtoday @NajibRazak U still talk ! N have left a big hole in our economy !
@fmtoday They are still God’s creation.!
@NajibRazak Should we still listen to this man ?
@malaymail Umno should think it that way. Is Najib still relevant ?
@malaysiakini @AnnuarMusa @anwaribrahim Country needed him long ago !
@fmtoday Why dint u say this earlier?
@CNN Soon there will be none. White House is getting Whiter !
@politico Black is Taboo !
@politico Trump White House requires more Blacks to make US more American !
@malaysiakini Or the lanuns !
@malaymail Have more guys from Kinabtagan !
@malaysiakini U stood for whom ?
@Khairykj KJ asking Jho Loh to come back! But his PM was keeping him from coming back!
@malaysiakini Do it. Our ex PM will become more notorious !
@fmtoday Islam is my religion but everybody wants to own it !
@malaymail Maybe because they want u to be one all yr life !
@_PHSupporter Can Najib explain why GST refund not given back in time?
@Jeff4Malaysia What about the present cabinet ?
@nowthisnews Why the double standard?
@brianklaas @Ambiga_S Is Trump reckless?
@malaysiakini Should have done that immediately after Pru 14.
@malaymail It is a rogue country. We don’t have to rush in opening our mission.
@KenRoth @saifuddinabd Saudi Government has its flaws too.
@LLakhdhir @EricPaulsen101 @hrw @NeelaGhoshal Pl respect transgender rights. They deserve that.
@HajiMat5 @mkula Is Kelantan a cruel government?
@malaymail Imagine what is going to happen to Umno before that!

@malaysiakini Clever fellas!
@malaysiakini All in the family.
@Ambiga_S Good show Tun. If possible give them all bumiputra rights.

@nav7sign @MOTMalaysia @anthonyloke @JPJ_Malaysia JPJ wake up
@NewsBFM Great. At last u are on your own feet!
@AzminAli @anwaribrahim Happy birthday DSAI
@syahredzan The present government should know that!
@malaysiakini The thinking should be more positive in Malaysia Baru.
@zoerandhawa @Ambiga_S The Minister  must be careful. He seems to be promoting previous government ‘s policies. I am sure under Malaysia Baru the thinking should be different.
@Jeff4Malaysia That is what makes Umno rich.!
@malaysiakini Umno is a rich party!
@fmtoday Why the hesitation. Must be abolished.
@fmtoday Sad.
@Jeff4Malaysia I had expected this to happen. Has the money disappeared?
@EricPaulsen101 Did the Minister give in to pressure?
@malaysiakini I have always said that GST was good for the then Government.
@mkini_bm @RTM_Malaysia Good choice but won’t your blog conflict with your new assignment?
@malaysiakini Good choice. Congrats Kadir. Any help needed?
@saifuddinabd Sir, why has Malaysia not signed the UN convention on Statelessness?
@MalaysiaGazette Another Tamilnadu ikon has passed.
@NewsBFM But please tell the MP from Sabah to refrain from using unparliamentary words. It stinks.!
@malaysiakini @kinitv Debts u mean.
@malaysiakini Yes if u have been telling the truth!
@politico Careful. They may bug Capitol Hill !
@ABCPolitics Very much so!
@malaysiakini @kinitv But u came back to do a dirty job.!
@politico To get such information from a foreign country is treason.
@saifuddinabd Any bantuan?
@kalkitoos Old story!
@fmtoday At last!
@malaymail Something must be done!
@malaysiakini If it taxpayers money let us be convinced.
@limkitsiang A speech for the party’s downfall!
@BBCWorld For help to win the elections.
@malaysiakini Nonsense!
@hannahyeoh LGBT are also God’s creation. !
@malaysiakini The lady definitely broke some rules!
@realDonaldTrump Stop blaming others. Very Unamarican.
@pemilihanPKR @saifuddinabd @anwaribrahim @KEADILAN The right decision n step to provide leadership for PKR. We must grow to become the party for the the believers in a multi racial country. N no race politics.
@malaysiakini Raced based politics will further destroy BN n slowly see its demise.
@zuibrahim @Ambiga_S @saifuddinabd He has ample qualifications to make a good FM.
@staronline @mkula If that is the trend we can see the death trend for BN n Umno.
@bersih2 Why delay? Badawi n Najib couldn’t do. Pakatan can.
@malaysiakini He even fiddled with Socso money.
@scheekeong @mkula Nonsense!
@aliranmalaysia Nonsense!
@malaysiakini U are right KJ. It makes like all Umno members are not thinking straight!
@politico Don’t listen to lier Trump.
@limkitsiang Pas Umno alliance. Is it for real?
@malaysiakini Protest against Pakatan maybe but anger against BN still there.
@Fred9Fareed @saifuddinabd The guy has double standards!
@AshvinderSingh That would have been the case. Devine intervention!
@malaysiakini No votes for the lanuns.
@malaymail Sale with proper tender please.
@SyedSaddiq A beautiful family pix to be cherished.
@mpklang @mkini_bm Religion again!
@NajibRazak Who is talking about beban raayat.?
@hannahyeoh U will go in history as a lavish man using taxpayers money.
@malaysiakini It is still religion!
@fmtoday Abang adik!
@dyanasmd Umno sahaja!
@malaysiakini Where did the funds go?
@anwaribrahim Thank u for taking care of our next PM.
@Media_Selangor Orang kaya Umno—- memang
@fmtoday @barisanasional @PASPusat Abang adik!
@NewsBFM KJ should be very proud.
@fmtoday Someone must be right.
@malaymail Another good decision!
@NewsBFM It is a monopoly n there have been abuses. Open up the services.
@EricPaulsen101 It is a Pakatan government. Why are we hesitating? BTN should be scrapped.
@malaysiakini What about the 3 billion losses?
@malaymail I think u should.
@fmtoday They are not angels!
@malaysiakini Utusan is a party paper.
@fmtoday Intel chief should have been neutral. Was she?
@NewsBFM Should take an haircut too!
@malaysiakini Is it the truth ?
@malaymail Did not know that Khazanah was involved in lingerie business!
@aliranmalaysia The previous directors must have been wizards in lingerie business!
@malaymail What a lost n on what items?
@malaysiakini Yes why buy an opposition paper?
@malaymail Say that he did a national service. For u or the country?
@fmtoday @NajibRazak Sounds a familiar phrase. !
@malaymail If it is good for the country why not?
@Ambiga_S MAIS u are great!
@malaysiakini It is bad if it devides the party into two!
@malaysiakini Expensive taste at taxpayers money.
@malaysiakini @StPinkie An offensive remark
@malaysiakini @AzalinaOthmanS @pakatanharapan_ Am more concerned about the lanuns. When are they facing their charges?
@NajibRazak I wonder what our Pahalawans think of u?
@fmtoday Mat Sabu is no cartoon. He is a true patriot.
@ZainudinMaidin @saifuddinabd A new trend. Part of Malaysia Baru.
@malaysiakini Unnecessary demand.
@SyedSaddiq @SafirulAbuBakar @nfdpmalaysia Let us have professional football. That’s the answer to improve our football standard.
@malaysiakini Korea does that. Japan too n so does China
@SCMPNews Try to sack him!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Trump must have told u to say that!
@Jeff4Malaysia OMG. What accountability?
@fmtoday The other way is possible too.
@malaysiakini That makes sense then.
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ @PPBMofficial Is PPBM an alternate UMNO with all it’s characteristics?
@malaysiakini Must be a disappointed man.
@xavierjayakumar Good show YB!
@malaysiakini Is this Umno 2 in the making?
@MohdSayutiOmar @_PHSupporter Both Pas n Umno are directionless.
@malaysiakini Why use a school?
@malaymail What lesson?
@CNN @VanJones68 Hundred per cent correct!
@Jeff4Malaysia Accounts must be audited annually.
@malaymail LGBT rights must be respected.
@malaysiakini The liaison can become permanent. But is it good for Malaysia Baru?
@politico Trump 's money to save himself!
@mkula Su judges are also brainwashed!
@malaymail Independent entity but why authoritative?
@Jeff4Malaysia Some old frogs must be dealt with strictly.
@theSundaily Hope PH Government will not do such things.
@fmtoday Mother of all clashes. Good to avoid
@malaysiakini Another dangerous statement.
@malaysiakini He n Umno are far behind Malaysia Baru.
@Ambiga_S BTN has gone to that extent!
@Jeff4Malaysia Nothing unusual.
@limkitsiang They have not found their true voice yet!
@niknazmi @KEADILAN @anwaribrahim Party alignments are taking place. Bitter feuding can take place too.
@SivarasaRasiah Good move
@theborneopost Minister must visit affected area n sanction funds immediately.
@NBCNews Media personalities use this method too. Nothing unusual!
@nsurendrann @Ambiga_S U bring great honour for MalaysiaCongrats
@malaysiakini Star power  ?
@black_l4b3l @jsadiq In other words move with time.
@CNNPolitics Yes n does Trump know about it.?
@malaysiakini @KBAB51 Ada pension ma !
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak So u admit to the letter. Clever fellow!
@hannahyeoh UNCOUTH
@Ambiga_S @drwanazizah @mparitbuntar Should ‘nt be a criminal case?
@NewsBFM What religious teaching?
@Ambiga_S There should be an age limit.
@Jeff4Malaysia What is for us to expect?
@politico Signs of despotism.
@malaymail Was it a forced resignation?
@CNN There is no more humanity in the US.
@CNNPolitics Trump ‘s visit to Helsinki was a disaster.
@theborneopost PH must provide funds. All these programs must go on.
@realDonaldTrump Getting more sensible!
@chegubard Even raising funds must be done the right way. Don’t forget the sensitivity of our Malay friends!
@pseudolokun @Ambiga_S We are improving on 1 Malaysia Clinic. Change of name is appropriate. Follow up necessary n will be accepted by raayat. Good move.
@501Awani Very possible.
@fmtoday @YouTube Nothing has changed. It is still an MCA paper.
@malaysiakini Robbed? He should get a visit from u know what!
@politico Trump ‘s folly. Taxpayers have to pay.
@EricPaulsen101 This party is not the right party for our country.
@fmtoday This MP is dangerous!
@malaysiakini Extra wealth will surely draw attention.
@AmyChewCNA @chedetofficial Yes it must be freed
@malaymail N a qualified m capable man.
@fmtoday Good answer. Opposition must start learning.
@fmtoday BN should give PH another 60 years!
@malaysiakini @Khairykj They may influence but must go through the cabinet.
@malaymail Good point.
@politico Try
@politico Some GOP guys are blindly following Trump.
@malaysiakini Parents have not complained much but it is the shoe merchants.
@malaysiakini Too early to make such statements!
@NajibRazak U ran a very expensive government at taxpayers money!
@fmtoday But it is still a lot of money to have in yr personal account!
@malaymail Who will do it? Maybe the now opposition.
@malaysiakini What is wrong. PM has the right n sometimes better placed to answer such questions. U are just being divisive. The previous PM was not as forthcoming!
@malaysiakini The siblings at work
@NBCNews Only a tweet war!
@malaysiakini Will be interesting!
@theSundaily Good news. But sir please please look into parking problems at all major hospitals. Highly critical!
@tictoc @SyedSaddiq There is so much of potential in him.
@malaysiakini They will never learn. At this rate they will get self destroyed.
@Jeff4Malaysia Pas can only survive with race n religion!
@Jeff4Malaysia This party’s stature is already that of a big party like Umno. Will it show similar qualities? Wait n see!
@mpklang Our sincere condolences.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine We should expect that.
@malaysiakini Good move.
@Jeff4Malaysia A shadow cabinet would have helped Pakatan to transit a new cabinet.
@fmtoday Deputy President is the best post. Go for it.
@CNNPolitics Baring the age good choice.
@501Awani Bull....
@malaysiakini Changing colour helps the parents keep the shoes clean n neat. White shoes get dirty fast.
@Jeff4Malaysia So the old links are showing!
@msianinsight @Ambiga_S Interesting!
@syahredzan @Ambiga_S They are just alarmist!
@realDonaldTrump Why are u fighting for Google’s?
@staronline @mkula Qualified to do the job. We wish him well.
@WSJ Isn’t this interference?
@limkitsiang Are they showing their true colours?
@politico Why is Trump facilitating all this?
@politico Trump is capable of driving lots of people mad.
@hannahyeoh @eddiengtienchee Sad to note demise of rising politician.
@fmtoday This move is very appropriate n honourable.
@NajibRazak GST was good for u n the country but not for the raayat!
@malaysiakini This type of divisive talk is dangerous.
@mkini_bm Lots of backhand work!
@fmtoday A good move.
@CNN What a lie?
@fmtoday Is Umno instigating Azmin to challenge Anwar?
@khalidkarim @jsadiq Should resign n be investigated too.
@CNN Will Putin listen ?
@malaysiakini Yes it is a big big problem in port Dickson district hospital.
@politico Typical of Trump!
@realDonaldTrump It is not true!
@Jeff4Malaysia Two wrongs do make a right!
@Ambiga_S It was hilarious. Wonder how the opposition felt!
@malaysiakini What a lie?
@fmtoday Subsidies are bad. We are not a welfare state.
@shamaineothman @EricPaulsen101 Time to bring in laws for minimum age for women to get married.
@malaysiakini Very correct. Looks like Malaysia is already a victim.
@mkula Today the difference is that u are a government Minister!
@malaymail Could be a sex addict!
@fmtoday They still came back to be sworn in!
@malaysiakini IRB was used.
@fmtoday Go for Parasarana!
@Newsweek An African victory!
@501Awani Surely they have good reasons.
@malaymail A leader ma!
@NajibRazak The raayat should not have believed u totally too.
@xavierjayakumar All the best Dr. These are interesting times. Enjoy!
@fmtoday Anyone who stands a chance should be allowed to stand. No free rides please.
@fmtoday Is Pas right?
@fmtoday Is Umno right?
@KenRoth @Ambiga_S This lady is just a captive of the junta!
@fmtoday Somebody nourished n naturched them!
@malaysiakini Hope all Malaysian taxes are settled.!
@armanamin330 That is how the lanuns operate.!
@OARichardEngel Maybe he is keeping that for sentimental reason.!
@Jeff4Malaysia Doesn't protocol require him to step down.?
@sarawak_report Humans Rights should do something.
@CNN Building the course itself was frought with so much of contraversy.
@TeoNieChing We should aim for that
@limkitsiang What do u do when u are about to become irrelevant?
@malaymail Blame all except yourself. Do u know what damage u have done to the country?
@fmtoday A good decision. Cheers
@politico Trump  blames all the other guy than himself.
@SyedSaddiq Looks like this young man is going to be more productive n popular than the other Umno guy
@fmtoday Does not look like an Umno Bahru
@EricPaulsen101 Good choice even though a slight departure from manifesto.
@malaysiakini U must show that u recognise Harapan first!
@SCMPNews Everything is artificial in Singapore! When can we see the real Singapore?
@limkitsiang More still it showed fairness that never was there in there with the previous government. It was a case of Malay policy carried too far.
@EricPaulsen101 Like that little Umnos were in existence in all aspects of the government Departments. !
@fmtoday Jho Lo has broken many laws. The question is can we get him?
@khalidkarim @jsadiq Which means that the then PM n the MOF were not telling the truth!
@malaymail Commitment alone is not enough. Leaders like u n the others should show that u have changed. Not a bunch of lanuns!
@DrDzul We must always be thankful to the blood donors.!
@LatheefaKoya @EricPaulsen101 Sounds funny
@zachsiow @hannahyeoh Famous or notorious?
@malaysiakini Your right!
@HuffPost A crude guy
@nsurendrann A true n true Umno man
@NajibRazak Who else was the cause?
@partisosialis Will be good.
@n_izzah Come back soon. Fit n Cured.
@politico So  there was Russian interference?
@malaysiakini Great
@EricPaulsen101 It should be a re probe.
@malaysiakini So Apandi Ali has been a thoroughbred Umno man all this while!
@BBCNews The golf course is shourded in controversy!
@501Awani Bro he wanted to feel younger!
@malaysiakini Well done Gobind. We must move with time.
@malaysiakini A fugitive already.
@limkitsiang It looks like Najib is creating a coalition around him n using religion n race .This a dangerous trend n can turn explosive.Umno should not fall for this.
@fmtoday Soon they will find it difficult to maintain them .
@SCMPNews Why the hurried meeting?
@HuffPost Maybe another questionable dude.
@CNNPolitics Self praise is no praise!
@mitchellreports Bad manners!
@fmtoday Appears innocent. Must be investigated.
@HuffPost Trump must know that the opposite of self proclaimed genius is damn fool!
@HuffPost Trump should not have gone.
@sitikasim @jsadiq Very well said. Pakatan is saving the country.
@politico He is only good for the media!
@HuffPost UK was not ready to receive Trump.
@CNN We want a kinder America!
@CNNPolitics Trump 's way of creating havoc in the country.!
@rajaretorik @xrockybrux Betul ka?
@louisliaw That is Malaysia BAHARU.!
@fmtoday Should fine them.
@Sir_Azri @xrockybrux Interesting!
@politico How low can u go?
@fmtoday Good but don't make it racist!
@malaymail At the rate they are going they will collapse by the next election.
@fmtoday Umno does not want to change!
@CNNPolitics Trump won't like that
@501Awani Wishing u a speedy recovery.
@_PHSupporter Where is Rais Yatim now?
@NajibRazak GST was good for u n BN. PH does not want a tax that burdens raayat.
@Newsweek Trump has abandoned old NATO Allies for new friend Putin.
@fmtoday Training as responsible opposition party.
@malaysiakini Why should u?
@malaymail Another racial comment.
@malaysiakini Who will?
@fmtoday What do u expect from a outdated n decadent party.?
@malaymail Tun first n now Tun Siti. Happy happy birthday.
@fmtoday Hope Tommy is  not taken just for Najib's case.
@hannahyeoh What a difference to the cost!
@matthewfsmith @EricPaulsen101 @FortifyRights @SuthareeW The footballers must be given their citizenship papers.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Good move Fadiah!
@ABCPolitics Trump should not destroy the aliens n friendship with NATO.
@TerenceFnandez This clarification on Johari Abdul is most welcome.
@fmtoday Sounds fair
@sarawak_report That is correct. The whole force needs a relook. Their outlook demeanour their approach to public  must change. We want a people friendly Bobby. Be soft but firm n a force the raayat must be proud. Cheers
@Newsweek That shows that they need help.
@aliranmalaysia Lim Kit Siang will make a good Speaker.!
@CNNPolitics Our Health Minister should also call up all the pharmaceutical companies too n do the same thing.
@AnasZubedy @saifuddinabd Except for age there should not be any difference between 25 n 40.
@HuffPost Can he still work?
@malaysiakini There should be a choice.
@malaysiakini Cost function n role must be relooked n rationalised.
@mkula Witch means no more BN!
@fmtoday PH does not have any economic policies as yet.
@Ambiga_S @chedetofficial I agree.
@Ambiga_S Harapan should not be https://t.co/o3DAzLb38y a retired judge as a Speaker n need not be an MP.
@MatUMNO @SyedSaddiq In fact all Ministers should follow.!
@YangheeLeeSKKU @EricPaulsen101 International pressure must be put on Myanmar.
@malaymail Careers diplomats should be happy.
@malaymail I think Malaysians trust Harapan more than the previous regime. They should not be instigated.
@fmtoday Law of an outdated decadent country. '
@nsurendrann A G is out to get u charged  n to prove u guilty anyway.
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 They are also God's children. Why the hatred n animosity? They need love n care.
@saifuddinabd Tun M was active in the international arena. He set n made foreign policy. Wismaputra n it's Minister facilitated our country 'a foreign relations including an active role in the UN.
@malaymail That is good news.
@EricPaulsen101 Sad
@fmtoday Bonanza for some lawyers!
@501Awani What about settling the 1MDB debts?
@DrAliHamsa Hope u get better soon. U are valuable to Pakatan.
@malaymail Maybe taking a chance!
@fmtoday Competition is good for the passengers.!
@malaysiakini Listen to the housewives. Not yr officers only. This is what they told the previous administration. They are still the same officers!
@fmtoday There are plenty of unemployed blind dedicated supporters of Pakatan. Are they been looked after?
@malaysiakini Good show!
@fmtoday We are only afraid that the father will need more money!
@malaymail Umnoism !
@malaysiakini Copycats! But don't go for Talibanism!
@malaysiakini Have them supervise them provide funds n must be strict in their running.
@fmtoday That's it Tun
@JoeNBC That exactly what has happened!
@fmtoday Scoring brownie points ah!
@NajibRazak Sad!
@amirfareedrahim @jsadiq @suriani2507 There must be a reason.!
@malaysiakini Exactly!
@malaysiakini Good suggestion. I agree with him.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Ask God why god created LGBT.
@FoxNews @POTUS @SenWarren Presidential interference in people's heritage. Mr Trump how low can u go?
@fmtoday A plus for PKR.
@malaymail That is a good move n decision.
@pseudolokun @jsadiq Sounds funny. Blind loyalty or sheer foolishness?
@SCMPNews Brazil is not final material!
@malaymail Amanah is a good party. Their choice of Deputy/ Ministers shows that raayat will appreciate n benefit.
@theSundaily That is the normal way.!
@malaysiakini @kinitv If u are loved by the party why not?
@malaymail Zeti or Najib? Maybe time will tell!
@malaymail Protocol deems that they leave their political posts. In the US more then 20  Ambassadors were called back when Trump  took over from Obama.
@hrw @EricPaulsen101 LGBT are god's children
@bobbyshriver Peace corps was a good thing.
@azrain_adnan @saifuddinabd @syedhamidalbar Understand two Ambassadors do not want to leave their posts. Protocol deems tha they leave.
@malaysiakini Exactly that!
@malaymail Maybe a fugitive?
@Jeff4Malaysia The ex judge will make a good speaker.
@NBCNews @CNBC Trump is a disrupter.
@NewsBFM He has a rich party backing him.!
@malaymail Is there a donar?
@fmtoday Backed by whom?
@malaysiakini If we have a extradition treaty with India we must honour that.
@Ambiga_S He just wants a sleeping partner.!
@fmtoday A gag order . Why? Tell that to the foreign press !
@NBCNews Trump has the answer!
@malaysiakini Sounds funny. The lawyers are going to have good time.!
@malaysiakini Huntong la!
@malaysiakini But at least u would have learned about it.!
@malaymail Words of wisdom from a ex Umno!
@NewsBFM The most important reason by the whole raayat n Tun M was the 1 mdb fiasco.
@NewsBFM Why
@_PHSupporter Competition: tabong Harapan vs Tabong Najib ???
@malaysiakini Not to those who have not used BM often!
@DrJasonLeong @Ambiga_S I will not donate because I feel he can afford to pay the bail himself.
@malaysiakini It is a unfair move!
@CNNPolitics What has heritage got to do with the person?
@syahredzan An example of Umno standard.
@matrade @MITIMalaysia @DarellLeiking @imokman @IshamIshak2 @Shahree24473230 Good move
@Jeff4Malaysia I hope Gobind will something.
@tavleen_singh Is India becoming too insular?
@malaysiakini World Bank has said it. We are paying too much!
@malaysiakini Only now not during the previous regime!
@fmtoday Why should the press be gagged? Foreign press will somehow continue to  beat this gag. It is not a good move.
@Ambiga_S Pas thinking n ideas are way out of the normal. It is hardly a relevant party for Malaysians!
@jsadiq She is assuming that the whole country is crying for them!
@501Awani Is it like OSA. Can't say anything because of Official Secrets Act.!
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak Sad he does not have enough money.!
@fmtoday Trying to use language as an issue is wrong.
@fmtoday Should have done long ago.
@nsurendrann They survive only on such issues.
@jsadiq He is an ex PM only
@CNN Trump seem to be keeping some grudge against Obama
@malaysiakini Must go.
@malaymail He was Umno supporter.!
@kusanvinvin @saifuddinabd Congratulations  Dato. U are the right man for Wismaputra. !
@malaysiakini Warlordism n money politics!
@fmtoday Some statements are made to deliberately anger a particular race. This is dangerous.
@malaymail What ?
@TerenceFnandez That is a typical UMNO characteristic!
@malaysiakini What failures ?
@CNNPolitics ICE must be abolished.
@malaymail I thought so.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Will Umno change?
@malaysiakini So UMNO will not change
@theSundaily So it is still the old Umno. !
@malaysiakini It will be in order to investigate this guy.
@msianinsight Excellent. U see the corruption rate come down like a jiffy
@EricPaulsen101 Very good move
@mkini_bm @NgaKorMing It is so apparent. It is so entrenched. Umno can't survive without money.
@Jeff4Malaysia All parties must be reasonable!
@theSundaily It should be the Government 's priority too.
@fmtoday Bahasa Malaysia is the accepted official language on the country. English n other languages can be encouraged n used. Nobody should react the otherwise. In the long run it will be good for the country.
@fmtoday It is clear from the results that UMNO will not change. The party must move with time. U don't n the consequences will show soon. More will leave the party. Some senior ones are already leaving symbolic of their disappointment with the party.
@fmtoday Signs of remarks pertaining to one race.!
@malaymail It is not the money. People dinn't want BN any more.
@malaymail Aren't I the cause of BN defeat ?
@MeowPhone He does not know his own lies!
@NajibRazak U are the link!
@fmtoday Who is talking about democracy?
@fmtoday This is quite normal. Most political appointees have to resign first.
@malaysiakini No no no. I beg to differ. Over the years Umno has also grown arrogant. Ask others n they will say so too.
@EricPaulsen101 Isn't it a criminal offence?
@SistersinIslam @hannahyeoh @drwanazizah Just fix the minimum age n get it passed by Parliament..
@fmtoday @YouTube Now Annuar is saying a lot of things !!!
@malaymail Now what has our no 1 lanun got to say to this ?
@MalaysiaGazette That is good .If it is not hers than the Government can sell them.
@mkula I like the head gear !!!
@malaysiakini No point telling that now.
@sarawak_report Why give him a bonus? His performance was only mouthful of lies.
@malaysiakini After u have become a toothless tiger. Sad
@_PHSupporter Another lanun of the same kind. Hope his accounts are frozen.
@SenateMajLdr The Republicans also did that.
@malaysiakini How soon?
@Jeff4Malaysia Great men. !! Sometimes their silence is golden...
@fmtoday Lompat ? ?? No party will want u !!!
@hmetromy A good move!
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak Indirectly saying that he wants the gifts back !
@limkitsiang Great idea. A Cleansing session !!!
@msianinsight Good . The whole country must follow
@malaymail We will become the biggest in the world. Noble prize for Malaysia!
@theSundaily A summit when he has alienated old allies like Canada n E U .
@malaymail U should have said like this long ago. Now it will  affect yr chances of winning.
@NgaKorMing @PDRMsia @dapmalaysia Convert to cash n pay 1Mdb debts.
@CNN Trump must not have a free hand too. Democrats are necessary as opposition.
@malaymail Good idea n must be followed. Be different from previous regime.
@fmtoday N a few others too.
@Newsweek Hope it is not yr turn next!
@mparitbuntar Anything but no extravaganzas with raayat 's money.
@Jeff4Malaysia New horizon new reality n new world n the man is acting that nothing has happened .
@fmtoday People in opposition states are also raayat Malaysia.
@theSundaily Go for Ku Li. Umno needs to be saved.
@imokman @NajibRazak Umno is a rich party n the members must be rich too.
@NgaKorMing The couple have brought such fame no such notoriety to our country. Noble price lah.
@theborneopost Party Peribumi should not become another Umno in Sarawak.
@beritartm @RTM_Malaysia Good show Gobind. Try n make Penerangan more professional. No alliance or working for political parties. Penerangan was another outfit of BN. Ta Boleh la.
@fmtoday Good for Sabah n good for all n Umno in particular. Umno should only be in Peninsular.
@malaymail Khairy n the old group must go. They are tainted with 1MDB. Tengku Li will be the right choice.
@malaymail But Umno must not be used for such purposes any more !
@malaymail It is up to Pakatan to prove him wrong.
@malaysiakini U are new so go through the mill.
@Jeff4Malaysia What about the other three audit companies ?
@fmtoday The fund was abused. Think of other ways of running the programmes.
@NewsBFM This is how I felt throughout.
@ABCPolitics As the money comes build the wall. Don't blackmail Congress.
@drmusanordin Very well put !
@fmtoday Is that all? Umno will disintegrate once the funds dry up.
@fmtoday Singapore should not make a threat. Any treaty can be renegotiated if it is found to be unfair to one party.
@fmtoday Can be made right
@malaysiakini PH waited 60 years why can't u?
@chedetofficial Waiting for theProton SUV!
@realDonaldTrump U are exgerating . U don't call that an invasion.
@theSundaily Federer u are in twilight times !
@ivyjosiah @sitikasim Great unity
@fmtoday Will the warlords support T Li?
@The_Endie War lords are there. Expect no changes. They will be at it like their leaders.
@fmtoday Good move. Hope other PH states do the same
@malaymail Like buying a lot of cows n putting them condos
@HuffPost Trump can answer that
@nsurendrann The Home Affaires Minister will be able to clear these things. Police action looks like the police of the previous government!
@nsurendrann Does not look right. Is it the work of Jais ?
@theSundaily So why the police action?
@nsurendrann @EricPaulsen101 Home Minister is also at https://t.co/CMJnqVF5Lv act fast. We are different from BN.
@politico I see the anger people have against Trump.
https://t.co/6Wl76CFGMO
@malaymail Does it matter?
@MelGohCNA @saifuddinabd What about MIC ?
@msianinsight @nsurendrann Giving an extension is already wrong.
@fmtoday Good move! What opposition?
@fmtoday Most grandmothers do that.!
@EricPaulsen101 Definitely the NFC case. The raayat money must be settled.
@malaymail I thought it was the feedlot case
@malaymail Maybe she needs to spend more time at the courts
@theborneopost Put more walk in shuttle flights from KL to S'pore
@fmtoday Tell that to MACC
@fmtoday No bosses should be removed without good reasons.
@fmtoday Yes n corruption also
@NgaKorMing Good sayings
@CNN Let's have them.
@malaymail Maybe something else later on.
@malaysiakini What openness? Maybe only now.  ! Let's see for how long.
@roketkini @NgaKorMing It is not the Minister . It is the Umno -BN government that was involved.
@The_Mole But sad part is people do not trust u anymore
@mkula Should have done long ago.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Good choice
@CNN Exactly. Nationalism used against immigrants.
@EricPaulsen101 Sad !
@malaysiakini Umno Kia su mentality
@malaymail Good move. There won't be any more abuse.
@malaymail Good idea m also make automatic voting for 18 plus.
@malaysiakini Why?
@politico Nikki u are helping Trump to make US a rogue country. Shame
@fmtoday He is a good guy. But he was used by Jibby. Now he must pay a price.!
@malaymail Tell it to the courts. See if the judges accept your story.
@fmtoday Coming from this guy's mouth? Ha ha
@mkula All bull
@EricPaulsen101 Maybe only the US lawyers believe his stories !
@ABCPolitics No parents want to separated from their children.
@jayjaydenis @EricPaulsen101 @NajibRazak @Reuters Sounds like a lot of bull!
@malaysiakini U knew that throughout. Yr signatures were there. Why the obstruction? Let the courts decide anyway.
@SCMP_News Is US a rogue country?
@hannahyeoh No change. Same  person. Same answer.
@aliranmalaysia Like the money gifted by the Arab!
@Newsweek Is US a rogue state?
@BebasAnwar @anwaribrahim Old friends?
@malaysiakini That's good news
@malaysiakini Another frog?
@The_Mole A very caring ex PM !
@malaymail Shows the fear people have of working with Pas
@tianchua Our condolences.
@malaysiakini Pl do it soon. It is also taxpayers money.
@ForeignPolicy @EricPaulsen101 It's people 's victory.
@theSundaily Must go through it!
@malaysiakini There are possibilities of abuse.
@niknazmi @GobindSinghDeo @bbcquestiontime RTM is a premier news channel n not a premier cnannel for news on accidents n funerals. Surely u can start with better n more important news.
@HuffPost Good way of promoting local tourism.
@tapaimalaya @SyedSaddiq Good move. Your ideas are revolutionary n exhilarating!
@CNNPolitics Has Trump a heart?
@maverick_97 @Khairykj They can also elect a 80 plus.!
@HareshDeol @saifuddinabd @FIFAWorldCup We Malaysians need their grit n determination!
@malaysiakini Interesting!
@fmtoday It has to stop
@EricPaulsen101 Let's improve our standard first
@CNNPolitics U are more dumb!
@malaymail Is he pretending that nothing has happened?
@politico What language?
@malaysiakini @kinitv Getting a taste of your medicine!
@politico U are not a dictator. OR u want to be one?
@malaymail Good idea
@XHNews Cruel n inhumane
@malaysiakini Good for Umno. Can he change Umno or will it be the same? Arrogance corrupt n no more service oriented. Will it go riggit  religious outlook like Pas? Lots of questions for Ku Li. All the best.
@NBCNews This guy has become a puppet of Trump.
@fmtoday Disallow such adverts
@malaysiakini The whole commission must be disbanded. Start afresh while giving them independence there should be lots of safeguards. Make them unsewerable to Parliament.
@saladinMY @Jeff4Malaysia A complete relook at our trade n bilateral relations is nessary with China. Some countries are already experiencing this n we should be careful. Some things the previous government has done is not right at all.
@politico It can be the season of the seventies!
@malaymail Forgive yes. Forget if u gift me one of your watches!
@HuffPost U too can become a dictator sir!
@CNN @CillizzaCNN A confused President!
@5YAHlR Must be investigated n stopped.
@NgaKorMing @roketkini @bernamadotcom @SinarOnline @pakatanharapan_ Yes YB. Make sure no frogs n no frauds.
@msianinsight I think they should.
@fmtoday @YouTube Must be Singapore Kia su mentality.!
@NBCNews Are u leaving?
@fmtoday DBKL needs a revamp too.
@malaysiakini Hope u are relishing that.
@NajibRazak Your other constituents will miss your patronage. Sad
@Ambiga_S A saviour in Tun M. Dawn of a new era. Enjoy Malaysia BAHARU.
@Newsweek He does not appear to be a sinsere person.!
@malaymail Lots of files may have disappeared.!
@fmtoday Umno must change. Will it?
@malaymail Is that so. Must investigate.
@malaymail Sounds a better idea.Worth giving some attention.
@hannahyeoh @NajibRazak It looks like showmanship. Or is he pretending?
@EricPaulsen101 This whole affair is shrouded in mystery n falsehood. Are we taking a frog n a fraud. It brings bad name to PH.
@malaysiakini Probably Dr Idris Ahmad?
@NgaKorMing I like that saying.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Want to go. But I won't.
@malaymail Looks like the guy is in a denial syndrome.
@fmtoday That is news!
@malaymail @hannahyeoh The raayat who voted PH have every right to scrutinise because they must be worried of things going wrong n because of the previous government 's mistakes. But watch out. They can vote u out in the next election.
@politico From a Rocket man your words are full of praise n opposite.
@fmtoday Good question!
@jasonleong What is MIC waiting for not that it will make any difference!
@malaysiakini It should be the other way round.!
@malaysiakini We don't have an opposition voice yet. But u are performing extremely well as an opposition young man. Keep it up.
@theborneopost Good suggestion
@Jeff4Malaysia TNB a monopoly GLC must be pulled up. Hope it is not a sabotage!
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 The changes must set in now
@malaymail You have been extra generous to them n more still the political appointees. Why?  Were u buying loyalty n later their votes?
@malaymail Won't be long. Umno is making more enemies now than before. It is speeding up its demise faster now.
@limkitsiang Utusan must face the law.
@SCMP_News Early days
@fmtoday Police chiefs should strive to have a raayat friendly force.
@theSundaily This is a body that needs a lot of change. Maybe we should breakup Puspakorn. There should be competition. People must have choices. More such bodies in all towns.
@fmtoday It is a terrible accusation!
@malaysiakini @kinitv Leave first n then decide
@hannahyeoh We must have a people friendly police force.
@limkitsiang But race n religion should not be used to further an individual's personal interest.
@LiewChinTong U deserve to win
@theborneopost Good show
@PeteTeo @saifuddinabd Najib' deal with China looks lob sided n strange. Are the Chinese being fair?
@akmalsuyat Zamora should b watched
@msianinsight @SyedSaddiq The former PM was reckless with taxpayers money.
@washingtonpost @Jeff4Malaysia Very lucrative side business though the White House Possible only under Trump.
@HuffPost The Rocket Man meets the Twitter man!
@theSundaily Maybe dabbled in it.!
@malaymail Great
@fmtoday Then u must be innocent!
@fmtoday We expected that. The lanuns have been busy!
@malaymail Tun just made a suggestion
@Newsweek Trump is excited
@theborneopost Another bull story from the ex PM.
@msianinsight @xrockybrux Are u defending him?
@EricPaulsen101 Look at Merkel lecturing Trump.!
@NajibRazak Wait still the truth comes out.
@BBCWorld What language
@malaysiakini A welfare state ah?
@saifulka @DrDzul Come home. U won't be disappointed.
@malaysiakini Pharmacy companies are having a good time.!
@RiccoKl That's how Umno leaders keep their money!
@malaymail Why are they still asking about Tun's ancestry?
@Newsweek I don't see the connection
@ShahrilHamdan @Khairykj We should think of reviving MRT 3 . We have too many car models. Reduce tax n make them available to raayat. Maybe no need for another national car.
@Jeff4Malaysia @plaza Betul betul
@fmtoday Must be money then.
@malaymail Don't be popular at the expense of raayat 's money!
@malaysiakini Good show Mr Minister. Please pay some attention to pensioners n old folks. Maybe some added attention  like less trips n more medical stocks. Tks
@fmtoday ICPMC must be introduced. Let us have a corrupt free n a People friendly police force. Raayat must not fear the police. Instead they must not have negative feelings of the police force. Let us have a raayat friendly police.
@fmtoday All Ministers must do the same. Pakatan must be as transparent as possible.
@Jeff4Malaysia Haj trips must be earned respectfully.
@malaymail We must adopt the Japanese work culture.
@aliranmalaysia I am happy to see my one time colleague Suboh come back.
@hannahyeoh @chedetofficial Ku Li n Umno like opulence n comfort. They will remain like that for a long time.
@Newsweek The VP talks nonsense sometimes.
@fmtoday Not until it changes OR it will be made to change.
@lawyers4liberty @NgaKorMing @sarawak_report Another Najib scam!
@malaysiakini @kinitv U give the Royal touch n call yourself Umnoputras. See what the raayat will say after that.
@nsurendrann Ask the members. N change with time.
@Newsweek He is getting a lecture
@NST_Online @SyedSaddiq No politicians in GLCs
@malaysiakini Yr comments nowadays are worth zero.
@fmtoday Malaysia BAHARU ma
@theborneopost Rigid law yes. But appears as a regimented scocity!
@fmtoday Don't follow BN. Pakatan must be different.
@rajaretorik @xrockybrux Sounds funny. Don't do things to angkat bodeh!
@malaymail A divisive article. Should be ignored.
@titbiz @Ambiga_S A true Malaysian
@malaymail All the best. Another good member for Dap
@Newsweek Guilliani is becoming a loose mouth.
@McFaul Another instance of his favouring Russia.
@malaysiakini @EricPaulsen101 That's a big figure. Home minister must act fast
@malaysiakini Very well said
@NewsBFM Cost is the matter now
@NgaKorMing @malaysiakini @chedetofficial @drwanazizah @roketkini @msianinsight Great contribution
@limkitsiang They should resign.
@mkula Human Resources Fund has full of holes. Need changes
@Jeff4Malaysia @staronline That is the right word. Spun out of control
@malaymail Good idea
@niknazmi @hannahyeoh Promotion ah.?
@malaysiakini Hope u win Dr.!
@HuffPost Was Trump being selective?
@malaysiakini Are raids necessary?
@TeoNieChing It is a good suggestion
@malaysiakini @kinitv Why?
@EricPaulsen101 @eaicofficial @SUHAKAM Pakatan should show it is different.
@FutballTweets Great words Messi.
@malaymail The best is give more powers to  MACC or directly answerable to Parliament. See the changes after that. That is what happened to Hong Kong.
@limkitsiang I don't think these guys will ever change.
@Jeff4Malaysia Good question. Some hanky panky there too.
@malaymail We all should work for a corruption free administration.Absolutely essential. Not forgetting GLC
@EricPaulsen101 @DrDzul Isn't it the responsibility of the Home Ministry?
@malaymail A shake up in Astro is overdue.
@yongsooheong The proficiency ended with yr time Tun.
@malaysiakini So there was infighting?
@malaymail I should tell the previous government. An agreement to benefit certain people?
@mkula It is a good decision. Good for Sarawak!
@__earth Another cash is king story
@NgaKorMing @roketkini @malaysiakini @guanenglim @dapperak Excellent. Hope the others follow.
@Newsweek The highlight: Trump pardons himself n that will mean impeachment.
@syahredzan What book? U never followed the book on anything.
@EricPaulsen101 US is blinded by its support of Israel. Soon it will loose its allies.
@Jeff4Malaysia They should have gone long ago.
@hannahyeoh Malaysia Bahru means Ketuanan Malaysia.
@Newsweek Your credibility is as low as the president!
@malaysiakini Everything done by the book?
@fmtoday Howcome only 13 per cent jobs completed but 88 per cent payment made?
@NewsBFM See who made the payments n charge them.
@zaifulibrahim It is Ketuanan Malaysia.
@fmtoday Does she still want to stand?
@TerenceFnandez Isn't it great!
@nsurendrann He made it hot.
@Jeff4Malaysia This paper has not changed at all. !!!
@FoxNews Only disruptions
@jayjaydenis @NajibRazak It is over. T Thomas is confirmed new AG
@malaysiakini Please keep Tun M fit n strong.
@msianinsight KJ is the best.
@malaysiakini Do u need so much? N where did u get that much?
@malaysiakini Why?
@macfaisal I thought football fans contributed to funding the thirty million.For transparency sake please reveal the names of the sponsors.
@malaysiakini All Pas top brass need polishing.
@aliranmalaysia Use the video evidence to take action against civil servants who campaigned for BN
@faizalhamssin @EricPaulsen101 Sensitivity can be preserved in many other ways
@Jeff4Malaysia Now it seems clear the money was used to pay 1 MDB loan
@fmtoday Kemas Dari PD campaign untok BN. Pegawai pegawai Dari jabatan penerangan PD juga campaign untok BN
@aafaizli @Ambiga_S @chedetofficial Good idea
@malaysiakini Kemas in PD campaign for BN!
@staronline It will be relief for the children n parents
@malaysiakini Malaysia 's football fans are great. Thanks for the sponsorship.
@theSundaily Not after files have been hidden!
@malaymail It is not AG or Pas. All Muslims in Malaysia will defend Islam.
@mkula That's the idea. Don't have to follow BN
@theSundaily Be watchful. Do not allow that to happen.
@DrRaisYatim @EricPaulsen101 Well said. Is there a silent hand behind all this?
@TKThiagarajah @chedetofficial T Thomas will be AG for a short period. Only to clear n organise things. Moreover he is Pakatan choice.?
@NajibRazak Did u apply these advise to yourself?
@mkini_bm @chedetofficial @MukhrizMahathir No buddy buddy contracts.
@fmtoday Yes. It should be Ketuanan Malaysia
@EricPaulsen101 Is he pretending that nothing has happened to our country
@malaysiakini Is there an MCA?
@NgaKorMing @guanenglim @chedetofficial @malaysiakini @dapmalaysia @roketkini @dapperak Great
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 Stateless children need proper papers. PH should help. Be humane.
@PRSupporter The fails will give a lot of exposures
@malaysiakini The more the merrier. No money politics please.
@KerrySin @weekasiongmp Their eyes were closed their ears were shut. They were only his master 's voice.
@malaymail Alone or jointly learn to be a good opposition party.
@fmtoday The scandal free n the committed ones .
@malaysiakini It is still taxpayers money
@malaymail But not a party mouthpiece!
@limkitsiang He is expecting a big payoff cheque!
@501Awani Absolutely
@malaysiakini Should be rejected.
@malaymail If they were supporters of previous government they must be put under cold storage.!
@malaysiakini Yes when we have the funds.
@IbrahimRamli @Ambiga_S Taxpayers money. Should be transparent.
@politico He is an obstructionist!
@malaymail Too costly. Developer has lost his oomph.
@fmtoday Tahfiz schools must be strictly supervised.
@mkula Very good suggestions. Hope Pakatan can follow.
@WSJ Trump is a master in deflecting news
@politico Twitter king n his pack of lies.
@malaymail This is the type of things Jakim can look into ...
@fmtoday But exploit the country...
@EricPaulsen101 It cared for themselves only.
@PRSupporter Interesting!
@malaysiakini Hundreds of them I presume!
@xrockybrux Is it so easy as that? The previous government was full of lies.
@malaymail Good
@malaymail Good
@theSundaily U may make a lot of members happy
@malaysiakini So the divisions got big dedak from Umno. How are they going to survive now?
@hannahyeoh What about plundering the country Mr ex PM?
@malaymail The hole will be filled up soon!
@malaysiakini Taib must be investigated
@Jeff4Malaysia Must be investigated n exposed. Big fat salary must be discontinued.
@politico Just a mouthpiece of Trump!
@jayjaydenis Football fans must start a fund to offset RTM's cost of 40 million ringgit.
@fmtoday Looks like BN has started its opposition role
@malaymail That is an exhorbiten sum
@malaysiakini Akan datang story
@malaymail There are many more party appointees like him. They all should resign.
@limkitsiang On principle all should step down.
@teresakok Work together for the benefit of the residents of Federal Territory KL
@limkitsiang They were picked by previous government. Based on principle they should resign.
@malaysiakini Good show
@teresakok Didn't he know that this was coming. I pity Umno members.
@GeoffRBennett Factually wrong.!
@malaysiakini Have seen what RTM 'a headline news. Ok I will tell u. Accidents n https://t.co/iIHnN0Mlrw is not a obituary channel!!It is a premiere TV station . We want Premier news. Get better journalists n staff. We can do it.
@fmtoday Good for the airlines. Hope their charges can come down. Make it affordable for the middle class too.
@CNNPolitics Is he afraid of Mueller?
@fmtoday Suspend license until he follows law
@malaymail Do we have to quarrel about this?
@malaysiakini Fake news
@fmtoday Why adversely?
@CNN God's creation!
@PeteTeo Very well put.
@fmtoday I can forsee endless problems. Unless Pribumi wants to replace Umno.
@malaysiakini Why easy way out?
@SyedSaddiq Pas is not the right party for a multi racial Malaysia.
@malaysiakini They will make good opposition leaders !!!
@fmtoday But can still take a percentage of other races!!!
@malaysiakini He is not facing the new reality.
@limkitsiang It is good that he does not make any comments.
@fmtoday Pas is an evil party
@fmtoday Why not? MalAysia Bahru ma!
@fmtoday Very good suggestion. GLCs should be be refelective of Malaysia. Not the sole property of one race.
@mkula U are an leader now. Indian expectations are high. A lot of focus on u. Yr ministry is equally important. So there is so much to do. First thing is to get 10 per cent of them to work in government n GLCs
@malaysiakini Don't allow people to take the law in their own hands.
@jimiecheng @SyedSaddiq Pas is a joke
@501Awani Including 1Mdb debts?
@politico Is Trump obstructing?
@PRSupporter PDRM should be raayat friendly
@fmtoday I think they should
@theSundaily Hope other States follow.
@malaymail RTM should be raayat oriented. Not a government propagandist. U will lose your viewers in no time.
@malaymail Pl don't follow Umno / BN
@malaysiakini The dream of a mullah
@501Awani There is so much exposure on 1Mdb. We have inherited big debts. Wonder what Hadi has to say now!
@CNNPolitics The probe is on Russian interference. Why is Trump so concerned? Was he involved?
@fmtoday Yes yes yes
@malaysiakini Very honourable?
@malaymail We all should support this wholeheartedly. He saved our country.
@malaysiakini Good idea
@malaymail The cow lady must still face the music
@malaysiakini The signs were there already there. Your research n intelligence sources were either sleeping or not seeing the writings on the wall.
@theborneopost That's a good role for the opposition.
@imperialcollege @Ambiga_S @DrDzul Please make haemodilaysis at a standard affordable cost.
@HillaryClinton It will make a good read
@realDonaldTrump Is this real? OR a way to deviate from the Russian probe?
@EricPaulsen101 KJ is solely needed in Umno which is still relevant
@malaymail Great
@guanenglim @chedetofficial Good show
@limkitsiang That is absolutely essential. No excesses no deviantions no abuse etc etc. Raayat is watching like a hawk.
@fmtoday So he can be charged for perjury. Wonder what that entails?
@malaysiakini Political appointees including some Ambassadors must go. That is usual norm.
@limkitsiang I wonder how much cash if the authorities raid the offices of MCA MIC n Gerakan.
@fmtoday We all celebrate. But we should not get disappointed.
@malaysiakini The leaders must undergo such a thing. Then get the members mindset changed. Then Umno becomes relevant.
@malaysiakini A lot of agencies were created for Umno use from taxpayers money. They must go.
@izqaxque Umno President has set new standards.
@theborneopost Government media must change their mindset n must be raayat oriented. News must be informative neutral n all encompassing. Not pro Government only.
@PRSupporter Too much in one plate !!!
@malaysiakini TI must answer that.
@jsadiq Most lanuns are afraid or don't need the banking system.
@Newsweek Unethical n inhumane n Unamerican..Why?
@NAR Removing GST is regressive. Hope the alternatives work. Our economy must be energised for a better future. Can we?
@FoxNews This call must go on.
@jsadiq Do PM s keep so much money in their homes?
@NST_Online @chedetofficial Tun M is part of the Reformasi. The raayat is hungry for meaningful change.
@SenateMajLdr Only in the eyes of Trump n the Republicans.
@fmtoday Maybe a complete state by election will be in order.
@malaysiakini Misleading. Let the taxpayers say that. Hope Pakatan come out with the exact commitments in terms of dollars n cents.
@EricPaulsen101 Good decision. Must be implemented.
@mkula Missing in action. We must have more such leaders.
@limkitsiang All the lanuns want a share.
@hannahyeoh Good beginning
@malaysiakini We're u paid to tell lies?
@malaymail But u were still defending them.
@NBCNews Don't be a war mongerer
@malaysiakini Maybe he has answers to our hidden one trillion debts.
@malaysiakini That is if they want development for these two states.
@EricPaulsen101 She must be having the right answers I am sure.
@hmetromy Must be Umno linked companies
@malaymail What about the one trillion debt?
@apaccioe All this while we were listening to the lies of these people .The big guy is still lying
@malaysiakini The move to give also to the opposition their allocation is the right thing. All voters are the same. Hope Parliament n the other states do the same thing.
@malaymail They created Avock
@fmtoday They can be redeployed Pakatan is not a cruel party.
@malaysiakini Like US good to keep religion out of school We learned that way.
@malaysiakini What about BTN?
@limkitsiang Hadi will do so soon
@fmtoday Tks. Together u contributed to Pakatan 's victory.
@NBCNews There are already signs of obstruction.
@FoxNews @NRA @DLoesch @foxandfriends Then u can sell more guns
@malaymail Dedak still speaking.
@NAR Can't u see the changes are taking place
@mkula Congrats Kula. U are heading a people oriented ministry. Definitely a lot of hanky panky is going on .i.e maids n foreign problems. I am sure u can put them right in the next 100 days.
@fmtoday Do u expect him to continue?
@fmtoday That's it. Don't make slanted stories. Don't be a party paper. Choose one.
@malaysiakini Comments from the sidelines
@malaymail He is a dedicated BN man
@theborneopost This needs to be looked into
@malaymail Great
@fmtoday If I don't abolish Spad bring it directly under the Minister of transport
@imShahidah EC should be rewamed
@Ambiga_S Kula ,I like your headgear
@malaysiakini So MCA has started doing its opposition work.ha ha ha
@malaysiakini PKR did badly in Trengganu n Kelantan. We must start now to beat Pas n get back the two states. U can do it. Rafizi. Hope DSAI supports u.
@malaysiakini What about u .?Remember no free rides.
@mkula Pl solve the maid problem esp from Indonesia.
@theSundaily Be transparent n let the raayat be informed.
@NewsBFM U will always be protected now n forever.
@malaysiakini Government servants must now change their mindset . Work for PH.
@malaysiakini A gentleman doctor....
@malaysiakini So u could have kept power if u wanted to.
@_mohammadaidil_ Sympathy alone cannot save the man.
@politico U will still do nothing .U are too beholden to NRA.
@fmtoday Good for tourism industry.
@malaysiakini He is still in his fantasy world.
@NBCNews Zil
@Newsweek Double standards
@FoxNews @astros Trump is too pro NRA. He is shackled.
@malaysiakini But yr thoughts n ideas n input are important.
@fmtoday We prefer a moderate Islam ala Tun M / Anwar style. Blunt the extremism advocated by Pas. If possible just have an Islamic head of Department under the PM. No need for a Minister. Just an idea. No offence made.
@fmtoday Revisit the case. Raayat wants that.
@limkitsiang There must be more.
RT @fmtoday: MACC to interview Najib at home on Tuesday https://t.co/qaVz95hDAR
@robertcslim @maszlee @501Awani @LiewChinTong There is still a move to get Tun M to do the job. Maybe he should set the tone n initially make the changes
@fmtoday YB Idris Ahmad should be considered
@fmtoday First get rid of the war lords
@fmtoday Another client for MACC
@GobindSinghDeo The telcos are no angels. U must review all of them. The charges are still high. Phone calls to Singapore costs a bomb. Why?
@malaysiakini Save whom n why?
@malaysiakini Some guys belong to the class of untouchables.He was very fast to call on Tun M.
@fmtoday 1Malysia was only a slogan to get votes
@HillaryClinton Zero action from Trump
@malaysiakini Try n get everything connected with transport under your purview. Too many Departments under different heads. Very unweidly.
@saifuddinabd We don't need such a gestapo organisation any more.Should be disbanded.
@fmtoday BTN was an evil organisation. Should be disbanded.
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak Whose money?
@malaysiakini That is interesting!
@fmtoday Wait n see. They may lose everything.
@ABCPolitics They were unarmed. U still massacred them.
@fromKMR @BFMradio It should neither be race or religious based.
@EricPaulsen101 Is he still being employed
@CNNPolitics US must not be construed as a bully. N a protector of Israel. If Israel is an aggressor it does not need any protection.
@Media_Selangor Hope the new MACC boss is answerable to Parliament.N has his own persecutionionary powers.
@fmtoday A dangerous frog. Does he have any conscience?
@fmtoday This guy denies all but do the raayat trust him? Not after he chose a working day for voting. That was manipulation.
@limkitsiang That is the idea
@fmtoday @barisanasional That makes sense
@fmtoday @KEADILAN @pakatanharapan_ Will Anwar wait?
@fmtoday U almost took sides
@FoxNews Trump has destroyed any peace agreement. U have already taken the side of Israel.
@fmtoday MIC is an empty self. Then better to disband.
@tankengliang @anwaribrahim Go through the procedures
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ Good suggestion. Anwar should know that.
@malaysiakini U were selfish . U did not think of the members n the country. U failed others too.
@fmtoday My advice to Subramaniam is talk n think of the members but not the future of u leaders.
@fmtoday NSTP must function as a neutral n independent media group. Try n get out of the shackles of UMNO.
@malaysiakini U have to be promoted mam
@EricPaulsen101 The Spad guy
@SivarasaRasiah An old friend must be.
@malaysiakini There should not be such a thing mainstream media. Function like the media in US n Britain.
@limkitsiang Malaysia Bahru
@fmtoday Some of the frogs can be poisonous
@fmtoday Refugees or Frogs we have to be careful n should not rush.
@syedhusinali Frogs must be wetted n don't rush in accepting them.
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 Let us have good choice.
@harismibrahim @Ambiga_S This guy is product of the previous regime. Is he still needed. The paper his employer must decide. His writings were questionable. Will he continue to do so?
@fmtoday Sorry. But still not late. Hope u are included in the ex co. Learn first. Your turn will come.
@malaysiakini Please also explain to Tun M. U owe a lot to him.
@aliranmalaysia Get Tony F explain the whole thing to Tun M.
@aliranmalaysia What about Wan Azizah
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @WattersWorld U can still provide the nessary skills n retain https://t.co/ECUMdRqjaq more humane.
@Newsweek Because Trump is carrying nationalism too far
@501Awani U don't have to bring up the issue to the press. Ask Wan Azizah to discuss the issue with the Presidential  Council.
@EricPaulsen101 All the above can be solved the moment the local councils start functioning as part of the Pakatan outfit.
@zarakahan @Ambiga_S I agree with u wholeheartedly.
@fmtoday Let RTM n TV 3 function like CNN. Not as a government mouthpiece. We must be different from BN.
@PRSupporter All elected representatives should be given their rightful allocations . There should not be any discrimination. Pakatan must practise that. Be different from BN.
@fmtoday That is correct.
@fmtoday What about vitamin M?
@malaysiakini This is a unreliable guy.
@mkula Most honourable thing is to resign.
@mkula Just wait n see
@netraKL @Ambiga_S @wansaiful @LiewChinTong Great guys. PH can do something for them. We owe a lot to them.
@fmtoday @barisanasional U said something else earlier.
@Ambiga_S At 5 pm today
@EricPaulsen101 @AirAsia The guy too must be painted in blue
@EricPaulsen101 @501Awani Resign n rewam
@501Awani Now now SPR needs a rewam.
@EricPaulsen101 Dawn of a new era
@malaysiakini @saifuddinabd Tahaniah
@Ambiga_S The guy will resign if Pakatan takes over
@fahmi_fadzil @dyanasmd Staying home n watching results is best.
@KEADILAN If you are still queing up. Don't go until u have voted.
@AzminAli If it suits them they will close sharp five.
@Ambiga_S Yes they must allow them to finish voting
@malaysiakini It is only an apology. Wasn't it deliberately sent late?
@theSundaily Soon nobody will be listening to this guy.
@malaysiakini This message is long overdue.
@anwaribrahim @chedetofficial One month from today
@malaysiakini @chedetofficial Dedak speaking
@fmtoday Hope u retain yr seat Mr Mullah
@anwaribrahim Raayat awakening
@Ambiga_S Drive carefully. Vote wisely
@fmtoday Drive https://t.co/QlDOw5U2H7 wisely.
@syahredzan @EricPaulsen101 @SinarOnline @SyedSaddiq Palsu
@Ambiga_S U make a good opposition leader
@tianchua @tonyfernandes LTL himself is threatened
@EricPaulsen101 Malay Awakening?
@FirdausAzil @501Awani @NajibRazak Go for Pakatan
@malaymail What do u expect?
@malaysiakini @pakatanharapan_ @barisanasional Confusing?
@NajibRazak Including 1Mdb
@teresakok The MCA guy is getting VVIPs to campaign. Will it work?
@Ambiga_S That is the standard of EC. Nuts to them
@CNN That is his wish.
@EricPaulsen101 His troubles are starting. Business people are more astute. OR he is dumb.
@The_Newsmakers @SyedSaddiq Syed will win
@mkula An holy keleptocrat ?
@malaysiakini Too late. That is how Indians are treated by Bee End
@NajibRazak Hope Tun M can deliver his special message before that.
@EricPaulsen101 @tonyfernandes U are in for big surprises my friend.
@fmtoday Another mouthpiece
@fmtoday Is TF on guard duties?
@CNN Add up to the 3000lies
@fmtoday Ku Li has missed the boat. Why?
@malaysiakini U are getting wrong feedback. Ha ha ha
@malaysiakini Does Air Asia belong to BN?
@jsadiq @chedetofficial @NajibRazak Tun M
@syedhamidalbar Well said tan Sri. People now want change.
@malaysiakini @kinitv Tun the lady is on dedak
@malaysiakini We will see

@fmtoday @barisanasional @pakatanharapan The three Umno kingpins will spearhead change not only change in Umno but the whole country
@limkitsiang It is going to happen on May 9
@mkula It is better that he thinks that way
@tonypua I thought it is the other way round.
@NajibRazak Too little too late
@mkini_bm @n_izzah What a big deal? Tks Chef Wan. U can influence CHANGE
@pseudolokun @Ambiga_S I don't think that they will get their ballot papers in time
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ Sometimes analysts cannot be trusted.
@CNN Are u justifying more guns?
@fmtoday Will they be impacted or Umno be impacted?
@501Awani Nik Omar is the alto ego of Nik Aziz who will guide Pakatan to bring out CHANGE
@fmtoday Why is retired policemen still voting postal? The reasons given is not convincing.
@rafiziramli @PDRMsia @NajibRazak Maybe soon

@malaysiakini Why? All in the same house. Maybe planned.
@DrRaisYatim @SyedSaddiq Embrace change. Don't be afraid.
@malaysiakini If BN wins. I doubt.
RT @malaysiakini: Harapan blitzes Putrajaya; Gruelling battles in Malay heartland; Mokhzani joins fray https://t.co/21Y4VfO6pr https://t.co…

@politico Giuliani acts like he is the President.
@fmtoday But Warison wants change. So Sabah Boleh UBAH. UBAH
@NajibRazak The Prime Minister says election is a serious affair. Let us take him seriously. We must tell him that we want change. If he is serious he must allow change in this country.

@NajibRazak The others are also working n good of the raayat.
@fmtoday @chedetofficial @pakatanharapan_ @barisanasional Real fear of Malay tsunami. Change is what the voters want.
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ Simple economics. Can be done Don't frighten the voters.
@fmtoday Sad we are on the verge
@limkitsiang It is just a mouthpiece.
@NajibRazak Paid crowds are they.? PH crowds come n pay.
@The_Mole @xrockybrux Wrong timing. Gifts OR.. fishing for votes?
@Ambiga_S It is a MCA party paper. But change is good for all Malaysians. Voting Pakatan will bring that good.

@TheRakyatRasmi @1MDB U should not waste time with that guy
@NBCNews Trump the magician must have done something.
@bersih2 @Ambiga_S Can we trust this guy?
@fmtoday What to do. Part of the dirty tricks
@hannahyeoh Well done. Great show
@EricPaulsen101 That is expecting too much from our Bee End government.
@NajibRazak Complete 2020 first. Do not deviate. People know that.
@fmtoday Now DAP can take care of Chinese interest. MCA is just Dumno 'a lackey.
@NajibRazak Be part of history. Be part of change.
@fmtoday Vote him in first. Then he will support PH.
@mpklang @syahredzan Change is in the air
@bersih2 @n_izzah Maybe on somebody 's instruments.

@malaysiakini @kinitv Is EC a facilitator or a disruptor?
@malaysiakini Victory for PH

@MsiaChronicle @anwaribrahim Maybe part of the cheating process
@PRSupporter Some people work for others on orders

@mkula All the best
@politico Eying a Noble

@mkula Tsunami is real
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ @barisanasional Poodah
@niknazmi Misti menang
@NajibRazak A very tame n stage managed interview. Many facts still have to verified.
@malaysiakini That's what u say. I think it is the other way round.
@fmtoday Doesn't sound convincing
@patricklsk The Chairman sounds amateurish
@EricPaulsen101 This is rediculous
@mkula Look at the type of observer countries EC has selected. It just shows EC's standard!!!!
@patricklsk @anwaribrahim Most voters can feel change is in the air.
@fmtoday @chedetofficial @pakatanharapan_ @dapmalaysia Words of a desperado
@EricPaulsen101 @nsurendrann I am still wondering why
@malaysiakini @NajibRazak Hard times OR Silver Platter?
@malaysiakini Yb don't let the press use u
@NajibRazak Looks stage managed. Open up to other foreign press
@malaysiakini He talks great. Taxpayers are settling the debts.
@fmtoday I think it is going to be the opposite.
@AdaApaDgnCikTeh Fifteen yrs u sleep. Then u talk of development n put the blameTun M. Voters know that.
@501Awani There will be a lot of casualties.? Can u guess?
@jsadiq The party itself is a joke
@BBCWorld Does Macron know that Trump is a great actor
@malaysiakini Wait for Pru14 results
@TomPerez Taxpayers money???
@malaysiakini @pakatanharapan_ @abdulhadiawang From the skyWhat about Pas?
@PhilipRucker @AshleyRParker Too close for comfort
@m_kayveas @fmtoday Advisor to Perak?
@fmtoday Maybe another sandiwara.
@fmtoday What about u?
@fmtoday Don't make unnecessary conditions.
@AzminAli PH is now stronger. N hard to beat. Go for change. Let us have the new government.
@mariachin @drwanazizah Congratulations. U will win
@muharikah Pills
@DrDzul @chedetofficial A gigantic crowd. Change is coming.
@NajibRazak Jobs created. Good. But also go to too many foreigners. Why?
@NajibRazak Change will also be good
@malaysiakini @ybz99 Pl put the house in order soon. PKR stands for degnified orderliness. Show it.
@Ambiga_S Questionable leadership. ? OR Crazy for power.
@fmtoday Malay tsunami  looks real
@PRSupporter Not the right party
@The_Mole Unified PH will bring victory for PH
@CNNPolitics Mitt Romney is already talking for Trump. Ha ha ha
@malaysiakini Both must resolve their differences to finalise a list for the betterment of PH. Party unity is important. U are already a victim of media gossip.
@malaymail I am sure Pakatan can  do a better job when they come to power.
@NajibRazak I don't think the other PAC opposition members agree with him.
@malaymail Election goodies?
@chedetofficial Must go. Be part of the change.
@501Awani A Korean n now a Palestinian. Why in our country?
@malaysiakini Flags don't vote
@Media_Selangor Betul betul . Go for change
@PRSupporter Yes yes go for PH
@staronline Use yr vote for change
@malaysiakini Very good turnout. They want change. Victory for PH in the pocket
@fmtoday Both needs one another.U can still work out something.
@fmtoday Whose loan n who is paying?
@malaysiakini Stage managed
@NajibRazak @barisanasional That foreign money is coming in anticipation of PH victory.
@malaysiakini If BN wins
@nrfathihaa @SyedSaddiq Syed must win. Help him win.
@malaysiakini U are the government. So change it as u want.
@fmtoday @zaidibrahim @dapmalaysia @pakatanharapan_ Why now on these remarks on DAP? Sounds sour grapes.
@malaysiakini These days it is only postponement. Why no party elections?
@EricPaulsen101 The Iron Lady has spoken. Why is the cow lady still waiting?
@PRSupporter The raayat too wants her to pay back the money.
@hannahyeoh U will still win
@chedetofficial Winds of change. N Malay tsunami. On the way
@malaysiakini Not been used maybe
@chedetofficial All the best
@limkitsiang Will they do that?
@malaysiakini @barisanasional With so much of scandals am surprised that there is still support. Wait n see
@bernamadotcom @Khairykj @NajibRazak Lots of programs at election eve. Why?
@malaymail Bravado with figures. Unemployment in the country is still high.
@Media_Selangor Winds of change. Victory is in the air for PH.
@limkitsiang This clearly shows something is funny.
@NajibRazak Not for telling the truth. But to be blinded to the lies. Maybe a seat can be offered to him
@fromKMR @chedetofficial People are now energised n anxious to vote. Hope they vote PH.
@PRSupporter DAP  jadi PM is nonsense. People should not believe the story at all. Vote PH n Tun M will be PM. Good for the country.
@MelGohCNA @jsadiq ROS must be fair n not take sides.
@fmtoday Don't pass the blame. U were incompetent.
@tonyfernandes That is the spirit.
@fmtoday Don't quarrel. Work something out.
@fmtoday Does not matter
@niknazmi Their scandals are overbearing. A change is best
@mkula Looks like Malay tsunami is real. Well done PH
@malaysiakini Politics at schools?
@EricPaulsen101 What a joke? These are crony countries. Countdnt we have got better countries?
@fmtoday In the first place why wasn't ECRL subjected to international tender? We would have saved a lot of money there itself. Maybe we would have a avoided taking a crony company.
@mkula An insult to the voters
@fmtoday Bos kastam is confused
@mkula EC ?
@malaymail Their own self inflicted wounds
@malaysiakini Just a paid mouthpiece.
@malaysiakini It is a good idea to seek court ruling.
@fmtoday Am I dreaming?
@fmtoday What entrepreneurs. Can't even get jobs for Indians in the government. U are part my friend.
@EricPaulsen101 SPR can we trust this body. ?
@EricPaulsen101 It is happening in PD
@fmtoday @chedetofficial @NajibRazak Why don't u take over.?
@mkula My town PD is already full of BN flags. Why the double standard?
@malaysiakini Must say that. Otherwise  u are gone
@mkula Which son?
@NajibRazak @barisanasional Can more houses help in getting more votes?
@limkitsiang It will be done.
@NajibRazak Teluk Intan another shaky seat for BN. Will a visit by their President help?
@EricPaulsen101 Hadi lost two states. What more. Be just an imam.
@fmtoday No sentimentality. Just vote Tun M in.
@malaymail I think he should do that. It is next anyway
@fmtoday @m_kayveas @TengkuAdnanReal @myPPP_HQ @barisanasional Don't just pick winnable seat only.
@FoxNews Expected of Russia
@malaysiakini Tun M will only get more votes
@zaidibrahim But change the Government we must.
@fmtoday Of course that is expected. But Sabah is already on shaky grounds.
@mpklang Call the press n highlight this EC doing.
@n_izzah @NajibRazak Double standards. Does China need Malaysia's help.
@malaysiakini Double standards. What about Malaysian companies?
@EricPaulsen101 That guy should take note
@fmtoday Will the guy apologise if PH win the next election.
@malaysiakini What about u sir?Maybe Imam of national mosque
@RajaPetra But there was a fabulous turnout to listen to him
@malaysiakini We stand united n together we fall.
@NajibRazak Sabah is going to fall. So I gather
@EricPaulsen101 That is what u expect from a party paper. There was a fantabulous crowd.
@Ambiga_S @drwanazizah @AzminAli U are right. Like other parties some candidates can be announced now.Why wait?
@malaysiakini The frontman
@fmtoday Ensure there are no scandals in MARA
@hmetromy Good decision. What about the cows?
@teresakok More should follow the Ironlady. The truth must come out. We want change.
@fmtoday They both will do well.
@politico @POLITICOMag Trump is trying to change the Republicans but they should change him. Otherwise the Democrats will do that.
@Sivatronoh Perak needs change n so too the whole country.
@lawyers4liberty @EricPaulsen101 We are notorious outside the country. OR famous?
@n_izzah Too many scandals in MARA. BN is not the right government for Mara. PH should take over .
@Ambiga_S Langkawi is for Tun M
@malaysiakini The Iron Lady needs answers.
@NajibRazak @barisanasional People are getting poorer
@fmtoday If they still want u why not
@malaysiakini We need a lot of cows to help her win her seat
@fmtoday Propaganda
@mkula Won't u regret if PH wins the next election?
@malaysiakini Almost.? Still the rest?
@chedetofficial Langkawi for PH
@theSundaily U will face the civil servants in Putra Jaya
@mkula Very good suggestion. PH should go along
@fmtoday @YouTube Up up Felda. Rise up n PH will solve yr problems
@malaysiakini More cows will be happy
@mkula Apparently they walked out
@501Awani U have missed the boat forever.
@malaysiakini Civil servants are matchured enough to know whom to vote
@malaysiakini Maybe dedak has gone in
@malaysiakini MCA riding on Umno for Malay support
@zaidibrahim They are also been paid by taxpayers money it is in order to sack them
@fmtoday @pakatanharapan_ @HINDRAF1 Mufti must be sacked.
@fmtoday @barisanasional For NS change is the best
@anwaribrahim @sirsazly Yes it is coming
@malaysiakini What about yr credentials?a
@malaymail Good choice. Work hard n victory is ours.
@malaysiakini When voters are determined they will find ways n means to come n vote u out.
@malaysiakini But u have made it easy. Tks
@cmlimguaneng Foreigners maybe!!!!
@malaysiakini Its a MCA seat!!!!!
@fmtoday @barisanasional They should m then see the results
@mkula Putting fear into the raayat for no reason
@malaysiakini Only cows will vote for her
@theSundaily To pull votes!!!
@malaysiakini Childish
@fmtoday @NajibRazak @cmlimguaneng @chedetofficial @barisanasional Amusing!!!
@malaysiakini What credibility? U are his master's voice
@louisliaw @SyedSaddiq The incumbent must be beaten too
@NajibRazak It is the other way round
@ChinaDailyUSA Maybe he did his job but in a wrong way.
@NajibRazak But u were part of the government!!!
@fmtoday @KhalidSamad @PartiAmanah @pakatanharapan_ Good example
@iamthelennard @Ambiga_S Vote PH fo Fahmi
@theSundaily EC made a blunder n cannot be trusted any more. Why choose a working day?
@fmtoday Lots of debts because of BN. Drop BN n vote PH which run Felda well n settle debts.
@Lila_cmo @dyanasmd Still why on a working day?
@EricPaulsen101 Can't we get more credible countries?
@malaymail That is the way. Felda should vote for PH
