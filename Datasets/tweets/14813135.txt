I am amused by those talking heads that predict that the Dems have anywhere form 70-90% chance of winning the House.  With only a 4-7 seat spread and 36 toss-ups, at best the estimate is 10%-90%, in other words the numbers don't say anything.  #Elections https://t.co/mcQHSNeKEM

@Acosta, yes, Mr. Acosta, by sensationalizing and making up stories that are not there in order to line up your pockets and that of CNN with profit, you have abandoned truth in journalism, stomped on civil public discourse and yes become an enemy of the people.

During the last 2 weeks, 9 House toss up polls have swung further towards Red and none towards Blue.  If we conservatively estimate, 2/3 of those seats remain Red (incumbants), then the outcome should be 220R and 215D.  Prediction: 225R, 210D.  No wave at all.
