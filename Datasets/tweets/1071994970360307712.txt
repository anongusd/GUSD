Someone dumb enough to leave America and get stuck somewhere else kind of deserves what they get, I mean really just research it, people that have never been outside of their own bubble and the next thing you know someone comes along and Pops it!
I can't believe people actually think they're going to go to Africa and get an education, I mean usually it's the other way around like is it for America can give you a greater education or more like indoctrination unless you can avoid it.
If someone gets stuck in Africa after going there on some kind of #scholarship, they might want to look in the mirror and think twice before they do go because not everybody's coming out to come rescue you!

@carolynreams1 @PatriciStr @FBI It's the start of the campaign announcements, it's just another deep State maneuver by the pencil neck FBI lawyers,  all they did was make themselves look like a bunch of idiots is if Rodger Stone killed somebody,  this is political overreach,  it shows how politicized the FBI is

Having your own innocent child intentionally killed is absolutely evil. This is repulsive. Pro-choice people call this "fetus porn" for pro-lifers, but if you watch this and don't have a single emotion stir in you, you are completely dead inside. 💀 https://t.co/RsX9xgyYsZ

@keg2014gek Thank you for the follow, my account is suspended in till Monday please bear with me, thank you.

@Unite4Truth @donlemon @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/xxscHd0qZO
@keg2014gek That dude Don Lemon looks more white than black to me!
@keg2014gek I was slowly gradually pushing the envelope trying to be vulgar but not too vulgar just to push the envelope, I pulled no favoritism for anyone and it was intentional!
@keg2014gek The whole purpose of this is an experiment
@keg2014gek I also know when I send a DM when I try to send a screenshot or a photograph it won't send but it will send text through direct messaging
@keg2014gek Well Twitter has suspended my account activity the clock is winding down but it appears the Tweet is still up but I went through the procedure of removing it, I know I can delete it but I won't, I noticed I can unfollow someone but I can't follow someone in return.
Because it's an experiment and I wanted to be public!
Strangely enough when I did this experiment which I kind of planned, I'm sure my account was being monitored or there was a report, of course I'm not sure what criteria or what triggers, I've been trying a variety of things just as tests, why am I saying this,
So my main account was suspended temporarily for 7 days so I created another account and what I did was I documented it along the way so I could reply to my own account record it and see what would happen if I retweeted the same thing on my account,
I still think Beyonce is a dude #Beyonce
