Policymakers must not wait until the 11th hour to fix Social Security, and instead they should work together – through the regular process or a bipartisan commission – to develop a comprehensive plan to make Social Security solvent for the next 75 years and beyond.
#FixtheDebt co-chairs Governor Ed Rendell and Senator Judd Gregg: Numbers don’t lie, and demographics don’t either. The Trustees’ reports show in black and white what we all already know – Social Security and Medicare are running out of reserves. https://t.co/M2Q4j5fbBX
The longer we wait to fix Social Security and Medicare, the more severe any adjustments will be and the less time will be available for policymakers to phase in solutions and for workers to prepare.
The Trustees project the Social Security trust fund will deplete its reserves by 2034. At that point, Social Security will not be able to make scheduled payments in full and all beneficiaries will face an across-the-board benefit cut of 21 percent, no matter age or need.
On a combined basis, the Trustees now show Social Security is already running deficits, even including interest.

Lawmakers need to stop the digging and come up with a plan now to put our debt on a downward path that can be phased in over time. Waiting until the 11th hour means choices that are much more difficult if not unimaginable. (7/8)
CBO’s annual report is a reminder that the situation is getting worse, not better, and the day of reckoning is fast approaching. (6/8)
Today’s report also projects that all major trust funds – including Social Security – will become insolvent within the next 13 years. Anyone who argues this course can continue is living with blinders. (5/8)
Our nation’s debt is headed toward a tipping point. CBO projects indefinite trillion-dollar deficits will return in just two years, and debt could exceed the economy in just over a decade or perhaps sooner. (4/8)
The following is a statement from the Campaign to #FixtheDebt Co-Chairs Judd Gregg and Edward Rendell (3/8)
Under current law, our already historically high debt will rise from 77 percent of the economy today to 96 percent by 2028. Under CBO’s Alternative Fiscal Scenario, debt will rise to 105 percent of the economy. (2/8)
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook for the next decade today, which warned that our fiscal situation is worsening rapidly. (1/8)
