His dedication to others and his love for country are why he and his family worked so tirelessly to improve educational opportunities, especially expanding the power of literacy, for all. #Remembering41
Despite reaching our Nation’s highest office, his story was never of himself. He’d tell you of his love for Bar, how proud he was of his children and how enamored he was by his grandchildren, because George H.W. Bush cared about people more than anything else. #Remembering41

There's no one more important to a student's education than a great teacher. Great teachers need to be supported, should be better compensated and should be treated as professionals.

Right now, we have a president and a Congress led by folks who support giving parents more freedom. This is our moment. There are those who are vulnerable, those who are poor, those who are forgotten right around us. Our children can't wait.
To be clear: I firmly believe every state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education, but those are decisions families in states must make. That doesn't mean I’m staying on the sidelines. Washington can and should come alongside states to empower families.
A great example of choice and freedom in education are 529 plans. The federal government respects each state's right to offer, operate and design plans tailored to their own unique needs – a rare instance where Washington stuck to its appropriate role.
I'm committed to expanding education freedom for families. You've heard me described as “pro-school choice.” Well, I am, but choice in education isn't limited to a student picking this building or that school, not public versus private. Choice in education is bigger than that.
As I shared this morning: I'm learning it's not popular for someone in my position to point out hard truths – to admit the current system isn't serving every student well. But I didn’t take this job to win over editorial boards and trend on social. I took it to serve students.
Pleased to speak at the Al Smith breakfast today. We had an important conversation on helping disadvantaged students. Al Smith dedicated his life to fighting for the vulnerable – believing the best solutions to problems are found in the home, between neighbors and in communities.

Congratulations to the class of 2018! I wish you all the best as you embark on the next step of your journey.
As you venture out into the world, know that your life won’t always unfold according to plan. Anticipate being called to something different, to something unexpected. Don’t avoid a change in course, an alternate path. Don’t fear the unknown. Embrace the mess.
What will you do to put your newly gained skills to work in service of others? Now is the time to start doing it. And what you do now is up to you. It’s not up to your parent’s. It’s not up to your teachers. It’s up to you. As Mother Teresa said, "Find your own Calcutta." https://t.co/RwrJVwUOpr
America is the most prosperous nation on the face of the earth, and it’s also the most generous. But that strong tradition isn’t just passed along from generation to generation in the blood stream.		It’s taught.	It’s learned.	It’s shared.
No matter your anticipated profession, each of you has the potential to make a profound difference for others. https://t.co/YFxMphljj3
I want to focus on a key component of life that’s at the core of what it means to be an American: service. Public service isn't self-service. It's about serving others. For me, it’s the moral obligation to expand educational opportunities for *each* and *every* child.
As I addressed the 2018 graduating class of @avemariauniv this morning, I reflected on graduates from all across the country. God gave each of us unique talents and we can choose what to do with them. However, we should not bury them in the ground. I urge you to go for greatness.

My heart is broken for the family and friends of Jaelynn Willey, one of the victims of the recent shooting at Great Mills High School in Maryland. This tragedy further underscores our need to act with urgency to ensure our students and teachers are safe at school.
Important step today as @POTUS signs #STOPSchoolViolenceAct into law. This law will help make students and schools safer – providing states and communities with assistance in their efforts to prevent school violence.
Education can truly change the trajectory of a child’s life – all they need is the chance to attain it. That is the focus of this administration and the focus of this budget.
The federal government does not and cannot know the unique needs of each individual student in America. Parents and teachers know their students and their needs best. With this budget we can continue to return power to those who walk side-by-side with students every day.
The Budget eliminates, streamlines or reduces funding for many discretionary programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, are ineffective, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds – reducing taxpayer costs by $6.7 billion. https://t.co/aQKnsSDBBL
This budget sharpens and hones the focus of our mission: serving students by meeting their needs. This Administration is committed to reducing the federal footprint in education and improving opportunities and outcomes for all students while returning power to those closest them.
Pleased to testify before @HouseAppropsGOP to testify on the President’s FY2019 Budget Request for the Department. Our budget puts students first.

I don’t trust Washington or those who blindly defend the status quo. I trust parents and teachers, and I believe in students. We must do better for them. We must do better for our teachers, for our parents, for our students, for our country. #PTALegCon
It’s time we pursue a paradigm shift, a fundamental reorientation – a rethink. https://t.co/tWfEmJnGYO
We must always encourage a culture of creativity and innovation in education – always challenge ourselves to do better in the same way we always challenge our students to do better. Our children deserve learning environments that are agile, relevant, exciting. #PTALegCon
The federal-first, top-down approach distorts what education ought to be: a trusting relationship between teacher, parent and student. Ideally, parent and teacher work together to help prepare a child for a fulfilling life and successful careers. #PTALegCon
Greater empowerment can’t be limited to just parents. We need to give teachers more flexibility too so they can implement their own creative solutions to better meet students’ needs. #PTALegCon
Parents have the greatest stake in the outcome of their child’s education. Accordingly, they should also have the greatest power to make sure their child is getting the best education. #PTALegCon

The tragedy in Parkland, Florida was a sad reminder that there is still much work to be done to ensure no parent, no teacher, no student has to again endure what many did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Yet another thing you didn't see on @60Minutes: I did respond to this misguided question. Every student should have the opportunity to learn in the way and at the pace that best fits their unique needs, regardless of zip code or family income. https://t.co/LbXjOcSkH2

Here’s what we shared with @60Minutes, which of course they didn’t show you: Michigan, like much of the nation, isn’t doing well enough to prepare students. Scores are stagnant. Students need more options, and we must rethink our approach to education. https://t.co/GJ0kdI2GPE

All students must be safe and protected in their learning environment. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach for every state, or for every school, we will continue to raise the questions, ideas and solutions that keep students safe as they pursue their passions at school.

Be different. Be bold. Try something unexpected. Do something new. #RethinkSchool
What students really need won’t originate in Washington. It will come from entrepreneurs, philanthropists, teachers and parents – those closest to students. And it may well come from the students themselves. #SXSWEDU
“Rethink” means we question everything to ensure nothing limits a student from pursuing his or her passion, and achieving his or her potential. So that each student is prepared at every turn for what comes next. #SXSWEDU
After learning that @FAFSA – a lender with one of the largest consumer loan portfolios – doesn’t have a mobile app, I challenged our team to bring federal financial services into today’s reality. Looking ahead to the next generation, we're developing an app that will soon launch.

We must pursue a paradigm shift – a fundamental reorientation – a rethink. Question everything, at every school, in support of every student’s success.	We can act now. We must act now.
ESSA plans aren’t a ceiling. There is no ceiling. There is no ceiling on what students can achieve. These plans merely establish the floor!
The imperative to do something shouldn’t have to come from Washington. It shouldn’t have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. #StatesLeading
Multiple governors shared concerns about their state's plans. One warned that "adding layers of bureaucratic paperwork does little to help low-performing schools." Another lamented his state's plan "includes provisions aimed at preserving the status quo in failing schools."
Just because a plan complies with the law doesn’t mean it does what’s best for students. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won’t pass muster around kitchen tables. #StatesLeading
The Every Student Succeeds Act provided increased state and local flexibility to ensure the educational success of our students. But there are far too many plans only meeting the bare minimum required by law. We can and must do better for our students. @CCSSO
If 4th causes the @USOlympic to take a hard look at improving, shouldn't ranking globally 24th in reading, 25th in science and 40th in math spark some change? The time is now to empower parents and teachers to help students learn and grow. https://t.co/hQeiWjGHT7

.@POTUS is proposing the most ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation’s history. #EdRevolution
I firmly believe every state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education. But those are decisions states must make.
We won’t accomplish our goals by creating a new federal bureaucracy or by bribing states with their own taxpayers’ money. #EdRevolution
In order to succeed, education must commit to excellence and innovation to better meet the needs of individual students. #EdRevolution
If we really want to help students, everything about education must focus on individual students – funding, supporting &amp; investing in them.
Everyone – in both parties – should support equal opportunity in education, regardless of a child’s income, zip code or family circumstances

No parent should feel like @USEDGOV thinks it knows better than they what is best for their child.
No teacher in any classroom should feel like @USEDGOV is holding them back from success with their kids.
This isn't right, nor is it acceptable. Under this Administration, we will break this habit.
Too often, @USEDGOV has gone outside established authority &amp; created roadblocks – wittingly or unwittingly – for parents &amp; educators alike.
No two schools are identical, just like no two students are alike. We shouldn’t assume that the same answer will work every time.
... that prepares them to graduate high school ready for college or career education. (2/2)
#ESSA requires states to ensure ALL students have access to excellent teachers &amp; a positive, safe learning environment... (1/2)
#ESSA provides states the latitude to do what’s best for children while preserving important civil rights protections.
#ESSA ensures transparency and accountability provisions for all schools.
We’re doing what’s best for children by implementing #ESSA as Congress intended, w/ the freedom &amp; flexibility state &amp; local leaders deserve.
The underlying principles of #ESSA are built on that same trust.
My philosophy is simple: I trust parents, I trust teachers and I trust local school leaders to do what’s right for the children they serve.
I support great public schools &amp; I support great public school teachers, because I support students – ALL students.
If a child is able to grow and flourish, it shouldn’t matter where they learn.
In too many cities and states, parents are still denied the simple but critical choice of what school their child attends.
When parents are empowered to take charge of their children's education, when they have quality options, we see better results for students.
Parents know better than any politician or administrator the unique needs of each of their children.
I’ve seen the changes in a community when it chooses to come together and invest in the rising generation.
My heart has leapt to see big smiles on the faces of kids who are in a school that welcomes, challenges &amp; embraces them for who they are.
I got involved in education because I saw firsthand how many children &amp; parents struggled to find a school that met their needs.

I consider protecting all students, including #LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America.
Schools, communities, and families can find – and in many cases have found – solutions that protect all students.
A federal court in August 2016 issued a nationwide injunction barring the Department from enforcing a portion of the previous guidance.
This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate.
We have a responsibility to protect every student &amp; ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment.
