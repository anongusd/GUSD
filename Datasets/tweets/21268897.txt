@jmcconnell53 That's a fair point. It's quite personal. Many people simply don't take it seriously or see it as a kind of footnote concern. Others - Jews and non-Jews - try to weaponize it to advance political interests. It's all regrettable and damaging.

@nycsouthpaw paw, There are definitely a lot of people trying to weaponize anti-Semitism in bad faith. But you're wrong to call this an "ancient conspiracy theory" or some arbitrary argument over words. It's not ancient. It's modern. It's present. It's a real thing you should take seriously.
No. That's a stupid point. And you may be a stupid person. It is that it's a Jewish surname and using a dollar sign to spell it is pretty standard gross anti-Semitic bullshit.

@maxberger @SulomeAnderson Completely agree. This is why I‚Äôve said it behooves Jews to try to educate people about this history, why there‚Äôs this reaction and find bases for working together. What‚Äôs troubling here is that it keeps happening.
@maxberger @SulomeAnderson As I said earlier, I agree that this is likely a key part of the equation. But she is also a member of Congress with an important voice. So I think the criticism is merited.
@nberlat @SulomeAnderson Exactly.
@SulomeAnderson Like many Jews I think right wing antisemitism is a far bigger menace than anything Omar is saying or doing. And, as I‚Äôve written, I‚Äôm not convinced she‚Äôs an antisemite at all. But what you‚Äôre saying here is just whataboutism, which is a weak argument.

People get bored discussing the genuinely disastrous and immoral foreign policy decisions the US has made and decide to make up new ones. Sad.
@Rrrrnessa 3/ these points in to explain why it's the US's fault that Bosnia is partitioned, or ethnically segregated is weak historically as it is morally.
@Rrrrnessa 2/ It's notable too that it certainly looks like your claim that the US is responsible for the ethnically segregated status of Bosnia is rooted in the US being founded on genocide and slavery, as you put it. The US certainly has very dark aspects of its history but carting ...
@Rrrrnessa I know what it referred to. So your point is that the US came on the scene and decided, wouldn't it be good to ethnically divide this country? Or was the country already largely divided into ethnic cantons and separation seemed the only plausible way to end the fighting?

Some of this debate abt "allegiance" is a vocabulary problem. If you look in military literature, the notation under "allegiance" is the country that military officer or soldier serves. It's specific and restrictive in this context. It also has a history with Jews. Not hard.
@JHWeissmann @EricLevitz @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @IlhanMN To answer your question, we are not going to restrict free speech and association rights in this country. Period. We can disagree with BDS. But it's a boycott movement. It's a free speech and association issue in this country. It's wrong. Period. Not hard.
@JHWeissmann @BigMeanInternet @EricLevitz @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @IlhanMN This is not a fine distinction. Words only have meaning in history and historical context. Saying you're a "strong supporter" of a country is simply not at all the same as saying you have an "allegiance" to it. Again, words are bound in history. This isn't complicated.

@EricLevitz @jonathanchait @EricKleefeld @elivalley @IlhanMN My take, or what was my take, is that she was raised in an insular/immigrant community &amp; either absorbed ideas that were hostile to Jews or lacked grounding in western history of AS and the language around it.

@wovenstrap It is all contingent. So yes. You never step in the same river twice. You communicate in the language as you find it. So certainly ignoring rules for the sake of doing so doesn‚Äôt make sense. Some rules become customary even if they were pointless in their origin.
@dinerlee Actually that makes zero sense.
@steveseel Among other things, yes
@knomad This is not at all inconsistent with what I wrote. The point is that rules are only valid if they facilitate the clear expression and understanding of meaning. Many rules don‚Äôt actually meet that standard.

FWIW, I adhere to the school of thought that holds that the only standard in language - diction, usage, style - is what does or does not facilitate the clear conveyance of meaning between writer and reader. All the rest is pedantry.
@bgzimmer @PeterSokolowski @Averre13 @ArrantPedantry Okay this was seriously majestic. Some of these rules do have some clarifying impact. But this one has always struck me as of no utility and pure pedantry. To my ear which often sounds more natural, fluid when that is supposedly the correct usage.

@PeterSokolowski @bgzimmer @Averre13 Part of my thinking on this is just the functional reality of language.

@bgzimmer @Averre13 I think it‚Äôs one of these cases where the alternative simply doesn‚Äôt sound natural in spoken English.
@kthagen No, this was my point. I meant to the AP folks. My general acquaintance with people in linguistics is their functionalism, that a language is as it is used. So entirely against this, sure this is what we all say but it‚Äôs wrong to write it.

@ktheintz I confess I‚Äôm skeptical abt someone in their late 70s being up to the physical rigors of the presidency. Though frankly Pelosi is a pretty decent counter to that skepticism.
@david_darmofal May be a 60s pride issue
@ot_ford The semi-decent point is that Dems have a number of quite dynamic leaders who are well into their 70s. I don‚Äôt see that as a problem necessarily but it is fairly new historically.
There‚Äôs a semi decent point deeply hidden here. But on its face this is laughably dumb. Dems face a strategic crisis because while they have numerous candidates in their 40s, 50s and 70s they have none in the critical 60-something sweetspot? https://t.co/6BGXeX0wAR

@edbott @pmanzo Yes, but the c4 is used because it's intended to operate within the realm of regulated political giving/speech, no?
@edbott @pmanzo But point taken that sometimes you can get the same secrecy while grabbing your tax subsidy along with it.
@edbott @pmanzo Right. I'm just saying that all the need for shady this and aggressive that is really BY DEFINITION an effort to get tax preference because you don't need to hide if you're just giving your money without preference vehicles.
@edbott @pmanzo It's also worth noting that as a legal matter you can give money to anyone you want with no disclosure at all - if you agree to do so without tax preferment. So all these efforts, by definition are efforts to subsidize these efforts WITH tax preferment.

@617to416 I will emphasize again, i did not call it an anti-semitic comment and i wouldn't have hesitated if it thought it was. I think it was incautious and damaging. I hope she can think more carefully about the impact of her words.
7/ as some see the political value of equating the two. But this was a deeply unfortunate tweet and it remains so regardless of exactly how the Congresswoman meant it.
6/ that fit so easily into centuries old stereotypes and libels against Jews. This isn't complicated. We need to expect more from people in public life. As I said in my original tweet. McCarthy is a clown. Criticism of Israel does not equal anti-Semitism, as much ...
5/ about using language or constructs that are built on generations of denigration and dehumanization, ones that have been used to justify legal oppression and violence. The same applies here. We should expect people in the public sphere not to casually toss around words ...
4/ support of US evangelicals. But again, the point is a broader one. Words have consequences. We all know that there are African-Americans who are lazy, just like there are in every other ethnic or racial group. But it's just as obvious that we should be extremely careful ...
3/ It behooves people with large public followings to be mindful of this. For what it's worth, AIPAC's power today isn't mainly about money. It's partly about leveraging support among American Jews but even more about mobilizing the far more politically consequential ...
2/ I'll follow up here to a few points people have made. Adjudicating whether this is an anti-Semitic common or simply one that sounds like one isn't the point. Words have consequences, especially with groups who have backgrounds of discrimination, oppression and genocide.
@617to416 Ehhhh. If it was unambiguously anti-Semitic I'd have said so. But this misses the point. obviously some black people are lazy. but we should be extremely cautious about using these charged in the public sphere. The same applies here. There's a history.

@RadioFreeTom @brianweeden @noonanjo @EliLake @sbplama Yes, saying the same. Really no way this is helping us and a lot of ways we're hurting ourselves. But it's not even like, high risks but potential high gain. What gain?
@RadioFreeTom @brianweeden @noonanjo @EliLake @sbplama Also, here i'm really out of my depth but in current geostrategic environment, with the backdrop role of nuclear weapons, a little hard for me to see how these weapons really erode our general nuclear deterrence regardless.
@RadioFreeTom @brianweeden @noonanjo @EliLake @sbplama But it sounds like we're both saying fundamentally the same thing which is that we're not in any way more safe or in a strategically stronger position the day after doing this or a year or ten years after doing this, and probably the opposite. Ergo, no reason to do this.
@RadioFreeTom @brianweeden @noonanjo @EliLake @sbplama Well, I'd also say it's Bolton hates treaties that don't give us 100% freedom of action even if the constrained actions don't achieve a clear purpose. I see this as mainly ideological.
@RadioFreeTom @brianweeden @noonanjo @EliLake @sbplama 2/ This becomes especially clear when some of the reasons have little do with each other or are even contradictory. So, wow, you have several different lines of reasoning all seem to arrive at this one thing you already wanted to do. Wow. Amazing.

3/ for these companies is that none of them are currently owned by people who are in it for any of these reasons. They're owned by people who want to get their money back out with big returns. If BF is basically a break even business or can make a small percentage ...
2/ There are lots of reasons to own a media company that posts consistent if modest profits. There are reasons to own one that just breaks even. There are even reasons to own one that might lose predictable and relatively small amounts of money every year. The big challenge ...
The question for all these companies - VICE, BF, etc - is whether anyone wants to own them for longterm/consistent profitability (or that combined with 'synergy' advantages in a larger media co). They've never lived in that world. None have ever had those kinds of owners.

The only rational response to @HowardSchultz is to boycott and hopefully destroy the company he built @Starbucks. The cash you‚Äôve been laying out for years for bitter coffee is going to help fund four more years of Trump. There‚Äôs @GradysColdBrew. So no real loss.
@dschatsky @jbarro We‚Äôre all on ego trips in some sense. But most of us take some cognizance of the collateral damage we can create. In the present national crisis you‚Äôre either for Trump or your against him. He can only help re-elect Trump. Also 3rd party stunts are bullshit.
Haven‚Äôt been hanging in every word but in the last 48 hrs of his pre-campaign I‚Äôve heard @HowardSchultz attack Medicare 4 All, higher marginal rates, attack social security, embrace fiscal austerity. I‚Äôve heard him say he doesn‚Äôt support a wall. He‚Äôs running as an anti-Democrat.
2/ I think AOC has done a service opening the debate to dramatically higher marginal rates for the super wealthy. But notice Schultz states it as a consensus Dem party position. That‚Äôs demonstrably false. His campaign is based on attacking Democrats.
Worth noting that Schultz‚Äôs program seems heavily weighted to caricaturing and attacking Democrats, and criticism from opponents of Trump seem to intensifying that dynamic. https://t.co/4zjWQIEOah
