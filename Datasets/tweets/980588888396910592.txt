@rickygervais just found out about “hunting with Galgos dogs” in Spain, same cruelty as DCMT.  I want to end this also and wondered if you would be willing to start a petition similar to one sent to Indonesia to spread the word on this as well?  I will help too.  Thoughts?please
@XHNews The Chinese Government is an embarrassment and disgrace to the world.  For such a powerful country to allow their citizens to act like uncivilized degenerates is sickening

@RossThomson_MP Thank you Ross Thompson for recognizing the seriousness of the world standing up to end Dog Cat Meat Trade globally.  It is the stuff of your worst nightmare and those who joke about it should educate themselves before adding ignorant comments
@RossThomson_MP The US banned it to urge China and other countries that do participate in Dog Meat Trade to stop. It is the most stomach turning vile and inhuman behavior I have ever seen and it needs to be ended globally.  I hate seeing all the uneducated responses to a such a serious matter.

@GOPLeader bring H Res 401 for a vote.  No more delaying.  We must get the ball rolling or this will never end!
@RepEdRoyce please urge McCarthy to bring H Res 401 to the floor.  What is it going to take?
@GOPLeader it’s the eve of 2018 Yulin.  Just wanted to remind you since H Res 401 has still not been brought for a vote.
@GOPLeader Please bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  2018 Yulin starts tomorrow can we please make sure it doesn’t happen in 2019
@RepEdRoyce please urge McCarthy  and Ryan to bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  Yulin in 2 days but then it continues everyday all year round.
@GOPLeader Bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  Everyday you delay there are more dogs that have to suffer through being intentionally tortured.
@GOPLeader Ahead of Yulin, video documents horrors of a dog slaughterhouse; 135 dogs rescued from death https://t.co/LyGZVs9vNq
@GOPLeader pleading with you to bring H Res 401 to the floor.  What is stopping you?  This is insane that these poor dogs have to be casualties of war.
RT @VanderpumpDogs: Our Executive Director, Dr. John Sessa is in China right now, on a #VanderpumpDogs international Rescue Mission during…
RT @RepHastingsFL: With the Yulin Dog Meat Festival scheduled to begin in just one week, time is of the essence. @SpeakerRyan and @GOPLeade…
@JenniferHWhite what will it take to get H Res 401 to the floor for a vote?    McCarthy isn’t moving, Yulin is in 2 days.  The Res was approved in committee 11/2017.  Are you in a position to push for this to move forward?
@RepEdRoyce please urge McCarthy to bring H Res 401 for a vote.  Yin is in 2 days.  The delay is insane and unfair to the poor animals that are now guaranteed to be skinned and boiled alive. Please say something to him!
@GOPLeader Please bring H Res 401 for a vote.  Yulin is in 2 days.  This H Res has sat since 11/2017?  What is wrong with this picture!
@RepEdRoyce PLEASE talk to MCCARTHY...bring H Res 401 for a vote... it’s a disgrace that Yulin is starting in 3 days and no stand made by the United States 🇺🇸
@GOPLeader not sure why I’m even bothering at this point but hey why not...PLEASE BRING H RES 401 TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.  2018 Yulin is in 3 days, we have had this approved by the committee since 11/2017.  Don’t worry the dogs that are about to be boiled alive will understand.
@GOPLeader please bring H Res 401 to the floor to a vote.  You hold all the power but refuse to do it?  Why don’t you want to help these poor animals from being tortured?
@RepEdRoyce please urge the Majority Leader to bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  I do not understand why anyone would not want to do anything in their power to stop the intentional torture to dogs and cats.  Sadly right now he has all the power but is doing nothing.
@RepEdRoyce what is it going to take to get anyone to bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote?  For months I have pleaded with McCarthy and Ryan with no response.  Is politics really the problem here?  Dogs are being skinned alive I do not get it.  Please talk to him!
@GOPLeader please bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  We can not stand by and do nothing while animals are being legally tortured.  Doing nothing is not acceptable!
@GOPLeader is it politics?  I don’t get it?  Why won’t you bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote?  The fact that dogs are being legally skinned alive is insanity to me but the fact that the US is doing nothing to represent all of the obvious outrage over this issue is worse!
@Robert_Aderholt what is it going to take to get anyone to bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote?  For months I have pleaded with McCarthy and Ryan with no response.  Is politics really the problem here?  Dogs are being skinned alive I do not get it.  Please talk to him!
@Robert_Aderholt please urge the Majority Leader to bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  This is a no brained and I can’t understand what the hold up is about.  It’s too late to stop another Yulin but the daily horror will continue.  PLEASE HELP!
@GOPLeader please bring H Res 401 to the floor for a vote.  It’s too late to stop Yulin this year but we must continue the fight to end this horror that is taking place everyday.
@GOPLeader Where will you be on Thurs, June 21st?  That’s the first day of the 2018 Yulin Festival.  Why will you not bring H Res 401 for a vote so we can make our voices heard?  Dogs being skinned alive should have nothing to do with politics.
@GOPLeader PLEASE bring H Res 401 for a vote.  Everyone will vote for it, nobody opposes it and it’s the FIRST step to end the continuing horror dogs and cats are facing everyday!  Stop Delaying!
@GOPLeader You must stop 🛑 delaying bringing H Res 401 to the floor for a vote .  NO ONE will vote against it.  Why is it not happening?  Begging you to give me a valid reason for continuing to delay this?  DOGS SKINNED &amp; BLOW TORCHED WHILE ALIVE?  Why?
@GOPLeader PLEASE BRING H RES 401 TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE ALREADY!
