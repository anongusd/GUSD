Shocking revelations that Twitter continues to shadow-ban conservatives such as @Jim_Jordan and @mattgaetz may well constitute FEC violations. I'm calling on Congress to convene hearings with Twitter executives to fully investigate these sleazy and underhanded acts of censorship.
Everyone has a right to be heard. Twitter needs to publicly explain, rectify, and apologize for this issue immediately if they want to retain any credibility among conservatives.
‚ÄúEase of access to a public figure‚Äôs profile should not be contingent on their political leaning. Twitter clearly does not have the interest of its users in mind -- only its own agenda.
As of the release of this statement, searching for certain conservative members of Congress produces parody accounts over official Twitter pages.
This is evidence that Twitter is deliberately censoring conservative voices. It seems Twitter is doing everything in its power to obstruct access to these prominent conservatives and limit the influence of their voices.

We cannot allow our thoughts and ideas to be barred from the global public conversation. https://t.co/QaeDQAEZ4p
This report is evidence that what little effort they have made is not nearly enough. Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube must make real, concrete changes to guarantee conservative voices receive a fair shake. https://t.co/QaeDQAEZ4p
Facebook, Twitter and the rest of the social media giants must allow political expression from both conservative and liberal voices. Just last week, Mark Zuckerberg told Congress that he is working to ensure Facebook is ‚Äúa platform for all ideas.‚Äù https://t.co/QaeDQAEZ4p
Our country is divided and limiting free speech only makes matters worse. https://t.co/QaeDQAEZ4p
However, when the only ideas permitted are from one side, any prospect of intellectual discourse dies. If these platforms merely serve as an echo chamber of liberal talking points, everyone loses.

I am sending a letter today to @Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining why @JoyVBehar's private apology to @VP Pence is not enough. Millions of Christians were offended by her bigoted remarks. Behar needs to publicly apologize -- on air -- for what she said.

When they do that, this whole matter will be put to rest. Until they do, we will not let up our campaign to let the world -- including their advertisers -- know of their anti-Christian bigotry.
The bigoted statements made about the Vice President's Christian faith offended hundreds of millions of Christians across the country, the largest faith group in the United States. Their apology should, therefore, be as public as their insult.
It is a good first step that Joy Behar privately apologized to Vice President Pence, but it is not nearly enough. Behar and ABC need to publicly apologize for the bigoted slurs on ‚ÄòThe View.‚Äô

Next time a liberal talks about Trump being "unpresidential" point to Hillary this last weekend, first with her "bitches supporting bitches" video, then her insults-for-yuks against the president at the Grammys. Stay classy, Hillary.
Maybe Hollywood would look at "historical" movies and tell their audience. "You're not supposed to take these as History! Don't be that dumb." But when movies like "The Post" come out, they tout them as deeply meaningful lectures on America.
