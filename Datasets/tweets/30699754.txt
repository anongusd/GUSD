He was proven right when the French found parts of the weapon in Mali.

@kylecmatthews There's a difference: UK is not denying that Shamima is a UK citizen. They're stripping her of that citizenship. The US is taking a person that by all accounts is a citizen (if she wasn't, why was she issued not 1 but 2 US passports?) and now trying to say she was never American.

@stick631 If it's a slam dunk, there should be a sealed indictment, no? There doesn't appear to be one, despite the fact that her father reported her joining ISIS soon after she left and despite her voluminous Twitter persona as an ISIS cheerleader.
@stick631 You'd think. But there is a 1st amendment challenge: Freedom of assembly + marriage is protected, say the attorneys we are speaking to. From what we have learned, there is no sealed indictment for her, unlike for many of the other Americans caught on the battlefield.
@jeffmurphyy You‚Äôre reading it wrong, bro.
7. Sources tell us that the US may not have enough to successfully charge her. This is an easy way to offload her. According to data tracked by the Times, there are at least 13 Americans tied to ISIS languishing detention camps in Syria. Almost all are women/l and children
6. So why is the US *now* saying that she isn‚Äôt a citizen? This being the same girl that applied for a renewal of her passport in 2014, received the said passport, and successfully used it to fly from Birmingham to Istanbul? Those trying to help her say that this a ‚Äúlegal dodge.‚Äù
5. When Muthana first received her US passport when she was a child, her father was asked to produce proof that he had been discharged from his diplomatic post. Authorities reviewed her case, says her family lawyer, and handed her not just her first passport but also her second.
4. But I just got off the phone with Muthana‚Äôs family attorney and this rule doesn‚Äôt apply to her because her father was discharged from his UN post 1 month before she was born. At the time of her birth, Muthana‚Äôs father was no longer a diplomat hence the exclusion is not valid
3. According to the 14th amendment, people born in the US - as Muthana was - are citizens of the US and ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof.‚Äù What does that mean if you‚Äôre the daughter of a Yemeni diplomat? Well a diplomat is subject to the jurisdiction of his or her own country https://t.co/CaQXgtWBmH
2. Muthana, now 24, has already been issued two US passports: Once when she was a child and the second one in 2014, when she used it to travel overseas to join ISIS. So how can Pompeo say that she‚Äôs not a citizen? The technicality is that she is the daughter of a Yemeni diplomat.
1. A few days ago, I sat down with Hoda Muthana,m in Syria. She had traveled from Alabama to Syria on a US passport but she was worried that her US citizenship might be called into question. That‚Äôs exactly what has happened. See statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: https://t.co/MlbWxh1k6f

@howzitjax @Jasminechic00 Thank you to both of you
@azelin @jenanmoussa I‚Äôve spoken to plenty of Iraqi and Syrian fighters and wives who came out into the desert. Slightly different, but not hugely.
23/ It was in a way shocking to sit in Mohammed Khalifa‚Äôs presence. I knew his voice well - full of bravado, the voice of a terror group vowing to never be cowed. In person, he was meek, even sheepish. But on one point he was defiant: ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt regret it,‚Äù he told me. https://t.co/ax0AhgAQpK
22/ He also denied rumors that British hostage John Cantlie had become one of the editors of Dabiq, the group‚Äôs magazine. He said Cantlie was never seen in the office. The hostage wrote his essays somewhere else, presumably in his cell, &amp; they would be delivered to the media unit https://t.co/erKhsRWdeF
21/ He provided insight into other key figures: He says that American John Georgelas was a fellow translator in the media unit &amp; denied reports that he had become a senior official. He said he was killed in Mayadin circa 2017. @gcaw has written about him: https://t.co/vJNGEMv5VL
20/ He said that at the time of his capture last month, there were still 20 media operatives alive in the last pocket of ISIS control. Furqan was killed in an airstrike years ago. He refused to name the new media emir nor any of the other operatives, keen on protecting them. https://t.co/3ZR3WHBfmb
19/ He also said that beginning in late 2014, after the start of American airstrikes, the media diwan moved into a house in Raqqa proper, and from then on it moved from house to house, always staying close to civilians, aware that their presence protected the terrorists.
18/ Khalifa helped put to rest an enduring debate among analysts: Is Amaq, the group‚Äôs news agency which claims attacks, an official ISIS product? Or is it in some ways independent of ISIS? He said Amaq is 100% core ISIS, but that the Amaq team worked out of a different office.
17/ Khalifa said that initially Furqan had a role in all the major releases, carefully watching the video, giving feedback and demanding edits. Videos shot by the group‚Äôs affiliates overseas had some level of editing by the central media office, which explains the uniform look
16/ The idea was to show the global reach of the caliphate with recruits from 100 different nationalities, and to strike fear in their home countries. The video team staged the horrific beheadings, like on a film set and brought back the footage on an SD card for editing. https://t.co/wnPNndeh1s
15. Furqan had a ‚Äúno celebrity‚Äù culture, said Khalifa. No executioner should rise above the rest in prominence or fame. The obvious exception is Jihadi John. But other than that, executioners were typically used once. The video team looked for killers from different nationalities https://t.co/l6WTjCgQyx
14. In 2014, the Media Diwan was housed inside a villa 20 km outside of Raqqa, along the Euphrates. Its emir was Iraqi national Abu Muhammed al-Furqan. The unit was divided into teams. A video team roamed the caliphate, collecting footage &amp; auditioning potential executioners.
13. Here are some of the revealing things he told @ivorprickett and I about the functioning of Diwan al-Ilam, the Islamic State‚Äôs Ministry of the Media, which put out the televised beheadings of hostages like James Foley &amp; the burning of a Jordanian pilot: https://t.co/BL2z1dtsNF
12/ My friend and colleague @porterthereport worked through the weekend, ordering yearbook after yearbook trying to determine what high school he attended. And @EricSchmittNYT confirmed with a US official that the narrator and Khalifa were one and the same.
11/ He attended Seneca College where he got a diploma in computer systems technology &amp; then worked for an IBM contractor. My colleague @DanBilefsky called the contractor in Ontario &amp; they confirmed his employment there. He also says he worked at CompuCom, They declined to comment https://t.co/PrlBT4xHgO
10/ I played him a clip of the recently captured man and he exclaimed: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him! That‚Äôs Abu Ridwan!‚Äù In my interview with him, Mohammed Khalifa said he went by several noms de guerre, including Abu Ridwan. He said he was born in Saudi &amp; moved to Toronto‚Äôs Regent Park as a boy https://t.co/z3T98xS5mo
9/ Abu Turaab, the second Canadian, confirmed that the narrator is from Toronto and that he went by the nom de guerre Abu Ridwan, but he didn‚Äôt know his real name. @ivorprickett and I also saw Abu Turaab, just weeks after the suspected narrator was captured: https://t.co/3NLcYyI032
8/ The identification of the narrator began with the work of @AmarAmarasingam, a Toronto researcher who first noticed Mohammed Khalifa‚Äôs Canadian accent. Then a few months ago, he and @StewGlobal interviewed another Canadian detainee in Syria, who said he knew the narrator
7/ You can listen and compare yourself. @HKaaman took the time to line up clips from Flames of War with clips of the recently captured fighter: https://t.co/M6V0sI6Ssg
6/And at the University of Colorado, a pair of researchers who also do work for law enforcement, Catalin Grigoras and Jeff Smith, gave the match a probability ratio. The detainee is 134x more likely to be the narrator than not: https://t.co/kV7lt9xBr9
5/ At the University of Montana, Professor Rob Maher compared his utterance of specific words like ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù comparing the prononciation in the ISIS video to how he sounds now using a spectrogram. He concluded the detainee is the narrator: https://t.co/CKblImEyLF
@PatrickDibert @nytimes Thank you Patrick
@_sHx_ @leloveluck He asked for it not to be shown.
4/ He reluctantly confessed to being the infamous narrator. Initially, he tried to pass himself off as just a low-level translator for ISIS‚Äô media ministry. To make sure he wasn‚Äôt lying, @nytimes called on not one - but three - audio forensic experts to analyze his voice: https://t.co/C1kVLjq2FC
@JoeWSJ Many thanks, Joe
3/ That same narrator would go on to narrate the most important English-language releases by ISIS, from its daily radio show, to an audio boasting about the Paris attacks. He was captured last month and @ivorprickett and I were  the first to interview him: https://t.co/BL2z1dtsNF
2/ Immediately, there was interest in the narrator of the video, which shows prisoners forced to dig their own graves before being shot in the head. He sounded North American. The FBI even put out a call to the public asking for help identifying him: https://t.co/Bnr7CwxNU6
1/Good morning everyone, early on the Islamic State stood out from every jihadist group that had come before in part due to the Hollywood-esque propaganda videos it put out. One of the most famous is ‚ÄúFlames of War,‚Äù published in late 2014, narrated by an English speaker.

13. The old man told me he thought Baghdadi was the "true caliph of all Muslims." He spoke for 15 min before stopping, realizing how this might sound vis-a-vis his attitude towards ISIS. Then he started crying. "Please," he said, "I've lost my family. Don't use this against me."
@SkinnerPm @ivorprickett Thank you, Patrick.
12. Today, I interviewed an old man and his adult and son, who lost 20 members of their family in an airstrike last month. Their faces were burned. They were Iraqi from Anbar, and they swore they were not with ISIS. Then I asked what they thought about Baghdadi? https://t.co/0OESLngbZ4
11. A woman in her early 20s died from a head wound sustained in an explosion soon after she arrived. They buried her at the edge of the field, where her grave was dug by members of the Coalition-backed militia. They held up their palms in a 5-second prayer: https://t.co/RyePEcqBPh
10. These are ISIS families who put their children in harm‚Äôs way to follow the group. It was still hard to see the suffering. A 6-year old boy was rushed to a medic station as his pulse gave out, his body straining under multiple mortar injuries, photographed by @ivorprickett: https://t.co/gbwReDjJHE
9. Germans, French, Turks, Russians, Canadians, Azerbaijanis, Kazakhs &amp; others have streamed out. These are some of the longest-serving citizens of the caliphate, joining in 2014, hopscotching from town to town as the group lost land. Buses came to take them to a detention camp: https://t.co/2KUseAEeDh
8. Dure said that inside the ISIS pocket, they had almost completely run out of food. She had no pampers for her toddler and talked about cutting up a sweater to create a diaper. Other women spoke of boiling this weed which grows between houses and forcing themselves to eat it: https://t.co/qbyu4QNS9H
7. The number of overseas recruits to ISIS coming out of this pocket is stunning. This 28-year old woman, mom of two toddlers, said she was from the Lawrence Heights area of Toronto. She said her name was Dure Ahmed. She came out with a 34-year old Canadian woman from Alberta: https://t.co/9QQnEsfvOU
6. But watching from a distance, we saw that the men are told to approach US forces single file, arms in the air. Jackets come off. Turbans are searched. One day there was a sniffer dog. They‚Äôre fingerprinted, photographed, questioned. Some are taken to prison. Most go to a camp
5. When the trucks arrive, the American-backed Kurdish militia separates men from women. Next they‚Äôre made to sit in separate areas, based on nationality. American troops arrive by mid-morning and begin screening the men first. We were not allowed to photograph US troops. https://t.co/8fDANmRnPi
4. Kurdish forces told us that this is a sign that the escapees are nearly all linked to ISIS. Why would you move from say Turkey or Iraq into the crosshairs of a town controlled by the Islamic State and face Coalition bombings, unless you are a willing citizen of the caliphate?
3. We were at the arrival point and saw pickup trucks arrive with the escapees in the back. We‚Äôve seen between 150 and 200 people be processed. What‚Äôs striking is we couldn‚Äôt find a single person that is actually from Baghuz. They are nearly all from somewhere else. https://t.co/IjNyKHrELd
2. The frontline is roughly 10 km away in a village called Baghuz, where ISIS now controls an area the size of Central Park. For the last two weeks, thousands of people have been streaming out of this last slice of the caliphate in Syria, arriving at the place marked below: https://t.co/x6pxyvtT7j

@nyonwu @MrAyeDee The Pentagon Inspector General released a report a few months ago estimating the number of ISIS members in Iraq and Syria as being close to 30,000.
@nyonwu @MrAyeDee Kelechi, the last time the US pulled out in 2011, the group was down to 700 fighters in Iraq. Now they have between 20,000 and 30,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria. If local partners were not able to handle 700 fighters then, why would they be able to handle 20 to 30x that now?

@boerneaj ISIS has claimed it in a bulletin put out by their Amaq News Agency (and no, they don't claim everything).
5. This is at least the 6th major counterattack by ISIS in Syria in recent weeks, according to a US official. A leader of the American-backed Kurdish militia battling ISIS in Syria put it in hyperbolic terms in a DM to me: "All I know is that IS attacks like 3727638 times a day."
4. Not only is the group not defeated (three separate reports by the Pentagon Inspector General, by @UN &amp; by @CSIS estimate that ISIS still has between 20,000 and 30,000 fighters just in Iraq and Syria - but there is data to suggest the group has become emboldened in recent weeks
4. Not only is the group not defeated (three separate reports estimated that the terrorist group still has been 20,000 and 30,000 members just in Iraq and Syria) but there is data to indicate that ISIS has been emboldened by Trump's pullout announcement.
3. The attack - which officials are telling me may well be the single largest casualty event in combat for American forces in the fight against ISIS - comes as Vice President Mike Pence again describes ISIS as defeated: https://t.co/FRxkvTsLoA
2. According to one current and one retired US official I spoke to who are in direct contact with commanders on the ground, 4 Americans died: 3 were US service members; the 4th is a civilian accompanying them, whom I'm told is an interpreter. 3 more service members are wounded

10. The boy‚Äôs sister meanwhile is distraught and doesn‚Äôt even know which government or body to approach to try to ask for her teenage brother‚Äôs extradition. While the boy has been caught, there is no further news from the mom. Our story: https://t.co/xmin2oBZ74
9. And three different US officials including at the Pentagon &amp; at the State Department told @EricSchmittNYT and I that the teenager captured by the Kurds is *not* American. (They could not confirm his real nationality). But to date the SDF is maintaining that the boy is American
8. Meanwhile, I reached out to Dartmouth University computer forensic expert Hany Farid who used facial recognition software to confirm with a ‚Äúhigh degree‚Äù of confidence that the boy in the SDF mugshot is the Trinidadian teenager, as identified in photos vetted by his sister.
7. It wasn‚Äôt until last month that her mom Gailon Su reached out on Facebook messenger. She sent her daughter a series of voicemails begging for money, saying she and her son needed help to get out of Syria. One of the recordings is embedded in our story: https://t.co/xmin2oBZ74
6. The sister explained to me that her little brother Su-lay (correct spelling has a hyphen) and her mom converted to Islam in Trinidad under the spell of Anthony Hamlet. Then in 2014, they disappeared. She filed a police report but for the next 4 years she had no news from them.
5. Online, we found social media accounts for a Sulay Su &amp; a Gailon Su, and I wrote messages to their friends in their profiles that had open accounts. Eventually, Su-lay Su‚Äôs (correct spelling) older sister called me. She confirmed her brother was indeed teen in the SDF mugshot https://t.co/zYPitASaJe
4. According to Cottee‚Äôs database, a Sulay Su left for Syria in 2014 when he was 12 with his mother Gailon Su. Mom had been radicalized by a man she was involved with: Anthony Hamlet, who appeared in ISIS propaganda, including the group‚Äôs magazine Dabiq and in a recruitment video https://t.co/gyK1H2b1b1
3. But within hours of the SDF releasing their press release, claiming the teen is American, University of Kent scholar Simon Cottee, who is at work on a book about jihadists from Trinidad, found a similar name to Soulay Noah Su in his database of 130 Trinidadians who joined ISIS
2. If he was indeed American, the teenager would be the first minor caught fighting on behalf of the terror group overseas, as @SeamusHughes explains here: https://t.co/KZnX5qUMXQ

10. To make sure that the Zaid picked up by the SDF and the one in his database (and the ISIS video) are one and the same, Simon Cottee sent the mugshot below to multiple people who knew him back in Trinidad. They all said it‚Äôs the same guy. https://t.co/MMC1aZ80op
9. I wish I could claim that sleuthing work was mine. It‚Äôs the work of academic Simon Cottee, who is working on a book about foreign fighters from Trinidad. Zaid appears in a database he maintains of ISIS recruits from Trinidad, and he joined ISIS in April of 2014.
8. Starting at the 3-minute mark, you will see this gentleman who identifies himself as ‚ÄúZaid‚Äù from Trinidad. He appears alongside his three children. Compare the mugshot and my stills: https://t.co/GBrnBwPxNl
7. Usually, ISIS fighters act as ‚Äúreferences‚Äù for other fighters coming from the same geographic zone. So why would an American be acting as a reference for a recruit from a Caribbean nation? Remember his mugshot (above) and check out this ISIS video: https://t.co/rsfzFg2Yie
6. Zaid‚Äôs name appears on a cache of internal ISIS registration forms obtained by my colleague @KaramShoumali. In those forms, he appears as a reference for a new recruit arriving in the caliphate in 2014 from Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Here is his mugshot: https://t.co/HQiEFW2i82
5. A second ISIS fighter caught in the same raid in northern Syria by the SDF is also described as a US citizen. The press release says that Zaid al-Hamid is ‚Äúoriginally from the US.‚Äù However, I‚Äôm starting to have doubts about that: https://t.co/pdIF8Mz1kh https://t.co/FOO68tsCvT
4. This is the mugshot of Clark that the Syrian Democratic Forces released today. According to interviews conducted by @SeamusHughes with Clark‚Äôs friends back in Texas he was so extreme in the things he said that buddies thought he might be an FBI agent trying to entrap others https://t.co/MoOS5zVaRz
3. The letter begins: "Dear Director, I'm looking to get a position teaching English to students in the Islamic State. ... I believe a successful teacher can understand students strengths &amp; weaknesses &amp; is able to use that understanding to help students build on their knowledge." https://t.co/Pisdfj3Ewp
2. Warren Christopher Clark, the 34-year-old American captured in Syria, is originally from Houston where he worked as a substitute teacher at a school district in Sugar Land. Here is the CV and cover letter he sent to ISIS, which was discovered by @SeamusHughes of @gwupoe: https://t.co/Rlmhofozum
1. In Syria today, five ISIS fighters were captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces. Among them was at least one American, who years ago had (no joke) sent his resume and a cover letter to the the Islamic State requesting a job teaching English: https://t.co/wtt35ljV9T

@GhassanDahhan @LinaArabii @deSyracuse Ghassan, at its height, ISIS ruled a population of between 9 and 12 million people. Abu Kamal is barely 42,000. Please add up the territory liberated by non-Coalition forces and you will see it‚Äôs a drop in the proverbial bucket. (And a very happy New Year to you as well).
@GhassanDahhan @LinaArabii @deSyracuse The question is regarding whether or not the majority of ISIS-held towns were liberated by the Coalition, or not. And the answer is a resounding yes. (Abu Kamal and Mayadin etc = tiny compared to, say, Mosul with 1 million people).
@JohnArterbury @Syrianator @ornekali Not to mention Raqqa, Hasakah, Sinjar, Fallujah, Ramadi, Tal Afar, al-Qaim, Hawidja ... (and I‚Äôm getting bored making this list).

@Publius_Aguila @brett_mcgurk How does the average American benefit from the containment of a terrorist group that is hellbent on killing Americans? I dunno. You tell me.
13. In a Tweet today, Trump reiterated that he considers ISIS defeated even though the group still has 20,000 to 30,000 fighters just in Iraq &amp; Syria. He suggested Turkey could mop up what's left. Seems unrealistic given how reluctant Turkey was to get involved in the first place https://t.co/tKDLztDDbv
12. Days before Trump announced the drawdown, @brett_mcgurk reassured colleagues that America was in it for the long haul. He then had to call our Kurdish allies - the very people who died by the 1000s in this fight - to tell them that the U.S. was reneging on its promise. https://t.co/uLtn6tqiY0
11. Compare that to how many American soldiers died during the Iraq war - over 300 per year in the first 13 years of that conflict. The key in the Obama administration's approach to the war on ISIS was helping prop up local partners, who did the bulk of the ground invasion
10. Because of that alliance, the campaign in Syria has been low cost for the United States, both in terms of money spent &amp; lives lost. While four American soldiers were killed there in the 3+ years since our involvement, officials estimate that the Kurds buried 10,000 of theirs https://t.co/Q1c8INPcph
9. It was McGurk's team that first convinced Turkey to allow a US airdrop to the Kurds during the siege of Kobane in 2014 and the opening of a land bridge so that the Kurds could resupply. Eventually, the US was able to broker an alliance with the Kurds, despite Turkish pushback https://t.co/jQSxIRJeRT
8. Among the most difficult pieces to get right in the battle against ISIS was finding a reliable partner in Syria, able to wage a ground war against the terror group. It became clear early on that only a Kurdish militia had the capacity to do it. But then Turkey got in the way: https://t.co/sismFbwMXQ
7. Our full story on @brett_mcgurk's resignation. He is credited with stitching together the multi-ethnic and multi-national, 79-member coalition which launched the war against ISIS. This was anything but easy, as the former director of the NTCT attests: 		https://t.co/1IDWJrQebB https://t.co/X4E4loFKR3
@vermiciouskid @realDonaldTrump Indeed he was.
6. Apparently I tagged the wrong Brett McGurk. Correct address is @brett_mcgurk
@jrussell20941 @kimsulik No.
@xCoffinKidx Because it's my job to do so.
Actually when @realDonaldTrump became president, half the territorial caliphate had been wiped out under a policy begun by the Obama administration. Hard part was brokering the alliances that created the mosaic of local armed groups, which did the heavy lifting of battling ISIS https://t.co/mZezjLBgYM
@annahcav I would never do that.
5. @BrettMcGurk was due to leave in February. It‚Äôs significant that he accelerated his departure by two months, in light of the events that just occurred.
4. @BrettMcGurk was considered by many to be the glue holding together the sprawling, 79-nation coalition battling ISIS. A veteran of 3 administrations, he was a rare holdover from the Obama White House, a sign of the crucial role he played in helping mount the war against ISIS
3. ‚Äú.... I worked this week to help manage some of the fallout but ‚Äî as many of you heard in my meetings and phone calls ‚Äî I ultimately concluded that I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity,‚Äù he said.
2. In an email that brought his staff to tears, McGurk said: ‚ÄúThe recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us. It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered....‚Äù
1. Days after Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigns, Brett McGurk, the top diplomat leading the fight against ISIS, turns in his resignation letter, saying he cannot carry out Trump‚Äôs policy of withdrawing from Syria. https://t.co/1IDWJrQebB

@accountable_gov Not Morocco as a whole. The Atlas Mountains. And embassies have already issued travel advisories warning against travel there.
@geoffdporter 2/ You‚Äôre talking after all to someone who spent months in Timbuktu &amp; in Mali‚Äôs so called ‚Äúred zone.‚Äù Sure you can go. But can you go there with the same carefree spirit as before? No. And any tourists that does go and gets harmed will be considered as having acted recklessly
@geoffdporter 1/ A few months ago, 4 tourists were killed in Tajikistan by ISIS - first ever attack on foreigners there. State Department immediately changed the security rating for the entire country, just as travel advisories have now been issued for Morocco. Can you still go there? Sure.
@KatCapps I stupidly assumed the Atlas Mountains would always be within reach. And although I passed through Morocco numerous times during the 7 years I was in Africa, I never took the time to do the beautiful trek. How I regret that.
@AdamHoffm @realDonaldTrump So true
7. As someone who spent 7 years posted in West Africa, I find it disturbing to see how every year, the map of where Westerners can safely venture continues to shrink as a result of groups like ISIS &amp; al-Qaeda. Until this incident, the gorgeous Atlas Mountains were considered safe https://t.co/jgDBulz1H4
6. ISIS has not claimed the murder but the group typically doesn't claim attacks when their followers are in custody. So we may never have an official claim. At a minimum, the European officials I am speaking to consider this an attack inspired by the group.
5. In Morocco, another 9 suspects believed to be tied to the killings have been arrested. Four others were arrested earlier this week, men that the Moroccan prosecutor said had recorded an ISIS pledge video a week before the murder. If all are guilty, it's a cell of 13 people: https://t.co/0rxwfg49r5
4. If you've never heard of Hajin, pls join the line. Until a few days ago, the small town in northern Syria was under ISIS control. It's the last place our Kurdish allies backed by US forces, were fighting ISIS before the White House's abrupt decision to pull troops out of Syria https://t.co/ont6uukn0v
3. In the video, a man is standing above one of the women, pinning her down with his foot placed on her face. He uses a kitchen knife to decapitate her. In the audio, as translated by my colleague @AidaAlami, the killer is heard talking about how this is revenge for Hajin.
2. The bodies of the tourists - 24-year-old Louisa Jespersen of Denmark &amp; 28-year-old Maren Ueland of Norway - were found at the head of a trail in Morocco's Atlas Mountains. I watched the horrific video and it's hard to even find words to describe the brutality it contained. https://t.co/9VyGccBL1V
1. On the topic of the "defeat" of ISIS: Today, the Norwegian government confirmed the authenticity of a brutal execution video showing a man decapitating a Scandinavian tourist in Morocco. The men who killed the tourists pledged allegiance to ISIS: https://t.co/OfvExLAzkf
@JackDetsch_ALM No worries!
@Bugs_Meany @realDonaldTrump Three separate reports including by the Pentagon Inspector General, the UN and @CSIS estimate that ISIS has between 20,000 &amp; 30,000 fighters *just* in Iraq and Syria. That‚Äôs not counting the 1000s more in Afghanistan, the Sinai, Libya, W Africa, Philippines etc. Have a great day!
@deserthawkred @nibrtv2 @realDonaldTrump Between 20k and 30k are distributed between Iraq and Syria according to three separate reports.
@JackDetsch_ALM Kindly listen to the clip I just posted. Sanders says 99% of ISIS has been defeated. Very different from saying 99% of territory has been rolled back.
The White House Press Secretary tells Fox that @realDonaldTrump has wiped out ‚Äú99% of ISIS‚Äù in Iraq and Syria. Nope. The Coalition has removed 99% of the *territory* ISIS controlled in Iraq and Syria. The group is estimated to still have up to 30,000 fighters, an enormous number https://t.co/glTZEAGMNM

7. ISIS doesn't usually claim attacks when their guys are in handcuffs, so we may never see an ISIS claim. It remains odd that the attackers, who recorded the pledge video a week before the attack, appear to know all the ISIS lingo, but don't seem to be in touch with ISIS online.
6. But here is a concerning development: A European official close to the investigation confirmed that the beheading video was sent by private messenger to friends of the killed Danish woman by unknown senders who appeared to have Moroccan profiles. Police is investigating.
5. During the slaughter, you hear the man talking about Hajin, the last town in Syria that until a few days ago was under ISIS control, and has been the scene of intense Coalition bombing. Danish officials say they are still trying to ascertain the authenticity of this video
4. When I hear these terms, I know that the people involved have - at a minimum - spent time soaking in ISIS' propaganda, because that's how ISIS talks. More disturbing is a video showing a young woman being decapitated. Her face is pinned down under the foot of her attacker.
3. Here is what I learned from sources today: In the pledge video, you hear the men vowing fealty to "emir al-mumineem," the emir of the believers, the term ISIS members use to refer Baghdadi. They also say they cannot "sit on the sidelines" while "Crusader planes" bomb people
2. ISIS has not as yet claimed the attack &amp; the pledge video screengrabbed here was not distributed on ISIS' channels on Telegram, suggesting the men had no online connection to the terrorist group. But Denmark is calling the killings terrorism &amp; 1 of the 4 has ties to extremists https://t.co/KlXiKrmMAn
1. Apropos of ISIS being gone: In Morocco on Monday, the bodies of two tourists were found.

@__LivinTheDream Thank you, Ian.
@Kira_Media The Kurds. who are the ones fighting ISIS, have been unable to move an inch without US aerial and logistical support. And even with that support, ISIS has succeeded in repeatedly mounting counterattacks &amp; taking back territory that was declared freed.
13. For more, please tune in to @AliVelshi on @MSNBC who took the time to speak to me about ISIS this afternoon. I‚Äôll also be joining Rachel Maddow at around 9:20 pm EST tonight for a longer conversation: https://t.co/DKYMMVBSEq
12. Western Coalition officials fighting ISIS in Syria whom I reached out to today described the president‚Äôs Tweet as ‚Äúreckless,‚Äù ‚Äúa disaster‚Äù and ‚Äúcatastrophic.‚Äù The big winner? ISIS, they say, which can now breathe a sigh of relief and begin rebuilding as it did in 2010
11. Speaking of ISIS being defeated, I was recently in Iraq in the village where Baghdadi was born. It was considered too dangerous to go without a military escort. The soldiers were clearly freaked out &amp; once we got there, they let us stay for only 10 mins, fearing an ambush
10. Another metric analysts look at is the freqency of attacks. And a @CTCWP analysis of the number of attacks just in Iraq in the first 10 months of this year counted over 1,200 hits by ISIS. The group was declared ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù in Iraq (just like in Syria) by Prime Minister Abadi
9. Coalition officials say these numbers are inflated. Interestingly, two other reports by the UN and CSIS independently came up with roughly the same estimation. If these three reports are right, ISIS has 20 to 30 times the # of fighters it had last time it was declared defeated
8. In 2010, the last time the group was considered vanquished they had almost no land and 700 fighters. Today, they have an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 fighters just in Iraq and Syria, according to the Pentagon‚Äôs Inspector General: https://t.co/kvgJaEsk6g
7. With Hajin gone, ISIS has lost all but 1% of the enormous territory they once held. Looks like they‚Äôve been defeated yeah? Sadly territorial control is only one metric by which analysts measure the strength of the group. And according to the other metrics, ISIS remains a force
6. A few days ago, our Kurdish allies succeeded in penetrating the town of Hajin, the last city under ISIS control in Syria. The Kurds have been waging a battle to take this tiny town of 30,000 people since September. My sources on the ground said that they now hold 70% of Hajin.
5. My point is this: A force estimated to be no larger than 700 militants succeeded in rising from the ashes and launching what became the world‚Äôs largest, richest &amp; most dangerous terrorist group. That was the *last* time our leaders declared this group defeated. What about now?
4. Who was that leader? None other than Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. By 2014, his army had blitzkrieged across the region, seizing at its height 1/2 of Syria and 1/3rd of Iraq, an area the size of Great Britain. By 2016, the bounty on his head was at $25 million: https://t.co/2pSp2t1PP5
3. The group was considered such a weakened force that in one 90-day stretch in 2010, the Pentagon was confident they had killed 34 of the group‚Äôs top 42 leaders. The State Department went so far as to *drop* the bounty on the head of the group‚Äôs chief from $5 million to $100,000 https://t.co/MATDvGryGr
2. The Islamic State, which went through several name changes, first implanted itself in Iraq 15 years ago. Enormously destructive at first, the tide began to change and by 2010, when American forces began to pull out, the group was estimated to be down to just 700 fighter: https://t.co/9l4cuewb94
1. Today, President Trump declared ISIS ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù in Syria and signaled that he might begin the drawdown of American troops stationed there. Follow along for a walk down memory lane, starting with the last time ISIS was declared vanquished. https://t.co/y3wD94h6ng

Were you under the impression that territorial control is the only factor that defines ISIS‚Äô strength? (Clue: From 2004 to 2013, group‚Äôs predecessor held almost no land &amp; yet killed 1000s)
@Mesoy640 @CSIS You‚Äôll have to read each individual report. Methodologies vary, and critics have pointed to this as a problem. But no matter what the # of fighters now vs what existed in 2010 (when last pullout began) is far higher.

@elmosquito12631 In the same prison where James Foley and the other Americans were held, a Swedish hostage was also imprisoned. He was lucky enough to get out after the intervention of either his country or employer - allegedly for a ransom. So, yeah, apples and apples. https://t.co/0tgpfuE2Kk

@borisgwriter The main trend is 1. They don‚Äôt claim if their guy is in handcuffs or on the run (exceptions apply - this is a general observation); 2. They are cautious about claiming attacks in majority Sunni countries, if the attack killed Sunni civilians.
@DavidVidecette @pjdunne247 Sincere thanks, David
13. I‚Äôll end with Exhibit A: The Jewish  Museum attack in 2014, at that point one of the most deadly terror attacks in Belgium. Never claimed by ISIS. The gunman? Mehdi Nemmouche, who joined ISIS in Syria, and at one point served as one of the jailers of ISIS‚Äô Western hostages https://t.co/Gt2UZdRgqx
12. There have been several notable exceptions - with Las Vegas probably being the biggest of their f... ups - but for every wrongly claimed ISIS attack, I can point to numerous attacks which we know for sure were carried out by actual ISIS members &amp; which they never claimed.
11. What stands out is ISIS‚Äô success using this mode of attack, which poses almost no risk to the core organization since there are no communications breadcrumbs for authorities to follow. To date, *most* of the attacks they‚Äôve claimed in the West were indeed by ppl they inspired
10. Folks then wonder, we‚Äôll isn‚Äôt that cheating? How can they really know if they have no inside knowledge? Imagine you‚Äôre a terror group and you are trying to remotely inspire acts of slaughter, then by definition you don‚Äôt have contact with the attacker.
9. The other thing people get their panties all knotted up about is the mode by which ISIS confirms some of these attacks. Did they learn of the shooter from media reports (meaning from the work of my colleagues &amp; I?). In the case of ISIS inspired attacks, the answer is often yes
8. Now let‚Äôs look at the timing: Two days after the attack. Why? I don‚Äôt know for sure, but this is a pattern we‚Äôve seen. The group doesn‚Äôt tend to claim attacks when their boy is on the run, or when he‚Äôs in handcuffs (though there have been exceptions).
7. .... and you‚Äôll see the enormous effort the group puts into inciting hate and violence among its followers. Some of the most deadly ISIS attacks to date (Nice, Orlando) were carried out by people who merely imbibed the group‚Äôs message online.
6. People always get confused about inspired ISIS attacks. How can we really say it‚Äôs ISIS if these guys had no actual contact with the group? What folks are missing is that the inspired attack is a deliberate *strategy* of the Islamic State. Spend 1 day on their channels...
5. In that speech, Adnani argued that you don‚Äôt have to have joined the group  to do its bidding. He called on their global base of supporters to carry out attacks in any way they could - with a gun, a knife, a car, even a rock, and to do so without seeking their guidance
4. That speech was delivered by this guy: Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, on paper ISIS‚Äô spokesman. But as our reporting has shown he was also the head of ISIS‚Äô external operations arm, in charge of mounting attacks in the West. And in 2014 he made an appeal to ISIS followers worldwide https://t.co/RDXZpjR0q4
3. Crucially, the claim uses phrasing that indicates this was an inspired attack, rather than one directed by the group from Iraq and Syria. Gunman is said to be ‚Äúresponding to calls to target nationals of Coalition countries.‚Äù That‚Äôs verbatim language from a famous ISIS speech https://t.co/9UXVv7xI0A
2. Some clues we can glean from the language they used: The shooter, who‚Äôs been on the lam for the last 2 days, is described as a ‚Äúsoldier of the Islamic State‚Äù (the terminology the group uses both for dyed-in-the-wool ISIS members in Syria &amp; for those who act in their name) https://t.co/MJDYOTmLYR

@Adam_Bachaa We‚Äôve known that for a long time &amp; it doesn‚Äôt make the claim opportunistic. Inspired attacks are part &amp; parcel of ISIS‚Äô external attacks strategy, dating back to earliest caliphate speeches by Adnani. Point is: Did person carry out violence in ISIS‚Äô name? If so = legitimate claim
15. According to @leparisien, gunman allowed cab driver to live only after latter professed that he was a practicing Muslim and observed his daily prayers. French media is reporting that we haven‚Äôt seen a manhunt like this since Saleh Abdeslam slipped the net during Paris attack.
14. Le Parisien has intriguing new details which, if confirmed, place the gunman‚Äôs actions in alignment with ISIS: Victims were shot in the head and several were stabbed; After hijaking a taxi, gunman told driver he was doing this to ‚Äúavenge‚Äù his ‚Äúbrothers killed in Syria.‚Äù https://t.co/TSIje3ObTk
@RitaPanahi Thank you, Rita
@paulwornham @MickiMaynard As Micheline rightly pointed out I had no role in picking the photo. Nor was it shot by a @nytimes photographer. Rather it‚Äôs a wire photo. But as the caption indicates, it shows a patrol of the market that was targeted in the attack - so it seems perfectly relevant.
13. And in the last 24 hours, ISIS acolytes have created memes and video tributes, like this one, which begins with a ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù sign written in red letters that then begins to bleed. I agree with French president when he said that the terror threat remains all too real: https://t.co/OPqnA06M6P
12. In ISIS‚Äô ecosystem online, in the Telegram chatrooms run by their supporters, there was plenty of rah-rah cheering yesterday, with some sympathizers changing their profile picture to the shooter‚Äôs mugshot: https://t.co/98kge6mEXZ
11. Why hasn‚Äôt ISIS or al-Qaeda claimed it? Contrary to popular perception, these groups - in general - don‚Äôt claim attacks opportunistically. While there have been exceptions, ISIS typically doesn‚Äôt claim an attack when their guy is on the lam, or in handcuffs
10. In the absence of a claim from a terrorist group &amp; with the gunman still on the lam, it‚Äôs hard to know which group is behind this attack - if any. Or conversely if the attacker was an online sympathizer who responded to ISIS‚Äô call to hit Christmas-related events.
9. But the history of this market as a jihadi target stretches back to at least 17 years ago, when a complex al-Qaeda plot led by a cell of men that had trained in Afghanistan attempted to hit the location. A book chapter on the plot by the erudite Lorenzo Vidino of @gwupoe: https://t.co/2DFlzrXsQ4
8. The extent of planning in that plot, and the fact that it was being directed by ISIS from Syria, prompted our own State Department to issue a travel alert warning Americans that both ISIS and al-Qaeda may be plotting to target holiday-related events in Europe: https://t.co/MuDK0KCd6u
7. Only 2 years ago, a cell that was in direct contact with ISIS‚Äô external operations in arm in Syria plotted to attack the market, one of the oldest Christmas markets in Europe dating to the 1500s. Police were able to intercept their comms and foiled the plot.
6. Among the known ISIS recruits from this cluster? One of the suicide bombers dispatched to the Bataclan during the Nov 13, 2015 Paris attack.	With this sizeable cluster in the Strasbourg area, it‚Äôs no surprise that the famous market has been targeted before and not by amateurs
5. When you study recruitment by groups like ISIS, one thing we‚Äôve come to expect are ‚Äúclusters.‚Äù Some parts of France have sent 0 recruits to the Islamic State. Others have sent 100s. Makes sense given that recruitment is far more effective when the call is from someone you know
4. Here‚Äôs one interesting takeaway: There are over 20,000 names in this database of radicalized individuals in France alone. According to @JcBrisard, some 10% of them live in the provincial department where the Strasbourg Christmas market is located. Or some 2,000 ppl.
3. What‚Äôs the FSPRT database? Created in 2015, the database flags extremists whose ‚Äúradicalization has a terrorist dimension.‚Äù The fact that Chekatt appears on this list confirms that he is believed to be a radicalized Muslim, says @JcBrisard https://t.co/HTW45W72Xd
2. Hours after the attack yesterday, before officials labeled it an act of terror, experts like @JcBrisard already knew a key detail: The gunman named Cherif Chekatt appeared not just on France‚Äôs S List of people believed to pose a security threat but also on its FSPRT list. https://t.co/PfIlOrUqmF
1. France has declared the shooting yesterday in one of the country‚Äôs most iconic Christmas markets an act of terrorism. The gunman is on the run &amp; the subject of a massive manhunt. Follow along for some thoughts on the market‚Äôs place in jihadi targetting. https://t.co/J0YHzrw5Cu

@Academy911 @CSIS @EricSchmittNYT Agreed.
@sounddude18 I might agree with you, if there was an alternative that worked. So far no one has figured out how to defeat this enemy.
@CAugustElliott It‚Äôs online propaganda that turned an al-Qaeda idea (attacks carried out by Lone Wolves with no meaningful contact with the terror group) into a worldwide operational success for ISIS. So I would say it‚Äôs pretty significant.
@MrAyeDee Unfortunately it appears to be hieroglyphics to politicians who have repeatedly declared ‚ÄúMission accomplished.‚Äù
@sounddude18 Airstrikes kill civilians - lots of them - despite best efforts to avoid collateral. And in order to even find the target, you need spotters on the ground, hence ground war. So they have been mutually exclusive, at least so far.
@laseptiemewilay There are *far* more attacks now than -pre-9/11. The difference is that the majority of victims are now in poor countries like Nigeria, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, hence you haven‚Äôt noticed.
@sounddude18 Therein lies the puzzle of the war on terror: Yes, airstrikes and US-led wars have been fodder for recruitment. But *not* targeting people like Osama Bin Laden, Muhammad al-Adnani, Awlaki etc when they repeatedly plotted attacks in the West also doesn‚Äôt seem like a great idea.
The depressing reality of my beat: A new ‚Å¶@CSIS‚Å© study concludes that there are far more jihadists now than on the eve of 9/11, as ‚Å¶@EricSchmittNYT‚Å© reports. https://t.co/NPB0m8Xh23

@mariamaelba There‚Äôs no need for aspersions, Mariam. I never said they don‚Äôt deserve to be treated. Only that there is no treatment program currently available for them in either Europe or N America. And that is not a small consideration in light of what ISIS tried to teach its 2nd generation

@AmarAmarasingam @amhitchens @Louisaudetg I would have believed that. Then I saw a 10-year old Yazidi boy, kidnapped by ISIS for less than a year, trying to behead his stuffed animal. Hitting his non-Muslim parents when they failed to pray. His own mother was scared of him. I think you are underestimating the problem
@AmarAmarasingam @amhitchens @Louisaudetg *Civilians* kept their kids home. Every interview I did with schoolteachers in Iraq indicated that ISIS fighters sent their children to ISIS schools, which doubled as training facilities.
@AmarAmarasingam @amhitchens @Louisaudetg While I am an optimist at heart, I question whether a child psychologist could fix this problem given that we haven‚Äôt even been able to devise CVE and deradicalization programs that are empirically proven to work for adults (who are easier to communicate with than a 5y old).
@amhitchens @Louisaudetg I agree with that assessment but I don‚Äôt think that any such program currently exists in Europe. So what do we do?
@Louisaudetg @amhitchens Is there a single such program in Europe? We‚Äôre not talking about repatriating kids to Liberia or Sierra Leone. If not, is someone going to set this up?

RT @mikiebarb: If you work at Fox, and consider yourself a journalist,  my lord. https://t.co/xHBpGHhPHf

@smdadamo Thank you, Sarah
@james_e_baldwin I wondered the same. But experts explained that every piece of evidence needs to be deemed acceptable in court and a big part of that is determining chain of custody. Meaning can someone prove they were present when he filled out his form? No? Then how do we know it‚Äôs real?
@ayshaseedat My colleague @charlie_savage is the expert, but what my sources explained is that it‚Äôs a chain of custody issue. How do you prove that that form (which the NYT &amp; others obtained as an electronic file from sources) was really the form that he filled out? Did anyone see him do so?
7/ We are bound to see more of these third-country arrangements as Western countries grapple with what to do with their citizens imprisoned in Iraq &amp; Syria. Having good reason to believe someone joined ISIS and being able to prove it in a free &amp; fair trial are 2 different things
6/ Bahrain is where his wife and daughter live and just this week, he was released in Bahrain. His name on the ISIS application was discovered by @KaramShoumali, and the story was reported with @charlie_savage and @EricSchmittNYT
5/ A monthslong negotiation ensued. First the US suggested sending him to Saudi because he is a dual Saudi-American national. Via his lawyers at the ACLU, Alsheikh rejected that option. Then my colleague @charlie_savage learned that a transfer was being considered to Bahrain
4/ John Doe is a case in point: We found his ISIS application form from 2014. It listed the same phone number that he had on him at moment of his capture in 2017. In his possession when was caught was a USB stick full of ISIS documents. But he wasn‚Äôt properly Mirandized.
3/ Western countries including Canada &amp; UK are struggling with what to do with their captured citizens who fought for ISIS, now languishing in Syrian &amp; Iraqi jails. Conundrum is that it‚Äôs really hard to collect evidence that‚Äôs permissible in court in area once controlled by ISIS
2/ The case against him fell apart as US officials worried that the evidence they had against him - including his ISIS application form - would not be acceptable in court. Next came months of negotiations on where to send him? They did not want him coming back to the US.
1/For more than a year, an American ISIS suspect has been held after being captured in Syria. To the world, he was known as John Doe. Using the forms ISIS left behind, we figured out his real name: A Baton Rouge resident named Abdulrahman Ahmad Alsheikh https://t.co/tUH2EngAVu

@AymanM @marypgkeating 2. The Pulse attack (like the ones in recent days) also occurred in the shadow of an election. My colleagues and I FOIA‚Äôed the 911 call. Do you not find it odd that the initial release we received from DOJ redacted references to Baghdadi and the Islamic State?
@AymanM @marypgkeating 1. Ayman, the ISIS era has made clear that radicalization can occur in a period of months. What Mateen said years ago in a period when ISIS didn‚Äôt exist as an entity separate from AQ is of little relevance when inside Pulse he repeatedly &amp; emphatically expressed support for ISIS
@AymanM @marypgkeating You‚Äôre pretty much describing the Obama administration‚Äôs reaction to Omar Mateen‚Äôs mass slaughter in an Orlando nightclub.

@hahellyer @MichaelSSmithII No need for us to trade barbs. My only point is there‚Äôs a difference between radicalization and publicity. Mainstream media provides exposure but I have yet to see empirical evidence of this correlating to radicalization. Recruitment = private chatrooms. Not via ‚Äúkuffar media‚Äù
@hahellyer It‚Äôs really not. Once again: Can you point to a single jihadist - just one - who affirms he became radicalized via mainstream media?

@hahellyer @meralhece I doubt it my friend.

9. Truly honored to have been invited to the @PrixBayeux this year as a finalist and to have won ‚ÄúLe 3ieme Prix‚Äù in print for our project ‚ÄúThe ISIS Files.‚Äù In this age of recriminations, Bayeux leads the way in reminding us of the real values of this profession. https://t.co/RhYE5d3KRW
9. The auditorium where the prizes were awarded was filled with some 1500 people, most of them townspeople, including school children who learn about war reporting in school. Projectors were used so that people in the back could see. https://t.co/K1IA68HQ4p
8. This year, the judges led by the incomparable @Camanpour chose some of my favorite journalists for the @PrixBayeux: @jpremylemonde, one of the most talented correspondents I know (God, I‚Äôm lucky my editors don‚Äôt read French) won for print. @gwendebono won for radio.
7. Every panel depicts a different aspect of the Norman battle, from bloody scenes of war to portraits of diplomatic interludes. Whatever the reason, this little town reveres our profession. It sees it as part of its identity to celebrate conflict journalism each year. https://t.co/C2wctu8V74
6. One way to look at it is as a piece of art - and man, is it breathtaking. (Check out the horses dismounting from the ship ahead of a battle, one leg straddling the starboard). But @vivwalt encouraged me to look at it another way: It‚Äôs a 1,000-year-old example of war reporting. https://t.co/Tetqo7aRTO
@jamespmanley Ding ding ding!
5. Bayeux is the home of the famous Bayeux Tapestry embroidered 1,000 years ago. I had studied it in art books back in college. Yesterday I saw it for the first time and it‚Äôs nothing short of moving. Nearly 70 meters long, it tells the story of the Norman conquest of England: https://t.co/PAtKfvurzF
4. How do people remember what happened on D-Day? Because of the journalists who stood beside the troops armed with nothing more than a notepad or a camera. But another answer is even further in the past, @PrixBayeux judge @vivwalt explained to me. Recognize this image? https://t.co/NMNfgO50rw
3. One answer can be found if you look at the map: Bayeux is a 20-min drive from Omaha Beach, where Allied forces landed in 1944 during World War II. Locals say Bayeux was the first major town liberated from the Nazis by the advancing troops. But that memory is starting to fade: https://t.co/ITftNb7txY
2. For 25 years, the @PrixBayeux has honored the top war reporting. The town has a commemorative garden where every year, the name of every single reporter killed reporting war is added. Why would a tiny provincial town become associated with reporting war? https://t.co/qQURCeJZzs
1. This morning I left the town of Bayeux in France, pop. 13,888. In this age when journalists have been called ‚ÄúThe Enemy of the People,‚Äù I wanted to reflect on the remarkable contribution this little town has made in honoring the profession of journalism through its @PrixBayeux
Does ISIS get a vote here? Because last time I checked in with them they made very clear that every American journalist is considered a ‚Äúspy‚Äù and thus an enemy combatant. https://t.co/g6F916EZK8

@p_vanostaeyen @ToreRHamming @gcaw Okay here‚Äôs one of probably a dozen or more examples in the programming textbook. They definitely depict jihadists. But I think Tore and Raphael are right in that the face appears to be expressionless and featureless: https://t.co/KwM6nUTyx7
@p_vanostaeyen @ToreRHamming @gcaw Remind me to send you a few pages of the computer programming book when I‚Äôm next at my computer.
@ToreRHamming @gcaw Generic jihadists. The prohibition is on depicting animate life forms right?
@gcaw @ToreRHamming I‚Äôm honestly perplexed by this. In all the schools I visited in Iraq and Syria that had been under ISIS control, the faces of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck were blacked out. But in the ISIS-approved textbooks? Cartoons galore of jihadists fighting the kuffar

Folks, I‚Äôve deleted a clumsily-worded tweet from earlier today. My intention was to express sadness at what @tronc has done to the newspaper I once read every morning, one which used to have one of the best foreign desks in the country, not to offend it‚Äôs talented reporters.
@Will_Bunch Thank you, Will and to be sure, I could have phrased that Tweet better.
Whoah .... https://t.co/5G1RCM3lUB
@joeferguson @AZs_Politics @nytimes @chicagotribune Joe, I began my career in Chicago at a small paper with 0 resources. In my early years at AP, I paid for my own trips just so I could get out of the office. My tweet was not aimed at reporters, but at management. Am I not allowed to feel sad for what has been done to the Trib?
@Will_Bunch Will, I started my career in Chicago covering park district meetings and Christmas tree lightings for The Daily Herald. Community news reporting is in my blood. What I‚Äôm saddened by is the fleecing of a great American newspaper, one which once had a foreign desk to rival @nytimes
@kurtgessler Clearly my tweet was not well phrased, Kurt. But I mourn the days when I could open the Trib and read one of the best foreign sections in the country. What has been done to this newspaper and to so many others fills me with sadness.

@ElyssaCherney Thank you for your kind message Elyssa. My tweet was not aimed at its industrious reporters but rather at the newspaper‚Äôs corporate masters, who fleeced a great American institution. When I used to read it over breakfast, the Trib had 1 of the best foreign sections in the nation
@GenevieveBook Thanks Genevieve, but I started my career in Chicago - love the city - and mourn the days when I could open the pages of the Trib and read some of the best foreign reporting in the country. Do you think the cuts it was forced to undergo made the paper better?
@erinhooley Erin, my tweet was not aimed at the journalists who are working hard, but to the paper‚Äôs corporate owners who have fleeced an American institution. Remember when the Trib had one of the finest foreign desks in the country?
@CarlieProcell Good idea, Carley. And I think @ProPublica is doing just that. My old newspaper (the Daily Herald in Chicago) has received one of their grants.
@RaisingJune @chicagotribune That‚Äôs true - and it was never my intention to question that.
@RaisingJune @chicagotribune Thank you, Kerry. My tweet was not aimed at the reporters, but at the greedy corporate owners who fleeced an American institution. Back when I lived in Chicago and read the Trib every morning, it had one of the best foreign desks in the country.
@stufalk As a Californian, that‚Äôs almost more painful.
@nassemalmehairi Sincere thanks, Nassem. There was a time when I chose to read @chicagotribune instead of @nytimes each morning. It had the best foreign coverage in the nation. Sad to see what greed has done to this great institution &amp; of course I applaud the reporters who continue to do A+ work
@artintercepts @nytimes @chicagotribune My tweet was not aimed at the reporters, Lauren.
@ninnasays @chicagotribune Thank you for your kind tweet, Ninna. Good work continues to be done, yes. That doesn‚Äôt excuse what irresponsible owners did to the Trib. I used to read it every morning over coffee back when it had some of the best foreign correspondents in the nation.
@artintercepts @nytimes @chicagotribune Lauren, I began my career in Chicago. This was my hometown paper. The fact that it continues to do Pulitzer-worthy work is a testament to its reporters.

9. Few recall that of the 10 attackers, two blew themselves up ****and killed no one except themselves. That‚Äôs right: At the Stade de France and in the Comptoir Voltaire, two of these hardened fighters were so incompetent they managed to kill only themselves.
8. When we think of the Paris attack, we remember the scenes of mass murder from inside the Bataclan concert hall and the streets of the city. There were 10 attackers, and nearly all of them came from Syria where they had trained under the direction of ISIS‚Äô upper echelons.
7. We have a tendency to discount foiled attacks - ‚ÄúWhat an amateur!‚Äù But having covered many of the successful attacks up close &amp; personal, I can tell you there‚Äôs often little that separates a successful attack from an unsuccessful one. Take the catastrophic 2015 Paris attack
6. So what‚Äôs changed? At least in the US and Europe, law enforcement is doing a better job of dismantling cells and intercepting plots before they rise to the level of an actual attack - and that‚Äôs not a small thing.
5. @JcBrisard collected data both on successful attacks as well as attempted attacks. What *that* data shows is that the number of attempted attacks is constant. Meaning the group is still trying to hit us. So what has changed? Basically a *lot* more plots are being intercepted https://t.co/RNvLrYwLN6
4. On the face of it, that seems to make sense, right? ISIS lost it‚Äôs safe haven from where they used to plot attacks &amp; as a result attacks in the West are down. Sounds good, but sadly it‚Äôs almost completely wrong. To see why, look at the parallel data collected by @CAT_Centre https://t.co/vA9AxrkwPz
3. Politicians looking to score points have attributed drop to the Coalition‚Äôs gains against ISIS on the battlefield. Yesterday in Syria, troops began the offensive on the town of Hajin, the last oasis of ISIS control in the region. ISIS has lost all but 1% of land they once held
2. Data collected by @gwupoe shows a steep drop in successful ISIS attacks in Europe and America, from 14 in 2015, to 22 in 2016, to 27 in 2017, to ‚Äî- wait for this ‚Äî just four in the first eight months of 2018. It‚Äôs an absolutely jaw-dropping decline: https://t.co/UZ4Z1LZaCg
1. Do you remember the days when the news alerts announcing terror attacks seemed to come one after another? So here‚Äôs the good news: Terror attacks carried out in the name of ISIS in the West have dropped dramatically. (Read next tweet for the bad news).  https://t.co/CH4cWfN0F1

@assafmoghadam @gwupoe Always a pleasure to see you on my timeline, Assaf
8. So what is ISIS going to do when it loses Hajin? Is that going to be ISIS 2.0? Actually ISIS 2.0 is nothing more than ISIS 1.0, argues @Mikeknightsiraq. Meaning, ISIS is simply going back to its roots as an insurgency, it‚Äôs fighters dispersed in the deserts of Iraq &amp; Syria
7. I agree with @ColinPClarke who argues that the caliphate was the blip on the radar, the outlier, the exception to the rule: https://t.co/E7pkjnuWIW
6. And what people seem to forget is that ISIS is just the rebranded version of the group that implanted itself in Iraq following the 2003 American-led invasion. For 15 years until 2014, the group held almost no land, and yet they succeeded in killing 1000s and doing massive harm
5. Three different studies - by the Pentagon‚Äôs Inspector General, by the United Nations &amp; by CSIS - estimate that ISIS still has between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters in Iraq &amp; Syria. If those #‚Äôs are right, that‚Äôs more than the CIA estimated the group had at their height in 2014 https://t.co/K3dUWd1EaL
4. Politicians have taken to describing ISIS as ‚Äúdefeated,‚Äù ‚Äúdecimated.‚Äù President Trump recently said the group had been ‚Äúobliterated.‚Äù But sadly that‚Äôs far from the case. Territorial control is just one metric of the group‚Äôs strength. Another is the number of fighters. https://t.co/KWAn6koYzz
@WillTodman They don‚Äôt hold any towns in those areas. They also operate all over Iraq. Point is territorial control.
3. Once this parcel of land is erased, ISIS will hold no land in the region where its caliphate was born. Cause for celebration? It‚Äôs a big achievement which came at a huge cost (thousands of soldiers &amp; civilians killed &amp; 29,000 airstrikes which decimated cities like Raqqa/Mosul)
2. From a territory once the size of Britain, ISIS has lost all but 1% of its land holdings in Iraq &amp; Syria. The Coalition-back Syrian Democratic Forces are now clearing the last 200 sq. miles of ISIS real estate. What ISIS still holds is concentrated around the town of Hajin https://t.co/rA7fIb5Rd1
1. Today, the Coalition fighting ISIS announced the start of the operation to take back the town of Hajin, the last sliver of land under the group‚Äôs control in Iraq and Syria: https://t.co/SOWFoaI4rQ

@ICTYN @gwupoe @nytimes Thank you!
RT @ICTYN: Such an exciting &amp; valuable project! @gwupoe will work with @nytimes to archive, digitize, translate and publish the 15,000 page‚Ä¶
9. Because of @nytimes‚Äô &amp; @gwupoe‚Äôs commitment, this precious trove of 15,000+ records will in coming years be available to all - academics, historians, researchers as well as the many victims of ISIS in Iraq and in the world at large. Thank you to all who made this happen
8. @gwupoe is going to invest to translate the files and to create a state-of-the-art database, which will be searchable. I‚Äôm not at liberty to say how much this will cost, but let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not cheap and we are sincerely grateful to them.
7. And crucially, they had to be committed to making the trove available as an online database, free-of-cost to *everyone* - not just their own academics but to the public at large. @gwupoe meets all these requirements &amp; has generously agreed to invest heavily to make this happen
6. Over many months, @nytimes spoke to over a dozen academic candidates, in a search led by my talented colleague @HannahPoferl. Among the requirements we had: The institution needed to be non-partisan &amp; not connected to the US government; They had to be specialized in the topic.
@UsaidMuneeb16 That has already been done. See Tweet #2 please
5. For example, just scanning all 15,000 pages took a team of professional document handlers more than 12 weeks, working 8 hours a day. And don‚Äôt get me started on how much it cost. So we began speaking to academic institutions, both in America and abroad. @gwupoe
4. Before we even published my first ISIS Files story in April, we began researching internally how to make the documents available to the public. It became clear quickly that it was an undertaking that outstripped the resources of @nytimes: https://t.co/nZHqzlRfne
3. And after a monthslong search, the New York Times has signed a partnership with George Washington University, one of the premiere institutions studying terrorism. They will be creating a virtual library of the trove, so that it is available to everyone: https://t.co/5qXZ4ZO2TT
2. My team returned to Iraq five times, spending months in the field, collecting some 15,000+ pages of internal ISIS records. It took 3 months for a professional scanner in Delaware to digitize them, and last week, the trove was handed over to Iraq via it‚Äôs embassy in Washington.
1. Some big news: I found the first cache of ISIS documents during an embed with Iraqi troops in the village of Omar Khan in 2016. From that day until now, I‚Äôve struggled with the question of how to make the records we discovered &amp; saved available both to Iraqis &amp; to the public?

@binarybioInvest @cjane87 @realDailyWire @benshapiro Michael, before this incident, there had never been an ISIS attack in Tajikistan. Compare that to Europe and North America, where there were at least 25 in 2017 alone. Would you say that people who cycle in America are being foolhardy?

@OrtakBasiret That's very far from the case, Ortak. As my Tweet noted, the PKK is a listed terrorist organization. That doesn't change that in Iraq, they saved the Yazidis.
3. The PKK is a listed terrorist organization and its offshoot has carried out attacks in Turkey. But across the border in Iraq, among the Yazidis, they were seen as heros. When Kurdish troops fled as ISIS advanced, they were among the only ones that came to the aid of civilians
2. I interviewed Zaki Shingali at his base in 2015. He was a beloved figure among the Yazidi minority, which considers Sinjar to be its ancestral home because he was among the military commanders who came to the aid of the Yazidis when they were attacked by ISIS in 2014: https://t.co/AJ60PPOc57

@HisllllDudeness @EliLake Tim, I think it‚Äôs a difficult topic and I think that Eli is wrestling with it (as am I) in good faith.
@EliLake Those of us who have reported ISIS accounts to @Twitter were more often than not sent the form saying ‚ÄúNo rules were violated‚Äù (for exactly this reason.)
@EliLake Sadly, very little of ISIS social media is clear-cut recruitment for terrorist acts. Much of it is them railing against the abuses of the West. Taken individually, many of their tweets fall within accepted speech.
@EliLake I see your point Eli, but would you hold the same view regarding ISIS social media accounts? They also argue that their speech is being infringed.

@ACMELeader @jayrosen_nyu Based on the link you posted, this book talks about how the KKK used a PR firm to craft its image &amp; posted advertisements in the media, using that to expand its reach. Can we agree that that is very different from a critical interview where the racist‚Äôs positions are debunked? https://t.co/DrT9ad3WEi
@ACMELeader @jayrosen_nyu The study you shared undercuts your argument. It concluded that how a media organization frames white extremists matters. If a KKK rally is framed as a free speech issue, then the public had more sympathy. From the get-go, NPR framed Kessler as a racist: https://t.co/UEc4fFVgUn
@ACMELeader @jayrosen_nyu That‚Äôs an Opinion piece.
@ajaltamimi That, or the new copy editor of Amaq hasn‚Äôt yet mastered ISIS‚Äô style handbook.
@AtBestIsKorny @Mark__Bray Thank you for sharing.
@AtBestIsKorny @Mark__Bray The interview hardly treated Kessler as just another opinion. The NPR broadcast began by saying that what you‚Äôre about to hear is racist. The interviewer repeatedly pushed back on his nonsense, debunking his claims. Do you really think this is how Nazis were portrayed in the 30s?
@ACMELeader @jayrosen_nyu Do you have a study to back that up?
@jayrosen_nyu I see your point, Jay. And I can‚Äôt speak to NPR‚Äôs response. What gets me is the notion that a mere interview with one of these people is dangerous for the public. I would counter that what is more dangerous is failing to understand the enemy (as we have repeatedly done with ISIS)
@ben_mishiev @jayrosen_nyu I had no idea what he believed and I‚Äôm glad I could hear it. And there‚Äôs nothing normalizing about that interview. The reporter pushed back at every turn.
@jayrosen_nyu I‚Äôve dealt with the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt-give-them-a-platform‚Äù argument with ISIS for years.	When it comes to ISIS, it‚Äôs beyond naive to think that if we stopped talking about them they‚Äôd go away. By not listening to them, we‚Äôve instead made conceptual error after error in mounting a defense
@jayrosen_nyu To be honest Jay, I don‚Äôt understand the flap. As someone who always wonders what are these guys thinking, I found it informative to hear Kessler express his (insane) views. To see that he a) thinks of himself as the victim (who knew?) &amp; b) subscribes to quack science.

17. In closing, let me share the touching comment that was posted by a reader on the story we did about the couple‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúI wish Jay and Lauren‚Äôs life garnered more attention for the magic they sought &amp; found than the profound &amp; sad tragedy of their death.‚Äù https://t.co/nwLSuDXzLH
16. How do you kill a non-Muslim in a country like Tajikistan which is 98% Muslim? You look for foreigners. It bears noting that Tajikistan is not considered an unsafe place. This is out of the ordinary. They were biking a route that has become popular with tourists.
15. Why did they kill them? A video released by ISIS two days after their death shows five men. They rail against the ‚Äúdisbelievers‚Äù who have occupied their country and vow to ‚Äúslaughter the disbelievers.‚Äù	Disbelievers = blanket term used by ISIS to denote non-Muslims https://t.co/HthwhWEIsB
14. Jay and Lauren were killed by men driving a Daewoo sedan. The cellphone footage captured by another motorist shows how the car makes a U-turn and deliberately rams into them, lurching over their fallen forms. They then jumped out &amp; stabbed them: https://t.co/SkVynS33AI
13. Jay and Lauren believed that humanity was one. That evil doesn‚Äôt exist and was a concept invented to deal with people who hold different beliefs: https://t.co/wWQmiuGuBX
12. Why did this couple and the life they led move me so much? Because as I was interviewing their closest friends, it occurred to me that Jay and Lauren were living their lives according to a set of principles that were the exact opposite of the ones that animated their killers.
11. And just days before their death, they summited a difficult mountain pass In Kyrgyzstan only to find two little pigtailed girls waiting for them with outstretched bouquets of hand-picked flowers: https://t.co/jCECIZTN4c
10. In a meadow in Kyrgyzstan, a family walked over and treated them to sweet tea, homemade bread and an open-air concert on local instruments: https://t.co/19iYYknkyS
9. In Kosovo, three curious little boys came over to their tent in order to share their sunflower seed snack: https://t.co/7VZZQPUKRA
8. And their blog (https://t.co/rbbCeaYd2h) is chock-full of examples of the kindness of strangers. They were pedaling in 95-degree heat in Botswana, when a man stopped his car, waited for them &amp; handed them ice water. In Kazkhastan, a different man stopped to give them ice cream
7. They started their journey at the southernmost tip of Africa in July 2017. And over the months that followed, they perfected a philosophy of open-heartedness. They were open &amp; caring &amp; good and that disposition was met for the most part by goodness &amp; generosity from others https://t.co/uvsC0s8FPb
6. Asked why they chose to bike around the world - and not, say, drive - the couple listed 8 reasons. Among them is that biking makes you vulnerable. You are exposed to the road &amp; the elements, and that vulnerability brings out the best in people. They want to help you: https://t.co/ztOVV269eq
5. I adored this description of why they set off around the world: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve grown tired of spending the best part of my day in front of a glowing rectangle, of coloring the best years of my life in swaths of grey and beige. I‚Äôve missed too many sunsets while my back was turned.‚Äù https://t.co/rMI5LGFIHJ
4. Lauren and Jay had both gone to Georgetown. She worked in the admissions office there. He worked for HUD. Last summer, Jay posted ‚ÄúI Quit My Job Today‚Äù on their shared blog. He lays out why: https://t.co/kLWcVcnN0s
3. We rarely have time to delve into the lives of the victims. This week, I took the time, moved by the remarkable life of Jay Austin &amp; Lauren Geoghegan, who quit their office jobs a year ago in order to be more present and to fulfill a dream of biking around the world. https://t.co/FUEJMi0ETP
2. One iteration of that movement took the lives of a young American couple who were biking around the world. Just over a week ago in Tajikistan, they were crushed to death by a car driven by men who appear to have pledged allegiance to ISIS: https://t.co/s2W0tvRWcI
1. Twenty years ago today, al-Qaeda bombed the U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing scores of people and inaugurating the era of global terror, where jihadists sought to kill Westerners and anyone allied with them at all four corners of the world.

This post by @thomasjoscelyn includes a summary of previous ISIS-linked attacks in which the assailant left behind a video, later distributed by ISIS. Again, the pledge video has surfaced in a minority of cases, and as Tom explains, it indicates at a minimum a digital tie to ISIS https://t.co/qy3zrCgor7
RT @thomasjoscelyn: See the bottom of the piece here for a list of videos similar to the one the Islamic State's Amaq News distributed afte‚Ä¶
13. Lauren Geoghegan, 29, a graduate of Georgetown had set off on a worldwide bicycle tour with her partner starting in Capetown &amp; traveling through Africa and Europe before reaching Tajikistan, where she was among the 7 people rammed by the attacker‚Äôs car. May she rest in peace https://t.co/mZsaiGlxzS
12. How do you go about killing non-Muslims in Tajikistan, a country that by some estimates is 98% Muslim (and the majority practice Sunni Islam, the sect ISIS claims to represent)? You look for Westerners. Read the statement from the family of one of the young women they killed: https://t.co/KeZt6Qf0Se
11. In the video, the attackers claim that ‚Äúthe disbelievers have occupied this land,‚Äù according to the translation from @siteintelgroup. They threaten: ‚ÄúO disbelievers we have come to you with slaughter.‚Äù (Disbelievers = blanket term used by ISIS for anyone that‚Äôs not Muslim) https://t.co/AfdP6f0ReB
10. This is a tactic that has been heavily promoted on pro-ISIS channels in Telegrams, and is how the London Bridge attack unfolded (van + ceramic knives) as well as the Barcelona attack, both of which were carried out by ISIS-inspired attackers
9. In addition, the ministry says that the attackers they caught alive were in possession of knives. We saw the knife in the ISIS pledge video and the US Embassy confirmed that the assailants both used the car to ram the victims and then jumped out and stabbed the cyclists
8. The ministry‚Äôs statement is below and if you scroll through it, you can see several other attackers that look similar to the ones in the video: https://t.co/o7alICd0RE
7. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting: The Tajik ministry released a statement saying they had killed several of the attackers, &amp; included photographs of their bodies. Compare the blond assailant in the ISIS pledge video and the picture that the ministry released: https://t.co/jea3Od8i27
6. They hold hands and pledge allegiance to ‚ÄúAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husseini al-Quraishi,‚Äù the long honorific for the ISIS leader. At their feet is a knife. Can you spot it? https://t.co/dZlrEvqzU5
5. At the same time, Tajikistan‚Äôs ministry of the Interior released plenty of info that points to ISIS. First, let‚Äôs analyze the ISIS video. It‚Äôs just under 3 minutes long and it shows five men, one blond haired and four dark-haired: https://t.co/tOKD5w4MFQ
4. So it was today: Despite the ISIS claim, despite the video showing the attackers‚Äô pledge, despite arresting members of the cell who were in possession of knives and guns, the government of Tajikistan decided to blame an opposition party, not ISIS. https://t.co/1RFfPvD5qy
3. We‚Äôve often seen cases where governments rejected any ISIS link, only for the video or photos to emerge, making it hard to deny that the attacker at the very least had a cyberconnection to the terrorist group. Examples include the Berlin &amp; Wurzburg attack&amp; Holey Artisan Bakery
2. Of the hundreds of attacks worldwide that ISIS has issued claims for, it has only released a pledge video for a minority. While the video doesn‚Äôt mean the attack was directed by ISIS, it does mean the attackers at a minimum had a digital connection to the group
1. In addition to claiming responsibility for the hit-and-run in Tajikistan, ISIS also released a video purporting to show the five attackers pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi:  https://t.co/BbuZr7CbRM

9. What we know so far about the deadly hit and run in Tajikistan and it‚Äôs possible links to terror: https://t.co/QlGB5YUV4P
8. Compare that number (1,300) to the number of Americans who made it to Iraq &amp; Syria, a number that has varied from a few dozen to around 300 depending on who you ask. I trust @SeamusHughes' research, which has identified just 55 American citizens and residents who joined ISIS.
7. Assuming that this is the first attack claimed by ISIS in Tajikistan, allow me to point out how odd that is. Approximately 1,300 Tajiks travelled to join the jihad in Iraq &amp; Syria, according to this table by @TheSoufanGroup. That's 1 of the largest tallies for a single country https://t.co/WyFLHZ8k7u
@Cosmopolitka @nytimes Yup. Hence the use of the word, "former." https://t.co/MkMNDQhWdR
6. I don't have any other record of ISIS claiming an attack in Tajikistan. Perhaps I'm overlooking one @charliewinter @einfal @SaladinAlDronni? That is an interesting dynamic given that Tajiks joined ISIS in large numbers and have been involved in other signature attacks.
5. At the same time, Interior Minister Ramazon Rakhimzoda told @AP on Monday that it was too soon to say if the incident was accidental or deliberate. However, in the same news conference, he referred to the hit-and-run as "an attack."
4. At least one of the cyclists who survived the hit-and-run had a knife wound, suggesting the attackers had used the car to ram into the tourists &amp; then had jumped out &amp; stabbed at least one of the victims. That was the MO of the London Bridge attackers: https://t.co/yLKq5OlfiQ
4. Whereas in Toronto police say they have found no evidence of an ISIS-link to date, in Tajikistan officials are considering an extremist plot among the possible motives for the attack. Knives and guns were found with some of the suspects, according to the interior minister: https://t.co/NhTbkdLTlX
3. Compare the phrasing of the Toronto attack with the phrasing of the Tajikistan attack and you'll see that they are almost identical: https://t.co/urmv6Ze67j
2. Like in numerous past claims, ISIS describes the attackers as "soldiers of the Islamic State," but then says that the assailants were "responding to calls to target citizens of Coalition countries," which is the phrasing they use to denote attacks inspired by their propaganda.
1. ISIS has claimed responsibility for a deadly car ramming in the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan which killed four cyclists yesterday, including two Americans, as well as a Swiss and a Dutch national.

@DougOlenick @iculqn @nspector4 It‚Äôs really not, Doug.

You‚Äôre free to go with your own views if that suits you better!
@myopinion58 1. Travels to Afghanistan and Pakistan are unconfirmed. 2. A simple Google search on jihadi attitudes to suicide (which is different from a suicide bombing) will answer your second query.
@deBeauxOs1 Thank you!
@iculqn @nspector4 Suicide and suicide bombings are completely different in jihadi ideology. The latter is considered a form of ‚Äúmartyrdom.‚Äù
@NoLowerThirds Read my tweets from last night, or google the difference between intihar (suicide) and istishar (martyrdom) in the jihadist interpretation of the Islamic laws of war.

@DonToxique @porterthereport You‚Äôre absolutely right, which is why we underlined in three different sections of our story that authorities have not as yet found any evidence linking the shooter to ISIS.
@supermoon_2017 It‚Äôs classified as ‚Äúmartyrdom‚Äù which they have taken pains to say is theologically justified.
@nabihbulos @latimes @PmcdonnellLAT @LATlands @kimmurphy So cool! Many congratulations. Let‚Äôs meet in Iraq and celebrate over another really bad pizza.

@davereaboi Here's some midnight reading if you're still not convinced: https://t.co/a84EhRcDwW
@davereaboi Completely different, David. Blowing yourself up to kill the enemy has as its end killing the enemy. If he fails, he still attempted martyrdom. Putting a bullet in your head has as its end suicide &amp; therefore is intihar = not permissible. Entire PhDs have been written about this.
I wish I had a picture handy of @porterthereport at my wedding. So happy to finally share a byline with this great reporter: https://t.co/GdTOYTMbX1
@davereaboi He shot himself - meaning with his own hand - in the head. Please cite the Islamic jurisprudence that would justify that.
@Caneshaker To us maybe. Not to them.
@SquizzRadical It‚Äôs far too convoluted to explain on Twitter, but in jihadi ideology there‚Äôs a big difference between suicide and acts of martyrdom. Larry Wright‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Looming Tower‚Äù has a good history of how these concepts evolved.
@MazMHussain We've gone to pains to explain that Murtaza. Yes, the rate of false claims has increased because of the group's losses. This debate, though, is not going away, and delving into it with facts rather than opinion is in my view a worthwhile endeavor: https://t.co/zv8ZWAvt0i
@TomMitchell @AndyMillsNYT @nytimes Thank you Tom!
@Caneshaker That's a martyrdom operation. I realize that might sound the same, but trust me, it's not.
@MazMHussain Those were two erroneous claims by the group, yes. Does that invalidate the fact that they have put out quite literally dozens of correct ones? Including in instances where officials loudly denied any ISIS link, only to have to reverse course later (Ansbach, Wurzburg, etc)?
@DjurdjevicSasha Yes there is. Too long and convoluted to explain
@NoamChomskyFan @RitaPanahi The evidence on Mateen being a closeted gay man turned out to be false. What did pan out is that he had obsessively watched ISIS videos. He also pledged allegiance to the terrorist group multiple times - on Facebook, in the 911 call, in the call to negotiators, etc
6. A short history of ISIS' outreach to mentally-ill people is enclosed below, written alongside the great @porterthereport. Takeaway: There's no contradiction between being mentally unwell and acting in ISIS' name: https://t.co/WmvxgKNdhJ
5. In fact, officials in the UK &amp; in Australia have gone so far as to say that ISIS specifically targets mentally-ill people. That shouldn't surprise us. ISIS is like a farmer throwing its violent seeds over a wide field. The terror group doesn't care where those seeds take root
4. Some of the most famous ISIS attacks were led by young men whose families rushed to say their sons were psychotic, depressed, suicidal, or otherwise displaying signs of mental distress. They include the Nice attack which killed 86. The Orlando attack which killed 49 &amp; so on
3. What the data shows is that a significant portion of the terrorist attacks linked to ISIS between 2014 and 2016 - almost one-third, according to the study below by @CTCWP - were carried out by people who had a history of mental instability: https://t.co/TYGwyry97R
2. But the fact that ISIS claimed the attack - and no, ISIS doesn't claim every attack (they have been right more than they have been wrong) - has reignited the debate on whether someone that is mentally ill can in fact be acting at the behest of a terrorist group?
1. Police say there is no evidence to date that the Toronto shooter was linked to ISIS. A family friend just confirmed to me that the coroner has informed the family that Faisal Hussain shot himself in the head. Suicide is a major no-no in jihadist circles.
8. Citing a police source, Global News reports that the gunman committed suicide. If so, this is an important clue suggesting Hussain was not an ISIS-inspired attacker. As @CruickshankPaul and others have explained, suicide is a big no-no for jihadists. https://t.co/pd1OTd71dx

7. As a reporter studying this attack, what I want to know is what did Police find on his phone and on his laptop? Specifically, did he have Telegram, the group‚Äôs preferred messaging app? Who (if anyone) was he talking to? Is there evidence of him consuming ISIS propaganda?
6. Emanuel Lutchman was described as mentally ill by his family &amp; lawyers. That didn‚Äôt stop one of ISIS‚Äô most famous virtual plotters, Abu Issa al-Amriki, from contacting him online. Together they plotted an attack on a bar on New Year‚Äôs Eve in Rochester: https://t.co/wa7CDca7WR
5. The shooter‚Äôs family has come out and said that he was mentally ill. Unfortunately we know that ISIS pushes its propaganda to people who are mentally vulnerable and mental illness is not a barrier to being indoctrinated by them. See the case of the Rochester attacker:
4. They are essentially saying that Faisal Hussain, the 29-year-old who opened fire, was self-radicalized. The same formulation was used in the ISIS claims for other well-known inspired attacks around the world including the Nice attack which left 86 people dead &amp; injured 458
3. Adnani encouraged the group‚Äôs sympathizers to attack in any way they could. When I see that phrasing in an ISIS claim, I know that the terror group views the attacker as having been ***inspired*** by their propaganda, rather than someone they trained in person.
2. The phrasing regarding ‚Äúresponding to calls to target citizens of Coalition countries‚Äù is a reference to a famous 2014 speech by Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group‚Äôs spokesman. In that speech, Adnani enjoined ISIS‚Äô supporters around the world to attack in their communities https://t.co/0X2Lry3xO7
1. The Islamic State has issued a bulletin on its Amaq News Agency, claiming responsibility for the attack in Toronto which left two dead. The shooter is described as ‚Äúa soldier of the Islamic State‚Äù &amp; they say he responded to ‚Äúthe call‚Äù to target citizens of Coalition countries https://t.co/hR9F6IEmce

5. As I learned during the reporting for Caliphate, it's surprisingly hard to press charges against suspected members of ISIS who made it to the war zone. Much of the evidence available to prosecutors is not up to the standards of Western courtrooms: https://t.co/J03qI43WqG
4. Musaibli is a test case of sorts for the US government. The last time an American was captured on the battlefield last September, the government was not able to pursue charges him after determining that the evidence they had would likely not be admissible in court.
3. Musaibli, who was born in Dearborn, Michigan, and dropped out of high school to help his father run a perfume shop, is believed to have traveled to Syria circa 2015. The government will be transporting him back to he US to face charges
2. Only a few dozen Americans made it all the way to Syria to join the jihad. @SeamusHughes's database at @gwupoe has counted 71, a third of whom have died. Only a handful of the men have been captured alive on the battlefield - Musaibli is only the second to be arrested in Syria

21. Or the case of the man who went to ISIS to file a complaint against another man, because the latter's son had attacked his son.

20. In closing, let me end with some of the pettiest complaints - the ones where I imagine, perhaps even the ISIS police chief must have rolled his eyes. Like the dispute between neighbors that ended with one man repeatedly spitting at the other: https://t.co/jP1yswWGUD
@NoorjahanAkbar Yes, and so has al-Qaeda in the areas it controlled in Africa. Seems to be their boilerplate, go-to tactic.
@isoloda @nytimes Thank you very much for listening and for writing to me.
@KittenHoliday Thank you, Kitten
19. At the same time, the fact that small business owners could now reliably turn to ISIS to chase down deadbeat customers &amp; settle debts was not a minor thing. Especially noteworthy is that some of the complaints lodged by civilians were against ISIS members. @MaraRevkin's take: https://t.co/Ye6Xo65KkE
18. Of course, ISIS' police system was able to provide swift justice, specifically because people were afraid of them. That speaks to the group's brutality, something that cannot be replicated in a law-abiding society: https://t.co/OYFrJmhVKj
17. This is one of the complaints. It was for the 13,250 Iraqi dinars owed to him by a customer who had bought food on credit from his store in 2015. That's just over $11 - a petty sum. And yet, he braved sitting down with an ISIS official in the hopes of getting that money back. https://t.co/ISXctH72cy
@Aditya310794 Thanks for reading, Aditya!
16. Next we spoke to Ahmed Ramzi Salim, who ran a small grocery store in downtown Tel Kaif. He was still living there when we met him months after the town's liberation, and he too had filed numerous police reports with ISIS' Shorta Islamiya for customers who took goods on credit https://t.co/yyZa6NlJyP
@Jasminechic00 Thank you, @Jasminechic00
15. How do I know for sure that Zaid wasn't an ISIS supporter? I can't be 100% sure, but when I went to interview him the second time, I learned that he had joined the Popular Mobilization Unit (a force that is not exactly made-up of ISIS loyalists). I then set out to find more
14. Here is the signed piece of paper, bearing the ISIS members' fingerprint and showing that he has paid off the debt he owed to Zaid: https://t.co/knCYhwaye2
@MrMubinShaikh Love you right back, bro!
13. What happened next? He walked into ISIS' Islamic Police station in Tel Kaif. The ISIS police chief wrote down his complaint, then dispatched an officer to find the dead-beat ISIS member, who paid the missing 4000 dinars the next day. I found the family's assessment chilling: https://t.co/Kc895fiujh
12. His family agreed with me &amp; said they thought it was reckless of Zaid to go &amp; make the police complaint. They were worried that ISIS would retaliate. But Zaid insisted that the economy was on the rocks and that he was so poor at the time, that he preferred to take that chance
11. Imagine this: The young chicken seller went and filed a police report with one of the most violent groups in the world, accusing one of its members of swindling him out of the equivalent of $3.50. Does that seem worth it to you? I asked both him, his brother and his mom: https://t.co/DvmAJA89pP
10. Zaid explained that he charged 8,000 Iraqi dinars for the bird, or around $7. The ISIS member handed him just 4,000 and said he would pay the rest later. But he never came back to pay, and so Zaid went and filed the complaint that the Iraqi forces later found and gave to us: https://t.co/tfUMTlvtKp
Zaid Imad Khalaf worked in the market pictured above, selling chickens. One day in 2016, an ISIS member approached his stand &amp; pointed to his plumpest hen. Zaid butchered the bird, but when the ISIS member went to pay, he opened his wallet and only had half 1/2 of the amount owed
9. As I was reading through the files, I wrongly assumed that the people making these complaints must have been ISIS supporters. Why else would you choose to interact with the world's most violent terrorist group? That was before we found some of the people, starting with Zaid: https://t.co/LZ6iYHMaUv
8. The complaints were for the most minor of things: A farmer asking for an investigation into the flock of sheep that had trampled his watermelons; A parent seeking ISIS' help to discipline an unruly child who had beaten the complainant's son and so on
@Azi Thanks! Typing too fast.....
7. Many more were stored in plastic sleeves, the kind that I used to buy at Staples to store school projects. Each police file was numbered and it consisted of a complaint by a local resident of Tel Kaif, who turned to ISIS hoping for resolution, like the one below: https://t.co/XOHADwj1Xs
6. His men also took my team back to the shopfront where the documents had first been discovered &amp; on the rubble-strewn floor, we were able to pick up several dozen other papers that the Iraqi forces had left behind. The ISIS police files were stored in folders like this one: https://t.co/kURA3G6cI0
5. We hear far less about the other police unit that ISIS ran: the Islamic Police. The records found by the Iraqi forces were stored in one of their commanders' cars. I didn't reach the town till 3/2017. The commander handed over the records to me so that they would be storified
4. We're used to hearing about ISIS' morality police, or the hisba. That's the unit that roamed the streets looking for unveiled women &amp; other violations of its extreme code. That was the unit that Abu Huzayfah of the Caliphate podcast belonged to: https://t.co/LwHtCfkiLd
3. In January of 2017, Iraqi security forces liberated a town north of Mosul, called Tel Kaif (also spelled Tel Keppe). One of the units fighting to liberate the area reached a shopfront. Inside they found hundreds of records from ISIS' "Shorta Islamiya," or its Islamic Police: https://t.co/4fymXTLdgl
2. We all know about ISIS' crimes: The Yazidi genocide; the ethnic cleansing of Christians &amp; Shias; the brutal punishments it meted out to those who didn't abide by their strict codes, from stonings to beheadings. Less well known is what they did to win points with the population
1. Good afternoon all, today I'm sharing with you the in-depth investigation we did into how ISIS used prosecuted petty crime in the areas under their control as a way to win local favor. This piece is based on 400+ records from one ISIS police station: https://t.co/4QKf4vgmzR
@WittyRedKopZulu Will be posting a selection of the documents, and you can judge for yourself.

@AmarAmarasingam @ShirazMaher When I was last in London, prosecutors told me the legal system is not able to deal with these people (for the same reason that Canada can‚Äôt seem to prosecute Huzayfah = lack of forensic proof). So isn‚Äôt this a method of ensuring they don‚Äôt come home?
@ShirazMaher I share your outrage at the recent releases, Shiraz. But don‚Äôt you think the reason the UK is stripping them of citizenship is because the UK doesn‚Äôt believe they can successfully prosecute them? Huzayfah in Canada is a case in point.

3. Abu Jarrah - of ‚ÄúFather of Jarrah‚Äù - is a nom de guerre. It‚Äôs not the person‚Äôs real name. And then this piece of paper fell out. It was a Xerox of an Iraqi man‚Äôs ID. His name is Yasir Issa Hassan.  Listen today to find out how we pieced together that Hassan is the ISIS emir: https://t.co/WY4oQThKwT
2. We knew the briefcase belonged to someone important because hundreds of files fell out, bearing the ISIS logo. The files were financial reports totaling some $19 million of ISIS‚Äô money. The name we kept seeing again and again on the forms was of a man named Abu Jarrah.
1. In today‚Äôs episode of #Caliphate, Iraqi troops lead us into the ruins of ISIS‚Äô Diwan al-Hisba, the Ministry of the Morality Police. In a side room, covered in airstrike dust, we found the briefcase of an ISIS emir: https://t.co/WnwZhG5SlQ

@MosulEye Thanks for your comment, @MosulEye. We are handing over the originals of the documents we recovered to the Iraqi Embassy, as soon as we can finish scanning them.
@jokraniareflex1 @AndyMillsNYT @ajaltamimi Thank you so much
@pasuther It is my sincere hope that these records can be used to bring justice to those who committed crimes at the hands of ISIS, and solace to those who suffered as a result
10. And we include an audio clip, captured by my producer @AndyMillsNYT, where you can hear Iraqi troops describing how they were systematically burning ISIS papers. As Iraqi scholar @ajaltamimi has documented both in Iraq and in Syria, these records were being destroyed
@pasuther Kindly read the thread, Patricia. The originals are being handed over to the Iraqi Embassy jn Washington.
9. Others have asked who gave us permission to take the records? We detail at length the process we went through, from the consent we received from the commanders of each area, who in turn assigned soldiers to supervise our team as we worked:  https://t.co/wcUaoqFLsE
8. A newsroom team has interviewed the most promising candidates and I can‚Äôt wait to share the news once the agreement is finalized - and we are very close.
7. Since then we‚Äôve been contacted by over a dozen institutions both in the US &amp; abroad. Among our requirements: The partner needs to be non-partisan &amp; not associated with any government. And we were looking for a university that shares our journalistic principle of transparency
6. And so we realized we needed an outside partner to both invest the time and shoulder the cost. We advertised that we were working to make the trove publicly available in a box that ran next to my story last month, and in subsequent Tweets I put out: https://t.co/Dc7Dvdpcwv
5. But the scope of the project quickly became apparent. Some have asked why we didn‚Äôt scan the records and leave them in Iraq? There are so many it took my team 6 weeks - six full weeks - to scan 80% of the trove. The newsroom deemed that it would be too costly for us to do
4. As for making them available online, that was my goal - no, my dream - ever since Iraqi troops led me into the first building in the village of Omar Khan and helped us collect the records. Back in New York, I met with newsroom colleagues to see if we could host it internally
3. We realized the only solution that would serve everyone was an online database. (More on that later). We also recognize that the Iraqi people have a special need for these files. As soon as we finish scanning them, we will be donating the originals to the Iraqi Embassy in DC https://t.co/tNThAQaSaB
2. Our goal ever since we retrieved these files was twofold: (i) How can we best report on them in order to shed light on this terror group?  And (ii) how can we make these records available, both to Iraqis and to the world so that victims can seek justice and scholars can learn
1. Many of you have written to ask me what will happen to the ISIS Files we recovered in Iraq? Ever since we found the first set of records, my editor @meslackman &amp; I recognized their historic value. We have some exciting news we can finally share: https://t.co/wcUaoqFLsE

@upfitwriter @TVietor08 @mikiebarb As I‚Äôve said before: In the end, I‚Äôm happy that Canadian media is also chasing down Huzayfah‚Äôs story. It‚Äôs very hard to triangulate an ISIS member‚Äôs account and working together, perhaps we will succeed in getting to the bottom of his story

@upfitwriter @TVietor08 @mikiebarb @nytimes @StewartBellNP His account changed significantly from when he began speaking to me in 2016 to when he spoke to two Canadian outlets in 2017. That change tracks with what was happening in his personal life: Namely, he went from thinking he was scott free to realizing he was under investigation

@Yourartsuckspod @nytimes Thank you for listening
@upfitwriter @TVietor08 @mikiebarb Hi Christine, we began interviewing Huzayfah almost a year before CBC (our podcast traces his evolution over 1.5 years starting in Nov 2015.). CBC was the *third* media outlet to speak to him, after @nytimes and @StewartBellNP
@njcrofts Thank you Natalie!
@morgan_m @mikiebarb Flattered. Thank you
@laucesaretti @aboskovitch @nytimes Thank you, Laura.
@michaelmirer Thank you Michael. The article does not explain that we were embedded with Iraqi forces everywhere we went, and they gave us permission to collect and save the records. They did so because they themselves had already gone through the papers, and were planning to burn the rest.
@ByPatPoblete Thanks so much Pat
@NinaBernstein1 @aboskovitch @nytimes I can cite one example: The amazing reporting of @ajaltamimi. An Iraqi scholar from Britain, who has himself recovered and saved hundreds of ISIS records. Were it not for his database, I would know a lot less about ISIS. Once again though, his was a private effort
@aboskovitch @nytimes So you disagree that these documents should be made available to all online? You don‚Äôt see that as a public service?
@aboskovitch @nytimes As our story stated, the New York Times is looking for a partner to digitize the trove and make it available online to all. Are you arguing that these records should have been destroyed?

‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúHow Do You Fact-Check an ISIS Members Story‚Äù		https://t.co/WjEzqcftXb
31. If he's managed to hide the travel document he used to go to Turkey and then Syria, it means RCMP can't even prove he entered Turkey, much less Syria (where there is no stamp). Thank you to all of you who followed along. The link to the episode is here https://t.co/LwHtCfkiLd
30. I'd begun to suspect that he used either a fraudulent passport or borrowed one from a friend or relative. He did not want to discuss this point, and I don't blame him. I realized then the conundrum authorities find themselves in.
29. At this point, we called to let him know what we knew. He got quiet &amp; he finally admitted that he'd lied about the timeline. He said he thought it would look more innocent if he'd gone pre-caliphate. But on which passport?
28. So at this point here is what we know: The window of time that he could have gone to Syria has shrunk from most likely Jan-March 2015 (unless he had someone posing for him in classes in the fall of 20140. He didn't use his Canadian or his Pakistani passport to get in.
27. Next @salmanmasood visited the campus of Huzayfah's university in Pakistan. His transcript shows he was getting grades through fall 2014, but there's a gap from Jan-March 2015. We found a doc showing he'd dropped out of the winter semester (it's cropped to remove his name) https://t.co/x0dqSacqI9
26. Finally, in the Canadian passport that Huzayfah showed me there's no entry stamp for Turkey. When I confronted him on this point, he said he used his Pakistani passport. @salmanmasood in Islamabad was able to pull up that passport and it's been expired for years.
26. @malachybrowne believes the island in the river is a man-made gravel pile of some kind. But if the man shooting in that image is indeed Huzayfah, he can't have taken that shot pre-November 2014. (Again it points to a later timeline).
25. Now here is where it gets interesting: In satellite images you can see that the island inside that bend in the river did *not* exist in Nov 2014 (first picture). It's clearly visible by spring 2015 (second image). @malachybrowne here got an assist from @ckoettl &amp; @planetlabs https://t.co/UDm9RxGPpS
24. The only spot that matched that exact angle to the bridge &amp; the composition of buildings &amp; shrubs was in a bend of the Euphrates near Raqqa. And for the angle to be replicated like it was in the picture, the shooter had to be standing on an island inside the river: https://t.co/8Rr9pUKp4Y
23. He finally found the exact place where this photo was taken. The GPS location is 35.928191, 38.994816. Here is the pin: https://t.co/7WcTNDnNZS¬∞55'41.5%22N+38¬∞59'41.3%22E/@35.9281944,38.9926169,1453m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.9281944!4d38.9948056
22. The still from the video showing a man aiming a pistol over a body of water shows a bridge, a small house, some trees &amp; a pumping system. Huzayfah claimed this photo was shot near Membij. It wasn't. @malachybrowne spent a day travelling up and down the Euphrates River online
21. Welcome back, everyone. Continuing where we left off, we now know that Huzayfah for sure lied about the timeline of when he went to Syria. But can we prove when he went? The picture below provided one more data point. Check out the structures circled by @malachybrowne: https://t.co/SvzsHTt1wN
@propernamekate Thank you, Kate
@calizoned @larissaluu @AndyMillsNYT @SchwendyDorr @Pasthaaa Does he have a picture of the actual passport page? We have the Pakistani passport number &amp; ran it through the ISI database. Passport has been expired for yrs &amp; was never reissued. We also checked the passport # with Turkish officials who said no one with that # enterredTurkey
@kylebelanger1 @AndyMillsNYT Thanks much Kyle.
20. (Intermission is starting now. My crack podcast team of @larissaluu @AndyMillsNYT @SchwendyDorr @Pasthaaa are waiting for me in the studio to record future episodes of #Caliphate. Back with you in a few hours).
19. @malachybrowne is an expert on geolocation. He's able to take nondescript images like the one below &amp; zoom in on tiny geographic features that and use them to find the exact GPS location of where the image was taken. Below are the features that Malachy studied: https://t.co/ic1BQ5aACl
18. This is a still from a video Huzayfah shared with me. He said it shows him shooting a glock into the Euphrates River in Syria. He has given me permission to post it (likely because you can't make out his face). That's when we turned to my talented colleague @malachybrowne
17. Also on this travel log, we noticed there was a multi-month gap from 9/2014 to 4/2015 when he was not traveling. Could that have been when he went to Syria? If he went in the fall of 2014, the Yazidi example would make sense. That's when we began to fixate on this picture https://t.co/K1M6O6UEnT
16. That July 1 stamp? It was an exit out of Lahore as he boarded a flight to Canada. We also saw that in February 2014 - the date he said he arrived in Syria - he was flying back &amp; forth between Canada and Pakistan. At this point, it was obvious he had lied to us about the dates https://t.co/MCGy9IDFG4
15. Could that July 1 exit stamp be an exit out of Turkey? That would line up with Huzayfah's account. We then turned to my ingenious colleague @salmanmasood in Islamabad, who was able to use Huzayfah's passport number to get his detailed travel log in and out of Pakistan.
14. We at @nytimes never take people at face value and so to factcheck his account, I asked him to show me his passport. He was kind enough to let me take pictures of it. It was when I began carefully studying the stamps that my team &amp; I noticed this July 1, 2014 exit stamp: https://t.co/1TMb6u9uv7
13. By his original account, he left before July 4, 2014. But he also said he remembered the Yazidi girls being brought in trucks to Syria. The Yazidi women and girls were kidnapped on Sinjar mountain starting Aug. 3, 2014 and began being transported to Syria end of August 2014
12. But during our interview, Huzayfah had also said a # of things that contradicted that timeline. Here are some of the inconsistencies: (1) He said he left pre-caliphate. But he also said he remembered candy being handed out the day Baghdadi announced the caliphate
11. They were also told that he joined ISIS in Syria. One official gave a plausible timeline of 2014 to early 2015. Huzayfah had told us that he'd gone to Syria in Feb 2014 and left before the caliphate was declared on July 4, 2014. So far so good, right? Things were lining up
10. Next, I reached out to @EricSchmittNYT &amp; @adamgoldmanNYT. I've known these reporters for years &amp; they are among the best-sourced journalists in our business. They called several different intelligence/government agencies. They were told Huzayfah was an ex-member of ISIS
9. So imagine Huzayfah wanted to take an Air Canada flight from Toronto to Paris, and the flight cuts across Buffalo, N.Y. - then he can't board that flight b/c it enters American airspace. @nixonron explained to me that this is a big deal.
8. First, I reached out to my colleague @nixonron, who covers Homeland Security. He determined that Huzayfah had been placed on the United States' no-fly list. That means he can't board an American carrier. In addition, he also can't enter American airspace.
7. Then as we neared publication, he began to say that if we went ahead and published, he would call it "fake news" and say he made it up. That's exactly what he has done. So now let me lay out for you what we know to be true about his account.
6. He began sending me increasingly anxious texts asking us to drop the podcast. I told him we couldn't. At one point, he offered via an intermediary to pay us money to drop the podcast (of course we would *never* accept money from a source for any reason, so I again told him no)
5. We kept in touch with him over the next year-and-a-half and flew back to Canada to interview him on two other occasions. We also spoke to him by phone. I continue to speak to him now. In that time, everything changed for him. CSIS &amp; RCMP interrogated him. He began to panic.
4. We were the first people outside his family to speak to him about his experience - and we interviewed him in person before police, and nearly a year before other media. He told us he wanted closure. Not even 12 hrs after he left our hotel, CSIS came and banged on his door.
3. @AndyMillsNYT &amp; I first learned of Abu Huzayfah in November 2016. He had left Syria over a year before that &amp; had successfully traveled back and forth to Canada and his grandparent's home in Pakistan. Because no one stopped him at the airport, he assumed he was in the clear
2. By now, you've heard the detailed account of murder by one Canadian member of ISIS. As many of you have asked, why in the world would this young man admit to such crimes in an interview with the @nytimes? I'm finally able to reveal that we began speaking to him 1.5 yrs ago
1. Hello everyone, yesterday Ch 6 of the #Caliphate podcast went live, detailing how we fact-checked Abu Huzayfah's story. At least 15 @nytimes reporters, stringers and translators worked to bring you that one episode. Follow along for the back story: https://t.co/LwHtCfkiLd

@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP @ajaltamimi Thank you so much for engaging. And I certainly hope that we can make you proud.
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP @ajaltamimi It is absolutely our goal to make it free -- and available to all -- online. Requiring Iraqis (and anyone outside the US) to get visas to see records in person is obviously a flawed model.
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP @ajaltamimi If you really believe that there is a collection process in place, pls ask yourself - where are the ISIS documents from Ramadi, from Fallujah, from Diyala, from Sinjar? The only ones I know of are the documents that @ajaltamimi saved. Do you really feel that this is a bad thing?
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP @ajaltamimi You're absolutely right. Military intel was nearly always ahead of us. They took what they considered important, which was very little. As far as I could tell they were looking for lists of names. Troops that came from behind (the ones I was with) were then burning what was left
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP @ajaltamimi Second, as the article states, the Times has assigned a newsroom team to seek out a partnership with an academic institution in order to digitize the records so that they are available for all online. It was always our intention to share these documents with the world.
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP Respectfully, my question stands: Are you advocating for the burning of these documents? Because that is the reality of what was happening. And it‚Äôs not just me that witnessed it but Iraqis like @ajaltamimi
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP These are not foot soldiers. Our embeds were arranged via the commanders of each unit who assigned soldiers to escort us w/ the aim of finding documents. Would you prefer these documents were left to be destroyed? Because that is the only alternative. The army was burning them.
@aaaj_141 @warnjason @CTCWP Thank you for your tweet, Sir. But as the article explains, I was always accompanied by Iraqi security forces, who led the way and gave us permission to collect the records.

@OdenFlex @AmarAmarasingam @nytimes I sadly have no ability to stop another news organization, if they choose to be reckless. I hope that they will read @AmarAmarasingam‚Äôs tweet and consider the outcome. Police already know who he is. By revealing his ID, what you are primarily doing is punishing his family
@OdenFlex @AmarAmarasingam It is my opinion that revealing a source‚Äôs name after offering them anonymity is a gross violation of journalistic ethics.

@wardawg900 @MatthewJRoth Through an ISIS contact. We won‚Äôt know for a while which one. Investigation has already found that the stabber was on France‚Äôs S-List because of contact with a radicalized person who tried to go to Syria, so he was in with the right crowd.
@wardawg900 @MatthewJRoth There is a multiplicity of ways that ISIS takes credit for attacks. Amaq is the most common but not the only one.
@MatthewJRoth Not if you‚Äôre paying attention. We‚Äôve had video pledges from scenes of numerous other attacks including in Russia and in a Jakarta prison just weeks ago.
4. Pretty much everytime an attacker left behind a pledge video which was later disseminated by Amaq, officials eventually found evidence of a direct online connection to ISIS. Examples include Bangladesh attack, Berlin truck attack and Normandy church attack: https://t.co/zEjpH8BAPj
3. And he calls on ISIS followers elsewhere in the West, including in France, Germany, UK to follow suit. The most important thing here is that this video - if it really is of the Paris attacker (his face is mostly covered) - shows that he had at a minimum, a digital link to ISIS
2. In the video, the attacker is wearing a mask covering the bottom of his face and is in a wooded area. He addresses Baghdadi through his long honorific, like ISIS recruits are taught to do. He says the violence in France is a result of the West‚Äôs agressions against ISIS https://t.co/rtixpc0j5A
1. ISIS‚Äô Amaq News Agency has just released a 2:31 minute video clip, allegedly from the Paris attacker who went on to kill one person and wound 4 others in Paris yesterday. In it, he pledges allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. https://t.co/SdxLlwEQeM

2. In their bulletin on Amaq, ISIS described the sequential attacks as ‚Äúmartyrdom‚Äù operations. In the longer release, they identified three modes of attack including a car bomb, a suicide vest and a motorcycle-borne bomb. Waiting for details from the scene to see if this jives: https://t.co/9a2ztAcmQv
1. Horrific videos and images coming out of Indonesia where there were three back-to-back attacks on churches this Sunday. ISIS has claimed responsibility both on Amaq and in a longer press release: https://t.co/0f0ieN4Uc1
5. We don‚Äôt know much about the attacker, but according to @AFP, Paris‚Äô prosecutor is citing witnesses who claim they heard the assailant scream, ‚ÄúAllah Akbar.‚Äù https://t.co/wgX8zXVcCx
4. In the speech they are referencing, Adnani instructed ISIS‚Äô global followers to strike wherever they are, using whatever means they can, and he specifically singled out knives as a mode of attack. When we see that phrase it‚Äôs a tip-off that ISIS sees this as an inspired attack https://t.co/YTQCKqZrIj
3. The bulletin says that the attacker carried out the violence ‚Äúin response to calls to target Coalition countries.‚Äù By now, we should all know this phrase. It‚Äôs a quote from a famous speech by Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group‚Äôs deceased spokesman. https://t.co/GW2NKToWuA
2. Here is the claim from Amaq, in Arabic followed by a translation on a pro-ISIS channel. They are calling him ‚Äúa soldier of the Islamic State‚Äù (which is the term they use for their own fighters as well as anyone who carries out an attack in their name). https://t.co/U1ZNBZ0yfq

6. Keep this term in mind as you hear Abu Huzayfah‚Äôs story today, and see how ISIS uses it to justify killing fellow Sunnis.
5. I saw this term used in the leases ISIS issued for land they confiscated from the religious groups they chase out. Here is one parcel of land stolen from a ‚Äúmurtad‚Äù https://t.co/56h77Ic6X1
4. In ISIS‚Äô view, the following things turn a practicing Sunni into an apostate: 1. Serving in the Iraqi security force; 2. Running for elected office; 3. Leaving the caliphate; 4. Disagreeing with ISIS
3. To me, an apostate is someone who has renounced their religion. But in studying ISIS, I learned that this word - murtad, or apostate - is the term ISIS members use to refer to fellow Sunni Muslims who have strayed from the Islamic State‚Äôs extreme interpretation of Islam.
2. In the newly-released episode, Abu Huzayfah is about to learn how far ISIS is going to take the us-versus-them worldview. And one of the words you‚Äôll hear him use in this episode is ‚Äúmurtad‚Äù and ‚Äúmurtadeen.‚Äù That‚Äôs Arabic for apostate. https://t.co/8OP1eym3RF
