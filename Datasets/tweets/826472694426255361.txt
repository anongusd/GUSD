@jollywandering Do you mind telling us who? We only credit an MOC for a town hall if it meets our criteria:	-free and open to the public and press	-announced with at least 24 hours notice	-feature at least 30 min of open Q&amp;A	-held in or reasonably close to district
Overall in 2019 so far, 108 members of Congress have held town halls. That's just over 20%. 		If your representative or Senators haven't taken the time to listen to you this year, call them and let them know you expect them to DO THEIR JOB: (202) 224-3121

@GeoffFolsom Well, if it's any consolation, plenty of entire states don't get a town hall from their Senator all year, so Deschutes County is definitely enjoying an above average rate!		Quite possible it could be a factor of venue size / availability. Any thoughts @WydenPress?
@GeoffFolsom Newhouse is indeed on our "Missing Member" naughty list.		Also, in case you haven't seen it, we track all Oregon town halls, including state legislators here: https://t.co/mL3G2Q3IT1

@jennashap @ChrisMurphyCT @britt_foulds Thanks for the tip. You have a link / additional info?
It‚Äôs hard to understand your district when you haven‚Äôt held a town hall in over 2 years. https://t.co/8M9mdk95RP
@Marie4Congress The "First Pledger" spot for the next cycle is still open, btw... üòâ
One trend we loved to see: incoming newly elected officials holding town halls before they even took office. 		Nobody exemplified this more than @GovTimWalz, who held a 23-stop Listening Tour in Minnesota after Election Day.		Thanks for Hitting the Ground Running, Governor! https://t.co/iXkX0h8xUw
Everybody's talking about @RepAOC, but she knows that she doesn't work for pundits--she works for her constituents.		Her Instagram Lives are de-mystifying Congress for New Yorkers. 		Her balance of in-person and online accessibility earn her our Accessibility Innovator Award. https://t.co/E3cVV98O5F
In 2018, 281 candidates took the #TownHallPledge to their constituents. 		But the very first was @Marie4Congress. While she fell just short of victory, her public commitment inspired dozens of others to pledge the same to their own constituents.		Thank you, Marie! https://t.co/P2j8qexKc8
Just 15 House members (out of 434) currently have town halls announced: https://t.co/oYIDngEoGE https://t.co/5u6SXPEDFr

We were heartened to see dozens of members of Congress attend #TownHallForOurLives, #TurnoutTuesday, and #RoadtoChange town halls last year.

There were many to choose from (hiking, biking, running town halls) but at the end of the day @RepBarragan's love of America's past time (and meeting her constituents) won her our "Most Creative Town Hall" award. https://t.co/HVI8LyIaHU

Hey @cindyhydesmith, maybe you should hold a town hall with your constituents so you can explain to them exactly what you meant here? https://t.co/BZqlA3Bufm
@TheUmgawa @jeromecurl @RepHultgren @DNC There is a common sense standard for public meetings. We have consistently been *extremely* generous with that standard.		We just want lawmakers to occasionally take time to meet their constituents--we're not looking for excuses to criticize good-faith efforts by public servants.
@TheUmgawa @jeromecurl @RepHultgren @DNC If there's a national emergency that somehow prevents members of Congress from holding just one meeting per quarter with their constituents, then, uh, yeah, we'll let it slide.
10 days off is plenty of time for turkey *and* a town hall.		ü¶Éüá∫üá∏üì£ https://t.co/sIpuj8nFso

In #CA15, @ericswalwell won our "Most Creative Town Hall" Award last year with his "Hike With Your Rep" town hall. So we were thrilled to see his commitment continue with the #TownHallPledge.		His constituents agreed and sent him back to Congress for another term. Congrats! https://t.co/3NCKjmoLKi
A top contender for this year's "Most Creative Town Hall" (hint, hint) is #CA44's @Nanette4CA with her "Play Catch With Your Congresswoman" series.		She took the #TownHallPledge and her constituents have sent her back to Congress for another term.		Congrats, Congresswoman! https://t.co/Qz7v1jAeuc
#IL09's @janschakowsky is tireless in listening to people in her district (and sometimes in others with an Adopt-A-District town hall). 		It was no surprise she took the #TownHallPledge and no surprise her constituents returned her to Congress for another term.		Congrats! https://t.co/ZP1pPJ427T
#IL08 constituents see plenty of @CongressmanRaja and now that they've re-elected him with #TownHallPledge in hand, they'll see plenty more.		Thanks for listening to Illinoisans, Congressman, and congratulations! https://t.co/prmuj6cEqJ
@p_o_e @DebDingell That is such a great story.
Almost no one in Congress held more town halls this term than @KYComer, so it was no surprise he re-committed to his contstituents with the #TownHallPledge.		Thanks for listening to Kentuckians, Congressman, and congratulations. https://t.co/nG9pDKBaw7
In #MD08, incumbent @jamie_raskin made town hall accessibility a core value of his campaign by taking the #TownHallPledge, and Marylanders rewarded him with another term.		Congrats, Congressman! https://t.co/9pdpizfz5O
Constituents in #MI12 are certainly used to seeing @DebDingell at town halls in their district, so it was no surprise she made the #TownHallPledge to keep them going in her next term.		Thanks and congratulations, Congresswoman! https://t.co/izNv8RLUMz
#NY18's @MaloneyforNY was one of the pioneers of the "Adopt-A-District" Town Hall that had so much success, so it was no surprise he took the #TownHallPledge to the people of his own district.		Congrats, Congressman! https://t.co/rYzLcOy8Fs

In a musical chairs year for districts in Pennsylvania, @CartwrightPA let his constituents--both old and new--know that his job is to listen to them. 		He took the #TownHallPledge to the people of the new #PA08 and was handily re-elected.		Congrats, Congressman! https://t.co/NFfbgEuIzw
In #WA09, Rep. @electadamsmith has a strong track record of meeting his constituents at town halls, and re-doubled that commitment with his #TownHallPledge.		Welcome back, Congressman! https://t.co/68wmYCObd5
Hey @SenSchumer, your constituents are still waiting to hear when your town hall will be. https://t.co/xI2giKytIW
Few in Congress are more committed to listening to the people they work for than @MarkPocan, so it was no surprise he took the #TownHallPledge to the people of #WI02.		Congrats, Congressman! https://t.co/CFwpHcwkdu
In a tough re-election fight, @JoeManchinWV set himself apart by holding town halls across the state during his term, and renewing that commitment with his #TownHallPledge.		West Virginians decided they wanted a Senator who listens to them.		Welcome back to Congress, Senator! https://t.co/b5o61ImqnW
Now that we've celebrated the new #TownHallPledge members coming to the next Congress (see: https://t.co/LGSnmPB0rf), let's congratulate the returning incumbents!		(thread) https://t.co/K4Ch5H2QXb
In #VA10, outside Republican groups spent record numbers to re-elect "Missing Member" Barbara Comstock, challenged by #TownHallPledge taker @JenniferWexton.		Virginians made their choice: a candidate who listens to them.		Say hello to Congresswoman-elect Jennifer Wexton! https://t.co/Z8S8MgrbeB
In  #VA07's Dave Brat refused to hold town halls, complaining that when he did "the women are in my grill." üßê		Well, one of those women ran against him, and went beyond the #TownHallPledge with a promise to hold 10 town halls a year.		Meet Congresswoman-elect @SpanbergerVA07! https://t.co/Yuosnov0dK
Few races saw a greater contrast than #VA02, where incumbent Scott Taylor hadn't held a town hall since February 2017 and challenger @ElaineLuriaVA took the #TownHallPledge. 		Virginians made their choice. Say hello to Congresswoman-elect Elaine Luria.		Congrats! https://t.co/C4QPfthIPo
@samhausman @DanCrenshawTX We don't pick candidates, and these aren't endorsements. The #TownHallPledge is open to any and all candidates for elected office in the U.S. 		We believe that greater accessibility by all our lawmakers--left, right, and in between--makes our government more responsive.
In the race to replace the most notorious "Missing Member" of all, @SpeakerRyan, voters in #WI01 had the enviable choice of two candidates who had taken the #TownHallPledge.		Ultimately they chose @BryanSteilforWI to represent them. Congrats Bryan! https://t.co/34Coz01Lpm
In #TX32, @ColinAllredTX challenged powerful incumbent Pete Sessions. Allred bet on the people of his district and took the #TownHallPledge (and was the very first candidate to pose with his pledge--thanks, Colin!)		You can now call him Congressman-elect Allred! https://t.co/k4M5NKtjtf
In #TX29, @SenatorSylvia took the #TownHallPledge to her fellow Texans AND made history as one of the first two Latina members of Congress from Texas. 		Congratulations, Sylvia! https://t.co/s8eK9PXi3d
See pt. 2 of this thread: https://t.co/obm3DQ5kIG
@indivisiblewcmn @SenatorSylvia Yes indeed. Now that we've elected a more accessible Congress, it's on us to make sure they keep hearing our voices about the issues that matter to us.
In #MN02, Minnesotans didn't see a lot of Rep. Jason Lewis. So @AngieCraigMN took the #TownHallPledge to promise them *monthly* town halls:		https://t.co/jPQJxdmTpX ‚Ä¶		The result? Congresswoman-elect Angie Craig. Congrats!
No state had more #TownHallPledge takers this year than Texas. @Lizzie4Congress made accessibility a core value in her campaign to unseat John Culberson and the people of #TX07 responded.		Say hello to Congresswoman-elect Lizzie Pannill Fletcher! https://t.co/U8F3t83OrT
In open seat #TX02, voters had the choice of TWO #TownHallPledge candidates, ultimately electing @DanCrenshawTX. 		He's gotten a famous with his recent appearance on @SNL, but Texans can rest assured he'll be taking the time to meet with them reguarly. 		Congrats, Dan! https://t.co/xIvaHxcBN7
In the newly drawn #PA05, @marygayscanlon gave Pennsylvanians a candidate who was committed to listening to them by taking the #TownHallPledge.		Welcome to Congress, Congresswoman-elect Mary Gay Scanlon! https://t.co/jQYDt3QX5F
In #NY19, incumbent John Faso ran, frankly, an ugly campaign. His challenger, @DelgadoforNY19 chose a different approach, taking the #TownHallPledge and holding town halls in each of the 11 counties of his district. 		Say hello to Congressman-elect Antonio Delgado. 		Congrats! https://t.co/K2iGcD8BrE
Running in open #NV03, @SusieLeeNV set herself apart with a commitment to listen to her fellow Nevadans by taking the #TownHallPledge.		You can now call her Congresswoman-elect Susie Lee. Congrats! https://t.co/qcJnbIdsBd
Running to reclaim the #NV04 seat he once held, @StevenHorsford has always made listening to constituents a core value, even conducting "Commuting With the Congressman" rolling town halls on city buses.		No surprise he took the #TownHallPledge and prevailed. Congrats! https://t.co/0QPfIuth7W
In North Dakota, @kevincramer gave up his House seat to run for U.S. Senate. He took the #TownHallPledge  and ultimately prevailed over incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a hard-fought contest.		Congratulations, Senator-elect Cramer. North Dakotans look forward to meeting you soon. https://t.co/CevggBmoJB
In #MN03, @deanbphillips took on "Missing Member" Erik Paulsen, and one of the powerful ways he set himself apart was by taking the #TownHallPledge to his constituents. 		https://t.co/FWiruTHdz7		You can now call him Congressman-elect Dean Phillips. Congrats, Dean!
In #MI09, @AndyLevin made sure his fellow Michiganders knew he was putting their voices first with his #TownHallPledge.		You can now call him Congressman-elect Andy Levin.		Congrats, Andy! https://t.co/SZ7QTpQrA5
In #MI13, @RashidaTlaib took the #TownHallPledge in the race to replace retired "Missing Member" John Conyers.		On Election Night, she made history by becoming one of the first two Muslim-American women in Congress. Congratulations! https://t.co/xkZjER5dI4
In #MI11, @HaleyLive made her #TownHallPledge on video, promising to her fellow Michiganders she'd never stop listening to them.		She's now Congresswoman-Elect Stevens...		Congrats, Haley!		https://t.co/Rfyiqi2i40
In #IL06, @SeanCasten ran against @PeterRoskam in a hard-fought contest. One big difference between them? Roskam refused to meet his own constituents in a town hall meeting, while Casten took the #TownHallPledge.		Result? Congressman-elect Sean Casten. 		Congrats, Sean! https://t.co/xG2cZkAp38
Perhaps no state values in-person interaction with elected officials more than Iowa, and in #IA03 @Axne4Congress maintained that tradition by taking the #TownHallPledge.		Come 2019, she'll be representing Iowans as their next Congresswoman.		Congratulations, Cindy! https://t.co/JKe5NevnzJ
In #GA06, @LucyWins2018 took the #TownHallPledge to her fellow Georgians, promising to meet a higher standard than Karen Handel, the "Missing Member" of Congress she ran against.		Georgians rewarded her by electing her as their next Congresswoman.		Congratulations, Lucy! https://t.co/989cmAMonJ
In #CO06, @JasonCrowCO6 took the #TownHallPledge, committing to the people of his district that he'd meet them at least 4 times per year while in office.		On Election Day, he unseated Mike Coffman and will now have a chance to make good on that promise.		Congratulations, Jason! https://t.co/I8P6mTWeDO
Votes are still being counted in a handful of races, but we couldn't wait any longer to congratulate some of the incoming #TownHallPledge members of the next Congress!		(thread) https://t.co/ITVXBxShVd
@Scout_Finch She was certainly in the top 10, though held far more in '17 than '18.
#TownHallPledge taker https://t.co/wsdUW4kHKu
And there's certainly no cutoff on invitations to take the #TownHallPledge. We invite incoming members and returning incumbents alike to make this common-sense commitment to listen to their constituents anytime. https://t.co/cBMzpFqStz
In #CA48 @RepRohrabacher refused to meet his own constituents for a town hall. So they've decided it's time for new representation.		@HarleyRouda hasn't taken the #TownHallPledge, but we hope he makes it a priority to listen to the people of Orange County.		Enjoy the surf, Dana! https://t.co/hpIQ21ijEj

In #WA08, @davereichert refused calls by constituents to hold a town hall. They responded with Empty Chair Town Halls and intense grassroots pressure, so Reichert saw the writing on the wall and decided to retire.		We sure hope @DrKimSchrier sets a higher standard.		Later, Dave! https://t.co/DBOZgjYe4j
#OH16's @JimRenacci didn't hold a single town hall this term, but he somehow thought that meant he should get a promotion to U.S. Senator. Ohioans did not agree, and sent him packing. 		See ya, Jim! https://t.co/dcy8NVlIcW
In #IL06 @PeterRoskam disliked meeting his own constituents so much he called town halls "miserable."		Now that #TownHallPledge taker @SeanCasten has taken his job, Pete won't have to worry about being miserable ever again.		Happy trails, Pete! https://t.co/ILsYPYijXk
Outgoing Speaker @SpeakerRyan found plenty of time to attend fundraisers across the country, but not one opportunity to meet his constituents.		Rather than face their judgment at the ballot box, he's retiring, making way for #TownHallPledge taker @BryanSteilforWI. 		Bye, Paul! https://t.co/eRxdPhrlhq
In VA-10, despite having a district 15 minutes from our nation's capital, @BarbaraComstock managed to not find time for a single town hall meeting with her fellow Virginians.		We have a feeling the newly elected #TownHallPledge taker @JenniferWexton will do better.		Bye, Barbara! https://t.co/vN0LL3oSMk
In MN-03, @RepErikPaulsen responded to grassroots pressure by holding a "town hall" that kept hundreds of constituents outside a sparsely filled room. 		His constituents didn't forget, and on Tuesday elected #TownHallPledge candidate @deanbphillips instead. Bye, Erik! https://t.co/QhreEUEc3i
In KS-03, maybe @KevinYoder thought he had a "safe seat" and could take his constituents for granted by not taking the time to meet with them even once in two years.		Surprise! His constituents elected @sharicedavids on Tuesday and come January, Yoder will be an ex-Congressman. https://t.co/VDNFpCNsFp
Elected in a special election in early 2017, @karenhandel had over a year and a half to hold just one town hall meeting with her constituents. She didn't. 		So her constituents sent her packing, electing #TownHallPledge candidate @LucyWins2018 in her place.		Bye Karen! https://t.co/cc49KDPFCE
In FL-26, @RepCurbelo didn't take even a single hour the last two years to meet with his constituents in an open town hall meeting. 		His constituents returned the favor on Tuesday by electing @DebbieforFL instead. Bye bye! https://t.co/IDsACg0Hx7
We're waiting for a few races to be decided before we announce the full #TownHallPledge Class of 2019-2020 (hint: it's a lot!), we thought we'd take a moment and wave goodbye to some "Missing Members" of Congress on their way out the door. 		[thread] https://t.co/9cNvOc2QEG

Regular town hall meetings and reducing the influence of money in politics go hand in hand. https://t.co/KjAfSmAnO2
Accessibility is on the ballot this year in Texas. How big an issue is accessibility to you, #TX31? Let us know!
And, @JudgeJohnCarter, there's still time for you to show you understand just how important accessibility is to your constituents. Take the #TownHallPledge today and we'll be the first to congratulate you--and take #TX31 off the #DoYourJob map! https://t.co/VkUxVtJniO
The good news? No state has more #TownHallPledge takers than Texas! 41 candidates have taken this common-sense pledge, and 20 of them made the November ballot. 		Challenging Rep. Carter in #TX31 is #TownHallPledge taker @MJHegar. https://t.co/aZS6UkjXyP
No state has more Missing Members than Texas, with *20* of its Congressional delegation failing to hold a single town hall this term. John Carter of #TX31 is no exception. 		He hasn't taken even an hour of his time to meet openly with the people he works for--his constituents. https://t.co/1Qiu42jw2g

There's nothing wrong with certain kinds of events that don't meet these criteria, but they are no substitute for true Town Halls.
Town Halls *may not:*	-Limit attendees to a specific segment of the lawmaker‚Äôs constituents (e.g. only Republicans, nurses, veterans, seniors, employees of a specific company). 	-Screen questions in any way.	-Be closed to the press.
Town Halls *may:*	-Be dedicated to a specific topic (e.g. ‚ÄúHealth care town hall,‚Äù ‚ÄúImmigration town hall,‚Äù, etc.)	-Feature other speakers as long as the lawmaker is the primary speaker and is available to answer questions for at least 30 minutes.
Town Halls *must:*	-Held in the MOC's official capacity and not through their campaign, party, etc.	-Be entirely free and open to the public.	-Be announced publicly at least 24 hours‚Äô notice.	-Feature at least 30 minutes of open Q&amp;A.	-Be held within 30 min drive of the district
We cover a lot of events to inform constituents, but only a select number are true Town Halls. What are our criteria?		(thread)
@EnglishAdams @RepRodBlum NOPE!		Town Halls must be open to the whole town (and all other constituents!).
66% drop in MOCs holding town halls from 2017 Aug recess to 2018.		286 haven't held a town hall in over a year. 148 have held zero this entire term.

"As a representative of Kansas, we think it‚Äôs literally his job to be attending town halls like this," said Ma, a member of her school's debate team who also volunteers for the Youth Hope Fund, a Chinese-American charity devoted to overseas disaster relief efforts.
"We want dialogue. We want him to show up. We want him to show that he cares about how we feel," said Mills, a junior at Blue Valley West High School.

If members of Congress cannot meet with their own constituents even once, they at least owe us an explanation of what they're doing with their time that's more important. 		Please, tweet @, make offices visits, and call them: WHY AREN'T YOU WILLING TO MEET WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS?
Only 60 members of Congress--out of 531--are holding any kind of town hall meeting this two-week District Work Period (aka "Recess"). 		That means 89% of Congress isn't meeting with their constituents even once, despite thousands and thousands of young people asking to be heard.
Hundreds of young activists around the country are stepping up to organize these events. But let's not forget they're only doing so because members of Congress are refusing to do their jobs.

And you're totally encouraged to have plenty of campaign town halls. We love to post those and will continue to. But the nature of this event is different--we hope you understand.
Quick word to candidates:  It's great that so many of you are eager to hold a #TownHallForOurLives. 		We ask you to invite all other candidates in your district (of both parties) and allow local grassroots to have a leading voice. These should NOT become campaign rallies.
@blamethemovies @RepStephMurphy Yep. This list is not inclusive of all members of Congress holding town halls this recess--just #TownHallForOurLives events. If Murphy decides to turn one of her coffee events into a THFOL let us know!

For the record, there's nothing at all wrong with a lawmaker meeting privately with representatives of Catholic Charities. But it's not a town hall. 		And it's made worse by the fact that he doesn't actually hold any actual town halls open to the public in his own district.
@Lillian_Salerno @PeteSessions Can we get you and @ColinAllredTX to come together for a combined #TownHallForOurLives on April 7? On this important issue it would be great to have a unified forum for dialogue rather than separate events.
A "private town hall"?		@SpeakerRyan that's... not how this works. https://t.co/h71Tyndzmy
@RTRtiliDie_256 We'll include an event with a member of Congress's staff on our larger event list, but it isn't a substitute for a Town Hall.

@_LenaZennia_ Best to focus on your own reps, since others have a plausible justification to ignore you. However, if you're in a better position to help others in another district, we certainly encourage you to use your best judgment.
We don't know what @TedCruz's zodiac sign is, but whatever it is it's not known for accessibility, accountability, or courage, because he hasn't held a single open town hall meeting this term.		Find the full list of Missing Members here: https://t.co/pTaD1oM6JO https://t.co/OA2oMMKLoF

And, don't forget, in addition to #TownHallForOurLives, there are dozens of Town Halls with members of Congress currently scheduled--these are very powerful opportunities to Show Up and Speak Out to our lawmakers.

Two quick notes:		1) These are incredibly valuable forums for students to speak out about this critical issue. We encourage more lawmakers to hold them.		2) These aren't a substitute for an open forum on all legislative topics open to all constituents.
Another important opportunity for young people to make their voices hard on gun violence, as @DorisMatsui holds a Gun Violence Town Hall for the students, parents, and faculty of JFK High School in Sacramento: https://t.co/AVx2YPaMX4

It's not too late for the other remaining candidates to take this basic pledge to remain open and accessible to constituents. If you have a favorite candidate for office in Texas, please encourage them to make this simple commitment.

Texans running for Congress: we invite you to join these 16 candidates in taking the #TownHallPledge to hold a minimum of just four open town hall meetings per year of your term if elected. https://t.co/aRFA8xsNzJ
#MD01! You have an enormous opportunity to make a very big impact on DACA. @RepAndyHarrisMD is holding an Immigration Town Hall TONIGHT. 		Details: https://t.co/GjQbh7Vs77 https://t.co/yha3MRFupp
Congress thinks they can just wait this out (like they've done every time before). Are you going to let them? https://t.co/Hchio9lg9l
UPDATE: #TX03 gets their first (and so far only) candidate who's pledged regular town hall meetings open to ALL constituents, @SamJohnsonTX3.		The incumbent, the OTHER Sam Johnson (retiring) is one of 20 Texas Missing Members. https://t.co/Q0IR4GKxuD
RT @AgentAnole: Please take the Townhall Pledge! @JanForCongress @BigganForTexas @ToddAllenTX @joshimhoff4cd24 https://t.co/BTnusPN50U
#TX25, you have another great choice for a candidate who promises to be accessible and accountable in @ChrisPerriTX. 		Incumbent @RogerWilliamsTX has held ZERO public town halls this session. https://t.co/DATeqrrndE
UPDATE: @ElectKentLester running in #TX31 takes his pledge to the people of the 31st district to hold regular town halls and put their voices first. 		The incumbent? Missing Member @JudgeCarter. https://t.co/lzVzTXbM7M
THIRTEEN Texans running for Congress have now taken the #TownHallPledge. https://t.co/L7r0sySX2t
UPDATE: @westfortexas jumps in with an above-and-beyond commitment to hold one town hall PER MONTH if elected. 		The incumbent in #TX25? Missing Member @RepRWilliams who has held ZERO this session. https://t.co/qWWzTYh9vL
For the evening crowd: we announced the first wave of #TownHallPledge takers today in Texas. TWELVE so far, and more to come...		Whether you're in Texas or elsewhere, let your district's candidates know you consider regular public accessibility a basic part of the job. https://t.co/aRFA8xsNzJ
@BelinaItalia @RepDaveJoyce Hey @BetsyRaderOH, what do you think? Would you meet with your constituents if elected?
And @tedcruz, we'd happily shout out your town halls too if you, ya know, held any... https://t.co/8kaQivCiAA
@GodcallsBS @JanzforCongress We haven't started actively reaching out to CA candidates yet, but all are welcome to sign the pledge anytime!
Atlanta, Paris, Pittsburg... you'd think Beto O'Rourke was globe-trotting, but he is in fact holding his many many town hall events in awesomely named towns across Texas. https://t.co/qpuEMT3D5W
#OR01! Your very own @RepBonamici is holding *six* town halls in March all across the district. Make sure she hears what YOUR priorities are. 		https://t.co/oYIDngEoGE @indivisibleOR1 https://t.co/yaU78RGPJB
Clarification to the above: Pete Olson did hold a "Veterans Town Hall" this February but has not held one open to the public at large and all legislative topics.
Now TWELVE. Thanks to @sbrown4congress for his commitment to his constituents to be accessible and accountable! https://t.co/XIGVSNNfM4
UPDATE: @sbrown4congress running to unseat @PeteOlson in #TX22 makes a committment to accessibility to the people of his district! 		Worth noting: Olson has not held a public town hall meeting in over a year. https://t.co/YoVsgruI68
@sbrown4congress Terrific. Thank you!
Make that ELEVEN #TownHallPledge takers in Texas. 		First new signed pledge of the day from @JulieForTX25! https://t.co/lHqADJqUmY
UPDATE: Excited to add @JulieForTX25 running in #TX25 to unseat Missing Member @RepRWilliams. Julie is going above-and-beyond with a commitment to hold one town hall PER MONTH. Awesome! https://t.co/3wi6OE7EhN

RT @tom_hanan: @SriPKulkarni How about adding your name to this list? We both know @RepPeteOlson won‚Äôt. https://t.co/iBhqZ5f9Zb
RT @hey_jay_pee: Hey @AftabPureval‚Äîwill you sign the @townhallproject #TownHallPledge?
@EHekeler @LamarSmithTX21 Texans of his district. We sure hope any member of Congress would consider the needs of their state and the country as a whole. But the pledge is to the constituents of his district.
@westfortexas Terrific. Can you DM us your email?
RT @jollywandering: @westfortexas Will you take the pledge? https://t.co/stW92wuCpW
AND if you work for, volunteer for, or support a campaign that's holding a town hall campaign event, please submit them to us so we can help spread the word! Campaigns are always better when candidates hear from their voters.		https://t.co/hv53lN7Abn
This doesn't have to be the end. Candidates in your district not in this list? 		There's still time! We would love to lift up each and every candidate who takes this simple #TownHallPledge to never ignore the voices of the people they work for--their constituents. https://t.co/eU3cIICk9j
The lucky voters in the #TX32 primary have another great option, with @ColinAllredTX who said, "I proudly signed the @townhallproject pledge. As your member of Congress, I will listen to the people I represent and give you the opportunity to have your voices heard." https://t.co/e9fY2t5mIt
Also running in #TX32 is @EdforTX who recorded this terrific video about why he's taking the #TownHallPledge. 		Take it away, Ed...		https://t.co/EZF2tB2U1i
.@Lillian_Salerno is making it clear to the voters of #TX32 that if they send her to Washington D.C., she's going to be listening to them throughout every year she's in office. 		The incumbent? @PeteSessions who hasn't held a single town hall since March of 2017. https://t.co/uxBKMOPY4A
In her campaign to unseat Missing Member @JudgeJohnCarter, veteran @mjhegar sends a powerful message to the voters of #TX31 with her commitment to hold open meetings at least four times per year. https://t.co/ChDamGhBDu
Progressive @JosephKopser makes it a hat trick in #TX21, and takes it one step further: pledging to aim for one town hall PER MONTH. We love it! https://t.co/Niyqlbn9XH
Another Republican running in #TX21, @VoteMattMcCall makes it clear that if the voters of central Texas send him to Congress, he'll always listen to them. https://t.co/fPtuq2GMHD
And it's not just Democrats taking the pledge. Francisco "Quico" Canseco is running in #TX21 to replace retiring Missing Member @LamarSmithTX21. Quico is making it clear to Texans that if elected he'll put their voices first. https://t.co/ur9qFbYb0F
Running in a competitive primary field in #TX07, @DrWestinForTX07 is currently the only candidate who has made accessibility to Texans a priority by taking the #TownHallPledge. 		The incumbent? @CongCulberson who has not held an open town hall since March of 2017. https://t.co/Z5pKj1dX8o
Running to replace retiring Missing Member @JudgeTedPoe in #TX02, @toddlitton is committing to the voters of Harris County that he'll be accessible and accountable if elected.  Thanks, Todd! https://t.co/Rt7VaTpQIY
Running for U.S. Senate, @BetoORourke, has made town halls a core of his campaign, holding dozens across the state. And by taking the #TownHallPledge he'll continue to make accessibility to Texans a core priority as a Senator.		The incumbent? Missing Member @tedcruz. https://t.co/wpWtqvJmEH
Texans (and friends of the Lone Star State)! We're thrilled to announce TEN candidates for Congress have taken the #TownHallPledge so far. üéâüá∫üá∏		Who are they? Thread... üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/Kt3TS2Ykju
@OHDistrict2 Neither can we! 		(Candidates are welcome to take the Pledge anytime of course)
Bi-partisan Town Hall in Colorado. We'd love to see more of these everywhere!		Hats off to CO state reps @lorisaine and @matthewogray for showing that our democracy is stronger when we talk to each other.		https://t.co/GdVynrnHE8
