Mississippi is one of 3 states that bans people with a criminal conviction from voting for the rest of their lives. Once lost, Mississippians only have 2 ways to regain their right to vote: at the behest of the Governor or through a suffrage bill passed by the State Legislature.
Disenfranchisement laws paralleled other voter suppression measures such as the poll tax and literacy clause that directly targeted people of color. Voter suppression, as we saw in the 2018 midterm elections, is still a problem, especially in communities of color.
Historically in the South, the disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions has been a voter suppression tactic with roots in the Black Codes — Reconstruction-era laws that over-criminalized African Americans &amp; provided legal justification to strip them of basic rights.
Between 1994 and 2017, an estimated 50,000 Mississippians lost their right to vote because of a criminal conviction. Most of those disenfranchised have completed their sentences. They’ve paid their debt to society — their voting rights should be restored.
With a two-thirds majority in both houses, Mississippi has the authority to pass a law to “restore the right to suffrage to any person disqualified by reason of crime.” Put simply, a person with a criminal record shouldn't be disenfranchised; they should have the right to vote.
We’re holding a press conference at the Mississippi State Capitol today, asking lawmakers to restore the voting rights of Mississippians disenfranchised by the state’s lifetime ban on voting for people convicted of certain crimes.

Public support for legal marijuana in the United States is high – 62 percent in recent polling. … It’s time for Alabama to reexamine its marijuana laws and implement a responsible approach to marijuana use by adults. https://t.co/ekSv9pFfyf
"It is my belief that one night in jail than any health effects associated with marijuana usage." — @JessDKelley
The collateral consequences of jail time, fines &amp; court fees on people charged with marijuana possession can be disastrous: they may lose access to employment, housing, education, voting, driver’s licenses, etc.
"Like alcohol prohibition, marijuana prohibition simply hasn’t worked," said @JessDKelley of @RSI. 		10 states have legalized marijuana usage. 23 states + the District of Columbia have decriminalized the possession of marijuana.
“When you get to 2.2 lbs., that is listed as a violent crime in Alabama,” said SPLC Alabama Policy Counsel Shay Farley. 		Alabama's marijuana laws "lack clarity, drive the poor deeper into poverty and shatters lives."
"Once that marijuana was mixed with the butter then the whole butter becomes marijuana, &amp; that’s what we weighed," Phil Sims, deputy commander of Etowah Co. Drug Enforcement Unit, said. But, the Rainbow City police dept. said they wouldn't weigh the butter, just the marijuana.
For example, This year in Etowah County law enforcement officials charged a man with drug trafficking after adding the total weight of marijuana-infused butter to the few grams of marijuana he possessed, so they could reach the 2.2-pound threshold for a trafficking charge.
Alabama's marijuana laws aren't enforced fairly. Law enforcement has discretion to choose how a person is charged for breaking the state’s marijuana laws, meaning that 2 people can be charged with the same crime but suffer different punishments, says Frank Knaack of @AlaAppleseed
Alabama police arrested black people 4 times more often for marijuana possession — and 5 times more often for felony possession — than they arrested white people for marijuana possession in 2016. https://t.co/JcDpXxuWgZ

The Montgomery bus boycott lasted one year and 15 days, ending on Dec. 20, 1956, the date the city's buses were desegregated following the Supreme Court's ruling in Browder v. Gayle. #RosaParksDay
The people who participated in the Montgomery bus boycott, which started on Dec. 5, 1955, didn't do it without sacrifice. "They put everything at risk to engage in this peaceful protest," said historian and Alabama State professor Dr. Derryn Moten.
"This is the epicenter of world change," said Alabama State's president Dr. Quinton T. Ross Jr., referring as much to the Montgomery's role in the civil rights movement as to the fact that Rosa Parks attended a high school operated by the university's education department.
Rosa Parks was already a civil rights activist with a history of fighting against racist violence by the time she refused to give up her seat on the bus. In 1955, she was a secretary for the Montgomery NAACP.
Dr. Rolundus Rice, a professor in Alabama State's history department, called her arrest "the most faithful &amp; fortuitous arrest in the 20th century," comparing its significance to that of the Boston Tea Party because of its impact on the civil rights movement.
Alabama State University held a ceremony recognizing the importance of her role in the movement. The university's archives contain documents pertaining to Rosa Parks' arrest. https://t.co/il11Lla3ME
Alabama is the fifth state in the country to set aside a day to recognize Rosa Parks. Events commemorating her contributions to the civil rights movement took place throughout Montgomery.
Today is Alabama's first #RosaParksDay, commemorating the date — Dec. 1, 1955 — of her arrest for refusing to surrender her seat to a white passenger on one of Montgomery's city buses, sparking the Montgomery bus boycott.

This supermajority still exists in Mississippi.
This ⅔ is called a supermajority. The first supermajority was in Mississippi. Around 1890, wealthy former slaveholders coordinated to protect against tax increases. This protected them from future efforts to provide schools, parks, roads, colleges for people of color.
As @floridapolicy wrote: “Amendment 5 would cement in place Florida’s inequitable tax system and low investment in public services, locking in inequality for generations to come.”
Amendment 5: If passed, Amendment 5 would require ⅔ of Florida’s Legislature to approve new state revenue, taxes or fees, or eliminate tax incentives, loopholes, etc.
Today, Florida’s third degree theft law is a remnant of this. The low threshold — $300 — contributes to the 1 in 5 African Americans in Florida who are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction.
Laws like this one were part of “Black Codes” that former Confederate states instituted to fight back against integration and equality.

And now that Lost Cause "history" is being perpetuated by President of the United States. Robert E. Lee was not an incredible general. And monuments to his name are not "beautiful."
It's a "history" that was taught for generations, leaving today's high school students unsure of the truth. In our survey from earlier this year, only 8 percent of high school seniors could identify slavery as the central cause of the Civil War.	 https://t.co/uZnsjS5Uow
This "history and culture" Pres. Trump spoke of is Lost Cause revisionist history. It is not the real history of America. It's a "history" that saw monuments to Robert E. Lee built 40 yrs after the Civil War, when Jim Crow disenfranchised Black Southerners + the KKK was revived. https://t.co/AuT5fX5Qt2
And this isn't the first time President Trump praised the Confederacy. He's called the removal of “beautiful” monuments “foolish” and tweeting that it is “[s]ad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart.” https://t.co/2Z4ZYJZQ7R https://t.co/edZKsIbguk

By failing to give applicants to the state’s Medicaid program a decision about their eligibility within the mandated 45 days, Tennessee is depriving thousands of people of access to essential medical care. The state must fix this broken system. https://t.co/G8kMmHQIC4
Kayla Krauss: “In April an advocate helped me file a 3rd application at the same time as a delay appeal. That was the first time I learned about that option. I finally got insurance 2 months after my 2nd application, 5 months after my 1st one — 5 weeks before I gave birth.”
Kayla Krauss: “I started calling 2x a week. I got transferred or told it was being processed. … No one told me anything about a delay appeal. I found something about appealing if you were denied, but I hadn’t been denied (or approved) so I didn’t think that applied to me."
Kayla Krauss: “In February 2017, I filed a second application for TennCare. I started to have problems with high blood pressure. I was stressed, worried, scared: high blood pressure can kill the baby and be fatal to the mother.”
Kayla Krauss: “On Nov. 1 2016 I learned I was pregnant. I applied for TennCare. I didn’t receive anything, including delay info. The OBGYN wanted to run tests at the end of Dec; in Jan, she wanted to do an ultrasound &amp; glucose testing, but I couldn’t afford to pay out of pocket."
It took a third application and a delay appeal to finally get a decision on whether Kayla Krauss was eligible for the state’s Medicaid program — five weeks before she gave birth.
Kayla Krauss applied for TennCare just a few weeks after learning she was pregnant. Her application was delayed. She applied again. The second application was delayed.
Amy Foster: “I’m a lawyer. My mom has a doctorate. I went to the trouble of becoming Lee’s conservator to force people to talk to me. I have a partner who supports me, an understanding boss. Not everyone has those kinds of benefits. And it was still this hard.”
Amy Foster: “On June 6th, he went to a TennCare group home. He hasn’t been homeless, on drugs: he’s stable. Not one in-patient psychiatric episode. This has been the best it’s been in a really long time. To us, this is a really big deal.”
Amy Foster: “This process was byzantine and burdensome. It felt like they hoped you wouldn’t apply, and when you were delayed they hoped you wouldn’t appeal. … The whole time he was running off. He had periods of homelessness, we couldn’t get him to consistently take his meds."
Amy Foster: “On more than one hour-long commute [to work], I’d spend my entire commute on hold. I’d get to my office and have to hang up without talking to anyone.”
Amy Foster: “When I talked to the hospital they said he needs residential [care] for a year, but insurance wouldn’t cover it. The doctor said a TennCare group home could swing it. So I applied Dec. 28, 2017. On March 6, 2018, they said they were still working on his application.”
Amy Foster: “He has moments of psychosis. Bipolar disorder. Substance abuse problems. Suicide attempts. His mom has spent $100,000+ trying to help him [and] continued to carry him as a disabled adult on her health insurance. But many facilities only accept people on TennCare.”
Amy Foster cares for a cousin with severe mental illness. Insurance wouldn’t cover the residential care he needed. It took 6 months to get her cousin into a TennCare group home — months during which he couldn’t consistently take his medication and was sometimes homeless.
Don Adams: “I only made $18,000 a year. I just wanted insurance for myself and my son. I applied on February 27, 2014, the day after he was born. We didn’t have insurance before July.”
Don Adams: “They told me in four more hours, I would have been dead, and that I could be dead anyway because of the amount of antibiotics they had to give me could kill me. The doctor said he hoped I had a strong liver.”
Don Adams didn’t have insurance either. He testified: “Then I got a fever and sores but I didn’t realize it was MRSA because I didn’t go to the doctor: I didn’t want more bills. I had to get help [when] I was afraid I was gonna die. Never had so much pain.”
Don Adams: “I was mortified. I have a child, can’t take him to the doctor. We ran up so many bills they told us not to come back. My wife used to weep over his baby bed because anything can happen in the first year and we didn’t know if he was okay.”
Don Adams: “For weeks, nothing. When I finally got hold of someone, they said they didn’t have any record of [my application.] I thought the system was just really slow. No one told me we could appeal.”
When Don Adams’ wife gave birth, they thought her insurance would cover their son. But as he testified: “When my son was born, the doctor told us once he left [the hospital] he wouldn’t have healthcare. So I called TennCare immediately. I applied the day after he was born.”
We’re suing Tennessee for leaving thousands of Medicaid applicants' lives in the balance while they wait for a decision. Three witnesses who experienced these life-threatening delays — Don Adams, Amy Foster &amp; Kayla Krauss — testified when the case went to trial this week.
No Medicaid decision means newborns who can’t get monthly checkups and people with chronic conditions who can’t get medicine. Four years after we first filed suit, Tennessee is still averaging 330+ people/month who can’t get medical care bc they don’t know if they have insurance.
Tennessee is required to determine Medicaid applicants’ eligibility within 45 days — but since 2015, at least 21,552 people have had to wait longer than that (sometimes months longer) to get treatment or medication bc no decision has been issued.
Since 2014, Tennessee has left thousands of applicants for the state’s Medicaid program (called TennCare) in limbo. We’re suing. https://t.co/G8kMmHQIC4

6. Jose was taken to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, thousands of miles away from his son, where our lawyers met with him to help him fight his asylum case and try to reunite with his son.
5. For weeks, José only knew that his son was in a shelter in Arizona — not the name of the shelter, and no phone number at which to reach him.
4. As José held the boy’s hand to walk toward the bathroom door, an immigration official took the boy, who began to cry for his father. They were not given a chance to say goodbye, nor was José told where his only son was going.
3. José and his son were taken to a temporary holding facility. At some point, José requested to leave his cell to accompany his son to the bathroom.
2. Despite the government's insistence that people who present themselves to immigration officials at ports of entry would not be split apart from their children, this, officials took his son away.
1. José fled Honduras with his 3-year-old son because he feared for their lives. The two had rarely been apart, and they came to the country together — with José’s identification and his son’s birth certificate. They presented themselves at a port of entry seeking asylum.

LGBTQ+ students heard homophobic slurs as they walked down hallways at a public high school in Oregon. Food was thrown at a transgender student in the cafeteria. And, administrators forced LGBTQ+ students to read the Bible when they got in trouble. https://t.co/feDbYYE3wY
Attorney General Jeff Sessions may upend protections for women seeking asylum from domestic violence and other forms of gender violence. To deny asylum to women fleeing gender violence will only make them more vulnerable. https://t.co/MSBMEPUZvp
#HB2315 divides &amp; weakens Tennessee communities. It communicates to immigrants that their social &amp; cultural contributions aren't welcome. These aren't the values expressed in our Constitution. But they are the values expressed by this legislation #NoHB2315 https://t.co/pwH5i0s70m
For Mississippi to be readmitted to the Union after the Civil War, it had to provide a "uniform system of free public schools" for all children — regardless of race. That was 1868. Today schools in Mississippi are anything but uniform. #BrownvBoard https://t.co/134kRiPbzx
When schools in Cleveland, MS desegregated, black families took the opportunity to enroll in the historically white school. White families didn't budge. It wasn't until 2017 that the majority black school closed &amp; merged with the historically white school https://t.co/xvgxU7DjTJ
But in #Mississippi, schools still aren't equal. We're suing. https://t.co/8FDbmtLad3
64 years ago today, #BrownvBoard of Education ruled that separate schools are not equal. https://t.co/H9InxZVPsk
"En el Centro de Detención de Steward, Georgia, los detenidos trabajan todo el día por cuatro dólares; quienes se niegan a trabajar son privados de alimento decente e higiene."	https://t.co/FPcKcHcjjb
Immigrants detained at Stewart Detention Center who refuse to perform "voluntary" work are threatened with solitary confinement and the loss of access to basic necessities, like food, clothing, hygiene products, and phone calls to loved ones. 	https://t.co/ekC4W8tum7
"Private prisons have for years enriched themselves by exploiting detained immigrant labor. They must be held accountable."		With @ProjectSouth and others, we've filed suit against #CoreCivic for using forced labor of detained immigrants to boost profits. https://t.co/nGACtewzbE
No one should be incarcerated because of an inability to pay for their freedom. But more work needs to be done across Florida, to ensure that we have ceased operating a two-tiered system of justice that punishes the poor simply because of their poverty. https://t.co/LG9nh1b2CA
Laws that disenfranchise people convicted of felonies are a holdover from segregation &amp; disproportionately target people of color. Yesterday, the LA Senate voted to restore voting rights for people on parole or probation after a 5-yr waiting period. #laleg https://t.co/VWsPd5HKyD
This kind of rhetoric is unacceptable from anyone. For it to come yet again from the mouth of the president is dangerous. https://t.co/aEXDJ6fJkw
And we’ve seen it in our own country. Just last month, three extremists were found guilty of a bomb plot to kill Somali Muslims in Kansas. They, too, referred to them as “cockroaches.”
We’ve seen this kind of dehumanizing language before. We saw it during the Holocaust when the Nazis called Jews Untermenschen — subhumans. We saw it before the Rwandan genocide when the leader of the Hutu party called Tutsis “cockroaches.”
Shame on him. For the president of the United States to insinuate that immigration status or criminal record somehow determines humanity is not only appalling. It’s dangerous.
President Trump said at a conference on sanctuary cities: “These are not people. These are animals.”
Tell President Trump that his racist and dehumanizing rhetoric has no place in the White House. https://t.co/aEXDJ6fJkw

President Trump warned law enforcement officers almost a year ago about the “animals” they were up against. Today he used the exact same dehumanizing language at a press conference.  		This is unacceptable and dangerous. 	https://t.co/8kTqggOhm8
Immigrants are people. It’s appalling that the president of the United States would say otherwise. https://t.co/5QzbjEPAMO

“I wanted to go to prom as myself, and I wanted other people to be able to do the same thing.”		Britney, an Alabama high schooler, refused to give in when her school would not let her wear gender nonconforming clothing to prom. She stood up for her rights. https://t.co/jcDux0UrwY
Last week, chief of staff John Kelly said immigrants “are not people that would easily assimilate into the United States, into our modern society.”		His words echo decades of anti-immigrant extremists. 	https://t.co/OIwlmbvCK8
The Trump administration has ordered the end of TPS for 300K immigrants — nearly all of the populations who had been shielded from deportation under the humanitarian program.		"The nearly 30-year-old immigration program is essentially dead." https://t.co/86dMX0gsMr

We designated Family Research Council an anti-LGBT hate group for decades of demonizing LGBT people and spreading harmful pseudoscience about them. Since joining the FRC, Perkins has taken the group in a harder anti-LGBT direction. https://t.co/bnKF45FCNb
In 2001, Perkins gave a speech to the Louisiana chapter of the hate group Council of Conservative Citizens — an offshoot of the white supremacist White Citizens Councils that formed in the 1950s after the #SCOTUS ordered the desegregation of public schools across the country.
In 1996, while managing a U.S. Senate campaign, Perkins agreed to pay $82,600 for robocalls from a company run by David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. https://t.co/yuoKbl643b
There's a lot you don't know about Tony Perkins, head of the anti-LGBT hate group Family Research Council and new appointee to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom:
Work requirements create one more inappropriate hoop for the nation's most vulnerable to jump through to receive life-saving healthcare. 		In MI, the category of who will be forced to follow these unnecessary rules is falling along racial lines.	https://t.co/AxuQrEYd0l
