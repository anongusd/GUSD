President Trump’s nominees have faced 128 cloture votes in the first two years of his administration compared to 24 for all six of his predecessors combined in their first two years.
HELP Committee advanced 11 nominees today, most for 2nd time. These nominees have been delayed a combined 10 years since they were nominated by the president, thanks to Senate Democrats deliberate obstruction of the process. This is partisan politics and it’s bad for the country.

Let’s make health care better for patients by unrigging the system, lowering costs, and giving patients the power.
A one-size-fits-all, DMV-style, “Medicare for all” health care system would be great for government bureaucrats &amp; ignorant politicians who want to control what food you eat, what medicine you can have &amp; whether you should have children, but it would be terrible for everyone else.
Health care should be personalized, customized, innovative, and cutting edge. It should be about giving patients the power to make their own choices about their own treatment.
Banning private health insurance plans and forcing Americans to ask the government to see their doctor or get a test won’t make things better.
Socialism won’t solve the problem of sky-high health care costs, it will make things worse.
As Claire McCaskill said this week, Democrats’ new plan will “make ObamaCare look like a very light touch.”
Unfortunately, Democrats’ so-called “Medicare for all” plan would actually mean Medicare for none. It would require taxes on families to double or triple.
I welcome Democrats to the coalition to repeal and replace Obamacare. Only took 9 years! https://t.co/4rxXSz8raS

Read my full letter to FEMA urging it to provide the necessary exception to the Antideficiency Act for the #NFIP and all its functions: https://t.co/bTHiwFQWVX
Just last week, Congress specifically reauthorized the NFIP until May 31, 2019, for the precise reason of avoiding market interruption.
FEMA should resume sales of flood insurance policies immediately. #NFIP
As I communicated to FEMA yesterday, it makes no sense to stop selling flood insurance policies until the interruption cascades to a level where a there is a clear impact on the housing market. Only in Washington would this seem like a good idea.
With Washington Democrats choosing to shut down part of the federal government instead of voting to fund stronger border security measures, one consequence of their obstruction is the interruption of funding to FEMA, which administers the National Flood Insurance Program (#NFIP).
Securing the border is about more than stopping illegal immigration, it’s also about stopping deadly drugs from coming into our country. 		From Oct 2017 - July 2018, border agents seized:		6,423 pounds of cocaine	532 pounds of heroin	10,382 pounds of meth	332 pounds of fentanyl

A few Democrats campaigned this year on building the wall and securing the border. Did they mean it?
Senate Democrats have a very simple choice to make today. Either they will vote to keep the government open and secure our border, or they will vote for open borders, drug trafficking, and a government shutdown.
@neff630 @21GuNS69X2 @Bean9198 I was headed to the New Orleans airport. I'm flying to DC for the Senate vote to keep the whole government open and fund the wall.

Whatever the courts do, Republicans and Democrats should work together on solutions that are constitutional and provide access to quality, affordable health care.

So many families are better off thanks to the tax cuts passed by Republicans. Just one example: over 21,000 Louisiana Walmart and Sam's Club employees received bonuses of up to $1,000, and over 18,000 workers received a raise.		https://t.co/hpJ5NwfY9M
Democrats may want to protect the status quo, but I do not believe Americans have to be stuck forever with high deductibles, eye-popping premiums and fewer choices.		We can pass solutions that protect people with pre-existing conditions and lower health care costs for families.
Many people with pre-existing conditions have been losers under Obamacare.		One Colorado woman had been covered by a high-risk pool for years, but her insurance plan was canceled under Obamacare. "My old plan was almost a third of what I have to pay now," she said.
Republicans supported these protections then, and they continue to support them now. 		The truth is this: We don't have to protect all 961 pages of Obamacare to protect people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/fpAulyt1i4
Here's the truth: everyone — Republicans and Democrats — support protecting people with pre-existing conditions.		That's why Obama credited John McCain in 2009 for a “good idea” to protect people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/PqXHQ5yap3

Thank you for having me this morning, @KNOE8! I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the historic passage of our legislation to combat the opioid crisis, and how we are one step closer to defeating the scourge of addiction in America. https://t.co/DXeZIP9MuH
How do we solve the #OpioidCrisis? We decrease the amount of drugs coming into our country, give law enforcement the tools they need, and make treatment more available.

That’s silly. We don’t have to protect Obamacare to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Americans don’t have to be stuck forever with high deductibles, eye-popping premiums, and fewer choices.	Check out my op-ed published by @CNN to learn more: https://t.co/fpAulyt1i4
The fact is, Democrats are using the nine pages of Obamacare that deal with pre-existing conditions—just nine pages!—to defend the entire law. All 961 pages of it.
Republicans supported these protections then &amp; continue to support them now. The reason Democrats are claiming otherwise &amp; trying to rewrite history is simple. They’re trying to protect the status quo created by Obamacare &amp; set the stage for a single payer health care system.
When Democrats presented the framework of Obamacare in September 2009, the Republican response laid out “four important areas where we can agree.” The very first one was that “All individuals should have access to coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions.”
Way back in 2009, Republicans proposed a health care plan “to guarantee all Americans, regardless of pre-existing conditions or past illnesses, have access to affordable coverage.”
In '96, Republicans controlled the House &amp; Senate &amp; passed the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act, ultimately signed into law. It “strictly limit[ed] the ability of insurance companies to deny coverage to Americans with preexisting conditions," per @WashingtonPost.
On Democrats’ latest bogus health care claim that Republicans want to take away health insurance protections for people with #PreExistingConditions:

Senator Diane Feinstein should be asked under oath whether she violated Dr. Ford's confidentiality by leaking her letter to the media. We need to know whether Senate Democrats and their operatives coordinated to smear Judge Kavanaugh. #ConfirmKavanaugh https://t.co/kaLQdoHe3s
What Senate Democrats really want is more time to smear Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the toll it takes on his wife, his daughters, and our country.		Check out the rest of my op-ed here: https://t.co/Lk7d8R1YwZ #ConfirmKavanaugh
That is why any FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett #Kavanaugh should include potential coordination between the Democrat operatives and lawyers that assisted in bringing them forth.
If they were, they would have alerted law enforcement months ago, as soon as they learned of the claims. Instead, they waited until the last minute to leak them in order to delay the vote.
Just like their other tactics throughout this confirmation process, Senate Democrats’ demands for an FBI investigation have never been about getting the facts or finding the truth.
