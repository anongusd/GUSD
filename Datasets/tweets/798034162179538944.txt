@gfeldman74 @NoelHunter77 @GtPuffer @SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @realDonaldTrump Wrong. The Dems are in charge when they leave or refuse to go to negotiations. They refused again today.
@GtPuffer @NoelHunter77 @gfeldman74 @SenSchumer @JudiciaryDems @realDonaldTrump How much did they 'raise' for this 'charity' and where did the money actually go??	@POTUS forgave ALL of PR'S Debt to USA AND sent money, food and water, plus ships to help with the sick. The money disappeared and food &amp; water was found left in allys, people never received it.
