@Dart_Adams Carolco Pictures had the film rights after Orion, then they went bankrupt so the rights went back to Marvel. then Donner bough the film rights in '94 for Fox with having been impressed by the cartoon produced by Fox Kids.
@Dart_Adams 1984 with Orion Pictures, with James Cameron producing and Kathryn Bigelow directing. then Stan Lee mentioned Spider-Man during the talks and Cameron expressed having more interest in making that film.
@Dart_Adams yup
@Dart_Adams no, Wolverine. his performance in The Long Good Friday is what got them thinking about casting him.
@Dart_Adams bob hoskins (5'6") name was floating around when kathryn bigelow was in talks direct an x-men flick in the 90s...
@JenovaSeven @Dart_Adams best character study of James Howlett on film wasn't even put out by fox as well. the Revenant was more akin to Marvel Comics Presents #93 - #97 than most fox/marvel films are to the books.. https://t.co/EZwrAVSRtC
@JenovaSeven @Dart_Adams same story arc for both of his wolverine films though. first 2 parts are decent then the film takes a hard left turn in the 3rd act.
@_rerunvanpelt @Dart_Adams she has a cameo but don't expect anything from it.
@Dart_Adams kinberg might be the only filmmaker who has done the "hold my beer..." to himself. this is just underwhelming and a mess - should of been shelved instead of the new mutants.

@vurnt22 unfortunately that won't save a simon kinberg formulaic fan fiction script.

@hoodopulence @treymangum no talk of recasting out there. word on the street is they are reworking 40/50% of the film, shoehorning in a character from another film and big changes behind the camera...
@Dart_Adams nope. that's not gonna happen with anya taylor-joy not returning as illyana after the first film (if it even comes out at this point).
@MOVIEFAN99_ @weiser_david i haven't heard specifics on that. it's sounding like boone's new mutants = trank's fantastic four unfortunately.
@MOVIEFAN99_ @weiser_david word on the streets is a new character is being shoehorned in, between 40-50% of the movie is being changed up as well...there's talk of big changes behind the camera as well.

@DaUrleeByrd i was running out of space for arnold (his deadman was awesome), most don't include him. not sure about that or if they were x-men heads, one to ponder.
@DaUrleeByrd terps are what's up! :)
@DaUrleeByrd right on. so you read "lifedeath" by claremont and windsor-smith? have you checked the third act called "Adastra in Africa" by windsor-smith?	(sidenote: nice to see someone tweeitng about myrcene)
@DaUrleeByrd ororo is extremely important. that's why the marriage was a bad call and completely pulled her out of character. plus it marks time which doesn't help in the comic world. plus who gets top billing between those two?
@DaUrleeByrd @DiggsWayne one way to look at it is jack created the comics/characters/stories early on, stan created the business. stan would edit jack's stories to fit what the fans wanted and also ignored a lot of kirby's notes. 	(never a fan of t'challa &amp; ororo, reginald hudlin created that silliness)
@DaUrleeByrd @DiggsWayne Jack Kirby wrote/created the Black Panther, not Stan Lee (he had some input). there have been a couple iterations of the character over the years, lots of elements from Don McGregor's run (Killmonger &amp; M'Baku) &amp; Christoher Priest's (Dora Milaje &amp; Everett ross) were in the film.
