I am humbled by the support of my colleagues &amp; excited to get to work reforming the @HouseAppropsGOP into one that prioritizes Members &amp; delivers results for the American people. In an era of divided government, our committee will play a vital role in advancing GOP priorities.
I offer my condolences to the entire Bush family on the loss of former President George H.W. Bush. He led a life of service, and his leadership made the world safer and freer. He led his life with such dignity and honor -- we could all learn from his example.

ENERGY: Opened Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), one of the largest untapped conventional oilfields in North America, to help keep energy affordable.

A copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers October 3, 2018 statement can be found here: https://t.co/OVmuKiOtFi cc: @USACE_FortWorth
Nor is it a secret that as a result of recent Hurricane recovery and relief efforts being stretched thin over the past two years, the current federal budget is step-funding (using incremental appropriation) for its other flood-control and water infrastructure projects.
Clearly, it is no secret that such funding will be spread over several years to match the progress of the state and local government partners as in the pending completion by TxDOT on the project's new bridges.
The Trinity River Vision flood control project is both strongly supported by the Corps and has received Congressional approval (2016) for matching federal funding ($526 million).
This statement from the Corps is appreciated as it clarifies any misleading interpretations caused by Wednesday's McClatchy Fort Worth Star-Telegram article.
In the October 3, 2018 statement released by Corps, they declare: "The Trinity River Vision/Central City project continues to embody the vision of safety for the people of North Texas through the flood risk management and ecosystem improvement missions of the Corps."
Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers once again strongly affirmed its commitment to the Trinity River Vision flood control project and acknowledged that it is authorized for federal funding in this coming year's 2019 Energy and Water Development Act.

I worked in lockstep with @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis to ensure this bill provides the critical-funding needed to implement the new National Defense Strategy, and to continue rebuilding our armed forces.

We were blunt in our conversations with the Russians; we expressed our grave concerns about their policies and explained that any involvement in our elections is unacceptable.  We stated that we can be competitors without being adversaries.
The goal of these meetings was to begin addressing several of the geopolitical challenges facing the US relationship with Russia, including our differences in Syria, Ukraine, the Russian interference in the 2016 election and US sanctions on Russia.

Rest assured I will continue to work on this crisis.  I am hopeful that this week the House will pass a bill that keeps families together, strengthens our borders, and reforms our broken immigration system.
I have been working with House Republican leadership to resolve this in a way that protects our borders and our values. I, along with my colleagues, met with President Trump and he said he is 1000% with us and agrees these children must be protected.
After my personal experience of traveling to the border and to the countries where most of the immigrants were originating, it was clear to me that we had a humanitarian crisis on our hands.  I will say again what I said then, this urgent crisis must be dealt with immediately.
In 2014, I led a Border Crisis Working Group to understand the facts of the situation at the southern border.
People in my District are very concerned about this issue and so am I. There needs to be a better way to secure our borders that doesn’t tear apart families. These children did not make the choice to cross the border and shouldn’t be punished for it.

I hope the Senate will pass this bill as soon as possible so that the president can sign these historic spending cuts into law. I urge all members to support this common sense proposal.
It also no longer rescinds funding for Hurricane Sandy victims.
This bill is a welcome step to cut wasteful spending and restore fiscal sanity to Washington. Importantly, the rescissions package on the floor today no longer rescinds Ebola funding. Sadly, that horrible virus has recently returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I understand more than most that President Trump’s proposal rescinding nearly $15 billion is necessary.	It’s common sense that money sitting in federal coffers and not being spent should be returned to the treasury.
We must always be careful stewards of the taxpayer’s hard-earned money. That’s why I was proud to sign on as an original co-sponsor of President Trump’s rescissions package.

On this day in 1836, the Texas militia famously shouted “Remember the Alamo!” while attacking Santa Anna’s Army. The Battle of San Jacinto was the final battle of the Texas Revolution, and Texas soon after gained its independence from Mexico.
Today, Texas celebrates San Jacinto Day. San Jacinto Day commemorates the decisive victory by General Sam Houston and the Texas militia at the Battle of San Jacinto.

Thank you all for your support of this vital legislation
After talking with Secretary Mattis, we included new flexibility for @DeptofDefense to ensure that these funds were able to be spent in the smartest way possible while still maintaining stringent oversight.
By the time this agreement is enacted, @DeptofDefense will have around 5 months to spend the money. I was very concerned that this short time frame could lead to poor spending decisions.
We also funded programs to protect and defend Israel including: 	✔️Anti-tunneling initiatives; and 	✔️The Israeli cooperative missile defense programs.
Our military must be ready for future threats.  The @DeptofDefense must look five, ten and twenty years ahead to make sure we have the weapons systems we need.
This agreement funds 14 Navy ships, including:	✔️One carrier replacement,	✔️3 littoral combat ships, 	✔️2 guided missile destroyers, 	✔️Two attack submarines, and 	✔️Full funding to continue the Ohio replacement submarine program.
This agreement makes investments into vital aircraft including:	✔️Joint strike fighters	✔️Super hornets	✔️Apaches	✔️Chinooks	✔️Lakotas	✔️V-22 ospreys	✔️Black hawks, and 	✔️C-130s
The omnibus provides a total of $654 billion for fiscal year 2018. This is $23 billion above the president’s request, and $61 billion over last year.
I worked closely with Secretary Mattis to ensure this bill provides him with the resources he needs to implement the new national defense strategy and restore our military.
Since becoming chair, it has been my goal to ensure that this bill reflects the needs of our defense and intelligence experts so that they have the resources needed to combat the threats of today and in the future.
As chair of the Defense @HouseAppropsGOP Subcommittee, I want to start by thanking all of you who voted for the budget agreement that enabled us to make the largest investment in our military in 15 years

What tax reform means for Texas via https://t.co/MCiwriwUWS @HouseGOP #TaxCutsandJobsAct
This is a simple step that will have a profound impact. This is also a common-sense solution that goes beyond the debates over mental health and guns.  Let’s focus on stopping criminals with guns from entering our schools.  This plan will do just that.
My plan will: 	*Provide federal grant $ to school districts seeking to install metal detectors;	*Require any school receiving $ to limit entrances so that metal detectors provide protection;	*Require any school applying to work w/ local law enforcement 2 qualify for the grant.
When we decided to make airports safe from armed terrorists, we installed metal detectors and dramatically increased safety. It’s time we did the same thing for our schools. By helping local schools purchase metal detectors we can stop the scourge of violence in our schools.
Yesterday, I announced plans to introduce legislation that will encourage local school districts to buy and install metal detectors at all local schools -&gt; https://t.co/NjSzyq6Uqs
Over his lifetime, Rev. Graham met presidents and world leaders, but he never lost the common touch. To his family and friends, you are in my thoughts and prayers.

As you may have heard, this morning a train carrying Republican lawmakers to a conference in West Virginia collided with a truck. Sadly, it appears that at least one person has died.
I share the president’s determination to rebuild our military forces. All federal dollars are not the same. We need to prioritize our national security in an increasingly dangerous world. #SOTU
As Chairwoman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I Iook forward to working with the president to give our military leaders the sufficient, sustainable, and stable funding they have told us – over and over again – that they need. #SOTU
My bill provides more than $60B more for our nation’s defense than we spent last year. It also takes care of our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen by fully funding a 2.4 percent pay increase. In an increasingly dangerous world, we need to prioritize our national security.
This afternoon, the House passed my bill to fully fund our nation’s armed forces at levels recommended by our military leaders. This is the third time we have passed this legislation. It's past time that this essential, must-pass funding bill for our military be enacted into law.

Congress has finally delivered on the promise of tax reform, and I am proud to have supported this historic tax bill.
There has been a lot of mischaracterization of what this bill does, but the American people will know the truth when they start to see more money in their paychecks as early as February of next year.
Businesses will be able to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers.
This legislation delivers real relief to businesses by lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. In fact, it reduces taxes on small businesses to the lowest they’ve been in 40 years.
It also allows Texans to write off up to $10,000 of their property taxes.
With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059. The bill also expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children.
The bill nearly doubles the standard tax deduction and reduces loopholes, while preserving important tax breaks such as the teacher tax deduction for classroom expenses.
In addition, this legislation not only protects current American jobs but also encourages companies who have moved overseas to come home and bring jobs back to Texas.
Today, the House passed the most sweeping, pro-growth tax reform since President Reagan. These tax cuts will ensure Texans keep more of their hard earned money.
