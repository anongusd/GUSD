‚ÄúBy blindly accepting the Government‚Äôs misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the Court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu.‚Äù
The Justices draw a parallel between this case and Korematsu v. United States, in which the govt similarly ‚Äúinvoked an ill-defined national-security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweeping proportion...rooted in dangerous stereotypes about a particular group.‚Äù
The dissent calls out the Court for upholding religious freedom‚Äîjust a month ago‚Äîin Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which the Court found ‚Äúless pervasive official expressions of hostility and the failure to disavow them‚Äù to be constitutional.
The ‚Äúwindow dressing‚Äù of national security concerns ‚Äúcannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the president and his advisers create the strong perception that the proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers.‚Äù
