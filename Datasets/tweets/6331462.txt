Coffee and sunshine. Hello, Saturday. https://t.co/tCXq6kx9GP
@themoko There are awesome starter ultra runs, like a 50k (30 mile) that get you used to the community and are a great intro to the sport. I dread the idea of a road race marathon (all that pavement and no breaks) but find trail running for much longer distances so much more approachable.
@themoko I know it sounds really far out, but imagine an all-day hike. It’s like that. But jogging. And you eat and drink along the way.
@themoko I’ve done 50 miles so this will be new ground for me! Wanna join?
Throwing this out there for anyone up for a wild, and long, running adventure: sign up for the Miwok 100k is tomorrow. It’s early May—so 5 months to train. I’m going to sign up for the lottery and try! 💫 #ultrarunning

@kenkeiter Good point. You just build an economic incentive into the protocol.
But who will handle custody and possession? If a piece of art, for ex, is co-owned by 100 token holders....where it’s hung and viewed can be resolved through a governance protocol....but who physically enforces that? You will need a centralized company to manage this, right?
I would love perspectives on a space I’m trying to fully understand: tokenization of real world hard assets IMHO is one of the most exciting aspects of the promise of crypto. Everyone can have economic exposure to illiquid assets available now to relatively few.

@mdudas @starkness @cdixon Thanks Mike.
Doing final prep 📝 for our crypto event on Thursday. I’m so psyched to talk to @starkness &amp; @cdixon about the broader theme of decentralization. For those interested, any specific questions you want covered? (We’re not live-streaming but will hopefully share the video later).
@cynthiag @pivotal wow, what a huge day! Congrats Cynthia!
.@Jessicalessin’s most recent post reminded me its a good time to point out how impressed I am by the company she’s building and the trailblazing work she’s done. From articles to events to a bootcamp for building subscription based media companies....and more to come no doubt.

@karanortman Thanks for the nice feedback. I think there's an unfortunate business norm / expectation that negotiation has to be adversarial and leverage based instead of collaborative and principles based.
@JDcarlu @Stanford I touched on something similar -- the difference between reading a headline about an acquisition and knowing the challenging story behind the scenes for an entrepreneur.
@karanortman This is why it's such a differentiator!
@DilaUdum @HelloAngels @ECorner So nice to meet you. Thanks for the feedback!
@alexisylchan That is a high compliment. Thank you!
Beautiful day on campus. Putting the finishing touches on my talk. Thanks for the many great suggestions last night! https://t.co/m5090IZ5HK
Never underestimate the value of building trust w/ someone by being honest and forthright in a negotiation, especially when it’s a high stakes, fast and competitive circumstance. I’ve seen this play out so many times in M&amp;A. Short term wins w a low integrity approach always sour.
Also glad to see @coinbase headhunting so many badass executive women. 		In just the last three months: 		- @tinab, VP Ops &amp; Tech	- @emiliemc, VP Corp Dev &amp; Biz Dev	- @RachaelRad, VP Comms		And hopefully even more to come.
Delighted for Coinbase as they bring on @RachaelRad as VP of Comms. This is an incredibly important and exciting role for telling the broader story of crypto, in addition to the company, and Rachael will be fantastic. https://t.co/UyoYNGBJBL

Now I’m looking forward to the holidays and perhaps a literal marathon, now that I have no excuses for not training. I’m excited to spend more time investing with @HelloAngels and figuring out what's next. I’ll be on the trails, in coffee shops, and of course on Twitter.
@CorpDev @smanak There are no founders I’m more grateful to than @jack and @ev. Working with them and the entire Twitter team has been an incredible privilege. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! 🙌🏼
Leading acquisitions is a joy, not a job. I will always appreciate the trust founders placed in me to be a partner through these important journeys. And @corpdev, you set the bar! Thank you for letting me be your teammate and leader with @smanak!
It’s impossible to sum up a journey that started with 34 ppl in a small office. My best memories aren’t the ones that made headlines, they're the unique human experiences of working w/ extraordinary people in pivotal moments of building a company. Twitter has been full of them!
But now I’m ready to take time off, recharge, and figure out what’s next. I’m resigning from my role as VP of Corporate Development &amp; Strategy and transitioning out over the holidays.
They say start-ups are a marathon, not a sprint. At Twitter, I feel like I’ve been sprinting an ultra marathon for 8.5 years and it’s been the most exhilarating, dynamic, and rewarding run of my life.
@BrianTolkin @sacca Totally. I’ve even found it useful for personal decisions.
@sacca Agreed. We try to make the written memo the connonical document of record. Then adapt it to a preso with a small # of slides for preso if necessary. Sometimes amazon style “library” reading time in the meeting.

One ex of how proprietary data sets &amp; ML create competitive advantage: Tesla could price insurance for their owners much better than any existing company. They may not want to build an insurance co bc it’s an antagonistic relationship w customers, but they have the data to do it. https://t.co/7mSkYilSNK
For a deal thesis (or really any idea or decision that needs to be well articulated, substantiated, and thorough), I’ve found written documents to be a much better format than slides. It forces more precision and is much easier to later reference without context.
