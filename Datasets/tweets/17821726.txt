@maddow @MissButter You should take a look at Devin Nunes district and the ballots not yet counted @Maddow.  Margin of victory as of last night approx 16,000 votes.  Uncounted ballots (provisional and absentee) in Tulare and Fresno counties:  at least 140,000 as of last night.  WTF. https://t.co/FSXa7BsjS5
@MissButter NUNES LEAD IS LESS THAN 17,000 AS OF LAST NIGHT.
@MissButter One location had almost as many provisional ballots as regular ballots cast by 9 am!!  I am trying to escalate, but not sure anyone quite gets: these late ballots and provisional ballots skew heavily DEM and Latino.  There are MORE THAN 140,000 OF THEM OUTSTANDING.
@MissButter It's easy to declare victory and what, stop counting?  or lose ballots?  This is completely unacceptable. I was at 6 precincts on election day and the turnout was historic -per poll workers.  More ballots had to be delivered.  Tons of first time voters had to vote provisional too
@MissButter Oh, and 21 is even closer (TJ Cox) but republican claimed victory even with those 100,000 ballots not counted in Fresno County.  Tulare County is refusing to update its tally of VBM and MBPs -- not to mention provisional ballots --- by phone or on website. https://t.co/Aw9ezfUbpk
