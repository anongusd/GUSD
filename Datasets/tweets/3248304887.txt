@JustTomEdwards @TeamDean @DeanHeller @RanaLV The #CadillacTax doesn’t actually “PAY” for the ACA. Revenues collected would go to the general fund. Employers will cut plans and shift costs to workers before paying the tax. It’s a tax on 181M Americans with job-based coverage. It’s a tax on women. It’s a tax on the sick.
@CurmudgeonCD21 @EliseStefanik The “Cadillac Tax” doesn’t hit until 2023, it doesn’t “pay” for the healthcare of those with ACA coverage, it ONLY serves as a punitive tax on 181 million Americans who get their health care through their employer.  The #CadillacTax is driving US healthcare in the wrong direction

.@voxdotcom Missed the key point here: The ACA's looming 40% #CadillacTax is forcing employers to reduce benefits and increase deductibles to avoid triggering the tax. It is time for Congress to repeal the #CadillacTax! @dylanlscott @sarahkliff https://t.co/uHpZjz8b89
@voxdotcom The ACA's 40% #CadillacTax on employer-provided health care coverage  is driving employers to increase deductibles so they don't trigger the tax. 181 million Americans can't afford the higher deductibles caused by the #CadillacTax.
@ScottElliotG @ernietedeschi As long as the "Cadillac Tax" is on the books, employers will make benefits design changes to avoid the tax--and their planning window is at least 18-24 months out, sometimes longer. So the #CadillacTax is having a REAL and harmful impact on the pocketbooks of working Americans.
Employers moved to high deductible health plans to avoid triggering the 40% #CadillacTax....and then they realized workers couldn't afford those high deductibles.  Read: High-Deductible Health Plans Fall From Grace In Employer-Based Coverage https://t.co/A7wLNQJA0X
