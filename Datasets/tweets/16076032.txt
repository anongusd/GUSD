@BuckSexton The podcast of @JeremyScahill has done a couple of great episodes laying out the case against it - here (https://t.co/45IzeUhTWO) &amp; here (https://t.co/xKgSwUTbPu)
@BuckSexton I don't want to debate it on Twitter but a) the motives of US in interfering in Venezuela has been admirably candid (to get better access to its oil markets for US companies) &amp; 2) the history of US intervention of these sorts is disastrous for everyone involved, especially there.
@cirezmind Сейчас есть хорошее лекарство, которое лечит паранойю и заблуждение.
@I_heart_lies @ztimashi LOL. It was a cover story in a major news magazine, promoted by one of the largest media companies in the world on their network. How many people watched it on YouTube is a tiny fraction of those who heard it. And it's just one example. There are many others.
@AutisticMerit Yep - spinning conspiracy theories to convert a major power into a US Enemy while allowing almost no dissent or challenge to their CIA-driven narratives. Done by the same people who love to accuse others of acting as "State TV" and propagandists.
The gap between a) how much time and energy CNN &amp; MSNBC have devoted to pushing maximalist Trump/Russia conspiracy theories &amp; b) how much space they've given to skeptics and critics of those theories is mammoth. The only thing rarer there are critics of Venezuela regime change: https://t.co/Rj49r1NEKP

@BradWesley17 Yes, but the officials who have led the way in trying to prosecute Assange and vowing to do it aren't career, mid-level FBI agents (who, under Obama, decided they couldn't), but Trump's handpicked cabinet members: Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions.
@DanDanUniverse @John_VanAmburg There are widespread demands from prominent Dems for Assange and WikiLeaks' prosecution by the Trump DOJ for publishing docs. His reasoning, which appeared in my timeline, was illustrative of that mentality https://t.co/vu64j40NS5
1) Assange is an agent of Russia.	2) Putin controls Trump.	3) I stand with Trump and his administration as they try to prosecute Assange &amp; WikiLeaks for publishing docs.		If this is your thought process, it's plagued by multi-level incoherence.

@TerryUofM @ryangrim If Assange is on "Putin's team," and Putin controls Trump, has your brain ever asked you: why is Trump's DOJ trying to prosecute and imprison Assange?
@Deviled_Egg_666 Multiple subpoenas have been served on people connected with WikiLeaks' pre-2016 publication, including Chelsea Manning, and the US Government inadvertently admitted it has a sealed indictment of Assange.
@SethMcNeil5 Maybe nobody with a minimally rational mind should want the Trump administration or the US Government under any president deciding what does and does not constitute "actual journalism."
@IndySammons @wikileaks Because the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and large parts of the DOJ have long been obsessed with punishing WL &amp; Assange for exposing US war crimes and Trump either lacks the ability or the willingness to stop them. He's spoken often of a desire to restrict press freedoms.

No hatred for WikiLeaks or Assange should cause people to unite behind Trump &amp; those who want to criminalize reporting by cheering, or even ignoring, the Trump DOJ's prosecution of WL: which press groups, media outlets &amp; even the Obama DOJ all warned would threaten press freedom.
Exactly. It's stunning that people have spent two years parading around as gravely worried about Trump's threats to a free press because of mean tweets, while an actual, grave threat - his DOJ's prosecution of WL for *publishing docs* - is being largely ignored if not cheered. https://t.co/wdjHxSzDkr
@dmar16 @maddow i'm suggesting that converting American liberalism into a movement that loves, admires and reveres *the FBI*, while having extremely rich media liberal stars encouraging ordinary liberals to use their personal funds to support its leaders, is a destructive and unhealthy trend.
@LukewSavage First #Resistance in history that venerates security state agencies and their leaders (along with their neocon cheerleaders like Frum). It's amazing how profitable the #Resistance scam has been.
@to_terrapin That liberals now think that criticizing the FBI makes you sound like a "Trumpista" is (a) true and (b) exactly the point I was making.
@BurdenOrAGift @maddow Yes, that was back in the day when I really loved and worshipped the FBI and devoted myself to raising money for their top officials. What happened to me???? Must be kompromot.
McCabe's book is pitched as being at least as much as about re-building reverence for the FBI and an attempt to venerate its nobility &amp; value as it is attacking Trump, though both themes are top #Resistance values so it's not surprising it's generating so much profit for him: https://t.co/qzyAh2700t

Carnaval, now taking place in Brazil, has traditionally included all kinds of political messaging. Its core attribute is free expression of all types. This year, the military police in Belo Horizante threatened participants denouncing Bolsonaro to cease https://t.co/ajR5zUPFqK
Put another way: one's views on militarism, imperialism, taxation, capitalism, socialism &amp; the like are ideological matters that determine one's ideological identity. That's not true of one's views on whether the Trump/Russia obsession was rooted in rationality or delusion.
Whether one believed all along that there was sufficient evidence to prove Trump officials criminally conspired with Russia over the election has always been an evidentiary - not an ideological - question, and the conflating of that is a reflection of toxic tribalistic blindness.
@HeerJeet @mtracey @johannhari101 Fair enough.

@HeerJeet @mtracey @johannhari101 I agree with that: he's a much more heterodox, independent, non-tribalistic and critical thinker than the standard partisan pundit, which makes him more interesting.

@gin_and_tacos The conflation of evidentiary questions (did Trump officials criminally conspire with Russia or is that just a dangerous distraction from actual problems?) with ideological ones requires so much (obvious) intellectual incoherence that no words suffice to ridicule it.

@rtyson82 @carlbildt Sanctions on EU oligarchs and expulsion of EU diplomats, to start. Probably should allocate a few billion for counter-propaganda against EU meddling. And cyber-defenses.
@TimShelley7 Why hasn't Mueller indicted Manafort or Gates for criminally conspiring with Russia to influence the 2016 election?
Writing from France, long-time EU official @carlbildt decided to try to meddle in the 2020 US election by implying pretty strongly that Bernie Sanders was a fan of the Soviet Union and Communism and got special access ("lucky to be able to get to") from the Kremlin. #Meddling https://t.co/0ODkHW9fbV
True. Also, I'm not sure if I mentioned this yet, but after almost two years of the Mueller investigation, the number of Americans thus far indicted for criminally conspiring with Russia to influence the 2016 election is zero.

This slimy rhetorical tactic was also invoked throughout the Cold War, including by McCarthy: anyone who challenged US propaganda about the Russians or who advocated better relations with Moscow was accused of being a supporter of the Kremlin. Sadly, this is still in use.
By this reasoning, anyone opposed to US regime change operations to topple the despotic Saudi monarchy is a fan of Mohammed bin Salman. How can you support someone like this who imprisons dissidents, murders journalists, and has created mass starvation in Yemen?
This is exactly right. They accused opponents of the Iraq War of supporting Saddam. They accused opponents of US involvement in the war in Libya of supporting Gaddafi. They accuse opponents of US intervention in Syria of being pro-Assad. Same scummy tactic now used for Maduro: https://t.co/d9p9Mz4dka

If Democrats generally were willing to criticize their party and their leaders when they take bad positions - the way Sanders supporters this week aggressively criticized Bernie on Venezuela - the party &amp; its leaders would be much better, more responsive, healthier &amp; stronger.
As @DavidKlion said, the anger of Sanders supporters over his Venezuela positions should forever put to rest the bullshit claim that Bernie supporters are a "cult." They support him because of ideological agreement &amp; have always criticized him when they disagree. That's healthy.
1) @MattDuss has done vital work in vastly improving Bernie's foreign policy (on Israel/Palestine, Saudi, intervention/war generally); 2) They've stumbled on their Venezuela messaging, likely know that, &amp; there's nothing wrong with saying so: he's a politician &amp; should be pushed: https://t.co/bciD1jy1mQ

@ThePlumLineGS Right. I think it's both impractical &amp; unethical to propose a plan to suppress and ignore truthful and highly newsworthy information about a candidate who is trying to seek one of the most powerful positions on the planet - especially for news outlets but also candidates.
@ThePlumLineGS Yes. I've been advocated that for more than a decade on the ground one day someone like Trump may occupy the Oval Office and still fully support those (and many other) limits on executive power.
@SPMaxdOut The WikiLeaks emails weren't "disinformation" either. The were real and led to the resignation of the top 5 DNC officials and the firing of Donna Brazille. But you should try reading Biden's proposal again since you didn't understand it: https://t.co/FM9LAy9cok
@ThePlumLineGS What is your view on whether news outlets should publish or report documents of the kind I described? As for candidate use: we disagree. I think relevant information that sheds important light on someone seeking an office this powerful should be discussed regardless of its source
So if Ukrainian, Chinese or Iranian hackers succeed in getting hold of Trump's tax returns or incriminating emails by digitally breaking into servers, no candidates should talk about those documents, and no media outlets should publish or report on them?

@james_moberly Exactly. Because I believe in the principle of talking to people even when you don't agree with them and they say bad things, because of the benefits it provides to talk to their audience. I'm talking about those who say they don't agree with that view yet appear on Maher's show.

Mueller one day may finally indict an American for criminal election-conspiring with Russia. Possible. And Manafort is dirtbag who belongs in prison.

@RussPtacek That's because you were contesting the validity of my opinion ("you're wrong"), not claiming I'm knowingly spreading a factually false claim (which is called a "lie"). Thank you for the nice words about the picture.
@RussPtacek Yes, errors can be made without being "lies." But once a major news outlet details the error &amp; apologizes for spreading it, it becomes a "lie" for other outlets to keep repeating it - unless you work for Putin, in which case you'll think it's fine. https://t.co/AwzkxgZU8V
Yes, I praised the @CBC for admitting that it spread false claims about the closing of this bridge, and detailed why the story was false. Despite this great act of journalism, CNN (&amp;, as you say, the Brazilian press) continue to spread the lie about this bridge; https://t.co/sIMMzAKvzw
@bklyn_g Actually, Brazil is America. It's true, however, that it's not the United States. I'm not sure what point you thought you were making by pointing this out but I'm quite sure there was nothing benevolent or noble about it, especially since you analogized it to being in purgatory.
@bklyn_g The number of progressives who speak of living in Brazil like it's some horrific punishment or crime against patriotism, while simultaneously pretending to find Trump's xenophobia offensive, has always been interesting to me and still is.

@joshua__frank @Kittfornow @emptywheel @yodermon Both CNN and WPost have reported in the last several days that Mueller is preparing to close his investigation. Facts about what it has - and has not - produced thus far are relevant and noteworthy for very obvious reasons.
@RealMattCassell @JustinHornkohl @emptywheel @yodermon I said from the start - before Mueller was even appointed - that I expected that Manafort would end up being convicted on financial charges unrelated to conspiring with Russia over the election. March, 2017 https://t.co/YBsDLkJUW6 https://t.co/72T0eXmWHc
@joshua__frank @Kittfornow @emptywheel @yodermon For the last time: I can't talk about invisible things. I can only talk about visible things. And of the visible things: we have CNN &amp; WPost reporting Mueller is about to close up even though we have no known indictments of Americans for criminal election-conspiring with Russia.
@JustinHornkohl @emptywheel @yodermon LOL - literally - that whether Mueller charged any Americans for criminally conspiring with Russia over the 2016 election is just a side 'technicality." That was the primary point of why he existed!
One of the most inspiring anti-corporatist and anti-war voices in Congress, @RoKhanna, will be co-national chair for the Bernie Sanders campaign, alongside the consistently great @NinaTurner and @CarmenYulinCruz  https://t.co/XQtXapjGso
@JustinHornkohl @emptywheel @yodermon A major part of Mueller's responsibility and reason for existing, at least as I (and many others) understood it, was to charge, indict and prosecute any Americans who criminally conspired with Russia over the election. That was, in my view, central to his mandate, not ancillary.
@JustinHornkohl @emptywheel @yodermon I'm not talking about the report (since we haven't seen it). I'm talking about the known indictments and convictions Mueller has obtained. And what I'm saying - and what is undeniably true, no matter how upsetting - is that *none* is for criminal election-conspiring with Russia.
@emptywheel @yodermon I understand that Trump/Russia has been a religion for many people for the last 2 years &amp; are now angry that Mueller may end with no Americans indicted for criminally conspiring over the election. It's not my fault but it's OK that anger is directed at me for pointing it out.
@joshua__frank @emptywheel @yodermon I've repeatedly said anything in the future is possible. Mueller might have a secret plan to imprison Trump Jr and Jared and even Pence &amp; Nunes. But speculating about what might happen in the future is the business of people with a crystal ball. Journalists talk about known facts
@emptywheel @yodermon I'll ask again: are you claiming that Manafort was criminally charged with conspiring with Russians to help influence the outcome of the 2016 election and was convicted of that?
@TimothyRaben @emptywheel @yodermon It's affecting the sentencing because Manafort was found to have lied about it, not because the act itself was found to be criminal. It's the same issue with the Flynn, Stone and other cases: the accused crime is the lying, not the act itself.
@jmchao @emptywheel @yodermon It's bizarre how Trump/Russia fanatics love this analogy because it actually constitutes an implied concession that there isn't enough evidence to convict any Americans for criminally conspiring with Russia over the election, which seems like a major concession.
@emptywheel @yodermon And finally: I don't have a "last line of defense." I have one point &amp; one point only: if the Mueller investigation ends without further indictments, it will mean no Americans have been criminally charged with, or convicted of, conspiring with Russia over the election.
@emptywheel @yodermon Manafort wasn't charged with, or convicted of, criminally conspiring with Russia over the election. He was found to have lied about data. I know  people eager to press "like" on whatever you say so they can feel vindicated for the last 18 months, but that fact will never change.
@emptywheel @yodermon You're claiming that Manafort was criminally charged with conspiring with Russians to help influence the outcome of the 2016 election and was convicted of that?
@design__hole @emptywheel @yodermon I'm not interested in litigating specific legal briefs Marcy enjoys talking about because I don't regard them as significant &amp; don't regard Twitter as a constructive venue for them. I am interested in noting Mueller has indicted no Americans for election conspiring with Russia.
@emptywheel @yodermon When the Mueller investigation began, I regarded the central question, as did the consensus of commentary, as whether he would charge or indict any Americans for criminally conspiring with Russia over the 2016 election. He hasn't. If you want to say that's unimportant, feel free.
@emptywheel @yodermon Yes, if you want to create reasons, theories &amp; excuses why Mueller hasn't indicted anyone - including Manafort - for criminally conspiring with Russia on the election, I can't stop you. It doesn't change the fact that he hasn't, and that's a notable omission for obvious reasons.
@emptywheel @yodermon I'm quite aware of what you're referring to, Marcy. I'm not interested in using Twitter to litigate these issues. We've been told for 18 months that Mueller is highly trustworthy &amp; I'm simply noting what matters more than our tweets: what he's charged/indicted &amp; what he hasn't.
@Sr_Penalosa @mirikuincognito But he can indict Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Carter Page or anyone else for criminally conspiring with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Yet he hasn't - at least not yet. How come?
@mirikuincognito I'll try one last time. What prosecutors do is charge, indict and prosecute. Mueller is a prosecutor. Yet he hasn't charged, indicted or prosecuted a single American for conspiring (or "colluding") with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Can you process this fact?
@mirikuincognito Collusion isn't a legal term. That's why I didn't use it. But since you like it: Mueller hasn't yet indicted any Americans for colluding with Russians to influence the 2016 election. How come?
RT @Jbrous14: Obama library gonna have a drone wing?

@SouthernDem74 That's possible. We'll know tomorrow.
@TheWorldWatch My position has always been: if Mueller has evidence that any Americans criminally conspired with the Russians over the election (what people call "collusion"), then he should charge and indict them. He hasn't. How come?
@bmaz It could be leaked. But the question will always remain: if Mueller really did find such clear evidence of conspiracies, why didn't they result in indictments?
Anyway, since people like to use Twitter to claim others have been "wrong about everything" or claim self-vindication, my position *from the start* has been: we need a full, *transparent* investigation: not anonymous leaks. Let's see the Mueller report https://t.co/IB3u4hyA8o
LOL. Yeah, they're going to haul that one out, too: oh, don't worry that all the people we told you Mueller was going to imprison - Don Jr, Jared, Carter Page, Ivanka, etc - are still free. Mueller probably has *sealed indictments.* Anything to save face https://t.co/dOsCzG3A4L
There's already an effort underway to assure confused Dem partisans that the end of the Mueller investigation means nothing: oh, don't worry, Adam Schiff will take care of it. The SDNY will get them all. At least that's cogent fantasy. Insinuating Mueller was silenced is lunacy.
In 1973, Nixon's AG and Deputy AG both resigned because they were ordered to fire the Special Prosecutor and refused. Anyone suggesting that Mueller is being stymied and suppressed *but is remaining silent* about him is attributing to him a huge amount of cowardice &amp; corruption.
Dems like @RepSwalwell have spent 2 years advancing their career by swindling people to believe Mueller was coming to arrest Trump Jr, Jared &amp; bring down the Trump presidency. If it doesn't happen, their angry flock needs an explanation. So now we get new conspiracies.
Here, @RepSwalwell - as he's been doing for 2 years - spreads baseless insinuations, this time to suggest that Mueller is being involuntarily silenced, forced to end his investigation.

@OmanReagan If someone tries to enter a competition &amp; claims they're a woman but doesn't meet the biological standards set by the competition, you want them excluded and banned from the competition? What should those standards be?
@OmanReagan I'd like to ask you this question one last time in the hope that I can finally get an answer since it's - you know - the whole point of what Martina raised: if someone tries to enter a competition &amp; claims they're a woman but doesn't meet these standards, you want them excluded?
@antztru24 @NearlyTheNews Roger Stone is charged with lying to investigators, not with criminally conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 election. Mueller hasn't indicted any Americans - zero - on charges that they conspired with Russia to influence the election. That's just a fact.
@OmanReagan But different competitions have different entrance standards, &amp; different scientists advocate different tests. Are those validly debated? Also, to be clear: if someone tries to enter a competition &amp; claims they're a woman but doesn't meet these standards, you want them excluded?

@OmanReagan I think trans women are women. And I think trans men are men. And I know that has absolutely nothing to do with anything that's being discussed, and your fear of answering the question of whether you believe there should be entrance standards speaks volumes &amp; is sad.
@oshima9 @OmanReagan So do you think there should be standards that exclude certain athletes even though they self-identify as trans women and, if so, what standards should they be? Or should anyone who self-identifies as a trans women be allowed to compete? Are these questions validly debatable?
@pllski @blinds12345 "Conspiracy Against the US" is just a legal term that, in this case, means hiding assets and otherwise preventing the Treasury Dept from finding what belongs to it. It doesn't allege they conspired with Russians to interfere in the 2016 election. These are just facts.
@OmanReagan You're deliberately distorting the entire discussion by refusing to answer the question. I'll try it one more time. Martina asked: are there any standards for allowing entrance or does anyone who claims womanhood automatically get to participate? What's your answer?
@cann4ing @froomkin If Mueller were improperly ordered by Barr or anyone to stop his investigation or to refrain from doing what justice required, and he said nothing, then it'd mean he has no integrity. Nixon prosecutors resigned over that kind of interference. I'd not expect Mueller to be silent
@Paladiumcrayon @OmanReagan I'm not going to put up with any bullshit of people attributing to me arguments I haven't made. Martina's arguments aren't my argument. I've objected to her shunning, while making clear that I'm not adopting her views.
@froomkin Maybe, but I think the only thing Mueller could do that's truly "devastating to Team Trump" is present compelling evidence of conspiracy crimes relating to the election by his close circle, which will prompt the question: if he has that, why hasn't he indicted for that?
@OmanReagan First, you didn't answer my question. You just screamed "bigot." That's not remotely an answer to the question I asked. Second, I've made clear all day that Martina's arguments are not ones I share, so please stop falsely attributing them to me. Thank you.
I honestly think that if the Mueller investigation really does end next week as CNN and WashPost are claiming, and nothing major changes (such as, say, Trump Jr. or Jared's arrest), they should send therapy dogs to the MSNBC &amp; CNN headquarters to help with the coping process. https://t.co/rA8GiZ6Oz3
I would certainly hope, and expect, that if anyone forced Robert Mueller to end his investigation prematurely - meaning: before he was ready to do so or wanted to do so - that he would make that known. It'd be irresponsible if he didn't. There is zero sign of that: https://t.co/YLeE1HST6f
@pllski @blinds12345 Manafort was indicted for financial improprieties. Flynn was charged with lying to the FBI. Cohen was charged with campaign finance violations. None was charged with criminally conspiring with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election: the original Mueller mission.
@OmanReagan @DazzlyPants @Martina @ChrissieEvert Who has ever argued that being gay gives anyone a competitive advantage? Also, just to be clear: the original question Martina asked wa: should we have any entrance standards or is just claiming womanhood enough? What's your answer?
@blinds12345 LOL. Do you think Mueller has indicted Americans for criminally conspiring with Russians on the 2016 election?
@NearlyTheNews Thank you for the innovative, thought-provoking and deeply substantive contribution to the discussion.

@SiobhanFTB @TravisMannon @Martina I don't want to be put in the position of defending her arguments because they're not mine, but she talked in the article about how she *did* compete with a trans woman &amp; had no objection. Her concern seems to be lack of standards or inadequate standards that allow exploitation.
@SiobhanFTB @TravisMannon @Martina I'll grant it was unclear, but I disagree she called for a full ban. The Twitter discussion began with her asking whether there should be any standards &amp; what they should be, and the article discusses Renée Richards' playing in the WTA (though without a definitive conclusion).

That @RepAdamSchiff began attacking the Mueller investigation for timidity and inadequacy a couple of weeks ago signalled that this was coming. I think it's going to be deemed permissible - quite soon - to use Mueller's name in vain.

@TravisMannon @Martina No. There are ACLU lawyers who have spoken out publicly against, for instance, the ACLU's defense of the Charlottesville Nazis and I wouldn't support firing them (they weren't fired). If, say, an ACLU immigration rights lawyer advocated hate speech laws, I would feel the same.
@TravisMannon @Martina So there are trans people who say they are women who you want to be banned and excluded from female sporting events on the ground that they haven't complied with the standards you support?
@lgbtqfc I don't think it's clear she was advocating that, as opposed to questioning whether there are sufficient &amp; clear standards for when it's allowed. I'd agree that arguing for a complete ban on trans women in female sports would, aside by being bad, be inconsistent with that group.
@TravisMannon @Martina So what about an ACLU lawyer who uses their platform to advocate for speech restrictions (like the criminalization of hate speech) or attacks the provision of legal defense to hateful groups? Doesn't that matter your definition of when someone should be fired?
@britto_nando Eu não acho necessariamente ofensivo, apenas estranho e interessante. Definitivamente seria considerado ofensivo se feito com outros tipos de expressões idiomáticas.
@lgbtqfc I agree that people shouldn't be immune from criticism because of their prior work. But I think decades of *brave and self-sacrificing* life work for a cause should entitle someone to a presumption of good faith, noble intent, and an ability to learn and grow.
@lgbtqfc I agree. Just like you don't get to tell people what they should think and feel about the treatment of one of the LGBT's movements bravest and most iconic pioneers. That's what is called dialogue: nobody has to shut up; nobody dictates; people exchange viewpoints to learn.
Interesting: the original version of the NYT article on the Sanders announcement rendered his speech about wealth inequality in the idiom of a New Yorker (if not, specifically, a New York Jew). A subsequent version changed it without noting this:  https://t.co/RZXoaGQsKq https://t.co/ivBubS9DGg
@TravisMannon @Martina But the ACLU definites its mission as defending free speech for everyone. So if someone deviates from that core view - and says, for instance, that "hate speech" should be outlawed - they're dissenting from the ACLU's core view. Why can they remain?
@TravisMannon @Martina Do you believe there should be any standards or requirements at all for determining when trans women can enter female competitions? There's an active debate on what those standards should be &amp; that's what Martina was addressing. What's your view on that?

The point, of course, is *every* political faction contains people who are abusive, vulgar, bigoted &amp; hateful. Whichever faction you oppose is the one you're most likely to hear this from. That doesn't mean that's actually the worst faction. Believing that is self-centeredness.
The minute you say a few positive words about Bernie, you got deluged with the most foul, bigoted and hateful abuse. I hope other campaigns will keep their followers under control: https://t.co/QmNorPpBIa
Raising massive amounts of money through small-dollar donors to the point of being competitive in a presidential race - rather than corporate largesse and PACs - is itself game-changing because it alters all the incentives driving whose interests you do &amp; don't have to serve.

@grooveonthis @chasestrangio Take the L, chief.
@IrishInSlope @chasestrangio I've said 5 times that I have no problem whatsoever with those critiquing and disagreeing with Martina's views on this, no matter how strongly. I myself don't agree with them. I was condemning her *expulsion* from an LGBT group as a result of those views.
@Kshawfit @chasestrangio Putin told me to defend Martina. He loves her.
@Pidgejen Here's my point: I think once someone has a life's worth of work demonstrating great courage and commitment to an important cause, and they say something you disagree with on a new debate, it's better to engage them than treat them like toxic trash that is thrown out &amp; punished.

@chasestrangio I don't agree with your name-calling insults toward Martina but even if I did, I don't think expelling people who have devoted their lives with great courage &amp; sacrifice to a cause - inspiring millions when few others could - is a constructive way to change minds.
@Pidgejen I'm not a big enthusiast for the Oppression Olympics but if you insist on playing it, I think an Eastern Bloc immigrant who fled her country in fear at the age of 18, leaving behind her family, in the Reagan era, then came out as one of the few openly gay athletes, wins points.
@grooveonthis @chasestrangio This ain't it, chief. Garbage dump take. Take the L. https://t.co/v6cJtDhjhj
@Pidgejen Like I said, I have no problem with people criticizing Martina's views on this or anything else. One of the things I love about her is that she's always been outspoken and thus polarizing. I don't agree with everything she said. It's the expulsion &amp; marginalization I object to.
@Pidgejen @Martina I think Martina has made clear she's willing to learn and have dialogue and study these issues - that's what she's always done. I have zero problem with those criticizing her views, and I doubt she does. I was reacting to her *expulsion* from an LGBT group, as if she's an Enemy.
@Pidgejen Yes, I don't agree with a lot of what Martina is saying on this particular question. But that doesn't mean I would treat her as an enemy of the LGBT movement, start expelling her from groups, and generally treating her like she's a bigot. I'd engage with her knowing her intent.
@chasestrangio So you're saying that Martina is a racist because she criticized Serena Williams? Is Billie Jean King also a racist for having said this? https://t.co/Nt4k4M7jcu
@Pidgejen A major part of the film I'm making is about the courageous work Martina and Renee Richards did in the 1980s - long before there were groups and online spaces and celebrity support - to demand that trans people be treated as . . . people.
For her defense of feminism, LGBT equality &amp; trans visibility (and, by the way, the rights of immigrants &amp; political dissent generally), @Martina was endlessly mocked by an all-male sports commentariat &amp; sacrificed millions. If *she's the enemy of your cause, evaluate your cause.
Here's the link to that excerpt. It shows how the Navratilova/Evert rivalry took @BillieJeanKing's work &amp; placed female athletes at the center of the sports world. Martina in particular revolutionized feminism in sports, LGBT equality &amp; trans visibility https://t.co/IVq9WigUud
History: in the early 1980s - the start of the Reagan era &amp; the AIDS epidemic - @Martina was one of the planet's most famous &amp; important athletes due to her incomparable rivalry with @ChrissieEvert. Major network events had to regularly feature a trans woman because of Martina https://t.co/bnrdSt5sxe
@chasestrangio @Martina That isn't what she said, and even if it were, you didn't throw someone away as though they're trash and your enemy after a lifetime of courageous, self-sacrificing work because they take a position on rapidly evolving, new debates that you disagree with.
@alexafcbb @Martina Martina has more courage and has done more for the cause of LGBT equality is her toenail than you've done in your entire life. You're distorting what she said but even if you weren't, you're a caricature of the worst, most craven, and most idiotic aspects of callout culture.
For the rights, equality &amp; visibility of all LGBTs - including trans people - @Martina has fought more &amp; sacrificed more than all of those now trying to marginalize her combined: at a time when these causes had very little support. Punishing her for raising questions is shameful.
This is pathetic. @Martina is one of the greatest LGBT pioneers of the 20th Century. She was openly &amp; proudly gay, traveling with a trans woman as her coach, in the 1980s - the era of Reagan &amp; AIDS - and sacrificed enormously for it. Punishing her for debating this is shameful: https://t.co/zBZIRl7Qck

@howling_richard @AOC I wasn't asking. I don't work for the Bernie campaign. I don't take instructions from them or work on their behalf. I was just noting journalistically that this is one of the major looming questions of the 2020 race.
One of the big, looming questions of 2020, especially with Bernie's announcement today, is what @AOC - a devoted Berne campaigner in 2016 - will do. An endorsement from her will single-handedly obliterate several of the establishment's most dishonest, manipulative attacks on him.
I wonder how the 76-year-old straight, white, non-Jewish male Joe Biden will answer this question. I assume it will be in pretty similar fashion, but we'll see. It will also be interesting to see how the straight, white, non-Jewish male Beto O'Rourke answers it: https://t.co/jRJ9hNQMRZ

If you're a US new outlet (CNN) devoted to having US-critical political content censored from the internet - all while you are owned by a corporation with close ties to the US security state &amp; employing ex-FBI &amp; military operatives - maybe refrain from calling others "state TV".
CNN's owner, AT&amp;T, has very close relationships with the US security state, especially its spying. CNN never discloses this. CNN employs many ex-agents. They never disclose the interests of their weapons advertisers in the wars they promote. But they demand FB censors others.
CNN is obsessed with, and steadfastly devoted to, pressuring social media companies to censor from the internet political content critical of the US Govt. They work with US-funded groups to do it.

The Trump administration - spearheaded by *John Bolton and Elliott Abrams* - is openly trying to engineer regime change in an oil-rich country of 32 million people and there's barely a peep of dissent about this allowed on US television (or in DC generally). That's state TV.
Just a nice, friendly military jet sent by a country with a long history of committing atrocities in the region &amp; has made explicitly clear it wants regime change due to oil market access. What country wouldn't let in such a nice plane? Even NPR sees this: https://t.co/kR8f2bDGUq

@REdH_B @RaniaKhalek Having Facebook decide that it's OK to work for some governments but not others while disseminating political messaging puts Silicon Valley in the position of supreme ruler over our discourse &amp; only the slavish &amp; most authoritarian people would want that https://t.co/OyElNWwoue
@FefeuFernandes @davidmirandario Yes, I actually appreciated when Bolsonaro told Globo to their faces what hypocrites they were given how the Marinho family supported not just the coup but also the dictatorship &amp; how their family wealth and power are still derived from that https://t.co/zSrtC7PU3M

@REdH_B @RaniaKhalek Yes, people are eager to have the ideas &amp; people they most hate silenced by authorities. That's why the 1st Amendment guaranteed free speech: because the founders knew so many people share your mentality. Not saying it's a constitutional issue, just pointing out the mindset.
@FefeuFernandes @davidmirandario I'm actually making a movie right now (https://t.co/jOF6RlCEM0), and was previously in one that one an Oscar. I just didn't make this one. As for "dictatorship" https://t.co/HiC4sYfjB7
Regardless of what you think of @RaniaKhalek, Russia or anything else, this trio - CNN, US-funded German Marshall funded, and Facebook - working together to selectively censor is highly disturbing. But this is the inevitable outcome of begging FB to censor https://t.co/OyElNWwoue https://t.co/xKbJ3l0Fsk
@FefeuFernandes @davidmirandario I didn't make the film. The person who made the film is Wagner Moura. I'm pretty sure I made that clear. And yes, Marighella used violence to fight the military dictatorship, as people have done to fight tyranny throughout history. Moura discusses that in the video I posted.
@HtownHeinlein I'll try this one last time. It's not dispositive evidence - it's possible to build your family &amp; those most central in your life with nothing but Jews &amp; still be a secret Jew-hater - but it's probative on the question for reasons that should be too obvious to require explanation
@krazyjrue LOL. No - I've had cookies, coffee and other pastries out waiting for Bob Mueller and his team for so long - that's the kind of host I am - but they just never come. It's hurtful, honestly.
@HtownHeinlein No. "I have a black friend therefore I can't be racist" is not the same - or even close - to: "The woman with whom I chose to spend my life &amp; build my family is Jewish &amp; I chose that the children I love will be Jewish and this is evidence suggesting I'm probably not a Jew-hater."

Wagner Moura has long been one of Brazil's biggest stars. "Narcos" made him an international star. Instead of just comfortably profiting, he's repeatedly used his platform for brave, informed and impassioned work. “Marighella” deserves a lot of attention https://t.co/7PBzp2BcAA
Then, he invited to the premiere Jean Wyllys - the leftist LGBT Congressman from Marielle's party forced to flee under death threats (my husband, from the same party, took his place) - and kissed him in front of cameras: https://t.co/636UAdMnzG
Last night at the premiere of "Marighella” in Berlin, Moura did 2 characteristically brave and beautiful things. First, he paid homage to Marielle Franco, the black LGBT City Councilwoman whose political assassination 11 months ago is still unsolved https://t.co/PFYIUdldIF
Morua had to fight so hard to get this film made. Brazilian financiers - who would usually back any project he did given his stature in Brazil - were petrified of funding it. Now, in Bolsonaro's Brazil, distribution will be a challenge. Moura is heroic: https://t.co/c0JYIFSUYd
The great Brazilian actor, director &amp; activist Wagner Moura has a new film about Marighella, the leftist guerilla who was murdered by the US-supported military dictatorship in Brazil in 1969. Brazil's climate made this film hard to make. Watch him talk about it (in English): https://t.co/2WAOOvIrx8

@sammydog15 @realDonaldTrump It's theoretically possible that someone who chooses to marry a Jewish woman, build his life with her, and then chooses for his own children to be Jewish may be anti-Semitic. It's not dispositive evidence. But it's pretty fucking probative on the question.
@elevate67 I've criticized this aristocratic practice many times, for Speaker Gingrich or Secretary Clinton or Governor Huckabee. These aren't mean to be lifetime titles like landed gentry. It's bad enough when journalists call them this, but worse when - like Dean - they use it themselves.
A reminder of what Democratic leaders were saying about Howard Dean during his presidential run - excoriating him for insufficient support for Israel and strongly implying he was an anti-Semite (even though his wife and children Jewish) https://t.co/B4YaveIXlo https://t.co/eHHMdkSJFi
The oddest part about Howard Dean - sorry, @GovHowardDean - bashing @IlhanMN is that Dean himself, when running for President, was viciously denounced by Democrats (including Pelosi) for the crime of saying the US should be "neutral" on Israel/Palestine https://t.co/B4YaveIXlo
Howard Dean hasn't been Governor, or held any other elective office, for *16 years*, yet he still calls himself "Governor": like some deranged teenager who can't escape from his fantasy video game.

@jmarkosomething What's it like to be tweeting at me because you're paid by neo-Nazis and anti-Semitic groups to do it?
The 4th Amendment is also part of the Constitution. But if the FBI cited it to barge into people's homes without a warrant, that would be an attack on the Constitution even though they were citing an actual part of the Constitution. The question is whether the invocation is valid
This is the kind of vapid, glib idiocy that generates viral highs, but ruins discourse &amp; journalism.

But Matt is the noble warrior fighting fascism &amp; nationalism
@blueherring32 @MattBors @generationloss @DavidKlion Matt has been doing this for months: posing as some sort of brave crusader against fascism and nationalism, risking nothing to do it, having his "battle" consist solely of trite liberal online messaging, while mocking &amp; maligning others who face serious risks &amp; dangers to do it.
From Brazil's largest paper, @Folha (doing a great job reporting on Bolsonaro): in the police operation in Rio that just killed 13, suspects were shot &amp; killed *after they surrendered*. After they were shot, they were stabbed, their bodies mutilated. The Duterte approach is here: https://t.co/tEQVFDYQPV
@blueherring32 @MattBors @generationloss @DavidKlion Matt is a meek, little coward who has never risked anything for his alleged beliefs, which is why he stays on Twitter sniping at people who do, mocking and minimizing the risks &amp; dangers others face so that he doesn't feel so ashamed of his own empty gesturing. It's not complex.
@SpectreXx @MattBors @generationloss @DavidKlion "Hey, I drew a mean cartoon about Mitch McConnell so now I'm going to give lectures to others about the real ways to fight fascism and reactionary nationalism."

@SpectreXx @MattBors @generationloss @DavidKlion What Matt is doing is what cowards like him always do.

@RodrigKildysart @firstcitizensam @MicahVaughan12 @Reuters @davidmirandario "Reputable Brazilian journalists" gave me the highest award in Brazilian journalism called "the Prêmio Esso." I also received the Prêmio Comunique-se for Best International Correspondent, and was nominated for that award (by Brazilian journalists) 3 times. Is that what you mean?
@firstcitizensam @MicahVaughan12 @Reuters @davidmirandario Again, did you understand why the stabbing of Bolsonaro got more media attention and police resources than the average street crime? It's because politically-motivated violence against political officials are not just an attack on them but on the democracy.
@RodrigKildysart @firstcitizensam @MicahVaughan12 @Reuters @davidmirandario LOL. I would have been arrested by Obama if not for Lula. Please explain this theory - I'm in need of some entertainment of this sort today
@John_VanAmburg He probably wouldn't have sent lethal arms to anti-Russian forces in Ukraine, or bombed the forces of Russia's client state in Syria, or be trying to force Germany to stop buying natural gas from Russia, or be trying to remove Maduro, or imposing sanctions on Russians.
@djkocisi2 There were 3 examples there: Adam Schiff (who is probably the single most prominent and influential Trump/Russia conspiracy theorist in the country other than Rachel Maddow), Sarah Kendzior, and a popular Democratic tweeter with almost 400,000 followers. Not randoms.
@DuncanMitchel1 LOL. Yeah, it's definitely irrational to take a leader who you call a racist, fascist, xenophobic, mentally unstable, Alzheimers-ridden, corrupt tyrant and hand him a massive military budget, greater domestic spying powers, and unite behind him as he engineers regime change.
@djkocisi2 I just showed you four examples of prominent Trump/Russia conspiracy advocates criticizing Mueller for going to slow and conducting an inadequate investigation, so a conclusory denial ("No were not") contributes nothing.
To be fair to these #Resistance fanatics, their point isn't irrational: If you believe Trump is forcibly subservient to an adversary foreign leader, it does seem irresponsible to leave him in charge of the Executive Branch, the US military &amp; the nuclear arsenal for 2 full years.
The hard-core Trump/Russia maximalists are now starting to do what was until recently verboten: criticize Mueller. It's because: 1) they're scared he'll deliver far less than they promised &amp; 2) they're angry he allowed a Kremlin-controlled traitor to stay in office so long https://t.co/QtbTv0V1yP

@firstcitizensam @MicahVaughan12 @Reuters @davidmirandario Yes, Brazil has a general crime epidemic that is serious. But that's not what caused Marielle's death. She wasn't murdered in a random mugging. She was politically assassinated. And violent attacks on political figures (like Bolsonaro) get more attention for valid reasons.

CIA officials and FBI agents have the right to view the elected President's policies toward Russia as being misguided or dangerous, but not to use their secret surveillance powers, with no Congressional oversight, to impede or criminalize those policies. https://t.co/4GF9rfVWfb

It's important to appreciate how significant this is.

@RKTlaw "You were better once" = "I liked you when you attacked Republicans." Yes, I think it's notable that a network vehemently devoted to the anti-Trump narrative admitted this. And I addressed the evidence argument here: https://t.co/2oLS3CguSB
@GNCordova @JustaRussianbot Polls showed she and Trump were literally the two most unpopular candidates in modern presidential history. And since everyone knows the presidency is determined by the Electoral College, not the popular vote, that's how campaigns structure their tactics: to win what matters.
@ReillyOToole1 This person I'm taking time from my finite life to write about has no relevance! https://t.co/8YLRfoNVwC
@GNCordova @JustaRussianbot That is so exciting and meaningful!
One last point: It's true there are other types of evidence besides "direct evidence" (such as circumstantial). But given the intense level of surveillance we now know many Trump officials were under, the Committee's lack of "direct" collusion evidence is obviously significant.
@RKTlaw If it means nothing, why did NBC report it? Yes, "no direct evidence" means a great deal. It's not dispositive, but it's sure as hell highly relevant and probative, which is presumably why NBC reported it all day and so many people (including you) are discussing it.
@dandrezner @maddow Also, I find it quite notable that Adam Schiff - as your own paper just reported - has begun gently but clearly criticizing the Mueller investigation for "shying away" from Trump's finances and not "adequately" scrutinizing key areas https://t.co/PDU6fjafW3
@dandrezner @maddow People have spent 2 years saying the Senate Intel Committee is conducting a serious investigation with highly classified info. I agree it's not dispositive; I said (as I always have) we should wait for Mueller. But NBC thought it was pretty significant https://t.co/bshvjrZOwD
@Grant_Case @seospider @KenDilanianNBC If you believe that talking to official sources and mindlessly repeating what they say is "real reporting," you should campaign to give Judith Miller a Pulitzer. Repeating what government officials say is called stenography, not reporting.
@firstcitizensam @abcnews Bolsonaro took a picture with some gay people therefore Brazil has no problem of anti-LGBT violence and discrimination. Your brain tells you this is a rational way to reason? https://t.co/Z8hW65gIQf
@seospider @KenDilanianNBC No. I think Ken Dilanian is a horrible reporter because all he does is repeat what his official sources in the CIA &amp; DNC tell him to say. That's what he's doing here. Dems on the Committee told him Burr was right - they found no direct collusion evidence - &amp; he's repeating that.
Of course it's *possible* the Committee will suddenly find direct collusion evidence that has been hiding for 2 years. Of course it's *possible* Mueller will finally indict an American for election-conspiring with Russia. Anything is "possible." Journalism is about known facts: https://t.co/sMOCfQ7eBA
This is a classic case where people use social media headlines to argue with one another &amp; thus mislead. Richard Burr said: we've found no direct evidence of collusion so far. NBC said: Dems confirmed this to us. No Dem is saying otherwise. They're just saying: we're not done yet

Both parties have spent years insisting that a boycott of Israel is not just misguided but anti-semitic, bigoted and hateful - to the point of wanting to *outlaw* it. Now there are 2 members of Congress who explicitly support it: both Dems. Of course the backlash will be massive: https://t.co/IxiLvgjJlb
@BenjSilv @IlhanMN And there are also many Jews defending @IlhanMN. I regard Israel as a major threat, not Congresswoman Omar.

Sorry, but you're not going to turn the two first Muslim women to serve in the US Congress into overnight Jew-haters because of their criticisms of Israel. What's actually anti-Semitic is conflating the Government of Israel with Jews, so those of you doing that should stop.

@RonColeman @Cernovich @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Yes, I think having the government impose official punishment on elected officials for their criticisms of a foreign nation implicates free speech values. Beyond the legalism, it reflects a bizarre set of priorities for a US official to venerate Israel this way above all else.
Equating @IlhanMN &amp; @RashidaTlaib's criticism of Israel to Steve King's long defense of white supremacy is obscene (McCarthy said it's worse). In the US, we're allowed to criticize our own government: certainly foreign governments. The GOP House Leader's priorities are warped.

Very interesting @AOC re-tweet of @TulsiGabbard from 2017, condemning Trump's interference in Venezuela. Definitely wondering whether @AOC still supports Gabbard's (and @RoKhanna's) opposition to the bipartisan position on this, which has united behind Trump and John Bolton: https://t.co/63NJqKlapJ
@gregpmiller People are allowed to discuss stories using words different than the reporter's, who may be eager to protect sources or otherwise serve an agenda. You stated in multiple places that Schiff views Mueller's investigative scrutiny as inadequate &amp; he "shied away" from key areas.
@MichaelDKarras @RepAdamSchiff That's utter bullshit. If the Russians have leverage over Trump and can use it to control or influence him, of course that's within Mueller's investigative purview: https://t.co/1AcASzWWO3 https://t.co/OWEpNr8R7x

@BurgerDogBoy @kasie Do you think winning the world's most prestigious journalism awards in multiple countries around the world would be a better start?

Do the Democrats who support the Trump administration's regime change operations in Venezuela believe Trump, John Bolton &amp; Elliott Abrams are benevolently motivated to bring freedom &amp; democracy to the Venezuelan People, or that they'll end up helping them despite bad motives?
@WG_Cockrell "The Trump administration is engineering regime change in a foreign country of 31 million people and - since I don't live there and it has nothing to do with helping Democrats - it bores me."
Could you imagine how happy the Venezuelan government would be if the Trump administration's "meddling" in their country - fully supported by most Democrats - was confined to some Facebook ads, Twitter bots and phishing links?
This was one of the few (inadvertently) honest exchanges in the last two years in major media about what Americans really mean when they complain about "meddling": https://t.co/H0XFFfxbtr
It's been obvious since mid-2016 that all the anger over "Russian meddling" never meant "meddling is bad."

Mastery of basic principles of logical reasoning - through remedial logic classes for TV journalists - would greatly improve the quality of our public discourse. (Similarly: opposing Regime Change Policy against Dictator X doesn't make one a supporter of Dictator X).
If you object to the wrongful treatment of Person X, it doesn't make you a supporter of Person X. Those who objected to torture &amp; due process denials at GITMO didn't become Al Qaeda supporters. Objecting to media smears of a candidate doesn't make you that candidate's supporter.

@larisa_a You said "we should not be mocking it ". I wasn't mocking it. I explicitly called what the National Enquirer did "grotesque", "lowly and unscrupulous." I said Bezos is entitled "as anyone else to his personal privacy." You can't comment on articles you haven't read.

@mebeSajidS Do you think MSNBC and CNN and the NYT and the WashPost frequently promote things in bad faith like imperialism and corporatism and militarism and war?
@WorstPlace Which cable hosts is one allowed to talk to or are worth talking to?
@Drew_Homan @WorstPlace I specifically asked where Zaid should have published that article and which cable shows he should have gone on in order to discuss it. If the answer isn't "MSNBC" and the Atlantic, tell me who would've published that and which cable shows invited him on to talk about it?
@SanaSaeed I particularly found his example of Northam v. Gillibrand (who defended Phillip Morris) interesting. Why isn't that disqualifying? What bad acts are disqualifying and which ones aren't? What counts as "youth" and how much time has to elapse, etc? These are all vital to discuss.
@SanaSaeed About which transgressions are worthy of rehabilitation and which ones aren't. Which metrics do we use to assess that? Why do we celebrate a murderer running for public office but Northam has no opportunity to repent? Why do we focus on symbolic acts over systemic injustices?
@SanaSaeed As I said, I have no problem at all with those who engaged Zaid's argument on the merits and reject it. I disagree with his ultimate conclusion. I think Northam should resign. But I think the questions Zaid raises about governing principles are interesting ones worth assessing.
@ScotttBrown2020 What other cable shows do you think invited Zaid on to have him discuss his unique views on this topic? Do you think that unless Rachel Maddow or Wolf Blitzer decide he deserves to be heard, that he has a moral obligation to keep his mouth shut and stay off TV? I don't.
@colddayonmars There are a lot of valid ways to believe Zaid has bad ideas and a terrible ideology on various issues. But anyone who thinks Zaid Jilani is *stupid* is almost certainly plagued by large amounts of stupidity.
@WorstPlace The key to solving America's problems is talking only to Joe Scarborogh and Rachel Maddow and writing for Jeffrey Goldberg.
@mebeSajidS Yeah, Zaid isn't at the Intercept any more and there are reasons for that and they have nothing to do with me. I wish he were. I don't manage or edit the Intercept.
@delmoi He could just get a cardboard box and put it in his closet and stand on it and say what he wants to say. Zaid is a writer. Writers need to get paid for what they write in order to earn a livlihood. Dude.
Zaid grew up as a brown Muslim in the South. It's not surprising he thinks about race and discourse and how to confront racism in different ways than middle-class white kids who grew up in segregated suburbs and now work in Williamsburg media. It doesn't make Zaid fascist or evil
Ordinarily, it would be scandalous and offensive for a white liberal to malign a smart writer of color as being the embodiment of *stupidity*. But here he knows it's permissible because Zaid is ideologically heterodox. The rules of Dem discourse on identity politics are so craven
I've known Zaid for years. I disagree with him often, including on this @Quillette piece. But he's the opposite of stupid. But this white liberal - whose life has no interaction with race except as an online insult toy - looks at Zaid and sees stupidity for obvious reasons.
Finally, I'll take this opportunity to marvel at the license white liberals grant themselves to malign people like Zaid or Tulsi Gabbard in the most vitriolic &amp; toxic ways. Here's a white liberal pronouncing Zaid not misguided or ideologically wrong but extremely *stupid*. https://t.co/LdGIp8Hdh2
I'm glad more and more people are rejecting the repressive decree that Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow &amp; Jeffrey Goldberg are the sole &amp; final arbiters of what views are allowed to be heard. Look at what they've advocated: a discourse ruled over by them will be inherently destructive
For those angry about *where* Zaid wrote &amp; discussed his argument: which liberal journals or other cable shows would have aired his questions? Liberal venues permit a *very* constricted range of views. That one who falls outside of it must keep silent is anti-intellectual trash.
Contrary to Twitter bullshit, @ZaidJilani didn't defend Northam. He asked what rehabilitative standards should apply for various transgressions, do we use coherent principles, and why we fixate on symbolism over systemic injustice. "LOL quilette" &amp; "zaid is trash" aren't answers.
Zaid Jilani needs to learn to be a lot more obedient to white liberals about where he is &amp; is not allowed to speak.

@The_Greg_Mason @mattyglesias I didn't delete the original tweet.
@politeworkacco1 @mattyglesias @TrueFactsStated Is this also "nobody"? https://t.co/jh9K8g0VkQ And again, Howard Schultz hasn't even announced that he's running, let alone become a threat to Democrats yet, and it's already happening, so I don't think it's a great example.

@ijbailey Malcolm Nance has repeatedly and publicly stated that I'm on the payroll of the Kremlin. Any real news outlet would fire someone for making a claim like that without evidence. But NBC and MSNBC do not just tolerate this but encourage it. It's their function, their ratings model.
@ijbailey I've spent 3 years documenting one episode after the next where NBC and MSNBC personalities lie to the public about adversaries of the Democratic Party, including outright lying that they are linked to or paid by Russia. It's a pattern. This is very far from the first time.
And just for the record: no, my objecting to NBC's use of a disgraced firm that just got caught in a major fraud scam involving Russia, a scam NBC concealed from its readers, does not justify Democratic smear artists claiming I support Tulsi Gabbard's candidacy, since I do not.

@FisherBurton I didn't call it censorship, but I don't recall the great fiction writers of the past providing advanced copies of their novels to "gauge reader reaction" and then cancelling publication if people find it insensitive and then apologizing. Is this a new process?
If the book is really as offensive as its pre-publication critics claim because it's mean to some of the characters, wouldn't it be more powerful to allow it to be published and then have us all burn it together in a collective ritual, rather than cancelling it in advance?
Regardless of your views on the merits of the book's criticisms, it's simply extraordinary that a young, Asian immigrant to the US - widely touted as an exciting new fiction writer - canceled her own book over pre-publication complaints over how characters were treated. See above

Next on MSNBC: stay tuned! The fascist, racist, xenophobic, demented monster with Alzheimer's is liberating The Venezuelan People from tyranny and bringing them Freedom &amp; Democracy and we must rally behind him as he does it. Our all-star CIA panel is next https://t.co/VMorxPRlbD
Also, I'm sure that whoever the US and the CIA ends up installing to rule Venezuela will be deeply committed to liberal democracy and ensuring freedom for everyone. This is totally consistent with the history of US intervention in Latin America &amp; the ideology of Trump and Bolton.
Totally. The interests of Trump, John Bolton &amp; the CIA in Venezuela has nothing to do with their oil or capitalistic benefit. These close friends of Saudi despots are just deeply moved by the oppression of The Venezuelan People and seek to liberate them from tyranny. https://t.co/qwqZnKG95r
The converse of this principle - that the bipartisan DC class swoons for Trump only when he bombs &amp; extends imperialism - is they attack him using the Rove/Cheney script when he rolls it back. Here's Ryan Crocker accusing him of "surrender" to the Taliban https://t.co/vnw8WNB7hg

@ShaunBokhari Did you know that appearing on a network or show to be interviewed does not mean that you are endorsing the views of that network or show? https://t.co/t0wCIH2iOM
@TXFartingsworth You regard the help the NSA gives to Saudi and UAE despots to spy on and punish dissidents as nothing more than a little fly on the wall? You obviously don't live in those countries and therefore find it boring how much your government helps tyranny endure there.
@The007Twit @marcorubio It's too obvious to require explanation why having the federal government regulate and punish speech it dislikes contradicts a view of a limited role for the federal government in our lives.
It's a bizarre sensation being accused of being a fascist-enabler by sheltered, coddled, online Williamsburg and Portland liberals while being targeted, threatened and menaced by actual fascists - the real deal - the kind those brave Brooklyn liberals have never encountered.
All this because Bolsonaro's Senator-son got caught with very suspicious flows of money into his account (along with Bolsonaro's wife) and, most alarmingly of all, very close links to Brazil's most dangerous death squads, which assassinated Marielle https://t.co/BFIYq8X4uf
In the meantime, Bolsonaro fanatics continue to be obsessed with maligning Intercept content, with their moronic but intensifying viral campaign to "dislike" our YouTube reports (which, ironically, only helps its visibility) and spread demented conspiracies about our function. https://t.co/Ud2eMSzfpX
There is some really sick, demented and dangerous trash being spread in Bolsonaro WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages - from "Captain Durval Ferreira" - about Jean Wyllys, David Miranda, Marcelo Freixo, Lula, PSOL &amp; me: the kind of stuff that can get people killed. https://t.co/wpqFkueHFo
So bizarre to have spent years enduring lectures from @marcorubio about the need for limited federal government &amp; the sanctity of the Constitution while he tries to use federal law to punish Americans for engaging in political activism he dislikes against a foreign country
Aside from the fact that "companies" are often just single individuals who work as contractors - which means Marco's bill allows people to be fired for boycotting Israel - why is a US Senator using the force of US law to punish Americans for protesting a foreign nation? https://t.co/kOFQhOBMCh

Exactly 8 weeks ago today, @guardian published &amp; hyped a "blockbuster" story that Manafort secretly visited Assange 3 times. It swamped cable news &amp; Twitter.

@indoserb I don't want "fans", and never did, whose fandom is contingent on my agreeing with them and saying things to advance their political agenda. 😞
@welldrawndog Like every good conspiracy theorist, you don't allow evidence that contradicts the theory to undermine your faith. What's the point of blackmailing Trump if, as you claim, US policy isn't shaped by him? Seems like kind of a worthless blackmail scheme if he's an impotent puppet.
@shlomo_shlomi Unfortunately for you, it's common for journalists to report on other countries so that the world knows what's happening. That I live in Brazil for 14 years, that my children are Brazilian, that my husband is a Brazilian Congressman, that I pay taxes to Brazil increases my role.
I know there are many deranged &amp; unhinged factions in the world, but you really have to know the online Bolsonaro movement to believe it. There's just nothing like them.

That Bernie was a Kremlin asset - wittingly or otherwise - has been percolating in the Dem mainstream for awhile. That's to be expected: it's a mania that has engulfed their brains. But to see a mainstream writer spew the McCarthyite poison so explicitly is still notable. https://t.co/vwzkoWRkqH
As Jeffrey Goldberg proved - when he spent 2002 &amp;d 2003 telling Americans Saddam had an alliance with Al Qaeda, which started a war, earned him awards &amp; rapid promotions - US media doesn't dislike conspiracies.

@SirNorthington @JeffJankovich @NPR Exactly. In fact, I'm neither offended nor annoyed.

@WoodfordPG Have you heard of the Pentagon Papers? Or the reporting done by the Guardian, WashPost and the NYT on the Snowden archive? Or the NYT's publishing of Trump's tax returns? Or the way every media outlet reported on the DNC &amp; Podesta emails?
@Captain_Dan95 People lie often for reasons other than covering up crimes. Check out what Bill Clinton did repeatedly in the 1990s, for instance, or what James Clapper did. But if underlying crimes were committed by Americans relating to the election, presumably Mueller will charge them one day

What @michaeldweiss did to @RoKhanna in this above tweet is who neocons always have been and still are. They cheerlead for regime change all over the world and then accuse anyone who opposes them of being disloyal, assets of foreign powers, unpatriotic. Neocons are uniquely toxic

@MortySmithEsq @wfederman @theintercept Not that I know of, but a founding principle of the Intercept - which, as you might recall, I co-created - is journalistic independence and editorial freedom: that you're free to express yourself and your voice regardless of who is angered by it, including your colleagues.
@MitchellCares @randygdub No, I think that claim is incredibly dumb. All of Twitter journalism spent all weekend talking about it and so I don't think my going on Fox to argue that the kids acted poorly even with the whole video available contributed to white supremacism.
@synshow @randygdub I have contempt for the liberal view that if Wolf Blitzer and Rachel Maddow decide your views shouldn't be heard on TV, then you have the moral obligation to stay off television, and I'm not going to accept this decree now matter how many different ways it's expressed.
@MortySmithEsq @wfederman They told me hours beforehand. I would have had to cancel and leave them with no guest. I'm not making excuses for myself: I had the option to cancel at the last minute and chose not to. But had they asked and said this was the topic in the first instance, I would have refused.

@geekpondering Then they can just refrain from deciding whether to believe it. I often don't have time to check the veracity of claims about what someone has said and so I hold off on making judgments about it.
People who see tweets &amp; screen grabs with claims about what someone has said in an interview &amp; decide to believe it without - y'know - listening to the interview, are very slothful &amp; dumb. This is a common tactic of Twitter smear artists &amp; click-merchants. Who doesn't know this? https://t.co/a5fNThM416

The full video of the interview is here. I'm not sure why people like Matt Bors wake up &amp; want to fill their day with lying about what others say. I say a lot of stuff one can argue with: no need to make things up. But it seems to give some people pleasure https://t.co/iKs2gbjxjd
Twitter's design empowers those who lie to smear others, because only accusations, not proof, are required. It's very tiring to point it out, but you can't allow people with big platforms to do it.

@aimeemb24 @MattBors Matt continues to check my time-line - which is part of how he continues to pathologically lie about what I say - so I no have doubt he knows I'm once again documenting his lies about me. I won't unblock people who use access to my Twitter time-line to smear me with lies.
@daveweigel That's true, though I also think another way of looking at it is that there's now a robust left-wing media that critically scrutinizes the record of prominent Democrats from the left. Part of that may be Bernie-related but I think a lot of it is independent of him.

@dvoshart @MattBors @charliearchy This is exactly why I blocked Matt. He's a pathological liar. Anyone can just listen to the interview to see that he's lying about what I said - again. But his white Brooklyn liberal friends will think he's good.

@mattmittenthal @FoxNews @BuzzFeedBen LOL. We'll see. I did talk on that very segment how about we should be more careful here and not treat Mueller like an infallible God. I wish my initial take had been a little more nuanced. My guess is *some* evidence exists and SDNY sources just see it differently than Mueller.
@JordanUhl OK, thanks - see my above tweet. I apologize if my tone was a bit hostile but I just really did not want to be associated with that claim and you how fast things like that can spread on Twitter and, once spread, there's no stopping them.
@JordanUhl @a_luffa @themindbottler OK, fair enough. I think it's predictable that if you show my face next to a (highly inflammatory) chyron, it makes it seem like that's what i'm arguing (and that's how people understood it). But I accept &amp; appreciate that this wasn't your intent. I argued against that point.
@JordanUhl Right, and you provide video of those, but you didn't here, because you wanted to mislead people into believing that I agreed with her take on this story when, in fact, I went to specifically disagree with it. The replies show you succeeded in deceiving people, so congrats.
@mattmittenthal @FoxNews @BuzzFeedBen OK, fair enough. I agree that story is trivial and super-annoying in terms of the attention it's received. There are progressives using screen grabs to imply I agreed with that argument, when I rejected. Sorry for wrongly assuming you were doing the same.
@mistahbuhau @JordanUhl @SamHarrisOrg If he had actually presented the words I said, instead of taking a childish picture to imply I said the exact opposite of what I actually said, I'd have had no problem with it. He purposely omitted the video of the interview to mislead people.
@mattmittenthal @FoxNews https://t.co/cPbZAJLBau

@smagula @sohmer @mehdirhasan Eliminating the racist and unjust crack/cocaine disparity, while a good thing to do, is a tiny fraction of the damage Biden caused with his "Tough on Crime," "Pump Up the Penal State" and "Escalate the Drug War" ideology over decades. That doesn't show remorse.
Amazing! After I just noted @MalcolmNance lies compulsively for MSNBC, and provided links where he has done that repeatedly - including I'm paid by the Kremlin &amp; Jill Stein has an RT show - he lies again: claiming I'm paid by Fox.

@sohmer @mehdirhasan When someone runs for President, the lives they destroyed &amp; the evils they ushered in when as a US Senator are relevant. And if he wants to claim he changed, he should be able to point to efforts to undo his harm: such as bills to liberalize drug laws &amp; the Drug War. Have links?
@tony_bicycle @Lala___Star Yes, the person asked me about her evolution specifically on LGBT issues. The tweet you showed me has absolutely nothing to do with that. I've said repeatedly I find many of Tulsi's positions concerning &amp; want to her her elaborate on them https://t.co/uDhzuPsMpa
Here's Biden in the same speech attacking Bush 41 for cutting back on border security, saying we need more border &amp; immigration controls to stop drugs. He also demands the U.S. military go strike "drug lords" in the countries where they live: no safe haven for "narco-terrorists"! https://t.co/cnuGgnKHgU
@Lala___Star The reason I believe Tulsi's evolution is because she now has a long series of not just pro-LGBT speeches but *votes* supporting full LGBT equality. Can you show me the laws Biden spearheaded to liberalize drug laws and show remorse? It only got worse from here, not better.
Here's the national 1989 speech Sen. Joe Biden gave where he attacked President Bush 41 for being soft on crime and drugs, &amp; demanded more prosecutions &amp; prison for drug dealers &amp; *users*: led not only to the 1994 Crime Bill but major escalation of the Drug War &amp; Penal State: https://t.co/sg36rV30Zz

@fardarter @BuzzFeedBen LOL. Honestly, I find it both sad and funny to watch people try to cling to this but I believe you're doing it with decent intentions so I won't try to dissuade you further.
Homophobic mockery has been at the core of the Trump/Putin fixation for 2 years but since it's done with a progressive heart, it's been deemed benign and even noble https://t.co/0AU0tHuHLJ https://t.co/btI7LRZhRZ
@fardarter @BuzzFeedBen I don't agree  at all with you understanding of the Mueller statement but it is irrelevant to the point. The WashPost did added reporting about why Mueller issued the statement and what it means. Go read it.
@greta @Buzzfee I'm sure the BuzzFeed reporters had sources telling them this - just like Judy Miller had sources, Guardian had sources telling them Manafort visited Assange 3 times, the WPost had sources telling them Russia invaded the Vermont electric grid, etc. Sources lie. Docs are needed.
I have a lot of respect for @BuzzFeedBen &amp; what he's done as an editor. BuzzFeed has long done serious, great reporting. But multiple media outlets have gotten huge Trump/Russia stories wrong &amp; rank-closing among journalists feeds the perception that journalism can't be trusted.
If you're one of the people tempted to believe the self-evidently laughable claim that there's something "vague" or unclear about Mueller's statement, or that it just seeks to quibble with a few semantic trivialities, read this @WashPost story about this  https://t.co/0io99LyATS https://t.co/ca1TwPR3Og
The steadfastly mute Robert Mueller decided - after 1 1/2 years - to speak out &amp; explicitly deny a major news report because he just had a few trivial, semantic quibbles with some ancillary claims. That there are journalists pushing that bullshit exacerbates the initial debacle.

I would ask if cable outlets and Twitter journalists will exercise a tad more caution in the future about explosive Trump/Russia stories based on anonymous claims unaccompanied by evidence, but since we've seen this happen over &amp; over, we all already know the answer to that: https://t.co/JYhaMDyemj

@abelson_jeffrey No, I'm sure BuzzFeed had sources who told them this, as they claimed. Judy Miller also had sources who told her things. The Guardian had sources who told them Manafort visited Assange in the Embassy. Sources lie and get things wrong - especially official ones.
For those who want to pretend Mueller is just quibbling with some small semantic details in the story, what's the theory about why Mueller - for the first time - decided it was important to come out and comment directly on a media story by calling it "inaccurate"? Why this one?
The attempt to parse Mueller's statement &amp; pretend it's vague is just sad. The BF story had only one key claim: that Mueller had proof in the form of documents, email &amp; testimony that Trump directed Cohen to lie. *That* is what Mueller said is inaccurate. It couldn't be clearer.
Exactly. Given the significance of this story - with huge numbers of Dems &amp; media figures saying Trump should be impeached "if the story is true", &amp; with Dem Senators demanding to know from Mueller - there was no way Mueller could let a false story this big sit without a denial: https://t.co/RqAfZVFbpl

@TomJohn15151515 @ThePlumLineGS LOL. I think an exception to not speculating about what Mueller has is when Mueller comes out and says what he does and doesn't have - you know like he did tonight.
@ThePlumLineGS You think Mueller would have decided to come out and deny a story for the first time just because he had some tiny quibbles with some of the language? They went out of their way to specifically call the key claims inaccurate.

@OllieOllieBuzby Putin told me to hypnotize Mueller into issuing a statement denying the BuzzFeed story so I got my pocket watch and did it.

24 straight hours of completely uncritical, mindless, hysterical cable news coverage on a story - complete with calls for impeachment - that Muller's office now says was fundamentally false.

In the above tweet, I got @gtconway3d's Twitter name wrong. This is the tweet to which I was referring with important questions for BuzzFeed (beyond the apparent discrepancy in claims between the two reporters): https://t.co/b7kZP4c7NI
@We_Get_Signal CNN claimed Trump Jr. had advanced access to the WL archive &amp; MSNBC purported to independently confirm it; that was an utter lie. WashPost claimed Russia hacked into the Vermont electric grid: a lie. CNN lied about Lanny Davis being its source for a story. Endless falsehoods.
There are definitely plausible explanations for this discrepancy in the claims of the 2 BuzzFeed reporters. It could easily just be a semantic contrast. But it is a discrepancy on a central question and I hope BuzzFeed clarifies it (along with answering @gtconway's questions): https://t.co/b33UpQl1aV
@STLprog @Divitissimus @BuzzFeed One reporter claimed on MSNBC he saw documents, but said nothing about what documents he saw. The other reporter - as I just proved to you - told CNN he didn't see documents. That discrepancy raises questions. If they did see documents: https://t.co/b7kZP4c7NI
We've endured two-plus years of endless snippets of leaks from anonymous sources, usually unaccompanied by evidence. Many stories have proven true, but *many* big ones have been false, humiliatingly so. The truth won't be known until the real report *and evidence* are disclosed.
@BlueDuck7700 @jairbolsonaro @AP @NYT This isn't a NYT investigation. It's been all over the Brazilian news for a month. There is a formal investigation. Bolsonaro's son just tried to have it stopped. This is an AP article, published by NYT, just summarizing what's well established for an English-speaking audience.
Also, the credibility of BuzzFeed, or these reporters, is irrelevant. It's not like they did the investigation proving Trump directed Cohen's perjury. They're just claiming Mueller has the evidence to prove this. Either Mueller does or doesn't &amp; presumably, one day, he'll tell us

@bennoba Yep.
I regard lying to Congress by top officials - even absent an underlying crime - as a serious felony, which is why I thought James Clapper should have been fired &amp; prosecuted. Neither of those happened. He now works for CNN. If the Buzzfeed story is true, it's a serious crime.
Six weeks ago, we drowned in "whoa-if-true-this-is-the-ballgame" hysteria over the Guardian's "reporting" about Manafort's secret visits to Assange. These Buzzfeed reporters are way more reliable than @lukeharding1968 but *so many* of these anonymous leaks end up to be false.
Lying to Congress is a felony. People have gone to prison for it. It's an impeachable offense. At some point, hopefully, we'll be able to see Mueller's conclusions &amp; evidence instead of often-wrong snippets anonymously leaked and thus constantly having "if true" discussions.
@cereal_twit I think the mainstreaming of deranged and baseless accusations of blackmail against a US Senator, relying on classic homophobic tropes of the type pioneered during the Lavender Scare, is worthy of comment for multiple reason. Sorry if it bores you. https://t.co/BKuiUXcivM

I don't know of a single US Jew with any platform that supports Putin and/or harbors allegiances to Moscow the way some westerners in the 1930s and 1940s supported Communism, but even if there were some, having a WPost columnist frame this as a Jewish Fifth Column is shocking.

@timbishop4000 Obama refused to send arms to anti-Russian forces in Ukraine even though both parties demanded he do so, and also wanted to partner with Putin to bomb Syria. Is it possible that Putin had dirt on him &amp; blackmailed him. Yes, it's possible, but no rational person would assert this.
Whatever else is true, if you claim that someone is being blackmailed because someone else discovered dirty, shameful things that they did, and you have no *evidence* that this actually happened, you are, *at best*, a reckless purveyor of gossipy garbage &amp; unhinged conspiracies.
Part of what's being done to Graham is MSNBC &amp; online charlatans - for profit &amp; ratings - has convinced liberals they're living in a Tom Clancy novel. But part of it is pure homophobia: gay men have dirty secrets (pedophilia, etc) that make them uniquely vulnerable to blackmail.
In 2007, Obama said Hillary was a craven, power-hungry liar &amp; his surrogates called the Clintons racists. She said stuff about him at least as bad. Then they worked together &amp; endorsed each other. That's how politics works. Beyond scurrilous, blackmail fantasies are moronic.
I've loathed Lindsey Graham since I began writing about politics - one of Washington's worst warmonger and moralizers. But this escalating and completely baseless innuendo that he's being blackmailed - with the clearly implication that it's sexual - is utterly repellent trash.
@jdakwar @TulsiGabbard She needs to elaborate on her views on that and many other issues where she's said things that are very validly criticized. I've asked her for an interview to discuss these in a way that go beyond cable news hits, talking points, and snippets. I'm hoping it works.

@AtBatedBreath I didn't write this article, though I appreciate your attributing to me such outstanding investigative reporting into one of Washington's most influential think tanks https://t.co/vFYSsA1VDi
@Trayofbees I'm honestly just fascinated by the hubris people inadvertently display when they accuse others of expressing a certain view &amp; then refusing to believe their denials - as if your disapproval is so devastating to me that I'm willing to deny my own beliefs to avoid it. It's not.
I'm still not sure why it's deemed acceptable in DC that the leading Dem Party think tank maintains such close ties to one of the world's most heinous regimes. Now that they've fired a top staffer over the (false) belief that he leaked about this, maybe it'll get more attention? https://t.co/y2fyBEQad1
@platavitch @HeerJeet @mtracey Every liberal on Twitter knows that literally the easiest way to get likes and applause - other than screaming about Trump and Fox - is to mock &amp; attack @mtracey. Jeet is a specialist in it. In this case, I think Michael's argument was clear, but I provided the evidence anyway.
@Trayofbees That's exactly what I just said. Again: why would I express an opinion and then deny to you that I actually hold that opinion? Do you really believe that I so fear your disapproval that I'm willing to repudiate my own beliefs? You're taking the second tweet out of context.
@milquetoes But that's the point: I haven't used Twitter to talk about any of those matters because Twitter is the shittiest possible medium to have discussions of that type &amp; to opine on them. All I did was point out what Jesse said &amp; showed the debate that has emerged.
@CollectivzdPaki @Trayofbees I'm a vigorous proponent of full trans rights &amp; visibility. I'm making a film featuring that cause. My husband ran his campaigns with trans rights as a central prong &amp; hired the first-ever trans woman to serve in his cabinet. Twitter needs villains every day &amp; will invent them.
@STLprog @HeerJeet @mtracey There was polling data in what I tweeted that won't disappear if you pretend it's not there. And yes, it's now a clear strategy for security state agencies to co-opt liberal causes to get liberals to support them, &amp; that data shows it's working: https://t.co/aSmz34iNtF
@Trayofbees I'll try this one time: 1) People claimed Jesse was threatening to sue over criticisms of his article; 2) I said: no, he's wants to sue because *he believes* he was defamed; 3) that person said that's an attack on free speech: 4) I said: no, suing over defamation doesn't qualify.
@Trayofbees Let me ask you something with the utmost sincerity: if I woke up this morning &amp; decided I wanted to argue that Jesse's accusers were lying, why would I now be telling you I never said that? Do you think I deny my own beliefs if I see that they upset people? I promise: i don't.
@milquetoes Not everyone is misrepresenting me: only a tiny handful of people are. I've only made 2 points: 1) look: there's an argument among liberal writers about whether Jesse should be ostracized; 2) Jesse is threatening to sue because he thinks he was defamed, not over article criticism
@HeerJeet First, thank you for your ongoing bravery in denouncing @mtracey; the way you go after such popular figures is impressive. Second, polls shows that liberals increasingly support the FBI because - beyond things like Mueller &amp; anti-far-right probes - they coopt liberal causes: https://t.co/lugGkVk1ZH
@milquetoes I never said it was equivalent to his free speech being trampled upon. Surely Twitter is able offer up some Real Enemies today. Aren't people like you going to get bored continually making up views &amp; attributing them to me so that I can satisfy your villain needs until then?
@milquetoes Yes, I agree that the latter view is an accurate representation of the argument of those participating in this debate who want him to be ostracized.
@lowkeythiccboy First, I'm not getting "a ton of heat"; there's like 50 people on the planet who even know this discussion exists &amp; even they'll forget it about when the next villain pops up. Second, there's a "debate" about these matters even if you wish there weren't; my saying so is just fact
@itsSupercar @lowkeythiccboy Totally. I really did say it, and I really do believe it, but now I'm denying my own beliefs because I'm so afraid that @itsSupercar and 20 other people are angry about it. I'll even renounce my own religion just to avoid your criticisms. That's how powerful you are.
@Trayofbees "You . . . . stated that his accusers are lying." - LOL.. Why would you just make up something like that? What possible motive does it serve? I don't do trial by Twitter jury: I never expressed any view whatsoever about whether these accusations are true because I have no idea. https://t.co/6DZ9LxEiX9

@MetroidThief Josh Holland is an African-American contributor to the Nation, but I guess if you want to depict him as the embodiment of rich elite privilege in America, I can't stop you. It just seems like a pretty stupid example to choose.
@NoraReed @MK_author @delmoi @0d0b3nus The idea that all trans people think alike (ie like you) is pretty reductive and bigoted. And you most definitely do not speak for all trans people, let alone those who are friends of mine.
@MetroidThief Do you think Katha Pollit and Josh Holland are "well-off"? I guess that's possible but I certainly haven't ever seen anything to suggest that. I don't think Nation writers and freelance journalists like them are known to make large salaries.
@MK_author @delmoi @0d0b3nus You're claiming I have no trans friends? LOL (literal)! And I wasn't expressing an opinion on whether any of the accusations were true. I was simply correcting the claim that Singal was threatening to sue over criticisms of his article; that's not what he threatened to sue over.
One of the fired CAP staffers, @KenGude, was fired while on paternity leave. CAP suspected him of leaking internal emails to @theintercept where CAP watered down criticism of the Saudis. CAP has *major ties* to the Saudi-allied UAE regime. But Gude wasn't even the leaker. https://t.co/IQemdBMkb7

Everyone knows exactly what's being implied when journalists "speculate" Graham is being blackmailed (they're too cowardly to state it, so they imply it). It invokes &amp; exploits all the worst stereotypes about gay men. At the very least, this "theory" should require evidence.
It's on the same level as the worst stuff Glenn Beck used to do at his Fox chalkboard, or the gross innuendo about how Obama was a secret Muslim Manchurian candidate: just as baseless &amp; dependent on bigoted stereotypes. But it's OK for many liberals because it comes from MSNBC: https://t.co/tEoGYS2SUa
@bmaz Yes, it's possible that the FBI has a huge pile of super-incriminating evidence that nobody has seen or heard about. Everyone admits this. Anything is possible. Nobody is denying that. All of these commentators are warning of the dangers posed by an investigation like this.

@ijbailey I agree with all of that. I praised Obama effusively when he became the first President to endorse marriage equality. https://t.co/BMDTZ5FRbq But it's repulsive to say, as @DavidKlion did, that he never inflicted harm on LGBTs relative to the status quo.
@RaniaKhalek @mehdirhasan @aaronjmate Right. I find several of Gabbard's statements &amp; positions troubling, as I've said repeatedly. But because she's relatively new on the political scene, many aren't fleshed out, are in conflict, etc. That's why I asked her to be interviewed to clarify her views. I hope she accepts.
@mehdirhasan @aaronjmate @RaniaKhalek Elizabeth Warren doesn't speak much on foreign policy but she's said some pretty horrible things about Israel and Palestine. I don't believe she ever criticized Obama for arming Saudi despots, the UAE and Sisi either https://t.co/qwEyKvMOoC

I'll spend my time trying to maximize the impact of my work.
@bruminger @DaveWuzzHere @MattBors I guess if liberals are going to rehabilitate George Bush, Bill Kristol, Robert Mueller, Max Boot, Nicole Wallace and David Frum, I shouldn't be surprised that they're willing to do the same for Bill O'Reilly.
@JulienHKK @ideasurge He didn't just oppose same-sex marriage. He specifically said it to RICK WARREN, and it was his rationale for opposing marriage equality that was so toxic: "God is in the mix," he told Warren, implying that God opposes LGBTs. That's extremely harmful "relative to the status quo."
@Abdisicky Having the Democratic Party leader sit in 2008 with a rabidly anti-gay evangelical pastor and say in public that LGBTs shouldn't be allowed to marry because "God is in the mix" inflicted huge damage on LGBTs no matter how you want to define it.
@mtracey I also sort of think that Obama's statements to ****Rick Warren**** that God opposes LGBTs made at the age of 47 when he was a US Senator and Democratic Presidential nominee were a bit more influential than Tulsi's statements made as a 20-year-old.
@ideasurge Yes, I praised Obama when he finally adopted the right position. But that doesn't mean one can whitewash his history by saying he never"inflicted harm on LGBT people" https://t.co/BMDTZ5FRbq
@bruminger @DaveWuzzHere @MattBors 1) I don't think Tucker is worse than the serial woman abuser &amp; unreconstructed racist Bill O'Reilly, whose show Obama, Hillary &amp; Bernie repeatedly went on. 2) I spent 20 minutes challenging Tucker's rhetoric to his face. 3) I was replying to Matt's bitter tweet about our shelter
@DaveWuzzHere @MattBors I should instead spend my time on MSNBC with their noble warmongers, ex-CIA operatives, Bush/Cheney WH officials, neocons, prosecutors and FBI agents.
@DaveWuzzHere @MattBors I appeared on Fox often during the Snowden reporting, along with Bernie, Hillary and Obama.
@Abdisicky I was specifically addressing his claim that "I don’t believe Obama ever inflicted harm on LGBT people relative to the status quo." Did you miss it? It was the first sentence. I also think Democratic presidential nominee Obama at age 47 had more influence than 20-year-old Tulsi.
@MattBors That segment raised a great deal of money for the shelter we built that employs &amp; re-integrates into society Brazilian homeless people as well as saving many suffering animals. Sorry if that offends you. Can you tell me what you do for those populations so I can emulate it?
I think Obama inflicted harm on "LGBT people" when he told *Rick Warren* in 2008 he opposes letting them get married because "God is in the mix," an affirmation of the toxic idea that God opposes LGBTs. But it's the sort of thing you overlook if you're a partisan hack &amp; not LGBT: https://t.co/IwG004kfZZ

A point I did make is to condemn the slimy pro-war rhetorical tactic of smearing anyone who opposes a war against Dictator X as a supporter of Dictator X: a tactic, I noted on Fox, was used by Fox to smear Iraq War opponents as Saddam-lovers.

@yeshuatrujillo Yes, and that's a really high bar to clear, given how many ugly buildings mar that city.
@politisteve Yeah, arming Ukraine &amp; fights over natural gas pipelines are totally trivial and obscure questions. It's true that they don't get much attention on MSNBC or CNN but they're infinitely more important to world powers than cable chatter. And Trump himself opposes the Kremlin on them

@PerAnRao Tulsi has many views that I find horrible and I don't support her candidacy and I don't know why this is so hard for some people to comprehend.
For English-language, highly illuminating tweets on Brazil and its new political era, follow @vpougy, a really smart young Brazilian journalist with @TheInterceptBr who is annoyingly super-fluent in English.
That a celebrated host of show on a major news outlet got caught blatantly lying - fabricating a story about a hacker &amp; an FBI investigation all to deny her own bigoted writing - and not only kept her job but got *praised* by her colleagues for it, is an under-rated media story: https://t.co/GDesVwUChV

@mcgill256 @Hareega_Blog @abcnews @jonkarl I certainly wouldn't recommend uncritically assuming Jon Karl's claims to be true given that he's citing anonymous sources and offering no evidence for those claims. I think it's worth noting given how much it cuts against the standard cable/Twitter consensus.
@vertuBA @blsteele17 @ConnerHabib My criticism of Joy Reid wasn't about her old homophobic articles. I said, in fact, people are entitled to change. My criticism of her was she blatantly lied - in 2018 - by denying she wrote them, fabricating a story that a hacker somehow did, &amp; claiming FBI was investigating.
I'm genuinely interested if there's anyone who believes the @Guardian/@lukeharding1968's "report" that Paul Manafort secretly visited Julian Assange 3 times in the Embassy? Same question for the MSNBC/CIA report about Russia attacking US "diplomats" in Cuba with a microwave? https://t.co/1XwknQ6paH

@84_redhead19 @SanaSaeed It depends. I think a lot of Tulsi's views are somewhat muddled and have changed over time and I'd like greater clarity on what they are now. I asked her for an interview to talk about those - so far she hasn't responded.
@Jafpro_16 @SanaSaeed Because I find a lot of the attacks on Tulsi from establishment Dems to be dishonest, hypocritical, inconsistent and slimy, even as I find many of the other criticisms of her - such as some of those @SanaSaeed raised - to be valid. I know that mixed bag is bad for Twitter.
@SanaSaeed I was just making the point that a common standard used to discredit people - "Bad Person X agrees with you or your view, which shows that you/your view is bad - can be used to discredit anyone. I was invoking that tactic to show how bad it is, not to affirm its validity.
@SanaSaeed Questioning the validity, rationale and consistency of some of the accusations made by establishment Democrats against Gabbard doesn't mean one supports Gabbard's candidacy and/or all of her views. I, for instance, do not.

@ConnerHabib That's how I took it.
@blsteele17 @ConnerHabib Did Obama and Hillary's close relationship with the extremely anti-LGBT Saudi regime (and UAE) call into question their bona fides based on the same reasoning?
@blsteele17 @ConnerHabib I'm not saying this is adequate but I'm just pointing out this is there and reviews her more recent positions and statements: https://t.co/vgju50QTWd
@ConnerHabib So there seems to be a liberal consensus that we forgive Hillary &amp; Bill (DOMA), Obama ("God is in the mix") and Joy Reid (too horrible and long to recount). Do we forgive Tulsi Gabbard?
@mcgill256 @rockomcneill "while he trashes literally everyone else": when did Trump literally trash Netanyahu and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE &amp; Brazil? I missed that. Also, the quote about no evidence having emerged was written by the NYT reporters who exposed the FBI investigation, not by me.
@jf_sd @theintercept Good journalists hide and lie about history if doing so helps the Democrats.

@rockomcneill Correct.
@rockomcneill You didn't read the article. But you still have an opinion on it. What do you think this says about your reasoning skills?
@KraftyHog You didn't read the article before tweeting that McCarthyite cliche at me, but you did perfectly encapsulate the mentality of J. Edgar Hoover which the article describes.

@ARKloster Is a time-traveling, still at-large hacker to blame for the bad past statements?
Do past anti-gay statements and positions permanently besmirch a person's character, or does evolving and changing and repudiating those past positions absolve them of their sins? It'd be good if we had a consistent standard on this question.
@matthewstoller Among the group of mainstream Democrats in 2002 and 2003 who were "against" the war, that - with some rare exceptions - was the prevailing argument. It was also the same rationale used by the GOP to oppose Obama's pullout from Iraq.

@matthewstoller @AOC I also think part of it is strategic co-opting: "if we embrace her instead of attack her, she'll become one of us &amp; train her (ample) firepower elsewhere." Dems have been good at cooptiong outsider voices before and some of these DC types definitely hope to do that with AOC.
@matthewstoller @AOC I think it's all of those things, but also that many of them haven't paid much attention to her besides the right-wing attacks on her and thus don't realize - yet - how scathing her critiques of the Democratic Party and Dem elites have been and, hopefully, will continue to be.
@adamjohnsonNYC Graham also denounces Trump when Trump deviates from Graham's ideology - as he did *just last month* with the announced Syria troop pullout.

@abelson_jeffrey @joshtpm @reinsteind LOL - Colbert mocked "truthiness" back in 2006: "sure, our key facts are wrong, but we mean well and our ideology is right so it's not really a problem."
@abelson_jeffrey @joshtpm @reinsteind Josh's tweet went viral *on Twitter.* Adding an editor's note to his blog doesn't rectify the huge factual error he caused to be ricocheted all over the internet. That's why the NYT reporters didn't just quietly append an editor's note but also tweeted it out. https://t.co/SLWkBv0tVw
This tweet is correct about Chomsky's long-held, absolutist free speech views. But it's not just Chomsky. From Berkeley to ACLU, free speech absolutism has long been a central, defining belief of the left, which never used to trust institutions of authority with censorship power: https://t.co/BD7kxm95sl
Also note - unlike the NYT reporters, who tweeted their correction - @joshtpm never bothered to note the central claim of his viral tweet about Manafort &amp; Deripaska was retracted. It wouldn't have mattered - retrations are ignored - but it's good to pretend to care about accuracy https://t.co/Wr7T9lPwCj

@MattBors @mtracey Finally: why are you maligning these obviously legitimate questions - asking politicians to reconcile their voting record with their current rhetoric - as "trolling"? You've invented a justification for these Dem leaders that they haven't offered for themselves. Very valid to ask
@MattBors @mtracey Also: if all of these reflective, contemplative Democratic leaders have searched deep within themselves and realized - due to Trump's crude rhetoric - that their prior votes to fund border fences were racist and morally wrong, how come they're not advocating they be dismantled?
@MattBors @mtracey Oh, totally: just like Cheney, Rove &amp; Wolfowitz moved people to the left on civil liberties &amp; war -- until Obama took over &amp; most of the "concern" disappeared. It's sweet to believe these politicians earnestly changed their mind but history shows it's usually partisan opportunism

I continue to think that social media venues have unique and important value, including equalizing the dissemination of information and ensuring that journalism and politics are dialogues rather than monologues. But they are uniquely ill-suited for conducting complex debates.

Under @MarcoRubio's oppressive bill (which, like most AIPAC bills, has broad bipartisan support): you're allowed to boycott a US state. You're can boycott US companies. You can boycott UK, Russia, Hungary, or China. You're just not allowed to boycott Israel. That's censorship.
@IAM4UK9 @RashidaTlaib @marcorubio She's defending the Constitutional Rights of Americans citizens under the US Constitution. The real enemy of the US are those who want to restrict and censor Americans' free speech rights in order to benefit another country - people like @MarcoRubio.
@metamitya @RashidaTlaib @marcorubio It does both. 26 states have different versions. It doesn't matter since the 1st Am also protects companies' free speech rights. But individual contractors often work as sole proprietorships so it censors them, too: https://t.co/bLfsQbL99B

Also: @marcorubio's tweet is stunningly ignorant. He thinks the 1st Amendment protects the right of *the Government* to punish private citizens for their speech.

@weinbergersa @AP Fair enough. I agree there's scientific/medical dispute on whether there are real injuries as opposed to (understandable) stress-related, group-driven psychosomatic symptoms. My main problem is the very inflammatory claims of MSNBC that Russia did it based on very little.
@justinjm1 @weinbergersa @AP You're right that the AP article was pretty neutral on whether this recording showed anything nefarious. And its first sentence did note (presciently, as it turned out) that the noise sounded like crickets. But many believed this was the harmful sonic weapon.

@naomirwolf Absolutely. The US has been working for years to weaponize microwaves and other sonic and electromagnetic devices. That's part of the irony of them using their servants at NBC to blame Russia for doing this.

@oneunderscore__ I'm not sure what I ever did to cause people who work for NBC News to "root for me" but whatever it was that I was doing to cause that, I'm glad I stopped.
@oneunderscore__ You didn't just re-tweet someone. You stupidly claimed that my re-tweeting Ann Coulter's endorsement of AOC's tax plan proves I have ideological proximity to Coulter. What you said was dumb &amp; false and now you're self-victimizing. The person you cited understood this very well: https://t.co/tu1sQVEKfv
@oneunderscore__ @KrangTNelson In journalism, we don't publicly make huge inferential leaps about other people's ideology, share our moronic accusations publicly, and then play the victim when the target of the accusation objects.
@akaniis @oneunderscore__ Yes, I would re-tweet Farrakhan or David Duke without context if they said something that was significant, newsworthy or notable. That's what journalists do: note significant events. And I'd regard anyone as an idiot who tried to exploit that to imply I agree with their ideology.
@oneunderscore__ @KrangTNelson What happened is simple: you idiotically took a re-tweet of mine - of an obviously newsworthy or at least notable tweet - and tried to imply it meant I agreed with the ideology of the tweeter. In journalism, we sometimes quote people we don't agree with to report on the world.
@GuyScotton Yes - as I think I said pretty clearly - I believe it helpfully draws a vivid distinction between a) proving one's virtue with empty, crowd-pleasing, tribal-appealing, mob-inciting tweets and b) the more difficult course of being virtuous through virtuous actions in life.
@oneunderscore__ "Not everyone is hanging on your every word my dude" - kind of an odd thing to say for someone who just spent a chunk of his Saturday posting at least 10 tweets trying to analyze the secret meaning revealed about my ideology by my re-tweeting an obviously newsworthy tweet.

@Stop_Groupthink @TheInterceptBr Brazil was governed the last two years by a center-right coalition that removed the democratically elected president. Prior to 2002, it was governed by a very similar coalition. Even when for the 14 years PT occupied the presidency, it had to rely on that coalition to govern.
@bmaz @NicolleDWallace That liberals now adore the Communications Director of George Bush and Dick Cheney - someone who literally worked under Karl Rove - seems very significant to me about the ideological realignment taking place under the Trump presidency.

@bmaz Rachel Maddow is by far the most influential TV liberal. She just re-tweeted her colleague - George Bush and Dick Cheney's Communications Director - suggesting Mueller should investigate Trump for his foreign policy views. I'm sorry if you think that's not significant but I do.

@NerdyOrc @washingtonpost OK. But I've been writing about the need for greater executive power limits since I began writing about politics in 2005 - it's what motivated me to start writing &amp; my 1st book was about it - and I guess I never saw it as "libertarian." Either way, it's definitely not new for me.
@steve_vladeck Fair enough, but in those examples, the Executive ignored/violated Congressional law - Bush/NSA violated FISA, Obama went to war in Libya after Congress rejected its authorization, etc. I don't think Congress has done a good job of safeguarding against presidential encroachment.
What "safeguards" existed on these powers when Bush/Cheney invoked Article II to justify torture, detention without due process &amp; domestic spying, or when Obama invoked it to justify war in Libya after Congress voted *against* it, or targeting US citizens for drone-execution? https://t.co/56jV7h9oto
@NerdyOrc @washingtonpost I never realized that wanting greater limits on executive power was "libertarian," but then again, I know that "libertarian" now means nothing more than "views I don't like but can't coherently malign" so I guess it doesn't surprise me.
Remember yesterday, when a long-time national security journalist quit MSNBC &amp; NBC in part, he said, became they have become captive to the national security state and central disseminators of mindless war propaganda in the name of stopping Trump?

I emailed Sanders' office on Dec 26 to ask his view on Syria troop withdraw - was told they were discussing it but he didn't yet have a position. As I said, people are entitled to time to address complex matters, but these debates are central &amp; ongoing silence is hard to justify.

@BigMeanInternet I think they're different issues. Did you read "Coddling"? One key point is that learning to do deal with adversity, rather than being shielded, is more important than ever given economic struggles &amp; inequities of millennials. I'm going to read yours, but they seem complimentary.

@karmabangarda @justinkcomer @Martina I agree people need space to grapple with and discuss these changes. But, for instance, exploiting aberrational cases of prison rape to depict trans women generally as menacing to cis women seems malicious and bigoted to me. But these lines are hard to discuss on Twitter.
@ze_rourke @Martina Yes, Martina was also a pioneer in gender, easily one of the most influential &amp; important feminists of the 20th Century. She endured ample vilification, and loss of sponsorships, as a result. She didn't "retract." She said she regrets nothing - just deleted in order to read more.
@karmabangarda @justinkcomer @Martina There's a difference between criticizing and vilifying. There's also a difference between a narrow concern (entry standards for trans women in athletic competitions) and a generalized denial of the validity of the trans identity.
@yungNleveraged @Martina I don't think a person's rights are less important because a relatively small number of people claim it (and it's unclear, actually, how small of a number it is and will be). Also, upholding a particular minority group's rights strengthens those rights generally, for everyone.
@LeftistWriter @Martina I agree with you. But sometimes misguided statements come from a lack of thought, not malice. And that's why it's better to engage *well-intentioned people* rather than vilifying them - especially in the case of someone like Martina with a life of self-sacrifice for these rights
@LeftistWriter @Martina But this is the whole point. Every major social change requires engaging people in dialogue, persuading them to think differently, and enlightening. Issuing decrees that only you can speak- &amp; everyone else must shut up, listen &amp; obey- is not just tyrannical but counter-productive
@justinkcomer @Martina Actually, everyone who has done great things at some point says some dumb and bad stuff. It's called being human. And it's why we don't publicly vilify and write off such people as bigots in the face of a lifetime of self-sacrifice and courageous battle in defense of this cause.
@LeftistWriter @Martina Absolutely not. Martina is one of the great pioneers of LGBT equality and visibility. Renee Richards became a hero to millions of queer youth, including me, because of her. I'm making a film about this inspiring history, so I'm going to decline your invitation to shut up about it
Because of the trailblazing of Renee Richards &amp; @Martina's characteristic bravery, Richards was one of the only trans people the public saw for decades, on TV constantly as Martina's coach. You can disagree with Martina's view without branding her, of all people, "transphobic."
Amazing: @Martina is one of history's greatest champions of trans visibility, having hired the trans pioneer, Dr. Renee Richards, as her coach *in the 1980s*. She's now being vilified as "transphobic" for discussing entry standards for transwoman athletes  https://t.co/HGRalNHZ5K

@OctaveFilms @davidsirota Yes, if there's one thing MSNBC fans cannot abide, it's "editorializing" sneaking into sacred journalism. As MSNBC's hosts teach us nightly, the role of a journalist is just to state facts with utter neutrality, not to express any opinions or editorialize in any way.
@jplang43 @CharlesPPierce @aseitzwald That's a quibble with the critique, which is fine. I think the emails on his role, combined with the flaws in the articles, justify that. But how is it "gutless" to publicly criticize a popular-among-DC-Dems NBC journalist with your own name attached to it &amp; the evidence cited?
Right. Aside from taking large amounts of money from one of the planet's most repressive regimes, CAP also rails against "Dark Money" even as it hides the identity of many of its largest, million-dollar-plus funders. How is that remotely defensible?? https://t.co/g0YJPOJtqF https://t.co/qXSd9HrZqu
@CharlesPPierce @aseitzwald What's "gutless" about it? I put my own name on my critique, and cited the evidence on which my critiques relied. Calling it "slander" without addressing that evidence is worthless. I realize he's your friend &amp; a fellow Dem but journalists can be critiqued; you do it often.
Finally, 2 reminders: 1) all of this erupted because @davidsirota committed the crime of reporting *the public votes &amp; funding* of a hyped presidential candidate; 2) one of CAP's largest funders is one of the world's worst regimes &amp; DC Dems are, for some reason, fine with this. https://t.co/zl1QMfAt5a
The evidence for the critiques of @aseitzwald is amply compiled in this article. Dismissing it all because of feelings toward the person who compiled it is lazy, empty ad hominem nonsense; if you want to refute it, you have to confront the evidence itself https://t.co/CXvW98aZ5T
As for the critiques of @aseitzwald, those aren't based on his ex-CAP status, but the flaws &amp; biases in his articles &amp; what the Podesta/DNC emails revealed about how the Clinton campaigned viewed/used him. It makes his friends &amp; centrists angry but journalists can be critiqued.
Ironically, the person who has most maligned &amp; "smeared" ThinkProgress journalists is Neera herself. She derided TP writers Jilani and Fang as "freaks," Shakar (now the @ACLU's Political Director") a "fucker," and in general said TP was staffed by "crazy leftists down there". https://t.co/eZFZ59khdW
I agree TP has produced great young journalists (Lee Fang, Zaid Jilani, Faiz Shakar, others). And TP has now negotiated for more independence. But evidence is clear Neera interfered to make its content more pro-Hillary &amp; less critical of Israel. Read it for yourself right here: https://t.co/m4YmxocDuO
If you want to claim "CAP has no editorial control over TP," must confront a) emails of Neera killing TP's Israel criticism after CAP's pro-Israel funders complained https://t.co/JUIGI5HUyj &amp; b) Neera &amp; Podesta plotting to change TP anti-Hillary headlines https://t.co/HQ5G0dVXyj https://t.co/ILn7AQ5RYN

4/ I've seen many saying - in the context of the Carlson campaign - that bigotry, racism, &amp; white supremacy are just "abstractions" for LGBTs and Jews (i.e.: "white guys") because they don't confront it in their lives. It's as ignorant as it is offensive https://t.co/kkyjaJEglg

2/ Recall in 2010, CNN fired Rick Sanchez for mocking that Jon Stewart's claim that Jews are "minorities" who understand bigotry. Few supported Sanchez. Yet this claim - that Jews (like LGBTs) are just "white guys" who don't understand bigotry - is a staple of Dem discourse https://t.co/YmiewxYPWa

Also, there is a virtually complete blackout in the CNN/MSNBC and bipartisan establishment universe on one rather key point made by @RoKhanna: the US military action in Syria is *illegal* under domestic &amp; international law. Watch @KyleKulinski: https://t.co/M3yPhKgXk2
This thread illustrates a crucial point: the Trump announcement on Syria combined with Mattis' departure has created unusual levels of bipartisan upset because one key prong of the DC consensus (which Trump at least rhetorically ran against) is Endless War &amp; Militarism: https://t.co/dvcGHwMdEP
In US political &amp; media circles, it's never the right time to withdraw troops from a foreign country, &amp; it's never the right way to do it. They can't admit what they really believe - the world is US property &amp; should control it forever - so those are the process excuses invoked.

@KlasicalLiberal The CIA regime change operation in Syria was one of the most expensive and important that agency has run in decades. Trump run in opposition to it; Clinton wanted to expand it.
@ChetRedwood Since the US is a country that operates with civilian rule, not military rule, it's the elected Presidents - not Generals - who makes these decisions. Trump's campaign entailed claimed opposition to these wars so the fact that Generals want to occupy forever is irrelevant.
@KlasicalLiberal From Obama and George W. Bush's CIA chiefs during the 2016 campaign: https://t.co/nNqGutrSNt
As is true of so many things that the CNN/MSNBC crew manically claims Trump is doing because Putin ordered him to: Trump's skepticism of the CIA presence in Syria was shared by Obama (just as the two shared a desire not to clash with Russia over Ukraine) https://t.co/4ZJsKOgC9T https://t.co/EduCnqQxwT
Trump's opposition to the covert CIA regime change program in Syria - in contrast to Hillary's vehement support for it (she criticized Obama for restricting it) - was one of the first &amp; biggest reasons the CIA backed Clinton in 2016 &amp; hated Trump https://t.co/4ZJsKOgC9T
Again: the Dem establishment is reading directly from the Cheney/Rove playbook to smear anyone who favors an end to Endless War &amp; imperialism in the Middle East - not just Trump but also (especially) anti-war voices within the Democratic Party, like @RoKhanna.

@LisaTMullin @Glinner @DrAdrianHarrop I said in the tweet to which you're replying: "@Glinner is fanatical about arguing trans women aren't women." The issue is whether that should be criminal, warranting investigating by the police. I don't think it is, though he seems to support such laws for his own enemies.
This was probably the worst case of UK hate speech laws: a Muslim teenager was charged with multiple felonies, including *treason*, for posting on Facebook that he didn't have sympathy for British troops who died in Afghanistan because the war was immoral https://t.co/041HNeRmCK

@studentactivism @DavidIDean Nate was making a censorship point (ie allowing corporations to dictate content can produce bad outcomes). Someone said: you wouldn't think that if you were LGBTQ. He said: I'm gay, that's a big part of why I think that. I said: this is a common dynamic in censorship discussions.
@studentactivism @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl I already answered this 20 times. See my discussion with Adam Serwer. I first made a general point about the dynamics of censorship discussions, then quickly added that whether advertiser boycott campaigns count as "censorship" is blurry and arguable. Can't explain it any more.
@BayArea4Bernie @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl Yeah, that was totally my point. Thank you for being one of the few people to be able to decipher it.
@studentactivism @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl OK, thank you for the fruitful and enlightening discussion. I really enjoyed it and hope we can do it again soon. Enjoy the likes and whatever other benefits you believe you get from doing this.

@karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl This is why Twitter is so fucking stupid - you get to just attribute shit to whoever you're talking to, designed to get you applause and likes, for people desperate for approval: like pretending that I'm against boycotts even though I wrote this not more than 2 hours ago: https://t.co/EvhkgaHXPu

@karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl I think Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights leaders of the 1950s and 1960s were pretty effective in changing views, as have subsequent attempts to use news, entertainment and political platforms to persuade others of the evils of racism.
@eliec76 @hasanthehun @JordanUhl Again, CNN just fired @MarcLamontHill because they - and many others - believed what he said was racist hate speech against Jews.

@Ralph_PipeKline @mehdirhasan It was a 20 minute interview. The first part was about an area where we largely agree (Trump/Russia), and the second part was about my challenging him on his racially inflammatory rhetoric and coverage choices. And I'm sorry if my denouncing homophobia upsets you.
@gaywonk It's not that I'm always wrong. You're just a Democrat. And while you were previously in the perfect place as a David Brock minion, you're still in a good place for what you are and how you think, so congratulations on that.
@JadeCar1 @mehdirhasan Since neither of us drink, that'd be wasteful. But incense and meditation music would be good.
@gaywonk The reason you think people are motivated to form beliefs based on petty desires like getting 3-minute cable hits is because that's how your brain works. If I cared about cable hits, I'd be screaming about Russia &amp; Trump all day. Some of us have actual convictions.
@mehdirhasan Yeah - I don't think Twitter is a good venue for discussing this. Yes, Adam originally had confusion about my point and I had confusion about his. We spent an hour discussing it productively, which is a minor miracle here. I don't want to tempt fate &amp; repeat it. Just read that.
@mehdirhasan As I'm sure you know, it's irritating when someone pops up to attribute to you a position they know is unpopular among their followers that you didn't advocate &amp; don't believe. And I had a lengthier exchange about Tucker's inflammatory show than anyone https://t.co/fK9oINMdMR
@mehdirhasan I don't think only minorities are against bigotry or anti-immigration rhetoric. Why do you think these big corporations are withdrawing from his show if he represents powerful, majoritarian factions? Because they're benevolent &amp; want to protect vulnerable minorities?
@mehdirhasan I had a long discussion with Adam Serwer and we had no difficulty understanding each other's positions. Please read it. I posted 3 tweets together, one of which *explicitly stated* advertiser campaigns aren't classic censorship &amp; I wasn't expressing a view on the Fox campaign.
@mehdirhasan The reason it's analogous to MLH is because that was a corporation disassociating itself from what it viewed as hate speech, exactly as Tucker's advertisers are doing. But you know your followers hate Tucker so you'll get likes if you convince them I'm defending him &amp; you're not.
@mehdirhasan This is why I'm not going to have this discussion on Twitter. You just attributed to me 3 views I haven't expressed and don't hold, beginning with your claim that I'm "not okay with boycotting Tucker" - a view I not only didn't express but repudiated. Just read the first line: https://t.co/QISuWgP2jH
@JoeySmoey5 @mehdirhasan Yes, I agree that was censorship, and denounced it as such. But by Medhi's standards, it can't be called that  - unless censorship just means "views that I like shouldn't be constrained, opposed or limited in any way." That's not my definition of it.
@mehdirhasan So I presume that's also how you feel about CNN's firing of Marc Lamont Hill, right? Not censorship at all - just a corporation not wanting to be associated with something they, and many others, deemed bigotry and hate speech?
@enzovala @jordanbpeterson My tweet had nothing whatsoever to do with any of that. It was about this: https://t.co/bLfsQbL99B
@JordanUhl I did not describe this as censorship. I made an observation about dynamics in censorship discussions ***generally*** and then ***immediately*** added that it's arguable ("blurry") whether advertiser campaigns of this type constitute censorship.

@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Right. I want to be clear that I don't regard boycotts as inherently illegitimate or censorious. I sometimes support them. I made a general observation about dynamics in censorship debates &amp; quickly added advertiser pressures are "blurry" if they fit there.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 So then you believe the views being protested as broadcast by Carlson/Fox are shared only by a minority, and rejected and even hated by a majority? That's also what I believe, and I believe that's why these corporations are doing this: they're siding with majoritarian sentiment.
@flightjkt @AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 If you think I'm motivated by a desire to have 3-minute hits on poorly watched cable news shows, why wouldn't I just constantly scream about Trump and Russia since that's the quickest way to preserve or gain access to those shows? I think your views of motives are dubious.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 If what you say is true, this is a case of large corporations siding with weaker factions at the expense of stronger and more powerful factions. That seems like an aberrational conduct model for large corporations to follow and I'm still unclear as to why they're doing that here.
@BrianVFox @AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Wouldn't "profit" and "PR concerns" cause a corporation to side with the powerful actors and majitorian factions, not against them? That's my point from the start.
@alochico @AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Yeah, I'm hiding by true beliefs because I'm petrified that people like you might disapprove. I value your approval so much that i'm willing to conceal and disguise my own convictions in order to earn it.

@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 You keep saying Fox and Carlson are the powerful parties representing majoritarian sentiments, while the protesters are weak and marginalized. That leaves me wondering why these big corporations are siding with the latter over the former. That's not what they typically do.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Why do you think all these corporations are pulling their ads then? Because they're benevolent actors motivated by a desire to protect marginalized, weak groups from powerful actors and majoritarian factions? That's not my understanding of how big corporations reason.
@flightjkt @AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 I've devoted the last 25 years of my life as a lawyer and journalist to an absolutist free speech position in the hope of preserving my ability to do a once-every-6-week 3-minute hit on a cable news shows watched by 1% of Americans. You nailed my motives.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Precisely because of the both-sider-ism complex, that mindset can be dangerous. Liberals demanded online giants censor right-wing content &amp; now leftists are being censored. European hate speech laws are often used against Muslims &amp; critics of Israel, etc. These tactics backfire.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 I think it's not only permissible but healthy and even necessary to ask not only whether a tactic will produce a positive outcome in a specific case, but whether usage of the tactic will produce bad and dangerous outcomes in general.

TV networks &amp; cable news programs air a *very narrow* range of opinion because they depend on corporations, which don't want to be associated with out-of-the-mainstream views. That's a repressive model. Ask @marclamonthill about it.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Right, and Nate's point is that vesting large corporations with the power to decide what political views can and cannot be aired on TV may serve your interests in isolated cases, but in general is a dangerous and perilous tactic to embrace because corporate values are very narrow
@shotchaser No, I made a general point about censorship debates, and then immediately stated that whether advertiser pressure campaigns constitute "censorship" is an arguable point.
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 Corporations, for obvious reason, try to pander to majoritarian sentiment &amp; avoid viewpoints that offend large numbers. That was Nate's point: if we allow corporations to dictate what can &amp; can't be aired, we will end up with "milquetoast both-sidesism with a pro-corportate bent"
@AdamSerwer @NateSilver538 I know what censorship is and therefore already made this point explicitly. Nonetheless, it was a common criticism on the left that the Jerry Falwell Right was trying to censor by forcing advertisers not to support pro-LGBT content, and "corporate censorship" is a real thing https://t.co/xAVOA7hZI9
@shotchaser I once saw an article suggesting that the use of bright colors can be a helpful aid for those with reading difficulties so I decided to try it here: https://t.co/BcBYDpyxh4
@Roran_Stehl "The government and big corporations are fascist and authoritarian, and I want to give them the power to censor because I believe they'll exercise it benevolently and to protect the most marginalized groups." How do people get themselves to overlook the self-negation of this????
I'm not expressing a view here on pressuring advertisers. It's blurrier than state censorship we reported this week with Israel Oaths (since it's using market forces). But in general, being a member of a marginalized group made me more wary, not supportive, of majoritarian power.
Like all powers, censorship will typically be used *against* marginalized groups, not to protect them. That's what it means to be "marginalized": that powerful factions act against you. The experience of being in a marginalized group should make one fear, not support, censorship.
This exchange with @NateSilver538 - after he denounced pressuring Carlson's advertisers - highlights a fascinating dynamic: if you oppose censorship, people (falsely) accuse you of not understanding marginalization, even though that's often *the reason* for opposing censorship https://t.co/I8FCEEac39

5/ These are why many of us have been resistant to depicting Russia as a Grave Enemy that did something unlike anything US (&amp; Russia) routinely do: not because we love Putin or are Kremlin assets but because we don't want more militarism, Internet control or a new Cold War. https://t.co/jyPy3SGAK3

@pickinjava @roddreher @amconmag I wrote many articles for @amconmag early in my journalism career - criticizing abuse of government power by Bush/Cheney - and was attacked by some liberals for doing that, too (same with my anti-Bush speeches at CATO). My principle has always been the same.

@Timbo88187293 I didn't say "all." I said Fox News were avoiding this story because it would offend their viewers - obviously I mean "many" or "most," - as evidenced by the GOP's support for these laws. I obviously didn't mean "every single last Fox viewer with no exception."
@J_Mark_Adams LOL. I literally represented the free speech rights of white supremacists as a lawyer, and as a journalist. I've repeatedly denounced left-wing censorship attempts. How many examples do I need to show you before you admit you were humiliatingly wrong? https://t.co/jdghrQCzGS
@Timbo88187293 Yes, as someone who follows US politics, I do know that US conservatives generally support Israel &amp; oppose the boycott, especially when it comes from Muslim women in hijabs. That's why most US states run by the right-wing of the GOP (like TX) have enacted these Israel Oath laws.
In contrast to Fox, here's how genuine conservative free speech defenders - despite disagreement w/the censored views - cover the story of legally imposed Israel Oaths in the US: by denouncing them as a grave threat to 1st Am: from @roddreher in @amconmag https://t.co/0Mvv8wSvFa

@blaktron @GlennMorin10 So if China and Iran and Russia start throwing Canadian intelligence officers into dungeons for spying on them on their soil, and keep them in prolonged solitary confinement - which is a form of torture - you'll cheer?
@SulomeAnderson @kenner116 Others in your time-line - including those who dislike me - have tried to patiently explain why you lied about what I said. I wrote the book that you deceitfully quoted from (without providing the link) so I think I know what it says. But I don't care enough to explain further.
@SulomeAnderson @kenner116 And just to be clear: I don't care if you delete it. I'd prefer you let it stand as a vivid and powerful example of how easily people lie about others on Twitter by taking statements out of context and purposely hiding the full context by not providing a link to it.
@SulomeAnderson @kenner116 I wasn't condemning McCain's personal life or casting moral judgments about his sexual choices. I was criticizing his *hypocrisy*: the difference between his public branding/claims and his own actions. The book is called Great American HYPOCRITES. It's about GOP hypocrisy. https://t.co/K7b6SboUpT
@kenner116 @SulomeAnderson Finally, I'll add that the reason I know Sulome purposely lied - as opposed to accidentally deceived people - is she purposely concealed the link to the full interview from which she copied that snippet, because had she provided the context, her lying would have been manifest.
@kenner116 @SulomeAnderson But, of course, since this is Twitter, Sulome knows she can lie about my views by stealing a tiny snippet out of context, lying about what I said, and then having people too lazy to check cheer her for it. It's so boring and doesn't matter but it's amazing to see it this blatant. https://t.co/53ehBgAzyI
@kenner116 @SulomeAnderson Sulome blatantly lied about the meaning of that passage. It was from a 2008 book that had only one topic: GOP hypocrisy. I never gave a shit about John McCain's personal life: the book was about the gap between GOP branding/packaging and their reality https://t.co/Wvuk51TY7M https://t.co/MzQRkdTVZC

@BenjaminNorton @BrasilWire Yeah - I agree with a lot of that, but definitely not all, but way too complicated even to begin on Twitter.
@GlennMorin10 The CIA and NSA are filled with people who spy on other countries for the benefit of their own government. Do they all deserve to be locked away in prisons, kept in prolonged solitary confinement, by the countries on which they spied? Or is it different when *Americans* do it?
@BenjaminNorton @BrasilWire I really like @BrasilWire. Is there a specific article you're referencing or just general coverage?
@BenjaminNorton @BrasilWire Yeah - PSOL was founded by former petistas who left in protest of Lula's welfare &amp; pension reforms and general accommodation to oligarchical wealth. For a long time, they were hard-core antagonists but have become less so with the dominance of the far right.
@4_hastings I guess it depends on whether you regard prolonged solitary confinement as inherently abusive. I do https://t.co/8wwwOjIdXF - here's a New Yorker article on why it's torture https://t.co/jhQ5rpic7t
@BenjaminNorton @BrasilWire I personally think the leftist critique of PT is more complicated and nuanced than that, but the critiques of PT from the Brazilian left are widespread and basically track those of the US left against the establishment wing of the Democratic Party.
@BenjaminNorton @BrasilWire It's just interesting because there's a strong movement in Brazil to the left of PT that has abandoned it or criticizes it based on the view that it became neoliberal and in bed with oligarchs that funded it - similar to the left's critique of the US Democratic Party.
Prosecutors explicitly apologized for falsely &amp; publicly accusing Butina of trading sex for benefits (though many who spread that calumny didn't). https://t.co/rZxbpmKkor - her prison abuse is only ignored if not cheered because she's Russian &amp; all Russians get what they deserve: https://t.co/hM0Uqpc4NA

@BenjaminNorton Is your point (genuinely asking) that prior critiques of PT were invalid, or that they ought to continue notwithstanding the election of Bolsonaro? The reality is PT isn't like the other leftist movements in South America. From a left-wing journalist: https://t.co/RJl211NP7l

@JimCavallaro @NPR @philipewing I agree NPR tries more strenuously, pitifully and zealously for fake balance and neutrality than almost any other outlet (AP may be the only competitor), but this isn't that. This is hard-core rejectionism of the prevailing liberal orthodoxy on Mueller and collusion.

@AlexYablon Sometimes a western media outlet publishes an important corrective that debunks what had been the prevailing orthodoxy in western media generally. I don't find anything odd or unusual about that - quite the contrary - but all individuals have their own experiences.

@DefTechPat @philewing He's doing what a journalist, by definition, does: describing the state of what we know based on available evidence rather than conjecture, fantasy, wishes, hopes and cable news chatter.
