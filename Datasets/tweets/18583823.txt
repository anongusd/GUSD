Gov. Northam's infamous statements are emblematic of the ideology of extreme, no-limits abortion advocates. There is no medical or scientific basis for violently ending the life of a child either while its mother is in labor or even after birth.
Virginia is one of a dozen states with a wrongful death law that protects the unborn throughout every stage of pregnancy.
Gov. Northam says "government shouldn't be involved," but his Commonwealth of Virginia is one of 39 states with a fetal homicide law that treats the killing of the unborn child as a homicide. (VA Code ¬ß 18.2-32.2)
Gov. Northam says both "government shouldn't be involved" and that as Governor he "supports more than one provider" in the case of late term abortions.
Gov. Northam asserts that "the infant would be resuscitated... and then a discussion between the provider and the mother" could take place. A discussion about doing (or not doing) *what* to a newborn human being, precisely?
Gov. Northam constantly refers to "the infant" as a distinct individual both in and outside the womb... but then says we "shouldn't tell the mother what to do with her body".
Gov. Ralph Northam constantly refers to "the mother" ("the mother in labor"). The mother of what?
"The government shouldn't be involved," Gov. Ralph Northam's Communications Director says. But the government and courts *are* involved and they dictate the law in Virginia and all fifty states.
So, Gov. Ralph Northam's statements should be discounted because he's a man? And Gov. Cuomo shouldn't be able to sign his New York bill because he's a man? And Roe v. Wade should be discounted because it was decided by nine men?
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's Communications Director Ofirah Yheskel says critics of Northam's "post birth" abortion views ("most of whom are men") are simply playing politics. That's satire level commentary.	https://t.co/Fu0ckAlnZg

What you should know about Norma McCorvey, 'Jane Roe' in the Roe v. Wade case. https://t.co/fFDwOrzxPb
McCorvey died nearly 12 years to the day (Feb 22, 2005) after the Supreme Court refused to hear her motion to reopen her original case. 2/2
In the late '90s, McCorvey became a pro-life activist dedicated to ending abortion. In 2003 she filed a case to overturn Roe v. Wade. 1/2
