If you did not see that press conference between Trump and Putin, please go back and watch the clips. It is the most startling press conference I have ever seen.
Well done @JonLemire . Thank you for your spot on questioning.
President Trump asked directly who he believes when it comes the Russian elex hack, US intel or Putin. "All I can do is ask the question....I don’t see any reason why it would be (Russia)."
So thankful for journalists like @jeffmason1 today.
RT @jdawsey1: "Yes, I did," Putin says, when asked if he wanted Trump to win the election. "Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia…
Putin answering @jeffmason1  q about extraditing 12 GRU agents to US: I don't know much about it. "i'll look into it."
Trump just now: "I think the probe is a disaster for our country.... There is no collusion." Does not mention any fault on the part of Russia.
Trump: "Our relationship has never been worse than it is now…however that changed as of about 4 hours ago."
Putin referring to the "so-called interference" in the 2016 election in opening remarks. "The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere" in internal affairs of another country.
Here's the DOJ indictment against the 12 Russian military intelligence officers.	https://t.co/Lo543PGQeO
The evolving definition of what constitutes 'fake news' according to the president is getting hilarious. First it's anonymous sources and now it's on the record, his own words, on tape.

And they are literally still on the very first question.
This hearing is literally BANANAS. That is a technical term for what's playing out in a joint House Judiciary and Oversight Committee  hearing right now.
This hearing has gone from fiery to completely explosive in 1.5 seconds.  		The theater, oh the theater of a House hearing.
Strzok: "I was one of handful of people who knew details of Russian elex interference and its possible connex w members of the trump camp. This info had the potential to derail, and quite possibly, defeat Mr.Trump. But the thought off exposing that info never crossed my  mind."
FBI Agent Peter Strzok testifying now on his text messages during the campaign. "unequivocally and under oath: not once in my 26 yrs of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took."  Happening LIVE now.
Rep Bob Goodlatte says that Lisa Page has agreed to appear before House Judiciary Committee tomorrow for closed door interview.
On Russia's annexation Crimea, Pres Trump blames Pres Obama again. "President Obama allowed that to happen...That was on Obama's watch....Would I have allowed that to happen? No. But he did."
President Trump says when it comes to defense spending commitments by NATO countries, the Sec General "he gives us total credit. And I guess that's me."
President Trump on NATO -- "Very unified. Very strong. No problem."
"The US was not being treated fairly but now we are." "I believe in NATO."  Surprising remarks from President Trump this morning. Quite a turn about.

I'm told the "hope" is to hold Hagel confirmation hrgs by end of month. But it could be a tight schedule with Senate out this week &amp; next.
Chair of Sen Armed Services Comm, @SenCarlLevin supports Hagel. "well qualified to serve" as Sec of Def." Promises "prompt" confirm hrg.

At the same time conservatives like Rep Jordan &amp; Rep Labrador tell me they still do not support tax increases.

Biggest headlines from GOP counteroffer -- no tax rate increases, $2.2 ba deal, $800 ba in revenue from tax reform, $600 ba health savings
House GOP make counter offer to Pres Obama on how they want to avert fiscal cliff. Here's link to letter: http://t.co/Omm8z0FI

2 final issues today for #scotus -  can the rest of the  law survive w/o the mandate and is Medicaid expansion unfair to states.
Historic Scotus arguments on the healthcare law have officially wrapped. Too close to call on a few fronts. Expect final decision in June.
Heading back in now for Medicaid arguments.  Big state's rights questions.
They seemed hesitant to go that far. But also had concerns of being in charge of picking and choosing what stays and goes. #tossup
The justices definitely had some very tough q's for the attny arguing they throw out the entire law if the mandate falls. (Contd).
Just out of scotus from part 1 of day 3. Hard to call where the justices are leaning on the issue of severability.
Yesterday's skepticism on Indiv Mandate raises the stakes for today's questions. #scotus #ACA
(Contd) if indiv mandate unconstitutional, can the rest of the law survive?
Final day of scotus healthcare arguments. 2 issues - Severability and Medicaid. Severability is the "domino effect" question. (More)
