@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Corporate culture. Because it makes ethical compliance economically incentivized. But it doesn‚Äôt change the theory that firms should be profit maximizers. 		We as a society need to change the standards that we accept from corporations and judge them with dollars.
@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Sure but the counterargument is that people don‚Äôt need quantitative metrics, corporations do. 		How do you compensate managers or affect stock prices by pure ‚Äúethical goodness?‚Äù		I think responsibile investing ‚Äúgreen investing‚Äù ‚Äúethical investing. Is the best way to change
@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Definitely true, but those numbers are impossible to truly calculate. Which is why a manager with the desire could make a convincing argument to shareholders why being ethical is in the best interest of the company. They often don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs possible under the theory
@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Most violations eventually get revealed. And then there‚Äôd be a large backlash. Being ethical from the start prevents those blowups
@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Right but how else should they be judged. I‚Äôm arguing that being beholden to shareholders can be expanded to caring about the welfare of society. Not in all cases unfortunately but often. 		I‚Äôm with you and think we should come up with a better metric, I haven‚Äôt been able too
@crashfrog @mattyglesias @matt_pociask Right and that‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm not arguing it‚Äôs an easy sell, but it‚Äôs still possible to be profit responsiblely and ethically compliant as well if managers desire to think that way. 		The issue is can we come up with a better/more logical metric to judge companies on?

@mattyglesias @matt_pociask I think the onus is on management to use the *purely for profit model* too look far enough ahead to realize that having standards above the basics that the law requires could be a net positive in the long run. Issue is with quarterly earnings reports few look at the longterm
@mattyglesias @matt_pociask I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs not difficult to extend that logic to ‚Äúprotect user privacy to the ethical standards, as the negatives of a backlash would outweigh any marginal revenue increases.‚Äù You‚Äôre right that a purely for profit motive isn‚Äôt perfect, but difficult to find a better metric.

@Shinobi_Tactics @coldxman I think there is a large portion of America that still teaches these ‚Äútraditional‚Äù values. And it‚Äôs prevalent in our media and culture. The push to counteract that is more overt but that is merely to try to pull the system towards true egalitarianism, which is currently is not.
@Shinobi_Tactics @coldxman Unusual bad take from you Shinobi. Completely ignores the historical precedents. 	In America wives have long been considered subservient to their husbands.

That‚Äôs not to say that completely ignoring the past is advisable either, but one needs to take a more wholistic approach and not immediately disqualify any candidate that voted on a bill that goes against your, or their current, beliefs.
Not too mention that beliefs are allowed to change as more information comes available. Do not forget that many of our current action will be deemed idiotic and barbaric by future generations; don‚Äôt be so arrogant to think otherwise.
We should probably not expect our politicians to be saints when analyttheir voting records. Amazing that some of the most politically knowledgeable people I know seem to forget that a lot of politics is compromise, and not ever vote perfectly aligns with a persons beliefs.

@AynRand_is_Dead @babadookspinoza That wasn‚Äôt my point, I was saying dismissing education as an effective way to prevent racism is silly. And focusing only on punishing overt racism misses the larger issue almost entirely. My argument is the worst racism is the implicit kind and you can‚Äôt really punish that away
@AynRand_is_Dead @babadookspinoza Not following your critique, these steps have been shown to decrease the amount of prejudice in a person (ex: https://t.co/PNWw6lIzEG) 		Sure we should condemn open racism but that‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg of the larger problem.
@AynRand_is_Dead @babadookspinoza Yes it is. You can educate people, change media representation, increase exposure to other cultures.
Also does anyone else have difficulty focusing on sports with all the shit that‚Äôs been swirling around as of late.  I love the NFL and NBA but it all seems pretty trivial right now.
@NolanWilliamsAZ @babadookspinoza Sure, the issue is the most powerful forms of racism are implicit and nearly impossible to prove, and often difficult to even see. This type of thinking only applies to large overt actions which makes it not that useful.
Definitely have a lot of things to think over. But I never thought what you learned in college was solely academic
@babadookspinoza Idk it‚Äôs been shown that exposure decreases bigotry. I think education is extremely helpful. What you‚Äôre suggesting won‚Äôt stop racism, it would just make it more subtle. 		I‚Äôm much more concerned about covert racism than the overt kind.

@imnotpaulcastro @KyleKulinski @Shinobi_Tactics The scope of my point.
@imnotpaulcastro @KyleKulinski @Shinobi_Tactics This message is neigh incoherent. And from what I could decipher you‚Äôre just changing the argument entirely. The argument is: Moving closer to equal representation of women/men in positions of power is progress towards equality. What those in power decide to do, is beyond
@imnotpaulcastro @KyleKulinski @Shinobi_Tactics Women holding positions of power at a greater frequency than the past is progress, yes. Did you miss the whole part about incrementalism or did you purposely omit that from your response?
@KyleKulinski @Shinobi_Tactics I think we must resist the urge to jump to the most ideal situation and celebrate incremental progress
@KyleKulinski @Shinobi_Tactics I think more woman and power is a positive step towards equality. Diversity in the future will hopefully not NEED to be celebrated, but until we reach more normal levels, and minorities (including women) are seen as equally capable we SHOULD celebrate it now.

Regardless, it‚Äôs important to remember that  the Fed Rate hikes are far and away the most important global economic event going on at this time, not Brexit, not Trade wars, and not tax cuts
To me its always interesting watching the constant battle between market players (short term focused) vs economists like the fed (long term focused). Id say in general they tend to agree, but the former is significantly more prone to scares, as only the first off the ship survive
Market obviously hates that, as int rate rises could slow growth even further. But we‚Äôre still growing wel above 2%, unemployment is still very low, it seems the economy is currently robust enough to build this buffer. I think the market got bit ahead of itself a bit this summer
I absolutely believe that we need to get interest rate levels back to some semblance of normalcy. If global growth is truly slowing, then we need the fed to have tools to stem off a potential recession. With int rates this low there‚Äôs not much they‚Äôd be able to do.

If it were easy, would you want it?
@a_portner I thought we agreed there was a gap between races
@a_portner Same to you
@a_portner But they have significantly more advantages than a black, when holding all else constant. And that shouldn‚Äôt exist
@a_portner And that‚Äôs fine, your original tweet implied you didn‚Äôt understand that there was a problem. And that I found to be egregious
@a_portner So minor compared to the disadvantages minorities face, and it‚Äôs trivializing to equate them as you did
@a_portner I fundamentally disagree, but this is far from the worst stance for you to take. 		All I ask of you is to think about the advantages you‚Äôve had, and be a bit more empathetic to the plights of those less fortunate. The privilege you equates in your original tweet is so minor
@a_portner And they should receive no help from those who have advantages? Even though many of those advantages were built due to prior injustices?
@a_portner And I believe they should receive help to level the playing field. I shouldn‚Äôt have educational advantages because of my wealth.
@a_portner I absolutely recognize that privilege, as you should as well. That aspect is huge! But even within America there are differences. I‚Äôm an extremely privileged person, I don‚Äôt apologize for it but I understand that people who haven‚Äôt been so fortunate have it harder
@a_portner The argument has been do they exist, and whether you believe they should be corrected. The first step was to get you to admit they exist, now why you don‚Äôt think they should be corrected is ludicrous
@a_portner Don‚Äôt need to apologize, to acknowledge the privileges you have man. It‚Äôs called being an empathetic human being
@a_portner That‚Äôs what you call theft lmao
@a_portner Explain another option here. Regardless of the cause of the opportunity differences, you either admit they exist, or that other races are inherently inferior. That‚Äôs the only two explanations for the gap
@a_portner Where did I say that. I just believe affirmative action is defendable, and that you at least should acknowledge your privileges as a white male. Being aware of them are how they go away
@a_portner Right and the point of affirmative action is to correct the economic differences so that the playing field is level. Then they should be removed.
@a_portner I think there should be equal opportunity in aggregate of the races, yes. And I believe that opportunity should be irrelevant if wealth levels
Such a gross misunderstanding of equal opportunity.
@a_portner So the thing is you either believe caucasians are inherently superior to other races, or you believe there is a difference in opportunity that‚Äôs causing these differences. Which one is it for you?
@a_portner However after you‚Äôre born, you should have an equal opportunity to do or pursue anything based on the abilities/capacity that you‚Äôre born with. No one is arguing for equal outcomes, which is what you‚Äôre assuming equal opportunity means
@a_portner Equal Systematic opportunity is very different. Every person should have the equal chance to pursue something, and should have equal likelihood of developing their abilities. You‚Äôre born generally how you‚Äôre born, although that‚Äôs a complicated issue that I won‚Äôt get into here.
Lmao https://t.co/g9gYJbsi41
@a_portner Equal opportunity is irrelevant to capacities. You had just as good of a systematic opportunity as anyone else in athletics. Terrible argument
@a_portner Interesting, would you say your fraternity provides more opportunities than a multicultural fraternity?
RT @a_portner: @thenning22 If you use it for that way it can give you one just like if you do well in school and your a minority affirmativ‚Ä¶
@a_portner Right but you want to get rid of my advantage right
@a_portner So you don‚Äôt believe in equal opportunity
@a_portner Why didn‚Äôt you rush a black fraternity
@a_portner Maybe, but it would‚Äôve been harder. And North Hills is so far from a bad neighborhood
@a_portner Does it give you a professional advantage or not?
RT @a_portner: @thenning22 It is not the governments job to solve fairness Tom, at least not in my opinion
@a_portner Why not, when they caused a great deal of it with previous actions?
@a_portner Bet you didn‚Äôt rush one of those either
@a_portner Without even close to the connections, they aren‚Äôt comparable you absolutely know this. I bet you didn‚Äôt rush a single African American fraternity, which do not bar Caucasian applicants
@a_portner Is that inherently fair? Does that not deserve to be corrected for in any way? This is a microcosm of the broader issue. But I think it explains it fairly well
@a_portner In the same vain do you believe being in a fraternity gives you a professional advantage compared to if you haven‚Äôt joined one? Are those connections and advantages then primary given out to white students, disproportionately?
@a_portner Do whites and blacks have similar income levels? Do you believe that blacks and other minorities have the same opportunities to join fraternities as whites?
@a_portner When did I say all whites people have dads that are CEOs. I used an extreme example to prove a point, that you weren‚Äôt understanding after explaining it more nuancedly
@a_portner Did you pay for that fraternity with your own money, did you know people prior to you joining that fraternity? Will that fraternity help you professionally in the future? Is your fraternity significantly less diverse than the US, than the rest of PSU?
@a_portner Are you in a fraternity?
@a_portner I‚Äôve explained countless times where some of the biases exist.
@a_portner You‚Äôre right if you look at legal rights, and incredibly wrong if you look at implicit rights.
@a_portner That‚Äôs not what I said, I‚Äôve said systematically.
@a_portner As demonstrated by countless statistics
@a_portner I do, I don‚Äôt tell my community they‚Äôre victims, but I acknowledge that it‚Äôs harder. I acknowledge that there needs to be avenues in place to equal the playing field. It shouldn‚Äôt be harder for me to achieve than it is for you. And currently it absolutely is,
@a_portner Right but you‚Äôre equating things that aren‚Äôt even close to equal.
@a_portner That‚Äôs such a small part
@a_portner I have been proactive, I‚Äôve done my part. I go to college, I‚Äôve achieved a high gpa, I have a full time offer at a top firm. And I did with a single mom, and through all the systematic difficulties I went through. And without any ‚Äúdiversity hire‚Äù assistance‚Äôs
@a_portner Took me minutes to find sources. And if you don‚Äôt have sources you shouldn‚Äôt make such bold claims, and disregard mine. You‚Äôve had educational debates in high school, you understand how ‚Äúscoring‚Äù works. How‚Äôve you been doing?
@a_portner And have not been the focus of many racial actions. If you don‚Äôt understand the difference in how this country has treated minorities like blacks and Latinos compared to Asians, you need to read history and pay attention
@a_portner Also culture is fixed by allowing upward mobility, and accepting that due to systematic disadvantages, minorities do often need extra assistance.
@a_portner Never said you‚Äôre responsible, also how is this relevant to what I asked.
@a_portner I‚Äôve managed pretty well
@a_portner They also have significantly higher median wealth levels
@a_portner How is culture created
@a_portner For longer than the civil right period when they were almost exclusively white and male.
@a_portner I‚Äôve used logic, I‚Äôve used sources. You haven‚Äôt. What else do you want me to explain. But if you look at the senior levels of companies they are all extremely white and male, and they have been for years (in fact have been worse so). And many of these companies have existed
@a_portner NYT cited legitimate sources for all their numbers. Show me another source that contradicts them with reputable numbers
@a_portner Do it in multiple tweets. You‚Äôve been doing it this entire time. As have I
@a_portner Yes exactly, don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs vague. And your counter argument of ‚ÄúAsian culture‚Äù is a poor one, as societal pressures exist that push Asians to perform well in school, as the societal expectation is that Asians are good students
@a_portner Right except the NYT is an infinitely more reputable news source
@a_portner Show a conflicting source
@a_portner Right that‚Äôs great theoretically, but completely false in practice. Many positions are filled with family members and friends. That fact is pretty undeniable. The kid of the CEO can get a job at the company, at a significantly higher rate than others.

@a_portner Which questions do you want me to answer. Here is what I want
@a_portner So many questions Don‚Äôt know how he furthered the divide, don‚Äôt know what divide you‚Äôre talking about. 	Don‚Äôt know how his 8 years in office are responsible for 60+ years of performance differences. Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre not providing sources, data, or any kind of evidence
@a_portner And yet so many of these jobs are filled with referrals and connections, which in theory should have minimal correlation with future job performance
Bruh I have the time today
@a_portner Your logic doesn‚Äôt flow, 	1. He did not do that	2. How is that the cause of systematic differences in minority performance
@a_portner Answer the question man
@a_portner 1. We‚Äôre talking about school performance	2. That‚Äôs completely wrong, connections play such a huge role in who gets selected for entry level jobs, jobs that teach the best and provide the most opportunity. 	3. Are you implying minorities are inherently worse workers?
@a_portner Also you‚Äôve only mentioned blacks, this is a problem with many other minority groups
@a_portner Bruh what. How. You gotta explain yourself on this one haha. Not only is this a ridiculous assertion, but it also ignores the fact that these issues are older than all of the leaders you‚Äôve mentioned.
@a_portner Also you still haven‚Äôt answered my question. What‚Äôs the cause of this performance gap?
@a_portner Why is there culture that way then?
@a_portner Right you‚Äôre going with your ‚Äúgut‚Äù and limited anecdotal evidence from going to a school literally getting investigated for racial practices. Come on man do you really not see the issues with your entire argument.
@a_portner Not answering the question
@a_portner Income
@a_portner Anytime man, you have my number
@a_portner Come on man, are you really that arrogant, that you‚Äôll ignore any evidence you disagree with, without any supporting evidence to back you up?
@a_portner Want to provide a study that ‚Äúis‚Äù . These are professional scholars, that you‚Äôre ignoring. People who are literally the foremost experts on the subject, but YOU an undergrad not even majoring in a subject relevant to the conversation, has the authority to shit them down
@a_portner If compared at the same income level? Then yes I‚Äôd say teacher bias plays a significant role. What would your explanation be?
@a_portner How so. I posted a source
@a_portner Explain why you believe this, despite so many studies showing the opposite. It seems you‚Äôve been projecting my friend, I‚Äôve shown sources, provided detailed explanations, and you‚Äôve shown nothing but conjectures		Even assuming you are correct culture and race are hard to separate
@a_portner https://t.co/VnzPorR7V5
@a_portner You‚Äôre going to argue in absolute terms, when the issue is clearly a percentage one. Come on man you‚Äôre better than that. And studies have shown that even blacks of significantly higher income still perform at the level of impoverished whites. Good read on that:
@a_portner Shown by the multiple studies.
@a_portner Bruh I show you multiple reputable sources from the same ‚Äúinstitutions‚Äù that you have complained minorities have overrepresentation at, implying that they‚Äôre clearly prestigious, and you just dismiss them. What facts won‚Äôt you dismiss, show me contradictory evidence to what was
@a_portner So what about the inherent advantages that whites had for centuries, enabling them to build institutions and accumulate wealth in ways that many minorities have just been recently able to? Was that the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù of course not. Your argument is contradictory
@a_portner In your opinion what is that difference? Is it more likely that minorities are inherently lazier? Or that there are systematic oppressions that have carried over from our countries extensive history of racism, and current examples of such?
@a_portner Also there are countless studies that show even minorities of the same wealth level typically earn less than their Caucasian counterparts. At every level, and yet intellectual numbers indicate that their isn‚Äôt a major difference in intelligence between races.
@a_portner Right that particular point, but Sowell‚Äôs argument is that, that is irrelevant as well.
@a_portner It is 100% disproportional against minorities, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been well documented. Good read is here: https://t.co/Egn7DUPVGi		Or here https://t.co/uxr8oyUAlX		Or here https://t.co/o8cNs8qJpa
@a_portner Where‚Äôs the 2nd injustice? Affirmative action merely tries to level the playing field, retroactively.
@a_portner Clearly we are better positioned to succeed than anyone from a poor school system, where they didn‚Äôt have our luxuries. This is something so inherently obvious.
@a_portner I‚Äôm familiar with Sowell, he promotes the typical republican ideology, that the differences between people are almost always individual differences and not the circumstances they grew up in. That‚Äôs baloney, we grew up in a safe environment, with an incredible educational system
@a_portner Oh yeah most definitely I started the conversation using a less than ‚ÄúPC‚Äù word, which considering I‚Äôve known you for years, you‚Äôve said much much worse.
@a_portner Right because for me to achieve the same level of success as you, while also being subjected to the inherent biases of teachers, and the negative societal pressures, IS more impressive.
@a_portner Also my dude, show me where you feel I‚Äôve been offended, or overly emotional. I recall you described Serena Williams, greatest tennis player of all time, as acting like a ‚Äúbrat‚Äù when she was really lashing back at someone who made an attack on her character and legacy.
@a_portner That without affirmative action to increase the number of minorities in prominent positions, would likely never correct themselves and would rather create a further gap. Ideally at some stage these ‚Äúquotas‚Äù as you call them, would be eliminated, however we‚Äôre far from there yet.
@a_portner Teachers instantly treat minorities differently, which often causes them to act out. For years minorities have been depicted in the media in a negative light, which instills the type of ‚Äúculture‚Äù that does not empasize achievement in the same way. This is a vicious cycle
@a_portner After the traditional education system, even in similar economic areas, minorities often perform significantly worse than their Caucasian counterparts. If you‚Äôve ever paid attention in a psychology course, you‚Äôd be familiar with a concept of self-fulfilling prophecy‚Äôs.
@a_portner Affirmative action exists, because there is a grossly underrepresentation of minorities in universities and many companies. This is due to systematic differences in how different minority groups are raised. At early ages, groups perform nearly equal on cognitive tests. However
@a_portner He drew her in a similar manner to Jim Crow era depictions, if you don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with that you need to brush up on American history. Also to attempt to equate that kind of ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to the systematic privileges enjoyed by the Caucasian race is beyond asinine.
@a_portner Such as
@a_portner Portner in what way are people afraid to call out inappropriate behavior in minorities? I‚Äôd argue that in fact it‚Äôs much more likely that when minorities perform appropriate behaviors often gets contorted to seem inappropriate, than whatever nonsense you‚Äôre peddling.
In addition, how much ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù/ ‚Äúfulfillment‚Äù is enough before you decide to change your perspective and take it easy? I‚Äôve found when I figured these things out about myself, my world opened up.
Not too say you can‚Äôt have balance, but you need to decide how much risk you‚Äôre willing to take, and how much you expect from yourself. Whether you‚Äôre comfortable striving for, or even expecting, neigh-unreachable goals, or do you prefer to strive for what seems reasonable?
Forreal though, I think at some point you need to look in the mirror and decide what kind‚Äôve person you‚Äôre going to be, one that takes risks and constantly strives for more, or someone that avoids mistakes and works towards leading a content and fulfilled life.

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all sheeple‚Äù tweet. But to me it‚Äôs always fascinating to see two sides push out there message. 		Regardless it‚Äôs ridiculous that there is such an outrage towards someone who choose to peacefully protest something he didn‚Äôt believe in. Hypocrisy is rampant
Very interesting to see the political/corporate machines try to work the Kaepernick Nike ad. Burn/boycott Nike, countered by ‚Äúyou should donate them if you truly cared.‚Äù Wonder what the rights next retort will be.
