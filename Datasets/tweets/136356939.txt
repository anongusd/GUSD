@COJasonGlass We appreciate the dialogue, our overall point is we should ask teachers, there should be more surveys like the one we do.
@COJasonGlass As supt. you can add requirements. This just doesn't handcuff you if you find talent to develop that hasn't checked boxes.
@COJasonGlass And the low bar for entry is to be an apprentice, not a fully credentialed teacher. That requires demonstrating effectiveness.
@COJasonGlass Admittedly, defining effective class performance is the trick. But that should be the focus, not what you do before entering.
@COJasonGlass We asked teachers. Most believe that barriers should be based on in class performance, not a pre-service checklist.
@COJasonGlass That is just to become an apprentice teacher. In order to receive a prof. license you must complete a 1-3 year residency.
