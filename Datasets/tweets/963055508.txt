@JohnCornyn Why don't the Republicans help Trump by not causing nothing short of a crisis. Past 100 days a disgrace. Life long GOP regretting devotion
@realDonaldTrump You have the ability to be a great president but firing Comey does not help your case. Please correct this ship before it is too late.
@RepGoodlatte Donald Trump firing Comey is a disgrace. I am a devout republican but King Trump and his merry men and women are making me rethink that.
@realDonaldTrump As a devout republican, please deal with the facts instead of attacking Everyone.
@realDonaldTrump Slandering the men and women who are patriotic and risk their lives everyday is unamerican.
@realDonaldTrump Rewrite so it will be upheld by the courts.
@realDonaldTrump yes but not on the xenophobic way being implemented and this from someone who voted for you enthusiastically.
@realDonaldTrump voted for you but now ashamed of vote! Will never vote for Donald Trump again.
@DrWoodallND I look forward to learning more as  I definitely want to have a partner to deal with my list of ailments more holistically.
@DrWoodallND Definitely interested in learning more and whether your services will fill what I am looking for.
@DrWoodallND Have appt in March but would like to learn more about some of what you do as looking to make more holistic approach to health.
@GavinCreelFans1 cute dog
@GavinCreelFans1 social media can be time consuming that's for sure
@GavinCreelFans1 that's too bad!
@GavinCreelFans1 Is he ever on twitter anymore?
@LunaticNation Until they make up I am taking a hiatus from Days
@LunaticNation Freddie is a great actor.  Look forward to watching him again when I return as a viewer.
@johnwalterseip @soapwikijohn They are still trying to work out a distrubition deal.
@BEFREE81787147 @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith Be Free I disagree with many of your opinions but there is no doubt you are a great artist.
@_icla_ @BEFREE81787147 @nbcdays We will all have to agree to disagree
@freddiemsmith This is a fabulous picture - I can see the love in your eyes.
@WHLive Obama should be impeached for not pushing for permanent payroll tax cuts which impact all American.  I lose close to $2K per year.
@BEFREE81787147 @_icla_ @nbcdays I know you feel that way but I disagree and I do not think that is the way that writers are going to do it.
@excuseyou77 @BlakeBerris Brandon, if you need any advice let me know.  I know the difficulties of coming out.
@excuseyou77 @BlakeBerris Good luck Brandon with that.  That is awesome and hope everything goes smoothly.
@BlakeBerris And to get cast members of my all time favorite tv show Days of Our Lives which I have watched for 42 years to follow me. :)
@BlakeBerris Stop throwing things at my tv when some Days characters show up on my screen and be more positive.
@BrandonSufronko @hpcharmed If Ill did pass it, considering Salem set close to Chicago, I can see them getting married by the end of 2013.
@Luv_WilSon He is clearly the best actor on Day and probably all of tv.
@Luv_WilSon @ChandlerMassey I couldn't have said it better myself
@BrandonSufronko Don't get overly excited about a reboot.  There is still a lot of uncertainty and no guarantees.
@BrandonSufronko That's old episodes right?
@Luv_WilSon I could be reading to much into it.  It just seems they do not consider him as much of a Horton as Nick but Jenn is his aunt.
@Luv_WilSon Maybe it is me but the Hortons don't really treat him like a Horton.  Jennifer hugged Lucas but didn't Will.  I could be wrong
@Luv_WilSon Doug was but Julie seemed a little witchy to me.
@JCerchia @Scarrrycheri @SoapSmackTalk Could not agree more!
@Luv_WilSon @DaysHayes Only bring back Doug and Julie if they are going to be nicer to Will after all he is just as much a Horton as Nick.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel Maybe it's a flashback to Nick being raped in prison.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel I can't help but wonder who goes to jail.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel I just don't want Gabi to lose the baby.  Too many babies have ben lost on Days in recent years.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel I'll have to go look - I bet either Nick or Chad are in prison if true.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel I would love it if that became a reality.  I so hate Gabi and Nick.
@Luv_WilSon @tbayles @1_PrincessAngel I'd pay money to have nick have the crap beaten out of him.  Prison scene Rachel?
@tbayles You better be right Tonya!
@fsmithfans @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Hope Will and Sonny make up and move in together before Valentine's Day!
@BEFREE81787147 @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith Totally agree - how about Will and Sonny move in together for Valentine's Day
@BrandonSufronko @ChandlerMassey @BlakeBerris It was a fabulous scene although Chan should have punched Blake's lights out!
@Wilson94Mimi @TerriDayz777 I didn't see or hear the interview but I sure hope you are right Mimi.
@Wilson94Mimi @TerriDayz777 I hope he asks Will to move in on Valentines Day, they make love and they decide to fight Gabi for the baby.
@BrandonSufronko @Ari_Zucker @galengering I think the show should give up on Safe and put Nicole and Rafe together and Sami and EJ together
@nelliebranco Is Kanye and Kim having a baby a sign that the Mayan end of the world is really happening???
@TerriDayz777 I know they will break up for a little while but they better be back together and living together by Valentines Day!!!!!!!
@TerriDayz777 He should have punched Nick out though!
@Wilson94Mimi @GaysOfDays I hope so Mimi but I didn't hear the line so was it from today's episode or from some preview?
@GaysOfDays When was that said?
@_icla_ @nbcdays There may be a few days where Sonny is mad and will not wan to talk to Will but no cheating or breakup, just don't see it.
@Britttanyyy_13 @Wilson94Mimi How about them moving in together on Valentines Day.
@excuseyou77 @BrandonSufronko I'd do cartwheels if only I knew how! Kill off Nick, send Gabi to prison, I wouldn't be able to contain joy.
@BrandonSufronko Why not, once everything goes down Will won't be her biggest fan.
@1997jaden @BrandonSufronko What article?
@1997jaden @BrandonSufronko Where did you read all of this?
@EJamiLoveDays @Wilson_FTW I hope Will and Sonny fight for custody as a couple with EJ helping them.
@BrandonSufronko @TerriDayz777 I could go for a custody battle I thought meant nick trying to break them up.  Why bring back T?
@BrandonSufronko I don't get what he can do.
@BrandonSufronko Someone's out to destroy their relationship?  Who?
@iheart_Sonny I am okay if they do not talk or breakup for a couple of weeks, I just hope they are back together by Valentines Day
@iheart_Sonny How accurate are their previews?
@_icla_ @nbcdays Respectively disagree
@_icla_ @nbcdays Respectively and strongly disagree.
@LunaticNation Assuming that there is a breakup.
@kyleo71 Agreed and I loved many of the actors on the show.
@kyleo71 That was a little much but in general I wish it had been given more time.
@NancyPelosi Malarkey considering payroll taxes go up on middle class americans effectives Jan 1 and you did nothing to prevent that
@kyleo71 Generations was a show that should have been given more of a chance.
@DrakeHogestyn Would like to see John and Marlena get more involved with Will and Sonny and the whole baby mess.
@BarackObama Obama doesn't care about middle class if he did would have made sure FICA rates weren't going up Jan 1st.  ALL LIES - IMPEACH
@whitehouse But the White House and Congress screwed middle class not renewing the payroll tax cuts so Obama doesn't care at all.
@kyleo71 I didn't watch Texas but watched All of the Classic Soaps back in the day.
@kyleo71 I LOVED The Doctors
@johnwalterseip And Andrew is dead so  that would have made everything easier.
@NickKristof Lemmings and preschoolers could probably do a better job than both parties and both chambers in D.C. now.
@Ali_Sweeney Starting CrossFit
@excuseyou77 @soaphunks @ChandlerMassey Way to go Chan
@cmasseyfans @ChandlerMassey We love Chandler
@_icla_ @nbcdays Angry and crushed yes but not enough to breakup with Will
@Luv_WilSon @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith You are both the two best actors not only on daytime but on tv all together.
@freddiemsmith Happy 2013 to you too.
@Wilson_FTW @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Couldn't have said it better myself.  We all love you both and the work you are doing.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon You are right but I still think the producers plan on them living together in January.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon it could speed the recovery and I know they said they would take the next big step which to me is living together
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon Maybe they'll decide living together will help them fix their relationship and rebuild trust.  I HOPE SO
@Luv_WilSon @Wilson94Mimi I saw that but I just read it as it happened before the wedding so baby reveal could interfere, I HOPE NOT
@Luv_WilSon @Wilson94Mimi I just hope they still move in together in January.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon They committed to each other and if work hard it can get better and stronger.  Think they need to live together.
@Luv_WilSon @Wilson94Mimi Agreed, that's why they should not breakup but just fight through it by dealing with their trust issues.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon That's why they need to not breakup but just work on their trust issues.
@Luv_WilSon @Wilson94Mimi When say instant forgive I mean no breakup, still live together and work on trust issues.Breakup would be stupid.
@Luv_WilSon I pray you are right. They should move in right away and fight through their problems which is what me and my significant did.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon Sonny better instantly forgive Will and together put the screws to Nick and Gabi
@Luv_WilSon And we raised his child together
@Luv_WilSon @Wilson94Mimi My fear baby break them up which same old.If they live together right after reveal and fight through that's diff.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon Yes - We have been together for 25 years
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon I was just like Will when I was his age so I definitely relate and I had someone very much like Sonny
@Luv_WilSon Because if they treat it like every other love story there will be meddling parents, lovers and all of that BS
@Wilson94Mimi @Wilson_FTW @Luv_WilSon All of your positive attitude is so nice to hear.  Your patience is admirable.
@Wilson_FTW @Luv_WilSon Wish I had as much faith and patience as the rest of you
@chucktodd A shame since payroll taxes are increasing regardless of what these morons in Washington D.C. are doing.  Impeach them ALL
@iheartwilson @tbayles @Luv_WilSon @TerriDayz777 Sorry you were abused, I do know what you probably went through.
@Luv_WilSon @iheartwilson @TerriDayz777 I think Nick raped in prison. Abuse is not a pretty story as one who lived it know but it important.
@Luv_WilSon @iheartwilson @TerriDayz777 I'd like to learn what happened to Nick in prison to make him more obsessive and homophobic.
@Luv_WilSon @iheartwilson @TerriDayz777 Having Gabi being abused good twist in the storyline as long as it happened after the birth.
@CNNPolitics Who cares, we are all still taxed more with payroll taxes going up on the middle class.  They all should be impeached.
@BarackObama I voted for you but you should be impeached for not insisting extension of payroll tax cuts.
@NancyPelosi You should all be impeached if the fiscal cliff deal is not passed
@ForeverBossy26 @ChandlerMassey @Bryan_Dattilo @freddiemsmith Loved these scenes
@JoeNBC Yeah but aren't they just doing the taxes now and doing everything else in the next Congress.  Btw Scarborough 2016!!!!
@iheartwilson @ChandlerMassey Congratulations!
@iheartwilson @ChandlerMassey Great acting and the scenes should get you a second Emmy!
@iheartwilson @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey @nbcdays Big Congratuations - I would vote best couple in 2012 too.
@Wilson94Mimi @Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko No storm just rough waters please and be living together during the rough patch.
@Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko I am hoping that there is no breakup and that there is just a lot of tension.
@Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko Hope you are right.  They better have only turmoil and no breakup of Gack and have WilSon move in together.
@Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko I wish I was as confident
@Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko I agree but Will was too new to being "out" to have been serious where now he is.
@Luv_WilSon @BrandonSufronko Not sure either were serious at the time but now I think it would be serious.
@Luv_WilSon @GaysOfDays Hopefully in early 2013 too.
@BrandonSufronko @GaysOfDays It would be nice to see Sami and Kate on the same side for a change.
@GaysOfDays @BrandonSufronko I so hope that you are both right and a wedding in the not too distant future for WilSon is in the cards
@ShorteeMichelle @BrandonSufronko @ACminaj95 Yeah
@4luv4all @nbcdays @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Couldn't have said it better myself.
@DaysCafe Is that in U.S. too, my DVR says it will be a new episode so I am now confused.
@GaysOfDays Sonny will give Will the key, Will will move in but there will be tension over the baby reveal.
@BrandonSufronko Like your thinking!
@TVGMDamian Something weird is going on in this world when that happens.
@ThSoapWhisperer We're assuming it is a firm deadline w/ABC.  It would not surprise me if extension either had been or is being negotiated.
@ThSoapWhisperer Not enough details are really available to make a conclusion.  They could be hoping to start in February prelim work.
@meredithshiner @SenatorReid Politicians like Reid are corrupt and do not care about he average American.  I wish I could take my vote back
@KatrinaNation Here's to Obama being the Worst President in U.S. history.  My he must be proud and I wish I could take my vote back.
@jonkarl Disgusting that these idiots find that me losing thousands in dollars in take home pay to care for my two year old to be funny.
@johnwalterseip Agnes Nixon hands down.
@BrandonSufronko Well sorry to disappoint. Will watch the other stories but if a breakup means fastforwarding to the next storyline
@excuseyou77 Enjoy watching the wedding
@1997jaden Reason enough for me to quit watching.
@Wilson_FTW @La_Ashleigh I'll watch the drama until the breakup and then I am done.
@Wilson_FTW @La_Ashleigh I guess I will be quitting the soap after the wedding.
@Wilson_FTW @La_Ashleigh Will and Sonny had better not breakup even for a second.
@johnwalterseip @ChandlerMassey Congratulations!
@ChandlerMassey Congratulations - You deserve it.
@toner40 @BrandonSufronko We'll just have to see how he handles it long term - I think they will stay together through it all.
@JonCarson44 I care my taxes go up on 1/1 and I will have less take home pay to raise my child due to Obama, Reid and Pelosi's ARROGANCE.
@JonCarson44 If I could take my vote back, I would because Obama is solidifying himself as the Worst President this country has ever had.
@JonCarson44 @whitehouse Instead of blaming congress, democrats should compromise with the republicans instead of demanding all or nothing.
@johnwalterseip Totally agree.  Not sure Claire Labine would be right choice but there are other veterans still around who can contribute.
@johnwalterseip If OLTL/AMC come back they need veteran head writers who know the history.  New blood as a complement isn't bad though.
@Erica_Love16 @days @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith This was so great - More of this please.
@Wilson94Mimi @BrandonSufronko @Joanie_Vinson What song did Will sing.  Chan can sing in real life.  Will clearly not religious
@BrandonSufronko Why didn't she hug them then
@BrandonSufronko I love WilSon
@JoshuaMorrowYR Xmas is a conspiracy between the toy makers and the battery companies
@1997jaden Will or Sonny had better punch Nick's lights out pretty soon!
@Joanie_Vinson @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Couldn't have said it better myself.  Freddie and Chan made 2012
@JusticeGMH @kyleo71 LOL
@Britttanyyy_13 @excuseyou77 @Chandler Massey I love Chan, Will, Freddie and Sonny
@kyleo71 Just checking because I love Will and WilSon.
@kyleo71 What's wrong with that?
@camilabanus @MiguelAlfaroVar @BlakeBerris @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!
@Luv_WilSon @ChandlerMassey Could not have said it any better!
@1997jaden @camilabanus @MiguelAlfaroVar @BlakeBerris @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey TOO CUTE
@JoshuaMorrowYR And the Seahawks are also paying pretty big bucks to have their backup QB on the bench
@WillHortonDAYS @ChandlerMassey I love you both!
@RobAnthonyD huh?
@BrandonSufronko @ChandlerMassey Chandler, Same from me too.  May you enjoy your time with your family and have a safe New Year.
@BrandonSufronko It's not that bad Brandon.  Days will be on every day of the week so it can't be all bad - GO STEELERS!!!!
@davereichert  As a Repub in Snoqualmie with household $120K, my tax rise by $6K thanks to the cold-hearted Repub Party. You lost my vote
@GOPLeader  As a Repub whose household is $120K, my tax rise by $6K thanks to the cold-hearted Repub Party. Ashamed of being Repub.
@SpeakerBoehner As a Repub whose household is $120K, my tax rise by $6K thanks to the cold-hearted Repub Party. Ashamed of being Repub.
@johnbeene @ChandlerMassey Amen - as someone who struggled himself this story the most important and impactful story Days ever told.
@johnbeene @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Happy New Year and Merry Christmas to two great actors.
@DonaldGBoudreau Considered they cancelled one of the shows that replaced them and Katie is getting less than stellar ratings.
@ScottFeinberg Ok I would never have guessed that.  I am a movie buff but don't think I've ever seen that one.
@ScottFeinberg Isn't it All About Eve
@SourceRyan Totally agree.  Either or both shows coming back is a long shot at best.
@johnwalterseip ABC always said they will lease the rights but not involved in production and I doubt Disney corporate has changed its mind.
@johnwalterseip They will always own the rights but it was not Frons final decision to cancel the higher ups did to so not likely.
@johnwalterseip ABC wants to have limited involvement which is part of the reason it never got off the ground in the first place.
@johnwalterseip I know but remember it may not even be at ABC studios.  All that still has to be renegotiated.
@johnwalterseip Agree but the logistics would not work out.  That is why OLTL was not moved in the first place.
@EBraeden You have common sense and understand the issues.  No purpose to many guns available other than mass murder.
@johnwalterseip Think OLTL will stay in NY and AMC in LA
@dcconfidential @BrandonSufronko OLTL could live without Todd if they brought Victor back
@EBraeden Couldn't have said it better Mr. Braeden.
@BrandonSufronko @cotygirl Don't get your hopes up about OLTL coming back
@Lulumama09 @BrandonSufronko @nbcdays @ChandlerMassey @DeidreHall Chan deserves another Emmy.Need Chan and Kate too,Will;s Kate's soft spot.
@BrandonSufronko Love it so far!
@ChandlerMassey Have a great holiday with your family - hope the weather isn't too bad down south.
@freddiemsmith Have a great holiday with your family.
@MariaCantwell Because of your refusal to make a deal, my taxes (120K in income) will go up about $6K. YOU ARE THE WORST SENATOR EVER!
@CantwellPress Because of your refusal to make a deal, my taxes (120K in income) will go up about $6K. YOU ARE THE WORST SENATOR EVER!
@PattyMurray Because of your refusal to make a deal, my taxes (120K in income) will go up about $6K. YOU ARE THE WORST SENATOR EVER!
@BarackObama Because of your refusal to make a deal, my taxes (120K in income) will go up about $6K.  YOU ARE THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER!
@BrandonSufronko What'd you get?
@kyleo71 Almost everything about Days was better in the 70s.
@ChandlerMassey What are good Crossfit and hiking shoes.I'm a huge fan and hope you stay on Days Forever. Merry Christmas and enjoy family!
@KatrinaNation Don't think so - not liberal enough for the Dems and now not conservative enough to survive Republican primary
@michaelmuhney Think you are being kind Michael - Try their IQ disappears entirely.
@BrandonSufronko Old news Brandon but that is why Nielsen is looking to include DVR and twitter into their rating analysis.
@cmasseyfans @ChandlerMassey Great picture!
@BrandonSufronko YES!!! YES!!!
@NancyLeeGrahn Nancy, just like to say that there are some Republicans who have common sense and thing the current party is too extreme.
@LuvsMeSomeEJ No new gay characters - Let Will and sonny be a happy couple for a long time.
@BrandonSufronko Don't get too upset yet
@BlakeBerris I thought the world was supposed to end this morning
@MandieBlanchard @BlakeBerris I hate Nick and I want him off the show so badly but Blake is doing a great job.
@NancyLeeGrahn My son is almost two but I know I do not want him in school where teachers and other are carrying guns and I am a Republican
@MiaFarrow @jayrosen_nyu Only the NRA and Wayne LaPierre could be so tone deaf as to what is going on in this country in regards to guns
@TheRealStafford Love you on Y&amp;R but you must have been a naughty child if grandparents buying for grandchild.
@BrandonSufronko I'm in love
@BrandonSufronko Just liked it!
@BrandonSufronko Not yet.  What is it again?
@BrandonSufronko Just too much negativity.  Belong to other Days group
@BrandonSufronko I left that Will and Sonny group too much negativity
@excuseyou77 I can't help but think something happened in prison and Nick might be gay or been raped.
@BrandonSufronko Watching Days and Jenn's reaction to Kristen and Brady - I LOVE IT - I LOVE DAYS
@BrandonSufronko Watch tomorrow it is going to be GREAT!!!
@BrandonSufronko I also don't know why some people are even watching WilSon or Days when all they do is complain!
@BrandonSufronko With all the negative comments from others on Facebook/Twitter regarding Will and WilSon - your positive attitude is great!
@johnwalterseip @BrandonSufronko @TerriDayz777 Wonder if they move in together right after the new year
@johnwalterseip I was interested in the next big step which would seem to me to either be living together or marriage.
@BrandonSufronko I don't know if minority or minority is just vocal.  Some rather Days cancelled, they'll never be happy no matter what.
@BrandonSufronko Or they want a breakup - it is all over facebook and it really ticks me off.
@BrandonSufronko @nbcdays I love that
@BrandonSufronko @nbcdays @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith Especially WILSON
@BrandonSufronko You don't read Days Cafe for future day do you? Days is going to be really good tomorrow.
@BrandonSufronko It really annoys me!
@BrandonSufronko I so loved these scenes.  Too many negative people on facebook bout the relationship and how it is being portrayed.
@BrandonSufronko @nbcdays @ChandlerMassey I am loving Days, WilSon and Chan
@BrandonSufronko @Ali_Sweeney @ChandlerMassey That episode was fabulous and I cry all the time too.
@BrandonSufronko Any episode with Will, Sonny, Sami and EJ is good.
@ShorteeMichelle Nice to see that Simon Cowell recognizes this kind of tragedy.
@BrandonSufronko @1997jaden They are doing it on Twitter and Facebook and it makes me angry!!!!
@BrandonSufronko Of course we missed you kiddo
@johnwalterseip Stefano fakes baby death and gives child to Kristen to raise with Brady
@johnwalterseip Especially considering Stefano's on his way back
@johnwalterseip Interesting although I more inclined to think everyone thinks the baby died and Kristen took the baby for her and Brady.
@excuseyou77 @NYCG8TR @BrandonSufronko Will at his best when working for EJ in terms of strength. Needs that personality deal with Gabi/Nick
@theLandofKoz @JudiEvans @freddiemsmith @laurenkoslow Just so long as Adrienne doesn't do anything to stop or slow WilSon.
@BrandonSufronko Amen - WilSon FOREVER
@BrandonSufronko Chan is the best actor on daytime right now and deserves another Emmy
@BrandonSufronko So true.  NBC's come close cancelling Days.  Show is really good if you complain and don't watch it will be cancelled :(
@BrandonSufronko I complain but I still watch DOOL because I am always shocked or surprised at what's going on.
@ShorteeMichelle @GaysOfDays @SonnyKiriakis Is Will on too?
@BrandonSufronko He's been through much in his young life then he  became sure about his being gay and first real serious relationship
@BrandonSufronko @tbayles Okay because I LOVE CHAN
@ShorteeMichelle I think he performed on Idol and he voice has definitely gone downhill with the years
@BrandonSufronko @OhMyMassey Once you figure it out let me know Brandon
@ShorteeMichelle We finally agree on something.  Results shows that could be done in 15 minutes take 2 hours - did cry at last night opening
@tbayles @BrandonSufronko Tonya, I don't think I was criticizing Will
@BrandonSufronko As I said Will can do no wrong in my book.
@ShorteeMichelle @BrandonSufronko @GaysOfDays @tbayles @ilovetoflail Okay - I don't want cheating at all.
@tbayles @BrandonSufronko I would not use the word torn but you are correct in that he is struggling
@tbayles @BrandonSufronko Agreed
@ShorteeMichelle @BrandonSufronko @GaysOfDays @tbayles @ilovetoflail No more cheating between Will and Sonny, and please no T
@BrandonSufronko I agree - some are more partial to Freddie, I am a Will/Chan devotee and he can do no wrong in my book
@Wilson94Mimi @BrandonSufronko @Joanie_Vinson @tbayles He Won't
@Wilson94Mimi @BrandonSufronko @Joanie_Vinson @tbayles What?
@JoshMorrow Shouldn't be more guns there need to be less guns
@BrandonSufronko @ShorteeMichelle Who are you talking about?
@BrandonSufronko I love Helena - I can't stand Jerry.
@BrandonSufronko Are you freakin kidding me.  Not Helena
@NancyLeeGrahn I SOOO Agree with you Nancy.  It is scary!!!!!
@BrandonSufronko I'm beginning to this she is.
@BrandonSufronko Chandler #4 No way.  Chan should be #1
@BrandonSufronko Don't get your hopes up!!!!!
@MichaelFairman Believe it when it is an actual reality until then remain skeptical.
@ShorteeMichelle Been argued the Nielsen is not a real barometer because of DVRs, VCRs, twitter and YouTube and Nielsen fighting extinction
@ShorteeMichelle Have faith in Days Michelle!
@ShorteeMichelle @ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith @nbcdays I so agree. Stop this baby drama, have Will be honest with Sonny and more WilSon
@ShorteeMichelle @GaysOfDays Sorry I just don't see it.  Will in the baby story is clearly the main focus in that storyline.
@GaysOfDays @ShorteeMichelle Gabi is not becoming the focus of the show but I will admit Gabi is annoying
@BrandonSufronko Find one of the pictures without his shirt on!
@SusenMc @BrandonSufronko @ChandlerMassey More Smiles Chan, Please!!!!
@ShorteeMichelle @fsmithfans @freddiemsmith @FreddieSmithFan So agree - Big Thank you
@BrandonSufronko Will need to tell Sonny or Sonny need to figure it out and confront him because Chan's sad eyes are getting to be too much!
@BrandonSufronko Agreed!
@BrandonSufronko As long as there is no breakup of Sonny and Will, he can get at angry as he wants.
@BrandonSufronko What is HTS?
@BrandonSufronko @Ali_Sweeney @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey How about scenes with Sami, Sonny and Will together.
@BrandonSufronko Huh?
@BrandonSufronko Baby Reveal?  There better not be a breakup!
@BrandonSufronko Baby reveal before New Years?
@BrandonSufronko This is from last year, right?
@BlakeBerris @KateMansi @camilabanus @freddiemsmith @NOH8Campaign Was Chan studying for exams?
@freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey @BlakeBerris @camilabanus You all doing great jobs in the story - I just hope WilSon and Nabi stay together.
@WillHortonDAYS @BrandonSufronko You are lucky Brandon
@Wilson94Mimi @ShorteeMichelle @GaysOfDays @NYCG8TR @kieronandpj I see no breakup but I do see fight and discussion of serious trust issues
@GaysOfDays @Wilson94Mimi @tbayles @ShorteeMichelle @NYCG8TR I like Cameron idea it would give him a story, but I love to see Will cry too
@Wilson94Mimi @ShorteeMichelle @GaysOfDays @NYCG8TR @kieronandpj Because Will has not told Sonny he is the father
@Wilson94Mimi @GaysOfDays @NYCG8TR @kieronandpj @ShorteeMichelle Will most definitely will turn on Gabi.
@ShorteeMichelle @GaysOfDays @NYCG8TR @kieronandpj crossing my fingers no - but should be good drama regardless.
@Wilson94Mimi @ShorteeMichelle @NYCG8TR @GaysOfDays That's my fear Mimi - the not part but it will be interesting.
@Wilson94Mimi @ShorteeMichelle @NYCG8TR @GaysOfDays NO!!! Let Will and Sonny be happy!
@GaysOfDays Sonny born after parents left town so age around 20 in real life but birth year not said on show in recent years so who knows,
@ShorteeMichelle Too hard to watch - I switched the channel.
@OutAlive1985 @GaysOfDays I say closer to 25.
@Wilson94Mimi @BrandonSufronko Thanks for sharing all the pictures Brandon, I will be having sweet dreams of Chandler/Will
@ShorteeMichelle I'm balling during the service.  So Sad and I am not even a huge Obama fan.
@BrandonSufronko More images for my dreams.  I should save them all to my computer :)
@BrandonSufronko I will be dreaming about Will and Sonny and Chandler and Freddie tonight.
@BrandonSufronko I am so in love with Will and Chandler!
@BrandonSufronko I'm in love
@BrandonSufronko Loving them Brandon!
@BrandonSufronko One of my favorites
@BrandonSufronko Fabulous
@BrandonSufronko Sweet
@BrandonSufronko Makes me want to swoon.
@BrandonSufronko Great picture
@BrandonSufronko Love
@ShorteeMichelle @SonnyKiriakis Sorry the way he has been treating Will last few episodes is in my opinion being a bully.
@ShorteeMichelle @NYChopeful Agreed
@ShorteeMichelle What movie?
@ShorteeMichelle @nbcdays It is a big double standard.  You are absolutely correct, Michelle.
@ShorteeMichelle @nbcdays I hope once the baby paternity is revealed there will be more.
@SonnyKiriakis Chad, Nick and Gabi all bullies in different ways. The way they are all treating Will is clearly different forms of bullying.
@MMFlint I have never been your biggest fan Mr. Moore but you are so correct and I couldn't agree with you more and I am a Republican.
@michaelmuhney Ain't that the truth!
@ShorteeMichelle @CaseyDeidrick @ChandlerMassey Definite fun was had by all.
@MichaelFairman I hoping Sonny learns Will is the father and they recommit because this DOOL baby storyline is one of worst in DOOL history.
@ShorteeMichelle Ain't that the truth.  I have never been a huge Martin Short fan either.
@freddiemsmith I think about yesterday's events in CT-nice there are excellent role models on TV like you  -I hope you never leave Days.
@ChandlerMassey I think about yesterday's events in CT-nice there are excellent role models on TV like you  -I hope you never leave Days.
@theLandofKoz Amen to all your posts of remembrances for all the sweet children and the people at the school who died in the tragedy in CT.
@theLandofKoz AMEN
@theLandofKoz Amen
@SusanBanksFan it airs Monday in the US
@johnwalterseip @CaseyDeidrick @Cocowhat @AllyEmpey Hysterical
@johnwalterseip @freddiemsmith Freddie, you are loved by the fans who love Sonny, Will and WilSon
@freddiemsmith Storyline and character important an inspiration and you deserve all the kind thoughts.  Hope no breakup and WilSon FOREVER.
@GaysOfDays @nbcdays Goes without saying.  No breakup an WilSon forever!!
@NancyLeeGrahn Totally admire and respect your candidness and your opinion.
@billmaher Bill you usually right but the parents of the country also need to comfort the children.  And we need time as a nation to heal.
@EBraeden I Republican father of young child and today's tragedy like others scared me with my son not safe in school to inadequate gun laws
@ShorteeMichelle Oh - you'll have to tell me all about it
@ShorteeMichelle I think NBC should be daring
@ShorteeMichelle I would love that
@ShorteeMichelle In a way I hope so in a way I hope not.  I think they need to go as far as possible to show he is a homophobe.
@ShorteeMichelle Dec 28th of Days? I know they are airing a new episode on NYD that wasn't originally planned.
@ShorteeMichelle Won't be a month, maybe a couple of weeks.  but we'll see which of us is right in a few weeks
@JonathanWeinma2 @ShorteeMichelle Sonny and Will will talk about the trust issues, break up for maybe an episode or two and reunite.
@ShorteeMichelle That's what I think Sonny is starting to figure out, Will father, sex with Gabi mistake, and it will blow up at the wedding
@ShorteeMichelle btw -Sonny will do the math figure it all out punch Nickt at the wedding and then have long talk with Will about trust
@ShorteeMichelle It might be it will also be on SN on Monday as NBC will not release a new episode until Tuesday.  Let me know what happens.
@ShorteeMichelle Did you watch Today's episode?
@ShorteeMichelle Let me know what happens on Days if it is on SoapNet as I no longer get that.  Regardless I will watch Monday
@NancyLeeGrahn As I recall not today was what was used after Columbine and look how many of these stories happened since.
@ShorteeMichelle I was really ticked off at a couple of people in the various Days groups that complained about the news interrupted Days
@ShorteeMichelle Okay - just wanted to make sure love Days but often disagree so make sure didn't insult.  No problem missing Days today.
@ShorteeMichelle I hope never implied that you harsh or b***** when talking about Days on facebook.
@ShorteeMichelle I have been crying all day over this story
@cmasseyfans @ChandlerMassey Lovely quote Eric had about you
@ShorteeMichelle Same here mIchelle
@ChandlerMassey I am gay and exactly like Will with same upbringing when younger.  Wish I had role model like Will when I was coming out.
@EBraeden Couldn't agree with you more Mr. Braeden
@ShorteeMichelle On facebook don't always agree but couldn't agree with you more on this one.  Just heartbreaking.
@johnwalterseip if preempted in the majority of country because of this tragedy then they would air what was supposed to air today on Monday
@1997jaden I hope they will talk through their trust issues and then make up
@1997jaden Yeah tell me about it
@1997jaden Maybe he realized that Will needed some time
@1997jaden Good luck with exams
@1997jaden @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey Totally agree Chan and Freddie are the best actors ever!!
@johnwalterseip @freddiemsmith @ChandlerMassey @BlakeBerris @camilabanus The drawing really made me chuckle.
@GaysOfDays I hope that there is no breakup for any length of time.  WilSon forever.
@ChandlerMassey @freddiemsmith Hope the fight in tomorrow's episode isn't sign of breakup.Want conflict but no breakup.WilSon too important.
@cmasseyfans I hope there is no breakup of any kind on the horizon,
@fsmithfans I hope there is no breakup of any kind on the horizon,
@GaysOfDays I pray that they are not doing a breakup.  I think the drama is just as good with a fight and tension rather than breakup
@GaysOfDays When and why?
@nbcdays It will be inexcusable if Days breaks up Will and Sonny for even the shortest period of time.  This relationship is too important
@ChandlerMassey Hope you have a nice holiday season and will be on Days for many years to come. I watch because of you.
@ChandlerMassey I'd add was exactly like Will when about 20 and wish there had been a story on soaps then that was real like WilSon.
@ChandlerMassey You deserve all the good feedback.  The story and how you have portrayed it has impacted a lot of people.
@1997jaden Me too, but have a feeling we will both be unhappy in that regard for the next few episodes.
@1997jaden I just hope that once the whole baby thing comes out that she does not try and break them up with her sanctimonious attitude.
@1997jaden And maybe the whole baby thing comes out and Nick tries to go after Will and Sonny beats him up instead.
@1997jaden Yeah they both have tempers.  I hope Sonny beats Nick to a pulp for what Nick is doing to Will.
@1997jaden They are clearly not perfect - juut hope their conflict is them fighting through this baby stuff together rather than breakup
@1997jaden While Will has made a couple of bad decisions, Will should be unscathed because Nick and Gabi are the real "villains"
@1997jaden Instead of Sonny and Will being angry they need to sit down and talk sooner rather than later.
@1997jaden WilSon all the way.
@1997jaden Couldn't agree with you more.  WilSon belong together and this baby story is silly.
@1997jaden So with you on this comment
@johnwalterseip Couldn't agree with you more!
@johnwalterseip Great Idea
@BrandonSufronko I don't either but we just have to be patient.  Will and Sonny will be happy again soon.
@ChandlerMassey Good luck on your UCLA exams this term
@ChandlerMassey Good luck on your UCLA exams
@OhMyMassey Hope Chandler does well on his UCLA exams.
@DaysCafe Love the picture, it is priceless.  How do you get this stuff a day in advance.
@ChandlerMassey You and the Sonny and Will relationship is the reason I watch Days.  I hope the baby thing doesn't break them up.
@DaysCafe Agree with Will on not wanting to be juggled between two homes but if Nick and Gabi keep the baby Sonny still needs to know.
@DaysCafe Nick is such a homophobe.  I hate him and wish they had never brought him back.
@freddiemsmith This Gabi baby story isn't going to break WilSon up is it? They should deal with the situation together and not cheat
@freddiemsmith This Gabi baby story isn't going to break WilSon up is it? They should deal with the situation together and not cheat.
@freddiemsmith Will these other guys play a part in a potential breakup in this whole baby mess?
@ChandlerMassey @freddiesmith It was a great episode I hope that there is no sign of them breaking up-they shoudl be couple forever.
@MichaelFairman Will and Sonny and hope this Gabi pregnancy brings them closer rather than breaking them up.
