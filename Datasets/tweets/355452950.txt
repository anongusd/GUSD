@RetiredTanker @jeepchick2018 @bennyjohnson Yeah because Republicans are doing anything at all to solve that problem.  At least they‚Äôd be paying taxes as opposed to the status quo.  If I‚Äôm not mistaken there was a significant fine before citizenship was considered.

@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 Great.  I honestly don‚Äôt care either way.  Whatever makes him happy.  That said, that woman never said a thing about his sexuality.  You may have preconceived notions but you can‚Äôt project that onto the words that were said.
@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 Lol.  Implied because you think he‚Äôs gay and that is why he‚Äôs compromised?  Show me the words.
@LaurenN36341359 Just because some guy lies to you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true.  Did you watch the video posted?
@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 Please let me know the words she said that made you think that.
@secupp Please type the words she said that made you think that he was having sex with men.
@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 Please type the words she said that made you think that he was having sex with men.
@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 So a guy incorrectly says that the woman insinuates he‚Äôs gay when she clearly gives three other possibilities and its the other side that is deceitful.  I‚Äôm impressed by that leap of logic.
@LaurenN36341359 Show me where she said anything about his sexuality.  She goes on to list three other reasons in the video and homosexuality is not one of them.
@LaurenN36341359 @BuckSexton @LindseyGrahamSC Start seeking out better sources.
@LaurenN36341359 @BuckSexton @LindseyGrahamSC Nothing was ever said about his sexuality?
@bals2thewall @BuckSexton Or because nothing was ever said about his sexuality?
@LaurenN36341359 @BuckSexton @LindseyGrahamSC About what exactly?
@BuckSexton Because nothing about his sexuality was said?
@JoieQ101 @BuckSexton She never said anything about his sexuality.  Just more right wing propaganda.
@AmericaRising17 @BuckSexton @EvOConnor15 She never said anything about his sexuality.  Just more right wing propaganda.

@DeanLogic @dirtyfiends @DRUDGE_REPORT Well that‚Äôs why there was I think 50 billion in border security money.  I agree that amnesty doesn‚Äôt fix the issue.  That is why you make it a path to citizenship with a healthy fine and you send criminals home. They are here, might as well get tax dollars from them.
@DeanLogic @dirtyfiends @DRUDGE_REPORT If you look through my replies to people you‚Äôll see that.
@DeanLogic @dirtyfiends @DRUDGE_REPORT The Democrats 10 years ago were trying to comprehensively solve the immigration issue.  The only way they could get gop to support was to appropriate huge sums to protect the border in exchange they received a path to citizenship for millions.  I‚Äôm all for passing that bill.
@DeanLogic @dirtyfiends @DRUDGE_REPORT Ehh.  They passed what they‚Äôre going to pass and they‚Äôre probably sick of the GOP holding the country hostage by threatening government shutdowns.  How many have we had or threatened by the GOP in the last ten years?  It‚Äôs no way to govern.
@politico That‚Äôs not what he said.  Delete your account.

Hell I think more investigations of government officials is good.
@justinr10519174 @roxsupfan @JazzShaw @seanmdav Did he break the law?  If Hillary is guilty of something Trumps Justice department should investigate her and indict her.  Until that happens she is innocent.  I ask again if Trump is compromised is the witch hunt good for the US?  It‚Äôs a yes or no question.
@justinr10519174 @roxsupfan @JazzShaw @seanmdav Manafort was found guilty by trial and pled guilty.  Where I come from that makes him guilty of the crimes he was charged with.  I‚Äôll ask you the same question, If Trump is found to be compromised by Russia is the ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù good for the US?
@roxsupfan @JazzShaw @seanmdav If it is determined Trump is compromised by Russia is the ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù what is best for the USA?

@DeanNoelMullen Honestly get rid of the games vs Citadel and Tuskeegee State if they‚Äôre worried about safety.
@SalGrano @Ceddybear417 @incarceratedbob @ToddFuhrman @NDFootball OSU lost to Purdue and needed overtime to beat MD.
@TheFlyingEagle7 @danWorthington @howaboutafresca That lost to Temple that lost to UCF.  Oh yeah that Maryland team also beat Texas that beat OU.
@danWorthington @howaboutafresca Or we just put in the four undefeated teams?  One of which that hasn‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.
@BTSherwood If only there was a fourth undefeated team we could put in?
@scottymeyer70 @AndrewDoak_WWL @CFBPlayoff If they don‚Äôt make it I‚Äôd watch that matchup.  Honestly UCF is the only other bowl game I care about at this point other than the playoffs.  Well my Green Wave I‚Äôll watch too.

What does it really hurt to give these kids their shot?  25 games without an L. Maybe they get blown out like OSU did last year 31-0. Or not?
@AllbrightNFL Those kids have beaten everyone on their schedule since the Obama administration.  They deserve their shot.
@Gay4Baker @AllbrightNFL They haven‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.  Those kids deserve their shot.

@scottshanle @notthefakeSVP Obama was president the last time UCF lost.  They beat the last team to beat Bama a month after they won.  The kids deserve their  shot.
@AP_Top25 @CFBPlayoff UCF hasn‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.
@BTSherwood @Chops971 Even without it expanded.  There are four undefeated teams and four spots.  If OU beat Texas then sure.  If OSU beat Purdue then sure.  But they didn‚Äôt and UCF has won 25 straight.  Gotta give them the opportunity.
@PatrickASchmidt @DeanNoelMullen Any of them undefeated since the Obama administration?  UCF is.
@AndrewDoak_WWL @CFBPlayoff The kids don‚Äôt make the schedule.  They deserve their shot.
@soadqeuloln @ESPNCFB @drpepper True.  Look I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll beat Bama.  I just think they deserve their shot.
@BrandonBibb_DBD @Jake_Trotter Which neither OU or OSU can say.
@BrandonBibb_DBD @Jake_Trotter They beat the last team to beat Bama a month after they beat Bama.  Other than that they beat everyone on their schedule.
@soadqeuloln @ESPNCFB @drpepper I‚Äôm a Bama fan.  Kids have gone through two division I schedules undefeated.  They deserve their shot.  As for almost losing hell Bama struggled against Citadel.
@BrandonBibb_DBD @Jake_Trotter UCF hasn‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.
@soadqeuloln @ESPNCFB @drpepper Those kids played everyone in front of them for two years and haven‚Äôt lost.  If there were 4 undefeated teams with better schedules fine.  There aren‚Äôt.  OU lost to Texas who lost to MD who got destroyed by Temple who got beat by UCF.  The kids deserve their shot.

@kirbaez @ESPNCFB @drpepper The last time UCF lost Obama was president.  They beat the last team to beat Bama a month after they beat them.
@soadqeuloln @ESPNCFB @drpepper Last team to beat Bama lost to them a month later.  That and the other 24 teams they‚Äôve played.
@TJSutton04 @MaesterGooner @TheCousinSal The kids deserve a shot.  Hell Ohio State lost to Clemson 31-0 last year.  If they get blown out....  Awesome.  To deny them a shot is ridiculous.
@TJSutton04 @MaesterGooner @TheCousinSal As well as 24 of the other teams they‚Äôve played since they lost.
@TJSutton04 @MaesterGooner @TheCousinSal Ok well they beat Pitt by the same amount Clemson did tonight.
@SInow @ScoobAxson You know who else rolled Pitt?  UCF.
@MaesterGooner @TheCousinSal Oklahoma lost to Texas who lost to Maryland who Temple destroyed who you guessed it lost to UCF.
@MaesterGooner @TheCousinSal They beat the last team to beat Bama a month after they beat Bama.
@TheCousinSal UCF hasn‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.
@CptSwollhouse @GabeIkard Too bad I‚Äôm not a UCF fan.  Just someone with a sense of fairness.  You go undefeated two years in a row and don‚Äôt get your shot?  I could see if there were 4 other undefeated teams.  But there‚Äôs not.  Oklahoma lost to Texas who lost to MD who got crushed by Temple who UCF beat.
@CptSwollhouse @GabeIkard Yeah but one of those 10 year olds beat the heavyweight champion of the world a month before you whipped him.
@dpbrugler @TarheelCowboy Maybe.  We don‚Äôt know.  They‚Äôve beaten Pitt, Auburn and Maryland during the last two years.  Auburn last year was the last team to beat Bama.  How many games do they have to win before getting their shot?
@BryanDFischer 25 straight games.  Obama was president the last time those kids from Florida lost.
@dpbrugler @TarheelCowboy Yeah they‚Äôve only beat everyone put in front of them for 2 years.  Those kids do.  Before you say they haven‚Äôt played anyone.  They beat the last team to beat Bama and hell they didn‚Äôt lose to Purdue or Texas.  Oklahoma has lost to Houston since the last time these kids lost.
@JeritRoser There are 4 undefeated teams.  Not sure why this is complicated.
@dpbrugler @TarheelCowboy Texas lost to Maryland who got destroyed by Temple who lost to you guessed it the only team undefeated since the Obama administration.  UCF deserves their shot.

@strokjl @StopBuntingPlz @heathcummingssr And these cats did it twice.  They deserve their shot.

@StopBuntingPlz @DFS_Almanac @heathcummingssr As a Bama fan I agree.  The kids deserve their shot though.  25 straight games.  If it happened to any historical power there would be outrage.
@AndrewDoak_WWL @CFBPlayoff Beat the last team to beat Bama in their bowl game last year.  25 straight victories.  The kids deserve their shot.  Clemson beat Ohio State 31-0 last year.  If it happens to UCF so be it.
@tah78 @ShannonSharpe UCF.  25 straight and they beat the last team that beat Bama.
@LauraMRutledge @FootballUGA There are 4 undefeated teams.  UCF hasn‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.  They deserve their shot.  They beat the last team to beat Bama.
@StopBuntingPlz @DFS_Almanac @heathcummingssr Did you do that when they beat Auburn last year in their bowl game?
@ThadSr16 @TimBrando @UCFFootball They haven‚Äôt lost since the Obama administration.  Let them have their shot.  Hell OH State lost to Clemson 31-0 in the playoffs last year.  If they get blown out ao be it.
@StopBuntingPlz @heathcummingssr Ohio State lost to Purdue and Oklahoma lost to Texas.  UCF hasn‚Äôt lost to anybody.  Since UCF last lost a game Oklahoma lost to Houston.  We watched Clemson beat Ohio State 31-0 last year in the playoffs.  UCF deserves their shot.  If they get blown out so be it.
@StopBuntingPlz @heathcummingssr Haven‚Äôt lost in two years with a victory over the team that was the last team to beat Bama during that time.  They deserve a shot.
@heathcummingssr 25 straight wins.  If they don‚Äôt get their shot it‚Äôs a tragedy of justice.

@Gdawgs755 @LeBronsHairli11 @danieljont @pcrumby80 @MichaelWBratton Would they get a shot after winning 25 straight?  Hell I watched Bama struggle versus Citadel this year.

@Chops971 @BTSherwood UCF hasn‚Äôt lost since Obama was president.  Those kids deserve a shot.
@LeBronsHairli11 @danieljont @pcrumby80 @MichaelWBratton Hell Maryland beat Texas this year.  Which was just a huge win for Oklahoma.  Give those kids a shot.
@LeBronsHairli11 @danieljont @pcrumby80 @MichaelWBratton Temple destroyed Maryland this year.  Like 35-14.  Maryland took Ohio State to OT 52-51.
@danieljont @pcrumby80 @MichaelWBratton Hell Memphis beat a Josh Rosen led UCLA team last year.  The kids deserve a shot.  It‚Äôs a tragedy of justice if they don‚Äôt get it.

@TheKostos There‚Äôs a team that hasn‚Äôt lost during the Trump administration.  25 straight wins.  They beat the only team to beat Bama last year.  UCF should be in.
@MichaelWBratton The 4 undefeated teams should be in.  One of which hasn‚Äôt lost in two years and beat the only team that beat Bama last year.  UCF is getting hosed.  25 straight wins.
@Crimealytics Right?  Hell UCF hasn‚Äôt lost in two years.  While I think Bama destroys them they deserve their shot.  1. Bama 2. Clemson 3. ND 4. UCF. I‚Äôm almost sure OK and Ohio State are better but hell 25 straight gotta be worth something.
@PeteSampson_ Maybe I‚Äôm just old fashioned but I say let UCF in.  Hell going undefeated 2 years in a row should be worth something.

@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll I could care less about Cohn.  The GOP lost the country by 9 points in house races but Rasmussen says that 50% approves of him.  They should be ashamed of themselves for what they are doing.
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll The bogus part is putting in the average of unpopular Presidents as opposed to the average of all.  The inaccurate is Democrats aren‚Äôt projected to pick up nearly that many.
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll I hope you‚Äôre more thorough when dealing with peoples money.  Not only is this a bogus argument to make it is inaccurate.
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll ‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs party loses 37 seats in the House on average in midterm elections when his approval is below 50 percent ‚Äî but Democrats aren‚Äôt projected to pick up nearly that many seats.‚Äù
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll Were there Senate races across all 50 states?  Did I miss that?  Everybody from sea to shining sea got to vote for the house and Trump lost by 9.  Any other view of that election is disingenuous.
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll It is inappropriate and misleading to continue to put out inaccurate numbers.  The country overwhelmingly voted for D house candidates.
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll ‚ÄúWas our R+1 net final generic ballot score (with a +/- 2 margin of error) reasonable? We believe it was, but we‚Äôll look at all the data in the coming weeks to see if any adjustments to our national likely voters party weighting is appropriate.‚Äù
@mediainvestors @Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll Well they figured the midterms about 9% points off?
@Politics_Polls @Rasmussen_Poll If they were a legitimate polling operation they would stop putting out polls until they figured out what was wrong.  The fact they are trudging forward tells me all I need to know.

@rsteade @thehill Somebody needs to figure it out.  It would be nice if we had a level-headed President that we all trusted to be honest but he can‚Äôt figure out if he knows his AG appointment that supposed to keep him out of jail.
@rsteade @thehill I agree.  The Secretary of State in GA should be on top of it right?  Well he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs already the governor and quit before all the votes have been counted.
@aelder521 @ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Nobody cares about who the election supervisor is.  Seems ridiculous that it‚Äôs an elected position to me.
@rsteade @thehill I‚Äôm pretty sure that they are talking about provisional ballots from the 1.4 million voters that were purged from the election rolls.  It amazes me that GOP can purge these people then get mad when it takes longer to count their votes. https://t.co/zF2PHAfKYx

@aelder521 @ToadonaWire @jamiedupree So if she broke the law why wasn‚Äôt she charged by the GOP governor and AG?  If she hadn‚Äôt been appointed by Jeb then she might not have kept the job.

@MAGA_Guard @SeanMar23084961 @boyetter2013 @RealSaavedra @DailySignal So Jeb! could do it but Scott couldn‚Äôt?  Maybe they investigated and she wasn‚Äôt found at fault?  Maybe Scott was incompetent?  Maybe it‚Äôs all just overblown bs to get you up in arms that elections are being stolen?

@ToadonaWire @ManDisheveled @jamiedupree I must‚Äôve caught a nerve.  You don‚Äôt think these people that spent the time to choose their leaders should be allowed to have their say because the government invalidated their ballots. That my friend is what the Russians do. Americans count the votes.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree I have no idea what SOE is but I‚Äôm sure votes are being verified lawfully.  As for public in the canvassing room I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs monitors of some sort.  I‚Äôm not sure what the deal is with the public record but hey this woman was appointed by Jeb! so blame him.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Was there a court that approved them?  Yes.  Do you want the government to make a mistake and lose your vote?  No.  Let‚Äôs say all of Texas votes were invalidated and Hillary was president.  Would that be ok?
@ManDisheveled @ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Scott sent investigators and they found nothing.  The courts looked at it and counted the votes.  Due process.  Trying to get votes thrown out because the government made a mistake is a slippery slope.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Real Americans want other Americans votes counted.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Snipes was appointed by Jeb!  Blame him.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree You want people‚Äôs votes thrown out because the government made a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù.  Move to Russia.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Sounds like a common sense approach to counting actual Americans votes when a mistake was made by the government run by a GOP governor is going to figure out how to count those American votes.  It‚Äôs great to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
@KeithxBurnette @anneursu Today the Presidents appointing of a veteran swindling, unqualified lackey to influence the investigation into his Russian mafia ties is probably more important.
@KeithxBurnette @anneursu It was the biggest story of the day you read it right?
@RealSaavedra Wasn‚Äôt there a GOP Florida attorney general and wasn‚Äôt Scott the governor through all of this?  Why wouldn‚Äôt they press charges?  The lady was originally appointed by Jeb! It sounds to me like any issues are the fault of the GOP.
@MAGA_Guard @SeanMar23084961 @boyetter2013 @RealSaavedra @DailySignal Who‚Äôs your election supervisor?  I voted for a commissioner of agriculture and a commissioner of insurance.  No clue who those people were.  Thay were on the ballot.  She was on the ballot because years ago Jeb! put her there.  His fault IMO.
@ToadonaWire @jamiedupree Sounds like Broward is going to count legal Americans votes even though a mistake was made.  Sounds like Democracy and a common sense court coming together to Make America Great Again.

Hospitals pay .50 for a pillow and charge you $20.  Ever walked into a Dr. office and see all the ladies in the back?  They spend their day arguing with insurance companies.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Yes but in 2015 there were almost twice as many.  The Ferguson shooting kind‚Äôve started this thing and Kap‚Äôs protest in August of 2016 also publicized the issue.  Maybe that has made 20 police officers decide to hold off.  No way to prove it one way or the other.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Well with the limited amount of data proof will be impossible however since the protests started 2 years ago shootings of unarmed black men have dropped substantially.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric If I told you that kneeling during the National Anthem would save 20 people would you do it?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric In 2015 police killed 36 unarmed black males.  That number has dropped to 17 in 2016 and 19 in 2017.  Is it possible that these protests by African Americans have had an effect?  With videos being taken and more publicity on this issue has it saved 20 black mens lives a year?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric If 7% of the population commits 50% of the violent crimes in this country do you think its a logical argument that if you‚Äôre riding with three gentlemen of that 7% that a police officer might look at that car more thoroughly than if it was 4 white guys?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Just 40 years of life experience.  I‚Äôm sure I could point you to incarceration rates and other statistics but if you‚Äôre not going to be honest would it really matter? We‚Äôre both white dudes from the South and some things just are the way they are.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric I‚Äôll ask you again.  If you‚Äôre pulled over one hot Mississippi night do you think your odds are better going home with three 35 year old white dudes in the car or three 35 year old African Americans in the car?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Has the majority of a group ever been wrong?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric I‚Äôm pretty sure I never said Kap loves America.Words matter my friend.I believe they should be able to protest and if you ignore it it will go away. I‚Äôd also ask you if you‚Äôre pulled over at 2 AM do you believe your chances are better if there are three white or black dudes w ya?
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric You get to speak for millions of ‚Äúpatriotic Americans‚Äù but I‚Äôm not allowed to bring up my history of service and how it relates to this issue? I just hope you leave this conversation with the knowledge that people can love this country and not agree with you.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Well just the fact I posted this an hour ago.  Oh and I never said I was speaking for anyone else.  Just me. https://t.co/U5j856B9WX
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric You‚Äôd have to show me the quote where a player complained the fans were mad. As for not being proud of the flag, It‚Äôs a piece of cloth. It is what it represents that is important. One of the great thing in my eyes about Merica is to have an open dialogue about issues.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric I would also like to add as a veteran, I am not offended and consider myself a patriotic American.  If I would‚Äôve died on a foreign battlefield it would‚Äôve been so that those gentleman could do whatever the hell they want when the anthem is played.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Who‚Äôs complaining?Trump and the right.  The players are just quietly taking a knee.They might complain when their doing so results in suspensions but that will just make it a bigger story.Trump is effectively doing their work for them.

@kizmet1116 @loisbeckett @brianstelter Did I say it wasn‚Äôt?  I myself am not qualified enough to determine the finer points of journalistic ethics.  I don‚Äôt have to look into the finer points to see it from Fox and talk radio on the right.  It is blatantly propaganda.
@NickGertz3 @KristianGaric Yup.  And it‚Äôs working.  If you‚Äôre an activist and can get the president to talk about your issue everyday.  You have won my friend.
@AP_Politics Guess they figured, might as well have a war while we control their Commander in Chief.
@kizmet1116 @loisbeckett @brianstelter I didn‚Äôt say I agreed with the lady but to call the left propaganda at this point is disingenuous as hell when actual propaganda is being fed by the most watched news service every night.

@DRUDGE_REPORT Remember all of the times during the first year of the Obama presidency when Republicans made fun of Democrats for blaming everything on Bush? We‚Äôre now 2 years into Trump‚Äôs presidency and this guy is now blaming his treason on Obama.
@RonaldRgz_ @PJalihal @darrenrovell Playoff extra innings is awesome.  On a random Tuesday night, just get that mess over.
@PJalihal @darrenrovell I think you spelled mens wrong.  I‚Äôve got no interest in watching a tennis match with 99 games.  It‚Äôs like watching a 16 inning baseball game.
@Tristan1369 @AP All told, eight years of Obama family travel cost taxpayers $97 million, according to the conservative Judicial Watch. Following his first months in office, it looked as if Trump could cost America $100-200 million more in four years. Unbelievable, indeed. https://t.co/FxKNtoIKNK

@Dinkeldash @Brighttail @brithume @FBI Well sounds like they need to get the FBI head who if I‚Äôm not mistaken was appointed by Trump to answer those questions if he told this guy not to answer. Honestly I personally trust the FBI more than any politician on either side of the aisle.  Politicians are pretty sleezy.

How is Congress to know if a sitting president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors if he cannot be investigated, indicted or tried?

@JamesRHarrisSr @Texicanuck778 @Shakespeare527 @BuckSexton I would say that it is very possible that the power of the presidential pardon may come before the SCOTUS as well as procedural arguments.

@WalshFreedom Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist.[10] She has said: "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I‚Äôve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I‚Äôve just gotten a lot closer just because He‚Äôs the only one I can lean on."

@mudpuppy001 @ryanstruyk When the gap between the parties positions are so vast does the slant of commentators really matter?

@BRIANASJ @DaBearsk35 @KatiePavlich Remember Trump said Comey was fired over ‚Äúthis Russia thing‚Äù. If it‚Äôs Clinton doing the same firing you support it? You would support Eric Holder in charge of investigating a Russian conspiracy to get her elected? I can see it now Josie, you holding your Holder for FBI sign.
@DaBearsk35 @KatiePavlich The firing of the guy writing the memos triggered a special counsel.  In a democracy you can‚Äôt just fire someone who is leading an investigation into your affairs. Imagine if Clinton elected and then fired Comey.  Can you honestly say you‚Äôd support that move?

@john_siglerrr Oh yeah lets question the Patriots coaching staff with 5 rings and ours are infallible?
@SaintsForecast I know the Patriots benched a player we considered trading the farm for last offseason.  Why can't we evaluate CB talent?
@SaintsForecast Hell they thought Crawley was 5th or 6th best CB.  Didn't even dress.  Why?  What were they missing? Hopefully they're asking themselves.
@SaintsForecast Yeah they played Harris two games after watching them both in preseason for 2 months.  Why couldn't they figure it out? Anybody could watch Lattimore and know if he was healthy he'd be great.
@SaintsForecast How many TD's did Harris give up vs. the Vikings to start the season?  What were they looking at in practice that made them think he was better than Crawley? Why did they draft Baptiste? Brandon Browner. Hopefully they got it fixed before they break the bank.
@ald7431 @tribelaw If there was a baby there'd be a lot more money involved.  I don't think they do paternity tests after abortions but I'm not sure.
