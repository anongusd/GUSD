@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump But the whole reason trump is making this speech is political. Hypocrite.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You mean the fact that the president and his cronies ignore his administration‚Äôs facts that were reported to Congress that it‚Äôs 6 and not 4000?  We shouldn‚Äôt ignore the lying. You‚Äôre right Ronna!  Agreed!
