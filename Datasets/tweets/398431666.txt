@WalshFreedom I personally as someone not being paid to be political pundit (as most are doing) can not see all the outrage at 14 y.o.’s are targeted by a so called Adult! Aren’t adults supposed to set examples? He intended to walk in the middle of school kids to cause a reaction.
@jaketapper @SethAbramson I have always been a @KirstenPowers  fan, but her remarks are unforgivable and seem libel. It’s sad that a person will spin and demonize 14 year olds just for a paycheck from the DNC. 	#StandWithCovington

@amb573 @samstein Sorry you are so offended by my English .....	Can you show me “Trumpenstein” in the dictionary?? 😂		And as far as Trump being in charge of disaster relief- He has people in departments to handle...obviously shows you don’t have a clue about owning a business
@samstein Yeah......I was Greatly offended today when I seen UF traveled to Nashville to play football with all the devastation...		What a stupid comment

@ChrisCuomo WoW! What a concept 		“Don’t get to decide when a Black Am is racist on Black Am”....		But everyone gets to decide and have a decision on Caucasian on minorities..		So much for Equality Everyone smh
@jaketapper @kaitlancollins Disturbing....
@JessicaTarlov @atrupar I like @JessicaTarlov, I could see having a heated debate with her....		Respect her greatly tho

@ChrisCuomo Why even bring it up?? Seems like a hit to delegitimize a person......Did you dig into this woman’s “mental stability” after she interviewed President Obama??! https://t.co/FUzgFQqbxJ
@Acosta Finally!! Now that’s journalism Jimmy!
@KennedyNation OMG....lol priceless
@jaymesyng Stood 8 years of being comforted by elegant speech and “table manners”....		Obviously you don’t Work for a living if that’s all you are looking for in a leader...smh
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @ninaturner To put this obviously angry lady on a nightly news program and try to pass her opinions off as useful conversation is beyond me.		I think it’s situation such as this is why @CNN never saw Trump coming

@DailyCaller @DonLemon_CNN is so intellectually dishonest it’s becoming borderline insanity

@ChrisCuomo So when no details are readily available....Speculate! 		That’s seems like good reporting...smh
@ChrisCuomo I think @nikkihaley would be an awesome first female President 		I can’t imagine the attack adds...but I’m sure folks would get creative lol

@LeeBodendorfer @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @Buttercookie25 @CNN Terrible mistake..my humble apology
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @Buttercookie25 @CNN Dirty laundry!! Eddie Money said it best
@KamalaHarris Every thought of not committing a crime???! Doesn’t sound like an unreasonable solution
@angela_rye @RonDeSantisFL @mattgaetz Do you realize how unintelligent you sound claiming that in every election?? Seriously
@ChrisCuomo Proof?? That’s a noble concept you have ignored recently lol		Guess it depends on what ideology you chose to defend to how much “proof” you so demand, No?
@hrenee80 😢😢😢😢
@TheGreatFeather Good morning
@SenSchumer What about standing up for Everyone??  Is that such a foolish concept??! 		Punish All wrong doers to the full extent of the criminal justice system 		Which includes protesters who break windows and assault innocent individuals.
@4YrsToday It was a “job interview”!! Lol		And he was Hired!!
@DailyCaller That lady has some extremely mental issues

@RealSaavedra @hrenee80 Ouch...that’s gonna leave a mark
@jaketapper I agree with him 👇🏻
@ShredderBabe Biscuits &amp; gravy!!
@kaitlancollins I’m curious if All your colleagues at CNN will be asked to denounce the comments???! 		Seems to be the norm there...for conservatives anyways...
@brianefallon Omg!! Are you questioning a woman?! You are Evil!! 		See how dumb that sounds👆🏻		Let it soak in
@benshapiro @ayasgirl OMG!!! Taylor Swift is against women???? 		Breaking News
@madisongesiotto Replace RBG I guess would be too big of a Christmas gift to wish for....
Hmmmm...seems odd https://t.co/BGV8w4LNsR
@peterjhasson @kaitlancollins Why is it “dumb” to hold one accountable for thoughts and words but not others??! 		That’s exactly why the media is getting such scrutiny at the moment 		People reporting “Breaking News” for doing exactly the same unethical misdeeds .....smh
@kathygriffin Big Thank you! I appreciate yourself and @MichaelAvenatti helping Kavanaugh get confirmed!!
@Jillibean557 @TheGreatFeather I can’t believe at least one “Adult” in the crowd didn’t intervene....smh
@ChrisCuomo You really should get out of the bubble more often........		The confident questions you pose shows an extreme lack of intelligence
@brianefallon Agree
@olgita0101 @angela_rye Wouldn’t expect a classier comment lol 		Seems infectious
@angela_rye Outrageous lies ...hmmm		Touchè
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Please go away...........
@KamalaHarris How about standing up for Everyone?		Or is that a foreign concept??
@brianefallon Thank you Harry Reed!
@hrenee80 I must admit....		I’ve often wondered how one gets so much time to “Protest” ...		I’m looking for an 8th day in the week just to get work caught up 😔
@CoryBooker Tough loss Spartacus
Justice Kavanaugh!!! 		Finally
@Acosta @zackroday @StewSays Was that a confession??		You said “you guys won today”		Guess that’s mean you lost...smh 		Journalists my a..
@KirstenPowers I admire you you @KirstenPowers 		The tweets you keep posting are just as appalling to which you claim your offended of....
@juliaioffe That is not accurate....
@BiasedGirl @KatMcKinley Encourage her to file a police Report! 		I always thought that was the first course of action...		I’m not sure how the allegation would be investigated without specific details.
@realPolitiDiva @CarrieLockhart_ 🙏🏼
@TheGreatFeather Cut more please.....I don’t care much for first prediction lol
@sheilalclark I can’t wait lol
@KamalaHarris I agree 100%!! Unequivocally		But the willingness of you and most of your colleagues to destroy another persons life to further the cause is extremely concerning.
@hrenee80 https://t.co/tRbZh3euht
@DailyCaller Nice trying playing words. 		“He apologized for some the things he’s done”		Nice try CNN reporter lol
@chuckwoolery Ouch!! That’s gonna leave a mark

@brianefallon @lpolgreen Bad strategy you tried to employ		Using anyone for political gains is shameful
@JesseKellyDC He’s not a journalist...period

@DerekBrown4Real @Amstrix1 @abbydphillip @DanaBashCNN Facts don’t matter to certain individuals 😔
@ChrisCuomo Couldn’t that be termed: “it’s been Democrat’s position to oppose at all cost”?! 		That was said by D’s in the very beginning 		Guess it depends on your ideology
@ChrisCuomo Isn’t a rise a great thing in any increment?? Or is that much of a compliment to share?
@RepSwalwell Just Bc someone wants something to be true....Doesn’t make it True		My truth is....you are not a very good representative, you seem more interested in optics and talking points than the actual truth.
@brianefallon @WeDemandJustice As “All” should be help responsible for their votes and most importantly the accusation! But I guess that only goes one way for you and the politics you push. 😔
@ChrisCuomo @Alyssa_Milano Double standard???! What?		So now men are guilty until proven innocent ✔️		Men are horribly if they apologize ✔️		Whew....I need a new updated handbook.....😔
FBI release 302’s and Capital Police capture 302 😂 https://t.co/qmBfEQFXnu
@brianefallon @SenWarren Didn’t the Democrats of the SJC have to sign off the scope of the investigation ??! 		Ooops....you might not want followers to know that......		I would tell @SenWarren tho, she might need to be reminded of that.
@ananavarro Her feelings are still hurt from 2016
@sallykohn That’s rich

@ChrisCuomo I thought you said the questions you pose are meant to spark heated debates?? 		Obviously not a direct quote of you but accurate tho

@brianefallon Good luck! May the Truth be the winner!
@garthb42 @KamalaHarris I was referring to RBG.....but nice cover ✌🏻
@KamalaHarris Was that a Republican staffer just arrested??? ...no wait...
@KamalaHarris You actually just accused someone of being Partisan??? 😂😂😂😂
@benshapiro 1st but not the last!! I hope
@sheilalclark Seems like an effort to keep it from being leaked		Otherwise...no idea
@mkhammer Basketball??
@JuliaGulia809 @TheGreatFeather That is an odd strategy 🤔
@SenatorDurbin Let me guess.....		I’m to believe just Bc you say so?? 		Seems to be a theme of the month
@sheilalclark Is it rude to say...I wished I had been standing close by....		If our elected leaders and law enforcement don’t change the rules on expected behavior it’s only going to increase
@KamalaHarris https://t.co/Z4DtXl6jEt
@KamalaHarris Would you express the same sentiments for Karen Monahan? 		Haven’t seen the same concerns regarding her accusations?!
@poconomtn It’s the only club they are welcome in!
@1776HotLips @poconomtn @JoeNBC Holy Crap!! I’m speechless
@guypbenson This is society problem that we all bare responsibility for. 		When we let people misbehave and there are not consequences it becomes anarchy. 		Such as Civil Disobedience!! 		Wonder if I can be a Civil Bank Robber?? 🤔
@RealKyleMorris @hrenee80 PoW!!! Finally 		Brian’s comment priceless 	Up 20% 30% 40% or if we go down such doesn’t mater!! 		I’m laughing so hard at his ignorance..... 	sorry.....✌🏻
@CarrieLockhart_ @realDonaldTrump Jealous! I didn’t 😔		Dang At&amp;t must be Democrats 😂
@Corrynmb I never received it 😔
@sodagrrl Interesting
@ChrisCuomo Is that a theory?? Just curious
@KatMcKinley I have been screaming that for awhile now!! That in my view shows the level of effort that was put into this allegation. 		I challenge someone to contact google to have ones information removed and see how far you get!
@brianefallon I would think the money you spent on that add buy would’ve been better served if it went to victims of sexual assault.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @EricHolder Show should be named ...		             “The Theorist”
@ChrisCuomo Beg him to Run!!! Pleaseeee
@TheGreatFeather I saw that cartoon earlier....and to be honest, I cringed when I read it.......
@sheilalclark @JohnCooper0610 I have always try to be respectful when debating others with different political views. 		But this behavior is becoming more and more acceptable 😔
@JohnCooper0610 @sheilalclark God help us all
@brianefallon I’m sure it’s just an oversight....but didn’t @SenFeinstein (D) say the same??
@HeyTammyBruce Now!!! Georgetown needs to follow suit!! Period
@LetsWeighOnThis @TheGreatFeather @Thomas1774Paine If true...how can law enforcement stand-by and not intervene?? How???!
@newsbusters https://t.co/ctjNwnM0eP

@ChrisCuomo Joke.....right?? https://t.co/CggF4OdVWR
@ellencarmichael His tweet as already been removed 😂		It’s a shame you can’t get a PhD in common sense....would be very helpful to most
@mattyglesias That is simply grossly inaccurate 		But it’s twitter....you seemed to be able to form facts now the same as opinions and declare them Truthful 		God help us all if that becomes the standard for Justice
@skesseks @mfalpac @brianefallon @SenatorCollins Not sure what a “bot” is....but I’m sure I’ve been called worse 😂

@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller @CChristineFair What a joke
@cdkang76 @brianefallon @CPDAction Did @keithellison just get cleared Bc lack of collaboration??! 		Did you tweet in support of the accuser?! Just curious

@sheilalclark @Buttercookie25 Oh my.........
RT @ByronYork: Canada joins the US-Mexico trade agreement. Gonna be a new NAFTA. White House announcement coming before midnight. From WaPo…
@ByronYork Hahahahaha Justin blinked! 		Go Trump
@SenGillibrand This is below pathetic, you really should concentrate more on the oath you took to protect EVERYONE! 		You didn’t seem to mind praising Bill Clinton....but I guess that was just out of convenience. 	I can’t see how you get the first “woman’s vote” honestly I can’t
@jaketapper Great interview @jaketapper 		No comment on the rest of this thread	#Useless
@benshapiro I’m watching!
@MichaelAvenatti Chess?! Swinging??! ....		Im calling it another false allegation on you knowing how to play chess.....
@seanmdav @ErinEhyde200 Not shocked
@lyndseyfifield Btw ....what about the cats name??
@lyndseyfifield That has me baffled....not 1 D coming forward to say it’s not 100% conclusive
@nytimes How about her past? Facebook, yearbook, sicial media footprints??! 		Seems like a large effort to keep those private....
@AussieQOFE @poconomtn @prayingmedic Please be accurate
@aravosis I’ve got a novel idea....Win elections and you’re side can pick nominees 		Ooops....that was an unreasonable 	Idea, bad tweet ✌🏻
@KamalaHarris Agree 100%! But you disgrace the blood and sacrifice they gave for this Country’s justice and due process that you obviously had to take an oath to uphold. 		In order to push an agenda for the party you align with. 		That should trouble everyone
@lyndseyfifield @ana_r_quintana “Justice” cool name
@MelissaTweets I hope you are incorrect...but I’m nervous
@KamalaHarris Wait...wait.....I thought that was the purpose of a FBI investigation you so passionately argued for?? 		So before it’s completed you are calling for people to “flood the phones” to vote No??! 		Confusing on the logic you deploy
@ByronYork Did anyone catch Kelly Ann on CNN with Jake Tapper?		Can’t understand the comment he made “times were different when Bill Clinton was accused”		Was sexual assault legal then??! 		#Unbelievable
@JohnRJohnson @MichaelAvenatti @protesting2016 I think it goes to Sen Feinstein 😂
@TomFitton @Buttercookie25 @gatewaypundit Too late! I am fortunate own 3 business’s, all of which subscribed to the paper...		But after that article I canceled and have sent a letter to explain why I did.
@ChrisCuomo Better find another way to spin this allegation Bc on its face it’s not valid 		Would be hard for her to purger herself Bc she can’t remember any details of the day in question 		Hope everyone thinks about Justice that this sets presence for in the future
@beatleggs @angela_rye Point taken		Do you think she also perjured herself? A legitimate question btw
@angela_rye I’m worried that the crucification of a male just to shed light on an obvious injustice to women is not justifiable
@RileyJayDennis I actually feel sad for you and that tweet...😔
@MoveOn @brianefallon @JeffFlake Please keep talking and screaming, every word and tweet just makes the case of insanity clearer.		A world you wish for is solely based on emotions, and that would inevitably devour you as well.
@sickofDCrap @MegKinnardAP I was referring to sexual assault victims when it happens, not 36 years later. But I agree with you on the point you made.
@charliekirk11 @Buttercookie25 @charliekirk11, I’d like to see her Facebook page
@SenBillNelson Shocking
@MegKinnardAP I wished a movement would swell to Encourage women/men to come forward immediately. As with any crime swift action would increase the opportunity for justice. 🙏🏼		This is not justice		This is a media addiction to pain and suffering of others
@3310jj @KamalaHarris I will not defend that		But I also will not point at bad behavior to justify more bad behavior
@RebelScumPixie @KamalaHarris I guess I’ll say we disagree on how to solve problems and disagreements
@KamalaHarris That’s great....Saying if I don’t get my way I’ll just walk out and not do my job!! Seems logical ...if you are childish
@Dangerclose001 @Comey I think the part where she said “due to the alleged attack she “couldn’t” fly Bc she was claustrophobic” 		FYI ...I don’t like flying either, but I wouldn’t say I couldn’t.
@Dangerclose001 @Comey You obviously haven’t payed close attention this week to details if you are asking that question
@Comey And she is afraid to fly......smh https://t.co/GLJ8OA2J1n
@JRubinBlogger Very poor tweet....😔
@angela_rye @CuomoPrimeTime Simple minded question: 		1) Why are you always so mad? 		2) Seems you yell at people but get offend and cry foul when you are yelled at?
@jaketapper @megynkelly @SenBobCorker Great Analysis
@CW2_FP @SenBobCorker @ddale8 He’s not running again....fyi
@SenBobCorker @benshapiro I believe it the light of today’s testimony it’s the only logical choice.
@ellencarmichael @KimStrassel https://t.co/M9jEnSXJrp
@lyndseyfifield Glad I’m not the only one that found comment odd
@ByronYork @brianefallon  doesn’t have a great track record of being correct...just say’n
@brianefallon Is that a professional opinion? 	Bc it seems you made some other prophecies that didn’t come to pass.........✌🏻
@txldallas @MollyJongFast Exactly
@ChrisCuomo Put it to a vote!
@brianefallon Can’t wait to get RBG seat filled In the next 2 years! 👊🏻
@brianefallon That’s a bad tweet, especially from someone that’s supposedly educated 😔
@brianefallon Same thing you said about candidate Trump. How’d that turn out? 😊
@David_Gergen @brianefallon @AC360 Bad tweet sir
@JessicaTarlov You could make a big difference in the dialogue @JessicaTarlov 		Putting the D and R away, this has a lot of holes in it
@brianefallon Hasn’t he out smarted you enough for one lifetime?! Or are you just a slow learner?! Respectfully of course
@lyndseyfifield Being at a party where the alleged crime was committed...That makes him guilty? Confused
@ChrisCuomo On a serious note @ChrisCuomo, does the latest allegation say K sexual assaulted anyone?
@brianefallon I didn’t realize he got a vote...silly me I guess
@armyissue69 @TigerWoods Thanks @armyissue69! Sounds like valuable advice.
@KatMcKinley Big Question 2: 		What is going to happen when Trump gets to replace SCJ  RBG?!		Very plausible
@ChrisCuomo Great point @ChrisCuomo 	“Saying it doesn’t make it true”	Would be great advice for you and the guest that are interviewed, although you would like them to be.
@ByronYork Touché 😂
@ShredderBabe @J_H_5 @Maxineskrazy @MichaelAvenatti https://t.co/3stGehsT2l
@JoeConchaTV @DLoesch https://t.co/ulDbYnUE26
@KamalaHarris @ChrisCuomo I can’t see no one opposing that! 	Especially if it’s a stand alone bill and doesn’t get filled with other unpopular bills that wouldn’t have a chance being passed
@DailyCaller This guy is Toxic
@DLoesch OkOk ...I’ll be the illiterate one here, what’s 4chan?
@resistasistah @ChrisCuomo I wished all women could be encouraged to come forward immediately. And all that are guilty should have to answer for their actions. 		By asking the Senate to give her justice automatically makes it political and that is truly not justice for either side.
@resistasistah @ChrisCuomo I agree 100% with the first part of that tweet
@resistasistah @ChrisCuomo Christine Ford hasn’t filed a police report......do you question that as well?
@charliekirk11 FINALLY!!!!! Been waiting on someone to ASK JUST THAT!!
@guypbenson I can’t believe he just said that... https://t.co/uEotJ4rLns
@USANEWS007 Can her Facebook account be subpoenaed?
@zerohedge @USANEWS007 Hopefully she has filed criminal charges!
@guypbenson Outrageous is an Understatement @guypbenson
@USANEWS007 WoW....didn’t see that coming!
@guypbenson Didn’t see that coming.....wow
@ShredderBabe New Rule: only half the speech in the country is free 😂
@lkmcgann @guypbenson @MichaelAvenatti He’s an empty suit
@MichaelAvenatti @MichaelAvenatti has Breaking News, Bombshell report always followed by “please stay tuned” it seems daily...how about just reporting a crime and leave all the hype if your truly genuinely concerned about justice for victims . But I guess that doesn’t get him an invite onto CNN
@Anken4Sissy @DailyCaller That’s brings on more conversation then, thanks for the clarity
@DailyCaller Never knew you had to have license to save life.........confused
@benshapiro Looking forward to new show tonight @benshapiro
@LauraLoomer @USANEWS007 I don’t doubt that 😔
@DailyCaller I’m sorry....but his voice drives me crazy 😔 not mention his views
@DTrumpTrain_ Please share detail!!! https://t.co/duueTLQkqu
@USANEWS007 @TigerWoods @playofffinale Awesomely return!! @TigerWoods
@ChrisCuomo I personally wouldn’t take responsibility of my peers actions, I suspect you wouldn’t either @ChrisCuomo but that was a cool false analogy
@ChrisCuomo Dirty laundry always sells...you already knew that tho
@ByronYork Sets a bad example for future nominations on either side, No?
@guypbenson No need to glorify him with a reply @guypbenson, it’s like having a battle of wits with an unarmed person
@guypbenson Facts are stubborn things at times...
@ByronYork Where’s @ChrisCuomo at with this Breaking News?!
@ByronYork I bet that gave CNN a punch in the gut
@ShredderBabe @1bigbeer IknowIknow...may be home early 😂
@RedFish412 @JesseNada441020 @USANEWS007 @Twitter @RealJamesWoods Seems awful petty....
@1bigbeer @ShredderBabe Interesting....
@ShredderBabe Ouch!!!!
@RealCandaceO @USANEWS007 How can that remain “confidential”?	Our money spent
@ShredderBabe Gators or Vols tonight @ShredderBabe ??! 🏈
@maziehirono Sounds like a gesture of kind consideration more than “hiding”....	But what do I know, you elected people are supposed to be the smart ones.
@USANEWS007 @Twitter @RealJamesWoods What was the tweet that was deemed so offensive?
@DailyCaller Didn’t similar polls predict her in a Landslide Victory to begin with....?
@CuomoPrimeTime @KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo Empty suit #CuomoPrimeTime 	Why is it CNN anchors are always so angry at people with conservative values but are so accommodating to those with more liberal minded views?? Serious question btw
@hannabogorowski @DailyCaller How can the accused testify first if it’s so unclear what the allegations are?? This is getting more skeptical by the day and ever more clouds the seriousness of such a disgraceful act by anyone.
@ChrisCuomo Dr. Fords attorney demands Accused testifying first??? How can you testify to an allegation if the accuser hasn’t made it clear what the allegations are? Wow...my head is spinning....
@ShredderBabe Repeat the talking points breathlessly and they become facts is the strategy...smh
@bumperman119 @iowahawkblog I think they are lobbying for a government bailout!!! 😂	#goodluck
@greggutfeld, don’t let Juan off that easy on dodging the question on Keith Ellison 😔
@ChrisCuomo Had 8 years of CNN doing that for Previous Administration.....seems you are having trouble reaping what you “journalist” (lol) have sown
@MissieAnderson @AndreaTantaros
