@elizabethforma This cartoon is a lie!		Market cap shrinks directly in the amount of the buyback. It‚Äôs  how capital moves in our economy.		Lower  taxes motivates the rich in invest in OUR country!		Heads up readers, when Congress tells you higher tax is good ..		Read a book instead, not tweets.
@AmyCA0214 What a load of nonsense. Stock buybacks reduce market cap by the size of the buyback. That's how capital moves.		The impact of tax cuts is at the market level. In new ventures, new jobs, improved infrastructure and increased competition benefiting consumers.
I hope no one is under the delusion that the fall of the former Soviet Union represented the end of the Cold War.		The only difference now is that the US has stopped fighting back.  https://t.co/nwHXfrQZns
Tariffs are effectively taxes against consumers.		It‚Äôs sad to see how casually the world forces the poor to pay as much as the rich for political games, often impacting food costs directly. Shameful. https://t.co/t1UOmkjnKS

United, American and Southwest ALL stood up and told the Feds no, we aren't committing your child abuse. They stuck their necks out in a way I didn't see anybody in Congress do.		My money is with them!
@lacnavmar @GWSigg @SteveWestly The size of seats, the nickel and diming, and the moo'ing, as much as I hate those things, all emerged from market forces, not the collusive force of a monopoly. You get what you pay for ... and ppl don't like paying much.		You want taxpayers to buy you leg room?
@GWSigg @lacnavmar @SteveWestly If you live in LA or SF, you can probably afford to pay to move your own goalposts. If you can't, better transit to Santa Rosa would help you.
@GWSigg @lacnavmar @SteveWestly Seems to me a much better use of infrastructure money would be to improve the human density problems, not with trains between SFO and LA, but new routes to more sparsely populated regions ... making affordable housing reachable.
@GWSigg @lacnavmar @SteveWestly If you want tax payers to buy you a train to LA, don‚Äôt lie and claim monopoly.		You‚Äôre really just using tax dollars to build something people aren‚Äôt choosing to build with their own money.		Given the rapid innovation in automated vehicles, big investment now seems dubious too.

@bonczar @CNN Yep, that was stupid and is a big part of the problems we have at the border today. We agree that zero tolerance is generally silly.
@bonczar @CNN I do hope we don‚Äôt have any policies that are in conflict with written law.		I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but really doubt the law requires that children be separated from their folks and put in cages.		IMO, we should clarify the law to prevent such behavior.

@bonczar @CNN I agree that these politicians are using this, and all sorts of other nonsense to promote their own brand. It‚Äôs terrible.		I really don‚Äôt even bother listening usually as I think most of em are corrupt to the core. 		I draw a line at child torture though. Use some other pawns.
@bonczar @CNN I completely agree with you about the left. They don‚Äôt really care about people, just their people.		They are kinda like the right in that way.		You‚Äôre probably correct about that Trump observation too. It‚Äôs another area where the right and left are converging.
@bonczar @CNN I really disagree with ya on this. 		To punish a child for the crimes of their parent is wrong and unnecessary here. Many of these children are being seriously hurt by this.		Seems Trump is using these children to force immigration reform. It feels like extortion. We‚Äôre not this.
@bonczar @CNN You are right. I don‚Äôt get it. So I‚Äôm asking		Do you feel sticking kids in cages without their folks is an appropriate response here?		Does it matter if Obama did it? Wrong is wrong, right?		Do you believe the division it created in our country and around the world is worth it?
@williegee123 @TheEconomist I think you‚Äôre seeing something you want to see in my reply. I didn‚Äôt suggest any of those things, though I might have suggested transportation.

@tgnoble @cspan @NFIB @realDonaldTrump We agree completely! Lawbreakers are bad, kid stealing also bad, I shouldn't make up false news AND IF it turns out there are kids in cages you'd be outraged by it and want to see whoever was behind it punished, right?
@tgnoble @cspan @NFIB @realDonaldTrump Is this your entire point? If you're trying to convince us all that I'm an idiot ... well, you're right. No one is arguing against that.		Can we agree though, that sticking these kids in cages is unnecessary and wrong?
@tgnoble @cspan @NFIB @realDonaldTrump Seriously, I really don't have an agenda. I don't even know who Bill Kristol is, and I don't care. If I RT'd him, he said something smart. My ideology is freedom, pure and simple. Therefore, I don't like seeing kids in cages.
@CNN If these were American children sitting in cages on the other side of our border, we'd be at arms. Abusing children to punish parents is shameful. This policy is shameful.
@tgnoble @cspan @NFIB @realDonaldTrump Progressive? First time anyone has accused me of that! Course I live in NorCal so I realize it's a little weird here.		Tell me, where did your rant about slaves and segregation laws come from? Weren't we talking about child incarceration here?

@troy_windes @CNN @GOP If you think I was an Obama fan, you‚Äôre dead wrong. I blame Obama, Hilary, @CNN, @FoxNews, my own church, most the left, most of the right and most politicians for dividing this great country into a bunch of greedy children, producing Trump. We‚Äôre all to blame for this.
@cal_aa @CNN @GOP It‚Äôs honest advice. The conservative perspective is important. Untempered, the left will bankrupt us all. However, Trump and his supporters misrepresent conservative thinking. Now is the time for the real @GOP to stand up or move aside. Remember the @GOP? https://t.co/Yc45YqWdWi

@NickPisca Separating children from murderers is very different from throwing children in cages, right? What‚Äôs the point of separating families in these types of cases anyway? Aside from being monstrous, it is impractical. Why pay for the childcare. (I do realize Trump isn‚Äôt paying much.)

@kaitlancollins Americans should be MORE upset about these tariffs than the Chinese, as we are more directly impacted. We are the ones paying the tariff (inflation), and Trump redistributes the proceeds to his friends. China‚Äôs retaliation is icing on the tyranny-cake.
@HillaryClinton @dumptrump33 Anyone else tired of paying off politicians and lawyers for justice. This situation is self evident. Americans do not imprison children. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for the great state of Texas to stop waiting for federal support to end this crime.
@jacobsoboroff Ask ICE where they‚Äôre hiding their humanity while you at it.
@survivethegrind @BuzzFeedNews Exactly! The purpose of history is to learn from it, not to use it as an excuse for law.
@politico American voters have repeatedly demanded the release of these children. Since @SecNielsen suggests that action, in spite of morality, is justified in these cases, whoever is within reach of this woman should toss her in jail. Citizens need a bargain chip to play the @GOP game.
@BuzzFeedNews Anyone else a little horrified by the typical alt-right response of, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal, we incarcerate kids all the time.‚Äù  We shouldn‚Äôt separate kids from parents unless it serves the most deserving victim of crime, the CHILD. Parents can be punished without torturing kids.
Hey @EdKrassen, this is better than nothing, but not much. @GOP, a missing helicopter and an absent analyst isn‚Äôt a commitment to ending this. Given your lack of action here, I‚Äôd vote to have you all fill the cages the children currently occupy. Your houses should hold the kids. https://t.co/iQSBMRHIDV

@yonathanseleshi @TheEconomist That BI sounds a lot like Milton‚Äôs negative income tax ... still seems that subsidies for higher ed are basically subsidies for the rich.  Dollar per dollar, prison reform would contribute more toward equality goals I‚Äôd say. Incentivizing, improving lower ed seems helpful too.
@yonathanseleshi @TheEconomist Educational grants and whatever you might mean by #basicincome are not at all similar to someone educating themselves. They are the exact opposites of the idea.
@yonathanseleshi @TheEconomist There is absolutely no reason to fund anyone else's higher education goals but your own. If you are capable of completing a higher education program, you are capable of financing it yourself. Fund lower education. State funding should go no higher than community college IMO.

@ScottDavidson54 @ACLU @ABAesq Sadly, that seems true sometimes. Please know though, I'm not endorsing the idea that the police should be shooting anybody, while remembering sometimes they have to.
@TheEconomist If we don't, the ever decreasing population of working people will continue to produce for everyone else until we die (or become rich or dependent). From here, the rich will move away from the newly minted, banana republic, and tyranny emerges. I can feel it now. (Trump)
@TheEconomist I believe in the US, if we refocused our energy toward improving the flaws that have crept into or were baked into our system based on capitalistic ideals, improved the framework for competition and modernized the Bar Association and A. Medical Association, we'd be on our way.
@TheEconomist Oh, we should have probably eliminated or at least muted intellectual property rights in areas where investment isn't really required. There's no good excuses for a company with Google's power, nor very good reasons for many of the billionaires in SV.
@TheEconomist Much of US economy is trapped in socialist-like schemes currently. Any gov't employee including military or anyone under gov't assistance (in proportion to dependence). Unions, BAR Association &amp; AMA also pollute the stream. Why can't anyone afford healthcare? Remember Detroit?
@ACLU @ABAesq I can't be the only realizing that if this crime where committed by an African American in Oakland, he'd have been shot dozens of times by the police by now ...
@ACLU I should also add, it is VERY difficult for a society to maintain law if it is not generally applied. The longer we allow this horrible crime to continue, our entire society suffers. @ABAesq, what is your excuse for what seems like a rats nest of laws that only protect lawyers?
@ACLU Trump is using these children as a politic bargaining chip, and it's disgusting. He is trying to force rationality in our immigration policies. Its difficult to maintain welfare AND open immigration. As true as this may be, it's no justification for torturing children.
