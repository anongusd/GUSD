@Morning_Joe @clairecmc FDR and Lincoln did not meet in the middle.  They took chances.  Use ur imagination.  Believe in the seemingly impossible.  Leaders do not doubt, which is why u are not in office, u doubted too much.  Doubted the power of the people.  Only cowards work w/ idiots and devels = GOP
@clairecmc You are too timid.  FDR and Lincoln were not timid, they did not meet in the middle.  And they faced deep, deep divisions.  Grow some imagination.  Realize that leaders take chances &amp; inspire.  Only doubters &amp; cowards want to work with idiots and devils.

@SpeakerPelosi #Impeachment is a big deal, duh!  It's not a legal process.  This IS political!  Deal w/ it.  Deal with the fact that the voters gave u &amp; ur party 8.5% voters over the #Republicans.  Don't like it? Resign!  NOW!
for political reasons. When the president is derelict in his duty, when he does not protect and defend the Constitution, you are oat bound to impeach.  It is not a matter of choice.  It is a simple matter of fulfilling your oath.  Unless you plead cowardice as #Republicans do.
@RepSchneider Why do you lie to your constituents?  #Impeachment is very much about politics, and, nowhere in the #Constitution is it written that only high crimes and misdemeanors qualify as cause to impeach.  You can--your oath requires that when needed--you do impeach
@TeamPelosi Your  +8.5%  margin of victory was based on #impeach Trump.  Love it or lump it.

@RepCummings As to @RashidaTlaib &amp; her language.  It's passionate and fits with the number of seats in the House that #Democrats flipped.  It matches the 8.5% margin of overall votes Democrats beat #Republicans by.  If u don't see that, u r not working 4 t/ people.  Maybe u are

@realDonaldTrump We should not be surprised.  U told us that you don't care about the fall out from our debt.  Now we know that you don't care about whose military: the wild and  irresponsible withdraw from #Syria.  The dumb and cowardly desire to leave #Afghanistan.  Worst POTUS
@WhipHoyer Does the capricious withdrawal of our forces from Syria, and the seeding of military control to #Putin , raise to the level of #Impeachment ?  Is this #Treason?  It's your call, sir.
If #POTUS45 only had advisers as intelligent and cogent as your brother.  Oh, wait.  He would not listen?  No wonder we are in this #stateofemergency  	@morningmika https://t.co/eH43iOexOP

@Ocasio2018 Is the sudden and uncoordinated withdrawal of troops from Syria grounds for impeachment?  Is this #Treason?  Seeding the military advantage to #Putin sure looks treasonous to me.
@RepJerryNadler Is the sudden and uncoordinated withdrawal of troops from Syria grounds for impeachment?  Is this treason?  Seeding the military advantage to Putin sure looks treasonous to me.
@NancyPelosi Is the sudden  and uncoordinated withdrawal of troops from Syria worthy of #impeachment?  It's your call whether this betrayal is in fact #Treason .
@SenCoonsOffice Is the sudden and uncoordinated withdrawal of troops from Syria cause for impeachment?
@realDonaldTrump Is the withdraw of troops worth impeaching #Trump? @Morning_Joe
Worst president ever: #Trump or #Buchanann?   @morningmika
I agree.  Indeed, this was the first thought I had.  Shortly after the Helsinki meeting Russia media made mention of an agreement dealing w/ Syria..  I hope that this move qualifies as treason.  Cyber war + aiding the enemy by leaving Syria. @realDonaldTrump  @JRubinBlogger https://t.co/8C2o97wnr0

@SenBlumenthal Eh?  Yup.  Good luck with that idea, Senator.  Maybe he will nominate--seeing as how POTUS cannot appoint anyone to the Supreme Court--you.
@Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump It's time to call POTUS Nazi.
@Morning_Joe What Mr. Meecham knows about the Trumps in the past is beside the point.  The President has the duty of living in the here and now.  What used to be is of no relevance.
@Morning_Joe "@realDonaldTrump's government"  That is so scary.  So against the way the founding brothers saw their dream and their work.
@morningmika Yes, you can call it brainwashing.  Just look at the social and psychological research done after WWII.  Most of the research was done in the United States
@Morning_Joe Not since slavery has the United States done anything close to what is going on at the border.

@thehill That is the least of our worries about @realDonaldTrump, the sociopath that he is.
@Morning_Joe Given the upcoming  intel meeting with Kelly and the lies that will be spread after said meeting, it's time to call @realDonaldTrump a sociopath.
@Stateoftheunion Mr. Tapper have you forgotten #theBradyBill?  Seriously.  Re: Why didn't Democrats do more on gun control.
@thehill Old news.  This was reported on @TheBeatWithAri (@MSNBC) around about a month ago.  Maybe earlier than that.  BTW, it's conspiracy, not collusion.
@quinncy @MDavidNichols  Responsibility rests with the shooter.  Geez, I could've killed a few people when I was in high school.  I was awkward, often moody (even depressed), and embarrassed--a lot, &amp; that was my problem, not my classmates.  They did the best they could.  We all did.
@quinncy What private message.  Why is it always males who act out when their advances are rebuffed?  Can't we men learn more mature ways of dealing with expectations denied.  #NeverAgain #RejectTheNRA
@NewsHour @JudyWoodruff your concern regarding what that one student said concerning her expectations that a shooting would occur in Santa Fe is right on.  We have crossed the Rubicon.  FWI, @jaketapper agrees with you.  So do I.
Use conspiracy.  That is what the Russians and @realDonaldTrump  were (are?) involved in AND that is illegal.  Remember, words matter.  Make your meaning clear.
@Morning_Joe  Pls stop using the word "collusion."  Collusion means to collude, to work together on a goal.  The goal can be good, bad, or indifferent.  There is nothing illegal per se about colluding--working together--on a project or mission.
@MeredithFrost Rad!
@realDonaldTrump As much as you want to bust our economy, doing so at the expense of national security is pointless.  U end up letting China continue to rape us.  ZTE is only a part of China's spy network.  Dealing w/ viapers like that gets u, and the USA, nowhere.

@Morning_Joe  the most sensible reason @POTUS wants more TV lawyers is that he is fighting the battle over impeachment instead of the battle over various assistants of his serving jail time.
This seems like a good idea.  #sexbanned https://t.co/skaCx7QiSW

@Morning_Joe Re Fox and Friends interview.  Evil people tend to act in self-destructive ways.  #POTUS, #MichaelCohen
So reports get deep sixed, or not written.  After you investigate that, then you can be concerned with due process.
@Morning_Joe Re: Ronny Jackson.  A commentator on MSNBC recently said that the military has a saying, "different spanks for different ranks".  So, who is going to spank the Rear Admiral and Doc tot he POTUS?  #RonnyJackson
@wolfblitzer  Such short memories:: Trump has already been told that he's not a target of the #Mullerinvestigation.
@RealDonad_Trump Yes, what happened to Flynn--who copped a plea--is fair.  What's hap[ened to you--the Devil Incarnate--is nowhere near fare.
@Morning_Joe  Never mind that FBI.  If I were a black person in Chicago and served on a jury, I'd never, ever trust any testimony from any police officer.  Period.  So, the FBI has nothing on the local law enforcement throughout many of the States.

@Morning_Joe  Joe, is it a problem that the Mueller investigation seems to have gone off the rails or that the press is obsessed with Stormy?  CNN, yesterday, lead "Out front" with Daniels and not the debate over the material gleaned from the warrant(s).  #StormyDaniels  #muller
@thehill Only to you, former Speaker.
@boycottstarbuc1  Inexcusable and utterly unacceptable!

@Morning_Joe   Admit it, Joe.  GOP legislators have sold their soul to the Devil incarnate.  That's why they don't stand up to #POTUSTrump
@Morning_Joe, Joe get your facts right.  Obama was following Bush's negotiated end to our presence in Iraq.
@Morning_Joe  #idiots the GOP. Tariffs on medical devices! #idiots
In other words, even @NRA has the patriotic duty to tell the Truth about our Constitution and its laws.  The other option is to shut up and sit down; otherwise, you make gun owners look like so many members of the Know Nothing Party and Luddites.
