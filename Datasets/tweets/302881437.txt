@jannievandalen1 Actually prices are about the same through the US.  Some variation obviously but, it really depends on the company setting how much profit they want and how much do they dominate the market share they have in that market.  Many subsidize markets they are trying to break into.
@canineasylum I agree.  I was referring to the consumer side of business.  Caregivers and first responders are to be blessed for they are doing the work for the greater good of people.
@DavidJSpellman @Baseball_More That was the call. The pressures by the employers to go to the lowest common dominator has created the roll back of worker conditions.  Consumers could put this to an end if we were to wait 24 hours to purchase.
@Baseball_More @DavidJSpellman We do have extra pay if you have to work and holiday pay if you don’t.  People who have been there the longest get to choose whether they work or not.
I totally agree with you.  There are some that need to to care for the sick.  I am referring to the stores and businesses that could be closed.  Surely we could wait 24 hours to spend the money everyone works so hard to get. https://t.co/rE25omcVLu
