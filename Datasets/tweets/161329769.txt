@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud Concerning the two large generators at Palo Seco, PREPA is assessing the transmission grid's ability to balance loads providing sustainable grid power throughout the region. (8/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud Based on this, the UCG endorsed PREPA's recommendation and FEMA subsequently directly USACE to begin demobilization operations at Yabucoa, in order to remove the large generator. (7/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud This determination was based on their assessment of repairs to the transmission lines, grid stability, and load capacity of the Yabucoa Plant. (6/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud PREPA determined that the FEMA provided generator at the Yabucoa Power Plant was no longer required to support grid stabilization or additional load capacity. (5/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud The decision to maintain and/or extend the additional generators at Palo Seco &amp; Yabucoa is a FEMA decision, informed by a PREPA assessment &amp; endorsement by the Unified Coordination Group consisting of senior leaders from the Government of Puerto Rico, PREPA, FEMA, &amp; USACE. (4/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud USACE, working in support of FEMA and based on a request made by the Governor of Puerto Rico, executed repairs to the PREPA controlled electrical grid to include contracting for the installation of the generators at Palo Seco and Yabucoa Power Plants. (3/14)
@eduardobhatia @AndrewScurria @CNNEE @danicacoto @DavidBegnaud Regarding your request for USACE to reconsider the decision to remove the three large generators at Palo Seco and Yabucoa and instead, extend their lease for four months to Dec. 1, 2018, this is not a USACE decision. (2/14)
