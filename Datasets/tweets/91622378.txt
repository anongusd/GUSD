@TinaMcGugan For all we know at this point tho, It could be someone opposed to the metoo movement trying to make them look bad. I have trust issues with society lately :)
@TinaMcGugan I assume that the metoo movement may oppose this because of news reports interviewing the woman claiming to be the one in the photo said she did not consent to this kiss &amp; the sailor had just grabbed &amp; kissed her.

@capnmarrrrk Taxing low MPG cars higher will likely put most of the tax burden for roads on backs of the poor who can't afford hybrids.  Although I think that since large trucks cause more road damage that they should be charged much more than any cars.
@z56po I doubt it will pass but it does highlight an issue with using only gas taxes to pay for state roads.
@z56po One way to look at it. As of now, since MO's only road maintenance taxes are from gas taxes, people who drive Tesla's use the road while paying nothing for them. People with high MPG pay less for same use as low MPG cars. I think tolls would be more direct to charge for use
@capnmarrrrk If we try a sales tax then people who don't have cars are paying. Same with income tax or property tax (one could argue they benefit from roads anyway I guess). Tolls or some kind of miles-driven system would be the closest to taxing use. But we hate tolls in Missouri.
@capnmarrrrk At first, but as we adopt more electric/hybrid and high MPG cars it will drop dramatically and we won't be able to fund the roads. Unless we start a new model such as tolls or, like this one, increased registration fees.
@z56po All Missouri's road repair taxes are collected by gas tax. Voters turned down 2 gas tax hikes in a row. Since MPG is only going to increase, thus decreasing income, yes they are looking to get people who use roads but don't buy much or any gas to pitch in more in licensing.

@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn Thanks for addressing these issues with us. I feel people don‚Äôt understand the extend of his policies. I sure don‚Äôt. I do, however, agree with not Pershing the death penalty. So it‚Äôs not as if I oppose all his changes
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn No but it is a deterrent for others to not do the same. Like I said, people will go after their own justice if they feel the system will not. It‚Äôs a worry. Will see how it goes
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn Mostly drug related which, again, shouldn‚Äôt be a crime anyway and is victimless. Felonies with a victim are much different.
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn I think if he had not included felonies it would have gone over easier.
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn I didn‚Äôt fully support him or his promises. Just thought he was lesser of 2 evils. Voting for him does not mean I supported all his campaign promises
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn ‚Äúprosecuting attorneys will issue summons for court dates ‚Äî rather than warrants for arrest ‚Äú
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn There won‚Äôt be a trial if you can‚Äôt get the offender to appear in court. Cash bail &amp; warrants attempts to do this. Now there will be nothing to force compliance. Like I said, will see how it goes
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn As long as they voluntarily show up to court sure.
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn That‚Äôs true. So none of his reforms affect the real problem we have in the county. I‚Äôll give him benefit of doubt and see how it goes but I‚Äôm apprehensive, and so are many who voted for him
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn They will attempt to prosecute them as long as they bother to show up to court. Which I have little faith most will do if no warrant will be issued
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn Us in St. Louis county wanted to eliminate small muni‚Äôs jailingbpeople for not paying their BS fines (mismatched curtains in Pagedale etc.). Not for stealing cars &amp; other real crimes. Too far
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn I support criminal justice reform in that all victimless crimes should not be crimes at all &amp; mandatory minimums should be abolished not that crimes with victims should be brushed off by prosecutors.
@TheOtherHepburn @jenesq2 I voted for him because there was only one other choice. I had not, and still do not agree with many of his policy changes. So I would say ‚Äòwill of the voters‚Äô is a poor foundation to base this on
@TheOtherHepburn @jenesq2 What these policies tell me is that - if I catch someone stealing my car I had best dispense what justice I feel is appropriate myself because I‚Äôm not going to get it from Bell‚Äôs office. And this is a dangerous attitude for a population to have.
@TheOtherHepburn @jenesq2 Agree. ‚ÄòNon-violent‚Äô is drug charges to me. I‚Äôm assuming he is putting property crime in that group. I prefer the non-prosecution of ‚Äòvictimless‚Äô crimes. Many non-violent crimes do have a victim that demands justice
@TheOtherHepburn @jenesq2 I feel this catch-and-release will give us a toothless justice system. I would prefer felonies not be under this policy. Not that all crimes need to have the book thrown at them tho. I‚Äôm fine with the child support change honestly.
@jenesq2 @TheOtherHepburn ‚ÄúIf the victim of the crime has signs of a physical injury‚Äù - sounds like this will also go for violent offenses as long as the victims isn‚Äôt too physically injured... seems a confusing set of exemptions

@IDontRentPigs They tossed one from the ballot over it for a bit but another judge put it back on. Really we can't do anything unless we have the funds to challenge it in court. Which mostly we don't.
I wouldn't really call the gains on either side of the Mid-Terms a "wave". But the change was significant and the new divided legislative branch will ensure some glorious gridlock. #EverybodyWins
Of course in some states such as Missouri there is a law stating a ballot initiative can't have more than 1 subject. But from what we saw on the ballot during the mid-terms no one really pays attention to that unless someone funds a lawsuit
Want to put a bill on the ballot to drown kittens? Sounds like people may not like that so try this: Provide small increase in funding for shelters + drown all kittens. Then simply market the bill as helping shelter cats. Just keep the drowning part a couple sentences down.
Good lesson for ballot initiatives going forward after this mid-term - Put more than one subject in them &amp; only market the more popular part. Ethics reform + confusing redistricting change? Only market the ethics reform, cause everybody likes that.

@capnmarrrrk Maybe one day some kind of music license bloc-chain can deal with it :)
@capnmarrrrk But for instance, a politician could not use an artist's music for a radio or TV commercial as that would require a 'sync' license from both artist and record label. And that's when the artist can say no. The blanket venue licenses are just that - blanket for everyone at venue
@capnmarrrrk I think that's a different sort of license. ASCAP/BMI gives blanket licenses to venues (not people or orgs) to play music live. If license organizations have to keep track of which bands don't like which politicians, or companies it will be unruly &amp; not work.
If musicians are going to be picky about who can use their songs under ASCAP/BMI then an industry-wide change will be needed. An annoying one everyone will hate: Axl Rose has told Trump not to play our music at his rallies.  https://t.co/S6gsxrnHcQ

@amagrammie Not really a difference in how legal entities known as companies work.
@amagrammie Back to your original article, which is from 2014, Monsanto will not take over the Uruguay Marijuana market because Monsanto doesn‚Äôt exist and was never interested in that market.
@amagrammie They own it and now there is only 1 company - Bayer. Just like Southwestern Bell was a company and then AT&amp;T bought them. Now Southwestern Bell no longer exists as a company. But you can believe what you want.
@amagrammie Anyway, when Monsanto did exist, and had a twitter handle - every year on 4/20 they would answer the same questions about Marijuana research. Every year it was the same - they have no research or interest in research on marijuana. It was a popular conspiracy though
@amagrammie One company bought the other. But people from both companies all now work for one company. The legal entity that was Monsanto no longer exists. The legal entity that is Bayer does exist and now includes what was purchased. Thus "One Company".
@amagrammie There is only one name on the building sign out front.
@amagrammie But there are plenty of other companies looking into Marijuana research, especially in Canada https://t.co/nomogYUH2Z
@amagrammie Yes. Bayer bought Monsanto and retired the Monsanto name. The company that was Monsanto does not exist. Everything that it was is now Bayer. It is One company. And before it was part of Bayer, Monsanto had no investments or research in Marijuana.

So 3 hours in the hospital with confirmed impassable kidney stone &amp; agonizing pain and my mother has yet to receive even so much as an aspirin. #WarOnOpioids
The current regulatory environment stacks the deck in favor of the healthcare establishment to protect their profits &amp; practices at the expense of consumers.
So maybe you can see why people, even free-market supporting people, want to see a change in the way the US handles healthcare.
@michaelranaii Mostly at the behest of those profiting
So maybe a hospital wants to open on your area that will actually provide care on saturdays and Sundays.. ‚Äúnope‚Äù says the ‚Äúnon-profit religious charity compassionate‚Äô established hospitals &amp; their lobbyists. You are to take only our care how we want to give it &amp; thank us for it
‚ÄòJust go to another hospital‚Äô they will say. But there is no free market in medical care in the US. Hospitals get to actually decide whether or not other hospitals are allowed to open &amp; compete in the same market https://t.co/XSzCv6R8uA
So then you have to stay in the hospital until Monday which jacks up your bill for no other reason than they don‚Äôt have anyone available to provide service.
So if you go to the hospital on the weekend with a kidney stone too big to pass &amp; you are in crippling pain they can‚Äôt do much for you. Since everyone is afraid of giving out pain meds you basically have to suffer until Monday.
Until my mother started having a lot of health problems I never realized how difficult it is to get medical treatment on the weekends even at hospitals. #TheMoreYouKnow

@JamesOverholt I don't think the government is the only entity that can afford to design new nuclear reactors. Not sure I'd trust them to, certainty not this government. The ones in design now are not being done by any government.
@JamesOverholt Denying nuclear out of fear makes more radioactive waste. So counter productive if the goal is no nuke waste https://t.co/PZE6Vm3D4d
@JamesOverholt Even with the few accidents, coal has killed more with pollution and coal waste is even more radioactive and abundant than spent nuke fuel. So there's that.
@JamesOverholt Renewable sources are intermittent thus requiring a backup. As of now, backup is coal and gas (actually it is the main source but still). Eventually we could have more renewable but would still need backup. Should be nuclear for 0 carbon

@CorporaCallosa If we decided to socialize the social media &amp; force then under the arm of government regulation it would take years of lawsuits. &amp; then we would have social media as long as the ruling party likes what is said.
@CorporaCallosa I guess. Twitter suspended one of our senate candidates for a few days. Still, there are other platforms &amp; websites. Did anything ever come of the right-wing platform Gab?
Those of you calling for regulation on FB etc over Alex Jones should be careful what you wish for. FB would probably love to be a regulated utility. It would cement their position on top. No competitor could afford to comply with what they will push for.
@CorporaCallosa If infowars dot com gets really big (its big already) can I demand access to the platform for my messages? Probably not. Jones is just lucky his web host hasn‚Äôt kicked him off
@CorporaCallosa For now. Everyone I know under 20 doesn‚Äôt even use FB. They all on the snapchats. He isn‚Äôt blocked from google ads, just their YouTube platform. Youtube demonetized a shitton of people this year (even me). There are plenty other sites
@CorporaCallosa That is when politicians choose a platform for their official communication. They don‚Äôt have to. No law makes them join. I don‚Äôt agree with the ‚Äúpoliticians can‚Äôt block you‚Äù ruling. But that would be a good argument in monopoly hearings
@CorporaCallosa If they were an ISP I would agree. They are just a website. How silly would we look now if we made the government take over MySpace because it was so popular. It could fall at any time. It is not vital for society like electric etc.
For years Alex Jones told us not to take vaccines or chemotherapy and instead buy his supplements or eat apricot seeds or some other nonsense. These are harmful lies. The major platforms had no problem with this. Now there are lawsuits and suddenly he‚Äôs out.
@Fenella_Wicks @TexasLiberty15 It would make an interesting case. I‚Äôm not one for government regulation or control myself. I‚Äôm not sure they constitute a monopoly exactly. I use Vimeo instead of Youtube myself for example
Really Alex Jones IMO was banned because of liability issues. The platforms don‚Äôt want to be named in lawsuits over his harmful lies. Funny that it only comes up now. How many have been hurt believing his medical conspiracies?
@CoreeGauthier The 1st amendment restricts the government from suppressing speech, not private entities. It literally says ‚Äúshall make no law‚Äù and corporations do not pass laws.
But fear not tin foil hatters. Alex Jones will likely live on &amp; may even gain more followers due to getting banned. It all plays into his hands really. It confirms some conspiracy theory I‚Äôm sure. So you can still get those water filters &amp; useless GMO free supplements
You could argue that these platforms have become monopolies of public communication but I‚Äôm not sure that holds water as there are plenty other platforms (they are just not as popular).
Facebook, Apple &amp; Youtube are private companies and can choose whom to do business with or give access to their platforms. There has been no infringement of the 1st Amendment in the Alex Jones situation.

@NotSoSerious86 Yes. We are in "swamp ass" conditions.
@NotSoSerious86 It is very humid here which makes it all worse.
@NotSoSerious86 Unless you live in Phoenix  Arizona. Then I don't think it is a heatwave unless it is over 46c for 3 days.
@NotSoSerious86 Over 37c counts as a heatwave if for longer than 3 days.
@NotSoSerious86 I'd say Germany should import some bottles but I'm sure the tariffs are too high now ;). I had to look up what 40 Celsius is in Fahrenheit....you know, because America. We are below 40 for now. We are at 35c today. Plenty of beer though
@NotSoSerious86 Oh fun. We just got out of a heatwave last week and are about to go back into another one just in time for the weekend.
@NotSoSerious86 Neat. I have a couple butterfly bushes and tried to plant some milkweed but the milkweed didn't do too well. I've been enjoying the hummingbirds that like the rest of the flowers though

@JoshMonkwords Understandable. I have enough trouble just with cats
@JoshMonkwords Somewhat related. This is a good read (super long tho) 	https://t.co/i9U2SQ2kT7
@JoshMonkwords I‚Äôve had a very close seat to journalism. Kind of like sitting too close in the theater. I know the deal. In this era where mistrust is on the rise its important to not screw up (too much). Some journalists are simply bad at their jobs. Some in every profession. It sticks out now
@JoshMonkwords I have no specific beef with journos. I‚Äôm trained in it. I married one once. Everyone has bias &amp; reporters are not immune. I applaud those who do their best to try. The blending of news &amp; opinion in cable &amp; other large news sites I feel taints the factual reporting.
@JoshMonkwords Trump obviously attacks the media in order to discredit any negative press. But the media‚Äôs behavior plays right into his hand and bolsters his bad arguments
@JoshMonkwords It won‚Äôt. Even science has its own problems with predatory journals &amp; bad studies passing peer review etc.  Just part of the human condition. I think logic &amp; media training in schools could help

@JoshMonkwords How many years of fact-free anti-gmo nonsense reported at these same outlets did we witness? They eventually turned around in face of overwhelming evidence. Nothing is different really except now a large part of the population is pointing it out
@JoshMonkwords He hasn‚Äôt disrupted anything that ad blockers &amp; Proliferation of small organizations hasn‚Äôt already disrupted. I feel most of his attacks are unfair but some of them are fairly accurate. They do it to themselves
@JoshMonkwords I just hate to see the left delve into conspiracy theory like the right disnfor the last 8 years. Sad that the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù media is helping the slide into madness

@capnmarrrrk We should all be happy he stuck around as long as he did.
@capnmarrrrk There has to be a new case challenging Roe before it can be overturned. And since Kennedy was appointed by Reagan what makes anyone think he wouldn't have overturned it if something came up before he retired?
If most of the people complaining about his retirement were around in the 80's when Reagan appointed him they would have been calling him a right-wing nazi and pushing congress to block his nomination. https://t.co/u5tGpeuMV2
