Note that Klobuchar's campaign did not release a total number of donors or an average donation during the 48 hours, which suggests there was at least a bit of #2.
So what happened? 		Some options: 		1) Klobuchar got a *huge* infusion of new donors inspired by her midwestern snowstorm announcement.		2) Klobuchar got a bunch of max-out $2,800 donations "online" to boost her total. 		3) Both #1 and #2
If *every single online donor* to Klobuchar in the last six years gave her about $26.50 in her first 48 hours, it would add up to $1 million. (The average Bernie donation in 2016 was famously about $27)		That is, to say the least, unlikely.
Data from ActBlue show that in the last six years, Klobuchar had about 37,700 online donors.		And only about 13,000 of them were donors she didn't share with another 2020 contender... https://t.co/WG5HSRtyxJ

"It's a free country man. Do what you want," Booker says of Howard Schultz's entrance into the race.		More: "I'm not running to a Republican. I'm not running to beat an independent. I'm running to unite Americans."
"We've got to get away from reflexive partisanship," Booker tells Madison on the day he enters the Democratic primary https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46
But Booker's answer reveals much of how he wants to frame his candidacy: More about big and broad unifying themes while saying as a mayor in Newark he had to actually solve things
Interesting exchange: 		Madision: Give me the top 3 policy issues that are most important to you		Booker: Says as mayor he learned not one switch to "flip" and speaks broadly of "common sense of purpose." Winds around to:		"Economic justice"	"Environmental justice"	Health care
"Today is the anniversary of the sit-in movement" in Greensboro, Booker says on the Joe Madison show.		Calls himself the "direct product" of the civil rights movement. https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46
Some Booker key staff:		Campaign manager: Addisu Demissie (via Hillary and Gavin Newsom)	Deputy manager: Jenna Lowenstein (via Hillary and Chris Murphy)	Senior adviser: Matt Klapper (his CoS)	Senior strategist: Mo Butler (ex-CoS)	Nat'l pol director: Tamia Booker (deputy CoS)
"All I've been listening to is gospel," Booker says of his playlist ahead of his announcement https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46
"We're not going to win this race by showing the worst of who we are but the best," Booker says.		This is the message he has honed in recent years: Of "radical love" and "a revival of civic grace." 		Will it work in the era of Trump?	https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46

Like Kamala Harris, Booker is skipping the exploratory step altogether. He's in. The committee is called "Cory 2020."		And the feel of his launch video suggests he wants to be on a first-name kinda basis with the electorate. https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46
Booker will be doing THREE radio interviews in the coming hour, and the shows are revealing: 		‚Äî Tom Joyner Morning Show.	‚Äî Univision‚Äôs Despierta America.	‚Äî The Black Eagle with Joe Madison		All w/ black/Latino hosts. Then he'll be on The View today, too. https://t.co/8eG7t3wf46

And that''s a wrap.
Gillibrand has more hit her stride in this second segment, outlining her rationale for running clearly.
"I don't think individuals should have super PACs," Gillibrand says (she said this earlier today in Troy.)
Gillibrand: I think we should be drawing down our troops, not only in Afghanistan but the remainder in Iraq and Syria
"I think his judgement is so wrong for the country," she says of Trump, citing Iran deal, climate change, Russia, etc.		"He's literally creating so much disruption in foreign policy he's making this country less safe," she says.
Second segment opens with her voting record voting against the most Trump nominees.
"I think it all starts with listening. You can find common ground with anyone on any issue," she says, citing her work on sexual harassment with Ted Cruz.		"Perhaps I can bring people to where I am," she says of appealing to conservative voters.
Now immigration.		"I was callous to the suffering of families who want to be with loved ones," Gillibrand says, repeating she regrets she didn't look "beyond my district."
Gillibrand telling the familiar story for her of meeting the family of someone who died by gun violence after her Senate appointment.		"Now I've been a leader on these issues," she says.
"Congratulations on your announcement," she says as she pivots to the interview.		"Tell me about the transformation."
This is a brutal intro from @Maddow: She notes Gillibrand used to say "illegal aliens," was for English-only and had an A-rating from the NRA. Now walking through her "political journey" that has taken her on "unexpected turns."
Rachel @Maddow just revealed something interesting I did not know: She has never interviewed @SenGillibrand in studio before . 		I'll keep all the news and observations on that coming interview in this thread...

And how Cuomo wraps his speech: "Let this agenda be New York's declaration of independence. We declare independence from this government's federal policies." https://t.co/1iR3li3dwK

"Let's legalize the adult use of recreational marijuana, once and for all," Cuomo says. 		He did not have this position earlier this year.

Cuomo calls for big list of voting reforms in NY:		‚Äî Make election day state holiday	‚Äî Automatic voter reg	‚Äî Vote by mail	‚Äî Early voting	‚Äî Make fed and state election days the same
NEW: Cuomo, who has raised huge sums from corporations, just called for banning all corporate contributions to any political candidates in New York.		Tells you just how much the political calculus has shifted on this issue.
Cuomo borrows the Green New Deal phrase from Ocasio-Cortez.		"New York will launch the Green New Deal," he says calling to "eliminate the state's entire carbon footprint"  eventually.
Interestingly, this line came just after he said MTA ‚Äî with multiple masters ‚Äî was "designed purposefully to diffuse political responsibility." https://t.co/U9FOhyNW5g
He calls for an MTA "revenue stream" and congestion pricing but does not speak specifically of tax revenues.
Cuomo: "This year we have to take the bull by the horns with the MTA"		The transit agency, which his appointees run,  was "designed purposefully to diffuse political responsibility" he says.
On guns, Cuomo calls for:		‚Äî Extending wait period from 3 to 10 days	‚Äî "Red flag" law	‚Äî Banning bump stocks
The first, or one of first, specific things Cuomo has named now that Democrats control full levers of gov't is cutting taxes for middle class.

Since people seem to be misconstruing this initial tweet, some extra context: https://t.co/BiKNLSucza
@joshtpm I'm not saying this is likely. I used to cover CA politics. The delegation was historically fractious. I'm saying that as a voting bloc the new CA delegation has the power to shape Democratic-only bills dramatically ‚Äî far beyond just the speakership. Not disarray. Raw power.
@neeratanden As a negotiating tactic to shape legislation? Far less likely with a Speaker Pelosi. But the tax bill hit CA particularly hard and there used to be clear reasons for regional collaboration

@Taniel @DemFromCT @NickRiccardi @Alex_Roarty IA still seems very much a swing state ‚Äî Dems picked up two of the four congressional seats this year!
@thejimhobart @Alex_Roarty @NickRiccardi @DemFromCT @RonBrownstein Amazing to think CA could recruit TWO gazillionaire candidates for governor only eight years ago...
@NickRiccardi @DemFromCT @Alex_Roarty I recall something like "The red wave stopped at the Sierras." Dems in CA picked UP seats in the state Legislature.
@NickRiccardi @DemFromCT @Alex_Roarty Though CO/CA may be our/your bias as where we were. DE Sen was epic recruitment/tea party flop.
@IanSams @NickRiccardi @Alex_Roarty Say hello to Democratic voters in some major Metropolitan areas who don't know any Trump voters!		(And even some of those who knew his support existed were hoping for a complete sweep to feel like it was squashed. Like in VA.)
@NickRiccardi @Alex_Roarty My best airport experience of the year was a bartender at FLL who was slinging $4 shots to everyone who bought a beer, and had like a shockingly high 60% success/sales rate		A veritable Red (Fireball) Wave, one might argue.
@Alex_Roarty @NickRiccardi I am always happy to yell at you, ALEX.
@DemFromCT @NickRiccardi @Alex_Roarty Those weren't the hopes of top party strategists, per se. They knew that was unlikely. But talk to rank and file Dems and activists and it was real.		Btw, I don't recall Dems winning big governorships, or much of anything, in 2010 like Rs did in 2018.
@NickRiccardi @Alex_Roarty I agree in the House this was a wave. How many Clinton-House GOP districts are even left? And Senate map heavily tilted badly for GOP from the get-go.		But my broader point is that D hopes that Trumpism would somehow be proved a one-time aberration for the country were squashed.
Hard to imagine Poizner NOT running for governor again if he wins the insurance commissioner race (he lost the 2010 GOP primary). https://t.co/5HtfLobUuV
Agree results increasingly point the D direction. 		But some of the big races that garnered the most attention in GOP column (for now): Govs in FL and GA, TX Senate. GOP kept OH and IA gov, too, even as MI, WI went to Ds.		Dems won power, not full Trump repudiation many wanted. https://t.co/eUxho4tS1D
