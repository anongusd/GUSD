Strategy used against the American people for what Dems think will be a political gain in 2020. The American people want a Border Wall, President Trump agrees with the American people.
Pelosi, Schumer and Dems don‚Äôt want to give President Trump what he promoted during his run for presidency. If they don‚Äôt agree to a border security wall, it wont get built, then they can use it against him in their campaign for 2020. ‚ÄúRead my lips no new taxes.‚Äù
