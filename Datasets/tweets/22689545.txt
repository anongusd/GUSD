@100_Disable_vet Sometimes father’s blame themselves for something that no one had any control over.  Maybe he wanted you to find out this way to ease it for you. Many times it is fear of the first reaction. Now, you’ve had your first reaction out of his view. He will tell you when he’s ready.

@captmarvel09 @JillWineBanks @Lawrence I saw that too and was super happy about it. It’s time to change 45’s buzzwords to reflect what is actually going on. Well done, @JillWineBanks   BTW, loved the #JillsPins tonight! 👖🔥
@altNOAA Exactly, it took Germany decades and I’m not sure they’ve overcome 100%

What’s to stop 45 from pardoning all just indicted from Russia? Maybe that would prove his traitorous behavior? #trumprussia #TraitorTrump #donthecon  #basta
@HonestToddler Sending love and light! ✨
45 asking Putin if he meddled in the election is stupid. He needs to ask him why. The reason that he doesn’t ask such a question is because he already knows! Putin wanted 45 to win so that he could destabilize the USA. Period. #RussianHacking #TrumpRussiaCorruption #basta

@JViscoNJ @KaitMarieox @NRATV @davidhogg111 Some might, but that is not the goal of #GunReformNow
@BarackObama How are you able to restrain your reactions to what is going on in our country? When everything you worked for is being undone and hate is being spewed daily? I look to you and your restrain to believe that we are going to be okay. You are my guide. I trust you.
@KaitMarieox @NRATV @davidhogg111 Thankfully, @davidhogg111 doesn’t play foolish games to get his message across. What an immature request. You’re falling right into the  exact persona that is expected from NRA nuts. No one wants to repeal the 2nd Amend, idiot! However, no civilian needs AR 15 guns or the like.
@MonteAJP23 @realDonaldTrump That’s because he can’t tell the truth about anything or doesn’t remember what is true and what is false anymore. So many lies! Plus, I’m sure his staff is against it. He’s such a fraud.
@realDonaldTrump I’m sure you will throw it in every once in a while. I don’t think you can help yourself. Please be kind to our allies, we need them!

Yet, the GOP is in the process of promoting an accused child molester to the same office Franken is being asked to resign from. Makes no sense to me.

Why should @alfranken resign while the GOP is promoting a child molester for election to the very place that Franken is being asked to leave? Of course, what Franken did was wrong, but he at least admitted to it and apologized. No such actions from #NoMoore and #DumpTrump SICK!

@Acosta He’s so embarrassing. Why is he speaking at the SKNA telling them what is happening in NK? Dude, they know! This is not knew.
He embarrasses me. I️ never worried about every word that came out of Obama’s mouth. This dude? Every. Damn. Time!
@Acosta Why does South Korea care about your lies about what you’ve done? @realDonaldTrump
@Acosta Seems like he has been told that he has to stay on task. Get ready to hear how presidential be was. Blah!
@realDonaldTrump Wow! Maybe you should take your magical support and keep backing the Republicans. The Dems thank you! #kryptonite #DemsWininVA
@NBCNews @alivitali Did he think he was safe in Asia to avoid questions about the US? Idiot! Keep asking the questions.
@NBCNews @alivitali So he chose not to answer the question. Extreme vetting for gun safety doesn’t take the gun out of the man’s hands that shot the killer.

When someone from a different nationality kills people #travelban, but, when an American kills, it’s too political to talk about #GunControl
@SenTedCruz it is not a political issue, it’s a safety issue. Sounds like the citizen was not mentally unstable, the shooter was.
Communities should not have to keep coming together because of awful laws to protect them? #Texans are amazing. #gunsafety
We must find a way to come together to work toward #gunsafety. This should not be a partisan issue. It’s a human safety issue.
Let’s change the talking points from “gun control” to “gun safety!” We need to get on the same page and work to a safer goal. #massshootings
@KeithOlbermann I️ agree, it really sucks!
@Acosta Then why did he have guns? He should have had no access to guns if he had a mental illness.

How do the reporters sit there with a straight face during his attacks on them? @cnnbrk
RT @POTUS_Don45: So we are clear, the debate questions being given to Hillary are the equivalent of Russia handing me the election.
RT @jonlovett: For those keeping score:	Leaks: REAL	News: FAKE	Good polls: REAL	Bad polls: FAKE	Wikileaks: REAL	Things I say: DUNNO, SOMEON…
@realDonaldTrump Just embarrassing. STFU about ratings. Nobody else cares. My neck hurts from shaking my head so much right now.
RT @LOLGOP: If Trump just showed us his penis it couldn't be less gross than him using the White House to verbally pee on America.
Leaks are only illegal if they happen to you, 45? Election was full of leaks &amp; you didn't seem to have a problem with that! @realDonaldTrump
I'm starting to think that 45's perception of large is off. I mean he thinks his hands are large too. So crowd size is relative, I guess.

RT @GeorgeTakei: We need some extreme vetting of our own with these Trump appointees and cabinet picks. Let's start with Bannon. #BanBannon
Why is Trump making his Supreme Court finalists go to DC for the "big announcement." This is not a game show. WTF? #resist
RT @BernieSanders: The American people want real change, a change based on compassion and justice, not hatred, intolerance and divisiveness.
Kids in the future will be so confused by the Trump era. I just wish I could read ahead to see when it all stops. #resist #nomuslimban
