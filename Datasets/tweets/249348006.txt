15 governors and the American Medical Association have voiced their opposition to the policy. It‚Äôs clear Trump‚Äôs move will harm public health. We must #SaveTitleX
The Trump Administration is pushing a reckless policy that threatens essential Title X health care services by limiting the providers who can participate in the program. This will severely restrict Americans from accessing basic health care.
Title X funding provides access to essential services, including breast &amp; cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control, STI tests, family planning services and other critically important healthcare services for 4 million Americans, with not one cent used to fund abortions

The PREEMIE Act, my legislation that became law in 2006, expanded research, education and intervention efforts to reduce preterm births and improve treatment for premature infants and their mothers. This important law was allowed to expire last September.
Today, one in ten babies are born prematurely which puts them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems.
November is Prematurity Awareness Month, a national initiative to raise awareness about the crisis of preterm births in our country. For the first time in almost a decade, the rate of preterm births began rising in the United States in 2015.

Congress must move quickly to protect the Special Counsel from any obstruction so the American people get the full truth of Russia‚Äôs interference in our national election and any crimes the President may have committed.
In the face of mounting criminal evidence against the President and his inner circle, the likelihood the President will interfere in the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation to prevent more evidence from coming to light increases every day.

Now the agency must address the fallout of this crisis by reuniting these families, and while HHS was not responsible for the separations, the agency must be held accountable to reunite them promptly.
When the President announced his policy that has separated nearly 3,000 children from their families, HHS was thrust into the middle of implementing this disastrous policy.

The 14th Amendment guarantees full citizenship, due process and ‚Äúequal protection of the laws‚Äù to all Americans &amp; has provided the constitutional basis for school desegregation, voting rights, reproductive rights, same-sex marriage &amp; many other pillars of justice in our society.
Today marks the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which enshrined our nation‚Äôs founding principles of equality and fundamental rights for all citizens in the supreme law of the land.
Good riddance.
During his tenure at EPA, Scott Pruitt put the interests of polluters &amp; industry over the health &amp; environment of our country while amassing a long list of unethical undertakings that prompted numerous investigations of his conduct, including wasteful spending of taxpayer funds.

#NetNeutrality protections have advanced competition &amp; innovation, created more startups &amp; entrepreneurs, like the ones I met with in my Congressional District in June. Repealing these protections is an assault on what has made the internet what it is‚Ä¶ an open &amp; dynamic platform https://t.co/iL5vUcdIvJ
Overturning #NetNeutrality rules means that big companies could choose what websites and applications we see online, not us. The largest ISPs will have the power to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.
The current #NetNeutrality rules are simple: They prevent your broadband provider from blocking or throttling lawful content online. https://t.co/x1drPIvjno
This move by @AjitPaiFCC brings no #NetNeutrality rules with it. None. It bucks 22 years of consensus under Republican and Democratic FCC chairmen that Americans have a right to access all legal content and the FCC has a duty to enforce that right.		https://t.co/JWWs2sFg2S
Even as millions of Americans have voiced their support for a free and open internet, @AjitPaiFCC is determined to unravel all #NetNeutrality protections TOMORROW.
