@MegynTODAY  is an ass. She no longer practices true Journalism rather a yellow one
@MegynTODAY has NO credibility, no critical thinking skills, and no class.
@MegynTODAY is so ignorant it’s so unfortunate I won’t be surprised if she has accepted the Islam ideology
Islam is an ideology, not a religion. They may try to make a religion out of it, but it is no different than fascism or communism.. They don’t believe in God, only Allah, who is what, a purveyor or hate and brutality?
@MegynTODAY is a arrogant spoiled snot nosed brat. She is all about the money that she makes, and dressing in short skirts, I can no longer take her snotty face! DONE
@MegynTODAY has her head shoved so far up her own ass and has 4 so long that she cant even smell the shit spewing out of her mouth, and actually believes that people other than brainwashed billionaires and uneducated hillbillies take her seriously.
@MegynTODAY is defender of all that is evil and untrue in this world. She is blinded by her Hindenburg sized ego to the fact that the only reason she is allowed to remain on the air is because she is serving the small percentage of people who have robbed the rest of the country,
@MegynTODAY is a dumb bitch. She is also a hypocrite and an ignorant close minded completely oblivious succubus. She deserves to have everything she owns burned and destroyed, then to be mugged and left for dead on the street in the worst neighborhood in the U.S
@JudgeJeanine a  longtime loser that was repeatedly rejected by NY voters during her inept attempts  4 Lt Gov, U.S. Sen and NY ST AG. After those repeated rejections where does a disgraced former county judge and loser lawyer go 2 for a job? The Fox News Comedy Network of course!

To my knowledge, not ONE person has been prosecuted for relying on the written law as expressed in section 861 of the tax code, and has paid the least amount or taxes owed ­ ZERO!
Legally paying zero federal income taxes is the most patriotic thing an American can do.
"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power."Alexander Hamilton 1775
Our wages from work were never taxed. That was part of our right to life and liberty. The Constitution protected us against that type of taxation by stating that direct taxes, such as what would be on your wages, must be apportioned. The 16th Amendment did not change that.

Patriotism is easy to understand in America. It means looking out for yourself by looking out for your country.--- Calvin Coolidge
Every day I get up and look through the Forbes list of the richest people in America. If I'm not there, I go to work.--- Robert Orben
The largest party in America, by the way, is neither the Democrats nor the Republicans.It's the party of non-voters.---- Robert Reich
America is at that awkward stage; it's too late to work within the system, but too early to shoot the bastards.--- Claire Wolfe
Every community in America should give all parents a voucher equal to what it now pays per-pupil for its public schools, allowing those parents to use those vouchers at any school they choose. Let the market decide if government-run schools survive.
The second greatest problem is that the political power controlling these government-run schools has become increasingly centralized, gradually removing decision-making from local communities, passing it up to the state and federal level.
The greatest problem with primary and secondary education in America today is precisely that it is dominated by government-run schools that people are compelled by force of law to pay for whether they like them or not and whether they send their children there or not.
We should aim for a society where children spend more time with their most important teachers, their parents, and less time with the less important teachers at their school.
County by county, state by state, Americans should begin functionally abolishing government-run schools and replacing them with a free market in schools. On the federal level, Congress should kill the Department of Education by choking off its funding.
Educators should not be compelled to meet the demands of educational bureaucrats and politicians. They should be free to meet the demands of the market.
Parents should not be forced to subject their children to ideas they find immoral. They should be free to select schools that teach the ideas and values they advocate.
Non-parents should not be forced to pay for the education of children who are not their own. If they so desire, they are free to provide financial assistance to anyone they choose.
A privatized educational system gives parents and students meaningful choices. And it respects the moral right of each individual to act on his own judgment.
For decades, politicians and educators have suggested an endless stream of “reforms.” Yet, the performance of our schools continues to decline. It is time to truly allow supply and demand into education. It is time to abolish public schools.

MERRY MITHRAMAS AND HAPPY WINTER SOLSTICE
December 25th was really the date, not of the birth of Jesus, but of the sun-god Mithra. Horus, son of Isis, however, was in very early times identified with Ra, the Egyptian sun-god, and hence with Mithra.
"Christianity took a leaf out of the devil's book when it fixed the birth of the Saviour on the December 25."
The Koran is one of the most stubborn enemies of Civilization, Liberty, and the Truth which the world has yet known.-----William Muir

Abortion violates the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution..
I vigorously resist the attempt by any government agency to nullify or reduce earned benefits to veterans and their survivors, including but not limited to, compensation, pensions, education, and health care.
I stand firmly against the proposals for a “Pathway to Citizenship/Comprehensive Immigration Reform/Amnesty” that come out of Washington.
I reject the notion that the Supreme Court’s decisions are binding as law beyond those parties to whom the case pertained. Activist Judges should be impeached, as permissible by the Constitution
Social Security is a form of individual welfare not authorized in the Constitution
The federal government’s only responsibility in preventing drug abuse is to control our borders. Drugs are a state issue.
Despite the good Trump did at first, such as nominating Neil Gorsuch and passing an executive order which crippled executive regulations, he has since become just another neoconservative.
Despite Trump’s promises to put America First, Trump protected ISIS from Assad by bombing Syria in April. He signed knowingly unconstitutional sanctions against Russia. And don’t you dare even consider cutting foreign aid.
Trump ran a campaign against politics and he won. But as soon as he made it into office, he didn’t drain the swamp. He drowned himself in it when he appointed people like Jeff Sessions, Steve Mnuchin, and Elaine Chao (the wife of Mitch McConnell, the King of the Swamp).
Single Payer Healthcare is Slavery

Raising taxes is what politicians do when they don’t have the strength to actually govern
Any action by a president — executive order, signing statement, proclamation, etc. — that is enforced on the people as if it were law, is no law at all. Any attempt by a president or any executive branch agency to enforce that law is the act of a tyrant.
If a president were to sign a bill into law that is not made in pursuance of the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution, then he violates his oath.
