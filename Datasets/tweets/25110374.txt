Q7. Hello @Release_Drugs in the UK! How can we get involved with or support your work?
@OpenSociety @Release_drugs A6. Leaving the experience, it‚Äôll become more clear on what the priorities should be when we talk about drug use and possession.
@OpenSociety @Release_drugs A6.  I want everyone in the UK to go and take their friends and family to #DrugPolicyMuseum on Nov. 3-5. It will open your hearts + minds.
@OpenSociety A6. We need to follow the lead of organizations like @Release_Drugs, the UK's national centre of expertise on drugs and drugs law.
@OpenSociety A6. We all need to wake up. There's an UK drug overdose crisis. 1 in 3 drug overdoses in Europe happens in the UK. #DrugPolicyMuseum
A6. It‚Äôs profound what @OpenSociety has done to take the #DrugPolicyMuseum from New York to Montreal and now to London. https://t.co/drpXZotNsi
Come awaken Your Curiosity South Africa!! I'm looking forward to seeing you! #Libertyvukasummit! https://t.co/6PXQsdZdCH
A5. Incredible...from the art to the speakers. I‚Äôd never seen a museum dedicated to drug policy with incredible art + powerful programs. https://t.co/VQYbz5vWgH
A4. Second, we need to understand that current drug policies are ruining lives. And policy should be about creating a better society.
A4. Most of us know someone who‚Äôs incarcerated on drug charges. This has to be a global commitment to decriminalize + reduce harm. https://t.co/C1smkub8At
A3. Look at the numbers. In 2016, out of 19,766 federal drug cases, 50% were Latino + 23.6% Black according to U.S. Sentencing Commission.
A3. To keep it real, black &amp; brown people have been disproportionately impacted-from incarceration to lack of health services for recovery. https://t.co/WS4oKVJrBg
A2. However, the US must must learn from models from around the world that are working, like safe injection facilities + needle exchanges.
A2. I have always believed that drug use is a health issue, and that we cannot incarcerate our way out of this problem. We must change.
A2. The shift in policy with regards to opioids was done by Obama. However, the problem remains under Trump. #DrugPolicyMuseum https://t.co/AEa7AnhpAq
A1. Bad drug policy has destroyed the fabric of the black community in the US and poor communities around the world.
A1. I‚Äôve worked my entire life to change drug laws in the US. I also recognize there are so many bad drug laws worldwide. #DrugPolicyMuseum https://t.co/80Ny3PQJI5

@POTUS @Kaepernick7 You‚Äôre putting ALL Americans at risk to fulfill your racist and narcissistic agenda. Being reckless is not part of the job description.
@POTUS @Kaepernick7 #POTUSDoYourJob and correct your unpatriotic behavior fueled by your unhealthy obsession with NK. American lives are at stake.

@POTUS Your bigoted remarks are only creating more solidarity against hatred. The winner is @Kaepernick7 for reminding us that Black Lives Matter.
Great job @POTUS for distracting us this weekend by insulting and making NFL players seem unpatriotic for exercising freedom of speech.

@CrownHeightsMOV @matt_ruskin If you are in NYC, go see #CrownHeights this weekend! We must support films that tell the stories of our people!  https://t.co/58Reazscei
@CrownHeightsMOV The incredible @Matt_Ruskin wrote + directed #CrownHeights, a film about Colin + his best friend Carl King who fought for his freedom.
@CrownHeightsMOV Colin Warner was a victim of this era and sacrificed 20 yrs of his life behind bars for a crime that he didn't commit. He was from Brooklyn.
@CrownHeightsMOV The "tough on crime" era began with terrible racist policies that led to horrible policing that destroyed the fabric of the black community.
@CrownHeightsMOV We all knew a guy who got railroaded by the system. Everyone in the hood knew he didn't do it, but the cops and the DA got a conviction.
@CrownHeightsMOV In Hollis, almost every one I grew up either got sent away on some drug charge for decades or ended up dead. But we all knew a Colin Warner.
@CrownHeightsMOV For far too many of us, who grew up in black and brown communities, we all know a Colin Warner. Someone who got locked up for far too long.
@CrownHeightsMOV A criminal justice system deeply rooted in institutional racism, archaic sentencing laws + a war on drugs that decimated black communities.
His name is Colin Warner. He spent 20 yrs in prison for a crime he didn't do. A victim of a broken criminal justice system. #CrownHeights https://t.co/P68yvmWLke

The most powerful step in realizing your potential is simply to be present in the world.
People are always waiting for something to happen in their personal lives before they can be happy #appreciatenow
We've come to accept that the self-centered, egotistical person will get more out of life. But for such people happiness proves elusive.
Stillness is the fertile soil in which imagination is nourished, and ideas can grow to incredible heights.

Meditation is a discipline; you have to practice it.
Maintain your mind.
When you let the noise distract you, it becomes very easy to move through life thinking, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just the way I am.‚Äù
The world is perfect. Until you slow down and access the stillness inside of you, sometimes it's hard to see that perfection.
The older we get the more critical people become when we tap into our inherent creativity because that is where our good ideas come from.
No matter how hectic your life might be feeling, understand that the best thing you can be doing at that time is to simply be still.

G-d willing, see you on the front lines, Mr. President.
...and marches about our fears. But as terrified as many of us are, we are more terrified to go into our future without you.
Many Americans are afraid of what the future holds. Most of us have collectively ‚Äî and loudly ‚Äî spoken out on social media, in rallies...
As I am sure you agree, are all called to do service and that calling does not end until we die.
There will always be a need to promote fairness, justice and opportunity for the under-served surrounding issues far too many to list here.
...my prayer is for you to continue to use your influence to bring out the best in all of us.
Though we would never imagine you would use your power to do anything else but continue to serve the people...
... and choose a path of righteousness wherever it is obvious and clear.
I am banking on the fact that you are talented and persuasive enough to influence the incoming regime to follow their better angels...
Your presidency embodied the connection that weaves between all living beings.
...with the same aspirations, hopes and desires for ourselves and our children.
I pray we can call on you to take on the roles as a negotiator and bridge-builder. I have to believe at our very core we are ALL the same...
Fortunately, there are millions of other Americans ‚Äî led by the younger generation ‚Äî ready to fill that role.
Speaking on behalf of your beloved Americans, we nominate you. We don‚Äôt need you to lead the resistance.

What‚Äôs to become of the movement against environmental racism/classism that is being waged against the black, brown and poor white...
Who stop the militarization of police forces and build bridges between police and community?
Who will help dismantle the prison industrial complex?
Who will stop the government from giving 100s of billions of taxpayer dollars to exploit and poison the people and destroy the environment?
...global warming, soil erosion, water pollution, rain forest loss and world hunger?
...as a real and growing threat against our very survival as a species? Who will recognize animal agriculture as a leading contributor...
Healthy food at public schools? Who will protect the environment by recognizing and raising awareness about the crisis of climate change...
Who will make sure every American has access to affordable healthcare? Who will make sure our youth have proper educations?
Who will look after us now? Who will support sanctuary cities for immigrants?
...and our hero during a time that has us bracing to accept the reality of the most untested and erratic President-elect in history.
...inspiration and excitement for the future. Now here we are, eight years later, and we are saying goodbye to our rock, our protector...
Next thing I knew, I found myself sitting in the cold, choking back tears, watching you being sworn in, feeling waves of pride...
It was my pleasure to go on the road for you from city to college campus, to lend my voice to the best of my ability to your campaign.
other politician I had met before you. It was then that I signed on to support your run.
Shortly thereafter I realized that your sincerity and honest intention to make America a better country was at a higher caliber than any...

We spoke about the issues surrounding the poor, the under-served and the forgotten and how to help them. Your words were thoughtful...
I never considered myself a politically savvy person, though at that time I had worked for at least 7 democratic presidential campaigns.
You answered me in a way that showed that you knew instinctively what was right for you and what would resonate with the people.

At the time, in 2008, I was supporting Dennis Kucinich because I felt a lot of his ideas should be brought to the big stage. I remember we..
Years later, I met you at a rally in Chicago and then again at a friend‚Äôs house as you were planning your run for the presidency.
The first time I met you was when you were still an Illinois State Senator and you joined us at one of our hip-hop summits.
Lots of times I pray when I am at a loss. I don‚Äôt know where to begin so I guess I will begin at the beginning...
It seems like a small gesture given all the good you have done for America and the hope you infused into the consciousness of our nation.
Dear President Obama,		First, I want to offer my highest gratitude and deepest appreciation for your unprecedented service to our country.
My prayer of gratitude for President Obama...
