If Trump gets away with his National Emergency declaration. The Republican Party will have completed the overthrow of the government. He would be able to bypass Congress on everything. He would be able to suspend elections. @TheDemocrats @TheDemCoalition @SpeakerPelosi
@TheDemCoalition There is a manufactured event at the border. The national emergency will exist if trump is allowed to get away with this. His next step will be to suspend elections. This is part of the Republican plan to seize power.
@peaceandteachin @TeamPelosi He does not have the capacity to understand.

@DearAuntCrabby Oh Hell yes I am. I'm ashamed of you for being you. I'm ashamed of the Americans that voted for you. I'm ashamed of the Republican party for supporting you.
@ProudResister Trouble is that we are butchering ourselves over it. Everyone has done something or said something in the last 30 + years that they are ashamed of. So what. If the behavior hasn't continued. It's a non issue.

Republican hypocrisy. https://t.co/GpIiVoQtIq
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The 2009 numbers belong to another Republican, George Bush. Facts just do not matter to you. 2009 is the very beginning of President Obama's term. 2019 is two years into trumps occupation. Do a fact check next time Ronna.
