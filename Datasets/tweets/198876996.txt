@PatrickZircher If it’s ever done correctly I’d be the first to applaud. But I think you’ve got to start with everyone fearing him and him being like wtf are these powers I’m a kid from Kansas. I’d love to see All Star Superman adapted.
@PatrickZircher Also Spider-Man is not Superman. Also I could discuss this forever!
@PatrickZircher Superman is more than any other comic book character born of a very different time that doesn’t translate. I just don’t think sunny optimism would ever play with a modern audience. If studio execs ever had the vision to let the best comic book Superman stories be adapted, maybe.
@PatrickZircher @BittrScrptReadr It’s the only way to make an all powerful character interesting or compelling. Of course humankind would be terrified or at least skeptical of him. That being said, Snyder obviously didn’t stick the landing.

@philewing And here’s the 4th and final part that just posted: https://t.co/vwimmEnOFO
5: Part 4 looks at the bruising optempo the Fitz faced when it returned to the sea in early 2017. No time for training and it almost immediately took on missions with a crew that was mostly new. But at the end of the day, they still saved their ship: https://t.co/vwimmEnOFO
4: Part 3 focuses on how vital radars were not working on the Fitz, and how some sailors on board didn't even know how to use them correctly. It speaks to the question of how this could happen to a state-of-the-art U.S. destroyer: https://t.co/pXzuFcHqRS
3: Part 2 chronicles the chaos and panic on the bridge as the hulking merchant vessel bore down on the warship that was trying to cross a maritime superhighway. Also looks at the poor command climate and low morale among the very tired sailors: https://t.co/sUQ489P2V2
2: Part 1 exposes the details of a near-miss just five weeks before, how junior officers regularly disobeyed their COs orders, how many officers didn't know basic seamanship and other things. Read here: https://t.co/DljkZZE70x
1: We obtained an internal investigation into 2017's fatal collision of the warship Fitzgerald and wrote a 4-part series. The report presents a much grimmer picture of the state of affairs for the ship and its crew than Navy brass has acknowledged. All 4 parts are linked below.

Publicly released accounts of the Fitz disaster state the warship was performing routine operations at the time of the collision		But Fort’s internal report shows how grueling life had become for the crew and throughout the Japan-based 7th Fleet.
The officer of the deck on the Fitzgerald ran out onto the ship's bridge wing as the Crystal neared. Collision was imminent. "Oh shit," she said. "I'm so fucked." 		This story also looks at the morale crisis on board and more. Other stories to come.

Why this happened and who was responsible will likely never be known as the AF throws away such records after two years.
The prop blade that failed had gone through a @usairforce maintenance depot in 2011, but for some reason, the workers there did not fix the blade's corrosion and sent it back to the fleet unrepaired.
Last summer, a @USMC KC-130T plane crashed in Mississippi, killing 15 Marines and a sailor. The cause was a deteriorating propeller blade, which snapped off its engine and set off a horrific cataclysm. @ValerieInsinna and I got a copy of the report: https://t.co/h40ACaJxXd
