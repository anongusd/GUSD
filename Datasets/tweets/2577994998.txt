69/76 forgetting there's a lot more of us than there are of you and if, despite your complete and utter incompetence, you do @giarcima
68/76 that will be the deathnail in the GOP's COFFIN &amp; I have a long dreamed of that! And fortunately I'm not alone! you keep @giarcima
67/76 pass i'll actually be relieved in fact there's a part of me that WANTS YOU TO! HELL, I DARE YOU TO! because when you do, @giarcima
66/76 there's anyway you can lie cheat or buy The necessary votes to R&amp;R the ACA you're going to do it and so if it comes to @giarcima
65/76 stupid people and so you'll go online and maybe convince some of them. But here's the part that will shock you I know if @giarcima
64/76 people STILL SUPPORT THAT IDIOT USURPER TO THE WHITE HOUSE It goes without saying that there are a lot of really really @giarcima
63/76 horrific deal with the devil is SO OBVIOUS that only the dumbest most mindless idiots believe otherwise &amp; since 46% of the @giarcima
62/76 sure you know that I'm onto you, and if I'm on to you, a whole a lot of other people are on to you too &amp; in fact your @giarcima
61/76 Oh I know you'll NEVER ADMIT IT you'll go on LYING YOUR STUPID TRANSPARENT LIE like you always do but I just want to make @giarcima
60/76 OBVIOUSLY A PURELY BLATANT MONEY GRAB for YOU &amp; all those wealthy friends who've bought and paid for you CORRUPT SOULS!! @giarcima
59/76 and no doubt pad your pockets with some of their very ILL-GOTTEN GAINS! so let's cut the bullshit shall we? this is SO @giarcima
58/76 if God forbid you get your way you're going to feel great about your accomplishment! Your owners will be thrilled with you @giarcima
57/76 life-saving medical care. And all of that is on you but I know this about you you don't care you will sleep at night and @giarcima
56/76 will have to watch their children die because even if they starve themselves they still won't be able to afford @giarcima
55/76 their children BECAUSE OF YOUR REPREHENSIBLE PROMISE! But even worse there will be countless thousands if not millions who @giarcima
54/76 my heart and I can see so many mothers &amp; fathers who will be forced to make similar sacrifices, who would do anything for @giarcima
53/76 ate there fill my grandmother would go around the table and eat what was left on their plates! this story is always broken @giarcima
52/76 children were fed but my mother remembers there was never a plate for my grandmother. Instead, after all of her children @giarcima
51/76 just how thin she'll get! My grandmother had 10 children and they were very poor but somehow she always made sure her @giarcima
50/76 heartless and cruel actions will force her to choose between food on her table and medicine for her baby? oh you'll see @giarcima
49/76 they don't care how many millions of people will suffer for it but you can't be too thin with the mother that your @giarcima
48/76 say one can never be too rich or too thin well apparently those friends of yours believe they can never be too rich and @giarcima
47/76 donors, your corporate overlords, all those CORRUPT lobbyists &amp; ALL your other fat cat friends you're so beholden to! They @giarcima
46/76 you're definitely desperate to keep your promise to those rich friends of yours! You know, those deep pocketed campaign @giarcima
45/76 YOU MADE TO YOUR RICH FRIENDS TO MAKE THEM EVEN RICHER (and it's probably not going to hurt your bottom line either) yes @giarcima
44/76 AMERICAN LIVES, you are STILL HELLBENT ON THIS UNFORGIVABLE, DESPICABLE ACT TO KEEP A PROMISE ALRIGHT BUT ITS A PROMISE @giarcima
43/76 KEEP NO MATTER THE COST IN HUMAN LIFE AND DESPITE THE UNQUESTIONABLY DEVASTATING IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON MILLIONS OF @giarcima
42/76 but it's DEFINITELY NOT THE PROMISE YOU MADE AD NAUSEAM to your constituents, no the promise you are DESPERATELY TRYING TO @giarcima
41/76 to your constituents, and in fact all of the evidence points to the fact that you're doing it to keep a promise all right, @giarcima
40/76 likely the correct one, and that is you are lying when you say you want to repeal and replace the ACA to keep your promise @giarcima
39/76 this scale is way out of balance and so in accordance with the principle of Occam's razor, the most obvious answer is most @giarcima
38/76 surgeon will NEVER GET ACCESS TO ONE! but I digress now where was I? oh yes! it doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that @giarcima
37/76 two things don't balance out! (which is funny since you're trying to make sure millions of people who may need a brain @giarcima
36/76 your reasons to repeal and replace the ACA. in fact it's so obvious that it doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that these @giarcima
35/76 clear for all to see, This truth scale is way way out of balance which leads to only one conclusion you are lying about @giarcima
34/76 NAUSEATINGLY OBVIOUS LIE that you're doing it to "fulfill your promise to your constituents" well now the results are @giarcima
33/76 literally kill people and destroy COUNTLESS LIVES and on The other side of the scale I'll put your CONSTANTLY REPEATED @giarcima
32/76 do, against the reason you CLAIM you're willing to do it.. so on one side of the scale we put your willingness to @giarcima
31/76 excuse! so now I'm going to weigh the facts and see if this truth scale balances out! let's weigh what you're willing to @giarcima
30/76 GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL!) All of whom are literally BEGGING YOU NOT TO R&amp;R the ACA yet you STILL persist with this lame @giarcima
29/76 didn't, and would NEVER, vote for you but for whom YOU FAIL TO REALIZE YOU'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR AS AN ELECTED @giarcima
28/76 YOU THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS and DESPERATELY WANT TO KEEP THE ACA! (Not to mention all the in other Americans who @giarcima
27/76 false premise that you're trying to keep a promise to your constituents, constituents who have LOUDLY &amp; REPEATEDLY TOLD @giarcima
26/76 or paying for life-sustaining surgery or medication! you're willing to destroy countless lives on the very transparently @giarcima
25/76 LITERALLY KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE! you're obviously COMPLETELY FINE with making a parent choose between feeding their children @giarcima
24/76 the medicine to ease their pain and suffering, or help them fight off debilitating illnesses, or medications that @giarcima
23/76 care if babies die because their parents can't afford life-saving surgery or people with chronic illnesses can't afford @giarcima
22/76 willing to literally kill countless numbers of Americans by taking away their health care coverage and you clearly don't @giarcima
21/76 even TRYING to make it look like a healthcare bill! But the most obvious tell in your abhorrent deception is that you're @giarcima
20/76 PRETEND 2B a healthcare bill! It's so transparently a tax cut for your rich CRONIES that it was almost as if you weren't @giarcima
19/76 There's yet ANOTHER BLATANT TELL IN YOUR LIE! (I told you it was obvious) and THAT's YOUR REPLACEMENT BILL doesn't even @giarcima
18/76 his promise, the only promise he'll have kept I might add, to kill the ACA once and for all. But wait, there's more! @giarcima
17/76 undermined and sabotaged the ACA, and because Trump is as corrupt and black hearted as you both are he will probably keep @giarcima
16/76 president's help you may finally see your dream of millions of Americans losing their healthcare ! Yes, because you have @giarcima
15/76 "death spiral" would in fact come to pass! you certainly worked hard enough to make sure it did! and now with that fake @giarcima
14/76 was also filled with REPEATEDLY DEBUNKED LIES and constant attempts to make sure that your claims of the ACA's so-called @giarcima
13/76 you persist in this ridiculous claim that you're doing it because you made a promise to them, never mind that that promise @giarcima
12/76 know ALL OF THIS because you've been inundated by messages from your constituents, as have all members of the GOP, and yet @giarcima
11/76 and that healthcare is truly a right and not a privilege for only those who can afford it! But U know that you already @giarcima
10/76 see through your constant attempts to undermine it they realized the TRUTH-that it has made a great impact on their lives @giarcima
9/76 realize how much they needed, and wanted to keep the ACA but once they quit listening to your incessant lies and began to @giarcima
8/76 you claim you're keeping this solemn vow, have changed their mind about the ACA! Oh sure it's took a while for them to @giarcima
7/76 another tell in your big LIE is,as previously stated, your constituents don't want you to do it! The very people for whom @giarcima
6/76 would not only be the most reasonable &amp; logical course of action but also the least DESTRUCTIVE &amp; DEVASTATING path. And @giarcima
5/76 whatever problems it has can be fixed with a bipartisan effort which, if you didn't have a nefarious ulterior motive, @giarcima
4/76 is that it has been repeatedly proven that the ACA is not only extremely popular with the majority of Americans but that @giarcima
3/76 CALLING BULLüí©! WE ALL KNOW WHY &amp; WHO YOU'RE REALLY DOING IT FOR It's 2PayOFF YOUR RICH CRONIES! What makes it SO OBVIOUS @giarcima
