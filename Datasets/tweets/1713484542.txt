@ClintonMSix141 @CPachello @realDonaldTrump Trump admitted to making up this lie.  It is called birtherism and is old history.  Trump admitted to it in one of the last debates because the press already figured out he started the lie and he did admit to it.  He hated Obama for being black and wanted to hurt him.
@ClintonMSix141 @CPachello @realDonaldTrump Trump admitted that he started a rumor about Obama and his birth certificate.  He did this during one of his last debates with Clinton because the news reporters had already find out that Trump lied.  He admitted it at the debate.  It was all made up by Trump.
