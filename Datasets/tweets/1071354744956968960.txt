@ogonna_blessing You are doing self petty because that man does not reason that way he has only one thing to fulfill and that is, Northerner are majority hence they should occupy every sensitive positions.
@Valentinefire_ @atiku Cow
@daily_trust More news
@daily_trust Shame on those who voted for Buhari
@GirlishLava Nobody but the law itself
@MobilePunch You cannot continue helping somebody who does not willing to free his or herself from those who caused their suffering.
@daily_trust Fantastic
@BarcaTimes The most painful award ever seen
@daily_trust Oh what a wonderful news next level
RT @renoomokri: WATCH the moment the people’s President, @Atiku, said:		“I, Atiku Abubakar, reject the results declared by the @INECNigeria…
@atiku @SpokesManAtiku Sir I am with you on the course of defending our democracy but Sir, I most say,  that we failed to utilize the opportunity when the APC and president Buhari threw in the towel. We had the needed supports home and abroad but did not use it.
@ogundamisi @raufaregbesola @fkeyamo @MsTyma_ @hadisirika @icoverarewa @Djah_snk @stephhegarty In 2023 SS,  SE will definitely vote for a Northerner.
@abulude @ogundamisi @PeterObi @AsoRock @atiku @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo You never start to preach
@thecableng Fantastic
@Iameerah90 But despite your bragging you remain our shoe mender and nails gutter.
@MallamEzera I am from Ibibio tribe the majority tribe in Akwa Ibom state,  SS Nigeria, the SW believes they are so loved by the Northerners thus they have a chance to win in 2023, but I know for sure a Northerner is gonna contest and my vote will be for him. By God grace
#Northerners God keeps me alive in 2023 my vote is for a Northerner. It would be a pay back time for the SW.
@channelstv Damn you
@renoomokri @glamzy059 @atiku I still want a better off Nigeria than what we have now under Buhari #HighlyAtikulatd.
RT @renoomokri: Dear @Glamzy059,		Thanks for your message of hope. This is beyond @Atiku. It is about Nigeria. Atiku is a supporting actor…
@ogundamisi @PeterObi @AsoRock @atiku @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo 2023 is not pretty much far, the SS and SE will remember the SW. Because as for me my vote God keeps me alive and many others will be for a northerner.
@renoomokri @MBuhari In other places in the world, we witness strong opposition with a strong leadership leading the course to change a bad government. These opposition will be in the streets with massive numbers of the masses until they attract the attention of the whole world.
@renoomokri @MBuhari What I don't like is when you have opportunity and you failed to use it. The APC/Buhari thrown in the towel but the PDP failed to used it against them. PDP failed to leverage on the chances availed to them through the APC actions and inactions.
#Borno from now henceforth, I have no business in praying for peace in Borno state because they are very much okay with the present situation. They are in paradise more than we us here from south.
@uche_ezeonye May they want extermination
@channelstv I blame PDP for allowing that to happened
What I know is that, in other places in the world where zeal and will to fight against tyranny and feudalism happens, the opposition leaders are always on the street to demonstrate against the tyrant and his tyrannic utterances.
@MBuhari Oh what an amazing and befitting place for you to dwell and take charge.
@PdpAkwaIbom Look at how uncommon man turns to  uncommon coward
@PdpAkwaIbom @UN @UNHumanRights @EU_Commission @OfficialPDPNig @USEmbassyAbuja @HQNigerianArmy @DefenceInfoNG @AmnestyNigeria @TonyeBarcanista @PoliceNG War saw war saw
@MobilePunch He has license to thief
@OfficialPDPNig @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg We are moving forward to the gold
@thesignalng @MBuhari This man signs the "peace Accord" some days ago but said this today " Mr integrity " LOl.
@renoomokri @atiku @MBuhari I wonder what kind of person is Buhari
@daily_trust Vote finished and remain there
@GuardianNigeria In Jonathan days, prior to election days there was no bombing, election held in all places in Nigeria but now look at this.
#BetterNigeria I am ready to vote for Atiku some few hours from here
@toluogunlesi Poverty syndrome
@MrUdomEmmanuel Ette sosongho
@MrUdomEmmanuel @OfficialPDPNig Ette sosongho
@MrAkanOkon Well done Sir! We are proud having you as one of those who tries in putting immense effort in making Akwa Ibom projects to be seen around the globe. Thanks and may the good Lord continue to strengthening you to do more.
#IbomAir thank God Udom Emmanuel is my governor. I most confess that the state is bless for always having visionary leaders since 1999 till date. These three, Attah, Akpabio and Udom are great people.
#IbomAir governor Udom Emmanuel is blessing to Akwa Ibom state. Highly professional as a governor in everything he does.
@transparency_ng @MBuhari @UN @IntlCrimCourt @WhiteHouse This man has no business with the rule of law and funny enough, some lawyers top ones including SAN are backing and justifying his tyrannical utterances.
@HQNigerianArmy Although i am not in support of elections misconduct of any forms but how come that the military now are the one involving directly in handling electoral issues?
@daily_trust For me, it is wrong!
@PDPVanguard @MBuhari @akaebube @NGRWailers @Amaka_Ekwo @bolanle_cole @john_danfulani @AliyuAtiku @officialKolaO @OlayinkaLere @Mo_Atiku @PDPNYF Which kind man u be Buhari?
@KadariaAhmed @inecnigeria In fact, he should resigns with an apology..
@daily_trust The foolish would always talk before regretting.
When the righteous many does not rise against the wicked few the evils would prevail. Thank God for the righteous many who are ready to resist the evils few and save our democracy. Nigeria would be good again.
@MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg Why do you always feel and think that you are the best amongst others? I think this is where  Nigeria's problems lies.
#AtikuMyVal completely Atikulatd.
@MobilePunch Fear of losing
@daily_trust Indeed this man is campaigning as if he is the opposition.
#IRememberPDP yes we remember the PDP antecedence of a far better governance than the APC own, we remember the PDP that gave us many institutions and affordable food prices than the APC that starved us. So many to mention.
#WikeHostsAtiku Nigerians were  in dying need of an already made president now here he comes the Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is the president that Nigeria so needs now especially in the 21st century world.
@utdxtra Ole is united by blood and in indeed
@JajaPhD A coward dies many times before actual death.
@JajaPhD I've been calling him a weakly and now look out it, I am justified.
@cnni Yes our country is in chaos and in fact, something close to a state of anomie the president have suspends the constitution as well, no due process again we are now living in fear and threat Buhari is autocratic and fascist like Adolf Hitler.
#CJNOnnoghen I think Saraki is wasting time he should impeach Buhari at all costs. He does not need to go to the senate chambers get some senators with you and do it and issue a world press conference period.  after all we are in the state of lawlessness.
@MBuhari You are not the constitution the constitution is supreme over you, me and every other citizens. This action of yours is capable of doing just one thing and that is, causing conflict in the country. You don't just suspends the CJN you equally suspends the constitution.
Go ma'am you can do it. https://t.co/nwEjDL3qdX
They are confirming that Udom is a goal. https://t.co/prX5XZtlW2
@fkeyamo Foolishness is when you say Atiku cannot step into USA and he steps in and then you still have the guts to be cooking another bullshit.
@APCNigeria These heroes you mentioned and praised @OfficialAPCNg I know if these men were alive today the APC would have disrespect them all because of Buhari.
#EndSARS what exactly does the new IGP want to achieve by bringing SARS back to the state?
@CNN You're simply the greatest
@ShehuSani You wey no know your blood group
@daily_trust @laimohammed124 @atiku Drained brain people.
@daily_trust @NGRPresident @laimohammed124 @atikua2019 @pdpnhqigbonig @OfficialAPCNg Madness
I can confidently bet for a win at @officialmanchesterunited under  OGS leader as boss
So finally the @OfficialAPCNg have losses sleep over Atiku visit to USA
@MrFixNigeria What's trending is that, many of the @APCNigeria members have lost sleep over Atiku visit to USA.
@jeffphilips1 @DOlusegun Don't you think that you need a brain reset? Stop defending failure.
@KadariaAhmed Well done ma'am
The world could see how massive and huge the crowd today at the Uyo township stadium singing, glorifying and receiving HE Udom Emmanuel and at the same time chorusing Atiku as well as acceptable Presidential candidate we would vote for in AKS.
Based on statistics Atiku is a goal for president. #Basedonstatistics #
Thanks for helping me reach 25 followers! Who else do you think should be following me?
@DrJoeAbah Atiku
@SkyNews I wish a successful surgery
Occasion like this further cause us to ask the question if Buhari is truly in charge or the cabal as alarm raised by the wife of the president.
The spirit is completely returned everly united, great job guys.  Congratulations at OGS and the boys.
Voters in an election like the forthcoming one don't vote on what you will do but on what you have done.
By now it is settled in every eligible voters that would vote,  their mindset at the point of casting ballot will remember that Buhari government has brought killing of so many Nigerians.
# high handedness
@oluremisonaiya @MoghaluKingsley @toluogunlesi But some of the persons you sat with are the real deal for spreading fake news.
@MBuhari This is more or less hypocritical talk.  What about the trademoney that your VP is sharing to people? What do you have to say about that Mr president?
@daily_trust No brain
@The_Atiku @dmightyangel Parody account
@The_Atiku @dmightyangel Parody
@IsimaOdeh Oh so adorable and cute
@fkeyamo This should rather tell you that PDP are serous this time than last election that you guys in planned a mole in person of the then national chairman of the party Adamu Mauzu to work for you guys.
The greatest scam in Nigeria is when they say that governor is the chief security officer of his state but the security apparatus of that same state is being controlled by the federal government. How does that correlate?
A governor and conspirator who now cries on TV 📺 needs do just one thing that is, confession of his sabotage role he played  against president Jonathan administration.
@utdxtra @Mike_Phelan_1 @ManUnitedZone_ That also re-energies us (fans) to really  understand what it means to be a united fan.
@renoomokri @ChibuikeAmaechi @OfficialAPCNg @MBuhari Go ahead
The finishing was when he says that Ita Enang has helped demarket the APC because he couldn't even lied to defend his party the APC
But it's not fair to leaked an intelligence information but on a second thought,  who leaked it to the press? They must be a spy in there.
But it's not fair to leaked an intelligence information but on a second thought,  who leaked it to the press?
RT @renoomokri: The shameless, irrelevant presidential aide first said my #AmaechiTapes were from 2014. After I released the rest, he chang…
Tell Tolu Ogunseli not commit suicide because of a world known failed government.
@MrFixNigeria Thank God say Buhari no dey read because by now with all these tweets him for jail us in Twitter finished
@MrFixNigeria You no know? You should not forget that it was the same Amaechi that criticized the appointment of Oshio as APC chairman. So bro forget it,  its now left for us to accept that the president does not read even a committee report.
But is it not the truth  that Amaechi is saying?  Everyone knew that Buhari is packaging
@ShehuSani So do you mean that students going back to school is not important as the 2019 elections?
@ManUtd 6-1 for us united
@utdxtra Problems in Jones
#LetterToBae too hard to find one but trust me when I do... ooh I'll definitely behold you so preciously.
NANS executive must go! 	NANS executive must go! 	NANS executive must go! 	NANS executive must go! 	NANS executive must go! 	NANS executive must go! 	They are not a pressure group they are simply a political party. They must go!
A NANS that agree to suspend educational development for any other infrastructural development is not worthy to be call NANS. Education is paramount to every other development government has millions of years to develop whatever she wants to develop tempering with edu is suicide.
This current NANS does not represent the students interest therefore they must go.
I am a 400 level student  university of Uyo, Uyo. I am a custodian of NANS: following the ineffective leadership of the association, I hereby call for the immediate resignation of the executive body of the Association.
This NANS does not represent students interest at all but their personal interests. How on earth would they accept that any other infrastructural development is greater that the educational development? They must be insane.
#INEC I never had confidence on this empire since the day of her current chairman Prof. Mammud.  Because the man started with inconclusive election in virtually all the elections he's been  conducted thus, how then should we suddenly believe him to conduct a free poll in 2019?
@dino_melaye This nonsense should stop.  How could  you pursue the spoke person of the opposition party  in a framed up offense that has not been attend to by a court of competent jurisdiction.
@HQNigerianArmy My best wishes to the Nigerian army.
@dino_melaye You are a good man my senator
Here’s my year in emoji: I wish everyone on Twitter a very happy and prosperous new year anniversary  #HappyNewYear #MyEmojiYear https://t.co/VHYCL9DG7w
@ManUtd HBD Sir
@ManUtd Pogba first
@MBuhari How did you do that as in have the face and boldness to do that? Honestly, election fever catches you because, ordinarily,  you of all peoples would not go near there. A man you called inept, crooked and corrupt.
@SPNigeria But I thought those police  were were sent to Borno state to fight Boko Haram abi?
@brfootball Simply the best
@TJAdethink @HQNigerianArmy @SaharaReporters It's quite unfortunate that you carried a portrait of Fela then sound like Buhari
@renoomokri @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg He's doing a dis-service to our heroes the military.
@daily_trust @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @APCNigeria You will not stop to witch hunt your political opponent
APC kicked off their campaign today in AKS my state in a very low key as if they were tired of lying. No vibe,  their lies so obsolete.
@BusinessDayNg Dangote days are numbered. A bourgeois cannot be in a campaign without a serious stake this time they've set to bye the national asset Buhari is ready to sale NLNG to Dangote.
It's terrible that this dreaded group could openly endorsed a president that has led the country throughout the period of their dastardly act.
@daily_trust I think this is where Buhari should have started his re-election campaign not in my peaceful state
@channelstv So do the APC lies when they told us that PDP looted Nigeria
Wow!  Finally Buhari is involving in other businesses apart from breeding cow
@GovAyoFayose @MrUdomEmmanuel And he will come to tell us his usual lies
@dmightyangel Your mumu never do abi?
@DOlusegun The EFCC are just creating stories
You had a great game today congratulations
This is how Paul box today. Great job guy https://t.co/DI5ZPP7ZaZ
@ManUtd Yeah Manchester united is back
@channelstv He will not o
@MrUdomEmmanuel My own for you is that, you should not bowed or back down for anybody or group(s)  intimation.
Three witches of Macbeth https://t.co/p1XX0ZknfE
@realdanielemeka So foolish but it's unfortunate that it comes from a leader of over a 100 millions literate.
@realdanielemeka When a leader lose it he resort to shenanigans and cheap propaganda to deceived the gullibles
Free Deji ooooooo
@MBuhari But you don't just know what its mean nah
@daily_trust God will not allow insensitivity to continue sir
@FootyYapper @GSounessSky I may not be a Liverpool fan but I think, the guy is sensational right now
@FootyYapper @TheDavidBecks Does it mean that Liverpool are are 21st century underdog?
@TIME My heart is with the people of Indonesia in this terrible and trying time of their lives.
@UgochiJaneTrump @dmightyangel @ProfOsinbajo The most foolish thing a VP like ours should do in the face of mirage and Utopian economy situation of a country like ours is to be going  around and be deceiving the gullible ones in the country.
@daily_trust To contest and winning the contest are two different things
@MobilePunch Nonsensical
This man's death does nothing than further putting and picturing Nigeria as unsafe nation to live and do business in. My deepest  condolences to the bereaved family and Nigeria entirely.
@adeyanjudeji @PoliceNG @AmnestyNigeria @USEmbassyAbuja @EU_Commission @NGRSenate @nassnigeria You shall be free and free indeed Deji
@Ole_LFC Jose is still greater than him in the world of football
@MourinhoMindset I respect your decision Sir.
@cnni @tompmcgowan As a united fan, I believe Zidane can fit it with his prowess he can fit it.
Man United fired Mourinho the same way Nigerians will fired Buhari and the lifeless FC @ the poll in 2019.
@ManUtd It's sad man but the club have to move on.
#Debate2019 for me, Obi/Osinbajo #VPdebate# a replica of Trump/Clinton #Presidentialdebate# on economy. 		Nigeria is great.
#Debate2019 its high time the blame game stops  and the strength and time for is refocus on thinking on solving,  fixing and making Nigeria great again.
@atiku @PeterObi Sir please, don't take it hard on them because what they know is to apportion blames.
Thus the APC genotype is blame even at the debate they are blaming the pass government even when they failed they blame.
@repdavidscott Great work Sir
@MobilePunch Tinubu stooge is talking
It's funny that some leaders champion a particular course but their reality and practices are not what they really claims to be championing. It's a reality ironic  in Nigeria and in Africa.
In Africa, I still believe that one of her foundational problems is forming a central ideology as basic of governance that would transformed its citizenship  thoughts on leadership.
@CNN @StCollinson That analysis must be a bias analysis
Signing the electoral bill into law is not just about the elections as per sey but it's about saving humans lives but then its takes someone humane to understand the intending and unintending consequences associating to this particular amended electoral law by the NASS.
@OfficialPDPNig @PeterObi @MBuhari Its high time PDP should  resist the official attack and crime committing by the APC through its agents like EFCC and police. Enough is enough.
@GovAyoFayose I think the aid to the  Mr president on NASS has said that his principal has just did and expressed his veto power has the constitution permits him. Hence,  the NASA should also do according to the power conveyed on its by that same constitution by overriding the president assent
