In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 (in a separate decision from the final 5-4) that Florida's system of having different standards for counting ballots in different counties was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. We'll see how this plays out...
@AZGOP lawsuit on ballot counting in the #AZSEN race is using very similar grounds to the famous Bush v. Gore case from 2000. In that case, as here, the issues were: 1) counties having different ways of counting ballots; and 2) the deadline by which ballots need to be counted.
#AZ led the way in this effort way back in 2000. Our IRC isn't perfect, but it's much better than the alternative. We must end #gerrymandering if we want to end the gridlock and extreme partisanship in Congress and solve the issues facing our country. #GovReform

...the freedom of our system in contrast with authoritarian governments. We are certainly not an Ancient Athens-style direct democracy. But saying we are just a ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù is incomplete. Iran is a republic with elected representatives, an elected president etc.
@_DianeDouglas just said, ‚ÄúIf another teacher comes up to me and says we‚Äôre a democracy, I‚Äôm gonna scream. We are not a democracy, we are a republic.‚Äù I‚Äôve heard many people say this lately. In fact we are a hybrid of both. We often say ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù for short, to emphasize...
That‚Äôs all well &amp; good if a teacher wants to use that kind of example, but to have it required by the state? What if a school is already getting great science scores without using silly examples like this? Suddenly they‚Äôll have to change their practices and waste time on this?
I‚Äôll need to dig into this more, but these standards seem like too much detail to be mandated at the state level. Example: ‚ÄúCrosscut standards‚Äù that require linkages with other subjects, like ‚ÄúComparing cell walls to the walls of a castle, with guards that let things in or not.‚Äù

The article calls it an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), but the Governor used the acronym STOP on the radio (Temporary Order of Protection). Makes sense to me as long as there is strong protection against false accusations etc.
