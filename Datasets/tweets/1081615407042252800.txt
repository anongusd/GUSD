@flutiedawg @DaveMattia @PrisonPlanet Because immediate wall funding was supposed to be a firm prerequisite to any government reopening. That’s not even me saying that, he said that himself multiple times. He said it when the government was about to shutdown, during the shutdown, and 48 hrs ago.		Really bad optics.
@AmericanAsPie @mitchellvii But he said that wall funding was a pre-req. to an open government.		The government is about to reopen. There is no wall funding. Whether there will be in 3 weeks is another matter, but for now this is a bad look for him.

@mwam1993 @erichmcelroy @mitchellvii Well, at the end of the day I have the fact that Roger Stone has been indicted and, seeing as he is at current refusing to testify, will likely face contempt charges if I had to guess.		What exactly to you have?
@mwam1993 @erichmcelroy @mitchellvii So you’re just spitballing. Got it.
Considering the FAA can no longer confidently say everything is under control I legitimately wonder if someone has to die before .@GOP realizes that *m a y b e* this whole shutdown over the Wall thing was a poor hill to die on. https://t.co/X9VOSSCxwx
@MiddleClass45 @erichmcelroy @mitchellvii Given the facts at hand it’s pretty hard to spin this in a way that puts Roger Stone in a good light while also keeping things logical.
@mwam1993 @erichmcelroy @mitchellvii Got any sources for that claim?
RT @aidachavez: “furloughed FBI agents volunteered to arrest roger stone” is the funniest sentence in the english language
@BuckeyeCanuck @TheLastWord The worst part is the photo is from 2005. That’s akin to dressing as the Twin Towers for Halloween 2001. Highly offensive and completely unjustifiable under any circumstances.
@erichmcelroy @mitchellvii Honestly, even if there was a leak, there’s still no way (in my mind) for anyone supporting Trump, Stone, and Co. to spin this positively. One does not simply sidestep an FBI raid, the warrants for them require a great deal of facts and justification.
That’s a funny way of saying a majority of both parties don’t think moving towards socialism is a good thing. So much for the “radical left,” amirite? https://t.co/Zk1khyQyi8
@4EverAPatriot @Caped_Crusader6 @shermany65 @mitchellvii @jerome_corsi Additionally he wasn’t just indicted for “mixing up his days,” as you say, he was also indicted for witness tampering. So, unless he somehow mixed that up too, it’s doubtful the FBI charges won’t stick.
@4EverAPatriot @Caped_Crusader6 @shermany65 @mitchellvii The FBI gave other individuals indicted for lying to federal investigators multiple opportunities to amend their testimony, such as .@jerome_corsi, Stone was just dumb enough to think they didn’t have anything on him.

@SenatorCollins Start by telling .@senatemajldr to pick one of the numerous bipartisan bills from the House and send it to .@POTUS. Congress has the power to overrule a veto, so use it.
@thesuperpatriot @BillOReilly I can’t say whether that’s true, but the point remains: If you increase inequality and squeeze out the middle class they’ll look to alternative ideologies as the status quo has failed them.		Failure to recognize this has led to the rise of both the far left and the far right.
@realDonaldTrump There go the goalposts…
@cenkuygur @Mediaite @GOP Step 1 to being able to combat the Party of Trump is to recognize that there are no longer any rules. The only reason the .@GOP brings up “decorum” and whether or not a comment is “inappropriate” is to attack their opposition.
@BillOReilly People would be if they saw the benefits hit their bank accounts. Since the benefits are all going to the top-earners &amp; their tax havens, socialism is seen as the viable alternative to reduce inequality within a short amount of time.		I don’t know why no one has realized this.
@mcmikex @democracynow @VarshPrakash @SpeakerPelosi @sunrisemvmt Instead of trying to argue why the #GreenNewDeal is unnecessary, you instead go with “How dare you drive a car and live inside?”		Best argument I’ve ever read, hands down.

@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog And that’s okay.
@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog It’s only an accomplishment for Trump if it provides meaningful change and can be directly tied to his policies. I love economic and job growth, and I love low crime rates even more, I’m just not sold that Trump being in office made it happen.
@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog courts. Most of his “achievements” can honestly be disputed if you just read what the claims are. I feel that you’ll disagree with that thought, though. 4/4
@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog are really successful unless you can show demonstratable improvements. By that list’s logic, just establishing a council or a body to look into an issue is a success. That’s also not true. Arguably, the only thing I can really say was a success was the GOP takeover of the 3/
@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog 90s. Additionally, a lot of his other “achievements” either don’t do anything or have actually made things worse.

@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Several things I noticed from this right off the bat: A lot of his “achievements,” specifically economic/unemployment/and crime #s, are all just continuing trends that are well established.

@JakeSno46 @CrymsKills @PrisonPlanet @AOC Well, there are the neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, white supremacists, &amp; KKK members that he called “fine people,” like I said. He’s also tweeted talking points produced my The Daily Stormer (neo-Nazi website) and @RichardBSpencer. I can find links if you want, but shall I go on?
@jofron @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Do tell?
@dpakman His attention span is too short and his mind is too easily changed for him to make significant policy decisions. This isn’t the first time this has happened, and it definitely won’t be the last.
@TheRealEdwinR @netflix https://t.co/Lc3wtO38Wf
@realDonaldTrump The only reason the MSM is the “Enemy of the People” is because it refuses to be the propaganda arm of the @GOP. It’s no coincidence that @FoxNews is the only network he watches consistently, as it’s just a mouthpiece for the @GOP, which is what Trump wants the entire MSM to be.
@CrymsKills @PrisonPlanet @AOC Trump has definitely tacitly supported racists before &amp; routinely uses the same talking points as hate groups to support his policies. McCarthyism inherently relies on 100% allegation alone so I’d have to say that you’re mistaken on this one.

@SteveScalise @SteveScalise, you’re being intellectually dishonest and you know it. The tax increase is a moderate rate that the U.S. has had before during @GOP administrations, and it would only affect those earning $10M+/year. If you’re going to lie, at least lie well.
@LevineJonathan It’s Fox News.
@washingtonpost I find it doubtful that there will be a withdrawal. The defense lobby &amp; contractors stand to gain a lot from a perpetual war in Syria. Plus, the President appears to have an extremely short attention span. If he’s not reminded he probably won’t remember what he said.
@PrisonPlanet @AOC He did call white supremacists, neo-Confederates, and neo-Nazis “fine people,” and he does receive outsized support from those demographics, so it deserves a look. Birds of a feather, after all…
