@NERC_official surveyed Reliability Planning Coordinators about their preparedness in the event natural gas supplies were disrupted. Roughly 2/3 of reliability planners were not able to give a definitive answer about their preparedness. This is cause for concern.
A reliable grid means having an adequate supply of electricity day-to-day. A #resilientgrid means the electricity system can withstand &amp; recover from unlikely events that have catastrophic consequences – coal-fired generating capacity ensures grid reliability &amp; resilience.
Coal-fueled power plants provide fuel-secure electricity sources that ensure our electricity supply is both reliable and resilient. @NERC_official report lists 17 “vulnerabilities” that could interrupt the delivery of natural gas to power plants.
A @NERC_official report finds “vulnerabilities” that could interrupt the delivery of natural gas to power plants.  3/4 of gas-fired plants surveyed could cause blackouts if their natural gas supply is interrupted. Our take: https://t.co/ZKp95pSTgp
Recently, @NERC_official issued an assessment of the potential threats to the electricity grid posed by disruptions to natural gas pipelines and other parts of the natural gas delivery system…Our response: https://t.co/ZKp95pSTgp
ACCCE reminded @EPA today that the $33 billion CPP would reduce sea level rise by the thickness of two sheets of paper https://t.co/O8Qo9ESOp9
Testifying before @EPA today, we note that CPP is in stark conflict with DOE’s goal of preventing further retirements of coal-fired generating capacity to ensure grid reliability and resilience https://t.co/O8Qo9FapNJ
In testimony before @EPA, we state that CPP is not only a threat to grid resilience but also that it infringes on the authority of state public utility commissions, grid operators, and utility companies https://t.co/O8Qo9ESOp9
In our testimony at @EPA, we point out that in addition to threatening grid reliability and resilience, CPP would unnecessarily cost consumers and businesses billions of dollars. https://t.co/O8Qo9ESOp9
ACCCE testifies today: @EPA is correct to repeal the CPP because the rule greatly exceeds EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act. https://t.co/O8Qo9FapNJ
