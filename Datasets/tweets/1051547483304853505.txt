@AOC ”Politi­cians don’t win elec­tions by ex­plain­ing to vot­ers that the po­lice are fo­cused on poor black com­mu­ni­ties be­cause that’s where the 911 calls orig­i­nate.”
@AOC ”So­cial-jus­tice ac­tivists don’t raise money and stay rel­e­vant by fo­cus­ing on the black vic­tims of black vi­o­lent crim­i­nals.”
@AOC “The vic­tims of gun vi­o­lence don’t re­ceive the at­ten­tion they de­serve be­cause they don’t ad­vance the left’s po­lit­i­cal agenda.”
@AOC https://t.co/RjPevc3phe
@AOC ”All-white neigh­bor­hoods are ef­fec­tively ex­tinct. More than two-thirds of Amer­i­cans sup­port same-sex mar­riage. A mas­sacre at a gay night­club or a black church is not a sign of the times but a tragic de­vi­a­tion from what is now the norm.”
@AOC “Amer­i­can so­ci­ety has been get­ting more tol­er­ant for decades. Polling shows that we are less sex­ist, less racist, less ho­mo­pho­bic than ever. This progress is ev­i­dent in work­places, schools, hous­ing pat­terns and per­sonal re­la­tion­ships.”
@AOC “Lib­eral De­moc­rats in­sist that lit­tle has changed since the Eisen­hower ad­min­is­tra­tion. The irony is that if the coun­try were still as big­oted as the left claims, peo­ple like Mr. Smol­lett wouldn’t have to re­sort to tall tales to gain at­ten­tion.”
@crislopezg I’m not agreeing or disagreeing with you or him. I’m just curious. Like why are some genetic conditions more common in particular ethinic groups?
@crislopezg Okay this could be pretty easy to dismiss as racism, but is there any truth to what he said? I mean any? Are we supposed to believe that no matter what race you are we are ALL the same? Is there any differences between race and predisposed genetic differences? If so, what r they?

@AOC After the Amazon fiasco, not all of New York’s Democrats are anti-business progressives, writes @HolmanJenkins https://t.co/edFZndzwET via @WSJOpinion
@AOC "Congress might have to do without the services of AOC, now bragging about her success in killing Amazon jobs. How she became the representative of a community that needs opportunity &amp; economic development more than it needs campus lefty attitudinizing was always a mystery."
@SPeitsch @AOC Her conclusion is wrong. They are set to potentially gain $25 BILLION in tax revenue from the Amazon. That’s alot more than $3 Billion. Which is bigger, 3 Billion or 25 Billion, Sebastian?
@SPeitsch @AOC Do you understand how much tax revenue they are set to lose with Amazon gone? It’s a lot more than $3 Billion buddy.

@NimaYaghmaei @tgunerman @Ocasio2018 I agree. To my understanding the average joe makes up the majority of the protesters, however opportunistic left and right wing groups used this as an excuse to cause violence and destruction. Clearly the movement lacks organization and clear demands.
@NimaYaghmaei @alan_olafson @Ocasio2018 “The average demonstrator in this protest is a working class person who wants to have an affordable lifestyle, wants the resignation of Macron... the populist right-wing opposition to the tax dovetailed with leftist radical opposition to Macron,”		https://t.co/wvHStjF3Sx
@NimaYaghmaei @alan_olafson @Ocasio2018 “A Lot” of the yellow vests are not left wing. The majority of the vests are average joe’s who commute to work.
@NimaYaghmaei @tgunerman @Ocasio2018 The French protests are based on being the most heavily taxed country in the world. Yes inequality is a factor, but you seem to gloss over this important fact. https://t.co/AxDId5aI1V

@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin What are you talking about? The US is a highly individualistic country (Me first). However it’s in our best intrests to help other people and countries. Look at Post WW2 Europe. That sure is a “fuck everyone else” mentality lol. The board situation is about proper vetting Ma’am
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin Are you an immigration lawyer? 😂
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin I can’t help but notice, but is that Hebrew in your name? 		If so, how is this any different than Iseral protecting it’s boarders and sovereignty in the Middle East? 		i.e. Using reasonable force to protect boarders
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin I’m sorry for your losses and couldn’t imagine what you’ve been through personally, and extend my best wishes. 		However, I just think it was dumb for the parents who put their children in harms way to illegally enter the US when they’re other methods of entering legally.
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin and storming the boarder fence with your child in hand is not one of the ways to enter the US legally and safely.
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin I don’t blame them for fleeing their homeland and seeking asylum in the US. If they’re going to illegally cross the boarder and put them selfes, and their child, in a dangerous situation and expect nothing to happen then that’s foolish. There’s legal ways to enter the US
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin Central American gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 and the local governments are largely to blame for the mass migration, not the “fathers that beat the mothers”. Look at the crime rate in Central American, it’s around 75 per 100,000 people.
@WensdaiAddamns @AllanaHarkin Lol the US is a sovereign nation who has the right to legally protect it’s boarders using reasonable force. Please go to your local homeless shelter who presumably houses domestic abuse victims and let them stay in your morally righteous home.
@AllanaHarkin Where’s the criticisms for the dumbass parent bringing their child to a dangerous illegal boarder crossing? https://t.co/DQSxe9DBmK
@paolamendoza Maybe don’t break down an international boarder fence and attempt to enter a country illegally ?https://t.co/DQSxe9DBmK

@HillaryClinton If Democrats wanted something done on this issue they would have worked with Republicans who were more than willing to pass legislation. Instead, Dems are purposeful not corporating in order to use this as a political talking point. Disgusting.
@BleacherReport Poor coaching and lack of consistency at head coach. Stable organizations lead to stable QB’s and vice versa.
@CNN They have every right to be an activist and should be if they desire. Why is this a question?
@SportsCenter Mayweather should stop pussyfooting around agree to a bout in the Octagon
@ABC The Saudi Family obviously committed this atrocity. As former CIA director, advise Trump on this seriousness of this issue and put in place sanctions on the Saudi’s. You can still maintain economic relations (i.e. $100 million deal) and discourage bad behavior.

@GymAddicts4 @ABC Research Kaep’s net worth before and after the Labor Day Nike Ad. It triples in a mattor of hours which can only happen because of a Stock Equity Transaction that is contingent on insider knowledge. If that’s not a felonly I don’t know what is
@GymAddicts4 @ABC Look at Nike’s Stock price and the alleged dates of contact between Nike and Kaep. All I’m saying is that we would not have this problem if Kaep releases his tax returns

@danpfeiffer I don’t like Rubio that much, but how is this dumb? Rubio has a valid point as to how much humans contribute to climate change. How much is climate change due to nature vs humans? No where is Rubio denying climate change altogether, as to what you are claiming.
