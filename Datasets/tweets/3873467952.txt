I learn today from the leader of the US that Ireland is a part of the UK! Garfield Malcolm did something happen in the last 48 hours that I miss. If the US president is saying this it must be true we all know he never lies except on fake news.
Scotland demonstrated today that they stand with equality and justice for all in the face of fierce hatred and bigotry.
While Queen Elizabeth was hanging out with the leader of the US, thousands of children, babies are being cage by the US government.
One if the biggest protest in the UK history took place today. I am happy that there are still people in the world who believe in humanity and democracy. The UK is still one of the best example of democracy around.
Donald Trump is upset about the way Prime Minister May is handling the UK exit from the EU.
12 Russians have been indicted for hacking into the DNC emails, not to worry their ally Trump will pardon them if they are convicted. It’s always good to get your guy elected if you want to get away with crimes.
I will be able to tell my grand children exactly where I was when Queen Elizabeth met with a moron...
