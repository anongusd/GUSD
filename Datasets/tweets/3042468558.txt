America is A Constitutional Republic.
4. A group with a collective interest	A group of people who are considered to be equals and who have a collective interest, objective, or vocation
3. A unit within the large country	A constituent political and territorial unit of a national federation or union
2. Stay with elected representatives	A country or other political unit whose government or political system is that of a republic
1. A REPUBLIC	1. A political system with elected representatives	    A political system or form of government in which people elect representatives to exercise power for them
4.  Control organization by members	The control of an organization by its members, who have a free and equal right to participate in decision-making processes
3. A democratic system of government	A system of government based on the principle of majority decision-making
2. Democratic nation	A country with a government that has been elected freely and equally by all its citizens
1. Democracy	1. Free and equal representation of people   	  The free and equal right of every person to participate in a system of government, often practiced by electing representatives of the people by the majority of the people
This comparison, therefore, contrasts the form of government in most countries today with a theoretical construct of a ‚Äúpure democracy‚Äù, mainly to highlight the features of a republic.
Most modern nations are democratic republics with a constitution, which can be amended by a popularly elected government.
In a ‚Äúpure democracy,‚Äù the majority is not restrained in this way and can impose its will on the minority.
In a republic, a constitution or charter of rights protects certain inalienable rights that cannot be taken away by the government, even if it has been elected by a majority of voters.
Both forms of government tend to use a representational system ‚Äî i.e., citizens vote to elect politicians to represent their interests and form the government.
The key difference between a democracy and a republic lies in the limits placed on government by the law, which has implications for minority rights. https://t.co/hiSPNe75S7

@MrSimonMorris After President Trump was elected the DOW exploded.  On November 8th, 2016, the DOW stood at 18,332.  Since that date the DOW has soared, and it never looked back.
@MrSimonMorris The day President Obama was elected President, November 4th, 2008, the DOW stood at 9,625.  Immediately however, the DOW began to tank and by March 9, 2009, the DOW could go down no further as it landed at 6,547 for a decrease of more than 30%.
@MrSimonMorris The DOW	After President Obama was elected President the already low stock market crashed.  When Trump was elected the stock, market skyrocketed.  The markets are a gauge of the economy and include expectations of the future.
@MrSimonMorris As we approach President Trump‚Äôs first 600 days in office, we decided to compare his economic results to those of Obama for the exact same time period.  We start with the stock market results
@MrSimonMorris On Friday former President Barack Obama gave a speech in Illinois where he was critical of the current President while never referring to President Trump as ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù.  Obama then took credit for President Trump‚Äôs economy.
@MrSimonMorris As we approach the first 600 days into the Donald J. Trump Presidency it‚Äôs again time to assess his accomplishments.  What better way to perform this analysis than to compare his results to the prior Administration‚Äôs ‚Äì President Barack H. Obama‚Äôs?

Trump bested Obama by 804,000 manufacturing jobs since taking over White House when compared to the 19 months prior to the 2016 election!  These high paying jobs are the same jobs that Obama said would never come back.
Speaking of jobs, I looked at the ADP report yesterday, Tammy, 830,000 new manufacturing jobs in the last 19 months. The prior 19 months, 26,000.
Jobs	Charles Payne from FOX Business reported on some stunning manufacturing news.  Via Making Money with Charles Payne:
With his increasing GDP and slowing of debt increases, President Trump has managed to decrease the debt to GDP ratio in his first 600 days in office.  This is a very good result that is rarely mentioned by the MSM.
As a result, the debt to GDP ratio is going down.  President Obama increased the US debt to GDP ratio by 40% from around 60% in 2009 to over 100% in 2016.

Also, President Trump didn‚Äôt ride an Obama wave, the DOW under Obama went down in 2015 and stayed relatively flat until the 2016 election.
https://t.co/Sx4VYI7Wt5
Since President Trump was elected President the DOW tied the record for the most all-time closing highs in a row. In January of 1987 President Reagan saw the DOW increase to new all-time highs a record 12 days in a row. In February of 2017, President Trump matched Reagan‚Äôs record
https://t.co/k7XjqpI44N
https://t.co/bPALA1h9Ft
After President Trump was elected the DOW exploded.  On November 8th, 2016, the DOW stood at 18,332.  Since that date the DOW has soared, and it never looked back.
The day President Obama was elected President, November 4th, 2008, the DOW stood at 9,625.  Immediately however, the DOW began to tank and by March 9, 2009, the DOW could go down no further as it landed at 6,547 for a decrease of more than 30%.
The DOW	After President Obama was elected President the already low stock market crashed.  When Trump was elected the stock market skyrocketed.  The markets are a gauge of the economy and include expectations of the future.
As we approach President Trump‚Äôs first 600 days in office, we decided to compare his economic results to those of Obama for the exact same time period.  We start with the stock market results.
On Friday former President Barack Obama gave a speech in Illinois where he was critical of the current President while never referring to President Trump as ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù.  Obama then took credit for President Trump‚Äôs economy.
President Trump versus Obama Their First 600 Days by Jim Hoft September 8, 2018, As we approach the first 600 days into the Donald J. Trump Presidency it‚Äôs again time to assess his accomplishments.

Texas law also prohibits businesses from charging customers extra for using credit cards. However, businesses are allowed to give discounts to consumers who pay with cash. Identity Theft in Texas
Texas law limits credit card interest rates to 18 percent, a rate that is periodically re-evaluated. However, this only applies if the card issuer is chartered in Texas, which is rare.
Texas law reaches a broader scope. It applies to anyone attempting to collect a consumer debt, regardless of their affiliations.	 Statute of Limitations
Texas‚Äô four-year statute of limitations on debts works alongside the Texas Debt Collection Act. The limited time period means that debt collectors cannot sue individuals in an attempt to collect debts that are more than four years past due.

10) In the end, the Supreme Court (yes, that's where it will end) willfully VALIDATE the President's Constitutional Authority &amp; the Wall will be built. /end https://t.co/XxL5mQb7rD
9) The President has National Security as his Primary Responsibility and it's his job to use whatever funds and declarations he needs to for that job. No Court in this Nation (except corrupt on the take Judges) would EVER rule against a President  for exercising that authority. https://t.co/YK0qpJ5gYc
8) So in summary - This will go to the Courts. Congress will sue the President over the  Border Wall. But here's how it will play out - Congress and the President are co-equal branches with different functions. Congress  allocates. The President spends. https://t.co/0MtyLgHpRU
8. Congress is powerless to stop cash reallocations on an omnibus bill AND cannot stop the DOD from taking measures under a declared Emergency. https://t.co/Wh2l1hp8jt
7. Also, these declarations make some funds fungible. For instance, if he determines that building a Wall on the Southern Border is a defense against Human Trafficking? He can move funds from anywhere else in the  Defense Dept Allocation &amp; simply build the Wall. https://t.co/tsBDwNuYVO
6. By making these two declarations President Trump has just communicated that he has the authority to NOT spend any funds he doesn't deem necessary and will return them to the US Treasury. So,  funds for Planned Parenthood? He can simply not allocate the funds. https://t.co/PStrYo8cqy
5. This opens up new options. https://t.co/YdzM9EqvFB
4. However, there are some other factors that are in play  here. One of them is that the President has declared a Human Rights  Emergency AND has notified Congress that he's invoking the Balanced  Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. https://t.co/xVALVQLgyn
3. Once the President is given the money with the instructions to spend it, he has a number of choices to make in spending it. There are some rules he has to follow &amp; some of the money is fungible and some  aren't. https://t.co/0L35MdTKyg
2.  Once Congress allocates money, their job is oversight of the money  being spent. They don't spend the money and have no say HOW it gets  spent as long as it's spent legally. That's their job to monitor with oversight. https://t.co/zYf6nibWb7
1. Congress allocates money to be spent. The President spends the allocated money. https://t.co/pn5iUofLhV
1) Let's talk about what the President can and can't do for this  Omnibus Bill. There's a lot of discussions both ways so let's examine  how money gets allocated &amp; spent in the US Government:

Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	13. ‚ÄúPick  the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.‚Äú Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people  and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions."
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	12. ‚ÄúThe price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.‚Äú Never let the enemy score points because you‚Äôre caught without a solution to the problem.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	11. ‚ÄúIf you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a  positive.‚Äú Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals: 10.‚ÄúThe major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain constant pressure on the opposition.‚Äù It unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	9. ‚ÄúThe threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.‚Äú  Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any  activist.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	8. ‚ÄúKeep the pressure on. Never let up.‚Äú Keep trying new things to keep  the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit  them from the flank with something new.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	7. ‚ÄúA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.‚Äú Don‚Äôt become old news.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	6. ‚ÄúA good tactic is one your people enjoy.‚Äú They‚Äôll keep doing it without  urging and come back to do more. They‚Äôre doing their thing, and will  even suggest better ones.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	5.‚ÄúRidicule is man‚Äôs most potent weapon.‚Äú There is no defense. It‚Äôs  irrational. It‚Äôs infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to  force the enemy into concessions.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	4. ‚ÄúMake the enemy live up to its own book of rules.‚Äú If the rule is that  every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with  this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	3.‚ÄúWhenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.‚Äú Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	2. ‚ÄúNever go outside the expertise of your people.‚Äú It results in confusion, fear, and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of  anyone.
Alinsky‚Äôs 13 Rules for Radicals:	1. ‚ÄúPower is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.‚Äú  Power is derived from 2 main sources ‚Äì money and people. ‚ÄúHave-Nots‚Äù  must build power from flesh and blood.
What does the Miranda warning do? The standard Miranda warning  You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning.

LIBERALS, YOU SAID NOTHING....	  51. Oh, and remember that time Donald Trump's son killed 21 dogs in a kennel because of his negligence and then used his political influence to get the case dismissed? Oh, sorry, that was Senator Jeff Flake.
