@DiaFramps "Dia Frampton" station on Pandora is great for work day tunes.  Being productive!
Wonder if #CBO can also score Congress' INACTION on #jobs? RT @SpeakerBoehner: House ldrs request text of #Obama‚Äôs leg so it can be scored..
@LooyMusic I think that's what all the Republicans have been doing as well. Welcome to the dark side, my friend! I'm proud! Ha!

Scared that @MittRomney campaign sr advisor Ron Kaufman looks like my dad. Mustache, teeth and all. Yikes.
Note: In two hours the #GOP candidates mentioned the word #middleclass only twice in the #reagandebate. Well...can't say I'm surprised!

@BostonSchools @mayortommenino @OFSE Hope there will be adequate time to discuss the "plan" in more mtgs once the cost has been determined.
@BostonSchools @mayortommenino @OFSE Where is the cost listed? Renovations noted? Responses to my e-mails? Looking forward to seeing them.
@mayortommenino @BostonSchools @OFSE DON'T MOVE #BostonLatinAcademy. Y hasn't CJohnson shared her plan w/students, parents & teachers yet?

Selfish Moment: Why does the biggest storm in years, #Hurricane #Irene, have to hit a few months after I buy my 1st home w a bsmt? :(
