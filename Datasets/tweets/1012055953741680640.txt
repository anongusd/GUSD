@animeclubcutie @ClaraSorrenti @girlisariot I don‚Äôt agree. I believe in putting the USSR in its proper historical context, which means addressing both its successes and its failures. Its successes include beating back the Nazis pretty much on its own, an incredible achievement. We can afford to criticize the failures too.
@animeclubcutie @ClaraSorrenti @girlisariot It‚Äôs a decision worth scrutinizing. Not much of that scrutiny is in good faith though, which is why I‚Äôve tried to refine my critiques of the USSR rather than just spouting them off without any consideration of the destruction of capitalism and imperialism.

@cholo_commie @jaybeware We‚Äôll have to disagree there. I think your characterization of Rojava as nothing more than an imperial project is extremely misguided (not surprising judging from the sources you posted)
@cholo_commie @jaybeware As an aside maybe Rojava wouldn‚Äôt have had to rely on American resources if an ostensibly leftist country like China actually stood by principles like ‚Äúsupporting national liberation movements‚Äù
@cholo_commie @jaybeware Oh well if this clearly unbiased source doesn‚Äôt like Rojava then we have no choice but to uncritically defer to him
@cholo_commie @jaybeware And as for the Turkish government‚Äôs chomping at the bit to steamroll Kurdish populations, funded by American, Chinese, and Russian cash, is that imperialism too or is that acceptable? It‚Äôs not as simple as you‚Äôre trying to frame it.

@jaybeware I‚Äôm not trying to argue for idealism over materialism. I‚Äôm saying Rojava should have gotten support from the global left (especially socialist governments) that they did not get. The ‚Äúcold calculus‚Äù that I‚Äôve seen from a lot of these folks since day one is basically ‚Äúfuck em‚Äù
@jaybeware And I think that was a really bad error. Rojava‚Äôs goal was always to have an autonomous region for Syrian Kurds, not to break off as an independent nation.
@jaybeware Personally I fail to see what other options they had, and I have seen a stream of opinions asserting that Rojava was a CIA project and ethnostate from the beginning. The lack of international leftist support (esp. socialist countries) is a big reason why they‚Äôre so vulnerable now

Clerk for Judge David Wilk, Patrice Scypta:	262-653-2739		Say ‚ÄúI demand that you challenge the state‚Äôs grounds for the charges unjustly filed against Chrystul Kizer. Also, you must force prosecution to give ALL of their evidence to the defense. Chrystul deserves a fair trial.‚Äù
Victim/witness coordinator Heather Beasy:	262-653-2471		For this one, say: ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you looking out for Chrystul Kizer? She is clearly a victim yet she is being criminalized by the District Attorney‚Äôs office. I demand you take action and stand up for victims of abuse.‚Äù
District Attorney Michael Graveley:	262-653-2687		Assistant DA Zachary Brost:	262-653-2682		Deputy DA Angelina Gabriela:	263-653-2484		Kenosha County DA‚Äôs office (general):	262-653-2400
Just as a suggestion, say something like ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm calling in support of Chrystul Kizer, and I demand that you drop all charges against her. Chrystul was acting in defense of her life and the lives of others, and you have no right to criminalize her actions of survival.‚Äù

@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Then feel free to DM me with your manifesto. We‚Äôre going nowhere here so I‚Äôm gonna be done now
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque The very formulation of an alternative depends on input from huge numbers of people. You and I do not have all the answers.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be so vague lol
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Instead you‚Äôve elected to grossly oversimplify, and act like you have answers where you do not or cannot
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Also, considering the interests of stakeholders is not necessarily the same as consulting and deliberating with stakeholders directly
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque This is part of why I think your perspective is myopic. It‚Äôs not just industry that matters! Organizational plans SHOULD take social &amp; cultural impacts of economic decisions into account but they generally don‚Äôt. Organizations have to be accountable to more than just themselves
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Not necessarily, as your own examples of corporate central planning demonstrate. Making plans doesn‚Äôt mean the org consults every single stakeholder about those plans (although of course they should)
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque You said I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt offer an alternative‚Äù because... why exactly? Because I‚Äôm too ‚Äúvague‚Äù for you? You‚Äôve spoken in very broad terms yourself yet I‚Äôve been able to parse out your analysis and prescription.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque What‚Äôs idealistic is assuming that it‚Äôs even possible for one person to have a perfect, all-encompassing answer to extremely broad and difficult economic and organizational questions
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque I did offer an alternative just now: democratic reorganization of the economy (which may include centralization!). ‚ÄúDemocratic‚Äù means we consult with our communities rather than trying to create a whole system of political economy by ourselves.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque I believe in the democratic reorganization of the economy, but I am not committed to centralization as an axiomatic aspect of that program. But regardless I came to this thread to critique your analysis, not your prescription
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Now who‚Äôs strawmanning? I never said ‚Äúbreak them down‚Äù or ‚Äúbreak them up‚Äù (although I‚Äôm sure we can both agree there‚Äôs industries that should be eliminated wholesale like oil/gas)
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Sure bud, never critique yourself or your arguments you‚Äôre 100% right about everything
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque If you had just said that I‚Äôd have had less of a bone to pick. My central issues were 1) your fallacious analysis of capitalist economies as inherently competitive, and 2) your apparent failure to consider the ends toward which the ‚Äúcentral planners‚Äù at these corporations strive.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Sure, but again that‚Äôs not the part of your argument I took issue with. I took issue with your analysis of capitalism as inherently competitive (it is not) and your citation of central planning within corporations as a positive to (apparently) emulate.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Yes... that‚Äôs an example of central planning by corporations. That doesn‚Äôt refute any point I‚Äôve made about your argument.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque I agree there‚Äôs a strong case to be made for this. But your particular argument relies on several key fallacies (and you‚Äôve moved the goalposts now that I‚Äôve pointed them out). I‚Äôm just reading what you wrote.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque You said ‚Äúindustries‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalist corporations‚Äù favor central planning. Perhaps you should read your own posts more carefully.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Now you‚Äôre just moving the goalposts, and trying to deflect from your glaringly obvious mischaracterization of capitalist economies. But please, enlighten me of what I haven‚Äôt thought of.

@Grossmanite @Alysonesque An alternative to the capitalist mode of production will not come about by emulating some of the worst parts of the capitalist mode of production
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque What‚Äôs more, you cite the tendency of corporations to engage in long-term planning as evidence that they REALLY want central planning. But this misses the point of their plans entirely ‚Äî their plans are oriented toward a destructive and self-serving goal of profit maximization.
@Grossmanite @Alysonesque Capitalism is defined by private ownership of the means of production, not competition. My electricity provider has total dominance over their market with 0 competitive threats, but is no less capitalist.

I think Marxism would better be described as a schematic, or an analytical framework, than a ‚Äúscience‚Äù unless you‚Äôre using an operational definition of ‚Äúscience‚Äù that‚Äôs not really applicable beyond a narrow academic context
It‚Äôs about as valid to me as calling neoclassical/Keynesian economics a ‚Äúscience‚Äù (and I obviously say that as someone who is far more sympathetic to Marxism than either of those tendencies)
The notion of Marxism as a ‚Äúscience‚Äù has always been spurious to me because historical processes are inherently not replicable, one‚Äôs assertions about the past (or future) are not usually falsifiable, and it‚Äôs impossible to isolate most independent variables in complex societies.

@Alysonesque @USDelendaEst But the Leninist theory of states is not even incompatible with anarchism at least, idk about demsoc though
@Alysonesque @USDelendaEst This seems like circular logic. If Leninism defines itself as the only leftist tendency, then of course by that logic other things will be not-left. But given that anarchists, demsocs, and Leninists do share broad goals beyond statecraft that seems like gross oversimplification
@USDelendaEst @Alysonesque Doubting that someone is a leftist at all because they don‚Äôt subscribe to a particular leftist tendency is 100% sectarianism, and it‚Äôs amazing how you folks are trying to pass it off as genuine critique
@Alysonesque @USDelendaEst Who in the hell said no critique? For what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm much more sympathetic to anarchism than MLism but that doesn‚Äôt mean I would doubt the leftism of an ML. ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just mean ‚Äúthe thing I agree with‚Äù
@Alysonesque @USDelendaEst As we all know everyone LOVES working with mean and dismissive folks who play purity politics one one hand while denouncing sectarianism on the other

@USDelendaEst @Alysonesque You‚Äôd have a point if that‚Äôs what she said lmao, doubting the leftism of other tendencies because of those disagreements is absolutely sectarianism. Christ almighty

@Alysonesque I fail to see how it hurts any leftist movement for a leftist to become a public defender or bail fund operator
@Alysonesque Nobody‚Äôs talking about abandoning principles, although I think the specific principle ‚Äúnever work within the bourgeois state‚Äù is counterproductive. It writes off potential allies &amp; fails to consider many folks‚Äô ongoing dependence on benevolent actors within the bourgeois state
@Alysonesque But these people work within the confines of the bourgeois state. So if you work with and support these liberals and their orgs you are supporting that work by proxy
@Alysonesque Refusing to work with liberals who do incredibly fucking important and helpful work because ‚Äúwords mean things‚Äù is a crippling and unnecessary self-hindrance
@Alysonesque That‚Äôs just patently ridiculous, bail funds and public defenders do more to keep average folks out of prison on a daily basis than you or me. Maybe we can learn from them. This absolute refusal to work with people making these life-or-death material decisions screams sectarianism
@Alysonesque But how is that NOT sectarianism? Tons of folks doing deeply important work operate within the framework of the bourgeois state. Should bail funds shutter up? Should public defense lawyers quit their jobs?
@Alysonesque There‚Äôs no sectarianism when you derisively call your supposed comrades ‚Äúleftists‚Äù for subscribing to a different tendency? Can‚Äôt say I agree
@Alysonesque Doubting the commitment to leftism of people who aren‚Äôt totally on board with you seems pretty sectarian.
@Alysonesque Fair. Can‚Äôt say I agree with 100% of your framing but thanks for clarifying

@thitchner @agraybee And what I‚Äôm asserting is that there are a LOT of angry leftists out there who are willing to vote for GOOD candidates, and that‚Äôs not even including those who are disenfranchised
@thitchner @agraybee Typically that‚Äôs when the DNC runs shitty candidates who run uninspiring campaigns with bad policies. That‚Äôs why Rauner won in my home state (IL) in 2014. Strategy is important! And even the vote in these more ‚Äúliberal‚Äù states is often suppressed through felony disenfranchisement
@thitchner @agraybee We can play what-ifs all day. What if those leftist activists who were mad at Jones showed up to the polls in droves? What if those fabled white moderates were disgruntled enough to stay home? Lots of things can happen and we‚Äôre in the ‚Äúpointless bickering‚Äù stage of this thread
@thitchner @agraybee US politics today are much more federally consolidated than in the 1860s. A totally enfranchised US would vote overwhelmingly Democrat
@thitchner @agraybee I wouldn‚Äôt trust the DNC to be progressive if the fate of the universe depended on it. I‚Äôm asking if they‚Äôve made ANY strategic investments in Alabamian candidates prior to Jones (they haven‚Äôt)
@thitchner @agraybee And yet he still won!  What would happen if there was a genuine leftist running for statewide office in an actually democratic Alabama? He could potentially drum up even more enthusiasm
@thitchner @agraybee Don‚Äôt think McElwee was saying that they‚Äôd win zero elections but they‚Äôd quickly be driven into national obsolescence
@thitchner @agraybee Also important: how hard did national Dems look for inspiring candidates with good policies? How much money did they funnel into those candidates over the years?
@thitchner @agraybee Not sure where you‚Äôre going with this and frankly not interested in guesstimations. A Dem was recently elected in Alabama (albeit a conservative one admittedly) even amid all this voter suppression. One might presume that elections would shift leftward if everyone could vote.
@agraybee @kalina_chung @thitchner Let‚Äôs get everyone enfranchised and find out
@thitchner @agraybee @kalina_chung A significant contingent that, crucially, suppresses the vote as much as humanly possible to make it absurdly difficult for the most marginalized people (ie poor black folks) to vote. The state would be MUCH more Democrat-leaning if everyone over 18 could actually vote.
@agraybee @kalina_chung @thitchner For the Communists no, for the Democrats absolutely. Think about how ridiculously suppressed the Alabama vote currently is. Something like 1/3 of Alabamian black men can‚Äôt vote.
@thitchner @agraybee @kalina_chung I have not argued and would not argue that the Alabama Communist Party specifically is well-positioned to win elections. I was using it purely to demonstrate that a significant left contingent exists in the South and should not be dismissed as you folks seem to be doing
@thitchner @agraybee @kalina_chung I brought up the Alabama Communist Party to point out that there is a significant left contingent even in deeply Republican states. Not trying to argue that the Alabama Communist Party can reliably win elections. Christ almighty
@agraybee @kalina_chung @thitchner You‚Äôre being myopic and obtuse. How the fuck do you think women and black people got the right to vote? They didn‚Äôt do it by voting I‚Äôll tell you that
@thitchner @agraybee @kalina_chung Well, the government was suppressing votes even more blatantly than today and even declared the Communists illegal in the early 50s. Who knows what would have happened if Alabama was actually a functioning democracy in any respect?
@agraybee @thitchner @kalina_chung My mistake, after organizing in the late 20s they were actually declared ILLEGAL by Alabama in 1951. That‚Äôs because they were a threat to the established order.
@agraybee @thitchner @kalina_chung Elections aren‚Äôt all that matters though, you‚Äôre missing the point
@agraybee @kalina_chung @thitchner Obviously there‚Äôs been setbacks after the rise of mass incarceration, gutting of unions, ramping-up wars, and overall expansion of the corporate police state. But the point remains that the left is and has been alive and well even in solidly Republican states
@thitchner @agraybee @kalina_chung No but it was extraordinarily successful at unionizing black workers, most notably sharecroppers. The Alabama CPUSA also served as a training ground for civil rights heroes like Rosa Parks

@knowingispowr @Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts It started out in Europe but it has since spread all over the world. Today, fascists are supported by capitalists who fear that socialism will give too much democratic power to the people! Trump, Bolsonaro, Le Pen and other fascists enjoy heavy support from business elites
@knowingispowr @KPikklefield @Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts That‚Äôs exactly what fascism was and is. Nationalist, conservative, ethno-supremacist capitalism. Judging by your profile you‚Äôd love it!
@KPikklefield @Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts Fascism is just authoritarian state-enforced white supremacist capitalism. You‚Äôre a proud champion of it, you just call it something different. Socialists are the only ones standing for freedom and democracy.

@Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts Nazis were explicitly friendly to capitalism. That‚Äôs why Mein Kampf actually plagiarized writings of Henry Ford, and Hitler privatized every bank in Germany. Castro never did anything comparable to the Holocaust and you are insulting my dead ancestors who were murdered by Nazis.
@Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts How many times can one person be wrong in one day? You‚Äôre in the running for a world record here

@Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts Fascism is explicitly opposed to socialism. ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù means ‚Äúanti-fascism.‚Äù Hope you learned something from this buddy!
@human_leech My gf is a black immigrant and I have also been unsure on how to approach this issue. I own guns myself but have been hesitant to take her to the range or anything (she has also been hesitant)
@Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts Yes, I side with the anti-fascists because opposition to fascism is basic sanity. Fascists murdered huge numbers of my family and you want to do the same.
@Dan_Seigars @FKEvilMedics @KPikklefield @knowingispowr @Madwook2016 @drewtw33ts I was threatened by the person threatening violence and my ‚Äúdemise‚Äù. Clearly you don‚Äôt give a shit about that because you approve of violence against leftists
