Early Reax from @POTUS' base, not happy. One fmr. Trump admin official tells me it will seen as a:“total cave unless he calls national security emergency when he doesn't get the wall fully funded in next 3 weeks.”
.@POTUS says: “Walls should not be controversial” as he calls on both parties to find a way to improve border security.
.@POTUS announces a deal to reopen the government and says he has a “powerful alternative” but won’t use it at this time. An apparent reference to a national emergency.

@rickwtyler @POTUS Thanks Rick .. I appreciate this.
Great meeting you @MaritsaNBCMT. You’re fantastic ! Come back anytime! https://t.co/Vu3SVSNymo
Moments ago I asked  @POTUS “yes or no” if he’s ever worked for Russia. His response: “I have never worked for Russia.” He also said it’s a “disgrace” that I asked the question.
When I asked @POTUS if the buck stops with him he tells me: “The buck stops with everyone.”
.@realDonaldTrump says Mexico will pay for the wall but the USMCA hasn't been ratified by Congress. Also nothing in the deal is earmarked for a wall.
As he makes his case for a border wall, @POTUS announces he's invited congressional leaders to the White House tomorrow to try to get a deal to reopen the government.

When pressed by @SavannahGuthrie on whether Dems now own the shutdown too, since they take control of the House today, @NancyPelosi digs in: “No...This is the Trump shutdown.”
On @TODAYshow , @NancyPelosi tells @SavannahGuthrie “I think that is an open discussion” when asked if Mueller can indict @POTUS. Some of the strongest language yet from a top Dem and the incoming Speaker.
White House just announced due to the shutdown @POTUS won’t go to Florida for the holiday. And @FLOTUS is heading home from Florida to spend Xmas w/ him. #shutdown

When asked if @POTUS is worried about impeachment @RudyGiuliani tells me: “He’s not worried about impeachment.”	 	Asked why not: “Because he’s convinced any fair-minded person would say he did nothing wrong.”
In a phone interview, @RudyGiuliani tells me of latest docs: “It’s very clear they don’t have any evidence involving the President.”	When pressed on docs saying @POTUS directed Cohen to commit two felonies, Giuliani responded, “You have to believe Cohen.  Who believes Cohen?”

.@PressSec tells reporters @POTUS called Judge Kavanaugh to congratulate him. He also signed the commission aboard Air Force One.

.@POTUS revived the idea of challenging Biden to a fight. He says of his potential 2020 Dem challengers “They’ve got some real beauties going.”

Proud to be a part of this panel and ready to weigh in on the fast moving developments of the Kavanaugh confirmation process. Standing by w/@mitchellreports https://t.co/3wb4nIgt1l
I’m told @POTUS is watching the hearing in the residence at this point. There’s no marine outside the West Wing which supports that idea. Trump allies say  Kavanaugh needs to be firm but also speak as a dad and judge.
.@POTUS on Kavanaugh “ I feel so badly for him.” Also reiterates he wants a thorough process.
On FBI investigating allegations against Kavanaugh @POTUS says: “wouldn’t bother me” but adds of FBI that’s “not what they do.” Not clear who at FBI has conveyed that.
A White House official tells me Kavanaugh says he wasn’t at the party In question. @LACaldwellDC says Kavanaugh gave that account to @OrrinHatch
Will Judge Kavanaugh withdraw his nomination? A WH official tells me unequivocally “no” pointing to his firm denial.

.@POTUS says he’ll meet w/ the leader of Iran with “no preconditions.”
.@POTUS said “I’ll meet w/ anybody “ when asked if he’ll meet w/ the leader of Iran!
When asked if he’s prepared to shut down the government over immigration priorities, @POTUS says: “ there’s always room for negotiation.” GOP leaders said they don’t want a shutdown. Midterms less than 100 days out.

When I asked @stevenmnuchin1 why the govt. is "bailing out" farmers to give relief to its own policies, he called that a "ridiculous comment" adding @POTUS	will "stand up" when he feels farmers are being unfairly targeted.
Statement from WHCA President after @kaitlancollins	was banned from an event for asking tough q's: "We strongly condemn the White House's misguided and inappropriate decision today ... This type of retaliation is wholly inappropriate, wrong-headed, and weak. It cannot stand..."
.@POTUS says he and EU Commissioner are starting negotiations on trade. Says they’re working Twd zero tariffs and better energy cooperation. Per @POTUS EU Will but more soybeans
Breaking: From Ambassador John Bolton“The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we’ve agreed that it will be after the first of the year.”
On a day his administration is announcing 12 b to help US farmers hurt by tariffs, @POTUS says “be patient.. we’re going to do something nobody else has done. “
On North Korea @POTUS says the effort to finalize a deal “seems to be going very well.”
While speaking to the VFW in Kansas City, MO @POTUS says “ Iran is not the same country.. we’re ready to make a deal.” That comes after his all caps threat yesterday.

A major twist to the G7– @POTUS pulls out of the communique after the White House says the U.S. has signed on. Also accuses @JustinTrudeau of making “ false statements.”
An administration official tells me @POTUS will sign the G7 communique. This was in doubt and a significant development given the divisions on trade, Iran and climate. Look for WH statement soon.

When asked about Russia annexing Crimea @POTUS says “you have to ask Obama. “ Fmr. Pres. Obama sanctioned Russia after it invaded and spearheaded effort to kick Russia out of G8.

On North Korea @POTUS says “ it’s a one-time-shot” Call’s this moment s great time. But there are still steep hurdles.
On North Korea @POTUS strikes a note of confidence he says: “so far so good”
In his G7 remarks @POTUS says he doesn’t blame G7 leaders but instead “ past leaders” of the U.S. for unfair trade practices.
At G7 @POTUS says summit has been “tremendously successful” and says trade topped the issues in Charlevoix.

Giuliani said he made @realDonaldTrump aware of paperwork that showed payments were actually reimbursements for Stormy. Trump replied: ‘Oh my goodness, I guess that's what it was for,’” Giuliani said.
Giuliani says he learned about Trump’s payments from Michael Cohen’s lawyers and after being told about documents that show proof of the payment.
Just spoke to Giuliani who says he revealed POTUS’ payments  “to get out in front of the Special Counsel, Southern District (of New York) because at some point they would realize this information and leak it. "
On the Natl. Day of Prayer, @POTUS says we’ll see some good announcements “very soon.” Perhaps a tease about Americans being held in North Korea?

@JohnKerry"says the deal will make the US' partners in the region safer and Israel safer." Important to remember this is 6 months, a trial.
Headlines tomorrow out of the WH won't be dominated by the rocky healthcare roll-out for the first time in days but instead Iran.
POTUS says the deal is -- the most significant and tangible progress that we've made w iran "since I took office."
POTUS speaks to one of the key sticking points -- says the deal gives iran  some relief of sanctions and won't impose new sanctions.
POTUS frames the deal as an important "first step" critics..dems and republicans will say its not tough enough.
