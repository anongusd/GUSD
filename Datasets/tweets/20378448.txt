@LorenAdler @CPopeHC There was still a significant amount of spending in the bill, even if significantly lower than ACA, so any model change  would have had to have given more credit for that spending than one in which mandate was all powerful.
@sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi I get that. Amazing to think of alternate history in which there's no individual mandate in Obamacare. Law is much less popular. Does SCOTUS even rule same way on Medicaid? Certainly wouldn't have been 7-2.
@ernietedeschi @sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan It's a totally different analysis. For one thing, repeal bill would have nixed mandate penalties in 2018, but this nixes them in 2019.
@StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi The politics would have been impossible at the time, but the way they could have optimally gamed it was to keep mandate in place for repeal effort so as to keep down uninsured #, and then repeal the mandate in tax bill.
@ernietedeschi @sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan See pg 20 "roughly 5 million fewer	people with coverage under Medicaid...Most of the	reductions in coverage in 2018 and 2019 would stem from repealing the penalties	associated with the individual mandate" https://t.co/c0xxxWXOSP
@ernietedeschi @sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan That was not same as the one during repeal. They were adjusted for TCJA
@StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi CBO fixation on the mandate meant it was impossible to come up with any plan that didn't find 20 mln+ would lose insurance, which was ridiculous.
@sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi have broader effect on private market as behavior of young/healthies &amp; also, people could sign up for Medicaid at point of care if they have an emergency
@sangerkatz @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi But that's sort of distinct from the question of the mandate itself. I mean, I'm open to idea that there is *some* effect on Medicaid. But the immediate ~5 mln # pushed by CBO is wildly off. Also, as I noted earlier in this thread, Medicaid enrollment doesn't
@StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi Yes, and I noted the GOP tax bill relied on the CBO's paper mandate savings in my piece.
@StevenTDennis @MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi I'm not forgetting that. However, even if they were forced to repeal fewer of the taxes in repeal/replace, they still would have started off with lower baseline for tax reform than they did having done nothing.
@BBKogan @MarcGoldwein @ernietedeschi If they got it down to 5-8 million, I think debate would have been dramatically different.
@BBKogan @MarcGoldwein @ernietedeschi So the problem was that any $ they added to try to address centrist concerns would piss off conservatives without changing coverage numbers enough to win over any centrists
@BBKogan @MarcGoldwein @ernietedeschi If the starting number were 10 million, I think they could have adjusted tax credits in a way that would have brought that number down into the single digits. But mandate assumptions were such that no matter how much money they added, they'd still get a massive coverage loss #
@MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi Yeah, I noted in the story that full effect in house version i looked at was 24mln and that they still would have shown more uninsured, just that # would have been less shocking and perhaps would have left more room to bridge divide with centrist holdouts
@MarcGoldwein @BBKogan @ernietedeschi Worth noting re: Medicaid, whatever the effect on # of signups, anybody eligible would be enrolled if they sought medical care. Also, a person's decision on Medicaid does not have the same ramifications on premiums/broader market as young/healthy decision to purchase insurance.

@allahpundit another way of thinking about it is that given that Thomas is going to be more conservative than anybody else, replacing him would be moving the court at least marginally to the left for the coming X number of years.

@allahpundit I get that. But the x factor is how many years. If he is otherwise forced to step  down in 2021, for instance, yeah. But if he's healthy for another 10-15 years? Those are a lot of decisions where his voice would be invaluable.
As the only black conservative on the Court, Thomas brings a unique perspective, as he did when he laid out historical origins of gun control among white southerners hoping to suppress slave rebellions, and black uprisings after the Civil War https://t.co/02BlL9FGEU
Thomas also has the x-factor of judicial courage. Basically, he doesn't give a toss what elites think. It's a crap shoot whether any replacement would. https://t.co/02BlL9FGEU
Thomas has been the most principled -- and consistent -- defender of the Constitution on the Court, more so than Scalia was.  https://t.co/02BlL9FGEU

Interesting way for a leading  Green New Deal activist to react to a column arguing that enacting a GND would require toppling the U.S. government and replacing it with one that suspends elections and declares emergency powers to transform economy for decades. https://t.co/FJECwN9o7w
So, to pass &amp; enact a Green New Deal, you'd basically need to topple the current government with a revolution,abolish the Senate, create a new system in which govt declared emergency powers for at least the few decades that it took to transform the economy https://t.co/yduQiTwp0W
Also, elections are held every two years, and unless you think a liberal Democratic majority will control government for a 10-20 year period, GND is gonna hit major roadblocks https://t.co/yduQiTwp0W
Any Green New Deal that gives more latitude to states and individuals will see less compliance. Any compliance regime with stricter mandates would invite more legal challenges and mean more backlash https://t.co/yduQiTwp0W
In addition, even if you enacted a Green New Deal in Congress, you couldn't implement as intended with current structure which gives deference to states and allows them and individuals to file legal challenges https://t.co/yduQiTwp0W
There is no way a Green New Deal passes without abolishing the Senate. Any government structure that gives veto power to a chamber with equal representation for smaller, coal-dependent states, won't let that happen. https://t.co/yduQiTwp0W

Green New Deal FAQ: "If Eisenhower wanted to build the interstate highway system today, people would ask how we’d pay for it." Federal Highway Administration's website: "Legislation failed in 1955 because of the financing issue." https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
Another important bit of context: During New Deal, WWII, interstate highway system, moon project, entitlements were much smaller so we had more flexibility. Now debt is entering unprecedented levels before a penny is spent on any GND. https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
World War II is the only thing that comes close to GND. However, while at peak defense spending had reached 37% of GDP, once war was over, it went down to 3.5% in 1948. GND imposes massive permanent spending obligations https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
The New Deal cost $653 billion in 2009 dollars. Even using a higher estimate, based on fact that it was 40% of GDP in 1929, you get to $8 trillion translated to today's GDP. That's 1/4 the cost of "Medicare for all." https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
At the peak of the interstate highway program, the federal government spent about one half of 1% of GDP on highways in one year. That would be the equivalent of $113 billion in today's GDP. https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
The entire cost of the Apollo moon program was about $225 billion in today's dollars. That wouldn't even cover the one year cost of the GND's federal job guarantee https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
Though there's no comprehensive cost analysis of the GND, even a few provisions bring its likely cost to tens of trillions of dollars. By comparison, moon landing, highway system, and even New Deal itself were much smaller https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv
There's a popular line of argument that if we went to the moon, did the New Deal, built the highway system, we can do the Green New Deal. This ignores reality that GND would be far more costly &amp; that we have less financial flexibility than in those eras https://t.co/UlfjHp99Kv

@charles_gaba I mean, obv, we disagree ideologically, but one thing I don't get from a selling perspective is that one of the reasons the $32T figure is so high is that the govt is absorbing costs of covering 150mln people whose coverage is currently paid for by employers....

@charles_gaba What did I exaggerate? I said there were 177 million on private insurance, I never said all would be satisfied. Even cited poll showing satisfaction numbers of 70%.
But the political calculation here is interesting -- Harris has decided that being unequivocal makes her come off as more honest &amp; confident + helps her with base, and that in a chaotic general election against Trump, it won't really hurt her much https://t.co/mElbL2Vtkv
Just last week, we had Kaiser poll in which support for "Medicare for all" drops to 37% (with 58% opposed) when people are told it would eliminate private insurance https://t.co/mElbL2DRVV
@leopold_josh it's a mix -- more people say they like Medicare/Medicaid coverage, fewer people with Medicare/Medicaid say they like the actual healthcare they receive
Worth noting: Gallup poll finds that 70% of those with private insurance rate their coverage as "excellent" or "good; 85% say the same about the actual healthcare that they receive. https://t.co/mElbL2DRVV

@CitizenCohn @chrislhayes I think the problem is the need to make a ruling every time. Some things are demonstrably false and should be ruled as such. But in other cases, it should basically be about providing more context to allow readers to determine whether a given statement was fair or not.
Fact-checkable statements: 	-- Studies have shown "Medicare for all" will cost $32 trillion over a decade	--The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other country		Non fact-checkable statements:	-- We believe healthcare is a right	--"Medicare for all" is a government takeover
@chrislhayes Challenge is that as much as each side complains about fact checkers when they disagree, they can't resist citing fact checks when the other side is labeled "pants on fire" or whatever.
I agree with @chrislhayes here &amp; I wish there could be some sort of bipartisan (or at least cross-ideological) agreement on this. Fact checks should look at objective, confirmable, facts rather than normative statements &amp; judgement calls. https://t.co/Ic0fJk02DG

Also worth noting that "M4A" is not technically giving Medicare to everybody. It's creating a new program and then shifting everybody into it, including Medicare beneficiaries. If Sanders can call this M4A, opponents can call it socialized healthcare https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg
But I don't think that's necessary given level of power and control government would have over providers, they would effectively cease to operate as private enterprises -- which is much of the point for liberals https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg
If you wanted to be very technical, you could indisputably call M4A a "socialized health insurance system" https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg
"socialized healthcare" is best thought of as a continuum. Sanders plan may be less socialist than UK, but gov would still pay for HC, fix prices, regulate providers, etc -- so it belongs on the spectrum https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg
A more narrow definition is that "socialized medicine" requires healthcare services to be both financed and delivered by the government.  But this runs into some problems, as even UK has private clinics https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg
OED definition of "socialized" is "financed with public funds, brought under public control" which is a pretty accurate description of what "Medicare for all" would do to healthcare system https://t.co/eY6LpVWyZg

@johngraves9 @LorenAdler The attraction for conservatives is that if you remove those with pre-ex from the broader pool and cover them separately, much easier to have freer market for the rest of population -- who are generally healthy enough to get relatively affordable insurance.

If you earn $50k (less than median income) you wouldn't qualify for subsidies &amp; premiums for silver plan would be $4500 per year. They would be significantly lower if they weren't forced to buy insurance with broader benefits &amp; forced to subsidize those with pre-ex https://t.co/ASz39zw3s4

@ryanlcooper I updated to add "relative to private insurance."
@ryanlcooper Last I checked, about 180 million people had private insurance.
The study that Sanders cites as showing his plan would reduce health spending by $6k per person was based on the 40% assumption. If you have a problem with the 40% assumption than take it up with Sanders for relying on this study for his cost claim. https://t.co/Qb4BIgTyje
Yes, because if government is insuring 330 million people and determining how much doctors and hospitals get paid, it won't exert control the provision of those services. https://t.co/aBmmQ22mxP
If government banned all restaurants and offered free food to all at government cafeterias, most people would see that as problematic even if there were circumstances under which it could reduce our national food budget https://t.co/04SZzLjZyM
Worth noting: The liberal Urban Institute, which made different assumptions about how much docs &amp; hospitals would be paid under Sanders, found it would increase national spending on HC by $6.6 trillion &amp; fed govt spending by $32 trillion https://t.co/04SZzLjZyM

@TheStalwart @cullenroche I am aware, along with the "FDR saved capitalism from itself" argument.
@BGrueskin @TheStalwart haha, would gladly do it! Though you may be the only audience.

From a small "r" republican perspective, I'm uncomfortable with the concept of the self-pardon while recognizing the constitutional questions are murky. Regardless, broader point is "legitimacy" is a subjective concept with no neutral arbiter. https://t.co/QjXiJanUBM

@guypbenson ah, forgot that for some reason. I guess the best you could say then is that Ford did have an accurate recollection of the crowd Kav hung out with that summer, without having had benefit of his calendar. But that doesn't tell us much.
@guypbenson Not nec. variant of the theory, which is that they pre-gamed at Timmy's, then went somewhere else. The area around the club was in between Rockville and Kav's. (Though this wouldn't answer timeline question as it would place 2nd gathering even later).
@carolfoxlover @allahpundit It isn't my theory. Just probing alternate possibilities.
@RepublicanDore @allahpundit She did not say what time. But fact that she said she had been at country club &amp; still had her suit on makes it less likely that it was super late. Not impossible though.
@aarond23 @allahpundit Yes, but the area surrounding country club is in between Rockville and Kav's house. Could he have stopped for a few "skis" somewhere else on the way home?
@allahpundit What about the theory that they pre-gamed at the party mentioned here, then drifted to somebody else's house? Ford said Judge &amp; Kav were noticeably more drunk -- would fit if they had already been drinking for hours.

@onceuponA As I note, not saying Dems can never gain popular support for impeachment. Just that they don't have it right now. If anything, fact that it took so long for public to get behind impeaching Nixon is further affirmation we're far away from that point, if we ever get there.

@chrislhayes @yeselson 2 ways to think about it. One is it's just a matter of where you'd draw the line as everybody has somebody they may not serve. Another is, is this something you consider as you decide whether to go into business? Would I be comfortable with idea I may serve people I don't like?
@yeselson For instance, I boycott a number of businesses, but not because I actually think I'm going to change their policies, just bc I don't want to give them my money.

DOJ is arguing:	1) Repeal of penalties makes mandate unconstitutional as of Jan. 1 since it is no longer a tax.	2) Striking down mandate means pre-ex related regs have to go on Jan 1. 	3) Rest of law can stay bc it can be separated.	https://t.co/e6OPmalYA6

@sam_baker @dylanlscott okay, then I just don't see how this would be violating norms rather than following Obama precedent.
@dylanlscott Still don't see how in terms of norms this is different from Obama DOJ refusing to defend DOMA. (And I say this as a skeptic of the latest challenge).

@nicholas_bagley and fwiw, I too, am skeptical about this particular challenge (on standing grounds alone).

@nicholas_bagley Why would this be different than Obama DOJ refusing to defend DOMA? Regardless of merits of the case or issue, DOMA was the law of the land?

@colinb1123 @sangerkatz @sarahcgchris @LorenAdler @johngraves9 That would be an interesting counterfactual.
@sangerkatz @sarahcgchris @LorenAdler @johngraves9 @colinb1123 Yes, that's my pt. Not arguing it played "no role." But at time of SCOTUS ruling, expert consensus was that market would be in total collapse w/out mandate, &amp; that informed justices. Consensus is much different now.
@sangerkatz @MHHmeyer @johngraves9 @LorenAdler @colinb1123 Clearly relevant to severability. Also, in practice I've always felt that Roberts was spooked by idea that ct decision could cause market chaos, nuke major legislation. Could see alt world where there's majority to kill mandate, maybe separate concurrence/dissent on severability
@johngraves9 @sangerkatz @LorenAdler @colinb1123 I keep wondering what would have happened if SCOTUS had benefit of more experience with mandate, bc tho we can argue of its role, clearly it's been less important than initially thought. Would Roberts be more willing to overturn? Kennedy less likely to say it's non-severable?
@LorenAdler @colinb1123 @johngraves9 @sangerkatz I remember Uwe Reinhardt had long argued the mandate was too weak, but if I recall his arguments were more based on intuition than hard data

@sangerkatz I mean, if they were talking about effects of repeal in 2012 vs. 2018, I can see the argument. But fact that they're saying it's bc "mandate has been in place for an additional year" seems a bit hard to swallow.

@pjdoland @ThePlumLineGS look, I agree it wasn't funny. But also not anything that should be surprising to those who booked her.
@ThePlumLineGS the whole idea of "let's yuk it up about how much you lie to us" is objectionable to me, no matter the administration.
@ThePlumLineGS I agree.That's why I have a problem with the whole dinner in the first place. I think journalists and those in power should have a naturally adversarial relationship. Doesn't mean they can't be civil, but lying is serious stuff. Getting together &amp; laughing about it trivializes it
@ThePlumLineGS You could argue that Obama folks lied to advance policy goals, yet this admin often lies brazenly about even pointless stuff (starting with inauguration crowd sizes)

@Apkamps @yeselson It's crystal clear he was talking about the Jews. Remember, his nominee for Defense Sec, Chuck Hagel, condemned the "Jewish lobby" but excuse was he really meant "Israel lobby"
@yeselson That is the classic, age old, anti-Semitic trope of a small minority exerting disproportionate &amp; nefarious influence.

Trump SOTU: 	--Throws in towel on Obamacare repeal	-- Wants to spend $1.5 trillion on infrastructure	-- Paid family leave	-- No entitlement reform
Not mentioned during Trump's speech: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security -- which account for $2 trillion in spending, or more than half of the federal budget.
Quick take: "Trump throws in towel on Obamacare repeal" https://t.co/BBsDHhp7OJ
In the same speech Trump touts end to individual mandate, he touts "paid family leave," which is effectively a mandate that workers accept lower salaries in exchange for more time off.
Trump touts mandate repeal to elide fact that Obamacare has survived. Tellingly, he doesn't reiterate call to repeal the rest of the law.

@JesseCharlesLee The threat of Iran gaining a nuke, even under best case scenario under deal, is merely delayed, while the deal empowered Iran conventionally. Your inability to grapple with the broader Iran threat says everything.
@JesseCharlesLee Not to mention the fact what Obama did to mainstream anti-Semitism in his attacks of critics of the Iran deal.
@JesseCharlesLee The Iran deal actually keeps Iran on a glide path to a nuke while making it a more powerful conventional threat, and Obama subverted U.S. interests in the middle east &amp; aided the evil regime there to lock his deal. It was catastrophic.
@JesseCharlesLee Obama's hostility toward Israel dated back years before he entered office, came out of the gate with the stated strategy of trying to create distance between U.S. and Israel to gain trust of Palestinians. This was clear before Bibi was even PM.

@ThePlumLineGS @chrislhayes I don't know. Looks like a fold to me with modest assurances from McConnell. But I look forward to reading your explanation of Dems thinking here.
@chrislhayes I guess what I'm saying is if starting position is, we want DACA deal so we aren't going along with R bill to fund govt. Then after gov shut down, they decided, Trump is intransigent, can't deal with him. Not sure how this gets them to better place than they were on Friday.
CHIP extension was in bill that Dems voted down on Friday, so either way, that would have been out of the way. So "clear win" was making next CR date Feb. 8th rather than Feb. 16th? I'm so confused. https://t.co/vZc7bKoHFP
@chrislhayes But if you think Trump won't agree to any deal how does holding a vote in the Senate change that dynamic? Trump has to sign something &amp; it has to pass the House.
Schumer said Trump wouldn't negotiate so he decided to cave into McConnell and give him the votes. Huh? Nothing about Schumer's strategy in this shutdown makes sense.

@yeselson @jbview @brianbeutler yes, at some point the anger and frustration of the bases and thirst for accomplishments will force it
@yeselson @brianbeutler @jbview My bet would be that the legislative filibuster is gone within the decade. Hard time seeing it living past McConnell's time as majority leader.
@yeselson @jbview and as I've said, if you want to say, McConnell/Rs are getting a taste of their own medicine, stick it to them. I can get that impulse.
@yeselson @jbview why do red state Dems not count? They have a bill that has majority support in both chambers. Your argument would be stronger if they got 9 Dem votes &amp; it was Rs that denied them supermajority
@jbview yes and no. when Rs filibustered during Obama admin, we'd speak of them blocking X. True, there were silly takes about if only he was LBJ he'd be able to magically get Congress to do his bidding.  But I at least never bought that.
@jbview Dems have made a conscious choice to argue that something extraneous to budget should be attached to a must-pass bill so as to maximize their leverage.
Here's the thing -- you can argue that Dems are *justified* in shutting down the government. But still acknowledge Dems are in fact shutting it down. https://t.co/WxOUpBolqw
So, with vote at 50-48 (without McConnell's vote &amp; McCain absent), clear there's a majority that supports GOP bill to keep govt open. But Dems near unanimous opposition will be enough to shut it down.
There will be a shutdown, but Rs close to a majority on this vote, if they get there it will figure into the spin war.
