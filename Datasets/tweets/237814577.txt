@HELL_ETC hello there m i've been listenin to you since i was a wee lad getting bullied in catholic school in 95!  you have a great path of raging against hypocrisy just like my King Jesus!  and He loves you so much although you probably hate being told that a million times a week.
RT @charliekirk11: This is Riley Heath		He goes to Princeton		He was assaulted by a socialist on campus last month		You can see the scar onâ€¦
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats if a person has a felony in there background they probably live in a n environment where they need a gun who are you to try and take that right away?  where in the constitution does it say if you have a felony no weapon it says every man and woman has right to bear arms.
@BriannaWu the point of the right to bear fire arms is to take back your goverment isf there is treason!  you gotta be ready to take these crackers to war when its time
@CharlesMBlow i don't get the humor he's probably not a racist and who cares if he is.  what a waste of time they can't find anything to impeach him on so they're now playing the race card cuz thats all that rat bitch cohen would give them!  lol as you say
@JamilSmith what a waste of time all created cuz rashida wanted to play the race card.  you can't impeach someone for being a racist cohens a rat bitch that folded that shit don't last in the streets race card race card race card waaaaaaa
@RepDavidEPrice why are you trying to destroy one of the foundations of america.  people that have backgrounds with criminal records obviously need guns.  everybusiness isn't soft like corporate america which i hit up everyday cuz they don't have guns.  so quit acting like you give a shit
@SpeakerPelosi you have security with guns is why you think shit is so sweet!  some people can't afford security or want to be there own security.  in the high school shootings guns don't hurt people bullying does.  someone can run in with a knife and then it would be way longer a death
@SpeakerPelosi the people that need guns are the ones have felonies.  everyone needs a gun.  what are you going to do call the police and sit in wait for an hour while people are threatening you at gun point or breaking in your house!  Having guns is an important right everyone should have!
