@acipollo @RepMarkMeadows I want to know what deal you think is good. You are the one stating and reinforcing his stellar dealmaking. Surely you had at least one deal in mind. You wouldn’t just blindly repeat a talking point without an example would you?
@DonaldJTrumpJr A committee run by Republican politicians does not produce an unbiased product.

@acipollo @RepMarkMeadows Yeah? What is a good deal he has made since he was elected?
Happy Valentines day, Twitter fam.🥰 We don't have to have a lover to be a lover. For those going out to celebrate, I hope you have good times. For those staying in alone or with fur babies, like me, I hope we have good times too.
@siano2020 @Ashluelaroe I didn’t know it until now and it makes no difference to me. I only care about sexuality if I find out someone isn’t into consent.

@RepMarkMeadows Or maybe your 'deal maker' leader proves yet again that he has no clue how to make a deal. The original offer was over $20B and he finagled it all the way down to less than $2B. What do you expect from a man who pays $120K for a single sexual encounter?
@siano2020 Valentines Day is for kids. You are grown. Treat yourself to a margarita or something else fun. My fiance doesn't care about Valentine's day, and that is one of the things that makes us a good match. Also, I love your tweets. That is a form of love right?

@EveODestruction @RepMarkMeadows Yeah, with an ankle bracelet and a court date. Then they are tracked and can stay with family or friends and take care of their own food, shelter, healthcare, etc. It doesn't make sense for us to foot the bill without a reason to be suspicious that they are dangerous.
@EveODestruction @RepMarkMeadows Some of them are that, but there are also a lot of asylum seekers. They are not breaking the law by presenting themselves at a legal port to ask for asylum.

@CherryCorday @FairenoughMac @CampbellCinema @emrazz You are very knowledgeable, Cherry. Do you have expertise or is it an interest of yours. I appreciate your comments.
@FairenoughMac @CampbellCinema @emrazz Mourning a miscarriage is because someone wanted a baby and got their hopes up with a pregnancy.  No one mourns a fetus like they would mourn a person. A person is a being who can suffer and love and influence an have dependents. No comparison between a person and a fetus.
@FairenoughMac @CherryCorday @CampbellCinema @emrazz I blame our shitty healthcare system. Decisions are made on cost not care. Most of issues with reproduction and abortion affect the most vulnerable Americans because healthcare is not seen as a human right.
@MKGenest Part of it is a struggle for relevance in  the male role of reproduction. Their contribution is so small. Crediting conception as the beginning of life is like crediting a pen for passing a law. Yes it is critical but didn’t do the real work.
@FairenoughMac @CampbellCinema @emrazz It can’t live by itself. It is arguable. Defining life at conception is more about our hangups with sexuality. Hangups with sexuality are the red herring used to harm women and deny us our privacy and agency. Pro choice laws protect us from this. “Pro abortion” does not exist.
@TomthunkitsMind This is old news, but I never get tired of hearing about “exotic sexual groups”.
@FairenoughMac @CampbellCinema @emrazz It is totally arguable, and even if you want to define a fetus as alive, then denying access to abortion doesn’t end abortion. It just makes an abortion more likely to end two lives instead of one. There is no basis of ethics that can defend ending two lives instead of one.

@joshua_lehner @staylor3113 @charliekirk11 @GOP Agreed.

How many are crossing illegally at non ports of entry, and what is their cost to the US?
@joshua_lehner @staylor3113 @charliekirk11 @GOP It is the number of people who cross the border illegally at ports of entery, are apprehended, and sent back. So those ~500K people per year aren't in the US. The issue is already being handled. A wall would still mean those people will still attempt to enter and be turned away.

@Jim_Jordan @ShannonBream Not even true. @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi suggested border security that would be more effective than a wall. If the wall proposal is so great, take a break from protecting sexual predators and produce some numbers for Americans. Give us a CBA or a payback period for a wall.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Name calling is a sign of weakness. You know @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer made excellent points in support of effective border security. You probably also know you are backing a man who has never really succeeded at anything. You are cornered so you are all “nu-uh, liar!”

This is just a distraction from the Mueller investigation. All these people who contribute to American safety, security, and general business of being a country are being held hostage by a president who wants us to look away from his criminal associations.
@SteveScalise So fix it if there is a problem. Prove to us a wall will be effective with some basic due diligence. Stop holding the government hostage because once again @GOP didn’t do their homework before crafting policy.
@metoosurvival Now you are putting words in my mouth and talking in circles. I made my points. Take care, Metoo.

Yes. A reasonable person will act happy while being abused and held captive in order to survive. Then will tell their story in the pursuit of justice when they feel safe. Why so defensive on something as ethically simple as child molesting and human enslavement? https://t.co/tfhvPaeRsS
@joshua_lehner @staylor3113 @charliekirk11 It doesn’t work like this. If you want to spend money on a solution for a problem, you have to sell the solution.  @GOP has not done basic due diligence. Where’s the CBA? What is the payback period? Why do you believe it will be worth the spend?
@conductress @emrazz I am impressed you are a conductor. That is a super cool gig. Part dance, part musician.
@MadVickie @metoosurvival @Nu20Beauty @TMZ That is solid math , Vickie.
@metoosurvival @MadVickie @Nu20Beauty @TMZ You can lie to me, but you are lying to yourself too right now. You are saying they are not competent to speak and act on their own experiences. By your definition, you are denying them agency.
@metoosurvival @MadVickie @Nu20Beauty @TMZ We already gave him a voice when he peed and degraded a child on film. Giving him that voice made him free to harm and degrade more children. Giving him a voice fails society and his next victims. So give him a voice if you want, but you are enabling a child molester.
@metoosurvival @MadVickie @Nu20Beauty @TMZ OMG!!!  Calling someone a liar is the exact definition of denying a person their agency. Seriously. Think a little and stop with the rapid fire tweets.
@metoosurvival @MadVickie @Nu20Beauty @TMZ You want to give voice to a serial sexual predator? That is justice in your eyes? To continue to give a voice and a platform to someone who clearly harms children and women?
@metoosurvival @MadVickie @Nu20Beauty @TMZ You are claiming to know what is in the picture too. But your claim is “what happens in the picture” - “women’s claim of trauma”. Mine is “picture”+”women’s claim”. You can’t say you support women’s agency while denying their claim.
@metoosurvival @Nu20Beauty @TMZ Yes but you are looking at actions to find clues to deny their claims. And you are doing it with no sign of any sort of qualifications for judging the actions of trauma sufferers. People react to trauma in all kinds of ways. They were doing what they needed to do to survive.
@metoosurvival @Nu20Beauty @TMZ No it doesn’t. These women came forward to accuse him of committing crimes against them. That is their agency. Their claim is they were denied agency by being held captive by RKelly. Acting like you are a mind reader rather than listening to their words denies their agency.
@metoosurvival @Nu20Beauty @TMZ I’m threatened because it is exactly this narrative of “look she likes it” that denies women justice and dignity where sexual assault is an issue. It is very fucking threatening because this narrative is common before the predator gets off and the violence is swept under the rug.
@Nu20Beauty @metoosurvival @TMZ ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻This!!!  What does anyone have to wonder? The victims told us what happened. Don’t wonder #ListenToWomen
@charliekirk11 Yes. How dare we fund healthcare that protects the safety, privacy, and dignity of women instead of funding an ineffective wall that is clearly a mechanism to funnel more tax dollars into Trump family coffers.
@emrazz Wait a minute. Does this mean they hate women?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This is provably false. Many Dems have expressed support for border security and immigration reform. 	@GOP has not made a case for the wall. Can’t you guys do some basic due diligence to prove effectiveness? Can America get a CBA? No one cares about feelings. We want numbers.

@ComfortablySmug AOC is great, but no harm in letting the paint dry a bit. She is still but a freshman, and this is their first go at rebutting him. How will they "rebut" the ramblings of a senile, old man? You know he is going to ramble all over the board.
@rudepundit @AOC Yeah, I am suspicious that the only similarities between these two women is that they both won elections, and Max thinks they are both hot.
@kylegriffin1 How will they rebut loony ramblings of a senile old man?
@janneypanet @MaxBoot @PostOpinions @GOP I am suspicious the only similarity Max really had in mind in writing this "comparison" of Palin and AOC is through the straight male lens. He just thinks they are both hot and backed into this comparison with that as his only initial thought.
@DonaldJTrumpJr There are a lot more stories about Americans affected by the gun violence of other Americans. This is not about American safety. It is about your father getting reelected by creating fat government construction contracts to funnel into you and your buddies wealth.
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions I don't see the similarities, and you only compare Palin in the last paragraph as an after thought. Palin isn't idealistic. She is a company "man" for the @GOP sticking to their talking points. AOC is progressive creating new talking points for her peers to follow or not.

@DShah26 @rickwtyler Thanks so much. Followed.
@johndrewsmom Thanks so much. I was actually already following him.
@AngryBlackLady @ANSFreeman I grew up with 4 siblings, and I fucking love being alone. I am 41 and engaged for the first time. Mostly lived on my own for all my adulthood. So I get everything you are saying. Also, I get that needing others is something that makes us stronger, so I understand your journey.

@kelceeyy @Bennythesnitch He sounds creepy. You can do better.  You would be better on your own even.
@TheRynheart @LindseyGrahamSC Why do they keep talking about themselves all the time? HELLOOOOO!! American people here. You work for us, remember? No one gives a shit about your careers except you. We just need you to use our money in ways that benefit us. Not your own interests. @LindseyGrahamSC
@charliekirk11 What does it matter who is rich and who isn't? Good policy is just good policy and contributes to the security and fulfillment of all Americans. @GOP seems to think they only need to protect and nurture the well being of a subset of Americans while controlling the rest.

@RealJamesWoods Who reads Brietbart and thinks it is true? You are like my grandmother quoting The Enquirer. This is just meant for entertainment. Not beholden to accuracy in the slightest.
@GOP @SteveScalise Did they try pulling together a meeting or a conference call with Dems? If so this is a valid point. If all they did was sit in their offices and tweet and talk privately about how the president is crazy while failing to do anything publicly to remove him, then no dice, guys.
@HenryPorters @AngryBlackLady I am the same way as you, Henry. I have my own mental health struggles, and just out of self preservation have to limit times with friends who have theirs. We are all just humans, and I can only hope they don't see it as me abandoning them.
@tonyposnanski Why do conservatives have such a twisted view of poverty? Children living below the poverty line can mow lawns and babysit to buy trendy fashion too? They seem to think poverty means sitting on a dirt floor, eating beans from a can, wearing rags and being grateful for it.
@PGHomes @tonyposnanski @AOC I saved my babysitting money to buy a pair of these when I was a kid. They were $40, and my family picked on me. I loved them so much, though. Wore them on most days. Totally worth the 40 bucks.

@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee In a few months at the same rate it would still be less than 5%. If that rate sustains it would take nearly 6 years to raise the funds. And then you would have to raise O&amp;M was very year.
@QueenMab87 It is moot right now in light of his being a predator, but he has a really good bit on his show, Louis, where a Millenial doesn’t want to show him some pots in a store, and she owns him over it. I hate that he hasn’t managed a way to make his sexual assault stuff right.
@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee The budget ask for a wall is $5Billion.  So while $17million is an impressive amount of money, it is less than 1% of the budget ask. The GoFundMe will be a failure and the people who gave money will be shammed.
@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee Do you think a wall will change that?
@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee I agree, but that doesn’t come from a wall. It comes from qualified people and innovative policies.
@PoliticalEmilia She should give it a go if she wants to. I don’t think she would make it out of the primary. Is that why you have strong feelings? She might be the final nominee?

@CBSNews I am cool with that. The MAGA crowd isn't going to be satisfied with a metaphor though.

@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee See you are still making assumptions. I never said any of that stuff. Neither have any Dem leadership I have seen.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It is called Democracy. The people voted, and we don’t think this is a good use of our tax dollars. Imagine all the issues just getting it built? The invasion on people’s private land. All this with no proof that a wall will have much affect. It is dumb. Let it go.
@vermeerish @OhNoSheTwitnt I used to consider him a feminist because he nailed empathy for women in his work. I guess he learned it from parenting daughters after he ruined women's careers. He suffered one whole year. Those women will never know what their careers could have been.

@MitziSzemeth @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee You said it is “interesting this is not a concern to you”. In plain English you made a claim that I am not concerned about this. If it were a general statement you would have said ‘people’ or ‘folks’ instead of ‘you’. Why do you think you can backtrack when it is here in writing?
@lbsck1 @MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee What is your source for all of that info? Did you get that from the State Department? They put out an annual trafficking persons report. Did you get your info from one of those reports?

@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee What about trafficking from Europe, Asia, or Africa? How would a wall address trafficking from those continents?
@KurtSchlichter Tell me more about how you come off? I wouldn't know. Only you can possibly know how you come off to other people.
@MenopnyG @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee Trafficking does not characterize most illegal immigration. Most illegal immigration is people over staying visa's who got here by plane. As for human trafficking, it happens in lots of ways. Planes, boats, ships, sometimes walking. I explained without making accusations at you.
@KurtSchlichter I think others have to describe you or your work as woke. When you say it about yourself or your own work, it just comes off as desperate.

@Tobymare @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee A wall falls under the definition of infrastructure. It would be a massive capital spend with years of O&amp;M burden just to address a fraction of immigration in a handful of states. Do you think a wall would be better than comprehensive reform addressing all states?
@MitziSzemeth @bmaloney7861 @RepBarbaraLee Beefing up administration so the process to legally seek asylum is not arbitrary and includes all points of entry like airports, states along southern and northern borders and coastlines would be less effective than a wall that only impacts states on the southern border?

If Christians want to define life at conception then stop putting this on women. Conception is literally the only thing men do for reproduction. If you really are committed to this definition, then it is up to men to stop causing pregnancies that put their partner at risk. https://t.co/osNqNNJXtv
@TalbertSwan Ewww no. Please, respect women’s privacy, and talk to your boys and yourselves about condoms. By your definition men cause pregnancy. Men need to stop causing pregnancy unless they are certain it doesn’t put their partner into a crisis.
@MaxKennerly @emrazz I would have a ton of sex. Men in women’s bodies would make more sex available to men, maybe. I don’t know actually. Would men be as into sex if it were reversed? Anyway testing that out seems the best use of my time as a man in a world of men in women’s bodies.

@Vegonly @JAMESD757 @USMCLiberal I want to like this thread multiple times. This is exactly it. The MAGA’s repeat talking points, and that is it.

@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth Wow. You really just don't want to listen or understand do you? Just because I am satisfied now, does not mean I haven't faced discrimination and under payment in the past. And it isn't about me or you, it is about the overall, collective experience and payment of women.
@DEADCLOWN45ACP @TimRunsHisMouth Well if it is illegal than check that box all done there. Tell that to the 15th Amendment between the years of 1870 and 1965.
@EijaJacobsen @GovMikeHuckabee What is she stupid and ignorant about?
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth I am not underpaid, for the record. I just used my experience to demonstrate the career navigation constraints that contribute to the pay gap number. Nothing I said was unique to me, and I most women who work can relate. I am not surprised that you don't understand.
@GovMikeHuckabee When is the last time you ran a campaign and won an election? Why are all you old white men so obsessed with her anyway? So she takes a break after reaching a huge goal. Why do you care so much?
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth Well we agree on that then. The 77% number represents a widespread systemic discrimination that cannot be hidden.
@onepinkpuss @BoznangoDennis @TimRunsHisMouth Then it was totally worth it. Followed you back. 😊
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth And go where? Another male dominated company? Or switch to a female dominated industry and forfeit my 15 years of experience I have invested and all the expertise I have built? You will never understand discrimination as long as you apply it to your experience and your choices.
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth Crimes is a super strong word. I prefer tendencies. More accurate. The experience is less dramatic and more subconscious on an individual scale, but scale it up to society and you have a discriminatory pay gap. But I am getting the feeling you don't want to understand, Dennis.
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth And if I pursued it, I would need a ton of proof. And then I would be black balled as a trouble maker forfeiting everything I have invested into my career including education and experience. White men don't have to navigate these things, so I am not surprised you don't understand
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth You aren't listening. I am used to that since I work in a male dominated industry. We don't have as many choices as men. We aren't rewarded for our equal work with raises and promotions like men. As long as the divide is along gender lines, it is discrimination.
@PassTheSalty Donate to Planned Parenthood in their names. They will get a cool post card thanking them for the generosity.
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth If I choose to be promoted, but a lesser qualified man is promoted instead of me, because it is men making the promotion decisions and they just have a weird feeling about promoting me, can't quite figure out why...Then I have been discriminated against and will earn less money.
@ida_skibenes Jimmy Stewart is one of my all time favorites. Not his best film, but just because he is in it, I vote yes to watching it.		If that turns you onto him, try Anatomy of a Murder? Great movie that holds up today IMO.
Good news, ladies. There is no wage gap and we are not being descriminated against. https://t.co/fp2KcUyIMG
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth As long as it is divided along gender lines, then it is discrimination. The interpretation is that women's choices are less valued than men's choices, therefore women's work is less valued than men's work. We need men and women to be equally valued to have equity.
@BoznangoDennis @onepinkpuss @TimRunsHisMouth If these things are also divided along gender lines, then doesn't that still point to a wage gap driven by gender?

@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN We all benefit from roads, education, regulation, clean air and water, etc. your characterization is overly simple with no proof. If poor people in America are getting all the tax dollars, why is social mobility so low right now? Where is your proof for this claim you make?

@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN Wealth redistribution means we pool our money for public good like roads, bridges, national defense, you know. All the first world shit that makes this a respectable country.
@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN Classism is about deminishing social mobility. It is not an issue of taking from one to give to another. Wealth redistribution is a function of society, but everyone pays a fair share so it cannot be classified as wealth transfer.

@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN We can control or at least influence why options are reduced. It is a matter of- as a society - deciding whether we want to reward achievement or inherited social class. You demonstrate you understand how it currently works, but you don’t state what is the best way to prioritize.
@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN So you admit her options being reduced because of her parents socioeconomic status. You admit her potential for success, fit, and achievement does not play a role. That is exactly the point of tweet. Everybody loses in a society that does not reward achievement over classism.
@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN A quick Google doesn't really confirm anything does it? It is just a quick Google.
@emrazz She paid the ultimate price, and our government isolated her from her parents, so they couldn't protect her. #AbolishICE
@liberalheresy @Osmungw @IlhanMN If she is more likely to drop out isolated in an off campus apartment, then her chances of "going to college" diminish. Off campus is something students do after they have made friends at school they can trust sharing an apartment with. "Princess" is a sexist and derogatory term.

@TakNewGirl @OliverSchick2 @queerBengali You nailed it. That is what it has always been about.

@samstein @RudyGiuliani a 7 year old died in ICE custody because she was so neglected she didn't get any water to drink. @HillaryClinton and the American people were robbed of the president we voted for. So yeah, there has been death and robbery. You should advise your client to resign.

@DonLemonada Yeah. I get so tired of talking about abortion too. I wish we could just move on from this topic as a society and focus efforts instead on supporting Americans who start families with the resources needed to raise productive, healthy adults.
@DonLemonada @a1exkh Not everyone believes in a god, and the law promises equity. Life doesn’t happen in an instant and fetuses don’t have self awareness or suffer. It is up to every woman to sort this out for herself. If men had wombs I would stand for their privacy too.
@DonLemonada @a1exkh Is it about defining life? Or is it about giving women the same privacy to make choices about reproduction that men get? Men are not compelled by law to risk their lives or health for their offspring. It is unfair to put that burden only on women.
@DonLemonada @CNN That is always the issue with pro lifers. They only care until they have forced the mother into birth. That side of the politics does not support social safety nets or access to healthcare or day care. With more resources maybe this situation would not have felt so desperate.
@DonLemonada @CNN Pro-choice is about compassion and respect for the person with the womb. In this case the person with the womb is a huge and tragic loss to her family. Also, she suffered at the hands of someone who she trusted. Where does your compassion lie, Don?
@DonLemonada @CNN This is very sad. Maybe pro-choice people are too compassionate to make this family’s terrible tragedy into a political issue. I am so sad thinking what she went through and what her family has to cope with now. Very senseless loss.

@The_SmockingGun @emrazz Thank you for sharing this. I believe it. We all know the stories from high school. The women don’t seek justice. I am certain it is because they know the only witnesses were complicit in their attack, and everyone would take the side of the men. Girls are unsafe in America.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I think the industries are calling that a skills gap. It is because the American education system doesn’t prepare individuals for the work force. Recruiters can’t find qualified individuals to fill their vacancies.
@GOP What about #CyntoiaBrown? She is a victim of a child sex crime and she was just sentenced to 51 years for defending herself against her captor? Will the @GOP or @realDonaldTrump take up her cause for justice?

American soldiers fight and die to uphold our democracy, and he will never be a credit to their ultimate sacrifice.

@TinFurs @petitpolatouche @emrazz I think a lot of them hear it eventually. Old bf’s have reached out to me to let me know, and it has meant a lot to me. This is why feminism is not about “hating men”. Feminism is the commitment to the belief that we can share this space equitably.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What? Didn't she say something about D-day as an example of our partnership with Germany? She literally didn't understand that it was an American attack on Germany. I think my 11 yo niece understands that. She is going to make a fool of Americans.
@Eerop4ever Disagree. Churches are havens for inequality, especially along gender lines. But we are talking in circles. I have already covered that.
@EdKrassen I really want that so bad, but my gut is like nope. America is too broken to get this fool out of power.
@Eerop4ever The necessity is calling out injustice where I see it. It is the only route to liberty and equality for all people.
@Eerop4ever I don’t understand what you are trying to say. But I totally respect that you speak more than one language, Joy.
@RudyGiuliani He tweets and plays golf all the time. I think he can make a little time to preserve the integrity of our democracy.  If not then he should resign. He doesn’t have to be president if he doesn’t want to. What is Putin really gonna do about it?
@Eerop4ever No thanks. I stay away from organizations that abuse children and promote systemic misogyny. My goals are equality and justice and sadly, the modern Catholic Church represents neither of those values.
@TravisAllen02 I’d much rather people learn empathy and boundaries and not assume anyone gives a shit about their religion.
@Eerop4ever No they aren't and no she wasn't. She was popular, but she held no position of official leadership in the church. Nor would she have had any opportunity to be promoted to Pope or Cardinal even with all she did for the Church and the people. Plus she has been dead for 20 years.
@WalshFreedom Yes. No. Yes.
@Eerop4ever Do you have a chart of the women leaders in the Catholic Church? How many female Popes? Cardinals? Bishops? How many female Catholics even have a say in the Pope? Also, what Catholic doctrine attempts to interfere in men’s healthcare choices? Do you have a chart for that?

@lambdawon If you want people to take an interest in your spirituality, you have to behave in a way that is a role model to others. Trying to convert those who didn't ask works against your goal.

@TweetFiction @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt Every business's main motive is to make money. Without profit, they cease to exist. There are other motives for energy.

@Donavan188 @CaptGravy @LaszloStollar @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt I think CaptGravy is pointing out that it is naive to think it is even possible to keep oil money out of committee. So they don't accept money from energy company PACs. They have to raise money somehow. What about the millions of individuals who work in energy companies?
@factsimile1 @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt I'm flattered that you think I have the kind of influence to pull off a large information campaign to prove efforts and barriers energy companies face in renewable energy development, but alas I do not. I've given you the information as I see it. What you do with it is up to you.
@LaszloStollar @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt It already is very heavily regulated. What I am saying is that as a society and economy the government should leverage knowledge and infrastructure we have already invested in to promote renewable energy. To squeeze all of that out and start from scratch would be a huge waste.
@LaszloStollar @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt It is not as easy as you think. There are honest and legitimate barriers to overcome in renewable energy markets. And the industry is already very heavily regulated. The access and knowledge are there, and it would be productive to keep energy companies at the table.
@LaszloStollar @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt It is not a good vs. evil issue. It is a matter of resources. Energy companies have the resources and knowledge and access to customers to prop up renewable energy markets. Renewable energy markets will not thrive at the destruction of traditional energy companies.
@Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt I really wish you would not exclude energy companies. Many of us in traditional energy companies work to advance renewable energy markets too. We are not the evil empire we are made out to be.

@yourfeminstboss This is why rape victims don’t come forward. She would have been better internalizing, getting therapy, probably a drug habit to cope with her rape PTSD. Now she also has to deal with the trauma of a group of people, representing her society, ruling she deserved it to be raped.
@nytimes And let’s be honest. What is in that bill? It is either fat govmt contracts for friends of the Trumps or some sort of tax break for the rich. Those are the only outcomes of @GOP sponsored bills. They don’t actually work for a better country.
@realDonaldTrump How is that epic? Republicans already controlled the senate. A few more seats doesn’t change the power in any way. It is blue on black, tears on a river, a push on a shove. It don’t mean much.

@AlderWode @huntsvillealcoc @aldotcom @ALcomHuntsville Yeah, my folks are in AL. I have a great time when I visit. Beautiful place and really nice people. I don't understand why they are so cruel when they vote.
@NikkiMcR @Ocasio2018 It's telling that working class folks watch this and support it. They couldn't get an apartment in DC either. They are supporting people who would ridicule them if they ran for office and won too.
@PollackHunter @AndrewPollackFL You are taking back democracy by protesting American's votes being counted? Who are you taking democracy back from?

@GOP @ScottforFlorida You're fighting votes being counted? You seriously think the American people will support this?
@ejrtairne @Dirtiest_Birds @stevefambro @Ocasio2018 @FoxNews Yeah, that is creepy, personal stuff. No one ever talks about the cost of men's suits. She wears what she chose to wear, and that is her business. She makes a good point that access to power and government have the prerequisite of privilege built in. That inhibits democracy
So to get this straight. The @GOP theory is that Broward County, who hasn't swung their way since the 80's, delayed vote counting so they could forge a bunch of votes for the Dem ticket? They want us to believe Broward County voted Red, and this is a cover up?
@realDonaldTrump This is nuts. Your position is to NOT count American's votes? That is how a democracy works. It is everyone's right to vote, and counting their vote is pretty much the whole point of it. If their votes are not counted, you have denied their American rights.
@realDonaldTrump My ancestors were asylum seekers 200 years ago. Your policies at the border are a travesty to most Americans and American allies. Immigration and asylum is part of what makes America great. These folks are ready to work. Let them get to work. What is seriously wrong with you?

RT @OhNoSheTwitnt: EVERY SINGLE MASS SHOOTER HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN WHY IS THIS NOT A RED FLAG BY NOW
@WalshFreedom You are contradicting yourself. If it is truly wrong and dangerous then naturally it leads to violence. If we do things wrong and dangerous that lead to violence, especially when entrusted with the highest office in the country, we are responsible.
@SallyHawker12 @MichaelAvenatti @KamalaHarris I came here to say the same thing. Kamala is so calm, aggressive, and knowledgeable  when she argues. She would be a great candidate to knock out Trump.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 If they are looking to fix their woman problem, maybe don't listen to Lindsey Graham. That would be a good first step. Maybe listen to an actual woman saying stuff about women, and Kellyanne doesn't count because she doesn't make any sense when she talks.
@AidenWolfe I love your posts. I can't stand the "both sides" narrative, and I am not biased towards Dems. Shit is really fucked up right now, and your intelligent anger validates that every day.
@REPsmile @Tbiets77 @ScottforFlorida You understand that Rick Scott is trying to block these people's votes being counted right? That is the corruption. Democracy is not about picking and choosing who votes. All votes matter. The people got their votes in, and they should be counted.
@marcorubio I don't think Americans care about that. Our concern is whether or not the voter got his/her vote on time. If you really wanted to serve the people, that is what you would care about too, not this bureaucratic BS.

@marcorubio You are working to erode the free press and American's 1st Amendment rights. That will be your legacy. You had a choice to uphold American institutions and freedoms or to act as a puppet to a madman elected by a minority of Americans. You chose the unpopular madman.

To silent White people. You don't get to pretend to be a good person if you don't oppose racism. You are not savvy for avoiding politics because you know we won't agree. I see you failing to acknowledge real pain of racism because you won't suffer minor pain of being challenged.
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump You realize you are openly supporting racist voter suppression with this Tweet and photo. An honest victory deserves congratulations, but all the attempts to silence and inconvenience minorities and working class didn't fool Americans. We see you for what you are.

@shannon_deisen @androidqueen @JillFilipovic That is a good point, Shannon. I have these women and men in my family from the South. They are a lost cause.

@t0nit0ne I've heard this from friends as well. In the context of the Kavanaugh hearings. They witnessed girls being mistreated by their friends, but they would never be a witness if she sought justice. "Good men" operate under this reasoning. We are not fully human to them.

@MrFudd1 @kevin_gille @Kserasera3 @SenGillibrand Adnon Sayed. He is sitting in jail based on the testimony of a single eye witness. Andre Hatchett served 25 years based on a single eye witness testimony. That's two, so take your pick.
@kevin_gille @Walt_Mahopac @Kserasera3 @SenGillibrand No one denied it. They just didn't confirm it. There is a difference. The fact that they couldn't confirm it fits Dr. Ford's testimony that other than her being assaulted, the party was not extraordinary or memorable in any way.
@Walt_Mahopac @kevin_gille @Kserasera3 @SenGillibrand She gave a ton of details including a clinical explanation about neuro transmitters implanting details of trauma. But we all knew he would be confirmed anyway. Everyone thinks they care about children being sexually assaulted until it is time to hold their assaulter accountable.
@kevin_gille @Kserasera3 @SenGillibrand No points for originality, Coco. Also, you’re not your. English language too tough for a big, smart man? You’ve only been speaking it your entire life, and you haven’t mastered it yet?
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump They signed a paper full of platitudes authored by an unqualified agent appointed by nepotism with ties to a foreign leader who brutally murdered a WaPo journalist. I've no doubt that agreement is only worth the ink and paper used to draft it. Completely inconsequential.
@kevin_gille @Kserasera3 @SenGillibrand Credible testimony IS evidence. There are men and women sitting in prison based on less evidence than was presented in the #Kavanaugh hearings. And prison was never even on the table for him, AND he still was promoted to our highest court.

@SenGillibrand I hope we make up 100% of Congress in my lifetime. The whole system is set up for dudes with us as an afterthought. 200 years with a 100% female leadership would be enough to even things out.
@ACLU Is there a caravan of attorneys that could intercept the caravan of migrants? Then when the troops are poised to intimidate vulnerable families with children in strollers, they are instead met with a bunch of attorneys ready to negotiate entry for their clients.

@Real_Derek_R You would think, but reality is different than that. The cost to taxpayers is significantly more to carry out strong arm policies. Before immigrants were given a tracking device and court date so they procured their own housing and food. Now they are detained at taxpayer expense.

@emerek85 @SniffitSnippets @mediapostate @LedishvaPat @jwmangrum @i_am_noam @eligit @mkraju @Arianedevogue There were multiple claims. That is corroboration on his character and activities. Sexual assault usually only has 1 witness, the victim. Multiple credible women making similar claims is credible. It would be credible if they were men with the same resumes making the same claims.
@issuemaverick @gatewaypundit I looked but it doesn’t matter. It’s not a credible source. That story might be true. Might not be true. No way to know. I doubt snopes would even investigate such an inconsequential story.

@issuemaverick @kyconroy @womensmarch It was only a matter of time until I got a whatabout Obama. Why do you think anyone but Obama and/or the Dem leadership from 10 years ago can answer that question? Unless they ever spoke to the press about why they didn't do something, how would I know that?
@issuemaverick I believe stuff that is reasonable. You have yet to make a reasonable point. I have been very reasoned in my points I am making to you.
@issuemaverick Not from my perspective. I refuse to accept "improvement" as an excuse to accept inequality in 2018. There is either justice and equality or there isn't.
@issuemaverick That is not proof of equality. The unemployment stat only takes into account those with jobs and those without jobs who are actively looking. It leaves out the people who could work but don't, and doesn't take into account underemployment or pay inequality.
@issuemaverick No it isn't. I wish you were truthful, but recent months have been a litmus test for equality, and it doesn't look good. Other countries have achieved much more than the US when it comes to equality.
@Sassycatz @studiocafebleu @mkraju @Arianedevogue I was thinking the same thing. What has made Chuck Grassley so confident all of a sudden? Is it because he tested and proved the theory that he can control the scope of an FBI investigation?
@emerek85 @SniffitSnippets @jwmangrum @LedishvaPat @i_am_noam @eligit @mkraju @Arianedevogue He lied about getting into Yale on his own with no connections. Super easy to prove that he was a legacy by way of his grandfather. That is just a bold-faced lie, and there was no reason for him to lie about that. Just shows that he has no problem lying under oath.
@issuemaverick Everyone wants equality. I am not asking for help or favors. I just want encumbrances removed so we are on an equal playing field. A meritocracy instead of a patriarchy.

@issuemaverick @womensmarch The US immigration system is arbitrary and ineffective.

@mgsylvestre We would be more competitive when it comes to pay if we weren't suffering PTSD from our sexual assaults. And we would be even more competitive if we didn't have to navigate sexual harassment in the work place. That shit is death to your career and very degrading.
@lindeeloo_who What an idiot. And @FoxNews is the only one who cracked the code on that? No other major news organizations are reporting this. No BBC, AlJazeera, NPR. Not one of them thought this story would be worth reporting?
@mgsylvestre Totally agree, but the post is meant as hyperbole to illuminate the ridiculous idea that there would be evidence of a sexual assault besides the victim's testimony. Until we have real, social change that provides justice for assault, women will not have equality.

This whole "both sides" violence apologist rhetoric needs to stop. I have never heard a Dem leader claim the best political strategy is to throw the first punch. Throwing the first and most negative punch is @GOP's standard playbook. That is why the pipe bombs only went to Dems.
@LeslieMac This is so true. I am sorry for all I have offended along my journey and am grateful to have Black friends. So much patience and sympathy has been shown me, when probably I deserved to be burnt to the ground. I carry the messaging to other white folks to pay it forward.
Conservative white men have believed their own hype for so long that they don't see the same reality the rest of us see. They live in an alternate reality where everything they do is right and effective, even if it is wrong and irrelevant.
@battletested5 That sounds like something you say about a new person in the office who needs coaching, not the fucking @POTUS . He already needs to be up to snuff to hold the position. Why does anyone support him?
@DaddyDaddymac I agree. It's because deep down we know everyone works hard and much of the"achievement" we treasure is from our white privilege. If everyone is given a fair shot, will we be mediocre by comparison? Many white folks see it as a zero sum game instead of a rising tide for society.

@MrDapperton Every successful person has their occasional flops. She's still rich AF from her work as a comedian. Also, doesn't take away that the slut stuff is her shtick. A role she plays, and it fooled you somehow.
@MrDapperton It's funny how people in the replies are like "ohh you can't take a joke", but fail to point out that Amy Schumer is a successful, professional comedian, and the slut stuff is her shtick. So you don't really get the joke if you think you know anything about her sex life.

@despanol203 @Wendys_Garden @DavidYankovich Ummm Wow. Gaslight much? "Dim" is name calling. Slang implying people in the Democratic party are dumb. And xenophobia is an actual word for an actual thing. Many people throughout history have been unjustly and often severely punished because of xenophobia.
@ICallahan1966 @PHMorrill @juliaioffe Yep. You cracked the code. You are so smart. Give yourself a raise and an honorary PhD, ICallahan. This is totally because of TDS and has nothing to do with an aggressive and unprecedented disregard for international law and the American value of free press.
@ICallahan1966 @PHMorrill @juliaioffe He has ties the US. He was educated in the US, lived and worked in the US. Historically America has taken the murder of free journalists by a hostile nation very seriously. This administration has gone soft on American values like free press. Meaning the press is less free now.
@ICallahan1966 @billtaggard @PHMorrill @juliaioffe Name one.
@ICallahan1966 @PHMorrill @juliaioffe You grouped all of us as "lefties and media", so you generalized. To your point. No one is talking about soldiers, and everyone is smart enough to understand lots of people die in lots of ways. This particular death is important because it is a journalist murdered for reporting.

@Wendys_Garden @DavidYankovich Same here. I can't wrap my head around the fact  people really do vote based on their own hate in America in 2018. And there are enough people voting on hate to win elections. They wave the economy around as their red herring, but we all know the economy been building for years.

@ryanfisher122 @NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette Medicare is a popular program. Enrollment of qualified individuals is close to 100%. So the government has a decent reputation for administering healthcare.
@ryanfisher122 @NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette Healthcare is something we all use. At the very least when we are born and when we die. Isn’t shit we all use considered infrastructure? Why carve this one out?
@ryanfisher122 @NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette That is where we differ. To me it is like education, roads, bridges, etc. A service we need to provide as a first world society. Money should never take priority over human suffering and death if we want to be a successful country.
@ryanfisher122 @NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette What cost is appropriate where human suffering and life is the issue?
@jghicksjr @NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette 50 to 75 is great. I would think that is about standard for the whole population of the US unless you count sales tax. Then it would be closer to 100% because everyone’s gotta buy stuff to live.

@SallyAlbright Power inequity makes for consent that is coerced. Not harsh enough to be a crime, but social acceptance of it while executive leadership is disproportionately straight men is oppressive to women. It makes us less competitive because it can shut out individual professionals.

@MrFilmkritik It's because everyone accepts that Melania is a gold digger with no real ambition of her own. We all know she's just happy that someone else is having sex with her husband so she doesn't have to do it.

@tomsuperkat @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @POTUS Anecdotal evidence is not proof of a norm. 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted by 25. So children are being assaulted. If the standard is that children are responsible for physical evidence of their sexual assault, we will never hold child molesters accountable.
@BrittKnowsBestt I believe it. 8 is about where you probably peaked out on cuteness, so she hasn't been able to move past it. Cute is very powerful.

@tomsuperkat @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @POTUS False rape stories are super rare. Rape and sexual assault, however, are very common. I doubt you know a female who hasn't been assaulted. If the false stories ever get to a point where they affect &gt;1 in 3 men by 25, then I will say there is an issue worthy of societal change.
@BBadLeroyBrown @Chriswb71 @AG_Legacy @_celia_bedelia_ @P_Crookston @saramvalentine @RosannaD95 That doesn't make any sense. What protection is available to women? Men are responsible for conception. If that is where you define life, then men are the ones responsible for pregnancy, protection, and abortion. Women bear all the risk, but men are ultimately responsible.
@senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @POTUS You elevated a child raper to our highest court.
@pacelattin He is a perfect example of a republican. They can always somehow make it all about themselves as an individual. They never talk about what is best for society as a whole.

@lindajarmstron @tracybates63 @ChuckGrassley @GOP So be oppressed and accept it? Never. Not good enough. I have a higher opinion of men than that. The predators are a minority. And how would pepper spray help when a 15 yo is being held down by two boys in a place she thought was safe?
@CInsistence That is an interesting take. It is a culture war in their minds isn't it? Thanks for that perspective.		What about educated middle class Trump supporters? They stand to lose more. Do you think it is a culture war on that level too?

@tracybates63 @ChuckGrassley @GOP Do you mind me asking if your assaulter was held accountable? Did you ever get your justice?
@tracybates63 @ChuckGrassley @GOP I am sorry that you were assaulted. Your demands on a survivor, especially a childhood survivor, are unrealistic. The result is predators can get away with assaulting children because they aren't able to manage the situation or preserve the evidence other than their testimony.

@RawStory So many white women are so hateful of other women. All those women likely have young people in their lives who totally disagree with them and avoid engaging them on anything real in their lives.
@WalshFreedom My outrage isn't fake. Our country is being led by a radical minority who seems to be fine with having everything stripped from them so they can be free to hate POC, liberals, and "uppity" women.
@ChuckGrassley Blaming mother nature for the outcome of Trump's unpopular trade war? @GOP always looking for a woman to take the fall for a bunch of dudes' mistakes. Even mother nature is not sacred.
@reesetheone1 He should be commiserating with Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, and Barron then. They never had a good, male role model either.
@PeoplesCourt79 And if it happened in your childhood then sucks to be you because what child will ever understand the importance of preserving physical evidence. @FLOTUS is vacuous and doesn't know how to do anything except look pretty and manipulate men into taking care of her and gardening.
@tracybates63 @ChuckGrassley @GOP She remembered a ton of details. Did you listen to her testimony? She even lent expert, clinical explanations as to why the most intense details are imprinted into the hippo campus through increased flow of neurotransmitters. What more do you need from an child assault survivor?
@tracybates63 @ChuckGrassley @GOP Her testimony is evidence, and the rest of the evidence was never explored. The FBI investigation was limited so they didn't contact and interview all the leads. In politics, sometimes people do something just to say they did it. That is all that happened here.
@ChuckGrassley Won't make me move past the fact that you called a sexual assault survivor "attractive" and worked to confirm her assaulter to the Supreme Court while refusing to allow the FBI to interview other accusers. @GOP is the party of rape, child molesting, tyranny, and treason.

@_MrParks @_celia_bedelia_ Also, the old white women who support this. They care more about pretending a nonviable fetus suffers, so they can turn a blind eye who actually do suffer.
@bretplate @KatKarena @krassenstein The best part is that they are dying too. They won't even be here while we are still paying for their dangerous decisions made with obsolete reasoning.
@GunmetalX33 @emrazz I am a feminist, and I friggin love football. Especially the NFL. It really is the best sports product out there. And with the conversations started by the kneeling players these days, we get a chance to discuss issues of BLM and equality among friends.

@MollyJongFast Not the point, but I am practicing empathy in an effort to continue to love my white, Southern relatives and not exclude their bigoted asses from my wedding. This article gives me empathy. WW have much to lose by getting woke. Not easy to risk “privilege” they have sacrificed for
@DineshDSouza What does this article have to do with college curriculum ? It is an opinion article in a non-academic publication about something topical l. You sound overly emotional. Maybe too emotional to talk politics. Maybe try knitting as a hobby.
@PlesserWilliam @xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch My original point. Special consideration should be given to sexual assault. Our bodies are the crime scene. It is rarely about us. Vaginas are a valuable commodity no matter who is attached. If a credible witness to her own assault is not believed, women will never have equality.
@NeverTrump1214 @shannonrwatts @CondieKristine He might be one of the worst Americans in history. He is a party man at the expense of democracy.
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @VP @SpeakerRyan 		You guys don’t seem to care about sexual assault of children and teens in America, but we don’t forget. https://t.co/FUzkYtlZ18
@PlesserWilliam @xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch There is. Dr Ford is a credible witness. Her body is the crime scene. Her life was threatened in an attempt to force entry into her body, and she was a credible witness to the crime.
@PlesserWilliam @xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch Credible eye witness testimony is evidence. Always has been if it comes from a credible man. In sexual assault that is often the only evidence there is. Our culture needs to account for that. Otw women will never have equality, because sexual assault carries a hefty price for us.
@alexanderbolton The only reason @senatemajldr would want more women on the @senjudiciary committee is so the Republican male members can use them as human shields.
@vickizun @alexanderbolton That was what I though. Judging from their actions and words, I wouldn’t want any of my bathing suit areas in arms length of them. Why would any woman take the risk of working next to them.
@PlesserWilliam @xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch Anything that will make folks stop asking why it took so long to report. So many victims of sexual assault carry their secret for many years before reaching out into society for help. That would be a drop in a huge well of considerations but a good start.
@PlesserWilliam @xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch I am not embarrassed. The “basic principles” you speak of do not account for sexual assault which is a huge problem. If we are going to solve it, then special consideration to solutions are necessary. Otherwise we are letting sexual predators assault again and again.

@GOP @senatemajldr The mob is the American people who want protections from rape. You don’t just govern the old white dudes in America. Every American is supposed to be represented in a democracy, but you guys cheat at elections, so you are not beholden to the people.
@HouseGOP Keep trying to make that tax cut happen. $2000 annually is not even $200 a month. Hardly helpful to US families when wages are stagnant and inflation is high. @GOP does not know how to govern all Americans. They are just there for the wealthy and think the rest of us are stupid.
@FoxNews @ChuckGrassley Why does bipartisanship include confirming a rapist to SCOTUS? @ChuckGrassley you are out of touch with the American people. Bipartisanship is there to be had but terrible leadership like yours only wants to govern part of America. #VoteThemOut
“Please, try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity.”	 	James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time
@BentzTroy @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch Sexual assault always takes a long time to report. It is a cliche to ask why did it take so long to report. The reason it took a long time to report is because it was a sexual assault. That is part of the damage of sexual assault. Way more personal than a home invasion.
@BentzTroy @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch She was. What if you were the only eye witness of your home invasion? Your eye witness testimony would likely be enough to convict the intruder. Now imagine instead of invading your house, they invaded your body. Suddenly the eye witness testimony is not enough.
@SteveSchmidtSES Yep, nothing but Trump talking points coming from her mouth. He’s not popular with the American people. In a democracy that should be enough.
@xopher_x @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch So then if men rape and want to get away with it, they just need to bring a friend. Then it will always be he said they said, and folks like you will be like “Good enough for me.”
@IngrahamAngle @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo This is the survivors’ stories to tell. The Church should not violate their agency and privacy again.
@CarmineSabia @GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch She did. Herself and her attackers. That is always the only witnesses with sexual assault. Our justice system is no help in protecting us from sexual assault or holding our assaulters accountable.
@GregGonzalez68 @womensmarch The only eye witnesses were Dr. Ford and her two assaulters. Of course they deny it. They have every incentive to deny it.
@sommermatter @FoxNews @mercedesschlapp Support you in what?
@the_real_Lord @FoxNews @mercedesschlapp Roofietop is fitting. He is a roofie kind of guy.
If the @GOP is the party of fiscal conservatives, how could the deficit rise by so much in just 1 year? Is it because the modern @GOP is a total sham and it’s members distract us with stupid shit while they concentrate the wealth away from the people? https://t.co/BLW05MLLdn

@rongross52 @chacolady @senatemajldr She gave an eye witness account of her assault. Eye witness accounts are evidence. The only other eye witnesses were her assaulters. Your logic and the investigation are a sham. They didn't interview Swetnick who gave a sworn statement corroborating his predisposition to rape.
@BillOReilly There is nothing shady in this article. You are just trying to set the table so you can assault again with impunity.

@AMcInDallas @RadioFreeTom Totally agreed. Part of education should include leadership and instruction on how to be a good citizen. Walking students through voter registration by way of the school system seems very appropriate in a country that prides itself on democracy and equality.

@SenGillibrand Even though #Kavanaugh will likely be confirmed, Dr. Ford's testimony on the official record in front of the whole country is significant. This is a litmus test for the status of women's equality in the US. We may not win this battle, but the loss will crowd out our complacency.

@LinneAlmer @JumpintraxJack @ECMcLaughlin @RealJack @charliekirk11 @SteveSchmidtSES @PreetBharara I am from the South, so related to a few. In person, they have a couple of talking points that reduce complex issues to simple cliches, and if I challenge with reason, they storm off. I think it is a social outcast issue, so they can't embrace divergent thinking even if logical.
@JumpintraxJack @ECMcLaughlin @RealJack @charliekirk11 That is exactly right. Educated critical thinking has no place in the modern @GOP. They say what they need to say to fire up their base and appeal to their lack of critical thinking. Why would they make education a priority ever? An uneducated population is easier to manipulate.
@JumpintraxJack @ECMcLaughlin The relevant @GOP party faded away under W. Bush. Now they are all about demonizing poverty and obsessing over our personal lives as a distraction while the rich get richer. Since I am not rich, and I don't care how people manage their private lives, there is nothing there for me
