Fourth in the line of succession for Virginia governor is statehouse speaker Kirk Cox.		Cox is the speaker due to a one-seat GOP majority.		It has that majority because Rep. David Yancey won his seat in a coin toss.		It went to a coin toss because that race ended in a tie.		Vote!

Incidentally, you're also seeing federal PACs do more and more of this as well, classifying their fundraising efforts (direct mail, telemarketing, etc) as "independent expenditures" so it appears all the money they're spending on fundraising is actually being spent on politics.
Anyway, that's just one small, specific example of the types of accounting games that these groups play in the hopes that no one notices they exist solely to dupe well-meaning donors into underwriting an incestuous, tax-exempt fundraising apparatus.
But counting it thusly would change that crucial ratio. Taking that $850k into account, the group actually spent more than $2.2M on fundraising and about $550k on program expenses (assuming no other accounting chicanery). So the ratio is actually 75-25, not 50-50.
At the end of the filing, there's this note: ACS actually counts $850k paid to its fundraisers as a program service "public awareness campaign," b/c fundraisers are promoting their mission to potential donors. Laughable. By any legit metric, these are simply fundraising expenses. https://t.co/23Kb6yuDAT
Nonprofit IRS filings require groups say how much they spent on fundraising, alongside how much they spend on "program expenses," or actual nonprofit work.		Here's ACS's 2016 filing. $1.37M on fundraising and $1.4M on program expenses. 50-50 isn't great. Many are worse. BUT... https://t.co/inYzACuCki
