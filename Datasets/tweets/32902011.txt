Someone has told Marshall Allen we should give up commissions &amp; charge fees   A blanket statement that may work in some situations but not all. He is giving me an ulcer so I am giving it a rest. We have work to do. https://t.co/RBe3K31wKw
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar Good luck. You are way off the mark. I will make sure you hear from Agents and Brokers
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar I have worked in this business my entire life. Look at MLR in ACA &amp; commissions &amp; ask how many people have left the industry because they can’t make a living. I represent independent agents, I know you are taking a little piece of the pie and throwing our industry under the bus.
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar That doesn’t work for every situation or every state. Not every state can charge fees. You talked to a couple of agents, you have 1,000,000+ to talk to who do not charge fees. In addition to cannot generalize all rules for all states not all lines of business.
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar Please investigate how many agents in the US get bonus’s?  Less than 1%???  However it is not against the law for any Company to give a bonus to their highest achievers. Put a spot light in high drug and healthcare costs then you may get on track regarding premiums
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar You are incorrect!  Would you rather employers pay agents on top of their already expensive premium or currently built into the premium.  We have been and will be an advocate for consumers. We look for ways to save them money. You are so off track. You are not an expert.
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar Not true.  It is called a pass through. The commissions are built in. It is how we get paid. Would you rather we work for free?  Do you work for free?  We work for our clients and we get paid for placing the business with the right plan for them.  And completion is 0
@ScottTruhlar @marshall_allen And small group employers have to comply with MLR. If they spend more than 15% on administrative charges by law they have to return the money.
@ScottTruhlar @marshall_allen Yes commissions under 50 are normally set. However, it depends by State.
@ScottTruhlar @marshall_allen Department of Labor
@marshall_allen @ScottTruhlar MLR comes into play for another bit portion of employer plans
@ScottTruhlar @marshall_allen He sent it to the wrong 10. Commissions are transparent on the employers 5500 form.
@streetglide12 Do you want his email ?

@AGJeffLandry Regarding your recent Pelican Post article, you were remiss in including the hardworking agents/brokers of LA.  We prefer the people of LA use a professional and not call https://t.co/WoplM7WwIp.  Can we talk?
Postcards for America - New York Navigators cost tax payers millions in grants. Agents are free!! Commissions are built in premium. Do not use an agent, insurance company keeps as profit!!!
Agents/Brokers continue to serve our clients &amp; the Media continues to "highlight" the work of the Navigators.  HELLO, the program didn't work, the Feds paid them $$$$ Talk to a professional!
Interview the agents in LA who work hard to enroll  people of LA? HAFA, just met with CMS about the importance of agents. Navigator program yielded a cost of $5000 PP versus agents $10  https://t.co/pVbqaIKPoi

If Navigators are sitting down and enrolling without Federal Grants, they should be licensed agents.  When are State Government going to take a stand? https://t.co/kfsdk1dWlq
https://t.co/RoOO6acEub
A huge shout out to National General who filed comments with CMS regarding proposed regulations for 2018 and TOTALLY supported the agent/broker community.  Asked for the removal of our commissions from MLR &amp; touted our hard work!
I am trying to help the poor - not time to read the thread - My apologies - back to work for me.. https://t.co/gpF9lfbsVm
We sell insurance - we do not work in the SNAP, Housing Assistance, Medicaid Market.  We simply are professionals who want to be paid for the work we do and that is selling insurance.  Consumers deserve the option to choose an agent or not. https://t.co/WIs7UgQuii
With the passing of ACA commissions dropped 50%, today commissions are 0 or have dropped 90-95%.  Agents have been working for free.  We serve the consumers, they are our friends, family, etc.  We do not work for insurance companies.  Most people have never met an Agent... https://t.co/WfqpC1ldl3
Fair compensation is all that we ask - However, I think the Navigator is a moot point, with the decrease in funding and the continued decrease in funding, unless something drastic happens. https://t.co/2jC1WBX5eC
Exactly, that is the space that is needed - Navigators do a good job helping Medicaid people. https://t.co/fOrSMaiVMv
Exactly - you have to poll those insurance agents that work in the individual space, not P&amp;C, nor Life nor Group Agents.  They all work in different areas of the industry. https://t.co/QKhzLLOMaV
@colinb1123 @Think_Allison @insureblog I would be cool with Navigators if they were licensed, educated and carried insurance.  If they act like insurance agents, they should be licensed, I would welcome them to our industry.  We enroll people in Medicaid everyday, we help people - its what we do!
https://t.co/mxcYGno1hb
Polls obviously can’t be totally trusted. My personal poll says agents want to handle 100% of FPL + for non expansion states and 138% of FPL + in expansion states. We will happily accept $62M in Navigator grants https://t.co/IRbha44g1Y

Consumers deserve the option of using an expert.  Individual Commissions should be mandated. Agents deserve fair compensation. https://t.co/eTrLy3BxOd
Correct. When agents are not paid. They are the poor and cannot operate a free business model https://t.co/8XaLWMYolC
HAFA and Senator Regina Barrow partnered to insure everyone has access to an expert. https://t.co/197gO6Gljw https://t.co/DVzh2hNW3G
What do you want a rebuttal about?  You are talking to someone who leads an association of agents who help everyone.  I personally help the poor, recently out of jail. You see we don’t ask their income to see if they are worthy of assistance. I have events with Dems and Reps https://t.co/pA22aIwDBl
If CMS would have used Navigators for outreach and agents for sales, we would be in a different place. CMS taught Navigators to sell and Ins Companies got a free sales force. https://t.co/8XaLWMYolC
I talk to CMS almost daily, they are not releasing all the data and it’s hard to capture data.  Recent information cited that based on the amount of people enrolled by Navigators, they were paid $5000 each policy. Agents paid $10-$18. https://t.co/jOYIEje244
In meeting with CMS recently, their plan is to provide. More information to the agents and brokers about our clients so we can make sure they do not lose their tax credits, etc. We want to be paid and that only happens when agents does the enrolling, we make sure people pay https://t.co/QEfLz8zbc0

@BillCassidy please don’t say yes to bi-partisan bill that gives $106 million to the Navigator program, that doesn’t work!
Cigna trying to bring down premiums by cutting out agent/brokers $10 commission.  Really?  Does that help the consumer or hurt?
FACT:  Ins Comp's have already increased their rates due to the loss of CSR will they really reduce premiums should they get it back.. NO

Hello!!  You have an industry of Agents that are available and do not cost consumers a penny!!
My blood is boiling!  Agents are an afterthought. Why would the Federal Government spend millions of tax to train Navigators to sell?
CMS turns away Agents from registering for Marketplace training!
CMS goal to allow consumers to window shop on 11-7.
@SecBurwell - Why are Agents listed as other on the CMS eval forms. We are not other, we are the experts, boots on the ground &amp; FREE !
CMS Evaluation form has 18 options to chose from as "Assisters".  Agents are not included!  We are NOT Other !!
