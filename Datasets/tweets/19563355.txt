@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump Border barriers where needed, asylum reform, and mandatory E-Verify is the winning combination -- the only way to effectively prevent illegal immigration.
Many mistake a credible fear claim for the right to asylum. Very few who claim credible fear qualify for asylum under U.S. law or international protocols. Credible fear can allow economic migrants (illegal aliens) into U.S. which they hope to make permanent. #CloseAsylumLoophole
@Drewbueno Sounds like a Koch Brothers proposal.		https://t.co/m3samLNSua
Instead of closing "credible fear" asylum loophole some in Congress want to codify Obama-era interpretation that has led to ongoing surge of family units and unaccompanied minors. This is a huge incentive for economic migrants to make dangerous trek with hopes of staying in U.S.
"Alternatives to Detention" is less effective: 		"And since people in detention have their cases heard faster, they are deported faster."
"Alternatives to Detention" is expensive: 	DHS "says that in 2017, 2,430 migrants were deported after being kept on alternatives to detention, at a cost of $183 million. That works out to $75,360 per deportation." 		https://t.co/1PZYjxyl24

Census Bureau projects future net immigration will total 46  million by 2060 and the total U.S. population will reach 404 million — 79 million larger than in 2017.		https://t.co/wj1TBMO6Wy

Last year Pres. Trump promised to end visa lottery and chain migration, and he endorsed RAISE Act.		This year he says, "I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever." Immigration numbers are already at an historic high.	   	Did he misspeak? Let’s hope so.
Hopefully one thing that will come out of the SOTU is D.C. press will stop reporting "the Pres. wants a wall along the border with Mexico." He is asking for funding for effective barriers where needed.
A great way to protect American jobs would be to reform the H-1B visa program so tech employers couldn't legally replace qualified American workers with cheaper foreign guest workers.
President Trump fails to mention the urgent need for asylum reform and mandatory E-Verify. Border barriers will help prevent illegal immigration but do nothing about those who do get in illegally, those who make bogus asylum claims, and nothing to prevent visa overstays.
The United States has admitted one million legal immigration a year on average since 1990. President Trump indicates he thinks that's too few.
President Trump wants "largest numbers ever" of legal immigrants coming into the United States.
Criminal justice reform is dependent on ex-convicts finding employment. The federal government hands out one million lifetime work permits a year to foreign nationals and constantly seeks to expand guest worker programs. This is counterproductive.
50 million working-age U.S. residents (aged 18-64) are still not in the labor market at all.	https://t.co/AuN7yLDM7U
Pres. Trump say more people now working in U.S. than ever before. True. Also true, more people in U.S. now *not working* than ever before. Immigration has caused working-age population to increase faster than employment gains.
Wages are still below pre-Recession levels for workers in many occupations. The "recovery" still has a long way to go.
Pres. Trump says he wants an immigration system that is "safe, lawful, modern, and secure."
Last SOTU President Trump promised 1. Amnesty for 1.8 million DACA-eligible  	2. Border wall  3. End to Visa Lottery 4. End to Chain Migration. 		WH allowed Speaker Ryan to sabotage agenda in House. Will Speaker Pelosi put interest of Americans first? 		Leadership matters.

"Fourth pillar: protects the nuclear family by ending chain  migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can  bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives....we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to  spouses and minor children."
"Third pillar: ends the visa lottery -a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety  of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based  immigration system."
"Second pillar: fully secures the border.  That means building a  wall on the Southern border...and it finally ends the dangerous practice of 'catch and release.'"
.@POTUS Last year, President Trump outlined immigration reform based on four pillars:		"First pillar: a path to  citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by  their parents at a young age."
Zero net immigration (370,000 annually) would result in 58% of U.S. population aged 18-64. If current immigration levels continue (1.1 million annually) that population would be 59%. 		Immigration does not stop U.S. aging. 		https://t.co/wj1TBMO6Wy

To be fair to employers, current non-workers who haven’t held a job for some time may be more difficult to recruit than filling jobs with new immigrants. But the country will be far better off moving these Americans from dependency into productivity. 	https://t.co/AuN7yLDM7U

@loriamontgomery @rizzoTK The crisis at the border isn't about total number of  apprehensions but  total number of people at the border claiming asylum, and bringing minor  children with them to avoid detention while awaiting a  hearing. This  is overwhelming the system. Only Congress can fix it.

ICE lacks detention space and it limited by court rulings on how long it can detain minor children and families. Immigration courts are overwhelmed.
Remember! The crisis at the border isn't about total number of apprehensions but total number of people at the border claiming asylum, and bringing minor children with them to avoid detention while awaiting a hearing. This is overwhelming the system. Only Congress can fix it.
One almost gets the impression that the media's inability to grasp straightforward concepts when it comes to immigration policy is a deliberate strategy of obfuscation.
Crisis began in 2014 with a surge of unaccompanied minors. Obama did not take steps to deal with it, and most were able to join family already (usu. illegally) in the U.S., which only encouraged more of the same. Decision not to deal with a crisis doesn't make it  go away.
Also a difference between how Border Patrol deals with adults and unaccompanied minors or family units with minor children. Plus, many have been coached to claim credible fear. Even though most do *not* qualify for asylum, all still have to have a hearing.
Media talking point seems to be that total border apprehensions are down therefore the rise in families and unaccompanied minors at the border overwhelming capacity to deal with them is not a crisis. This is wrong. These are two separate issues.
.@realDonaldTrump: "How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?"
@realDonaldTrump: "Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home."
@realDonaldTrump: "We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support."
.@realDonaldTrump: "Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone – 90 percent of which floods across from our Southern Border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War."
.@realDonaldTrump: "America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants...  But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.  It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.  Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans."
Both agree there is a humanitarian crisis. President asked for better border security, more beds, more judges, and reforms to make it easier to more quickly return illegal aliens back to their home countries. Speaker Pelosi wants "more innovation" on the border.
Schumer promised border security in 1986 when he was in the House of Rep. He's been making that promise ever since, yet has undermined every effort to do so. Should we believe him now?
E-Verify and asylum reform, along with physical barriers on the border, are also essential to securing the U.S. border and preventing illegal immigration.
