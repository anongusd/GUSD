8/ Is audio more your thing? You can listen to my full report for @RFI_English here: https://t.co/PGBBGHfNsv
7/ France‚Äôs geology bureau expects to have its final soil results early next year. Here, a red pole marks where samples were taken. Depending on pollution levels, the govt will decide whether or not to ban farming on the land -- a decision Michel has been awaiting for 3 yrs. https://t.co/tFCGCarX88
6/ These operations left behind high levels of arsenic, lead, zinc and tin in the soil. It‚Äôs counterintuitive, but Michel's contaminated plot is on the right (fallow soil is on the left). The former is overgrown with weeds ‚Äì the only thing that grows there, according to Michel. https://t.co/yW4vGzngO0
5/ Some 1.5m chemical shells &amp; 400k explosive rounds were destroyed here in the 1920s. The shells that couldn‚Äôt be salvaged for metal were buried in a hole with TNT &amp; blown up, leaving meters-deep craters still visible today. These overgrown craters are next to Michel's farm. https://t.co/jGWlJif6sB
4/ After the war, France had an unprecedented amount of surplus ammunition -- over 2 million tons of unused artillery &amp; chemical shells. For security reasons, the govt decided to destroy it. And they decided to base some of those operations here, near Verdun.
3/ But it was only 3 years ago, in 2015, that Michel learned this was because his soil was contaminated with heavy metals. This, after geologists discovered the site of a former WWI ammunition destruction factory, right next to his land.
2/ Michel Collignon is a farmer in the rural village of Houdelaucourt-sur-Othain, a few km from Verdun. He‚Äôd always known one of his land plots was strange, as wheat and barley didn‚Äôt grow there. https://t.co/XkTlvBYSBR
Another Verdun report thread, 1/ World War I ended 100 years ago. But its effects linger on in northeastern France in the form of environmental pollution. And some farmers are bearing the brunt.

8/ Until there are no more duds posing public safety hazards, mine-clearing experts will continue with the dangerous daily routine of clearing unexploded bombs in Verdun‚Äôs Red Zone. https://t.co/XnOkBIcGfc
7/ Philippe estimates it will take 200-300 years to clear all the duds from Verdun‚Äôs Red Zone. He says this is because some 300 million shells were fired during 1916‚Äôs 10-month battle, the war‚Äôs longest. https://t.co/99VHFn1A3A
6/ The mine-clearing experts load the duds into a specialised truck to transport them out of the Red Zone and dispose of them. https://t.co/yOl4SSUDhN
5/ Philippe says his service clears 10 tons of duds per year here, in an area that‚Äôs just 15 square km. According to WWI experts, up to a third of shells fired during the war never exploded. Meaning many of them -- both explosives and chemical weapons -- still litter the ground. https://t.co/NKlrwIjngu
4/ Philippe and his colleague Franc find the duds spray-painted orange by the forest service for pick-up. It‚Äôs a dangerous job, but they take the risk every day. https://t.co/MH2fuBIqsV
3/ The area is full of unexploded ammunition -- also known as unexploded ordnance, or UXO, or simply ‚Äúduds‚Äù. Here, mine-clearing expert Philippe finds a French 55-caliber shell. https://t.co/AITT6oONJV
2/ I took a ride-along with some mine-clearing experts who venture into Verdun‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Zone‚Äù every day. The zone was declared off-limits to habitation &amp; agriculture by the government after the war due to the devastation. The government then ordered it be planted over with trees. https://t.co/OsfvqtP7vZ

Today's report was part of those measures announced last year. More than 50 years after the removals began, the official report will finally shed some light on the controversial program and this murky chapter of French history.
Nicknamed the "stolen children," many were never able to return home. Some were adopted, others placed in foster care or on farms to work. Last year aid was announced for victims: govt to provide counseling, cover costs of travel/lodging in R√©union for those who wished to go back
Today the French govt published long-awaited report on a controversial state program from 1962-1982. During this time, thousands of children were removed (often w/o consent) from their homes in overseas territory of R√©union. Govt's aim was to fight rural depopulation in France. https://t.co/AOF57Fs6Ne

Everyone has the right to live in dignity. Getting people off the streets should be a top priority. But it must be done in tandem w/ construction of subsidized &amp; affordable housing, or it won‚Äôt solve 1 of the biggest problems behind LA‚Äôs homelessness: soaring rent &amp; housing costs
So I guess some of my questions are: are certain homeless populations (chronically homeless, veterans, families) going to be chosen to live in these trailers? I‚Äôm interested to see how this proposal advances.
Nearly 1/3 of LA‚Äôs homeless population is ‚Äúchronically homeless‚Äù. This refers to those suffering addiction, mental illness or physical disability, as well as those who have been homeless a year or more. This population jumped 20% last year to around 17,000 (out of 58,000 total)
Interesting proposal, but many questions remain re: the large # of LA‚Äôs homeless suffering from addiction. Will there be counseling and medical services onsite? Social workers to check in and track progress? Some sort of security to ensure safety and prevent dealing? https://t.co/5vxAqkmeZA

@NatlParkService @XavierBecerra @latimes 7/ I'll end on a personal note. Growing up I went to @YosemiteNPS almost every year. I saw my first waterfalls, hiked my first mountains &amp; learned to ski there. As an LA kid, my love for nature stems from these visits. It's unfair some may be deprived of that because of money.
@NatlParkService @XavierBecerra @latimes 6/ Letter gives glimpse of Becerra's legal theory. He says NPS proposal isn't backed by sufficient economic analysis, doesn't accurately consider impact on park visitors, and therefore ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to fix problem of deferred maintenance backlog.
@NatlParkService @XavierBecerra @latimes Letter cites John Muir, "'everyone needs beauty as well as bread'...The proposed fee increases threaten to put many Americans in the choice of beauty or bread and to distance them from the places in which so many experience the natural wonder of our great nation."
@NatlParkService 4/ 3 of the 17 parks are in my home state of CA: Yosemite, Joshua Tree &amp; Kings Canyon. In a letter CA AG @XavierBecerra, along w/ 10 other AGs including those from AZ and OR, opposed the plan. @latimes published the letter here --&gt; https://t.co/CMb1ePrfgX
3/ Under Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, @NatlParkService proposed fee hikes last month, citing aging infrastructure. The increased fees would be applied during peak tourist season (usually summer months) in 17 popular parks, as soon as next year.
2/ Vehicle fees would more than double, from $30 to $70, while individual fees would go from $10 or $15 to $30. This would limit access for low-income individuals and families. Our public lands shouldn't be reserved for the privileged few.

Wonder if this will free up the hands of the Indian govt, whose plan to deport Rohingya refugees has gone all the way to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/hboj7J0sMG
