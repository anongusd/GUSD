disappointed by changing from 100 Miis to 3000 Miis.
For the Nintendo Switch Mii Maker, add the color palette as there is not enough colors for the Miis. Eyes, Mouth and Hair. Also change the Mii creation from 100 Miis to unlimited Miis so I can create lot more Miis. In Wii U you did not make your fans-
I still want to make my 100th Mii Fighter which is a Mii Brawler, end of rant.
Fighters. I am glad Joker is coming to Smash in April as part of the 3.0.0 update but please, make the 3.0.0 update would change the Mii Fighter creation from 99 Mii Fighters to unlimited Mii Fighters.
Seriously Nintendo and Sakurai, you removed the Character Customization from Ultimate with the Customization only to Mii Fighters but still 99 Mii Fighters, if the update 3.0.0 still have the 99 Mii Fighter limit, I would tell to fix it into unlimited Mii-
I ship Midnight Lycanroc X Tapu Lele, come at me.
In Smash 4, you can create 10 Custom Fighters and 99 Mii Fighters but this is "Character Customization" but in Smash Ultimate, same thing 99 Mii Fighters but I really wish update 3.0.0 would change from 99 Mii Fighters to unlimited Mii Fighters.
I also have that I have 99 Mii Fighters and cannot create any more Mii Fighters, I would report this to Nintendo to fix that 99 Mii Fighters glitch.
Smash Ultimate update 3.0.0 would change Mii Fighter creation from 99 Mii Fighters to unlimited Mii Fighters so we can create any more Mii Fighters. #SmashBros
Nintendo Switch Mii Maker needs more colors and the color palette with varies color and also color for skin and favorite color. #SmashBros
