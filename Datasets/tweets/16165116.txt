@ClippersPaul Charlie Weis without a doubt; Both are overrated Kurt has had more success as a HC than Weis
@MattLewis01 Gran Torino.  I really like Eastwood and he was very good in this film (IMO)....
@funny_bunny_mel Ridiculous.  Another one that gets me is those that wait for a car to back out when there are open spots 5 spots down!
@rockson Great, glad to hear that you have her back
@rockson I missed the news about you getting your dog back.  How were you able to do it?

@wyliemac Jonas Bros r just plain awful.  Telling my 13 y.o. daughter that they wont be significant in 3 yrs but she doesnt believe me
not digging Radiohead
@pyrowold not quite sure how to explain it - pretty dark and deep _ not ur fun-loving Grease type musical
last night went to dinner at M w/ friends and then to "Spring Awakining" - now that was an "interesting" show
@CaraKeithley Congrats! Great accomplishment - keep up the good work.
@RolandK3 The best!
@robaticus yes, i plan on doing wings on Tuesday. can we leave at 11:30 instead of noon?
@kurtludlow10TV Kurt, this is supposed to be a "stimulus pkg" not a "programs package."  Remove the pork and get on w/ it!
@jowyang Not sure why they would do that.  Facebook = personal contacts while LinkedIn = business/professional contacts
@ChristySeason IMO, that is terrible.  We don't allow our teen and pre-teen girls to listen to it....
@robaticus Sorry for lack of invite to Enricos...needed to have some one-on-one convos....let's get a group together soon to go over
lunch at J. Alexander's, rockin' some Nugent on my way back to office FTW
RT @sacca The world has moved from analog to digital. Thus, it's time we shift from teaching calculus to statistics. - Arthur Benjamin #TED

City Center is the largest abandoned building in America?  That is what Mayor Coleman says.  I don't know if that is really the case
@bitflinger Dude, I am with you.  I did it a couple of weeks ago for the first time.  I hurt all over the next day.
@Wally1440 Agreed, that was a great call as well
@Wally1440 Gus Johnson with the great call for that game!
@TommOH great look.  When my oldest lost both of hers, I called her "serpent girl" as she could stick her tongue out where he teeth were
@TheAnswar I would think that but I know I don't have enought Twitter game to make that happen.
@Karinanova @CaraKeithley We are going to see it Saturday night.  What are we in for?
@NickSeguin I.....O!
@bob_sheehan I would be surprised if @TheAnswar doesn't have his own suite at the Magic Kingdom.  The dude lives at Disney.
@amandacallicoat Yep, I am looking forward to it.
@amandacallicoat Cool, I am going to send in my registration this week.  How long did it take for you to get hooked up w/ someone?
@amandacallicoat Did you get hooked up w/ them via the eMOM service?
@Wally1440 HUGE win by the Bucks tonight!

@MailOurMilitary Cool, I am going to sign up to be an email partner!
@MailOurMilitary Wow, great service.  I would love to do it!  Is the best way to sign up on your website?
@NickSeguin Yes, you really can.  We chose to live where we do because of the city services (Police, Fire, etc)...

@NBCSquire why the delay?
@kurtludlow10TV Kurt, it isn't a snow story unless you have a live shot in front of the salt barn.
anyone have a time warp machine to transport my 13 y.o . daughter to a point in her life where she is easier to get along with?
@MailOurMilitary From a people perspective?  I think 70-80....
@gatesyk why are you taking the GRE?
@nathanmartin Something that probaly isn't said enough: "Thank you for your service."
RT @dickc The Zune is kind of like Carrot Top. You stare at it and think "It doesn't seem like this should be true, and yet, there it is"
Holy cow..the snow is coming down out there.  At Panera on Martin Rd and it is coming down at a steady clip
balancing the checkbook and prepping for a very busy week

Sorry to be missing Ignite Cbus #2 event tonight.  Was scheduled to go but I can't swing it
@DOMTIBERI Yes, I do see Sil but Pauly was all about the hair.  Sil was all about the crazy suits
@DOMTIBERI @kurtludlow10tv Pauly Walnuts definitely
@DOMTIBERI agreed, they need to win those if they want to make the playoffs
@1datarecovery would love to take a class like this but cant swing it due to schedules, etc.  R u willing to share materials, syllabus, etc?
@DOMTIBERI I understand that they won't be doing the Coffman vs Jerome game at Avery this year.  That is too bad - great event IMO
@DOMTIBERI My kids and I are active in the Dublin Travel Softball program.  I have coached the last 3 yrs and Nick & I have done fall teams
@DOMTIBERI Great info to share.  We have a mutual set of friends: Nick and Becky Ciminillo.  I won't tell you what Nick says about you. :-)
@kuronoir have you been there before?  You will have to let me know your thoughts.  I would like to try that place out.

@kurtludlow10TV What is your favorite gyro in town?

@stephenkruiser you called it
@floozyspeak she was there y'day
@floozyspeak Word.  My wife was at Tuttle Mall and they had shuttles running cause the parking lot was so packed.  worse than christmas
@elimanning NFC east or west? Do u root within the division?
@michellemalkin The time for rhetoric is over.  The time for uber salesmanship needs to give way to governoring. Rubber must meet the road.
@robmacomber Amen
@johnfortney He was fantastice; if you havent seen this yet you should definitely do so
just saw Gran Torino. Great flick, classic Eastwood sans the uber violence
@1datarecovery @SBlanquera I would be up for that!  My wife doesn't like to play so I am always looking for a game.
@timjeby good luck w/ your move!
i have a milestone birthday in 2009 - have some specific fitness goals that I want to hit by then
@mikemarshall I was busy tonight and couldnt make it - thanks for the offer.  :-)
@THE_REAL_SHAQ Have to go w/ the Ohio player - Lebron
@Figliuolo I love that SNL skit where they talk about old news like it is new.  "Kennedy was shot??" "We landed on the moon?"  hilarious
@johnfortney My only request is that it is fair.  IMO, to be a good journalist you can't have a double-standard.  Big problem today, IMO.
@kbickel Kathy, you need to talk Archie into joining Twitter!  That would be awesome!
@kbickel Good to have you.  Alumni Association is great - I just need to be better about leveraging the services it provides
missing the 10TV production of news on WWHO at 10:00 PM.  Watching Fox 28 because I have to
The "Angry Whopper?" I am interested in Marketers' opinion of that
@TommOH you don't want them to grow out of that TV; they move on to crap TV - reality, MTV, etc
@RolandK3 did they make it hard on you to cancel?
@8101harris - agreed, it definitely makes thing much better. With those items and everything else, it is like perfect storm of busy at work
working on annual reviews this weekend and finalizing scorecard metrics
back from gym
@bakerjon agreed...he just needs to stay injury free
@wyliemac no, I don't think so.  The high school parking lots (jerome and coffman) were both full
@TommOH The discontinued that newscast as of 12/31/08.
@bob_sheehan first intelligent post from you in a while
can you say "overloaded?"
@bitflinger meant to say "pays her"
@bitflinger Easy solution - which school pays here?  enough said - don't bite the hand that feeds you!
@kurtludlow10TV Kurt, what happened to the 10 PM news on WWHO TV?
@JohnKasich Agreed.  I am just hoping that the Bucks compete and earn some respect back on the national stage

yes, Malholtra just bloodied Adam Foote's nose a bit.  that doesn't bother me a bit
That Mountain West speed is getting the best of the SEC right now

ND has lost 14 games over past 2 years.  Most in ND history.  i recommend that they stick with Charlie
@blondie5000 agreed, Charlie's self proclimation as a "genius" hasnt translated to success.
@gatesyk they just needed some time to get warmed up; that is a great feeling beating the hell out of um like that!
@gatesyk you know, having Charlie At their coach isnt a bad thing for us.  kind of like having Carr as the coach of um
Syracuse just beat ND!  Was the wrong coach get fired last week?
