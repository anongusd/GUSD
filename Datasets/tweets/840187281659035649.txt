@AquarianTiger @liberalinohio @MichaelAvenatti @LannyDavis These are pretty serious allegations. $450,000 is a lot to owe the government.
@AquarianTiger @liberalinohio @MichaelAvenatti @LannyDavis Oh please. There's no reason he can't comment. 1 tweet would suffice. Aren't you curious?
@MichaelAvenatti @SheldonCRowT @babyhuey420420 @LannyDavis A real "street fighter" would comment on the investigation into their unpaid taxes. Unless it's true... in which case they would probably block people for asking. #basta my ass.
@MichaelAvenatti @AquarianTiger @LannyDavis Why are you afraid of talking about feds investigation into your unpaid taxes? I'm beginning to think it's true....
@MichaelAvenatti @_AYR_ Is it true that you owe our government almost a half a million dollars in unpaid taxes?
@MichaelAvenatti @AquarianTiger @LannyDavis Is there any truth to the claims that you didn't pay your taxes? Answer the question.
@MichaelAvenatti @LannyDavis Did you or didn't you pay your taxes? You could clear this up right now. Or are you going to block me again?
