Here is another California CONSTUTIONAL illegality that actually went b4 voters for approval that never should have passed California legislation during Obama term
This law makes Californias 3 strikes laws PROHIBITED.		beside fact that it is a form of double jeopardy 		In this case your punished twice as long for crimes  already served justice on. 		Damn #DEMOCRATS  of Calif legislation passing these ILLEGAL CONSEQUENCES  ON US
#Constitution PROHIBITS via 		ex post facto law 		A LAW that makes ILLEGAL an act that was legal when committed, changes rules of evidence for easier conviction, increases penalties for infraction after committed.
Constitution 		Grant's ZERO authority of Congress or Senate to rule over American citizens like a King or a Master		The creation of the throne of  TYRRANY 		ANARCHY must rise across the land  to defeat Americas enemy 		TYRRANY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AMERICAS ENEMY
No where in our #CONSTITUTION does it GRANT POWER OF CONGRES OR SENATE		To regulate, rule, legislate provide for, constitute, establish, declare, pass, or execute any laws or rules		UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
They need something to hide behind?
Why are Democrats acting so squirrely all of a sudden? 		And getting belligerant with acting atty general who's job ends in about one week? 		Bcz they cant railroad him on his way out!  		Why are democrays so hell bent on setting Trump appointees up for PUBLIC OPINION
