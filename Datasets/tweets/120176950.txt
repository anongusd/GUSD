We have a path for predictable and stable policy for the next two years... Now is the time to take a fresh look at opportunities to invest
Does not matter whether it is Long Island City, Kansas City, Salt Lake City, strong infrastructure is essential for strong economic growth
Building our roads/railways/bridges/ports has been one bipartisan way to create jobs today &amp; lay foundation for future economic expansion

Capacity to address concerns as long as both private &amp; public sectors commit to policies that strengthen workers, innovators, &amp; investment 
Secretary Lew: The ultimate test for all of us will be how inclusive tomorrow’s economy becomes and how widely our economic gains flow.
