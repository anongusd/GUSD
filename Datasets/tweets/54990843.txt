Besides the current indicators of NFC Awards (Population, Poverty/Backwardness, Revenue Collection, Inverse Population Density), Other determinants should be added like Public Investments estimates and growth potential. Also, % of Revenue Collection should be increased
The NFC gives 82% weightage to population that’s unfair. 	Only 5% weightage is given to Revenue Generation/Collection.		While provinces also have incentives to keep the province poor and backward.
Very rarely it happens anywhere in the world that fiscal resources are distributed according to absolute population of federating units (i.e. Provinces etc) 		With exception of Nigeria and Pakistan, nowhere in entire world is Population major indicator in fiscal distribution.
The prevailing formula of resource redistribution under NFC is flawed. 		Provinces have incentive to keep high population growth and more poor/backward. 		Provinces have very less incentive to generate or expand their own revenues.

Our idea of Export competitiveness should be focused on "Quality". But unfortunately we do not think beyond devaluation of currency to increase exports. In International Market, Quality matters more than the cost.
@faisalahmadj To compete in the International Market, we need to increase the productivity of our labor force and the quality of our products. Subsidizing exports through devaluation of currency is not the only way forward. We need to focus on "Quality" too.

@faisalahmadj Sufficient investments in domestic #oil exploration &amp; production can create a hedge against the volatility in international Oil market.
@Hypatiaa22 Construction work, domestic help, office boys, cleaners, gardeners, other such labor etc.
@Hypatiaa22 There are several sectors which require unskilled people too.
Pakistan has to develop opportunities to make best use of 'Skilled' and 'Unskilled' population. There is always silver lining in dark clouds. To grasp the hidden avenues, Pakistan has to invest on its people.
Pakistan has a large population - 6th largest. It is to be made an asset rather than percieved as a liability. With the right kind of education and training, we would be much better off by protecting young generation rather than taking them as liability.
@AAHSoomro Coming to your point, these regions have almost declining population rate. If the new generation is smaller than the previous generation, the smaller group of people have to bear burden of larger group. Which creates social security, pension gaps etc
@AAHSoomro This is another point, my point is earning growth of any business is derived from "Demand". Huge population create huge demand for consumption, Hence good for businesses.
Annual Reports of majority of Listed Companies do realize that Huge Population is major driving factor in Earnings Growth. Huge Population is good for business. Any Business!

@MohammadImad15 No one is asking to abandon it entirely. But shouldn't be given preference over other more valued sectors.
One Rupee invested in education, healthcare and tourism gives much better returns than investment in Agriculture. Collectively and individually.
We must focus on establishing service industry which gives much better dividend for the country as whole. Service sector like education, healthcare, tourism, retail, transportation, housing should be our priority at all cost.
It is wrong to assume that Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. It is not even a major contributor of our GDP.

@oblmir Playing with exchange rates is a bad strategy to deal with BOP crisis. In the end you have to hold exchange rates fixed somewhere. If not at Rs104/$ then eventually at Rs 200/$. You have to stabilize somewhere.

@faisalahmadj There is no interest in research activity of the type that searches for the truth and attempts to draw suitable lessons from it, even by those who have 'studied' Macroeconomics 101.
@faisalahmadj Macroeconomics is not a physical science like physics. Macroeconomics is a social science which have different complimentary and contradictory models. One model (independent CBs) cannot be taken as divine and universal truth like F=ma.
It is understandable that Central Banks should have operational independence, but important policy measures like interest rates and exchange rates must be a function of government or elected parliamentarians.
Who is more likely to make good economic policies? 		1. Govt which is elected by the people	2. Independent Central Bankers who have no accountability to anyone for its policies
Good luck believing that un-elected central bankers would necessarily come up with policies which are in society's broader interests and wellbeing of people.
@chupkaryaar @imran_sidra I am telling you what the SBP Act actually says. This act allows govt to have great influence on the monetary policies of Pakistan.

As part of its "Transform Karachi" plan, the PTI, in its manifesto, claims that it will lead a "crackdown" against the city's "water mafia". This issue have not been raised so far.

@AamnaFasihi Good Morning Aamna. Still asleep and dreaming? 😋
In the long term we are going to die, but why we have to kill ourselves right now because of the ultimate death.
Most Pakistanis who earn Rs 50k or less (I earn Rs 35k per month), don't have much room in their cash flows to absorb this hit.
Good intentions, positive vibes, hopes and dreams don't pay for rent, tuition fee, food and clothes. Rich Pakistanis can hope and dream because their cash flows can absorb increase in prices.
The people still want to support PTI and IK, but how do they do it when their stomachs are getting less full than before, or their rents have increased, or they have to pay more for utilities, or other basic needs.
If a person have to buy oil, flour, sugar, clothes, at higher price than before, because the prices have / or going to increase, then, regardless how much he is against corruption or pro-PTI or pro-IK, he will be cursing the current government.
We do not want to die during short term. In the long term, we are going to die anyways.
@UKdaaMIAN @AamnaFasihi High taxation and lower growth is not means to recovery. But it leads to more disasters and recession and is suicidal. Wish we had understanding of economics.
1. PTI had no choice but to go to IMF.		2. PTI had no choice but to devalue currency		3. PTI had no choice but to keep increasing Interest Rates. 		4. PTI had no choice but to increase tax rates 		5. PTI had no choice but to increase utility bill rates. 		6. PTI had no choice!

@83nasir @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman You are absolutely right, However, govt's enthusiasm for Austerity should not touch the 'potential' productive segments of the economy.
Layoffs is not the success we should cherish. It is economic failure at national level.
@AbbasiAisha Fareed Ayaz and Abu Muhammad - my all time favorite 😍
Business leaders need to understand the differences between economic policy on the national and international scale and business strategy on the organizational scale. https://t.co/gynMFKLFXT
If the Austerity drives downsizing, the govt actually snatch the income from the family. It will start affecting the segments of the economy too ie. reduces the aggregate demand.
The purpose of govt should not be 'profit' making or surplus budget. The purpose should be welfare of the people.
@ozabowath @faisalahmadj @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman "Running a country is not same as running an organization".
@ozabowath @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman Deficit is not a problem. No sovereign country runs on budget surplus.
@faisalahmadj @ozabowath @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman Right, we should keep in mind that cost cutting is not the ultimate goal. But it is just a means for more development projects, economic growth and peoples' well-being.
@ozabowath @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman Budget 'deficit' means that the government is creating income for people, hence creating a bigger wealth pie.
@ozabowath @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman The aim of running a country is not making "profit", but to create wealth and well-being of people. "Profitable" or Surplus Budget means the govt is not spending as much as it collects taxes.
@ozabowath @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman Running a Country is not same as running an organization. Their finances and economics are different. There are numerous articles and research on this.

Instead of "cutting expenses" mindset, PTI should focus on "increasing revenues" attitude. This the difference between 	1) conservative austerity driven economics and 	2) progressive wealth generation economics 		@Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @imran_sidra @ArsalanGhumman

@ZahraM_ZM @Asad_Umar You know what this economy really needs?		A massive fiscal stimulus in every sector over the next few years to create jobs. This can be provided by active govt's role. Of course private entrepreneurs can play huge part, but govt must ensure the right business environment too.
However, PTI-led govt must invest in development and economic growth. To do this, public expenditures should be increased in education, healthcare, tourism, development projects, scientific and technological research etc. @Asad_Umar
It would be a really great step by PTI-led govt if 'austerity' means to end end perks, plots, protocol for bureaucrats, parliamentarians, cabinet members;
Sir @Asad_Umar, creating Jobs and Economic Growth should be the focus of PTI-led govt. Does aggressive privatization under IMF program going to help solve unemployment?
Policies which claims that the key to economic development is to open up, deregulate, liberalize and privatize.	The theory is fundamentally flawed.
Dear Sir @Asad_Umar You're doing important work, and I can applaud and say keep it up, only if you can keep Pakistan away from IMF. The option of going to IMF should be completely ruled out. Seek more options!

Message to @ImranKhanPTI on this amazing victory by PTI: Be humble, lets reconcile with everyone. We are all Pakistanis. You must take everyone along and "deliver". Lot of work is to be done to undo 70 years of corruption. Its just the beginning. https://t.co/FZCixHfSCK
Winning elections is just a first step towards the 'change' we want to see. PTI has a long way to make truly a Naya Pakistan. Remember and fulfill the promises which you made.
PPP ka sindh say safaya kab tk hoga? 😖
More than 50% of results are yet to be announced. PTI should not celebrate victory too early.
Charas pee ke sora hai Sindh. PPP phir se. 😞
@CyndhuAbbasi Watch Imran Khan's first few public appearances post-2013 elections.
Its time to support Imran Khan in national and international challenges. Keep political differences at side. I remember Imran Khan said in 2013, we will support Nawaz Sharif in all decisions of national interest.
Mil gayi vote ko izzat? 😋
@AdeelAhmedSays Adeel, please start working for the development of Sindh from the first day in Sindh assembly. We have huge expectations from young leadership of PTI. Kindly let me know if I can be of any help.

The people essentially blaming the army right now are no different than how how Mullahs and Right Wing Nuts use "Yahoodi Sazish".		Both are ridiculous and should be viewed as a conspiracy theory.		The army is backing PTI? Where's your evidence?
10 years in power PPP were unable to improve any indicators. Then they expect us to bring them again into parliament through our votes 😑

Don't know what kind of politicians are these idiots, by falsely associating the Army with Imran Khan. They are not decreasing his popularity but increasing it. Army is more popular then any political party.

@iShuffina Also read the book "Ultimate Resource, by Julian Simon
Huge demand for housing is an opportunity, not a threat. We should build more and more high-rise low cost housing, which are more efficient and require much less Land area.
@iShuffina State can actually create infinite money without increasing taxes and without hyper-inflation if the newly created money is for productive use. 	To know How, Read the book "Princes of the yen" by Richard Werner.
@iShuffina Population eventually starts aging. 		From 2% to 1.2% is 40% decline. Not 0.8% decline.
@iShuffina Food and Land is in abundance, enough for growing population if it is equally and fairly distributed. 		Water resources can be managed properly if there is a will.
@iShuffina State can provide any amount of money if it results in increased productivity and economic growth. Wasteful expenses should be curbed.
More engineers is better for the country.		More doctors are better for the country.		More businessmen is better for the country.		More sportspersons is better for the country. 		More lawyers are better for the country.
@iShuffina Instead of building more houses and schools, we are trying to solve problem by decreasing the demand, and killing babies. This is not right solution.  		PS: some countries have negative population growth.
There is no business or economic activity which will accelerate by declining population. Declining population will make us all poorer, not richer.
@iShuffina Educating the population is must. First Priority should be given to education. But why do we have set target of reducing population growth? What benefits would we likely achieve by reducing population?
@Illango_WB This is indeed funny target. Can our economy grow with declining population growth rate? Which segment of your economy would actually benefit from declining population? Which business would actually benefit from less population, instead of more population?

Z.A. Bhutto must be regretting his entire existence for evils are being committed on his name after death.
Because it's the right thing to do, and because it will help to form a progressive mindset for this and future generations.

Tarbela and Mangla are lowering to critical levels while projects like Neelum-Jhelum are shutting down on technical grounds with no possibility of immediate restoration. Power outages &amp; load shedding have already increased across the country &amp; the situation will only worsen.
In addition, Unit 2 and 4 of the Neelum Jhelum project have already been shutdown for similar reasons. This implies that only the Unit 3 of the project is functional.	There are serious questions on the execution of mega-projects as well as decision-making.
Neelum-Jhelum project: Unit 1 is no more functional. 	Despite leakage of oil, it was kept functional till May 31 which marked the end of PMLN's term.	Khadim-e-Aala's statement that caretaker setup should be questioned against outages becomes controversial. https://t.co/1X6j6xP2L6

Rising housing cost and availability of cheap housing in city centers is also one of the important issues faced by average middle class families which needs to be addressed.
Young people are mostly worried about availability of right job and business opportunities.

@ParkashSays @Shahid_H_Raja Let's analyse electricity generation mix by source of each of these countries. Here is what China looks like. China is number 1 producer of solar panels but still mainly produce electricity from Coal. https://t.co/2slc2mPS3r
@Shahid_H_Raja Solar is an inferior technology and should not be artificially supported by subsidies and regulations. Let the markets decide.
@Shahid_H_Raja These California like regulations only make housing more expensive and huge burden on poors. And not at all suitable for high-rise buildings. California model, I think, is also flawed.
@Shahid_H_Raja Solar panels produce cheap electricity, They don't need subsidies. European model is flawed.
@Shahid_H_Raja Why do we HAVE TO Solarized our energy needs? Does it have economic or technical advantage? Any country who mainly produce Electricity from sun?
@ParkashSays What is that? :D
@ParkashSays Instagram Maybe :)
@ozabowath What is the future of PIBTL? I am holding at  good average but like always I have doubts on it's growth. Sahiwal Coal Plant ki any updates?
@ozabowath Hopefully!
I guess I will have to hold #PAEL shares for a long time. Currently I am at 33% loss. 😤
@Shahid_H_Raja Is there any feasible, cost-effective way to dump solar plates every 25 years which doesn't effect our environment? What about lots of lithium batteries? I hope we have enough lithium and environment-friendly ways to dump them.
@Shahid_H_Raja Solar plates needs to replace every 25 years. Atleast 4 times in every 100 years. I hope the earth have enough silicon resources to cater this need.
@Shahid_H_Raja There are lots of technical issues which needs to be studied before allocating huge amounts on Solar Parks. Reliability is one issue. I should get electricity whenever I need, doesn't need to depend on weather.
@Shahid_H_Raja *Solar Energy System
@Shahid_H_Raja Solar Energy Started will Raise Housing &amp; Energy Prices But Do Little to Reduce Emissions. Or does it really reduce significant carbon emissions?
@Shahid_H_Raja 3. Why not Gas Generators, Hydro, Nuclear? Does Solar parks have technical advantages over others?	4. It just drive the cost of housing and electricity.
@Shahid_H_Raja 1. "People do it themselves" shouldn't be normal course of action. What is govt doing with our tax money? 	2. Someone have to pay for these subsidies. If it is cost-effective as compared to traditional source of electricity, it doesn't need subsidies.

@ozabowath Yes, proper planning is a must. Whether high-rise or low-rise housing.
@ozabowath My point is that high-rise buildings provides cheap housing facility for low and middle class families. Water consumption per capita is much less in high-rise. Dense population is major driver of economic growth. All major cities around the world have high-rise buildings.
@ozabowath we need to make efficient use of land area so that we can build more sport grounds as you like it.
@ozabowath With mix use of land i.e. residential and commercial, we reduce the need to travel by car. I live in flats in Gulshan-e-Iqbal; schools, colleges, restaurants, shops, everything is in walking distances.
@ozabowath High-rise buildings are more efficient in water consumption per capita. Land area usage is more efficient in high-rise buildings. It also provides cheap housing.
Why can't we have debates of Prime Minister candidates in Pakistan like that in USA, France etc?

If I invest Rs 100,000/- in solar energy system for my home, what should I expect a reasonable payback period?
@Alyakkash44 @NailaIdrees94 @betterpakistan @iam_uzair_syed Not it we keep exporting towels, underwears, bedsheets etc and keep importing luxury items like cars, mobile phones etc.
@Alyakkash44 @NailaIdrees94 @betterpakistan @iam_uzair_syed Exporters are earning some extra money at the cost of importers. The net balance is still in negative.

The focus should be on economy, education, health care, progressive taxes, and all other components of a welfare state.

PPP has always been a source of embarrassment for Sindh and its people.
Out of 47 million people living in Sindh, how many people can read and write in atleast one language?
What should be the relationship between Consultants and Contractors in civil works? Consultants are supposed to monitor, supervise and evaluate progress and quality of contractors. But contractors seems to ignore consultants altogether when needed.

#50YearsOfPPP: After 50 years, anybody who is anyway associated with PPP should be ashamed of themselves.

@filmyjoyo @Cheese_Pakora Oh come on!
@filmyjoyo @Cheese_Pakora I am not, I know someone who is in that group. 😉
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Compared to gas-fired which produce electricity at 6cents/kwh in Pakistan.
@filmyjoyo @Cheese_Pakora Soul Sisters Hyderabad's group is nothing more than fashion tips and commodity buying/selling group 😂😂
@filmyjoyo I'm confused about the definition of being a 'liberal' but were Uzair Baloch, Zulfiqar Mirza, Altaf Hussain company liberal or not?

Why there is sudden surge in #Siemens #Pakistan stock prices? #psx #kse #kse100 https://t.co/hmuRIClLSY
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Generation tariff for Solar and wind power plants in Pakistan is around 22cents/kwh which is very expensive.
@junejo_iqra Good. What was the issue btw? Any news link?
@junejo_iqra no 😂
@AamnaFasihi 😇😇 https://t.co/9McZYBCGOH
@AbbasiAisha @browngirlzee Twitter is opium of masses, becoming waste of time.
@AamnaFasihi I hope people don't think it is religious bias 😓
@AamnaFasihi What's in the name. Her voice is annoying af. That's the point 😁
@POSITIVEiBANKER For long time investors, daily fluctuations in stock prices do not matter.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Please revise your cost estimates. Solar and Wind is much expensive than you think it is. Gas-fired plants and Nuclear produce much cheaper electricity. We can also depend on indigenous coal and save FX. We need cheap and reliable source which doesn't depend on weather conditions
I tuned to Radio FM100 after a long time to see if DJ Cressella still sucks. She is still the same 😂
@POSITIVEiBANKER Small investors should avoid stock market anyways. Speculations and gambling is not what economy is.
Can't believe people still love and listen to DJ Cressella.
@GibranAshraf I don't think Nuclear has very high installation and operation cost. But it do might have international political cost.
@GibranAshraf Yup. Hydro is the best among all. Second is Nuclear if you fear CO2 emissions.
@GibranAshraf I don't deny Climate Change.
@GibranAshraf Whatever we do to save environment will be off set by China, India and other countries who rely heavily on fossils. Environment should be our secondary concern. First, affordability and reliability.
@GibranAshraf Don't worry about the stocks, the planet have enough resources for next more than few centuries. What really matters is the cost NOW. We need cheap and reliable Electricity.
@GibranAshraf I hope the life of Solar and Wind power plants will remain &gt;20 years. 	Installation cost/power generated p.a. is a good measure instead of installation cost/capacity.
@SaddamMemon1 @SaeedGhani1 @BBhuttoZardari @FaryalTalpurPk She is THE Adi ;)
@GibranAshraf The upfront generation tariff for Solar/wind is around 13-14 cents/kwh. 		For Gas/Coal, it is Rs6-7/kwh 		If solar/wind capacity increase, will the average tariff increase or decrease?
@junejo_iqra I would love to help. Let's meet and educate me what exactly is the issue here?
Today three more license has been issued to construct wind power plants on "Take or Pay" basis. 		1. Deh Kohistan 7/3 &amp; 7/4 Tapo Jungshahi, Taluka &amp; District Thatta		2. Son Walhar, Taluka Kotri		3. 7/1 Tapo Jhimpir, Deh Kohistan
Every MW increased by Wind/Solar  energy would result in higher cost of electricity per unit.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Hmmm....! What I understand from this article is that the coal-fired power plants will be gradually replaced by Gas-fired power plants due to economical reasons.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Major economies like America, Germany, China, India, Japan are not among them :)
@Masoodlohar @Qasimsoomro Sufism alone cannot defeat any force. We have to provide such socio-economic environment where even the most deprived people have the opportunity to lift themselves up from their current status.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 It is interesting that Canada, France, Netherlands, Austria and Finland whose energy source was never been Coal, are now phasing out.		Germany is still one of the major coal consumer. and will remain so for a long time.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 China has not banned coal-fired power plant forever. It has just halt construction of "new" power plants til the year '2018'.
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 https://t.co/XsemhPdpnj
@N_e_w_s_360 @zlj517 Where do you get such rubbish NEWS from? Who says coal is ban worldwide?

There are few privileged children who get education from the young age. However, there are many who can't but desire to learn to read and write. They look towards us to help them.
I have recently started frequently traveling to Umarkot, Chachro and other remote areas of Thar. What saddens me is that there are many children who are deprived of basic education. These children are full of potential but wasted. Can we do something for them? @Qasimsoomro

All imported furnace oil-based power plants should be replaced by indigenous coal-based power plants to avoid effects of external economic shocks.

@arsaljafri There were good sessions as well. I wish you could understand Sindhi, then I would have strongly recommended you to listen Amar Jalil.
@junejo_iqra Nope. Subharen rest kandi :D
@junejo_iqra Yes. Munjo khas shoq na ho wanar jo. Ammi khe shoq ho :D

@junejo_iqra He is more interested in Sindhi literature and history. But I will confirm specific session from him.

Is Army the root of all evils in Pakistan and responsibility does not lies with politicians and civil bureaucracy?
I don't understand why Anti-Army is still favorite topic of most discussions.
I attended Sindh Literature Festival today held in Beach Luxury Hotel.
@junejo_iqra Aitazaz Ahsan's session is too late 😭
@junejo_iqra Moazzam Junejo will go tomorrow. He also said that he didn't go today because he wanted to attend tomorrow's sessions

@AbbasiAisha Agri products and textile have already reached to its crest. Can we rely on it? 	Selling Kino is better than selling computers?
@AbbasiAisha That's why we should not depreciate PKR when we shouldn't the most. This is the time to import.
@AbbasiAisha The more we wait, the more we loose. We should develop new comparative advantage to catch up in 21st century.
@AbbasiAisha The right time to try new things is always: 'now'.
@AbbasiAisha Focusing on agriculture and textile alone won't lead us anywhere. We dont have high-tech high-value exports. We SHOULD.
@AbbasiAisha Diverse exports, we should think beyond textile and agri exports. support local high-tech industries. Reduce unnecessary imports.
@AbbasiAisha Depreciation = inflation increase, inelastic import bills increase, debt &amp; liabilities increase, budget deficit increase, growth decrease
@AbbasiAisha Some so-called "experts" advocate depreciation to boost exports. However, it will have negative impact on imports and external debt service

@iShuffina @SaddamMemon1 Earnings on shares or dividends on shares are halal. It is earned through investing in real businesses.
@iShuffina @SaddamMemon1 There are three ways of trading. 1. technical analysis	2. Speculation (calculated risk taking, trends)	3. Blind gambling (Haram)
@iShuffina @SaddamMemon1 Gambling is obviously Haram, but investing in real businesses is not. It depends how you trade.
@SaddamMemon1 @iShuffina Stock Market mai jo Harampayi hoti hai, wo Haram Hai, price manipulation etc. Else I believe stock trading itself is not wrong.
Have been reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. I recommend this book if you want to learn how to manage personal finances.

I hope there won't be another NRO. There should not be any tolerance for corrupt politicians and looters.
@AliRazaTweets Agreed, this should be the pre-condition.
@AliRazaTweets He is a great debater and spokesperson. He can represent PTI better than many.
@AliRazaTweets He was representing Altaf Hussian at that time. Understandable. But we should welcome everyone who in anyway useful for PTI.
