Last year as President Trump took the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, we called attention to his inaction on anti-LGBTQ violence around the world, including in Chechnya https://t.co/D8o9JfT9fR
In October of 2017, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution condemning anti-LGBTQ violence in Chechnya, and the White House remained silent	https://t.co/7G8BMhf1xm
In May of 2017, the White House said it was “not aware” if the President had even been briefed on the attacks on LGBTQ people in Chechnya. https://t.co/4nkQwwGn6O
In April of 2017, we called on President Trump to condemn the attacks on LGBTQ people in Chechnya, something he has still failed to do. https://t.co/CWureIpmK2
At the time, Haley condemned the attacks and said, “If true, this violation of human rights cannot be ignored” https://t.co/TCNeWQqUAc
In 2017, we pressured then U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley to condemn the reported attacks on LGBTQ people in Chechnya: https://t.co/CQfssOWid3

The bottom line is that discrimination against LGBTQ people is bad for business. Lawmakers should take notice. We're watching and ready to fight back.
In 2017, a bill targeting transgender people failed to make it out of a special session in Texas after being criticized by companies based in the state. https://t.co/BIqAYutBV0
In 2016, an anti-LGBTQ bill in Georgia was vetoed after Hollywood, sports leagues and corporations spoke out against it. https://t.co/rIql8yPpvD

Alright y’all, I’m signing off to go enjoy the after party. Hope you had fun watching #GoodTrouble with me! 👋🏻💖 @meg_townsend https://t.co/aJOZdM7n0E
Also super happy to see #GoodTrouble is elevating the stories of queer people of color. And the characters we’ve seen so far are series regulars (so we’ll get to explore a lot more with them)! Come through @shrrycola #tommymartinez
GAEL!! I’m so excited to see #GoodTrouble introduce a lead bi guy. Our Where We Are on TV report counted only 33 bi+ regular or recurring men characters across broadcast, cable, streaming. Looking forward to where his story goes in this season. https://t.co/zJjmLjlv57
I like that they brought over the dinner table aspect of The Fosters to #GoodTrouble,  it’s nice to see everyone get a moment together. Who do you wanna know more about in The Coterie? I’m looking forward to more of Malika’s story.
If you’re thinking the #GoodTrouble pilot looks like a movie, it’s because #CrazyRichAsians director Jon M. Chu directed. This is not your mama’s Fosters. (See what I did there? Mama’s? Miss u tho Stef and Lena.)
Love our first glimpse of Alice! Check out this video with @shrrycola to learn more about one of tv’s new series regular lesbian characters. #GoodTrouble https://t.co/Dfq8rTDedC

While the current law forbids any sort of LGBTQ-related activities, the SSMPA effectively criminalized LGBTQ people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.
Former President Goodluck Jonathan signed the SSMPA into law on January 7, 2014 with the goal to prohibit marriage equality, and the law has left many LGBTQ people in peril. https://t.co/DFqvgoHD4H

"The film is bloody and obsessed with trans bodies in a way that reminds us that a cisgender person wrote and directed it. It's trans trauma porn and, as a cisgender person, I'm warning trans people not to watch it and cis people not to fall for it" @into https://t.co/7EaFJWEUkO
