So please educate yourself of the most responsible ways of being Gun Owners. Upon doing so make a decision to push for only gun control policies that will not continue doing harm to the Freedoms we have in this country.
Though thre are individuals who would desire to disarm this country and undo the principles the forefathers laid out in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Right. We have already lost some through the #PatriotAct by Bush and #ProlongedDetention by Obama. 2/3
#NeverAgain :	There is a concern to not dishonor this impressive movement by all who were effected in the #ParklandSchoolShooting	. This is to enlighten many to an awareness that #guncontrol needs to cautious tackled. For by the 2nd Amendment we have a right to bar arms.1/3

How many lies will Americans believe out of President Trump's mouth. In the State of Union Speech he expressed being their to take care of those in Puerto Rico. Yet he ordered FEMA to pull out back in October and here is an article describing them doing that. 	Website will come
@politiburr @JediMasterJBell @suzan5150 @SenSanders Or could that move of been due to the tax cuts?
@politiburr @JediMasterJBell @suzan5150 @SenSanders As my mom expressed her view the Wal-Mart program they offer with the App. It is them in competition with Amazon. Along with it may not be paying off as much as they desired. 	So they laid off and closed all those Sam Clubs to focus the Wal-Mart brand.

@4everNeverTrump Please share a valid source of this slogan of Trumps betting from that of the KKK, neo-nazi, and so forth.
@realDonaldTrump As you also made a promise to tackle the opioid problem that is plaguing. Additional promise was to help provide substantial tax reforms. Along with helping the working class. And the border wall you promised would be paid by Mexico. 		Yet so many of these are empty promises.
@realDonaldTrump You ran on the platform of more than simple the standard of America First &amp; Make America Great Again. So smell the roses, wake up and realize this may be to much for you, and Resign.
