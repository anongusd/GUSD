Trump is having one hell of a day. First advertising his golf course on Twitter then attacking Congressional oversight as "bullshit" attacking Senator Hirono for no reason, threatens to withhold $30B in funds from colleges. Kim hangover?  https://t.co/ps2PpP6BPX
@RWPUSA Doesn't surprise me coming from Dershowitz who is trying to preserve what little integrity he has left and this case could completely shred any remaining vestige of credibility he has.
It is illegal to use the presidency for personal profit because of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However we forget that Trump isn't the president, he is the emperor.  https://t.co/Z6zrVxORLe

@Goss30Goss Trump said in one of the debates that he wouldn't agree to accept the results of the election. And that's when he thought he was going to lose. Imagine what the next one will be like. Does Congress actually need to pass a bill that says the President must step down if he loses?

@eugenegu @seekerwisdom1 @realDonaldTrump He's basically excusing Kim, by saying "The top leadership didn't know about it" "He wouldn't have allowed it to happen" "I don't believe he knew about it".  Does anyone believe Kim Jong Un would not know exactly what's happening to an American prisoner in North Korea? Trump.
@kylegriffin1 What a ridiculous stunt that was. Glad Congresswoman Tlaib called them out on it. Trump has insulted Black Americans over and over usually referring to them as low IQ or worse. 	Lebron James 	Maxine Waters	Colin Kaepernik	President Obama	LaVar Ball	Don Lemon	Omarosa	Spike Lee
@MrDane1982 @DeadpoolResists Sorry to hear about your struggles. You are not alone. Stay strong.
@jimsciutto No, and no president has ever met face to face with the leader of North Korea because that would have given him credibility and elevated the Korean Dictator to the international stage which they so desire. Trump didn't care, and so he will pay for his hubris and miscalculation.
@realDonaldTrump What is it about "and I will take him at his word" that was misinterpreted exactly?
@realDonaldTrump The problem is you don't know how to stand up to dictators and tyrants and murderers like Kim, Putin and MBS. You bow to them. You praise them. You fall in love with them.  You should be calling them out for what they did, which is ordered to have people murdered.
@realDonaldTrump The problem is you said you believe a dictator and a tyrant and a murderer. There's no way to take back those words as much as you might like to. Or not.

@NatashaBertrand I'm so glad to see the House finally exercising its oversight responsibility and not trying to investigate the FBI, DOJ, or Hillary's collusion with Russia LOL.
@mommamia1217 Cohen's body language, demeanor, succinctness and directness of his responses, and the amount of water consumed was in stark contrast to Matt Whitaker's stonewalling, prevaricating, pontificating, and drinking water voluminously as sweat was streaming down his forehead.
It's not about trusting a convicted white man. It's about knowing and understanding the history of this President who discriminated against Black Americans by not renting to them, said there were "good people on both sides" after Charlottesville, etc. etc. https://t.co/PebkI7L3y7

@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Too little too late. Hope you are disbarred.
Republicans on the House Oversight Committee obviously have no interest in oversight of the Executive Branch.
Suddenly Republican Oversight Committee members are very interested in foreign payments to Cohen, whereas they have shown ZERO interest in knowing if Trump has profited from foreign entities on his multiple properties and golf courses around the world.
@realDonaldTrump We the American people are soooo glad you are having a fabulous time with Kim Jong-un, the brutal dictator who murders his own family members, rules the country with an iron fist, wants to dominate the Korean Peninsula, and oh yeah, NUKE THE U.S. Do your damn job protecting us!!
@realDonaldTrump Wait, aren't you supposed to be hanging out, err...I mean negotiating with "your friend" the brutal dictator who murders his own family members, rather than spending time on Twitter? Or is that just another charade to make you appear to be the greatest President in history.
Based on body language, the succintness of their replies, and the volume of water each respectively consumed in the space of three hours, it is clear that Whitaker was stalling and lying most of the time while Cohen has been direct and truthful.
@realDonaldTrump Didn't realize you had Executive Time while negotiating with "your friend" the brutal dictator who murders his own family members and imprisons large swaths of his population. Glad to see you still have time to tweet about Cohen.
For two years we watched and waited as the do nothing Republican House played interference and obstructed for the White House by attacking the FBI, DOJ, and holding countless pointless hearings to undermine their credibility. The games are over. Hold them accountable.
The very act of threatening and intimidating a witness and his family should be enough to have Trump removed from office.
@psychdr100 Because that's how tyrants role. He shares much more in common with Dictator and Kim Jong-un than his supporters care to admit.
Funny watching the Republican Oversight members doing cartwheels to avoid asking any questions about criminal activities by the President. They repeatedly accused Cohen of lying (which he already admitted to) without recognizing that he was lying to cover for the President.

Art of the deal.
@johnrobertsFox @lakesideliberal @WhiteHouse I hate to say wake up to an esteemed reporter, but, I hope you weren't sincerely surprised by this move?

@darrin_borden @BillKristol I see, so you believe Putin too?  And the seismic monitoring data of North Korea's nuclear tests are made up?
@MedianPolitics @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump How about.	1) Said he "believes Putin" rather than his own intelligence agencies.	2) Has said nothing about Russia seizing two Ukrainian ships which are still in Russian hands	3) Has yet to release any notes from private meetings with Putin	4) Lied about Tower deal in Moscow

It's difficult to overstate how harmful it is to the national security of the United States to pretend there is no longer a nuclear threat from an unstable regime like North Korea. This is the leverage that Trump brings to the second summit on Monday.  https://t.co/iVAeVTzvDF

@djlavoie All of which begs the question of when he had the conversation with Putin about North Korea's nuclear missiles from which the famous "I believe Putin" quote arose. If it wasn't during a phone call it must have been one of his off the record one-on-one meetings with Putin.
@BradMossEsq His actions and words bears a striking resemblance to the Dear Leader Kim Jong Un. Whether he recognizes that or not is another question. I doubt it, but that is part of the problem. He has no self awareness. Most narcissists don't.
@WalshFreedom Because even if he didn't conspire with Russia to influence the election, he desperately wants to build his Trump tower in Moscow, seriously admires Putin, and doesn't want to damage whatever "personal' relationship he might have with him. He's playing the long game financially.

@realDonaldTrump One minute your singing praises for a dictator running a totalitarian regime who murders his own family, imprisons large segments of his population, and has nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities. Then you whine about press and the Mueller investigation. Have you lost your mind?
@realDonaldTrump In the space of an hour you jump from praising a tyrannical dictator who has nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities (think about that for a minute). No SERIOUSLY. STOP. THINK. Contemplate what ONE nuclear missile can do to a U.S. city. This is no joking matter or a publicity tour.
@realDonaldTrump This may come as a surprise to you, but we lost 54,246 American lives in the Korean War. This is not a country that you want to be singing praises for. It is run by a murderous dictator. I know you think you know him, but you really don't. He is a master manipulator.
@realDonaldTrump You should probably go visit North Korea and the detention camps where large swaths of the population are forced to do hard labor. This is not a good country. It is run by a maniacal tyrant who wants his nuclear weapons and will lie to keep them. Don't be suckered by another liar
@realDonaldTrump You praise dictators, but you call the American press the enemy of the people. You do realize China and North Korea have nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities don't you? One or more of them is aimed at Washington DC. You honestly need to get your head out of your ass.
@realDonaldTrump Let me get this straight. You have a great relationship with a murderous dictator (this is not hyperbole) but you think the FBI, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Adam Schiff, and Democrats are traitors. There is something very seriously wrong with you.
Nice to see such a unified front and common understanding of terminology between Trump and his top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer right in front of the China Trade Delegation, in the Oval Office no less. Trump, the art of the deal. https://t.co/Kakid7HtIw
Thank you Congressman Amash for upholding the Constitution. https://t.co/XlobTm1MfN

I hope Omarosa is right about this one. I would love to see Cohen dish the dirt on Ivanka, Don Jr. and Jared Kushner.  https://t.co/t0EU7fdmKt via @YouTube
@realDonaldTrump The people of the United States stand at the threshold of history, ready to reclaim their country – and their future....
@joncoopertweets How very true. He's done more than enough to undermine his credibility with the American people and proven that he is unfit to lead.  Before he ever won the election.  Wouldn't release taxes. Assaulted women. Committed adultery. Paid hush money. Wouldn't rent to Black Americans.
@Goss30Goss @girlsreallyrule @SenFeinstein What is it lately with stories about prominent Democratic women supposedly being rude?  Why not focus on the real issues like Trump &amp; GOP denying climate change, Trump failing to acknowledge Coast Guard potential mass murderer in our midst, &amp; Trump saying he "believes Putin".
@joncoopertweets Well that's not good.
@BarbMcQuade Thank you Barb. I've been wondering what's taking so long and haven't seen anything in the news about it.  As always you shed great light on these issues.
“I think it’s a shame,” Trump told reporters during an afternoon appearance in the Oval Office. “I think it’s a very sad thing when a thing like that happens. I’ve expressed that.” Uh, no you haven't "expressed that." This is your first comment. https://t.co/P9SdXFmi6n
“I believe there are sciences on both sides that are accurate,” Craft told the Canadian broadcaster. “Both sides have their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science.” Oh dear Lord heaven help us. https://t.co/dmDK6Hipu6
@realDonaldTrump Kelly Knight Craft has given the GOP &amp; your campaign over $2 million. Remember drain the swamp? Well this is textbook definition of filling the swamp. Also you are profiting personally every time she stays at your hotel which she has done over 20 times.
@realDonaldTrump Interesting how Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination because she hired an undocumented worker and didn't report her taxes properly. Sounds strangely familiar. Oh, that's right YOU hired dozens of undocumented workers and have yet to release your tax returns. Still under audit?
@PamKeithFL I agree. If there's one thing we should have learned from the 2016 election it is that divided we fall. We can and must stay united. ANY Democratic candidate is better than Trump, let's not attack our own and give the right further ammunition. We must win this one!
@ida_skibenes I agree and was glad to see so many women elected to Congress in November. Predictably the overwhelming majority were Democrats because we know where Republicans stand when it comes to power sharing with women and minorities. I support &amp; wish our new Congress women success!
The swamp has never been swampier. The drain must have plugged and it is now overflowing. https://t.co/7zt7qo8ksZ
@SecretarySonny @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Because they are now buying soybeans that they used to buy but stopped buying because of tariff retaliation, but have now started buying again you're going to claim victory? If this is how you ran your business I can see why you declared bankruptcy 6 times. What a charade.
@thehill At least she didn't make her staff eat salad with a comb.
@Lawrence Dershowitz was part and parcel of the plea agreement and no doubt had something to do with not notifying the victims. The question is, how did he have that kind of leverage over Acosta?
Trump says as much (or perhaps more) with his silence as he does with his Tweets. His followers know exactly what he's saying when he turns the other cheek. His silence in this case speaks volumes and is frankly sickening.   https://t.co/Q7J0lNRY5S
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If you are such a big supporter why do continue to insult so many Black Americans?Why not apologize and stop using racist rhetoric.		Lebron James	Maxine Waters	Colin Kaepernik	Don Lemon	La David Johnson's widow	Andrew Gillum	Abby Phillip	Yamiche Alcindor
@BreckStorm @wvjoe911 The tattoo is on his back. That should tell us something.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump @OANN OANN is a right wing network that promotes conspiracy theories, not news.
@realDonaldTrump You attack patriotic Americans and the American press incessantly.		People you have not attacked:	Kim Jung Un	Vladimir Putin	Xi Jinping	Rodrigo Duterte	The Coast Guard Office who was plotting to kill dozens of Americans		You have a strange sense of patriotism.

I'm wondering it Trump supporters recognize the difference between this story and Pizzagate. Something tells me they can't. ‘This is literally Pizzagate’: MSNBC guest says Trump’s labor secretary must go over Epstein plea deal https://t.co/xNa6ADjbF8
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel Who are you more worried about Michael Cohen or Robert Mueller? Can't wait to hear what Cohen has to say next Wednesday.
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel Let's face it, you haven't read the article, because you don't read. Especially not the Wall Street Journal, too many big words for you.
@kdt471 @funder That's my theory too.
@funder Since Epstein is back in the news it might be time to refresh our memories. The lawsuit accusing Trump of raping a 13-year-old girl, explained https://t.co/Y0foLFdoLs … via @voxdotcom

@MichaelCohen212 I am glad you are now telling the truth. I wish you had started long before now. You helped elect @realDonaldTrump.  For that we cannot forgive you. Aside from being a racist, misogynist, homophobe, he is a traitor to this country. How could you represent him?
Because this is how Trump rolls. Unilateral, dictatorial, tyrannical, power hungry. Next step is for him to keep the Democrats from fielding a Presidential candidate and he will have joined the ranks of his favorite countries, North Korea, Russia, &amp; China. https://t.co/CwdQLnDnhx
So looking forward to not having to hear any more talk about a "hoax" and "no collusion" and "witch hunt". Then again, it probably won't stop even after the report comes out, will it?  https://t.co/YZ81BLJyaX
@joncoopertweets Couldn't get a top secret security clearance, received one anyway through suspicious circumstances and unusual intervention, had to "revise" his financial disclosure form numerous times, bestest buddies with accused murderer Mohammed in Salman. What a guy.
@joncoopertweets Padding the bank account I see.
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You can tweet this all you want, it won't change the racist person you are.
@realDonaldTrump You lied about all of these things:	1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower deal IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications
@realDonaldTrump Why this tweet when everyone has been reporting the Mueller investigation is almost over? Are you worried about the results, and want to undermine it before it comes out? You sound like a guilty man.
@Redpainter1 Or that Putin threatened to use new nuclear weapons against us, or that SPLC issued a report showing increase in white nationalist hate groups, or that pedophile and Trump friend Jeffrey Epstein's plea agreement was ruled illegal.
@TuckerCarlson Because you were outed?
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Why have you not commented on -	Putin threatening to target U.S. cities with new nukes	SPLC report about the rise of domestic white nationalist hate groups	Coast Guard Officer plot to kill Democrats and journalists	These are the real threats to our security, not Jussie Smollett.
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Sadly this is what our president and his followers choose to focus on. They ignore the real threats to our national security - like Putin's threatening to target U.S. cities with new nukes (crickets), or the rise of domestic white nationalist hate groups (crickets).
By hiring someone to rig ballots he committed a crime that his own son who is an attorney warned him about. Now he wants a do over. Uh, sorry criminals don't get a mulligan.We'll see you in court, not the campaign trail.  https://t.co/xlayLvgKIs

@naretevduorp @joncoopertweets @GOP Notice not a single word from the President on Putin's threat to target U.S. cities with new nukes. Or about the SPLC's new report on right wing hate groups on the rise. The "I believe Putin" President is trying to distract us while also undermining our national security.
@DavidCornDC I predict Trump will appoint Devin Nunes as the new DNI. Then all of his problems will be solved. 😉	Devin Nunes was not supposed to be in the hearing when McCable briefed the Gang of 8 about Trump Russia asset, but noone said a word. Cowards on the Hill, get what they deserve.
@TuckerCarlson You're just digging your hole deeper Tucker.  You were caught in the act and now you're trying to put the best spin on it. You are a fake and a hypocrite. He never said you couldn't say want you wanted on air, he said you were influenced by BILLIONAIRES. Hard to rebut the truth.
@AynRandPaulRyan I love listening to this. Tucker keeps saying "Wait why don't you tell me how it works" and Rutger tells him, and Tucker then repeats the question because he can't believe the guy just nailed him.
@joncoopertweets Notice not a single word from the President on this very alarming report. Also not a single word from the President on Putin's threat to target U.S. cities with new nukes. The "I believe Putin" President is trying to distract us while also undermining our national security.
@TheRickyDavila Sadly this is what our president and his followers choose to focus on. They ignore the real threats to our national security - like Putin's threatening to target U.S. cities with new nukes (crickets), or the rise of domestic white nationalist hate groups (crickets). #NotDoingJob
@AdamsFlaFan @PalmerReport I agree, Mueller could submit his report at the same time as any new indictments against Kushner, Don Jr., are released. That would put intense pressure on Barr to release the full report. If Barr is the lawman everyone claims, he will look at the evidence and say "holy shit."
@ChrisLu44 @hxernst There is very little evidence to back up pretty much any claim made by the White House these days.  Nearly everyone surrounding him has been sucked into the vortex that is Trump's alternate version of reality through repeated lies and bullying from the "I believe Putin" President
@GuardianUS Tucker Carlson showing his true colors. Cuts off his own guest and calls him a F#ing moron because he said Tucker was beholden to billionaire donors who make him a millionaire. Tucker couldn't handle the truth and exploded in a vile tirade against this Dutch economist.
@UROCKlive1 That is a very good question. Trump will obviously use the idiotic stooge defense, but will that hold up? Given his lengthy history of publicly praising Putin, changing the GOP platform at the convention, it seems deliberative, not spur of the moment. A jury will recognize this.
@DenbrotS @PrincessBravato Every day seems to bring new revelations about how corrupt and compromised the White House is. It is astounding.
@PhilippeReines Day one in office was the beginning of his end. Colluded with Russia to steal the election, acted as a possible agent for Russia, nearly every one around him has been convicted or pleaded guilty to committing crimes, and he's corrupt, won't release taxes, and profiting from.
@kylegriffin1 @PrincessBravato This is highly unusual historically but not unexpected coming from a President who has not released his tax returns and runs one of the most secretive White Houses in history.  Meanwhile his spokespeople (Sarah and Kellyanne) claim he is the most transparent ever. Really? Hogwash
@kaylatausche And two of the men sitting on the American side of the table are totally corrupt. Time to drain the swamp and allow more women to be in charge for a change.
@realDonaldTrump Do you still believe Putin? https://t.co/jVFRx12NzB
@TheRickyDavila Agreed, especially when legitimate hate crimes are on the rise. This distracts from the real hurt and pain that is being caused. That said, this is one isolated incident but Republicans will make much more hay out of than the SPLC's report about increasing right wing hate groups.
@realDonaldTrump Please read this before you make any more comments about El Paso. 	https://t.co/zEOlmXsa4J
@psychdr100 It's past time for the news organizations to sue Trump for threatening them. It's no different than Roger Stone posting a photo of the judge with crosshairs. Trump is doing the same thing verbally and in writing on Twitter every day! https://t.co/inUMPAXZMB
@realDonaldTrump Today might be a good time to begin reading your PDB (that's Presidential Daily Brief) which may include valuable information on the Huawei 5G network and why we don't want to begin using it. Do your job of protecting the United States, and stop listening to Putin.
@realDonaldTrump So now you're spending your time making decisions pertaining to individual immigrants? That seems like a very valuable use of your time. Do you do this before or after your Executive Time?

@SethAbramson @Blues_Fish I believe Trump will be the 2020 nominee. He has consistently defied the odds. I thought he'd be impeached his first year in office, but here we are two years later and we don't even have the Mueller report yet. The wheels of justice turn very slowly in this country.

Trump obviously questions the intelligence he receives from Coats and his intelligence agencies in his PDB (which he apparently only reads sporadically). Does he question the intelligence he receives from Putin? Apparently not. "I believe Putin." https://t.co/jNjNtZc1lL

@realDonaldTrump Once again you are accusing the press of doing exactly what you do. You are the most dishonest President in history. You make up your own alternative reality, You lie incessantly. And you are totally out of control according to McCabe, Cohen, Comey, Scaramucci, and Cliff Sims.
@realDonaldTrump Well this was predictable. You are the enemy of the American people and the enemy of the Free American press. And you therefore gleefully participate in denigrating them even though they do a very important service to our country, unlike the Covington students.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, you really take stupid to a new level. And so does Trey Gowdy. Rod Rosenstein wrote the memo under duress from you, not Nancy or Chuck. You are the one who fired Comey, not Nancy or Chuck. And you are the one who was under investigation, not Nancy or Chuck. You obstructed.
@realDonaldTrump You lied about all of these things:	1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower deal IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications

@realDonaldTrump Yes, because your favorite thing to do besides watch Fox and Friends is to watch yourself.
@realDonaldTrump You attacked the wife of Andrew McCable. It doesn't matter whether you called her a loser or not. You repeatedly and falsely attacked her for unethical behavior and that is bad enough. You have abused the power of your office. You have acted like a crime boss. You should resign.

@realDonaldTrump McCabe is telling the truth about you and you can't handle the truth. Why don't you come clean and admit that you said "I believe Putin" over your own intelligence agencies. Because you're a lyin cryin baby who's indebted to the Russians who stole the election for you that's why.
@realDonaldTrump From McCabe -		"How do you effectively convey intelligence to the American president who chooses to believe the Russians over his own intelligence services? And then tells them that to their faces?" 		What do you have to say to that?

@realDonaldTrump You've been on Twitter for at least the last three hours. Is this how you spend Executive Time? Your Intelligence briefing is coming up, but that's really pretty pointless isn't it, because you get your intelligence directly from Putin. The "I believe Putin" President.
@realDonaldTrump And you can't go to the bathroom without the approval of Sean Hannity. So what's worse. Andrew McCabe actually worked for James Comey. Apparently you actually work for Sean Hannity and Fox News.

@BillKristol @jeannefisher17 @realDonaldTrump And - when did you have that conversation with Putin?
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump I'm still trying to figure out when Trump had a conversation with Putin about North Korea's nuclear weapons. Could this have been during the Helsinki meeting? And why? Did he brief his intelligence chiefs about the conversation?
@EdKrassen And spent 80% of his time in "Executive Time".
@SethAbramson @FrankFigliuzzi1 I'm still not quite sure what his 'unauthorized disclosures' to the media were. Regardless, they seem like relatively minor offenses that would not warrant firing without retirement pay. This clearly smacked of vengeance by Trump. He loves doing this sort of thing.
@mmpadellan He's been using his case like a publicity stunt. This was a step too far. He's going to regret that move.
@RedTRaccoon He's been using his case like a publicity stunt. This was a step too far. He's going to regret that move.
@HarleyRouda In a tweet to Trump today I encouraged him to read about Lincoln who sought out a diversity of opinions counter to his own so that he might be more fully informed. I doubt Trump will read my tweet, much less a book about Lincoln.

@kharyp @HillaryClinton Love it! Will definitely share with Trump.
@SethAbramson Great work Seth. One thing I'd be interested in is background on Trump's comment that he believes Putin over intelligence agencies when it comes to nuclear weapons. When did Trump have a discussion about North Korea's nuclear weapons with Putin?
Frankly the bigger question is - when did Trump have a discussion about North Korea's nuclear weapons with Putin? Was this during one of the off the record one-on-one meetings? I'm sure the Intelligence Committee would like to hear from McCabe about this.  https://t.co/rrwjIMCWcA
@RawStory When you're a criminal you think everyone is always out to get you.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends There was no "coup attempt" you moron.  Even if the talked about the 25th Amendment, that is their right. This is a Democracy with a Constitution that guarantees freedom of speech as well as a means through the 25th Amendment to remove a tyrant such as you from the Oval Office.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The fact that you only follow 45 people on Twitter speaks to your myopic view of the world. You only listen to your handful of sycophants who regurgitate every word you say. Please read up on Lincoln who encouraged and sought out other opinions so that he would be informed.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing happened for God's sake. You are such a whiny cry baby. You talk about lyin' cryin' Comey, but YOU are THE BIGGEST lyin' cryin' baby to ever reside in the White House. Are you missing your pacifier?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends A coup is when you collude with a foreign power to subvert the democratic process to steal an election.  Which is exactly what you did, and why Comey, McCabe, were fired by you to cover up your illegal and treasonous activity. You will be held accountable.
Barr has his own special conflicts of interest when it comes to the Mueller probe. He sent an unsolicited 20-page memo to the Justice Department calling the inquiry into potential obstruction of justice by Trump “fatally misconceived”.

@joncoopertweets He is a wannabe dictator. Republicans through their silence every time he says or tweets such undemocratic authoritarian, Russia-like sentiments are allowing our country to drift down the path to tyranny.  Trump will gladly take the reins. He has disemboweled Congress &amp; DOJ.
Agreed. What IS unprecedented are Trump's relentless attacks on the FBI and the Special Counsel.  Yet they happen so frequently and so brazenly now that noone takes notice any more. We are slowly drifting down the path toward tyranny, and Republicans are asleep at the wheel. https://t.co/nT2P2sAh4a
@DavidCornDC What IS unprecedented are Trump's relentless attacks on the FBI and the Special Counsel.  Yet they happen so frequently and so brazenly now that noone takes notice any more. We are slowly drifting down the path toward tyranny, and Republicans are asleep at the wheel.
Now would be a good time to remember the day after Trump fired Comey he met with Lavrov and Kysliak in the Oval Office (only Russia press allowed) &amp; said “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job, I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.
Trump is leveling the same accusations of "selfish and destructive agenda" against McCabe that he did against Comey. Yet their stories are remarkably consistent. Trump demanded loyalty, wanted the Russia investigation dropped, and fired them when they wouldn't comply.
Trump fired Comey, McCabe, and threatened to fire Sessions multiple times. He basically came very close to completely decapitating the Department of Justice. Now he calls them liars and accuses them of colluding. Trump is a threat to our country. He doesn't know when to stop.
@SaysHummingbird He needed a "national emergency" as a distraction from all the bad news coming out of the Mueller investigation.  The distraction won't last. He will be held accountable.
@realDonaldTrump Political hoax? No collusion? The DAY after you fired Comey you met with Lavrov and Kysliak in the Oval Office (only Russia press allowed in) and said “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job, I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
@realDonaldTrump Witch hunt? No collusion? The DAY after you fired Comey you met with Lavrov and Kysliak in the Oval Office (only Russia press allowed in) and said “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job, I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
@realDonaldTrump Some day you'll be asked to explain the following:	1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel @WSJ No, he needs to remove you from office. As a member of your cabinet, he can in fact begin removal process under the 25th Amendment.  Have fun with that.
@KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump @WSJopinion We know you hate California because they voted overwhelmingly for Clinton. Hard to get over it for a small minded person like yourself who claims to have won the greatest Presidential victory in history, isn't it. Your childish school yard bully attitude shows through quite clear
@realDonaldTrump You lied about -	1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications	6) Manafort Kilimnik meeting
@realDonaldTrump You will soon be fired for lying to the American people.	Manafort gave polling data to Kilimnik.	Cohen gave bag of cash to rig polls.	You won't release notes from meetings with Putin, and want US to depart NATO.	You told Cohen to lie to Congress about Trump Moscow tower.
@realDonaldTrump It's called the CONSTITUTION and it's the 25th AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  And the FBI cannot initiate the 25 Amendment, only your own cabinet can. Please, please have someone brief you on the Constitution. Or better yet,  have them read it to you. It is way past due.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends No doubt better than your own intelligence agencies.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Every one of your tweets the past few days has been about hating the FBI. You are the first President in history to treat the FBI this way, and probably for good reason. If you were innocent you wouldn't be attacking them day in and day out.  Obsessed by your guilt.
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel @WSJ Actually no, the White House needs an infusion of credibility.
@Alyssa_Milano @punnycat_is_me Not only that, but also - has this man lost his marbles?
McCabe, Comey, Cohen, Scaramucci, Cliff Sims, Tillerson, all close to the President all say essentially the same thing. That he's a liar, untrustworthy, refuses to read, believes Putin over intelligence agencies, and displays shocking inability to think.	https://t.co/9li93thAaW
@PGenaux It really is difficult to comprehend how this man is our President.
After reading Trump's meandering, nonsensical speech declaring a national emergency (I can't watch him any more), and then this answer to a question about climate change, I'm re-reading the Constitution and the 25th Amendment.  It is more pertinent than ever. https://t.co/B6Ei9bmYas
@FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham's hypocrisy and abdication of his duty as a United States Senator to serve as a check and balance on the Executive Branch can only mean that he is either compromised himself or angling for a position in the White House. “I think he’s a kook,” “I think he’s crazy."
@TheRynheart @LindseyGrahamSC “I think he’s a kook,” “I think he’s crazy. I think he’s unfit for office.” 		- Lindsey Graham about Trump in February 2016
@joncoopertweets The fact that this guy is a senior adviser in the White House should scare us all. This is the guy who said President Trump's powers "will not be questioned." In any normal administration he would have been sidelined after a comment like that. Instead he's front and center.
@ursusmiratus @icepk I didn't respect Lindsey Graham when he was the lead prosecutor for the Clinton impeachment and I respect him even less now for his willful ignorance, hypocrisy, and failure to stand up to a President who has done far worse than Clinton. @NotDoingHisDuty
@TheSWPrincess It's becoming worse. Remember this one when asked about climate change? https://t.co/YSZtvVRqb3

@SethAbramson @malinablue Also, never give up trying to slowly but surely chip away at the alternative universe that Trump supporters are living in.  EVENTUALLY they will see that they are riding on a sinking ship and that Trump's presidency is mountain of lies.
@maggieNYT @anniekarni Couldn't have happened to a nicer, more unqualified person. Perhaps now he'll pick someone who actually knows something about U.S. foreign policy and international relations? Nah.
@keithboykin @Nysteveo2AOLcom Sad indeed, but funny as hell when Alec Baldwin does it! Parts of his monologue and all of the questions were nearly verbatim.  I read the transcript because I simply can't watch this train wreck of a President any more. It's bad enough reading his remarks.
@eugenegu @LauraTalbott @realDonaldTrump No doubt he has asked his personal attorney the Attorney General (whether that be Sessions or Whitaker) what type of prosecutorial action he can take against individuals in the news media, and/or the news media itself. He really has no concept of freedom of the press.
@stucam7771 @Melody28043518 There would be plenty of alt-right media sites out there to fill the empty void. Regardless, when the Trump presidency crumbles, and it will, I hope his personal propaganda network goes with him. They have been part and parcel to his plan of creating an alternative reality.
@realDonaldTrump You are proud to undermine our constitution, declare fake national emergency, destroy the rule of law, cozy up to dictators, work with a foreign power to rig our election. Don't fool yourself, you are undermining the core values America cherishes most.
@Kokomothegreat @MailOnline This makes me want to go to the border and record a day in the life along the Mexican border. I grew up in El Paso and know what the border looks like. We are not being invaded. Trump has brainwashed people into thinking there is an emergency, because he needs a distraction.
His presidency is built on a pyramid of lies. He has to keep perpetuating the lie that he is successful and that everyone else is out to get him. It's the only way he survives since he has obviously been an abysmal failure as President. https://t.co/e8hN3it7uy

@SenWhitehouse @lininohio Not surprised they didn't applaud. What is surprising is that Pence expected it. Europeans don't watch Fox News and hence are not subjected to the total brainwashing that Trump supporters have experienced in this country. They have not bought into Trump's alternative reality.
@joncoopertweets He didn't like the SNL cold open with Alec Baldwin.
@realDonaldTrump Had to watch yourself again this morning did you?
@realDonaldTrump YOU rigged the election. YOU are corrupt. And YOU are the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. Not the media.
@realDonaldTrump It's called the United States of America. This may be a foreign concept to you, but we live in a FREE society where the press has a FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT through the CONSTITUTION. I know, these are difficult concepts for you to grasp since you barely graduated grade school.

@safeagain1 @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson The stories coming out from former White House, Administration, and Executive Branch Agency officials are all remarkably similar and consistently paint a picture of an unhinged, tyrannical President with a mob boss mentality. What will it take to convince his supporters?
@RawStory Slowly but surely they are all being caught up in Trump's web of lies. They should be held accountable for perpetrating and knowingly propagating lies to the American people.
@EdKrassen The founders were wary of unbridled power in the Executive Branch and wanted to avoid having to be subservient to a king. Trump is coming close to that line, and his use of a national emergency sets the stage for further abuse of power.
@EdKrassen He admires dictators like Kim Jung Un ("we fell in love") and Putin ("I see no reason why he would have interfered in our election") to President Xi ("One of the things I'm most excited about the trade deal is that China will impose the death penalty for selling fentanyl").
@mmpadellan You are awake, but the nightmare isn't over yet. Sorry.
@RepSchneider @SnowBiAuthor Agreed. Conservatives by and large support Trump's national emergency declaration. 		What exactly is 'conservative' about declaring a national emergency when none exists &amp; pilfering money appropriated for other purposes to pay for a wall a majority oppose?
@SenatorDurbin @SnowBiAuthor They have forgotten the meaning of conservative. What exactly is 'conservative' about declaring a national emergency when none exists &amp; pilfering money appropriated for other purposes to pay for a wall a majority oppose?

@stonecold2050 Human excrement.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Please read the Constitution, then get back to us. Also don't rely on compromised people like Dershowitz who defended convicted serial child molester, and your close friend Jeffrey Epstein, who got off with lightest sentence ever and now lives on his own Caribbean island.
@Brasilmagic Seems to be a common theme with serial sexual assaulters.
Trump: “one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal” is the Chinese president’s pledge to execute people who deal fentanyl. 		There's another dictator who executes drug dealers: Duterte.		Trump is in good company.
@BillKristol @joncoopertweets Ah, the good ol' days before Republicans drank the orange faced Kool Aid.
Conservatives feigned outrage over false report that Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend was working on her staff. So what if he was? They have no problem with Ivanka, Jared, Eric Trump's brother in law, and more working for Trump. https://t.co/DvzBb9y1bU
How long do we leave a man like this in the Oval Office? His unhinged performance on Thursday explains why Rosenstein may have discussed the 25th Amendment. We should all be discussing the 25th Amendment. https://t.co/RsIFvXYKfG
Republicans who are hysterical about McCabe's comments about the 25th Amendment need to a) read the Constitution and b) calm the fuck down. The FBI can't invoke the 25th Amendment, only the Cabinet can. So take a deep breath and step back from the precipice.
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes Invoking the 25th Amendment, repeat Amendment, to the Constitution, is not a coup. Also FBI could not invoke 25th Amendment, only the Cabinet can, so please calm down.
@HoarseWisperer Snowed in in Seattle earlier this week. Loved curling up and reading Adrift, 76 Days Lost at Sea by Steven Callahan.
@joncoopertweets The sign on his desk says "The buck never stops here."
@americanmclass He said so many outrageous things that were lost in the absurdity of the moment. Like that he admires China for imposing the death penalty for drug dealing.
@thomaskaine5 Just like he stiffed all of his contractors.
@lisastark351 I wonder too. The speech today was nonstop gibberish. Mind vomit. Stream of consciousness. Regurgitation of rehearsed lies.  Nonsensical meanderings of a feeble mind. One step away from dementia. Perhaps already there.
@soledadobrien That look says it all. "I'm fucked aren't I? I'm never going to get another job,"
@soledadobrien Unfortunately for Sarah this is likely to be the last job she'll ever have.  She's due for a rude awakening when she re-enters the real world. Hope she's been stashing away the savings. Or dad has deep pockets.
@thehill Well wouldn't you know it. It was the wall that finally broke the camel's back. Metaphorically speaking. I'm not accusing Ann Coulter of looking like a camel.

@RawStory There was a time when flipping through channels I might actually watch Fox and Friends for a few minutes. What the hell was I thinking? Is it me or have they gone off the deep end. Talk about Trump supporter syndrome.
@nickiknowsnada Aw poor baby. Should've thought about family visitation issues when he was evading taxes, representing dictators, serving as a Russian agent, and trying to undermine our Democracy.
I'm not sure they would know a "national emergency" if it hit them in the head. And that's a scary thought. They are chasing windmills just like Don Quixote.  https://t.co/Wt84Ils1Tc
"In the meantime, I built a lot of wall. I have a lot of money, and I built a lot of wall. But it would have been nice to have gotten done."		Most of the press conference was like this. A stream of consciousness speech filled with pure, unadulterated gibberish.
In Trump's bewildering national emergency press conference, he said one of the thing's he's "most excited about" is that China will administer the death penalty for drug dealers. a) Is Trump out of his mind?? and b) what does this have to do with the wall? https://t.co/jgbDlaBVRg
In his bewildering national emergency press conference, Trump actually thanked Mexico. For what? Making the U.S. pay for the wall that Trump said over and over again would be paid for by Mexico?  https://t.co/jgbDlaBVRg
Trump shares Dershowitz quote saying use of 25th Amendment would be 'unconstitutional' Dershowitz lost all credibility when he defended Jeffrey Epstein, admitted child molester. What skeletons does he have in his closet? https://t.co/ylpSwOIapU
@Kokomothegreat I didn't watch it but I know EXACTLY what you are saying.  For the life of me I cannot understand why people who don't understand a word he's saying, because it is always nonsensical, support him. Perhaps it's because they can "read" into it whatever they want.
@SocialPowerOne1 For once I agree with her. I wonder if her statement includes her.
@Jersey_Craig CNN was able to debunk all her claims, from the number of vaccinated measles cases in WA to the claim that measles fights cancer.  It's like trying to convince a climate change denier that climate change exists. Pointless waste of energy. Except that lives are at stake.
@maggieNYT Trump has the intellect of a 10 year old, the emotional makeup of a 6 year old.
@BarackObama Thank you for your service and for supporting the Parkland students. We all miss you!
@SocialPowerOne1 It's shit talk like this that brings us one step closer to secession, and/or civil war. It's happened in plenty of other countries, why not here. It begins by demonizing the other side and whipping up hatred and distrust.

@realDonaldTrump Noone in the Obama Administration was indicted in his 8 YEARS in office. You've only been in office 2 YEARS and have had SIX advisers indicted or plead guilty to lying, obstructing justice, campaign finance fraud, or tax fraud. So who's the real lyin' cryin' criminal President?
@realDonaldTrump A majority of American voters believe that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has “uncovered crimes,” according to a new poll released Thursday.
@realDonaldTrump 1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications	6) Manafort Kilimnik meeting	#Treason

@realDonaldTrump Do you ever listen to yourself? poor little angel, crooked Hillary, Russia hoax, puppet for Leakin James Comey. You speak and write like a 2nd grader, perhaps because you have the intellect of a 2nd grader. Your stupid taunts and name calling are beneath the office of the Pres.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, they were fired and forced to leave BECAUSE OF YOU. They did nothing wrong other than investigate your connections to Russia.
@DavidCornDC Where there's smoke there's fire. They didn't lie for no reason.

@tedlieu Let's face it, he could be hiding the greatest conspiracy in American history.
@shossy2 Shows that Mueller has much more evidence to support his claim that Manafort lied. Someone's going down!
@RawStory What utter rubbish. A woman's right to chose and upholding Roe v. Wade is in no way comparable to supporting Nazis. He's willing to overlook the immorality and depravity of Trump if it serves his goal to outlaw abortion.

@realDonaldTrump 2. Please stop disparaging our wonderful city. Look at your own FBI data which shows that El Paso has NEVER been one of the highest crime cities in our country, before or after the wall was built. Stop using our city as an excuse for your stupid border wall.
@realDonaldTrump 1. Please don't come to El Paso. We don't want you here. We don't need you here. We don't want to hear more of your lies about our wonderful city. If you DO come, please get your facts and FBI data straight. El Paso has NEVER been one of the highest crime cities in the country.
@realDonaldTrump Working hard or hardly working? 70% Executive time does not qualify as working. It qualifies as watching tv. They are not the same.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Really? What fantasy world are you living in? Listen to your Intelligence Chiefs once in a while and you'll realize you don't know more than all your Generals.
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Sure, FACTS are now irrelevant. The only FACTS that matter to you are the lies swilling around in your own decrepit mind.  You will go down in history as the President who told more lies that any other President. Perhaps more than ALL OTHER PRESIDENTS combined.
@realDonaldTrump You are without a doubt THE laziest President in American history. You cannot try to rewrite it, and the history books will not lie about it. 70% Executive Time President. More golf than any President in history. More time at his own resorts than in President in history.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong again. Democrats are in favor of allowing a hearing for people requesting asylum. They are not advocating keeping criminal aliens. Obama deported more criminal aliens than you EVER will.  Because you are so focused on your stupid border wall.

Thank you for holding Matt Whitaker accountable. This was the first step in reclaiming our Democracy from a corrupt, incompetent administration. The hearing showcased their contempt of Congress with 8 hours of obstruction, filibustering, and avoiding Yes or No answers. https://t.co/FD4JGTXMuo
@RepRaskin Thank you for holding Matt Whitaker accountable. This was the first step in reclaiming our Democracy from a corrupt, incompetent administration. The hearing showcased their contempt of Congress with 8 hours of obstruction, filibustering, and avoiding Yes or No answers.
@AOC @ETApresident @RepRaskin Raskin owned Whitaker. This was definitely one of the best moments of the hearing, along with Pramila Jayapal's moving and emotional comments about child separation, and Sheila Jackson Lee teaching him a lesson about Congressional decorum. He needed it.
@adamdavidson Isn't saying you "barely knew" like being a little pregnant?
@joncoopertweets She does not remember sitting in Putin's chair. Whitaker can't remember how he found out he had been offered THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT position in the United States. Is amnesia contagious because it seems to be spreading in the White House?
@NatashaBertrand Interesting how he couldn't explain to the Committee how as an ex toilet salesman he was able to land the job of Attorney General. He also could not remember when or how he found out he got the job. Obviously hiding something.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans tried to skewer @HillaryClinton for 11 hours straight on Benghazi. There have been ZERO hearings about 4 dead soldiers in Niger. So give me a break.
@realDonaldTrump We have a great economy BECAUSE of Obama. If you knew anything about economics you would understand that. He brought us out of the great depression and set us on the right track. You are taking us down the wrong track, tax cuts for corporations and top 1%, trade wars, no plan.
@realDonaldTrump You have only yourself to blame for hiring COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT people as was made abundantly clear yesterday during Whitaker's hearing yesterday. You are the one who handpicked Matt Whitaker according to Matt Whitaker. You either called him or tweeted him to let him know.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Is this what you do during Executive Time?
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Okay, we get that you're in love with Sean Hannity. Enough with the retweets.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump What job is Sean Hannity angling for? Chief of Staff?
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump No Collusion?	1) Trump Tower meeting with Russia	2) Trump Tower IN Russia	3) Trump one-on-one meetings with Putin	4) Trump money laundering for Russia in Trump Tower one floor below Trump	5) Trump - Stone Wikileaks and Gucifer2 communications	6) Manafort paid by Kilimnik
@realDonaldTrump You DON"T know him. He is a con artist, just like you. He flatters you with praise and that's all you need to fall in love. He wants to nuke the U.S. He has the weapons to do it. Take your job of protecting the U.S. seriously and stop playing infantile games with this murderer.
@realDonaldTrump It would be refreshing to hear you talk about one of our Democratic allies like this, rather than a totalitarian states that wants to nuke the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump And for God's sake, please stop talking about how you both fell in love. He is a murderous dictator. Does that mean anything to you?
@realDonaldTrump You do realize he has murdered HIS OWN RELATIVES to stay in power, imprisons half the population of his country, and is building more nuclear weapons to be used exclusively AGAINST THE UNITED STATES? Don't be a stooge for this murderous dictator.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans launched scores of probes into Benghazi, Planned Parenthood, Internal Revenue Service targeting, Operation Fast and Furious, Hillary Clinton’s emails, Solyndra, Obamacare and more, with two select committees, hundreds of subpoenas and hearings in final days of power.
Words of praise for a dictator who kills his own relatives, imprisons his own people, and is building nuclear weapons to threaten the U.S.  On the flip side, Trump scorns democratically elected Congress, the rule of law, and the free press.	https://t.co/oSn2jMoC5R
To hear Whitaker tell it, noone, I repeat noone, talked to him about becoming Acting Attorney General of the United States of America. He found out about it either by Tweet or a call from the President, he can't remember which.  Seriously? Does he think we were born yesterday?
Whitaker can't remember exactly how he found out he was being offered the position of the TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL in the country. It may have been by Tweet. It may have been a phone call. Why would you remember something like that anyway? Obviously hiding something.
Everyone should watch this. It shows the depth of depravity of the people running the Department of Justice.  Matt Whitaker was a witting and willing fool who went along with a child separation policy because he does not care about the law, or morality, or ethics - he ignores all https://t.co/ZVXTdDUpxP
My takeaway from the Whitaker hearing so far - 	Republicans are suddenly big fans of the FBI and DOJ. That's all they want to talk about rather than the Mueller investigation and whether he interfered with it or not. Hypocrites! They've been trashing the FBI and DOJ relentlessly.
So many comments about Matt Whitaker saying “Mr Chairman I see your five minutes are up.” Reminder - Whitaker does not control the Committee clock.		Stay focused on the big picture. His statement was childish and irrelevant. Hold your fire for the big statements that are coming.
@JRubinBlogger @SethAbramson Sorry, I meant Kavanaugh. Watching the Whitaker hearing 🙂.
@JRubinBlogger @SethAbramson I hate to say it but Susan Collins is either very gullible and naive or extremely stupid. To believe a guy like Whitaker, with something he promised in private? She seems to crave the attention and delays her decisions until the last possible minute to garner maximum press.
Perhaps, but it's farcical because a witness can't dictate the terms to the committee. Only the chairman can control the 5 minute rounds. https://t.co/ho8W39adpF
@CyrusToulabi @DanaScottLO One might generously conclude that he was trying to be funny, but in the workplace there's a term for that and it's 'lack of emotional intelligence.' He lacks the ability to see and understand the gravity of the situation he is in.  He obviously feels overly confident.
Whitaker said he has not talked to the President or anyone in the White House about the Mueller investigation, and furthermore that he had not made any formal decisions regarding the Special Investigation. Hope he's telling the truth because there are plenty of people who know.
@SocialPowerOne1 Fox News is a real, serious threat to intelligent life everywhere.
@joncoopertweets I saw that comment from Whitaker, and giving him the benefit of the doubt, even though he might have been saying it tongue in cheek, it demonstrates a complete lack of awareness of the situation he is in. i.e. this was not the time to make a joke. In over his head.
@mmpadellan Looking at what someone did 35 years ago is much like getting a glimpse of the true character of the person. What they did when noone was watching, when they weren't thinking about a political career, when they felt truly free to express themselves. Yes, Mr. Walsh they should be.
"Both Wages and McCarthy said they have never discussed Vortex’s work with each other."		But of course. Why would McCarthy ever talk to his brother in law about his business? Especially if it's largely dependent on Government contracts? 		Who believes this shit? https://t.co/TwlgI9ZCTV

@RVAwonk It's like the Fox guarding the hen house.
Matthew Whitaker Says He Won’t Testify Until Subpoena Threat Is Removed by House Panel 		No, it is not political theater as Whitaker suggests. Rather, Democrats are fed up with witnesses who won't answer questions under the guise of Executive Privilege.	https://t.co/5DSthoEpvX

@SaysHummingbird @MLCzone I am against bullying and was bullied myself as a child. But I don't agree with re-posting a child's photo all over the internet. We should leave this poor kid alone. Trump used him for political purposes, the rest of us should avoid doing so.

@realDonaldTrump You don't really care about the safety of Americans. If you did you would be doing more to stop mass shootings in the U.S. like the ones that just happened in Baton Rouge and Sebring, FL.  Instead you come up with stupid little chants like "Build the wall crime will fall."
Notice how Trump says nothing about the mass shootings in Baton Rouge and Sebring, FL? Because they were white, male, American citizens. If they were undocumented his head would explode. Instead we get silence.
@realDonaldTrump BUILD A WALL CRIME WILL NOT FALL, because most crime is committed by good old American citizens. How about saying something about the mass shootings in Baton Rouge and Sebring, FL? 10 people died at the hands of Americans. When's the last time we had a mass shooting by illegals?

@DLind @lininohio It would not surprise me if a) he made it up, b) he divulged classified information, c) he has lost all touch with reality and sees strange things in his head.
@JOYFULIMKaren @thenurse75 @chucktodd @GOPLeader @MeetThePress @GStephanopoulos @ABC Exactly. If you're bringing a known liar onto your show you should be prepared to challenge every single lie.
@TomthunkitsMind @LauraTalbott They should play this during his impeachment proceedings when he will claim he knows absolutely nothing about taxes, campaign finance, or the laws he has been circumventing his entire life.
@lauferlaw They really need to stiffen the penalty for lying to Congress and the FBI. The slap on the wrist sentences for Papadopolous and Van Der Zwan for lying to Mueller, as well as the President dangling a pardon to people like Stone are impeding justice.
@ewood02 @CorbinColtrane By a young, white male. If the killer were any other nationality it would have been huge news. If he were an immigrant the internet would have exploded.
Both Dershowitz and Turley have argued that Mueller's investigation thus far has produced little more than guilty pleas of lying rather than substantive evidence of collusion or a conspiracy to undermine the election.

@critter77812189 @_mastermom I can't stand listening to him and his lies any more.  Was he born a liar? Was he taught how to lie by his father?

@realDonaldTrump Our country will have a hard time restoring its credibility because of the way you have treated our allies and partners around the world the past 3 years. But all you can focus on is the media and your image. You are a low energy lyin' cryin' unfit President who should resign.
@realDonaldTrump You seem more threatened by the "migrant caravan" than the major hurricanes and wildfires that hit the United States last year. You truly don't understand what constitutes a disaster or imminent harm and are therefore unqualified and unfit to lead this country. You should resign.
@realDonaldTrump How many times have you watched this now? How do you find the time to run the country when you can't stop fawning over videos of yourself?
@realDonaldTrump Look whose talking Mr. Anne Coulter Rush Limbaugh President!! You are the laughingstock of the entire country and world. You have no credibility any more.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Donald, her name is Speaker Pelosi and she is second in line to assume the Presidency so why don't you show some respect. Also you should not publicly announce when and where she is traveling to overseas war zones you imbecile.  You are a traitor unfit to be President.
@realDonaldTrump Enjoy your silly little victory dance. The Mueller team probably took issue with the Buzzfeed story because it didn't specifically mention "Tapes" which Cohen undoubtedly has of your conversations. Your day is coming.
@bjdmama @donna2034 @PhilipMeowlowe @secularcitizen2 If true that's pretty disgusting. Have we truly lost our moral fiber as a nation?

@msimmons444 @thenurse75 Typical. I had hoped for a better response from the parents, but apparently they are as bigoted as the children they raised. The teachers, parents, chaperones should all be held accountable, since they were complicit in this disgraceful display of ignorance and hateful behavior.
We should repudiate racism and bigotry anywhere and everywhere it rears its ugly head as the Mayor of Covington Kentucky did. This is a well written piece. https://t.co/M0OeBHDh8f

Melania just flew to Mar o Lago on the very same style aircraft Pelosi and the Congressional delegation would have used to fly to Europe and Afghanistan AFTER Trump nixed the trip for Pelosi.  Child in the White House.

What do Trump's tax returns and his meetings with Putin have in common? They're both concealed from public view and scrutiny. I'm sure it's all quite harmless and much ado over nothing. Not.
Mitch McConnell and Trump are holding government workers hostage, just like McConnell held Merrick Garland hostage for nearly a year. He defied Presidential authority then, now he kowtows to it.  McConnell needs to go.
Mitch McConnell says reopening government is a "show vote".  I don't call a show vote, I call it DEMOCRACY!! Make McConnell bring a vote to the Senate. It WILL pass and Trump will need to veto it. Then we'll see if it can be overridden. That's the way Democracy works.

@realDonaldTrump All of your lyin' and cryin' isn't going to stop Robert Mueller.  What about you and your lover Stormy Daniels? Why don't you talk about her any more? Not only were you lyin' about that for over a year, you paid her off to keep quiet. You are a lyin' cryin' adulterer.
@realDonaldTrump No, your administration was and is in complete turmoil because you are a clueless President, totally disloyal to your own staff and this country without an ounce of common sense or intelligence. You are a Lyin' Cryin' Fake President.
@realDonaldTrump You are a lyin' Fake President.  You invite Russians into the White House and hand over national security information. Comey never handed the Russians national security information. He's telling the truth and you are lyin Cryin Fake President. You should be impeached.

It is time for Trump to stop perpetuating the myth that Democrats are to blame for the government shutdown. On Jan 3 the House of Representatives voted 239-193 to reopen the government. On Dec 19 the Republican controlled Senate voted 100-0 to keep the government open.

We won the Cold War through our alliances, through perseverance, and by countering every threat made by Russia. It feels like our resolve has weakened and we are slowly reverting back to a Cold War driven by Russia to subvert Western democracy. Trump is enabling that effort.

@brianklaas Let's face it, Trump is clearly in Putin's pocket. It's not just Tillerson he was frightened by for being tough(er) on Russia, it was Comey, McCabe, Mueller, anyone who dares to look into Russian meddling in our election is in Trump's crosshairs. It's so plainly obvious.

Meanwhile, the top story on Fox News is about Peter Strzok not following up on a possible breach of Hillary's email server.
Yes, and yes. https://t.co/GbR9w34kuF
Astonishing. "The memo said that the Kremlin, through unspecified channels, had asked Trump to appoint someone who would be prepared to lift Ukraine-related sanctions, and who would coöperate on security issues of interest to Russia, such as the conflict in Syria." Not Romney. https://t.co/nm7vEUv7Md

The bottom line is Trump has gotten away with immoral, unethical, and unlawful behavior his entire life. It's in his DNA. It worked well for him so he continued to use it in the White House, not realizing he had entered an entirely different realm. A realm where the law matters.

There is so much to grapple with these days that we forget the truly important things. Like the fact that Kushner failed to report a $300 million dollar loan from Deutsche Bank that he received in December of 2016. Who doesn't remember receiving a $300 million loan? Mind-boggling

Noone is bothering to ask why Kushner can't get a top secret secuirty clearance. He's obviously compromised due to his large debt ($1.2 Billion due on 666 5th Ave at end of year) but there could be much more. Anybody else thinking Cambridge Analytica?

@_A__Dub So here's what will happen. She will likely and rightfully, based on what I've read in this story, win the whistle blower/retaliation complaint. However she will then be paid/compensated directly out of the HUD budget further undermining HUDs ability to do their important work.

This entire discussion about arming school teachers is ridiculous No one in their right mind go up against an AR-15 with a handgun. The only way to put down and AR-15 is with another AR-15. Someone should post a video from a firing range of what damage an AR-15 does vs a handgun.

@Easterngirl77 @wokeluisa My point was the NRA is in the business of shutting down debate. What we saw last night was an open discussion about gun violence and gun ownership. That is the LAST thing the NRA wants to debate. They rather just pay off politicians to keep them from even discussing the topic.

@brianklaas Ah, but you're forgetting something. If Trump thinks it's true, then it is. Just ask Kellyanne Conway. So this isn't about lying, it's him telling us about an alternative reality that we aren't aware of and he alone lives in.

Remember when CIA agent Valerie Plame was outed resulting in a huge scandal that very nearly took down the Bush administration? Now we have open disclosure of classified information by Congress with White House approval, and possible complicity. My how times have changed.
@Chrisvega25 @drix78 Can you explain why Carter Page, Naval Academy graduate, would say this in Moscow: “Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” What gives
@drix78 Yes, I know the difference. Rosie is a scumbag, Putin is an amazing person.
@maddow Question: Is Trump going to read the original version or the edited version? Answer: Neither. He doesn't read. He watches TV. And by TV I mean Fox News. Any wonder we're in trouble?

This is an unprecedented time in American history. From Nunes editing his memo after he realized FBI was right, to Trump saying he would 100% release memo without even reading it because White House assisted w/drafting memo to begin with (can anyone say obstruction of justice?) https://t.co/PGahuPrEqu
Wait, I thought they were our friends. Didn't Trump just host the head of FSB, GRU, and SVR in a secret meeting? And didn't Trump just not impose sanctions? I'm confused. Perhaps Trump can explain to me. https://t.co/QWdib95rCh

Heading toward a crisis. When the Nunes memo is released the FBI will have no choice but to release its own classified information to refute the memo. This will require Trump's approval.

@SenSanders Unfortunately given what I know about this President I'm not surprised he didn't mention climate change. He just got through spewing complete and utter nonsense about the polar ice caps reaching record levels. He has no credibility. But I hear what you're saying Bernie. I agree.
@GSarafan Finished installing my bamboo floor. Seriously, never thought twice about it. Why would I?
@CillizzaCNN Uh Yup.
This is disgraceful, dangerous double-speak for purging the FBI and DOJ based on party affiliation, which sounds a lot like Russia.

@HarleyRouda @RepRohrabacher LOL. Did Trump invite Vladimir Putin, or Felix Sater, or Carter Page, Aras Agalarov, Igor Sechin, Sergey Kislyak, or Sergey Lavrov? They are his true supporters. I'm sure they missed not being there to congratulate him. And to revel in the after-SOTU party and dream of 2018.
I agree Tom. I avoided watching the SOTU because Trump is a fraud, a con man, an immoral person with no sense of ethics or common decency or respect for the rule of law, and above all his deep disdain for immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans, or people of color who built this country. https://t.co/0evccMKNZq

Very perceptive Chris. I avoided the SOTU for the first time in decades, in large part because I believe Trump is a fraud, a con man, and deep down inside a man who is willing to compromise morality, ethics, and the law in order to achieve his goals which are fame and wealth. https://t.co/BUJ5LgD20e

It's a pretty low bar when reading a teleprompter is considered acting presidential. He is anything but presidential. Press should not be hornswoggled into fawning over him just because he manages to read for 45 minutes. Courage.  https://t.co/5QTI2vXqI0

@LauraBarton2018 @2HawkEye2018 I've wondered that myself. Part of me says yes because he hates government. Part of me says no because he wants to be seen as a successful President in order to promote his brand, and make more money. So he'll string government along to serve his selfish purposes.
He's still hoping to build that tower in Moscow. Can't do that without Putin's approval. https://t.co/m8ItQDkcJE
Thank you Brian! I agree that the press has a tendency to go WAY overboard in praising him when he's not being himself, as in reading words from a teleprompter. He seems like a zombie when reading teleprompter a) because he has difficulty reading and b) because it's just not him. https://t.co/xaJtFJUuWC

So as a former Federal employee and supervisor, I would never even consider asking an employee who they voted for. This demonstrates how completely clueless Trump is. He would not qualify for an entry level position in government.
I meant to say extremists, but with at least one Republican member who was an exterminator I suppose it's appropo.
Ever notice how Trump never ever acknowledges or thanks Federal employees for their service? Even after the shutdown when it would have been so easy and appropriate to thank them, he failed to do so. I don't think he has a clue what Federal employees do.
79 percent of public supports Trump testifying under oath to Mueller.	87 percent support reauthorizing DACA.		Unfortunately this means nothing to Republican extermists in Congress who only care about the 10 percent.

Trump will go down in history; just not for the reasons he thinks.	3,500 lawsuits.	1,950 lies in first year of office.	19 women accused him of sexual assault.	1 woman paid to keep silent about affair.	First President to be impeached during second year in office.

Mr. "I'll take responsibility" Trump is now blaming Democrats for a possible shutdown. He should blame himself for being the most erratic, unpredictable president in modern history who doesn't know how to lead much less govern. @Trumpshutdown
Trump doesn't have a clue what a government shutdown would mean. He has spent his entire life in a privileged bubble doing nothing more than feuding with the press and filing bankruptcies. I hate to say it but this might be a good lesson for him, but not America.

Democrats need to get on the same page. Republicans are always in lockstep, whereas Democrats can't seem to agree on anything. Here are your talking point Dems: We don't support DACA if it includes the wall, bans chain migration, or the Visa lottery program. Period.
It tells you something about the Republican party when telling the truth as Bannon did in Fire and Fury gets you ousted from the party. Morally bankrupt.
@realDonaldTrump If there was no collusion then why don't you tell the Repubs to back off Fusion GPS &amp; Steele and finish up the Russia investigation? You'd think you'd want your name cleared. Instead you make it seem like you're hiding something. All the denials mean nothing. Show some substance.
@realDonaldTrump If there was no collusion they why do you keep trying to interfere with the Russia investigation? Why did you fire Sally Yates after she told you about lyin Flynn? Why did you ask Comey for his loyalty then fire him when he didn't promise it? You obviously have something to hide.
@realDonaldTrump If there was no collusion then why did you laugh it up with Lavrov and Kislyak in the Oval Office no less, the day after you fired Comey?
@realDonaldTrump If there was no collusion then why did only DNC emails get released to WikiLeaks and not RNC emails? Answer - because they wanted you to get elected and now want favors in return. You know they've got dirt on you.
@realDonaldTrump If there was no collusion then why did you concoct an illegal, fake, cover story, on Air Force One no less, for why your son, son-in-law, and campaign manager met with the Russians after they promised to provide dirt on Hillary? Hope you get your answer straight for Mueller.
What Feinstein did was perfectly legal, unlike what you @DonaldTrump did aboard Air Force One by concocting a fake story about why Donald Jr. Manafort, and Kushner met with the Russians. Can't wait for Mueller to get you under oath. https://t.co/myBMyliQQa
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC has it not occurred to you that Steele was the only person to approach the FBI to warn them about Trump Russia connections? Noone on the Trump campaign not Manafort, Donald Jr. Jared Kushner who all met with Russians did. But you want to prosecute Steele?
Most thin-skinned President in history about to undermine the First Amendment.  https://t.co/0ZExPhXEBY
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and Senator @ChuckGrassley - why so interested in Fusion GPS and the Steele dossier all of a sudden? Shouldn't you be keeping your eye on the ball regarding Russian interference in the election? Got something to hide, or just covering for Trump?

By focusing on Steele, Grassley and Graham are making it abundantly clear that this is politically driven and does not aim to shed any real light on Russian influence on our election. They are in essence going down an irrelevant rabbit hole. https://t.co/KF1ZZHms2O
The Steele dossier wasn't even released until January 2017 well after Trump won the election which means that it had zero impact on the election. The committee that Grassley and Graham are running is supposed to be investigating Russian influence on the American election.
So what is all the fuss about the Christopher Steele dossier really about? It's a politically driven, diversionary tactic to muddy the waters and confuse the American public, detract from any actual investigation into Russian interference in our election. https://t.co/wkrXumYxOo
Here's something to think about: What is going through Mueller's mind knowing that he has indictable offenses against Trump, Pence, and Sessions? This is truly unprecedented territory. He must be thinking very carefully about the ramifications of releasing this material.
