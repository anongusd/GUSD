It is clear that there is no national emergency‚Äîonly a manufactured crisis.		A majority of this House, the American people, &amp; I are utterly opposed to this gimmick.		Putting our military families &amp; our troops in this situation is shameful &amp; @POTUS should be ashamed of himself.
The President‚Äôs plan is not to make us safer &amp; there will be real consequences for military readiness.		Diverting appropriated funds that were provided to specific construction projects will affect military training, readiness, &amp; quality of life for troops and their families.
In response to losing, the President has chosen to use an emergency construction authority ‚Äî attempting to misuse the flexibility provided by Congress to fund construction projects that directly support the use of our armed forces in an emergency or a declared war.
The President shut down the government over funding for this wall. 		Then Congress reopened the government, and then negotiated the border wall issue, which was rejected by a bipartisan, bicameral Committee who chose not to include the $5.7 billion for this boondoggle.
@POTUS has decided to take $3.6 billion from military construction projects that the military asked for, said they needed and that support the military and their families, to build his wall without Congressional approval, projects which he says ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt sound too important to me.‚Äù

The President says a wall will keep America safe, but stealing funds from military families makes us all less safe.		Bypassing Congress and the Constitution and starving military families is not patriotism, it's everything that true patriots fight against.
This is a power grab. 		After failing to get his way through Congress, the President is throwing an unconstitutional temper tantrum, jeopardizing military readiness to steal himself a wall that he could not get the lawful way.
What will these leaders ask their troops to give up, just so that the President can have his useless, wasteful border wall?		Training or intelligence facilities? 		Schools for our military families' children?

ICYMI: Today, @AppropsDems members of the Conference Committee on Homeland Security Appropriations announced proposals for smart &amp; effective border security measures that uphold American values ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/vQoSf00Acp https://t.co/EXhHCVZ97h
Chairwoman @NitaLowey, Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairwoman @RepRoybalAllard &amp; @AppropsDems have unveiled proposals for smart &amp; effective border security measures that uphold American values. 		Read the full list ‚Üí https://t.co/vQoSf00Acp https://t.co/339gSbvQKx
.@AppropsDems support smart investments in ports of entry, humanitarian assistance, technology improvements, &amp; personnel to comprehensively strengthen border security. 		Because border security is more than physical security, &amp; homeland security is more than border security.
Homeland Security Chairwoman &amp; @AppropsDems conference committee member @RepRoybalAllard: There's been a lot of inaccurate rhetoric about a security crisis at the border that supposedly can only be solved by a multi-billion dollar border wall.
I hope that all stakeholders, including @POTUS, will work in good faith to support us as we carry out our responsibilities.		Together, we can secure our border and uphold our values.		Read @NitaLowey's full statement: https://t.co/qQprBAPcV2
I know that the American people are counting on us to come to a reasonable and responsible solution.		Consistent with the proud tradition of our committees, I am confident that we will be able to reach a compromise.
It is also important to recognize that the @DHSgov bill includes other key pieces of our nation‚Äôs security platform, including the @USCG, @TSA, and @FEMA.		Every dollar spent on ineffective proposals means one less dollar invested in measures that actually keep us safe.
Smart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, which the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate are cost effective compared to better technology and more personnel.
My Democratic colleagues and I are ready to work in good faith to write a Department of Homeland Security bill that funds smart, effective border security.
In the next 16 days, our task is clear: finalizing appropriations legislation that responsibly funds much of the federal government ‚Äì everything from our National Parks to border security.
We can all agree that we must do everything we can to prevent another unnecessary and destructive government shutdown.

Chair of @HomelandDems @BennieGThompson: In 2018, Americans faced catastrophic hurricanes, wildfires, &amp; volcanoes. Last week, @POTUS responded by saying he plans to stop aid to wildfire survivors. This bill shows the American people we stand with them, even if @POTUS does not.
Incoming Chairwoman of @AppropsDems Homeland Security @RepRoybalAllard: It's critical that Congress ensures every federal resource is made available to the state, local governments &amp; all affected communities from unprecedented 2018 wildfires. This shouldn't be a partisan issue.

Outside of the IRS, small businesses, which make up the backbone of our economy, also take a hit, with no access to @SBAgov loans during the shutdown. Those businesses will remain unable to make capital improvements, and entrepreneurs can‚Äôt even attend workshops to seek advice.
Taxpayers rely on the IRS to assist them in making big choices for their financial planning. That advice helps families make important decisions, like whether to put money into their savings or buy that new appliance to replace a broken one.

.@NitaLowey: Republicans have included harmful policy riders aimed at gutting environmental &amp; conservation efforts. This bill attacks clean water &amp; air regulations, removing Gray Wolves from the endangered species list, and withdrawing the Waters of the United States rule,
.@NitaLowey: This bill cuts the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds by $150 million each. And it cuts the EPA by $100 million, restricting the agency‚Äôs ability to protect the air we breathe &amp; water we drink.
.@BettyMcCollum04: The 14 poison pill riders in this pill undermine clean air &amp; clean water standards and endanger the health &amp; safety of American families.

.@RepMikeQuigley: The partisan riders in the bill, which weaken campaign finance laws and interfere in the District of Columbia‚Äôs local affairs, make it impossible for Democrats to support it.
.@RepMikeQuigley: After making a $380 million down payment on election security in the omnibus, this bill provides zero funding for that purpose this year. It falls far short in protecting our elections from interference &amp; hacking.

The Committee approved the Republican spending levels on a 29-22 vote. All @AppropsDems voted against the allocations, which shortchange critical priorities for American families.
.@RepTimRyan explains that these partisan spending levels represent the Republican Congress turning its back on struggling people &amp; families across the United States.
.@RepTimRyan opposes the Republican spending levels. Inadequate funding will weaken our economy and make life harder for middle class families and people struggling to get into the middle class.
.@RepMarcyKaptur opposes the Republican spending levels. Notes that inadequate funding threatens the response to the opioid epidemic that is ravaging states like Ohio.
.@RepJoseSerrano opposes the Republican spending levels. Describes how the allocations reveal the GOP's misplaced priorities - favoring @POTUS' border wall over America's students.
.@RepDavidEPrice opposes the Republican spending levels. Expresses dismay at Republicans' decision to abandon a bipartisan, collaborative process in favor of divisive partisanship.
.@BettyMcCollum04 opposes the Republican spending levels. Condemns the GOP's broken, secretive process and the squeeze that the allocations will impose on environmental protection.

.@rosadelauro speaks in strong opposition to the misplaced Republican priorities. Explains the serious impacts of shortchanging the services provided under the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill.
.@RepDWStweets opposes the misplaced Republican priorities. Notes that the partisan spending levels undermine the Bipartisan Budget Act &amp; the recently-passed omnibus.
.@NitaLowey: Moreover, @HouseGOP‚Äôs partisan approach is in contrast to the Senate, where the entire appropriations process is being handled in a bipartisan manner. This makes the timely completion of our important work more difficult.
.@NitaLowey: The bottom line is simple. Republicans would rather build @POTUS‚Äô border wall and continue the attacks on immigrant communities than help our children, families &amp; seniors.
.@NitaLowey: Worse still, Republicans are inadequately funding Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. This will starve our schools, hurt job training &amp; workplace rights protection, jeopardize Pell Grants, and limit access to affordable health care.
.@NitaLowey: The Republican proposal betrays our American values and wastes precious taxpayer dollars. It has already led to cuts to programs like the COPS Hiring Program and clean energy through ARPA-E.
.@NitaLowey: Congress agreed to an $18 billion dollar increase in non-defense discretionary spending to fund investments that create jobs, grow the economy &amp; help hardworking families get ahead. But Republicans are instead funding @POTUS‚Äô border wall &amp; deportation force.

@RepBarbaraLee @RepDavidEPrice @POTUS .@rosadelauro notes the shortage of affordable housing throughout the United States, praises the HOME program and endorses the Lee amendment.
@RepBarbaraLee .@RepDavidEPrice supports the Lee amendment. Notes that while Republicans have rejected @POTUS; proposed elimination of HOME, additional funding for the program will help expand the supply of safe &amp; decent housing.
.@RepBarbaraLee offers an amendment to increase funding for the HOME Investment Partnership, which provides key gap funding for affordable housing developments across the United States.
@RepPeteAguilar @RepDavidEPrice The Committee rejected, on a 22-29 vote, @RepPeteAguilar's amendment to reinstate the cap on political appointees at the Department of Transportation. All @AppropsDems voted for the amendment.
@RepPeteAguilar .@RepDavidEPrice supports the amendment and notes that the cap on political appointees was in place under every President from Reagan to Obama. Why does this administration need more political appointees?
.@RepPeteAguilar offers an amendment to reinstate the cap on political appointees at the Department of Transportation. Notes that this is a good government amendment that safeguards taxpayer dollars.

@RepDavidEPrice @NitaLowey @RepDWStweets .@rosadelauro supports Price amendment. Cites research demonstrating the high number of crashes caused by both heavier trucks and more exhausted drivers.
@RepDavidEPrice @NitaLowey .@RepDWStweets speaks in favor of Price amendment. Discusses the danger of weakening highway safety laws and allowing more fatigued truck drivers on the roads.
@RepDavidEPrice .@NitaLowey supports the Price amendment to remove partisan riders. Notes that these poison pills are non-starters for Democrats and make it harder for Congress to complete its work on time.
.@RepDavidEPrice offers an amendment to strike partisan policy provisions from the bill. These Republican riders weaken fair housing laws &amp; highway safety standards.
.@NitaLowey: Partisan provisions to increase truck weights and preempt state &amp; local meal &amp; rest break laws make our roads less safe. Efforts to cripple high speed rail in California would result in job losses and block critical infrastructure that is so desperately needed.
.@NitaLowey: We must do more to help Americans struggling to make ends meet and put a roof over their heads, not waste taxpayer dollars on @POTUS‚Äô boondoggle of a wall or letting @SecElaineChao hire more political cronies.
.@NitaLowey: While it contains some good provisions, Democrats cannot support the Transportation-HUD bill. It is particularly outrageous that Republicans are giving Americans a raw deal by slashing HOME by $162 million.
.@RepDavidEPrice: Our bill exists alongside 11 others, and we must consider our allocation in the context of damage done elsewhere to public health, environmental protection, education, job training, and diplomatic &amp; global aid programs that strengthen our national security.
.@RepDavidEPrice: I‚Äôm strongly opposed to several controversial policy riders that were attached to this bill that attack high speed rail, harm labor rights, and roll back transportation safety.
.@RepDavidEPrice: We need to push the housing numbers higher, particularly in the context of large funding increases in the transportation title of this bill that were added very late in the drafting process.
.@RepDavidEPrice: The Transportation-HUD bill contains robust funding for transit and rail programs that @POTUS sought to eliminate. On the housing side of the ledger, the funding is less robust but locks in gains from the last omnibus.

The Committee rejected, on a voice vote, the Serrano amendment to prevent a citizenship question on the 2020 #Census.
.@NitaLowey supports Serrano amendment, explains the critical role a fair &amp; accurate #Census plays in apportioning federal funding to communities across the country.
.@RepGraceMeng notes the rushed process that the Trump administration  used to force a citizenship question on the #Census. In hearing, @uscensusbureau confirmed question would depress response rates.

.@rosadelauro, co-sponsor of @Call_Me_Dutch‚Äôs amendment, notes the long history of ZTE undermining American interests and threatening our country‚Äôs security.
.@NitaLowey supports the amendment, noting that it‚Äôs wrong for @POTUS to overturn the sanctions against ZTE to help a Chinese company that doesn‚Äôt have America‚Äôs best interests at heart.
This amendment stems from @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs recent tweet that indicated he would overturn these sanctions against ZTE because of his concern over job losses in China. https://t.co/f3W2hfQTWK

The Committee rejected, on a voice vote, the Wasserman Schultz amendment to preserve reporting of multiple long gun purchases along the U.S.-Mexico border.
.@NitaLowey supports Wasserman Schultz amendment. Discusses how the reporting requirement is working to reduce crime and does not infringe on the 2nd Amendment.
.@RepJoseSerrano notes the reporting requirement in question has led to the prosecution of more than 1,000 people trafficking firearms. It is dangerous for Republicans to undo this gun safety rule.
.@RepDWStweets offers an amendment to strike a Republican rider that prevents law enforcement from tracking the sale of multiple long guns to the same person, which is critical to combatting drug cartels along the U.S.-Mexico border.

.@NitaLowey supports the Serrano amendment, notes that quotas for immigration judges will violate immigrants‚Äô civil rights and undermine America‚Äôs justice system.
.@RepJoseSerrano offers an amendment to prohibit quotas from being applied to immigration judges. Quotas would force judges to rush through cases, depriving individuals of their right to due process.
The Committee rejected, on a voice vote, the Roybal-Allard amendment to protect asylum seekers.
.@NitaLowey reiterates that criminal prosecution of asylum seekers and separation of families runs counter to our American values. Urges adoption of @RepRoybalAllard‚Äôs amendment.
.@RepJoseSerrano supports the amendment, notes that it will prevent families from being separated while asylum claims are being adjudicated.

According to the nonpartisan GAO, individuals on terrorist watch lists were involved in firearm-related background checks 244 times in 2015 and were able to buy guns 223 times. That puts families &amp; communities at risk.
.@RepDavidEPrice, co-sponsor of the amendment, notes that there is already a list of categories that cause people to be prohibited from buying guns. Adding suspected terrorists to that list is common sense. #PreventGunViolence
.@RepJoseSerrano supports the amendment, noting that preventing suspected terrorists from easily accessing guns should be a bipartisan effort.
.@NitaLowey notes that her amendment provides an appeals process both administratively and through the federal courts.  If necessary, individuals can even sue in federal court to recover their attorneys‚Äô fees.
.@NitaLowey offers an amendment to close the terror gap and ensure that suspected terrorists cannot buy guns. If someone isn‚Äôt allowed to board a plane due to suspicion of terrorism, he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to buy guns to carry out an attack. #PreventGunViolence

.@NitaLowey: While the bill includes increases for the Army Corps of Engineers &amp; some Department of Energy programs, Republicans have gone out of their way to cut Democratic priorities and add poison pill riders.
.@NitaLowey: Failing to have 302(b)‚Äôs, allowing leadership to dictate a rescissions package, and not even having a plan for individual debate of these bills on the floor erodes any illusion of regular order. Republicans can and must do better.

.@NitaLowey: The list of positives in this bill is far outweighed by the negatives. Republican riders gut environmental &amp; conservation efforts, remove gray wolves from the endangered species list &amp; end the Waters of the United States rule. These are non-starters for Democrats.
.@BettyMcCollum04: I must also object to the many policy riders included in this bill. They would undermine clean air &amp; clean water standards, put the health and safety of American families at risk, and roll back protections for endangered species.
.@BettyMcCollum04: The bill fails to address, or even acknowledge, the deficiencies of EPA leadership. Frankly, I am furious that @EPAScottPruitt still has a place in @POTUS‚Äô cabinet. The EPA desperately needs Congressional oversight.
.@BettyMcCollum04: Unfortunately, Republicans are once again proposing to slash the EPA. A $100 million cut undermines the EPA‚Äôs ability to keep our families &amp; communities healthy, and to protect our environment for future generations.

@HouseGOP @POTUS The Trump-GOP bill also includes significant cuts to programs that create good-paying jobs, grow our economy, and improve the quality of life in our rural communities. These cuts are unacceptable.
Tonight @HouseGOP introduced @POTUS' rescissions package, which pays for the GOP tax bill by cutting the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program without reinvesting in vital health care &amp; human service programs like Head Start or biomedical research.
.@NitaLowey: Controversial riders in CJS bill, including those that prevent law enforcement from sensibly addressing gun crimes at the border, stand in the way of a bipartisan product. Poison pill riders should not be included in the bill.

Congress must reject this reckless proposal, which undoes years of bipartisan work. Instead of dragging our country backwards, @HouseDemocrats are offering working families #ABetterDeal.		Read @NitaLowey's full statement on the rescissions package ‚Üí https://t.co/1MvycmTpbI
Likewise, slashing investments in rural infrastructure, medical innovation, and community development robs the American people of opportunities for better jobs and better futures.
The Trump-Mulvaney rescissions package is a raw deal for the American people. Cutting children‚Äôs health insurance without reinvesting in other vital health care programs will cause serious pain for American families.
.@RepBarbaraLee notes that families would be personally bankrupt if they spent money without having a complete picture of their finances. Objects to lack of 302(b) allocations.
.@rosadelauro objects to the lack of 302(b) allocations. It‚Äôs irresponsible to mark up individual appropriations bills without a complete picture of spending levels.
.@NitaLowey: The Legislative Branch bill includes critical investments, but I wish it invested more in Congress as an institution. Failing to do so strains the House‚Äôs ability to serve the American people.
.@RepTimRyan: This bill is strong, but it should be part of a coherent budget strategy. @HouseGOP‚Äôs approach isn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs supposed to work ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs dysfunctional.
.@RepTimRyan: The bill also provides $578.9 million for the @USGAO, bringing the federal government‚Äôs premier auditor back up to the staffing level needed to root out waste, fraud &amp; abuse.
.@RepTimRyan: The Legislative Branch bill provides resources to the Office of Compliance and the House Chief Administrative Officer to help address and prevent sexual harassment.
.@RepTimRyan: This bill looks after the security needs of Members, staff &amp; visitors both here in Washington and at our district offices at home.
HAPPENING NOW: @RepTimRyan leads @AppropsDems at full committee markup of fiscal year 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill. 		Watch live here ‚Üí https://t.co/x9qVfRc8kI
.@RepRoybalAllard: American taxpayers should not foot the bill for @POTUS‚Äô proposed border wall. Supports @RepDWStweets amendment to ensure no funds in MilCon-VA bill be spent on border wall.
.@RepCuellar: A wall on the U.S.-Mexico is a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem. Supports @RepDWStweets amendment to ensure no funds in MilCon-VA bill be spent on border wall.
.@RepDWStweets offers amendment to ensure that no funds in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill can be used to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
.@NitaLowey: Spending $69 million on a new prison at Guantanamo Bay is a prime example of misplaced priorities. Supports the @RepDWStweets amendment.
.@RepDWStweets offers amendment to strike $69 million in funding for new detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station and instead allocate that money to provide enhanced security for servicemembers at American military installations.
.@RepMarcyKaptur objects to the lack of complete 302(b) allocations, notes that the Majority‚Äôs approach deprives Committee members of important information.
.@SanfordBishop: Continuing to mark up appropriations bills without 302(b) allocations is careless. We need to return to regular order.
.@NitaLowey: I urge the Chairman to raise this serious concern with Republican leadership and work with Democrats to return to how things should be done.
.@NitaLowey: While I appreciate the work on this bill, it was done without knowing how it will mesh with the other spending bills. We can‚Äôt be sure that we are truly doing all we can to help veterans and all Americans.
.@NitaLowey: The bill also includes the second installment of $2 billion for VA infrastructure improvement that was part of the bipartisan spending agreement reached in March.
.@NitaLowey: The bill includes many essential components, including $1.8 billion to address veteran homelessness and $511 million to support the health needs of women veterans.
.@NitaLowey: The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill recognizes the tremendous debt of gratitude we owe to those who have sacrificed for us in our Armed Forces, as well as their families who share in their service to our country.
.@NitaLowey: @HouseDemocrats are focused on investments to create jobs, grow the economy &amp; provide for our security. Unfortunately, Republicans are failing to govern responsibly and keeping us in the dark on a complete set of allocations. That isn‚Äôt regular order.
.@RepDWStweets: This is a huge waste of resources, especially when balanced against the needs of our own military servicemembers. It is irresponsible to build a Taj Mahal for terrorists at a cost of more than $1.7 million per detainee.
.@RepDWStweets: While I believe this bill does a lot of things we all support, I am particularly concerned about the $69 million allocated for a High-Value Detention Facility at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.
.@RepDWStweets: Overall, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill addresses many critical issues affecting our veterans and active &amp; reserve service members.
.@RepDWStweets: I am disappointed that we have yet to see 302(b) allocations for any other bills ‚Äî and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs 302(b) remains a partial estimate.
.@NitaLowey: The American people get a raw deal when budgetary decisions are made in the dark, with no budget and no transparency. It‚Äôs a shame Republicans won‚Äôt even allow a vote in subcommittee allocations.
.@NitaLowey: It‚Äôs unfortunate that we aren‚Äôt debating 302(b) allocations today. Instead of showing us how they will divide funds among subcommittees, Republicans are keeping Congress &amp; the American people in the dark.
.@NitaLowey: Thanks to the hard work of the Appropriations Committee, the two most significant bipartisan laws enacted this Congress were the 2017 &amp; 2018 omnibus appropriations acts. Both were good for the American people.

These investments made possible by Dems standing strong against insufficient and partisan Approps bills throughout this process, and securing $117B more in nondefense investments than @realDonaldTrump requested.
