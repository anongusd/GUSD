.@Jj_nyappdefense @_idaretodothis @AC360 no he was in for life without parole
.@Artie1942 @AC360 she is so lucky they didn't kill anyone or she'd be facing lot more than 7 years!
.@noraneus @AC360 make the most of it! stay up late and work super hard! #InternshipsAreTheBomb!
.@colettemarie24 there had been rumor of that but seems it was strangers in the end who called it in.
.@stephuhkneetea bingo!! Agreed on that one for sure! so much drama!!
@noraneus i lost count.. too tired to keep counting! ha!! ever since @newday this morning! yikes! #NewsNeverStops #PrisonBreakNY
RT @noraneus: Okay, final question, how many hours have you been awake now @randikayeCNN long day!!
.@colettemarie24 he sort of takes all the credit for being mastermind. fmr prisoners tell me that others will look up to him behind bars.
.@Jj_nyappdefense @_idaretodothis @AC360 they were put in special prison block 4 good behavior. had a fridge. real clothes. still did this!

.@SDonnelly_77 those who knew him say he was very smart. he was the guy who figured out route &amp; escape plan. He cut himself free first.
.@midniteshopper well that's great to hear.. so many layers to this crazy story! thanks for watching! #PrisonBreakNY #AC360
.@Artie1942 @AC360 but what if these guys had killed someone? that's what many had feared...
.@TroyH227aeros they actually had adjoining cells so could work together on cutting holes and choosing escape route.
.@MavisSchumacher too busy to miss it! ha!
.@87_cjohnson @AC360 wow! those are some strong feelings!

.@miki1432 no he didn't. he talked about everything but that. he tired of him tho. left him bc he was slow &amp; boozing. maybe he wasn't sad

.@IshEstradaCNN good thing i have an awesome producer like you to keep me going! #IshIsTheBoss!
.@Jj_nyappdefense @aholliwood @AC360  yup we talked to former prisoner who Sweat bossed. he liked him. called him 'good guy'

RT @IshEstradaCNN: Got questions for @randikayeCNN ? Tweet using #PrisonBreakNY - She's a Tweeting machine right now! and she's been up sin‚Ä¶
.@aholliwood @AC360 unclear what they were making she was the boss. she ran the place. taught them. sweat also bossed other prisoners.
.@SDonnelly_77 @CNN haven't seen the final numbers yet but it was pricey!!
.@human1time always! never leave home without it! and we were with #borderpatrol
.@passionthatpurs #AC360 at this point just the two charged.
supposedly #JoyceMitchell hubby still loves her &amp; supports her. cud you? #PrisonBreakNY #ac360 #cnn #manhunt
.@stephuhkneetea @AC360 sweat practiced 4 months in tunnels. got out night before but didn't like manhole so did it again next night.
.@bensmartnews thanks so much! love telling great stories.
.@bensmartnews yes. not all but does include #chinesefood #meaculpa crazy right?
.@midniteshopper he didn't realize what he was bringing in apparently. DA thinks she acted alone with the escapees.
.@passionthatpurs seems that way.Richard Matt would ask for something it seems after each sex act w/ her. screwdriver. drill bits. glasses.
.@stephuhkneetea @AC360 i don't know. possible they were both playing here and talked about it? seems like cons?
.@CdnGal2015 she was giving #RichardMatt tools and things as far back as April #PrisonBreakNY
.@mocchioni @CNN they were in adjoining cells in "honor block" in prison. got special treatment 4 good behavior. go figure! #PrisonBreakNY
.@Brooklynkidd215 she will be sentenced in september up to 7 years.
.@stephuhkneetea @AC360 she only admits to sex relations w/ #RichardMatt so unclear. tho she sent #DavidSweat naked pics of herself so??
.@fm310 most people would probably agree with that!
.@Brooklynkidd215 good question. Sweat was moved out of tailor shop 2013 but Matt was able to stay there &amp; she admits they were having sex
.@Heetckers @cnn She confessed and her attorney says she "got in too deep" and knows it.
.@CdnGal2015 they got blades from her in fronzen hamburger meat- delivered by prison guard she arranged. he's charged too.
.@stephuhkneetea she loved the fantasy and wanted a different life. but convicted killers????
do you think #JoyceMitchell was crazy to think it could've been "love" with #RichardMatt as she told authorities? Really?? #PrisonBreakNY
.@RageGrl absolutely.. so much money and resources!
.@__meg8 bingo!! but these were bad guys!!
.@AngelaCFisher  Why? #joyceMitchell told police she liked the fantasy and wanted a different life. her confession! #PrisonBreakNY
.@haileyblakern ha! yes- you figured that out on your own eh? love he called it a #weirdocrime
if you could ask #JoyceMitchell anything.. what would it be? #PrisonBreakNY #ac360 #cnn #Manhunt #GreatPrisonEscape
.@Jj_nyappdefense @_idaretodothis @AC360 all part of changes they are considering. do u think these guys deserved honor block as murderers?
.@LallyLoo7638 crazy right? these guys were murderers and they fridge &amp; time out of cell. wore civilian clothing too which helped them!
.@madcooldude @CNN just imagine if they'd killed someone else. that wud've been on her too.
.@IamTwank @AC360 she faces up to 7 yrs. she'll prob get about 3-4. law enforcement think she's only one behind it. no plan b for them.
.@NathanCramer3 those might've been stolen once they got out. authorities don't think they got guns from her.
what do you think of #JoyceMitchell plea deal today? Up to 7 years. Harsh enuf? #PrisonBreakNY Watch @cnn now!
.@NathanCramer3 @AC360 matt had asked for a sawed off shotgun. unclear if she delivered that since she never picked them up.

@RageGrl absolutely! stunning!
.@miki1432 @mikeeaves yes. her husband worked in prison too in tailor shop. he knew both escapees and they allegedly planned to kill him.
.@AngelaCFisher good question. they cut thru it and used a fan rigged from prison electrical system to cool off.
.@greggkaye  funny! don't think we r related.. joyce mitchell's hubby still lives there &amp; was in court today. he still loves &amp; supports her.
.@Potsy137 @CNN i know right-- so hard to believe.. it's like a movie! but truly can't make this stuff up
.@mikeeaves right now they are still trying to figure out how these guys got out and plug those holes. changes to come i'm sure!
.@_idaretodothis @AC360 it might. families cudn't even see loved ones in prison for a while due to lockdown. but best to be safe right?
.@noraneus  stressful &amp; difficult. the men were still on run when we were there. very scary 4 community. didn't know if holding ppl hostage
.@Jj_nyappdefense @ac360 they really needed her help to tell them how it all went down and how to fix the holes in the prison system.
.@guccisoglo @ac360 he's only allowed out of his cell for an hour a day. doubtful.
.@ijuan480 @AC360 good question. they cut a deal because she was cooperating and giving information about how to secure prison now.
