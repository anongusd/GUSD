@TheRickWilson Hastert rule is the one which got us in this shut down mess. 2013 immigration reform with big border security funding package (42 billion dollars) which passed in senate with 68 votes in a bi-partisan fashion died in house because hastert rule wont allow a vote on it.

@gsiskind but senate needs 60 votes to pass?
@gsiskind Yes with lot of amendments in senate dictated by WH, thats the big problem
@StephenSather @RonaldKlain @NancyPelosi She wont pass because she dont want trump to get credit for passing immigration reform. He already passed tax reform, farm bill and criminal justice reform, too many credits to give i guess
@RonaldKlain Pelosi wont do it.

Country Cap H1 and all hell will break loose. But if we lift Country CAP on EB green cards with no over all quota increase people think its controversial
