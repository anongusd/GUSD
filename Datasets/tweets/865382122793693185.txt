Partisanship- a political party that pays and funds politicians to believe in something radical and/or something they do not believe in and makes the person become corrupt.
If you‚Äôre really focused and think that our president is a Russian spy, you‚Äôre thirsty for power and just want an excuse to impeach the man. I get that he is crazy and his views are crazier and he doesn‚Äôt work with the opposing party a lot but he‚Äôs not a Russian spy.

If republicans did that it would be an outraged and the right would be critized. My point being each party can contradict each other. You have to admit this president has been the first one to complete all of his promises.
The whole ‚Äútemper tantrum‚Äù Schumer talks about, was the same tantrum Democrats through in 2013 when the affordable care act was the problem. Democrats shutdown the government AND called a informal session of congress, which is unethical.

There is no point in an impeachment if there is two years left of his term. There is a long process. Impeachment never worked for Clinton. At this point I would wait until 2020. But I‚Äôm ready for the next president.
So the impeachment is because of treason but there is no evidence of that. Another reason is the attack on the constitution when he is constantly protect it and yet again no evidence of the so called attack on the constitution. Democrats are desperate for power.
It‚Äôs great that we have a fantastic governor like Charlie Baker for another term. He is a man of his word and optimistic. He is a man who will go down as one of the best governors of Massachusetts.
Hope everyone had a Happy Year and everyone got back to where they were going safely!
We just give up instead of trying to make compromises and actually make America great. That‚Äôs what some politicians don‚Äôt understand.
On the other hand, this needs to end and she needs to find a way to figure something out that pleases both parties. Just because the government is shutdown, doesn‚Äôt mean she can just go on vacation. That‚Äôs the problem with this country. But like I said it shouldn‚Äôt matter.
It shouldn‚Äôt really matter what Nancy Pelosi does during the shutdown. While our leaders need to step up and work to reopen the government. However I see both sides to this. I understand the frustration and if POTUS had no interest in a compromise, why should she waste her time?
