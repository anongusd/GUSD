Trump fans elected a proxy president, propped up by Fox News and some of the worst minds of their respective generations. Do people think any of those lying fearmongers care if government workers get paid? Hannity &amp; Coulter will collect their birthday-clown checks no matter what.
Maybe @realDonaldTrump just wants to make sure he has the longest government shutdown, because all he understands are superlative words. Here’s another one: he’s the worst president. He’s a leader for no one, and this proves he couldn’t care less about his base either.

@dcherring My father, despite being kind of archaic and macho, despises Trump more than I do. It’s impressive.
@dcherring My mom’s an Independent now but for most of my life she was a registered R who never voted for one for pres in the last 30 years because she’s socially liberal in every way and couldn’t stomach the encroaching religious right. So, D for me.
@KayJay62 I think she’s just trying to help a candidate she believes in who has a chance to win. Lots of people from all over trying to lend support to their preferred candidates.
@KayJay62 Certainly nothing wrong with that.
@dcherring @brianstelter We’re in the third grade. I remember a girl saying all of our parents needed to vote for Bush because Dukakis was going to take all of her dad’s money. Luckily, we just had our reunion and I don’t think that affected her politics either ☺️
@dcherring @brianstelter Good job, Bush 41 campaign, you terrified an 8-year-old so much she remembered it forever (and yet it didn’t affect her politics...)
@brianstelter The folks who put out the Willie Horton ad only got one term too, so... 👌🏻

Here’s another one. Ok, for those in the cheap seats: Focusing on right now isn’t the same as denying what’s in the history books regarding Dems/Reps, the Civil War, FDR, Lyndon Johnson, southern Dems, etc. Welcome to 2018, assholes. https://t.co/d31cWh9xeR

@Walrussnor If you’re volunteering. I didn’t claim not to be a little partisan. It’s normal. I can’t help that you’re playing for a losing team. Even if it takes many more years, that arc of history is passing you by. Best of luck, I hope the light makes its way in somewhere.

@Walrussnor @DudeHazard “Real proof.” Like a video? A crowd of sober people watching? A Republican accusing a Democrat? A pal of yours making a claim? Don’t worry, plenty of people agree with you. Go bother them.
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard See, it’s not being ruined. That’s nonsense. The only thing that might happen to him is he doesn’t get on the Supreme Court. His testimony, unrelated to this, was already problematic. And he’ll probably get on the court. What’s acceptable proof to you? Show me your perfect victim
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard And that’s terrible, very sorry that that happens to anyone. But once again, that’s one person. You can’t go by what he did or said and how he handled it and apply it to everyone. That’s not rational.
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard Do you think she thought, “I know, the political climate and adoration for Trump—who’s been accused of sexual misconduct by many women and was elected anyway—makes this the PERFECT scenario for me to easily derail this nomination. Easy-peasy, should be a cinch.”
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard Read stories about men being abused. Do they all start with them telling their best friend everything? But that’s what women should automatically do? Listen to yourself! I’m not claiming to know what happened, but your scenario is sadly simplistic.
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard How do you know? What makes you the expert on such things. You know exactly what you would do? Or what a woman SHOULD do? That’s ridiculous.
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard I’m not declaring things one way or another, but the partisan treatment of her has been appalling. We’ve devolved since 1991.
@Walrussnor @DudeHazard What does she have to gain by lying? She was thinking, “gee, I haven’t had enough public ridicule lately, and I’ve gone through life with not nearly enough people calling me a liar...” Your timeline is simply by someone who wants to make sure she looks suspect. You bit.
@DudeHazard I saw something so horrible last night, in one thread. All women, many mothers, all Kavanaugh fans, all saying Ford is lying. Some survivors of assault, all of whom believed it was at least partly their fault &amp; all in agreement they should never “ruin a man’s life” over it.

@bittysparrow Just trying to stoop to where the “that woman I don’t know is lying ‘cause the man I don’t know said so” level is.
@bittysparrow Yes, because of that debacle you should instead assume a woman is lying until she’s met all the standards of proof acceptable to... you.
@bittysparrow You’re not even empathetic enough to think for a second, “as the father of daughters...” Good for you, stick to that plan, it’s a great one. And whatever it is you’re drinking, you forgot the “y.”
@ScottArmstead Well, ideally, obviously.
@bittysparrow Yes. And when was the last time the GOP did anything in good faith? Screw them and this ridiculous president. And what’s enough evidence for you? A video? Your garbage take is why women are reluctant to ever speak up.

@realIlduce @BarackObama Pure fear, spurred on by Trump, Fox News and its degenerate spawn, and, sadly, most of the GOP for the past 10 years
And when your last resort is "he needs a teleprompter," you're done. (And yes, he uses big words and complete sentences with wholly realized thoughts. Sometimes you need a little help. You're just sore that Trump sounds like he's on horse tranquilizers when he reads anything.)
I do understand why some people's minds are being particularly blown by this speech that they're not bothering to listen to, just hooting at. They haven't heard an American leader put words together and talk sense like this in awhile. They're still terrified that Obama is right.
Actually, it's quite alarming how stupid they are. Calling him a Communist, "Obama bin Laden," saying he's the traitor. That's not a difference of political opinion, you want lower taxes or a more robust foreign policy. That's ignorant, fact-ignoring cultism. And it's pathetic.
Watching @BarackObama speak today, and seeing the comments fly by, mostly positive but with the usual sprinkling of "he hates America," "I love Trump" &amp; some really racist shit mixed in... I'm reminded how many people simply refuse to try to listen, whose minds are walled off.
