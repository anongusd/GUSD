@SNYtv I agree with Rosario
@D_AbrianoSNY That made me nauseous
@CKleinNY @MBrownstein89 True. Whether he's "injury prone" or "unlucky" use it when negotiating to get his price down. That's why I think its a good gamble. Wasn't Cespedes pretty durable up until he became a Met? Goes both ways.
@MBrownstein89 @CKleinNY That's all true but he breaks bones, etc. Freak things. If he has osteoporosis, that makes him injury prone but unless you believe in good luck/bad luck, injury prone isn't a thing. But if it keeps his price down, then use it in negotiations.
@CKleinNY @MBrownstein89 I'm not saying he is. I'm saying no one is. There's no such thing. AJ Pollock could go the rest of his career without an injury.
@MBrownstein89 @CKleinNY not favorably. But this article is from 2014: https://t.co/xnGCMtLHyo		Called up in 2012 and by 2014 his season has ended because of a knee injury in two of his first two complete seasons. That day we'd refer to him as "injury prone" and he was. Until he wasn't.
@MBrownstein89 @CKleinNY so he was injury prone until he wasn't.
@CKleinNY @MBrownstein89 players are injury prone until they're not. Didn't Manny Machado ruin each knee in consecutive seasons? Nobody brings him up as injury prone.
@AlanLLee Thank you. He's not even Gary Carter (though I'd trade Hubie Brooks for him)

@Sophiaz12 what do you think of the Harvey-Mesoraco trade?
@jdharm He has nothing left. Perfect guy to trade for Mesoraco. A name you hear and picture a super star and then you look at their stats and realize they haven‚Äôt been good in years.

@peteylonglegs @robertbrender If Harvey is somehow Harvey of old, he'd be a risky and super expensive resign after this year. Profar is only 24. Maybe the Mets could finally get the player who finally blossoms instead of the other way around like Turner.

@Mikeya78 Hahahahaha
@Mikeya78 @realDonaldTrump Would you have Trump resign from the presidency if you knew it meant he then buys and runs the Mets?
@MattEhalt @StephenJosiah13 @jayhkim21 The fact that he and others put the Yankees on their list and not the Mets is what bothers me. It‚Äôs the same city. It‚Äôs an even playing field yet the Mets either through incompetence or disinterest refuse to make the changes necessary to improve their standing.
@MattEhalt @Mikeya78 You‚Äôre portraying the situation as a case where the fan base has out of whack expectations when the story here is you have 2 teams in the same market, one of which makes an effort to excel and one that is content to taking a backseat and ok with being the punchline of Boras jokes
@Mikeya78 And why WOULDN‚ÄôT he (or others) waive NTC to come to the Mets but would do it for the Yankees? Same city. https://t.co/qMD1GVtyCF
And it‚Äôs possible to change. Look at how desirable the Golden State Warriors have become. But you HAVE TO WANT TO. You have to invest, change a culture and attitude. Mets and Yankees share a city. It should be an even playing field. #Mets choose not to compete.
There should be no reason a player has the Yankees on their list and not the #Mets. The fact that countless players do is an indictment of the Mets ownership and reputation. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE even if it‚Äôs just the prices. You want to be the Padres? Charge us Padres prices
@FigSNY @Mets There should be no reason a player has the Yankees on their list and not the Mets. The fact that countless players do is an indictment of the Mets ownership and reputation. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE even if it‚Äôs just the prices. You want to be the Padres? Charge us Padres prices.
@StephenJosiah13 And, again, the Mets and Yankees are on an even playing field. The Mets choose to be second fiddle. There should be no reason that a player would have the Yankees and not the Mets on their list.
@StephenJosiah13 I expect SOMEONE to. And I expect the Mets to at least have the gumption, status and arrogance to make the effort to convince them that they do.
@StephenJosiah13 But it is. We‚Äôre both NY teams except the Mets are looked at like the Padres or Pirates. Mets have the capacity to behave like the Yankees and be as desirable as the Yankees but choose not to.
@RobPatterson83 @matthewcerrone @Giancarlo818 @Mets @MetsGM I agree. I‚Äôm sick and tired of the Mets not behaving like the big boys. We‚Äôre the after thoughts. We‚Äôre the Pirates, Royals and Padres. I‚Äôm paying NY prices, I want a NY product!!!!

something fishy about this story from the beginning. https://t.co/7GDhaGaMdl
@spivbilcaster @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump "This is the type of CARP"		WELL done!!!
@BobsBlitz @NFL Ha! Giants!
Please, @RaviBhalla, why are you allowing people to believe @mike_defusco did this &amp; not someone else doctoring up his flyers? Convenience? https://t.co/sa2rBfihFz
@sojerseycity @NParisik @mike_defusco @RaviBhalla They added the words above his head onto the already existing ad.
@megtkel @mike_defusco Me too
@BobsBlitz @NFL Which 6?
@palash_8737 @AudreyTruschke Fair point. I didn‚Äôt want to use an inflammatory example for fear of being misunderstood so I used the NJ/ugly one.
@LarryOConnor Whoa! A blast from the past!
@btarson @Apple Is it working??
@Teddylcewater @obxleatherman Why is this happening????
@ndotsimons @timothycsimons I get your joke!
@RaviBhalla, you should clear this up. You knew this was doctored &amp; not really from @mike_defusco before your tweet. Seems unfair not to. https://t.co/FqQAao6BuB
@joeherman3 @NParisik @mike_defusco @RaviBhalla @dawnzimmernj Or maybe @RaviBhalla can tweet about how it wasn‚Äôt from DeFusco and perhaps apologize for not making that clear this morning.
@desiindxb Now, I‚Äôm confused üòÄ
@TamaraDawn21 @tonysoares @CoryBooker @RaviBhalla It‚Äôs implied by tweeting the doctored flyer, leaving DeFusco‚Äôs name on it and not explaining that it was doctored. Seems so dirty to me.
@AudreyTruschke Dont hashtag me, enlighten me. Please. I see both as false and reputation hurtling events. Where am I wrong?
@AudreyTruschke U only RT 1/2 my statement. Wrongly calling some1 racist (Ravi already told was a doctored flyer) as bad as wrongly calling some1 terrorist
@AudreyTruschke You‚Äôre wrong here, Audrey. If I tweeted the following, who would I be attacking: ‚Äú@AudreyTruschke says all people from NJ are ugly‚Äù
@hoboken_horse @AudreyTruschke @mike_defusco ...Itself. Flyer wrongly paints Ravi as a terrorist. Tweet wrongly paints DeFusco as a racist.
@hoboken_horse @AudreyTruschke @mike_defusco Quite frankly, Ravi tweeting the doctored flyer and leaving DeFusco‚Äôs name after being told DeFusco wasn‚Äôt involved is as bad as the flyer..
@btarson @Apple Did you get the new iphone???
@mike_defusco @CoryBooker @RaviBhalla in the pic after he was told DeFusco had nothing to do with this. This smells fishy to me.
@mike_defusco @CoryBooker @RaviBhalla I‚Äôd like to know the circumstances on how this flyer was brought to Ravi‚Äôs attention. How many were found. Why he left DeFusco‚Äôs name...
@mike_defusco But @RaviBhalla should say that as clearly as he left your name in the corner of the pic he tweeted. Not fair, unless that was his point.
@mike_defusco r u saying this was altered by some1 not in your campaign? If so, make noise bc it‚Äôs not portrayed that way in tweet below https://t.co/CJ28G6Zlbh

@GeoffMan1776 @Robynmonty @CattHarmony @GeorgiaDirtRoad The movie is fine. Pro America. Don't spread Craig's message. He has his own, self serving agenda.
@DonCheech Look at the bright side. They're down by fewer than the Mets are.

@SuzyQL @CraigRSawyer If he hasn't blocked you yet, please ask him to unblock me so I know what to boycott next üòÇ
@SuzyQL that was fun while it lasted but @CraigRSawyer blocked me. Came close to having rational discussion. Guess that scared him off!
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay My main point is, this is a fun, outlandish movie. Not propaganda. There is no agenda other than to make as much money as they can.
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay I understand propaganda, as do you. You peddle it and/or buy into it. I can distinguish between fact and spin. Trust me, or don't.
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay I agree with that 100%. I think we just differ on who the enemies are.
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay You protect me, so I want to protect you from looking silly. This movie is not anti-üá∫üá∏. It is rah-rah üá∫üá∏. A traitor is caught and killed.
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay I really want to find common ground with you. I'm in awe of your bravery and service...
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay and furthermore (close your ears @SuzyQLüòä) @seanhannity taught me that boycotts are liberal tactics. You've now gone against Rush and Sean! https://t.co/cz0AZ1Hr1U
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @tiogamom1 @PhibianJay Did you audition for this movie and not get a part?  Seriously, why else could you be so irrational about it? It seems personal. Come clean https://t.co/bF56mcnO7D
@CraigRSawyer @SuzyQL @VinceFlynnFilm One rouge actor is not a reflection of the entire US military. By that logic, Bowe Bergdahl would paint everyone as a deserter.
@BrittRon @CraigRSawyer @klralms Sorry for the spoiler but had to set the record straight, No bigger patriot than Vince Flynn. HOW DARE YOU?!?
@BrittRon @CraigRSawyer @klralms One loony American, Iranian gov't, &amp; tons of radical Isamists are the bad guys. The CIA are the good guys.
@BrittRon @CraigRSawyer @klralms Its a surprise because its not true. The premise is NOT the the US Mil is our enemy.
@SuzyQL @CraigRSawyer @VinceFlynnFilm Yeah, Craig is going to boycott everything until there's no more fun left in the world (or until he's famous). Neither will happen.
@Bane1349 Yes, comrade!

@theAtrane @TheStoicSeer @CraigRSawyer Andy, you're fine. The movie is fine. Craig knows you get fame by calling for a boycott of popular stuff. I think Al Sharpton invented it.
@JaxMobile @CraigRSawyer Of course. It's a movie, it's fun, it's pro üá∫üá∏, anti-terrorism, anti-Islamic terrorism, they name names and countries. Stop creating outrage

@MitchRappFans @ediblered @MusicOnTheCouch @DangerousLee We had him on in 2007 too. That was the first time. It ended bc I burned myself out being mean to poor Vinny Bond.
@MitchRappFans @ediblered @MusicOnTheCouch What's the date on that? Maybe all of us will do it on the 10 year anniversary (though it was probably a @DangerousLee co-hosted episode)

@RitchMapp Omg was that in the same episode? I think we later had the guy who did that song on the show!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Oh really? I don't remember that! Scared to listen!!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Ha! Maybe next year for the 10 year anniversary of that interview. But I seem to remember comparing his wife to a Barbie doll &amp; getting heat
@RitchMapp @MitchRappFans I had forgotten all about discovering a band on MySpace (üë¥üèª) called "Billy Crystal Meth". I crack myself up!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered The interview ends. Vince goes back to watching the Twins/Tigers game which was in the bottom of the 11th. (Btw Twins won it in the 12th)
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vinny Bond then gives a glowing review of PURSUIT OF HONOR after having read it in Jamaica on his honeymoon.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince: "Ooooo. Um. IIIII don't want to answer that question! I'll answer it this way: I'm absolutely shocked that we haven't been hit again"
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered I ask Vince: "do you think, not that you would, but with what you know, do you think you could successfully pull off a terrorist attack?"
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered What do you think of Leon Panetta? (So far he's  done a very good job)
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Questions for Vince from that chat room, relayed by Vinny Bond: Would you consider running for office? (95% sure no way in hell)
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Actually, I said Americans consider long lines in Starbucks "torture" and that there's a difference between torture and inconvenience.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince says it's on the shelf. Was called "Fed Up" about an FBI agent.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered We take a call. It's Shirley asking Vince about a tv project he had in the works.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince Flynn on the main problem in Radical Islam: Women's rights. They need more female voices.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Man, I'm a good interviewer and Vince was a helluva interview.
@DaneMosher7 @MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Buxton was 16 years old when we did this interview!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered And then we talk about Vince's then new book PURSUIT OF HONOR, terrorism, torture and interrogation.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince said he had a lot of input into the script and that he and Lorenzo spoke about every 8-10 days.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered But Vince was confident that Lorenzo de Bonaventure and Nick Wechsler had the right vision. Then Vince got distracted again by baseball.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince's biggest fear was that the guy hired to play Mitch Rapp (Brad Pitt specifically) may be politically motivated to water down script
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Oh, and then I advocate for Jon Hamm. I must have been binging Mad Men at the time!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vinny Bond liked Thomas Jane or Matthew Fox for the role any you're right, Rappologist, Vince liked Gerard Butler at 14:40 mark.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered If Brad Pitt says yes, Vince said, he'd have been Mitch Rapp. Other names mentioned: Denzel Washington, Will Smith!
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Vince says they're talking to Brad Pitt and Vince is dubious that he's the right guy to play Mitch Rapp.
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered Now Vince is naming Mitch Rapp possibilities for the movie that little did we know was still 7 years away (and Consent To Kill)
@MitchRappFans @MusicOnTheCouch @ediblered You got me to listen. Vince and Vinny are now talking baseball fundamentals.
@MitchRappFans We won't bring that up in the future documentary, okay?
@MitchRappFans Did I mention Dylan O'Brien because if so, I may be Nostradamus

@cmm912 @Politcswatch btw The mention of "fake news" is where I bow out as well.
@cmm912 @Politcswatch But its a whole other topic and subject. We were discussing how there were no "good people" mixed in w/ the Nazis.
@Politcswatch @cmm912 That doesn't make them good people. Maybe slightly less bad? Good people don't remain and "hang out" with those chanting or punching.
@Politcswatch @cmm912 innocent bystanders? Who were they? I don't understand what you're getting at.
@Politcswatch @cmm912 Violence isn't the only thing that made them bad. Good people don't chant the things that were chanting or march along silently with them,
@Politcswatch @cmm912 I heard it, but what I'm contesting is, good people leave the scene if they're joined by Nazis.
@Politcswatch @cmm912 I'm sorry to butt in but, if you march with Nazis, you're a Nazi. You see a swastika, the right thing to do is leave.
