@NoFortunate @blueherring32 @Green_Footballs @sunrisemvmt @_waleedshahid @justicedems Many folks with the red rose seem to be Bernie or bust and are constantly attacking the rest of the party.

@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Right but I think that goes back to teaching skills that are currently of value in the workforce. Just like with coal miners. Instead of helping people learn new skills, the admin said coal would make a comeback but it isn't and those folks are getting black lung in the meantime.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Yup. Imo there needs to be more of an emphasis on quality public school education that focuses on technical and technology. Especially cybersecurity rn.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders By the way did you know the opiod crisis wasn't caused by immigrants but corporate greed (white ppl btw)?		https://t.co/xiH0pRiZsw
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Since he speaks of them in such dehumanizing terms and frames them as a threat I would expect that he would make certain they were here lawfully if it were really such a concern. Yeah nobody wants to let drugs or violence in but that's why imo violent criminals should be deported
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders But for corporations, they are all about the profit so they want to employ as few people as possible to save on overhead costs like insurance, workers' comp, etc.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Agreed. I think there needs to be an emphasis on teaching new job skills, etc.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Imo those who attack minorities just use those as a convenient scapegoat. Just like the president saying we need a wall when the president himself apparently hires all of these undocumented immigrants.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Affirmative action is used to help those who were previously discriminated against. I dont even know how much it is in effect currently, but the unemployment rate is low. If anything, the turn to AUTOMATION is taking away jobs. 		https://t.co/k4ICeTHmd2
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Dude. Do your research, please. That's like saying all whites or all Christians (insert any religion) are evil because of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting (insert any particular act of violence).
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders That's like a Tucker Carlson talking point. Did you know that for many decades a 10% or so white minority ruled South Africa. That only ended at least by law in the 90s		And I agree racism isnt a one way street but in America whites have not been the ones discriminated against.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders I assume you're talking about militant extremists but that's far from anyone who practices a particular religion. In some places they're the ones being imprisoned.  It's not fair to any religious denomination to generalize.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Only if you look at it in a vacuum. White people were not the ones who were enslaved and oppressed. That's one of the reasons why it is so important to uplift those who were.
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders Well actually it would be both because the quote was referring to refugees. 		So you're blaming a refugee crisis on a religion?
@JacobStewart50 @OverUnderClover @SenSchumer @SenSanders So saluting important civil rights advocates in our nation's history is somehow racist? 		The tweet you were referencing was not specific to Islam but to refugees. But even assuming arguendo you were referring Islam only, are you saying you're not racist just xenophobic?
