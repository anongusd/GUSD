Harris: "Obviously I read these emails today in a different intellectual light."
Mark Harris on emails from his son John about Dowless: "I just believed he was overreacting.... I did not take it as a major warning, that, danger ahead." #NC09
Yikes, Mark Harris didn't know son John was going to testify until the night before. He'd seen him walking on the sidewalk out front of the building in previous days. But it was his younger son who told him John was going to be taking the stand. #NC09
Mark Harris says that based on the testimony he's heard this week, he believes Dowless lied to him. #NC09
Um what? Mark Harris just said he was never made aware that independent expenditures cannot coordinate with a candidate. #NC09
But Harris said he trusted Dowless over his son back then. His son, although sharp, was just a 27-year-old lawyer in DC at the time, who had never been to Bladen County or met Dowless.
