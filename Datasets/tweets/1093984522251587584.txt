@NydiaVelazquez What a self-promoter you are.
@KamalaHarris I agree. I think we should start by sewing your mouth shut so no noxious gases escape.
@CoryBooker Even if the generation you're in is misguided?
@RSDigest Is that the only word you guys know how to use? When you don't have an argument, you yell, Racist!! When you can't articulate a soundly based idea, you yell, Racist!! A little bit more originality, please.
@RSDigest I'm only racist against one thing, bugwit--stupid ideals and utopians.
@RohdeD @AOC The Green New Deal is a movement driven by desperation, not common sense or real science. It's going to come back and bite the Democratic Party in the butt. AOC will be driven out of town on a rail.
@AOC That's because the majority of Americans don't side with you or your friend.
@lainnafader You may have a lot of power, but you're not a powerful woman. Margaret Thatcher said that being a powerful woman is a lot like being a "lady." If you have to convince people that you are one, then you're really not. https://t.co/U5Dt3YTAN2
@WabKinew Republicans don't have to do that because this thing is going to fall apart on its merits alone. And AOC is working her way to becoming demonized by those in her own party because she is going to be held responsible for the loss in 2020. She's a one termer.
@RepEscobar It's the border, JOSE. Nobody is trying to steal a line that already exists between two countries, PACO. Go eat your Chimichanga.
@JacksonLeeTX18 You guys are like parasites. You love to perpetuate hatred and continued victimization to stay in power. There is no systemic racism in America. You people create it.
@BrunoRguezP No te atrevas a llamarte Martiano, sinverguenza, hipocrita, communista huevon.
@LeaderHoyer @splcenter It's hard to overcome when you're enslaved by hatred and resentment.
@ajplus @IlhanMN Why not change the way they portray themselves. Why would you want to inflame the fear and suspicion with a hoody. By the same token, why would you want to emulate criminals in prison by wearing your pants lower than your underwear. I don't get the mindset. https://t.co/xEIUUgzEKv
@cenkuygur So tell us honestly. Why do you hate Jews?
@KamalaHarris And before her was Margarita Rodriguez--my gramma.
@CoryBooker Gee Cory. You and Kamala Harris are Superman and Wonder Woman. Why don't you save Alabama from tornados.

@stephenwertheim @IlhanMN The goal of the opponents of Netanyahu in Israel is not to destroy their country or hand it over to the Muslim Brotherhood. Miss Omar's long term goal, however, is to do just that.
@AMCTheatres You see how politically motivated this film is? They could have picked a Mexican, but there's hardly any drama. So they picked a Muslim because liberals are always defending the rights of psychopaths. They should have pick a legitimate refugee, like a Cuban. Me, for example. https://t.co/m9JwpNAgd7
@magicmartha149 @chrislhayes Stacey, listen carefully because I'm only going to say it once. "The constituents are just not that into you." Heck! You're a lawyer. Why don't you just go back to defending petty criminals that just don't get that they shouldn't be breaking the law.
@monaeltahawy @IlhanMN To quote FDR, "A date that will live in Infamy."

@Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan It's really not anti Blackness. It's anti Stupid.
@AOC Islam has been a blight on the world and antithetical to the constitution of the United States. Islam would have never engendered a document that begins with "We the people," and espouse inalienable rights. Islam is a heteronomous culture that rules by force and violence. https://t.co/aL5LGf7XyH
@RepAdamSchiff I would rather have a president who is an open book to his base than a Congress the convictions of which are tossed with every wind and in every direction from one decade to the next or even one year to the next.
@jemelehill @soledadobrien What is happening in America is called Fabian Socialism. It is a slower, more deceptive process, the goal of which is to establish full blown communism in the end. Abraham Lincoln said it plainly. America cannot be destroyed from the outside, but from the inside.
@ACLU @KamalaHarris This is not about using religion. If anyone believes in God and that God has a moral law, then LGBT will always be in opposition to moral law and to God.
@IlhanMN The fact that you call the state of Israel an "occupation" demonstrates your antipathy toward the Jewish people. Israel became a nation with the consent of the United Nations. They didn't go into Israel illegally. For those of us who know you, you can't hide your true feelings.
@thehill @HillaryClinton You folks have to mark her words because they are prophetic. When this country dissolves into chaos and civil war, what she says here is going to ring true to both the left and the right.
@KamalaHarris What an idiot. She hasn't enough considered the scientifically proven connection between cannabis and psychotic violent episodes. The fact that a great majority of those already incarcerated are there because of Marijuana.
Ethics watchdogs sound alarm over Trump tweet on Scotland golf course https://t.co/Wm7n3AZRy2	WOW! IF PEOPLE ARE ALARMED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET ON HIS GOLF COURSE, THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW THESE MEDIA OUTLETS REALLY NEED A LIFE.

@IlhanMN As a Muslim, you already have two strikes against you. The best thing for you to do would be to recuse yourself from any further comments or anything related to the Nation of Israel.
@RepYvetteClarke @ChaimDeutsch Tell your Muslim colleagues not to do it again.
@IlhanMN Don't try to hide behind your constituents. Besides, you're not debating; you're stating a Muslim position of hatred for Zionists. Your political and religious positions keep you from genuine loyalty to the United States of America. Muslims lie to "infidels" as a duty.
@SenatorCollins That depends on whether or not one believes that Congress is honeycombed with traitors and communists. As far as I am concerned, Trump should be able to have any power that helps him get his agenda completed.
@JayInslee For Democrats, yes, because they will lose on that platform.
@brandondarby @AnnCoulter That's why they need to stay home.
@IlhanMN We know who you are and we know what you believe. That's all we need to know in order not to trust or believe anything you say.
Rand Paul says that he will not back the President's Emergency Declaration. I'm beginning to think that the butt-kicking he got from his neighbor was probably well-deserved. https://t.co/wU3zKD5mKa
@soledadobrien I was born in a country that became communist (Cuba). I experienced the collectivism ideals of that philosophy, lost three relatives to firing squads and starved in bread lines. What is it you want to know about income distribution accept that everybody is poor equally.
@IlhanMN @GOP You're not an American. You are an infiltrated terrorist waiting for your moment to strike. That's what you say about Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson, isn't it. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
@soledadobrien @MeghanMcCain @TheView Why don't you come back to reality. Scenario: Woman goes to an abortionist. Baby survives abortion gasping for breath. Woman discusses with doctor what should be done with surviving child. Woman, who came for abortion, gives doctor permission to kill child. End of story.
@SenGillibrand @repjohnlewis You people just don't want America to get over its past, do you. You have to be continually reminded of the errors made. Is that what you do to your children to? Remind them of all their past sins? I wonder. Once a Democrat always a Democrat, even at home.
@KamalaHarris You know, they say that if Mama Cass and Karen Carpenter had shared that sandwich, they would both be alive today.

@RepJeffries Here's my Republican outrage, you feckless, red-bone wanna be black piece of fecal matter. My outrage is centered around you're unAmerican, flag-bashing, constitution-denying, white people hating diatribe. That's my outrage. Eat my shorts.

@SenGillibrand You're right about that because well-behaved women are home with their children instead of making trouble for our country. Well-behaved women aren't on the street at all hours of the night being harlots and doing drugs. Well-behaved women are good people.
@donnabrazile @AOC @IlhanMN Actually, if we had been better, we would not have ever let her in this country.
@RepJeffries Why not, one of yours recently use the "N" word against your people. I think you don't have ground on which to judge anybody.
@AOC Gee, let me see. Hmm. No, I'll stick with Islamophobia.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, are you a Princeton scientist? I think not. This is a battle for intellectuals of which obviously, you...are not a part.
The majority of immigrants that come to this country, pledge allegiance to our country and assimilate into our culture. Those who don't, come to our country to undermine our constitutional principles, to express hate and foment division. They reap the whirlwind. https://t.co/B6K4Rb6T51

@tribelaw @Lawrence Can you prove that?
@kylegriffin1 @Lawrence Yeah. Three million undocumented Democrats from California.
@ZerlinaMaxwell @IlhanMN I'll say something. She deserves it. You put out hate like that community loves to do and what do they expect? They can't get away with that. If you were honest with yourself about Muslims, you would accept that they hate America and Jews. You reap what you sow.
@HillaryClinton How about if we just return their kids to them and send them packing back to their countries of origin.
@jemelehill @soledadobrien That's usually what happens when you're making a better than average living and you get greedy. Nobody forced them to sign their lives away.
@TheToddSchulte @RepEscobar That should serve as a warning to other caravans. Come here illegally and you'll be separated from your kids or somebody else's kids that they might have kidnapped somewhere along the way.
@KamalaHarris Give parents a choice where they want to educate their kids. Public schools have become the poison of our society and we need to take them down.
@alyssagbetz @RepEscobar @repjohnlewis @LeaderHoyer @RepTerriSewell Give it a rest.
@JoyAnnReid It depends on your convictions about your Savior. Nancy Pelosi is a Catholic, but she is ready to allow the murder of innocent unborn children. They ARE children, not parasites or worms or beings without souls. If you love Jesus, you're going to talk about Jesus.
@Pastor_Earle In order for business to thrive, pay must be in relation to whatever the product or service that is being provided. The owner of the business or franchise should be allowed to expect a profit that makes him successful. The more successful he is, the more jobs he provides.
@SenGillibrand If you ask me, women should be home taking care of their children and making sure they're great Americans who love their country and believe that this is the greatest nation on earth with the greatest value. Do that and we can consider Mother's Day all year.

@SenBrianSchatz @SenateDems @SenWhitehouse @MartinHeinrich @senatemajldr The House floor is not the place for a scientific debate by unscientific minds. This debate should have been held in a public venue with the top scientific minds on earth.
@IlhanMN We'll see how many terms you serve.
@PattyMurray This is why women like these run for office. To talk about women's rights, their Menstruation, PMS, medical leave for women, abortion for women and whatever else women think is more important than keeping hoards of LGBT, illegal aliens and Muslims from destroying the US.
@marmotilla @AOC She asked the question whether it was smart to have children anymore. She opened the door and FOX walked right through it. The Liberal media (CNN, ABC, CBS, MSNBC) does the same thing.
@johnrobertsFox @chrislhayes @WhiteHouse Boo-Hoo!!
@Akil_N_Awan @chrislhayes It wouldn't be so bad if Muslims immigrated and adopted the culture of the country they were moving to. But, they don't assimilate or give their allegiance to the new country. They consolidate their power to oppose the country that allowed them to enter in. That is treason.
@AOC I've worked in that industry and I know that you worked as a bartender to have extra money for college expenses. Nobody works in that industry and takes that abuse because they want to. Your pay scale is according to job requirements. This isn't brain surgery.

@MSNBC Sometimes it is difficult to stand by your convictions. This man--unfortunately--did not. The true test of believing in something, is not allowing yourself to be compromised, no matter who is prodding you to do it.
@SenStabenow @SenateDems @SenateFinance I don't personally believe in donating money to research. Donations and drives are cash cows to Big Pharma that already has discovered the cure to cancer but is not sharing it because cancer doesn't kill quick enough like AIDS did at the beginning.
@SenStabenow @SenateDems @SenateFinance What you haven't gotten is what they already have in their safes. The answer to cancer and probably many diseases that we suffer from. It's like the BIG 3 Auto makers. Whenever somebody invented an engine that ran on water they bought it and shelved it.
@nowthisnews There are LGBT pretend Christians. There are Christians who compromise their faith. No real Christian would participate in LGBT lifestyle. Today we have two of the three components of Baal worship. LGBT and abortion. The third is coming--bestiality. https://t.co/96DpWhP2io
@ryangrim @AOC @BernieSanders @ewarren @mehdirhasan Centrists? Do you even know the meaning of that term? You're delusional.
@GOP No, he answered it. He answered it by stating all of the changes that will take place under his administration. They are all socialist in nature.
@HillaryClinton How about the intellectual attacks you brought on this country with your lies and corruption. You witch. https://t.co/lunwdjJynm
@yashar Excuse me. I'm not making a joke. Believe me, I understand. I worked in education for 20 years. Please explain for your readers what you mean by homogeneous. They may not be acquainted with the term.
@RepEscobar @CBP Nobody is forcing these people to come here. We have rules. If they don't want to be separated, they can leave as easily as they came. Turn around and go back. I don't even know why we allow them to come into the court system. They have no legal claim here.
@RepEscobar @CBP There is a more humane way to deal with the problem of family separation. When they arrive at the border, advise the parents that if they insist coming into the American territory to make their case in court, they will be separated. If they refuse, they can return home
@RepCummings I urge people to read the decision and why it was made. The voting rights of people were not infringed by the Supreme Court. Certain sections were simply updated to meet the current needs of the demographics of the districts in question. Cummings is a liar.
@LisPower1 @AOC This narrative--my dear child--was developed by something that AOC said herself. She stated it as a suggestion, but like Red China, suggestions have a way of being enforced in a tyrannical regime. God forbid that you should ever experience that like I have.
@FAIRImmigration What? This has been a matter of record since before Barack Obama came into office. As a matter of fact Barack Obama separated more families than Trump has to date.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump This is simply an effort to make their constituents believe that they fought back because they had a legal right to stop Trump. Believe me, the constitution is on the side of the president.
@KamalaHarris Knowing the poor condition that these people lived in, that baby was probably dead long before she was picked up by ICE.
@RepEscobar Let's be honest. I worked with a great majority of undocumented, illegal aliens. These people are the #1 cause of violence in California. They lead in Hepatitis, Tuberculosis, STD's, lice and other problems. This is not just a violence problem anymore. https://t.co/LgsAwWTviw
@avtorres4 @RashidaTlaib @by_the_ppl She's got no more moral authority that a rat in heat. As far as impeaching the president, she has a better chance of burning her Quran than accomplishing an impeachment.

@sandyhook @ChrisMurphyCT Another misrepresentation of the truth. In 2017, we had 40,100 deaths by automobile accidents. We had 47, 085 gun related deaths in 2017. All of the 47, 085 deaths by guns were suicide. At a rate of 129 a day.
@vdare @AnnCoulter Personally, I think we need to forget about a wall. We should dig a gigantic canal and fill it with alligators, sharks and other predators.
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter Could it be that the machine doesn't care what you're pretending to be. It's just concerned with the details of your face.
@RepKarenBass I think you're going a little bit overboard with that idea.
@MarkSimoneNY @AnnCoulter They have their own dictionary for what is love and what is hate.
@davelevitan @chrislhayes You see...this is what is so infuriating about these Climate Change people. There always taking about what's going to happen in the distant future. And even AOC is prognosticating for 12 years, but not one person will hold them accountable when they fail.

@RepJayapal @RashidaTlaib I understand your compassion, but I think you need to learn a lesson in financing. Take two or three of these people home with you. Feed them, clothe them, pay for their schooling and their health insurance. As AOC says, don't worry about the money.

@tedcruz I think that the best thing we can do with El Chapo's money is to pay every liberal democrat in the country to go live in Cuba or Red China where they will feel more comfortable with the regime they really appreciate. It works out for everybody. Then we can be friends again.

@pluralsight That's the problem of this generation. And, may I add, there may have been nothing in there to begin with.
@MissMishaSays @amjoyshow I said, "this polarized."
@nowthisnews One very important factor. You have to accept that you can't legislate the behavior you want from people. You may force them for a while, but the failure of this kind of thinking is that man will always resist the chains of his enslavement and break out of them. Dems will fail.
@nowthisnews Oh, you forgot to mention something. This gathering took place on February 20, 1939. Nazi appeal was still only an intellectual one. We were not at war with Nazi Germany and as far as they knew the Nazis were not an existential threat to the US.
@amjoyshow Let me just remind your listeners that we weren't this polarized until the advent of Barack Obama.
@nowthisnews @soledadobrien When are you morons going to accept that this is the best country in the world to express your true feelings freely?
@nowthisnews @soledadobrien Isn't constitutional government great. I love America and our freedoms. The first amendment protects hate speech or else it would not have been necessary.
@nowthisnews @soledadobrien Yeah. And the Klan used to have parades down Pennsylvania avenue decades ago. Regardless of what these people believe and how much we may have disliked it, the fact is that they were exercising their constitutional right of assembly, like you liberals still do.
@cmlindahl @JacksonLeeTX18 Hooray! Another lame excuse to skip class.
@soledadobrien Let me splain this to jew, Senorita. It means that the more potential there is for awareness and for people to exercise their autonomy, the more government has to restrict their civil liberties.

@gtroates @IrishTimes @Lawrence We can't control race mixing, In theory, if things continue to go as they are. One day there would be fewer blacks, fewer whites and a lot of like-skinned Mulatos in charge fomenting racism against the other two. It's human nature. But, I don't think we'll ever get there.

Reparations continued #3: Of course repatriation hasn't worked. Blacks that DID return to Africa haven't made it work and Nigeria is in big trouble. So don't complain. In spite of our mistakes, America is the best nation on earth.
Reparations continued: If you want to be fair and get technical, we forgot something that reparations hasn't done for black people. According to Abraham Lincoln himself--the chief proponent making good--reparations includes a free return trip to Africa or nation of your choice.
Reparations. The new political topic of 2020. The fact is that reparations have been made. Starting with blood. Half a million souls in the Civil War. Agrarian reforms after the war. The 13th &amp; 14th Amendments. Billions of $$ in entitlements through the decades. https://t.co/iMiUhKPcYE

There's no basis for morality in pragmatism.
@marcorubio Actually that reference doesn't apply to a child of the devil. Personally, I think he should be arrested and turned over to his adoring citizens. Much like they did with Mussolini.
@SenGillibrand Have you ever noticed that when white democrats want black votes the do, say strange things and then attempt to jive. Like Joe Biden's "He wants to put ya'll back in chains." Or this bimbo here talking using Harriet Tubman. I have slaves in my bloodline, do you?

@EOSALTCOIN1 @JosephNSanberg I figured, but he's a pious and religious communist.
@KamalaHarris Let's start by sewing your mouth shut and putting you on the next rocket to the sun.
@therealcornett @AnnCoulter You sure they're not illegals from Mexico? They look Mexican to me.
@VINTERINE What the heck did you just say?
@ChrisMurphyCT Trans people need the most mental health care. They have one of the highest suicide rates.
@saikatc @AOC Just lift yourself up and start running because what you're actually going to see is the worst of human nature.
Listen folks. There's a group on Twitter called "The True Secret@meetingjesusad" I've been a Christian for almost forty years and if there's one thing I can't stand it's people making themselves out to be prophets, presuming to speak for God. They're nothing but liars. https://t.co/9GOP6KlCR6
@JosephNSanberg You quote scripture quite a bit. What is your religion?
@RepLucyMcBath My deepest condolences for your loss. Your pain, however, is being used by people who don't have the best interest of America at heart. The day that the government disarms the general public will be a dark day for liberty and civil liberties.
@amjoyshow Hey Joy! You also ought to compare his statements to some of those of ANTIFA participants and the Congressional Black Caca.
@CoryBooker Please RSVP so that Cory can decide whether to cancel or not. Don't worry, Cory, if only a few people show up, it won't be a wasted trip for you. You can still go talk to the girls at the Chicken Ranch.
@KamalaHarris Oh, please! Stop pontificating all the morality bull crap. Miss "I inhaled."  God only knows what else you inhaled and swallowed during college, and I'm sure it wasn't alcohol.
"I just want to tell all my illegal, I mean undocumented friends out there. We have not abandoned you. ICE will not bother you if you learn English and stop eating that greasy Mexican stuff.

@CoryBooker You know--you wanna be black man--you're about as dumb as a box of hammers. Have you read the latest scientific findings regarding the connection between Cannabis consumption and Psychotic episodes of violence? I bet you haven't.
Former Obama Activist: "Run Away" To Trump! https://t.co/CoEsIt4HTi via @YouTube	JUST WALK AWAY, PEOPLE!
@IrishTimes @Lawrence From what I know of Brexit, I'm willing to bet that those who wanted it in Britain, also wanted their country back from the effects of a runaway immigration system that is ruining their country.
@chrislhayes Chris, I had three relatives killed by firing squad in Cuba. No trial, no defense lawyer. I hope you're not associating Trump's presidency to the Nazis of the 1940's because that would just demonstrate what a total ignorant ass you are.
@AOC This is probably one of those lying dossiers like the one they tried to use against Trump.
@SenGillibrand The way you give power back to the people is by doing what Trump is doing.
@MeekMill @TheEllenShow This is a great way to raise young black children. Role models that exemplify the worst of the ghetto life.
@israhirsi @IlhanMN People die when you give this kind of power to children.
@kylegriffin1 That's alright. As long as she's on her psychotropic meds and she's not on her period, she should be able to handle it.
@amjoyshow Wow! You dummies are going all out on this socialism thing. Let's see. Green New Deal, Medicare for everybody, and now, reparations for every black man, woman and child, even though we've been doing reparations since the end of the Civil War. You'll never elect a Democrat.
@JosephNSanberg Were you there in the 60's? I was. What Martin Luther King intended and what modern black folks intend today are worlds apart, friend.
@JosephNSanberg I know one thing. At least half of those are suicide. Now give us the stats on murder, self defense and police-involved shootings. Do it right, butt wipe.

@KamalaHarris President of what exactly?
@JosephNSanberg Tell me what you know about God's love, Joey.
@PORTERmagazine @EllenPage Yeah, we try to keep it where it belongs--in the sewer.
@maddow Old Bill Clinton could get scooped up in this mess. But, you know what happens to whistle-blowers around the Clintons. Epstein could end up face down on the beach with a dildo stuck in his private parts.
@SenatorShaheen Say it right. He's refusing to pay for murder.
@jimsciutto That's a good thing.
@michaelbd That--my dear Bugwit friend--is because the President doesn't have any obligation to share his mind with everybody in the White House, including the gardener.
@CWDA_CA @EndChildPovCA @GavinNewsom @DrBurkeHarris @TeenVogue Now there's a pithy statement if I ever heard one.
@RepEscobar @BennieGThompson @HomelandDems @RepTorresSmall I'm sure Bennie cares what happens to Mexicans.
@amjoyshow @NBCNews Look at this guy's face. He has that arrogant Obama "I'm so great" expression.
@PattyMurray Your constituents must be real stupid. That's stuff has been available in hospitals for decades. Don't piss down our legs and tell us it's raining.
@maddow Rachel! You ought to know this. Epstein isn't going to be prosecuted because Bill Clinton was part of pulling that train on those young girls. Do you--a rabid Democrat, lesbian, feminist and all around apologist for all things wicked--want Bill in Jail? I think not.
@WIRED @AOC Do they ever have any real decent Americans on there with some knowledge and substance or is the problem that the hosts, "Bevus and Butthead," wouldn't be able to ask any substantive questions?
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump This is a great letter day. Now Planned Parenthood can start panhandling in their neighborhoods, having BBQ's and selling candy bars door to door.
@DrLeanaWen @SenWarren People have access to health care in America. What you're talking about is paying the healthcare costs of people who don't want to work, but who unfortunately vote.
@HouseDemocrats I can vouch for that. Sun is good. House Democrats agree, especially the Congressional Black Caucus because they hardly use soap and water.
@chrislhayes Here's a test for truth. Correspondence and Coherence. If you test Climate Change using that, you will find out whether or not it's real science or fake.
@RashidaTlaib @ATT @CWAUnion You go get em, girl! But watch out for innocent bystanders.
@HouseDemocrats Wait a minute. Let me see if I got this right. Are you saying that Trump is assaulting American women's period so that it will come to a full stop? Is that the message? Well, I don't see how they would mind that at all. No more anger and insanity every 28 days.
@viaCristiano @GirlsWhoCode Teaching young women to STEM. That sounds pretty kinky. With all the sex education in school, I think they experiment quite a bit with the STEM. LOL.
@DarrenJBeattie @AnnCoulter Actually, you know what? If we took all the money we spend on entitlement programs for illegals (200 billion annually), they would go back to Mexico and we wouldn't need the wall. Plus, we'll be able to hire all these poor people in America the Dems tell us about.
@RepUnderwood Did you take them something to eat?
@arianalgbtq What would you do if you didn't have those ghetto role models, huh? Smakum Yakum, ya'll!!
@SenDuckworth @MotherlyMedia Thank you for your service, but the only thing you've proven is that you can leave your child with a nanny or a grandparent so you can "find" yourself in the world. My daughter is a doctor and I would have preferred that she stay home with her kids. It comes back to bite you.
@VINTERINE You're just giving that stuff away for free, huh?
@ChrisCoons Just to make people think that you care. Don't fall asleep.
@ArianaGrande For those of you who don't speak "Dumb ass," let me interpret. She said, "Just to let you know that we're going to be alright."
@DanRiffle @chrislhayes You're asking for a salary floor of 52k for people who haven't learned that paying your dues and making your bones in society is part of maturing as a human being to appreciate those aspects of life that make you who you should be. Get an efficiency apartment for $600.
@RepYvetteClarke @BlacKkKlansman You see that. These folks get sent to Washington to work on important issues and they waste time and taxpayer dollars to extoll the virtues of a cultural revolutionary and racist.
@badgirlpripri @Lawrence I think the obsession is from the women since they have--of late--become interested in bestiality.
@PattyMurray Providing a woman with a safe legal abortion is tantamount to complicity in a murder.
@RepEscobar I've been to El Paso, lady. I've looked over the border fence to Juarez. The difference to me was quite apparent. Our side breeds life, their side breeds death and privation. El Paso will never be anything but a world-renown destination for its view of a large Mexican landfill.
@tedcruz Because, the story of Robin Hood--taking from the rich and giving to the poor--sounds so heroic and romantic. They want the people to believe that they are the only ones fighting for the downtrodden and poor. Its actually the lazy and the shiftless.
@RepHankJohnson @RockdaleGov Seeing as how you folks are always demanding equality and equal opportunity, are you going to mention a white firefighter tomorrow? Just axing (asking).
@HouseDemocrats What sacrifice! They got a ride from somebody else or they walked a few blocks.
@AOC @GirlsWhoCode AOC's definition of bravery or courage is opening her mouth to talk without having a brain in her head. Now, that's courage.
@KamalaHarris Its amazing to me how you democrats lie to the public so blatantly about voting rights. I would like to see one case, just one case where people were prevented from voting. Fake ID's or no ID's don't count. Neither does non-citizenship.
@drkristinek I got an idea Dr. Psycho. Why not let your reality influence your thoughts?
@justicedems @AOC You forgot one. Make everybody poor in order to pay for it. We'll all be eating out of trash cans before the Dems are finished with us. https://t.co/qsRouzG9k4
@NydiaVelazquez @HouseDems @realDonaldTrump Those are fake numbers. Probably a poll in San Francisco among gays and lesbians.
@SenWarren Massachusetts families are probably better off economically that most people in the rest of America. My daughter has a nanny for her kids. And other people pay so much because they don't want them mixing with strange little kids with lice and TB from strange lands.
@AOC Hey! I'm ready for the Apocalypse. Bring it on. I'm getting kind of sick of listening to all you Knuckleheads. Maybe you wouldn't be so afraid about your futures if you repented of your sins and received Christ as your Savior.
@WhipClyburn I personally don't see the need to remember negativity unless you are profiting politically from keeping black people thinking of themselves as perpetual victims.

Don Lemon said that Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and the President would all be eating Jussie Smollett's lunch for the next several days. Well...I would say that this vision is a lot more palatable than what you would eat from Smollett if you got him into a private room.
@nowthisnews I don't know that you're telling the truth because your standards may be unnecessarily higher than what the government finds to be healthy and appropriate. So I think you may be inflating this thing to make Trump look bad.

@RBReich @Lawrence @ewarren Actually it's Obama's deficit, but now Trump has to work with what he's got.

@ryangrim @chrislhayes 70 billion a year, paid by taxpayer dollars from money earned by parents, one of which should be home taking care of those kids anyway. WHICH, would cancel out the need for a 70 billion dollar a year universal child care program. I don't want to pay for somebody else's kids.
@PattyMurray @BobbyScott It impacts our economy because mothers who should be home taking care of their own kids can't have it both ways. Something always suffers when a woman works outside the house. Paying other people to do a mother's job defeats the purpose of woman's liberation.

Kirsten Gillinbrand is endorsing and promoting a third gender. She must be an atheist, a scientific materialist. To such a person, sin nor the standard to judge it exist. Everyone can do what they want, when they want. This is the democrat agenda.

@DavidJHarrisJr @AnnCoulter @JussieSmollett So much for liberal truth.
@FaceTheNation @ChrisCoons @realDonaldTrump So if you make any changes to that in Congress, would you make it retroactive to George W. Bush and Barack Obama, because they both used the same procedure?

@cenkuygur @justicedems @RoKhanna @AOC @IlhanMN @RepJayapal @RepRaulGrijalva @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib You're right about one thing. They sure are making a lot of obnoxious noise, but doing anything? Well, that remains to be seen.
@MurrayCampaign So what you're saying is that Obama's use of the sale privilege was un-American and fake as well? Is that what you're saying, Patty girl?
I just thought of something. I spend a lot of time on Twitter because I'm retired. Liberal politicians seem to spend as much time as I do on Twitter. Do they ever get any actual work done? I wonder. https://t.co/jxQ1yolkHm

@KamalaHarris @GavinNewsom Well...I don't think his word counts for much in other parts of the country. Your endorsement from him might get you a free donut and a cup of Joe.
This is the kind of factual data that liberal liars like Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Jeffries, AOC, Rashida whatever her last name is, and Omar stay away from. I think that we need to build a wall down 100 ft. and up 50 ft. https://t.co/3PQ7HB9EwY

@cenkuygur @RoKhanna I'll be honest with you, my young ottoman friend. I think they should make that place a glass parking lot over there.

@Cocoxochitl You know, Mr. Mud, I was trying to be nice, but this latest encounter with you makes me realize that you liberals are incapable or articulating an argument. All you do is get ugly. We--on the other hand, at least make an attempt to counter, AND THEN, resort to name-calling.

@nytopinion @AOC @JedediahSPurdy The lost generation is the only one that could possibly promote and accept the Green New Deal. They have no idea what they're getting into.
@KamalaHarris I live paycheck to paycheck. I work for a month, get paid on the first. Work another month and get paid on the first of the month. And so on, and so on, and so on. What is so terrible about that? That's how it works.

@CoryBooker And you did it all yourself. Aren't you a great guy.
@VINTERINE Looks great!!
@Osaze_E @VINTERINE Well, here's your first compliment. It looks great on you.
@SpeakerPelosi Gee, I wish I could get one of those. Who is that pathetic soul next to Clyburn? He looks rather swishy.
@benwikler @AOC I would have never come  up with that myself. Pithy. Pithy.
@Cocoxochitl I like that. I can tell you're deep soulful person. "You pathetic troll." Great stuff.
@ChrisCoons The last time somebody got lynched was in 1981. It was called murder then and the perpetrator was executed in 1997. It's still murder today and making it a federal crime is fluff. It is the penchant of the Democrats to want to appear like they're actually doing something. https://t.co/QouSs7dQN7

@RepYvetteClarke "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." Matthew 6:5

@WhipClyburn Everybody wants to introduce a bill, no matter how stupid it is.
@HouseDemocrats I commend Candace Payne for her compassion and efforts. This is what you call personal charity from the heart. The government, however, would force us to pay into the government so that they can later decide when and to whom to be charitable. Not my money, dude!
@CoryBooker As a told your buddy in the Red Bone Caucus, Kamala Harris, we already have murder on the books. Michael Donald was lynched in 1981. His murderer was executed in the electric chair in 1997. Your efforts could have been used on something more productive.
@SenGillibrand Obama Care was a bigger waste of time and money.
@PattyMurray You have to admit. Women are all heart with this plethora of entitlements. They're just compassionate to a fault. They want to tuck everyone in at night except their children. Unfortunately, it's that lack of reason and accountability that is going to ruin this country. https://t.co/juX9XDQJCI
@benwikler @AOC Great! More enemies of this country in the halls of Congress.
@AnneHolton Your Sweetie needs to care about serving the American public.
@repcleaver Wow, Mr. Cleaver, you're really riding the boat of self-serving interests, huh? Everything except protecting the country that would give you and your constituents all those goodies that you're for.
@SenFeinstein Well, aren't you a self-serving harlot.
@Brykharris_ALM @SenatorLeahy @SenatorMenendez @SecPompeo Khashoggi was no angel and no friend to America. If he went looking for trouble in Saudi Arabia, there's no reason why we should trouble ourselves over it any longer. He burned his bridges with his fellow Muslims and he got what was coming to him.
@LeaderHoyer @POTUS Last week there wasn't a caravan pushing up against the fence, so in a sense you're not lying. In a very real and wide sense, you are deceptive and underhanded to the core.
@repjohnlewis You mourn those kids? Yeah, right. You'll probably mourn if you don't some political mileage off of it.
Joe Biden will soon declare that he will run for president. I'm so glad! Who else among the Democrats would be able to follow up on Bill Clinton debauchery. He doesn't care how old they are. https://t.co/9Ja4lKdsNI
@WhipClyburn By the way Crotchburn, I don't know who you're talking to, but places of worship can't be taxed.
@WhipClyburn Dear, dear Mr. Crotchburn. For a black man, you shoo iz dum. I love it when you liberals wax religious and you misquote scripture. Matthew 25:45 is not speaking about the poor and destitute. It is speaking about believers in Christ.
@SpeakerPelosi What would these clowns do without their cameras?
@KamalaHarris How about inane and corrupted elected officials like yourself.
McConnell declared today that the President will sign border wall legislation AND declare a national state of emergency to build the rest of the wall. This makes me so happy. Yeah! Bring it on. Its about time for a bare knuckle fight with all these no gender Democrats. https://t.co/LnB7I6kWJp
@ChelseaClinton Thank you, Chelsea!! Thank you, thank you!! You are the first woman in America that I know of that has spoken out about under-aged girls being forced into marriage. Keep after those Muslims.
@SenSanders I bet somebody had to remind you what today was. Take your meds, Bernie. You don't remember those kids and you certainly don't care about their parents. You just want to control your enemies.
@CoryBooker Sure! Keep the hatred and the resentment alive. As long as you have that, you have plenty of gullible fools out there you can count on never to ask you any real, serious question about what you're doing.
@KamalaHarris We already have something in the books about this. Its called murder.
Evil has a face. It no longer cowers in darkened corners because our indifference has emboldened it to mock us and ridicule us. It attempts to convince us of its merit and worth. It is a lie. We must not weaken our resolve, but rather rise in indignation and crush it. https://t.co/92jhpB7PI0

It seems rather ironic to me that a woman born into so much tragedy and terror, should come here to America to avail herself of the benefits and pleasures a free society can give. Only to disparage the very nation that granted her and others of her culture freedom and abundance. https://t.co/WToPkF8emx
@donlemon @purpleforora Pastor John MacArthur from California told Ben Shapiro during an interview that he saw his role as a Christian as someone that must offend everyone. Telling people to repent of their sin and accept Christ as their Savior can be offensive. So, consider yourself offended.
@KamalaHarris Another loser who has burned her bridges with big money now has to beg people for donations.
@SenatorCarper @SenateDems Why should he recuse himself, Bugwit? He has no connections to Trump or any other member of the administration. His job is to run the Justice Department, including overseeing the Mueller investigation. That would be anybody you put in that job.
@RepHankJohnson Its funny that when Obama filled the court with judges that were sympathetic to his agenda, you didn't say anything about ethics and independence of the court. You already have somebody pulling your leash, now all we need to see is the organ.
@Paul01108301 @FoxNews That's because he can't take the heat. I was going to tell him that if he's looking for a fight with this Green New Deal thing, he's going to get one.
@FakeDanWeber @fwdale @IlhanMN Whatever floats your boat, dude.
@MurrayCampaign Make sure you tell people that the 34 indictments were on unrelated charges. You still haven't proven that the President did anything with the Russians. Hillary is more guilty of Russian interference than Trump.
@RepJerryNadler The gun violence epidemic is a moral problem, not a tool problem. A gun is a tool. Should the liberals be successful in confiscating guns, we'll just find another way to kill each other. What's next? Knives, nooses, tall buildings, cars? Please.
@FakeDanWeber @fwdale @IlhanMN In closing, let me just say that Yes, Obama's birth was back in the early sixties. That aside, it could have affected his eligibility for president in 2008 if it had been proven true. End of story. The Iran-Contra affair is a fact of history, but it is not relevant to the present
@FakeDanWeber @fwdale @IlhanMN Considering that one occurred more than thirty years ago and Obama's birth certificate thing was at the height of the election, I don't see a double standard. This is a legitimate question that had to be answered. It also didn't help that Obama himself claimed to be Kenyan.
@FakeDanWeber @fwdale @IlhanMN By the way. Anybody's nationality is of grave concern as to whether a person is qualified to be president. And I don't think it was as long as you say.
@FakeDanWeber @fwdale @IlhanMN Personally, I always believed that was a futile effort.
@brian_love2 @RashidaTlaib @rocmichigan @USCapitolHill1 @rocunited The lunatics have taken over our most cherished institutions.
@RepEscobar @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Of course! Mexicans can't be seen to be completely responsible for causing their own crisis. I mean, after all, only normal human beings would walk thousands of miles with their infant children in tow in order to avail themselves of our misplaced compassion.
@KamalaHarris No. Actually is just another sign that people who can't afford an expensive new car should have known better than to get into a financial obligation they couldn't handle. You are such an idiot.
@fwdale @IlhanMN It's amazing. Liberals will go back as far as they have to disparage this country. Knowing full well that Americans today have no recollection of anything that happened in the eighties. This is another reason why this will eventually end in bloodshed.

@CNN @JacksonLeeTX18 My brother--a 33 year man--once told me that people who have no honor, cannot take reproof or correction. Rep. Ilhan Omar is one of those people. Instead of being humbled by her experience, she remains vitriolic and confrontational. Her apology is meaningless and deceptive.
@SenSanders @sunrisemvmt Bernie, I can't believe you've reached such an age and haven't learned to be a realist. But then, you're not a realist, are you? You're a pragmatist. There is no standard for morality in pragmatism or subjectivism. Its all morally relative to you isn't, Bernie?
@AOC People know where to go when there's a soft touch to be taken advantage of.
@ZerlinaMaxwell The only people born into privilege are the children of those who worked for it. That is not a bad thing if they learn to appreciate it. Privilege given under the guise of charity often goes unappreciated and it is squandered by those who are opportunists. Plenty of those.
@ZerlinaMaxwell I'm not offended by what you say about white people because it is the result of your own negative self-image. In order to make yourself feel better you have to attack a perceived enemy. You need help. I've written a response to this delusion of white privilege. Send it to you?
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN Sabire. I feel sorry for you because you can't tell the difference. You people live in your own little bubble believing in the brotherhood of man and the innate goodness of humanity. Man will never achieve this wonderful existence you believe in. I'm finished with you. No more.
@ChelseaClinton @Barbie They should have made a doll that looks like you that is mentally retarded.
@JessWeiner @ChelseaClinton @bornjustright @jordanjustright You're so obtuse. Why don't you just let children enjoy their fantasy years without forcing tragedy, perversion and politics on them. There will be plenty of time to learn about weird idiots like you.
These liberals like to say that Trump traffics in hate. We don't traffic in hate. We traffic in common sense and reason. The two concepts that liberals and those living in delusion don't seem to grasp. This Green New Deal is a perfect example of mental instability. https://t.co/bF8HCcufGA
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN We often have to choose between the lesser of two evils in this world, Sabire. Grow up. This vision of Utopia that you have will never happen until Jesus himself returns to rule this world. Outside of that, men will never accomplish it.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN What makes you think we elected Trump because he was an example of moral virtue? Since when is Washington a standard of morality? We elected Trump because he best supports the issues we believe in. If you believe there are any politicians who are moral, you're gullible.

@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN Jesus said "Be wise as serpents, but harmless as doves." We won't be judged by how much we gave and to whom. We will be judged by the condition of our heart when we gave. Governments use the poor to achieve a political end. Christians give out of love and compassion.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN I don't have contempt for the poor. I simply have a different methodology to address the problem. And what is wrong with a literal application of scripture?
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN By the way, a parable is not necessarily an untrue tale. Check out the definition of a parable. Good-bye Sabire.
@SenSanders Don't talk about morality only when its convenient for you. You are not a moral person.
@SenGillibrand Actually, we would all be better off if you all shut your whining pie hole.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN Sound like you're upset. People like that resort to insults. Typical liberal.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN Secondly, Acts 20:35 is taken out of context by you. Paul is referencing I Corinthians 8:1-13. Weak believers, not the poor. Paul himself was pretty hard against the lazy (II Thess. 3:10) and about those who don't take care of their family (I Tim. 5:8). Study up.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN First of all, Sabire, John 6:26 has nothing to do with being charitable, but rather about the evil and greed of human nature.
The new governor of California, Gavin Newsom has declared that the Bullitt Train Project will be discontinued due to cost overruns, but when grilled to explain his decision in further detail, the governor simply said, "It just wouldn't fit in my butt. I mean in my budget." https://t.co/xxNazqdGfB

@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN One last thing, Sabire. You mentioned Christianity. You're right. God's economy doesn't make room for people who are lazy or self-serving. As a matter of fact Jesus backs the business owner on pay (Matthew 20:1-16) and corrects people who follow him for free food (John 6:26).
@KIZOKUGARI_ZORO I was trying to be humorous because the notion of the Green New Deal is so preposterous, financially untenable and logistically ridiculous that it makes anyone who promotes it seem like a mental retard. https://t.co/bAUSOjLGTx
@AOC I can't believe people are spending so much time on this climate change nonsense. Even if it were true, there's nothing you could possibly do to stop it. Nobody wants to do anything to alter their lifestyle anywhere in the world.
@SenSchumer @SenatorLeahy So if you have a pond on your land, you can't use the water in it without the government's approval. Talk about fascism.
@KamalaHarris True. I know many white parents that have suffered that.
@AOC Wait till I'm dead before you put such a crazy plan into action.
@my2geminis @sidibongo @IlhanMN Sabire is misrepresenting Japan. Many people in Japan are leaving for greener pastures because of the taxation rate and the danger of losing what they've worked for in three generations.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN If you want to pay higher taxes, go ahead. Nobody is stopping you, but don't ask me to sacrifice my family for somebody who may not necessarily be doing his fair share to feed his own. Charity is a personal matter. You can't legislate generosity.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN Even the poorest of Americans haven't experienced poverty like I've seen it around the world. so go tell your fairytales somewhere else Sabire.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN I don't know where you're from, buddy, but Americans don't know what poverty is. If kids go to bed hungry in America, you can bet its because a parent is misusing welfare and food stamps for other things. We have too many programs in this country that feed people.
@sidibongo @my2geminis @IlhanMN This idea that CEO's or any company owner is obligated to share his profits with the workers is ridiculous. A McDonald employee agrees to work for his wages when he signs on as an employee. You want to live in Sweden or Finland go ahead, but don't whine about our system.
@SenSanders What you mean is that everyone over 18 should be registered to vote democrat because you're counting on a politically ignorant youth.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump Yeah! I heard Puerto Rico still has a bunch of dead people that haven't been buried. Additionally other services haven't been restored. FEMA has rendered sufficient assistance to PR. The problem is incompetence on the part of locals. If you don't use what you have, you lose it.
@SenDuckworth @AFGENational A lot you're going to do about it.
@CoryBooker President Bill Clinton signed the Medical Leave Act which guarantees 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a newborn. Some companies go beyond that. Finland offers three years of paid leave, but then, their taxation is insane. We rather keep our money.
@sidibongo @IlhanMN That is such a lie that it does not even merit a response.
@sidibongo @IlhanMN What you're espousing has been proven false on so many levels. I've experienced it myself by living in a country like that. You may fool the average American, but not somebody who has been a victim of such a government.
@SenAlexander Let me be the first to propose an experiment to find the cause of pain. I will get a hammer and bash you on the head. If you feel pain, we'll know we're getting somewhere.
@KamalaHarris What is reasonable reform to you is gun confiscation. We have enough gun laws on the books. We don't need more.

@SenBlumenthal Actually, what the Democrats are worried about is that one day they will finally push the electorate to far and that they will come looking for them in Washington.
@sidibongo @IlhanMN They also suffer under unbearable taxation.
@PattyMurray Well, if you had agreed to the president's demands, it wouldn't have happened. Besides, they all get back pay.
@sidibongo @IlhanMN Let's grow up and be frank. Conquest and greed make empires. Ours may not be perfect, but a free market economy creates jobs on all levels. The poorly educated end up working at McDonalds. If you excel and you're ambitious, you rise to the top. That's life in the real world.
@AllyValentino @ChelseaClinton You're right. These problems were created primarily by the Democrats, their policies and radical feminism.
@thedailybeast Put him in the dryer and he'll shrink down to the size of this little guy. https://t.co/QKsM8FljOc
@RepHankJohnson @HouseDemocrats Democracy that "works" for everyone in the sense of equal results is not democracy.
@SkollFoundation @Water @NatGeo People don't care, Skoll, and Matt Damon should realize this. San Francisco is a perfect example of people behaving worse that animals simply because they're too lazy to look for a Johnny on the spot.
@thedailybeast I don't know that people want a Senator that looks like Mini-Me.
@BBCJonSopel @RepEscobar Antifa attacks on Christian prayer rallies were no surprise either.
@AllyValentino @ChelseaClinton You know, we're not getting anywhere. I can't believe what I'm reading. "Shame" and "secrecy?" You use terms that are normally used for immoral behavior, and that is because you have turned a mother's role into a bad thing. Talking about PMS is a mother's task not the public's.
@IlhanMN That's because the owner of the company--in a free market economy--gets to decide what he wants to pay his employees. If they don't like it, they can go somewhere where they will pay a higher salary.
@IlhanMN @washingtonpost You know, Ilhan, let me educate you. Those jobs were not originally created to support families. They existed for high school kids and college age kids. Forcing these companies to pay higher wages will eventually force many to automate. Chazam!! No more jobs.
@RepHankJohnson @HouseDemocrats Go back to the 60's where your stupid comments actually make sense.
@RepEscobar Oh! Blow it out your back side Veronica. You people are the authors of division, strife and calling for violence. When was the last time a Trump supporter got physical with one of you maniacs? But, let me tell you. You folks keep pushing and you'll get a much deserved reaction.
@SenSanders I got paid leave and my wife was the one having the baby.
@AllyValentino @ChelseaClinton I stand by my comment. We turn everything into a trigger and a stigma nowadays. To be perfectly candid, this is nature. Somebody has to bleed. If hadn't been you, it would have been me. We each have our roles. We either accept them proudly or you spend your time here resenting.
@PattyMurray @NPWF Thanks to Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty we have a worse situation today than in the 60's.
@AllyValentino @ChelseaClinton Refresh my memory. I hardly make ignorant comments. If you're referring to the "prepubescent" thing, I'm right. How stupid to involve teenagers in political issues when they get their education from Game of Thrones. Schools aren't teaching anything of value.

@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy You're supposed to be impartial. Shut your trap and get back to reporting the news as it happens, not how YOU want it to happen.
@SenatorHassan This woman is so obtuse. Its already on the books people.
@ChelseaClinton Stigma? Please!! Get over it.
@HillaryClinton That's what we need. A mob of prepubescent mean girls to lead our nation when they don't even know how to wipe their butt right to keep from contaminating their vagina.
@SenSanders Bernie, you are such an instigator. I got a raise in my Social Security, no thanks to you. The only way that Social Security benefits will be taken away is if we let too many illegals in here to absorb what belongs to our seniors. That is why you should help build the wall.
@AOC @RevJJackson Jesse Jackson Sr. is a discredited example of ghetto pimping and huckster opportunism. Here he is promoting the babblings of a woman devoid of common sense, wisdom, reason and accountability. I've lived under rabid socialism and communism. Ask me what truth is. https://t.co/BriwPsViRu
@SenAlexander Here!! Let me try again. Pain is something that God gave you to let you know that there is something wrong with you. That's all you have to understand about pain. Of course, some people bring pain upon themselves, but for those who live with chronic pain, give them a pill.
@JamilSmith @ChelseaClinton That is what the governor said, Bugwit. I heard him myself. So, Mr. Smith--if that is your real name--research before you make an ass of yourself. Are you a Muslim? Well if you are, "Asalama Obama."
@JuddLegum @ChelseaClinton No!
@HillaryClinton The truth is Hillary that when you offer people a new way to expand on an already insidious method of ridding themselves of their children, they exploit it to the fullest. You people are beguiling the public into becoming as perverse as you and ruining the moral fabric of the US.
@SenAlexander You want the cause of pain? I'll tell you. Your unrepentant sin.
@HillaryClinton Your health plan was turned down by the public and so was everything else about you. You can't even cough your way to redemption lady. https://t.co/FKo5Wi4KyP
@AOC You want to close off corporate dollars to stop influence, but you yourself want corporate dollars to create your Green New Deal. The difference is?
@RashidaTlaib Ok. You said your piece. Now go home.
@Thalia_Nyx @janelle8342 @Matthew_1of2 @GavinNewsom Your response is a perfect example of an undisciplined mind. A parochial ability with communication and an inability to reason or to be accountable. You must look like your picture.
@PattyMurray Are you in Venezuela by any chance?
@janelle8342 @Thalia_Nyx @Matthew_1of2 @GavinNewsom Keep your chin up. Be courageous.
We can build the wall AND have El Chapo pay for it... @tedcruz's #ELCHAPOAct is how. Stand with Ted Cruz and add your name as a citizen cosponsor: https://t.co/e9aq9HfTXP #TXSen
@SenSanders Wait a minute, Bernie. The Green New Deal wants to shut down the airlines, right. Well, a shutdown of the government would help the Democratic push on Climate Change by stopping the planes. No fossil fuels burning.
@ananavarro @IlhanMN Isn't that just like a Democrat. All you have to do is apologize and everything is alright. The problem is that you don't extend that courtesy to Republicans. Just yourselves.
@JanelleMonae Oh! A doomsday promoter.
@janelle8342 @Thalia_Nyx @Matthew_1of2 @GavinNewsom Get over it. You'll be called a lot worse things before this decade is out.
@PattyMurray @lisamurkowski Sooo...what you're saying is what is already in place, right? Are you high?
@KamalaHarris I don't know about wealthy corporations, but those of us down here in middle America are doing pretty good. Thank you, Mr. President. Kamala! Shut your pie hole.
@GavinNewsom Gavin, you're right. You manufactured the worst catastrophe in California history by pronouncing it a sanctuary state. Not to mention the condition of San Francisco. You should rename the city to poop capital of the world.
@ElPasoInc @RepEscobar You know, I like Mexican food, but I'm betting that you and the rest of your Burrito eating intellectual friends are not going to be present when the President arrives. Go ahead and boycott. You won't be missed.
@IlhanMN Looks like Nancy Reamed you pretty well.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats The biggest vampire of all pontificating on the abuse of the working class. What a joke.
@realDonaldTrump THE MAN!!
@cenkuygur Well, they control a lot, but I doubt everything. They can't help it. They're smart, and most of all, chosen. I know you hate that, but its true. https://t.co/xrenxu2uv4
@WhipClyburn @RepJohnYarmuth Yeah, you care. When was the last time you thanked old white guys for your freedom?
@KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @cthagod @djenvy @angelayee By the way, smoking pot is the number one cause of psychotic mental illness and violence.
@lisamurkowski In other words, she's going to do what is already in place.
@RepEscobar And we need you to tell people that, of course, or they won't believe their news stations. Do you have to tell "El Pasoans when to eat and when to go to the bathroom too. After all, anybody who elected you would have to be told that, I imagine.
@ABC @JacksonLeeTX18 Was he the inventor of Dingell's Potato Chips? Oh! Oh! I'm sorry. That's Pringle's Potato Chips. Well, if he was such a wonderful guy, maybe they can come up with a jingle for Dingell.
@BobMooreNews @RepEscobar @AHouseElPaso @realDonaldTrump Of course there will be a different picture. The true picture of an unruly mob set on depleting our financial resources. Why don't you ask your wife to return what's left of your penis so you can start thinking clearly again. https://t.co/2X1HbgrUNM
@NydiaVelazquez What planet are you from?
@SenGillibrand Actually good won in 2016 when you women were screaming the loudest and being the nastiest.
@TheLAA @RepHankJohnson Now I remember! Johnson reminds me of the house servant in "Gone With The Wind" that Scarlet O'Hara gave her father's watch to.
@TheLAA @RepHankJohnson Look at that face. You can tell that man spent the better part of his Psychotic life smoking reefer. I bet he's got a couple of roaches and a clip in his pocket right now. This is the guy that warned that Guam would flip over in the ocean if too many people moved to one side.
@SpeakerPelosi In other words, you chewed her scrawny little Muslim butt all up.
@CoryBooker This is the problem in AME churches They let any fool speak to their people.
@MurrayCampaign Ten give up the money, girlfriend!
@SenSanders Well, Bernie. I must admit when you're right, your right. Pharma firms have been sticking to us for decades and I think they need to be encouraged to serve those who are ill with reasonably priced meds.
@PattyMurray Yeah, sure. That's really going to carry a lot of weight.
@business You're right. We should send you to Mars on a one-way mission to save earth.
I feel that it is only right to congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being the first surviving brain donor.
@KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU Kamala Harris will be the first Trans president of the United States.
@davidfrum Probably, "I'm not a traitorous leftist Transgender Democrat intent on destroying my country."
@ggreenwald @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @keithellison Islam is infiltrating our country right under our noses just like in the UK. Shame on us.
@JoeNBC @RepEscobar Why don't you stop trying to be so smart and get back to your duties as a Fluffer for NBC.
@realDonaldTrump Illegal aliens are really undocumented Democrats. And also dead people are all democrats. Didn't you know. My father voted republican all his life, but when he died, he became a Democrat.
@UNESCO How about a female stay-at-home mom, teacher, nurturer and keeper of family.
@SenSanders Actually, FDR is responsible for putting us into this entitlement mess in the first place.
@MarkHarrisNYC Oh! You're using a Judeo-Christian imperative (immoral) to call out the NRA. Are you a Christian? You must be really religious because if you're not then you're being hypocritical. Second Amendment supporters are the only ones that are keeping this country from total ruin.
@realDonaldTrump The democrats are so anal that you couldn't pull a pin out of their butt with a tractor.
@Vegalteno @BillClinton @HillaryClinton @Lin_Manuel @VAMNit @ltmphd You want to help Puerto Rico. Recall AOC and send somebody that really has some substance and brains. That woman is embarrassing you all.
@SenGillibrand You're the Hillary clone, and we all know what happened to her.
@RepJeffries This is why you're such a dummy. Weren't you at SOTU?
@ChrisMurphyCT Funny thing. We don't hear too much from your side on scandalous Virginia these days.
@SenSanders When the quality of education in America is number one on the world, then you can talk about a raise for teachers. American students are failures at college level because their elementary and high school experience was seriously poor. The raise should be a boot out the door.
@MichelleObama @ChelseaClinton @aliciakeys Gee, thanks Michael.

@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Chelsea must be running for president. "I will reach out to your office tomorrow?" When is this poor pitiful woman going to realize that the dynasty is over? https://t.co/HwiK3x4zRN
@SenGillibrand This actually means that no big groups are donating to her because they know she doesn't have a chance of a snowball in hell. So, she's sucking up to white trash and poor black folk.
@joielynxcomabig I think I have something like this on my dashboard.
News Flash!! In a bold attempt to enhance tourist outreach, the city of San Francisco is offering a one time deal to the first one thousand visitors to the city. Now for the low price of just $75, you can scoop and carry home a mass of fecal matter from a homeless man. Hurry! https://t.co/7pK5Pn942W
@KamalaHarris Who?
@enews @ChelseaClinton Looks like just another night on 42nd Street in New York City.
@edutopia This happens when teachers don't know what the heck they're doing. Anybody who trusts their kids to public education in this day and age has got to be a freaking moron. Get them out!! Save your children!!
You know folks...I just called Kirsten Gillibrand a political harlot, and I guess that goes for all her adulterous sisters on the hill. They're giving away the house so I imagine they're probably willing to give up everything else as well. https://t.co/9aZpRy9q1z
@SenGillibrand I mean, you're a political harlot anyway. You might as well go all the way.
@SenGillibrand You know I just thought of something. You liberal women want the Green New Deal. You want Medicare for all and now you want child care for all. Jiminy Cricket, girlfriend! You're giving America away for free. I'm surprised you aren't out there on the street giving booty away.
@SenGillibrand What we actually need is better parenting, not better child care.
@SenSanders You know Bernie--you drooling old fool--I just filed my income tax and I'm getting a hefty refund, thanks to President Trump. Personally, I don't care about the rich because they provide jobs in this country. As a matter of fact, the more money they keep, the more they're hiring.

Mac's Food Outlets throughout Arkansas, has a message on its circular. "Heaven has a wall, a gate and a strict immigration policy." So true. https://t.co/9s9BlDolmB
@RashidaTlaib So does that mean that if Muslims take over this country you're going to stop them from chopping the heads of gays, Jews and Christians?
@CoryBooker And of course you're an example of how to treat other people, aren't you Cory? You're the typical liberal huckster. You may be able to fool a lot of people who don't watch C-SPAN or the news, but you don't fool people who listen every time you open your fool mouth.
This is just a common Darwinian philosophy which communists identify with.
AOC advisor, Cornell law professor Robert Hockett corrected the Green New Deal platform by saying that "those unwilling to work" would not be supported. A little truth for a change. The next step would be admitting what leftists would do with the "unwilling." Firing squad maybe? https://t.co/FSggmTj61c
@SenGillibrand Everything you just said is really a transference of responsibility because that is exactly what Obama did. We are here today because of what that maniac did to our country during his presidency. So don't blame conservatives for that.
@RepJayapal @RepEscobar Your brand of equity and equality enslaved everybody else to mediocrity. Why don't you guys just come out and say you want a communist system where your enemies are paraded to a field and shot dead because they don't agree with you. I would have more respect for you then.
@RashidaTlaib Your statement that our immigration keeps immigrant children "caged" is false and irresponsible. Before criticizing our immigration system, at least be willing to accept that these people come here with a myriad of communicable respiratory diseases. Some fatal.
@RAICESTEXAS @ChelseaClinton Now I know we have to put up a wall.
@SenSchumer Yeah, Chuckie! You really look like you love that little Chinese kid. You're holding him like he's a Typhoid carrier or something.
I'm sick of these Climate Change doomsday people. According to Al Gore we should be living in Water World by now. https://t.co/LlGoOtGoJ0
@jimtec145 @ThisWeekABC You climate change types think that the World will follow if America sets an example. Let me clue you in to reality, friend. The world doesn't give a crap about climate change. They say they do for the money, but they don't enforce it. Look at China and South America.
@jimtec145 @ThisWeekABC Before Ocasio's vision ever takes place in this country, I promise you that there will be a lot of blood running into the gutters. I've seen it in a very personal way in my own country. Americans will not put up with the oppressive enforcement of any political agenda
@jimtec145 @ThisWeekABC I've lived in a socialist collectivist society, Sir, it is incapable of sustaining itself indefinitely. It only works until you run out of other people's money.
@EllenPage LGBTQ has never had more acceptance in America than they do right now, and yet, the trans folks have the highest percentage of suicide. The problem is not political or social. The problem is personal, psychological and moral. I think these folks just feel shame.
@RepJayapal @RashidaTlaib These freeloaders are always victims, but they don't tell you that they're the victims of their own laziness and stupidity.
@SenGillibrand @AOC @SenMarkey You'll lend some support to it, but you won't put your face on it like this infant New-Yo-Rican. When she crashes and burns on this deal, you'll just crawl back under your rock and it will be business as usual for you with plausible deniability.
@RepAdamSchiff You're too stupid to be in charge of this. Who's the real culprit?
@ThisWeekABC This woman watched The Wizard of OZ one too many times.
The mainstream media that backed Fidel Castro in the 1950's is now residing in Miami, Florida. Where will the America mainstream media go when the crap hits the fan in the United States? Something to think about. https://t.co/JsbXYyzfhP
@SenSanders Its ironic that when you talk about Climate Change, America must take the lead and pay the most while Red China is leading the way in pollutants. Why don't you go over there and launch a protest, and see what happens to you, you old fart.
@SenSanders Actually Bernie, what we need is fathers who support their families, mothers who stay home and nurture their children, teachers that teach nothing but the basics, and a government that stays out of our lives. This natural system pays for itself.
@AndrewOReilly84 You're right that we have a form of Socialism in America (entitlements), but leftist liberals know what THEY mean when they speak SOCIALISM and I know what they mean. Why don't you ask somebody who has lived under Castro. We'll define it for you correctly.
@AOC @IlhanMN You can't be serious? Intellectually bankrupt? If ANYBODY engaged you in a debate, sweetheart, you'd have to leave town because of the shame. If you're the best Puerto Rico has to offer, your constituents are looking like a bunch of fools right now.
@RashidaTlaib Its funny when you say that we should learn how to treat women. Why don't you show pictures of how Muslims treat women in the Middle East? People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, bugwit.
@RepEscobar @RashidaTlaib @LeaderHoyer @RepTorresSmall @RepDebHaaland @RepMGS Someone once said, "Before you take down a fence make sure you know why it was put there in the first place." Border jumpers don't respect our laws. Why should we allow then in? You liberals are better at smelling out rotten eggs than you are at laying good ones.
@SenSanders Listen Bernie. You're probably going to be incontinent before you have a chance to run for president. According to San Francisco's mayor, it wouldn't look very good for you to hire somebody to follow you around. Why don't you just quit while you're ahead.
@HardballChris @SimonBooks @simonschuster @hardball Don't forget Marilyn Monroe.
@KamalaHarris I think you should start this movement in Red China. They can't drink the water in the Yellow River anymore and buildings in Beijing have to be air tight to protect workers from the polluted air. Everybody wears masks to and from work. America by comparison is a paradise.
@AMartinez31 @RepEscobar The irony of this is that they have to drag an old white guy around to bring legitimacy to their cause.
@CoryBooker Thousands? Thousands? I see you've been taking those hallucinogens I mentioned the other day.
@TheEllenShow @TheKalenAllen Isn't this racist. Paring black people with fried chicken? Who are you going to feature next week? Sheila Jackson Lee and her watermelon recipe?
@MurrayCampaign Oh, you mean like Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch? Of course, they weren't beholden to their loyalty to President Obama. They were so, so impartial. (Raspberry!)

@RepAlGreen You know, you should get rid of that beard. You look too much like one of those Frank Lucas kind of guys.
@RepJeffries You asked Whitaker, "Who are you, where did you come from and how did you become the head of the Justice Department?" Well, HAKEEM, we could ask you the same question, except for the last part. I would ask you, how did you become the "step and fetch it for Pelosi.
@RepJeffries I must be naïve or something. I really don't understand your relationship with your white colleagues in Washington. Its obvious that you hate white people, but you're a butt kisser when it comes to what they can do for you in the house. So which is it?

@RepEscobar Borders are simply about national sovereignty. We won't have sovereignty if we have no border protection. We spend almost 200 billion a year taking care of the illegals we already have and you guys are whining about five or six billion for a wall? Give me a break.
@RashidaTlaib The Michigan Gala! What is that? A gathering of America haters?
@PattyMurray You hope that republicans will work with you on good faith? What the heck do you leftists democrats know about good faith? What a joke you all are.
@SenWarren Now that you've given up on your alleged Native American heritage, what are you going to run on for president? Your Bipolar disorder?
@JacksonLeeTX18 You really shouldn't get upset that Acting Attorney General Whitaker was laughing. Considering the cast of clowns asking the questions, you really can't blame the guy.
@CoryBooker So Cory...you're finally hitting the campaign trail. Make sure you take plenty of hallucinogens with you. You're going to need those imaginary crowds to pump your numbers up in your own mind. https://t.co/lnFagotAQO
@RepEscobar I watched you questioning Interim Attorney General Whitaker. I like the way you used the media with your opening statement. You really milked that for all it was worth. This wasn't about Whitaker or how he's running the Justice Department. This is about you.
@RashidaTlaib You named a lot of Phobias you have to fight. What about Arachnophobia. I think it's pretty important. People in this country are being paralyzed by Arachnophobia every day and I think our government should deal with this tragedy before all the other phobias.
@AOC I want to congratulate you on your election victory. You completely disprove the notion of white privilege or that people devoid of intellect can make it in government.
These are before and after pictures of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez' electric shock treatments. Her EEG revealed still showed no signs of significant brain activity. https://t.co/fRZmV2Gw90
@PattyMurray I saw the same tweet coming from Elizabeth Warren's page. Is there a form letter going around to Democrats, and if there is, who is the brain behind the Borg collective. Resistance is futile!
Today, Sheila Jackson Lee was not too happy with Acting Attorney General Whitaker's humor. Well, considering the cast of circus clowns asking the question, I don't fault Mr. Whitaker in the least.
