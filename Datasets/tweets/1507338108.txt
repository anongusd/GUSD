9. Allowed himself to be calmed down by a Black person in authority with whom he insists he is friends. It was stunning. Sickening. Mind-blowing.
8. Demanded that the well-founded accusation of racism be “stricken from the record” or otherwise retracted.
4. Expressed outrage when a person of color called out the inherent racism of 1-3. 5. Accused the person calling out racism of being racist. 6. Confessed publicly that he has relatives who are “people of color.” 7. Became loud &amp; tearful at the outrage of being accused of racism.
2. Used “he’s never said anything racist to me” as proof a white person could not be racist. 3. Asked forcefully “do you have proof” of witness who just recounted racist statements he personally heard.
It’s morning &amp; I still can’t believe that Rep. Mark Meadows ran the full playbook of most insulting racism defenses. 1. Used the “Black friend” defense as proof a white person could not be racist. Actually physically presented the Black friend (which is unusual).

Channelling Ms. Patton, @RepMarkMeadows explains that she (Patton) says she would never work for a racist. Meadows, who is white, says he has talked w/Trump in private &amp; Trump has never said a racist word to him. So how can Cohen say that Trump is racist, he asks? This happened.
This is THE most embarrassing, absurd display on race.

#SpikeLee was making extraordinary films exploring &amp; exposing racism in our country when the President was calling for the execution of African American teenagers who were wrongly accused of a crime they didn’t commit.
Many will shrug at the President’s twitter attack. But when leaders publicly attack artists we should not take it lightly. And when Trump projects his own racism on to an artist who has devoted his career to addressing the truth abt racism we shld take it seriously.
#SpikeLee’s speech was not racist. It was factual, heartfelt and inspiring. He lifted up his deceased mother, reminded us of this nation’s violent past and called on us to “make the moral choice between love and hate.” Here’s the transcript: https://t.co/M4NdCgZIaY
The President’s attack on Oscar winner #SpikeLee is despicable. We should not become numb to spectacle and menace of the leader of our country making public attacks on private citizens, especially when based on deliberately false accusations &amp; racism.

The inside cover of #JeanFairfax’s report on white resistance to busing reproduced the Washington Post interview with the white mother in Richmond  whose words became the name of our report. https://t.co/kDs7ZyfFGJ
One of the most hard-hitting was “It’s Not the Distance, It’s The Niggers,” - the words of a white mother who opposed busing her child to integrated schools in Richmond. The decision to name the report after these raw words broke through myths about why whites resisted busing. https://t.co/I8Bcu0kbEZ

It threatens the integrity and legitimacy of the federal bench when the process is distorted in this way. The "glacial pace of confirmations" is now just a talking point for Republicans who obstructed Obama's appts and who now shamelessly are running the tables w/Trump nominees.
Nominees have been moved through the process despite having provided misleading or false information on their questionnaires (which they complete under penalty of perjury), omitting key information, or even being found "unqualified" by the non-partisan American Bar Association.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has been ramming through judicial nominees at an unprecedented pace.

If you know all the details of the #JussieSmollet incident, but don’t know the facts of even one of the over 7,000 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2017 (some of which were murders), it’s a problem.
Hate crimes not only harm victims, they tear at the fabric of our country &amp; instill fear in our communities. False reports can provide cover for those who want us to turn away from the urgent need to fight against hate crimes.
So I will continue to speak out against hate crimes (which are rising at such an alarming rate) and to demand that the Attorney General, and local law enforcement create real plans to combat and address hate crimes. Victims should be encouraged to come forward -especially now.
False reports of other kinds of crime are also not unheard of. If a bank reports a robbery and it turns out to be an inside job, we don’t stop believing that banks are robbed. If this incident makes you disbelieve hate crimes perhaps you were inclined to disbelieve in them.
There are also those who will use one incident to disbelieve hate crime victims. I reject that out of hand. There were over 7,000 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2017 - a thousand more than in 2016. Black ppl are disproportionately the victims.
But when the evidence ends in a false reporting charge it is profoundly damaging. There are scores of unsolved violent crimes in Chicago that require &amp; merit the attention of the CPD. The diversion of their resources to investigate false reports harms victims &amp; communities.
The charging and arrest of #JussieSmollet is devastating on so many levels. I still believe that hate crime victims should be believed and treated as victims until the evidence proves otherwise.

@KATVJason @GavinMcCollum Is this what we’re saying now? That we should not describe an attack or a victim of a crime - any crime even when law enforcement calls the person a victim?

@wardaallen @The_Africanus We condemn the perpetrators of reported crimes every day. As an investigation unfolds we may learn more. But I have no embarrassment abt believing the victim of a reported hate crime. And I have insisted that we shld let the CPD investigate &amp; not follow leaks &amp; unnamed sources.
@wardaallen @The_Africanus So the next time someone says they were robbed or they were beaten by the police we shld disbelieve them?That’s not the way the system works, which is why the police have consistently referred to him as a victim.Until evidence proves otherwise every victim is treated as a victim.

I take this seriously because we have been demanding since 2017 that the Atty General (first Sessions, now the Acting &amp; Barr, if confirmed) articulate a clear plan to address this issue. To date - nothing concrete. This means that local jurisdictions/law enforcement must step up.
That means that we need to let the Chicago PD do the job of investigating this crime. The words of the Superintendent of Police have been clear: #JussieSmollett is the victim. Mr. Smollett's been fully cooperative. The rest is just noise.
In other words, this is serious. To their credit the NYPD systematically located &amp; arrested the "Proud Boys" involved in last fall's melee. https://t.co/eCdmrVQl7o We expect no less from the Chicago PD in the #Smollett attack. And we need to stand firm in demanding it.
In January a white supremacist plead guilty to traveling from Baltimore to NY in 2017 for the express purpose of killing a Black man. He killed 66 year-old Timothy Caughman with a sword on the streets of mid-town Manhattan. https://t.co/xc0ilX6Jol
And is should surprise no one that this happened in Chicago. Last fall, members of the "Proud Boys" went on a rampage on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. https://t.co/76Fk9VIUjH They also yelled homophobic slurs. We have to decide what kind of country we want.
Hate crimes are a serious matter. At this moment in our country they are increasing at an alarming rate. Despite this, there is still no comprehensive plan from the DOJ. The attack on #JussieSmollett should not be the subject of jokes, misleading statements or speculation.
Some of us also remember him as the bearer of the news 10 years ago that going forward the names of ofcrs who used their weapons against civilians would only be released at the discretion of the-then Commr. @AoDespair wrote powerfully abt this at the time https://t.co/L7dKAxEbjC
Second the early misleading statements from the PD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi caught the attention of those of us who’ve done work in #Baltimore. Guglielmi was *reassigned* as the spokesman for the #Baltimore PD because of inappropriate remarks abt levels of violent crime.
We’re closely watching the Chicago PD’s investigation because first, just last week the Dept was locked into a consent decree by a federal judge to address years of misconduct. The Dept’s handling of the #Smollett attack is an early test for the agency.
This is serious and a critical civil rights issue. Black people are 13% of the U.S. population, but nearly half of all hate crime victims are Black. Anti-LGBT hate crimes are on the rise as well. https://t.co/jgUKWt1P8q
At this point it's clear that there's a deliberate effort to try and undermine the credibility of #JussieSmollett  - who was the victim of a horrible hate crime in Chicago. This is precisely why people don't report hate crimes. Since 2017 hate crimes have risen nearly 20%.

This entire segment on criminal justice reform was carefully written to tee up Trump's "dangerous southern border" screed - which is the focus and heart of this address. So cynical. https://t.co/WVsDSHDzqR
Well I'm fascinated by this line in which the President explicitly refers to sentencing practices that disproportionately harm African Americans.
W/o adequate public transportation, low wage African American workers spend hours in transit to and from work. Housing costs are beyond exorbitant and beyond the reach of many families. It is insanity to applaud this "low unemployment" rate as evidence of success.
Let's deal with the low African American unemployment rate. These jobs are most often low wage jobs, w/o health insurance. Many are not full-time. Workers struggle to "get hours" and many more must have multiple jobs to provide for their families.
Are Members of Congress giving multiple standing ovations as the President reads words he neither wrote nor believes? Words of unity and reconciliation? It is not civil to applaud such flagrant hypocrisy and cynicism.

His AG even tried to scuttle a consemt decree entered into by the State of IL &amp; the Chicago PD after that PD was sued by the state for unconstitutional policing. Just last week, a federal judge approved the consent decree (and ignored the Trump Admin’s attempted interference).
Trump did not “take care if that.” Instead he celebrated rough treatment by police (“don’t be too nice”), allowed his DOJ to abandon investigations of systemic police brutality and misconduct, and pardoned a law enforcement ofcr (Sheriff Arpaio)engaged in racist, illegal conduct.
Let’s be very clear, “taking a knee” is a protest against police killing of unarmed African Americans. Nothing in the recently passed #FirstStepAct says a word abt this. In fact the Trump Admin. decided that DOJ will no longer investigate unconstitutional policing practices. https://t.co/uV5lGJ4arU

This should be a debate question for every presidential candidate: “if you are elected will you commit right now to read and study the briefing books on policy, law &amp; other critical subject matter provided by your advisors.” The bar is that low.
President Obama reportedly read in detail, wrote questions &amp; observations in the margins, asked for addl info. Like an intelligent person who takes seriously making decisions that will impact millions of ppl. “Bush didn’t like to read the book.” “Trump likes pictures.” Come. On.
Sad, but important to say things like, “the President has to read the briefing book.” First G.W. Bush, now Trump. The idea that the “briefing” book is too much, drives me crazy. It’s not even the whole report. It’s a briefing, for heaven’s sake. Read &amp; study it. #HarrisTownHall

Great piece refuting the charge that Stone’s arrest was “heavy-handed.” This is the man folks are allowing to do softball TV interviews. Thank goodness Mueller is clear about the rule of law.  https://t.co/xtVWn9LGuQ https://t.co/Qxo6HdXYW9
Exactly. https://t.co/4Z41g1KuPZ
It is also a challenge to those at the highest levels of our profession, many of whom built their early careers prosecuting Black &amp; Brown people in a fundamentally unjust system, &amp; who now stand silent as the rule of law is mocked at the highest levels by those entrusted to lead.
What we are seeing today at the highest levels is a powerful indictment of our criminal justice system - a stark expose’ of what law and order really means in America.
At every stage of interaction w /the criminal justice system, the inferences work against Black people, who are pulled over, searched, arrested, strip searched, shackled, paraded in the orange jumpsuit, and held in jails in numbers disproportionate to every other demographic.
Over 100,000 people are locked up in pre-trial detention (not convicted) in local jails in our country for drug charges on any given day. Over 200,000 for other non violent charges. Many will remain in jail for the crime of being too poor to make bail.
Sandra Bland was pulled over for failing to signal, menaced and arrested for talking back to an ofcr. She died in jail. Freddy Gray ran from police ofcrs. He was arrested &amp; his back was broken while riding in the back of a police van.
Everyday  Black ppl are threatened w/arrest, arrested &amp; convicted for crimes large &amp; small. The ofcr who killed Tamir Rice &amp; his partner cuffed Rice’s distraught 14 year old sister &amp; put her in the police car. Threatened to do the same to Rice’s mom if she didn’t stop screaming.
The President publicly taunts witnesses to criminal investigations , encourages investigation of the family of witnesses, denigrates specific federal judges, taunts, hounds &amp; threatens to fire the Attorney General, fires the head of the FBI for investigating him.
Cabinet secretaries lie to or mislead Congress and refuse to appear for oversight hearings. Judicial nominees are not truthful on their questionnaires (under penalty of perjury), mislead Congress in live testimony w/o consequence.
Roger Stone walks out of court arms raised despite federal indictments. Manafort is spared the indignity of wearing the orange jumpsuit to court despite being convicted. Sheriff Arpaio is granted a pardon by the Pres for crimes that degrade the very concept of law enforcement.

Don't let the day end without watching this powerful video of reflections from Dr. King's colleagues &amp; closest friends produced by the Gandhi King Institute for Nonviolent Social Justice. 	Traveling With Dr. King https://t.co/KIrVlDBCzh via @YouTube
Last week I joined @davidaxelrod in a conversation or his brilliant podcast The Axe Files. Of course we talked abt #MLK and what gives me hope in this challenging time. I talked about my fmr. law students, @NAACP_LDF 's dedicated young attys, &amp; running my part of the relay race. https://t.co/jgGjpckN00
Last week I watched #KingInTheWilderness and it cut so deeply. Powerful presentation of King's efforts in Chicago and Cicero, IL - met with unimaginable racist vitriol. And King's struggle to find his way, to never give up on this country. His weariness &amp; his determination.
The practice of trying to convince ppl that what we see is not real on videos showing racial assault or violence has only become more brazen since they tried to convince us that "Rodney King was the one in control of the situation." So I'm not alarmed by the latest effort.

Barr's confirmation should not be regarded as fait accompli. If you supported the Criminal Justice Reform bill, then you should have serious problems with the idea of Bill Barr as Attorney General. He must be rigorously examined by the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/Lio9rSHJOu

THREAD. So let's dispense with the idea that the Barr hearings this week should be anything other than rigorous and thorough. And these issues must be fully examined before we get to the critical, very serious issues on civil rights enforcement. #BarrHearings https://t.co/acfHQjpz2I

@nhannahjones @HotlineJosh I am also waiting. When you introduce the reliably divisive “strict quotas” trope into an observation about the failure to include African Americans on a reporting team for 2020, you should  take responsibility for explaining exactly how you drew this from @AOC’s observation.
I await the action that will be taken against this House member - since 2003 - whose has a history of white supremacist statements and associations that has been condoned by his colleagues. It is clear that @SenatorTimScott has jolted the Republican leadership out of its silence. https://t.co/5G6uMRHyNO
House Judiciary Committee Chair ⁦@JerryNadler⁩ should not relent in his effort to compel the testimony of Acting AG Whitaker this month. It is imperative that Whitaker testify under oath about the activities of the DOJ since Nov. https://t.co/qhrNgIvkyh
And this is why Acting AG Whitaker must appear before the House Judiciary Committee. Do not let the Barr confirmation hearings distract from the importance of hearing from Whitaker who has had charge of the DOJ since November. https://t.co/YRzhLDuMaY

In Obduskey v. McCarthy &amp; Holthus, SCOTUS will decide whether the protections of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) covers nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings. These proceedings (w/o a court or judge) result in foreclosure more often than court proceedings.
IMPORTANT: "Between 2005 and 2009...2/3 of median household wealth [in communities of color] was wiped out" by the foreclosure crisis. On Mon. SCOTUS will hear argument in a case that could result in an increase in foreclosures w/devastating effect on African American homeowners.

Finally, we haven’t even begun to dig into the report’s conclusion that Facebook (and Instagram ?) underplayed the extent of the targeting of African American voters when they testified before Congress.
My thread today on Russian voter suppression efforts targeting Black voters. Very troubled by the “nothing to see here” take of some commentators. https://t.co/NHgqrltBQ3
We really need analysis that doesn’t analyze this only through the lens of the effect on candidates (Hillary, Bernie, Trump), but also focuses on the ordinary voters and activists who the Russian operatives attempted to manipulate and who may have been endangered.
And finally there’s the real threat to indivs and movements as the Russians sowed discord online, targeting activists in Ferguson and Baltimore, and adopting “Blue Lives Matter” rhetoric. Creating rallies in NY &amp; FL sponsored by fake Muslim groups.
Thankfully the Special Counsel is handling the latter. At least for 2016 (see paragraph 46 of the Mueller IRA indictment). But what of 2020? And what if there is coordination betweeen domestic &amp; foreign voter suppression efforts? It’s serious &amp; should not be minimized.
If a white candidate or group organizes robocalls that tell Black voters not to vote on Tues but vote on Wed, or if Russian operatives pose as Black activists &amp; encourage Black ppl not to vote, it’s unacceptable &amp; an illegal voter suppression effort. But I’m ready for the former.
But we fight against voter suppression every day in the courts and on the ground. We do so on behalf of Black voters - not candidates or political parties. And we do so to ensure &amp; promote the ability of every eligible voter to vote.
It’s astonishing to see entire takes that minimize voter suppression efforts by Russians on social media aimed at suppressing the Black vote b/c the Russians were only exploiting racism that already exists. I have repeatedly said that racism is a natl security vulnerability.
The fact that every candidate running for President in 2016 had - to varying degrees - problems on race that could be exploited goes w/o saying.That’s our ongoing and real problem that Black voters have to, can and do confront in every election.
Hundreds of thousands of people following a Russian operative posing as a Black activist to influence Black voters is also deeply problematic and dangerous.
Interesting to see the suggestion that Russia targeting African American voters only matters if it affected the outcome of the election. Voter suppression efforts are illegal whether or not they are successful.

@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry It did cause offense Shavar. It did.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Shavar do you know what magical thinking is? My remark is about OUR magical thinking rather than engaging in pragmatic thinking. Are you kidding? This is silly. You know where I work every day if you want to engage on this further.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Again this is why I don’t enter these debates. They invariably descend into this. I have my theories about why. It’s very revealing. But I have neither the time nor inclination to engage at this level.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry It’s very easy to understand if you want to and if you are prepared to extend to me what I deserve and what I extended to you - an acknowledgment that we come from a place of love, respect &amp; concern for Black families.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry I was often overcome by it myself and I had all the resources available to me. I repected you by acknowledging your good will in this. I’m disappointed in your silly remark about my opinion of Black parents.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry What I won’t do is traffic in magical thinking about what it takes parents - often single parents working several low wage jobs in a city like Baltimore - tmake the “choices” you describe.
@shavarjeffries @nhannahjones @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Shavar, I don’t have “a low opinion of the capacity of Black parents.” That’s a pretty awful charge to make. What I have is respect for Black parents who we ask to navigate a system that not even you can guarantee will present quality choices for them.
@nhannahjones @citizenstewart @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Parents understand the dangers of the streets of #Baltimore and they first and foremost want their kids close.
@nhannahjones @citizenstewart @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Yes. To pretend that parents living in West Baltimore have the “choice” to send their kids to a strong charter in East Baltimore on public transportation is a fantasy. We fought for the Red Line b/c lack of rapid transit mobility inhibits even where parents take jobs in the city.
@citizenstewart @nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Some will and do. Many more will not. It’s not infantilizing. It’s respecting the pressure of the lives of responsible people living in poverty navigating a million systems designed to keep them in place.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Many more will not be able to choose or navigate available choices or be consigned to poor performing charters where discipline masks ineffectiveness. It’s a disgrace that we are left to wrangle this b/c of the lack of will post-Brown to invest in public education.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry ...we’re starting from two very distant poles. But I will continue to put my energy toward working on the provision of quality integrated, properly resourced public education. I see no future for all of our children in privatization and charters. Some will benefit to be sure.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry I don’t enter these charter debates b/c I believe in the good will of those determined to find quality educational opportunities for as many of our kuds as possible in real time. And unless you share the view that public education is an essential public good in a democracy...
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry They also would never have been able to accept a system that took one or two if their kids and not all. We needed to ride the bus together, walk home together, etc. There would be no “choice” for them in access to good schools for less than all of their children.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry I’m sure w/time, counseling &amp; support my parents could have made good choices for their 10 children in a charter system. They had none of those. Fortunately they raised their kids in the brief period of quality, integrated public schools in NYC.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry Access to this good should not be dependent on the time, smarts or moxie of parents. This good also shld be available to Black disabled students, Black students with learning disabilities &amp; Black students who need ESL support, most of whom cannot access the “successful” charters.
@nhannahjones @shavarjeffries @Russian_Starr @rolandsmartin @Ninacharters @charteralliance @HowardLFuller @DrStevePerry How on earth can we pretend that poor Black parents have the time, where with all and resources to “choose” or that the choices available to them are adequate? There are basic public goods necessary for citizenship and success in a democratic society - education is one of them.

Voter suppression laws and practices are the most pernicious of these anti-democratic efforts. Every one of these assaults on our democracy should be resisted, challenged and defeated by those who hold democratic values.
When you lose, it’s someone else’s turn. But what we’re seeing now increasingly is an effort to rig the game to ensure that one side never loses. The permanent gerrymander is a key feature. As was holding hostage a SCOTUS seat until the Republicans came back to power.
As much as Trump’s excesses these actions are direct assaults on our democracy, which at its core contemplates power sharing. The transfer of power after an election is a key feature in the game of politics and every game we played as children. https://t.co/iR2xvfLQGQ

Likewise the college experience of those of us who entered elite colleges that were so culturally unfamiliar to us (Michelle’s priceless response to someone saying they “rowed crew”). I never heard the term “WASP” before arriving at Vassar. We had to learn to navigate the new.
I was particularly moved by @michelleobama’s honest &amp; sensitive observations abt her extended &amp; connected family of grandparents great aunts, uncles who are part of her world. Each in their own way navigating the reality of the limitations imposed on them by racial inequality.
We were cildren who saw struggle and promise as embedded in daily life. And it shaped our bone deep sense of what might be possible in this country tempered by strong and unshakeable pragmatism about the existence of barriers.
Not enough has been written about the lives of Black girls and boys like Michelle (and me) - children of working class parents striving in big cities during this brief period of promise - in the decade and a half after the passage of the major civil rts statutes.
I know that many readers will open @MichelleObama ‘s #Becoming to read about her time on the campaign &amp; in the White House. But the part to which I was most drawn was the first part about her growing up on the Southside of Chicago w her family.

And stop saying it’s “a distraction.”	I focus on the substantive work of civil rights every day. We can spare a moment to speak unequivocally against this conduct. In fact the degrading of our discourse &amp; the normalization of personal insult is also a danger to our democracy. /13
There are so many serious issues we must confront in the coming days. But we cannot let this pass as business as usual.  I salute @abbydphillip &amp; @Yamiche @AprilDRyan @RepMaxineWaters  They are class acts. But they deserve to hear a chorus of condemnation of these attacks. /12
The President of the United Stated speaks in our name and as leader of this country. It matters how he talks to and about us. What we heard this wk cannot be tolerated without us lifting our voices to say #EnoughIsEnough.  10/
It is not the same as being called “sleepy eyes” or “wacky”. It is part of a very specific history of denigration. And it subjects these women to threats of violence by unstable elements among the President’s followers. /9
It is not a badge of honor. It reminds us of the things our mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers were called. And perhaps they had to take it so we would not be subjected to this. But it’s happening. Right now. In front of the world.  It is sickening. 8/
And I’ll say what Abby and Yamiche and April and maybe even Maxine (nope, not Maxine) won’t say: it’s wounding. When the President of the United States insults you in this disgusting way on your job in front of your colleagues it is wounding &amp; infuriating. 7/
This is the President of the United States. To point his finger in the face of a young Black woman who asked the question on everyone’s mind about Whitaker’s hiring and speak in that way is beyond acceptable.  6/
Trump is not the first to publicly insult Black women for political gain. Calling us “welfare queens” or “quota queens” was low hanging fruit for cynical political operatives.But this is different. 5/
It comes months after he called one of his senior advisors and the only African American senior staffer in the White House  @OMAROSA a “dog.”
It comes months after he has repeatedly derided the intelligence of African American senior congresswoman @RepMaxineWaters. 3/
This latest vile and awful attack comes just days after his attack on @Yamiche.  It came with the one-two punch of yet another insult of veteran journalist @AprilDRyan. 2/
Listen I hope I can say this calmly and clearly. Trump’s insult of journalist @abbydphillip goes too far.  And I will not accept the “weary with outrage” that is supposed to excuse the failure to stand up and refuse to accept this racist treatment of a professional doing her job.

Even during the terrible Bush II years the DOJ rejected discriminatory changes. Third, even where DOJ didn't reject discriminatory voting changes, preclearance meant that civil rts attys like @NAACP_LDF learned abt changes before they happened &amp; could file litigation early. 2/

@Serps That said, the DOJ is still a party to the decree and can be aggressive or not in advocating to the court about enforcement of monitoring and compliance targets.

This is a very good move, long overdue. https://t.co/UkB8cVuddS
@_justinlevitt_ No it won't create trials. He knows this. The point of the consent decree is that a trial is not in the best interest of either party. They're expensive, require time &amp; staff resources. So many cases won't be brought &amp; state/local unconstitutional conduct will go unchecked.
The idea that unconstitutional conduct by a state or local entity is no longer sufficient basis to enter into a consent decree is extraordinary. Instead Sessions mandates that the following conditions must be present: https://t.co/CBDlw8AhWB
So now, having read the memo, it's clear Sessions has had this in the works. It's very thorough. And alarming. And it's not limited to consent decree in cases of unconstitutional policing. DOJ also engages in consent decrees w/state &amp; local govts in education &amp;, housing cases. https://t.co/0c7rvoNzSh
@KZimmermanOsf Agree. The idea that he is rumpled and familiar doesn't, I think, give him the credit he deserves. Although @AlecMacGillis correctly points out that Sherrod Brown understands the importance of being attentive to the concerns of voters in small towns.
@WilDonnelly I disagree. In my view it is also a constitutional crisis when one branch of govt abuses its constitutional authority, and the branch of govt empowered under the Constitution to check that abuse refuses to act. In my view, we've been here for awhile.

What are you talking about? Have you read the 14th Amendment? Birthright citizenship is not a "policy." It is a constitutional guarantee very deliberately created by the framers of the 14th amendment and ratified by the states. https://t.co/x7v7dLQ47H

You do.That he can he say this is appalling b/c a President has an array of advisors and should have access to the best legal minds. That this is the level of his counsel speaks volumes. Even birthright citizenship opponents think ending it requires at least an act of Congress. https://t.co/ypeZviKx5g
Can’t ignore it. It’s a trifecta of despotism: 1)Trump thinks that he can undo an explicit constitutional guarantee by Exec. Order; 2)the guarantee is the provision of the 14th amend that ensured citizenship for Black ppl; 3) The intent is to discriminate against Latino ppl. https://t.co/2poyeTslgK

Not longing for Reagan. Pointing out that it wasn't a partisan thing to behave decently at moments of national tragedy. What we're seeing is so indecent. "He's doing what he promised," is a silly enough excuse for Trump's excesses, but it doesn't begin to explain yesterday. https://t.co/fAJC9cxgSL

Dr. Maguire worked closely with Dr. King on writing King’s extraordinary anti-Vietnam War speech in 1967.
