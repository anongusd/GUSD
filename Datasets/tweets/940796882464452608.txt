@CarolinaFroggg @Corsair9605 @theblaze Calm down there, you're sounding like one of those "TDS" people you guys hate or something.		I guess both sides aren't so different after all, eh? üßê
@Corsair9605 @theblaze Did I miss some sort of bombshell warranting impeachment of this random member of congress, oh wise @Corsair9605?  ü§î
@jakeaporter @MattWalshBlog *checks account stats*		The extra prominence came in droves, I'm sure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@DreamcastGuy You and @ShawnLong85, same energy.
@DreamcastGuy I wonder what game comes out next week that has @DreamcastGuy hyped...ü§î		Clearly it's R.B.I. Baseball 19!

@ZachAdvanced https://t.co/xH3yELbKj7
@Martintoney2012 @DreamcastGuy Exactly, and that's what I (and many others on Twitter, it seems, given the positive reception) wanted - an upscaled Gen 7 with a bit of LGPE graphical style thrown in. 	No need to change something that isn't broken.
@Martintoney2012 @DreamcastGuy At this point I guess all we can do is agree to disagree, man, because I don't see things that way at all. An open world Pokemon (main series) game would likely be disastrous IMO.
@Martintoney2012 @DreamcastGuy I mean people complained when tons of things changed in LGPE, and now people complain when they aren't changing anything as well. Seems you just can't please everyone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@TomFawkes Those were how I first learned about your channel, to be fair.
@Martintoney2012 @DreamcastGuy And that's why I love it. üëç
@papouchiha @NinEverything And that's why I'm happy. If it ain't broke, don't fix it (most of Twitter's reaction is positive, so I assume they have a similar view to mine)
@RealMamaEagle Anyone who hates Sobble will have to fight me irl. 		Also, game looks like exactly what I wanted. üòé

@RealMamaEagle I fully expect Gen 8 to produce a bunch of whiners/boycotts just like LGPE regardless of what it is...only for it to sell massively again.
@RealMamaEagle Well yes I would hope it looks better than LPGE, now that they've had an extra year to work on the engine. I just want its good ideas to make it over (overworld wild pokes, sense of scale, riding on Snorlax, etc).
@RealMamaEagle No I think you're misunderstanding - I want the upcoming Gen 8 to resemble Gen 7's general playstyle, which I thought was great, just upscaling it. 		Also I don't mean the trials (which were weird), just want how it looked/controlled.
@Dimantro1 @IntroSpecktive Pokemon Quest 2!		(I wouldn't even be mad tbh)
@RealMamaEagle I just want an upscaled Sun/Moon with some of the new elements from LGPE thrown in (a game people hate on wayyy too much). I think that's a reasonable request.
@AuroriousAKARob @Tyren_X @MightyKeef @EVO I would've loved to see UMvC3 make the cut this year, but I guess this Evo is current-gen games only. 		Speaking of which, do any of you guys know what "Samurai Showdown" is? I've never heard of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@RealMamaEagle Let us not forget that GameFreak is making their "Town" game at the same time too, also slated for a 2019 release.
@JazzyJPrime @LiquidSalem Sounds about par for the course these days in the Smash community tbh.
@Tyren_X @MightyKeef @EVO Literal proof there is a God tbh.
@the_yoeman And what, pray tell, is Twitter monopolizing? Certainly not social media.		Also, it's not a public utility, so your argument is already collapsing upon itself.  No need for me to insult you when you're doing a better job at it than I ever could.
@the_yoeman I just checked, couldn't find anything about Twitter being the government. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@AP4Liberty @AOC Imagine losing 2 elections in 2 years.		Not one to throw stones there, eh @AP4Liberty?
@vianafelippe @PAXperMortem @SerebiiNet I also think LGPE is just a spinoff to tide everyone over. But the new games better allow me to do this again https://t.co/xse2IscOIF

@TrumpsArmy @JackPosobiec That's a little too clever for @JackPosobiec.
@TomToth3 One of the few things both sides can agree on üëç
@AaronShambeau @Cernovich Could not disagree more. If you don't follow the ToS of a private website (i.e. making fake accounts), 100% fair to kick you out.		I assume you'd let me do what I want in your home?
@LadyAce127 Oh boo hoo, the big bad libs were mean to you. That's not against Twitter's ToS, so good luck with that.
@LadyAce127 Once you find them making fake accounts, sure.
@the_yoeman ???		Is this what you guys are telling yourselves, ignoring his ban was for maintaining multiple fake accounts?	Also lol you clearly need to re-read the first amendment if you think it has any power here.
@kotstot1 @itsJeffTiedrich You give him too much credit.
@NVoluntaryist He was banned for making fake accounts, not his views.
@ItsMeZachariah Had no idea I had a blue check mark (or that checkmarks were still blue?)
@justinhastings2 Yeah, owned himself, lel
@barndingus All I want is an upscaled Sun/Moon with some LGPE style thrown in, as well as bringing the good new features it had (overworld wild Pokemon, sense of scale, riding a Snorlax, etc).		Just have normal battles always and make motion controls optional, and it's perfect.
@barndingus I liked the look of Let's Go a lot and want Gen 8 to look sort of like it, but I assume I'm in the minority for that.
@SquirrelEmperor @GamersCharisma @SpawnWaveMedia Okay. Just saying many want more of the same.
@vianafelippe @PAXperMortem @SerebiiNet The sales numbers show people loved LGPE, tho üòâ
@M4YK_ @rndmKai Featuring Dante From The Devil May Cry Series
@GamersCharisma @SquirrelEmperor @SpawnWaveMedia This. The core fanbase doesn't really want an open world BotW-style game as much as you think. Most were happy with Gen 7.		There's a reason Let's Go sold so well in a short amount of time, after all.

@mustafa9218 @AlphaFoxWarfare You can't deny, though, while 2018 was the year of the PS4 (GoW, Spider-man, Shadow of the Colossus) it's rather barren in 2019, while Switch has the opposite issue.
@mustafa9218 @AlphaFoxWarfare No need to console fanboy, man. There's no such thing as a console that "appeals to everyone".		I agree with the other guy, though. After KH3, my PS4 won't be played nearly as much as my Switch this year.
@TerryAshcraft1 @glennbeck @jordanbpeterson Go see a DC movie instead. They're pretty desperate for revenue, I hear.

@Jamen131 @RealKyleMorris Not really to your first comment. I was told Dems = Doomed after the 2018 shutdown, but everyone forgot it like a week later.
@heather41495 @SohrabAhmari In other words, "If you don't agree with me, you're an extremist"

@KMAC19691 @MattWalshBlog Nah, conservatives are the ones who made her a star - the more the right hates her, the more reason to rally behind her. I implore them to continue such behavior tbh.
@michizonan @RubinReport @benshapiro @JeremyDBoreing @jack I see nothing offensive.
@isouraan @PetscopKid @MyNintendoNews Japanese game has Japanese characters.		More at 11.
@bdphillip @NHGOP @NHDems Now the question is, is there GOP person in the state that can even take down Shaheen in 2020 (unless Sununu attempts a suicide run against her)?
@BasedTomas @EsotericCD @AOC (The üêù gave it away)
@BasedTomas @EsotericCD @AOC "You got represented"		Is this how the hip cool youngsters of today talk? If so...thanks?
@AnonymousQ1776 lol the ratio		I don't even understand the issue with this video. Dancing = bad?
@gwpbrianw @benshapiro And failing at it, as well.		(Nothing new for the world of Ben, though)
@Michael77573354 @antdude92 Nah, it's just a Goomba with a hat.
@JimEightDigits @notinabluemoon @JohnCornyn @WSJopinion Would be funny to see them regret it in a few years when the tables are turned.
@Kim4eversone899 @Magadave4171 @daveweigel I guess @Magadave4171 couldn't be bothered to try Google for 5 seconds...
@mikeob1972 @kenyon75 @SheriffClarke @MittRomney Sounds like quite the complement coming from you.
@alex_martin7 @Jfgg81Juan @realDonaldTrump (lel looks like it's actually quite easy to trigger the untrigger-able if this comment is any indication)
@ScottWalker (Just here to laugh at the ratio)
@stevesingiser @XAVIFERN_AFC @andrew_striedl Shhh, you're making too much sense there m8.
@CherylM12835788 @dsboyette @Jim_Jordan k.
@6siders @HumanistReport Comedy and @RubinReport don't rly belong in the same sentence tbh.
@HumanistReport Here's hoping the 2020 election is settled in Mario Kart.
@CherylM12835788 @dsboyette @Jim_Jordan Well, it's over in 2 days - better hurry up.
@vet4change @mabasnett @MorriseyWV @realDonaldTrump And who will challenge it? Certainly not this loser Morrisey guy.

@ArloStuff @FloofyGabe @Saberspark @NathanielBandy1 @ScottTheWoz @RelaxAlax @NitroRad @indiejacob @Nintendrew_ You'll always be first in my heart, Arlo.
@Darkren_84 @MildRemedy @SSBUNews ???		I see Brawlers online all the time.	(Though new alts for characters &gt; miis, regardless)
@emilyryanharper @TheRickWilson Don't mind me, just here to admire @emilyryanharper's impressive ratio.
@kingg_wavee @THEREALRTU The big point is you sure like to defend crime a lot. Says a lot about you as a person, don't you think? üòé
@kingg_wavee @THEREALRTU I agree, everyone selling ROMS is in the wrong, including people that aren't Soulja, and litigation against any of them (including Soulja) is 100% fair and justified. Glad we finally agree. üëç
@kingg_wavee @THEREALRTU (I'm willing to bet anyone here he didn't even bother reading and decided to rant instead, lol)		So I showed you people selling ROMs on eBay are in the legal wrong (unlike your claims). Any arguments left defending ROM selling...or?
@kingg_wavee @THEREALRTU ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èJust when you thought the white knights couldn't get any lamer with their arguments.		But, since you brought up ebay, already a precedent (not really in favor of your argument btw):	https://t.co/fuRLsEEfpY
@kingg_wavee @THEREALRTU Depends, were these gamers selling these modded consoles with roms? The issue is profiting off of them (which is why ROM sites are being shut down).
@kingthrashgames @soulking214 @TheDracord @THEREALRTU @DreamcastGuy @souljaboy So I watched the video and looked into both clone consoles mentioned in the video and the one Soulja is selling. There is one big (very obvious) difference legally between these.		Can you tell me what it is?
@AndrewSolender @davidsirota @BetoORourke @BarackObama Does Sirota even like any Democrat at all?
@teamtrump5 @AndrewSolender @RBrindisi12 @nytimes Nor is Trump in 2020 if you don't get wall funding within the next		*checks watch*		11 days. The clock is ticking... üòé
@teamtrump5 @AndrewSolender @RBrindisi12 @nytimes The funny thing is, I've been hearing this for 5+ years now. I guess @teamtrump5 is pretty slow at this.
@ESAnderson434am @Ewwjr53 @ChangeTheLAUSD @Txunum01 @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump @GOP @NRA ...and then @Ewwjr53 ran away.
@tommydeeelive @BlaktimusPrime @videogamedeals They did it because they just don't want us to be able to play the greatest game on the console, Ape Escape. Only explanation.
@hughhewitt @chuckschumer The almighty ratio tends to disagree.
@RigneyDave @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Whoooooosh
@SheriffClarke @rolandsmartin If nothing else, this teaches us that is doesn't take much to make @SheriffClarke mad. üòé
@RigneyDave @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @nytimes May as well not even come to this site then.		And yes, arguing with homeless men on the corner is fun FYI.
@TheRightAmeric1 @fawfulfan @ericr13 &gt;Tagging a pedophile while calling someone else a pedo		???
@jtf18james @bethanyshondark Your hate makes us stronger. Please continue hating (as Jesus would do).
@jsassy74 @kirkvanek @benshapiro Hey, it ain't fair to remind @kirkvanek of the point he's clearly dodging.
@dhrxsol1234 Pretty funny stuff.
@Fasteagle101 @thehill lel look at this guy rehashing tweets. Consider getting new material		https://t.co/Hh5t5cpXcq
@romabysen @inb4alex @_Trave_ @benshapiro That ain't cool bro, I heard The Daily Wire is very successful within Ben's circle of friends.	(I just looked at how it ranks among website usage tho, and....ouch)
@inb4alex @_Trave_ @benshapiro Not very impressive.
@PalmsleyMoseley @AndyRichter I also bet Red Skull wouldn't lose 3 separate congressional elections ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@_Trave_ @benshapiro Story of Ben's life tbh.
@hunthickey @sandra_scheil @SheriffClarke It's called free market. Look it up.
@KevinLShannon1 @SheriffClarke @KayaJones lol @ expecting Trump to keep promises
@Capedcr82210140 @BigYankeeMike @AnnCoulter ...okay.		That doesn't explain why he won't just get Mexico to pay for the wall like he promised. Save even more, then.
@Capedcr82210140 @BigYankeeMike @AnnCoulter So....was Mexico paying for the wall just a lie, or?
@ERICMORRISON66 @BigYankeeMike @AnnCoulter What do Dems have to do with anything? I was told Mexico was building the wall.
@BigYankeeMike @AnnCoulter Maybe 'cause we were told he was an expert deal maker or something...
@coll61490833 @GovMikeHuckabee No one but yourselves to blame.
@milar_t @TammiFire31 @GovMikeHuckabee Story of @TammiFire31's life tbh.
@theblaze Never thought I'd see the day @theblaze would defend Facebook. Match made in heaven tbh.
@easy5050 @LarrySabato Nah, Confederates at least cared about the voices of Southern state people (kind of).
@MattRooneyNJ Don't mind me, just here for the ratio.		Btw, I remember your website - were you the columnist that was (poorly) trying to rationalize MacArthur's rather racist attack ads against Kim with your only argument boiling down to "nuh-uh!"?
@Type_ur_name @JamesArkin It's easy to beat her because repeating the same attack last time worked, and she had no idea how to run an election.		As for the Trump part, lol when was the last time you saw a Dem complain about Steve Pearce? They begged him to be R nominee in NM, and he lost bigly.
@Wolff53265132 @LofiVocalFry @TalibKweli @dneighbor @TrigTriggins @Crystal12916225 @Bryanjdyer @LillyPa57205483 @jakeryanbluntz @God7Zee Yeah! And why is water so wet?		The world may never know.
@nunybizniz @nicole_hong @rebeccadobrien @rebeccaballhaus @aviswanatha "It's okay if I'm an evil person because my sworn enemy I call the devil on a daily basis did it first!!!!!!!!111"		Classic @nunybizniz I tells ya.
@RonaldGuillory9 @RepMarkTakano *looks up poorest and most violent states*		um...
@MythrilMagician If the supposed new DLC leak is true, Erdrick would be Japanese fanservice (that America prob won't care for) just as how Banjo would be American fanservice that Japan won't care for.
@MythrilMagician But DQ11 comes out next year on Switch, so the marketing argument works even more in Erdrick's favor.		Not saying Sora is unlikely, but I'm told Japanese audiences love DQ a ton.
@Kieron097 @MightyKeef A certain other RPG series that's more popular overseas...
@SWKong4000 @IntroSpecktive Still can't tell if everyone is just pranking me with their stories of lag, or if my crappy internet finally found something it doesn't suck at tbh.
@FannyF50828097 @MattWalshBlog I too love all the libs you find on Fox News tbh.
@ShawnLong85 It's all about that Richter guy, though.
@VictorRunge @RichardERoeper I disagree. If an objectively bad person dislikes you, things are going swimmingly üòé
@VictorRunge @RichardERoeper I'd be complimented if you called me a dick tbh. Shows I'm doing something right in life.
@alpharadtv Rosalina and (maybe) Lucina not princess enough for you? For shame.
@AKShootFiirst_ @IGN Yeah! #PutUltimateAlliance3OnWii
@rootbeerismyjam @JacobWe29574339 @nintendolife ???		I've played both the PS4 and Switch versions of 2k19, not much difference tbh performance wise. I know it's made by 2K games, my point is if they can do it, why not EA?		(Also pay more? Both are the same price...)
@rootbeerismyjam @JacobWe29574339 @nintendolife NBA 2K is rather graphics intensive, and that works fine.
@JacobWe29574339 @nintendolife Apparently the only EA game even on Switch outside of FIFA is Fe. I guess EA hates money or something.
@AndreSegers Same. Makes me wonder if people complaining about lag so much are exaggerating.
@DPMFLeviBlueee @TalibKweli @Aflavorator @Crystal12916225 @OhDamnEthan @AaronDunlap72 @caitlynfredieu And I think you got no sense of style, man. Consider not asking your mother to dress you, next time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Rasmussen_Poll @POTUS ICYMI Remember when @Rasmussen_Poll predicted R+1 and cried when people called them out for being super wrong in the end? üòÖ
@RCTrumpisback @slpng_giants Very creative name there.
@jbled79 @JoeSmit61826251 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Glad you agree you sure are missing a point there (or two).
@garrettwillz0 @NintendoAmerica @ArthritisFdn @Pokemon @IGN @GameSpot @miyamoto Your best best may just be to only play the game in handheld mode where there's no motion controls.
@scrubsfan10 @shaunking @CoryBooker @sunrisemvmt Well he's not even in congress anymore (nor is there proof he's running for president, yet) so not like his opinion matters much.
@elizabe23371044 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump That would be a first.
@YOHOmeHEARTIES @sethweathers @TomiLahren And how much has McSally voted with Trump? Exactly üòé
@Nintendrew_ How dare you forget Switch's GOTY also coming out next year - FIFA 2020!
@sethweathers @TomiLahren I, too, am excited at the prospect of Senator Sinema.
@GOAT_Tobi @libowner69 @IRussell729 @kkondik Please do, I'd be honored. üòé
@GOAT_Tobi @libowner69 @IRussell729 @kkondik (I notice you didn't even answer my question. Avoiding it? üòÜ)
@TomiLahren Welp, if an openly partisan fact checker says it, it must be true.		There you go guys. GG.
@IRussell729 @GOAT_Tobi @libowner69 @kkondik I don't think you should really bother explaining at this point. You're literally talking to a person in the cohort that believes 70% = 100%
@GOAT_Tobi @libowner69 @IRussell729 @kkondik Bro, you're just embarrassing yourself further now...		I'm looking at the model right now, they predicted (on average) a +1 net gain for R's. Final result was +2 R due to the weird things happening in the FL senate race (which no model can really predict). Can you read models?
@GOAT_Tobi @libowner69 @IRussell729 @kkondik And yet, 538 was completely right on the money for the house elections in 2018...		Perhaps you aren't so GOAT after all, @GOAT_Tobi.
@BSyarmulke @NBCNews That's one bad stutter you got there, man.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump If it's boring you so much, why bother replying to it?		Hint: This bothers him a lot
@libowner69 @kkondik We are talking about a state party that nominates and then stands by candidates like Roy Moore.		I wouldn't be shocked if he was somehow the nominee again, in fact.
@scrambledtimes @charliekirk11 By that logic, why can't the same be done to fund the wall that for some reason Mexico can't pay for anymore?
@buckmurray1 @SportingWealth @charliekirk11 @POTUS And how, exactly, would Dems block something in the senate? Did you mean to say house?
@OfficialSTSO @Politics_Polls @LarrySabato @kkondik @geoffreyvs @Center4Politics Exactly, "if". We are talking about a state where the GOP voters overwhelmingly stuck by Roy Moore. Who knows what this group of voters will nominate next. 		It does not look like these predictions take into account any challengers that have not already declared.
@ben_oh_ @LarrySabato @kkondik I think they are. No way Maine is still Lean-R if Collins leaves.
@guek_jc @foradaleims @JonComms @insomniacgames @NYCSpiderCop @TheTorete_CF @Michaelramos227 @Guncastlebrown Always important to never capitalize a single word on said calling cards tbh.
@andrew_striedl Not sure if I should laugh at this take, or just feel bad for it, man. ü§®
@rod_pollard @KingJames Yeah! Doncha know it's already @rod_pollard's bedtime?
@antdude92 You've given up on Mike Jones already? For shame.
@Christi999 @benshapiro Why not, in fact, punish both? Garbage human beings need to be thrown out regardless of political affiliation.
@Christi999 @benshapiro "Me being evil is okay because my sworn enemies who I immensely hate and call evil daily are just as bad as me!!!!!!!!"		Jesus would be so very proud. üëç
@dmwaun @AnnCoulter I guess "conservative Trump supporter" is the new liberal for @dmwaun if Jenner is any indication. Truly a stable genius ü§®
@GarrenShipley @SpanbergerVA07 Hey, all she has to do is offer you a cupcake, right @GarrenShipley?
@HennyGod84 @HMKilla @RogersBase @nintendolife @shofu Well I was just kidding (though he would be cool), but I don't think there are many things that can beat Joker. If the newest so-called "leak" is true, the only thing bigger than him would be Banjo.
@EvanBrownMD @benshapiro Some people do say that Lake Erie is pretty eerie.
@realSilverFoxXL @benshapiro I hear his father was a mailman.
@ElrondAdama Yep, she's clearly the dumbest member of congress or something. https://t.co/UpujRKjq8w
@rascalman4 @AnnCoulter That would be a first.
@HennyGod84 @HMKilla @RogersBase @nintendolife @shofu If by nah you mean yea, I agree.
@Dep_Nationalist @DLoesch I always knew that news reporters on the east coast were REALLY secretly actors on the west. True story.
@Elohim_Gadol @theblaze Just doing the first thing is good enough, tbh.
@NayrmanBSC @AndreSegers Yet FEELS so right.
@PerePeterson @AnnCoulter Ouch, gott'em.
@CarmineSabia On the other hand, @CarmineSabia, getting ratio'd (like this tweet) rather proves just how unpopular your position is.
@Wario432 @NateSilver538 And I expected better from Wario after unlocking him in the new Smash Bros. Smh still low tier üò™
@GoodWitchLeigh That's a weird way of spelling Wario tbh.
@leononleonard @US_Inhabitant @JBKolat @justicedems @cenkuygur @sunrisemvmt @Ocasio2018 Being able to get a ~7% on a test without even starting it yet is quite impressive, yes.
@hoochiemama3 @TomArnold @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio @RealJamesWoods Literally.
@Bgreenberg1992 @daveweigel @willsommer @lachlan Blaze just kicked out Gavin recently, so wouldn't be surprised.
@ingeniousclown @nathanguia1 @Memedream201 @antdude92 Disagree, I like how they were trying to set up conditions to make it like the character you encountered. Obviously you'd be battling a specific character, so...um?		Also, most matches were doable if you have the right spirit. Some were pretty frustrating, I'll admit, though.
@nathanguia1 @Memedream201 @antdude92 World of light is literally better Event Matches, though.		Also, Board the Platforms &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Break the Targets tbh.
@veryfrank10 @ForecasterEnten @maggieNYT And here I thought you were all about no bullshit, @veryfrank10.
@jm18213 @Liz_Wheeler So in other words, you are against bombing children in other countries?		Surprised you're admitting this.
@StevenAndrewDi1 @sandra_scheil @charliekirk11 Clearly black people are being brainwashed or something to be libs. Only explanation.
@RetroGaming86 @NintendoAmerica @NHL @EASPORTSNHL Doesn't EA have a vendetta again Nintendo or something?
@teddy_cat1 @Liz_Wheeler Almost as if @Liz_Wheeler is a hypocrite ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@scott_wehmeyer @MattWalshBlog I had no idea Mexico was part of congress.
@JGwizard @JohnJHarwood (Notice how @JGwizard didn't even bother refuting the claim as being false, instead opting for ad hominem attacks).
@EWErickson The 2018 exit poll demographics don't look much different than they were in 2006 for black people (like 90/9/1 for D, R, and I, respectively).		Are you saying more has changed in the past month than past 12 years?
@WPeaceBoy Maybe Konami is finally getting their shit together...
@carson_ssb Pfft, Zelda is best princess in this game. 		Fite me, bro.
@dzeeff What controller you using?
@BSyarmulke @KurtSchlichter Had no idea Ben was into that kind of stuff...		Explains a lot, though.
@Muhummedmcneil2 @MarvelGames Console fanboying won't get you very far. If you really hate non-Sony consoles, I don't know what to tell ya besides play the Sony exclusive Spiderman again üòê
@Muhummedmcneil2 @MarvelGames Go buy a Switch
@R17Gaming @CristofferLange @1_FuckYou_2 @MarvelGames "Xbox One and PS4 have well over 150 million consoles sold between them."		Hey, you're the one who brought up sales as if it means something.	(Btw they definitely have not sold 150 million combined. Can I see your source?)
@Muhummedmcneil2 @MarvelGames Nintendo is literally publishing this game, so won't happen (Same reason why Spiderman was only on PS4).
@Nintendrew_ Smh no Sega Genesis Classics? Lame.
@BSyarmulke &gt;Implying anything matters anyway		lol
@mmagic_mman @UsaJdv @JohnCornyn Lucky, I still haven't been ‚òπÔ∏è		(Btw cool dp)
@UsaJdv @mmagic_mman @JohnCornyn I guess the one attacking another for having few followers when they themselves have few?
@UsaJdv @mmagic_mman @JohnCornyn Looks like @mmagic_mman wins if you block him. Consider blocking me next pls.
@deenieshats @MattWalshBlog You can't just shout someone is of a certain political belief because of where they live. I want some evidence of your claim.		(As for conservative mobs, basically anything having to do with abortions, since the right is obsessed with talking about them in my experience...)
@UsaJdv @mmagic_mman @JohnCornyn My going to lose, indeed.
@deenieshats @MattWalshBlog Whose "own" does Kevin Hart belong to? I don't recall seeing him speak of politics...		And this outrage lynch mob exists on both sides, so lolno.
@mmagic_mman @UsaJdv @JohnCornyn I think you're confused, the person did not say 'lol' but instead 'LoL,' as in they want you to "catch their League of Legends".		So they want to play video games with you, apparently.
@Feralfurry @realDonaldTrump And apparently Trump is paying to have Clinton stay in his head if his tweets are any indication.		Fair deal tbh. üëç
@DanielAwesome73 @pokejungle Just to note, Joker also stars in Persona Q2, an exclusive on 3DS, which just came out in Japan a week or so ago (coincidence?)
@CristofferLange @R17Gaming @1_FuckYou_2 @MarvelGames Not sure why that guy is bringing sales into this if you look at the downright embarrassing sales numbers of the Xbox One after 5 years...
@ajacob998 @GREENSTREAK5 @leonard32347557 @MarvelGames @BillRosemann Bruh your hate boner is even more embarrassing tbh. Stay mad, it's amusing. 	(Consider not being a console fanboy. It ain't the 90s anymore)
@J1000q @qwardet @Q_Review @realDonaldTrump I'm tell you, man, these Non-Playable Characters should've been beta tested.
@MightyKeef What more is there to life?
@JoeMerrick How big is your collection?
@Actual_Big_Jake What's your Switch ID?
@BarryKane25 @MargoAgape @benshapiro Nah. There's a good reason conservative 'comedians' rarely attain mainstream success.
@MargoAgape @benshapiro That would accomplish the goal of getting literally no one to watch it, at least.		Well, less than the people who watch it currently, at least.
@basic_random @RaymondKooyenga @Chadwick_Moore @chadwickboseman is actually attractive, though.
@nat20148 @patchouliDoll @glennbeck Ah, spoken like a true follower of Jesus.
@basic_random @RaymondKooyenga @Chadwick_Moore Nah, you're giving @Chadwick_Moore a little too much credit. Only a face a mother could love tbh.
@andrew_striedl @BautistaBomb Better than the GOP in VA, that's for sure.		Nothing can be worse than probably the most embarrassing dummymander in recent memory.
@BautistaBomb @andrew_striedl Nah, at least Dems have a small chance of victory in the south, unlike the GOP in VA.
@reason Came here to check how bad the ratio was. Did not disappoint.
@estocker8 @debra_iorio @leolauer @GovMikeHuckabee Lol
@leolauer @estocker8 @GovMikeHuckabee (The sad thing is @estocker8 actually believes that)
@shawnsteel1 The first step to rebuilding is probably admitting you have a problem. Just saying.
@AdamJSKing2 @jimmy_dore This seems to be the only thing TYT fans and Jimmy's fans agree with, at least, if video comment sections are anything to go by.
@GOP @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/8epIESWBkg
@hughhewitt @JeffFlake Always fun seeing you turn guys turn on eachother.
@JMilesColeman We'll probably find out in 2020 when he runs yet again.
@NathanWurtzel @ComfortablySmug @baseballcrank You're kidding yourself if you think @ComfortablySmug knows how to read tbh.
@Koheeba2 @theblaze The day I hear Glenn stop yelling conspiracy theories every other day (Deep State, voter fraud, etc) will probably never happen.		Believing in one crazy conspiracy while dismissing another crazy one is pathetic.
@Koheeba2 @theblaze Maybe she'll run into Glenn there.
@JanetLaCava @yugiohtas Yugioh Go should totally be a thing, though. Catching some Kuribohs with the crew in the schoolyard sounds awesome.
@RMahre @andrew_striedl Nah, only the libs do voter fraud by busing in illegals or something, I'm told.
@carterforva What console?
@IndyGumby @graficgod @NateSilver538 With spooky words like "poisonous globalists," don't be surprised if he starts yelling about the super secret DEEP STATE next.
@graficgod @NateSilver538 Yeah progressives, leave cheating to the professionals, please.
@yodacowboy @rolandscahill @SecretaryZinke So he can then handcuff himself to Twitter's headquarters and cry about social media!		I hear all the cool kids do it these days.
@BroMark13 @jimmy_dore Nah, being "anti-establishment" is literally the only thing that matters anymore, apparently.
@Busterman64 @JonComms If they aren't holding swords, then yes üëç
@ayasgirl This guy and @benshapiro should get a room.
@TTruthinator @EWErickson Go for it. I welcome tossing out the trash on both sides.
@ArloStuff Fully can't wait to buy MP1 and 2 a third time.
@conservmillen I don't get it. You say this as if it's a bad thing?
@EButcher55 @luther_bj @ScottWalker Mind if I ask, what exactly do you mean by "suppressed independent support"?
@BlackfootVA @meisryan98 @MarkDice @Twitter What, you don't?
@HangryKissinger @HowardCamerik @jimmy_dore Nah.
@benshapiro Ben, don't you believe the earth is only 5000 years old or something? Not really one to talk on scientific knowledge tbh.
@mychicas3 @TheRickWilson Literally describing millennials.
@Jerbonen Hey, how long has he lived in FL before running? He ran in MD in 2014, FL in 2016. He's shown to be very insecure about this point. ‚ùÑÔ∏è		I agree on the Hillary Clinton part, though. Didn't approve of her running in NY.
@shannonrwatts @NRA But don't mention his many congressional losses to him (especially the most recent one where he carpetbagged to Florida), though. It makes him so mad he goes on blocking sprees, apparently.
@this_is_ROZ33 @DonaldJTrumpJr @cjclax12 Consider working on your drawing skills m8.
@Roslynbooks @NateSilver538 *Uncle		(then again, nothing surprises me with Mitt)
@RoyBStewartJr Yeah, Jack, run your business only the way we want you too!		Sound just like a leftist trying to regulate businesses. Smh.
@DannyCovfefe @Millie__Weaver I, too, consider myself to be a Non-Playable Character in a video game (I guess).
@DannyCovfefe @Millie__Weaver If you click on it, though, it's mostly people pointing and laughing at her for this.
@GVG330 @GovernorTomWolf "It's okay if I'm evil because I know you have the capacity to be evil too!"
@arguedpolitics @NateSilver538 There aren't really enough house offensive opportunities for R's in 2020, so keep waiting. Lot of seats are gone for good.		(Also, Trump already lost roughly the same amount of seats as Obama did at this point, so LOL pathetic)
@BSyarmulke @RepThomasMassie Oh wait, Ben told me his friend in the sky makes rights or something.		My mistake.
@ConeRed719 @JoeNeguse @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt So...how's that deficit going?		If the "fiscal responsibility" party won't even bother addressing this under unified control of Washington, not really one to complain about the other side on economics. No one to blame but yourself.
@BSyarmulke @RepThomasMassie The pathetic ratio on this tweet says otherwise, @BSyarmulke ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@yuggy52 @JacobAWohl I've still yet to see him prove he's bothered to read any scientific papers on the topic. Far more important.		Then again, maybe @JacobAWohl is still in his hipster coffee shop?
@GeorgeNassar @rpyers LOL this aged poorly		I, for one, am quite shocked Young Kim lost, @GeorgeNassar. Pls tell her to run again.
@DJDubbz1 @jimmy_dore And I guess a Non-Playable Character in your video game, evidently.
@naturalrights23 @EWErickson @dbongino Not interested in listening to some pathetic perennial candidate.		Erick is the more credible of the two, at least.
@glennbeck lol Glenn's transformation into a tinfoil hat is complete.		You gonna yell about the spooky DEEP STATE next?
@_Magpie_ @theblaze Yeah, so his Dem successor can be sworn in early!		...wait a minute
@barrydaniels3 @theschpiel @aaronscolen @theblaze @RepMiaLove "last he hiklary" indeed (whatever that means).
@PrisonPlanet @JackPosobiec DEEP STATE!	WITCH HUNT!	PIZZAGATE!		um....Chemtrails?
@theschpiel @aaronscolen @theblaze @RepMiaLove The tantrum she threw after losing was quite a sight - just pointing fingers and blaming everyone but herself.
@shrewst @jimmy_dore @bootsie5 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats If you watched the house races this year, many R's used an anti-Pelosi message as their center message. Didn't work much. 		Not that people like Pelosi, they just don't really care much about who's speaker tbh.
@rootbeerismyjam @Soeroah @ArloStuff Yep.
@rootbeerismyjam @Soeroah @ArloStuff You can't call yourself a legit gaming channel without at least 1 Smash Ultimate video, tho.
@YungSethRogen @mariofan1981 @ChefBoyettardee @MasterAqua01 @NintendoAmerica Guess I'm nobody, apparently üò¢		(Also, the banned people deserved it)
@FrankTheTank814 @TomiLahren Not really. Many incumbent R's that were defeated this month had fearmongering about Pelosi as a central issue, and look at them now.
@NJCnsrvtive @Redistrict Not really seeing any in VA or MN. Maaaaybe VA-07, but that's it (and still kind of eh given the laughable state of the VA GOP).		The rest have 1 competitive seat each (don't forget SC-01 on your list).
@WendellBorton1 @daveweigel In between Shawn Steel and Michael Steele, the former GOP party leadership is probably made up of robots, I guess.
@pkcapitol Be thankful it's not Little Caesar's, at least.
@NJCnsrvtive @Redistrict Not exactly too many offensive opportunities for R's. The Cali and NJ seats may be 100% gone, for example.
@arguedpolitics @NateSilver538 (30 is the average, not 40 btw)		Not to mention, as Dems learned the hard way, senate is worthless without house for stuff not involving judges.
@andrew_striedl Not really. Winning by single digits is pretty pathetic in a blood red state (especially during a runoff). Weakest margin in 30 years. 		(Spin it however you want, though. I know your hyper-partisanship is known to blind your electoral analysis.)
@vanillabean142 @DC4Hope @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Ronna still hasn't shown proof of the voter fraud claims she loves throwing around, so lol
@andrew_striedl (This surprisingly weak margin of victory honestly bodes poorly for GOP in next year's gubernatorial race)
@Chadjamesjohns1 @TomiLahren @Newsweek Not rly https://t.co/ZXw9bodJL9
@Chadjamesjohns1 @TomiLahren @Newsweek Please do. I'm in need of a chuckle for when she loses.
@benshapiro Not really one to cast stones there, Ben.
@SykesCharlie RIP in peace.
@jack1epr1ce @MattWalshBlog Come on, tell us how you really feel üòâ
@googlecrump2 @SSBUNews Literally worth hearing 7000 times more tho
@NateSilver538 Also Jim Hood doesn't seem to be in bad shape for next year.
@flyinginablue @noybsk2017 @Newsweek Given your punctuation, consider putting yourself on that list as well.
@CarmineZozzora I've seen plenty of conservatives vow to leave Twitter after getting "shadowbanned" (which isn't even a real thing ‚ùå). Yet, they're still here.		2 sides of the same coin, I tells ya.
@carlajwright @JahanaHayesCT @TeamPelosi (Tell that to Dave Brat)
@br7ndon @carterforva Nah, just throwing a small pebble at Articuno and Moltres kills them. Sad thing is I'm not even joking. üëÄ
@br7ndon @carterforva Pfft, elite trainers always catch on the first ball. Us grass types know this best.
@dansolomonza @Redistrict @GrantrGregory The only label that matters is The Whole Foods Master Race.		Yet another reason for the right to hate Amazon, I guess.
@des2063 @dmooresb @IngrahamAngle My point was she is 1 of 3 black GOP members of congress. Her and Hurd were both elected in 2014.		Now all eyes on Hurd's election in 2020 üëÄ
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Always fun to see you guys turn on your own.
@dmooresb @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Will Hurd is secretly white, I guess.
@theblaze Pot meet kettle, etc.
@yugiohtas So in other words, Cyrus = hot?
@BSyarmulke @Alyssa_Milano Isn't it past Ben's bedtime by now or something?
@AndrewSolender Is this what we can expect from Gen Z when they become political?
@PhlegonTralled @dantethetroll @benshapiro Wow, he blocked me too. Guess I was right - he really was just an amateur troll.
@dantethetroll @PhlegonTralled @benshapiro ....Non-Playable Character noises? I mean they usually make noises in video games, I guess, but still weird.
@JGRAY_GA @MattWalshBlog You're right. But that's also why it's fun to come here.
@TKD350 @benshapiro I had already liked that tweet, so it's fine. I'm glad you acknowledged your mistake.
@JohnLouisville @GOPChairwoman Shh, you aren't allowed to call her that. Trump forced her get rid of the Romney tag, as you may recall.
@dantethetroll @benshapiro Ah, now I understand why they only call you an "amateur" troll üòâ
@dantethetroll @benshapiro As if Republicans give a shit either, apparently. So much for fiscal responsibility, I guess.
@TKD350 @benshapiro Um...you realize both Obamacare repeal and the tax cuts only needed 50 votes, rite? Also, judges.		I guess this is what I get for assuming people on Twitter are able to read the news ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@benshapiro So...how's the deficit going? The party of "fiscal responsibility" has full control over Washington, after all...
@Lord_Ouranos @AmandaPresto Considering there's no basis to the lawsuit (besides snowflakes crying mean 'ol Mr. Twitter doesn't like them), nah.
@Lord_Ouranos @AmandaPresto Then do it. Twitter would love the free money from such a frivolous lawsuit.
@benshapiro There goes Ben again, completely ignoring science because it doesn't fit his narrative. Sad.
@realjordan_M @Sconnie_Author @EWErickson @jack Remember, kids, science only is real when it benefits your narrative.		That's why the scientific consensus on climate change is fake. God said so.
@T_Duups @benshapiro And I'm sure literally every credible scientist would argue climate change is real. 		(But shhh, don't tell Ben.)
@T_Duups @benshapiro &gt;Current biological texts	&gt;First book he cited is over 40 years old		lol, definitely sounds more like an emotional response, not bothering to look into what he's citing. No respectable publication would accept data that old.
@T_Duups @benshapiro Sounds more like Ben is so triggered by this he made 10+ tweets on it.		Telling you, man, lefties and righties aren't so different after all, apparently.
@benshapiro Jeez, this whole thing sure is triggering you, huh?		I guess the libs and cons aren't so different, after all...
@benshapiro @jack I see no issue with this at all.
@csrupp @benshapiro (Oh the irony coming from a creationist tbh)
@benshapiro Don't you guys still fight the validity of climate change or something, tho?
@JP_Obienugh @benshapiro @jack Consider letting the company fail again, then.
@xmehdigeek @TDoorman8 @Lenoxmst ...thank you? Just stating facts.
@xmehdigeek @TDoorman8 @Lenoxmst Nah, we're talking about an actual good game, though.
@AndrewSolender Did Jim Gilmore?
@dailyexception @WalshFreedom I agree with that for the big chains, but local coffee shops are always the best tbh.
@BillDaniel5 @AlexPadilla4CA Any specific numbers you'd care to share?		...no? k.
@Glenngilley @OblongataMajula @realDonaldTrump In other words, rationalize why Trump breaking a campaign promise is okay.		Politicians either do what they promised or are voted out. His choice.
@one_big_boss And then this might shift again next year with the guy in the back being Pokemon Gen 8. 		(Excited for both, tho)
@KyleKashuv @mattgaetz (Yet this kid wonders why Hogg is more respected than him)
@Daisy49103 @ChristusPatriot Yeah, voter fraud caused a Dem to win inside a very blue city!		Speaking of investigating, those Trump ones by Schiff and Waters will be fun to watch üòé
@KH3_12919 @TheSwedishAce @yugiohtas Coded is the only game in the series I would legitimately rate as a "bad" game tbh.		(I know it's a cell phone game port, but 358/2 was on the same system and is just fine).
@fawfulfan @HotlineJosh @markos You're making too much sense, man.
@TheSwedishAce @yugiohtas I really hated the gameplay of the console versions of CoM. Better left skipped imo.
@Nemo19089 @yugiohtas I can agree with this sentiment at times, like with the recent Diablo fiasco. But current reception to Pokemon Let's Go kind of makes me want to disagree...
@psiko83 @AnnCoulter 0, since Dems don't have power until 2019.		No wall = fully GOP fault.
@SombrePrism @ShadowIronblood Well, these were some entertaining posts to read. All I can stay is, looks like all fandoms are terrible after all if you're any indication.		(I'll leave by telling you to consider getting a better catchphrase - "headass" isn't really insulting anyone much tbh)
@SombrePrism @ShadowIronblood &gt;"Series y'all hate"	&gt;Said above I OWN EVERY GAME IN THE SERIES		Shows the intelligence of people I interact with on this site, folks üôÑ		(Ex - I'm a big Pokemon fan, but you couldn't pay me to interact with the toxic fanbase surrounding it)
@SombrePrism @ShadowIronblood Ouch, a crazed fanboy DEMANDING you pay attention to some convoluted video game story insulted me. Looks like you've killed me with your badassery. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@SombrePrism @ShadowIronblood And this is the line we've been waiting for, folks-		"Don't play this game I like unless you play it the way I want you to."
@SombrePrism @ShadowIronblood It's clear some people aren't very interested in the older games and only want the newest one, so why not just play that and enjoy the gameplay/ignore the story?		(Btw - I own every KH game, half of them are probably skip-worthy unless you're a hardcore fan tbh).
@PhillyRamFan @MollyJongFast So much for wanting government out of our lives - Right only wants government regulation when they aren't allowed to shitpost here anymore, apparently.
@AndrewSolender Bob Pittenger can be his VP.
@WilliamLindayen @Chris_hannigan0 Checkmate, Atheists.
@JenATweeter @MichaelAvenatti @Twitter I, for one, also believe it's the job of social media to uphold free speech.
@sillysqueek @LauraLoomer Consider boycotting Twitter?
@TippyFalmouth @RealMattCouch That description fits many people.
@OP_Bradley @SpawnWaveMedia Wonder how they'll spin these numbers as a negative.
@TrendanBrendan @Toadused2stink @Josinabox23 @NGameTheCube Yeah I noticed the weird walking in cutscenes and some moves having really lazy animations. Regardless, I don't think they'll be choosing next year's engine on LGPE's sales/reception, since it's too late.
@TrendanBrendan @Toadused2stink @Josinabox23 @NGameTheCube Is it even possible to import a 3DS engine for use on Switch?		I assumed they'd just be using the LPGE engine minus the Go stuff.
@Josinabox23 @TrendanBrendan @Toadused2stink @NGameTheCube &gt;You know the game was terrible		I've actually had a lot of fun so far with Let's Go so far, if that's what we're talking about. It's a nice change of pace. But I guess I and my several teams in the 3DS games I've spent ages making aren't "hardcore enuff" for you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@TrendanBrendan @Toadused2stink @Josinabox23 @NGameTheCube I've seen them mention they plan to lay the groundwork of Gen 8 off this game, but not it being on the same caliber as Sun/Moon.
@TrendanBrendan @Toadused2stink @Josinabox23 @NGameTheCube While that would be cool to see a "modern" Gen 1 game, it was pretty clear this was meant to strictly only be a remake of Yellow from the start, so only 151.	I'm hoping people who are disliking this game realize this is just another spinoff, NOT a main game.
@SoCalCMH @CBinVAN @StuPolitics @RadioFreeTom And it'll be something to watch Trump get harassed daily by house Dems, knowing he can't really stop them.		Fair trade tbh.
@seanflanagan43 @DefeatTyranny1 @Redistrict WITCH HUNT!
@LocoElephante Pretty good game tbh. Here's hoping Gen 8 brings over some ideas from it.
@Toadused2stink @Josinabox23 @NGameTheCube Lol I'm willing to bet you these people complaining about "Kanto again" would be gushing at a Sinnoh remake, even though it's been about the same amount of time for both.
@uncletimsband @theblaze You think she'll ever beat the Queen of Gaffes, Mrs. "I Can See Russia From My House!" herself?
@OPJYHWK @SpeakingBee @Redistrict @MattMackowiak Better a real Dem than a D in R clothing, rite?
@sbjaxfl @NateSilver538 Also Nevada Republicans. They seem to have gotten BTFO'd badly.
@BrockSweat @politico Ah, I remember when solid red Virginia was saying this a decade ago, and look at it now politically.		(Speaking of SC, coincidence that Charleston just elected its first new Dem congressman since 1980?) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@BrockSweat @politico *Googles "poorest states"*		&gt;9/10 of poorest ones are red		???
@XenoChu @TomBLock91 @thisishipnotik @SpawnWaveMedia I literally still see people complain that we can see IVs now.		Like...really üòë
@XenoChu @TomBLock91 @thisishipnotik @SpawnWaveMedia But if Gamefreak doesn't fix the game, they'll boycott the series! üò± 		That'll show 'em.
@XenoChu @TomBLock91 @thisishipnotik @SpawnWaveMedia Looking at Metacritic score, looks like another Last Jedi situation - good critic scores, bad audience scores.
@TomBLock91 @thisishipnotik @SpawnWaveMedia The Go community are either Pokefans or mobile gamers - and nothing will get the mobile people to spend full price on a console and game.
@TomBLock91 @thisishipnotik @SpawnWaveMedia This spinoff seems to be selling better than other spinoffs.
@NostalgiaTrap @thekir2017 @NirajAntani @RealSaavedra @Ocasio2018 Hey, Minecraft IS THE FUTURE, apparently.
@LeoRules1 @Alyssa_Milano This may be a worse ratio than that @eScarry guy. Kudos.
@NBeesex @hmmm420hmmmm69 @BrendanBlaber ...that doesn't answer my point at all. If you need me to repeat, Mr. Mudkip, "Knowing his history ON THIS SITE, he clearly never was".
@NBeesex @hmmm420hmmmm69 @BrendanBlaber Did I miss the part of him being unbiased, Sir Mudkip? Knowing his history on this site, he clearly never was.
@NBeesex @hmmm420hmmmm69 @BrendanBlaber Literally an inferior starter trying to attack me for having an opinion üòé
@hmmm420hmmmm69 @BrendanBlaber lol getting mad over the internet. Someone needs to grow up. 		(Also a little creepy you made an account here just to harass him).
@NoahShade4 @alexsalvinews @OANN ???		Can you share whatever it is you're on? Sounds quite dank.
@priestcraig1 @Trey_VonDinkis Okay, but who's the refugee? I still want to read about that.
@priestcraig1 @Trey_VonDinkis Who's the Vietnamese female refugee who ran for congress this year? I'd love to read about her tbh.
@NoahShade4 @alexsalvinews @OANN (Let's just ignore the fact that Clinton win this district by NINE points).
@Larpyiscool @BrendanBlaber Never like your own comments again either, pls.
@GodnCountry_ @brianpbeagle Hey, us zombies have rights too you know!
@Dave_VHS Sorry, you mind digging up the tweet? Don't remember this.
@Dave_VHS @BrendanBlaber @onemanshowoff Think of fans as revenue? Did I miss this part of that video or something?
@WalshFreedom Give Joe credit - at least he's never been arrested before (as far as I know).
@Explorer818 @BreitbartNews So only Macs are allowed now?
@AirierGames @eScarry Probably the last place I expected to see you, Airier üòØ
@PatriotforeverU @BuckSexton @DennisMorans Um, CA-21?		But no, everything is cheating, witch hunt, DEEP STATE!!!!, etc.
@bin_so_glanzend @Popplio99 @JoeMerrick @IGN @GameSpot @nintendolife @NintendoIns @eurogamer @Kotaku 7.8/10 Too Much Water in this comment
@marcorubio Just go on and keep digging that hole, bud.
@AndrewSolender I think it's more likely to go red than PA tbh.
@yugiohtas He'd be better as Pharaoh the Cat in a Detective Pharaoh movie tbh.
@mwil_cl @NateSilver538 A little too far of a reach for now for Dems. Perhaps it'll get less red with his new district post-2020 redistricting.
@mwil_cl @NateSilver538 ALL OF THEM!!!!		but lol really probably 6 (all of the tossup ones) and very close in a 7th one (CA-21)
@go_onizuka @dzeeff If no one plays it, then how is it the second most annoying card of all time?		Checkmate, Atheists. üòé
@RManolatos @AndrewSolender @benshapiro I take this as a compliment coming from a guy who could only come up with a "your mother" joke.		Looks like a waste of time for us both.
@CoachyWanKanobe @jaketapper I have no idea about him. Both should be recalled, if so.
@AndrewSolender üëé
@RManolatos @AndrewSolender @benshapiro You really take Twitter seriously with your wall of texts, huh? Odd.
@CoachyWanKanobe @jaketapper I believe you're thinking of Ohio and the US house (with Jim "the Gym" Jordan). Honest mistake.
@RManolatos @AndrewSolender @benshapiro Ouch, you've defeated me with this unbeatable joke. I now have to run away in shame and be exiled away after being defeated this badly by someone who still can't meme üò¢
@RManolatos @AndrewSolender @benshapiro lol @ using Scharzenegger in an anti-lib meme. Will you use Nancy Pelosi in your next one? üòÖ		lrn2memebro
@RManolatos @AndrewSolender @benshapiro ...He's just joined in a likely successful lawsuit against Trump? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@andrew_striedl I have an honest question - do you want McSally to be appointed to the other seat, or do you think there's someone better?
@AnnGables3 @tedlieu @dccc @katieporteroc Does this mean the resistance resisted Resist the Resistance?		'cause that's pretty irresistible tbh.
@Actual_Big_Jake @dzeeff I can think of multiple people who fit this description tbh. (Though I assume you mean the worst one of them all)
@artxmaverick @kkondik @JeffDeWitAZ I'm willing to bet the nominee on the Dem side will be Greg Stanton, who almost ran this year.
@Gr8fl4Blessings @MikeBloomberg @amazon Not like the libs just won a suburban Dallas house seat or anything.
@Stoudtfan @EWErickson Now that the libs have solidified VA as a permanent blue state, GA is probably second on the list (after Arizona).
@CastIrony @FrostyBanjo @AndreSegers So...you're admitting Smash Ultimate should be in this year's awards? It comes out this year, after all, if we're playing this game.
@CastIrony @FrostyBanjo @AndreSegers I know, right? Xenoblade 2, the greatest RPG of the past year, is my favorite PS4 game.
@PhilChmieleski @Robillard They entered this congress with Jeff Sessions still in congress. Completely their fault for losing it.
@On_Politike @StuPolitics Unless it gets to like Roy Moore levels of bad, probably not. Mississippi gonna Mississippi.
@NateSilver538 I'd maybe switch AZ and PA? PA's GOP has just kept taking hits since 2016, while AZ's Dems seem to be getting better.
@yourbooyahfan @mmurraypolitics @chucktodd I for one love Governor Scott Walker, whose monstrous victory last week showed he has a bright political future.		Hey, wait a minute...
@andrew_striedl Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were both re-elected this year alongside Republican governors in their states. Maybe independents just don't like your candidate?
@theblaze And here I thought the libs yelling about Russia were the "crazies"...
@Moostached @letsunfuckusa @NateSilver538 All I'm hearing is "If I lose, it's because the other guy cheated, definitely not because my candidate sucked".
@sjmookie @AnnCoulter WITCH HUNT!!!!!11111111
@ReginaP87963387 @schmotdocker @TexanInExileCA @EWErickson Dems surprisingly control 5/9 of Arizona's house seats now, so I guess they really want that check.
@EsotericCD And here we thought NOVA couldn't get any bluer...
@Brocktune2 @EWErickson His paltry margin of victory against an unabashed liberal in "conservative bastion" Texas was rather pathetic tbh. Compare this to his 2012 performance when he wasn't even an incumbent.
@saneman3000 @Nate_Cohn Voting by mail always takes a while to tally. CA is most notorious for this.
@Brocktune2 @EWErickson Perhaps conservatism is just a victim of its own "success"? Notice how suburban Texas went against GOP.
@yaf @benshapiro Didn't the libs just defeat Scott Walker there? They may as well have found Jesus tbh.
@lynnejuju @AP_Politics @AP I know, Brian Kemp should be jailed.
@realmshepard @benshapiro This comment aged rather poorly tbh.
@BethLynch2020 I, for one, am excited at the prospect of a Speaker Steny Hoyer, as you seem to be suggesting.
@willcollier Um, blue checkmark? wat
@mkraju Could've sworn CA-48 and 49 were already called for D's.		Regardless, looks like Dems are on track to win all of those minus GA-07 for now.
@KevinMizer @StephenKing Illegals voting!	Dead people voting!	People voting twice!	WITCH HUNT!!!11111oneoneone
@MagniFieri @thehill I agree, Brian Kemp shall be indicted for his crimes.
@jimxiatsui @NateSilver538 It actually is if you've ever followed an election before tbh.
@Moostached @letsunfuckusa @NateSilver538 &gt;Lived here most of his life	&gt;Is unaware that CA likes to vote by mail		???
@AnnCoulter ???		Do you not know how scripts work?
@Redistrict I don't know, MI and PA seem to have rebounded hard against Trump. Maybe include GA on the list?
@Donnajm2030 @RBrindisi12 @buddyhacker777 @politico LOL tell that to Brian Kemp, mirite?
@fxguy1969 @Luarien @TheSpoonyOne @realDonaldTrump Weren't you just yelling about how Spoony is a Non Playable Character in your video game or something a moment ago
@NRA Fallen so far you've gotten ratio'd several times over.		Never change, @NRA.
@realKrisCruz (The sad thing is @realKrisCruz probably actually believes this.)
@EagleGraphs @NateSilver538 If people I consider to be the devil do bad things, it's okay if I do bad things too!
@andrewpbailey1 @erinrileyau @bleestein @BooyahIv @BurnsandAllen2 @SeanErnst @Redistrict Yes, Al Franken and Thad Cochran's seats.
@erinrileyau @bleestein @andrewpbailey1 @BooyahIv @BurnsandAllen2 @SeanErnst @Redistrict (As did Minnesota)
@JoeM3120 @ForecasterEnten Stop trying to make me like the new senator even more.
@andrewpbailey1 @Redistrict And Dems should be begging for her to be the 2020 nominee if her performance this year is any indication.
@DougSullivant @JeffFlake That's what you get for not nominating Kelli Ward.
@cwm360 @Redistrict Orange County was a red area, though, before Trump came to town. Dems should be happy that he seems to be turning the suburbs liberal.
@legalskolar @Rascalsfan76 @Redistrict People seem to think voting by mail is votes "magically appearing". Never thought snail mail would be forgotten that fast.
@Beaderino1 @Vermeullarmine @MsContrarianSci @RussOnPolitics Looks like someone has literally never followed an election in California before. So much for being an electoral expert üôÑ
@Rascalsfan76 @Redistrict Blah blah if my guy loses it's because illegals, dead voters, and voting multiple times.		Is that all of them, or did I miss one?
@DougSullivant @JeffFlake Yeah! He needs to let his new successor take over already. #Sinema2018
@mattgaetz Speaking of criminal activity... https://t.co/2ZZouPBJQE
@babar7519 @thehill WITCH HUNT!!!!!1111oneoneone
@darinlabron @politico Lol, good luck to her trying to win a full term in 2020. Once a loser, always a loser.
@whyme2017 @NickRiccardi *looks at Arizona's 2016 map, then 2012, then 2008.....*		Man, you sure have a pretty big egg on your face right now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@CoryBhend @f98froh @NateSilver538 They will likely hate the actual Dem nominee even more I imagine (this hatred of Pelosi comes off more as political theater i think, since she isn't even very far to the left).
@CoryBhend @f98froh @NateSilver538 Considering the very real possibility of having a 50-50 senate post 2020, would be a funny way of seeing a President Pelosi.
@SpecialPerform2 @NateSilver538 At least now we know why you call yourself "special".
@alissakmclean @Rteastuh @Redistrict Hyper partisans gonna partisan.
@CoryBhend @f98froh @NateSilver538 What exactly happens if the house delegations tie 25-25 as well?
@f98froh @CoryBhend @NateSilver538 MT is also a possibility, given the close margin of victory this year.
@f98froh @CoryBhend @NateSilver538 Considering Dems won the house without having to go into many Trump won seats, I'd be surprised if they lose the house in 2020.		But who knows what delegations will look like post 2020.
@CoryBhend @f98froh @NateSilver538 Sherrod Brown also destroyed Renacci on Tuesday. I would personally chalk that (and Udall losing) up to a disparity in candidate quality.		The point is, Dems need to go target AZ and GA now, and R's should go to WI and MN (since it seems like MI and PA are over Trump-fever now).
@CoryBhend @f98froh @NateSilver538 Meh, at least R's have done well in NV recently (completely dominated the state in 2014). Meanwhile, they've gotten clobbered year after year in CO and VA.
@f98froh @NateSilver538 One thing's for sure after this election - Dems won't win OH in 2020 (and R's should give up on VA and CO too).
@AndrewSolender Never expected Arizona to be the first state to elect a bisexual senator tbh.
@AnnCoulter Democrats: "Russians!"	Republicans: "Illegals!" "Dead Voters!" "Voting multiple times!" "Bused in voters!"		Is that all of them, or did I miss some?
@WalshFreedom @karringtonsc This race played out exactly like the Delaware senate election in 2010.		"Hi, I'm Katie Arrington, and I'm not a witch".
@sahilkapur Huh, I would've expected him to at least include New Hampshire on his list of possible flips.
@yiwork13 @Willmvg @gpnavonod @ProformaDen @kaw524 @Tim_Canova @gatewaypundit ???		Pence is first in line.
@MuslimIQ @PrisonPlanet is wrong again. Shocker üôÑ
@Willmvg @yiwork13 @gpnavonod @ProformaDen @kaw524 @Tim_Canova @gatewaypundit And now Pelosi is your House Speaker (and second in line for the presidency). Pretty fair trade tbh.
@oohisis @DerwoodS85 @thehill DEEP STATE! üò±
@libertyloungeUS @PierceJDeWayne @Montel_Williams @libertylounge Ouch, he called you mean names. Such a snowflake.
@Virteaus @sahilkapur Mail in ballots before she dropped out, probably. Her and the libertarian in MT dropped out way too late.
@RalstonReports @AdamLaxalt "Democrats won three tightly contested house seats"		Wut
@ematayka @sophisticaden @GKostun @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I had no idea Non Playable Characters in video games had the power to allege things. Weird.
@WendyD86 @RalstonReports @SenDeanHeller @SenCoryGardner Who do you think would be the best nominee?
@ehartman1975 @lizdickinson8 @jfradioshow @realDonaldTrump @BarbaraComstock Shh, let her try to poorly rationalize her losses with "b-b-but the media!!!".
@theblaze And here I thought lying was a sin, @thablaze.
@CapShower @Nate_Cohn First OK-05 now this 		Crazy day.
@kkondik You bet against Shalala? How dare you. 		(unless you meant FL-26?)
@BillsMafia3233 @StuPolitics What else does she have to do with her time, actually learn Spanish? Pfft.
@Tormentigator @Rush9210 @NintendoAmerica Um, pretty sure @Rush9210 was talking about Twinbee, which is a pretty legit game.
@notlarrysabato But the guys at the Bull Elephant told me there would be a #redwave in Virginia tho üòé
@marcorubio @JohnJamesMI This will be a fun tweet to come back to tomorrow tbh.
@TomiLahren Do I need to grab again the old tweets of right-wingers threatening violence if Obama won in 2012?
@Frankystein702 @AmoneyResists @DonaldJTrumpJr @DeanHeller lol the ratio		@Frankystein702 looking rather foolish here tbh.
@whyamimrpink78 @KyleKulinski @TheDemocrats And I'm still waiting for my Soros check to arrive in the mail for being a crisis actor. What's your point?
@bexexexe @SSBUNews Game is too new to make it into smash tbh. (came out the same year as Xenoblade 2, and in the direct it was mentioned Rex was too new to be added).
@KingCFox Pretty similar to my map. Only difference I have is NV as blue (those early voting numbers spell trouble for Heller) and TN red.
@Browns20181 @Politics_Polls @LarrySabato @kkondik @geoffreyvs @Center4Politics Erm did you see the ratings before these final ones? Multiple toss ups in R column.
@Deses_G @Nick_HBS @JoeMerrick Ironic, Shuffle is one of my favorite ones (and I've never spent a dime on it).		I agree about Dash and Rumble, though.
@Deses_G @Nick_HBS @JoeMerrick Meh, I felt there were more fun and relaxing games (I always found the Pinball games to be relaxing).		Which do you think is the worst spinoff?
@Nick_HBS @JoeMerrick Nah, all of the main series ones look better than this.		However, I would rather die than have to play through Channel again tbh.
@Nick_HBS @JoeMerrick Better to be controversial than objectively bad (like a few other certain games in the series).
@MikeMason830 @BetteMidler #VoteOrange
RT @Welcome2Tweet: https://t.co/Q0hye9QrTn		Dear everyone who follows me,		I made this video in a few hours because this is important to me‚Ä¶
RT @KaiserNeko: I don't care who or what you vote for.		Vote *informed*. Do your best to figure out what is best for your community, your c‚Ä¶
@AndrewCFollett @kkondik Um, Sabato follows me as well here. I guess that makes me special too then?		Though I am curious, since you seem like quite the non-partisan fellow, what are your final predictions? (#redwave)
@ANormalWelshman @Welcome2Tweet I for one think Non Playable Characters in video games should vote as well.
@AndrewCFollett @kkondik ???		50+ is a few? (inb4 lean seats aren't competitive gaiz)
@AndrewCFollett @kkondik Whoa, he got around 1% of house seats wrong? THE HORROR üò±
@Rofflebiscuits @slpng_giants Bro do you even know what a meme is?
@Redistrict üëé
@Rofflebiscuits @slpng_giants Kind of a stretch to call this a meme tbh.
@Rofflebiscuits @slpng_giants Video games tend to have lots of Non Playable Characters, yes.
@TwittaTuna @UpshotNYT @NateSilver538 House projections were pretty accurate in 2016, so rather fair to report them üëÄ
@AndrewSolender A vote for @haide023 is a vote for good for @rihanna.		Pretty solid attack against me tbh.
@DKromNFL @Nate_Cohn The IL GOP is a dumpster fire right now, so may not be that far off.
@bgamron @NateSilver538 I do too for the house GOP's shellacking in a few days.		Can anyone say, "The Future Is Cao"?
@StuPolitics Wasn't he himself threatening to repeal the 14th amendment last week?
@Scot_Eliwood @Is_JoJo_Bitch @1128_Liz_Thomas @Sora_Sakurai Bro this Isaac stuff is very unlikely now. At this point his fans are better off asking for Matthew or Felix. (Though I'm assuming the DLC characters have been chosen already, regardless).
@basketballdawg @EasyMode243 @AntifaFinnmark @MeggyyLeighh_ @JacobAWohl Not true - Hannity seems to be successful.
@luxstrar @EasyMode243 @AntifaFinnmark @MeggyyLeighh_ @JacobAWohl @ComfortablySmug Nah, Smug is one of the most insecure people on this site. Heckle him once, lolblocked.
@Nate_Cohn Smh not WI-06?
@AndrewSolender @UpshotNYT Did that guy just refer to himself in the third person? Wow.
@frodri_023 @MiddleAmericaMe @Politics_Polls @StPetePolls @Fla_Pol VA-02 is my favorite NOVA district that Trump won and then shifted 9 points to the left and delivered it to D's. 		Hey, wait a minute...
@MiddleAmericaMe @Politics_Polls @StPetePolls @Fla_Pol "muh Russia" is about as credible as "muh illegals voting, dead voters, magical DEEP STATE, etc" tbh
@MiddleAmericaMe @Politics_Polls @StPetePolls @Fla_Pol Lol I remember when people said exactly that 1 year ago about Virginia:		Blah blah all polls are biased except for ones showing my guy is up.
@zakiemon #GoombaforSmash
@SykesCharlie As generic as it gets.
@gidgetgyahooco1 @thehill A late Obama robocall is basically the only reason Dems were able to hold the mayorship of St Petersberg last year in Florida tbh
@SpeakingBee @Nate_Cohn Lol be sure not to "Monkey This Up," mirite?
@AlejandroOcasi5 @justreadingdon1 @jrm3417 @christophermah3 @Politics_Polls The irony of not being playable in your own game, I guess.
@HumanistReport I recall the days when that guy wasn't a complete wacko. Seems like so long ago.
@KingCFox Nah, Smash Bros has proven to us that Incineroar is our new God now.
@ChazNuttycombe At least he acknowledges Stewart will lose, I guess? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@littleleonard_ @NintendoVS @NintendoAmerica Proof that this is GOTY tbh.
@mlfoley @Obscurus_Lupa Any idea when my secret DEEP STATE Soros check for being a crisis actor comes in? I need to feed my kids.
@Michael_Zak @StuPolitics Her own internal polls have her tied, so that's laughably bad.		I beg R's to keep spending money here, tho.
@RalstonReports What, if Dems win is the wrong person going to shoot first?
@AlejandroOcasi5 @jrm3417 @christophermah3 @Politics_Polls What game is that guy a Non Playable Character in?
@1128_Liz_Thomas @NintendoAmerica Sorry man, but it's over for him. You may be better off just asking for Felix or Matthew at this point tbh.
@Dust_Off70 @gelliottmorris Saved the photo, will be sure to mock him afterwards.
@charlieo7955 @NateSilver538 @12 I've never seen a lawn sign for a senate candidate before at all tbh.
@GregCaldwell123 @SpawnWaveMedia More like any online game in general.
@andrew_striedl @mcimaps I too love cherry picking polls to support my narrative of my political opponents losing.
@TheAlgamist Geno not being in is proof there is a God tbh.
@joyful_Ally @Redistrict That about checks out tbh.
@JCPrime113 @BreckinMathias @antdude92 Namco making the game and apparently Heihachi being seriously considered for Smash 4.
@Z97147972 @SSBUNews Nah, Goomba and Bullet Bill better be DLC.
@WizardDojo @bigbeezy1212 I love these unexpected troll characters tbh, like Wii Fit Trainer and Mr. G&amp;W. 		Also, perhaps everyone should've paid attention to the whole "don't expect too many new fighters" line from E3.
@Yankees27Alec #BestTimeline
@WizardDojo @bigbeezy1212 I asked for Incineroar, though. Guess I'm no one üò¢
@itsTomokocchi I fully expect some sort of cross promotion with a FE:Three Houses character.
@itsTomokocchi I'd be cool with another FE character if they just didn't use a sword. Give me an Axe or Lance user pls.
@MikeMerriamORG Piranha Plant over Waluigi proves there is a God in this world.
@EchoOrcool &gt;People literally complaining about free DLC		What a world.
@yugiohtas I didn't realize there were non-ironic Waluigi fans tbh.
@SkyBlue_SD @RubyHatori @RogersBase Didn't that guy also mention "Minecraft content of some sort," fellow starter Pokemon?
@TerminaVelocity @MrDemonking30 @CLeituga @CzBacklash If nothing else, I loved the troll game in the direct - de-confirm grinch at the very beginning, then smack everyone with the weirdest possible character that no leaker would've ever believed beforehand.
@PixelWrath84 @Kotaku As it should be.
@TombaHat @SkyLeopard95 @NintendoVS @NintendoAmerica As a lowly Treecko, I didn't even know I wanted Incineroar until I saw that awesome moveset.
@MrDemonking30 @TerminaVelocity @CLeituga @CzBacklash Honestly, there was zero chance of them adding another MegaMan character, unless it was an echo of him (Protoman?). Seems established that one unique character per third party franchise. 		Also for the record, I love random WTF characters like Wii Fit Trainer and Piranha Plant.
@RelaxAlax @YouTube Again, best timeline. I expect to main piranha plant.
@BheemaBachus @CrocoDudeCubed @RelaxAlax @NayrmanBSC Nah, him being in while Geno isn't proves this is the best timeline.
@MrDemonking30 @CLeituga @CzBacklash How so?
@JacCooper1 @yugiohtas Literally my new main.
@BlueSpinosaurus Best timeline.
@NGameTheCube Ivysaur was in Brawl tho
@E1o2Gamer @FadedSaint8 @alpharadtv Incineroar is awesome. That is all.
@NoStrifeGames @alpharadtv This is the best timeline.
@AisforANDIS @Almodelicious Considering I've seen literally a dozen people say what you've said SERIOUSLY in the past few minutes (people even still believe Waluigi will be playable), please excuse my ignorance of your personal beliefs.
@AisforANDIS @Almodelicious 2 of the leaked characters ended up as assist trophies. Lol the salt.
@Nightlingbolt @accicieff @JoeMerrick Um, Goku? I believe everyone is talking about the "Grinch leak," which didn't contain that.
@jimmielynnh @theblaze How dare people not like what I like!!!!11 WITCH HUNT!
@SeemaCMS Just keep digging that hole, lady.
@JacobAWohl At this point I can't even find anyone defend you in your own comments. Sad.
@StandWithSean @RalstonReports @SenDeanHeller This is why I love Senator Joe Heck so much.		Hey, wait a minute...
@DLoesch @benshapiro Hey @benshapiro, why are you making me agree with Dana? What has the world come to?
@IAmKrishanPatel @ericbradner @kkondik Kind of reminds me of Bill Walker recently dropping out and endorsing Begich in AK. His name still being on the ballot means it's too late for this.
@ForecasterEnten Still wanting to see what exactly a Baldwin-Walker voter looks like.
@KiethMessinger @tehoriman @bgamron @NateSilver538 So now you're just out of arguments and result to petty insults when disproven by numbers? Sad, I expected more (not really).
@KiethMessinger @tehoriman @bgamron @NateSilver538 The idea of there always being a "hidden Trump vote" is quite silly, since we've seen polls in more recent races actually overestimate Trump support to their detriment (see: VA-gov polled as D+2, final result D+9).
@subawashi @ForecasterEnten @RalstonReports lol their house projection tho
@KiethMessinger @tehoriman @bgamron @NateSilver538 House/senate projections were very accurate in 2016, so in what way were people (who payed attention) disappointed?
@RichardERoeper Who is she even talking to? Candace Owens?
@midwestmalcolm @Nate_Cohn I'm not even in his district and I see his opponent's ads sometimes, so the Dem must be doing tons of ads there.
@Nate_Cohn The gap seems to mirror that of 48, which is what I would expect. That disparity in approvals, tho...
@EOpen42 @The_Real_Armand @JacobAWohl I always knew necrophilia was a tenant of the right.
@ElRayo76210 @CompersionJane @TheRickWilson Actually sounds like a pretty good country tbh.
@NJCnsrvtive @Redistrict Lol internals
@JacobAWohl Just keep on diggin that hole you're in...
@ARAGUATORAMIREZ @ForecasterEnten lolk
@JacobAWohl I know, like you could ever get a woman üôÑ		(also, lol @ getting ratio'd)
@bgamron @tehoriman @NateSilver538 Polls done by non-partisan polling firm = FAKE NEWS	Polls done literally on behalf of R candidate = #Redwave 		Did I get it right?
@joetweets1987 @ForecasterEnten @FiveThirtyEight Are you telling me he isn't?
@bgamron @NateSilver538 Lol wat		Is this guy for real?
@hmeisler @sahilkapur @NRCC @RepSteveStivers Strip him of his committee positions?
@ChazNuttycombe Are we counting races not expected to be close?		If so, Kaine beats Stewart.
@button_j @EWErickson @jack And yet you're still here.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump If Milwaukee elected you, literally anyone can get elected to anything.
@eli_anci @Lolilolbert @SpawnWaveMedia Crash Team Racing is a great game with no remake tho
@kennypowersKP @2020_kamala @dmode123 @Nate_Cohn How many times does it need to be pointed out that house projections were very accurate in 2016 (about 99% or so)? You can cry fake polls all you want, won't help your case.
@JosephJourdan @DKromNFL @NateSilver538 @JohnJamesMI What matters most in MI right now, though, is Voters Not Politicians.
@JosephJourdan @DKromNFL @NateSilver538 @JohnJamesMI I meant D's having a resurgence in PA and MI after recently losing them (R's had their own in 2010 in Indiana)
@ForecasterEnten When do you plan on declaring your candidacy?
@JosephJourdan @DKromNFL @NateSilver538 @JohnJamesMI Really though we're seeing an R bloodbath in PA and MI so far. Rebounding as hard as IN did in 2010 after voting for Obama in 2008.
@JosephJourdan @DKromNFL @NateSilver538 @JohnJamesMI I guess you can that's...."big if true".		...fine, I'll stop.
@AndrewSolender @seanspicer @GOP Another interesting point - Neither nominee in MO has led outside MoE in a single non-internal poll since February. 		Not seeing the senate #redwave coming...yet (if ever).
@AndrewSolender @seanspicer @GOP Also, Morrisey in WV has amazingly never even made it to the MoE of Manchin in any non-partisan poll from what I can see.
@GaryThurner @NateSilver538 East Virginia.
@toddytails @seanspicer @GOP Don't worry, I hear there's a secret South Dakota senate election this year GOP will win.
@danielgrisinger Nah. The non-playable character nest just talks like this, apparently.
@SeanFromPA @bbash129 @slpng_giants I am just kicked non playable characters as well. 'twas fun.
@hardcorerepubl1 @NateSilver538 And then 99% of house races were called right. Oops.
@donnyreb1 @StephenKing And Voldemort is the R senate nominee in Florida too. Why are these fantasy characters suddenly invading our world?!
@ChazNuttycombe You will only get 20 more TX-SEN polls AND YOU WILL LIKE IT.
@EWErickson Expect nothing less from Project Veritas people.
@DrewSutton20 @Redistrict And the last time either nominee in Missouri has lead outside the margin of error in a non-partisan poll is February I think.
@Norsemen83 @RalstonReports @Peoples_Pundit But what is up with this pollster's ratings? He hasn't updated the house ratings ever, it seems (still using the old PA map, which was thrown out back in January)
@SM4Tech @RalstonReports I am aware, but I was referring to Sunhawk02.
@Norsemen83 @RalstonReports @Peoples_Pundit I'm looking at the site, literally every news story I'm finding is pro-R. 		(Also not sure if his house ratings just haven't been updated in a while, because lol what am I even looking at)
@RalstonReports (Note that he tagged hyper-partisan sources in the tweet)
@MattWalshBlog Reminds me of when conservatives stayed rather silent after a Dem congresswoman had an attempted assassination in 2011 by a conservative guy. 	Both sides terrible, more at 11.
@M_SLAM3 @JohnPlatner @Redistrict Running the table with tossups and extending to multiple lean D's while losing house seats in those states is not too realistic. 		(Btw your +2 list is actually +3, probably switch IN and NV if you want +2).
@JohnPlatner @Redistrict R's gaining +4 is wildly unrealistic currently. +2 max.
@Jak_Riemer @NateSilver538 52% is definitely not enough to save them, especially in 25 and 45. 		You of all people should know fiscal conservatism is dying there faster post-2016 - a tax cut ain't enough to turn 'em out as much.
@SoCalCMH @indiegop @JohnPlatner @StuPolitics Yeah sure. And Dems will win a thousand house seats at the same time.
@SoCalCMH @indiegop @JohnPlatner @StuPolitics There's optimistic, and then there's this. May as well just say +49 while you're at it.
@ArthurDavidPayn @TheRickWilson Hey look, a Rick and Morty fan.
@terryjgreene @amyewalter Yes, it but also has one of the highest percentage of Asians of any district. (24% Hispanic, 15% Asian it seems).		Notably, the GOP nominee has much better favorabilities than the Dem, though.
@terryjgreene @amyewalter Asian GOP nominee in CA-39 was only getting 34% of the Asian vote (and losing the poll in general by 1%) in a district Dems have not won in decades.
@speedobandit @Nate_Cohn Considering that final call made MacArthur go up a point...		Yep, liberal polling confirmed.
@jacobkschneider @SeanTrende @FiveThirtyEight @KarinHousley You seem like quite the non-partisan political analyst.
@il_american @Politics_Polls @ChangePolls @MitranoForNY23 Considering this is generally agreed to be a "Likely R" seat, not a bad result for him (though still unlikely to flip).
@JMilesColeman Only 1 Republican ad?
@MsEnergyHealer @Nate_Cohn Yes, I see this is a rare district in CA where R registration is still higher than D (only 40-36, though)		One thing that should give you hope, though, is that this poll seems to have undersampled women, whom Cisneros is winning by 6%. Isn't it "Year of the angry suburban woman"?
@MsEnergyHealer @Nate_Cohn Regardless of how much people like her, they clearly ain't liking her enough to vote in droves for her. The poll is good news for Dems.		Insane how quickly Orange County has turned on R's, though.
@Corbinclark87 @EWErickson Pfft, everyone knows it was the Deep State and their crisis actors hired by Lord Soros that did it.
@Brendan_Noble @ForecasterEnten "Polls are always wrong except not when my candidate is winning" is a common theme around here.
@SunnyDfan4eva @Nate_Cohn Tied races so far in PA-10 and IL-13 isn't exactly good news for those incumbents (though Culberson seems to be doing well).
@Nate_Cohn Scott Perry losing would make this a rather early night. It also shows just how much a state changes with a de-gerrymander.
@cez_larry @Norsemen83 @kanyeisforkids @DCclone @RalstonReports 2017 shows pollsters also can underestimate Dem enthusiasm as well (In VA-Gov, they predicted Northam+2, he ended up +9 with Dems killing it down ballot too)		Also, Dem president during 2010 and 2014 midterms, so not exactly a one to one comparison there. I guess we'll see.
@Norsemen83 @DCclone @kanyeisforkids @RalstonReports I recall the days of Dems being this overconfident in 2016.		Both sides aren't so different after all, it seems...
@Norsemen83 @kanyeisforkids @DCclone @RalstonReports 55+? Jeez, is there such a thing as being TOO optimistic? I imagine they'll win 200 house seats as well.		You would think 2016 would've taught people lessons about how to read early voting patterns, but I guess not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@kanyeisforkids @Norsemen83 @DCclone @RalstonReports He really believes that, I'm sure.
@DewsNewz You forgot to call them "beta cucks".
@BridgeErick @AggieJack4 @Nate_Cohn And what states, pray tell, do you think they're moving to? ü§î		(Not to mention, your source isn't backing up your claim of people only leaving the state, which the numbers themselves also show is not true...so okay?)
@FCHSBandAlumni @Politics_Polls @MRGMichigan I know, she's definitely up by at least 20 against the Swastika guy.
@ShadyNinja95 @AdamAta64 @yugiohtas I thought he was eaten by giant man eating worms or something in Season Zero.
@Schlubster @WalshFreedom @TheDemocrats Blah blah Deep State, Pizzagate, Chemtrails...
@AggieJack4 @BridgeErick @Nate_Cohn (You would think he wouldn't want people to leave CA, since they'd be "infecting" red states and turning them blue, as we've seen with VA, CO, and now AZ).
@MarkAbrown1361 @WalshFreedom @RealCandaceO I for one am STILL waiting on my Soros check from our Gods in the Deep State after playing a crisis actor for them.
@DeeLunarfox @yugiohtas #Posh
@kyleaustinn @Nate_Cohn Considering CA-45 is currently the second most likely currently R district to fall (after CA-49), you really think all of the vulnerable R incumbents will survive somehow?
@2ADadStanding @benshapiro Those dam dirty dems and their Proud Boys mobs attacking random people in the street!!!!!111
@RandyFcknSavage @TaylorDesloge @Nate_Cohn (I know you're a parody, but FYI Cisneros is Hispanic)
@Nate_Cohn Interesting she's slightly down despite her approvals being a lot better.
@TrumpJew @RacismDog This is a rather odd way for you to come (cum?) out of the closet, don't you think?
@mfjak @Redistrict Yeah, that DAMN D+0.1 Dem bias (per the pollster ratings) is skewing the poll towards those dirty libs.
@douglass_price @Nate_Cohn Republicans gain 2000 house seats and 250 senate seats. #SUPERDUPERREDWAVE
@MookBenRaffy @GOAT_Tobi @Redistrict @ElectionMapsCo @CookPolitical Hey, I'll have you know Tobi is THE polling EXPERT. He knows, as do I, Republicans will win 1 jillion new house seats this year! #Redwave
@lowetze1 @Nate_Cohn @UpshotNYT Ahh, the memories of 99% of house races also being called right in 2016...
@gelliottmorris ...perhaps it's better we just let these people believe what they want? üëÄ
@LastWordWilliam @Politics_Polls @surveyusa @MyNews13 @BN9 Not rly. Most of the polls showing Scott/DeSantis doing well at this point are only their own internals.

@MatthewStiltner @NateSilver538 And yet 99% of house races were called correctly in 2016...
@MattWalshBlog &gt;Superstition over science		You know, these are rather ironic words from a creationist...
@ben_woods15 @Redistrict @TomBevanRCP GOP wins 10,000 more seats because they're just that good.
@WhySoitenly @CoreyStewartVA @chuckwoolery And Hillary didn't even win this state!		Hey, wait a minute....ü§î
@il_american @M_SLAM3 @Redistrict A bunch of them are still spending in VA-10 I believe (unless they recently stopped finally), even though it's basically burning money at this point. Some groups just don't know when to move on. 		Not to mention WV and MT each still have a (somewhat) competitive house race.
@RawStory https://t.co/Jfhbzfm8rd
@ForecasterEnten @FiveThirtyEight Cream soda?
@vepchl @TomBevanRCP @seanmdav And yet 99% of house races were called right. Ouch.
@aloeste36 @alltimehighdebt @nick_field90 @ForecasterEnten And this, kids, is how you attract Hispanic people to vote for you.
@DHood90 @ForecasterEnten Breitbart or nothing.
@M_SLAM3 @Redistrict Considering the NRSC chair has already mentioned his (very generous) expectation for the final results of the election but didn't mention WV or MT at all, I think it's safe to assume they aren't feeling too hot about those.
@elites_the @typerofthings @Politics_Polls @CNN Some people seem to have the mindset of "All polls are fake except for those that have my guy up". Sad.
@Ar15Ag02 @cenkuygur @TheContemptor "I know you are but what am I".

@THEFIGHTINGJAKE @daviddoel @cenkuygur Those Soros checks we get just keep pilin' up, man. It's awesome being a professional DEEP STATE crisis actor.
@JMilesColeman Quiet, you'll hurt their feelings. They went on a blocking spree after people mocked that one VA-05 tweet.
@Rampantlion513 @astevo99 @joyce_tyler @ina_hajek @bennyjohnson And conservatives start street fights with random people in NY "just 'cause".		Both sides are terrible, more at 11. I see you're also a (hyper)partisan hack, so consider changing your ways pls.
@astevo99 @Rampantlion513 @joyce_tyler @ina_hajek @bennyjohnson You realize conservatives killed someone with their violent mob in Charlottesville rite		Really, partisan hackery gets you nowhere in life. Considering remembering that, please.
@RickBaker17 @WalshFreedom Yeah, those leftist "Proud Boys" mobs in NY must be stopped for the good of conservatism!
@ActorAaronBooth I'm glad they took into account third parties, since they may play a role in such a close race.
@MattWalshBlog ???		Always Sunny is a lot darker with humor, and it's still running fine.
@Polit_eurOpines How dare Dems moderate themselves in red states!
@gelliottmorris So according to her Dems hate women, hate black people, hate America in general....		Did I miss any?
@karandikara18 @ChazNuttycombe Looks like "being too progressive" has got nothing on having a fetish for Bigfoot, apparently.
@TastyCa60374227 @TheThomasGuide @AnnCoulter @Politicon Ouch, so mad. I shall report to Lord Soros and alert the Deep State you've declared war on us shadow people! (or whatever weird crap you people seem to believe)

@AbieRubin @kkondik @nytimes Go check their 2016 final prediction on the website...
@AbieRubin @kkondik @nytimes I clearly said house races (you know, the topic of Kyle's tweet). Go check their numbers if you don't believe me.		I know you're likely a hyper-partisan, but damn, reading comprehension...
@alankemp69 @sarahdwire @billpostmus @MimiWaltersCA @katieporteroc @kkondik Can I see said evidence, if you don't mind? I am rather curious.
@kkondik Does PA-14 really count? Redistricting only made them trade a now safe D PA-05 with a now safe R PA-14 for no net change.
@AbieRubin @kkondik @nytimes Considering Sabato called 99% of all house races correctly in 2016, probably.
@Tim_X_ @MattWalshBlog Yeah, probably.
@Tim_X_ @MattWalshBlog I disagree, the "blah blah" variant actually felt kind of cozy at times.
@MattWalshBlog Pfft, the only ones that should be banned are the ones with homosexual relations because blah blah hellfire.
@AnnCoulter So how about that Obamacare repeal, huh.
@DKromNFL @Nate_Cohn I second polls for the former three (not really WV, though).
@RhondaRN62 @LarrySabato @hughhewitt In other words, him and Trump should get a room.

@benshapiro Somewhere in hell, where it belongs.
@Jas_Cassidy Excuse me, but the Anti‚Ñ¢-Christian‚Ñ¢ Iranian‚Ñ¢ Revolution‚Ñ¢ occurred in the 10th generation, thank you very much. I guess you really don't know much about your own country. Sad.
@Jas_Cassidy Nah, I'm further behind. I'd have to look up some uglier mugs to catch up to yours. Any ideas where to look, Mr Iranian Revolution?
@Jas_Cassidy So now you're an Arab‚Ñ¢ Anti‚Ñ¢-Christian‚Ñ¢ pedophile‚Ñ¢? At least you're comfortable with your odd lifestyle, "tho," I guess.
The entertaining people you meet here, man. https://t.co/h7gHSEQWu6
@Jas_Cassidy See, I knew it, a fourth time. Classic Mr "tho".		I do thank you for returning to the insults, though, even if it is a rather tired one, fellow pokefetishist.
@Jas_Cassidy You embarrassed yourself once with your poor reasoning skills, now you've done it *counts* twice more. 	(inb4 a fourth time)		You were better off just yelling "autist" in every tweet, so consider going back to that "tho".
@Jas_Cassidy Yawn. So where's the insults? This is getting rather boring. At this point, Mr. "tho" I'd be cool with you going back to calling me an "autist".
@Jas_Cassidy Trying to justify your poor intelligence with weak excuses - typical for the "tho" guy. Still waiting for new insults, by the way. Just when AI was starting to have fun, too....
@Jas_Cassidy Being lectured on logic by the "tho" guy. Now we're at peak irony - Kudos.
@Jas_Cassidy You really are out of insults, huh? Sad, IA'm having fun.
@Jas_Cassidy Whoa, my name is Syed? I guess I can fool you with anything I type, "tho". 		These Arab Anti‚Ñ¢-Christian‚Ñ¢ leftists, "AI" tell ya - so easy to be amused by.
@Jas_Cassidy Arabic? So now you're calling yourself an "austistic pokefetishist" in addition to Anti‚Ñ¢-Christian‚Ñ¢ Iranian‚Ñ¢ Leftist‚Ñ¢, huh? Pretty sad stuff there. We Conservative Christians‚Ñ¢ pity you.
@Jas_Cassidy Wow, insulting your own words? I never knew Lib‚Ñ¢ Scum‚Ñ¢ Iranian‚Ñ¢ Anti‚Ñ¢-Christians‚Ñ¢ were so self-loathing. The more you know...
@Jas_Cassidy tho
@Jas_Cassidy Perhaps leftist scum as yourself will never learn. I weep for my actual Conservative‚Ñ¢ Iranian‚Ñ¢ Christians‚Ñ¢ allies that must deal with you libs.
@AndrewBond3 @ForecasterEnten It's still ridiculous to say non-competitive, though, since plenty of candidates are currently doing horribly polling-wise (Rod Blum or Kevin Yoder, anyone?) but still not completely out.		If you want a laughably non-competitive race, go watch NJ-02.
@Jas_Cassidy See, now this is a nonsequitor. I guess you'll learn how not to speak like a 5-year old someday, "tho".
@Jas_Cassidy Seems our Iranian Anti-Christian "AI" doesn't know the meaning of the term nonsequitor. Sad "tho".
@AndrewBond3 @ForecasterEnten I guess semi-competitive (as in Lean/Likely R as most non-partisans would put it at) = "SUPER COMPETITIVE!!"? Hyper-partisanship is present on both sides, it seems. Sad.
@AndrewBond3 @ForecasterEnten Still nowhere near the worst pollster tbh.		And I'll take an internal over the alternative (i.e. literally no polling whatsoever in a semi-competitive race).
@sgremminger @ForecasterEnten Not saying they aren't worth paying attention to, but house/senate forecasts pretty accurately predicted those results 2016 despite the top of ticket result, and no interesting shakeups have occurred in congressional races recently. Still worth campaigning hard, though.
@Jas_Cassidy Sounds like quite the compliment coming you, "tho," Mr. Filthy‚Ñ¢ Leftist‚Ñ¢ Iran‚Ñ¢ Revolution‚Ñ¢.
@RichardERoeper If anything, this would only make T.I. more popular.
@Jas_Cassidy Well, we were were already on spelling like children "tho" so I thought I'd get to your level.		And you definitely aren't an anti-Christian Iranian yourself, "tho".
Damn, he mad guys. https://t.co/fV05v1OMNx
@Jas_Cassidy Ouch, insults from Mr. Iran Revolution. My autism is so hurt üòÇ
@Jas_Cassidy Sorry Mr. Iran, come back when you aren't a filthy leftist.
@Jas_Cassidy You'll find out some day, fellow autist‚Ñ¢.
@Jas_Cassidy I'm glad you're admitting your problem, fellow "autist"‚Ñ¢. Fetishes are a sin, so I recommend you get help, lest I show you the ugly face of mercy again		Regardless, I must cut this conversation short. Dont worry, I'll be following to teach you how to be an American‚Ñ¢ Christian‚Ñ¢
@justinbaragona Just another day for the Good Christians at @DailyCaller.
@askaphysicist @joschein @GOAT_Tobi @PpollingNumbers Hey come on now, @GOAT_Tobi is the "POLLING EXPERT". He clearly knows his stuff (like how Hawley is rather screwed according to this poll).
@DewsNewz @oliverdarcy @Acosta lol still buttmad? Get over it already, you lost. Take the L like a man (oh wait...)
@theblaze @theblaze apparently supports defrauding donors. Who would've thought? üòØ
@Jas_Cassidy Literally implying American‚Ñ¢ Christians‚Ñ¢ like myself should care. Kind of goes to prove @Jas_Cassidy is not only not Christian, but also not American. Sad. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Jas_Cassidy Tell me, does this beautiful image look like the face of mercy? In God's eyes, maybe. As for the rest, pretty ugly kid tbh. https://t.co/cLjWPI3O5d
@Jas_Cassidy Nah, you're totally attacking us American Christians‚Ñ¢. Jesus shall smite you for going against us.		(Also, you aren't exactly one to criticize avatars with the ugly mugs in yours m8. Just Saiyan that thou shall not judge lest be judge - a core of my #Christian‚Ñ¢ faith.)
@Jas_Cassidy Well guys, you heard it here first: all American Christians‚Ñ¢ are autistic, apparently. So sayeth the wise @Jas_Cassidy.
@Jas_Cassidy Yet again we see you leftists attacking God. Us‚Ñ¢ Good‚Ñ¢ Christians‚Ñ¢ won't‚Ñ¢ take‚Ñ¢ it‚Ñ¢ any‚Ñ¢ longer‚Ñ¢!!!1111one‚Ñ¢ ‚úä
@Jas_Cassidy Still hating on us American‚Ñ¢ Christians‚Ñ¢ I‚Ñ¢ see‚Ñ¢. I guess Jesus is still being prosecuted to this day by the hateful left üò≠
@Jas_Cassidy @Jas_Cassidy seems to believe us Good Christians‚Ñ¢ are autistic. SAD that we have to endure such hateful bigotry from these leftists these days üò¢.
And this, friends, is what one says when they run out of insults. Huh. https://t.co/DqAfKbEClc
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro Wait, you're autistic? I guess that explains so much, yet so little...
@benshapiro It's almost as if *gasp*		giving the money people donated to him specifically to other people is unethical. üò±
@theblaze @dbongino isn't exactly known for his critical thinking skills ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro And Shalom to you too, fellow Christian. Am I doing this fetish thing right?		Also, that's a cute aside, but I believe I asked you a question, good sir: are you deaf or something?
@Kahnaynay1969 @NBCNews &gt;"Men's organization"		I always knew Gavin played for the other team üëÄ
@JohnGaltOurayCo @NBCNews Well, to quote a wise bot: 		¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro I literally just said since apparently we as a country (as well as a religion) believe it, I must now too in order to remain a good Christian American‚Ñ¢. Jeez, you deaf or something? üôÑ
@decunningham2 @ChazNuttycombe I personally think Scott's problem is Gillum winning the primary - he has such a different coalition from Nelson, and with no third parties on the ballot, the people who only care about Gillum will go for Nelson too (they've even campaigned together, I believe).
@decunningham2 @ChazNuttycombe I'm legit interested - can you still justify him "being slightly up" while losing most polls now?		(I mean, I can tell you're a laughably hyperpartisan person just by looking at your page, but still curious)
@vahousegop @VAHouseDems @BernieSanders @carterforva This bad of a ratio is kind of sad tbh.
@mitchellvii I always knew @mitchellvii never finished Kindergarten, given he struggles this much with shapes.
@benshapiro Kinda ironic coming from you, eh? ü§î
@TossupReport @ChazNuttycombe @decunningham2 I'm not using this poll, only the Florida Southern College one that had him leading (by only 1.5 points, too!)		My point is it's laughable to think Scott is favored at this point. It's clear post-primary Scott has started to slowly collapse.
@TossupReport @ChazNuttycombe @decunningham2 But Scott has only led in 1/10 polls in the past month. Pathetic turn of events for him.		Anyway, RIP @decunningham2‚Äôs hopes and dreams.
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro According to our politicians (and also Christianity), apparently it is üëÄ

@davidmweissman @RealJamesWoods has me blocked, it seems. Pathetic.
@RzNBA23 @EWErickson Good thing each tossup seat is individually decided and not just one big district. In fact, whose definition of "toss-up district" are we using, might I ask?
@Phil_Lora_ @MattWalshBlog Yeah, like Avengers 4! Of course Venom was bad, Sony Pictures sucks at this.
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro Seems like he succeeded in escaping off that sinking ship just in time, no?
@Jas_Cassidy @TomArnold @michaeljknowles @FoxNews @benshapiro Now, now - projection isn't very nice, pal.
@michaeljknowles Idk, man, @realDailyWire and "honest" usually don't go in the same sentence together ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@EWErickson Isn't this kind of ironic coming from the party that is STILL funneling money to @BarbaraComstock, who has even less of a chance of winning?		Hypocrites on all sides, I tells ya.
@MarioManiacYT @NintendoVS @NintendoAmerica So I guess you could say....The World Ends With Her?
@RalstonReports Have any recent polls included him at all?
@jmillhouse @TheRight_Answer @SherrodBrown @BruneElections @McDonalds Well I was just joking. The other guy was probably serious, though.
@EWErickson I don't know, man, the Onion is usually more credible than the Maven. At least the Onion is able to acknowledge they're a joke.
@KIR_bigg50 @WalshFreedom @SenWarren Hey @KIR_bigg50 you going to share some of that kush? Because I, too, would like to start poorly rationalizing why broken promises are okay.
@WolfMoon35 Nah, Decidueye or nothing for gen 7 starters. That "leaker" with the poor record ain't got nothing.
@theblaze So where's dem tax returns @theblaze? I'm in need of more laughs.
@TheRight_Answer @SherrodBrown @BruneElections @McDonalds Hell, if you eat at McDonald's you probably shouldn't be allowed to vote tbh.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Lol, legit scared of random libs winning Texas now? SAD.
@RespectableLaw @donkyourenemies This @RebelACole guy sounds like a real "genuis".
@ColleenGaelic @FancyNancy2018 @marlowstephens @RudyGiuliani lol k m8		https://t.co/IPWd0P9Ntd
@WalshFreedom Then it's probably rather nullified by Trump's words, given his approval have stayed stagnant for months. (Both actually seem to have the same numbers, so I wonder what we did as a nation to deserve them).
@Pkatt Doesn't even hold a candle to my favorite video üòé		https://t.co/tntWfgjs9c
@Fsucoffey @NateSilver538 We already have plenty of polls for the most competitive senate races, but few non-partisan house polls.

@Pkatt @WalshFreedom My favorite liberal mob are the Proud Boys attacking innocents in NY tbh.
@HrishiSomayaji @kumailn Perhaps you, sir, should shut down dude.
@ayasgirl It is rather laughable how much fuss this is causing among conservatives, similar to Kanye with dem libs. 		More signs that both sides aren't so different after all...
@BillsMafia3233 @LarrySabato @benshapiro Rick Scott and Crist were always roughly tied post-primary, so no "hidden vote" (same in 2010 w/ Sink). Braun is down because he's underfunded and too stubborn to use his own fortune (since funders abandoned him).		Cool? Now we're all happy with no dick-ish behavior.
@StuPolitics I always knew Denny Hastert would try to come back someday. üëÄ
@BillsMafia3233 @LarrySabato @benshapiro "Jumped like a jerk" is pointing out you "feel" something objectively false? I guess everyone ever is a jerk.		(Btw your Twiter feed is rather nasty towards "dem dirty dirty libs" you seem to hate, so yeah, I guess some 'Pot meet Kettle' shenanigans going on here m8)
@BillsMafia3233 @LarrySabato @benshapiro (Post primary polls, that is. Also 0 ties).
@BillsMafia3233 @LarrySabato @benshapiro Ouch, my feelings. Since we're all stalking eachother's tweets, looks like you aren't so different from me, fellow ahole üòâ		Feel free to explain your hidden vote theory, though. Looking at numbers from 2010 and 2014, Scott led in half the polls. DeSantis has led in 0/18.
@Politics_Polls @NRCC @BrianFitzUSA &gt;October 4		Yawn. The poll may as well be from 1900 at this point.
@TinaMcGugan @KFILE @VA_GOP		(Btw, I got blocked by telling them to go back to their bigfoot porn).
@KingCFox No one said you had to join a party. Just stay independent and vote for whoever you feel best represents you (or vote third party, maybe, if the two major candidates suck?)
@sfbjax @davidmweissman Therefore money = bad. Just quit your job immediately to stay away from the evils of money (assuming you've ever even had a job).
@KingCFox Why is that, final evolution?
@Nate_Cohn You're biased towards people that are thinking others are biased in thinking polls are biased. Biased.
@VA_GOP If you're really this desperate about VA-05, I take it you've already given up on districts 07 02 and 10? 		Just go back to defending the bigfoot porn.

@TwoKidsIsEnough @Kristinheart64 @davidmweissman &gt;prageru		Is this where the cool kids get their degrees from these days? If so, lel.
@BillKristol Whoa, @benshapiro is a partisan hack?! Learn something new everyday.
@RoyalsE1091 @NateSilver538 This year's map can quickly change, though, at the eleventh hour. No one was really expecting Dem senator Joe Donnelly to win Indiana in 2012 until the last week of October when stuff happened, for example.
@RoyalsE1091 @NateSilver538 Yeah senate flipping ain't happening this year with the current numbers, sorry. Best Dems can hope for is a 50-50 split probably (winning NV and AZ, losing ND)		Of course, numbers can change one month out (October Surprise, anyone?)
@RoyalsE1091 @NateSilver538 Considering multiple incumbent R's have released their poor internals with them losing/in the margin of error (effectively doing this to beg for money), the situation seems rather dire for them in the house.		(GOP Rep Rod Blum is the latest of them https://t.co/tjrdNFfNIg)
@RoyalsE1091 @NateSilver538 And this, kids, is what we call a partisan analysis.		Have you not noticed how the map has redrawn itself in the past 2 weeks or so?
@AbdulElSayed @gretchenwhitmer @SchuetteOnDuty I take it you don't want to move closer to the lamp?
@sethro75 @ComfortablySmug Do you really expect anything short of hypocrisy from @ComfortablySmug?
@alissakmclean @reesetheone1 @fawfulfan @Redistrict Just keep helping the CA candidates you like, since there's half a dozen R held seats still in toss-up. Perhaps specifically aim for Orange County?
@JimSloter @mkraju I'm still waiting on my magic Soros crisis actor check. Any idea when mine will be coming in the mail, @JimSloter?

@slpng_giants @PrisonPlanet is a hypocrite, more at 11.
@MhaoYeager @RealJamesWoods Guys quick question, why isn't this this guy "shadowbanned" or is this conspiracy just another lie put forth to play the victim in a non-existent issue ?
@ForecasterEnten @jonfavs @McCorvic Not so weird this time, since same is occurring with Devin Nunes' challenger.
@RichardERoeper Hey, you were acknowledged by @DLoesch senpai! Not even I've been able to accomplish that.
@jonesen1976 @RichardERoeper lel now tell me more about how much conservatives LOVE Taylor Swift now.		Hypocrites, I tells ya üòé
@mfjak @StuPolitics I disagree with that. FL-26 is more red than 27 (but demographically similar), yet Trump's approvals are about what you would expect there (-15) and Curbelo has a similar lead to this poll (+3). There's clearly something going on with the inconsistent approvals there.
@StuPolitics It's insane how quickly MI has turned against the GOP this cycle compared to last time, that they're just resorting to this level of ambiguity to save face.
@mfjak @StuPolitics I agree, but this specific poll has very suspect Trump approvals - no way Trump's approval in this district is about the same as his statewide approvals.

@morgansam822 @DrEricDing @Redistrict @Ojeda4congress @Sen_JoeManchin @JoeManchinWV I doubt WV-02 can be won - it was the first of the 3 districts to turn red, and will have a decent incumbent. (Not to mention expect it to be gerrymandered during redistricting...)
@RudydeDominator @DrEricDing @Redistrict @Ojeda4congress @Sen_JoeManchin @JoeManchinWV I doubt he'll win with Trump on the ballot, unless some MASSIVE ticket splitting happens.
@DrEricDing @Redistrict @Ojeda4congress @Sen_JoeManchin @JoeManchinWV Or...maybe just run for governor or something? WV-03 will be eliminated after the 2020 census, regardless.

@Dusty_PWV @DanielScott1011 @StuPolitics So...how about that internal Morrissey released today that actually has him losing? Even his own biased polls can't save him, it seems.
@Dusty_PWV @StuPolitics Hey guys, found the McLaughlin defender.		Wonder what this guy thought of Schar's poll from yesterday ("Fake news!!!!!!!!" probably).

@theblaze Glad you're acknowledging your condition, finally.
@WalshFreedom No stranger than the MI GOP thinking Kid Rock will help them get votes. People are weird.
@EWErickson You know, you can't exactly cry about partisan media when you yourself have made a career in making exclusively partisan media. Just sayin'.
@Josh_Finestone @RalstonReports I recall saying that the last few times too
@Josh_Finestone @RalstonReports And Tark is going to win too (50th time's the charm!)
@_BigD1966_ @theblaze And I can't see anything at all with glasses on.
@LSATtutor @AndrewSoboeiro @ForecasterEnten Yeah. I wouldnt exactly trust a partisan source with data analysis. Just reading that article I can see some bias issues (D registration being stagnant = bad? R's are rapidly losing people in CA, a state with 1/3 of seats to a D majority)	I guess we'll see if GCB is biased or not
@LSATtutor @AndrewSoboeiro @ForecasterEnten 2010's map was quite different, though, I'd say - there were plenty of Dems occupying red leaning seats to beat (not really any Reps in blue leaning seats in 2018 outside of PA...)		Also, the GCB is pretty consistent this time, D+7 or 8 , which should be enough.
@LSATtutor @AndrewSoboeiro @ForecasterEnten ???		Of the 40 or so seats ranked toss-up or better for Dems, nearly all of them are R+5 or lower. The only ones more red are those weird races, like WV-03.
@AndrewSoboeiro @ForecasterEnten Yeah, RIP Dems if they can't win NY-01, a seat Trump carried by 8 points.
@ericrenninger @BruneElections I assume he means this crazy 56-32 Tester one		https://t.co/cObCRwRMPu
@brteacher @NateSilver538 You literally think Rick Scott needs more money? Of these R's, the only one I can see in dire need of funds is Braun (since his fundraisers abandoned him).		Also, money is needed only for turnout now. Have fun trying to change voters' minds in the 11th hour, barring scandal.
@brteacher @NateSilver538 It's a little late to be making a fundraising push, especially since most of these people won't need it (Rick Scott already has infinite money, Montana/North Dakota are very cheap states, etc).		So, speaking of people without an ability to think...
@thebestevers @StuPolitics Pretty amusing anecdote you've got there. You're sounding just like those Hillary Clinton supporters you hate oh so much.
@TimTerry2012 @Natsecjeff Or new walmarts.

@Coruscater1 @ForecasterEnten Hey, we'll trade him for Murkowski.

@JohnCornyn &gt;Literally endorsing Dems to win congress now		wut
@TX_lawpony @EWErickson lol thinking Manchin is anything but safe for re-election, regardless. His opponent is barely campaigning.
@Les_Worse @Bencjacobs Well, he's the 4th richest congress member, so he may have some rich friends there to invite to a fundraiser? Idk, still weird endorsement.
@Les_Worse @Bencjacobs What else does he have going on?
@realdeweyeye000 @TheIdesofMark @MattWalshBlog I thought Jeff Flake would be safer, no?
@kkondik Is it not weird people are ticket splitting Brown with Cordray? Would've been crazy a decade ago.
@Nate_Cohn The R nominee in MI-11 seems to be Trump's MI campaign chairwoman, which probably isn't doing her any favors right now.
@conservmillen Yeah? Well you're a poopie-head! 		That'll show you.
@nosajonra @allahpundit Yep, cause as we all know the D's that voted no on Obamacare allowed them to survive to today, right?		Amateur hour, I tells ya. üôÑ

@domedog311 @Redistrict So basically Heitkamp = Heller?
@pbove1 @HotlineJosh @hughhewitt Basically trading Heitkamp's seat for Heller's giving their respective votes. Seems reasonable.
@CoreyStewartVA Is this meant to be a pitch to get people to vote for Kaine? Cause it seems to be working.		(also lol at using @WashTimes as a source)
@Supply4Survival @EWErickson Oh the irony...
@srickerm @kkondik Yeah! And why isn't Florida Lean D? Obv Gillum leading in 20/21 polls means it's leaning towards him or something. He's even got polls having him up by 9 against the "Monkey this Up" guy.
@EWErickson And I have a magical source that tells me there will be 1 million yes votes for Kavanaugh and he'll be so loved he'll become God of this realm and give us all free puppies. And my super secret source is NEVER wrong, so don't question it.

@MatthewMiner3 @JasonBa17205509 @Redistrict Hey, since we're making silly bets, I'm willing to bet no R wins any statewide race in MI this year given current circumstances...unless you think one of them may squeak by? üëÄ
@Nate_Cohn Just do South Dakota. You know you want to.		(Also, who is this guy, since whoever he is apparently has me blocked? üëÄ)
@DeLLBertoo @LeftistRight @FantaMh @AnnCoulter Hey, speaking of killing people in Virginia 		https://t.co/gIEEJ01dwE
@VitalitySteam @Polygon Perhaps just go get whatever 8th gen is next year, since I assume you already have enough experience with 151 anyway.
@connie_msn @NYCSimmons @AnnCoulter &gt;Using a liberal gif to defend conservatism https://t.co/pBoYrGrT8r
@EastCoast_Dude1 @JesseFFerguson Or - even better - just ban gerrymandering so this can never happen again (states are already slowly doing this via ballot initiatives) üëç
@GHalv You're welcome. You yourself were already on said ground with your first tweet, so I am humbled to finally reach your level üòé
@DianeStuffer @StephenBaldwin7 Shouldn't you be "shadowbanned" or something? I guess you all lied.
@GHalv Perhaps someday you'll actually learn to stop being such a pitiful RINO, @GHalv. I'm actually concerned for your ilk. üò¢
@Debo702 @AnnCoulter Hey, I'm in favor of kicking out all guilty people regardless of party. Glad we're on the same page.
@GHalv Pfft, leave it to a pathetic RINO like yourself to not know how to do anything but deflect your own issues on others.		Perhaps YOU, sir, should put down the drugs. SAD.
@Debo702 @AnnCoulter Hey, same can be said for Jim "the Gym" Jordan's pedogate. Why not kick them both out? (Spoiler: only libruls can be guilty or something )
@Kinmanjr @EWErickson Yeah! Elect an alt-right senator in Maine somehow!
@jessalanfields @EWErickson Pffft just more "crisis actors".
@EWErickson Why not try not posting about Kavanaugh every 2 minutes.
@Brad_Hope @EsotericCD Wait so no vote today?
@mmcknight1121 @k_bar_m @jimmy_dore Keeps losing what? R's have had far more embarrassing losses than D's post-2016. But I guess ad hominem attacks are all you have to offer.
@Brad_Hope @EsotericCD Have these 3 huddled today to discuss ideas?
@HynesStephen @Jaynewalkup1 @k_ovfefe @Peoples_Pundit If other words, just a randomly chosen group of people running specifically this year that "happen" to be running in races that "happen" to be generally considered competitive by conservatives (except only not Ted Cruz). Thanks, now I understand üëç
@HynesStephen @Jaynewalkup1 @k_ovfefe @Peoples_Pundit Ouch, that deflect hurt given my first comment was literally replying to the list. Reading hard üò¢
@HynesStephen @Jaynewalkup1 @k_ovfefe @Peoples_Pundit (Literally same thing for the Dem incumbent in Michigan, yet that race is on there, so at least try and stay consistent man üëÄ)
@k_ovfefe @Jaynewalkup1 @HynesStephen @Peoples_Pundit So why would you guys put him on this list then only populated with people in actual "competitive races" then? üòé		(Actually, Michigan isn't really competitive, but I guess you're free to believe you can win that race if you want ü§î)
@Brad_Hope @EsotericCD If so, the fate of everything rests on Manchin alone üëÄ
@catpicsonly1 @jimmy_dore Not like he gives a crap since he's probably retiring from politics forever in 3 months.
@Jaynewalkup1 @HynesStephen @k_ovfefe @Peoples_Pundit lol at Ted Cruz being on this list. The fear of him losing is real I guess for you üòú
@tootlemsfarm @mattmfm lol the sad thing is I think this bot actually believes this üòú
@VitalitySteam @Polygon Yes, make yet another nostalgia-pandering game and not 8th gen üôÑ (there's been like 5 games this gen with only 1st gen guys)
@connie_msn @cnnbrk https://t.co/kCdEPX82aD
@connie_msn @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Come on, where's the fun in that, @connie_msn? You gotta learn to enjoy the circus üòú

@connie_msn @JacksonLeeTX18 Hey, at least you two can have the coke together, @connie_msn üòé
@AnnCoulter (Looks like a certain @connie_msn can't handle the truth. SAD! üòé)
@LeftyMagnet @FantaMh @DeLLBertoo @AnnCoulter Tweeting pics of liberals in gif form now to defend conservatism? What is this I don't even üòØ
@AnnCoulter If there's one thing I've learned with modern conservatism, it's that EVERYTHING has to do with a Clinton no matter what. No exceptions.
@LeftyMagnet @FantaMh @DeLLBertoo @AnnCoulter I don't think ANYONE wants to see Jim "the Gym" Jordan "rise up" on someone ever again. üëÄ		Then again, apparently conservatives support him for Speaker? I guess Denny Hastert's will lives on... ü§î
@Sailingflyingd @EWErickson Yeah! According to the link he even donated to the absolutely unhinged liberal group "Campaign To Defeat Barack Obama"!		....hey wait a minute ü§î
@eyeofthegoddess What exactly is the point of posting something nasty towards someone and then blocking them? Do they just want to vent and not let you read it? üëÄ		(Also, lol at him thinking abortion will ever be 100% banned)
@materduorum @DeLLBertoo @FantaMh @AnnCoulter Ouch, my feelings. These unhinged folks are mean üò¢
@DeLLBertoo @FantaMh @AnnCoulter And the right is apparently unhinged enough to support literally killing people in rallies. But lol, restaurants are the REAL issues, mirite?
@DeLLBertoo @FantaMh @AnnCoulter Because the left is the one threatening senators to vote or "we will boycott the midterms cause muh feelings are hurt" or something.
@EWErickson And what a coincidence - a vote FOR him is a vote for Speaker Pelosi.
@TrvlPrst @StevenTDennis @JonAlienist I thought Heitkamp declared no when her opponent when on a rant attacking all sexual abuse allegations ever.
@afrigrail @EWErickson But...but...muy DEEP STATE!
@BradyAnderspn Do you not think Xenoblade 2 is too new of a game to have characters, given this game's character roster was probably decided 2 years ago (if development schedule mirrors Smash 4's)?

@Gains__ @TylerDinucci @Nate_Cohn These are house polls, not senate polls.
@TranceAndTechno @EWErickson inb4 Murkowski and Flake betray Erick üò±		(Cue "Top 10 Anime Betrayals" music)
@EWErickson Remember kids, a tweet/retweet about a single topic literally every 2 minutes is NOT obsession.
@Skier3737 @GeneralBonkerz @glennbeck @BrettKavanaugh And thus, @Skier3737 just kept up with the mass embarrassment.
@Luke_Freedman @Nate_Cohn Well known (and well funded) R being tied with an unknown first-time D candidate in a district without much of a history of electing D's isn't exactly good result for the GOP imo.
@badguy974 @Nate_Cohn If my guy is losing it must all be lies and everyone else is wrong. üôÑ
@Bmacdaddy33 @EWErickson I cannot find a single person who has tweeted about him as much as Erick, some random guy. Any handy links to said senators tweeting literally every 3 minutes about him?
@Bmacdaddy33 @EWErickson Dunno, but I expect Erick to not tweet about the same thing literally hundreds of times a day now for the past week. Talk about unhinged üëÄ
@EWErickson And literally 5 more since I posted this tweet a minute ago üëÄ
@EWErickson Here is the 23rd time tweeting/retweeting about Kavanaugh in the past hour. But remember, guys, tweeting once every three minutes about something is NOT obsession.
@EWErickson Tweet #13 about Kavanaugh in the past hour. But don't worry, guys, totally not obsessed üôÑ
@MikeBiggly @EWErickson And this, kids, is why conservative comedians are never successful - they just have no idea how to make anyone laugh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@EWErickson Considering you are literally running ads on behalf of Kavanaugh, @EWErickson, something no one else is doing....yeah, you are the obsessive one.
@EWErickson At this point Erick probably holds the record for most tweets about Kavanaugh from anyone on this site. Impressive?
@winojanet @thehill @Sen_JoeManchin ???		You realize they pulled funding because he's already won, right? Even GOP internals have Morrissey down outside of margin and he has little $ left.
@PegT @IanSams @timkaine @nbcwashington @chucktodd You may be confusing former Sen John Warner with current Sen Mark Warner

@sweenprs @NingyMcGingy @ForecasterEnten (Notice how he's denying being thoroughly wrong...I kind of envy that level of max embarrassment tbh) üëç
@NingyMcGingy @sweenprs @ForecasterEnten Shhhh let @sweenprs continue embarrassing himself. It's pretty funny üòé		(And watch out, he ain't afraid to retweet you!!!!!111)
@sweenprs @ForecasterEnten And thus, @sweenprs just kept embarrassing himself further...

@TheJeffBurkett @christophermah3 @EWErickson I see no issue at all with that statement.
@MattWalshBlog So...how many of these "conservative" boycotts have actually worked in the past? Asking for a friend.
@Lawyer_Bill @MattWalshBlog Not really seeing how calling one a "satanic" is meant to be an insult. Actually seems like a compliment coming from someone like Matt.

@RelentlessYapp @Les_Worse @EsotericCD Nah, that sick dab she did during the debate is what truly got the R's in her column.
@Les_Worse @RelentlessYapp @EsotericCD Looking at 2016, 12 million voted for senate, 14 million president, so safe to say most Republicans voted. Given how Sanchez got tons of Dem endorsements, I'd assume most of her votes are Dems as well... so I guess they split the R vote evenly somehow?
@Les_Worse @RelentlessYapp @EsotericCD They all clearly didn't go for the "moderate" Dem in the 2016 senate election, given Harris' large margin of victory.
@kkondik Who are these people somehow voting for both Scott and Gillum?
@PJGJ03 @NateSilver538 Hey, I resent that! I'm much more of a pan than a pot. Get it right broseph.
@PJGJ03 @NateSilver538 Hey guys, we should totally listen to this person. He doesn't seem like a hyper-partisan in the slightest!
@EWErickson If anything, I'm sure you gained some because of it. After all, it's fun to watch this.
@kkondik Having Corey Stewart on the top of the ticket probably sealed her fate tbh.
@DanODonnellShow This is one of the more "Pot Meet Kettle" moments I've seen on Twitter in a while tbh.
@soundhound10 @SheriffClarke The greatest at being easy to fool, maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@jbarro Corey Stewart at the top of the ticket ain't helping, either.
@daveweigel Doubt he'd be willing to run against Sanders.

@douglass_price @atlsportscholar @Nate_Cohn Guys, #redwave is here!!!!!1111oneoneone
@douglass_price @Nate_Cohn Ouch guys, he's totally right. Shut down all polling ever because his proof totally shoots a hole through all of the work done so far.

@TylerJHendricks @daveweigel Maybe they mean the literal guns those guys own are new, therefore "young".
@dagsix06 @lovelylorilips @DonCheadle @Gsquare9 So...how's that minority outreach going? In the most recent big election, Alabama Ssenate 2017, only 4% of black voters voted for the Trump-endorsed Republican. Nice race record there, pal, in among the most Trump-friendly states. https://t.co/xsQ0LLC5CI
@BeastMasterG @SheriffClarke @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump Well, to be fair, they clearly have to have a high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. üòé
@EdenWilds88 @DonCheadle Shouldn't you be "shadowbanned" or something? Told you all it was just bs they made up to cry moar.
@BeastMasterG @SheriffClarke @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump "high IQs"		You must not be familiar with @SheriffClarke, the coward who escaped election the second he got a legitimate challenger.
@dagsix06 @DonCheadle Funny that Dag is continuing to yell about nothing here after already losing to this @Gsquare9 guy. Some people just have no idea how to take the L üëÄ
@Andrei_Long3n @BloodBlossom1 @JeremySwayne @FinalFantasy @Hitsugi_JRPG And that's a fair opinion, but I just didn't like certain aspects of it (like Squall being a little annoying...)		Regardless, as stated, put 8 and 13 on Switch (and maybe even remake 1-6 using Octopath's engine someday üòØ), and then all are happy, no?
@Gsquare9 @dagsix06 @DonCheadle ...and I guess @dagsix06 ran away from your points, so congrats, you won!
@dagsix06 @Gsquare9 @DonCheadle Literally every state in the top 10 states with the highest murder rate has an R governor. Maybe ya'll should consider fixing yourselves before casting stones...
@NabbitFan730 Looking at this guy's timeline, I honestly wonder why he bought a Switch if he seems to hate literally everything about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@BloodBlossom1 @JeremySwayne @Andrei_Long3n @FinalFantasy @Hitsugi_JRPG Now THAT's a funny joke m8. Not saying 8 is bad, but certainly not a top tier game.
@terrian_spears ...I'm assuming you've never played Animal Crossing before üòë		Also, Little Mac is clearly based on the Punch-Out Wii appearance rather than the NES one so I don't know what you're smoking but I want some of it.
@terrian_spears Nah, delete yours if you're okay with some irrelevant puppet from 22 years ago.
@terrian_spears You have a weird way of spelling Geno tbh.
@DukerinoTV @Vernias_T So it's bad to add in a relevant character, and instead they want some puppet from one game 20 years ago? People make no sense.
@thespyofeyes @StupidestTime55 @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY @jessicaramos @CatalinaCruzNY @SalazarSenate18 Ouch, sick burn m8. Took all night to come up with it, mirite?
@EricJafMN @daveweigel Crowley was the definition of a lazy candidate -not showing up to debates, not making many ads or public events, etc		Really, him losing was enough of a wakeup call for Cuomo to blast ads nonstop and leave nothing to chance (which I guess worked)
@FOX4 Ouch, possibly the ugliest ratio I've seen here in a while. Regardless, this tweet is bad and you should feel bad for existing.
@EricJafMN @daveweigel If Cuomo is anything to go by, literally all you need to do to win in NY is to say "Yeah! Fuck Trump!"
@NateSilver538 Note how @ryangrim didn't even bother mentioning who the GOP nominee here is. GOAT analyst tbh.		(But really, I am genuinely interested what this guy's congressional ratings are)
@BillsMafia21 @cenkuygur @CynthiaNixon @ZephyrTeachout Nah, Bagel-gate was what truly killed her campaign.
@JeremySwayne @Andrei_Long3n @FinalFantasy @Hitsugi_JRPG I was sort of joking, since 8 and 13 are both mid-tier FF games.		But they're the only two non-online ones with zero Nintendo presence, so Square needs to get on that.
@thespyofeyes @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY @jessicaramos @CatalinaCruzNY @SalazarSenate18 This "person," kids, is why one shouldn't smoke while pregnant.

@ppppolls I'm legit interested in @davealvord164's explanation how the polling error went the other way in VA 2017 - kind of matters when one literally thinks Stewart has a chance of getting over 40%.
@JohnGoodno @theblaze The fact that men were even watching this beforehand was silly, given the internet exists.
@ChazNuttycombe My guess was you were doing it because of how ME people seem pissed at Collins/Trump recently. Golden's fundraising last quarter wasn't too impressive, so hopefully that's improved too.
@ChazNuttycombe Is there any specific reason you're tilting ME-02 towards Dems? Seems like the most toss-up district of them all.

@BadioHerman @Ryan__McLeod @Ferric242 @kkondik &gt;Only has half as much CoH	&gt;R+2 district, Trump +7	&gt;Running against an incumbent	(Bonus, Dems have only held NY-19 for one term in over 2 decades)		Roughly 100 days out, down by 5 isn't bad.
@BadioHerman @Ferric242 @kkondik 1. Haven't lived in Chicago in several years		2. Bro, I follow campaigns everywhere in the country. You don't need to live in a district to follow a candidate.		3. What I said has still happened (I would think you would know if you were following this race...)
@BadioHerman @Ferric242 @kkondik One thing I've noticed about his campaign is the use of these racial dogwhistles, pointing out Delgado's background as a rapper or something and saying "We don't want these people in our community". So that's unfortunate.		I think the race is tilt R overall, still anyone's game.
@DavidLMadison @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Okay?		So you ever find that link of a Flake endorsement of McSally? That's all I wanted.
@Ferric242 @kkondik With today's news, I wouldn't be surprised, VA's GOP is a mess with Corey Stewart on top of ticket. Already expected VA-10 and 2 to be gone for them (with Taylor's controversies), but maybe Brat goes along with them now too. The VA GOP collapsed so quickly it's a little funny.
@Ferric242 @kkondik Well, D's should look a little south if they want a wave. With the way things look currently in NJ, R's only having 1/12 congressional seats left there seems very possible.
@Ferric242 @kkondik Tenney was down by 2 in her R+6 district in a poll yesterday, which I think is the only seat so far in NY where the incumbent party is losing.
@dotnetchris @Enopoletus @connor_siemien @PpollingNumbers @HarperPolling You don't think more than 1.35 million people voted in Alabama in 2012? Wut		Mitt Romney alone got almost that many votes
@dotnetchris @connor_siemien @Enopoletus @PpollingNumbers @HarperPolling Too bad Morrissey as a senate candidate is looking like a flop, given even this R partisan poll has him losing.		Told you guys Blankenship would've done better.
@Darth_Andrew777 @ForecasterEnten So far left whacko vs far right whacko. That checks out for Florida.		(Nice hyper-partisan analysis btw. Would love to hear your views on other states while we're at it üòÖ)
@JulianRostain @hasanthehun But Gillium endorsed Hillary over Bernie in 2016, so what is this I don't even
@PollySigh1 @bcass1500 @SeanTrende R's ignore R corruption, D's ignore D corruption...		2 sides of the same coin, I tell ya
@tedcruz Ouch at this horrible ratio. What went wrong here for you?		(Everything?)
@supertrump92 @BillKristol Hell is a pretty nice vacation spot in the winters tbh.
@DPOM09141988 @ChazNuttycombe Hotter take: No Dem was going to take down Hogan regardless unless something bad happened with him (or I guess if a mega blue wave happens)
@Tucsonmike520 @ThumperTrump @JeffFlake @kyrstensinema @RepMcSally Kelli Ward and Arpaio were saying she was RINO trash though.
@unstadj Glad to know at least someone knows how to take a joke.
@KShedidnt @unstadj @CillizzaCNN (I guess I touched a nerve there)
@DavidLMadison @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Can I see a source, if you don't mind?

@Neolink077 @yugiohtas @ErikaHarlacher I don't know what you're talking about, ya hoser.

@breezenev @TomiLahren lol too bad Ducey doesn't like her enough to do that
@davidpa28140956 @kkondik 2016 downballot projections were right, so...wut?		Btw, toast is awesome.
@rash_jo @LarrySabato *Ahem* We prefer DemonCRAPs, thank you very much.		(Also lol @ calling others corrupt when 2 GOP congressmen recently indicted)
@HenryThe_Eighth @NateSilver538 I guess that explains why I've been seeing campaign ads for months now...
@CCCALLC13 @WisVoter @SykesCharlie Too bad congressional projections were still correct in 2016, as usual.		Don't worry, bud, you'll get 'em some day. I believe in you üòé
@niacovella @kkondik &gt;https://t.co/NsFgyX7h0d 		Two months ago non-partisan poll had you guys down by 2, now literally celebrating being down by 6. lol have fun losing
@Stonewall_77 @AbdulElSayed Wow, what a snowflake to get offended THIS easily.		(Btw, Lee is a Chinese name)
@Trumpgirl007 @thehill Whoa, I and everyone else can see a supposed "shadowbanned" person. I clearly must be tripping.
@rushadthomas @kkondik Things keep happening in Florida (of course because it's Florida) that'll affect Scott's image (or Dcott?), like yesterday's tragic event. One could argue this makes him look bad, having 2 shootings under his guard right before election season.		(Still, biggest tossup of 'em all)
@BeardedWolfG @Aeg1s54545 @AngryJoeShow I guess at this point we should legalize bombs to carry around - your gun can't stand up to it, and it protects me to a further degree.

@BeardedWolfG @Aeg1s54545 @AngryJoeShow That explains why I'm dead ‚ò†Ô∏è		(Also, smart reasoning - Don't make &lt;insert law here&gt; because people will just break &lt;insert law here&gt;!!!!!!1111oneoneone)

@TimTerry2012 @Gains__ @freidenker1977 @Bilmartighan @UpshotNYT @FiveThirtyEight Hey, it's my boy @TimTerry2012! Have you finally rationalized yet how downballot projections for house in 2016 were 99% correct, or was it all just one big liberal conspiracy?
@ChazNuttycombe So basically we're getting to a point where Corey Stewart may do worse than Jim Gilmore?
@BusterZapatero @benshapiro I thought R's gave up on this story when they found out the victim was a bleeding heart lib or something. Guess not?
@Totally_Legit_T @benshapiro I guess horseshoe theory is true after all.

@JakvarAustin @LarrySabato Big problem is Southern Texas is known for low turnout in midterms
@Polit_eur @BruneElections Ouch at the comparison of favorabilities, though: 36-21 Beto and 45-39 Cruz		Beto being this unknown at this point needs to change fast
@Polit_eur @BruneElections Wow, looks like the poll was dropped a few min ago and I missed it, 49-45 Cruz and R's only +3 in the GCB there		I don't think I've seen a GCB that close in TX this year, so that's helpful.
@Polit_eur @BruneElections As much as I'd love to see that rating changed, I don't think Beto has ever led in a poll yet, internal or not, so maybe wait a bit before moving it.		(I hear a new poll is dropping today, here's hoping he's up)
@ChazNuttycombe inb4 Arpaio somehow pulls out the win in AZ
@TimTerry2012 @UpshotNYT @FiveThirtyEight Considering the downballot predictions were VERY accurate in 2016 (99% of all 2016 house races called correctly by Sabato), I will have a LOT of fun watching @TimTerry2012 come November. üòÖ

@Bellam_ @RealAlexJones Why do you think selling tech merchandise is considered communism?
@Bellam_ @RealAlexJones Oh wait, I forgot, because the magic shadowy DEEP STATE shadowbanned you or something üëÄ

@TarmacblackIX @CoreyStewartVA It's sad that this is like the only pro-Corey response to this tweet. The guy really has no fans at all around here, it seems.
@JMilesColeman Considering this is @charliekirk11 we're talking about here, a guy who's terrible at predicting elections...
@RealAlexJones Why haven't you considered running for congress yourself? I'm sure you'd win.

@glennbeck @jack @LouisFarrakhan Glenn, if you hate Twitter so much, why are you still here? I'm sure there's other social media sites you can use.
@ichoosesafe @thehill Hey look, it's the shadowbanned guy. You gonna use your shadow DEEP STATE magic powers against me that you got after being shadowbanned?
@kyleraccio And this led to an even more anti-Trump guy (one heavily involved in the ACLU) becoming appointed the new AG recently. What's your point?
@JamesClarkNYC @ForecasterEnten @GOP With Sean Patrick Maloney running for both house and attorney general at the same time in NY, he claims if he wins the AG primary in a few weeks he'll drop his re-election to congress and the party themselves are allowed to choose a replacement on the ballot. So I guess same here
@LilyofAssisi @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Just boycott both. Everyone wins.

@mfjak @GriffinTripp1 @Austidog @ForecasterEnten @JWGOP @GregForMontana I agree - as stated above, EV usually leans left, so it doesn't tell us much.
@GriffinTripp1 @Austidog @ForecasterEnten @JWGOP @GregForMontana @NateSilver538 Given this gaffe happened at the eleventh hour, not sure if there's enough time for him to spread the video of it all over the county to undecideds. 		Notably, though, betting markets have quickly shifted 5 points in favor of O'Connor.
@TiberisDonors @ForecasterEnten Libruhls like the outgoing R congressman, apparently. No one seems to have told him this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@GriffinTripp1 @Austidog @ForecasterEnten @JWGOP @GregForMontana Yep, and it already isn't good for Balderson (though early voting doesn't benefit R's usually, regardless)		https://t.co/7AP076Sxu6
@commonman_marty @ChrisMurphyCT But...but...Twitter only silences conservatives and not the mean 'ol libs!
@J34512063 @CoreyStewartVA Hey, Stable Genius Corey clearly said only THREE companies, so your image is wrong. Edit it immediately.
@ForecasterEnten That awkward moment when the outgoing (Republican) rep is from a wealthy town in Franklin County...
@Tottspur69 @daveweigel But his state senate district (and the house district he's currently running for) are around King. Wonder if he'll use that pitch again this year. 		(Also, you sure you aren't referring to his 2010 senate campaign against Patty Murray? I don't think he's ever faced Cantwell)

@l__username__l @RealAlexJones Jeez, after that, what's left to ban him from? Leaving his house?		...let's do it.
@WalshFreedom Idk, why were R's hell bent on repealing O-Care when he was in office, and suddenly don't give a crap now? Because they're trying to save their own hides in November, that's why.		Hypocrisy knows no bounds.

@StanfordBrian @MrSpud @CamDeVille23 @watchandhope @benshapiro Ooh, he'll totally win now. The courts will see the episode where Trump was on and declare him innocent and destroy all tech companies and then hand out free ponies and chocolate and even God will come to smite his haters. I guarantee it.
@George_Weymouth @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Lol, so upset. You know, there's still time to repent in His‚Ñ¢ name before it's too late for you.
@StanfordBrian @MrSpud @CamDeVille23 @watchandhope @benshapiro Lol, I'm sure Mr Can't Even Win a Divorce Case will get far suing Apple. Will be entertaining to watch for sure.
@George_Weymouth @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Such Godly words. I'm sure He's proud.
@StanfordBrian @watchandhope @benshapiro Had no idea political affiliation was a protected class. Weird.
@George_Weymouth @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Isn't Jones currently losing a divorce case? I'm sure he'll get far suing Google.
@hil_81 @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Interesting - when did apple ban bitchute?		Besides, DTube has an app, tell Jones to do his crap there.
@MrSpud @CamDeVille23 @watchandhope @benshapiro You keep guys keep saying that like it's a threat. If I feel censored (spoiler, not enough of a pussy to feel that way), I'll move onto a different platform, which is what Jones should do. Simple as that, free market at work.
@audiosup @praisethepepe @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Just as how conservatives tend to only believe in free market values when it furthers their agenda. 2 sides of the same coin, I tells ya.
@Robeh_ @praisethepepe @TheKevinDent @watchandhope @benshapiro Honest question - why does the free market not apply here? I'm always told business regulation = bad, but in this case, it's good? What industry shall we regulate next while we're at it? I guess use capitalism only when it benefits us.
@watchandhope @benshapiro Can't wait. Like anyone actually who believes in the free market, I'll move on to another platform if it happens.
@watchandhope @benshapiro And? They're a private corporation, it's not their job to protect free speech.

@greenarrowmcl80 @Goodtimes125 @TomArnold @DeniseBradshaw2 @GarthMarlin @Johnnyvulgar @Gavin_McInnes @NRA And Gavin needs to stop sidestepping his ties to white supremacy. Oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@DeniseBradshaw2 @TomArnold @GarthMarlin @Johnnyvulgar @Gavin_McInnes @NRA lol so mad
@Gavin_McInnes Oh look. I finally got @Gavin_McInnes attention.	Now answer the damn question I've posed to you for like a year - HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW ABOUT KESSLER'S WHITE SUPREMACY UNTIL LAST YEAR? There's proof you've been friends for years, so I don't believe you when you say you didn't know
@TomArnold @DeniseBradshaw2 @GarthMarlin @Johnnyvulgar @Gavin_McInnes @NRA @TomArnold I think that lady is equating a random director to a white supremacist who's killed people (and has close ties to Gavin). 		Gavin's fanbase, people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@GarthMarlin @Johnnyvulgar @TomArnold @Gavin_McInnes @NRA At least he isn't besties with Kessler, like a certain someone. Isn't that right, @Gavin_Mcinnes?
@karlwasp @CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump Losing a primary isn't impressive under any circumstance. I don't understand people who say Gillespie lost because he snubbed Trump (who lost the state) too much - do you think the key to victory for Dems in Iowa is hugging Clinton? Obviously not.
@StevenTDennis Her idea to save the state economy was "Oilfield Prayer Day"		Need I say more?

@JW_Watch @secupp Not sure if Hannity is lying, or actually just believing the incorrect info he's stating (FBI spied on/wiretapped Trump campaign, NFL kneeling is because they hate the troops, etc). Considering there's way too many examples of this, it's hard to believe he isn't just lying
@JW_Watch @secupp What's worse, what Acosta does, or what Hannity does? If Trump says the sky is red, Hannity will defend to the death that the sky is in fact red (as will nearly everyone else there besides a select few, like Baier)		I don't follow any of these cable news places, but just sayin'.
@JW_Watch @secupp Hasn't Trump been caught in numerous lies daily? These double standards, tho		(Also, supporting FOX while hating CNN is irony at it's peak)

@AdrienneRoyer @justingodfrey4 @JMilesColeman (Then again, in between Haslam, Corker, and Alexander, TN doesn't exactly come off as a Trump-like state).
@AdrienneRoyer @justingodfrey4 @JMilesColeman But my question is how is Blackburn different from Black? Black just got completely smoked in a GOP primary by some random businessman, while Blackburn will go against a Dem with an extensive business background to a general electorate. Black's Trumpist strategy failed it seems.
@AdrienneRoyer @justingodfrey4 @JMilesColeman A democrat...remembered fondly there. Wow. 		Then again, she's very similar ideologically to Diane Black, who is doing horribly right now among her own base to some random businessman, as we're seeing right now in this primary.
@AdrienneRoyer @justingodfrey4 @JMilesColeman You seem very conservative, so for the senate race do you think Bredesen is running a really strong campaign, or that Blackburn just isn't a good candidate? I'm surprised she's still down in polling at this point when she's had plenty of time by now to get her name out there.
@KodahnBarbaric @IdiotTrackerWlf @benshapiro @RacismDog lol, someone is upset
@IdiotTrackerWlf @benshapiro Hey @RacismDog, this guy is trying to steal your thing.

@hasanthehun Looking at his endorsements, none of them are considered "safe" for November like Ocasio-Cortez is (except Gavin Newsom for some odd reason).		At least he endorsed some Justice Dem/Our Rev people I guess.
@El_Morto @Gavin_McInnes I mean we know Gavin just owned himself, but jeez, no need to be so mean to him.
@AdmiralWaugh Yep, him outraising his opponents several times over in 2010 and 2014 AND having a red wave behind him both times allowed him to win by massive margins both times, right? (oh wait üòé)		Also, looking at RCP, they count partisan polls (Chamber of Commerce), so very helpful metricü§£
@AdmiralWaugh Every recent poll I'm seeing has them within the margin of error, despite Rick Scott having spent over $18 million already.		This is a really sad tweet, I tells ya. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@daherr10 @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump Nope. Only one real conservative in the race. 		#Arpaio2018
@SeanPaige @jaredpolis Considering Stapleton was both endorsed by campaigned for by the unpopular Dubya himself, I see no damage here. 		Also, Stapleton is currently losing by every metric available (money, polling, name recognition), so....yeah.
@blueWRL @daveweigel An endorsement in Texas may actually hurt Beto, whose success is partly due to national Dems staying out of this one.
@ClaudiaLeFevre1 @LarrySabato He was rather correct in 2016 about downballot, so ???		But humor me, what are your "guesses"?
@POW1290 @HumanistReport Let's pretend all of them vote against him - that's still only 49. Still need some R's to flip.
@HumanistReport @SenSchumer So, any opinion on how to flip 2 R's to vote against him? Irrelevant if all D's vote against him since there aren't enough.
@JacobAWohl Roy Moore says hi @JacobAWohl
@fred_tx23 @GregAbbott_TX @PeteFlores_TX The seat just swung left 8 points from the previous election, so I'm sure Hurd is feeling the heat, given it takes up most of his district (he already was before, as shown in his Op-Ed HEAVILY criticizing the Trump-Putin Summit). Regardless, will be a very fun race to watch.
@fred_tx23 @GregAbbott_TX @PeteFlores_TX It won't really flip any, though, considering he's still to the left of the R.		Not to mention, Southern Texas isn't exactly a bastion of progressive-ism (all of its D congressmen are Blue Dogs) so your claim of lefties hating moderate D's there doesn't work.
@benshapiro So baseball = only for communists?
@fred_tx23 @GregAbbott_TX @PeteFlores_TX Dems in total got roughly 60% of the vote in total. What's his plan to get Dems to flip to him?
@steev_reevz @BillyBaldwin Sounds like a compliment coming from you.

@benshapiro Is his claim true, though? If so, that is an incredibly weird use of your time (maybe not as weird as Bigfoot erotica, but still).
@RepublicanDore @EWErickson @GOP Not surprising, since that's what's currently favored by forecasters it seems (though only a small expansion in the senate)
@Theshells1111 @thehill ...have you looked at this guy's Instagram? There's waaaay more than one pic. And here I thought R's cared about character. Guess not. üòé		Also, Corey Stewart was already disavowed as a candidate by the RSCC for white supremacy, so yeah.

@PokeGOfficial @Broshadian @Gavin_McInnes I'll leave with this - these two have been proven to have known eachother for years (at least since 2013), so I don't understand Gavin's claim about not knowing about the white supremacy until at least 4 years later. Also, wow at this		https://t.co/7ADV15CgWr
@ProudBoyForever @PokeGOfficial @Broshadian @Gavin_McInnes Since you're a PB, would you have any insight on how long Jason and Gavin have known eachother? It's difficult to hide something this big if you've known someone for a while (not to mention just watching Jason on camera you know something's up with him specifically)
@LibraVariable @AnnCoulter So has Mexico paid for the wall yet? Time's a-wasting...
@PokeGOfficial @Broshadian @Gavin_McInnes I was actually more conservative (and apolitical) years ago, but became more liberal over time. Btw, not here to have a political argument or anything. I doubt anyone will change any views here, so lets all just get ready for Smash Ultimate already.
@PokeGOfficial @Broshadian @Gavin_McInnes Kessler was a noted former Proud Boys member and white supremacist who made the charlottesville rally. Gavin apparently claims he and his organization didn't know about the white supremacy part, I don't believe him.
@PokeGOfficial @Broshadian @Gavin_McInnes Never forget Jason Kessler.		(Also btw, very awkward when we both seemingly have similar personal interests but strong political differences. Octopath is amazing).

@SShammas27 @IGN @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN I don't think EA made the original battlefront games, so they're the problem (usually rated among the worst companies in America for a reason).		 Inb4 Disney lets them make a horrible KotOR sequel
@SShammas27 @IGN @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Hey, it's fine if that's your opinion. I am barely able to sit through any of them without getting bored, though (besides the rare cool lightsaber battle). I think Star Wars is being more destroyed now in gaming than movies anyway (Battlefront 2 is garbage, thanks EA)
@SShammas27 @IGN @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Not really. If you're referring to the franchise being bad right now, I'm sure it'll improve some day. It's still higher than the prequels, at least.
@StrategyBeast @starwars We never forgot the far worse prequels, so nope ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@myster_E_23 @ForecasterEnten They polled the expected nominees, so I see no issue. For the few tossup primaries left, they tested against both possible nominees too.
@SteveKl00655958 @EWErickson Just our ideas on tackling the issue of abortion. I'm sure we differ on other issues as well, but I think this was a nice conversation compared to uglier ones that occur on this site.
@SteveKl00655958 @EWErickson I agree with your assessment. It was nice having a civil conversation with someone with very different beliefs with me. Perhaps nasty partisanship divides us all more than we even know...
@ActorAaronBooth Honestly surprised he hasn't declared a write-in candidacy yet.
@SteveKl00655958 @EWErickson More likely due to them being the internet/social media generation, the internet being the most anti-religion place in existence. Also not helping that once respected religious figures are gushing over Trump despite him not exactly being a model Christian, as Erick often states.
@SteveKl00655958 @EWErickson Religion is dying among Gen Z, so telling them to stay abstinent won't work. Abortion will never truly go away (even if banned, back alley ones will be the new norm), but it can be greatly reduced, which can be accomplished by proper education. Here's hoping people realize this.
@SteveKl00655958 @EWErickson ...have you ever met a modern teenager? Preaching abstinence only works if they're super religious (which very few are).
@RedPillBlack2 @Ocasio2018 Which party was supporting Joe Paterno 2.0 staying in office again? üòé
@EWErickson The fact that sex ed is being taken out of schools makes it rather difficult to teach teens how to practice safe sex. It's a fact of life teens will have sex, so may as well teach them how to be safe and not get pregnant ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@SICHLBarons @johnlegend @AndyRichter At the very least, once he becomes (minority) leader, he'll never get much done since the accusations will come up daily.
@pissedoffctdem @ForecasterEnten It'd be Malloy's unpopularity vs Trump's unpopularity. Lamont can at least distance himself from Malloy by saying he opposed him back in 2010 before it was cool, while no R can escape Trump at this point.
@TheRickWilson You mean Minority Leader Joe Paterno 2.0. Would be a dream come true for Dems if he was the R leader.
@LowLevelGeorge @WalshFreedom I see Joe Paterno is still in congress for some reason. I hope to see him become the R leader after Ryan leaves.
@HotlineJosh @ForecasterEnten @TheMayor3 What about WI? I can't imagine people ticket splitting for Baldwin and Walker - they're like complete opposites.
@SeanCasten Come on, let's dispel the notion Marco Rubio doesn't know what he's doing - he knows EXACTLY what he's doing.
@HouseCracka Hey, wouldn't you rather have an R that's voted with Trump 92% of the time than a D that'll vote with him 0% of the time?
@ChazNuttycombe @gretchenwhitmer Who do you think is the weaker R nominee? Calley is closely tied to the unpopular Snyder, but Schuette has a bunch of possibly exploitable controversies.
@HouseCracka @AnnCoulter @KevinYoder Clinton actually won his district, so I guess he's doing what he needs to in order to survive.
@Kona_Kevin @tkdcoach @AP4Liberty In other words, fight for the liberty of one person by limiting the liberty of another. Sounds very counterproductive. 		(Also the Libertarian Party is officially pro abortion rights, but anti government funding of it in general)
@Kona_Kevin @tkdcoach @AP4Liberty As a sidebar, since we're talking about issues, can you explain Austen's abortion stance? Is he just against government funding of it, or completely 100% against it? If it's the latter, not very libertarian of him to call for government regulations on people's bodies...
@Kona_Kevin @tkdcoach @AP4Liberty It sure was art, given Austen (a literal art major) is literally trying to lecture a veteran on freedom üòÖ
@NO2USPLUTOCRACY @paulajean2018 Sore Loser Law says no. She can try write in, but wow will it be a circus since Don Blankenship is considering the same (he even got an endorsement from the Constitution Party!)

@kkondik Do you think this race is still a toss-up?
@OriginalBad @LarrySabato @kkondik I remember them doing this "dirty thirty" thing in summer 2006 (30 most competitive seats at the time, disproportionately in Dems favor, as expected for '06)	https://t.co/PofgUdxm4m
@ChanceTheTweetr @thatlawyercat @ThePlumLineGS @LarrySabato @kkondik I'm counting 5/435 house seats wrong in their final 2016 tally, so they got 1% of house races wrong.		(Btw, there were more than 8 senate seats considered "competitive" in 2016, so no idea where you got that number from)
@mel_huang @kkondik Carter's opponent has raised way more money than him so far, and also went viral a few weeks ago with that ad of hers highlighting her veteran background (kind of like Amy McGrath).		Carter will probably win, but something R's shouldn't take for granted now.
@DonnieLeach1 @benshapiro Never heard of him.

@NotTheDnc @MarkusJRussell @martinipr0blem I'm a big Bernie supporter, but he voted for Mattis, Kelly, and Wray (Mattis especially being disappointing).		You seem to have a really weird hate boner for Dems, so I'll leave you before you devolve into yelling about crap like "the deep state". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@NotTheDnc @MarkusJRussell @martinipr0blem I saw Bernie Sanders vote for multiple of those nominees, so not helping your case. The Dem who's voted the most anti-Trump so far is Gillibrand, who is (as the cool kids say) a "corporate shill".
@kkondik @geoffreyvs Georgia is still likely R?

@silroc1988 @davidhogg111 Putting on your tinfoil hat to own the libs. That's a new one.
@OGValnas @NateSilver538 The poll also states that voters (highlighting especially Dems) prefer candidates with political experience 59-30. The progressive wing of the party probably would've been better off running a state rep or something rather than a random actress.	(I would still vote for Nixon tho)
@Vilestyle @ForecasterEnten Site is also filled with hardcore conservatives, so not seeing your point.		Not to mention Twitter ended up being more accurate than polls on NY-14...
@gelliottmorris I think voter enthusiasm matters more than voter likelihood (as seen in the PA-18 special), so I'd put more stock in GCB myself.
@JacobAWohl Yet another @JacobAWohl tweet that's been ratio'd? Didn't know it was even possible for a person to be THIS hated by their own peers.
@debitexpenses Mark Dayton won his primary despite losing the convention, so I don't think the convention endorsement matters much at this point.		Not to mention it doesn't look like Erin can win now with the entry of Team Swanson...
@CindyVVideo @People4Bernie Trump only won 20% of the vote, so pretty pointless for R's to even try here. (Clinton actually did better in Wyoming than Trump did in NY-14)

@MaxPower_007 @JAllen_BR @ForecasterEnten Considering last month Trump was at -16 net approval in NJ (not to mention his national approval is only 42) I agree with that. Best to wait for more polls before considering that option.
@Peoples_Pundit @GravisMarketing The part of the Gravis poll confusing me most is the 47% approval rating, though (was -16 net approval average a month ago). Any possible explanations?
@TomiLahren ???		Literally majority of GOP congressmembers are condemning Russia today, many saying collusion. 		(Then again, this tweet was from someone mature enough to complain about having to get a job at age 21...)
@YourBoyRoyP @richardjay73 @RealAlexJones Clearly he meant 5 trillion people.
@ActorAaronBooth Do you think the party might force him to step aside if these numbers continue (like with Torricelli)?

@robsolonhamer @shannoncoulter Actually a smart move by them - force a competitive primary to drive up voter turnout. Feinstein will win in the end probably, but more turnout = more downballot wins.
@KevinMcGil ???		This seems pretty smart to me. Forces a competitive election for senate (with only 2 D's allowed on the ballot), driving up voter turnout on the left, helping a ton downballot. R's won't turnout, since they'll just perceive both to be the same.
@CFCFanForever @ccadelago @CA_Dem Speaking of politicians with #MeToo problems...		https://t.co/5xqJLdsNUh		In between this guy and Jim Jordan, looks like R's have their own swamp to deal with.
@NickJFuentes Wow, this tweet is a complete trainwreck.
@CathoConser @thehill Some D's voted for Trump, so I don't understand the point of your first statement?		And I'm sure Bush was just "unlucky" with his big recession, if we're all honest. God just felt like playing a prank that day on him.
@CathoConser @thehill I guess that explains why even some R's concede trickle down is garbage, mirite?		(Also, if you want to judge a president by economic growth, I guess Clinton is the greatest president of all time or something)

@villavec @theweaselborne And that's something nice about Clinton losing: it'd be an absolute bloodbath for 2018 Dems if she had won (at least in the senate).
@theweaselborne She seems to be in the same camp as Jeff Flake: doesn't want to be in "Trump's" GOP.  If Hillary had won, I think she'd go for it, though.
@theweaselborne @ForecasterEnten I'm doubting Collins runs again in 2020, so she might just go into "idgaf mode" soon.		Also, her voting for Gorsuch but not Trump's second pick isn't impossible (Ben Nelson did this for Dems not that long ago...)

@ParemQuern @KyleKulinski @YouTube I'm pretty sure Schumer is telling her to say this. Since these senate leaders aren't "elected" (and Sinema definitely knows this), she's just paying lip service to her red state voters to help her win.

@ParemQuern @KyleKulinski @YouTube ...he hasn't been leader for 10 years?

@SistroMondain @NateSilver538 Always gotta love how R's auto assumed Al Franken and Eric Schneiderman were guilty, but Roy Moore, Jim Jordan (and now Curtis Hill!) were demonized by the "unfair liberal media üò≠!!!!!!". Hypocritical conservative is a redundant term, etc.

@theblaze Because it sure is a good idea for Heller to bring Trump into a state that he lost üôÑ		Seriously, in between this, not helping his poor fundraising, and taking away the recess, it's as if they want Heller to lose now or something.
@dznyc @jordainc @StevenTDennis They also really tried to push that story about Tester slandering a soldier or something, and no one even remembers that anymore today (much less in November).

@Jon19911100 @kkondik Speaking Spanish in campaign ads =/= Hispanic outreach. Marco Rubio refused to campaign against Nelson, and recently former Gov of Puerto Rico endorsed Nelson.

@moolah59 @BobbyBigWheel Dems collapsed downballot everywhere in Nevada in 2014 from lack of good top ballot candidates, so not really a good measure. Just comparing their performance today and fundraising should tell you what you need to know.
@righty64 @EWErickson North VA = government workers	Saw articles this week about people working inside the white house calling it a miserable place to work, so that about tells you how bad it is for R's to win in that area (RIP Barbara Comstock).
@righty64 @EWErickson Might have been possible with a better candidate, but still definitely not worth the time/effort. GOP has much better targets this year.
@danshinmachine If you look at the map the bay area is the north part, and is the population center (so automatic liberal). Population centers in the south one are Orange County and SD, neither of which the Trump Party did so hot in. Sounds like a trap to give D's 4 new senate seats.

@4Empowering Drat, you're right! It's not like R's literally just tried winning by targeting Pelosi, and lost bigly in a +20 Trump district. Why, that would be absurd! üòé	https://t.co/l5hFVGa8hT
@robsolonhamer Dems are probably better off if Reps let their guard down with the disarray narrative (see: Virginia last year).
RT @rockrichard: Tomi, I carried a man onto a C-130 in a flag draped transfer case for his final trip home. You‚Äôre full of shit. Stop using‚Ä¶
@4Empowering Considering R's were locked out of a total of 13 races yesterday (not counting state legislative races) while Dems none, look like the red wave will never come.		However, I shouldn't crush your dreams, so heck, all Dems will lose, even the ones unopposed! #MAGAFOREVER üòÅ
@4Empowering At the same time, Republican state rep Rocky Chavez vacates seat, and two Democrats win the top 2 primary, ensuring they'll win a new seat, meaning supermajority is back in a few months. Whoops ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è		For extra laughs, one of the two is literally named Elizabeth Warren.
@Que_Peso @eshaLegal Not to mention you're missing the obvious fact that President wanting something =/= entire party wanting something. If Bernie becomes president, good luck getting 60 to agree with single payer.

@PalinInspiresMe @Politics_Polls @ppppolls @GiffordsCourage &gt;Says no one mentions them anymore	&gt;Literally mentions them in this tweet		???
@chuckwoolery Lol, I know you're pretty slow, but R's were just locked out of a race for retiring R incumbent Chavez's seat, meaning a D is guaranteed to take it, and super majority is back in a few months. üòé
@strudel_king @brownybear13 @Gavin_McInnes I know, I totally destroyed that dude. He'll still be feeling it tomorrow üòé

@Gavin_McInnes Random white girl = entire countries. Got it.
@HoarseWisperer (He also conveniently failed to mention the large amount of R lockouts, like senate and LG, meaning even if Cox somehow won he'd be forced to have a Dem as his lieutenant).
@theblaze Isn't this beneficial to Dems? A lot of these young tech people who would usually go to CA are now going to places like TX and GA, bringing their dam durty lib ideologies with them. Why do you think GA is suddenly getting a lot less red?
@Billy_Nev @HumanistReport Hey, we've seen the establishment candidates be upset twice in these congressional primaries so far (NE-02 and KY-06). Perhaps Vilela will be the next one to do it next week.
@ForecasterEnten @Redistrict But is this happening because they like Valadao, or because of super low turnout? I guess 2020 redistricting will tell us.		Valadao may as well be the R version of Collin Peterson.
@KyleJMayhugh @JMilesColeman Yeah I know, but when I posted that I was kind of tired and read that as 48, not 39 (it's been a long night tonight, am I right?)
@JMilesColeman As a long time incumbent, Rohrabacher only got 30% of the vote here in the primary, so that's not looking too good for him.
@ChloePolitiCat @HumanistReport I'm agree with @ChloePolitiCat. It's on the voters to pay attention and vote out people they don't like. Term limits keep out the good politicians (as rare as they are), and also only bring more money into elections.
@HumanistReport In other news, water is wet. Very obvious an incumbent get first place, only thing that matters is who gets 2nd.
@HumanistReport Bernie's been in congress for almost 30 years, so I guess he wouldn't be with us if term limits were a thing.

@OneKids @NateSilver538 I guess I am just a bit more wary of polling these days after some surprises over the years. Anyway, thanks for the info, and can't wait to watch 'bridged 29!
@OneKids @NateSilver538 I've noticed they've been very inaccurate in the past year and a half (never forget Virginia being a tossup on election day, only to become a wave). I see Monmouth has an A+ rating on 538s pollster ratings so I guess this is a good poll. Surprising to see an incumbent R like this
@OneKids @NateSilver538 But what constitutes as "LV" at this point, after 2016 and this new environment changed the rules of voter turnout? I honestly wonder if these polls are taking this into account.
@OneKids @NateSilver538 I had no idea you liked politics too üòØ		In my opinion, at least, special elections are all about that enthusiasm gap, something generic ballots don't measure. Just look at how much Dems were loving Conor Lamb....and Reps weren't liking Saccone.
@ActorAaronBooth @debrahilstrom @keithellison Wait but Matt Pelikan won the endorsement, so wouldn't he be favored to beat her in a primary? (not knowing much about him, besides he's an "activist" candidate, not sure how strong he would be in the general).
@ActorAaronBooth @debrahilstrom @keithellison Who is this @debrahilstrom person and how strong would she be in a general?		Regardless, I want Keith Ellison to stay put in congress, where he'd be strongest.

@paganpopulist @MDHtoo @JoshAlterity @Tamaraw68415067 @JoePCunningham Never forget, polls are only real when they say you're winning (see VA gov and AL Sen last year for times GOP suddenly starting liking polls only to be crushed later)
@JO_clever_KE @multitasker333 @yashar @CNN ...and he ran away.		Good work.
@PreetBharara @RonanFarrow You should run for AG there this year.
@BeanManBean @ka_mirco @SmashBros_Nin Would still be a good way for them to make up for that awful Marvel vs Capcom Infinite game they hyped up at last year's conference.
@BeanManBean @ka_mirco @SmashBros_Nin Inb4 their conference is just finally announcing Phoenix Wright for Smash.
@GigiLindley @PaulBabeuAZ @realDonaldTrump @politico Establishment doesn't deserve to win a new seat if they're going to keep undemocratically interfering in primaries.
@GigiLindley @PaulBabeuAZ @realDonaldTrump @politico I had no idea Cocaine Mitch had another Twitter account #Blankenshipmentum
@LightTheMetro @HT3Show @SethMacFarlane Just to note, Obama never actually won PA-18 (he did terribly there even in 2008) which is why that special election was such a big deal.
@PeterPlangger @RepDavidValadao @SpeakerRyan Well, that extra $1.50 in my paycheck allowed me to get a CostCo membership, so clearly capitalism is boss. üòé
@HT3Show @SethMacFarlane By your logic there's no reason to even vote as a Republican in, say, California - your vote will never count for anything since Dems will always win the state, and your vote will technically be going to them anyway.		Thanks for the petty insults, though, I guess?
@LightTheMetro @HT3Show @SethMacFarlane Seems Trump's policies on trade are screwing them over more, considering PA-18's result. Trump managed to help Dems win in a way that not even Obama was able to.
@HT3Show @SethMacFarlane ...so nothing changes?		I didn't realize Obama was appealing much to rural voters in swing states when winning in 2012. Also, as I said, a rural coalition is not enough to win in several states (3/4 of the Nevada's population lives in Vegas metro, for example).
@HT3Show @SethMacFarlane I never understood this argument. Even in the current system several states have one population center that is so large you win the state if you win that area (New York, Illinois, Nevada, etc).
@Scathing_Walrus @aseitzwald @maggieNYT @ComfortablySmug I'm surprised Smug is even still on Twitter with that thin skin of his.
@HadItWitYou @tedcruz @davealvord164 You mean the race where over $50 million of out of state money was spent attacking him, and yet he still won by 12 points?		Face it, Ted Cruz is a hypocrite for crying about out of state money. (Also, lol @ Cruz somehow having $1 million less cash on hand than his opponent)
@BearNamedGreg @KyleKulinski But as VA gubernatorial taught us last year, Ralph Northam, a candidate as boring and generic as it gets, won in a big landslide without much of a platform beyond "F Trump". This strategy will definitely not work everywhere, though, since that Charlottesville thing really hurt Rs
@BearNamedGreg @KyleKulinski I'm not really seeing any specific congressional candidates speaking about Stormy Daniels/Michael Cohen/etc.		As we've seen in PA-18, if Dems want to win, they need to keep arm's length from candidates and let them do their own thing, since they know their own district best.
@lauraMcc1422 They let Roy Moore win a primary once.
@scottwongDC Is there even a way for him to get around the sore loser law there?
@BearNamedGreg @KyleKulinski ???		Were there any significant losses post-2016 I've missed?
@mickarran @RantsByDesign @Priapos93 @JoeyMinnesota Hell, the R leadership does it on their own side too. See how they're trying to force out Blankenship in WV's senate primary (which I think is only making him stronger, like with Laura Moser).
@gelliottmorris This is the most accurate usage of this meme I've seen thus far. Kudos.
@raveninak @IronStache You guys find someone yet to finally beat Don Young?
@CTIronman @SeanTrende Negative 100% 		Schumer and Pelosi were smart enough to not set foot in Alabama for Jones, so I think they know not to go the WV either.
@MagnetCarta @AndyYork8 @SeanTrende Even if Manchin switched parties, I doubt his voting record would change much, which is overall around 70% with Dems.
@SeanTrende Just like 2012 all over again with Akin/Mourdock
@DavefromTO @SeanTrende Not sure about him, but I'd say Tester is best.
@MacBethSpeaks @DNC @dccc @TheDemocrats @SenSanders ???		We just saw a guy become Governor of Virginia in a landslide win without saying much besides "F Trump". It clearly works in some places.
@FreakingCorey @FiveThirtyEight #Blankenshipmentum
@puck2da_head @RollingStone So he's basically Ted Nugent's long lost brother?
@joesilber96 @GOPChairwoman @GOP @MorriseyWV No, @RepEvanJenkins is stronger.
@joepenguionix @LumpyLouish Not like it matters, Blankenship would vote exactly the same as the other 2 running in the primary.
@david_darmofal @ForecasterEnten How about Senator "Up By 10 Points" Roy Moore?
@arveela @FoxNews The GOP nominated a literal Nazi in IL-03, so probably not.
@RedemptWarrior @jmartNYT Lol k.		Humor me, which 9 new senators can we expect to see next year?
@b_jenabum @BillKristol You seem to given you took the time to come here.
@james_mathurin_ @MetalLoner @hopenothate I mean no one is owed speech on this platform specifically. Besides, still no evidence of specifically conservatives being silenced (I see a host of "social justice" liberals also complain about censorship here). This guy just likes playing the victim.
@MetalLoner @james_mathurin_ @hopenothate No one here owes you free speech. If you don't like it, you may be better off leaving (Milo sure seems to be better off right now üòÖ). Reminds me of a quote once stated by a great philosopher:	"Shut up and dribble!"
@MetalLoner @james_mathurin_ @hopenothate &gt;Sargon	&gt;Knows facts		LOL. Was happy to help him get suspended again tbh.
@ruralj Better yet, all these people attacking him allows him to say the "librul media" and establishment hate him, allowing him to pull a Trump-like victory.
@WallflowerCanyo @Arcanroc @Legend_Marston Who cares when it comes out? Smash is out this year, which is all that matters üòâ
@digitMusic @politicoalex @DonBlankenship @realDonaldTrump Didn't he originally chime in against Roy Moore as well in his primary, only to support him later? Both are felons
@EstherKarenFre3 All politicians are criminals. That's a fact.
@LumpyLouish @billyjoecain @_SemaHernandez_ @BetoORourke People who don't care to do any research like yourself are why we who are supporting this bill aren't taken seriously, so thanks üò¢

@billyjoecain @LumpyLouish @_SemaHernandez_ @BetoORourke This thread makes literally no sense.

@shipman96 @jjmartini21 @4aPeoplesParty I just looked at the current state of Our Revolution, and wow, the vast majority of their candidates seem to be Dems. Better tell them to become indie or something.
@SargonOf_Akkad Please, Sargon, no need to post this. We all know you play for the other team anyway (not that there's anything wrong with that).
@CharlesKaupke @thehill She's the hero we all need, showing us just how smart the youth are.
@shipman96 @jjmartini21 @4aPeoplesParty I'm a little confused - you seem to be an Our Revolution supporter, yet the majority of candidates that organization supports are Dems. What is this I don't even.
@PeoplePartyOhio @Dennis_Kucinich @DNC Ohio has a sore loser law, so that wouldn't be possible this time around.
@jjmartini21 @shipman96 @4aPeoplesParty Considering party affiliation numbers haven't changed for Dems in the past 2 years per Gallup, if there was a DEMEXIT, then there must have been a DEMENTER at one point as well.
@BoutiqueBud @RealAlexJones I know, but it's hard to do it. Alex just keeps evading arrest somehow.

@SirKennyPoo @cenkuygur Says the person who literally thinks Twitter is after them for being conservative https://t.co/aYkBn4QVam
@endtimespeptalk @NateSilver538 Wut	That Kentucky election a few months ago had 2 women, and everyone was excited to follow that.
@kurtkuczynski @RealFacelessMan @chrisFnicholson @EricRWeinstein https://t.co/NbtG25jIck	https://t.co/NGkcbxQBhH		Both are still commonly denied, and the fact that young R's don't seem to care shows the theory doesn't hold much weight. Again, the only R I've seen mention this literally is 65 years old.
@RealFacelessMan @kurtkuczynski @chrisFnicholson @EricRWeinstein Considering LGBT discrimination is still legal for things like housing and employment in most states...
@kurtkuczynski @chrisFnicholson @EricRWeinstein None of the millennial R's in congress support gay rights. Ironically, the R that supports gay rights the most in congress is a 65 year old immigrant.
@IngrahamAngle Whatever helps you sleep at night, I guess. Btw, how's that Obamacare repeal coming along? üòÖ
@TreasonSeasonyo @WalshFreedom @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change &gt;Gun sales up 200%		Just to confirm, can I have a link to evidence of these being new gun owners? No one cares if a current gun owner buys a new one.
@TreasonSeasonyo @WalshFreedom @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change Every boycott ever? Alright then.
@BrianSwiftie13 @2thon @cenkuygur @KamalaHarris @justicedems @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TulsiPress @TulsiGabbard @HAGOODMANAUTHOR I still consider HA to have no interest in actual policy, just being anti-establishment for the sake of being anti-establishment, so I guess let's just agree to disagree on that (seriously, may as well vote for Ted Cruz at that point).
@BrianSwiftie13 @2thon @cenkuygur @KamalaHarris @justicedems @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TulsiPress @TulsiGabbard @HAGOODMANAUTHOR I'm not a Dem, so I'm indifferent. But you're on the page of a guy who founded a group called "Justice Democrats" ...so why even follow him?
@HAGOODMANAUTHOR @2thon @cenkuygur @KamalaHarris @justicedems @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TulsiPress @TulsiGabbard Oh really, even if Bernie runs? Goes to show you never cared about Bernie's policies, only that he was "anti-establishment" or whatever.
@TMirkin @MattWalshBlog I'd recommend leaving your echo chamber, then. Matt is the only person I'm seeing speak about this.
@timothystoner @FroggyBottomPnd @tedcruz Sure, why not.
@SargonOf_Akkad I like how you deleted the first tweet to fix your atrocious grammar. Now that's respectable üëç
@gelliottmorris Wonder what the reaction would be if Hiral somehow won.		"GOP IN DISARRAY!!!!"

@2thon @cenkuygur @KamalaHarris @justicedems @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TulsiPress @TulsiGabbard Your friend @HAGOODMANAUTHOR seems to be staunchly anti-Bernie now, so I'm surprised his fanboys aren't the same.

@Scott_ToccoNY @Gavin_McInnes She did burn Gavin pretty badly, that's for sure üòÅ
@JakeVandyne @ForecasterEnten That may be good for D's, though, since it would give R's a false sense of security leading to the type of complacency that D's had in 2010 (kind of like when Dem Mark Critz won in PA mid 2010, only for D's to lose 5 seats in PA come November).
@toweroftruth @AnnCoulter GOP controls all branches of government, no excuse for such incompetence, right?

@JoeFreedomLove PA-18 was at least ancestrally Dem, so it made sense for Dems to win it, and they're likely to win other similar seats (IL-12) come November.		Other two seats are too red to easily shift. If R's lose either of them, gg on November elections.
@ForecasterEnten That is so 2014 Harry.
@Jonlando @EsotericCD I seriously think Bost is toast against Kelly.
@iball @ravencottage1 @voluntaryismUSA @RossvWilliam @HarmlessYardDog @ColumbiaBugle &gt;Political Science degree	&gt;Expecting to make money		LOL. Also, nice Superman meme. Tell me, was Captain Planet too cool of a superhero to use? üòé
@iball @ravencottage1 @voluntaryismUSA @RossvWilliam @HarmlessYardDog @ColumbiaBugle So much butthurt in this comment. I would actually recommend going to one of those universities, lest your poor grasp on the English language actually start making a fool out of you (too late? ü§î)

@WalshFreedom Is this going to be Trump's "Obamacare" that sinks R's in November?
@bigandugly001 @AnnCoulter Not like Dems can even beat him in 2020 given their current state.
@thehill Always sad to see an elected official being forced to do their constitutional duty is considered "huge news" these days
@psychicfaire @MattWalshBlog I don't know man, they seem to be somehow getting what they want despite R's controlling everything: PP funding, huge spending bills, R's infighting, etc.
@Minijedimaster @realDonaldTrump Too late, it is, young Skywalker.
@jtsbk @janschakowsky @USUN @nikkihaley Lol here's hoping it gets vetoed. Puts a yuuuge target on the back of those R's that voted for a large spending bill...only to deliver no results.

@TransJamiePDX @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @TrumpTower (Btw if the PA-18 election was any indication, the average person doesn't care about low taxes as much as you think, since the GOP actually shelved their tax bill message after they found it was hurting them in this Trump +20 district). ü§î
@TransJamiePDX @penelope7usa @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @TrumpTower That's likely not true - The so called "New Deal Dems" stayed Dem throughout life, and Gen-X'ers have a higher % Dem registration now than they had 20 years ago. Silent was always R, though.

@WesleyTBrown2 @sbs4md Fruit Loops are pretty tasty, so I see no problem having a state dedicated to them.		I personally want a Lucky Charms state, myself, though.
@tamarjot I honestly kind of want Art Jones to win - not only will Lipinski be gone, but hilarity would ensue on the R side trying to justify a literal Nazi on their side in congress. Regardless, won't happen, since he barely even got any votes in the primary compared to the D's.

@Francisx1983 @justicedems A lot of crossover voting. R's didn't really have any competitive primaries on the ballot, so they could easily just vote in the D primaries.		Goes to show open primaries may not be so good.
@DrQuesol @GOPChairwoman @JeepDiesel Fiorina has never even held office, so wtf?		Also, some of those people aren't up for re-election for a while, so good luck getting rid of them.
@Capitalist2020 At least it ain't Kansas or Alaska.
@Capitalist2020 @ErikaHarold About the same chance as Dems do of winning in Idaho.
@The_RGA @JBPritzker @DemGovs And yet an incumbent GOP gov won by only 2%. Fun times ahead in this election üòÅ
@raydmathews Hey uh how do I get to "Gay Street"? Is it down Abortion Boulevard?
@NFrankovich I guess now Dems are feeling the burn that Reps felt in 2010 with the Tea Party primaries.
@outkast28570 @spdustin Or...why not get rid of super delegates AND switch to semi-closed primaries (only people with no party affiliation can vote in any party's primary). That would fix both problems.
@Slidewhistle72 @cenkuygur @scrowder Oh the irony.
@sawgrassFX @justicedems And only one of those losses (Newman) was unfortunate.		Also, will I evolve into you some day? ü§î
@wynnosu @cnnbrk Not sure if you were alive last year, but people attacked Phil Murphy for this exact reason.
@Redistrict Who knows, Art Jones might actually beat him.
@RealJoaoLima A neo nazi that's....far left? I guess there's a first time for everything.
@notChrisWachal Wouldn't be this year, at least. Sore loser law in Illinois would stop him from running again.
@notChrisWachal Not if Ives murders him first. Still no election day votes from her home county.
@focus_group_pal @Nate_Cohn #NotMyNate
@byrdshouse @BaDivita @rB777ftw @Redistrict I wasn't aware he was a professor. What subject did he teach?
@BaDivita @rB777ftw @Redistrict ??? Wat		Lipinski may be like the most conservative Dem in congress, but he's still nowhere near as conservative as, say, Ted Cruz. Also, I presume his November opponent, Art Jones, will be more conservative.
@rB777ftw @Redistrict Or, more likely, many Republicans are crossing over to vote for Lipinski because their primary is uncontested (and the nominee will literally be a Neo Nazi), and thus are voting for the more conservative of them.		If nothing else, this proves yet again that open primaries are bad
@LarrySabato It ain't over yet, especially since I hear Ives' hometown hasn't reported yet.
@AstuteMorals If there's one thing recent elections in PA and VA have taught us, it's that people in general don't care about low taxes much.
@Gavin_McInnes @kumailn I presume he'd be proud of his heritage (know nothing of the guy, though).	You, on the other hand, seem ashamed of your land of maple leaves and socialized healthcare. üòÅ

@Revolut_io @ForecasterEnten And then the next Governor of New York becomes....literally one of the girls from Sex and the City. 2018 sure is a strange time to be alive.
@BleuCheckmark @nathanlgonzales Rich people. They don't care about Rauner's stance on social issues, since they're all about the money.	The strongest person running on the Dem side is basically a clone of Rauner, though at least he's sticking to his party's general platform.

@TooOldTooStupid @ComfortablySmug Why "almost"? Why not completely?

@Soapbox_Pundit @benshapiro Better that than the "Hillary bought Uranium to give to the Deep State!!!!" stuff you'd find on Fox.
@KAllsep Kennedy's a little too new (I also can't help thinking he's eyeing joining the senate). That's the weird thing - the Dems in the house are all either newbies or old veterans. 	Tim Ryan is the best pick, though,
@KAllsep I agree, but I can't imagine who will succeed her. Hoyer? Schiff? Tim Ryan?
@Johnsmi59226012 @SenSanders If that's the case why do R's keep losing elections post-2016? I thought Trump was all about #winning

@rory_yeomans Senator? wut		You realize this was a house race, right? The term expires in about 10 months, and it won't likely go back anytime soon given the state's been de-gerrymandered, so that district will be much less red come November.
@Shannon34625862 @jonfavs The only thing that mattered tbh was his views on guns and unions. The only things this ancestrally Dem district cares about (and I guess not agreeing with the national Dems is helpful, too).
@GalGunOwnerAR15 And we on the left welcome this. If strong background checks, commie health care, and baby killing is on the next GOP platform, we all may have to come over too.

@ComfortablySmug I'm actually impressed they aren't leading with "Hilary Clinton bought Uranium from Iraq to supply the Deep State with WMDs to blow up Jesus"!!!!
@web @ComfortablySmug Notice how Smug is never truly able to take an L, having to always spin the narrative to protect his ego. Pretty sad üòÖ

@hustlao23 @SheriffClarke Does this guy even do anything anymore besides bitch on Twitter? He pussied out of running for re-election after finally getting a credible challenger, so he has nothing to show for his silly career.	Also, LOL @ conspiracies of Twitter hating conservatives. So paranoid üòÖ
@AHami18 @WeWuzMetokur Clearly you need to boycott now, since if there's one thing that always works, it's a politically-motivated boycott.
@HalesCornersFan @chrisgeidner Stock market was much better under Obama (hell, better under Ford) and unlike Trump, Obama was actually able to make more jobs than his predecessor's last term. Double sorry. 	No need to be such a partisan hack, friend. I see you love R's, but blind loyalty never helped anyone üòÅ
@DineshDSouza Is this Indian guy pretending to be white really trying to race shame others? Now I've seen it all üò®

@KimKesther1 @SilERabbit Panera sells wine? Wut	And I think he means how many (like Same Progressive and HA Goodman) gave up on Bernie after the primary.	Btw senator approval ratings are only taken statewide, so Bernie's approval numbers don't reflect upon any opinions outside of Vermont.

@aliliv777 @dacamovatib @TheDemocrats @Twitter @Google @YouTube @facebook Or...or instead of constantly bitching about it, go make you own social media site. I always thought conservatives were pro-free market, yet they seem to want to regulate these private businesses. Funny how that works ü§î
@Hogdoc3 If you haven't noticed, conservatives aren't very good with coding (or computers in general). Tech field is overwhelmingly liberal.

@jamiedho @LastJediAwful @starwars @rianjohnson Exactly - dem fanboys are mad that their movie is being ruined by the Big Bad SJW agenda or something, so they likely stuffed the box with negative reviews.

@SpeakerRyan @HomeDepot What nice people they are	https://t.co/uIwOrXS1kn
@ForecasterEnten It doesn't matter how strongly they try to play off a win by 2 or 3 points - they still had to spend over $10 million to barely hold a Trump +20 district against a political newcomer, which they'll still realize bodes really bad, regardless.
@Darth_Andrew777 @Nate_Cohn The PA special election is kind of playing into the D's narrative - people won't like the tax cuts. The fact that R's stopped airing the tax cut ads there after seeing no response (in a +20 Trump district) and are exclusively running attack ads now kind of shows this.
@markdbarnes @WalshFreedom Given the general public doesn't even remember the memos anymore, I doubt anyone will care.
@rammykiran1 @EWErickson If he's ignorant, then you must be mentally retarded (though that's probably the case, regardless üòú)

@veggie64_leslie @IPM_Tweets @ElectSema4TX Just to note, one thing that might have hurt her is that picture floating around of her supposedly endorsing Trump in 2016 in some Facebook group after Bernie lost. No idea if it's true or not, but it's off putting to say in the least for Dem primary voters.
@veggie64_leslie @IPM_Tweets @ElectSema4TX Then tell her to go for it. She even gets a head start in name recognition/fundraising/campaigning time.
@IPM_Tweets @veggie64_leslie @ElectSema4TX Nah, just abolish the US and let anarchy roam. We don't need any laws.
@veggie64_leslie @IPM_Tweets @ElectSema4TX But he, at least, changed election tactics after learning what he was doing wasn't working (see his 1990 campaign). Other perennial candidates need to do this if they want a chance.
@IPM_Tweets @veggie64_leslie @ElectSema4TX That sounds like a horrible idea given the amount of time/resources it takes to do a statewide election (especially in a place as big and expensive as Texas).	Obviously, the best idea is to just stay home and never vote again unless there's a Green on the ballot or something üëç
@veggie64_leslie @IPM_Tweets @ElectSema4TX Tenure of what? Being a senator? 6 years isn't short.
@notwokieleaks Could it be...*gasp*	Religion is bad in general? üò±

@thatalexlouden @fabulouseileen @allanbrauer @jimmy_dore @hannity @HAGOODMANAUTHOR Here's hoping Bernie runs. I can't imagine anyone else who could consolidate progressives at this point.
@Redistrict So is that a no go on TX-23?
@thatalexlouden @fabulouseileen @allanbrauer @jimmy_dore So, in other words, she'll endorse (maybe even campaign) for someone, as expected.	I swear it's weird how some are still so deranged about Clinton a year and a half later to the point where they still talk about her daily (here's looking at you, @hannity and @HAGOODMANAUTHOR üòâ)
@TheRealSWKR @benshapiro I see he disavowed Obama not long after he became president, calling Obama himself a "Jew in blackface". But our pal @DrDavidDuke is still loud and proud for The God Emperor‚Ñ¢ though. Funny how both are blatant antisemites (though one is notably way more racist on top of that)üëç
@TheRealSWKR @benshapiro What about Trump and David Duke?		Regardless, pornstar is still literally the worst thing ever.
@bullion64 @Nate_Cohn And no one kills JFK better than Rafael, apparently.
@thatalexlouden @fabulouseileen @allanbrauer @jimmy_dore The point I was making is directly written in that article: "A Clinton 2020 campaign has been ruled out". I'm sure she'll endorse the 2020 nominee or something, but that's a given for all of the D's.
@als1265 @Crimsontide722 @RealAlexJones 71 years 4 bankruptcies...HHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM https://t.co/uVLXHJUWKo
@thatalexlouden @fabulouseileen @allanbrauer @jimmy_dore Um...neither party has given a losing presidential candidate the time of day in presidential recruiting since Nixon. Feel free to remain paranoid, though, that the Big Bad Clintons will come back electorally tomorrow or something.
@ComfortablySmug @allahpundit You're one to talk tbh
@thatalexlouden @fabulouseileen @allanbrauer @jimmy_dore I guarantee you she won't run in 2020. The party won't even let her - once a loser, always a loser. The "establishment favored" candidate will be someone else (Biden or Gillibrand from what we're seeing right now). üëÄ
@ComfortablySmug Honestly what's the point of any laws at all when people keep breaking them.
@Madman7969 @SheriffClarke I'm glad you're offering. Where are you located? üòÅ
@qwk_slvr @ElectSema4TX You're right, it is over, though I still feel a little disturbed by that graphic (if it's real). Regardless, I wish her the best of luck in her primary.
@BigBrotherNoNo @PrisonPlanet LOL at blocking people	Thin skin much? üòÖ
@qwk_slvr @ElectSema4TX Wow, way to assume anyone who asks questions is automatically against you. I guess since you're making assumptions, is it fair for me to assume she was really trying to get all of us Bernie people to vote for Trump? üëÄ
@qwk_slvr @ElectSema4TX I know that, but did she really say this in 2016? Because this is really bad.
@qwk_slvr Hey, since you seem to know Sema, do you know if this is her posting this? If so, then that's a definite no to most. https://t.co/l7BwHrm8FD
@jasont42 @geezyourawierdo @jimmy_dore Are you seriously turning anti-Bernie now? Because that's where you lose me (and many of his supporters).

@HalesCornersFan Melania disagrees with your doubts. It's clear who she's happier with https://t.co/8gPMvS6Kq3
@cartoon_soldier @Redistrict GOP. This district that Trump won by 20% only narrowly went to R's in that scenario. It might even scare some incumbents into retirement.
@WalshFreedom @jimmykimmel Not according to approval ratings.
@RealAlexJones &gt;Rock Legend		Wasn't this guy like a one hit wonder? (if you can even call that song a hit)
@HalesCornersFan At least Alec Baldwin is still more popular than Trump, so that's one Baldwin down üòé
@NCBerniecrat @HuffPostPol I see Tulsi is on this list. I guess she's a bad person too now.
@MattWalshBlog Also, never complain about pedophilia if you're part of the Christian faith, as it has enabled pedophiles for centuries, including in recent years (but I guess we'll just skip over that inconvenient truth)
@JereCTN @MattWalshBlog Yet despite boycotts movies keep making more and more gross totals each year. What is this I don't even üòØ

@Elalushmaven @glennbeck @jimmykimmel Conservatives led a boycott of Stephen King's film "IT" last year.	It is now the highest grossing horror film ever ($700 million gross) üòé
@petris32 @ComfortablySmug But Hollywood is just so gosh-darned liberal and out of touch with us common folk. Consider a complete boycott of movies so dem dam libruls never get to line their pockets with your money.
@petris32 @ComfortablySmug Then don't watch them. Simple.
@TobyCharleston @Nate_Cohn The candidate they were originally running (that really sucked) finally dropped out today, and a guy running in a different district (CA-10) is slated to run here now.

@IHeartFlossing @notwokieleaks The most popular governor in the country, Baker, is effectively politically castrated by the legislature. Tried to expand charters and stop legal weed, failed. Him being the most Anti-Trump R elected in the country will let him win by at least 10 points, though.
@BradOnMessage Considering both extremes of the isle were boycotting NFL (libs: How dare they kick out Kaepernick! cons: How dare they kneel during the anthem!) not sure if that's a good example.	I guess they should roll the die here: They could be the next Chick Fil-A or the next Hobby Lobby.

@Starbird_Tweets @RealAlexJones @getongab &gt;Youtube is dying		Definitely the first time someone has said this in the past decade. üòé
@WalshFreedom Trump ran on what seemed to be an Anti-Free Trade platform, so he's at least keeping his promise for once.
@boobsforgold @dpakman @RealAlexJones I already mentioned I think the Russia stuff is insane. I'm more interested in your opinion on this Seth Rich and deep state crap.
@boobsforgold @dpakman @RealAlexJones Care to tell me again about how Seth Rich was killed by the magical Deep State that backed Hillary or whatever it is you guys believe? Just as insane as the Russia stuff tbh, if not worse.
@TimBogan5 @LauraLoomer @infowars @RealAlexJones @zimm3rmann @DewsNewz Wait, I can get paid for this? Where do I sign up?!
@scooterfine @FoxNews @Walmart You'd still not be old enough to buy alcohol, though, so that argument doesn't hold up.
@BethLynch2020 I guess I am, then. I'll stay here in reality looking at how their candidates managed to do even worse than the unpopular "establishment" in 2016 while you believe what you want. üëç
@Arnie3152 @krassenstein @williamhboney1 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, sure, whatever helps you sleep at night.	Can't wait until #buildthatwall (never) happens üòé
@darealwiles @BethLynch2020 Just as dumb as listening to candidates trying to run hard left in conservative areas only to see them lose by massive margins (see: most of the candidates Our Revolution drafted in 2016). Seems we're all at a stand still on where to go from here.
@WalshFreedom The average American doesn't care about this? Average Americans use Twitter, and this story has blown up here in the past hour or two.
@Arnie3152 @krassenstein @williamhboney1 @realDonaldTrump lol üëç	https://t.co/j3BCb8zO64
@katewillette @HotlineJosh It's for the best that the DCCC didn't involve itself here. Like with Alabama last year, voters in this district really don't like them, so directly helping candidates here will only hurt them.
@d_watters @justicedems @NomikiKonst @People4Bernie @ryangrim @ErikaAndiola @SeanMcElwee @chrislhayes @JStein_WaPo @lsarsour @lhfang ???		Weren't multiple women and minorities endorsed during the CA convention last weekend?
@SomePoliSci @ForecasterEnten Also Phil Scott. The fact that D's are barely trying to defeat them shows they don't care about those 3, but really hate Rauner.
@andrew_striedl @kkondik Backing tax-payer funded abortion totally helped him, at least.
@JPatchety Even worse than Blago or George Ryan?	(though Mr. "I am not in charge" is definitely down there, somewhere).
@morningmarsden @ForecasterEnten Too bad Rauner put ads up tying himself to the now disgraced Greitens. He wrote the ads that'll be used against him now I guess.
@case_deicase1 @SnarkyOracle @holly_thor_gaz If possible, please do a "Unite the Right" type rally nationally right before the November elections.
@1LEFFEL @steph93065 @ruth_elissa @Lrihendry Not really. You guys have only been able to flip 4 seats in the span of 15 months. At this rate, looks like that #redwave will have to wait a century or two. SAD! üòÖ
@rdsanchezjr @jorgeramosnews Lol, this guy is definitely going places (not congress, but places) üòÖ
@WalshFreedom @Delta You act as if cold winters are a bad thing.
@tuc9 @thehill It really does. D's are at least showing signs of rebuilding in CT, while R's haven't changed at all over the years in Kansas.
@tuc9 @thehill Yet it's still in better shape than Kansas somehow.
@jdmont1963 @thehill You can't boycott something you've never spent money on in the first place, silly üòÖ
@BoycottBertha @dbongino Lol we're waiting. Not like we've heard this story a million times already.
@drou_bre @Alyssa_Milano @ZachHibshman Please do. Movies somehow tend to do better when conservatives boycott them (See: IT).
@LacyElleMorgan @JamesPindell "If we lose, it must be because the other side cheated, not because our side sucks!!!"		Sad when the #MAGA crowd starts to sound exactly like Hillary Clinton supporters.
@NotreDameFan27 @DecisionDeskHQ Anything to do some damage control, I guess.
@justicedems @NomikiKonst @People4Bernie @ryangrim @ErikaAndiola @SeanMcElwee @chrislhayes @JStein_WaPo @lsarsour @lhfang So are identity politics a bad thing or not? With "not endorsing black candidates" being bad I don't see a clear position on that anymore.
@2017wasntnormal @realDonaldTrump @SenatorWicker He's only saying this because Wicker got a hard right serious challenger yesterday in his primary. Perhaps this is a ploy to help the hard right @senatormcdaniel win the primary?
@StevieSleeves @catseye2020 @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @infowars I think you're misunderstanding me - I'm talking above a social networking site made for people who identify with the Tea Party movement. I looked it up, it's called "Tea Party Community," a social networking site made to compete with Twitter, FB, etc.	https://t.co/3FnIjkFCbV
@aminawant @ComfortablySmug @Comey Pfft, @ComfortablySmug has no ass, silly.
@TelishaCobb @PhilBredesen @SenGillibrand @CoryBooker The guy's net worth is in the billions I believe, so he wouldn't even need that money.
@StevieSleeves @catseye2020 @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @infowars Strange, I believe there's that Tea Party social networking site that libs haven't infested yet. Then again, barely anyone uses it, hard to grow a platform when only one side of the isle is welcome there.
@TiffersYUPP I thank our amazing GOP governor @GovRauner for this great news, a guy that R's will have no other choices to vote for come November.
@SalCinque I don't get it, are people like getting shot up in abortion rooms or something? I'm not finding reports of people dying there.
@catseye2020 @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @infowars Nah, some of us actually like the free market. If you don't like this service, go use a different one, problem solved.
@_jeff_jaramillo @hasanthehun @benshapiro &gt;Literally unable to call the wahhhhmbulence	lrn2meme bro üòé
@dovisterr @hasanthehun @seamus_coughlin I'm not surprised that @seamus_coughlin wants to smash @hasanthehun. Sounds just like he'd be into that kind of stuff.
@Gorilla_Pundit @Redistrict Not to mention the one trillion Russians registered in the state. I'm sure all voters in the state are secretly Russian üòé
@Stop_Lying_Now @SenatorDurbin Yes
@RealAlexJones @davidhogg111 I'm assuming this is because a teenager is the only person you could defeat in a debate (and watch him lose anyway).
@ComfortablySmug #BoycottSmug
@lib_crusher LOL Illinois is literally ranked above Texas overall. SAD! üòÖ
@andrew_striedl @gelliottmorris I agree, this model really does overestimate R's, given they're ruining their own chances at every turn (O hai Pennsylvania)
@Jiggy1972 @justicedems @Alyssa_Milano @BWestbrookAZ8 @PiperPerabo LOL good luck with that, bot. Literally were only able to flip 4 seats in the span of 15 months. üòÖ
@my2bits4u @IngrahamAngle @maggieNYT The funny thing is the DUI happened when he was coming home from a club literally called "The Swamp". Can't make this stuff up.
@SiberianMidwest @RealAlexJones I've seen him eat after midnight, though.
@EricKeithGreen @Redistrict It's basically blue now. Trump's approval rating is too low there for him to dent the state, and in 2020 the most vulnerable senator in the country is by far Gardner.
@TheresaDinardi @justicedems @Alyssa_Milano @BWestbrookAZ8 @PiperPerabo Lol is this bot seriously posting faking news here? What is this I don't even üòÖ
@AshleySchaeffr @hasanthehun @benshapiro Shapiro is quite the tool, yes.
@Patriotdistress @Redistrict It took Virginia less then a decade to go from solid red to lean blue (notice how Virginia hates Trump in that map)
@theodosia60 @jaketapper @REALStaceyDash Considering she's running in a district that Trump only got 12% of the vote in, I'm sure she'll totally win.
@ReaganBattalion inb4 FedEx pulls NRA support and this post still exists. üòâ
@trumpATeam @nullinthevoid @infowars @RealAlexJones We're still waiting on that. You best not be trying to attack the DEEP STATE, lest they come to attack you too üò®
@Tmbldr @SherrodBrown @KathleenClyde @SteveDettelbach @RobforOHIO @ZackSpaceOhio Don't worry, I'm sure Jim Renacci will beat him, given Renacci is a #winner or something
@mdunjic @BethLynch2020 Not like making a third party hasn't been done a million times already, only for it to collapse within an election or two.
@Djhottowns @ComfortablySmug I dare them to as well. You're overestimating exactly how many wingnuts there are in the country.
@TheUSAsFuture Yes, they have finally woken up and realized that she isn't liberal enough for California. üòéüòé
@carolinagirl63 Considering her only major opponent is someone even further to the left, this is pretty awesome tbh. üëç
@msmarianpinky By that logic Kamala Harris shouldn't have run for senate either.
@xmenplay It's bad news for Republicans, maybe. If Dems get both of the top 2 spots in the jungle primary, Republicans are kicked off the November ballot, forcing them to vote for a Dem.
@Ryry916 Kind of the other way around. With CA's top 2 primary system, not endorsing anyone allows for Dems to get all of those top 2 spots, leaving R's with the choice of voting Dem or nothing.
@BasedMonitored I hope you realize this is very bad for R's. The game D's are playing is setting up another top 2 Dem primary like in 2016, kicking R's off the general election ballot. Since there's no presidential election on the ballot this time, get ready for much lower turnout on the R end.
@RealAlexJones TFW you just found out you shit your pants. https://t.co/7cmk1h57zT
@geiger_maureen @KamVTV @Trish061616 Comparable to conservatives declaring they're boycotting movies by liberal Hollywood that they were never going to see anyway.
@bowhuntli @NYCMayor @MetLife @united @Delta @Hertz @TrueCar @Avis @symantec @BestWestern @SimpliSafe @Wyndham @FNBOmaha @Chubb @Enterprise @NRA You say that as if it's a bad thing.
@JoshRother @LibbySchaaf @realDonaldTrump I guess so. Perhaps I too should consider buying a tin foil hat someday so I too can see the the truth of Bush somehow doing 9/11. https://t.co/wulpXfLB5z
@GMarsh1944 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine That's demonCRAP to you FYI. And good luck defeating the DEEP STATE.
@JoshRother @LibbySchaaf @realDonaldTrump Don't worry, I'm sure the big bad DEEP STATE (or whatever it is you people believe) will accept her to the highest of ranks after they destroy you with their magic shadow powers or something.
@robsolonhamer @US1Southbound @yowheez @JacobAWohl @JacobAWohl may be the single dumbest person on this platform now. Kudos to him.
@Anak72297161 @dboik0104 See, I was right, like literally talking to someone with the intelligence of a 5-year old. Perhaps it's time to take yourself out of the gene pool?üòé		Feel free to keep crying about how the "big bad libtard hollywood" is horrible and how your boycotts shall totally take them down
@Anak72297161 @dboik0104 Whoa, so upset. No need to yell, normal people know to how discern the difference between reality and fiction.		Also, "btw," may I recommend English lessons? It'll teach you to attack "libards" more efficiently. Hard to get offended by someone with the intellect of a 5-year oldüòâ
@ShuggShackel @DevinSenaUI @PrisonPlanet If you don't mind me asking, can I have some examples of conservative boycotts actually being effective? Thanks.
@TrumpsBCArmy @RealAlexJones It's sad that you even had to utter that sentence. Speaks a lot to Jones' character.
@Joe_America1776 Always nice to see the right tear itself apart, especially in this Indiana election that should've been an easy pickup (now it probably won't).
@dboik0104 @Anak72297161 You're right, but then again R's are just as stupid with their "wahhhh Hollywood is liberal so I'll boycott it!!!111" crap.	Considering the movies they boycott are breaking box office records left and right these days, I guess they never were going to see these movies anyway.
@FatSerpico @ComfortablySmug Yeah, the only way to turn out those R's that hate Trump and heaven't out out much in the past few elections is to take away their guns. Alex Jones says it, so it must be true https://t.co/EVThdueFV4
@ComfortablySmug The sad thing is Smug actually believes non-Alt Right R's will fall for this nonsense. üòÖ
@GoozledDOTcom @AnnCoulter That mugshot still has got nothing on my favorite one		"I'm Eric Greitens and I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN I TIED UP AND DID STRANGE KINKY THINGS TO" https://t.co/UhYoSXWEkM
@HoopsPlayer1221 @WarRoomShow @KahlerSabrina Not if the DEEP STATE has anything to say about it!!!!111
@TinaNewYork @politico Yeah, give glocks to 5 year olds!!! Then they'll be safe!
@Geri_gigi @ninaturner @DNC &gt;Doesn't believe in Russiagate conspiracies	&gt;Yet believes in strange "Seth Rich was Murdered!!!!!" conspiracies		lol, I guess conspiracies are only true when they politically suit you (inb4 Pizzagate is true too). Don't let the door hit you on your way out of #therevolution üëç
@EmmeWinch @jimmy_dore @JGBPOV I'm still waiting on a source showing that threats are occurring rather than hearing your average conspiracy theorist yell "Shillary and the deep state want to hurt his family and if you don't believe me you're dumb!!!!"
@PatrioticMoses1 @IngrahamAngle @Nigel_Farage @TuckerCarlson @JaySekulow @michellemalkin @AllenWest @RealAlexJones Yep, it's all a false flag from the DEEP STATE to continue its globalist agenda of a single unified world government!!!!

@LindaSh93759143 @animaltopper1 @MagniFieri How much do they cost? If it's so easy to "buy" them, I'd like some...
@jewelstweeeets @Alyssa_Milano Obviously all of the Shekels. Getting paid is the only possible way to have a dissenting opinion ofc üòú
@34RNH4RDT @benshapiro Why, it was obviously the DEEP STATE of course.
@ComfortablySmug @MatthewNussbaum Smug really is Poe's Law incarnated.
@thefactualprep @ComfortablySmug This. R's will always have their silly Establishment vs Teabagger war, so may as well see the opposing side have something like that too.
@frankensinatra @PrisonPlanet @CNN Pot meet kettle, etc.
@ckieser13 @EsotericCD Maybe train those armed security guards that were in the school that day to be more competent?
@BDrabkowski @RealAlexJones You should at least go one step further and call Mr Jones a piece of shit, I mean GAWD.
@BDrabkowski @RealAlexJones That's not a very nice name to call @RealAlexJones. Meanie!
@AntiLeft2701 @WalshFreedom Soon, you too shall be assimilated into the deep state, where you shall be controlled for all eternity too!!!! (Or whatever it is you guys believe)
@soshbill @HumanistReport I still don't understand this point- it's not Bernie's job to help candidates win elections. If Canova didn't have the will to win this on his own, why expect him to have the will to be a effective legislator? (Btw despite this I would've voted for Canova if I lived there)
@BL_Rhodes @marcorubio I call DINO.	Your move.
@digiderek @JudsonMerritt @jimmy_dore @Ross_Shockley And yet so many of my fellow Bernie fans peddle this "Deep State" crap as reality. Even Bernie doesn't seem to believe in that fantasy.
@hampton_rueben @AdanSalazarWins @RealAlexJones @realDonaldTrump So you're yet another veteran disabled in the war? Nice. üëç
@JohnnyTSollitto @RealAlexJones You're a big guy.
@kkondik Corker would be the weaker candidate (i.e. the one Dems want to face) since Trump's fans hate him, and may not turn out for him.
RT @Nick_Offerman: .@NRA @DLoesch our good-hearted show and especially our Leslie Knope represent the opposite of your pro-slaughter agenda‚Ä¶
@JamessMadison @williamlegate Sad thing is this guy actually believes this.
@MariaBrownMAGA @AnnCoulter He may have saved "american," but you just killed grammar. Kudos üòâ
@stebo5 @JeremeyKrebs @andrew_striedl @Redistrict Your tweet told me half did not speak English. According to your link, only 18.6% do not speak English well. Also, officially only 13% of the state is non-US citizen, so that 18.6% number sounds about right.
@stebo5 @JeremeyKrebs @andrew_striedl @Redistrict "18.6 percent of California residents 5 and older do not speak English ‚Äúvery well." "	I guess 18.6% of a state is half of it now.	Also, glad to know Texas is on the chopping block next üëç

@DjRobbz_Blog @MrSparkleJoinMe @hoosierworld @Momisbuff @EnigmaNetxx @BobsBurgersFOX @LindaBelcherFOX Hey there's no trolling here, just telling you to get our names right when trying to use insults.
@DeplorableMDDoc @RealAlexJones Nah, daddy, I'd rather ask you about it. Please describe to me about how the big bad magical robots shall doom us all. I promise to be a good little boy and listen (also laugh).
@DjRobbz_Blog @MrSparkleJoinMe @hoosierworld @Momisbuff @EnigmaNetxx @BobsBurgersFOX @LindaBelcherFOX Hey, that's DemonCRAPS to you, get it right.	Besides, at least use the best GIF of her to celebrate her win. https://t.co/Jezyhu6Bxa
@DavidNir Just remember, Linda Belcher is the best character. https://t.co/1IuUDX1i7J
@SummerPark_ @mcimaps @DecisionDeskHQ When was the previous election? If we're talking 2016's judicial elections, then lol, a little too old.
@DeplorableMDDoc @RealAlexJones Because old fictional films (crappy ones in the latter case) represent real life well.
@JeremyPatten5 @_Project1000 @RealAlexJones It's pretty clear you aren't a bot. After all, bots are smart enough to not waste their time with that God stuff.
@JeremyPatten5 @_Project1000 @RealAlexJones &gt;Thinking you can defeat our secret shadow DEEP STATE powers	lol. The DEEP STATE shall assimilate you one day soon, as it will the world come Judgment Day‚Ñ¢
@GOPJake Lol I remember back in 2010 when Dems were saying stuff like "who cares it's only one seat". Don't worry, though, they lived happily ever after in 2011.
@RealAlexJones Didn't they just win another election tonight in deep red territory? I presume there were tons on children and illegals voting there, though, obviously.
@Twinkle06601174 @jaketapper @Philly tl;dr
@DavidJollyFL You should remind @DineshDSouza of the definition of compassion
@ArlieAgain @trueworldv1 @TammyRushing4 @realDonaldTrump @MAGATXCandy At this point R's should just fully leave California and give their 14 seats there to D's in order to finally leave that place.
@Libs_R_Cancer @thehill I myself prefer alligator tears. You should try it, it's a lot healthier.
@Sam74623172 @Myob_Myob @WarRoomShow Pot meet kettle, etc.
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump lol y u so mad tho. Who triggered you so much to be this way?
@admorris @FrankLuntz So...when's that new health care plan coming? Obamacare is at it's most popular ever (51%-39%), so you better hurry.
@JoeFrommling @BobbyBigWheel In other words, just another day in Trump's America?
@Redistrict A/B, though leaning towards B. The more competition, the better.
@Nigel_StHubbins @StuPolitics At least gerrymandering in Michigan is likely to die at the end of the year via ballot initiative.
@JohnTay67511605 @WalshFreedom And how someone walks around concealing a gun they won't need and probably can't use effectively anyway amazes me as well. But with both legal, no need to worry about such things, no?
@benshapiro Just another day in the life of a conservative on Twitter.
@JohnTay67511605 @WalshFreedom Nah, as we've seen recently, GOP governor Bruce Rauner signed into law tax-payer funded abortions, and multiple other GOP governors have been supporting it as law as well, so I guess it's there to stay. üëç
@JohnTay67511605 @WalshFreedom Then why all the fighting? Let's keep guns and abortion 100% legal forever. Everyone wins! üòÅ
@ComfortablySmug Everyday's a Friday on Twitter.
@WalshFreedom No such thing as an "unborn baby". Baby=human, and to be human you must be born.
@davidradiowntp @thehill Mind if I get a source on that? Sounds interesting.
@SeeYunke @SK68TN @DrJillStein @cenkuygur Nah, Bernie really knows his stuff, having been in the business for around 50 years. #Hindsightis2020 tbh. 	Stein is also strangely anti-Wifi and vaguely anti-vax as well, apparently, so it's hard to trust her.
@SeeYunke @SK68TN @DrJillStein @cenkuygur Whoa, so hostile. üòú	Stein thinks the Russia hacking is a hoax, so she's clearly anti-Bernie on this issue (which is pretty unacceptable to me tbh as a big Bernie backer during the primaries).
@SeeYunke @SK68TN @DrJillStein @cenkuygur Considering Bernie agrees that Russia interfered in the election....yeah.
@JeremeyKrebs @stebo5 @andrew_striedl @Redistrict Well I was the asking the other guy, @stebo5, about his strange belief that 	half the state doesn't speak English lol		I agree Cali is not gerrymandered due to the non-partisan redistricting commission. Every state needs this.
@politiburr @davidtorre01 @jimmy_dore If you say so. So, say Bernie decides not to run in 2020. Who do you think is the next best option for people who want an experienced progressive? Merkley?
@politiburr @davidtorre01 @jimmy_dore You really think Obama is as conservative as someone like Ben Nelson? I know you hate the guy, but that's just asinine. Also, considering many D's were already skeptical to go for the "conservative" OCare, I'm sure they would've quickly jumped onto banning guns mirite?
@politiburr @davidtorre01 @jimmy_dore Nah, Blue Dogs. Their caucus has only like 10 members now, compared to over 50 ten years ago.
@TravisNTaylorLA I agree, a map with 8 safe R seats and 6 safe D seats must be gerrymandered. Only explanation possible.
@stebo5 @JeremeyKrebs @andrew_striedl @Redistrict Do you have a source for that claim? Because it's interesting that you believe that.
@infowars Seriously, All That Remains? What, was Nickelback too mainstream for you?
@Term_Limits_Now @MikeCrapo Is THAT what a hand gun is shaped like? I guess you've never seen a real gun before, then.
@WalshFreedom Just kick her out like all of the rest of the accused. Problem solved.
@born_summer62 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just leave CA for Texas then. Everyone wins.
@DarrenWillcox1 @NateSilver538 Basically too late for this year's elections, just like the lawsuit in Wisconsin.
@Trump_Stickmen @cspanwj If you're truly an independent, are you in favor of a non-partisan redistricting commission in the state, as many other states have?
@RCTrumpisbackII @WalshFreedom @FoxNews I disagree, there's a great deal of conservative news media online, including the guy whose post we're commenting on. I think it's about even on a partisan basis.
@dsf1972 @WalshFreedom I'm sure all of the other previous presidents thought that as well. Now, what in Trump's 13 months has made him the best? Was he able to #buildthatwall or #lockherup, as he promised us?
