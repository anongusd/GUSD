@WorldEliteSyn Gentlemen thank you for another huge year in 2018. I am so proud to be a client of yours. It's been almost three years now and you have been an absolute blessing. By far the best in the biz! For those of you who haven't given these guys a try yet I highly recommend it. Thx again!

@brianwilson_82 @WorldEliteSyn They do not lie! I have been with them for 2.5 years &amp; they are the most honest service I have ever joined, not to mention the best in the industry ten fold. The record is the other way around 44-11. Shame that you cant afford them &amp; instead have to lie to feel better about it.
@WorldEliteSyn Here's that extra bit of pocket change I was telling you about. Thanks as always gentlemen! 🏈🍻 https://t.co/FhPMGggMcz

@Jewey19 @WorldEliteSyn Unlike you I'm one of their most loyal clients, been with them nearly 2.5 yrs now &amp; after the crazy ride I had in this business before finally coming across them it's the best thing that could have ever happened to me, maybe if you did the same your life would be much happier to.
@Jewey19 @WorldEliteSyn Who cares what the line was! Whats with people?? I'd rather be with a service that wins a high juice game than ones that lose them, besides these guys have more plus lined games than any other service I've ever come across. How about the 2/1 &amp; 3/1 releases they won over the wknd?

@XPro_2016 @downskibars @DavidImoto @BsptSportsPicks @WorldEliteSyn 'JBs' post simply acknowledges WES continued success. I see these types of write ups on forums. All bs with no backing. When members speak we are all them so the jealousy is quite obvious &amp; very rampant. I am nearing 2+ yrs with them, I think that is all that needs to be said. 💵

@WorldEliteSyn @ChadMizzou @GamblingCleanUp You know football season is around when. :)  These services must hate how WES is taking everyone else's customers, including me. #LOYAL4LIFE
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn Your not worth another comment.
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I would block you if I was them also lol
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn Sure if that really happened but I never saw a line that high. Besides they released that game 2 days prior so join &amp; u won't have to worry.
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn These guys have given out hundreds of plays, funny all you talk about is one game. Have you seen the units they make?
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I could care less what you think, it's just unfair for you to call them out when your not even a member ... you are cheap
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn Sounds like you need to make an apmt at the Optometrists ;)
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn How funny is that coming from someone whom WES has already called out for not being a client or ever paying them a dollar. lol
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I think what's 'obvious' if your too cheap too pay them and see for yourself lol
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I see everything on their web-site for not only this month but every month prior to that also and all the daily releases/results to boot.
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn Your talking about the closing line? I never saw it. If the line goes the other way should they be allowed to mark it that way also?
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I was able to get that line but will admit saw it climbed soon after. Don't think they should be ridiculed for that though. Happens. #WESis$
@WorldEliteSyn @BookieBruisers I can also vouch that everything they release is exactly stated and noted on their site daily. There is nothing fraudulent, 100% real deal.
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn They make a reasonable point, no matter what small discrepancies u have on lines their overall units make up for it, Im up nearly 900 units!
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn I can vouch for them I got this game just before 1am est &amp; the line they posted at https://t.co/6cMYdnRLui. Perks of being a member I guess.
@BookieBruisers @WorldEliteSyn If anything they are being honest with you lol. I have been there for nearly half those units, before that always lost with services.
@WorldEliteSyn @BookieBruisers These guys are the real deal. Been with them over 1 yr. Lines can go both ways. Either way doesnt matter, they make more than enough units.
@WorldEliteSyn Over 1 year &amp; counting for me.. Thank you so much for what you do.. Truly the 'Diamonds In the Rough' of the Industry! #UnprecedentedService

@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE 👍
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE 9 units whatever who cares
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE Actually it's you that can't, that's the whole problem and why it's way over your head.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK Who's chasing? I'm on houses money for life now. :)
@UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE Don't need to chase shit, 5* wins it's +5, lose at -180 its -8 &amp; on to the next game. Most people understand this basic grade 1 math process
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Like I care if you join or not, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, simply backing them because I appreciate what they have done for me.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Maybe if you guys weren't such asses theyd help you. They are great that way, but as usual you wouldnt know that wasting your time trolling.
@findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd I'm the idiot with over a quarter of a million dollars in profits since I joined them. 🤑
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 The point is they make units every month, never had a losing month and lowest month was just over 20 units, my advise follow longer &amp; see.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I just finished telling you they have plenty of lower lines like tonight and even some dogs along the way, still units what matters most.
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Doesn't matter, I made a killing and that's all I care about, I'm sure all of they're members agree with me.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE The only thing that isn't adding up are your basic math skills, if you can't follow what I just exampled I feel sorry for you. #Grade1
@UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE How do you figure? and btw football doesn't go to March lol
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE Ask them, I don't know the answer to that question, maybe because most people like me don't have a problem following the site results daily.
@findfrauds331 @Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @grovinmahovin How long you been following them, 1 week, maybe two? lol
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Anyways no point in continuing this conversation. You are either to oblivious to the simplicity of MS's process or simple can't afford them.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 $250 was just an example that I started at, worked out for me hitting +153 last June but yes betting $500/un minimum would probably be best.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 That's one particular month &amp; I bet 1k/now, besides why don't you make reference to March +50 or January +83.5, even better +153 last June.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 As I've been saying from the start, assuming things will keep this conversation going around in endless circles, members know what's up.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 How long have you followed them? Sounds like a week otherwise you would know that to be false. FYI tonights VIP plays are all less than that
@findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd Not only is this a complete over exaggeration and a complete lie but you continue to overlook the big picture regarding monthly units.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Just saying, hard to compare with MS :)
@findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd How was that pick exposed being that it won lol
@UberTipsterUK @CarydashM @Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE NHL happens to be theyre best sport, they are 45-14 on the yr in VIP, its truly amazing NFL/CFB are a very close 2nd NHL ended on a 17-2 run
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I guess math isn't your only problem, I said I started at 250/unit almost a year ago when I first joined and have worked up to 1k/unit now.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Started at 250/unit, then gradually worked my way up, next I went to $500/unit, than $750/unit, now 1k/unit.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Say what? Honestly it amazes me how dumb people are. At 34-8 -110 and 5* per play profits would be +170 (34x5) and losses 88 = +82 units!
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I'm not going to discuss what I pay but again doing the math you will see that even at $250/unit there is money to be made.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 They will be the first to admit they aren't for everyone, you have to have a bankroll and make sizeable bets yes.
@findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd Why because he never heard of MS lol
@findfrauds331 @grovinmahovin @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd The only frauds Jack are the ones who haven't paid MS a penny. What's even funnier is he thinks people find him credible. Join=Credible!
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Thats your call &amp; your way of doing things, doesnt mean its the right way or preferred way, just individual preference, MS has they're way.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I'll give u an example -150 &amp; I'm done with this. Lets say record 10-5 with all 5unit plays, 10winsx5=50, 5lostx(7.5x5)=37.5 profits=+12.5 !
@findfrauds331 @Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Such a mature vocabulary you have Jack.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I've always played with houses money, right from day 1, never been down and up so much now will never look back.
@findfrauds331 @Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @neranzen Sorry this is beyond your 14 yr old brain Jack.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I'm not here to play games, no time for it, was merely offering my help, maybe they are not for everyone but I couldn't be happier.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 You actually get customers with those results UBER? lol
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK I'm sorry your brain can't comprehend this but it's not only possible, it's basic grade 1 math. If you want I'll show you an example at -150
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 huh? Everyone bet's whatever they like. I started at $250/un so 5*s were to make $1,250 and 10*s to make $2,500, now i've worked up to 1k/un
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Huh? First off Montreal never even played last night and in order to lay 12.5 to make 5 the line would have to be -250.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Sure you have to have a bankroll, that's why it's a high roller club, DUH!
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Don't be lazy and follow along mate. Go to the site, click 'todays picks' &amp; u will see all daily posted results, no1 going to hold your hand
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 If you consider +150 units for 2017 luicrous thats your call, at a dime per unit you can figure out how much I've won + 2016 = CHA CHING :)
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 UBER I find it hard to believe you even run a service lol you lay 8 units at -160 to make 5 units the way they do it, not difficult
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Keep in mind they do all lines, low/high, even dog lines occasionally, remember its about winning more units than losing, not rocket science
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 That can happen yes but when you look at what they finish at monthly no one cares. This year nearly +150 units, that's what I care about.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @UberTipsterUK Ok Scott now your wasting my time also. I just showed you how they do it, if you don't like it why you still here?
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 You guys are fucking retarded, I just explained to you how they do it. Why am I even wasting my time with people who are brain dead. #Duh !
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 huh? All I care about is what profits I make monthly, not how I got there.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Those separate packages are all part of one club. Maybe if you asked them instead of assuming you would know. I asked because I'm not lazy.
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 You asked for transparency well they showed it in that first 6 months, I have never seen another service do that, another reason i joined.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK Jack is 14 so done with him but I just sent u a few messages Scott &amp; showed you how it works, simple &amp; easy, have you not done units before?
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Thats for them to answer me personally I have no problem following daily on site &amp; doing my own ledgering Btw members get games night before
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 That's why you should follow them and see for yourself. Can tell you from my experience that my bankroll has never been at risk &amp; no chasing
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @SportsInvestCo Key is too win them, easier said than done, MS does, been with others that lost them daily, big difference. Besides they give low&amp;high lines
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Tonight, three 5 unit plays, if all win than +15 units, if 2 win than +10 minus other loss, if one wins +5 minus other 2 losses, easy.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Just did. Not rocket science right?
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 So a $1,000 player would have made +$23,500, $500 per unit +$11,750.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Nine 5 unit wins = +45 + One 10 unit win = +10 so +55 in wins, -31.5 units in the five losses and that's how you get +23.5.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @UberTipsterUK They have plenty of discounted offers, that's how I got started and if your so smart why you here? Easy to be the general after the war!
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 I just did, look at my other tweet. Whatever units they make monthly X whatever your per unit bet is = profit. Not rocket science.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Your pt is regardless, the only thing that matters is the +23.5. Its amazing how hard this is 4u2 comprehend, than +23.5x per/un bet=profit!
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK And yes they send out plays at 2am est, even earlier.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK Ok so what's your point -150 or -160, close enough, besides they won so it's a +10 either way, only matters if you lose. So hard to process?
@findfrauds331 @neranzen @BettingBruiser You know what they say, always easy to be a general after the war, if your so smart &amp; knew how to make money capping you wouldn't be here.
@findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @SportsInvestCo Still not happy? Obviously your a 14 year old &amp; a waste of any further responses. #AlternativeMotives #Troll
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd @SportsInvestCo Exactly the reason I keep saying #AlternativeMotive. Obviously this guy has his own best interests in mind vs actually joining.
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 It's quite simple Scott, as long as they win more units than lose per month all is good and since I've been there (almost a year) never lost
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 25 Units? They've never had a play lose that much so what are you talking about? It's about monthly +/- units, why so hard to process?
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd @SportsInvestCo Like any of that is your business or anyone else's for that matter. Instead be a man, purchase a package &amp; you'll get all the proof you need
@findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @grovinmahovin 1? I see a few of us out here actually. No wonder you can't understand units when simple math addition is difficult lol
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Umm probably sick of you? lol I mean everything that is said to u is refuted with your dis-belief so whats the pt &amp; why you still here than?
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd So why you still here than Jack? You don't believe and won't pay them so as I said, #AlernativeMotive #WorksForAnotherService ??? #Funny lol
@Scottkidd22Kidd @UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Why don't you look at their first 6 months for free, still on Twitter. Like I told UBER, follow the daily result posts on site. #History
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Again Jack you smell 'Alternative Motive' like there's no tomorrow. I think its quite clear your a troll working for other services #MyGuess
@Scottkidd22Kidd @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @UberTipsterUK Scott you also sound like someone with alternative motive? I mean why should anyone show you anything, what we bet is none of your business!
@UberTipsterUK @DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @Scottkidd22Kidd Stop being a lazy ass UBER and follow their daily result posts, keep your own ledger and you'll have as much form as you would like.
@DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd AMEN to that Pitbull :)
@DrunkenMonkey75 @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd hahahah nice Pitbull, now they are going to say we are friends and both work for MS lol
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Well I think it's quite clear why UBER is here lol, I highly doubt MS goes around to other services trying to promote themselves #desperate
@findfrauds331 @neranzen @BettingBruiser And you wonder why they blocked you? You won't pay them to see &amp; every backing/tweet is fake so fair to say you have an alternative motive!?
@findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @SportsInvestCo Did you not see Blake's post of Detroit at -160, he cleared that up very nicely. Remember as a member you get the plays the night before.
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd @SportsInvestCo The only fraudsters are the ones making accusations without even giving them a try. Thank God I didnt listen to guys like this #MSMadeMeRich
@UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 Exactly, now your talking UBER, so if they win 90 units over a monthly period &amp; lose 40 like they did in March for a +50 what's the problem?
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd When a game wins Jack the line doesnt matter as your wagering to win the 10unit ranking of that play,only matters if you lose #HowUnitsWork!
@Scottkidd22Kidd @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK Hey Scott ever thought of simply asking them how things work rather than assuming things your obviously oblivious to. Units vs Lines matter!
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd So UBER are you actually trying to find out if MS is legit or simply trying to shamelessly promote your own horn, #hilarious #desperate lol
@findfrauds331 @XPro_2016 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd Maybe if you paid them you'd find out that one of the member privileges is getting the plays the night before, that's how.
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd The only 'morons' are the ones that tweet this kind of thing without giving them a fair chance.
@findfrauds331 @UberTipsterUK @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd You guys obviously dont get it, again its not about lines that matter, its about the units they make why is this so difficult to understand?
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd If you followed them daily you would have your ledger and it's not about what % they hit, it's about the units they make, not difficult.
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Not only do they show the daily result posts but they also provide the monthly breakdowns. If your too lazy to follow along that's on you.
@UberTipsterUK @findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @Scottkidd22Kidd Where are you looking? They post results of all 3 clubs on the 'todays picks' page daily, all you have to do is follow along.
@findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd And yes they count all juice, maybe if you followed them on the site you would see for yourself.
@findfrauds331 @MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM @DrunkenMonkey75 @UberTipsterUK @Scottkidd22Kidd I've not only heard of them, been with them a year &amp; everything they do is 100% legit, yes there are high lines but they win so I'm happy.
@neranzen @SugarShack92 @MTLSYNDICATE I have your messages bud, showed them to MS and they blocked your ass! Try getting a life, or better yet a job for that matter! #FreeLoader
@neranzen @MTLSYNDICATE This idiot messaged me about u guys, looking for guys to split costs with, obviously couldn't find anyone &amp; is crying like a baby now #Loser
@neranzen @DrunkenMonkey75 @MTLSYNDICATE MS block this idiot, its more than obvious he's a troll who can't even afford your $99/mo with his piggy bank funds #CheapFuckingLoser lmfao

@gunshow191 At first I went smaller, then after feeling more confident I worked my way up to 5k on 5*s &amp; 10k on 10*s and have stayed there.
@gunshow191 For the first few months I checked the site for accuracy, everything was always spot on, as for pay I'd rather keep that private
@gunshow191 Think its $5,999 now, but I signed on a longer term discounted deal a few months back, I find they are good that way if you ask.
@MTLSYNDICATE Thank YOU as always gentlemen. There's no words to describe how amazing you guys are anymore. Simply the BEST, not even close!

@MTLSYNDICATE funny how that goes lol
@bsala08 I just looked, it says Warriors?
@bsala08 Why's it weird?
@bsala08 They went with GS and it's not a football game, did you mean basketball? They are on N. ILL over Idaho on that one.
@bsala08 I hear you, at 21 I couldn't even afford gas for my car lol. Shitty loss tonight :(
@bsala08 I dont mind throwing you a bone, especially with the $ Ive won but have you looked at they're prices, not cheap bro, just saying ;)

@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo The 78% is based on a yr/VIP, thats what it says anyways &amp; ya the 6 months is what made me join, great #'s &amp; real
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo U dont have to be so sarcastic about it, starting to sound like the other guy. The 900k reference is Dime players
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo That 6 month trial record message was more for the other guy .. He's being an idiot calling those #'s mediocre.
@SportsInvestCo @CarydashM 	6 Month	FREE TRIAL	Regular Club	202-115 (64%)	+110 Units		You call that mediocre?		I call it best Ive ever seen.
PUMPED for this one!!		Already planned a big party for it, #Panago and #beers! https://t.co/gx1CrsZwjU
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo I like to win.
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo Fine but u care to claim they're numbers are false so I'm asking u if they're 6 mos free results are false also?

Amazing bro !! https://t.co/NC76yotkQL
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo 1rst 6 mos of FREE results are false too? .. Same records as they are doing now, that's another reason I joined.
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo So is they're 1st 6 mo that was FREE full of it to?.. Face it u both are jealous u can't afford them, accept it.
@SportsInvestCo @CarydashM 	Since Aug/2015		Regular Club	561-350 (62%)	+274.85		*VIP*	171-48 (78%)	+649.65 Units		That's why I joined!
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo Cool, good luck, for me it was Blue Jays earlier and just the VIP tonight.
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo What's my incentive if I post? I mean I dont really care what you or anyone else thinks, no offense, just saying.
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo Which plays are you talking about? I'm just on they're VIP. I'll post tonight's NFL VIP if u split next purchase.
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo Well because that's how it's gone so far, I did tell you I lost a game, 8-1 thus far, 1 pending. What if they do?

@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Well in all fairness I'm hitting even better with them at 8-1 thus far &amp; I just got Sat's play.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Glad, Im not the type that is jealous, Im all for us winning if we can, no matter via what avenue.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo So far so good but I'll say when I lose too, not like Im getting paid to promote them 8-1 thus far
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Yes lucky I found them but I'll never stop betting my own, any gambler knows what Im talking about
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Bc Im a degenerate idiot who cant resist, so I just bet less on mine, is that what u want to hear?
@CarydashM I will keep you informed, problem is you probably won't believe me anyways. Looks like I'm going to split tonight so 8-1 looming.
@CarydashMYou Maybe you should stick to horses than, there's a saying gotta be good to be lucky so I know I would if I made a hit like that.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u Then why engage in pointless and meaningless conversation? .. Ok well up to you, don't say I didn't offer.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Who said I'm not living the high life? lol .. You seem to assume a lot without knowing anything.
@CarydashM Good luck with that.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo I clearly said I bet 1k on my own &amp; 5k on each VIP I get from them, learn to read bro!
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Then u'll probably have to quit as no one can win on theyre own, MS are the 1st Ive seen that can.
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo 400G? lol Anyone making that kind of money wouldn't have been on the same plays as I pick. :)
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u Bud I will give you my 2 NFL VIP's that I'm on right now if you want, currently in play, then what will you say?
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo That makes no sense lol, I mean I surely would to if I was a service &amp; won that much, wouldn't u!?
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo Dude they have 2 clubs, Regular &amp; VIP. Im only on the VIP which they dont play everyday, Ive had 7 &amp; won them all
Loved the first one! https://t.co/JBgiassqCs
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Listen man no offense but I can afford to, I purchase the 3 packs and bet 5k per play, 7-0 = BIG$!
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Dont believe my 7-0 but r u saying they're 1st 6 mo of results are fraud to? Some food for thought
@CarydashM @Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo Why because you say so? &amp; based on those 2 picks u gave me the other night u might wanna join 2 ;)
@CarydashM @SportsInvestCo They're 78% record was based on they're VIP over the 1st yr, I'm 7-0 since I started so no reason not to believe.
@SportsInvestCo Your so delusional bro if you think I am them lol, u seriously need some help. I'll hype any1 this good, 1st time Im winning
@SportsInvestCo How is that a fact? Have u ever paid them a penny? My guess is you simply are jealous and can't afford them to try yourself.

@SportsInvestCo It's funny how tough people are behind a computer, you and your free pick twitter account, you must be so proud of it. lol
@SportsInvestCo Jealous maybe? lol..I find it funny the only guys crying are the ones who haven't paid them a penny!..I'm happy bud, up big.
@CarydashM Why do you think I chose them.
@CarydashM Maybe they do, either way I could care less, all that matters to me is winning.

@Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo What are you talking about .. Are you high bro? .. I'm on they're VIP, a more than happy 4-0 thus far, you?
@MTLSYNDICATE @CarydashM I'm paying them bro and I can assure you it's been far better then slots! :)
@Sharpwagers4u @SportsInvestCo You don't care? .. That's why you wrote that message then lol .. Have you ever paid them a penny? .. Doubt it
