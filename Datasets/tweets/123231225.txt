He's exactly right. "There’s a huge cost to our economy, to our health, to our national security if we do not act," said 2020 presidential candidate @JayInslee on @ThisWeekABC. "But there’s an enormous economic advantage if we embrace clean energy." https://t.co/SIb5gpCuWM
@PaulEDawson Yes, putting a price on carbon emissions would be huge! Check out the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act in the U.S. House of Representatives: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M. It will reduce U.S. emissions at least 40% in the first 12 years, and 90% by 2050. #PriceOnPollution
@Saraswatikhalsa @bradplumer We always try to pair discussions of climate impacts with discussions of climate solutions, too! We're supporting the bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763 - https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M) which brings hope and encouragement to any climate conversation.
At a recent congressional hearing, Texas Republican @RepBillFlores said, "Climate change is real. The question is: how do we deal with it?” @AEI's @AlexBrill_DC and Alex Flint want a #PriceOnPollution. https://t.co/RqjODE2IU6
A #PriceOnPollution will spur innovation and emissions reductions in every part of the economy, including air travel. Electric airplanes are "one of the hottest topics at the moment in aircraft engineering." #climate @umairfan https://t.co/xufmPSyAcV
@kateschapira @DanRubin13 @Kathryn_Tait @Women_and_Fish @FridaHylander @RollingStone @reneelertzman @ClimatePsych Wonderful conversation here, thank you all! We're reading and learning.

@1stMrScott @AFeldman2 @ChrisCoons Hi there! The bill has not yet been reintroduced in the Senate. You can give your senators a call and encourage them to step up as an original cosponsor! Here's a calling tool: https://t.co/o6aValoIFd
"Weather is a staple of small talk and shared experience," writes @bradplumer. "That can make it a simple but powerful opportunity to discuss global warming." Do you bring up #climatechange in casual conversation? https://t.co/sofmFDNoQm
NASA scientist James Hansen says, "Climate change is incredibly urgent and serious, as I warned Congress when I testified in 1988. This bill gives us the chance to fight it seriously and on a big scale." See more support for the Energy Innovation Act here: https://t.co/rEV3lCvO1N https://t.co/x5bzlO02Pj
ICYMI: CCL's @JimTolbertNC published an op-ed inviting conservatives to take climate action. "It is critical for conservative thought leaders like those at #CPAC2019 to help set a responsible path forward to the clean energy economy of the future." https://t.co/LAHn6hGlUh
With billions relying on the seas for food, this may be the most alarming consequence of #climatechange. @KendraWrites    https://t.co/GEInDhv4Ln
Thank you, Peter! Yes, let's take that much-needed first step with a robust price on carbon that would be implemented with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. 6 Dem cosponsors also cosponsored GND: https://t.co/CcCmj50Xei https://t.co/UTOPq3za2x
@MichaelRenoNV @TallPhilosopher @capitalpress One step at a time... But this is a pretty big step.
@KathMorrow90 The "study" he cites comes from the Fraser Institute, a denier think tank funded by the Koch Brothers. Need we say more? https://t.co/9ooWHkWv0c
@GreenFireHVAC @MichaelRenoNV @capitalpress Agreed! Let's get something passed that will start bringing down emissions, like the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. It has bipartisan appeal, which is necessary for passage. https://t.co/CcCmj50Xei
@aubreygci @Tav_assoli With the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, the price DOES rise substantially, increasing by $10 a ton each year. That's gets us to $100 a ton within a decade. Long-term investments -- power plants, autos, energy efficiency -- will be made with that $100 price in mind.
Democracy is out best weapon against #climatechange. Join us in Washington this June as we lobby for passage of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. #PriceOnPollution Register now: https://t.co/nv4J0loisr https://t.co/IOq6phVIxA
A carbon pricing exemption for farmers is key to getting support in the ag community, and that's what the #EnergyInnovationAct provides while also getting 90% emissions reduction by 2050. #climatechange @capitalpress https://t.co/AHdBqXZK2v

@JacquelynGill Thanks for sharing and for calling your members of Congress!
@Enviro_Voter Congratulations! Thanks for the important work you do.
@Dentedpat @drvox Hi Patrick! The bill's reduction schedule targets at least 40% by 2030. We're not saying this bill is the only action needed, but it can get us significantly down the road. Plus, it's in Congress right now, with more cosponsors joining each week. Let's do this and more!
Hunters and fishermen see firsthand the ways #climate change affects people's livelihoods and hobbies. The @SPORTSMANchnl will show a short film on climate change, called "In the Heart of the Rockies," tonight at 7:30 ET. Tune in: https://t.co/VqwNfaO6dJ @ConservationHwk https://t.co/hmz2S1HgmV
@JohnKasich @UBC Absolutely! We think the #BipartisanClimate bill in the House, the Energy Innovation Act, is a great place to start. Details about the policy, its cosponsors, and its public supporters are here: https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk
@axios Thank you for speaking up on this important issue, @JohnKasich! We hope to see Republican support grow for a bipartisan carbon pricing bill in the House right now called the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763 - https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk).
"Let’s have conservatives have a discussion instead of being in denial that this is a problem," @JohnKasich says on #climatechange. 		In a speech tonight, he will express support for policies like carbon pricing and subsidies for clean tech. #EcoRight https://t.co/aCS2TQ6WE6
@RadReduction Thanks, we'll take a look!
@DanRubin13 Great tips, Dan! We do a lot of communications training like this with our volunteers so they can have productive climate conversations. It's so important!
@Bram_R That's fair! CCL definitely respects that the Green New Deal name and goals are distinct. Using that name was an editorial choice on the part of the Washington Post.
@drvox GND folks definitely don't need to calm down--the situation IS urgent, and they're right to sound the alarm. But bipartisanship doesn't automatically mean a proposal is useless. The Energy Innovation Act (H.R. 763) is bipartisan and targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050.
@brianschatz A #PriceOnPollution. There's a bipartisan bill right now in the House called the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763 - https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M) that would reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% in 12 years, and 90% by 2050. That's major!
The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763) welcomes a new cosponsor! Rep. @janschakowsky, a member of the @EnergyCommerce committee, has just signed on. #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
In the @ladailynews, local climate advocate Jordan Sollitto writes, "Leadership like that shown by @RepJudyChu and her congressional co-sponsors of HR763 is imperative and profoundly important if we are to avoid the worst possible #climate eventualities." https://t.co/mI8GI15vIQ
@mrmatthewtaylor Wow. Thank you for bringing this story to people's attention.
@AlexandriaV2005 @GretaThunberg Thank you for everything you're doing to raise the urgency of this issue!
@erinbiba Every. Time.
@nattyover Wow. Thank you for the important work you're doing to tell this story.
@drvox Great point! This same type of thinking drives our org to be nonpartisan: People shouldn't have to ascribe to a certain set of political beliefs or change their identities to care about climate. It can be a bridge that connects us, not a wedge that drives us further apart.
@noahqk @AOC @SenMarkey @SenFeinstein @RepTedDeutch Thanks Noah, we are too! It's wonderful to be discussing concrete solutions rather than debating the existence of the problem.
A strong #PriceOnPollution is a crucial step, and more can be done, the @washingtonpost says. "In the fight against climate change, the government must enlist the whole economy. Start with carbon pricing. Then fill in the gaps." Read the full piece here: https://t.co/04tEudoEfE
#GreenNewDeal supporters "are right that a big problem requires a big solution. Only one serious option — putting a #PriceOnCarbon — would encourage every sector of the economy to green up in equal measure," says the @washingtonpost editorial board.
"The revenue from carbon pricing could be recycled back to Americans in a progressive way, and most people would end up whole or better off." That's exactly what the Energy Innovation Act (H.R. 763) would do. #PriceOnPollution @RepTedDeutch @RepRooney https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
"The @IPCC_CH found last year that an average carbon price of $100, $200 or even $300 per ton of CO2 would result in huge greenhouse-gas emissions cuts" and "restrain warming to the lowest safety threshold of 1.5°C." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/04tEudGfEe
"A high-enough carbon price would shape millions of choices about what to buy, how to invest and how to live that would result in substantial emissions cuts." The Energy Innovation Act is just such a carbon price, resulting in 90% emissions cuts by 2050. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
A #PriceOnPollution has worked before, and it can work again. "It is the policy that ended acid rain, ahead of schedule and more cheaply than projected," the @washingtonpost reminds readers. Let's do the same with greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change.
In an editorial this weekend, the @washingtonpost offered an incredibly strong endorsement of carbon pricing to combat #climate change. The editorial board says, "It is imperative to act. And carbon pricing is the best first-line policy." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/04tEudGfEe

@13ShannonWade Hey Shannon! As far as specific climate policy, you might check out the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act in the House (H.R. 763 - https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M). It would put a #PriceOnPollution and drive down carbon emissions 40% in 12 years, and 90% by 2050.
@cmclymer @AOC There's another solid plan on the table called the Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act. It's a #PriceOnPollution that targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050. Several #GreenNewDeal cosponsors are also sponsors of this bill! Check it out: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M

@briangcronin @Tav_assoli Yes, everyone gets the same dividend. It's then a question of how much of the dividend you get to keep after paying higher fuel costs associated with the fee. Those with a high carbon footprint, who tend to be wealthier, will pay out more than they'll receive.
@JohnCarolin @Tectomancer @JohnDelaney Using abusive language does not bolster one's argument, Derek. All it does is get you blocked. Good bye.

@SaraWatchorn Thanks for the shout out!
Republicans @repgregwalden, @RepFredUpton &amp; @RepShimkus write that they want "realistic, innovative &amp; free-market strategies to promote a cleaner environment &amp; to reduce emissions." The Energy Innovation Act fits the bill &amp; has support from Democrats too. https://t.co/JT1p1FilMT
@AnuLannen @bradplumer @yayitsrob @EnergyInnovLLC Hi Anu! Are you familiar with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763 - https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M) in Congress right now? It was introduced a few weeks ago. It's a bipartisan carbon pricing bill that protects people financially through monthly dividends.
@PeteMarshRE Thanks Pete! Glad to hear you enjoyed @dana1981's presentation and his book.

@CCL_WATriCities @TallPhilosopher Hi folks! Diesel or gas used for agricultural purposes only account for .6% of national emissions. This bill will spur innovation that will spill over into agriculture and therefore decrease that already low percentage of emissions.

@SiegelScribe @dcexaminer Great quote from @RoKhanna: “Carbon pricing is absolutely necessary from an economic perspective. The question is, who does the price fall on?

Tell your representatives that you support it, and you hope they do too: https://t.co/6xwsLWXNb7 https://t.co/E5wqO9btmo
"We've been here before and we know how to fix things, if we want to," writes this columnist in the @dallasnews. We addressed acid rain and ozone depletion, and we can tackle carbon emissions too. #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/TWL8yKqKIk
We need to turn this trend around. It's time for a nationwide #PriceOnPollution to drive our emissions down. #climate @dpcarrington  https://t.co/sSAxBBGqcJ

@jim_gruman Hi Jim! CCL lobbies for carbon fee &amp; dividend (https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M), which would implement a price on carbon and return revenue to households. Those already using low-carbon energy will be ahead of the game and will see even more benefit from their monthly carbon dividend.
A blessing from the Church! The chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops "welcomed the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act] as an important step forward in addressing climate change." @BishopDewane  #climatechange #PriceOnPollution  https://t.co/6pU3Y4ODp0 https://t.co/F8fLYKGK1v

@Matt_Bowman96 @justinhendrix Hi Matt! The bill dropped this morning, so it hasn't been assigned a bill number quite yet. In the last Congress it was H.R. 7173: https://t.co/RpPc5Y2rd5 (There have been some changes, such as the rate of increase being indexed to inflation, but it is essentially the same.)
@justinhendrix It's sad and scary to think about, for sure. This bill in Congress might give you some encouragement: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M). It targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050 &amp; it's bipartisan. Feel free to DM if you want to chat more!
@AmyAHarder Thanks for covering this news, Amy!

@RepCharlieCrist Thank you for your leadership on this issue, Rep. Crist!
@paleosurface Thanks Ian! The carbon price continues to increase year over year, so the bill targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050. That tracks closely with the recommendations from the UN's IPCC report. There's no other policy on the table to spur decarbonization as deeply as this one.

@keithalexander @kcoplan Hi Keith! Since the fee will be applied upstream, fossil fuel companies will pay it. As it goes up, they will be motivated to invest in cleaner, cheaper energy. Meanwhile, folks will get a monthly dividend to manage any cost increases. More details here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@ClimateHuman Great thread, Peter, with some very important points. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
Without a nationwide #PriceOnPollution in place, these authors argue, Americans are paying a "do-nothing climate tax" and struggling with "hidden, unfair and ever-increasing" costs of extreme weather. @PennLaw @marknevitt https://t.co/3oacqaiPls
@autonomeee @umairfan The price goes up $10 each year, so it reaches $100 a ton within a decade.
More and more Americans are expressing concern about #climatechange, putting pressure on Congress to take action. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is the first step to bring things under control. #PriceOnPollution   https://t.co/tmYejzudUH https://t.co/IogN2Bm7KV
@autonomeee @umairfan A carbon price of $100 per ton is more than a "tweak," as the Huffpost story suggests. Also, we've never said that a price on carbon is the only solution needed, but that it is the best first step.

Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen says, “Carbon dividends is the most cost-effective, equitable and politically-viable climate solution.” And this type of policy is already on the table in Congress: the Energy Innovation Act. Read more from @SiegelScribe: https://t.co/Dr0HgtHNnb
@business They're actually endorsing a #PriceOnPollution for all fossil fuels, not simply gas. Fossil fuel companies would pay the price, and people would receive a regular dividend. This way people are supported, not burdened, as we transition to a clean energy economy.
@JustinTrudeau Thank you for your leadership in putting a #PriceOnPollution! We're glad these expert economists support the fee-and-dividend approach, and we're supporting policy in the U.S. Congress to make it a reality: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk

If you'd like to chat with our Conservative Outreach Director, he's on Twitter: @JimTolbertNC. You can learn more about the bill Kelli mentioned here: https://t.co/Z4A7I4hrCV
Rep. @FrankPallone, chair of the House Energy &amp; Commerce committee, says climate change is "not just [an environmental issue]. It’s a health issue, and it’s an economic issue." A #PriceOnPollution like the Energy Innovation Act will improve all three. https://t.co/JZVSRZNKg4
@SolarInMASS @mc2maven @briangcronin We're working closely with many members' offices on the bill, but as with any legislation, what really moves the needle is constituents getting engaged. If you feel strongly about it, then make sure your voice is heard directly in Congress.
Speaking about the recent #COP24, @KHayhoe says it's "like a global pot luck in which every nation brings something different to the party. For some it’s soil conservation, for another wind power or carbon pricing." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/PZFgB4FiWO
@SolarInMASS @mc2maven @briangcronin Thanks for sharing your thoughts, everyone. If you'd like to see changes to the Energy Innovation Act, we encourage you to reach out to the bill's sponsors and your own representatives with your feedback. They're the ones who ultimately decide what the bill contains.
First big opportunity to meet with your members of Congress about #climatechange solutions is the recess starting Jan. 21. Join a CCL chapter near you to have a seat at the table.  https://t.co/cwMZsMmc1v
@SolarInMASS @briangcronin Yep. The end result is much better than what would happen with regulations. Also, no solution will be enacted without bipartisan support. Regulatory relief is the carrot that brings Republicans on board.
Our brains tell us we're powerless to stop #climatechange or that somebody else will handle it. Guess what, folks? It's up to us, and working together we can lick this thing. @MoNscience  #PriceOnPollution  https://t.co/V6vMJh0j0v
@MarkRuffalo Thanks for speaking up on #climatechange, Mark. Have you heard about bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act? Gives revenue from carbon fee back to people and generates 90% GHG reductions by 2050. https://t.co/CcCmj50Xei
@SolarInMASS @briangcronin First, there are no regulations on GHG's currently in effect. The Clean Power Plan was suspended by the administration. Second, the emissions reductions under this legislation would be greater than reductions achieved by the CPP. We lose nothing with this regulatory relief.
@mc2maven @jgkoomey @CMU_EPP @CostaSamaras @inesliaz @AOC @sunrisemvmt Absolutely! No reason why we can't do all of these.
@SolarInMASS Are you referring to the carbon border fee adjustment?
Work for a business or belong to an organization/church that believes in environmental responsibility? Ask if they'll endorse the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act! Such support can make a difference with members of Congress. #climatechange  https://t.co/Kto93kLb3J https://t.co/5aVP1WLsU1

More evidence that the political winds are shifting on #climatechange. As they shift, more Republicans in Congress can be expected to come to the table on solutions. #PriceOnPollution @JonathonSchuldt   https://t.co/3lTNA4qUNa
@CampsNP Please engage your Rep for ideas on how we might address this problem either at re-introduction, or as the bill works its way through committee. (3/3)
@CampsNP HR 7173 sends the dividend to residents with a valid SSN or Tax Identification Number. However, just because we couldn't find a way to make this work doesn't mean we're not still looking! (2/3)
@CampsNP This is something CCL has always been very worried about. We have been searching for ways to make this happen, but have not been able to get around the fact that we need to be able to find people to send them the dividend, and that requires documents. (1/3)
@vwallin Understand where you're coming from. We often talk about getting outside our comfort zone, and @MarkReynoldsCCL provided an example of how to do that.
The new Congress has started! Write to your members of Congress and ask them to support the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. Your voice is needed now! #climatechange #PriceOnPollution   https://t.co/BJvhExUVd6 https://t.co/uYeCc4Islc
Indeed, @SpeakerPelosi, Congress must act on #climatechange. A solution that appeals to both Democrats and Republicans is the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. @RepTedDeutch @RepRooney @RepBrianFitz @CNNPolitics https://t.co/LVsLj6l2xp
@mc2maven @IPCC Appreciate the shoutout, Brinda!

Nice shoutout for CCL in this @sltrib piece. Bottom line: You can make a difference by working with like-minded groups. #climatechange #PriceOnPollution    https://t.co/ew2aF6m9z3
@usefulDesign @KateAronoff @paulkrugman With a carbon price in place, businesses and industries throughout our economy will find cleaner, cheaper energy options to produce their goods and provide their services. Once that happens, individual consumers will have lots more clean, cheap options to choose from.
@usefulDesign @MarkReynoldsCCL @paulkrugman And on your second question: Someone's personal fossil fuel use is not a factor in the dividend they receive. Everyone will receive the same dividend. You can learn more about the Energy Innovation Act and how it works here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M. Thanks for your interest!
@usefulDesign @MarkReynoldsCCL @paulkrugman Sure, good questions! To answer your first one: Each adult will receive a full dividend, and each child will receive a half share, no matter the configuration of the "household" (single adult, single parent, two-parent household, etc.)
@DrRamBio Feel free to DM us if you want to really dig into the nitty gritty, which can be tough to do with character limits on Twitter. And happy New Year!
@DrRamBio Hi Ramesh, it does! Section 9902(d) in the bill exempts or refunds the carbon fee for non-emitting products like polymers and asphalt. The bill doesn't spell out exactly who gets the refund; it's left up to the program administrators to work out those details.
@PeterDBuckland @FergusonTwpPA Awesome! Yes, it's going to take a lot of action from a lot of different angles. Thanks for what you're doing!
@SenWhitehouse @IMFNews Thanks for always speaking up about climate change, Senator. You're absolutely right that a #PriceOnPollution is crucial to spur innovation and drive emissions down. We're looking forward to the progress of the Energy Innovation Act in the new Congress: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
The @PostOpinions staff says, "Taking these actions could help start the planet down a path toward a better future." Among them? Putting a #PriceOnPollution, as the bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act would. https://t.co/anHkVk4gCw
@JohnCornyn There are solutions out there that can address climate change while also helping other pressing issues, like public health and the economy. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is one that has bipartisan support in both the House and Senate: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
A majority of Americans know climate change is a big, human-caused problem. @MarkReynoldsCCL appeared on primetime Fox News to tell viewers about one tool to address it: a #PriceOnPollution that allocates a carbon dividend to households.

This was an encouraging year for our volunteers north of the border. After nearly 800 meetings between @CitizensLobbyCa and members of Parliament over the last 8 years, Canada announced it will implement a fee-and-dividend style #PriceOnPollution in 2019! https://t.co/o6ItOVZ568
.@BrookingsInst economist @AdeleCMorris is an expert on carbon pricing and its effects. She says, "A carbon price lowers emissions, and it can lower emissions very dramatically and very quickly." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/kn86vFyMBE
@davidsirota Carbon pricing has pretty broad support, not just within the GOP. Check out the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which has bipartisan sponsorship in both the House and the Senate: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M #PriceOnPollution
@KateAronoff We agree that it will take a lot to decarbonize the economy, but carbon pricing policies like the Energy Innovation Act can go pretty far. This one targets 40% emissions reductions in 12 years and 90% by 2050: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@drvox Exactly. And when structured correctly, a carbon price can be a powerful tool with diverse support across the political spectrum.
@JohnCornyn @HolmanJenkins @WSJopinion A carbon price is popular not just on the right, but with many across the political spectrum. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is a good example, with bipartisan sponsorship in the House and Senate. #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@DrRamBio Hi Ramesh! A carbon price is popular not just with conservatives, but with many across the political spectrum. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is a good example, with bipartisan sponsorship in the House and Senate. #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@bradplumer Specifics are definitely helpful. What do you think about the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which has bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050? https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@JustinHGillis And as you said, "The economic theory is right: We do need a price on carbon. Some of our most important goals are likely to be impossible to achieve without it." We can, and must, do a lot to address climate change. Let's push for a carbon price and do even more. (3/3)
@JustinHGillis That original bipartisan support is unique, especially on climate policy this bold, which targets 40% emissions reductions in 12 years and 90% by 2050. It shows the national politics are aligned better than ever before for this important policy. (2/)
@JustinHGillis Hi Justin! Thanks for saying this: "I am in favor of passing new carbon prices everywhere that the politics seem aligned to make it possible." In the last few weeks, a #PriceOnPollution bill was introduced by Rs and Ds in the House and Senate. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M (1/)

@OsitaNwanevu True, it's going to take a lot to fully address climate change. There's a carbon pricing bill in the House &amp; Senate called the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act that would go a long way, though: 40% emissions reductions in 12 years &amp; 90% by 2050. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M

Nice! UK renewables hit a new record last quarter by providing 33% of the grid's energy. A #PriceOnPollution will speed up the transition to a clean-energy economy. @adamvaughan_uk #climate https://t.co/kBjxZtsjPt
@2Anoinfringing @usefulDesign @lectcs @XmetalmikeyX @Pam1010101010 @Ocasio2018 The policy we advocate for gives a monthly dividend to people so they'll be protected from any price increases. Meanwhile, industries will shift to cleaner options and make EVs, renewable energy, etc. more affordable and available. You can learn more here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@DavidFore @drvox @SenWhitehouse We wouldn't say superior, since the Green New Deal idea has much broader aims than this specific policy. But the Energy Innovation Act would reduce carbon emissions deeply and quickly, which we all agree needs to happen to stabilize our climate! https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@usefulDesign @2Anoinfringing @lectcs @XmetalmikeyX @Pam1010101010 @Ocasio2018 Economists concede there are times when the market fails, as it has with fossil fuels.

@CurmudgeonCD21 @briangcronin That's certainly an option for Congress to consider (and they should consider lots of climate policy options). The unique value of this plan is that by returning a monthly dividend to people, the policy drives emissions down &amp; protects most people financially at the same time.
@QuinnsHere Thank you, that's valuable feedback and a fair point. We'll take another look at that, because we absolutely welcome (and expect!) additional measures to combat climate change and don't want to indicate otherwise.
@jaydesh7 @thehill Gotcha! Yes, there's certainly a robust discussion happening on climate policy right now, and it's really capturing attention. That's encouraging because this problem is so urgent, and we need good, strong solutions as soon as possible.

@swampsteve @TopherSpiro Informed or not, every American would receive a monthly carbon dividend under this plan &amp; most would come out financially ahead. That's big for building support, because it's a concrete benefit folks can see in their budget. Check out more details here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
@swampsteve @TopherSpiro Good question! Climate advocates did a lot of wonderful work in Washington, but that proposal still did not have bipartisan support. The Energy Innovation Act does have bipartisan support, both in Congress and across the country, which is crucial for any strong, lasting policy.
@TopherSpiro Good point, Topher. It's a huge piece of the puzzle. The UN's own IPCC report said carbon pricing will be "central to mitigation" of climate change. This policy in particular targets at least 40% emissions reductions in 12 years and 90% by 2050.
@jaydesh7 @thehill Hey Jay! This policy and the Green New Deal aren't at odds. The Green New Deal hasn't articulated specific policy recommendations yet, but a policy like this would go a long way toward achieving the emissions reductions we all want to see: at least 40% in 12 years &amp; 90% by 2050.
@WesleyS97909033 @thehill Hi Wesley! This policy will give a monthly carbon dividend to people, and economic evaluations show that most people would see a financial benefit from this type of policy. Here's more about how it works: https://t.co/N7S94PReKw
@HaeffnerP @thehill Hi Gayle! There are some regional policies in place but none are a straightforward #PriceOnPollution, and there is no nationwide policy in place addressing greenhouse gas emissions. This one would be the first! Check it out: https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk
@Steve3449 @thehill Macron's policies didn't have protections built in to help people through the transition financially. This policy would return a carbon dividend to all Americans every month, and most would see a financial benefit. https://t.co/N7S94PReKw
@hughjasole75 @thehill Hi Hugh! Here's how the policy works: https://t.co/N7S94PReKw Economists agree it's the most efficient way to reduce emissions, and the UN's IPCC report said carbon pricing will be "central to mitigation" of climate change. This policy targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050.
@benintn @thehill Given this bill's traction in the House, it's meaningful that these members introduced it in the Senate as well. They helped lay out markers for a bipartisan and now bicameral climate conversation in the new session of Congress. https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk

@Cardkillah @JimTolbertNC @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons The policy is written to automatically sunset after the dividend payment has been less than $20 per month for 3 consecutive years.

@ZiggyRichards @phidippides26 @KateAronoff @ExtinctionR @sunrisemvmt We are deeply grateful for what others are doing in the climate space to raise the issue and advance the conversation. It's going to take a lot to solve this massive challenge. We're working on this piece of the solution, and we're glad others are working on other angles, too.
@ZiggyRichards @phidippides26 @KateAronoff @ExtinctionR @sunrisemvmt Correct, our organization has never said a carbon pricing is the only policy needed to address the huge problem of climate change. We have, though, chosen to focus in an incredibly concentrated way on getting this policy in place, since it will reduce emissions in a major way.
@KateAronoff Hi Kate, just to clarify that while the Energy Innovation Act the senators just introduced is similar to the one you're referencing, there is no forgiveness of fossil fuel companies' liability in their bill, nor in the House version (HR 7173). https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@KateAronoff Hi Kate! This carbon pricing policy is certainly not all we need, but it would go a long way. It targets at least 40% emissions reductions in 12 years &amp; 90% by 2050. It gives a dividend to people every month. Congress could pursue this policy and do more! https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M

They will move toward providing their products and services cleaner, cheaper options, which will reduce the carbon intensity of the entire economy.
@TallPhilosopher @MarkReynoldsCCL @dcexaminer @SiegelScribe Hi John! This bill targets 40% emissions reductions in 12 years &amp; 90% reductions by 2050. That tracks closely with the recommendations from the UN. Plus, this analysis from @noahqk shows it's a more strongly rising price than any other proposal out there: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt
@Cardkillah @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons This bill is specifically designed to give the revenue to Americans in the form of a monthly dividend so folks are protected financially while the U.S. transitions to a clean-energy economy. Check out how it works: https://t.co/N7S94Q8Q96
@Jondoespolitics @ChrisCoons @RobSandIA @JeffFlake Hi Jon! You can learn more about how the bill works here: https://t.co/N7S94Q8Q96 The fee is applied to fossil fuels, and it drives down carbon pollution because companies will move toward cleaner, cheaper options. In the meantime, the dividend protects most people financially.

Both chambers of Congress and both parties are ready to put an ambitious #PriceOnPollution to address climate change. Learn more: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M https://t.co/XJ3jyXLDqf
The so-called "pause" was #climatechange skeptics' biggest talking point. Now that it's thoroughly debunked, let's move the conversation to solutions, like the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. #PriceOnPollution @mckennapr   https://t.co/br8W7V6giv…
@MichaelRenoNV @atrembath @SenJohnBarrasso Innovation certainly plays a big role in the transition to a cleaner economy, and an effective price on carbon will provide the incentive to speed up that transition.
@cclchicagoland @_TonyBriscoe @chicagoclimate Indeed, we would love to connect about this bipartisan solution to #climatechange. More info about this legislation here: https://t.co/CcCmj50Xei
@SaraWatchorn Thanks for the support, Sara!
@IPLdmv @councilofdc Very exciting to see that it passed! Congrats and thank you for all your hard work!
@SierraDC Very exciting to see that it passed! Congrats and thank you for all your hard work!
The #CleanEnergyDC bill is "one of the nation’s most ambitious clean energy bills to date," writes @mje415 for @MotherJones. Congratulations to all the advocates, including CCL's own @JamieDeMarco1, who worked in support of this #PriceOnPollution. https://t.co/GXeWUQlGmp
Major news: The D.C. City Council just passed the #CleanEnergyDC Act of 2018. It places a #PriceOnPollution and requires the District to run on 100% renewable energy by 2032. https://t.co/GXeWUQlGmp
@PaulPolman Yes! This fee-and-dividend style plan, which protects most people financially, is in Congress right now in the form of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. It has 8 cosponsors so far and will be re-introduced in the new Congress. Details here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
Wow! 9 states plus Washington, D.C., have agreed to work together to put a regional price on carbon emissions from transportation. Read more from @BostonGlobe's @davabel. https://t.co/QTUwzptA2U
@atrembath @SenJohnBarrasso Yes, building political will for any major legislation is definitely a process. Our volunteers (more than 100k in the U.S.) are enthusiastically behind this policy, and they're growing support in their communities and with their members of Congress every day.
@atrembath @SenJohnBarrasso That bill will drive down carbon emissions, encourage innovation, and protect people financially as we transition to a clean-energy economy. Sponsors plan to re-introduce it in the new Congress. Check it out: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M (2/2)
@atrembath @SenJohnBarrasso Innovation is definitely a huge piece of the puzzle. This op-ed isn't exactly right that people "across the world" are rejecting carbon pricing, though. Eight of the Senator's own colleagues in Congress are sponsoring H.R. 7173, a #PriceOnPollution bill. (1/2)
@rldesmondjr @Ocasio2018 Hi Bob! If climate policies are designed well, low &amp; middle-income folks will be protected as we transition to a clean-energy economy. Check out the Energy Innovation Act (H.R. 7173), which does that with a carbon price and a monthly dividend to people: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@MishaInTheCloud @sandrockcstm @Ocasio2018 Hi Misha! One part of the "how" could be a carbon price—the UN says a #PriceOnPollution will be "central" to mitigating climate change. Check out the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 7173), which will be re-introduced in the new Congress: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@MMCD1204 @Ocasio2018 Hey Mike! A well-designed carbon price can actually address climate change while helping low- and middle-income people financially. Check out the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act in the House, which would give a monthly dividend back to people: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
@isurusen @Ocasio2018 There's a bill like that in the House right now, actually! It's the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which would put a #PriceOnPollution and give a monthly dividend to people, protecting most low- and middle-income people financially. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
The Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 7173) fits the bill. It will allocate a monthly dividend to people, protecting them economically, and it will drive down carbon emissions at least 40% in 12 years. Learn more about this #PriceOnPollution: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
That's exactly what a well-designed #PriceOnPollution does: protects people through the transition to a clean-energy economy. @DorfmanJeffrey points out that one "politically palatable" approach would be "returning the money in the form of a per capita dividend."
Weighing in about the #GiletsJaunes demonstrations, @universityofga professor @DorfmanJeffrey says: "To appease those concerned about the environment and inequality at the same time, an economy-wide carbon tax would be superior to fossil-fuel taxes." https://t.co/H02FCrsln2
@maggie_shober @drvox Hi Maggie, economists have looked at the effects of carbon tax proposals in the U.S. Check out this analysis from Columbia University's @noahqk: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt He called the recent Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act in the House a "highly progressive policy."
@Scotophile @HirokoTabuchi Nice, thanks for sharing the news!
Looking ahead to the 116th Congress, @SenMarkey says, "We must lay down the markers for putting a price on carbon in order to achieve the massive reductions in carbon emissions that science demands." We agree that it's high time for a #PriceOnPollution. https://t.co/7A9QmKmgmh
“A zero-emission public bus fleet means cleaner air for all of us." @HirokoTabuchi reports the switch will also save "as much as $1.5 billion in maintenance, fuel and other costs by 2050." #Climate action is good for health and good for the economy, too. https://t.co/OtZf5ydxoM
Experts at #COP24 said it's "more &amp; more evident" that "countries cannot cope" with climate change. That's why we support putting a #PriceOnPollution with the Energy Innovation Act—we must reduce our carbon emissions &amp; stabilize our climate. @lauriegoering https://t.co/Hh9QPKkUmp
This @nytimes piece calls #redtide "a devastating consequence of unchecked human activity made worse by warming water temperature." Even months after the biggest headlines, the economic effects are devastating. @PatriciaMazzei https://t.co/5UCrnQdzhd
This week, @MeghnaWBUR and @katemyoder discussed the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act on NPR's @OnPointRadio. Bill sponsor @RepCharlieCrist joined the conversation too. Listen to the segment here: https://t.co/4CG7fpIb65
In an editorial about the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, the @pbpost in Palm Beach says, "It’s a brilliant idea." The #PriceOnPollution bill is sponsored by @RepTedDeutch, @RepRooney, and six other representatives in the House. https://t.co/pITxXE90hD
As #COP24 winds down it's clear the U.S. must get back to leading the world on #climatechange solutions. We can start by enacting Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. #PriceOnPollution  https://t.co/O0dmpoINPb https://t.co/8wooBM4hQb
As Katharine @KHayhoe says in this @TEDTalks, we have to talk to people about #climatechange, and the people we really need to talk to are our members of Congress.      https://t.co/BBbhxpucVX
This op-ed from CCL's @MarkReynoldsCCL explains the need to hear concerns about #climatechange policies and respond with measures that are good for both people and the climate. #PriceOnPollutions   https://t.co/VTAPqCa0Gw

@heidi_k_edmonds @StephenWoroniec @germanacanzi @ExtinctionR @GretaThunberg @sunrisemvmt @CCL_Aus Thx, Heidi! Yes, the Green New Deal and carbon pricing are completely compatible strategies. Let's do both. Australia has had difficult go with carbon pricing, but a fee with revenue given to the people can win public support.
Empowered citizens drove the introduction of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, and they will drive its passage next year. Your gift to CCE will provide the resources to help them get the job done. #climatechange #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/S6yK5nVhUd https://t.co/CjUpWqKQlE
@BOB_1and_only @RepTedDeutch Hi Bob! As far as reducing carbon emissions, the Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act is much more than a half measure. It boldly targets at least 40% emissions reductions in 12 years, and 90% by 2050. That tracks closely with the UN's recommendations. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@KNVC_Radio Thanks for having Chas on the show and covering this important topic!
@burntcitybeer Thanks so much for the shout out and for the contributions! They'll go a long way as we work to address climate change with a #PriceOnPollution bill like this one: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
Because of the endangerment finding, the government has a mandate to protect Americans from the harm that greenhouse gas emissions cause. Time for Congress to price carbon! #climatechange @mlavelles  https://t.co/q6wivlQaZV
What's on your holiday list? The writer of this op-ed in the @ABQJournal  wants Congress to enact a #climatechange solution, and the Energy Innovations and Carbon Dividend Act "is everything I have wished for."  https://t.co/reNVSELBP0 #abq
As the world stumbles on climate action, it becomes more obvious that a #PriceOnCarbon is the motivation needed to reduce emissions. #COP24 #climatechange #PriceOnPollution @SominiSengupta      https://t.co/Nkk87EtoyB
@FirmeMarlo @CitizensLobbyCa @ConnectedCathy @MaryBlakeB @cherylmcnamara @cathylacr01x Thanks for putting this out there, Marlo. People need to know about the good things happening in Canada with carbon pricing.

@MLBinWA Awesome, Matthew! Engagement like this will help push this legislation forward in the new Congress. Thank you!
@joyandfive @ClimateHuman Welcome, Joy!
"The real world is not on track. We need to do more and to do it faster." The US Congress should enact the Energy Innovation Act (H.R. 7173) to meet the UN's climate recommendations and protect low- and middle-income people at the same time. @jonathanwatts https://t.co/3jnaIk8JMh

@EricHolthaus @KHayhoe @ColinOnClimate @sunrisemvmt Exactly! That's why we're excited about the bipartisan Energy Innovation Act (HR 7173). It's an ambitious carbon price that targets at least 40% emissions reductions in 12 years &amp; 90% by 2050. We'd love to hear what you think. Details here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M

@OnPointRadio @katemyoder @RepCharlieCrist Thanks for covering this new bipartisan bill! Folks can learn more about the bill at https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
@greenprofgreen Absolutely! There's a carbon pricing bill in the House right now (HR 7173) that gives the money to people as a monthly dividend, so most low/middle-income people will benefit. A well-designed #PriceOnPollution drives down emissions AND is good for people. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@smarthealthtalk @ProjectDrawdown Thanks for the shout out, Elaine!
@_waleedshahid @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt @justicedems Carbon pricing isn't the only policy we need to tackle climate change, but it would go a long way. This bill targets 40% emissions reductions in 12 years &amp; 90% by 2050. It's bold on climate while protecting vulnerable populations with the monthly dividend. https://t.co/7OFiKMhwZk
@_waleedshahid @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt @justicedems Hi Waleed! There's a carbon pricing bill in the House now that would actually help low- and middle-income folks financially.

Kind words from @ourclimateus about the Energy Innovation Act: "The bill establishes ambitious pollution reduction goals and charts a viable path forward for the U.S. to transition to clean energy. We are proud to support it." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/GUU5MlsOA4
A Pennsylvania constituent wrote an op-ed in @TheIntellNews praising @RepBrianFitz for sponsoring the Energy Innovation Act. "Thanks to our own Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and colleagues from both political parties, there is new hope" on #climate change. https://t.co/cMIpOFRijH
@Poli_Climate Thanks so much for discussing the bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act! If your listeners want to learn more, they can visit https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
"A winning carbon tax strategy would return all the money raised directly to citizens, making the majority of families better off," writes @TedHalstead of @TheCLCouncil in @PostOpinions. The bipartisan Energy Innovation Act (H.R. 7173) does exactly that. https://t.co/nJ0BKlywqj
@PNayomie @ecodads @SaportaReport Hi Nayomie! Every American will receive a dividend and can work on reducing their carbon footprint. The fee will encourage energy companies and businesses of all types to turn to cleaner, cheaper sources, reducing the carbon footprint of our whole economy. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@GreenFireHVAC The article actually does a nice job of showing that we're in agreement on wanting bold climate policy. Our efforts are complementary, and we're all working for a stable climate. Let's use every tool in our toolbox!
@NaturalSystemsE @RepJohnKatko Great news! We love seeing the support this #PriceOnPollution bill has in communities across the country. Thanks for sharing!
@AshleyY99895648 @RepCharlieCrist Hi Ashley! Rep. Crist &amp; 4 colleagues just introduced a major climate bill: the Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act. It targets 40% emissions reductions in 12 years and 90% by 2050. This article from Grist has more about that bill &amp; the Green New Deal: https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
RT @RepCharlieCrist: Thanks to @citizensclimate for unwavering commitment to fighting #climatechange and support for our bipartisan carbon…
@wiegard_chris Hi Chris! The Green New Deal has a much broader scope than the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. But in terms of emissions reductions, this #PriceOnPollution bill would go a long way toward achieving the goal we all want to see: a stable climate.
.@zteirstein ends her piece with: "It’s not a bad notion to try to utilize every single emission-reduction tool we have at our disposal. As we hurtle ever closer to an uninhabitable world, it’s probably worth keeping all our carbon-reducing options open." https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
.@zteirstein adds, "According to Weber of the @sunrisemvmt, 'a carbon tax has the potential' to be a part of the grand solution his group is whipping up support for." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
As #GreenNewDeal supporters &amp; other climate advocates identify what specific policies will help us arrive at a clean energy economy, @JamieDeMarco1 says, "Everyone would agree that you can’t solve this problem without a price on carbon.” #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
.@zteirstein clarifies the conversations aren't mutually exclusive. She quotes CCL staff saying, "We are in agreement that we want to put really bold, ambitious climate policy in place. This carbon pricing bill is a really big step in the right direction.” https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
Here's a great new piece from @zteirstein in @grist. She says the Energy Innovation Act is "the first bipartisan climate bill in Congress in more than a decade" &amp; asks "Why isn’t everyone talking about it?" She notes the momentum for a #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/VUAN7zYVYw
@jmcurtin Thanks Joseph! Sending you a message now.
@jmcurtin Our volunteers regularly meet with their members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, write to local media, and do outreach in their communities about this style of carbon pricing. They'll be pushing hard for more members of Congress to join onto this bill! (2/2)
@jmcurtin Sure, it's a great question! It had 5 original sponsors and has since added 2 more. We anticipate it will be reintroduced in the new Congress, hopefully with even more sponsors. CCL's 100,000+ volunteers in 420 chapters across the U.S. are enthusiastically behind it. (1/2)
@jmcurtin Hey Joseph! What do you think of this new #PriceOnPollution bill just proposed in the U.S. Congress? It has an ambitious rate of increase, allocates the revenue to households, and has bipartisan support. Check it out: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@KateAronoff Definitely not a carbon tax alone, but it can get us pretty far down the road! This new #PriceOnPollution bill targets at least 40% emissions reductions in 12 years, and 90% by 2050. It's also bipartisan and will be re-introduced in the new Congress. https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@drvox Great thread! Thanks as always for your nuanced thoughts. What do you think about the new bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act? @noahqk from @ColumbiaUEnergy published a detailed analysis here: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt
@briandabbs @zcolman @sunrisemvmt It's going to take a lot to get out of this mess, and the IPCC report itself said carbon pricing will be "central to mitigation" of climate change. This bipartisan #PriceOnPollution will reduce our emissions at least 40% in 12 years and 90% by 2050: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@ericwolff @zcolman Hi Eric! This new bill to put a #PriceOnPollution is actually in line with the UN's recommendations for emissions reductions: at least 40% in 12 years, and 90% by 2050. It also has bipartisan support and will be re-introduced in the new Congress: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@AnthonyAdragna @SenJeffMerkley @zcolman @ericwolff How about the new Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act, introduced on Nov. 27 by a bipartisan group of 5 members in the House? It has since gained 2 more cosponsors. To fight climate change, we need concrete policies to reduce emissions. This is one: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
@yayitsrob @zcolman @ericwolff The UN's IPCC report this fall said carbon prices will be "central to mitigation" of climate change. With the bipartisan Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act now on the table, there's no reason to think the US can't have bold vision AND concrete policy: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
ICYMI: @Timothy_Cama &amp; @mirandacgreen call the Energy Innovation Act a "landmark bill" that offers a "bigger cut [to emissions] than former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan or the US' commitment under the Paris climate agreement." #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/59yLvydLbI
Great piece: "The French are backing a green agenda; they’re just asking for this agenda to be inclusive." A policy like the Energy Innovation Act here in the U.S. would achieve that by giving a carbon dividend to people each month. #PriceOnPollution https://t.co/f7IE5GWCU3

@davddot @RepTedDeutch @RepRooney For a bit more context, this policy would reduce emissions at least 40% in 12 years, which tracks closely with the recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If we want to drastically reduce emissions, this is an effective, bipartisan way to do it.
By targeting emissions reductions of 90% by 2050, this bill is possibly the strongest climate bill ever introduced to Congress. Read our take on the bold, bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. #PriceOnPollution @RepTedDeutch @RepRooney https://t.co/G2Rtf4j5PQ
@cheesetrader1 @stratton_taylor @RepTedDeutch Hi there! This bill does not create a gov't program. It applies a fee to fossil fuels, and in response, the market will move toward cleaner, cheaper options. The dividend protects American families financially during the transition. Learn more here: https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M
The National Wildlife Federation responds to the bipartisan #PriceOnPollution bill: “Climate change is having real and dire impacts on communities across the nation. A carbon fee is an economically-sound idea worthy of Congress’s bipartisan action." @NWF https://t.co/fjbLpp7Wqh
@timreckmeyer Hey Tim! There's room for both pieces of that conversation to happen. Folks advocating for a #GreenNewDeal are envisioning a bold destination for America on climate change, and a bill that puts a #PriceOnPollution is one vehicle that can help America arrive at that destination.

Economist @noahqk explains, "The rebates received by average low- and middle-income households will exceed their increased expenditures" meaning they'll be financially better off than before: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt
@owillis @billscher Hi Oliver! The bill isn't small at all - it targets 90% emissions reductions by 2050. This evaluation by @ColumbiaUEnergy economist @noahqk shows that in fact this is the most ambitious carbon pricing plan on the table right now. Check out his analysis: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt
@SaportaReport @congressdotgov Thanks for running this piece! If folks want to learn more about the bill, they can follow the hashtag #PriceOnPollution or visit https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.

@davidhogg111 @RepTedDeutch Hey David! DM us if you'd like to talk more about Rep. Deutch's new bipartisan bill, which would help the US exceed our promises under the Paris agreements. We've got 100,000 supporters across the country and would love to count you among them as we push this proposal to passage!
@jvaughnwilson @davidhogg111 @RepTedDeutch Hi Jimmy, this bill wouldn't have any "trading" like cap and trade. It's a straightforward price on carbon pollution, so it's much easier and more transparent to execute. You can learn more about it at https://t.co/7OFiKLZW7M.
"If Congress passed the proposal next year, it would put the US on track to outdo promises the Obama admin. made as part of the Paris climate agreement." Translation: This #PriceOnPollution bill is the boldest climate policy on the table. @katemyoder https://t.co/tlfKa7IuNm

@evanstarr @timreckmeyer @MichaelEMann @politico Hi Evan! This bill does not include liability forgiveness for fossil fuel companies.
Economist @noahqk from @ColumbiaUEnergy evaluated the new Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, a bipartisan bill to put a #PriceOnPollution. One of his takeaways? The bill offers larger emissions reductions than other proposals. Read more in Kaufman's thread below: https://t.co/1iqAgxFkN6
@jeannemariemudd And as far as this approach being comprehensive, Columbia University economist @noahqk evaluated the bill and found that it's much more ambitious than other proposals of its kind and would therefore lead to greater emissions reductions. Check it out: https://t.co/mbAOhWQXjt (2/2)
@jeannemariemudd Thanks for sharing, Jeanne. CCL actually has more than 100,000 supporters working in 420+ U.S. chapters, all building political will for this solution. It's that constituent engagement that helped make this bill a reality, and now they'll be supporting it to passage. (1/2)

@4femmerald Hi Sarah! This policy only prevents additional regulations of greenhouse gas emissions, since this policy addresses those. The EPA can still regulate fossil fuels for any other pollutants like mercury, sulfur, particulates, ozone, their effect on water quality, air quality, etc.

@ThusSpokeStella @ClimateHuman Good questions! The fee begins at $15/ton and rises $10 each year. As far as regs: it prevents additional regulations on covered CO2 emissions, as long as emission targets are being met. If emission targets are not met after 10 years... (1/2)

@GlosGreen @ConnectedCathy @CCLIreland @Klimatsvaret @CitizensLobbyCa @RichardbrutonTD @MAC_europa If the price is high enough, a carbon fee will have the same effect as rationing, and CCL's proposal gets to $100 per ton within 10 years.

@whisper2world @SiegelScribe 14 lost in the general election. Others didn't run again, or their races still aren't called, so the returning number could be higher.

@erthsarah Too cute! Thanks for joining the call, Sarah!
@climateunion @MarkReynoldsCCL NRA does fear and intimidation. That's not us. LCV has a scorecard. How many Republicans came around because of that? We, on the other hand, convinced 45 Republicans to come to the table on #climatechange. We're building bridges, not driving wedges.
@robsMast @samdaleyharris The caucus was never the end game, rather a means to the end of enacting an effective price on carbon. We're likely to see bipartisan legislation introduced in the new Congress. At that point we will turn all our grassroots muscle toward moving that legislation through Congress.

"Bipartisanship is the best path forward to effective and enduring climate legislation," @MarkReynoldsCCL writes. With a D majority interested in tackling the issue &amp; Rs who are already talking solutions, Mark says, "A viable solution to the climate crisis is now within reach."
Although Republican co-chair Carlos Curbelo lost his seat in a tight race, addressing climate change is a priority for many of his returning colleagues. @MarkReynoldsCCL mentions @RepBrianFitz and @RepRooney as two examples.
Another encouraging reality: The next Congress will include "dozens of Republicans who acknowledge the existence of human-caused #climate change, and they are willing to seek the common ground on solutions." Many of these are returning members of the Climate Solutions Caucus.
Mark writes, "Come January, Democrats will control the agenda in the House, and some of them are eager to bring carbon pricing legislation to the table." He cites members like @RepTedDeutch, the co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, who is invested in bipartisan solutions.
Here's our take, from our Executive Director @MarkReynoldsCCL in @thehill: With a Democratic majority and some key Republican allies, #climate legislation in the House looks promising. https://t.co/QDiaJUtgpB

Our volunteers in @CitizensLobbyCa have tirelessly pressed their government to implement this solution. Since 2010, they've held an impressive 793 meetings with members of Parliament and generated thousands of letters to the editor and op-eds in support of the policy.
Canada's carbon fee will start at $20/ton, rising $10/ton each year until it reaches $50/ton in 2022. @JustinTrudeau emphasized that "every nickel" of the revenue will be returned back to Canadians in dividends. The policy starts in 2019.

"Some Republicans do recognize that fighting climate change could benefit the economy," writes @umairfan for @voxdotcom, citing @RepCurbelo's carbon pricing bill. (Fellow Republicans @RepBrianFitz and @RepRooney are co-sponsors.) https://t.co/a08jUh3b5W
@TabbertMark Good question, Mark! Danny will give a fuller picture of the progress at his presentation during #CCLCED, and he'll also be appearing on a Citizens' Climate University webinar soon. DM us for the details about that, if you'd like to tune in and ask him directly!
@jhannanjr Thanks Jamie! See you there!
@Callielou2002 @PatriciaMazzei We definitely agree. We need aggressive action on climate change so everyone has a fighting chance, not just those who can build a fortress!

@AndrewPJones @wgbh @350 @MothersOutFront Thanks so much for the shout out!
@NaomiOreskes Great piece! We absolutely agree the government plays a vital role--after all, Congress is the body that will have to actually implement carbon pricing on a national scale.
"Pricing carbon is a much cheaper way of hitting #climate goals than command-and-control regulations," @EnvDefenseFund president @FredKrupp says in @WSJ. https://t.co/3iUAVBuLCn

“I believe the planet’s getting warmer and the storms are getting stronger,” said the owner. That's why they reinforced their house with steel cables and rebar, bolstered it with extra concrete &amp; elevated it above potential storm surge. @PatriciaMazzei https://t.co/dKJWh6DsvR
@EfficiencyLast Thanks for all your feedback. Just sent you a DM so we can talk a little more in depth.
"To a greater extent than ever before, the best interest of many businesses and those of the planet are aligned." Nice piece from @StevenMufson @brady_dennis and @chriscmooney. https://t.co/OMfHwp7Byv
In a #climate changed world, our old hurricane rating system just isn't enough. It doesn't account for storm surge or unprecedented amounts of precipitation, both of which are making storms more deadly. @YaleE360 https://t.co/2CGS60Shbe
Climate change brings "hidden enormous multibillion-dollar costs we are already paying.” With a #PriceOnCarbon, we could start using our money to solve the problem, rather than digging ourselves into a deeper hole. @mirandacgreen https://t.co/lB3NmlZecv
@EfficiencyLast Expressing disappointment about his position isn't being judgmental or condescending--it's simply acknowledging a reality that many climate-concerned Americans feel. We stay on mission every day, all across the country, by continuing to build respectful relationships w/Congress.
This is tragic. Our thoughts are with all the communities affected by #HurricaneMichael. It's time we put a #PriceOnCarbon to stabilize our climate and work to prevent extremes like this in the future. 	@StavrosAgorakis https://t.co/KrMd6CrIky
President Trump's position is not a surprise, but it's still deeply disappointing. Congress should respond with legislation like a Carbon Fee and Dividend that drives down emissions, creates jobs, and makes the U.S. a global leader on #climate. https://t.co/ya9yZaGtR8

.@DavidJollyFL is now a political independent, which raises challenges like ballot access and a donor base, so he's not sure exactly what his next steps look like. But, he adds, "I expect to be very involved in the 2020 presidential race."
On a personal note, @DavidJollyFL shares what's next for him."I anticipate that I'll be on the ballot again, but I don't know when that will be. I've recently left the Republican party---it was the right decision at the right time."
Getting more serious, though, @DavidJollyFL suggests that the annual budget process could be a place to create compromise between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, if that's how the #MidtermElections go.
.@MarkReynoldsCCL asks @DavidJollyFL who the Republican climate leaders might be in the Senate. Jolly chuckles and says, "I'll let you know when I find one."
@CCL_CO @bouldercounty @jimhooton @DavidMKline Great news! Congrats to all the Colorado CCLers who helped raise the issue and work for this result.
@mc2maven @DavidJollyFL Thanks for tuning in, Brinda!
@channingdutton @DebbieforFL Hi Channing! CCL does not endorse candidates, and volunteers are encouraged and expected to vote for whichever candidates they feel are appropriate. As an organization, we'll continue to work with any and all members of Congress after election day and beyond.
.@DavidJollyFL praises the value of a divided government and the opportunities it can offer. On issues like #climate change, he says, "I would love to see what a leader like @RepCurbelo on the Republican side would be able to do with a Democratic majority."
"If you take a snapshot of the numbers today, the most likely scenario is the House flips," @DavidJollyFL says. He offers a caveat: "Our polling truly has not caught up with the emergence of social media."
On today's call with CCL volunteers across the country, former congressman @DavidJollyFL is sharing his take on the upcoming election and the political winds around #climate change. https://t.co/XPvGv0ResM

@jgkoomey @MichelleBirnbau @StephenLeahy @KHayhoe @RepCurbelo Duly noted. We'll keep the crow in the freezer for you. :)
@MichelleBirnbau @jgkoomey @StephenLeahy @KHayhoe @RepCurbelo Guess y'all are missing the concept of a bipartisan approach to solving climate change, which we have to do to a) pass legislation and b) make it last. To introduce a carbon tax bill when most Republicans tremble in fear about the wrath of the Kochs is no small gesture.
Our friends at @TheCLCouncil make a great case in @WIRED   for pricing carbon and giving the money back to people. #climatechange #PutAPriceOnIt   https://t.co/FMz8O7x4WA
@MichelleBirnbau @jgkoomey @StephenLeahy @KHayhoe @RepCurbelo That record includes being one of only 6 Republicans who voted against the anti-carbon tax resolution and then introducing legislation to price carbon a few days later. He does more than talk.
There will be many more storms that catch forecasters off guard if we fail to contain the warming currently under way. #HurricaneMichael  #climatechange @jswatz   https://t.co/rk2cJ44Iwv
@FxMedChiro @KHayhoe @ClimateHuman @350 @ClimateReality Couldn't agree more, and politicians who don't recognize that are looking at short careers.

@TheBradBlog @scook2214 @AlnThinks @climateguyw @billmckibben @KHayhoe @EKMeteo @MichaelEMann @bhensonweather @FraserMacLeod5 @robertscribbler @exxonmobil Politics is messy. If Exxon's support is enough to convince Republicans to get on the carbon pricing train so we can pass a bill, we'll take it.
@climateguyw @scook2214 @AlnThinks @billmckibben @KHayhoe @EKMeteo @MichaelEMann @bhensonweather @TheBradBlog @FraserMacLeod5 @robertscribbler @exxonmobil As indulgences go, a million bucks to lobby for a carbon fee might be worth a small slice of redemption. And just to be clear, CCL is not taking money from Exxon or any other fossil fuel company.
@mc2maven @GeoffreySupran @JesseJenkins @david_turnbull @Agent350 @drvox @climatecosts @mathsavage @corbett_jessica Definitely looking at what the current science calls for in terms of a carbon price. Good news is that we have the flexibility to kick it up if necessary because we're returning revenue to households.
@tialeenelson @YEARSofLIVING @OutriderFdn Thank you, Tia, and the wonderful team at @OutriderFdn for putting together a wonderful video!

@autonomeee @mattyglesias Okay, so I guess the author of the Intelligencer article knows more than Nobel Prize winner Bill Nordhaus?
Great piece from @mattyglesias:  "When the problem of #climatechange first came to be understood, it seemed like the right solution was a graduated tax on greenhouse gas emissions. And decades later, that’s still clearly the first best solution." https://t.co/26i9rEX6vr
Need help connecting the dots between #HurricaneMichael and #climatechange? @henryfountain from the @nytimes makes things pretty clear. https://t.co/YQmHmXtTJm
Tweet your thanks to these four senators for speaking up on this urgent issue! And if you're ready to get to work on the solutions we need, like a #PriceOnCarbon, find your local chapter of Citizens' Climate Lobby today: https://t.co/Zu2CivVuQx
.@ChrisVanHollen points out the opportunity costs of not acting on #climatechange. We could be investing more in energy efficiency and renewable energy. "This is actually an opportunity for us to put more Americans to work, and we're missing that opportunity."
"The costs of doing nothing are rising by the day," @ChrisVanHollen says. He references the costs of recovering from natural disasters like hurricanes, the costs farmers incur as they face droughts, and rising insurance costs for homeowners. #ClimateChangeReport
.@ChrisVanHollen says, "We've had lots of warnings about the dangers of #climate change, but this report is like a big scream. This is scientists around the world saying it's our last chance to begin to take action." #ClimateChangeReport #IPCC
.@SenatorCardin expresses his disappointment in "President Trump's failure to lead globally on this issue." He adds, "But we join our colleagues around the world to say that we're committed to meet our obligations." #ClimateChangeReport
"This is urgent," @SenatorCardin says, referencing two 1000-year floods Maryland has had recently. "This report points out just how urgent it is that we not only comply with, but accelerate, the commitments we made in Paris." #ClimateChangeReport #ParisAgreement
"We see the international community banding together to take action. Now we need leaders in Washington to follow suit," says @SenatorTomUdall. "I'm committed to meeting this fight head-on. The future of our children, our grandchildren and beyond depends on us winning this fight."
.@SenatorTomUdall says the UN's latest #ClimateChangeReport is "a call to action to the world community and to the U.S. to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we must muster the political will to do so."
If we don't take "immediate and dramatic action," @SenatorTomUdall says, we'll see devastating impacts from climate change. He points out that the Southwest U.S., where he comes from, will experience increased droughts and crop failures. "New Mexico is in the bullseye," he says.
"12 years, folks. 12 years. That's how much time Planet Earth has to slash global greenhouse gas emissions by 45%," says @SenatorTomUdall, speaking about the latest UN #ClimateChangeReport.
"It IS technologically possible to avoid these devastating impacts," @SenMarkey says, listing a #PriceOnCarbon as one of the solutions we need to address #climatechange.
"We're living through a perfect storm of inaction on climate change," @SenMarkey says, because the current administration isn't acting on this urgent problem. We need to cut carbon by 45% in the next 12 years, and 100% by 2050.
.@SenMarkey calls the #IPCC report "the most alarming report to date." He says, "We are on track for a #climate disaster, and we're going to reach it faster than anyone thought if we don't take action. This report should shatter any illusions that there is time to waste."
The latest UN #ClimateChangeReport is alarming. This morning, @SenMarkey, @SenatorTomUdall, @SenatorCardin and @ChrisVanHollen are holding a telephone press conference about it, along with guests @RheaSuh, @FredKrupp, @bruneski and others.
@GDRNorminton @NickKristof @nytimes Indeed. If media in your area is not connecting the dots, write to the editors and tell them this is negligence and that they must do better.
Spot on column from @NickKristof in the @nytimes: "At some point, those calling 'hoax' will fade away and we’ll reach a new consensus about the perils. But by then, it may be too late." #climatechange https://t.co/HmkL6VJSDz
@DrTomOkey Thanks! We'll check it out.

@kennerlyj1 @EfficiencyLast @energysmartohio @brendanpierpont @republicEn Francis Rooney is not retiring. You're thinking of Tom Rooney. https://t.co/zSjbbHam1A  Curbelo and Fitzpatrick won't be voting for ANYONE for speaker, because the Dems will take the House. They did, however, introduce legislation to price carbon.
@JBfam4 @EPA @wef Yes, it is insane. They're poisoning kids to save a few coal plants.
"...many of them have found it politically difficult to set a price high enough to spur truly deep reductions in carbon emissions." 		Give the revenue back to households, and we can set the price high enough to do the job. 		#climatechange @bradplumer  https://t.co/rjrqchpKbx
@JRobertsonEtob @DeceitinDrugs @Jackstar009 @CitizensLobbyCa Right you are! Thanks for pointing that out.
@kennerlyj1 @EfficiencyLast @energysmartohio @brendanpierpont @republicEn Unless they're taking significant action, like Curbelo, Fitzpatrick and Rooney have done, we don't refer to them as allies. Getting them to step up and become true allies is on us, their constituents, to push them to the next level.
Good to see @exxonmobil backing up their support for #carbonfee with money. Might encourage more Republicans to step up on #climatechange solutions. @StevenMufson @TheCLCouncil @AFCDividends    https://t.co/vByEPwneyh
.@stefcollett Great show on #climatechange today. What's missing to enact solutions is political will, and that's what CCL is generating through 400 chapters in the U.S. Hope you'll have us on next time the topic comes up.
@energysmartohio @EfficiencyLast Good thoughts, Nate! @JimTolbertNC is our Conservative Outreach Director---what say you, Jim? Think this phrasing could be helpful with folks on the right?
Warmer water = stronger storms		The sooner everyone connects the dots between destructive storms and #climatechange, the sooner we'll see the political will to #PriceCarbon.		 @FaithMKarimi  @CNN https://t.co/Hp5qzj7Jve
@mc2maven Yes! Returning revenue to households makes the higher price feasible, both economically and politically.
@EfficiencyLast @kennerlyj1 @energysmartohio @brendanpierpont @republicEn As a strategy for engaging with people, name-calling has a pretty poor track record.
@katboybna @ProjectDrawdown Thanks for the shoutout, Katherine!

@jb4demusa It's a start. Hopefully they'll ramp things up when there's a bill to rally behind.
@kennerlyj1 @EfficiencyLast @energysmartohio @brendanpierpont @republicEn Bottom line is we need to engage with everyone in a constructive manner. We're seeing progress, and we think we'll see the critical mass coming together in the next Congress.
@Schools4Climate @caliclimatedoc Thanks! Definitely takes persistence and patience, but it's worth it, considering what's at stake.

"Clean energy &amp; energy efficiency are good for business while also benefitting the environment," Stephanie said. "Businesses know the time is now for action on climate change. It's what their consumers want &amp; what our climate desperately needs." #CleanEnergyDCAct @DoyleSE111 https://t.co/PVz0QilIsK
The #CleanEnergyDCAct would bring D.C. to 100% clean energy by 2032, increase funding for local sustainability initiatives, create new building energy standards, and reduce transportation emissions. In light of this week's #IPCCReport, these measures are more urgent than ever.

@EfficiencyLast @chriscmooney Yes, it's more than just carbon. Our policy would place a price on CO2 and CO2 equivalents, but "carbon tax" or "carbon price" is the common shorthand.
@EfficiencyLast Thanks for the heads up! We just shared the thread.

@rwclimate We'd say pressing elected officials, respectfully and in ways we know are effective. And not only pressing them, but specifically pressing them toward a price on carbon, which the IPCC report said is "central to prompt mitigation." Here's our plan: https://t.co/9xwmIADYi9

@Jeff_Ball @ForeignAffairs Carbon pricing isn't working because the price is too low, as an OECD study last week suggested. CCL is advocating for a fee that ramps up to $100 per ton within 10 years.

@ClimatePsych Yes, mild carbon pricing won't cut it. That's why we're proposing a carbon fee that ramps up to $100 per ton of CO2 within a decade, high enough to discourage billion-dollar investments in fossil fuel infrastructure.

@keithalexander @Graham_Caswell So if some people are able to convert to low-carbon options early, that's great! But everyone will continue to receive their monthly dividend while the policy is in place, and the market will eventually generate widely available and more affordable low-carbon options.
@keithalexander @Graham_Caswell No problem! As long as the policy is in place, everyone will receive the same dividend, no matter their carbon footprint. The dividend will also rise each year as the fee rises, continuing to insulate low and middle income people from rising costs.

@keithalexander @Graham_Caswell Graham also referenced a statistic that most households would come out ahead. That's based on a Household Impact Study of this type of policy, which you can check out here: https://t.co/lJKgR28w8N Thanks for these good questions!
@keithalexander @Graham_Caswell Hi Keith! Under our proposal, people would receive the dividend monthly---no need to wait a full year. Low and middle income folks are protected from cost increases because they're immediately receiving their dividend, every single month.

Huge thanks to @RepJohnDelaney for this wonderful message! Our volunteers are revved up and ready to head to the Hill tomorrow for more than 500 meetings with Congress. Let's do it! #CCL2018
"When we're putting forth a solution to change the trajectory of #climate change, we want to look at the American people and say, 'This is a good day for EVERY American.'" @RepJohnDelaney #CCL2018
"We should come up with a #climate solution that we would be proud to announce in a coal town," he says. Solutions should be good for the environment, the economy, national security, and more. #CCL2018
Why? Because it's a huge opportunity. "In 50 years, it will be different than it is today, and it will be largely based on a carbon-free economy," @RepJohnDelaney says. #CCL2018
"#Climate change is truly one of the great threats and great opportunities of our generation," @RepJohnDelaney. When young people ask him for career advice, he tells them to go into the energy business. #CCL2018
"I not only admire you for the issue you're fighting for, but for how you're doing it," @RepJohnDelaney says. He calls our respectful, relationship-building approach the "roadmap" for healing the deep partisanship in America. #CCL2018
"You're working to find unity. That's why I admire you so much. What you're doing is exactly what every American should be doing every day, whether it's about #climatechange or something else. We're all Americans. We're so much stronger if we're unified." @RepJohnDelaney #CCL2018
"The American people are so much greater than the sum of our political parties," says @RepJohnDelaney. He praises CCLers' attitude, our spirit of bipartisanship, and our belief that country and #climate are more important than political party. #CCL2018 https://t.co/KLxmWkYVGF
.@RepJohnDelaney authored the Climate Solutions Commission Act. He has introduced multiple carbon pricing bills, including the Tax Pollution Not Profits Act in this Congress. He's also a businessman, and he brings his entrepreneurial spirit to #climate change.
Our closing keynote speaker tonight is @RepJohnDelaney. In introducing him, @JayButera says, "Few members of Congress have done more to move America toward #climate solutions than Congressman Delaney." #CCL2018 https://t.co/sOVZBslyh7

Full house for tonight's plenary at #CCL2018! Attendees are brushing up on their communication skills and getting an extra dose of strategic lobbying direction from Dr. Danny Richter, our VP of Government Affairs. https://t.co/Hl5upvg1wD
She closes with CCLer @JayButera's daily mission statement about why he acts on #climate. The last line reads, "Doing this will not be easy or comfortable, but it is definitely possible. And since it is possible, I must try. I will not give up." #CCL2018
Madeleine now walks attendees through a volunteer action plan for the next six months. She reminds us, "This organization is a team sport. What you get done in your area is magnified across the country and becomes much bigger." #CCL2018 https://t.co/v7Mx8BNUbh
After some small group discussion, Tony announces a new CCL Strategic Action Planning Team for CCLers to participate in this sort of strategic planning. If you're interested, sign up at https://t.co/x2VhyyvC79. #CCL2018
"The trick is to prepare as if both scenarios will be true," Tony explains. This is what we'll do in CCL so we're in the strongest possible situation for bill introduction, no matter what happens in the midterm elections.
Tony Sirna, CCL's Strategy Coordinator, takes the stage to explain how we can thrive and succeed despite the uncertainty of the looming midterms. The key is to do some "scenario planning." https://t.co/krI346E3e1
One success she highlights is @CCLPanamaCity's involvement with encouraging the International Maritime Organization to commit to halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. #CCL2018
Next, @ConnectedCathy takes the stage to give an update about CCL chapters around the world. https://t.co/3xFnrH19Rw
"When you do something that everyone thinks is impossible, you MAKE it possible for everyone." A state-level policy could do this for other states and, ultimately, for U.S. Congress. #PutAPriceOnIt #CCL2018
Jamie offers the story of running a mile under four minutes. For years, people thought it was impossible. But one day, someone did it. Then just a few weeks later, two more people did it. Now more than 1,000 people have run a mile in less than four minutes!
"This year, working in Utah, CCL volunteers helped to get the first-ever bipartisan carbon pricing bill introduced. There's a lot going on!" And yet, no state has actually passed a carbon fee.
"State-level policies influence Congress because companies would rather keep track of one national policy than half a dozen state policies," Jamie explains. So as state policies are implemented, there's more pressure on Congress to pass a national policy.
Next, @JamieDeMarco1 takes the stage to give an update about state-level carbon pricing efforts. https://t.co/kdUoAiUVnR
Danny suggests that we can use #climatechange not as a wedge issue, but as a bridge issue. "Maybe the way to handle an existential crisis is not to fight over it, but to recognize the humanity in others, thank them for the small steps they do take, and work together."
Back in 2014, it was impossible to imagine Republican members of the House speaking up on climate change. It used to be impossible to imagine a caucus with "climate" in the name. Look where Congress is now: 78 members on the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus!
He gives a shout out to @mattgaetz for his conservative credentials, his membership on the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus, and his regular mentions of #climatechange in interviews.
"I have found the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus to be both active and transformational," Danny says. They have quarterly meetings and regular educational briefings---far more than a typical caucus.
"We need to change the hearts and minds of the Republican base. We need to remind them that it is a conservative value to conserve," Danny says. #CCL2018 @cclconservative
It's possible that Democrats may control the House. No matter what happens, Danny says, we'll focus on bipartisanship. To pass a bill, we'd need at least 8-12 supportive Republicans in the Senate. Then, the bill would need a signature from President Trump. How do we get there?
Dr. Danny Richter takes the stage to remind us that there are only 10 working weeks left in Congress this year, and then 11 weeks of campaigning. There are also lots of Republican retirements on the way and several toss-up midterm races. https://t.co/1StvXXXRiv
Our approach has allowed us to have more and better conversations with Congress than ever before, helping make it possible for 39 Republicans to join 39 Democrats on the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus.
"Our DC staff plans to spend the next 6 months getting things in place for introduction [of a #carbon pricing bill] in January," Madeleine says. It may be sooner or may be later, but we're preparing to hit the ground running with the new Congress. #CCL2018 #PutAPriceOnIt
What's CCL's strategy in this political climate? Madeleine Para, our VP of Programs, is explaining it now from the stage at #CCL2018. (To hear her full comments, hop over to our live stream: https://t.co/DB8ane9u6v) https://t.co/PB5SDsPara

Our Executive Director Mark Reynolds is on stage, officially kicking off #CCL2018. For the first time ever, we have conference attendees from every single state. Amazing! #climate https://t.co/cJTshajwaI
Thanks to our panelists for sharing their expertise, and thanks to everyone for following along! If you'd like to see the full video of the panel discussion, head over to CCL's Facebook page: https://t.co/jGYd0ZRPNS #CCL2018
Robin adds that @SunPower has specific hiring targets for veterans returning home. "The key to me is making sure there's a market, making sure we're able to build," he says. When that happens, "We can bring in people from other industries and get them deploying solar." #CCL2018
Becca brings up the idea of a "just transition" for coal and oil workers, mentioning a clean energy bill from @SenJeffMerkley, which would help those workers transition. "We have a responsibility to give those people a platform," she says. #CCL2018
"We've seen a lot of champions [of clean energy] in Congress come up," Dylan says. He also says it's a bipartisan topic. Mr. Redford agrees, saying, "There's no reason for this to be a divisive issue." #CCL2018
When discussing the current political climate, Mr. Redford mentions @Enviro_Voter and @NCStinn's work mobilizing environmental voters. "Let's make this a short term problem," he says. #CCL2018
"We also have to look more holistically at how we're using energy, and what's the best way to green all of that consumption?" Robin Dutta adds, mentioning building retrofits, transportation and more. @SunPower #CCL2018
"The cheapest electron is the one you don't use," Dylan Reed points out. "The more we can harness energy efficiency is a huge opportunity." He adds that there are more than 2 million people working in energy efficiency--it's a huge job creator. @AEEnet
When it comes to #climatechange, Redford says he and his team wondered, "What can we do? Is there hope?" At the end of making this film, he says, "We genuinely feel that there is." @redfordcenter
In addition to Mr. Redford, tonight's panel includes Becca Ward from @Energy_Leaders, Robin Dutta from @SunPower, and Dylan Reed from @AEEnet. #CCL2018 https://t.co/XpF71dfivn

Huge thank you to @jessdiggs @staceycookusa @mrDavidWise @arielletgold and @maddie_phaneuf for speaking up at this briefing, and thanks to everyone following along with us! #OlympiansOnTheHill @ProtectWinters
He wraps up the briefing by saying to the athletes, "Thank you for representing our great country and doing it so well. We're all proud and we appreciate you."
.@SenBennetCO says we need a "durable, sustainable political coalition that is as diverse as possible, so that we can produce a result that endures." He adds, "I'm pessimistic about a lot of things in our politics right now, but I'm optimistic that we'll do the right thing here."
"Some of the biggest champions for thoughtful environmental regulation in the 1970s were Republicans," @SenBennetCO reminds the audience, mentioning Nixon, who created the EPA, and Reagan, who led the fight on the ozone hole.
"Our economy is going to depend on us getting it right on climate," @SenBennetCO says. He cites new, clean energy technology being a driver of jobs.
.@SenBennetCO says he's happy to be co-hosting this briefing with his colleague from across the aisle, @SenatorCollins. "It's critical for us to build a coalition around the consensus view of scientists that #climate change is real," he says.
After some audience Q&amp;A, @SenBennetCO is now addressing the athletes and the audience. #OlympiansOnTheHill https://t.co/hsS03ytBwR
"It's not just about saving the environment anymore," @mrdavidwise adds. "It's about saving our economy," because winter sports and outdoor recreation are responsible for many jobs and economic activity.
"We're your canaries in the coal mine," says @jessdiggs. "We see [climate change] happening all over the world, and it affects everyone at every level." #OlympiansOnTheHill
@maddie_phaneuf adds, "There's an altitude limit in biathlons. If we keep not getting snow at lower levels, our sport will be lost, or we'll have to change the altitudes, which will be harder for us to race at."
At one event Jessie remembers, local villagers literally went out and cut ice to put on the man-made course. "It should never have looked like that. I'm worried about the future of our sport. When winters warm up, our sport is going to disappear. it's heartbreaking." @jessdiggs
"We're hamstrung by the lack of snow," says @jessdiggs. "We have to train on mountains instead of cross-country, because that's the only place there's snow."#climatechange
@mrDavidWise adds, "Most of the mountains don't have half pipes anymore." After a big snow this year, he finally was able to have a half pipe in his hometown again. He said it was bittersweet, because he realized, "This is how it should be."
The Sochi Olympics were a big dream for @arielletgold, but she says it was "one of the worst events I've ever had. They were spraying blue chemicals on the half pipe to try to keep it frozen. It's unlikely that city will ever be able to host the Winter Olympics again."
.@arielletgold, who has her arm in a sling today, says, "I can attribute this injury to the conditions in Sochi. It was 50 - 60 degrees. We hadn't been able to practice because it was so warm that the half pipe would fall apart." That lack of practice led to a crash.
.@staceycookusa says, "I've been on the World Cup tour for 15 years. When we first started training in Europe, we did off-season training on the glaciers. In that time, I've seen the glaciers recede past where chair lifts go--it has disappeared beneath our feet."
"I see manmade snow everywhere we go--nobody can count on natural snow anymore," @jessdigs says. "It's a sign we really need to do something. #Climatechange is taking away a very healthy, incredibly fun, family-oriented sport that I love."
Manmade snow is "icier and more dangerous because we're not equipped. We don't have metal edges," @jessdiggs explains. One of her teammates broke his leg due to the conditions, in fact.
.@jessdiggs says, "I've been traveling around the World Cup circuit for the last 7 years. At first, I remember thinking, 'Wow, we have to race on manmade snow quite a bit.'" Since then, it's only gotten worse.
"I hope that in the future there will be more snow, but it won't happen unless we do something about it," says @maddie_phaneuf.
Maddie Phaneuf grew up skiing with "tons of snow everywhere," she remembers. "But in recent years, the majority of my races are on 100% man-made snow." She describes her courses looking like "a ribbon of white snow. You can see everywhere else is just grass." @maddie_phaneuf
"As a father who's excited about teaching my kids to ski and snowboard, it's daunting to see that change and that shift," @mrDavidWise says. "I'm fortunate to be able to speak out. [Climate change] is not distant--it's something we need to do something about right now."
#Climatechange used to seem "looming and far away," says @mrDavidWise. "But in my lifetime, I've seen winters start later and become more volatile." Because of drought years and then years of heavy precipitation, he never knows when the season will start, or if it will be good.

@JesseJenkins @KathMorrow90 @No2AGW @CCL_Aus @drvox You're right, shifting politics is necessary too! That's why our volunteers approach Congress in a respectful, appreciative way that builds relationships and moves them forward on the climate issue.

@KathMorrow90 @JesseJenkins @No2AGW @CCL_Aus We could theorize about other revenue uses, but those are often non-starters for Republicans. Ours is a plan legislators on both sides of the aisle can support, so that's what we focus on. We also like that low &amp; middle-income households come out ahead. https://t.co/lJKgR28w8N
@KathMorrow90 @JesseJenkins @No2AGW @CCL_Aus Thanks Kathryn! We, and our 90k supporters, like the fee and dividend approach because it's revenue neutral, which appeals to Republicans---and they need to be on board in order for bipartisan legislation to be introduced and passed.

@Tux_299 Under our proposal, 58% of households would receive more back from their carbon dividend than they would pay in increased prices. Those gains are concentrated in lower and middle income households. Here's the breakdown: https://t.co/lJKgR28w8N
@lovecanada2014 Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) actually evaluated a carbon fee and dividend style proposal and found major environmental and economic benefits, like 2.8 million more American jobs over 20 years. Check it out: https://t.co/hlSAMM2ctx

Hey @EPAScottPruitt, the debate is over. #Climatechange is real, humans are causing it, and it's bad. Let's debate solutions instead of the existence of the problem. @scottpwaldman https://t.co/sPd5gYcswb

@rsalm1 @cooperhefner With our plan, called Carbon Fee and Dividend, households in the bottom 60% of income would actually receive more back in the dividend than they would pay in the fee. Check it out! https://t.co/lJKgR28w8N
@RL_Miller @RepMattGaetz @RepCurbelo Even if Gaetz comes in with a different perspective, being in good-faith dialogue with other Rs &amp; Ds on the caucus is valuable. That dialogue will likely evolve many of the members' positions, as they work toward effective climate legislation both parties can support.
@climatebrad 12 Republicans (all of whom are either on the caucus or have signed the Republican Climate Resolution) spoke out against ANWR drilling on Friday. Not a bad start. https://t.co/HrcfKkWmCS
@duncan__c That's clearly not a move designed to please big donor interests. It shows responsiveness to constituent concern about climate, and there's no reason to think we won't see more and more concrete action as the Climate Solutions Caucus continues to grow.
@duncan__c Here's an example from Friday, where 12 Republicans (all of whom are either members of the Climate #SolutionsCaucus or have signed the Republican Climate Resolution) came out publicly against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. https://t.co/HrcfKkWmCS

@duncan__c Worth the work? Absolutely! To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld: You don't save the world with the Congress you wish you had; you save it with the Congress you have. Progress is happening. 2018 may have some pleasant surprises.
GREAT interview with #Climate #SolutionsCaucus co-chair Carlos @RepCurbelo on @livingonearth. Nice shoutout to CCL.  https://t.co/olYBibnyKv
@Amaieseing Senate bill included ANWR drilling to get Murkowsky's vote, which was deciding vote. Admittedly, it will be a tough sell in conference to strike ANWR drilling, but we'll see.
@Amaieseing @davereichert @RepCurbelo @RepBrianFitz @republicEn @RepLoBiondo There's been no vote yet. This was a letter to congressional leadership: https://t.co/8c8oKkCBv5

@DoctorVive @ThusSpokeStella The House and Senate tax bills now go to conference, and these Republicans want #ANWR drilling removed from the final version that must be approved by both chambers. We acknowledge and appreciate that effort. @davereichert @repcurbelo
GOP members of the #Climate #SolutionsCaucus asserted their support to protect #ANWR today. Is your rep a member of the caucus? If not, ask them to join. https://t.co/qFhn0l50Io https://t.co/PPgWwHVwdP
@DoctorVive @ThusSpokeStella FYI, Republicans on the Climate Solutions Caucus wrote a letter to leadership opposing drilling in ANWR: https://t.co/fLAsDacdCR
@DoctorVive We support the caucus, but they're a congressional body and not affiliated with CCL.
@DoctorVive If you're talking about the GOP tax bill, we're not weighing in on that. Our focus is to introduce and pass legislation that reduces GHG emissions.
Nice! Republicans on the #Climate #SolutionsCaucus support protection for the Arctic National Refuge. @davereichert @RepCurbelo @RepBrianFitz#ANWR @republicEn https://t.co/U8DaN2h8Pq
@rsalm1 @cooperhefner Yes, in fact we do. By imposing a border adjustment fee on imports from nations that do not have an equivalent price on carbon, we provide a strong incentive for nations like china to do their own carbon price. China is actually moving ahead on carbon pricing, though.
Great story on how a relationship developed between a #climate advocate and a Republican member of Congress. @RepMiaLove  @daviarivka  https://t.co/yBB4hFOiyB

@kcoplan @DoctorVive @ClimateHuman The "we" is the people of the U.S., who are represented by Congress. The culture will not change until we correct the market failure in the price of fossil fuels. A decade ago, when gas hit $4 a gallon, the Prius was flying out of showrooms.
@kcoplan @DoctorVive @ClimateHuman Politics may not drive culture, but economics certainly does. If we price carbon appropriately, investment and behavior will shift.
Let's not bank on a volcanic eruption to cool the planet. How about a #PriceOnCarbon to start reducing our emissions? #climate https://t.co/72JT1QQq7j
@fellowinameadow @cooperhefner Thanks for the shout out! Anyone interested can head to our website to learn more and find the CCL chapter closest to them. (We've got more than 450!) https://t.co/eJgIBj60Cs

@joshnaaman Keep plugging away! Encouraging that he's familiar with CCL's policy. BTW, there's currently no Climate Solutions Caucus in the Senate, just the House, but we can urge them to start a similar group.
