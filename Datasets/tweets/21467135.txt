God is up to something!  Wouldn't you like to know????
@kevingerald I LIKE THAT!
God did not create such a wonderfully, intricately made individual just to waste it on being STUPID!
Life is all about CHOICES! Make sure you make the right ones!
No matter what is going on here or around the world, it is STILL a great day to be alive!
If you are not "into" running the race we call life, then get out of the way so we won't hit you as we go by!!
Tomorrow always lets us know if we made the right choices today!
Life without hope is truly hopelessness!  Life full of hope is wonderfully GRAND!
I love life........I just wish I had more!  :)
Happiness is not just a state of mind.....it is a CHANGE of the mind!
