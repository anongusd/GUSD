@ScottAdamsSays Renewable energy is clearly the future for Humanity, and an ENORMOUS future industry. We are ceding leadership in this field to nations like China who will develop a first-to-market advantage that will be hard to overtake because we are wagering that global warming isn't real.
@ScottAdamsSays Though not a specialist in the field, but having studied the issue sufficiently to have an informed layman's opinion, I believe there is a better-than-80% chance the majority of climate scientists are correct about the *major features* of global warming. I answer PW accordingly.
@ScottAdamsSays In my resolution of the Pascal's Wager, even if the climate scientists are WRONG &amp; we behave as if they are RIGHT, we will derive great benefits, though not in the most cost-effective way; if they are RIGHT &amp; we behave as if they are WRONG, the consequences are dire for all of us
@ScottAdamsSays As for global warming, I've found that the best way to discuss it is to imagine a "Pascal's Wager" for the issue, with various percentages: what if there's an 80% chance, a 50% chance, or a 20% chance the great majority of climate scientists are right. Then, answer the questions. https://t.co/BKEuPrIeqv
