This means that the Jayapal plan would not just make changes to how Americans get insurance. But it would also make changes in health care delivery. https://t.co/XCazJQpiyG
The plan would, for example, require hospitals to apply for special funding from Medicare if it wanted to make capital improvements. Currently, hospitals can just buy equipment or renovate when they have the money. https://t.co/XCazJQpiyG
Global budget payments are popular in some other countries. They have been part of a pretty successful policy experiment in Maryland. It‚Äôs a wonky idea, informed by serious experts. But it would also be a big change. https://t.co/XCazJQpiyG

I look forward to seeing more research on how/whether the ACA has affected medical bankruptcies. One glass-half-full interpretation is that they may have already been rare. https://t.co/sLqwMWFrsS https://t.co/43jYGzEg5Q

Several economists who study medical debt think this research is measuring the causes of bankruptcy the wrong way. If you agree with them, maybe you should take these findings less seriously. https://t.co/sLqwMWFrsS https://t.co/7qFs27A7M6
There is quite a lot of scholarly evidence from credit reports that the Obamacare Medicaid expansion has reduced financial strain and debt in low income households. But bankruptcy is more often a tool of the middle class.
President Obama often talked about reducing medical bankruptcies as one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/sLqwMWFrsS https://t.co/L5vPrwgg4O
Reminder: This research design is somewhat controversial, but the earlier work from this team, which once included Sen. Warren, has been very influential in policy circles. https://t.co/sLqwMWFrsS

@libbycwatson It's going to be really interesting to see this debate develop with more nuance and subtlety now that it's really entering the mainstream of Democratic politics. I'm very curious about how/if public opinion changes as that happens.
@CharlieWiseCPA I tweeted about the views of single-payer advocates that it won't be so hard to get people to abandon private coverage. It's a very open and interesting question. I shared a column describing support for private coverage. Thought seeing another perspective would be informative.
@libbycwatson It depends a bit on how you view the employer-side payroll tax. But I understand your point. Pro-single-payer politicians will still need to convince the median income public that a tradeoff between more taxes and less premiums/cost sharing is worth it.
@KevinWatchingTV @libbycwatson I suspect that is the argument that advocates will be making in response to this concern. There is still a persuasive challenge.

@zolsavicky Tweets are short. I was focusing on the political challenges--the big counterarguments that worry those inclined to support the idea in concept. Of course any full conversation of this policy idea will be longer and more complex than a tweet.

There's a long history of states tinkering with Medicaid rule to raise or lower signups. Obamacare was supposed to eliminate some of the old tricks. But the Trump admin may not be policing states closely. https://t.co/ZgasXAjiEU https://t.co/iX1PwTTsd9
A final note, with thanks to @FishmanEliot, who noticed this first: A lot of Medicaid enrollment reductions came in states that I have not been watching closely. Neither TX nor TN have expanded, and neither have imposed work requirements. But small changes can dent enrollment
But I'm personally going to hold off on making too much of the size estimate of the changes until we know more about how the new Gallup survey holds up and matches up with the old Gallup survey.
A rising uninsured rate is also consistent with some outside administrative data. It looks like exchange enrollment and Medicaid enrollment both dropped in 2018. https://t.co/gEHRqIHs7X
Nevertheless, even if you just compare the quarters with the new methodology, it does look like the uninsured rate is on the rise, and that's a trend that matters. https://t.co/gEHRqIHs7X
Gallup says they have adjusted to account for the differences. But a few people I talked to said it probably doesn't make sense to view this as one continuous data set any more, at least until there is more corroboration from other surveys.
If you quickly glance at its chart, it may not be obvious that the 2018 data were collected differently from the previous years. https://t.co/V0TO2aJxGy

3) The current situation is pretty weird, and definitely not what Congress intended when it wrote ACA. But it is making plans more affordable for subsidized customers. Examples below from last year, but the pattern holds. https://t.co/i4q18gGfcJ
2) Changing the rule for the 2021 plan year would result in lots of disruption right before the 2020 election. Does not seem like ideal timing to make such a change, though it could have the effect of depressing benchmark premiums.
A few additional thoughts: 1) It remains unclear to me what sort of Congressional appetite there is for restoring CSR payments. There are reasons for members of both parties to theoretically support it, but also oppose it. I haven't heard from either side looking to lead.

This program raises a bunch of really interesting questions. Unintended pregnancies were nearly half of all pregnancies in 2011. What would it mean to knock that number way down?  https://t.co/GDdmn2qPVe
When it came to same-day access, operations improvements were harder than training clinicians to insert LARCs.  https://t.co/GDdmn2qPVe https://t.co/KMaKAawuXg
The program has two main goals: 1) Always ask women if the want to get pregnant. 2) Be able to give them any form of contraception on the spot. Turns out even #1 was tough at first.  https://t.co/GDdmn2qPVe https://t.co/lVfpHTxuDj
There have been several successful pilot programs that have shown that improved contraceptive access can reduce abortions and improve some health indicators in targeted populations. But the DE experiment is for all women there. https://t.co/GDdmn2qPVe

"Slowth" stands for slow growth. Health spending went up last year, but by a lot less than health spending has grown historically--and by less than the overall economy grew. This is good news.

@BrianLWilcox Yes. My kingdom for an edit button!
I look forward to hearing from experts on innovation incentive effects.
Also wonder what affects this could have on Pharma negotiations with foreign governments that make up the reference price. Would other countries get fewer drugs early so the companies can charge higher prices in the U.S.? Would they end up paying more?
I wonder, in particular, if it might cause companies to shift further away from small molecules and towards biologics, where there would be smaller threats from generic competition.
It seems clear that this is an approach that could have substantial effects on industry investments and innovation. IP protections are pretty central to their business model.
It shares some features with the Trump administration's recently announced Part B pricing demo: It would outsource price negotiation to other countries, rather than having the U.S. government do it itself.
The advantage of an approach like this over the traditional Medicare "negotiation" ideas is that this would affect prices for all payers in the U.S., not just the federal government.
.@SarahKarlin has a nice story on the details. It would basically allow the US to yank IP protections on drugs that exceed international reference prices. https://t.co/cOu22io7y9

One last thought: Being on health care defense is not necessarily bad, politically. It worked this time for Democrats. And it helped the Republicans the last few cycles.
Another place to watch is Montana, where an initiative to fund ongoing Medicaid expansion through a tobacco tax went down. The issue now returns to the legislature, which could scrap expansion or find another funding source. https://t.co/2xdEmY4JOF
Dems had some gains in state legislatures, too. New York might be a state to watch, now that Democrats have full control. Read @AlanGreenblatt with the rundown of which legislatures flipped. https://t.co/6rkdBNY99X
Democrats also won governor's races in several non-expansion states: Kansas, Maine*, Wisconsin. Those states could expand.		*Maine is weird, since the state's voters already approved a ballot initiative. But the new governor will make it more likely to actually happen.
.@abbygoodnough had a good story on last night's Medicaid ballot initiatives. Medicaid expansions in several states will be a real policy change coming out of this election. https://t.co/vLZ3q1rfc9
That's at the congressional level, obviously. In the states, the wins could be much more significant.
The biggest effects of Democratic control of the House is the things that probably won't happen in the next to years: There probably won't be another run at repeal and replace. There probably won't be Medicaid block grants. We probably won't be privatizing Medicare.
A lot of the Dems' health care message was defensive: We'll protect consumer protections that are already part of the ACA. Having control of the House will be enough to do that.
Some small health care election thoughts: 		Democrats ran on health care. It didn‚Äôt work out for everyone (McCaskill). But Pelosi‚Äôs ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hear it for pre-existing medical conditions‚Äù suggests this will continue to be a theme for the party.

If you want this advice summarized by me in audio form, listen to #wthealth this week: https://t.co/RlJbfNzh3L
There are more choices in several parts of the country this year. This is good for choice, and probably for overall premiums, but it could affect how much your subsidy will buy. Again, you should shop before just renewing.
The good news about this year is that, in most parts of the country, premiums aren't going up. But because health insurance is always more complicated than we want it to be, that does not mean that the cost for your particular insurance isn't increasing.
If you already buy your own insurance and love what you have: You really, really, really should shop around anyway.
In general, don't buy a plan that you found out about using an unsolicited email or phone call.
Also: Look out for fraudulent plans. There is some stuff being marketed out there that is not even short-term insurance. Make sure the coverage is from a brand you know, or check with your state insurance department to confirm it is legit.
If a short-term plan is all you can afford, you should shop really carefully. Read all the fine print. And consider discussing it with someone who has expertise. More details here: https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg
Downside 2: Short-term plans tend to cover fewer benefits. They often don't cover maternity care, or mental health care, for example. And they often have other weird exclusions, like treatment for sports injuries. You can't always know in advance what your health needs will be.
Downside 1: If you have a pre-existing health condition, you may not be able to buy a short-term plan. The insurers don't have to sell to sick people, or may charge them more, or may choose to just not cover certain health problems you already have.
The advantage of short-term insurance is that it may be a lot cheaper than an ACA-compliant plan. But there are reasons why! And they are related to the downsides of this type of insurance.
This year, there's another option to consider if you don't qualify for a subsidy "short-term" health insurance. Under new Trump administration rules, this kind of insurance isn't really very short-term any more.
A broker can help you look at those off-exchange plans. Or, if you know the carriers in your state, you can contact them directly.
There may be deals on silver plans off the exchange. (Similar complicated reasons as above.)
If you earn too much to get a subsidy, you have a harder shopping task. Start by looking at plans on the marketplace, but you should also look at Obamacare-compliant plans sold directly by insurance companies.
Bronze plans can have very high deductibles. So even though free may be a very enticing price, make sure you're comfortable with the kind of financial exposure you'd have if you get sick.
(Yes, this is weird. It is the consequence of Trump administration policies last year that had the effect of increasing prices of silver plans, but not other metals. Upside: Your subsidy will go further.)
If you earn a bit more, but still qualify for subsidies--less than around $48k for a single person--stay in the marketplace, but also look at bronze and gold plans. A gold plan has a lower deductible and may cost less than silver. Bronze may be free.
If you don't qualify for Medicaid but earn less than double the poverty level--about $24k for a single person--you should go to your state marketplace and look at silver plans. The cheapest one that covers the doctors you care about is almost always your best option.
If you earn less than 133% of the federal poverty level--or about $16k for a single person--you can qualify for Medicaid coverage in most states (though not all). Good news about Medicaid is it typically charges no or low premiums and you can buy it any time.
The right shopping strategy depends a little bit on your income. So here come a couple of buckets of advice for different people.
Don't procrastinate! Even with good advice, shopping for health insurance is very hard. And the enrollment period only lasts six weeks in most states. At least look at your options on https://t.co/dhlLq11UsV as soon as possible.
It‚Äôs time to shop for Obamacare plans for 2019. I didn‚Äôt write a shopping guide this year, but I wanted to share a few suggestions for people who are looking for coverage.

Wisconsin has tried premiums before. Research showed they depressed enrollment. https://t.co/iGhYqyTrCj https://t.co/8YB3UgPFLm
The waiver also will allow the state to charge premiums to some Medicaid beneficiaries and lock out those who fail to pay. https://t.co/J4BxoluGxb
But it is a lot more forgiving than some of the other plans. In Arkansas, beneficiaries lose coverage for the year if they miss work targets in three months. https://t.co/L0SM29WI6b
The Wisconsin work requirement is notable because it is a state that did not expand Medicaid under Obamacare, making it the first of its kind to be approved.

I look forward to reading and retweeting thoughts from people more expert on the tax/erisa spaces, who may have insights I don't on this first read of this weedsy document.
But: It will give some workers and firms more choices, and maybe better ones. It's an interesting rule for sure.
It's also worth considering in light of other changes to Obamacare the administration is pursuing, including new guidance on state waivers yesterday. Those individual markets have other forces that are making them sicker and more expensive already.
There are likely to be effects on that market for the people who are already there, too. If the pool gets sicker, prices will go up. The Trump admin doesn't think this increase will be big.
As the regulators note, it would likely be particularly attractive to firms with sick workers, meaning people with pre-existing conditions would be more likely to end up dumped out of the employer market and into the individual market.
But this change is also coming in the context of Obamacare's individual markets, which Republicans love to assail. It would push people out of the employer market into one that many Republican politicians think is too expensive and has too few choices. https://t.co/WIyjVBfpnh
This proposal can be seen as a part of that ideological tradition. This change would allow employers and workers to choose whether they'd rather have a group health plan or use their pre-tax dollars to go buy something they like in the individual market.
We've also seen this idea more recently. Kevin Brady likes to talk about the health care "backpack," insurance that is personal and portable. There was talk of tax changes that would put more people in the individual market in AHCA--though they got axed. https://t.co/W7ho72vTTX
A bunch of Republicans campaigned on similar ideas in the 2016 primaries. Here's a piece I wrote at the time: https://t.co/lS9VnQKGNx
There was a tiny gesture towards this idea in Obamacare. The Cadillac tax was designed to reduce incentives for employers to offer super-deluxe coverage. It has not been popular with normal people and has not gone into effect.
We saw this idea in John McCain's platform: He wanted to weaken incentives for employers to provide insurance, and just give individuals tax preferences to buy their own coverage instead.
Ok big picture: For a long time, many Republicans have thought that the employer market is weird and inefficient, and that more people should be able to buy their own insurance, according to their preferences. (Many economists also like this idea.)
It is sad that CBO doesn't score regulatory proposals. It would be interesting to see whether a neutral party agrees with these numbers. @urbaninstitute @Chrissyeibner, I await your analyses!
Helpful summary table of estimated effects here: https://t.co/bGmPDjTeGs
Regulators expect that firms with sicker workers would be more likely to offer this option, since making individual insurance affordable will be cheaper for them than buying employer insurance. But they don't expect it will make a big difference for overall premiums. https://t.co/KCJ8zAe0fv
Here's the estimated impact. 6.8M fewer people would have traditional employer insurance in a decade, as they move into the individual market. https://t.co/JYfiWPIPaS

Employees who want to use an HRA to buy individual market coverage will get a special enrollment period to do so, in case the employer benefits change when it's not Obamacare open enrollment. https://t.co/RrwMLe9wlk
Sorry. Slight correction from previous (deleted) tweet: To comply with the employer mandate, the HSA must be big enough to make the lowest-cost silver plan on the Obamacare market affordable for the workers. https://t.co/Xq43wnd4aU
Regulators seem skeptical that short-term plans would be a kosher thing to buy with an HRA. But they are asking for comments on the idea, so they have not ruled it out. https://t.co/qsgPEnHKKW
Under this proposal, you could use your HRA to buy an individual insurance plan. (There is a long discussion of grandfathered plans, but I wouldn't worry about them too much. As regulators note, they will come up infrequently.) https://t.co/FXUqQL5G6s
@christapeterso @onceuponA @Cutler_econ I think you, as graduate student, know where you are an expert and where you are still learning. To the degree you are an expert in something‚Äîhave professional experience, or have published research, or some other bona fide‚Äîjournalists can benefit from that knowledge.
This description of the methods Obamacare uses to make the marketplace risk pools healthy is a strange read in light of yesterday's 1332 guidance. States can now get rid of a lot of these rules. And the individual mandate penalty was eliminated by Congress last year. https://t.co/I8a1azFTYv
(Side note: I am not sure how these protections would prevent employers with an overall sicker pool of workers from trying to dump them ALL onto the exchange.)
Here are the ways they would prevent employers from dumping their sicker workers onto the exchange. Insurance experts, do tell how well you think they would work. https://t.co/VKEIMnDxGo
The proposed rule acknowledges that these changes will probably encourage employers to push sicker workers onto the individual market. If this happens, it will drive up premiums for everyone who buys their own insurance. (Will tweet mitigation strategies when I get there.) https://t.co/5iFxO3OMGd
Philosophical statement: https://t.co/ESMcUXEuvs
The Obama administration also thought that giving money to employees to buy health insurance violated HIPAA. https://t.co/CectxhkKl8
As with yesterday's reg, one thing that jumps out is how much of the current guidance was issued by the Obama administration in sub-regulatory form. Lots of references to FAQs, for example. (I think this is more common in tax land, but still.)
This is interesting. One why HSAs have not historically counted as insurance under ACA is because the violate the annual and lifetime limits rules. (If you're using the fund as insurance, once the HSA is spent, you've effectively hit the limit.) https://t.co/hGhv5IRSvq

@PoliticalPup415 The answer depends on the fine print of the state‚Äôs ACA implementing legislation. We need a NC health policy expert to tell us!
I do think it potentially hands some GOP candidates a talking point about non-Obamacare ways to protect this population. But 1332 IS part of Obamacare,
I am super curious about why CMS chose to make this announcement now, right before the election, when pre-existing conditions protections are such a hot issue.
@bjdickmayhew @CitizenCohn @MattAFiedler Hey @tonyleys, remind us of your best story explaining the proposal, so we can circulate.
RT @bjdickmayhew: @MattAFiedler Iowa's stop gap measure looks approvable under this guidance
@onceuponA Depends on what states do with the overall subsidy structure, right?
@sam_baker @ropear Waiting with bated breath!
@greg_fann Under 1332, states could rearrange the subsidies any way they want.
The new guidance goes into effect right away, but any new system wouldn't be up and running before 2020.
Rare mispronunciation of @ropear's name on the 1332 conference call.
Verma confirms that states could be permitted to use federal subsidy dollars to help people buy short-term health plans under a 1332 waiver.
CMS is going to put out a "series of waiver concepts," to give states a sense of the kinds of plans they might approve. Should be really interesting to see what these models look like.
Verma really emphasizing that this will not hurt people with preexisting conditions. But, in the analysis of the Cruz plan, a lot of smart health economists thought the splitting of the market could raise prices for such people. https://t.co/btIMizsxrK https://t.co/CS7xVGs8J7

(The Iowa proposal comes to mind: https://t.co/IKLHAH1BNM)
On a press call, Seems Verma says she‚Äôs received ‚Äúnumerous state requests‚Äù for a more liberal 1332 process.
The Trump administration has been enthusiastic about these waivers from the outset, and has approved several this year, in both red and blue states, to enact reinsurance programs.
There are strong echoes of elements of last year's GOP health care legislation.
And it's doing so in a way that's designed to make it easier for states to get these plans approved, and easier for states to pursue plans that include coverage that is skimpier than would be allowed under Obamacare's normal rules.
Ok, a less nerdy step back: The Trump administration is overhauling a program that allows states to toss out nearly all the Obamacare rules to refashion its health insurance system for middle- and high-income Americans who buy their own insurance.
This is a good reminder that, as written, 1332 doesn't really allow changes to state Medicaid programs. Coordinating two sets of waivers will remain clunky. The Alexander/Murray stabilization bill that died on the Hill would have helped coordinate these programs. https://t.co/4gYSCgowho
Interesting. https://t.co/FKjaESoJ24 is apparently now functional and flexible enough that it could work with varying state rules and program. What a long way that website has come. https://t.co/SJhEvoTZ3o
Here's how CMS is asking states to justify their estimates of coverage and cost under waiver proposals. https://t.co/CSHGJnh0ST
Nevertheless, the administration plans to count enrollment in short-term health plans as "coverage" for the purposes of the waiver calculation. Some details on what short-term plans do and don't cover here: https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/uLllYfZgvf
The administration is going to measure affordability broadly, to include out-of-pocket spending as well as insurance premiums. I wonder how states will measure that if they are offering options with fewer benefits than under ACA rules. https://t.co/vB9nfMw13C
The guidance seems to eliminate the current requirement that states must pass legislation to enact innovation waivers. Now, it appears, an executive order or regulation will be enough in most states. This mirrors the approach in last year's Obamacare repeal/replace bills. https://t.co/dmL8QQU3xm
But if you think the exchange market is, effectively, a high risk-pool, as some in the administration do, this approach dovetails with other changes they have made. https://t.co/f9JMffREbr https://t.co/tJVNd6Z9Hk
Sort of sounds a lot like the Cruz amendment from last year. https://t.co/btIMizsxrK
The standard seems to be that, as long as ACA-compliant coverage is available for those who want it, states can encourage less comprehensive coverage options alongside it. https://t.co/D83VxmiDwK
This is wonky, but is actually a big change. The current rule is that coverage needs to be at least as comprehensive as it would be under Obamacare rules. The Trump admin is now saying that insuring more people matters more than insurance quality. https://t.co/5RGWfxxB29
This is also new. 1332 nerds: Is this related to *anything* in the legislative text? https://t.co/qgefyZkRyZ
This looks to be a slightly new goal. ACA says only that the plans shouldn't increase federal spending. https://t.co/nxTrUJUr4O
The new guidance prioritizes private over public insurance. This could make it harder for states to get waivers for, say, a single-payer system, one of the original purposes of the program. Also, could make Medicaid buy-in hard. https://t.co/GRpAZFainc

@MaxNisen That's true. There would presumably be some tradeoffs in choosing a different path. Hard to know without a real proposal.
Republicans are in a difficult spot on this issue. Many of their voters still want them to repeal Obamacare--and they've been vowing to do so for years. But voters are also worried about pre-existing conditions protections. It will be hard to keep both promises.
Trump's tweet, and similar statements from prominent GOP candidates in the last week show that the issue has some political poignancy. Here's my piece on why Democrats are running on the issue: https://t.co/EwzdLOOcNO
There are possible ways to protect people with prior illnesses other than Obamacare, but Trump has not proposed or endorsed a specific policy to do this.
At political rallies, Trump continues to complain that Obamacare was not overturned by Congress.
Trump's Justice Department is also currently arguing in court that Obamacare's pre-existing conditions protections should be thrown out as unconstitutional. https://t.co/KcUZVENjMH
Trump has *said* he supports pre-existing conditions protections for a long time. But he also supported the GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare last year, all of which would have undermined current protections. He pressured lawmakers to vote for the bills.
It is hard to know what is in people‚Äôs hearts. But most Congressional Republicans voted for bills last year that would substantially weaken current protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/gOG7sdEncv

@greg_fann I mean over the history of the market. It seemed like the ship was coming right, and then last year was confusing again.
@greg_fann also argues that the elimination of CSRs last year may have been stabilizing, by lowering subsidized premiums. I would love to read a detailed analysis of how much last year's CSR action helped vs. hurt. premiums.https://t.co/pJDzfVUBuA

RT @CF_Pearson: Gray haired health plan actuaries everywhere roll eyes and think, "understatement of the decade."	 https://t.co/UTk4QFqKi0
But Trump administration actions made the market less stable and predictable, leading to a second spike last year. Here's a list of relevant policies: https://t.co/cD55ZuVQ8F @haeyoun
Financial results from 2017 suggested the price spike could have mostly been a one-time correction. The financial performance of marketplace plans improved a lot.
In 2017, when premiums spiked for the first time, it was largely because insurers had priced way too low in the early years, and many lost a lot of money. https://t.co/6LZTu5oToE https://t.co/SuvWxfEudN
If I may return to a broader theme. One of the things we're learning is that getting the pricing right for this market is really hard, especially in an unstable policy environment.
@marshall_allen I think it‚Äôs good politics. And also probably easier to push out this one analysis alone and takes more time to do the big file with everything.
@marshall_allen They haven‚Äôt published those yet. They‚Äôll be released with the ‚Äúlandscape file‚Äù in a few weeks. Might be gettable in a few states. @khemp64 would know what‚Äôs out there now.
@ariellelb It is going to be so individual-specific. Subsidized premiums are about the difference between benchmark and *their* price. As always, it pays to shop.
The Trump admin wants to take credit for stabilizing the market. The truth is more complex. They did things last year that made the markets much worse, and we're still feeling that pain. But reinsurance--which they embraced--is helping. https://t.co/nQNTTXUMdL
.@HeatherHHoward and her team have been doing great work tracking all the states that are doing reinsurance. https://t.co/BEcoQjk1jI https://t.co/65m5yMrVoI
Reinsurance is nerdy, but it basically means the federal government is helping to pay for the most expensive customers, holding down prices for everyone else. The Trump administration has welcomed reinsurance programs, and several states have pursued them.
A bunch of states have also taken local actions to try to hold down premiums.  New Jersey is a good example: It passed its own individual mandate, regulates short-term plans, and pursued a reinsurance program (more on that later.) Premiums there are going down by 14.7% https://t.co/PXacTfn0Gl
That means that, probably, premiums ARE still higher than they would be without the mandate repeal. We just took the penalty hit a year early, and things are holding steady this year.
But a lot of plans panicked last year, thinking the Trump administration would just stop enforcing the mandate. That means they built in protection they didn't need in 2018. Here are a few examples from a 2017 @KaiserFamFound report: https://t.co/UsJUMWC3zs https://t.co/wtd22PsoG5
You might think that in 2019, with the individual mandate gone, premiums would go UP. That's what CBO told us would happen.
Ok. Why are premiums going down? It's an interesting question, with a few answers.
We're a few weeks from open enrollment still, and there's more data yet to come, but if you're shopping for a plan for yourself, this advice still holds pretty well. https://t.co/i4q18gGfcJ https://t.co/ebyAnVQ2Et
(More on last year's weirdness here: https://t.co/v86vTHm6IT)
The "benchmark plan" was weird and distorted last year, because of policy changes pursued by the Trump administration, but now that we're back to a stable policy environment, it's a pretty good barometer for what's happening to prices.
These data are just for the federal marketplace states. So it is not the entire country. But it's a lot of states, and the national picture has tended to track the federal marketplace states pretty well in past years. https://t.co/a4bPtN7h28
Average Obamacare premiums for the ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù plan, a good measure of the market, are going DOWN by 1.5% for next. year. (Caveats and details to follow.) https://t.co/a4bPtN7h28

@claire_mcandrew (Also, maybe, quit your recreational soccer league.)
If a short-term plan is your only affordable option, here‚Äôs some advice from @claire_mcandrew. You really really really need to read the fine print. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/BMIGcztCN4
But, as Trump administration officials have emphasized, because they cover less and don‚Äôt cover sick people, the short-term plans can be quite a lot cheaper than Obamacare plans. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/hJ7aEKjCbZ
If you‚Äôre using a broker to buy coverage, make sure it‚Äôs someone you trust. Insurers tend to pay higher commissions on short-term policies than comprehensive plans. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/DwPSx38rhd
If you have a pre-existing health condition, you may not be able to buy short-term coverage at all. Or you may have to pay more. Or your condition may not be covered‚Äîeven if it was not previously diagnosed. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg
They tend to have limits on how much they will cover, overall. And they also have limits on how much they will cover for certain types of care. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/NEZzA0tL54
There are also smaller things that are rarely covered. Check the fine print. Here are some examples: https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/6dCHB0J9H0

The history of Medicaid shows that, the harder you make it to get or keep benefits, the fewer people have insurance. https://t.co/ZgasXAjiEU
Medicaid work requirements are being approved as demonstration projects, to show that the requirements can improve health and reduce poverty. The first one, in Arkansas, has cost 4,300 people their insurance so far. https://t.co/Df3kTuDhWR
@emma_sandoe No! It is!
Anyway: There are our first live results of a Medicaid work requirement in the wild. 4,300 people have already lost their benefits for the year. https://t.co/Df3kTuDhWR
I strongly encourage you to check out the Arkansas website Medicaid beneficiaries must use to log their work hours. https://t.co/V9WRQBpyMi
Also, we know that low-income people tend to have fluctuating incomes. That means that people with lower income at signup now have to meet a higher standard to keep their benefits. Here's @CenterOnBudget with some numbers. https://t.co/luQe18yLfm https://t.co/yppCCZCd4b
That's a generous exemption policy that pushed down the number of people who lost coverage in Arkansas. Other states might not take such an expansive approach to automatic exemptions.
About those 40k people who didn‚Äôt have to report: The state assumed people with high enough incomes at the time they enrolled in Medicaid were continuing to work 80+ hours/month. https://t.co/Df3kTuDhWR https://t.co/TY3oeSvHWU

The historic approach in the U.S., as @stavernise wrote a few years ago, was to be extremely wary of e-cigs. But many public health experts said that strategy could prevent current smokers from quitting. https://t.co/nK3jC0G529 https://t.co/FWVII0kVbl
Gottlieb's on-ramp/off-ramp language describes a real tradeoff. FDA wants to reduce adult smoking *and* prevent teen nicotine use. He is asking industry to make products that are appealing to adult smokers and unappealing to kids.

@onceuponA When you have a free moment, please send me the best papers on this topic. Have been wanting to reacquaint myself with evidence on this point.
This policy also highlights a weirdness of Medicare's drug coverage system. Some drugs get covered under Part D, with one payment scheme. Others, under Part B, with a totally different payment system. This change seeks to bring them closer together.
I get a lot of emails from readers complaining about step therapies and other sorts of administrative coverage hurdles.
This policy is a good reminder that "negotiation" over drug prices doesn't necessarily mean patients get every drug, but cheaper. To negotiate effectively, buyers have to be able to say no. That would be true for more conventional Medicare negotiation too. https://t.co/CeQDH51sSM
Read @annaedney for some examples of how this could work. She scored an interview with Alex Azar. https://t.co/jxxYEh2E8R (Sorry about the ad.) https://t.co/68nKiJFTZo
A lot of private insurance plans use similar strategies. "It's unique that Medicare Advantage has not done it," @SeemaCMS said. The change would only affect private Medicare Advantage plans, not traditional Medicare.
Potential upsides include lower costs for beneficiaries, in cost-sharing, and ultimately, in premiums. Potential downsides are more hassle and bureaucracy to get the drug your doctor thinks is best for you.
If it sounds confusing, it is! But the goal is to give private plans more tools to negotiate for low drug prices, especially in cases where there are pharmacy and doctor options.
CMS will allow private Medicare plans to force patients to try cheaper drugs before taking more expensive physician-administered ones. The goal is to get drugmakers to offer deals in order to be the first on the list. https://t.co/0NVXuC5wge

Read @ropear on how the new short-term limited duration insurance ‚Äústretches the common understanding of those terms.‚Äù https://t.co/7UB6ySP7ra
One helpful way to think about short-term plans is that they are likely to be very similar to the individual insurance sold before Obamacare. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/fvoNhuByQs
@Neoavatara Short-Term plans are likely to be profitable for the carriers that offer them. Typical MLRs are very different than for major medical insurance. And 36 months of policy means more total premium $s. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/tbOKUtBlwr
Still, if you can't afford an Obamacare plan, they are a lot cheaper. The Trump administration's view is that skinnier insurance is better than none at all for people priced out of the Obamacare markets. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg
And if you have a pre-existing health condition, you may not be able to buy a short-term plan at all. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg
There may be weird things, like waiting periods for certain types of care. https://t.co/Tvho0LIyTg https://t.co/eKmwjBic1N
