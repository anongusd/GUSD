@MTercsak @romans15p @elcorintio @RepMarkMeadows @michellemalkin There were two theives. One askef Jesus to remember him when Jesus enters paradise. Today Jesus said you will be with me in paradise. So yes if you are a horrible person or a good person you can be saved on your death bed. But please do not wait you may not get a chance to ask
@MTercsak @romans15p @elcorintio @RepMarkMeadows @michellemalkin Yes if you are a horrible person, you are on your death bed if you call on Jesus to save you, ask forgiveness He will take you home with Him.  Did you ever read in the Bible where Jesus was cruficed? Continie on next one
