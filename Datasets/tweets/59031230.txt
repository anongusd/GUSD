The problem is that he "Never Can Say Goodbye." https://t.co/ey4tJzt1mB
Northam presser was a real "Thriller," but in a "Bad" way. No, in 1984 it was not "Human Nature" to wear blackface. He needs to start with the "Man in the Mirror," and -- you know what's coming -- "Beat It."
"I used just a little bit of shoe polish to put on my cheeks" to impersonate Michael Jackson? Just stop, Governor. Stop talking and resign while you have a shred of dignity left.
Northam suggests it was normal for white Virginians in 1984 -- I said 1984 -- to pose in blackface and Klan robes. He admits he wore blackface on another occasion. This is pathetic. He needs to go.
Northam's defense quotes Shaggy -- "It wasn't me" -- but that doesn't make it any better. Then why choose that picture for his yearbook page? It was 1984 (not 1884) and he was a grown man. He needs to resign.

One of the many things I'd ask @MichaelCohen212 if I were a prosecutor in the SDNY is whether he knew about any Trump Org transactions, maybe with Russians, that looked or smelled like money laundering.
So @MichaelCohen212 paid @StormyDaniels 130K and got reimbursed $420K from the Trump Org? I've never heard of a payment being "grossed up" that much. Anyone else wondering if other off-the-books services maybe were involved?

Now, finally, will everyone admit how great LeBron James is?

The T-Paw vs. Bachmann cage match is definitely the main event tonight. Plus Newt pounding the table.

Turns out that Minnesota Nice isn't very nice at all...
Watching GOP debate; fantastic smackdown between Bachmann and T-Paw. Every time Bachmann scores, White House must smile.

Gibbs declines more "specificity" on further U.S. msgs to Mubarak about #Egypt transition. Pharaoh clearly not hearing.
Gibbs says Obama delivered blunt msg to Mubarak that "time for change has come." Today we see Mubarak's response.
In W House briefing, Gibbs reiterates that reform process in #Egypt "must begin now." But how?
As of 8 am EST, top WHouse officials were unaware that events in #Egypt would turn so violent - like everyone else.
Attack by pro-Mubarak thugs shows how limited US or other outside influence is. Pharaoh may be delusional.
How #Egypt crisis reverbs in rest of Arab world has potential f/ geopolitical shift big as fall of Berlin Wall.
Sounded to me as if Obama pressing for new transitional govt in #Egypt much sooner than Sept. "Now" ≠ 9 mos. from now.
WHouse biggest problem is how to cut loose Mubarak w/out giving conniptions to Saudis, Jordanians, UAE sheikhs, etc.
Obama says "orderly transition... must begin now" in #Egypt. A diplo-speak shove: "now" contradicts Mubarak timetable.
Awaiting President Obama's words on #Egypt. After Mubarak's defiance, window for WHouse influence may be closing.
Tomorrow's column urges W. House to give Mubarak a shove. http://wapo.st/hkru0P
Clinton call f/ "orderly transition" in #Egypt is step in right direction; next step should be: "Mubarak, go." #jan25
U.S. must speak louder on #Egypt -- to be heard over rubber bullets and tear gas canisters that say "Made In USA."
U.S. admin still talking "reform" by #Egypt govt??? http://on.msnbc.com/eLJCr0 Sounds way behind the curve.
Mubarak may be fomenting chaos so that the army is forced to act. Or he may be fueling his jet. Which is it?
After Pres. Obama's remarks, if #Mubarak squelches dissent w/ bloodbath U.S. must react w/ aid cutoff or other sanction.
RT @KeithOlbermann: It's a guess, but I believe POTUS's speech was crafted to show #Mubarak he does NOT have unquestioned US support nor ...
Pres. Obama about to speak on Egypt crisis.
Mubarak clearly believes he has the military leadership's support. But will the soldiers fire on their neighbors?
U.S. should be on the right side of history in Egypt. Looks like that's in the streets, not the presidential suite.

Sen-elect Paul is channeling Barry Goldwater. If you don't count the Aqua Buddha stuff.
Rand Paul giving speech, says ppl of Ky have "come to take our govt back." He'll be trouble for GOP, too, not just for Dems.
You have to be amused: C. O'Donnell (and S. Palin) cost GOP not just Del. Senate seat but Del. House seat as well.
Early indications that youth vote nationwide seems lower than usual. Obviously, good for GOP and bad for Dems.
I had it backwards -- 56 pct want govt to do less, 39 pct want it to do more. Still accurate on the no-goldilocks thing.
More exit polls: 56 pct want govt to do more, 39 pct want govt to do less. No goldilocks "just right" view, it seems.

Final word on Juan Wms firing: At least one Muslim advocacy group agrees with my take: http://bit.ly/b4fu3g
But really the misfit has been obvious for years. NPR could have just let Wms contract die quietly long ago.
Btm line probably was that NPR listeners had had enuf of J Wms and NPR mgmt saw an opening to act.
Not surprised at Wms' new $2m Fox contract -- they can paint him as a hero. And of course bash NPR. Is this good?
Sherrod parallel is inexact but not crazy. Wms spent most of the conversation slamming bigotry. After demonstrating it.
NPR would have been perfectly justified to fire him because of Fox connection or whatever. But this specific incident?
My guess (agree with Folkenflik) is that for NPR this was either last straw or convenient opportunity.
Bigotry definitely NOT okay and I was outraged at first but hearing the whole encounter changed my view.

Still gorgeous in Asheville. Made it outside! Squeezed out column f/ Fri asking why o why GOP doesn't even make a play f/ black voters.
Notes from "Disintegration" book tour: Spent day doing radio ivus fm Asheville NC hotel rm, looking out at gorgeous unattainable countryside
Maybe inevitable that first Af-Am presidency would lead to perceived friction. But perception of Latinos even worse. http://bit.ly/drToTi
Depressing but maybe inevitable Rasmussen poll today on race relations: http://bit.ly/drToTi
@maddow got thrown out of Christine O'Donnell hq but at least nobody got shazammed into a frog. Be careful, Rachel...
Good piece by Jeff Goldberg about Haley Barbour and an issue that's has always stuck in my craw http://bit.ly/dsrbi4
About to board the Acela -- my new home -- for ride back to D.C., and will be chatting at washingtonpost.com at 2 about "Disintegration."
The thing about Christine O'Donnell's "I'm not a witch" ad is that with the spooky lighting, she looks like she might actually be one.
Later, dropped by 30 Rock to talk on the Rachel Maddow Show about Christine O'Donnell's secret-agent delusion http://bit.ly/aTPiRk
Whew -- the Colbert Report wasn't the most terrifying thing I've done in my life, but it was the most terrifying thing I've done on tv.
Gray day in Manhattan. Getting ready for my Colbert close-up, and then scheduled to drop by Maddow show to talk O'Donnell and Paladino.
Christine O'Donnell is the gift that keeps on giving. Now she's "privy to" some "classified information" about China: http://bit.ly/aTPiRk
I mean, if you're going to try to buy an election, which the Supreme Court says is just fine, at least do it openly, like Meg Whitman...
From my vantage point on the now-delayed Acela, today's outrage (which I'm writing about f/ tomorrow): http://wapo.st/9u9ctM
I'm biased but Michigan is the most exciting football team on earth right now. Wouldn't be near the fun if we had, like a defense.
@BetsyMTP Must see? Like a train wreck? I never have jitters before a tv appearance, but this one...
@Orcaspapa I have nothing but admiration -- fiction is hard! No beer yet, but I will definitely collect.
Outrage of the day? Those hideous U.S.-led syphilis experiments in Guatemala -- http://wapo.st/b8oZwa -- for which no apology suffices.
Okay this is definitely tweet-worthy: I'll be guesting on the Colbert Report on Monday to talk abt my new book "Disintegration." Yikes.
Hi, everyone. Sorry I've been remiss in Tweeting, but I promise to get back into the flow -- especially now that it's political crunch time.
What is there to say about how the  scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested and handcuffed in his own home? Just that race still matters.
I surrender. After resisting the siren song of Twitter, I'm finally joining the conversation. Readers, viewers and friends, let's talk.
