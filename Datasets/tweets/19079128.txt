@TerryVanDuynNC "We need to make education our Number One priority" #EdForum2015
@TerryVanDuynNC -Lowering tax cuts for corporations is higher priority than public education for the majority party in Raleigh. #EdForum2015

Of AVL renters, 43.6% are cost burdened (paying more than 30% of income for housing). Of owners, 29.6% are cost burdened.
@sandymaxey Yes, more.
For renters, the greatest number (45.2%) are 1-person households. 2-person households make up another 29.5%.
In AVL 49.3% of households are owners &amp; 50.7% are renters. Compare that to 67.6% owner occupied &amp; 32.4% renters regionally.
Over 20.4% of AVL's population lives in poverty. "Nearly one in three children within the city lives in poverty."
27.2% of AVL renter households have incomes less than $15k/yr. 2015-2020 greatest projected increase will be households from $50k-75k/yr.
Currently about 43% of AVL households have annual incomes below $35k/yr. 18.4% have annual incomes b/w $50k &amp; 75k/yr.
2015-2020: it's projected that the highest demographic increase will be among ages 65-74, 1104 households. Most of them aging in place.
AVL Population growth from 2000-2010: 12.8%, 9484 people. From 2010-2015: 7.4%, 6178 people. Projected from 2015-2020: 7.1%, 6,374 people.

@FindTheTruthAVL Repeal the unsustainable tax schemes for the wealthiest and the big corporations. Then you'd find $ for EITC, schools, etc.
@FindTheTruthAVL Incorrect. Hunger numbers are increasing as poor and middle class get squeezed. Corporate profits rise w/huge tax cuts.
@FindTheTruthAVL Big tax cuts for the wealthiest mean big problems for the poor and middle class. Taxes shifted onto poor and middle class.
@FindTheTruthAVL Incorrect. EITC elimination, child care cuts, sales tax changes, small biz tax increases mean $ from poor&amp;working class.

You can't put saboteurs in charge. "Govt doesn't work! Watch us prove it!" NCGOP does not want Medicaid to succeed. Because socialism.
So far? They've kept Aldona Wos in charge despite an incredible record of mismanagement at DHHS, and they no-bid hired a DC consulting firm.
The party line is that "Medicaid is broken", so those 400,000 people will need to hush up while Republicans work super hard to "fix it".

@NathanRamsey115 The EITC is widely recognized as one of the most effective anti-poverty tools nationwide. This NCGA chose to end it.

@NWestAVL So glad you seek to help. I believe that good government can make lives better, too. Offer opportunity and compassion to children.
@NWestAVL I'm sure. So, to sum up - You agree that children ought to be treated with kindness, offered opportunity and compassion.
No, seriously! NCGOP prefers to give wealthiest tax cuts rather than offer more families, elderly, &amp;disabled ppl health care &amp;opportunity.
@NWestAVL What actions would you prefer to take to demonstrate commitment to opportunity and compassion for all of those children?
They've already hit the working class with EITC elimination, child care cuts, education cuts, unemployment cuts. Why? Tax cuts for the rich.
NCGOP seeks to balance budget on backs of the poor. Quarrel over how much should be cut from Medicaid. Children, elderly, disabled get hit.
@NWestAVL I was just wondering if you had a vision of how to offer opportunity and compassion to children.
@NWestAVL How would you demonstrate a commitment to opportunity and compassion for all of those children?
@NWestAVL Ah. How many of the children do deserve opportunity and compassion then?
Headed to AVL Housing &amp;Community Development Comm mtg (CityHall, 9am). On the agenda: RAD gentrification study, housing in commercial areas.
@NWestAVL I can't imagine any of us would tell those children they don't deserve a life of opportunity and don't deserve our compassion.
@NWestAVL All of them, Nathan. What would be the kindest way to handle all of them?

...anyhow... There are many more egregious stories to tell. Please connect with a candidate who will get to work turning our state around.
Those kicks weren't enough, however. #NCGA slashed child care for working fams. 1000s of children to lose daycare &amp;after-school programs.
If working people weren't already under the gun with stagnant wages, #NCGA provided two kicks in the gut by denying them EITC &amp; Medicaid.
The Medicaid Expansion, which was almost entirely paid for by the federal government, would've given a half million people health insurance.
While pulling the rug out of from under 900,000 families, the #NCGA also denied 500,000 people the opportunity to access Medicaid services.
In NC 900,000 working class families will see the EITC taken by the #NCGA. Meanwhile: tax cuts for the wealthiest.
"In 2012 the combined impact of the EITC and Child Tax Credit lifted 10.1 million ppl out of poverty in the country." http://t.co/xCE9RxYuhj
EITC, Earned Income Tax Credit: a benefit for working people who have low to moderate income. This was eliminated by #NCGOP.
ICYMI: #NCGA elminated EITC, rejected Medicaid expansion, slashed child care, underfunded education. Meanwhile, tax cuts for the wealthiest.

In short - multinational corporations given carte blanche to inject secret chemicals under your land, and local people get nothing.
You can read the Fracking bill here: http://t.co/48teVMLLKM #NCGA
Fracking #NCGA will "study ways to limit the growth of [local gov] property tax revenues that result from increased property valuations".
#NCGA Fracking Bill prohibits local governments from collecting revenue from multinational corporations pulling gas out of the land.
#NCGA Fracking bill prohibits local governments from having any say-so over local property rights, water security, etc.
#NCGA fracking bill says that if fracking corporation poisons your groundwater, they have to provide you with water. Cold comfort.
#NCGA Fracking bill forces private property owners to allow frackers on their land and to allow pipelines.
@MattBallance Yes. Fracking bill bans emergency workers from knowing/talking abt fracking fluid contents until state bureaucrat gives ok.
But seriously - CTS - http://t.co/uctc1qvlNU
If you don't talk about them, they can't hurt you! Right? RIGHT?
The #NCGA fracking bill makes it illegal to talk about the chemicals used in fracking. Class One Misdemeanor, baby! http://t.co/48teVMLLKM
Ethylene Glycol is antifreeze.
What chemicals are used in fracking? Over 600, including: Hydrochloric Acid, Ammonium Persulfate, &amp; Ethylene Glycol! http://t.co/NqmIPphm0a
Each frack uses an avg of 4.4m gallons of water &amp;40k gallons of chemicals. Those are mixed w/sand and high-pressure injected in the ground.
How much water is required to frack a well, and where does this water come from? http://t.co/bndBsWu9Ay
Fracking risks include: ground water contamination, noise pollution, gases &amp;fracking chems coming to the surface, &amp; increased earthquakes.
Fracking cracks open rock formations deep in the earth, allowing natural gas to escape. Sounds awesome. But wait, there are concerns.
What is fracking? It's short for Hydraulic Fracturing, a practice of injecting water, chemicals, and sand at high pressure into the ground.

@NathanRamsey115 Education, Food aid, Health insurance, Child care, Unemployment benefits - these things are critical to equal opportunity.
@NathanRamsey115 So you're advocating for more tax cuts for the wealthiest and big corporations? I just want to provide opportunity for all.
@NathanRamsey115 I'll keep my fingers crossed, but I won't hold my breath. Helping cities &amp;raising revenue haven't been #NCGA strong suits.

@NathanRamsey115 Here's hoping we can find a way to equitably, fairly recover the Wal-Mart tax cut revenue that'll cost AVL taxpayers $1.4m.
@NathanRamsey115 It's also happening in states that didn't cut taxes for the wealthiest at the expense of the poor and middle class...
@NathanRamsey115 I was just curious as to whether you felt we were moving closer to or further away from tax justice. Have a great day.
@NathanRamsey115 I'm aware of those talking points. However, EITC, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, child care were all cut or eliminated.
@NathanRamsey115 You've been very vocal abt achieving tax justice. One of the few! But it looks like poor &amp;middle class are getting shafted.
@NathanRamsey115 Because it looks like cutting taxes for the wealthy is higher priority for #NCGA than adequately funding public education.
@NathanRamsey115 Thanks for the conversation. How do you feel abt proposed cuts to teacher asst's &amp;other education items to pay for raises?
Hey Buncombe County - #NCGA GOP wants to injure cities and leave the poor and middle class to shoulder the tax burden. Vote accordingly.
There's talk of further cuts to Medicaid eligibility next year. #NCGA War on the poor continues. Meanwhile - tax cuts for the wealthy!
#NCGA eliminated EITC, rejected Medicaid expansion, decimated unemployment insurance, slashed child care. Meanwhile: wealthy get tax cuts!
#NCGA to cut $390m from education in order to give raises to those teachers who'll give up tenure. Meanwhile - Tax Cuts for the wealthiest!

In addition to denying health insurance to working families, NCGOP also eliminated EITC, slashed child care, underfunded education.
@NathanRamsey115 The federal gov't would cover 100% of the cost initially, then 90%. Healthier kids, healthier families. Price is right!

This one then - the time that the NCGOP raised taxes on 80% of North Carolinians in order to give really wealthy people a tax cut?
How about the time the NCGOP slashed child care funding in order to give really wealthy people a tax cut?
Remember when NCGOP rejected Medicaid expansion, denying health insurance to 100s of 1000s of ppl, even though it was paid for by the Feds?
Remember that time when the NCGOP underfunded public education to give really wealthy people a tax cut?
Remember that time when the NCGOP eliminated the Earned Income Tax Credit for working families to give really wealthy people a tax cut?
