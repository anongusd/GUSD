Also we know there are other "Legendary Figures". Are they also replacable? Can I knock off father time and take his spot. You'd think a movie about the Big Red Man would answer my questions. But in the end it only leaves me with more. 10 outa 10 movie though.
Also what happened to Mrs. Clause of the previous Santa. From "The Santa Clause 2" we know Santa Claus needs a wife. It was the driving force of the whole plot. Does this mean Mrs. Clause dies when Santa does? What does this say about how society views dpmestic wives?
This leaves me with a few questions. Did the Elves not like the previous Santa? This would help explain why the elves are so standoffish and cold when Scott first gets to the North Pole. Being condescending and what have you.
My biggest sticking point of "The Santa Claus" with Tim Allen, is that there is literally 0 remorse for the death of the previous Santa. This is made more bewildering with the further sequels that show how much the elves care for Scott Calvin Santa.

@mschlapp Now people like Brian Kemp, are Republicans acting like Jim Crow era Democrats, attempting to maintain the Ruby Red South.
@mschlapp Except the Republicans were desperate to break the Democratic stranglehold in the south. Republican candidates rose and Democrats switched parties to defend the structures of white supremacy. Bsrry Goldwater and Richard Nixon appealed to the white southerner with dog whistles.
@mschlapp And they failed to enforce that right for nearly 100 years. Democrats enacted Jim Crow and it was the Democrats of the North who finally stood up to their own party in 1964. For a brief moment it seemed like the Republicans and Democrats could stand together on this issue.
