Deidre DeJear can‚Äôt undo the requirement‚Äînot without an @IaLegis democratic majority and a Democratic governor‚Äîbut our vote in this race can show them just how strongly we believe that all Iowans should have a vote.		/end
The comfort of a few frightened and misinformed Iowans emerges here as more important than the actual votes of some of our state‚Äôs most vulnerable people. /10
‚ÄîSec. Pate is trying to educate people about the new requirement.  He‚Äôs doing a pretty good job of that.  But the fact is he‚Äôs still willing to make voting harder for 1 demographic in order to reassure another demographic that the nonexistent problem they fear has been solved. /9
His rationale was ideological: our vote should be our most precious possession &amp; should be kept secure, like a locked house.  ‚ÄúSome folks‚Äù worry about cheating at the polls.  So this rule satisfies the paranoid &amp; disenfranchises those on the margins.  And‚Äîdon‚Äôt get me wrong	/8
During our meeting with Sec. Pate, we asked him how much voter fraud had been committed.  What level of in-person fraud at the polls justified this undue burden?  He couldn‚Äôt say.  He said there were no statistics.  I posit that that‚Äôs because there is no in-person fraud. /7
I work with people with #disabilities, and we hosted the current SOS, Paul Pate, for a voter education on Monday.  We tried to hold his feet to the fire a little. /6
But if you don‚Äôt drive, or if you are homeless, getting a voter ID is one more hoop you have to jump through.  Bottom line, this means fewer votes cast.  And those most likely to be disenfranchised are students, people with disabilities, the poor, and the elderly.  /5
That‚Äôs because the SOS has authority over voting in our state. And our current SOS recommended to IA legislature that IDs be required at the polls.  This is new.  Until now, registered voters did not have to show ID to vote. That might seem an easy requirement easy to meet. /4
She‚Äôs dynamic, charismatic, and she‚Äôs going places politically.  I hope she can start as our new SOS.		Thing is, Secretary of State is one of those races that doesn‚Äôt get much publicity but is crucial to all the others. /3
You would probably choose @DeidreDeJear even if you didn‚Äôt know anything about her.  She‚Äôs the Democratic candidate.  But if you don‚Äôt know anything about her, you should. And you should be telling everyone you know. /2
