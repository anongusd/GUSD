I spoke with experts on ways Congress can work to bridge gaps in protecting our national electric grid from cyber attacks and other threats at this week’s @HSGAC roundtable. https://t.co/w04lfpUrC8
Countless Nevadans who suffer from ALS are burdened by long waiting periods to access disability benefits. I’m proud to join my colleagues on the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, a bipartisan bill to help provide relief by cutting the waiting period for those fighting ALS.
While I’m glad that @DHSgov finally complied with a court order and will briefly extend #TPS for hundreds of thousands of people, this is simply not enough. I will continue fighting for comprehensive immigration reform because we need permanent bipartisan solutions. https://t.co/r9CjTKC5Z1
I applaud @GovSisolak for making education and access to quality health care a top priority. This $900,000 grant will greatly benefit @UNLV in helping expand their nursing program and address the medical shortage facing Nevada. https://t.co/IpmwXAccWq
Nevada is home to a growing data storage industry. At a recent @SenateCommerce hearing about federal data privacy, I asked about the steps being taken to secure data-storage facilities from attacks. https://t.co/Qz7TgiK3eG
I’ve met with organizations like @W4WNV and @RebelVETS on how we can help veterans find good-paying jobs. I’m confident that my common sense #HireStudentVeteransAct will put student vets on a pathway towards success.https://t.co/chrS5SJObg
.@SecretaryPerry and @ENERGY officials’ claims are deceptive and wrong. Nevada’s elected officials were not properly informed about the plutonium shipment last year. It’s time for them to work with @GovSisolak and the Congressional delegation to regain our trust. https://t.co/i23lafZowY

I applaud the House for passing a bill to expand background checks and hope Senate Leadership will give us a chance to vote on this package. I’ll continue to stand with the majority of Americans who support these reforms to keep our children, families, and communities safe.
Happy #ReadAcrossAmericaDay. What book are you going to read to your children tonight?
In honor of #WomensHistoryMonth, I read an excerpt of Turning Pages: My Life Story, a book written by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. This book teaches our children to be fearless in pursuit of their dreams, no matter their circumstances, background, or obstacles.
Books are key to unlocking a solid education and it’s important that we do all we can to help introduce our children to the joys of reading at an early age. It was a pleasure to join the students @ClarkCountySch’s Bartlett Elementary and take part in #NevadaReadingWeek! #1ForKids https://t.co/vHZ6OgrfwC
This #WomensHistoryMonth we celebrate the countless contributions that women make to all facets of our society including the arts, athletics, science, math, entertainment, business, technology, military service, and politics.
Far too many members of our communities are still not fully protected by our country’s current anti-discrimination laws. I’m helping introduce the Do No Harm bill, which will make clear that companies cannot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
As #BlackHistoryMonth comes to a close, let’s also pay tribute to the millions of Black veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep our nation safe. Thank you for your service to our country! https://t.co/Duuw22vyDZ

I’m cosponsoring the #ChildCareforWorkingFamiliesAct because it's time for us to give hard-working Nevada families access to quality, affordable child care. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/pmlfOfsVQA
There’s no denying the facts -- the catastrophic effects of climate change are real, and things will get worse if we don’t act. That’s why I'm co-sponsoring @SenatorCarper's resolution because Congress should take immediate action to address this crisis.
Mr. Wheeler has done nothing to ease my concerns about his lack of commitment to environmental protections and the well-being of Nevadans. I voted NO on his nomination to head the @EPA.
Honored to receive the esteemed Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the U.S. Eagle Award for my work to expand affordable health coverage for Guardsmen and Reservists who serve as civilian federal employees.

Women everywhere have the right to make their own medical decisions, in consultation with their doctor, not a politician. S.311 is another attack on a woman’s right to choose. For that reason, I voted no.

I’m co-sponsoring the Raise the Wage Act because Nevada’s hardworking families shouldn’t have to work full time and still live in poverty. It is time to raise our federal minimum wage in a way that makes sense for everyone.
This Administration’s misguided decision to implement a gag rule on #TitleX hurts the 4 million + women and their families who rely on it for care, and puts communities of color at risk of losing access to health care altogether.
I’m heading to Yucca Mountain next week to make sure my colleagues hear Nevadans’ voices loud and clear. Home means Nevada and I will not allow our state to become the nation’s dumping ground for nuclear waste.

Let’s be clear: there is no justification for declaring a national security emergency at the border. This is no way to govern. We need smart, bipartisan solutions and leadership to address this humanitarian crisis --  not an ineffective wall that will cost taxpayers billions.
The President declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress is reckless and wrong. I do not support his unilateral decision that undermines Congress and our co-equal branches of government.

Without the ACA’s protections, millions could lose access to life-saving coverage. That’s why I could not support Barr’s nomination.

My full statement in response to the President’s #SOTU2019 here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/KEhJTeB6Al
This Administration's relentless attacks on women's reproductive rights is completely unacceptable. I stand with the majority of Nevadans who support defending a woman's right to choose. #SOTU
This President's repeated attempts to sabotage our health care system have put families across the country in jeopardy of not having access to care. People like my #SOTU guest Tanya, a 3x cancer survivor, depend on the ACA for survival.
Ending HIV is a noble goal &amp; I welcome the President’s plan reduce transmission by 2030. But let’s remember that this is the same Administration that has put PEPFAR funding, which has been extremely successful at reducing HIV infections, on the chopping block. #SOTU
Rising prescription drug costs are affecting Americans’ ability to afford life-saving medications and both sides of the aisle want to see immediate action. It's time to put the partisan games aside and work together to make prescription drugs more affordable. #SOTU
The President's role as Commander-in-Chief also includes uniting people, but he continues to divide us whenever he talks about his wall. The majority of Nevadans don’t support spending billions on a senseless wall. They want smart solutions to fix our broken immigration system.
The President is continuing to mislead the nation when it comes to immigration. He needs to look at the facts and then work on a real bipartisan immigration plan that will actually fix our broken immigration system. #SOTU https://t.co/EN8YbiY9dZ
Last month, I heard from countless families in Nevada who were struggling to pay their mortgages &amp; car payments due to this President’s shutdown. We can’t let another senseless shutdown happen again. #SOTU
If the President is sincere about working together with Democrats then he needs to stop playing political games and start supporting legislation that invests in our schools, fixes our roads and bridges, and makes health care more affordable for working families. #SOTU

Today I was proud to vote for S.1, bipartisan legislation that strengthens the US-Israel relationship through robust security assistance and holds the brutal Assad regime accountable for their human rights violations in Syria.
My colleagues and I continued our discussion on the topic of doctor shortages across the country at today’s @HELPCmteDems meeting. In Nevada, we’re already experiencing a doctor shortage and it’s one of the reasons why our state ranks last when it comes to access to health care. https://t.co/00lWMqFYW9

I helped introduce the Keep Families Together Act today to ensure that the federal government carries out immigration procedures in the best interest of detained children. https://t.co/ELz4dwQbE1
Addressing Nevada’s physician shortage will require smart, bipartisan solutions such as investing in STEM education so that we can assemble a strong workforce of medical professionals. I’ll continue to work on ways to help more Nevada students pursue medical careers.
Our country is on the brink of a health care crisis and in Nevada, our doctor shortage is one of the reasons why our state ranks last when it comes to access to health care. We need forward-thinking solutions to protect Nevadans’ access to quality health care. https://t.co/n85LqVfGYr

Nevadans like Tanya shouldn’t have to worry about what could happen if they lose their health insurance. This President needs to see first-hand the lives that he is putting at risk with his attempts to undermine and repeal the #ACA.

La brecha salarial de género sigue siendo un problema generalizado que existe en todos los grupos demográficos. Yo apoyo la Ley de Justicia en el Cheque por que las mujeres de Nevada no deberían estar recibiendo menos dinero solo por su género en 2019.
The gender pay gap continues to be a pervasive issue that exists across all demographics and affects families from every background. I’m supporting the #PaycheckFairness Act because Nevada’s women shouldn’t receive less pay because of their gender in 2019. https://t.co/I33uwG4yMm

I heard directly from Nevada families who are experiencing real-life consequences as a result of this senseless shutdown. Families are struggling to pay their mortgages &amp; car payments. The President needs to grow up, put a stop to these political games, and reopen the government. https://t.co/MXT3CN5CUo
RT @jgillanNews3LV: .@SenJackyRosen meeting with federal employees furloughed by shutdown. They’re missing a paycheck today. @News3LV https…
The President cannot continue to hold real families hostage over his inane border wall. Reopen the government and then we’ll talk about border security -- but we can’t make any progress at the border if the government continues to be closed.
The Trump Administration's shutdown is on track to becoming the longest government shutdown in modern U.S. history. Nevadans shouldn’t have to suffer over the President’s political games.
Today, thousands of federal workers in Nevada and across the country will miss their paycheck because of the President’s reckless shutdown.
In addition to Nevada’s federal workers being left without pay, the government shutdown is also slowing down large-scale recovery efforts aimed at helping rural communities to rebuild from last year’s massive wildfires. https://t.co/lkvb6VXwzo
About 51,000 TSA workers will miss a paycheck tomorrow nationwide. Roughly 1,000 of those employees work at @LASairport.  We cannot afford to let the President’s shutdown affect our national security. https://t.co/kUEs7rjb94
Food stamps, housing subsidies, &amp; other government services that help working families are all at risk as a result of the President's shutdown. The impacts of this needless &amp; avoidable shutdown are falling hardest on those who can afford it least. https://t.co/Kv7l5IpcJ6
I’m glad to see the House pass legislation similar to the resolution I introduced last year to defend the constitutionality of the ACA. Our fight to protect health care is far from over. I’ll continue to make defending protections for pre-existing conditions a top priority.
I’m heading to the floor to join @SenSchumer in demanding a vote on House-passed legislation to re-open the government. Tomorrow, thousands of federal workers will miss their paycheck. We cannot let this shutdown go on for one more day.
Nevada plays a pivotal role in the defense of our country. I had a productive meeting with Lt Gen Scobee, Chief of the @USAFReserve, to talk about Air Force Reserve operations in Nevada.

Dangerous weapons should never be able to get into the hands of dangerous individuals. I’m joining @ChrisMurphyCT because it’s past time we expand background checks for gun purchases. Far too many families have lost a loved one to gun violence. We must act to save lives.
We need smart solutions and leadership to address this humanitarian crisis --  not a medieval, ineffective wall that will cost taxpayers billions and certainly not a reckless government shutdown that only hurts working families.
The only crisis at the border is the one created by this Administration’s cruel policies and actions towards immigrant families - separating children from their parents, firing tear gas into crowds, and politicizing the deaths of innocent children. Enough is enough.
8 years ago, a gunman in Arizona went on a senseless shooting spree that took six lives and left @GabbyGiffords fighting for her life. Far too many tragedies have happened since that day, and Gabby is still fighting to keep others safe -- and we should too.
The Trump Admin’s efforts to ship weapons-grade plutonium to Nevada raises serious concerns about how transporting &amp; storing this waste could affect our health &amp; safety. I’m glad to see a hearing has been set. We need to put a stop to this reckless plan. https://t.co/RTEravN7tL
My team was proud to attend yesterday’s vigil alongside @Culinary226 and Southern Nevada’s faith community in support of migrants and refugees. I will continue to stand up and fight for our immigrant community. https://t.co/jrTGTngXPh

👋 Nevada, be sure to follow @SenJackyRosen on Instagram and Facebook!
Each day that the President continues this shutdown, he’s choosing to hurt Nevada families who work to protect our public lands and keep our outdoor economy running. https://t.co/01vVcFtLqF
The Administration shouldn't be planning a pay increase for cabinet members at a time when thousands of federal workers across the nation are going without pay. This shutdown was avoidable. It’s up to the President to come to the table and get the government back up and running. https://t.co/HIhMxNqZx4

I will not stand by and let this Administration allow Nevada families to needlessly suffer. https://t.co/VzlmJ5v1uL
The Trump Administration has now allowed the government shutdown to go on for 12 days. That's 12 days of a Republican-controlled Congress leaving federal employees across Nevada without a guaranteed paycheck during the holidays, all while allowing funding for VAWA to lapse.

New Years in Las Vegas is always such a beautiful sight! Wishing everyone a happy, healthy, and wonderful 2019! https://t.co/3XrpXef0Q5
These tragedies shouldn’t be politicized. They should be fully investigated without delay. We need to know what happened and how these tragedies can be avoided. It’s the least that we can do. https://t.co/RhL210Xk4o
I plan to donate my pay during the shutdown to organizations in Nevada that help survivors of domestic violence. Read more here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/yfqO0voxAA
VAWA has been pivotal in helping our state tackle one of the highest rates of domestic violence against women. Nevada's hardworking families shouldn't be left to suffer as a result of this President's irresponsible behavior. It's no way to govern.
The government has shut down for a third time under the watch of a Republican-controlled White House &amp; Congress. To make matters worse, authorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) lapsed as a result of the Trump Administration's reckless shutdown.
My team in Las Vegas joined the @LVLCC Education Alliance Committee and discussed the progress being made on my STEM education legislation. I’ll continue to support policies that improve Nevada’s education system. https://t.co/ZHPw3YsgOI

We cannot allow private interests to stack the deck against small businesses, consumers, innovators, and hardworking families. https://t.co/LUn5WyhCYy
We need to do everything possible to protect health care for millions of Americans, especially given today's disastrous decision. That's why I introduced a resolution to intervene in this court case &amp; am fighting to stop partisan attacks on our health care. https://t.co/tN2F30o0FB
A federal judge in Texas has just ruled the ACA unconstitutional which could jeopardize health care for millions of Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Nevadans with pre-existing conditions. We must fight - now more than ever - to protect our health care.
The Administration’s policies are exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis at our border. We must continue to demand transparency &amp; accountability by those who are responsible for overseeing the detention of immigrant families &amp; children. https://t.co/RhFeEakbcL
This week, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to hold lawmakers responsible for sexual harassment &amp; retaliation. This is a good first step, but we must bring greater accountability to Congress by expanding protections to those who experience all forms of discrimination.

GOP leaders continue to push a partisan immigration agenda that fails to permanently protect our Dreamers, makes drastic cuts to legal immigration in ways that will hurt NV's economy, &amp; doesn’t adequately address the humanitarian crisis at our border. https://t.co/GUEYCKaWav
Their families come to the U.S. out of desperation. We need to address this humanitarian crisis head on. That means reuniting families immediately and passing a bipartisan, comprehensive solution to fix our broken immigration system. We need action now. #FamiliesBelongTogether
These children are not criminals. They're fleeing unimaginable violence in their home countries and looking for safety.
At CBP, we saw immigrant families held in what looked very much like jail cells. Unaccompanied children are held in a bare, open space for days. This is where they eat, sleep, and wait to hear where they will be sent next. They are anxious and hopeless.
In El Paso, I also toured a Customs and Border Protection processing center and holding facility where families seeking asylum and unaccompanied migrant children are held.
The tent city looks more like a military installation in a foreign country than a place where children are cared for in the U.S.
These children are being held in dusty tents. They are in an unfamiliar place and far from their families and friends. Their showers and bathrooms are outside in trailers. They’re given damp rags to protect their faces from the heat and dust.
Seeing these minors alone without any idea what will happen next was disturbing. No child should have to live in these conditions.
This week, I went to Texas and toured the Tornillo detention facility outside of El Paso. This is the site of the tent city holding unaccompanied immigrant children and children who have been separated from their parents.
As a former union member, I understand the support that labor organizations bring to families. That’s why I'll continue fighting to ensure Nevada’s workers have the ability to advocate for themselves &amp; their union rights. #Union https://t.co/Jk7mh154hd
SCOTUS’ decision deals a major blow to our unions, who provide working Americans with a path to the middle class. Fair-share fees are necessary to support collective bargaining activities so that all workers can advocate for better wages &amp; safer working conditions.

This tax bill is a giveaway to giant corporations and special interests, and it doesn't make the tax code simpler or fairer. It's the exact opposite of what the American people wanted. https://t.co/qQSdaJ3EON

Instead of listening to their constituents &amp; working w/ Dems, @GOP is choosing to put people’s lives at risk just 2 give the 1% a tax break.
Hard-working #Nevada families will suffer from sky-high premiums, a crushing #agetax, &amp; our most vulnerable will lose #Medicaid coverage.
So what happens when millions lose their #healthcare because of the @GOP repeal?
Families across our country – women, veterans, seniors, disabled Americans, even vulnerable children – make up that number.

#TrumpCare refuses to consider those whose lives are at risk &amp; whose loved ones fear the worst.
.@SenateGOP failed to hold even one hearing to debate their disastrous #healthcare plan. That's no way to govern.
.@SenateGOP wants to cut funding for #Medicaid to give a tax cut to the 1%. If that’s not morally bankrupt, I don’t know what is #TrumpCare

Women in Nevada still only make on average 82 cents on the dollar compared to men, w/ minority women earning even less than that. #EqualPay https://t.co/eOerORMNpl
Celebrating #WomensHistoryMonth means recognizing great women like Florence Jones Murphy, Nevada's first woman commercial pilot. #STEM https://t.co/opN2OZf2O9

I’ve said it before &amp; I will say it again: we need an investigation to get to the bottom of these reports on Russian interference #Sessions
Regardless of his recusal today, if #Sessions is found to have lied during his confirmation hearing, then he should immediately resign.
Kicking off #WomensHistoryMonth by showing support for protecting women's health. #IStandWithPP https://t.co/iH2KBruE2n
Thank you @Astrid_NV for being so brave to share your story last night. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/JKXbMfIlIY
Providing feedback on tonight's #JointSession. Bottom line: actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/5RpDwTBlOB
86,000 Nevadans signed up for health insurance through the #ACA for this year alone. We cannot leave them without coverage. #ProtectOurCare
I support investing in our military, and agree that we should have a strong national defense, but we must invest wisely. #JointSession
Fixing our broken immigration system should not mean tearing apart families. #FightingForAll
These are challenging times. This is what I hope to hear tonight during the President's #JointSession: https://t.co/KuYJwcg4lp

Tonight, I hope he chooses to unite us &amp; not divide us, because unity &amp; strength in diversity is what makes America great #JointSession
@POTUS has said he condemns these threats, yet we have not seen him take action to bring our country together.
Today our country woke up to more division with news of hate &amp; anti-Semitic crimes taking place again in our communities, including in #NV03

The Flynn resignation brings up more questions than answers.  I will support any effort to properly and responsibly investigate this matter.
I'm watching the reports of Michael Flynn's resignation very closely. The American people deserve the truth.
I've received my Science, Space and Technology subcommittee assignments: Research &amp; Technology and Energy.  Exciting &amp; important work to do.
I'm very pleased to announce my #HASC sub-committee assignments: Tactical Air and Land Forces and Personnel.

#PressSec 's comments on this are outrageous, as is the Administration's refusal to properly acknowledge the Holocaust. (2)
I have co-sponsored H.Res. 78, calling on the executive branch to affirm that the Nazi regime targeted Jews during the Holocaust. (1)
Feb. is #BlackHistoryMonth Take some time to celebrate and learn about the great contributions African Americans have made to our country.
Very concerned about reports that #Iran has conducted an illegal ballistic missile test.  We need additional sanctions in response.
I was privileged to meet with His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan today with the #HASC to discuss challenges and threats in the Middle East.
Proud to co-sponsor SOLVE Act to overturn Trump's travel ban.  No one should be denied entry based soley on race, religion, or nationality.
Huge turnout for the #WomensMarch Thank you to all who marched today, and stood up for equality and justice for all. https://t.co/fyNSNDpN6y
I am happy to announce I will have the privilege to serve on the House Armed Services Committee, working for our men and women in uniform.
