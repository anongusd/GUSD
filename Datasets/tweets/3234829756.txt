@Wonko_the_sane_ @doctorscience Also: Yes, I think that the actual literal text of the Bible has more significance than Rambam was willing to attribute to it. No, that does not make me a Karaite. #ParshaChat

A4 When people talk of someone in terms of potential, it rings really hollow if they're not specific about anything impressive they can imagine someone doing. #ParshaChat https://t.co/6xT5J9aVnX

@Roewoof @parshachat I like that aspect of Shabbat too. The problem I've found is that a lot of the rules can separate me from what I want from myself as well in ways that aren't always good. I'm more chill about some rules than I used to be, and it's mostly helped. #ParshaChat
@Roewoof @parshachat One thing that I've found really helpful personally is limiting the extent to which I engage with nightmare fuel on Shabbat. #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @Wonko_the_sane_ I definitely think that it's more art than philosophy. Rambam would call me a heretic, but I can live with that. He's not the only Jewish voice. #ParshaChat

@Roewoof @parshachat A1 That seems to me to be consistent with the text, and it also makes intuitive sense to me that this would be that case. That said, it does confuse me some why proximity to the Creator of the world would be so intrinsically dangerous. #ParshaChat

@Wonko_the_sane_ @doctorscience Say more about why you like it? #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ ‚Äî and that there had to be some way to handle that constructively. #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ I read that as God learning that you can't actually get the people you want by just finding the one good person and smiting everyone else. People are problematic, people are always going to have the potential to do bad things and disappoint you. #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ Yes! And also: Gen. 8:21 YHVH smelled the pleasing odor, and YHVH said to Himself: ‚ÄúNever again will I doom the earth because of man, since the devisings of man‚Äôs mind are evil from his youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done. #ParshaChat

@doctorscience @aneeman Sometimes when something is really important, people can get *way* too intense about egging each other on. (Actually, as someone who grew up in a basketball fandom town, I'm aware that the thing doesn't even have to be important for that to happen.) #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @aneeman Ex. 36:6 Moses thereupon had this proclamation made throughout the camp: ‚ÄúLet no man or woman make further effort toward gifts for the sanctuary!‚Äù So the people stopped bringing:	Ex. 36:7 their efforts had been more than enough for all the tasks to be done. #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @aneeman Ex. 36:5 and said to Moses, ‚ÄúThe people are bringing more than is needed for the tasks entailed in the work that YHVH has commanded to be done.‚Äù &gt;&gt; #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @aneeman Ex. 36:4 all the artisans who were engaged in the tasks of the sanctuary came, each from the task upon which he was engaged, &gt;&gt; #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @aneeman Ex. 36:3 They took over from Moses all the gifts that the Israelites had brought, to carry out the tasks connected with the service of the sanctuary. But when these continued to bring freewill offerings to him morning after morning, &gt;&gt; #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @aneeman Huh, I hadn't made that connection ‚Äî but we see later in the parsha that people were so intense about building the Mishkan that they had to be told to knock it off and not add anymore. #ParshaChat

@doctorscience Yes. I think that there may be both elements in play, especially in later theology.  #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ (I think in Biblical narrative, God learns. And I kind of find that framework more compelling than the philosophical ideal of divine omniscience.) #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ Another way I sometimes think of this is that God wasn't very experienced at being God in relationship to humans at that point. There's a limit to what can be accomplished with smiting, but maybe that's no obvious without experience? #ParshaChat
@doctorscience That's how I read why Aaron's sons died as the result of a ritual mistake. I'm not sure that's the only thing going on WRT God being somewhat concealed. #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ @ZacharyBraiterm @parshachat I think it looks like a punishment because the only time you'd die for doing religious incense wrong now is if a theocratic fundamentalist decided to kill you. But I think this is more like they were reckless at a nuclear power plant and got radiation poisoning. #ParshaChat
@Wonko_the_sane_ @ZacharyBraiterm @parshachat Yeah, I don't find this *remotely* acceptable if the assumption we're making is that it's God zapping them to punish them for Doing It Wrong. #ParshaChat
And within that context, I like that there's an example that illustrates that neither being the son of someone important nor being in a position of honor makes it ok to be reckless with life-or-death things you're responsible for. #ParshaChat

Because in the ancient world, people believed that sanctuaries had direct physical effects on the world and that they directing physically dangerous forces. #ParshaChat
I actually kind of appreciate that. I think it seems disproportionate if you're seeing ancient world sanctuaries as analogous to modern day sanctuaries, but I was taught that it makes more sense to analogize them to nuclear power plants. #ParshaChat https://t.co/qDUmrIfezT
A1 I feel like sometimes we tend to imagine God as infinitely receptive, in a way that I'm starting to suspect might be tied to the idea that the way to be a good/ideal person is to have no boundaries. #ParshaChat https://t.co/OimrDNps5X
A1 It kind of makes sense to me that God wouldn't want to be looked at too much. Or that "getting close to God" might not always actually be welcomed. #ParshaChat https://t.co/ZRSWHnXiDo
Q1 Increasingly, I think that some Jewish resistance to philosophical theology may be about respecting God's privacy. #ParshaChat https://t.co/ZRSWHnXiDo

@LidsRodney @sesmith Yes, and then if you try to talk about it, people are like: stop stigmatizing medications! mental health is as real as physical health! You wouldn't talk that way about insulin!
@BeccaRAlice @arielsobelle The usual upsurge in awfulness that happens whenever there's impeachment talk.
@LidsRodney @sesmith THERE IS LITERALLY A BLACK BOX WARNING.
@LidsRodney @sesmith WTF WHY WOULD YOU NOT TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THE RASH
@sesmith Or people who really want to be on hormones but can't tolerate them well or have medical contraindications. Like, I can't take estrogen-based birth control pills, and I'd assume there are also trans women who have bad reactions to estrogen ‚Äî and they're women.
@sesmith I also think there's a difference between not wanting something and not being able to get what you want, though. People who are choosing not to use medication are in a different position than people who keep trying and finding that nothing available works for them.
@sesmith Or therapy.
@sesmith That too.
@sesmith Like, for some crazy people there just flat out aren't any effective medications or any *safe* effective medications, and we need to stop telling people that means that they can't possibly survive. It can become self-fulfilling.
@sesmith Yes. Or "you'll die if you don't do this, so the risks don't matter".
@sesmith Yes ‚Äî and ‚Äî how do we talk about the life-and-death necessity of access to care without driving people to despair if they can't safely get the iconic care or it doesn't work for them?
@sesmith We're expected to either see things as too risky to be allowed or to pretend that there are no risks, we're not often allowed to evaluate the risks and make a decision about what we see as acceptable.
@sesmith Eg: Access to SSRIs is critically important for a lot of people, including people who need them long term - AND it's a problem that the risks of SSRIs are often not disclosed to people who doctors give them to.
@sesmith Yes. Or how do we talk about risks involved in treatment without validating scaremongering in ways that lead to denial of care?
@Baba_Lilith @sesmith Yes ‚Äî I wince when people say "young people don't belong in nursing homes", because while that's true, elders don't belong there either.
@sesmith Also: How do we make research actually useful for improving our care rather than a weapon wielded against us?
@Baba_Lilith @sesmith Yes ‚Äî and there are *some* unique aspects of pregnancy because of reproductive coercion, misogyny, and fetuses being seen as having more value than women. But the problem with those isn't medicalization, exactly.
@sesmith There's just way too much passing of the unperson ball.
@sesmith Like, I *agree* that the way pregnant people are treated is unacceptable and dehumanizing ‚Äî and I also think that the way everyone else in the hospital or elsewhere in the medical system is treated is unacceptable.
@sesmith Yes ‚Äî and I also see that a lot in the way feminists tend to talk about pregnancy in terms of "don't medicalize birth".
@maggietiede Disabled people are *also* fighting tooth and nail to reject care that others consider appropriate for us, though.
@sesmith Got it. I just wanted to make sure it was clear. And a roundtable about that would be AWESOME.
@sesmith I see a huge parallel between the way people see the medical system as owning the identity and agency of trans people and the way they see it as owning the identity and agency of disabled people. Does it seem parallel to you?	https://t.co/R32WYEa6YE
@sesmith I was trying to be clear about this by specifying "trans people who need ongoing medical care", but I'm not sure I succeeded, so I want to be explicit about this: It's not ok to invalidate someone's gender identity based on their medical choices.	https://t.co/CLvjU47q24
@sesmith Thank you for responding.
@emilyagras You don't need to delete it. And: I hate how people act like needing medical care means that you need a doctor's permission to know what your own gender is. Doctors are not the boss of that.
@maggietiede Thank you for responding. The reason I'm still not sure about that: Dealing with the medical system while disabled is also awful in ways that seem really similar to me?
RT @ConnieSchultz: i love this post by Tabitha King's husband. https://t.co/qIvynCuYbe

The military has a shortage of chaplains. I‚Äôm disqualified for at least four different reasons. So are a lot of clergypeople and ordination candidates I know.
Could we maybe have more solidarity in both directions, especially for people who are both? There are a lot of people who need ongoing medical care for a lot of different reasons. Why is it ok to stigmatize any of those reasons? Why is there a presumption that people can‚Äôt serve?

@bazelonbethany And there‚Äôs something wrong with the whole concept ‚Äî the background check system assumes that guns are safe for everyone except classes of undesirables who we can expect to identify in advance.
@bazelonbethany Point being, it‚Äôs not just the explicit mental disability category in the registry that discriminates against disabled people.
@bazelonbethany And incarceration in a mental institution is not actually an alternative to incarceration.

@bethingaround @pastinaco @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I see why there‚Äôs good reason to believe that it would help to raise the age for purchasing long guns to 21. And why banning sale and manufacture of new large capacity magazines could help.
@bethingaround @pastinaco @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I don‚Äôt see how ‚Äúkeep guns away from people who shouldn‚Äôt have them‚Äù is a realistic policy goal.
@bethingaround @pastinaco @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko Like ‚Äî the facts on the ground are that there are already a TON of guns privately owned in the US. It seems to me that mass confiscation is a nonstarter because it would be impossible to accomplish peacefully. So what *can* we do?
@bethingaround @pastinaco @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko That said, I wish that there was more of a harm reduction mindset in progressive approaches to gun regulation.
@bethingaround @pastinaco @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I don‚Äôt know though.

@bethingaround @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko And I worry about the implicit racism in holding up the background check system as a solution, both in terms of further criminalizing marginalized groups *and* in terms of taking the focus off the bigger threats.
@doctorscience Yes.
@bethingaround @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I also think there's a major elephant in the room: There are significant numbers of guns in the hands of white extremists who are willing to kill government agents in order to keep their guns. At some point, we have to deal with those groups.
@Lazytncajun43 @bethingaround @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I mean, I'm not saying that pistols are *safe*.
@bethingaround @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko Or, to give an example: According to the criminal background check system, it's safe for Kavanaugh to own a gun, but a woman who develops mental health problems after an assault and is committed involuntarily even once is considered dangerous.
@bethingaround @themadpolack @AdamParkhomenko I am wary of the efforts to identify a group of undesirables who are too dangerous to own guns. I think that implicitly just ends up coding poor people, disabled people, and people of color as dangerous and privileged people as safe.

.@JimLangevin argues that since such a high percentage of care is by provided by family members, we need to support caregivers in order to keep people with disabilities in the least restrictive and most integrated environment. #JDAD #JDAD19)
.@JimLangevin: Most care is provided by family members ‚Äî that's why I've working to reintroduce the care reauthorization act (not 100% sure this is the correct bill title; it's what the CART says but I feel like I heard something else). #JDAD #JDAD19

.@JimLangevin "Having disability and inclusion as civil rights ‚Äî we know what that means now. And so we need to continue to fight to ensure that the ADA stays strong and is not weakened." #JDAD #JDAD19
.@JimLangevin "Before ADA was passed, any accommodations, that were made, or something was accessible, was more of a courtesy, as opposed 	to a civil right." #JDAD #JDAD19
.@JimLangevin "And so I do remember vividly, what the world was like before 	ADA and how my life changed after ADA. it made a profound difference." #JDAD #JDAD19
.@JimLangevin had a disabling injury as a teenager when he was a police cadet and a police officer accidentally shot him. "My world changed and that was a full ten years before the ADA was passed. " #JDAD #JDAD19

@AlexAnotherOne There‚Äôs probably better explainers that go into details about how it‚Äôs implemented in practice with more caveats and nuance and stuff. But that‚Äôs the very short gist of it.

@ERWillms Yes. I‚Äôm not downplaying the significance of trauma here. I‚Äôm saying that I‚Äôm concerned about the ways people seem to be speaking about traumatized children without seeing them as having a future or being a part of their communities.
And I think we need to be REALLY clear about what disabling psychological injury means and what it doesn‚Äôt.		Trauma makes a lot of things harder. It does not make people any less human. We need to be careful to talk about traumatized children and adults with respect.
To be clear here: Trauma absolutely does have lasting consequences. People can and do end up with permanent disabilities as a result of trauma. Inflicting disabling injury on children is a horrific atrocity.

@IMissCarrie @challahwithjam And holding out for normalization is pretty damn destructive for disabled people, even when the condition involved is awful.

@JGavinSanders A3 Yes. I'm not sure what to do with the concept of idolatry, given that. Because I think there's something real and important captured in that concept and I also think the prohibited thing is *not* the thing that pagans do. #ParshaChat
@Roewoof @parshachat Interesting ‚Äî so you read it as them saying that it was an Egyptian god who took them out of Egypt? #ParshaChat
@RVCBard @JudaismUnbound That could be part of it. If so, what do you think might be done to mitigate that problem? #ParshaChat
@Roewoof @parshachat Ex. 32:8 They have been quick to turn aside from the way that I enjoined upon them. They have made themselves a molten calf and bowed low to it and sacrificed to it, saying: ‚ÄòThis is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!‚Äô‚Äù #ParshaChat
@Roewoof @parshachat A3 Particularly given that it wasn't actually Aaron who said that the Golden Calf was the god who took them out of Israel, that was something the people gathered around it did. #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @JGavinSanders egads yes, that. I can't breath in that kind of space. And that's not what I mean by art and beauty. #ParshaChat
@Roewoof @parshachat A3 I increasingly feel like it may have been less of a failure of faith and more of a failure of skill and competence. Especially given that he wasn't tell people to worship the golden calf, he was saying use it to worship God. #ParshaChat
@RVCBard @JudaismUnbound I don't know. I wish that I did. I suspect that it might have to do with a presumption that creativity separates one from the community. What do you think? #ParshaChat
@doctorscience A3 Some biblical studies context that helped me make more sense of this: golden calfs weren't used to represent gods in the ancient world, they were used to represent divine *thrones*. Gods rode them. I think Aaron was trying to use it as a redirect. #ParshaChat
@RVCBard @JudaismUnbound I don't think it has one single source ‚Äî I think there are a number of sources. I think that failures of clergy leadership, suspicion of creativity, internalized antisemitism, and growing income inequality are probably all significant contributing factors. #ParshaChat
@RVCBard I'm not sure, but that feels like the right question, and I have an intuition that valuing collaboration is part of it. I think there's an idea that creativity separates one from others that can become very self-fulfilling. #ParshaChat
A3 I think it's interesting that Aaron was trying *not* to give them another God to worship. When he set up the altar by the Golden Calf, he said "‚ÄúTomorrow shall be a festival of YHVH!‚Äù. He wanted it to be part of worshipping YHVH, not a competing alternative. #ParshaChat

@JGavinSanders @silbersd @parshachat Why? #ParshaChat

@JGavinSanders Say more about how that can be a distraction? (I'm wondering if we're understanding the concepts the same way.) #ParshaChat
@RVCBard @JudaismUnbound I'm thinking about another angle on this: A lot of communities on both the liberal and conservative end are intensely suspicious of the kind of artistic expertise cantors have and see it as inauthentic or contrary to meaning, prayer, and participation. #ParshaChat
@doctorscience @RVCBard Also things like user interface design and advertising and fashion and cars. #ParshaChat
@BluehairCoffee @JGavinSanders Is there also a ramp?

#PArshaChat https://t.co/fQWmWP78q1
I want to think about this more. I feel like maybe there's some internalized antisemitism in what we do and don't know how to value. Do we see Jewishness and value as in tension? #ParshaChat https://t.co/bhIedJc4zd
@doctorscience @RVCBard I'm not sure about that. I'm wondering if maybe creative work just gets overlooked as something requiring creativity when it's not in tension? #ParshaChat
A2 There's a lot of work that goes into making art possible beyond what is done by an artist. I feel like maybe the text is acknowledging that, and if so, that seems like an important thing to acknowledge. #ParshaChat
A2 I'm wondering what to make of "Ex. 31:6 Moreover, I have assigned to him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan..." I'd always thought Oholiab was one of the artists too, but now I'm wondering if his role may have been different. #ParshaChat
A2 We could approach the need to  incorporate accessibility requirements as a constraint that *facilitates* creativity and beauty rather than something that undermines it. #ParshaChat
A2 Ramps don't have to be ugly and utilitarian and neither do symbol supported materials or other things we do for the sake of access. It could be beautiful. We could approach it as art.  #ParshaChat
A2 Somewhat tangential, but I think we have a really problematic norm of not valuing artistic creativity as a component of accessibility. We tend to frame accessibility and aesthetics as in tension and I think it messes things up a lot.  #ParshaChat
@RVCBard @JudaismUnbound That's really interesting. My immediate thought is that we actually do have a lot of room for creativity shaping tradition, but that there's a taboo about acknowledging that and it tends to involve pretending that we're not creating something. #ParshaChat

@Roewoof @parshachat &gt;&gt;  Rituals are where something happens. Something changes. No one leaves a ritual action the same. Rituals are real."" #ParshaChat	That's from Caring Liturgies by Susan Marie Smith. It's a Christian book but there's a lot in it that applies to ritual more broadly.
@Roewoof @parshachat A1 That reminds me of a passage from one of my favorite books on ritual: "Ritual does not point to a reality, but it enacts a reality. Its symbols are not tokens or decorations, but loci of value and power. &gt;&gt;

@BluehairCoffee Yes, and ‚Äî maybe part of how you bring a community together is by valuing expertise and using expertise to build things that need building. #ParshaChat
This is making me notice something about the "Jews are awesome!!!" talking points in response to insecurity and how there are more about science and medicine than about art. Especially the kind of art that involves making things. #ParshaChat https://t.co/IieFLdutXf

@doctorscience A1 Oh wow. Now I'm imagining the Temple as having smelled strongly of cinnamon, cooking meat, and rotting leftovers. That's a disconcerting thought somehow. #ParshaChat
@JGavinSanders Yeah, I could see that! Especially since it's a fairly obsolete concept in Jewish contexts. It's hard to discuss the Torah sometimes when it's translated using words that aren't used much in Jewish space and have intense theological connotations in Christian space. #ParshaChat
@JGavinSanders I'll think about finding a clearer explanation we can talk about in a future week though, because I think it's relevant to a lot of stuff in the Torah. #ParshaChat
@JGavinSanders I'm not finding one. But it's a formal thing, and something similar (but not the same formulation) is used to formally recognize kings. #ParshaChat

@seriousky @isaiah_kb @gcampbellcohen @MrDane1982 I don't want it to be about antisemitism. I desperately wish that it wasn't. I have nothing positive to say about Bernie Sanders and I also think that 'fake Jew' is a dangerous racial slur and I'm terrified to see it used by someone I thought was a fellow traveler. Please listen.
@jonnyposting @isaiah_kb @MrDane1982 @midgebeanmeale @niccimow Wow. That is excruciatingly disappointing.
'Fake Jew' is a racial slur.
As a disabled Jewish woman, I am appalled that Bernie Sanders is running again. I have a zillion things to say about his many failures of solidarity ‚Äî and absolutely nothing he has done makes it remotely acceptable to use racial slurs like 'fake Jew'.
Things that should not have to be said: Calling Bernie Sanders a fake Jew is antisemitic and unacceptable.
@MrDane1982 Bernie Sanders is a racist and calling him a fake Jew is antisemitic and one does not justify the other.
@MrDane1982 I despise Bernie Sanders and I think the claims about antisemitism directed at him are almost entirely disingenuous and I also think that it's not remotely ok to call him a fake Jew. Please stop.
@MemeR I can't either and I am so sorry that is happening.

And just: All of my love and respect to Israelis who are fighting for democracy and justice in Israel. Thank you for everything you're doing.

@amgamble @MadMamaH And I don‚Äôt think that further criminalizing marginalized people will make me safer.
@amgamble @MadMamaH I live with a very non-hypothetical fear related to the availability of guns.
@amgamble @MadMamaH Sure ‚Äî and also a class that‚Äôs significantly under prosecuted.
@MadMamaH @amgamble I think this kind of approach actually plays into NRA ideology: They think that there's a violent underclass that we need to be able to shoot. The progressive version of that approach posits  a violent underclass of people we need to keep guns away from. That's not good enough.
@MadMamaH @amgamble Or, to put it another way: I'm way more afraid of Brett Kavanaugh than I am of trans women of color who have been convicted of sex work offenses, but he's not the one who this system says is too dangerous to own a gun.
@MadMamaH @amgamble And that's going to disproportionately fall on poor people and people of color. I just don't see a lot of justice or safety in constructing a huge group of marginalized people as dangerous criminals who we need to be protected from.
@MadMamaH @amgamble The current system makes it illegal for anyone who has ever been convicted of a crime punishable by a year or more of incarceration to possess a weapon. That constructs a *lot* of people as permanently stigmatized as dangerous criminals for no good reason.
@MadMamaH @amgamble Like, I'm all for banning high capacity magazines and such, but I have really serious reservations about the existing background check system and I'm not really on board with expanding its use.
@MadMamaH @amgamble "Commonsense gun policy" often includes a lot of really problematic things though, I think arising from the fact that common sense has a lot of implicit bias about what kinds of people are dangerous.

@loudpenitent Which is a problem because ExpressVote is insecure and because it‚Äôs obvious which ballots were voted by disabled people.
@loudpenitent Maryland uses ExpressVote for accessible voting and bubble sheet ballots for people who can hand mark them.

The fact that whoever wrote this doesn't see the Protection and Advocacy system or any other disability rights or human rights groups as having indispensable expertise is profoundly disturbing.
regulations, policy initiatives, and information gathering to ensure the broadest and most informed input in the administration of this Act. "
&gt;&gt; national associations, nationally recognized associations of experts, medical schools and academic health centers, consumer groups, and labor and business organizations in the formulation of guidelines, &gt;&gt;
Also, there's a consultation mandate, and it doesn't include disability or human rights either. Here's what it says "The Secretary shall consult with Federal agencies, Indian tribes and urban Indian health organizations, and private entities, such as professional societies, &gt;&gt;
There's a mandate to track and address healthcare disparities "on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, geography, or socioeconomic status". I think it's all kinds of telling that disability and chronic illness aren't on that list.
Also: The bill mandates a number of metrics for quality and efficiency oversight, but it has no mandate for oversight into whether people are being institutionalized or served in the community, and as far as I can tell, there's no mandated human rights oversight metrics at all.
Likewise things like wheelchair seating. People who don't have access to the assistive technology they need tend to end up in institutions or to end up unnecessarily homebound.
There is software that is only available on dedicated devices, and for some people, it's the only thing the works well. A closed formulary for price negotiation purposes is likely to have some pretty awful consequences.
Also, there can be some pretty dramatic price differences between assistive technology that looks similar to people who aren't closely familiar with it. Eg: An iPad with a communication app will cost a few hundred dollars, dedicated communication tablets can cost thousands.
You can't really do annual price negotiation for all approved assistive technology unless you have a formulary restricting what you will cover. This provision is going to cause major problems for people who need assistive technology.
The #M4A bill also implicitly has a formulary for assistive technology "(a) Negotiated Prices.‚ÄîThe prices to be paid for covered pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medically necessary assistive equipment shall be negotiated annually by the Secretary."

@odekul Yes. I understand that. (And we have similar problems in some places and the right wing is actively trying to make it much worse.)
@odekul I actually did understand that.
@odekul Does that make sense?
@odekul I think that the UK system is better than ours in many ways and I also think that it‚Äôs not universal healthcare, in part because of problems like that.
@odekul I think that the way people are being sanctioned for missing appointments is essentially punishing people for being sick and needing care, in ways that for some people can have cascading catastrophic health consequences.
@odekul Progressive Americans tend to believe that none of those problems exist in a significant way in other countries. I think it‚Äôs important in our healthcare debates to acknowledge that this isn‚Äôt true.
@odekul Some major issues with the US healthcare system: 1) around 9% of Americans don‚Äôt have insurance at all, 2) insurance doesn‚Äôt always cover enough things, 3) even when you have insurance, accessing care can have horrible financial consequences, 4) inequality in access to providers.
@odekul Ok. In order to explain that, I need to explain how progressive Americans believe that healthcare works in other countries. (To be clear about where I‚Äôm coming from, I‚Äôm progressive and I think our healthcare system is broken and in need of major reform.)
@odekul I understand that the UK has taxpayer funded health services and that a lot of things are covered. I can see why you think that your story is unrelated to the point I‚Äôm making. I disagree. Happy to explain why or to drop it.

#DIAtoday is essential, and it‚Äôs not enough. Disabled people are 1/5th of the population. We can, and must, do more than one thing at a time. #CripTheVote #FundMFP #FundIDEA #WeWontGoBack
If we send the message that only the DIA matters, politicians who are hostile to our rights in every other way can use it as a shield. They can cosponsor it knowing they won‚Äôt have to vote on it any time soon, and vote away our rights in bills that *are* pending now.
We‚Äôre on the menu in conversations about education reform. We‚Äôre on the menu in conversations about ‚Äòthe opioid crisis‚Äô. We‚Äôre on the menu in gun control advocacy. We‚Äôre on the menu in environmental advocacy. If we value our lives, we need to be at every table. #SuckItAbleism
For instance, we‚Äôre on the menu in a major way in healthcare reform efforts in the US. People want to cut costs by imposing restrictive formularies that would deny coverage for drugs disabled people need. We need to stop them from doing this.
As we say, if you‚Äôre not at the table, you‚Äôre on the menu. One implication: If #DIAtoday is the only table we‚Äôre at, we‚Äôre on every other menu. That‚Äôs dangerous. #CripTheVote
Disability affects everything; it needs to be part of every conversation, every human rights issue, and all policy advocacy.
More broadly speaking, we can‚Äôt limit disability rights legislative advocacy to disability-specific laws. If we want to normalize disability as a mainstream civil rights issue, it can‚Äôt just come up when the topic is disability. #CripTheVote
Money Follows the Person has been freeing people from institutions. Congress let it lapse. The bipartisan EMPOWER Care Act would reauthorize it. We can pass that law right now. And if we don‚Äôt pass it, people will stay trapped and die. #FundMFP #CripTheVote
Meanwhile, there are other opportunities to free some of our people that we need to be pursuing in parallel. We have the power to liberate thousands of people from institutions right now. We can‚Äôt leave them behind. They can‚Äôt wait for the grand vision.
The Disability Integration Act has transformative potential to free a lot of our people. When we eventually do pass the DIA, a lot of our people will be able to escape institutionalization ‚Äî and we won‚Äôt have freed everyone. Our fight will continue.
The effort to #FreeOurPeople is broader than the effort to pass the Disability Integration Act. And, in fact, our #DIAtoday advocacy has yet to free any of our people.
To be clear here, I want to pass the DIA. I‚Äôve been arrested advocating for the DIA, I‚Äôve put creativity into finding effective narratives for the DIA, and I expect to continue to do both. 		I also think that we need to be careful not to put all of our eggs in one basket.
As a disabled disability rights activist, I am concerned about the potential consequences of exclusive focus on the Disability Integration Act. #DIAtoday #CripTheVote #FreeOurPeople

@katzenclavier @devkenn @crippledscholar Exactly. It's messed up, it's not ok that we treat doctors this way, and it's also not ok that we treat people in much lower-paying and dangerous jobs this way.
If you're not prepared to deal with the fact that abuse doesn't always erase family ties, don't adopt and don't do foster care.
If you're not prepared to deal with the fact that a kid in your care who you love might not see you as their parent or might not see your family as their only family, don't adopt and don't do foster care.
Everyone comes from somewhere. Kids in the system didn't hatch from eggs. They were born and they get to decide how they feel about the relationships that involves. It's not ok for other people to try to erase that.
"Children without parents who just need a loving family" is not an accurate description of how most kids in the system see themselves, and it's really messed up how intensely that narrative is imposed on them.
@schanoes @coffeespoonie East coast cities have their own problems.
@coffeespoonie Eg: black women trauma therapists or LGBTQ trauma therapists are still unlikely to already understand disability issues, but they‚Äôre more likely to have related competence and be able to learn what you need them to know.
@coffeespoonie I‚Äôve pretty much given up at this point, but if you want to keep trying, one place to look is marginalized trauma therapists who specialize in populations that the system fails.
@coffeespoonie It depends on who you are. There are very few therapists who have preexisting competence in disability issues, and there are structural barriers to them coming to understand how badly the system and their colleagues are hurting disabled people.

If you let Republicans bait you into going after Jews in the wake of an antisemitic incident, you‚Äôre not fighting white supremacy, you‚Äôre acting as its agent.
The Republicans aren‚Äôt talking about antisemitism in order to protect Jews. They‚Äôre talking about antisemitism so that Jews can‚Äôt talk about antisemitism without being attacked.
The GOP is constantly inflaming their white supremacist base by talking about (((coastal elites))), the (((media))), and (((Hollywood)))). 		A party that does this is not a party that cares about Jews.
You know who *is* a significant part of the Republican base? Theocratic white supremacists who think that everything they hate about America is a Jewish conspiracy.
Jews are not a significant part of the Republican base. Jews are a tiny percentage of American population and the overwhelming majority of Jewish voters vote for Democrats.
You know how there are collective punishments where a commander punishes everyone *but* the person they want to hurt so that everyone will hate them and retaliate?		That‚Äôs pretty much what the GOP is doing to Jews right now.
@WhyteJaki @zelliej1 That‚Äôs really not how political advocacy works. You have to identify achievable goals.

Today I'm thinking about the courage it takes to be Jewish in politics in the face of centuries of antisemitic tropes that paint Jewish power as a corrupting and evil influence.
@angelenoesther @temasmith Or that we only have worth when we have no power.
@angelenoesther @temasmith And Jews are being told that we're not allowed to care about this, that we're only allowed to object to antisemitism if we fix every other form of bigotry first.
@angelenoesther @temasmith They're not just beign anti-black and anti-Muslim, they're also being antisemitic in ways that are endangering us.
You can't say that Jews need to show up and fight for justice without also saying that it's ok for Jews to be powerful.
@WalterLapp We can't pin this all on the GOP. The left is also punishing Jews for objecting. Look how Batya is being treated.

@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki But I don't want people who think of it as one to be ok with taking it away from disabled people.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki I don't regard gun ownership as a fundamental human right, to be clear.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki Especially when those things are things that half the country regards as a fundamental human right.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki I don't care that much about guns but I *do* care about not letting the government make lists of disabled people that are used to stop disabled people from doing things.
@WhyteJaki @Cal__Montgomery We're not pro-gun people. You're missing the point. This isn't about guns for us, it's about the consequences of framing disabled people as dangerous.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki Thank you for listening.
@WhyteJaki @Cal__Montgomery If you don't understand the role guns play in American culture, you're really not going to be able to understand how the conversation about guns and disability affects disabled Americans.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki There's a reason why there's a growing "ban the box" movement to outlaw asking "have you ever been convicted of a crime?" on job applications.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki Do we want to create a new system of life-long stigma and restrictions for young black people who are unjustly convicted of crimes? Because it seems to me that this would be an inevitable consequence of expanding the criminal background check system.
@Cal__Montgomery @WhyteJaki Like... There's no such thing as a system that checks for a history of violence. There are systems that can check for things like a history of criminal convictions or pending criminal charges or whatever.

@sweetpavement The problem with that I'm not sure is solvable is that in single-payer, the people deciding what has to be covered are the same as the people paying for it. There's a conflict of interest there.
@waxis I‚Äôm definitely in favor of a public option. Single payer, I am not sure about.
I think that you can see this in how popular formularies are among left wing proponents of single payer who would never in a zillion years show similar enthusiasm for allowing private insurers to cut costs by denying coverage for everything deemed to be too expensive.
One reason I‚Äôm not sure about single payer is that I think that it‚Äôs in some ways safer for disabled people if voters think ‚ÄúIf this law passes, corporations will have to pay for this‚Äù‚Äôthan ‚ÄúIf this law passes, we the taxpayers will have to pay for this‚Äù. https://t.co/gD34wfpiJv

@dattwell1 @iBreezy6 Thank you. It's really, really exhausting to face antisemitism from the left, and it gets more exhausting when people tweet graphic examples of rightwing antisemitism that I desperately wanted to stop and couldn't.
@AllysnCarpenter One thing I will say is that the NRA is an organization that is literally under criminal investigation for illegally funneling Russian money to the GOP, so it seems to me that it's obviously a fundamentally different group from AIPAC.

@Georgeberger And the disability community has a *massive* implicit sexism problem.
@Georgeberger Implicit bias in our communities is a huge problem regardless of what the original documents say.

@mutant_robot @redskyie And I also wonder why it is that people more often use photos of iron lung wards than photos of cemeteries to illustrate the importance of vaccination.
@mutant_robot @redskyie Yes. Iron lungs do not have a negative connotation for me at all. I don‚Äôt understand why assistive technology for breathing is so intensely stigmatized.
@mutant_robot @redskyie Iron lungs aren‚Äôt polio. Iron lungs are how paralytic polio became survivable. The assistive technology is not the disability.
@mutant_robot @redskyie It‚Äôs really interesting to me how most people seem to think of iron lungs as a symbol of polio and devastating illness. When that‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not how it looks to me at all.

@snomid @queer_i_am @Lollardfish People on the left are not at all kind to Jews who call out leftwing antisemitism.
@snomid @queer_i_am @Lollardfish Another thing that always happens when there's an antisemitic incident on the left is that progressive and leftist Jews who talk about it get told off by others on the left that it's bigoted and wrong for us to care about antisemitism on the left.
@WhiteyShlomoG @epicciuto How about not derailing?
I wish people yelling at me over the GOP's actions would understand that I do not, in fact, control the government.
@DavidN1027 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi The US-Israel relationship really doesn't have a lot to do with Zionism either. Americans by-and-large don't care about "the Jewish quest for a homeland".
Some day, I will be able to talk about a current antisemitic incident without people tweeting a lot of graphic examples of past antisemitic incidents into my mentions. Today is not that day. Neither was yesterday.
RT @1n1m1: Yeah, this. Stop asking us where we were when we were there, but you didn't notice because you weren't there. https://t.co/XKCej‚Ä¶
I know we've all heard centuries of talking points about Jews and power, but the truth is that Jews are vulnerable and that Jews are scared. When antisemitic incitement is normalized, things get really bad really fast. The right is attacking us. We need the left to defend us.
What I don't understand is why it is that the presence of Nazis in the GOP is supposed to make me find it *less* alarming when people on the left echo Nazi talking points about Jews. If this becomes acceptable among progressives, what do we have left?
Yes. I know that the GOP is allowing literal Nazis and white nationalists to run for office and remain in office. Yes, I know that antisemitic incitement killed 11 Jews this fall. Yes, I know that right wing antisemitic incitement is still leading to violent attacks on Jews.
Yes, I remember that antisemitic statement by a Republican that no one with the power to make it stop cared about. Yes. That one too. Yes. Also that one. I remember how terrifying it was, and is, to hear American politicians speak that way and face no consequences.
I was angry. The same progressive Jews who are speaking up now were speaking up then. But Jews are a tiny minority of the population and very few people cared what we had to say. If we were secretly controlling the government, we'd be stopping things like this. https://t.co/xpWz0hCe0Y
Or, to put it another way: Donald Trump's position on Israel absolutely *is* about theocratic white evangelicals. But @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi value the US-Israel relationship much more sincerely, and for reasons that have nothing to do with evangelical end times theology.
The "American politicians support Israel because of weird things evangelicals believe about end times" talking point is starting to bother me. I think it erases fundamental things about both Jewish Americans and the nature of the US-Israel relationship.

@frilar @Benignuman I think the congresswoman's tweets were antisemitic and unacceptable ‚Äî and so does the Democratic leadership. Where is the GOP leadership action in response to antisemitic comments made by Republicans?
@frilar @Benignuman I don't want that to be true, but to the best of my knowledge, it is, and I think we have a moral obligation to act accordingly.
@frilar @Benignuman Yes, exactly. There's a pattern here. I am not partisan for the sake of partisanship, I am partisan because the bad-faith actions of the GOP over the past few years are currently posing an existential threat to American democracy.
@Kathy_Elias I was there and... ugh, yes. There are reasons that I am not involved with them  anymore.
The off-the-record things that AIPAC does are different and often genuinely much less implicitly partisan.
And in our current political climate, both sides-ism favors the GOP and gives hate a platform.
PR AIPAC is the worst AIPAC, in significant part because PR AIPAC gives candidates for office a platform in a nonpartisan way, which means treating hate-filled GOP candidates with respect and honor that they don‚Äôt deserve.
I disagree with AIPAC on most recent policy issues they‚Äôve taken a public position on. 		I also really appreciate a lot of their organizing work facilitating constructive connections between Americans and Israelis.		AIPAC is complicated.

Stop seeking out antisemitic Muslims as a way to make your own antisemitism seem woke. 		Stop attributing your antisemitism to Muslims. It‚Äôs not solidarity. It‚Äôs further marginalization of both groups. Knock it off.
If you only ever listen to Muslim women when they‚Äôre saying something antisemitic, you‚Äôre telling on yourself about how you see both Jews and Muslims.
We need more Muslim women in politics and part of how we get there is by acknowledging that Muslim women are adult human beings rather than objects for you to use to work out your feelings about Jews.
A lot of y‚Äôall  treat Muslim women as completely invisible until they say something antisemitic that you want to either call out or defend. 		That nonsense is both antisemitic and Islamophobic and it needs to stop.
As a Jewish women, I would like to point out that Jewish and Muslim women have lots of things to say about lots of topics other than Israel and that maybe people should try listening once in a while.

@BilodeauMeg This thread (might) or might not, make it make a little bit more sense: https://t.co/ePvl7Z4Y8Z
@BilodeauMeg That's a really big and complicated question! People mean different things by that.
@BilodeauMeg Sure. :-)
@BilodeauMeg Another complicating factor is that a *lot* of antisemitic people say 'Zionists' when they mean 'Jews'.
@BilodeauMeg One complicating factor in understanding what the words mean is that what Zionism was originally advocating for was establishing the state of Israel ‚Äî but now Israel has existed for decades and so advocating for the creation of a Jewish state isn't really a thing anymore.
@BilodeauMeg Yes - totally fine to ask. Just wanted to get a sense of what you were asking.
ASL and CART are not interchangeable.
@BilodeauMeg Why do you ask?
@BilodeauMeg Judaism is a centuries-old religion; Zionism is a modern Jewish political movement that arose in response to European antisemitism.

Does anyone else cringe whenever a politician uses the word "cabal"?
@ComiCrissieB Agreed.
Every liberal Jew who objects to Congresswoman Omar's use of antisemitic tropes has had hasbara people come at us with ridiculous talking points. You don't need to tell us about the existence of bad-faith attempts to paint all criticism of Israel as antisemitic. We know.
@Rross10688 I was talking about the United States ‚Äî I don't know enough about European politics to comment.
@corindawn Got it ‚Äî I added a tweet clarifying what I meant.
Having stipulated these obvious facts: Left-wing antisemitism is also dangerous, and we need to take it seriously.
@ComiCrissieB I think that depends on context? Like, I think it's completely appropriate for members of congress to take a position on settlements. I also think it's completely inappropriate for non-Jews to center their identity on half-baked theories about Israel.
@corindawn Understood, and sorry about that! My point was that I'm really tired of people coming at me with "but Trump!" as though I'm somehow unaware of the dangers posed by rightwing antisemitism.
@corindawn I think @QueenMab87 put it really well in this thread:  https://t.co/MtLsJWQWt2
@TheLadyAye Agreed. Leftwing antisemitism is real and dangerous. White nationalism is an order of magnitude more dangerous.

@rachelvmckinnon I also think that the US government in general does not prioritize holding our allies accountable on human rights issues.
@rachelvmckinnon (That said, both Bushes criticized Israeli settlement policy.)
@rachelvmckinnon Because the GOP is a vehemently racist political party at this point. Why would they object to racism in Israel any more than they object to racism in the US?
@rachelvmckinnon I mean, of course it's not inherently antisemitic to criticize Israeli policy? Objecting to settlements is also not exactly a fringe position in US politics. Every recent president except for Trump has done that.
@shafieikeyvan @rachelvmckinnon I'm aware of the range of progressive voices within the Jewish community, thanks.
