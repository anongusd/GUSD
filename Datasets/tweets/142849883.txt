21 Savage has a family here in the United States. ICE is trying to take him away from them. They are trying to send a message: it does not matter how successful we are, they are coming for us and they will make our families suffer.		Their goal is to benefit white supremacy.
ICE uses our tax money to make life as difficult as possible for immigrants in this country.		When they arrest someone in upstate New York, they transport them as far as possible. Making it impossible for their families to visit. Just like Manuel Arpi, now detained in Alabama.
Just last week, Eduardo Samaniego was forced to sign his "voluntary departure" which allowed ICE to deport him and send him back to Mexico, a country he has not seen for over 10 years.
This is all connected, 21 Savage was arrested by ICE just like many other Black &amp; brown immigrants in the United States.		We have been fighting to defund the agencies responsible for targeting our people.		Congress should not give any more money to ICE or CBP. #DefundHate

The only source of joy that distracts Joselyn from her father is Florecita, a guinea pig that a friend gifted to the family to help them cope.
They asked if he was Manuel, and when he responded yes, they detained him.		Manuel‚Äôs family would drive 40 minutes to see him but when Manuel was shipped to a detention camp in Etowah County, AL, the family could no longer afford to see him.
Manuel Zhinin has a small family: his wife Maria and his 7 year old daughter, Joselyn, whose soccer games he never missed.		Manuel was detained in December 2017 when three ICE agents blocked him from driving to work. https://t.co/Z508I4leou

‚ÄúManuel is an excellent husband and exceptional father. He‚Äôs always spent time with our kids, whether it be fishing on Sundays or planting vegetables in the garden." -Marcia, wife of Manuel Armando Arpi
His detention has been a traumatic experience requiring his  son to receive therapy and antidepressants to cope. His children rarely leave their home or celebrate holidays because everything they do reminds them that they are without their dad.
Manuel Arpi is a father of two U.S. citizens and a member of Asuncion Church in the Hudson Valley of New York. He was detained by four undercover ICE agents who blocked his car on his way to work in November 2017 and has been in a detention camp in Etowah County, AL since then. https://t.co/iE6OyJCUqH

Congress should assure the American people that the government is open for good and should pass legislation to permanently protect immigrants with citizenship.
Immigrant communities are in grave danger because of Trump and the deportation force which has been growing year after year for decades. This crisis is real, while Trump‚Äôs border crisis is not.
But let's be clear, Trump‚Äôs border crisis is made up and he is toying with the lives of both federal workers and immigrants whom he held hostage for his racist agenda.
üö® JUST NOW: The longest government shutdown in history will temporarily be over and federal workers will finally be paid and back to work. #TrumpShutdown

There are 400,000 immigrants locked in detention camps across the country.		And when Donald Trump says he wants the Wall, what he really wants is more detention camps, more deportation agents and to wipe immigrant families out.
Are the same people who try to wipe out equality for LGBTQ people.		They are the same people who build prisons to lock up Black people.		Right now, there are 15,000 kids locked in cages at the border.		They are still there!
And together, WE are going to stop him! Because we know that the same white supremacists who are holding the government hostage to build their wall. Their monument to racism.		Those same white supremacists are the same people who tell women that we cannot control our own bodies.
Let's break this down, here at UWD keep things real. Donald Trump is a racist mad man.		His white supremacist views are a cancer that is eating away at the soul of our democracy.

‚ÄúTrump and Republicans must stop their blockade of real permanent protections and re-open the government now.‚Äú		#TrumpShutdown
‚ÄúWe will need to see the details but we are deeply skeptical that this is not just another trick to hurt even more immigrant families.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrump has killed every compromise to protect immigrant youth, demanding more detention camps and billions for the deportation force.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor months, Trump has tried to use our lives to get his Wall and increase his deportation agents to hurt immigrants.‚Äù
.@Grei_sa, UWD Deputy Executive Director: ‚ÄúTrump is the one who put us in danger by killing #TPS and #DACA and then blocking the #DreamAct to protect us with a pathway to citizenship.‚Äú
And after months of broken compromises and demands from the White House for extreme immigration changes that would hurt immigrant families.
The rumors come after Trump killed the #DACA and #TPS programs, putting millions of once protected immigrants in danger, after Trump killed the #DreamAct...
As immigrant youth in cities across the nation join the #WomensMarch to call for an end to the Trump shut down and to protect immigrants, rumors began circulating in Washington, DC that Trump may offer a new ‚Äúdeal‚Äù to get billions for his Wall and other unknown changes.

"In the last weeks, Trump has increased his theatrics to new heights to force taxpayers to build him a monument to racism along the southern border, and give his deportation force billions of dollars to build more detention camps and hunt down immigrant communities."
