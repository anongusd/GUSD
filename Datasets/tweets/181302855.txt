RT @_MarkWaller: Nagin: Visited Sen. Barack Obama, Mayor Daley's stadium suites at NFC game in Chicago. #Nagintrial
Trip to Chicago, said no biz talk. "We talked about the Saints. It wasn't business-oriented conversation at all" #nagintrial

Pickens, on $72k from 3F: "same admonishment the mayor was talking about?" Hatfield: "we were admonished not to take anything" #nagintrial

Hatfield: Nagin never asked her to do anything improper; Nagin "admonished us not to" take money from contractors #nagintrial
Hatfield: mayor had no say over firms that made it into the pool of contractors eligible for city work #nagintrial
RT @GordonRussell1: Unclear still how this worked under the "pool" system in which many firms were deemed qualified. #nagintrial

Evans: asked Nagin about 2005 trip to Jamaica, "He said nobody has paid for any of his trips to Jamaica" #nagintrial
Evans interviewed Nagin in March 09. Asked if he had accepted anything from St. Pierre, Nagin said no #nagintrial
Next up, Dan Evans. Jenkins' cross of every witness so far focused on blaming others. We'll see how that works with FBI agent #nagintrial
Stone Age never provided ownership docs. Then, third doc showed up reflecting Nagin owned 60% stake. That's 20, 40 and 60%.. #nagintrial
Nagin hit with ethics violation charges in 2010, for contracts with Home Depot #nagintrial
Two documents w/ different numbers: one said Nagin owned 20% and wife owned 20%, another said Nagin owned 40% #nagintrial

2004 exec order signed by Nagin gave Meffert power "to hire who you want to hire without having to go out for bid." #Nagintrial
Coman: "Did you begin accepting payments in exchange for favorable treatment?" Meffert: "I did." #Nagintrial
Bassam Mekari off the stand, up next: ex-Chief Technology Officer Gregory Meffert #Nagintrial
Jenk: "Did Nagin SAY he'd take care of you?" Mekari: "No" Coman: "Did he need to?" "No." Coman: "Did he take care of you?" "Yes" #Nagintrial
Mekari: Williams told me "you got to pay to play" #Nagintrial
Mekari says he lied to FBI even tho didn't want to, at first "wasn't aware of the severity of the issue" #Nagintrial
@ursinderoche I doubt it.. focus is on the alleged deeds, not political strategy. But if Nagin takes the stand, that's another story...
Coman asks Mekari, who got probation for bribing Nagin: "Did the payoffs to the mayor pay off?" "Yes" #Nagintrial
Mekari: initially didn't want to pay Nagin sons $10k after 3Fold got $1 million contract. "I knew something wasn't right" #Nagintrial.
RT @GordonRussell1: Mekari, Williams' fmr partner, essentially here to corroborate everything Williams already testified to. #nagintrial
Mekari: After Williams' meeting with Nagin's sons, Williams said "we have to put up money in the mayor's company…it'll help us" #Nagintrial
Next witness up: Bassam Mekari, Williams' biz partner at Three Fold Consultants #Nagintrial
Coman: "Did you deliver for the mayor?" Williams: "Yes." Coman: "Did he deliver for you?" Williams: "Yes." no further questions #Nagintrial
Jenkins going over Williams' plea agreement to try and poke holes in his cred. "It's the gov. that determines if you cooperated."#Nagintrial
Under questioning, Williams remains calm and sticks to his story: "I bribed the mayor" #Nagintrial
Williams, can't follow Jenkins' questioning about meeting with feds: "This is confusing." Jenkins: "Confusing about who you told a lie to?"
Williams: "The Nagin sons approached me…for $60k. I saw it as an opportunity to get more work. I gave them the money." #Nagintrial
Jenkins attacks Williams' credibility:  "We only have your word that [Nagin's son] sought you out, and nothing to support that?" #Nagintrial

#Nagintrial ends for the day. Rodney Williams back on the stand for cross-examination tomorrow morning.
Williams lied to FBI agents in 2010 re: bribes paid to Nagin. "I panicked…I said it was an investment. I didn't tell the truth." #Nagintrial
RT @RobertMcClendon: Coman: Why pay him $10,000? Williams: "Because we were just awarded a $1 million contract." #NaginTrial
Coman: "Bribe or investment?" Williams: "Paying a bribe. We decided to establish a shell company...as part of the coverup" #Nagintrial
Nagin told Williams he was "tapped out," told him he would "take care" of Williams if he invested in Nagin's company #Naginrial
Rodney Williams took Nagin on $800 fishing trip to try and win city contracts when Nagin first came into office, didn't work #Nagintrial
The government calls Rodney Williams of Three Fold Consultants, pleaded guilty to paying Nagin more than $72,000 for contracts #Nagintrial

Question #5 in David Warren trial: another about "willfulness," asked for an example of "bad purpose." Judge said can't give examples.
Judge says he doesn't know why the jury wants the tape measure, but is clearing the courtroom and hallway, in case jury room is too small
Refresher: prosecutor measured 66 feet between Warren and Glover
Q #3 from jury in Warren trial: Can we have the tape measure [used to demonstrate distance between Warren and Glover]. Judge answers yes.
Jurors ask attorneys for clarification on Warren's claim on location of truck Glover and Calloway drove to Algiers strip mall
