I wish you enough pain so that even the smallest of joys in life may appear bigger.		I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting.		I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess.		I wish you enough hellos to get you through the final good-bye
I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright no matter how grey the day may appear.		I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun even more.		I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive and everlasting.

No matter where you are in life, no matter what’s happening around you, start looking for more of God’s favor.
Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive. -Mat 21:22
When you have an attitude of faith, when you speak victory over your life, that’s when God will show up and do amazing things.- Joel Osteen-
Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we can't see.
Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.
