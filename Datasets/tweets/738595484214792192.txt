@JackPosobiec It's been confirmed by the right that sexual assault and rape is okay in this country. I bet you are thrilled. Now you don't have to hide.
Soooo, since @BrettKavanaugh is going to get confirmed does that mean it's okay to rape and assault women?	Well okay.
@SenatorCollins You are the reason that men like @realDonaldTrump thinks it's okay to assault women. You should have had your sisters back.

@pastormarkburns You do remember @realDonaldTrump was sued for not renting to blacks, accused 5 innocent Latinos and black teens of rape and murder, cheated his contractors to satisfy his greed, admitted to sexual assault, and you as a pastor is okay with that? Shame on you.
It breaks my heart when I see so called "Christians" justify adultery, rape, greed, hate, by supporting and defending @realDonaldTrump actions.
@Franklin_Graham How come we never had to go through this with any other president. @realDonaldTrump is a racist, merciless, xenophobe. The church should not support condone that kind of behavior.
@RealCandaceO @lisamurkowski What makes you think he's innocent? Where you there? The FBI only interviewed 9 out of dozens of witnesses.
@kanyewest I totally agree with you about amending the 13th amendment. Slavery is only used as punishment for blacks in the prison system. Slavery should be illegal period.
