Yes I hate me too. No need to unfollow. Going into airplane mode now
Smdh at people cheering on my flight at announcement @JetBlue is giving us for voucher 7hr delay. Literally the least they could do.
Pretty sure someone said this in a flashback montage in one of the Terminator movies @JNicholsonInDC @GabrielKNelson https://t.co/S1MypwOE5j
Could someone have a Vine of this ready by the time I land back in DC? https://t.co/Z2BKoivpP5
@JNicholsonInDC @AlexParkerDC @npnigro @GabrielKNelson Maybe better to help Detroit electrify than help SV give us robot chauffeurs
@AlexParkerDC @npnigro @GabrielKNelson realize I'm callous but would prefer to focus on existential threats as a matter of public policy
@AlexParkerDC @npnigro @GabrielKNelson lots of people for all kinds of unfair reasons. Doesn't mean you need to make a fedral case of it
@AlexParkerDC @npnigro @GabrielKNelson of more than 300 million people!!! Can't google bc boarding but I'd bet plenty else kills as many
@GabrielKNelson I see what you did there. Thankfully there won't be thousands of other planes within a few feet of us throughout the flight
@npnigro @GabrielKNelson in any case I've really enjoyed this but have to go bc it looks like my flight is finally boarding  (6hrs later)
@npnigro @GabrielKNelson highway mortality is maybe best case but that's a problem we've seemed to come to terms with as a society
@npnigro @GabrielKNelson not arguing robot cars wouldn't be great fwiw, just don't understand why it should be among top fed govt probs
@npnigro @GabrielKNelson as if a fleet of robot cars will take nothing to deploy
@npnigro @GabrielKNelson can't guarantee fewer deaths yet and current mortality hardly a crisis. Rest available w/o robots
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro I mean if we're talking about unrealistic public investment your solution already exists
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro fund transit (operated by *competent* humans (sorry wmata)) still not seeing market for robot cars
Yes! See uber, car2go (which also isn't great but at least on the right track). Don't need a robot driving me around https://t.co/zJg2gVkdSI
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro happy to have industry do whatever. Skeptical of federal intervention on behalf of robots w/o clear human benefit
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro still unconvinced. Let humans drive EVs. Resist the robot uprising
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro nothing has convinced me robots would be better than uber drivers in EVs, and my version doesn't destroy jobs
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro by the time automation is possible uber will be a more powerful political force than taxi drivers are now
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro and attention now is about w destined-to-go-nowhere budget requests so curious why the excitement (2/2)
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro obviously nothing is mutually exclusive but we are talking about a finite federal budget (1/?)
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro but I'm not even comparing to that. Shouldn't we decarbonize cars before worrying to teach robots to drive them?
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro 1M deaths on planet approaching 7B that's becoming uninhabitable for a lot of them
@GabrielKNelson @npnigro seems like there are plenty of more urgent and more easily solved problems that kill a lot more, no?
Just realized it's possible whoever is working the @JetBlue Twitter account actively sought out this vocation. Pray for him or her
@JetBlue seriously tho hope you're a lot more talented than me. It's a tough world out there. Not your fault first job is dealing with this
@JetBlue I'm stuck on the ground for another 90 minutes thanks to your bosses. Feel free to commiserate via DM
@JetBlue how old are you? Did you go to school for a career in communications? It doesn't get better than this. Find a new line of work
@JetBlue really $400 bc there are two of us. Guess help is too much to ask of the millennial you're paying minimum wage to watch Twitter
@JetBlue not that your incompetence was annoying enough but we're  also apparently due $200 https://t.co/vvuKBGKaZE
So, so glad I found a job early enough to avoid tweeting on behalf of a #brand @JetBlue (legit sorry for whoever is manning the account)
@JetBlue please go find a job in another field
@JetBlue yes exactly. See the initial tweet you're responding to
@JetBlue its flight 1098 tpa-&gt;dca ... Not that whatever poor intern manning the account on a holiday weekend could actually do anything
I mean come the f**k on, @JetBlue I've been angrily tweeting at you for three hours. #NeverAgain
@JetBlue you're not sorry
@JetBlue is such a shitty airline they can't even pay a 19-year-old intern to run their Twitter account on a weekend
The only nice thing is that @JetBlue flys to so few places that I'll actually be able to stick to this pledge
Sorry agin to everyone else. It's just that @JetBlue is this terrible. Feel free to unfollow me, but please never fly them
Food vouchers that you can't redeem for alcohol are nothing but a cruel joke. Thanks @JetBlue !! #NeverAgain

@samori8 @bradplumer thing is AV could theoretically cut trips but tough to see middle America adopt non-owned robot cars before EVs
@CostaSamaras @samori8 will be interested to see the results. Thanks at least for the intellectual stimulus while stuck at the airport
@samori8 @bradplumer seems like autonomy displaces ownership &amp; Uber which is fine but doesn't cut GHG alone
@CostaSamaras @bradplumer Ya I think robot cars are natural follow once we get EVs figured. Q is how to to eliminate car GHG ASAP
@bradplumer Ya that was my main point. Transpo is toughest nut to crack, &amp; focusing on robot cars risks missing main issue @CostaSamaras

@bradplumer In a population of 300+ million not sure this rises to the level, especially given how used to car crashes we are
@CostaSamaras not sure people will ever trust robots&gt;people on this front whatever the data.
@CostaSamaras see previous - why does it need to be robots driving EVs rather than people?
@CostaSamaras so wouldn't Uber EVs do the same while also creating jobs?
Unfollow now or get ready for at least four more hours of this until I take off
I get the move toward electrification but automation doesn't seem like it would do anything except put Uber drivers out of business
Random but serious question: What public policy problem do self-diving cars solve?
