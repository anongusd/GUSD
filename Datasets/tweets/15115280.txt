@lisakrstin The “registered independent” thing plays well in Vermont. Not so much in the rest of the country.
@WPDPenguin Obviously. He made a choice to hurt himself in 2016 by not releasing them. He would only have done if releasing them would have hurt him even more than not releasing them.
@JenSaunderson You don’t file for senate re-election five and a half years in advance without a good reason.
@KAMALAMODE Everyone (including the media) is afraid of his rabid base, and for good reason. They try to destroy anyone who dares question him.
@iancarty123 Why would he? Whatever he’s hiding could derail his Senate career.
Bernie Sanders knows he has zero chance of being the nominee. His base is fierce, but far more liberals hate him than love him. He’s only running in 2020 so he can raise money, then use it in his 2024 Senate campaign. We know this because he just filed to run for Senate in 2024.

@KatrokkJones Oh I don’t want that title. I had nothing to do with this person getting fired. You can blame the downfall of Snopes on the divorce of its cofounders a few years ago. It went straight to hell after that.

Snopes has finally fired the editor who spent all of 2017 obsessively trashing me in one bizarre interview after another. It’s about time. But now Snopes has no names on its masthead at all. No clue who’s writing these “fact checks” anymore. Zero accountability. Snopes is a joke.

@MrGribbles27 If he cheated on his taxes, he can be forced to repay it all (happened to Nixon). If he refuses to repay, his assets/buildings can be seized. Also, his tax returns could reveal his illegal foreign entanglements. They're a roadmap to exposing/enforcing his crimes.
Donald Trump's day so far:		- House Democrats are pulling his tax returns	- Deutsche Bank is cooperating	- Allen Weisselberg and Felix Sater testifying	- Everything is aligning against Trump	- He's tweeting about his golf course	- Trump is going to prison	- It's still only 1:45pm

@ECGTX @jozieozie The legal experts seem to think this is one is pretty cut-and-dry felony witness tampering. There are grey areas. But he zoomed right past them.
That's not to say Gaetz will magically be indicted/arrested by this time tomorrow. He won't be. This will go to a grand jury and all the other usual slow legal steps. But Gaetz is a goner. The latest Trump goon to mistakenly think he could get away with what Trump gets away with.
Let's be clear here: Trump can get away with these kinds of witness threats (for the moment) because he's hiding behind the protections of the presidency. But no such protections exist for congressmen. Gaetz will be indicted for this tweet, roughly as quickly as you or I would be

@mark_matranga Most of MSNBC’s nonsense comes in the daytime, I’ll give you that. As far as Rachel, she’s not necessarily a natural speaker. But she’s smarter and more insightful than I am, and I don’t say that about too many people on tv.
@poolshooter591 Suffice it to say that enough people fall for it, they come running to me every single day, asking me if it’s true. Half my inbox is about scary nonsense people heard on MSNBC.
@chichirobado Hmm.
@mark_matranga Maddow is so insightful at what she does, she doesn’t have to play the pundit gotcha games to keep people tuned in. Which is why I watch her.
@Widgett Whatever happened to Fairuza Balk?
@Pop3Pam Trump and Manafort are basically the same career criminal. Mueller found everything on Manafort in two years. 800 pages. He’s certainly found just as much on Trump.
@heyitsmeleeann The GOP knows that Trump will be blamed for those things and they won’t. They also know that war is different. It doesn’t magically end when Trump takes his inevitable fall.
@DjrellAZDelta That’s what happens when you’re backed into a corner with no good options. You pick one of the bad ones, and you end up worse for it.
@furiousfred19 Have you gotten a look at these House Democrats? They’re breathing fire. They’ve been in power for five minutes. They’re going to drop the hammer on him. They just have to take a moment and do it the right way, so it succeeds.
@nvromaloompa She’s high enough up the latter, she can find work. There’s always some third rate conservative think tank or lobbying firm that would hire her for her profile/connections alone. It’s the Trump White House peons that can’t find new jobs.
@SergeyKofanov McConnell got what he wanted out of Trump. McConnell is evil but he’s no dummy. If Trump falls now, not McConnell’s problem.
Mueller will take his big swing in X number of days/weeks. Pick a number. Anyone’s guess. You can spend that time fretting over whatever the TV pundits tell you to fret over, or you can spend that time fighting back against Trump’s overall agenda. I hope you choose the latter.

Donald Trump's most horrifying scandal yet https://t.co/5whsyLcZ6c
@KenobiCheated Is that even a thing? If it is, sounds like something Trump would do.
Also, Mueller isn’t “by the book” no matter how many times the TV pundits repeat that phrase. He’s used creative, aggressive measures to take down Enron and Gotti. He’s not a guy to turn in a report and go home. He always squarely targets the kingpins, and he’s always gotten them
Robert Mueller just flexed his muscles big-time... https://t.co/0rENmfbxgk
Be vigilant? Of course. Cower in fear that this idiot is somehow going to outsmart Robert Mueller? Come on. Trump is ONLY still in office because the GOP majority protected him for two years, meaning Mueller had to get there the long way. That’s done now. He’s exposed, vulnerable
Trump’s appointment of Barr is another random stab. The odds of it getting him anywhere? Tiny. Trump didn’t even know he had no attorney client privilege with White House lawyers. He has no idea how any of this works, and no desire/capacity to learn.
Trump’s last genius plan was to appoint Matt Whitaker and have him reinstate Berman at SDNY. Even an idiot like Whitaker knew that wasn’t possible. Trump apparently thought it was going to magically work. Trump has no idea what he’s doing.
Trump has zero remaining political muscle at this point. Republicans in Congress aren’t going to let him start a war, because they know it would quickly finish him off, and they don’t want to be stuck answering for it. Trump is just sitting there, wishing he had a good plan.
We don’t know what Mueller’s takedown will be, which is great, because it means Trump doesn’t either. But we can already see that it’ll be comprehensive, complex, and designed to leave Trump with zero good options. That’s how you get people to accept a bad outcome for them.
Mueller didn’t start farming out federal cases to SDNY because he was lazy. It’s part of his plan. And it’s not a coincidence that New York State is suddenly bringing its first state level charged. These things are all lining up for a reason.
If you want to know how this ends, ask yourself what kind of leverage a smart guy like Mueller, armed with proof of every crime Trump ever committed, has over a brute force bully like Trump who thinks two dimensionally.
If you’ve been paying actual attention to the course of the investigation, you know that no one on either side has any magic wands. Takedowns like this are a grind. They come down to five key factors: leverage, leverage, leverage, leverage, and leverage.
The pessimists, who tremble over imaginary things like Mueller’s report somehow not becoming public, are bad enough. The optimists are just as bad. They think Mueller’s report is a magic wand, and once it’s issued, Trump will immediately fall through a trap door.
Mueller just published 800 pages of criminal dirt on Manafort, who’s not even the primary target. Mueller surely has twice that much criminal dirt on Trump. He can bust it out any time he wants. Only reason he’d still be waiting a bit longer is to make it even more bulletproof.
We can’t afford to fall for this ratings-driven crap and become paralyzed in fear. There’s too much at stake. Of course Mueller’s report will reach the right hands. You want to worry? Ask yourself how that report can end up taking Trump down. But let go of the fictional TV drama.
Too many TV pundits treat political analysis like a soap opera script. They string along one cliffhanger forever until they’ve worn it out, so they let it go and immediately introduce another. It’s all about keeping you tuned in, which often requires inventing fictional suspense.
The real reason the New York District Attorney is finally going after Donald Trump: https://t.co/HLNq2bYBIg
Trendy new false narrative 2: “Mueller might not even find anything on Trump.” The media alone has already unearthed enough dirt on Trump to nail him on dozens of crimes. Mueller surely has more. If there somehow weren’t any dirt on Trump, Mueller would have quit a long time ago.
Trendy new false narrative 1: “Mueller’s report will end up in a drawer.” Sure, because Mueller is an idiot who hasn’t planned for anything, and doesn’t know how to work around villains. Oh wait, no, Mueller is the prosecutorial genius who outsmarted Enron and John Gotti.
Now that those two ratings-friendly false narratives have worn out their welcome, the media is using some new false narratives to keep you tuned in. They’re even more ridiculous this time around...
The media spent a year insisting Trump couldn’t be indicted, and Trump could just pardon everyone. This was never true. This week the media is finally admitting these things aren’t true. It was all about scaring you into staying tuned in...
Here comes Michael Cohen’s revenge on Donald Trump -https://t.co/hcyh7aNoRV
Robert Mueller would only have stuffed the evidence against Trump into today’s Manafort filing if he felt he had no better way to make it public. The absence of that today means Mueller is confident his report on Trump will become public. So let’s stop worrying about that part.

@frankzuber4 I feel like he should violate it if his own accord. You don’t want him arguing that he was baited into it by his adversaries.
@daqueenie2 Sounds about right
@n_wardupward That’s a fake account. Not him.
@ekgoldberg My guess would be that they’re volunteers who believe in his nutty cause, but you’d have to ask them.
@Lpg0827 People do seem to be placing their bets.
@JohnsonFree1 No consequences? The judge just told him he’s one false word away from going to jail.
@elaineATLHealth That’s a fake account. The real Roger Stone got banned from Twitter last year.
I never thought I’d see the day where Roger Stone has been legally barred from continuing to call me a “piece of human excrement” whenever I write about the criminal case against him.
@Why_Simply_Why Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Butina, etc, etc have already been brought to justice. Stone, Corsi, etc in process of going down. Trump has shown he has zero ability to stop the inevitable. They’re all going down, including him.
Michael Cohen goes for the triple play against Donald Trump: https://t.co/Bhtf9SRsyy
@blndvmpyr These things don’t come down to the letter of the guidelines, so much as they come down to who has what real-world leverage. Mueller has a million ways to get what he wants.
@NoDramaAnd I suspect Katyal is right.
@unafromaltoona1 Precisely. Nothing works that way. Barr doesn’t have a magic wand.
There is zero chance Barr will bury Robert Mueller’s report and magically get away with it.		There is zero chance Trump Jr and Kushner will magically get off the hook.		Nothing works that way.		Tune out the pundits peddling this doomsday fiction.		We have enough real worries.

@dwajkhul Lots of people see Amy as warm and approachable. Flamboyance is not the same thing as charisma.
@DyanSohn Biden helped lead the Obama charge on gay marriage etc. Let’s judge Biden based on his record in the Obama era and since, not his record of 20-30 years ago. People can legitimately evolve over the years.
@mwhite197290 Both. They’re both earmarked for prison. Just a matter of who gets indicted first.
@meatyorologist Love Swalwell. Still not sure he’s going to run.
@mrsklvy There’s literally zero chance of that.
@AussiePunter32 @PeteButtigieg I think Pete is going to be the real deal. He just feels like a 2028 guy to me, not a 2020 guy.
@CoreRiskWitness That was primarily Gillibrand. After she did what she did to Franken, the others like Harris had little choice but to go along with it.
@blaggerswagger From everything I’ve seen, Gabbard is even worse
If Robert Mueller really is concluding his work next week, he’ll not “winding down” or “wrapping up” or whatever minimalist term they’re using on TV. He’s gearing up to take down an illegitimate criminal President of the United States. He’ll be swinging a giant fucking hammer.

@therealbigdiehl Maybe you should watch them again. In full. Instead of the little clips they show these days, out of context, interspersed with a talking head insisting that Biden said/did things he never did.
@RachelMcGonagi1 Forgot him. Sorry. I like him a lot.
@justaguyithink At this stage the polls are based solely on past name recognition. They tell us nothing about viability for the current race. It'll be months before the polls tell us anything meaningful.
@davewaldorf Ha! You're unfollowed.
@wethefreople Agreed. I like him a lot. I forgot he was running. In fairness, so has everyone else.
@CorruptNSW @BetoORourke I don't think he's running. We'll see.
@ETSJ I would say the top five on this list are very much up for debate. I could have just listed all five of them as tied for first, but then people would have said I was copping out :-)
@Shane_Anthony94 Bye Felicia.
@resister_fister Howard Schultz is not running in the Democratic primary. Fuck him anyway.
@fastwriter2 I know right? His campaign has gone nowhere for some reason. Everyone including me keeps forgetting he's running, and I'm a fan. But it's early.
@TawandaNozama @HopeSprings10 That mindset is a good way to end up getting accidentally stuck with the worst possible 2020 nominee, and then lose the 2020 general election.
@BillyORobinson He's running in the Democratic primary, despite not being a Democrat. Then again, he always has been a cheater.
@derrickwlawson He's an obscure young mayor who probably isn't ready to be running for president, so he's not going to get too much coverage. If he's smart, he'll use the 2020 coverage he does get to position himself for a 2028 run.
@CheatinDonTrump Not on this planet he's not.
Robert Mueller has reached the finish line – or has he? https://t.co/SbdTzNWi87
@shiftypC Biden has the resume, demeanor, and international connections to be a great Secretary of State. But the job requires constant travel. Far greater physical duress than President. Not sure he’d want it?
@AnthonyNagatani @AndrewYangVFA I don’t think Yang has any chance at all, but I’ll listen to him.
@BillBertram1 I’m starting to suspect he’ll run for Texas Senate in 2020 instead of President.
Looks like I forgot Julian Castro, another one I like. In fairness, most people seem to have forgotten he’s running. We’ll see if he can change that.
@don_diito I don’t think Beto is running. My guess is he sets his sights on the Texas 2020 senate race, which he could very much win.
@aseibal I originally had even more horrible things ranked above her, but I ran out of characters
@20thgrader I thought Sweet Meteor of Death was running as a Republican.
@Jeremy0000ppppp Why would you put a good solid smart liberal like Booker in with those two turds?
@BenDavi53856005 The Democrats tend to unite behind the nominee just fine when the losing candidate is gracious about it (see 2008). It only goes wrong when the losing candidate is a lying toxic prick about it (see 2016).
@isabella_bee Precisely. Interpreting the numbers comes down largely to knowing what data to ignore.
@BostonJor This shit again?
@christopherlo20 That just tells us who the gamblers think is going to win. Tells us nothing about who the astute political observers think is going to win.

re: Amy Klobuchar - I love her and I feel like she should be higher. But I’m very liberal and she’s very moderate. She’s the least liberal of the top six names here. Harris and Warren are much more liberal. Not sure people realize Klobuchar is very moderate. So is Beto.
As far as the polls: I’m a numbers guy, but the polls tell us nothing right now. They’re based entirely on past name recognition. It’ll be several months before the polls tell us anything about 2020 viability.
@stsa7535 I know, right? Not the intention, but any time we can send the “Bernie or bust” folks packing, it’s a good day.
@therealbigdiehl Biden was not the villain in the Anita Hill debacle. Stop believing the lies the right wingers and loons of the left are peddling.

@Tedderman1 I’d very reluctantly take Bernie over Gabbard. You’re entitled to your opinion about how to rank the toxic waste dump.
@mastifmom You’re a complete idiot. Just sit this election out and stop spreading lies.
@mastifmom Nobody cares. Fuck Bernie.
@Brian_Chovanec I am Boot
@rrock83571156 Bernie proved in 2016 that he’s not capable of attracting a broad support base, and therefore not a viable candidate. Also, a lot of people just hate him because he’s an asshole to people.
@justaguyithink I have no interest in polls yet. They’re still based on prior name recognition. Polls will be important later, but not yet.
@20thgrader ?
Also: I forgot Sherrod Brown. Sorry. I love him.
@bitred Fair enough. I really like Klobuchar. But keep in mind she’s one of the least liberal / most moderate people running. Some people are going to be surprised by that once we get into the debates.
@ErikAndThoughts @mastifmom I like Pete a lot. He deserves to be heard.  But due to his lack of a track record and low profile, I don’t think he has a chance.

To answer the questions you’re asking: this is a tentative list at best. I have no idea yet who I’ll vote for. So many great candidates. I didn’t include Beto because I don’t think he’s running. Results not scientific. No loaves of bread were harmed in the making of this list.
Democratic 2020 field, ranked so far:		1) Kamala Harris		2) Joe Biden		3) Elizabeth Warren		4) Cory Booker		5) Amy Klobuchar		6) Kirtsen Gillibrand		7) Pete Buttigieg		8) A loaf of bread		9) An old boot		10) Bernie Sanders		11) A toxic waste dump		12) Tulsi Gabbard

If Rosenstein does end up being forced out, it'll be primarily the fault of the media. Trump kept feeding them a narrative they knew was fake, they kept running with it because it was good for ratings, and it weakened Rosenstein's ability to hang onto his job. Ratings over truth.

@lostalise After Bernie was eliminated, he spent four months attacking Hillary and spreading conspiracy theories. Then he finally endorsed her in weak fashion, and did very little campaigning for her.
@helman_jodi You just described most of the 2020 Democratic field.
Bernie has far less public support than last time, so he has literally zero chance of being the nominee this time. We’re going to actively get him until he cries mercy and drops out of the race, before he can spread too many lies about the rest of the Democratic field.
So if this dumbass wants to burn down the Democratic primary again, we’re going to cover him correctly. His tax returns. His published rape fantasy. His wife’s financial fraud. His 2016 chief strategist was a paid kremlin agent and pal of Manafort. Bernie will be vetted this time
Bernie’s remaining supporters are already giving away that his 2020 campaign will be an even bigger shitshow. They’re not talking issues. They’re just insisting that anyone who doesn’t worship him is a “neoliberal centrist corporate democrat establishment shill.” It’s just a cult
The whole problem in 2016 ended up being Bernie himself. He’s always been the problem. For forty years he’s been a toxic dumbass with zero accomplishments who just happens to be far-left. Then cable news turned him into a god for the sake of ratings.
Warren might have ended up being the nominee in 2016. Bernie was handed free 24/7 positive media coverage at every opportunity, but still managed to blow it, because he’s painfully unintelligent and he’s a dick. Almost anyone else in Bernie’s position would have been the nominee.
If Warren had run instead of Bernie 2016, she’d have done a damn good job of representing the far left. She’d also have been respectful to Hillary. If Warren lost the primary, she’d have quickly and full throatedly endorsed Hillary, and Trump would NOT be in power right now.
That’s around the time reasonable far-left people began distancing themselves from Bernie’s movement, which was dissolving into a toxic freak show of nihilists, masochists, con artists, anarchists, and Susan Sarandons. It no longer had anything to do with the issues or progress.
The Bernie 2016 campaign was initially a photocopy of the campaign Elizabeth Warren would have run, so it was all good. Then it became clear he was too dumb to understand most issues, his ego was toxic, and he eagerly embraced any nihilistic loon who blew smoke up his ass...
@__LittleBuddy Bernie is a dummy with a child’s understanding of the issues, and he’s too much of an asshole to get along with anyone. AOC is smart, understands the issues, gets along with her party when necessary, and has potential to do some good eventually. Bernie has no potential whatsoever
The main argument from Bernie’s remaining fans is that Hillary was a bad candidate, and Bernie would have won the general election. Uh, no. If Bernie got his ass kicked in a blowout by the supposedly weak Hillary, he would have gotten blown out even worse in the general election.
Hillary blew out Bernie by four million votes. It had nothing to do with superdelegates, the DNC, or the debate schedule. Those phony conspiracy theories were invented by the media for ratings, and Bernie played them up because he didn’t like losing. These are simply the facts.
@NinaMuller77 Not one word of that happened. Were you hallucinating? Were you on psychedelic drugs the whole time?
@Kevinacronin @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Every word of that is a laugh out loud lie.
@TorreyHam It’s word for word what he did in 2016.
This Donald Trump - Deutsche Bank subpoena story doesn't add up https://t.co/SC7YhmHCKk
Bernie Sanders is running for president again. His plan is to fall behind by millions of votes, push deranged conspiracy theories to explain why he’s losing, encourage the nihilists in his ranks, then drop out months after he’s been eliminated, and very weakly endorse the nominee
Donald Trump’s day so far:		- Totally incoherent meltdown	- Thinks California is a city	- “I never called his wife a loser”	- Misspells “where”	- Judge schedules hearing on revoking Roger Stone’s bail	- Stone is going to prison 	- Trump is going to prison	- It’s still only noon
What’s remarkable is hearing from all the former Bernie Sanders supporters who, despite still believing in his platform, have simply had enough of his shit.

@resistThisShit She resigned one day after she got caught up in an ethics scandal.
No way did Heather Nauert withdraw her UN Ambassador nomination in a mad dash on a Saturday night, simply because she once illegally used an immigrant nanny. In the Trump era, something so comparatively small wouldn't sink a confirmation. She must have an UGLY scandal coming out.

@rosiec754d The obstruction committed from the podium is the underlying crime. That ship has sailed. If she also lied to Mueller, it just increases the odds of a conviction.

@derekrucker5 Crucial story, but waiting for the other shoe to drop. Kaep held all the cards in that suit, so why did he decide to settle? Why right now? Is he about to sign with the Ravens? There has to be more to this.

Bill Weld is entering the 2020 republican primary race for president because he knows Trump will have been ousted by then, and it'll be up for grabs. Yet the media is hilariously pushing the more ratings-friendly false narrative that Weld is seeking to "challenge Trump in 2020."

@IBabbleOnAndOn But I will say that he’ll be ousted / charged / indicted / etc much sooner than he’ll go to prison. That’s just the way the criminal justice system works. A year from now he could be ousted, arrested, and out on bail while awaiting trial.
@IBabbleOnAndOn Thanks! I have no idea when he’ll go to prison. That’s a complicated enough process even when the criminal involved isn’t in the Oval Office. Look at the timetable for Flynn/Cohen etc. Ultimately at the mercy of court proceedings in the end.
Donald Trump’s day so far		- Declares a national emergency then goes on vacation	- The only “national emergency” is the one speaking in the rose garden	- This stunt will get him $0	- It’s to distract from the fact that he caved	- Trump will get prison walls	- It’s still only 11am

Donald Trump caved again today with a budget deal that included $0 for his wall. Now he’s trying to save face with his base by declaring a “national emergency” that’ll get struck down in court and will ultimately produce $0 for his wall. Let him try it. It can only hurt him.

No, Trump’s approval rating has NOT suddenly climbed to 44%. As usual, cable news is quoting one outlier poll, while ignoring the polling averages, to create the false appearance of movement when there is none. Cable news is in bullshit overdrive this week. Turn that shit off.

@lisap_tweedy Then we’ll stop him in court :-)
No, the Democrats haven’t “caved.” Before Trump shut the government down, he had $1.6 billion available for fencing. Now the Democrats have reduced his fencing budget to $1.3 billion. They’re taking existing fence money away as punishment for his shutdown. Still $0 for his wall.

In fact today’s nonsense report may lull Trump into a false sense of security, making him less likely to take drastic measures to try to screw with Mueller. My guess: this is why the democrats on the committee are keeping fairly quiet about the BS nature of this report.
Trump can run his mouth about this report all he wants, and it won’t change a thing. Just as the Nunes-controlled House Intel Commmittee report had zero impact last year when it “exonerated” everyone in Trump’s orbit.

It’s like saying “we looked in the freezer and there was no mayonnaise there, so we found no evidence of mayonnaise in this kitchen.” While purposely deciding not to look in the refrigerator, because they didn’t want to find it.
To be clear, this Senate Intel Committee report isn’t outright lying. It’s basically just saying that no one came into the hearings and outright confessed. It’s purposely ignoring the public evidence, and also ignoring the findings/convictions from Mueller’s court trials.
I don’t give a damn what the GOP-controlled Senate Intel Commitee says in a report. Public evidence alone proves there was coordinated sustained collusion between the Trump family/campaign and Russia. It’ll all come out soon. Which is why the GOP put out this bullshit in advance.

So whether Elizabeth Warren is your favorite 2020 candidate or not, you’ve got to have her back on this. You can’t let CNN and MSNBC and others crap all over her for daring to speak the factually supported truth in a way that offends their for-profit business model.
One CNN pundit just said Warren talking about Trump going to prison is the same as Trump talking about Hillary going to prison. Bullshit. Hillary was never facing any criminal liability. Trump has been accused of multiple felonies by SDNY. He WILL BE ARRESTED once he’s ousted.
Just as the major media outlets punished me for getting out ahead of whatever narrative they thought was the most ratings-friendly at the time, they’re punishing Elizabeth Warren for doing the same thing. Fortunately, she doesn’t give a shit what CNN and MSNBC try to do to her.
The mainstream media said horrible things about me in early 2017 because I was getting out ahead of them on the Trump-Russia stuff. The facts were there, but the media wasn’t done milking other ratings-friendly narratives first.
It’s not that CNN and MSNBC necessarily even want Trump to run in 2020. It’s that for now, they want to be able to milk the “Democrats vs Trump in 2020” narrative for ratings. It’s much harder to get ratings right now out of “Democrats vs Unknown Republican in 2020.”
Elizabeth Warren is factually correct: Trump is far more likely to be in prison by 2020, than to be running in 2020. Cable news pundits are crapping all over her for saying it, because she’s stepping on their ratings-friendly narrative about Democrats vs Trump in 2020.

@SimianGiudice @realDonaldTrump @HoarseWisperer @HoarseWisperer has us blocked, unfortunately. No idea why.
@realDonaldTrump Wait, you’re bragging that you’re “generally working” during the hours you’re supposed to be working? It’s not true, but even if it were, it would be nothing to brag about. Literally everyone with a job works harder than you do. Also you’re going to prison https://t.co/huHvVtSANf
Donald Trump's most humiliating moment yet https://t.co/hyWh1cyLF5
@PatenaudePaul Damn right
I’m so proud that Amy Klobuchar follows Palmer Report on Twitter 😁 https://t.co/PJwlqnefzf

Donald Trump’s day so far:		- Michelle Obama shows up and owns the #GRAMMYS	- Trump probably thinks it’s spelled #GRAMMMYS	- Trump still hasn’t deleted “muderers”	- Maybe he’s too busy eating a “hamberder”	- Elizabeth Warren says Trump is going to prison	- It’s still only 11pm

Maybe Donald Trump hates the “muderers” because they stole all his “hamberders” amid “global waming.” https://t.co/d8I8YvmSVl

Amy Klobuchar gave a speech today in the snow. Donald Trump doesn't know how an umbrella works.
@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock YOU ARE THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY, YOU FILTHY LOSER! https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump It's been three hours and this tweet from the President of the United States still says "muderers" and it still hasn't been deleted. https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump @CNN BLOW IT OUT YOUR PIE HOLE, YOU DROOLING ANIMAL! https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump Donald, you don't even have a 50% approval rating within your own family! https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump No one believes the Rasmussen poll, outside the voices in your head. https://t.co/UqNerhQma0

@realDonaldTrump @CNN In his last tweet, Trump made up the word "muderers" and now he's managed to come up with something even more incoherent. What the hell does this tweet even mean? https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Are you asking CNN if it believes you tweet? What the fuck is wrong with you? https://t.co/UqNerhQma0

@realDonaldTrump What the hell is a "muderer"?????https://t.co/UqNerhQma0
@realDonaldTrump Well, considering you've murdered immigrant children, and you were apparently in on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, you might not be one to talk about murderers. https://t.co/sb86blwL1o
@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock You're going to prison, you stupid traitorous weirdo. The only national emergency here is you. https://t.co/sb86blwL1o
Donald Trump Jr. has no idea what’s about to hit him: https://t.co/5fbDNxzop8
@PatriciaDiane8 @Mackeyser He’s one of those self righteous lunatics who dishonestly attacks the Democratic frontrunners because he mistakenly thinks it makes him look cool. Fuckers like him can rot.
@Mackeyser Fuck you.
