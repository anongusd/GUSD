@ChrisCuomo It is appreciated. He needs to be called out more often firmly but polite and most of all directly.
@NanWalton4 19 is that good that I got that high or bad?
@realDonaldTrump I always have to double check, if its your account or a parody. Because I cant imagine that the President of the United states. Would write and present himself and the country, as a two bit mobster. Not capable of holding an ounce of integrity or having a shred of character.

@_EthanGrey @brianschatz I think she is the smartest of all the candidate. As much as I hate it, the election comes down to a popularity contest with a lot of people, I just worry she wont be able to win that. Some of our early great presidents would never make it in a modern election. Ie Maddison,Adams.
@brianschatz That's hard, I would go with Booker, I just think he is the most genuine, he has literally saved people from a burning house. Also like Harris and Biden just worried about his age and so much history. Beto too, he just has so much momentum he could slingshot to the front.

@RealSkipBayless @undisputed And there were times the Pat's were too. It was a pretty fair game.
@MikeGiardi There was alot of grabbing on both sides. They let them play rough otherwise the game would of took 8 hours.
@MarkDanielsPJ Yeah no one else gi por get open or hold on. He gave them plenty of chances. Until they need to put up a TD.
@RapSheet He going to be coaching Miami, he knows it's his last super bowl.

@Fred_Kirsch Hey Fred what you think about Slater being the unsung hero of the game. He had his best game of his I've seen in years. Crucial on the punt returns. Theres a lot of great players from the game that will get deserved credit. But cant throw away all those downings. what u say?
@KassyDillon @realyosefstein Hey I'll take It!

@StormResist how many soldiers that are not yet citizens in the Army are allowed to meet with him? I guessing not to many.
@Markonair @MollyJongFast It does get cold there.
@MollyJongFast How many non US citizen soldiers got to meet him. The whole thing is a pr stunt. Troops get told what they can and cant say. Trust me it's not much. Bush and Obama actually cared about the troops not this coward.
@markknoller @tamarakeithNPR What a damn coward @realDonaldTrump troops dont want you there. You know they get told what they can and cant say right. Maybe if you brought your daughters the troops would atleast be interested. @IvankaTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @TiffanyATrump you three can put on a show for them.
@PressSec @ArmyTimes You know damn well he doesnt care about the troops. Not like the last to presidents. After 2 years he had to be shamed into it. Shame on you @PressSec trying to make people think he does.
@ArmyTimes This POTUS doesnt give a shit about the troops. The last do did. Hes going there and just campaigning because hes losing troop and veterans vote. I wished he cared  it he doesnt.
@PressSec @ArmyTimes Just a pr stunt nothing more. Bush and Obama cared. I wonder if theres any non US citizen soldier there, that are allowed to meet him?
@starsandstripes I've meet a President in Iraq who cares about the troops. Not this guy. I wish he cared but he doesnt
@MSNBC How many non citizen soldiers are allowed to meet him?
@krassenstein I wonder if there any non US citizens soldier that are there, are allowed to greet him? I wish we had a President that cared about our troops
@markknoller Mandatory POTUS meet and greet. You can say this or this. You can only answer this.
@markknoller It's a pr stunt. If it was really a secure meeting why is his wife there? Bush &amp; Obama cared he does not. @WhiteHouse
@ananavarro Glad to see months of being shamed and saying he was sad to be alone, lead him to finally visit the troops. Bush and Obama knew how to support the troops not this guy.
@Cynthiakanders2 @claudiascorr @thehill You must be if you think he cares an ounce above what he is made to to he doesnt Care about us. I've been in those visits in Iraq, they are told what they have to say and what they cant say and told how the need to act.
@thehill It's sad it took two years and being shamed to go. Not even on Christmas he had to many tweets to send @realDonaldTrump your a fraud if you cared about them, this would of been your 5th time there. Obama and Bush knew how to support us you do not.
@nypost @OpGratitude To late yo matter. His action have not supported the troops. He says it alot but doesnt actually help them.
@KJLuton @breaking9111 They get told before he gets there what to say and what there aloud to answer with. They are handpicked who he meets trusted be I've had to it before. It's a total pr stunt.

I dont play fantasy I dont care what obj does for the giants or how many yards he has. Hes not on the Patriots  looks was he did good. I wish he was still here. Done.
@money_bags222 It doesnt matter if he is top 5 or top 20 if he can open up the field and make the  other team, double him at times hes a top one receiver in my eyes. I dont care what other teams are doing and how they play, when it comes down to it.I care what the Patriots players are doing.
@money_bags222 @patscap The difference is all those other WR were not already in the door. Cooks is a 1k yard receiver.  And we dont have one. He would have made a huge difference and DBs on the other team would treat him as a 10 WR.

@PistolPetespony @breaking9111 I think your right I think they did pass something for vets now that you mentioned it.
@breaking9111 As a veteran this makes me worried.
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse You as well ma'am.
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse When he was campaigning I initially like him then I educated myself. You should too.
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse Into action. He was probably try to help the attack in Sweden he went on and on about.... Guess what they were never attacked. Either that or he is busy taking Findland.
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse The DOD increase was barely 1% higher then projected. Actions speak louder then words. TheVA program he sign into law. Is so broken, providers and the VA have know idea how to use it. I have a stack of Bill's and creditors after me now. Regarding the great law he signed
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse Cavet, I forgot the recently criticizing the whole armed forces and there commander. For not catching OBL sooner! That's things our enemies say about our, yours and my military. He is a traitor to our military. Just cause says,"oh support our troops I love them". Hes done nothing
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse You sound dumb how can I ever know what it is like to walk in the President shoes, but there are living Presidents on both sides that think he is destroying our. Yours and my, country.
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse Trump never walked in my Army boots. He can degrade war heroes. He says his joke of a military academy, was harder then the military. John Kelly and the chairman of the joint chief of staff can pay respect to WWII KIA's but cadet bone spurs can't?
@BobbittPaula @WhiteHouse Luck for me"." I don"' ' "t care about your opinion. Also"," were was I yelling"?" In regards to my grammAr you might want to spell words right yourself"."

@JumboHart I was nervous, until I listen to some Vikings radio. There just as worried as the Pat's are. Somtimes just listen to different patriot podcast  about what they have to do to win, and I'm like shit maybe we wont win. Pat's 34-28
