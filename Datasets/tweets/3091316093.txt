"For all these reasons, I voted against this inadequate deal...[&amp;] I’m working hard to bring new leadership to Washington. We can do better, and I'm confident that had this deal failed, we would've moved closer to addressing the many challenges our nation faces. That is our job."
"What Democrats are asking from @SpeakerRyan is so simple: Just do your job and allow the House of Representatives to vote on an immigration plan. Vote how you want, but give us that chance. Give these innocent kids that chance. It’s the very least we should do.
"Yesterday, even Secretary Mattis, President Trump’s own Secretary of Defense, came out in support of DREAMers in our military, promising they won’t get deported. If someone inside the Trump Administration can stand strong, so should we.
"These innocent kids grew up in America, only know this country, and deserve some certainty for their futures. They serve in our military and are our kids’ friends in school. They, too, deserve a chance at the American Dream.
"And don’t sell America short – don’t think for a second that we can’t do these things and also take care of DREAMers, whom overwhelming majorities of Americans want to support.
"This is why the Republican tax cut for the rich is so dangerous for us all: it triples the deficit. And we can’t afford that. This deal makes it even worse.
"A good deal invests in our future. At times like this, most talk focuses on government spending. But equally important is the other half of the equation because we ultimately can’t pay our troops, pay our Medicare bills, and invest in our future without the funds to do so.
"A good deal supports our troops. As general after general has told us, short-term deals hobble our Pentagon planners &amp; endanger our military. Only with a predictable budget, that is adequately funded, can we make investments in our troops &amp; technology to meet the latest threats.
"Of course most Americans don’t have stocks, but rely on all the other investments we make: in education, health care, and in our local communities, especially after natural disasters. These things must be adequately funded.
"A good deal supports our economy. Just look at the reaction of the stock market over the past week as Republicans careened towards another shutdown.
"Rather than play politics with funding our government, pitting one group against another, we should make strong investments in our future.
"I voted against the latest Continuing Resolution to fund the government because it shortchanged all the things we should be coming together, as both Democrats and Republicans, to accomplish for the people we represent.
@sethmoulton #BudgetDeal statement:	Budgeting month to month and governing crisis to crisis is no way to run anything, let alone the United States of America. Republican leadership, if you can even call it that right now, is an embarrassment. America is better than this.

In 2018, our community health centers in #MA6 will lose 70% of their funding if Congress can't #fixthecliff. This means 1000s lose access to medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment for our neighbors while the top 1% get trillions of dollars in tax breaks.

@sethmoulton We have lived through too many massacres - and at this rate -  I guarantee we will live through more. Let’s stop this nonsense and work together on common sense solutions the majority of Americans want.
@sethmoulton We know there are bipartisan bills that will reduce gun deaths, including my bill to ban #bumpstocks.
@sethmoulton Republican leadership is pushing a bill with blood money from the NRA that will create a race to the bottom, where states with the weakest concealed carry requirements will rewrite laws for everyone else.
HAPPENING NOW: @sethmoulton speaking on the House floor - calling for common sense solutions to end gun violence	https://t.co/7161VMEbJ2
@dwarfparatri @sethmoulton @petersagal @MVSRuns John - please send up a direct message. Would love to schedule the run!
#HR38 ends current law that prohibits concealed carry of loaded firearms in schools zones by individuals not licensed in that state. Stand with @AFTunion and #OpposeCCR. https://t.co/Y5R2qs9w2l
It gravely undermines effective state laws governing carrying concealed firearms. I stand with our law enforcement officers, State Attnys, and mayors tasked with protecting us in opposition to #HR38. https://t.co/t5tZ2kNfX8
Congress owes it to the victims of senseless tragedies and their families to debate and vote on bipartisan, common sense proposals to help prevent gun violence. Unfortunately, #HR38 would accomplish the exact opposite.

"If you’re willing to put your life on the line, we want you to be able to serve our country. Sad day for civil rights." - @sethmoulton https://t.co/ov11EPyFKG
@sethmoulton .@sethmoulton: That amendment was voted down by all Democrats, and a number of Republicans who crossed the aisle.
@sethmoulton "A Congresswoman proposed an amendment to do exactly what the President is saying. Ultimately, civil rights prevailed."
@sethmoulton .@sethmoulton: The #transgender issue came up for debate on the Armed Services Committee and then before the entire House.
@sethmoulton "Back in the 1950’s there was a big debate about whether African Americans should have equal rights to serve in the military."
.@sethmoulton: If anyone wants to serve the country–is willing to put his or her life on the line for our country–then we should allow that.

Romneycare wasn’t perfect, but Republicans + Democrats worked together to improve it in key ways. #bipartisanship #thewayitshouldbe
Another Republican in MA, Mitt Romney, worked with Democrats to create the nation’s first system to provide affordable, quality health care.
You know who said that? Not @sethmoulton. Our Republican @MassGovernor, Charlie Baker. Because health care coverage should not be partisan.

#ACA covered costs for her, her donor, and her after-care. She's still recovering &amp; she wouldn't be alive without the Affordable Care Act.
She lost private insurance and didn't know how it would be possible to get the surgery she needed.
Deb from Beverly learned that she had a life-threatening autoimmune disease only curable with a liver transplant.
"We're grateful that advanced medicine kept her alive, but I'm getting older. Who will ensure that she gets care she needs when I'm gone?"
"It's so difficult to be the parent of a child w/special needs and worry about their care as you're getting older."
"My daughter was born w/a heart condition. She's 30 now &amp; has had a stroke and multiple heart surgeries, but is still able to work pt time."
In that time, she has been able to start a nonprofit that sells art created by homeless artists.
The #ACA helped Stephanie get coverage under her parents' insurance with a pre-existing condition.
Katherine got the career experience she needed thanks to #ACA: she stayed on her parents' health insurance while working at a start-up.
"In addition to not being compassionate, it is economically unsound not to treat people who can be cured." #ACA
Once her health improved, she still struggled to get coverage because her illness was a pre-existing condition. The #ACA changed that.
Before #ACA, Kathleen battled depression, was unable to get a job, and therefore couldn't get employer-sponsored coverage.
"My newborn son is covered under the #ACA." Without it, Fatima doesn't know how she would be able to get care for her infant.
Fatima, student at NSCC, was pregnant when she came to the U.S. 3 years ago. "I was able to get coverage thru college, but not my son."
Kate owns a small business w/her husband. "Under Romneycare, our insurance premiums had gone up to $20,000." After #ACA, that fell in half.
"Before #ACA, 40% of patients at Lynn Community Health Center had no insurance. After ACA, that's down below 15%." - Lori Berry, dir. LCHC
First up: a round table at the Lynn Community Health Center #ACA https://t.co/jfb8Fjkb6O
Today, @sethmoulton will be listening to constituents about how their lives are impacted by the #AffordableCareAct. Follow to hear stories!
