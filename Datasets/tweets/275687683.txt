We can do more for our education system - that includes paying our teachers a competitive wage and investing in pre-k. This is not Democratic agenda - it's a working families agenda! #HoodForGovernor
To attract new businesses to Mississippi, we need a well-trained workforce. We must expand job training and apprenticeship programs at our community colleges and technical schools. #HoodForGovernor
We've refused, because of politics, $1.2B in federal healthcare funding. That's because of our current leadership. We've lost 4 rural hospitals because of this. Can you imagine if we had accepted that $1.2B? #HoodForGovernor
To create jobs and grow the economy, we need to be swinging hammers and building things. That starts with fixing our roads and bridges. We can fix our infrastructure with REAL leadership #HoodForGovernor
Since 2009, Mississippi's real growth has been anemic - less than 1%. Since 2009, TN is growing at 20%. Why?
I've taken on drug companies, I've taken on child pornographers and sexual predators. I've put murderers behind bars. I've prosecuted corrupt politicians and Klansmen, alike. In everything I've done as your AG, I've put Mississippi working families first #HoodForGovernor
I'm from Houlka , MS. We never worried much about partisan politics. We had to work together to get things done. #HoodForGovernor
I'm tired of the same old same. Old bridges and old roads. Old thinking on schools that says, "no" to pre-k, old healthcare where costs go up and rural hospitals close. It's time to move on. You, me, together - let's put working folks first #HoodForGovernor
"The working families need to be front and center here in our state. As Attorney General, my office, has recovered $3B for #Mississippi taxpayers." #HoodForGovernor
"We've got to stop the giveaways to large, out-of-state corporations. That's money that should be spent in our state." #HoodForGovernor
"Working families have been kicked to the curb for far too long. One of the ways we can help the working families is to cut back sales tax on food and groceries." #HoodForGovernor
