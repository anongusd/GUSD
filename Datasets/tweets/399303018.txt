I'm disgusted at the way elected officials, members of the media, @realDonaldTrump, and social media trolls have bullied and terrorized Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez. They should be angry at Brett Kavanaugh for his failure of character, not at the women who are calling it out.
A judge making about 200k was able to pay a 92k country club membership joining fee and put a cash down payment (that exceeded his ENTIRE STATED NET WORTH) on a house worth over a million dollars. 		His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he was shady AF before anyone knew about Ford.
