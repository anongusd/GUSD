@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods I didnt notice
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Ive been from right wing libertarian to left wing libertarian and back and forth and several subjects. But if you dont change you arent progressing
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Agreed
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Yeah üòÇ,.. maine goal is to respect people, which is becoming rare
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Youre welcome, i need to be exposed to the other side more. Im 15 and thinking about getting a degree in political science.
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods If the wealth inequality wasnt as bad then id say that the rich paying more is not necessary
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Some article said it would take 20, but i think that is not feasible
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Id say 15 (yet thats not really a living wage). 20 is too much. 10 is too little. I dont propose ot happen overnight but gradually. Another solution is to keep the minimum wage the same for kids
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Yet, some might consider it fair that the poor should pay less than the rich due to the fact america has really bad wealth inequality
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Its not possible for everyone to get out of the bottom or else there wouldnt be a bottom, so the bottom should be living with the bare necessities. There is alot of people working to provide for their family but cant
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Not everyone can get a decent paying job due to do several factors. So what im proposing is that corporations should be required to pay their employees a living wage, so that the bottom can live with bare necessities. Yes some can get out of the bottom, but...
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Yes and since they are in the 1% they can afford to pay more taxes. It doesnt mater WHO is the 1% it matters that they pay there fair share, and depending on who you ask ‚Äúfair share‚Äù can vary.
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods ‚ÄúIf you deserve to get more money, get more money‚Äù wow. You over simply this. In this day an age it is getting increasingly harder to earn a living wage. Corporations should be required to pay their employees over the age of eighteen a living wage in order for them to succeed
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods Only job they can get at their level, which is theft of the 95%.
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods 281.51 billion dollars. They employ 1.4 million people and pay their workers around 11$.

@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods The not so well off person. The top 1% has a system where it is virtually impossible to climb out of the bottom 95%. So a solution is to make the wealthy pay more than the poor in taxes in order to pay for social services to ensure the bottom 95%....

@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods The 95%‚Äôs money is stolen. If the rich get tax cuts then the government can‚Äôt spend as much on the impoverished.
@BaldilocksBear @RealJamesWoods When the wealthy 1 tenth of 1% own over 95% of the wealth in the united states and i say it‚Äôs not that insane of an idea to NOT cut their taxes you seem to think its ‚Äútheft‚Äù. The rich have been stealing from the poor for too long!
