@PubliusPost64 @michellemalkin Michelle's exact quote is "Diversity is not a stregnth, unity is!" which is EXACTLY what it means, "from many, one". Drop all the hyphens and just unite as one people, Americans, doesn't matter the race, ethnicity, sex preference, etc.
@PubliusPost64 @michellemalkin Debating ideas is good, noticing someone's skin before anything else is the Balkanization of America, once again, going against "e pluribus unum". Who cares about someone's race &amp; ethnicity when deabting ideas? We should drop our hyphens and unite as one people, Americans!
@PubliusPost64 @michellemalkin Apparently it does, conservatives are all about patriotism, the rule of law, and defending those ideas from people who don't believe in those things, all she did. Reminding Michelle that she isn't white is telling her to stay on the plantation and not speak for herself.
@tellquint @AJA_Cortes Excellent move, brother! My parents also gave me ZERO money for college, and I went to @USC, a private 4 year university. Yeah, I got scholarships, part time jobs, and student loans, I never bitched about any of it or resented anyone for having helpful parents. 😎💪🇺🇸
If people like you and jemele are criticizing @michellemalkin for saying "Diversity isn't our strength, unity is!", she's defending the American ideal of "E Pluribus Unum", she's SPOT ON.

@AdamTrahan One of the best life lessons I learned is the power of forgiveness, it works wonders and regret wasting so much time being angry at people that I just should've forgiven from the beginning.
This just exposes the #racism of the Left. They believe the only people who can be true Americans are white, any non-white who sounds educated is just trying to be "white". To the Left, non-whites are supposed to be the hired help, so don't tell me the parties switched. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/OcS2YpNSfF

@michael_huling Operation Iraqi Freedom was the right thing to do at the time. We had just been attacked and had 3K Americans, some were my co-workers. Pres. Bush couldn't risk having someone like Saddam Hussein w/$$$ &amp; infrastructure to fund other terrorists, and WMDs. Today, not so much.

@scubashawn21 @ScottMGreer @kyleraccio @GOP @RealCandaceO Rubio was the only @GOP candidate for #POTUS that irritated me the MOST, what a ridiculous person to run for the White House.
@EddieMcClintock @jockowillink Great video, and as an avid yogi, I definitely believe in it. I really should stop drinking, makes me feel foolish doing yoga and meditation...and then meeting the guys for cocktails.
@GirlsOfEuropa Wrong! The first black congressman were Republicans, the first elected black Senator was Republican, it all changed after FDR's New Deal.
@mikem022482 @ScottMGreer @kyleraccio @GOP @RealCandaceO I know, and while Hispanics are slowly replacing Blacks as the largest minority group, unlike Blacks, Hispanics come from a truly foreign culture that has taken 5 to 6 generations to slightly get the clue of American culture of capitalism and Protestantism. Blacks grew up in it!
@mikem022482 @ScottMGreer @kyleraccio @GOP @RealCandaceO 40 is still less than 51, and we don't need 51% of the black vote to win the WH, we just need something above the single digits. Blacks used to be at that level, Hispanics never were and never will be.

@RaferWeigel As I told you before, #JussieSmollett has done a HUGE disservice to gay men of color like myself, more so now since I did, however reluctantly, vote for @realDonaldTrump. Every victim of hate crimes should disavow Smollett and demand he be held accountable, just AWFUL!

@millenbrownact I realized writing wasn't for me, so I'd never be able to write my own parts in scripts, which explains my slow progress. Also, I still have my day job and my military obligations, but I haven't given up on performing, and I owe a lot of that to actors  @rossagrant &amp; #GianKeys
@millenbrownact About 25 years ago, I spoke with actress Carrie Fisher (#RIP) and she told me that writing is good job for actors because we won't always be working as actors away from our day jobs. 7 years ago I got a gig writing a column at British paper about American politics...HATED IT!
@Rob_LFN I like overhead presses, I progress nicely with them, and now I realized it's because I don't really engage my hip flexors.
@millenbrownact It's only February, it gets better, trust me. In America, it's pilot season, so actors in Los Angeles are going on audition after audition for pilot shows that will shoot this spring and summer to start playing in the fall. I don't know if the #UK has the same thing.

@Rob_LFN Thanks a lot, I will do that!! I travel with a lacrosse ball, but never thought to use it for my hip flexors.
@Rob_LFN When I do weightlifting training, cleans, jerks, snatches, I don't have a problem with my hip flexors.
@Rob_LFN I don't sit much, I stand a lot for work and in the military, but my hip flexors always give out too soon when I'm doing sit ups and crunches. When I do yoga, my hip flexors are the first to get stiff and fatigued.
@Ventuckyspaz @TulsiGabbard So can I! @TulsiGabbard is the only Democrat I'd vote for if I had to vote for a DEM, but I will be voting for Trump in 2020.
@Rob_LFN Bench press. My hip flexors give out too quickly after a couple of reps.

@LaughJack15 @jeffpearlman @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard Thank you, I wish the same for you as well. There is NEVER any excuse to be disagreeable when disagreeing! 😎👊💖🇺🇸
@sethpetersonla One of the worst things to have happened was for Trumpism to co-opt conservatism. 😪😪😪🇺🇸
@jeffpearlman @LaughJack15 @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard Hey, #Blondie was my favorite band   until I heard The Go-Go's/ @officialgogos! #Rapture 😎🎸🥁🎹🇺🇸 https://t.co/NWp3A1QvBH
@sethpetersonla Kind of. Your troll was speaking nonsense of Hillary, which tells me if she were a decent political figure, people wouldn't be making stories like that about her. People didn't like the Bushes and the Carters, but stories like that don't exist about them.
@jeffpearlman @LaughJack15 @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard The thing is she wouldn't. Evangelical Christians are the most supportive of Jews living their faith, their Messiah Yeshua was a Jew himself. Politically speaking, politicians don't have to like me so long as they vote to keep me free, conservatives do that for me. 🇺🇸
Snow, cold weather, wearing boots, drinking toddies! 😎👊💖☃️❄🇺🇸 https://t.co/Xzf6oKFPBl
@jeffpearlman @LaughJack15 @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard I'm sure @VP Pence may never invite me to join his family for dinner, but that's okay. There's no requirement in Christian doctrine to accept how homosexuals live their lives. It doesn't give Christians to hate on us, and Pence hasn't given me any clue that he hates ppl like me.
@jeffpearlman @LaughJack15 @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard Pence is a Christian, so he has certain beliefs about homosexuality. Fair enough, he doesn't hate people like me, and as a politician, he hasn't authored legislation to make me a 2nd class citizen. He's not indecent to disagree with how I live my life.
@LaughJack15 @jeffpearlman @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard For the sake of *this* argument only, let's say he's a homophobe, so what? So long as he doesn't propose legislation to satisfy his homophobia, it's meaningless. People are entitled to believe what they want, politics isn't group therapy, &amp; I'm an openly gay man of color! 🇺🇸
@jeffpearlman @tedcruz @VP @TulsiGabbard 😎👊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sNeQxr0dJ0
YES! YES! YES! YES! 😎👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/806c52qfki
@jeffpearlman I'm not complaining. I was a @tedcruz supporter, @VP Mike Pence was the first governor to endorse Cruz for #POTUS, so he'a good in my book! As for Democrats, I really like Rep. @TulsiGabbard (D-HI). 😎👊🇺🇸
@sethpetersonla Both Trump and Clinton were the worst people we as a country could've picked to be POTUS, but people who lie about both with outrageous story is extremely sad....because it tells America we got what we deserved. 😪🇺🇸

@TheForeverAlpha Cost of living in Santiago can be higher than in Lisbon, there are so many affluent neighborhoods there, but I used taxi cabs more than public transportation.
@TheForeverAlpha I lived in Lisbon for 3 months, rode the subway everywhere, food, entertainment are cheaper than in the UK, but housing is starting to get a bit more costlier than before. Also, it isn't a very large city, so you could live in the outskirts and still reach the city easily.

Elected office was never supposed to be a lifelong career, and incumbency shouldn't entitle anyone to keep their current seat "warm" while trying for another seat. Give someone else  a shot the current seat that they wouldn't otherwise run for. https://t.co/8WyKEAvZU8
They should all resign from current office in order to run for the office they want. I've said that since '92 when Bill Clinton was still AR Governor.

@MitchHeaslip I travel a lot for work as a civilian, one time I was at a hotel in Florida, they had some sandbags from a potential flood from a recent storm, I asked if I could a bag for a body workout, they said yes, &amp; I did my squats near the loading dock of the hotel, by employee entrance.
