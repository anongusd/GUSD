@sadialatifi Defending this cover is obviously something you are highly committed to. So I guess all we can say is that I strongly disagree.
@sadialatifi... Said nothing about that.  It's the magazine cover on which its placed.  Don't see many "normal kids" on the cover of RS.
@sadialatifi... That's one way to look at it.  The other is that it makes him anything but a "normal kid".  It makes him look like a star.
@sadialatifi... A story that explores how a kid can be turned into a terrorist is one thing.  Putting him on the cover is very different.
