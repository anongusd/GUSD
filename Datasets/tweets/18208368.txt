(4) it's never too late to do the right thing - to choose country over party. what is happening right now is far beyond Democrat or Republican. This is a moment in time that will be scrutinized and studied for years to come. Where do you want your place in all of this to be?
(3) speaking out against your own team is not an easy thing to do, but you need to ask yourself, when you have to explain to yourself or even to your children where you stood in all of this and why - what answer do you want to be able to give?
(2) if you work for @realDonaldTrump - think twice before permanently affixing your name, reputation, credibility to his by blindly defending him. Objectively look at the evidence. Look at what he has said vs what we know to be true.
(1) I say this not in a snarky way but as someone who once had to face the decision to confront the reality of what was happening in and to the #RepublicanParty &amp; decided to speak out and think freely...
Every single #Republican defending @realDonaldTrump right now should do some real soul-searching, self-assessment. Ask yourself: Do you want to go down in history as the people who stood by this criminal traitorous thug? Now is the time to walk, no, run away from #Trump
