When our country operates under continuing budget resolutions, the strength and readiness of our military suffers and our ability to make investments in jobs is hindered. 4/4
Coming to an agreement has proved elusive since the President’s budget proposal eviscerated funding for programs that invest in our infrastructure, transportation systems, research and development, and the health of our people. 3/4
Today’s funding crisis began almost four months ago on October 1, 2017, and until a budget is established for our military and our economy, we cannot proceed. 2/4
Establishing a bipartisan budget agreement is my most immediate priority so that we can adequately and quickly fund our military and economic programs. 1/4

DACA participants work legally, pay taxes, and contribute to the US economy. They do not deserve to be in this situation of uncertainty and fear. I support the DREAM Act and it is past time that Congress allows this important bill to be debated and voted upon.

Voting rights are fundamental to the continuation of a democracy. That's why Pete co-sponsored the Voter Empowerment Act. #SOTU
#Veterans deserve world-class care for their bravery, devotion, and sacrifice. We must never forget our military families. #SOTU
Our troops must be safe on the battlefield and able to find opportunity when they leave it. #SOTU
It is time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. They have served, and continue to serve us bravely. #SOTU
Proud to hear of the commitment to American workers' ability to earn a living this evening. #SOTU
Real hourly wage for American workers has not improved in decades. Let's stand together for all American workers. #SOTU
Time to pass #PaycheckFairness Act. Pete is a co-sponsor.
Glad to see that #infrastructure, especially deficient bridges are part of #SOTU. Long noted that 4,091 are deficient or obsolete in IN.
Pete's worked to restrain out-of-control gas prices that are straining family budgets. #SOTU
Research and development vital to create jobs and protect the jobs we already have. #SOTU
#Manufacturing jobs should be a priority. Time to hold China to account for its innumerable trade abuses. #SOTU
#NorthStar should be a growing, thriving economy with good-paying jobs in #nwindiana and across the nation.
