That was by far the most normal press conference of the Trump presidency. Also, there was just one question, by my count, about the testimony in which Michael Cohen accused the president of a series of crimes and conspiracies. Which is weird.
"We've had the toughest language in the history of diplomacy," Trump says.	Khruschev's ghost snorts, pounds a billowy shoe on a podium and says something that loosely translates as "have you tried 'We will bury you?'"
@BurgerDogBoy @WalshFreedom Why should i update a tweet that was accurate?
Trump details negotiations: "Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn’t do that. They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas we wanted."
There are people who think it is diplomatic malpractice to bring the president of the United States halfway around the world if there isn't an agreement in place already.

@jonathanhsinger My only question is whether it would be covered if it was sent from the floor of the House.
Just seeing the Pelosi statement on Gaetz and his response that he was deleting his tweet on Cohen. Her mention of the "speech or debate" clause of the Constitution reads as a warning that the House won't defend a member's rights under the clause in case of witness tampering.

@JK312 @KamalaHarris The % of the vote of any candidates who don’t get 15 percent is essentially reassigned among those who do (for statewide delegates and then by dist). 40 percent could end up being a big win for the top finisher depending on what rest of distribution looks like. Too early to know.
@2020Delegates California is not built as much as some states are for running up the score in a handful of districts and walking away with huge delegate pads. But it *is* built for doing that if you can play well in all 53 districts, which is cost-prohibitive for most.
@2020Delegates To be fair, everyone gets mad at me when I nerd out on how delegates are apportioned. I *could* have gone into the particulars of “thresholding” candidates and potentially netting a huge delegate haul without even winning a majority — or killing it with a majority.
Two ways to look at this: 1) obviously, cost matters a lot for governance. 2) Hillary Clinton laid out how to pay for her proposals and got less than zero political credit for it, while Trump won in part on a promise that Mexico was gonna write a check for the wall. https://t.co/tfOLW1uZz7

@DeMelaatse I don't know how the court will rule -- there are arguments on both sides -- but the administration's plan relies on a shoot-the-moon strategy of cobbling together several laws and baskets of money that are each testable for an overall policy that is testable.
@DeMelaatse And -- as claimed in the suit, and as I wrote before the suit -- the question of whether a wall constitutes a military construction project depends on the definition of a military construction project, which is defined in the law, If a wall applies, Posse Comitatus may arise.
@DeMelaatse But there is a legitimate question as to whether Congress can delegate power to the executive to choose how to spend money for programs for which there is no authorization or appropriation with a simple transfer order. I don't think it's been tested. It's part of the lawsuit.
"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." The military construction emergency law does not appropriate money. It instead gives authority to the president, during a time of a declared emergency, to transfer funds. https://t.co/M6yPrsYtiV

@rachelbovard True -- and points for creativity -- but generally easier to gum up the works in the Senate than the majority-rules House. If there's a race, it's hard to see the Senate going first. MCCONNELL: "I don't understand why the Minority Leader is objecting to consent to consider..."
Indeed, there would be no need for a conference committee if it couldn't be amended. But the Senate will have to vote on something -- even if it is to vote not to vote on the House resolution -- if the House passes a termination. https://t.co/E9PWinri8l

@rachelbovard The general transfer authority in the Pentagon budget, which is not what they're relying on but is the only one like it that I know of, says that transfers can't be used if Congress has denied a request. The lower number could be seen as a denial of request. Nightmare for courts.
This is true. I thought of it more along the lines of a none-of-the-funds-in-this-or-any-other-act to be used for additional border barriers. Lots of questions for courts. https://t.co/HcRPptEFfg
@rachelbovard Kind of hurt you didn't read all the way down: "In theory, Congress could have gone further to stop Trump from building a wall. The new bill could have included a "none-of-the-funds" provision prohibiting him from using any federal money to build a barrier along the border."
Old rule of politics: When a politician says x is not y, it is almost always y. Here's OMB Director Mick Mulvaney this morning on the emergency declaration and the wall: "It's not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he's waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money."
The first Armed Services hearings after this declaration are going to be insane. 	"Mr. Secretary, you came up here and begged for military construction funds that were absolutely necessary to the security of your service branch. Now, they're not. What happened?"
Trump says the wall is "a very important instrument for the military." Another indication that this is headed the direction of a militarized zone on the southern border.
I bet Congress will follow up with generals on the projects that they didn't think were "too important" to have funded this year and can take a back seat to the wall.
Trump refers to "MS-13 gangmonsters"
"We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers with all types of criminals and gangs." -- @realDonaldTrump announcing declaration of national emergency in order to mobilize the military to build a border wall.
U.S. border protection apprehended 3 people undocumented immigrants who had previously been convicted of murder in 2017. https://t.co/q3jI5aDLeu
Trump would “absolutely veto” any Hill effort to block emergency wall plan, WH aide says. officials tell surrogates on private call that eminent domain will be used aggressively and that plan is focused on Texas in part to deny California standing to sue. https://t.co/bD2JYyYIuD
The news for @KamalaHarris — in this case @RepBarbaraLee endorsement — continues to be more strategically valuable than that for any other candidate so far. Rollout continues to roll.
If you read the military construction emergency law, which is triggered by emergency declaration, it says funds can be shifted to build military facilities — which likely means the wall would have to be maintained by the military, not just built by it.

@rachelbovard Bookmarking this for the times-Rachel-defended-McConnell file.
It should not be lost that, with veto-proof majorities, Congress voted to limit new fencing to $1.4 billion and 55 miles, with a specific prohibition against walls. If one were making the power-of-the-purse case, this would be Exhibit A for the intent of Congress on the issue.
Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., tells me it's "not clear to me" why WH was floating national emergency declaration right before votes today. Seems like the intent might have been to help secure votes to keep the government running.
@ThePlumLineGS @armandodkos In shorter words, Pelosi said something with a partisan edge, but it’s important to note that she is the leader of one branch of government accusing another of abusing his power.
It is impossible to divorce the partisanship from the importance of the Speaker of the House accusing the president of a gross abuse of power and yet it is also impossible to divorce the importance of the Speaker accusing the president of abuse of power from the partisan words. https://t.co/CFn3Z9VVN0
@aqualad08 @realDonaldTrump I've dropped 30 pounds. Thanks for noticing.
@DemFromCT The Homeland bill is the denouement of a terrible loss for Trump, who shut down the government for 35 days, got 55 miles of fencing when he had 65 miles of fencing in hand before the shutdown and didn't get a wall. Plus, the bill says his wall prototypes endanger law enforcement.
Seems to make some sense that the president would wait to see where the votes are in the House and Senate to announce his position on the Homeland bill -- just as it makes sense congressional leaders would want him to announce his support beforehand.
Barr confirmation with Democratic votes is good news for @realDonaldTrump, who is also enjoying a rebound in approval ratings per Gallup at 44 percent.
@MattGertz @benpershing It will also make sense for him -- relatively soon -- to sign a short-term deal to go out on the field, prove his merit and that he can be a good citizen, so that he can get the kind of contract he wants next year.
@MattGertz @benpershing well, I don't desperately want him back. I AM a Nats fan. And at $20M/1 year, he'd be good to keep. But they can win without him and it would have been a mistake for them to pay him $30M or $40M/year for 10 years.
@benpershing @MattGertz Harper isn't champagne and roses. His value to a team should be judged not just by his potential but by his play, including time on the field, and his contributions -- positive and negative -- to the clubhouse. $250M is too much. He should re-sign w/Nats for 1 yr./$20M.

.@amieparnes — All signs point to Biden getting in —&gt; https://t.co/lxWs5rNjcL
I wonder whether, with Congress having denied the president his specific request for border barrier funding at a time when he says there is national emergency, courts might find a subsequent declaration is invalid because Congress weighed in on funding after emergency surfaced.

The Homeland Security conference report says that new fencing can only be of the type already approved by 2017 — like steel bollard fences — because, in the estimation of Congress, that prioritizes agent safety. A wall, according to Congress, is less safe for law enforcement.

9) Yes, that's a roundabout way of getting to the crux of one of the issues surrounding the national emergency/wall discussion, but the definition of military construction could become an issue in this debate. 10/10.
8) Which means you could have the military permanently conducting law enforcement on U.S. soil, which raises the Posse Comitatus question. 9/x.
7) It's possible that in order to qualify under those conditions that a wall would have to be permanently under the supervision of the military -- not just built by the Army Corps -- rather than Homeland 8/x
6) A "military installation" is precisely defined as a "base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the secretary of a military department." 7/x
5) The law says "military construction" refers to any "construction, development conversion or extension of any kind" carried out at a "military installation." 6/x
4) But definitions are important. The law authorizes secretaries of the military branches to "undertake military construction" projects. The law defines military construction projects in a lengthy set of prescriptions. 5/x
3) The dollar figure is limited to what is currently left over in the military construction account, which could be enough to cover the wall (I don't know what the number is right now). 4/x
2) On its surface, that authority appears to be very broad. It requires notification of Congress, rather than the approval of Congress. 2/x
1) There is an authority — Title 10, Section 2808 — that allows the Secretary of Defense to use unobligated military construction funds to build things if the president has declared a national emergency. 2/x

There may be no more carefully negotiated set of approps than those directing the Corps’ project list. It’s a political minefield to pull money from projects currently funded, and it may also create legal problems because of the specific way in which Corps money is directed. 9/9

We’ve seen that in the pushback Trump has gotten from Cornyn on taking Hurricane Harvey money. 7/x
2) The other areas of the budget being looked at are problematic for a variety of reasons. I know less about the disaster aid money restrictions, but there’s at least a huge political complication in that you’re taking away cash from disaster-struck parts of the country 6/x
One big question is whether budget officials at DOD are willing to risk signing checks to execute these transfers if there’s a question of drawing from the Treasury in violation of the law. That is, if it turns out a transfer order was illegal, do they want to be on the hook? 5/x
There’s also a notification provision. SecDef has to notify Congress, which has traditionally meant getting sign off from top appropriators. That’s protocol, but the law appears to require just a heads-up rather than seeking permission. 4/x
However, the secretary cannot do that if Congress has denied funding for the project he wants to fund. Would turning down Trump’s specific request constitute a denial? That’s a legal question. 3/x
1) The big, obvious pot of money is at the Pentagon. The annual defense appropriations bill has a provision allowing the SecDef to transfer a total of $4B out of and into programs if he declares it’s in the “national interest.” 2/x

Trump has changed his branding of the Democratic Party for this election a little: "THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM. THEY”RE BECOMING THE PARTY OF SOCIALISM, LATE-TERM ABORTION, OPEN BORDERS AND CRIME."
Trump says no president should have to go through a hoax during his presidency. He's talking about Russia conspiracy allegations. But the birther thing ...
Trump goes crowd size on Beto, says his crowd is small. "That may be the end of his presidential bid."
At Trump's first big rally of the campaign biennium, he borrows from @HillaryClinton, telling Texas voters at an El Paso rally that he and they are getting "stronger together."
Don't think for a second that congressional negotiators were unaware of the exact moment the president was expected to take the stage in El Paso tonight as they announced a deal. Whether they have one or not, they were going to announce one.
The last time El Paso mattered so much in world affairs, Wehrner Von Braun and his team of rocket scientists had just been spirited to Fort Bliss. Also, the failed assassination attempt against President Taft in the early 20th century. But this is a lot of attention for The Pass.

This whole press conference is about Northam's brand rehabilitation -- the good for him -- rather than an explanation of how his remaining in office would be good for the commonwealth. Perhaps that's because there's no strong argument for the latter.
"I am asking for the opportunity to earn your forgiveness," Northam says, then says he could spare himself pain by resigning. Says he could not in good conscious take "the easier path" for him.
Northam said his belief he's not in the picture "stems from my clear memory of other mistakes I made" -- said he darkened his face "as part of a Michael Jackson" performance.

Perhaps there’s some “perfect” world in which the debt limit could ride on a conference report providing border security funding but not a wall that Trump gets behind, swings Republicans in line on and becomes law, but seems more likely to blow up than not. 6/6
McConnell could try to pass a wall bill and debt limit for show, knowing it couldn’t become law. But the idea that adding the debt limit to a wall bill is going to make it all more palatable to Congress is not consistent with reality on the Hill. 5/x
In theory, that could be a border security bill. BUT it would have to be a border security bill that Trump’s base likes — that is, a wall bill — or the border piece isn’t a sweetener for the debt limit. 4/x
Senate Dems don’t have to try to stand in the way, they just have to force McConnell to put up the votes to pass it. That’s a tough vote for in-cycle senators. In theory, it could ride on a popular bill. 3/x
House Democrats quietly reinstated the “Gephardt rule” earlier this year, which automatically passes a debt limit increase if they can pass a budget. That likely puts the ball completely in McConnell’s court to get Senate Republicans to vote for a debt limit increase. 2/x

There’s no easily defensible reason for Pelosi to deny Trump the Capitol for the State of the Union now.
Basically, Trump is re-opening the government so he can use the House chamber to give a State of the Union address and punt his emergency declaration for three weeks.
The government re-opening is
o/h at a local establishment, "so, we're going to get paid. but I'm still going to keep looking" for another job.
The only inviolable rule of a conference committee is that the majority of House conferees and the majority of Senate conferees have to sign a conference report. Pelosi picks the majority of the House conferees. No wall money comes out of a conference unless she agrees.

Also, there’s basically one reason to lie to investigators (congressional or otherwise) or tamper w/witnesses: to cover up criminal or embarrassing activity. Don’t know if Stone is guilty of it, but it’s a concept he’s undoubtedly familiar with after living through Watergate. 2/2
I don’t have any more idea than you what Mueller’s doing with the Stone arrest, but it seems like a pretty big reminder to witnesses about to go in front of committees — and people who want to influence them — that it’s illegal to lie to Congress and to tamper with witnesses.1/2

@rachelbovard @edwardcorrigan Agreed. My guess is that it takes a vote. Which means either a filibuster or a nuclear option -- over holding the State of the Union in a chamber that can't fit 535 people.
@rachelbovard @edwardcorrigan Privileges to go on the floor, yes, but not to address the members. I haven't looked at Senate rules lately, but I'm sure that's in there. House rules provide only for members, delegates and resident commissioners to address the House.
@rachelbovard @edwardcorrigan Even then, it was a *former* president. Despite current partisanship and pliant parties in Congress -- with D and R presidents -- I can't imagine members would want presidents to have freedom to speak on the floor of either chamber at will. Imagine the filibusters!!!
House rules empower only members, delegates and resident commissioners to speak on the floor without special dispensation. The Constitution empowers the House to make its rules. Regardless of where one stands on the SOTU fight, the separation of powers here seems pretty clear.

Nothing subtle about Buttigieg’s generational contrast as he jumps into the presidential race: “There’s no such thing as ‘again’ in the real world. We can’t look for greatness in the past. Right now, our country needs a fresh start.”
One thing I haven't heard a lot of talk about is an offset for all the new border-security, wall and humanitarian relief money POTUS wants. One thing that gives China leverage in its relationship with the U.S. -- more than a trade deficit -- is all the U.S. debt China owns.

Should be fun -- and I don't mean fun -- watching Trump try to whip votes to raise the debt limit.
The president is arguing simultaneously that Pelosi must be in town to negotiate a deal and that she can fly commercially to Afghanistan -- which would be a real national security problem -- and he's arguing he needs her while he's trying to negotiate with her rank and file.
To recap: With the military fully funded, the president has said the Speaker of the House, the person second in line to the presidency, can't fly on a military jet to a war zone -- but can fly commercial if she wants to.

@CatMom1955 @ProPublica The House voted 3,742 times during O'Rourke's 6-year career (assuming no votes before the new Congress is sworn in later this week). Don't know exactly how many he missed, but vast majority of the time he voted with the party.
I made an error in a recent thread about Beto O'Rourke's voting record. During his six-year House career, he voted against the position of the majority of Democrats 169 times, not 167 times, per a dataset compiled by @ProPublica. I regret the error.
@seriously211 He literally praises cracking down on China’s unfair trade practices in the op-ed. Hard to take that as a repudiation of the trade war.
Trump should be happy w/Romney op-ed. Sure, it’s a condemnation of Trump’s leadership style, but it’s also an endorsement of POTUS’ agenda and an indication Romney plans to support it in the Senate. Romney’s only policy beef? deficits. But he praises tax cut that expanded them.

@armandodkos I’m not saying that it will be the decisive issue, just that it’s consequential, something under Trump’s control and in an area where he had left himself open between the way he campaigned (and Obama did) and the way he had governed.
The most consequential actions for Trump in 2020 so far that he controls -- that is, not the investigations -- are the drawdowns in Syria and Afghanistan. The wars were a major opening for a Democratic rival that he has begun to close off.
Just found this gem in the Congressional Record -- W&amp;M chair Kevin Brady, December '15: "if the United States begins unilaterally levying tariffs, 	our trading partners will no doubt do the same, leading to a very 	dangerous cycle."

One add: Some votes simply aren't strictly ideological. O'Rourke voted to allow one-year permits for the limited killing of unendangered sea lions on the Columbia River to protect certain fish. Most Dems were against. Jayapal, Wilson, Huffman &amp; Beyer were among CPCers with him.
Stay tuned. 12/12
This fight is just starting, and it will be interesting to watch. It's easy to dismiss reporting on it as "horserace" journalism, but the way the candidates, their campaigns and their supporters engage in politics is a big part of how campaigns are won and lost. 11/x
A fair reading of the politics is that Sanders backers are worried about his pull with progressives and millennials -- and that is framed by portraying O'Rourke as a tool of the old Democratic establishment. 10/x
A fair reading of the votes is that he isn't always aligned with the most progressive set in the Democratic Caucus but that he usually is -- and that he doesn't like dilatory votes. 9/x
Does that mean he's "progressive?" or "progressive enough?" Surely not for me to decide. Certainly, each vote will get its vet. But it's fascinating that the first shots of the invisible 2020 Democratic primary are Bernie backers targeting O'Rourke. 8/x
If you go through the list, you'll find instances of him voting with people named Pelosi, DeLauro, Conyers, Lee, Ellison, Doggett or Velazquez against the majority of the Democratic Party. 7/x
There are also a number of votes on which he bucked the majority of Democrats because he was voting with the left -- for example, against re-authorizing intelligence agencies and extending the re-designation period for HUBZones. 6/x
There are also votes to continue government funding and allow the military to sponsor motor sports and wrestling events 5/x
There are votes in favor of the space program and disaster aid -- priorities for his state -- that went against the ideology of the majority of his party. 4/x
There are 28/167 votes that are so procedural/dilatory/nonbinding they have names like motion to approve the journal, motion to adjourn, order the call of the House, order the previous question and instruct conferees. That's more than 15%. Looks like he doesn't like BS votes. 3/x
There are a relative handful of votes where he voted against what anyone would describe as the progressive position on fossil fuels, taxes, trade and other issues. He was seldom alone, but sometimes in a small minority of Democrats 2/x
If you look at the 167 votes where O'Rourke went against the majority of Democrats, here's what you'll find 1/x
your name-calling is unfortunate. 2/2

Yes, this is a good point. If the answer is $1.6 billion for border security but not a wall, then it's a fig leaf for the president that Schumer can probably accept and the government stays open. Not sure Trump signs that, though. https://t.co/cNcCiqcdeq

@BradS415 @MikeDelMoro Meaning that it doesn't fully function in a shutdown. This would be a partial shutdown.
One more thing: Should never rule out the possibility that they will choose to continue funding for another week or two to buy time. Better for Trump to force a shutdown when his party is NOT in control of both chambers, even if he'll own it either way.
If the government shuts down,Democrats will wait until Jan. 3, quickly pass a yearlong bill through the House. Schumer will try to call it up in the Senate. McConnell will table his motion. Then Rs will own the remainder of the shutdown Trump forced. It's not hard math. https://t.co/WTuLVChMhm

@DemFromCT It’s not a pivot piece. He’s not moving away from his base in any significant way here. Yeah, they don’t love bump stock rule, but it’s an 80% issue. Some of the base is fine with it. Criminal justice is popular with base and outside it. Same with Syria.
@bdquinn @realDonaldTrump I don’t under-rate it. The point of the piece isn’t whether it’s enough to win him re-election; it’s that he is expanding beyond base-plus-zero politics while Democrats are still on the sidelines. Will that make a difference in the end? I don’t know.
@bdquinn @realDonaldTrump “And it’s certainly true that there’s a bloc of voters across the country so opposed to Trump that he won’t win their support no matter what policies he adopts between now and November 2020.”
@DemFromCT Don’t confuse the Washington lawmaker talking point of “I can’t believe the process foul” with actually opposing the policy.

@colinwilhelm There's a lot of hair-pulling about whether he consulted Mattis first. The president has been saying he would withdraw from Syria since at least March and hinted at it long before then. This should surprise exactly no one. He waited until after the midterms.

@Joker13z I transcribed quickly
On the day that the president's charity was shut down with a prosecutor alleging that it engaged in a shocking degree of illegal activity, the administration is looking at asking Congress for a border wall "slush fund?"
Here's the jaw-dropping exchange between Terry Moran and Sarah Sanders about where money comes from. Pro tips: taxpayers fund all federal agencies, private entities — not government — benefit directly from trade, gov revenue comes from taxes and that won't change much with USMCA. https://t.co/JnSAyYwdJY
For those following at home, the Pentagon can transfer $4B between accounts. But the law specifically prohibits moving money into military construction. When money is transferred, Congress must be notified. That has meant signoff from both parties, both chambers. But under Trump?
"I would never use Nancy Pelosi as my source for legal authority on anything." -- Sarah Sanders. Pelosi has been making laws, including as an appropriator, since Sanders was four years old.
"We’re not asking American taxpayers for that." -- Sarah Sanders on looking for funding for the wall through various agencies. Turns out all the federal agencies are funded by taxpayers. Also, she seems to think that money from private trade goes into the federal treasury.
Sarah Sanders is doing a very bad job of explaining how government and non-government money works.

If you steal $1.4M from the rest of us, it should be easy to give some fraction of that to charity — which, of course, reduces your tax liability. Likewise, if you’re able to get a false $500K HELOC, why not burnish your community standing with a few checks to worthy orgs? 2/x

Trump has always talked about shutdown and border not as an either or but as first step and second step. Go back through his public comments and interviews. His base hates the government and loves the wall. Question is whether swing voters in swing states feel the same way.
If anything, Trump just made it easier for Pelosi to win the votes she needs for speaker.

The biggest number in Congress is 1 — an entire party with one position. Republicans have multiple positions on the wall and funding for it. Right now, Democrats are unified on it.
There's a non-zero chance that several candidates stick in the game through the entire primary and no one gets a majority going into the convention. But it's also possible someone gets a burst and runs away with it. Too early to tell. It's all talk until people start voting. https://t.co/JtZyGMw7I4

@armandodkos I don’t know. But it’s repeated. And it’s not a terribly uncommon name. And it’s one he’s had 12 years to learn. And Trump calls him Schitt.
If members of Congress really don’t know the difference between a paperwork error and an active conspiracy to frustrate campaign disclosure laws, perhaps they shouldn’t be allowed to regulate themselves.

@StuartRoy We don't know who voted which way. I'd say being in range, with people prepared to vote present on the floor if necessary, puts her in a pretty good position to be speaker.

That means someone who votes "present" or "submits a blank ballot" -- they don't use ballots on the floor but full-throated yells -- is doing Pelosi a favor. Members can vote for anyone. Doesn't have to be GOP or Dem caucus choices. And, yes, Germanotta is Lady Gaga. 2/2
PSA: When the House votes for speaker, it is done by a roll call of members. Each lawmaker calls out the *surname* of his/her choice ("PELOSI" "McCARTHY" "GERMANOTTA") If a candidate gets a majority, she/he is speaker. Votes for non-surnames ("present") lower the denominator 1/2
@armandodkos What he said doesn't fit what they do on the floor. He has to call out a name or not call out a name. If it's the latter, his vote isn't counted as part of the denominator for determining a majority.
@armandodkos Are you talking in caucus? In caucus it doesn't matter. She'll win in caucus handily. On the floor, it's not a ballot. It's a roll call. Each member calls out the name of their choice for speaker. If someone calls out present, the vote is discounted for denominator.

Correction: this did not flip. Apparently, the 100% I thought I saw was not an actual 100% https://t.co/nRf2RSk6Im
One way to think about results as they come in. If Espy gets 100 percent of what he did in Round 1 and Hyde-Smith gets 70% of Round 1 GOP total (her plus McDaniel), they’d both have about 360,000 votes.
Espy flips tiny Benton County in North Central Mississippi. He got 39.4% in Round 1.
Tishomingo County, similar: Huge GOP area. Hyde-Smith running 600 votes or so behind Round 1. Espy 64 votes off Round 1.
Amite County now fully in. Espy got 111 more votes there tonight than in Round 1, Republican number drops by about 500 votes. About 4,700 cast overall in the county.
This is suburban Memphis and was also a McDaniel bastion until Trump weighed in hard for Hyde-Smith, so not clear why the drop-off for Rs. https://t.co/phlA0Pmw1S

My question is whether this will be a wave that recedes in 2020 or more like the two-step wave Democrats saw in 2006-2008. They fell a little bit short in a handful of districts they could have taken this time, but they'll also be defending hard-to-hold seats in OK, SC, etc. https://t.co/TF9tJpZjq1

"It obviously didn't work in a lot of these districts." @dthornell on Republicans campaigning against Pelosi in 2018.
On the one hand, it's hard to see how Pelosi wouldn't be elected Speaker, Hoyer majority leader or Clyburn whip. On the other hand, all three were born before Pearl Harbor. For young folks, that's the day nearly 80 years ago when Japan launched an attack on U.S. forces in Hawaii.
About half the current House Democrats have served in the majority before, but that fraction will be smaller when the new Congress is seated.
Democrats will end up having won a big victory in the House numerically. Not 2010, but more than 2008 and maybe more than 2006. Which would make it the second biggest shift since the Republican Revolution in 1994. https://t.co/QtY8htk9vC

This will become more apparent as time goes on. But even in Trump's tweets about the House this morning, it's abundantly clear, he knows what he lost last night. The question is whether he'll figure out how to win it back in two years. 23/x
If you cut through the spin, this was a pretty decisive victory for Democrats. They picked up a lever of power at the federal level, won some important governorships and still have a filibuster in the Senate -- and Rs started this cycle thinking about getting to 60. 22/x
History suggests that the likely outcome of this midterm would be a recession from the strength of the president's party in the last election, and that's what happened. But it didn't have to be the outcome. 21/x
Republicans are rightly relieved that it wasn't worse for them. But try to find a place on the map where they expanded their footprint. It's hard. Then look at where Democrats expanded their footprint. It's a lot easier. 20/x
All of this is to say that the American political landscape changed a little bit last night. It wasn't a massive sea change that broke the fever of division and partisanship. But it did go mostly in one direction. 19/x
Wait ... one more ... Dave Brat lost in the Richmond-based district that Republicans have held since Tom Bliley was first elected to Congress in 1980. This is not a typical suburban swing district. It's the old South or maybe the new South. But it ain't Alexandria. 18/x
Pete Sessions went down in Texas-32 last night in the Dallas suburbs, where he's been a fixture since 1996. And so on and so on. 17/x
Illinois' 6th District in the northwest Chicago suburbs, has been represented by a Republican since before I was born -- mostly by Henry Hyde -- and I'm 43. Pete Roskam lost there last night by almost six points. 16/x
The Oklahoma City district, represented by Mickey Edwards, Ernie Istook, Mary Fallin and James Lankford in the past, has been in GOP hands since John Jarman switched parties in 1975. 15/x
Because the result was expected, it's easy to forget that Mikie Sherill just won a seat in New Jersey that Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen had represented since 1995. His predecessor, a Republican, had held it since 1985. 14/x
It's hard to find a silver lining for Republicans in the House other than that they didn't lose more — and there are still a number of outstanding districts to come in. In order to win a majority, Democrats had to find ways to win in districts that were Republican bastions 13/x
More important, it wasn't limited to a type of district or a certain region. Sure, you can say "suburban," but there are a lot of different types of suburbs. They include wealthy New York bedroom communities, Oklahoma City suburbs and heavily Hispanic areas of TX, FL &amp; CA 12/x
In the House, GOP picked up, by my count, two seats (call me on it if I'm missing any). and Democrats are poised to pick up more than 30. That's a wave (a flip and almost all in one direction) 11/x
In Georgia, Brian Kemp outpaced Stacey Abrams, but the margin was small -- about two points. In Texas, a state Trump won by nine points, there was good news at the gubernatorial level -- Gregg Abbott hit double digits -- but Ted Cruz won by less than 3 points. 10/x
In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds hung on by 3 points in a state Trump won by nearly 10 points. It was a bloodbath for Republicans at the House level, where Democrats now control three of the four House seats and didn't miss a fourth by a ton. 9/x
Let's take a look at some of the Republican-leaning states where Republicans won. Mike DeWine took Ohio by 4+ points, about two-thirds of Democrat Sherrod Brown's margin in the Senate race. Trump won Ohio by more than 8 points. 9/x
That doesn't mean that Trump can't win those states in 2020, but it does mean that it would be political malpractice if his team doesn't start figuring out a fix for the Republican problems there RIGHT NOW. Similarly, Democrats have to figure out how to solidify themselves. 8/x
In Wisconsin, Republicans were non-competitive against Tammy Baldwin, who is no less liberal than Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. And Democrats won the governorship by a whisker -- an office they've held for all of four years since 1987. 1987. 1987. 7/x
In Michigan, Democrats won the governorship by more than 8 points, and Stabenow won re-election by more than 5 points. 6/x
In Pennsylvania, Democratic governor Wolf won re-election by 17 points and Sen. Casey won by 13 points against one of Trump's favorite candidates — Lou Barletta — in a state Trump campaigned in repeatedly. 5/x
What should worry Trump more than anything is that Republicans lost Senate AND gubernatorial races in the three states that were the keys to his electoral college majority -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. 4/x
Look, for example, at Missouri, where Trump won by 19 points, and Hawley won by 6 points, or North Dakota, where Trump won by 36 points and Cramer won by 11 points. 3/x
the Senate seats Republicans picked up were always tough holds for Democrats and they actually won by smaller margins than Trump did in those states (in some cases much smaller margins). Republicans didn't even play in several Dem-held seats that should have been competitive. 2/x
Election thread starts here:		President Trump made a good bet that firing up his base, which intersects with the pre-existing Republican Party, was the best path for boosting Senate candidates in deep red states. BUT 1/x

The key to the Democratic majority was winning not just wealthy suburbs but also districts that reach deep into exurban/rural territory. They would be well-served to remember that as they go forward.
It’s worth remembering that Democrats basically had a two-cycle wave in 2006-2008 that, combined, looked a lot like the 2010 Republican Obama backlash wave. It was slower but produced, if I recall correctly, somewhere in the neighborhood of 55 House seats and a big D Senate.

Thought experiment: if Sam Rayburn had just won control of the House for the second time in his career as Democratic leader - after Republicans had spent several cycles demonizing him across the country - would anyone expect him to walk away?
It’s hard to topple the party leader who just proved definitively she’s not the reason you can’t win the House. Especially if no one will run against her. Double especially if it’s the best vote-counter of her generation. Triple especially if speaker-elex rules tilt in her favor. https://t.co/e2wCwMoF6a
Before anyone gets too carried away with the narrative that the president won everywhere he went, Republicans lost big races in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia - all of which were states he campaigned in this year.
@mattresstagging Yes. If you go back through Trump’s claims in the run-up to the midterms, there’s a lot of fiction.
The lesson Trump drew from Tuesday night was that his bare-knuckled, base-centric and fact-challenged midterm blitz worked. Expect to see much more of the same when he’s actually on the ballot.  https://t.co/wTyzImJNVA
@ThPatriotHerald Fair enough. Great Lakes Region. Rust Belt.
Agreed. The three states that provided Trump's margin in 2016 -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- all elected Democratic senators and governors on Tuesday night. Three of Iowa's four House districts are now in Democratic hands, and King only stopped all four by 3.5 points. https://t.co/NqNUw5LM12
The governors of the key states in Trump’s electoral coalition — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — will all be Democrats in 2020. That’s not entirely or necessarily a reaction to Trump. Lots of factors. But it should concern his political team.
When a party has control of the presidency, the Senate and the House and loses one of them, it was a bad night for that party. When a party has control of none of them and wins one of them, it was a good night for that party.
@rachaelheisler Good point. Though I think Peterson is due north of OK-5 and KS-3 is a hair east. But you're right. Cleaver district in Missouri would count in that, too. Still, it's a blue speck in an ocean of red.
It's about 200 miles between Rep.-elect Kendra Horn's OK district and the nearest Democratic district in Dallas. To the north, nothing but red until Collin Peterson's district in Minnesota. To the East, Steve Cohen's Memphis district and to the West, a New Mexico district.
Kudos to @CookPolitical, which actually had Oklahoma-5 on its watch list as "likely Republican." Most Democrats had no idea it was competitive.

In 20 minutes or so, many people will start to over-interpret the results of Kentucky's 6th congressional district as though it's a perfect microcosm of the national battle for control of the House. It is not. It's a little more Republican-leaning. Either way, it's one district.

@colinwilhelm It's not about slow counting but about challenges to the validity of counts. Ultimately the House decides who is seated. But if there's no majority, there's no House. So, how do you decide who gets seated and gives one side a majority? Nightmare scenario.
@BobbyBamber That's it? 50-to-1? I would have thought the odds would have been much longer than that. Amazing.
What are the odds of an even number of Republicans and Democrats being elected to the House with an odd number of races still undecided by January? Surely, there's a non-zero chance of that. What if the House couldn't organize because neither side had a majority? Ok, deep breath.

To clarify, if Ds win the House, this means a lot of Democrats could vote "present" and make it easier for Pelosi to become speaker without voting for her. If there are 225 Democrats and 210 Republicans, 211 Dems could vote for her, 14 could vote "present" and she'd be speaker. https://t.co/GGJUinb4K4
If a candidate for Speaker wins a majority of the votes of those who call out a surname during the roll call of members, he or she is the Speaker. It is not a majority of the whole House. If someone votes "present," his or her vote does not count. 2/2
NEWS TO ME: I thought it took a majority of the House to be elected Speaker. It does not. Here's how it works. Each member is called by name. When his or her turn comes, he or she calls out the name of his or her choice for Speaker. However, a member can pass. 1/2

@asyoureadthis She said an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans. She used popular vote as her metric. The president won the electoral college, as presidents do. He did not win the majority or even a plurality of the popular vote.
It's remarkable that with historically low employment, 4.1 percent growth and a record that the president says he is proud to run on, the White House still finds it necessary to lie about things like whether the president won a popular-vote majority.
PSA: Trump won 46 percent of the popular vote in 2016, not an overwhelming majority. Clinton won 48 percent.

"Never wrestle him ... any guy who can do a body slam," Trump says of Rep. Greg Gianforte. Crowd cheers. Gianforte pleaded guilty to assaulting a reporter, @Bencjacobs. Trump says he thought "I think it might help him, and it did."
Trump says we haven't heard America First in many, many decades. John McCain's slogan was Country First.

Eastman, the Democratic candidate in NE-2, was one of the progressives who knocked off a moderate — former Rep. Brad Ashford. While it's impossible to tell how Ashford would have done against Rep.

In theory and in practice, the media try to find truth and expose fiction. To the extent that means pointing out when the president makes a false claim, it’s not resistance or opposition, it’s professionalism. 33/33
This isn’t just a pattern on partisan questions; it’s the way Trump deals with his foreign policy, intraparty fights and pretty much all other conflicts under the sun. 32/x
What’s interesting to me about the op-ed is that it served as another way for Trump to make an absurd claim against an adversary, wait for the media to point out its flaws and then cast the media as part of his opposition. 31/x
But to say he’s the great defender of Medicare and pre-existing conditions and affordable health insurance - and that Democrats want to take all those things away - is positively Orwellian given the actions of him, his administration and his party 30/x
And Trump is right that the Medicare for All plan supported by many Democrats would cost an unbelievable amount of money - enough to eclipse all other current spending. 29/x
28) There’s reason to believe that Trump does, in fact, care about Medicare - even though his budget cuts funding for the program. If for no reason other than his understanding that Medicare is popular with many Republican voters, it makes sense for him to support it. 28/x
and it doesn’t work. 27/x
Instead, he’s saying it is the rationale behind “Medicare for All.” His politics dictate having an enemy with sinister hidden conspiracies. It would be easier to argue that Democrats were naive and don’t understand what their plan would do - but Republicans have tried that 26/x
Trump’s take is a fresher one that relies on voters believing that a) he cares about Medicare and b) the Democrats don’t. Notice he’s not saying too-big-to-succeed is an unintended consequence of “Medicare for All.” 25/x
The defend-Medicare-by-cutting-it argument is an old one that didn’t work very well for the GOP. 24/x
It is the same as arguing that Trump is secretly trying to destroy the military by increasing spending for the Pentagon to an unsustainable level - which is to say that it is ridiculous on its face 23/x
It’s a pretty compelling idea if you were born today. 22/x
So, what to make of the op-ed today in which Trump essentially argued that Medicare for All is a secret plot by Democrats to abolish the program by making it financially unsustainable? 21/x
It’s not just that he has said the pre-existing conditions provision is bad policy or should be repealed; he has argued, through Justice, that it cannot be legal. That bears reading a second time. 20/x
When he says he supports that piece of the law - and that his detractors are lying when they say he doesn’t - he is conveniently ignoring the position of his own administration. 19/x
His claim that he supports protecting the pre-existing conditions piece of Obamacare is undermined by his various efforts to repeal the law and the fact that his Justice Department has argued in court that the pre-existing conditions provision is unconstitutional. 18/x
But he has espoused Republican orthodoxy on entitlements in a profound way: By gutting Obamacare, including removing its pay-for, the individual mandate, he has ensured fewer Americans will be covered and that the net cost of the program will rise over time. 17/x
President Trump has long understood that much of his base supports Medicare. That’s why he said during the campaign that he wouldn’t touch it, and his word has been good on that so far. 16/x
Why? Because most Americans don’t want to mess with Social Security and Medicare. Medicaid was lower hanging fruit because there’s less political support for the poor. 15/x
all of the costs of services for eligible participants in the programs. It was his plan before the 2010 GOP takeover of the House, and for eight years in the majority he was unable to get it done. 14/x
Paul Ryan devoted the latter part of his career to rationing Medicare and Medicaid by turning them into voucher programs in which recipients would get a capped level of subsidy to buy insurance and services on the open market rather than the government paying for 13/x
But elite Republicans were still very focused on slashing Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, with the aim of reducing the liabilities of the federal government, which are underwritten by taxpayers/voters. 12/x
who saw it as a threat to the promise of Social Security. Those Republicans were the former Democrats and children of former Democrats who were bound to the GOP by cultural issues but still believed in a federal safety net 11/x
He pushed it through anyway by the skin of its teeth, and it has largely been a successful program. Two years later, he came back with a plan to create private Social Security accounts, which was killed by Democrats and Southern Republicans 10/x
that he was creating a massive new government entitlement program that would eventually be very costly. He was opposed by Democrats who argued that benefits primarily went to insurers and drug companies, not consumers. 9/x
We’ve seen this fight play out for decades. In 2003, George W Bush tried to capture the middle on it with the Medicare Rx drug program. He was opposed by what became tea party conservatives - Steve King et al - on the basis 8/x
It’s that they didn’t want taxes to go up more. They believe - or position themselves as believing - in less taxes and smaller gov. Ds believe - or position themselves as believing - that civilized society provides for the old, the infirm and the able-bodied who don’t keep up.7/x
It was clear then that the main concern was the idea that taxes would have to be raised to keep up with the eligibility-based programs of the New Deal, Great Society and ensuing Democratic agendas. It’s not that Republicans wanted to keep people from having insurance 6/x
They also pointed to public opinion not being with them on a radical revamp of Medicare. 5/x
When Republicans took control in the 1994 elections, they proposed massive - quarter of a billion dollar and more - cuts to Medicare. The more politically savvy Republicans, even then, said it was in the interest of preserving the program not destroying it. 4/x
Republicans want less of them, with cost as a primary consideration. You can go back to LBJ or FDR for evidence of all of this, but I think it’s more useful to look at the last quarter of a century for a variety of reasons. 3/x
For as long as I’ve been covering politics - as long as I’ve been paying attention to it, for that matter - the basic difference between the parties on social insurance programs has been that the Democrats want more of them, with cost as a secondary consideration and 2/x
This is the beginning a thread on Medicare, Social Security, the two parties, what President Trump got right and what he got wrong in his op-ed in USA Today. 1/x
They read polls that told them rationing health care and Social Security has little support among Americans, so they dropped a decades long obsession on the spot and accused their political adversaries of wanting to do it. https://t.co/xIBXJBMOy2

How the world changes. Republicans in Washington used to treat Steve King as a pariah. Here's what Trump just said about him, not so far from his district: "I wish you could get a little bit more conservative ... He could be the world’s most conservative human being"
Trump, realizing that he's speaking to a more Nebraska than Iowa crowd, says "I just want to know who the hell I’m speaking with."
Biggest cheer of the night so far  is when Trump mentions the state of Nebraska, suggesting most of the folks here made the short trip across the Missouri River to be here. Now Trump's starting "Go Big Red" chants.
Now, it's "Da Nang Dick" for Richard Blumenthal, @realDonaldTrump says

@kevinwatts That's ok. It's worth discussing partisanship, bipartisanship, etc. And sometimes when the parties cooperate, it's bad.

@FeistyMonk Sadly, I'm not allowed on the Senate floor to ask questions when senators are making speeches. But if you can get that changed, I'd be happy to do it.
My favorite anecdote in this area is that Mike Enzi and Ted Kennedy were the most likely senators to vote with their parties on mostly party-line votes. And yet they combined to write lots of laws together that provided little controversy and commanded little attention 3/3
the politicians, the press and the public only pay attention to the fights. And if there's a roll call vote on something, it's usually because there's significant dissent. A lot gets done - even now - on a bipartisan basis. But seldom do you hear much about voice-voted bills. 2/3
President Trump talks a lot about legislative accomplishments, like all president. The tax cut was done under reconciliation, which doesn't require bipartisan cooperation. But veterans bills, appropriations, etc., require some element of minority-party support. The truth is 1/2 https://t.co/jYt9YpenVV

There’s a glaring problem with the narrative from the president and McConnell about Democratic obstruction/goalpost moving: the reason Kavanaugh hasn’t been confirmed yet is that a handful *Republicans* remain unconvinced that he should be on the court.

@StuartRoy He should name them.
The president of the United States just accused an unnamed senator of having a drinking problem so bad he or she was "compromised" frequently. Then he refused to say who he was making the charge against. This is uncharted territory.
@Catfatmatty He rejected the characterization that he drank to excess. He said "sometimes probably had too many beers,"
Trump says what he saw in Kavanaugh was someone saying "he did have difficulty as a young man with drink ... He was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot." 	Kavanaugh said he never had a drinking problem.
Trump appears to be making the case that it's OK if Kavanaugh lied to the Senate because senators have lied.
Trump says Democrat is a drunk. " I happen to know some United States senators, one who is on the other side who is very aggressive ...  I ‘ve seen that person in very, very bad situations, somewhat compromising." Of course, the unnamed senator is not up for the Supreme Court.
Trump: "I watched those senators on the Democrat side and I thought it was a disgrace and partially because I know them. I know them too well. And you know what, they are not angels."
The president is now trying to dictate which questions can be asked, in which order, by reporters.

With Joe Manchin's vote still up in the air on Kavanaugh, Trump is slamming him in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey just promised to create term limits when he gets to Congress. That would require a constitutional amendment. 2/3 in each chamber and 3/4 of the states.
Trump in Wheeling on Dems re: Kav: "They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control. That’s what they want – power and control – we’re not going to give it to them. ... When you see the anger ... mean and nasty and untruthful"

@vicedeb Kavanaugh cited him as a character witness today
Dems indeed would like to delay, win midterms and block the confirmation. But it wouldn’t take five weeks for Judge to testify. If Kavanaugh had called for that, it would have gone a long way toward showing he cares as much about his good name as he does about gaining power. 3/3
Judge is only one who could, in open testimony, clarify this. His brief statement under “PENALTY of FELONY” doesn’t allow for any questions. Also, no one takes that felony penalty seriously because it’s never imposed. It’s understandable Kav sees a denial plot in any delay 2/3

It's worth noting, Republicans don't need Flake's vote to go to the floor. The nomination can be reported out favorably or adversely. It doesn't matter as long as McConnell is committed to vote. And as Rs have been telling me all along, GOP base demands a vote.
Ford said there were three people in the room. She says Kavanaugh assaulted her. She says Judge was there laughing with him. Kavanaugh says he was not at such a place with Ford. Judge's lawyer said there was no such get-together. Those are the facts.

"I think that they look muted ... they made a decision not to really do their constitutional duty and participate in this hearing. That's their choice." - Klobuchar on GOP Judiciary members.
Ford: Brett Kavanaugh got on top of me, covered my mouth and tried to rape me while he and his buddy laughed.		Mitchell: Are you lying about your fear of flying and did anyone help you — a scientist with  degrees from top universities and a top prep school —  write your letter?
In this session, Mitchell has gone much further to delve into Kavanaugh defense and efforts to undermine Ford by suggesting she has partisan motivations and that she might have had help writing her letter to Feinstein.
Mitchell keeps repeating the question of whether anyone helped Ford write her letter. Answer is consistently no.
"His name is not listed in those notes." - Ford on Kavanaugh

Ford: "I was calculating the risk/benefit for me" of coming forward as Kavanaugh got closer to confirmation.
"he pinned me down. I couldn't move. It was absolutely terrifying." This friend is, of course, not speaking about Kavanaugh but wanted me to share that the type of incident Ford has described is not isolated. 2/2

"Nobody can mix up my coffee right" - Grassley - #Senatepeopleproblems
Ford says it is not her responsibility to decide whether Kavanaugh should be on the court, but only to report what happened to her.
Ford, choking up: "I thought it was my civic duty" to report.
Ford: "I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth. … (I thought) Brett was accidentally going to kill me. ... They seemed to be having a very good time."
Ford: "This is  how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me. "
Ford: "I'll lean forward"		Talking about getting closer to the microphone.
Ford is sworn in.
Today will be a reminder that no one is as partisan, ideological, activist or petty as an elected official.
Feinstein explains her actions: "She wanted this held confidential, and I held it confidential up to a point the witness was willing to come forward. ... How women are treated in the U.S. with this kind of concern is really wanting a lot of reform."
Grassley is having a lot of trouble reading his statement, which has no bearing on the substance of the hearing but might be a flag to check his lens prescription.
The double-shot of quoting Biden: Grassley gets to frame his views as the same as a Democratic chairman AND he gets to remind Democratic primary voters of why they might not want Biden.

@mschlapp I agree: not at all monolithic. It's the splits that matter. In any given district or state, does a swing from 55-45 D to 60-40 D cost the Republican the election? In Alabama, most white women voted for Roy Moore. But he WAY underperformed with that set, and it cost him a seat.

Last night, after exchanging emails about the demand for an FBI probe, I asked Ford lawyer Debra Katz if that meant Ford wouldn’t appear without an investigation or a subpoena and got no answer. 		I would still be mildly surprised if Ford doesn’t end up testifying in public.
A couple observations:		1) implicit in the demand for an FBI probe on Kavanaugh allegation is a recognition that no nominee ever pays a penalty for lying to Congress. 		2) There’s no obvi political win for GOP at this point, so it’s sensible for them to push a vote before midterm

Words that should be avoided by people trying to convey truth: "unprecedented" and "surreal."
@RobProvince If I were to rename the Senate, I would call it the Unmitigated Gall.
Schumer: "The gall of my dear friend, the Republican leader" to say you can't take more time after delaying Scalia opening. "unmitigated gall."
If Republicans are given the choice between holding open hearings or seeing Ford speak in another forum, picking an open hearing would make more sense. They have more control at a hearing.
Schumer: "The vote must be postponed until [an FBI probe] is complete."
Schumer says Repubicans and their staff cannot investigate allegations because they've already said they are untrue.
For those surprised by Trump being resigned to a short delay on Kavanaugh, recall that Republicans have long seen the optimal outcome of the confirmation fight as a vote as close to Election Day as possible (without going over). https://t.co/hXVo2v9JJN
NEWS - McConnell: endorses Grassley plan for "bipartisan interviews" with Kavanaugh and Ford. That doesn't equal open testimony.
More McConnell: says Democrats did not raise issue when it could have been addressed with "discretion" and "sensitivity." "Now they choose to raise this allegation." "Because the chain of custody of this letter runs through the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee."
McConnell: "Now an accusation of 36-year-old misconduct, dating back to h.s., has been brought forward at the last minute ... It is an accusation which the ranking member ... has known about for six weeks...yet chose to keep secret until the 11th hour" and notes Kavanaugh denied.
McConnell leads with "it's been 70 days" since Kavanaugh was nominated.

Some recent polls have Trump sub-40%, which means he’s about base-plus-none, and generic ballots give Democrats a double-digit lead. We’re a long way off from Election Day, but we’re also in the post-Labor Day period when voters start to pay attention, and they seem dissatisfied.
