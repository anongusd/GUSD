@funder But McConnell can still prevent Senate from voting?  If they did pass it and trump vetoes, Congress can over-ride the veto.  McConnell is the big problem now.  Right?
@RepSwalwell If McConnell refuses to allow Senate to vote, trump doesn't veto, Congress can't override the veto?  Now what?
@funder But isn't that why McConnell is preventing the Senate from voting on anything trump will not sign?  If the Senate is prevented from voting and it doesn't get to trump, the house can't over-ride the veto.  Is that right?
