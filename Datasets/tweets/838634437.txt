When communicating your work with the media, don’t let it slide if you are misquoted. Don’t be afraid to do that. - @nyshepa #NutrPolicy
@MicheleRSimon @nyshepa @tischfoodcenter Yes &amp; good talk from @rtkersh. And speaker abstracts are here: http://t.co/DH5bri4emF #NutrPolicy
In Mexico, 31% of SSB are homemade (aguas frescas,coffee,etc). Rest are industry-processed SSBs, &amp; those are taxed.- Juan Rivera #NutrPolicy
"In Congress, there’s always a predisposition to inaction. If you act, you’re changing the status-quo." - @rtkersh #NutrPolicy
As a field, we need to shift our paradigm to how we connect to the public and interact politically. - @DrTTKH #NutrPolicy
Nutrient taxes (e.g. sugar, fat) may be more impactful than product taxes; prevents bad substitution patterns. - @BigDataMetrics #NutrPolicy
In taxing food products, the outcome is driven by all potential substitutions, which may not be any healthier. - @BigDataMetrics #NutrPolicy
The average grocery store has 50,000 products &amp; we know everything about them, &amp; we understand how people shop. @BigDataMetrics #NutrPolicy

Food “data deserts” exist too. Huge area of need for data to drive policy for meaningful population impact. - Sonia Angell #NutrPolicy
Re sodium reductions: Can’t have clear specific, measurable, conversations w/ (food) industry if you don’t have the data w/ you. #NutrPolicy
We need to put new studies in context to population at large; we don’t make policy off 1 study; need to look @ body of evidence. #NutrPolicy
