We are the ones who have to pay because when they come in the hospital they don‚Äôt have a fake ID and even if they do sometimes they even have a fake insurance card and I don‚Äôt mean all of them. But if no Insurance then it‚Äôs emergency Medicaid that‚Äôs us taxpayers https://t.co/2QXNaOSqn7
That is just so true. It has to be done a certain way to the immigration to get into the country you just can‚Äôt go to border it just doesn‚Äôt work that way very well.. Specially the ones who come to deliver a baby on purpose they become legal. I‚Äôve seen it https://t.co/2QXNaOSqn7

What can I say about the shelter but they are in human people sorry people but I‚Äôm just calling it like I see it. How you can sit there and kill so many good animals you don‚Äôt like their breed you don‚Äôt want to hassle with this crap. Take a good look in the mirror https://t.co/KCPLDkIpwm

So thank you so much are you man and maybe some women who have classified as a team as a killer. It‚Äôs not being it is others owners that Love a kill.
Does anybody know what has happened to this dog.This dog was given a chance to go to 12 different state ever going to help as much as I could which means he‚Äôs very very special. So someone retweet me and tell me what is going on thank you https://t.co/QnBBHXQ1ge
So I‚Äôm asking you the American public to pay attention to your state rules and regulations and animals and each shelter it seems like a lot but you can get it all in and it one day at a time.

Sometimes I wonder if our ancestors really thought about what was gonna happen later on to the horses that helped him build this country for the dog to help save their lives. Maybe they went ahead no kids if they knew what the world was going to do https://t.co/JpaEweLpBd
So sorry this tweet is so late this is the last day but the shelters and rescues who do this who don‚Äôt care put them out two days before their death is to be carried out three If we‚Äôre lucky. When I see how the system is working for these animals are we America. https://t.co/JpaEweLpBd
OK hang on it‚Äôs not a little bit I can write about this. Why do you think police officers use them because they are that loyal do not give this dog a death sentence for just being a dog. He is much more than that if you give him a chance. https://t.co/JpaEweLpBd
OK this is a Sunday SOS I repeat a Sunday SOS by 6 PM today. The shelter either need to call a German Shepherd rescue or somebodies to go down there and get this Sad dog take him home. German Shepherd‚Äòs are very loyal so he is scared &amp;And wondering where his family is. https://t.co/GvKeLjAzss

Before they kill them. 99 % if not 100% are Pitty's. The stupid thing inthier minds are so wrong. I would want to work with them &amp; help the people to really see they are more
because we have the only shelter in our county..,I wanted to start a program to help schools lean what happens to animals, &amp; help the PitBull system there. They put up a kill list a couple days-
But I also wanted to help keep our animals safe &amp; warm, or cool.The person working doesn't know what a Misting system is! We are in AL. HOT! But I want to get enough to help the next town

I think maybe 2 of them were used, and he said that they cannot have toys because they will go under concrete wall to other dog. East fix for now (if we got $), is chicken wire under the wall.
Im afraid that I won't get much of anything. Now I got items for the dogs like toys, leashes, snacks even big tubs to get bags of dog food in, to keep off the floors.
Im not sure but I never seen results. Im scared to do a Go-Fund me account 4 our animal shelter. I had asked if others think this is the way to find $ because  the cop I talked 2, not evening care.
