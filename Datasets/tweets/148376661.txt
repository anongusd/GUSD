“She was fearless.” – Barbara Bush on her grandmother.
"Part of the reason that I work in global health is that it never occurred to me to not work on something that I could solve or put a dent in. But that was just how I was going to be in the world, and that was very much shaped by her." – Barbara Bush
“The amount of people that reached out, people who I hadn't talked to in years, saying how my grandmother touched them in different ways – it was amazing” – Ellie LaBlond Sosa
“It’s remarkable to know what kind of a maverick and adventurer she was. And that goes with reading. There’s no greater adventure than to lose yourself in a book.” - @jennabushhager
“Our grandmother never let us take the fact that our grandparents were president and first lady for granted. Yes, we might grow up in this unique set of circumstances, but you should use that to better the lives of others.” - @PierceBush https://t.co/2jqBMGvmys
“I come from a family of strong women, including my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush. Barbara Bush led our country and our family with grace and quick wit.” – Mrs. @Laurawbush
“To me that’s really what I will always remember. Her total authenticity. We have so many people who have been media trained, are so smooth. And she was who she was.” Susan Baker
Up next on Remembering Barbara Bush: Stories from her grandchildren, including @JennaBushHager, Barbara Bush. https://t.co/BoLL8QKDij
“Barbara Bush at that time helped calm the waters, so that people didn’t think we were going too far with Gorbachev, or not far enough. It was the right thing to do at the right time. She helped give a personal side to it.” - Andy Card
“I was struck by how much she cared about him and Laura. And the burden that they had to carry. It was a great privilege to be included in that relationship.” – Andy Card on Mrs. Bush’s love for her son, President George W. Bush.
“She had this motto that the success of your life is going to be judged by the relationships of your family, your friends, your coworkers, by the people you meet along the way.” – Susan Baker on her longtime friend, Mrs. Barbara Bush.
“She was the definition of love. She loved her husband unbelievably. She loved her family. She would give love, and she wasn’t afraid to give tough love. “ Andy Card on Mrs. Barbara Bush https://t.co/FsIhukDxJl
“She was funny, she could be blunt…She was a very compassionate person and always loving…We all miss her. She is going to come to life tonight for you.” President George W. Bush on his mother, Mrs. Barbara Bush.

“It’s an amazing period — to think about England battling Adolf Hitler, and the United States being tepid to engage. It’s a reminder of why isolationism is dangerous for the world.” —President Bush during the Art &amp; Leadership of Winston Churchill. Watch: https://t.co/VwaGsfrZvl
“I’m in history because I believe it is essential to where we are now. What interests me is looking at the roots of where we are now, and thinking about it historically.” - David Reynolds
“I think what Clementine did, was what very few could do, and that was to manage Winston Churchill… She could also do something that very few other people can do – and that is to tell him when he is behaving unreasonably.” @AllenPackwood
“We now think of Churchill as a great orator, but he was not first and foremost a speaker, he was first and foremost a writer.” - @AllenPackwood
“Churchill put a huge amount of effort into writing letters, but he also believed, like Roosevelt, to get up close and personal – to meet them and get a sense of them… He was a fundamental believer in personal diplomacy.” – David Reynolds on the importance of maintaining allies.
“I think this painting captures an aspect of Churchill that is not in any other paintings I have mentioned… His sense of humor, his sense of fun, and his sense of mischief…You can see his twinkle.” @AllenPackwood on President Bush’s portraits of Winston Churchill
“What you bring to the job, what you learn on the job, and what you have to live in with your conscious on the job. Those are the burdens of leadership.” David Reynolds, British historian and documentary filmmaker.
“I would argue that the two are inseparable (art and leadership). They are two complimentary parts of his great and complex personality.” – @AllenPackwood, Director of the Churchill archives @Cambridge_Uni
“I really enjoyed painting Churchill - I painted him with a lot of affection. I thought about the character of the man, his influence on history, and how much I admire him. I hope my paintings reflect that.“ - President George W. Bush on his three paintings of Winston Churchill https://t.co/nLl6qal6Xl
