@kelmej omg, i may just start this because I get it 2-3 times a year. i seem to catch it whenever i move into a new space. this is great advice!
@kelmej I got tonsillitis (i think, couldn't go to the doctor) two weeks ago and luckily my acne antibiotics I take occasionally treat it, so I made a full recovery, hahaha.
@kelmej this was me last year. worked my tail off before moving out to dc with two jobs, and then when i moved back home i worked 2 jobs and a side gig while finishing up my degree full time. that, and a whole lot of praying to hopefully have a job w health insurance some day, lol.
RT @verge: A revamped California net neutrality bill is moving forward again https://t.co/CcYAiUSvBh https://t.co/KfylH64HoI
Looks like Assemblyman Santiago is all in on these bills now.		"Let‚Äôs be very clear about what we‚Äôre doing today," Santiago says. "This is important because in no time in history have we ever demanded this kind of action faced with what we‚Äôve seen at the national level.‚Äù
"The core protections of net neutrality that were in SB 822 will be in the bill moving forward.‚Äù 		This includes:	- barring throttling, blocking access	- banning access fees	- prohibiting zero-rating services
SB 822 + SB 460 will be moving forward, @Scott_Wiener says. 		"This will be the most comprehensive and the strongest net neutrality protection in the United States where we are restoring what we lost when Donald Trump‚Äôs FCC obliterated net neutrality.‚Äù
"If you have a rock bigger than this, we‚Äôll write a story about you, too" 		It has been a very good week for wholesome Nebraska content. 	https://t.co/2WJTC7673l
