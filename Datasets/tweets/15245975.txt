For news orgs on Twitter: Don't tweet out straight headlines. Humanize them. And use hashtags, curated content. (via @marksluckie) #kipcamp
Twitter study: Journalists w/above expected follower growth send 200% more RTs compared to journalists w/below expected follower growth.
I think @marksluckie sums it up well: 'How to use Twitter: Follow, participate, create conversations, amplify, crowdsource.' #kipcamp
Use the Discover tab on Twitter? See stories that you may not know about that other people are tweeting about, says @marksluckie. #kipcamp
Tweets with media (photos, videos) receive 3x to 4x more engagement, says @marksluckie. Or, include graphics. #kipcamp
Use operators in Twitter's Advanced Search. Ex: Search for tweets with photos by including filter:images. #kipcamp
Find add'l sources using Twitter lists. Go to someone's profile and see which lists they're a member of, says @marksluckie. #kipcamp
Good reminder: During breaking news, create Lists and make them public so people can follow a variety of sources. #kipcamp
And tweets that include handles are more likely to show up in search, says @marksluckie. #kipcamp
Tip #3: Use Twitter handles to up engagement. News orgs that tweet 20% fewer URLs &amp; 100% more handles grow followers 17% more than expected.
Tip #2: Tweet your beat, says @marksluckie. Best thing to do to increase followers is to live tweet an event. #kipcamp
Tip #1: Don't be an egg. As a journo, you should use a picture of yourself as your Twitter avatar. It'll help you down the line. #kipcamp

@sona b/c there's more of a personal connection with journalists as opposed to brand pages where you don't know who is talking.
@bradbelote Regarding what type of content you should be posting to Facebook?
@sree Are you here at UNITY?
Live tweeting drives lots of followers and engagement says @marksluckie.  True, based on my experience. #UNITY12
Don't hashtag every single word. Keep the hashtag short, relevant, says @marksluckie #UNITY12
What should you be posting on Facebook? @lavrusik: Content that people want to talk about; photos are most popular content on FB. #UNITY12
Good advice from @Lavrusik: Be careful about having back and forth debates on Facebook. #UNITY12. I'm guilty of this. Take it up IRL.
Be vigilant about what you're posting on social networks, says @marksluckie. Lesson #1: Don't tweet when you're drunk. #UNITY12
According to Facebook data, journalists have far higher engagement with users than brand pages, says @lavrusik. #UNITY12
@JudyLinAP You, too. Come up to Seattle sometime!

@evonnebenedict @jbertrand So, notice your short links now (and from earlier today?)
@fleurdelaura1 Haha. That's OK. Just wondering. You were witnessing history!
Wondering why custom short URLs are tweeting out as t.co links. @bitly says it's a definitely a bug.
@bitly OK. Some of us were thinking it had something to do with Twitter's new analytics system.
@bitly Thanks. Wondering if it's a permanent thing ...
@jbertrand @evonnebenedict Ah, yes. Had that happen many times.
@evonnebenedict @jbertrand Thanks, guys. Unrealted, but another frustrating thing is not being able to copy/paste short URLs.
@jbertrand Argh. So now what? No more short URL?
@bitly How come my custom short URLs are defaulting to t.co in Twitter and Tweetdeck?
@fleurdelaura1 So cool! You didn't get a picture by any chance, did you?
@mrbrandonroth You're welcome. Glad you enjoyed. And thanks for the reminder to put a disclaimer in the next set of contest rules. Ha.

@wpsocialreader How is your social reader populated with stories from Reuters, AP, etc? Is someone on your end populating it?

@Lavrusik Thanks. Can't wait. This looks good.
@wxprobrian Andthe mobile view is pretty slick.

@julienegrin Re: #FeelTheWeight. We'll address cooking in tomorrow's chat from noon to 1. Hope you can join. http://t.co/ThyfZqx
Get Excel style sparklines in your tweet. Cool! Thx @sharonpianchan http://t.co/CrA1ott
@sclary And totally unrelated, but I have a good Ladies Who Lunch update for you!
@sclary Me, too. For some reason, I like being able to see peoples' Twitter backgrounds and full profiles on t.com.
@sclary I wonder if there isn't that much support for twitter.com becausse fewer people use it? I rarely have issues w/TweetDeck. Hmm..
@halfbrown @twitter So weird. Everytime I log into twitter.com from FF I can't see my main timeline. Sometimes I can't see/send tweets.
@sclary Even Chrome has issues? Great. The only browser I haven't had issues with lately inre: twitter.com is IE.
@manevaldes Man, Firefox and I were once good friends. Now, we're on the rocks. Going Chrome if this is the case!
@memelaroo OK, so it's not just me. Even Explorer is working better than Firefox right now inre: Twitter support. Argh.
Is it just me, or does anyone else have issues using twitter.com in firefox? can't send or see tweets sometimes.
@MichaelScott81 HAHA. I love the expression you're rocking!
@pewresearch I'm looking for the report on traffic to news sites from social sites. Do you have that link handy? Thanks.
@normalguyguide @joeruiz Thank you. I knew I always liked you and your pearly white teeth.
@joeruiz Fine. But FYI @normalguyguide, we're not talking about Normal Guy cooking. We're talking Iron Chef.
@msalgado @charlesgonzalez @SneakerKEDA @Brizzyc @joeruiz Think Iron Chef Battle of the Masters. No recipes, they just know what's good!
@charlesgonzalez @joeruiz BUT, would you be able to at least judge it on whether you think it'll taste good?

@wildfireapp OK. I've been trying to make sure I actually loaded the contest onto the Sweepstakes tab on my FB page.
@wildfireapp Will a contest show up on your Facebook page only after it's live? Trying to see if I successfully connected it w/my Fan page.

@nwpassage1 Thanks! Some really great items there. @Veeves did a video, it'll be on our site tomorrow. Will you make it to @EMPSFM?
@evonnebenedict That's how I feel when my home internet stops working...

@oskargarcia It must be a busy day for you ... good luck!
@mjenkins Great. Thank you.
@swinkstylebar Oh, @RavennaBlog, you are far too kind ...
@emmacarew @maiphoang Producers. Mostly me.
@mjenkins Hey. Quick question. Was it TBD that uses All Our Ideas? Thank you!
@emmacarew @maiphoang Me neither. But I agree it's a great way to show goodwill to a colleague.
@emmacarew @maiphoang Indeed. They are so important and sometimes really hard to understand/navigate.
@maiphoang YES! Totally. That is a great personal policy to have. Also, never assume anything is totally private.
@emmacarew @maiphoang But knowing more about Friend Lists, I want to start showing them that they can still maintain privacy with 1 profile.
@emmacarew @maiphoang I don't think a lot of other folks in the newsroom use their Facebook profiles for both.
@maiphoang @emmacarew Defintely. I'm all for Friending sources because it's just another way for me to connect with them.
@maiphoang Yeah, I think it really helps journos use their Facebook profiles for work/personal -- as long as you're careful.
@emmacarew @maiphoang Friend Lists lets you accept requests and put them directly into a List. So, yeah, I'd Friend sources.
@emmacarew But isn't two accounts a violation of the TOS? I struggle with that. Plus, it's more management ... ?
@emmacarew Totally. I just didn't *get* it until I played around with them. Let me know if you find any other uses.
@nicknewman801 Yeah, just had an aha moment with Friend Lists. I owe you an email. It's sitting in my Draft box. Will get at you shortly.
@MichaelScott81 Step away from the espresso. Sincerely, your caretaker. Ping if you need help!
Facebook Friend Lists are the most underutilized FB feature for journos. Why didn't I realize this earlier? Ugh. #KipCamp

@jeremycaplan What program did you use to create your presentation? I'd guess Google, but ...
@evonnebenedict Handy tip, right? :)
Tip via @AdamS: If you manage more than one Twitter account, always make sure you know which one you‚Äôre logged into. #KipCamp
Also, don't forget the power of Tweet buttons and the liiiitle blue T you can stick anywhere on your website. http://bit.ly/hh7Vdb #KipCamp

Google Docs can be used like @googlewave. And collaborators don't need logins, can upload media. Also a chat tool. #KipCamp
@oskargarcia I guess this conversation goes back to the flexibility of Google Forms, yes?
Use Google Docs as a crowdsourcing tool, says @jeremycaplan. Have folks contribute to a document, story, etc? Hmm ... #KipCamp
@emmacarew @cjsinner So, anyone on your staff that uses evernote has access to your scanned directory?
@emmacarew What has it been most helpful for?
Good tips from @Poynter on how journos can use @GoogleVoice to improve their reporting: http://bit.ly/hfDvKz #KipCamp
Going to give @evernote a try. It has OCR so if you take a picture of an article, a search for keywords will put it up. Cool. #KipCamp
@twistory Of course! FYI @jeremycaplan brought up Twistory in a @KipCamp presentation about organizing your digital life.
@DougHaddix Thank you so much for your great preso yesterday. You're a great teacher. Stop by @seattletimes if you're ever in town!
Add your Twitter backlog feed to your favorite calendar application using @Twistory. What could this be used for? #KipCamp
Use @gmail Boomerang as follow-up tool. Have a message resurface if you haven't heard from its recipient. (h/t @jeremycaplan) #KipCamp
@petersmeg Great, thanks! Definitely going to try it. We're also talking about @WiseStamp.
Email app @rapportive shows you Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter info of your contacts. Anyone tried this? #KipCamp
.@jeremycaplan says he sometimes has to be reminded to eat lunch. I may forget a lot of things, but meals isn't one of them #KipCamp
On managing e-mail: If it's a task you can do in two minutes, just do it. If you defer, you'll waste time later. #KipCamp
Do you set aside a couple days every so often to organize your digital life? It might be helpful. #KipCamp
Via @jeremycaplan: Empty your mind, put everything in a streamlined system and free up your mind for thought. #KipCamp
Tools that help you stay focused: @googlechrome plugin StayFocusd shows how much time you have left for an online activity. #KipCamp
One strategy for staying sane & calm: gain awareness w/time maps, timers such as @rescuetime, @toggldevel. #KipCamp
On the #KipCamp agenda today: Streamlining your digital life (w/@jeremycaplan). Then meeting with John Glenn.

Another +1 for @documentcloud: It's embeddable. Hooray for things that are embeddable. #KipCamp
#KipCamp fellow @USATODAYMBello used it for a DC test score story http://usat.ly/hwO82c // This is how you add context.

RT @romenesko: FYI@seattletimes is looking for "a hard-driving, enterprising reporter" to cover Microsoft. http://journ.us/e3RIGu
Great way to keep track of a conversation RT @cdperiodismo Crea un PDF con los tweets de un evento http://goo.gl/4Zo1z
@lilsheba Not at all! Maybe we should all show up.
@lilsheba @gabbycat @gawlowski http://www.seattlecricket.com/
@normalguyguide Hahaha. Wait a minute! I'm not saying that! @joeruiz
@gawlowski @gabbycat It's on. Time to start designing the jerseys!
@normalguyguide I think I once told @joeruiz that I thought his friend Dale was cute.
@Intersect At @OhioState. 24 fellows, all mid-career journos, looking to integrate SM into workflow. #KipCamp
@gabbycat Thanks! 1.2 billion people are indeed rejoicing today!
INDIA! INDIA! IN-DI-A!! YES!!
@normalguyguide @joeruiz HAHA. I used to think he was a preppy boy with bleached teeth.
@bernardkuhn Right. Also, how many newsrooms have enough resources to send out multiple folks to one event?
Why use Google Forms over Reader Feedback tool for collecting crowdsourced info? Ease of use, flexibility. #KipCamp
@Intersect gets a showing at #KipCamp. http://t.co/tkH6axK
@bernardkuhn Remembering this convo from the other night. @katierogers brings up good point about showing by doing. It works. #KipCamp
Up now @KipProgram: @washingtonpost's @katierogers talking social engagement. #KipCamp
Sending good vibes to India today, especially @sachin_rt. Jai Hind. #indvssl #wc2011
@evonnebenedict Wow. There's gotta be an archive somewhere?
@memelaroo Thanks (again!) Trying to mix crowdsourcing with a little something for folks who take time to contribute.
@memelaroo @evonnebenedict Thank you!
Help @seattletimes build its Nirvana timeline http://seati.ms/STNirvana. And we'll reward you. Great design, @sclary!
@henrymlopez Trying to :)
@mjenkins Thank you! Great preso @KipProgram #KipCamp
@sethporges To clarify, I was talking about the number of scans, based on metrics from @bitlybundles.
@sethporges That wasn't the case for us. I mean, it can definitely get better and I think it will.
@sethporges I think t's better than printing a link in the paper.
This is how @seattletimes shared curated links in print http://bit.ly/htS0fn. Yes, I love QR codes. #KipCamp (thx, @darlakrusee)
@tanvinhseattle Can you help her out? RT @seattlewinegal Can anyone recommend a great happy hour tonight in the Kirkland, WA area?
Use a bookmarking site to organize, embed shared link roundups, says @mjenkins. I'm still a fan of @bitlybundles, tho. #KipCamp
So true. RT @typewriterninja Not to mention the changes they *don't* announce #KipCamp
I think every FB user should evaluate his or her Privacy Settings every few months, or after FB announces changes. #KipCamp
Friend Lists are an underutilized feature on FB, says @mjenkins // Yes, great for journos concerned about privacy. #KipCamp
@rojo72 That's cool. We should talk. I want to try that @seattletimes. #KipCamp
@BizJournalism Thank you for the #FF!
Via @mjenkins: You can't just take things from FB. You need to track down who took that photo before you put it in the paper. #KipCamp
@chcktylr Interesting use of crowdsourcing. What do you think about the approach?
Up next @KipProgram, community engagement with @mjenkins. #KipCamp
The @chicagotribune uses Trib Nation to talk about the back story. // This is engagement. http://bit.ly/9pT44a (h/t @beckyyerak) #KipCamp
.@NPRLuis, sr. editor for diversity @NPR is @KipProgram. How do we use SM to reach out to minority groups? #KipCamp
@Brizzyc Great. Thanks. Will definitely check it out.
@Brizzyc What's #ISOJ?
Regarding my last tweet, newspapers could try a similar idea to preview upcoming projects, stories. Yes? No? #KipCamp
Search #AiWeiWei to see how @frontlinepbs tweeted installments of an upcoming segment at the same time every day. Cool idea. #KipCamp
@emmacarew Thanks! It is. Lots of great minds here. Check out the program @KipProgram #KipCamp
Example of how @CNN uses tweets in coverage: http://bit.ly/a7FAko. Wonder if there's any way to integrate video? #KipCamp (h/t @rojo72)
@scrowell Thanks for tuning in. So far, so good. We're talking Facebook today. What do you want to know? #KipCamp
Should I quote from Twitter, Facebook? @BetsyHubbard says check with your legal team. #KipCamp // Ask about photos, too.
@nikolajlasbo We finish up on Wednesday. I mean, I miss you guys, but I don't want to leave :)
@nikolajlasbo I miss you guys!
@USATODAYMBello @NPRLuis And #3, never get off an airplane without knowing the name, something about the family of the person next to you.
@oskargarcia Are you Mayor yet?
@henrymlopez By the way, I miss you, buddy! Being here has brought back many Maynard memories.
@USATODAYMBello Haha. Next time I'll have you turn around ... and smile!
.@acarvin uses Lists as a primary source of monitoring and moves them around based on what's news at the moment. #KipCamp
@kimbui @webjournalist @henrymlopez I raised my hand up high when we were asked who had heard of it or participated. You'd be proud :)
@wchat Got some love at #KipCamp http://twitpic.com/4feg7u @kimbui @webjournalist @henrymlopez
@nicknewman801 Thanks for your e-mail. I will respond soon, promise! Yes, def. follow along if you can. There will be videos, too.
@acarvin Thank you for taking our questions. Keep up the great work. #KipCamp
"Twitter like the rest of SM is an economy based on sharing and generosity. It's not rocket science, it's talking to people." #KipCamp
Via @acarvin: "The worst time to start a Twitter feed is in the middle of a breaking news story." Be there on day 1. // Yes. #KipCamp
@nicknewman801 I like @acarvin's advice on Listing key players early on, finding hashtags early on. So smart. #KipCamp
Twitter is serving as my producers, translators and editors -- @acarvin. So powerful. #KipCamp
Start creating lists around key players early on to get a head start on finding hashtags. Great advice from @acarvin. #KipCamp
Once hashtags become part of the mainstream, @acarvin says he gives up on them. Ex. Search for #Libya and you'll get 1K tweets a minute.
We're Skyping with @acarvin in a bit. Questions for him? #KipCamp
@maiphoang @gteresa Thank you. But see, I assume people notice that we're engaging. But alas, it's just an assumption.
@gteresa @maiphoang I see your point. I guess I haven't seen the need because if folks go to @seattletimes, they'll see that we're talking.
@evonnebenedict Pros: Followers know someone is there to listen, respond. Cons: Be careful what you have on your personal account ... ?
@gteresa It's the @KipProgram social media fellowship @OhioState. There are 24 fellows here. #KipCamp
@gteresa @mcbc You make great points, especially re: keeping your personal account clean. That's so key. #KipCamp
@slolguin I admit I haven't scanned it. What does it take you to?
@mcbc @NewsHour That's one way. it doesn't hurt, right? It's good for your followers to know that someone's listening, replying. #KipCamp
Should news orgs on Twitter have "tweets by @ ..." in their bio? I've always been iffy. @NewsHour has a good approach, tho. #KipCamp
@coryhaik @keanearino Indeed. @katierogers, too ... soon. #KipCamp
@coryhaik You're famous at #KipCamp :) http://t.co/E2LauLq
@CassVinograd Have fun covering the #royalwedding. Looking forward to seeing your work!

@NewsTrain Any chance I can get a copy of the most recent APME magazine mailed to me? I think they're being sent to an old address. Thanks!
@slolguin Nice avatar, Serg ...
@YvonneReports Don't you think @oskargarcia would get a lot out of @foursquare, especially on his beat?
@LeoShane Nope, that's OK. You were paying attention and taking detailed notes for future reference, riiight? :)
Great first day @KipProgram & confab w/@natetobey of @frontlinepbs on engaging w/readers. Lots of good ideas here. #KipCamp
@oskargarcia Haha. It is yet another distraction, but some day, SOME day, it'll be useful, promise.
@YvonneReports Hi, lady! Chatted with @oskargarcia earlier today. Lots to learn from him :) Hope you're well.
@natetobey 'NCAA Athletes and Money' special is on @HBOSports right now. What a coincidence ...
@BizJournalism Will there be a live stream?

@paulbalcerak Good seeing you! You and @gawlowski should be West Seattle buddies.
@evonnebenedict Always good to see you. Thanks for the intro to @Greg_Guenther!

@jonah_kessel It's all so surreal. Watching from my living room and just can't believe what I'm seeing.
@michellestrub Sorry. I wish I could help you upload it somehow. Can you get it into YouTube?
@jonah_kessel Be safe. Do you need to make any phone calls to people here? I can help w/anything if you need it.
@michellestrub What are they telling you? I mean, are you allowed to go out or just hunkered down inside? Curious.
@dabouncemaui Sending positive thoughts your way. Stay safe and thank you!

Looks good so far. RT @lavrusik: Watching Live: Facebook's major messages announcement - http://on.mash.to/9vPkqw
@normalguyguide You should be able to use Advance Search parameters in TweetDeck, including location.
@joeruiz pancakes for you on the counter.
@erikalc What grain roast thing?
@joeruiz @petersmeg Um, there's no turkey allowed at that address.
@SuziSteffen I'd want to manage FB Pages, tag folks in FB Status updates. Could also use its own TweetDeck-style URL shortener.
@SuziSteffen Started yesterday. It's distracting, but great for those who are always plugged into FB. Needs enhancements, though.
@webjournalist Ken says 'Yo, teach!'
@typewriterninja Hi, Marc. We need a Fund for the Needy story (says @nicolebrodeur). Ken says he'll shoot.
Doing a Twitter session with @seattletimes reporters. Say hi!
@jmestepa Yes. I've had my share of bachelorette parties this year ... hope you end up having fun!
@jmestepa Wait, it's supposed to be a fun weekend ... ?
@petersmeg Twitter works now!
@petersmeg I'd also be worried about someone using my computer while it was open. It could be dangerous. Haha.
@petersmeg I'm always on FB, so I like having everything in one place. You can't manage pages, though (yet?).
@petersmeg Ah, @rockmelt said it's having issues w/Twitter & they're working on it.
@petersmeg OK. How do you like it so far?
Trying out @RockMelt. Having trouble connecting with Twitter. Anyone else have that issue?

@williampd ha ... :/
@williampd So, which one's more appealing?
@Kris_Bowman That's awesome. Who's teaching these courses?
Back from a weekend in the Midwest. There's a whole lotta nothing in Iowa...
@jbertrand @wsdot Thanks.
@anjalimullany No problem. Did you get both of those? University of Maryland College Park and Mizzou.
@Poynter @lavrusik answered my question afterwards. Thank you, though.
@lavrusik Great. Thanks. I missed most of your answer because the livstream ad started playing during your response to my Q. Go figure! #p35
@maiphoang Asking on behalf of someone who asked! @anjalimullany :)
@maiphoang @MAlexJohnson says University of Maryland. @tanvinhseattle says Mizzou.
@MAlexJohnson @tanvinhseattle Great. Thank you. @leswalker UMBC or College Park?
@Poynter Another Q for @lavrusik -- On selling social space to advertisers - Does it comply with Twitter's TOS? #p35
@Poynter Q for @lavrusik -- Do you have examples of news organizations offering contests in adbuys? #p35
Anyone know of any colleges besides Columbia that offer courses in Social Media?
@emmacarew Sounds fun! Have a great time.
@emmacarew I so don't mean this in a mean way, but ... why!?
@Kim_Minugh Oh, OK. I'm just imagining the possibilities :)
@Kim_Minugh Wow. What did you hear?
@maiphoang Just had a chance to look at your @Storify timline. I like it. It's really well-curated. And there's an actual story.
I was hoping 'shellacking' would make it into a headline. Nice, @washingtonpost.
Election night - done! Now trying to catch up with elex news from my hoods -- Orange County, LA & San Luis Obispo.
@josieliming OK, trough feeding sounds good. You should have seen the line for food. It was like a polling place line! Well, almost :)
#waelex and #wasen are climbing the list on trendsmap.com.  The countdown begins ...
@maiphoang Great. Best of luck to you. Let us know how it goes!
Co-worker @gawlowski just asked me what the hashtag is for Election Night pizza. Any news folks wanna weigh in?
Just scrolled through @twittermedia timeline -- lots of top news orgs doing some cool stuff for #vote2010.

@tidbitbistro Trying to make reservations on tweservation but it doesn't seem to be working. Any other way I can get a table for Tues night?

@niketa So, I can watch the stream on Facebook? Where?
@petersmeg What do you think about the new features in general?
@Martha_Kang Unfortunately won't be able to make it because I'll be out of town. We should catch up soon!
@petersmeg Totally :) Looking forward to Groups - It'll save so much time when crafting Events, Invites, etc. It's SO about saving seconds!
@petersmeg No doubt, smaller groups are good for the average user. But there's a lot of potential for brands if they can group their Fans.
Liking the concept behind FB groups but not so much the idea of small groups. Good for personal, but not for brands. Hmm ... #fblive
Voting for @AAJA secretary starts today and @TimaMedia's on the ballot http://bit.ly/TimaSecy -- Vote. #aaja

@acarvin These results = good stuff! Thanks for sharing.

Is there a program out there that e-mails you when someone tweets?
@atthelake214 No clear path, unfortunately.. If you're comfortable with riding in traffic, go for it! More than half of the ride is non-path

Mile 25 of Lake Washington ride-- Juanita Bay. http://twitpic.com/2rvtwh
@gabbycat I just saw the spider pic. It looks like a tarantula! Also, Rainier looks like it's painted in. Absolutely gorgeous.
Attempting 70 miles around Lake Washington tomorrow -- trying to see if I'm cut out for a double century ride next year. Already tired ...
@WordSmithette Do I even have to answer that? :)
@Martha_Kang Cool. Haven't had Greek since moving to Seattle. And it's right by my place!
@paulbalcerak Wait, what gyros? Where?!
@jmestepa Totally. I learned that the hard way when I lived in wine country. This is where having a vineyard connection really helps.
Whatever happened to @facebook's Advanced Search? #facebook

@TMobile And the reboot just requires taking the battery out and restarting the phone?
@TMobile OK Thanks. And I'm on an HTC Magic now.
@TMobile I had to take the battery out and reboot. That worked. But this has never happened so I'm not sure what's going on ... Thanks.
@TMobile I can't make any calls and I have no 3G. And I need my phone to work right now. What's going on? 98109 is my zip. DT Seattle.

@semilshah Maybe you can somehow pay it forward :)
@danielhewitt Mmmhmm. I saw it on WaPo, though, so I can't take credit for an OG idea!
@simplyseema I love your snack/food ideas. They're great!
@TMobile 98109. Downtown Seattle. I had no signal for about an hour last night. But all is good now. Thanks for responding.
@gabbycat Nice to see you tonight! Thanks for coming out.
@TMobile Are there outages right now? No reception or 3G.
@maiphoang Yeah, definitely. Next time you're in town I can offer you some tips on that -- and about sourcing on FB in general.
Phew. #onasea/#wjchat live stream is over. Thanks for participating, everyone. Livestream to be archived soon.
@maiphoang Definitely don't manage multiple accounts. Use your personal profile and take advantage of FB Privacy Settings. #onasea
Q8: Bloggers, reporters can get on every 2-3 hours to acknowledge a thread; But you don't have to engage everyone. #wjchat
#wjchat Q8: Acknowledge the criticism. It's a conversation, right? But don't spend ALL your time trying to respond to everything.
So, @kirklapointe says he knows journos who friend sources, but have 'decoy' friends to throw others off. [Consider this, folks] #onasea
@TimaMedia He added: Don't spend ALL your time trying to respond. Choose your battles, I guess. Just don't be on the sidelines. #onasea
When building a community on SM, @kirklapointe reminds us that 'you have to prove yourself to this crowd. it's a different dialect.' #onasea
Those new to SM are building a new audience. You've gotta tell SM newbies that they're building a community from scratch. #onasea
Its important to say who you are in your Twitter bio, says @makrbriggs. it gives folks an idea of what you‚Äôre tweeting about. #onasea
How do you deal w/readers who attack u through Twitter? @kirklapointe says don‚Äôt be silent. Acknowledge. It‚Äôs a conversation, right? #onasea
@markbriggs says @lavrusik is someone to follow for good tweets on journalism-meets-tech. // I agree :) #onasea
Q4: Panelists offer a couple tips for tweeting journos: Don't diss your employer. And, be careful about your commentary on the news. #wjchat
SM really enables transparency, says @markbriggs. Our audience desperately wants that from us; They want to be part of the process. #onasea
So, when is it OK to live tweet? "Use your general discretion. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should," says @markbriggs. #onasea
Consider how much your audience can take and how much they need, when it comes to live tweeting, says @markbriggs. #wjchat
Journalists that maintain a good balance on Twitter: @jayrosen_nyu, @jdlasica, @jeffjarvis says @kirklapointe. #wjchat
Consider your followers/following, especially when you're data mining. @kirklapointe says he's transparent with Twitter folks. #wjchat
Journalists have always been about publishing, broadcasting. But there has to be a different mix, says @markbriggs. #wjchat
On the panel tonight: @nancyleson of @seattletimes; @kirklapointe from @VancouverSun & @markbriggs from @KING5Seattle
And we're on with 'You Are What You Tweet' -- Anyone participating in #wjchat should direct Qs to our panel via @sclary.
@Martha_Kang Wow. You're right down the street! OK -- we haven't started yet. See you in a bit.
Getting started with the #onasea/#wjchat livestream 'You Are What You Tweet' in a bit. Pardon all the tweets in the next hour or so.
@Martha_Kang Where are you? I'm in front!

@ckanal Oh, totally. Glad to see it. In this case, the use of 'juuuust' totally paints a picture.

@nancyleson Just saw that Season 6 is available in my Instant Queue. Thanks!

@nancyleson Hmm -- Can I snag that for a day or so after you're done? :)
@danielhewitt Any chance you'll be joining the 'you are what you tweet' event tomorrow? Might find some useful stuff for your SM strategy...
@danielhewitt Haha. Can't complain. This one made me laugh. Looking forward to more! How are you?
