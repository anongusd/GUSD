@OscarRunnerUp A strong group. I‚Äôd go with:		1. Ali (Moonlight)	2. Simmons	3. Rylance	4. Plummer	5. Bale	6. Leto	7. Ali- Green Book	8. Waltz	9. Rockwell
@AwardsConnect @OscarRunnerUp I loved Mahershala Ali as the philandering opera-loving plumber in Moonstruck üòâ
@NextBestPicture I predicted Grant but am not unhappy that Mahershala won
@NextBestPicture That was not a strong argument for keeping Make-up televised next year
@AwardsConnect Bette Davis - Jezebel	George Sanders- All About Eve	Geraldine Page - The Trip to Bountiful 	Jeremy Irons - Reversal of Fortune	Mahershala Ali- Moonlight
@TRUMANCAPOTE10 @BobbyRiversTV Page won for her best performance in Trip to Bountiful. As you watch it, you can see her accumulated years of excellence condensed into one brilliant, heart-breaking performance. It‚Äôs one of my favorite Best Actress winners ever
@MuseofIre B/c he stinks!!
@MuseofIre If I recall, Col. Earhart‚Äôs is trying to impress Professor Siletsky with a joke he has heard amongst the Polish people. The joke being even small talk can get Nazis in trouble with The big boss.
