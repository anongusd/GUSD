@jamesthayslett @RevCavs Don't quit trying. It took most of my life to find the right therapy. I literally was seeing four therapists at the same time just to pick the right one. And I am very pleased with the changes she has helped me make in my life.

@RevCavs @jamesthayslett It took me literally years to find the right therapist. There is some really great new PTSD therapies now that weren't around even 10 years ago. Maybe the answer is to find one outside of the VA but hopefully they will pay for the therapy. They should.
@RevCavs @jamesthayslett A good therapist that he can relate to is a MUST. Even if you have to visit several to find the right one!
@RevCavs @jamesthayslett Contact your local mental health association or a referral through a therapist. Different states have different resources. Tell him he will be in my thoughts and that I wish him well! He can beat this! ~Royal

8)8 It’s been said many times and it’s true..What you buy, accumulate and end up with is not what counts in the end. It’s what you’ve given..~Royal 🌸
7)8 ...even if it was just a speech I made about over coming traumas in your life or if I’m delivering sleeping bags and tents to the homeless, or that I cared enough to help those that wouldn’t get to eat that day.
6)8 Because my main goal in life isn’t to be rich and famous so I can snub people with my nose in the air as if I’m somehow better than them, but to instead leave a legacy that I made someone’s day a little bit better...
5)8 I will always help people and none of my charities will ever suffer. I’ll be working at them for free until I no longer physically can. I hope others take my place to do the same once I am no longer on this earth.
4)8 My assistant always remarks that I could be a millionaire if I didn’t volunteer so much of my time for free and used that time for work. Nothing will ever change that in me tho. To do that would be to change who I am.
3)8 No matter how much life knocks you down you get right back up and keep on keeping on. Nothing makes me happier than to see people succeed and that goes for myself as well.
2)8 Anything is attainable if you set your mind to it by setting and meeting daily goals. My sister Betty (Sissy) told me this would happen years ago. That blows me away now. My daughter of course isn’t surprised and said that’s you mom!
1)8 Another beautiful sunset, and a truly awesome day as I expand my production company even further than I’d ever hoped. If you’re reading this and think time has passed you by or it’s too late..think again. Cont

The best kind of success is when you’ve achieved it with absolutely no help or money from anyone other than yourself. No husband/boyfriend/relatives. Just your own hard work. So many people brag about their success when it’s only came with lots of help and $ from others. 💯

Live your own life not somebody else’s. If they live in a certain state doesn’t mean you need to follow them there. If they sing that doesn’t mean you are a singer.

4/4 This one incident not only affected Hawaii &amp; it’s citizens but the whole world as we now know how little time we would all have if something like this ever happened for real. Make every day count people. Love &amp; live each day as if it was your last. Love to all~Royal❤️ ♥️
3/4 Despite no support or comfort from our president (did anybody 	really expect him to be presidential?) I’m so proud of the governor and other officials who did come together to comfort the people of Hawaii.
2/4 I can’t believe our President didn’t even speak to the state of Hawaii, no words of comfort or anything about the false alarm missile. He instead used that time to take jabs at Democrats.
1/4 Thank you Honolulu/Waikiki, our fans and thanks to my band for a great gig even after all everybody has went through today (actually yesterday now). It was truly nice to see everybody come together despite of it all for some great music.

What do you stand for? You are more than your career, your relationship, etc. Stand for something in life. That’s what truly defines you. https://t.co/yIvocU0BM5
It’s more like 1 or 2 people I can truly trust tho. People, I’ve learned in this life, are only basically worried about themselves &amp; are not giving enough to actually think of others, to make sure they’re ok or even a lonely person dying of loneliness. A phone call costs nothing. https://t.co/JONlqt5wPy

5:5 My Twitter page is more like a public page for family &amp; my music 🎼 &amp; art 🎨 friends but I still don’t put out everything for public view. I think they’re going to do an electrocardiograph &amp; scan of my heart next just to make sure before the surgery. Much love ~Royal ♥️
4/5 And likewise I don’t put the business mechanisms of my company or my next business decision on here either. Too many trolls wanting to know your every move and sadly to use your business or creative ideas for themselves.
3/5 I don’t even use those pages for business much although I get a ton of DMs. Too many trolls wanting to know your business. A film maker or corporation doesn’t put everything they’re doing on Social Media,
2/5 and a brother at age 57), just to make sure. They haven’t found anything wrong yet tho and I hope they don’t. Just letting my friends and family know because they’re asking about it via DM. Remember I don’t put all of my private business on Twitter or Facebook.
1/5 They’re going to be doing a few more tests on my heart before they will do my surgery because of a strong family history of heart problems (my birth mother is dying right now of congestive heart failure) and early deaths in the family by heart attacks (a sister at age 55
