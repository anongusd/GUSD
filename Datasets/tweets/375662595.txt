Emily: you are dong a lot that benfits your clients.	 Wehrum "We are not doiing a lot of things my previous clients want us to do."	Yes, Wehrum is a smart guy.
Wehrum agrees he can be a polarizing figure. "I call balls &amp; strikes as I see them,  "It is important to understand the law &amp; apply it correctly." Saysihis goal to protect the public health and environment, despite what environmental groups say. See this: https://t.co/DTYhvZMwR8
Why should public trust you are being objective, Emily Holden asks, given that Wehrum represented coal burning utilities and oil industry and refineries before he took this job, fighting the same rules he is now revoking with his own pen?
Here is story by NYT on the topic of Mercury rule from December. https://t.co/NZfkRC0ZAj
Emily Holden gets at the core of why EPA is revising Mercury rule. Industry does not like cost and benefit analysis used to justify it, to prevent federal government from adopting future environmental regulations that limit air pollution. Wehrum essentially agrees.
Wehrum attempts to explain the mercury rule is "not appropriate and necessary," because of the costs and don't have an obligation to regulate it. But he says the agency is still committed to regulating mercury. Yes, this is what they have been saying and both things can be true
Wehrum: "There is misunderstanding about what we are doing," he says. "Misreporting" Don't expect any mercury air pollution controls in place to be turned off, as a result of revisions. So why in  world would you propose to revisit the rule, he says: because we had done it wrong.
Wehrum really wants to talk about the revisions to EPA Mercury rule, which EPA bosses feel that reporters have mischaracterized. Tells Emily Holden of the Guardian that he wants his chance to discuss MATS as it is known.
Wehrum says Obama's Clean Power Plan--which he is now working to repeal--was fundamentally flawed. And asserts it is not fair to compare Trump-era EPA plan to Obama plan, even though EPA itself admitted net difference is more deaths in the United States.
EPA air policy boss Bill Wehrum discusses choice EPA faces on climate change. Says his agenda and EPA's is working to "regulate correctly" re CO2. Reducing carbon emissions is a goal. But it is not agency's only priority. And he is still learning abt climate change, he says https://t.co/32698g16qH

Finally, this past week, @JohnBranchNYT and I looked at WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? It's not esoteric. Chlorpyrifos is still in use.  Farm workers are still getting sick. Children still being exposed. It is not all tweets in Trump era.  https://t.co/dajAenzo0E
Then @dannyhakim and I examined how EPA is second guessing the use of epidemiology--the science of using observation to evaluate risk. WHY? The pesticide industry fears use of this basic science by EPA to make rules might mean its products are banned. https://t.co/okLyrV88YW
Then we stepped back and did a deep dive in Oct. 2017 on how there had been a radical shift at the EPA since Trump in terms of how it is evaluating and regulating toxic chemicals and pesticides. Chlorpyrifos was part of the shift. https://t.co/2NwIrjYE8E
Then @RoniNYTimes and I got the EPA emails that showed how Pruitt in early 2017 had promised the farmers that use the pesticide he was there ready to help them. Emails also showed how EPA staff advice was rejected. 	https://t.co/pzmGtJybwC
Here are some of those stories, if you missed them.  First, Pruitt rejects his own staff recommendations and decides not to ban the pesticide.	https://t.co/S5zkwXt53J
The NYT has written a great deal abt Chlorpyrifos since 2017, after Pruitt vetoed staff &amp; decided not to ban it, despite evidence it's hurting farm workers/children.

Re now repealed Stream Protection Rule, mines in West Va that have been subject to a permit revision since 2016 will no longer have to indefinitely monitor water discharge impact on like insects and fish. i.e. "biologic" monitoring. Areas like this will see more polluted streams. https://t.co/eP9W0ib5yt
So what does this mean? Of approximately 80 power plants in the US that were going to have to upgrade water pollution controls as a result of EPA rule, about 2/3s of them have stopped design and planning work. Here is what they were GOING to do.  (One company's version) Now??? https://t.co/QSqIeu25us
Congress meanwhile moves to kill Interior's Stream Protection rule. President Trump holds a celebration at the White House, with coal miners lined up behind him. https://t.co/AOLGgIffLL https://t.co/9cvZdtDgL0
SO WHAT IS PRUITT GOING TO DO? And how about CONGRESS? Protect the rivers? OR address the industry concerns?  This email is an answer. Who does Pruitt's chief of staff write to tell him EPA moving to stop a WATER POLLUTION RULE? THE NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION lobbyist of course. https://t.co/9cPr6e86bL

Kanawha River, W Va. largest inland river is one of those rivers that had been severely hurt by decades of abuse by humans. Human waste, power plants, coal mine runoff, industrial pollution, etc. A MESS. Here is EPA report from 70s https://t.co/7NQcBSSTde

SO WHAT DOES TRUMP EPA DO? It rejects the Obama-era plan. Essentially says  don't need to upgrade air pollution controls, meaning six surviving coal plants in Texas no longer will have to install scrubbers. Instead, it sets an overall cap for S02 in Tx that is higher than current https://t.co/ZOIQzBVGj5
But utility companies and state of Texas objected. Called the Obama plan too demanding, too expensive, unnecessary, as SO2 emissions already in decline in Texas. National Mining Association (coal mining industry) objected too, saying this would force the shutdown of coal plants https://t.co/vNHXAFvkDz
Obama EPA concluded that Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) upgrades at these nine plants would eliminate 190,000 tons a year of SO2=or more than any other state produces, except Texas.  Here is description of that plan. https://t.co/W07wOyYkbo

But Scott Pruitt arrived at EPA and decided to reverse that recommendation, after Dow Chemical, the manufacturer, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and leaned in with EPA to protest the effort to ban the pesticide. https://t.co/bZuhCDHhTc
The EPA had spent nearly a decade studying chlorpyrifos after getting a petition urging it to ban the pesticide. And by 2016 it had reached its verdict. It needed to be banned. The pesticide did not meet US food safety standards. EPA moved to remove it from the market. https://t.co/22LBnzyq0E

First, let me apologize in a stand alone tweet for so many tweets on this story re how Trump era impact on air and water in the US. I realize some of you may think too many tweets by me.  But I want this story to be widely read. And tweeting helps. Also lot to explain.
WSJ makes a similar point in today's paper. Flaring is surging at an enormous rate in key oil fields in the US, including Permian and Bakken. Yes, often government regulation can be overkill. But burning off gas because you have a hard time selling it? https://t.co/WVzF34HZB1 https://t.co/exslkmUeCN
@EnergyInDepth Any by the way, I agree re pipelines. If you are going to live in a world fueled by gas and oil (and that is increasingly becoming an if) then safe/properly permitted/well maintained pipelines are needed. You can't complain about flaring but then fight all pipelines.

And The NYT even took you readers to Alaska--by @henryfountain and @SteveEder--to look at how Zinke and his team at Interior are rushing to open up pristine lands in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. https://t.co/Zb7G6nf4px
My NYT colleagues @CoralMDavenport and @SteveEder also examined ethics issues related to Zinke and his management of Interior https://t.co/q8x9RRp5I1
We also examined, again with @HirokoTabuchi how Interior under Zinke has been selling off access to hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in the West for as little as $1.50 an acre. https://t.co/DwYPKYllXf
And the move to open up millions of acres of federal lands to oil and gas drilling, while also weakening rules intended to protect the environment and threatened wildlife, like the sage grouse. This story with @HirokoTabuchi took us to Wyoming.  https://t.co/h1NqyXV6v9
Then there is the rush to open up more federal lands to coal mining, particularly in Montana and Wyoming.  https://t.co/YsQMRjLC9I
Then there was the move to shrink National Monuments, which documents we obtained after suing Interior show was influenced by oil and gas, even though Zinke said it was not. https://t.co/J9Acq70beP

Please read the story. And share it. And thanks to NYT subscribers for supporting this kind of work. The Trump admin is transforming federal regulations. It has impact. Here is a first-hand look, from out in Wyoming, at some of that impact. https://t.co/h1NqyXV6v9
Without question, still no shortage of beautiful landscapes in this part of Wyoming, near Douglas. It is just a landscape that is changing very fast right now. Glad we took a look. https://t.co/JYdjF8pfKv
DATA NYT OBTAINED VIA FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT also shows a massive jump in OIL PRODUCTION on federal lands in the United States in the last two years. This is a big deal. Surge is being driven by places like Wyoming/NewMexico.  Impressive growth. https://t.co/Z91emguCH1
ONE OTHER IMPACT IS VERY CLEAR: The US government, and states like Wyoming and New Mexico where this surge in drilling on federal lands is taking place, are making some BIG $$$. Billions of dollars in fact. As leasing revenue and royalties surge.  Real benefit. Real money. https://t.co/0KoDQ2rlPL
Most striking thing: hillsides here in Wyoming as the sun went down, were lit up like a birthday filled with candles. Across the horizon oil/gas companies were burning off gas. Not enough pipelines to handle all the gas. So just burning it into Wyoming sky https://t.co/pJ8UMed5V6
The Trump administration has also been in a race to lease more and more federal lands for oil and gas drilling. So much land has been put out to auction that the industry just can't take it all. Most of it is not attracting bids. But land put up for auction has skyrocketed. https://t.co/ALqzArQdYi
So WHAT DID WE FIND, as NYT traveled across Wyoming, where oil and gas drilling on federal lands is BOOMING? The land is being transformed--at a rapid pace.  Drilling crews. Land cleared for pipelines. Truck traffic like a highway on what was once cattle grazing area. And more. https://t.co/7lbxXu92KK
Few people probably realize just how much land the federal government controls in the West. Much of the West is in fact owned by the federal government, particularly the mineral rights, meaning the oil/gas/coal that is underneath the surface of the ground. https://t.co/uXohE6YTUC
Industry also wanted (AND IS GETTING) changes in rule protecting sage grouse, a bird whose population has already shrunk, as drilling disrupts the so-called laks, where male birds assemble each year to do a mating dance. https://t.co/Aq1Wwd9A9C
Oil &amp; Gas industry found sympathetic listeners as soon as Trump was sworn in, as one after another Interior moved to rollback rules that might slow down drilling on federal lands, like methane rule, intended to slow climate change/protect federal $$ from being burned https://t.co/tN0ir0QgnU
States like Utah, Wyoming, Montana and New Mexico have long been centers of oil and gas production on federal lands. But leasing and drilling slowed considerably toward end of Obama, as industry complained (and sued) to block rules intended to protect environment/wildlife. https://t.co/1rt79ib52f

The case number you use to look up a case in PACER is NOT the number actually on the court document. Now that makes a lot of sense.
Can I file a motion to disqualify? Or an injunction?
Can I repeat to anyone who cares or has any influence here. I hate PACER, the court look up system. It is so 20th century. Hard to imagine it is still in use.

This is the research at the pesticide industry wants squashed. As researchers have repeatedly found these pesticides appear to be harming children. And the EPA is JUST STARTING a major reassessment of this class of pesticides called ORGANOPHOSPHATES, which includes chlorpyrifos https://t.co/2cyjNevXaZ

THIS IS VERY SERIOUS STUFF. This is not just Dems and GOP fighting in DC or Trump calling news reporters FAKE NEWS. This is food we all eat in the United States.

Some context. This...https://t.co/OQLjBGJf3d
.@JunkScience likes to poke at me via twitter. It is a fact based debate. Here is my volley back.
For those wondering what this means, Milloy has argued EPA assessment of glider trucks as being "super polluting" flawed/bias as there r emails he got via FOIA showing Volvo urged EPA to do these tests. Emails do raise questions. But EPA here says tests were independently done.
Hey @JunkScience. Does this mean GliderGate theories implode? EPA conclusion that Fitzgerald glider trucks, without modern emissions systems, produce excessive air pollution reached independent of any input from Volvo (maker of competing trucks) https://t.co/PkoQd60gNR

This had been a bigger part of story I did on A1 in NYT on Monday. It was so complicated, much of it got trimmed. But this debate has big implications for EPA's enforcement program moving forward. It is important stuff. I wanted to share it. NOW U KNOW. https://t.co/DTYhvZMwR8
This is a RADICAL shift in EPA policy. EPA enforcement teams were furious, convinced this would significantly undermine their ability to use "New Source Review" to mandate air pollution control upgrades at coal power plants, refineries, etc.  In short, Wehrum won. (E&amp;E on it.) https://t.co/kWRxKR6EoW
So what happens next. Wehrum is confirmed as the new head of air pollution policy at EPA. And Scott Pruitt then issues a memo, a month after Wehrum is confirmed, that EPA should not "second guess" air pollution projections by plant owners as they undertake major renovations https://t.co/7tM7zn4nrX
This outcome frustrated Bill Wehrum and his clients. Here is a memo prepared for petrochemical industry--which had hired Wehrum as its lawyer--saying EPA needed to issue some kind of a policy guidance that it can't strong arm power plant owners/"second guess" their projections. https://t.co/GGSIUmtPdL
The facts of this case are complicated-but in short, two US Court of Appeals rulings sided with EPA. The gov has--and must have--power to challenge air pollution projections by power plant owner as EPA decides if it needs to order major upgrade in pollution controls. https://t.co/LhZGCdLG5L
EPA--as is its job--filed Notice of Violation against DTE Energy. Soon enough Bill Wehrum, the coal-power-plant super lawyer, intervenes, as does his firm, then called Hunton Williams. EPA is wrong, they argued. It can't make such demands. https://t.co/sFE8soUqmn
On April 26, 2010, a Chicago-based EPA engineer discovered a news article that described renovation project at the DTE Monroe plant. Here's the rub: The plant owner had not told the EPA about the project, so EPA couldn't demand MAJOR upgrade in air pollution equipment EPA wanted https://t.co/E7jjlKHta3
The saga involves DTE Monroe, on the western shore of the Lake Erie, 60 miles south of Detroit. A coal-fired behemoth that can generate enough electricity each day to power more than 2.3 million homes. It consumes more than a hundred rail cars a day of coal https://t.co/tLvGSMQUm7

EPA could still appeal this ruling today to Supreme Court or ask full 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider ruling by a 3 judge panel. But 4 now, environmental/health groups been fighting for this ban for more than a decade have upper hand. https://t.co/41jWwbIfy1 https://t.co/AC6V745g7e

I also went up to the DOJ and EPA lawyers after the hearing and thanked them for their work on the case. To me, this was an important and reasonable question to address via a FOIA lawsuit. Wish we won. But appreciate their willingness to take up the matter.
I sat in on oral arguments US District Judge JOHN D. BATES held on the case, with EPA and DOJ there and Yale Law School Media Freedom and Information Clinic for NYT. Excellent questions. Excellent lawyering. Don't begrudge his ruling
Daily Caller reported this development with some glee. FYI, none of my FOIA requests r overly broad or for no good reason. I asked correspondence related to myself to see how Pruitt-era agency trying to limit responses to my questions. Transparency counts. https://t.co/SUb7dI4rDd
Here is a copy of the entire ruling. Essentially, the judge argues that the agency cannot be ordered to prospectively release a record that does not yet exist--i.e. the detailed calendar moving forward, even if it has been requested repeatedly in the past. https://t.co/AgkIGpUpkD
yes, I have a lot of balls in the air.
FYI&gt;&gt;&gt;NYT has lost a FOIA lawsuit it filed against the EPA, pressing the agency to proactively release the detailed calendar for the EPA administrator. A critical public record that Pruitt resisted releasing. Maybe Wheeler will do it anyway. Worth the fight. Thanks @MFIAclinic https://t.co/Jw1eewpakN

View from entrance of the EPA, the Trump hotel (it is watching) https://t.co/tTKfmvIOHs
And that is a wrap...(Lipton get out of the building) (joking, no one said that, yet)	. https://t.co/zXQrEYUQNX
Wheeler wraps up by staying--he will not take questions from  news media. Says it is a matter of "technical" limitations. (Not sure I get that one) But says he will do so soon. Then provides a series of joke answers to hypothetical questions. Random stuff "Lord of the Rings" ???
One interesting major thing lacking--that Pruitt always turned to. No mention of God or religion.
Says he can enhance environmental protections, while meeting needs of industry. And then he tries a little Shakespeare "we know what we are now, but not what we may become." The US is gold standard worldwide for environmental
Cites Flint Michigan, and poor job EPA has at times done in the past in terms of articulating risks to the American public. Says he wants to do a better job. "Risk communication disproportionately impacts people at lower end of the social economic ladder."
Also re enforcement, says not advocating reducing fines or penalties to polluters--as Pruitt did. See this piece. (Yes, NYT will be following up re this to see what happens)  https://t.co/2smv5GcJF9
Also will reduce time it takes to issue EPA air/water/other permits. Goal is to make all permit decisions within six months. " I am not suggesting we approve all permits in a set amount of time. I am suggesting we make a decision ,up or down, yes or no, in a set amount of time."
"Certainty to the states," another Pruitt and GOP theme, meaning devolving EPA enforcement to state governments nationwide but environmental critics say means in fact, curbing EPA enforcement powers.
"We are also restoring the rule of law" bringing in federal overreach, he says, sounding the themes of Scott Pruitt. The agenda remains the same. "More certainty to the American public," also a Pruitt refrain.
"When it comes to leadership, you cant lead unless you listen." Tells employees "My instinct will be to defend your work."
Says he was primarily worked on miner protection act, re bringing benefits to retired miners. "The work I did on behalf of the company to try to help retired mine workers." Says he does not think that story has been out there. Implying media coverage, he thinks, has been unfair
Wheeler discussing his work as a lobbyist now. "If you read in the press I only had one." Referring to his work for Murray Energy, the coal company. "I did work for a coal company. I am not at all ashamed of the work I did for a coal company"
Wheeler as he opens remarks announces that Henry Darwin is the new Acting Deputy Administrator . Currently head of operations at the EPA.. https://t.co/Iu9DDfpPJt

@EdWhelanEPPC This is yet another hint to me that Amy Coney Barrett is a very high likelihood, although I have no inside intel on this and am going to return now to topics I actually cover. But the conservative community has already started a campaign to defend her.
Politics is such a fascinating game. Posturing already underway re possible Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett-prototype of what Trump wants. (Could have 40 years+, limited judicial record, embraced by conservatives/anti-choice wing, on LenLeo's list) https://t.co/WEJoYIXp4b
One related note here. Washington Examiner, which published this piece, is owned by Phil Anschutz, Denver billionaire who Scott Pruitt had a secret meeting with last year, during a taxpayer-funded trip to Colorado. Anschutz is also a big donor to GOP candidates running for Senate
Conservative groups like Tea Party Patriots (which keep donor lists to its 501c4 secret) continue to come to the defense of Pruitt, argue that his ethics troubles are result of liberals/bias news media. Makes me wonder yet again: who really funds them? https://t.co/Uljc8ZlsJZ

Also, it is interesting that these hand-written notes seem largely from early 2017. Perhaps Pruitt stopped writing these letters too.  Regardless here is a final couple of bonus images 4 you from the incoming mail side. This re "CORRUPT, SELF-SERVING BIG MEDIA." Enjoy your Sunday https://t.co/4mVKbQyRau
ONE final observation. There is nothing wrong with this correspondence. All of it pretty straight forward: Thank you notes, books. But good to know who Pruitt interacts with. Thanks again Sierra Club re lawsuit produced this. And FOIA OFFICERS WHO PULLED IT. Transparency matters.
And then there was this: "GLOBAL WARMING FOR DUMMIES." A used copy, delivered free of charge to the E.P.A.  "CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PLANET, BOTH IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM" Can't say for sure where this one ended up. Do not see a thank you note back. https://t.co/GiKtbC7VtJ
A final couple of gems. Folks out there in the United States like to send Scott Pruitt books on CLIMATE CHANGE.  Surprise? First a climate change skeptic. Trying help Pruitt "Data was being altered, concealed..Church of the Holy C02 is precisely that - a faith, not a science." https://t.co/hsf4W5hRGh
A FEW ODD ONES. Can anyone explain this one? We have not figured it out. A tour of a baseball stadium? In what city? For what reason? And who is ALFREDO CASTRO? https://t.co/VBt6i55ijO
There are a number of letters with local officials and foreign players too. Here are a few samples, like Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit who has since been named by Trump as NASA's chief financial officer. Here too the state secretary for minister environment from Germany. https://t.co/j6vcMNSHCQ
Forgot this one with the American Gas Association's top boss. Pruitt is close with both oil AND gas industry players. We know this from his calendar, as it shows dozens of such meetings over the last year. AGA President and CEO Dave McCurdy. "IT WAS GOOD TO CATCH UP" https://t.co/Mr1ANh0bmU
Agriculture industry, another big Pruitt constituency.  Here's a note to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Groups like this have BIG enviro issues before EPA, like Clean Water rule Pruitt is repealing/revising in part because farmers don't like it. "VERY MUCH ENJOYED" https://t.co/1EqvFoHB4W
(BACK TO THE LETTERS) Yes, Pruitt does have non oil-gas letters too. Here's 1 to Ken Cuccinelli former VA Att General, now president of Senate Conservatives Fund "where he is committed to helping elect the next wave of principled leaders" (Pruitt a likely future Senate candidate) https://t.co/nnCSnGFCAf
We have also previously published detailed excerpts of Pruitt's internal calendar showing these meetings. And the NYT has sued the EPA to get copies of this detailed calendar every month. https://t.co/Rlq1yjoiN2 https://t.co/5JHwkZ8O3t
At The NYT, we have written extensively about Pruitt and his frequent meetings with oil and gas industry players. Here is one of those stories. What we have never before seen were these personal notes. https://t.co/sE43TGXqAh
SMALLER OKLAHOMA PLAYERS TOO: Like Pierce Norton, CEO of Tulsa-based ONE Gas Inc "I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT AND COUNSEL ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES FACING THE INDUSTRY! SEE YOU SOON" Pruitt writes, in an entirely hand-written note. One of the few. https://t.co/8XF12EnCn4
HAROLD HAMM--the Oklahoma oil billionaire who was the chairman of Pruitt's re-election campaign as Ok Attorney General and is CEO of Continental Resources, a big backer of Trump/giant critic of Obama-era envior rules. "APPRECIATE YOU!" Pruitt writes https://t.co/2yHAWTWyQ4
Pruitt and Jack Gerard, head American Petroleum Institute (API)-- the largest U.S. trade association for the oil and natural gas industry--had a nice back and forth chat via written letters, after Pruitt closed-door visit. "VERY MUCH ENJOYED OUR TIME TOGETHER!" https://t.co/KAfDqOACm2
Here is a note to Chevron chairman and CEO, with a bit of a personal touch from Scott Pruitt. "Wonderful to spend time together!" It is interesting that most of these are from early 2017. Perhaps Pruitt decided to stop writing these snail-mail posted letters too. https://t.co/ElsFChte0D
Got this batch of written correspondence late Friday via Sierra Club lawsuit, which has produced 40,000+ pages of records. @LFFriedman @HirokoTabuchi &amp; I read through it. We've written stories on themes re Pruitt like this before. So we are sharing this as a narrative Tweet
STICK WITH US FOR THIS THREAD: We know Scott Pruitt doesn't like to email (avoids creating a "paper trail") Turns out he DOES (or did) snail mail. Guess who he writes to? Oil &amp; gas executives.
