@Kahjahkins still, the other side of it is that because of the way twitter works, amplifying negative stuff is a fast way to more interaction, and I think a lot of people either don't know or don't care how addicted they are to doing it just to do it, with no real plan.

@mhudack I think new york real estate prices suggest it's an attractive place to live and work with or without amazon, and cutting amazon a deal as though it's competing with Greensboro or wherever is a very odd way to do business.
@mhudack that doesn't mean any deal is a good one or that this one was.
@mhudack idk about you but it seems weird to me that NYC can't attract business investment without tax breaks. I guess I'm just financially conservative that way.
@mhudack if Amazon can't afford to hire more people that seems like a Bezos problem. What if they just hired people somewhere else that made financial sense to do so without massive tax breaks?
@mhudack the point is that's a blindingly misleading comparison that you should've another five seconds to try and be snarky about. 		but if you'd rather move the goalposts and argue that any deal resulting in jobs that apparently are vaporized without it is a good one then go ahead

@bendreyfuss Yeah I think you're wrong on that one tbh.

@bendreyfuss I said  I guess I'm wrong? I have not disagreed with except on the idea that I might be perfect. For someone who is complaining about a lack of communication you don't seem to be reading what I'm saying.
@bendreyfuss Being better than you does not require perfection. Still, I am willing to follow whatever advice you've decided "we" need. You are my official representative on this medium and make all the rules -- so long as you also follow them.
@bendreyfuss idk man, I guess I'm too performative. Maybe I should make a tweet thread about "our" mistakes so I could be less a part of the problem you're describing?

@pt assuming that they're "dumb" because they're wrong is inherently speculative.
@pt so you assume he's being honest and is dumb instead of looking at his long political career showing a history of  effective ignorance. I don't have to speculate, I can look at the evidence. Being selectively dumb is a useful and important skill that I respect as a strategy.
@pt Why do you assume his goal is to say things that he believes are true. It doesn't matter that you think he's dumb if the lie is effective.
@pt I am of the opinion that Tom Cotton is smarter than you give him credit for.

@wqsaves @greg_doucette see how much better you feel now.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette there's a difference between "can" cause suffering and "definitely does cause suffering for anyone who owns any stock at all in any amount"
@wqsaves @greg_doucette if it were I'd have said it.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette who said anything about "more" suffering? link me.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette you should find the person who said that and ask them.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette I think that if you were trying to figure out how to pay for your medical expenses by using funds intended for retirement then you were already suffering.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette so when you say you don't have it "anymore" what you mean is you didn't have it at any particular point. 		That's an odd use of anymore, but language is flexible.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette you did at the beginning of the calendar year?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette who said you had the money you needed to retire in the first place?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette I think that first we should explain what synonyms are, since that's not how they work.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette it seems clear to me. he said *anyone* who owns stock (in any quantity or value) suffers when the market goes down. 		If you narrowly define suffering as only seeing your portfolio value drop, sure, but I live in a world where "suffering" includes multiple other factors.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette you didn't say "suffering harm" you said harm, by itself, twice.  I don't think your tweet makes sense if you insert the word suffering in front of harm in either circumstance, perhaps you'd like to reword it?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette Yeah I don't think you can just insert words like that and then pretend someone said them. I like sticking to the statement.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette Ohhhh. You're reading words that aren't actually there.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette The word harm, or any synonyms for it, do not appear in my words or the quote. Got something better?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette I don't recall using the word harm at all. Got a link?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette Which part of me saying that is the dumbest shit I've read this week is confusing to you?		I don't see the part where I said it doesn't cause any problems at all. Got a link to that?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette Where did I say otherwise?
@bradhooks @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ dude really had to get the prick part in there. This is my favorite reply.
@wqsaves @greg_doucette Oh you had a particular point?
@wqsaves @greg_doucette *shrug* I'd heard from conservatives that the market recovery wasn't good enough, but if you think otherwise then you disagree with them I guess
@wqsaves @greg_doucette This thing where y'all can't say anything about the crash in 08 is fascinating.
@violiav @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette In my opinion, they would not qualify as "most invested" in the stock market, which is what I said but that's just me.
@greg_doucette Well if you think so
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette Ah. So if you don't have a job, can't pay your medical bills and are being evicted but the markets went up today then you're not really suffering. Cool story!
@greg_doucette You're the one backing him.
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette No you said suffering. Tell me how you've suffered
@greg_doucette I don't think "all of history" is a particularly arbitrary timeframe but that's just me.		Also, the problem isn't the use of *a* timeframe, its that you used the wrong one. Maybe you didn't know about the crash, or maybe you were intentionally misrepresenting the statement.
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette If you want to discuss "suffering" then you don't get to exclusively tie it to the stock market.		Your statement is false.
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette Tell me in detail how the markets drop this year has caused you suffering.
@greg_doucette Did you only start investing in January 2018? I guess you weren't a "regular American" until then huh?
@greg_doucette Yeah. If I were you I also wouldn't try to explain why I said "for the year" when that was clearly not the time period being discussed.
@TNizzle621 @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette It's awesome to see conservatives arguing that the stock market recovering under Obama benefited regular Americans the most. I didn't know he had such broad support for his economic policies and their outcomes.
@violiav @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette So they all got rich after the markets went back up since the 08 crash (apparently some people need to have the timeframe explained to them) and are now in sound position to retire?		If not all how many?
@greg_doucette Oh, it's down over an arbitrarily selected timeframe?		Where is it in relation to it's record high?  Where is it over the last five years?  Ten?		C'mon Greg don't be lazy.
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette And thank you for acknowledging that the market being up and people continuing to suffer is something you'd just rather not discuss because it's inconvenient
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette "It‚Äôs a fact that anyone who has money invested in the stock market, whether relatively rich or poor, suffers when the market falls."		This is the dumbest shit I've read this week.
@AG_Conservative The fact that you have to lie about whether or not he advocated for an economic downturn is just sad, have some respect for yourself.
@AG_Conservative He didn't advocate for it.		Owning any stock at all doesn't not mean that you're financial situation replies significantly on and the static Greg cited said 47% have zero.		And you called it "the pitch"		Your tweet sucked. Own that shit
@brianjacksonXP @AG_Conservative @greg_doucette The market is up now, so everything is fine, right? Everyone can afford to retire and no one is living paycheck to paycheck? 		Did you actually think this through?
@greg_doucette Which makes it even stranger that you'd think of it unprompted
@greg_doucette No my point is that it's a dumb fucking tweet. I don't think the rich suffer at all and most people aren't going to have their lives changed based on their individual stock holdings. Weird that you made an assumption about rich people suffering more
@AG_Conservative @greg_doucette sure, that's the main pitch from climate activists and "regular americans" are the ones most invested in the stock market

@freedarko I agree!
@freedarko I think you could say that based on some of the articles written about him, but it's at most relative.		Like, his approach to a school is particularly nuanced and shows some experience. But he doesn't really discuss LGBT issues or other things he doesn't know personally
@freedarko Who praised him for being "ultra-woke"?		He's sensitive to issues that have impacted him personally, I haven't seen him extend that in general terms.
