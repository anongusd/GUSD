"Very low level work." -- Donald Trump on Michael Cohen, who Trump charged with paying two women off who alleged they were having affairs with the president
To be clear: It's not a civil matter. 		AMI admitted in its plea deal that it paid off Karen McDougal for the express purpose of keeping her from influencing the election.		That makes it an illegal in-kind contribution.

I‚Äôm going to bed.		But in the almost-light of the day after the election, this feels likes the chalkiest election in a long time.		What we thought would happen ‚Äî Dems won House, Republicans keep Senate ‚Äî happened.
2 big Senate races still hanging out there:		1. MT Senate (80% in)		Rosendale 49.5%	Tester 47.6%		2. AZ Senate (74% in)		McSally 49.3%	Sinema 48.5%		https://t.co/TllKgA5qBX

Big GOV races decided tonight:		R's win: FL, OH, IA and probably GA		D's win: IL, WI, MI, NV, PA

Republicans have won the governorships in Florida and Ohio.  That's a very big deal in for 2020 and redistricting in 2021.
DeSantis wins in Florida. Scott likely to win. Two huge victories for major Trump allies.
CNN projects that Democrats will retake the House.		HUGE.
RT @Redistrict: Projection: today is the first day in history Americans have elected more than 100 women to the U.S. House of representativ‚Ä¶
CNN projects Cruz beats Beto.		Now, does Beto run for president???
It's official. CNN projects Republicans keep the Senate.		Seems like question now is how many seats they net.
And, scene.		CNN calls North Dakota for Kevin Cramer -- effectively ending any chance Democrats had of retaking the Senate.
What Pbump said https://t.co/IKmqNyzilt
HUGE.		Kansas elects a Democratic governor in Laura Kelly.		And Trump loyalist Kris Kobach loses.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) https://t.co/YemIzGpGpr
RT @alivitali: Donnelly camp releases a statement: "A few minutes ago, I called Mike Braun and congratulated him on winning a hard-fought r‚Ä¶
BIG. CNN calls Mike Braun as winner in Indiana. And with that, any hope Democrats had of winning Senate likely disappear.
This is, uh, not going to happen https://t.co/QDEHUpOpxy
Marsha Blackburn wins.  Which just proves that NO Democrat could win a Senate race in TN. Because Bredesen was by far their strongest possible candidate.
No one does it like the Wolf		[Wolf howl] https://t.co/YZSFEcmR6Z
Joe Manchin wins. In a state Donald Trump won by 43 points in 2016.
Kirsten Gillibrand and  Amy Klobuchar just won reelection races. On to 2020!
