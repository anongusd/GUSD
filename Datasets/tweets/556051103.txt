5. Once you're safe and the railroad has been notified, call 911 to alert first responders to get help.
4. Call the number on the ENS sign to speak with the operating railroad. The crossing number on the sign will give the railroad your exact location.
3. Look for the Emergency Notification System (ENS) sign. It's the blue sign mounted on the crossing arms and lights. https://t.co/2QNyN5X6WL
2. Once everyone is out of the car, move away from the tracks by walking at a 45-degree angle to avoid being hit by flying debris.
