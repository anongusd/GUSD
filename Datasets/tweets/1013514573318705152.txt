@IRLPatricia Most nationalist parties that were founded post-European decolonisation tend not to practice abstentionism, even in Spain where the right to self-determination doesn‚Äôt exist.
@IRLPatricia I think it does reflect a certain Edwardianism in SF. Abstentionism was a common conclusion of many nationalists in the early 20th century. When independence referendums aren‚Äôt possible, that does make sense.

@richdunleave @DPJHodges There definitely are! Labour aren't likely to support the gov, neither are the SNP.

@DPJHodges Surely if they simply vote everything down from now until March, they'll get the Hard Brexit they want?
Can we stop saying the Brexiteers don't have an alternative plan? Ofc they do. Hard Brexit w trade deal. And face whatever consequences that brings.
