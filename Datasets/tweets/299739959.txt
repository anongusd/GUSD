@cbpolis The WHO 2005 info on carcinogenic effects was glossed over in ThinkProgress. If you've addressed this before, pls send and...
@cbpolis if you have more supporting documents/relevant info - let me know, though, and I will definitely read and post.
@cbpolis ultimately it comes down to differing worldviews. Science is objective but the assumptions used are what inspired me to critique.
2/2 @cbpolis I'm skeptical of "nothing to see here" attitude towards the Pill. I think your words and others' were used towards that end.
1/2 @cbpolis it just looks from my layman's view that the science HAS become politicized.
@cbpolis sure but wasn't it worth mentioning in the article? That's what raised a red flag for me.
@cbpolis It's possible the study was debunked but I looked and could not find.
@cbpolis But you mention WHO and left 2005 paper out: http://t.co/K0PCY74OW7  Isn't that selective data presentation in favor of the Pill?
@cbpolis I read what you were quoted as saying. It lacked full context of your worldview, apparently.
@cbpolis "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes" comes to mind. Echo chamber - know what I mean? Easy to get invested in predetermined outcomes.
Scientific research is incredibly important, but not infallible. Dangerous in the hands of those with an agenda and title after their name.
Make no mistake - I believe in science. But as the @TheEconomist article points out, science itself is often subject to an agenda.
spent a lot of time w/ @OfficialSGP today being told I wasn't on the side of "science." Reminded me of this article: http://t.co/gICilxO9C6

2/2 @cbpolis That was the most appalling comment to me. I hope any doctor with such a patient would encourage to seek help for abuse, no?
1/2 @cbpolis who in working group separated abusive rlnshps from ones where woman is not in control of when she has sex?
@pmason03 @cbpolis Entirely spurious comparison
@cbpolis @pmason03 I hope it will be 2! My offense at the TP article, and ur quotes w/in, is that it's irresponsible to have the convo.
@cbpolis Of COURSE it wasn't impossible for me to have an STD. But that's not the point.
@cbpolis I know what a barrier method is. It was a play on words for the title.
@pmason03 @cbpolis Absolutely spurious comparison.
@cbpolis I didn't sugarcoat how appalling I found 2 of the things you said. But no nastiness was meant. What did I say that was inaccurate?
