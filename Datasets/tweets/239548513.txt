We have to save our rural hospitals &amp; one of the best ways to do that is to expand Medicaid.  It will bring billions to Alabama &amp; provide healthcare to 326K Alabamians.  My SAME Act will provide the incentive so let‚Äôs put the politics aside &amp; do this! https://t.co/V54jV5Xm7G

The shutdown should have never happened. What the President signed yesterday was the same thing the Senate passed unanimously in December. 35 days later we are back to square 1. Mr. President you want people to have good faith dialog, but good faith is a two way street. https://t.co/3cjQZ3SclN
It‚Äôs real simple folks, we pay what we owe our hardworking govt workers-with interest. We also have a separate bill that gives back pay to employees of federal contractors. Both seem simple, but I will need your help. Contact your legislators &amp; ask them to join me. https://t.co/RKGfzax71T

Fact check: 		Every vote to repeal health reform was a vote against these protections. 		20 Republican state AGs are suing the federal govt to dismantle protections, including Alabama.

However, this does not solve the problem we face in Alabama, where our largest auto export markets and 3 of our 4 automakers are based in Asia. 		Until the President ends his 232 investigation, 7 million American auto jobs are still under threat.
I‚Äôm glad it seems the President is hearing the chorus of voices from workers to industry leaders to legislators imploring him to stop harmful tariffs. 		His announcement today is a positive step in the right direction &amp; something we can build on. I‚Äôm ready to help any way I can.
.@realdonaldtrump Many of your tariffs are not the greatest‚Äîthey‚Äôre the worst. Your auto tariff/tax threatens 57k AL jobs &amp; $11B in exports. Retaliatory tariffs/taxes threaten $170M in AL soybean exports 2 China annually. Your tariffs/taxes are great for 1 thing: killing US jobs. https://t.co/Y8kETAKLHS

You know what that means? US farmers lose their #1 importer, possibly for good. Negotiations won‚Äôt matter. Being tough won‚Äôt matter. 		In short: these tariffs are an existential threat to American farmers. Who actually thinks that‚Äôs a good idea?
Right now, it‚Äôs more convenient for China to import US soybeans because we have quality, reliable producers. But tariffs change the game. As they've done before, China can tap markets in competing countries like Brazil, who would be happy to take that market from us‚Äîand keep it.
China is the largest importer of US farm products. Soybeans top that list. In Alabama, soybean exports to China are about $169 million annually according to the @USChamber and contribute to about 11k jobs.
The President imposed a 25% tariff (remember - a tax) on a laundry list of Chinese products bought by Americans. China responded by doing the same to many US goods bought in China,  including‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîsoybeans.
Tariffs = a tax on a particular class of imports or exports. Commodity = a mass-produced unspecialized product ‚Äî this is important because it means it can be produced ANYWHERE.
THREAD: Hi folks, @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs tweet about soybeans today got me thinking about how much misinformation is out there about many of his recent tariffs.		 Let‚Äôs take a look at the facts, shall we? Join me for #Trade101.
