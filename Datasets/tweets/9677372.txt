That said, Nancy Pelosi says her focus is "kitchen table concerns" -- how families get fed, how people pay their rent.		"*That* is what is important; not the language the president uses from time to time" -- @SpeakerPelosi on @kqedforum
#NancyPelosi on President Trump:		"My strength, and the strength of the Democrats, is the tone with which we have confronted this president... We respect his office. We disagree with his tone and the lack of dignity with which he talks about women," says @speakerpelosi.
"I have to say to women out there: Be confident. Shine your light," says @speakerpelosi. 		On the new generation of Dem leaders: "Our diversity is our strength -- our unity is our power," she says.		#NancyPelosi on @kqedforum

"I support the Affordable Care Act, and many more -- ALL Americans having access to affordable healthcare," says @speakerpelosi. The path to that, she says is "strengthing" the #ACA - -and reminds listeners that there are "costs to every path"		#NancyPelosi
A @kqedforum listener has asked what Democrats will do for poorer Americans. 		"Our agenda for the people is the agenda on which we won the	election," says @speakerpelosi. "Just think what we would have done in a fair arena." #NancyPelosi

🔴Of the roughly 30 percent of #homeless people surveyed in San Francisco two years ago, the bulk of those not from San Francisco were from California. 		🔴That may not technically be anybody's idea of a "neighbor."

Lastly, our podcast #TheBayKQED with @RadioDevin recently looked at just how bad ⚠️The Big One⚠️could be here. 		Take a 🎧listen🎧 this weekend. It’s important. https://t.co/7lbJBx2PFw
You can read the full @kqedscience story from @peterarcuni about the likelihood of a major #earthquake hitting the Bay after last week's 🌀shakes🌀 https://t.co/KVejnmRFWK
❓So, what does all this mean?❓		First off, you should definitely get that 🧰earthquake kit🧰 ready. For real. 		@KQEDNews has this run-down of what you should keep in your "go bag" in the event of fire, flood or earthquake. (#1? Spare medication 💊) https://t.co/RsORtYLFcN
FYI, the scientists who developed  the @HayWiredCA modeling scenario estimate that there's about a ❗️one-in-three❗️chance of a magnitude-7 quake on the Hayward Fault... 		...within the next 30 years 💣
Geological studies put the average interval between big quakes on the Hayward Fault at about 🕰140 years🕰 (give or take 50 years.)		Meaning the Big One could happen any day now 🔜... 		...OR not in the lifetime of many middle-aged residents ↔️
⚠️And here's the OTHER bad news: 		The idea that minor temblors serve to relieve pressure on the fault — and lessen the chances of a major event — is a ❌myth❌
But here's the bad news: 		‼️Pressure HAS been building up on the Hayward Fault.		It's been over ⏳150 years⏳since the last major earthquake to 🌀rattle🌀 the fault, which stretches through densely populated regions of the East Bay...
So does this mean ⚠️The Big One⚠️ is ^more^ likely to hit the Hayward Fault ASAP?		✅ On the one hand, says Peggy Hellweg of @BerkeleySeismo, in the last 20-30 yrs “no big earthquake has happened on the Hayward Fault associated with one of these little sequences of earthquakes."
According to Peggy Hellweg of @BerkeleySeismo, there's minor earthquake activity occurring almost continuously along the Hayward Fault. (Most of it goes unnoticed.)		🤔		So even though we experience these 2 quakes as individual events, they're more like parts of the same sequence
Combined with the torrential ☔️downpours☔️that followed?		This one-two 🤜punch🤛 of mini-quakes naturally had some folks here a little... worried that The Big One was on the way. https://t.co/P5O3p91OCj
THREAD: ⚠️ Do little earthquakes — like last week's shakes — mean "The Big One" is imminent?		Remember: For two straight mornings, the East Bay experienced two small 🚨quakes🚨 (3.4 on Wed, 3.5 on Thurs) — in essentially the same spot. 		Q. Did YOU feel one or both of them?

Read the full #BayCurious story, via @oallenprice:		https://t.co/sDNbjjz3zJ
Some cities have started to fight back by taking steps to make their town a less appealing detour. They've intentionally slowed traffic by adding stop signs or changing the timing of traffic lights.		"We're at the beginning of a war between cities and these apps," Bayen says.
GPS data has vastly improved the quality of traffic data. But studies show there is a downside: "new traffic jams in residential areas that didn't used to be there before," Bayen says.		❓Have you experienced this (a new jam on a quiet street that became *everyone’s* GPS detour?)
Don’t just take our word for it.		"Any app that you have turned on that has some form of geolocation — whether it's a navigation app, whether it's an app such as a social network, whether it’s a game — it has the ability to collect GPS data," says Alex Bayen of @BerkeleyITS.
ENTER: YOUR CELLPHONE 📱		By 2007, they were increasingly outfitted with GPS capability. 		Chances are good if you’ve got a phone in the car, you are a data point — perhaps many times over. You’re simultaneously a provider AND a consumer of traffic data.
FAST FORWARD ⏩ to the turn of the 21st century…		#FasTrak arrives on the scene! The @MTCBATA took the commute times from all of the cars with #FasTrak transponders to provide precise point-to-point travel times throughout the region. 		This grounded even more traffic 🚁🚁 https://t.co/XTk5E1z0wK
In the beginning, most news stations could still afford their own helicopter and traffic reporters. 		But the energy crisis of the 1970s put an end to that. 		Enter: traffic services that provided information to many stations.
✖️Not so fun fact: news stations also hired reporters to *literally sit in traffic all day* and report on conditions and commute times ✖️ https://t.co/5kXGvy68oA
As the Bay Area and its highways expanded into the suburbs in the 1950s, a new demand arose for traffic information. Enter: HELICOPTERS 🚁		Fun fact: many of these early traffic helicopters were helmed by... military pilots, back from serving overseas.
🚦TRAFFIC THREAD🚦		It's Friday! Which means, for many of us, NO COMMUTE for the next two days.		So what better time to read a fascinating (no, really) thread of facts about... traffic reporters?		Buckle up...		⬇️

If PG&amp;E can’t pay up, the court will have to decide how much funding ⬆️these two groups⬆️ will actually receive. 		That might result in far less of a pay out than survivors are asking for to rebuild their lives.		⤵️
⚖️ But PG&amp;E is being sued by thousands of wildfire victims who have lost almost everything, and those liabilities could exceed $30 billion. 		That’s on top of the roughly $18 billion the publicly traded company already owes its creditors.		⤵️
❓”I'm a #wildfire survivor. How does this impact me?"		✅ PG&amp;E says it remains “committed to providing assistance to communities affected by wildfires in Northern California, and our restoration and rebuilding efforts will continue.”		⤵️
But if bankruptcy requires PG&amp;E to significantly reduce its costs or shrink operations, that could lead to major layoffs or pension reductions. 		It could also use Chapter 11 to renegotiate worker contracts.		⤵️
❓”I'm a PG&amp;E employee. What about my job?”		✅ PG&amp;E employs ~20,000 people, and the company says it intends to continue paying and providing benefits to them.		⤵️
FYI if you're a PG&amp;E customer, see that "DWR Bond Charge" cost on your bill? 👀 		That's actually from the last time rates went up after PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, back in 2001 📈		⤵️ https://t.co/nQoweYjYut
❓ "Will this make my utility bill go up?"		✅ Unclear. Bankruptcy proceedings can = steep legal fees. Some consumer advocates are concerned those costs will inevitably be passed on to ratepayers.		⤵️
❓"Will my lights and heat stay on?"		✅ Short answer: Yes. "We do not expect any impact to natural gas or electric service for our customers as a result of the Chapter 11 process," say PG&amp;E.		⤵️

❓ How does PG&amp;E planning to file for bankruptcy protection affect you and your utilities? 		💡According to @UtilityReform, this doesn’t mean your lights will be going out. 		💵 But it might mean rates going up, as they did the last time this happened, in 2001.
Officials are investigating whether PG&amp;E’s equipment sparked the #CampFire in Nov that killed at least 86 people and destroyed 15k homes. 		Damages from that fire have been estimated in the billions.
PG&amp;E is currently facing up to $30 billion in liability damages from the #wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Those liability payouts could be delayed by a bankruptcy filing.
This means PG&amp;E will essentially continue to operate under court protection from certain liabilities, while they try to restructure.
PG&amp;E says it plans to file for bankruptcy protection. 		This move comes amid potentially massive liabilities resulting from the deadly California wildfires. https://t.co/hlcTYgOjn3

The 💵economics💵 of #recycling in the Bay are fascinating, and you can read/hear more via @KQEDnews #BayCurious and reporter @Jessicazyp here: https://t.co/n4hsfVtrPM
#Recycling centers make money by selling the materials you bring — like aluminum and plastic — in bulk for their scrap value.		(Glass, FYI, actually has a *negative* scrap value. Recycling centers receive state subsidies that stop them losing money on glass.)
That might not sound like a lot. But it’s enough for a handful of customers to make #recycling their full-time job. 		Others use the funds to earn extra cash, and to make living in the #BayArea viable.
It's all about the 5- or 10-cent CRV (that's California Redemption Value) stamp on top of your 🥤soda🥤 can, or the side of a bottle.		Bringing a pound of plastic bottles to a #SanFrancisco recycling center gets you around $1.20. 		Aluminum is worth as much as $2 a pound.
In large enough amounts, #recycling can be such 💵big business💵 in the Bay that smugglers have been caught trying to bring in more than $80,000 worth of empty beverage containers... from Arizona and Nevada.

Atmospheric rivers were also undoubtedly behind the worst floods in California's history, when the state capital of #Sacramento was inundated during the winter of 1861-62.
Atmospheric rivers produce up to 50% of California's 💧precipitation💧 annually and 65% seasonally. Which is good!		But alas, too much storm activity can result in major hazards like flooding, mudslides or ash flow in the aftermath of wildfires.
A typical atmospheric river can be:	☔️300 miles wide	☔️A mile deep	☔️More than 1,000 miles long.		They commonly begin as warm water ⛈storms⛈ over the Pacific Ocean, and prevailing winds make them kinda look like a firehose, pointed right at California.
Atmospheric rivers -- massive, fast-moving storm systems -- can transport more than 25 times the moisture as flows through the mouth of the Mississippi River.		They're basically giant rivers of water vapor -- in the sky. 		(Graphic via @NOAA) https://t.co/LJzoaCx43q

"This holiday season, my heart isn’t just with those who’ve lost a loved one or those of us who are living with wounds, but to all of those who are, as the cool kids on the internet say, 'adulting.'" -- @OGPenn
"I'm thinking of #NiaWilson’s family as they go through their first holiday season without her. Or #OscarGrant’s family as they embark on a decade since he was murdered." -- @OGPenn
. @ogpenn talks about the data -- the higher rates of domestic abuse during the holidays, the numbers on #depression. 		"We could spit data and numbers all day, but when you’re on your back [...] what comes to mind are the stories of people."
Our @kqedarts columnist, @OGPenn has written a thoughtful, raw story for us about #mentalhealth &amp; what he calls "The Delicate Art of Adulting During the Holidays." 		It begins on his own bathroom floor, as Pen tries to ease the physical pain (bad lower back) that's plaguing him.

Since Milk, the gay rights movement has scored political victories that would have been inconceivable four decades ago. 		(Today, Milk's seat on the Board of Supervisors is occupied by another openly gay supervisor, @RafaelMandelman.)
White had suddenly resigned from the SF Board of Supervisors and went into a rage after learning that Mayor Moscone would not reappoint him. 		After shooting Moscone, White walked across City Hall and shot and killed Milk.
Nine days after that -- 40 years ago today, and less than a year into his first term -- Harvey Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were shot and killed in City Hall by former Supervisor Dan White.
Just 11 days later, on Nov 18 1978, San Francisco was thrown into shock by the death of more than 900 Peoples Temple followers of the Rev. Jim Jones at Jonestown.
Milk was a strident advocate for gay rights, and led the fight against Proposition 6, a statewide ballot measure to ban gay and lesbian teachers.  In November 1978, voters overwhelmingly defeated the proposition.
Milk ran a camera store on Castro Street before he won a spot on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. This made him the state's first openly gay elected official.
Born and raised in New York, Harvey Milk served in the U.S. Navy before moving to San Francisco in the 1970s and becoming an outspoken gay activist.
On November 27, 1978, Milk and Moscone were assassinated in San Francisco City Hall by former Supervisor Dan White.		Senator @DianneFeinstein, then president of the SF Board of Supervisors, was the one who announced to their deaths to the world.

“I wouldn't call the mixture terribly toxic to humans, but it's best to avoid ingesting it or getting it on your skin until enough rain has fallen to dilute the mixture,” she says.
That said, @UCSF expert Gina Solomon says that the 1st rain WILL "react with the acidic particles and create an acidic and slightly oily mixture on outdoor surfaces, which will be somewhat corrosive and irritating.”
Why? “Although Paradise experienced a large wildfire, that’s not enough smoke to cause acid rain,” says Dar Mims, @AirResources meteorologist. “As the winds and rain start to arrive you’re going to wash out the pollution. We will end up with a clean environment after this storm.”
REMINDER: Air quality experts do NOT predict that the Bay Area's imminent rain will be toxic. (No matter what you've heard on social media.)
