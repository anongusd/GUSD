77 years ago, our Nation was attacked. At a time of alarm &amp; great pain, Americans of all walks of life—the Greatest Generation—joined together to answer the call to defend her. Their sacrifice over the next many months saved the world from tyranny. Thank you to our WWII Veterans
It’s with great sadness we learn of the passing of George H.W. Bush. A decorated World War II hero, a family man, and a true statesman, President Bush’s legacy and patriotism will be remembered for generations of Americans and Mainers to come. Rest in peace, Mr. President.
Wishing everyone a very happy &amp; safe Thanksgiving, a time to share with close friends &amp; family &amp; to be thankful for the joys &amp; blessings in our lives. For all those who are away from home this holiday—those serving overseas &amp; our first-responders—we thank you for your sacrifice.

Every single day, the men and women of our law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. I am praying for Mr. Cole, his family, and our entire community today and I send them my deepest condolences
I am absolutely horrified and heartbroken by the reports this morning of the killing of one of our brave law enforcement officers, Deputy Sheriff Corporal Eugene Cole, in Norridgewock, who was responding to an incident and preforming his duty.
It was extraordinary meeting with these two great individuals and I’m proud to be a cosponsor and supporter of H.R. 820, the Childhood Cancer STAR Act
Today was a really special day. I met two courageous cancer survivors, Kellan and Julianna, who traveled down from Maine to visit Capitol Hill and talk about the critical need for continued research into this horrible disease https://t.co/XNFgXn3xP2

It will allow small businesses in all industries to benefit from it. We are giving our small businesses—the backbone of Maine’s economy—relief so they can grow and create more jobs for our fellow Mainers	#mepolitics
This improved tax code will also greatly benefit the more than 140,000 small businesses and job creators throughout Maine and their 275,000 employees by lowering the effective rate for pass-throughs, of which almost all small businesses are organized	#mepolitics
In addition, this increases the child tax credit to $2,000, meaning the average Maine family will save an additional $2,000 on their taxes per child in their family. This makes it easier for ordinary Maine families to benefit from the tax code	#mepolitics
Under this simpler tax code, we are doubling the standard deduction, meaning the average married couple in Maine will not pay any federal income tax for the first $24,000 they earn, a huge boost for our families	#mepolitics
This new law will drastically simplify our tax code for the vast majority of Mainers and save more money for more of our hardworking families	#mepolitics
