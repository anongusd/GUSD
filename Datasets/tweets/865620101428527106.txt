Anyone else find it odd no one is worried that the potus is threatening the Democrats.  I feel it in my bones trump is going to tear down everything we care so deeply for not as Americans yet as humans . People please. Remember we are all alike in more ways then we know 	Be kind
Worst of all our POTUS IS THE BIGGEST BULLY EVER .... it needs to end now. We need to set a character example.. or values an morals that show the rest u cant act like that an get away with it. ... right	#BULLYPROFF
Bc they got there ac working n she tells me bc u need to suck it up. 	Now she is so mean to everyone not just me ..yet it is so sad.  I cnt have the supplies I need she locks them up i cannot take brakes . Anyone else have a bully boss. Let me know I'll add it in our news cast.
Then Monday rolls around I was so exhausted.  N then my fan comes up missing she had taken it . I go back to her office she is using it. Now I am at the front desk running the hotel while she is sitting on her ass . I ask her why she shut the door that connects me to laundry rm
So here I am championing to stop bullying. 	Turns out I'm surrounded by it. Its not just in schools.  	I was forced to work in 110* 3 days st8 bc our ac broke. Now my boss could of had it fixed yet said u can deal it will be done Monday, she was not working so she didnt care. Wtf

@Rach_H_81 Didnt charge him bc they were still watching him paige n what like 5 others come on what kind of ppl u really want running our country seriously
@Rach_H_81 No they can't or they would have it's a dam Republican house Senate n house n wh come on. They cant n wont in fact bet they are just trying to pretend they are going to do something so trump leaves them alone
@Rach_H_81 That's my point. Sweet corrupt dreams till tomorrow
@Rach_H_81 How many of trumps crew have pled or are fighting to not plea yet have been arrested please how many
