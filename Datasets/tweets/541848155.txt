MrPresident you can’t ignore the constitution or your own call to every country taking their citizens back.

@realDonaldTrump Abortion	“Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.”		This is misleading
@realDonaldTrump If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."		There is no evidence.
@realDonaldTrump Foreign policy	"When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.”		This is true.
This is exaggerated.		The revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does include provisions that are intended to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States — like minimum wage provisions for some auto manufacturing.
@realDonaldTrump “I hope you can pass the U.S.M.C.A. into law, so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful word...
@realDonaldTrump San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.”		This is misleading.		Border apprehensions decreased by 91% since 1994
@realDonaldTrump Immigration	“The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. “	This is false.
@realDonaldTrump More people are working now than at any time in our history.”		This is misleading.		While the total number of people working in the United States is higher than ever, it is not because of the president’s policies. It is because more people than ever live in US
@realDonaldTrump Wages were “growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for. They are growing faster than anyone thought possible.”		This is true.		Wages are rising faster for construction and manufacturing workers than workers in service occupations
@realDonaldTrump We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.”		This is false.
@realDonaldTrump My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.”		This is false.
@realDonaldTrump We recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.”		This is true. — all paid by Americans
@realDonaldTrump The economy	“The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.”		This is false.
@realDonaldTrump you want #unity, like #KimJongUn wants to unify North and South #Korea under his leadership of #grred #ignorance and #hate

Pay the #taxes of the bottom 14% encouraging them to raise those 14% above the #poverty line, so they don’t have to pay the more than the flat rate.  Simple! Everyone gets lower taxes corporations &amp; individuals, everyone get healthcare, everyone pays their way &amp; no more deficits
... you a #FlatTax 23%  so now you have a balanced budget. With catastrophic basic healthcare that covers everyone. If we spend more our taxes go up, spend less our taxes automatically go down. Here is the progressive part... the top 14% of Americans (individuals+corporations)..

What happened to #Innocent till proven #guilty MrPresident? There is no proof of your slanderous and discrimination of these #refugees https://t.co/SwuQ8E952Y
Deporting #criminals to other countries is just #CatchAndRelease and how America created #MS13               And Bracamontes is on Death Row not loose in #America https://t.co/ghywYoIhtY
The best way to protect #democracy and #HumanRights, is to promote them https://t.co/SwuQ8E952Y
Its amazing MrPresident how fearful you are, almost to the point of histeria from the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.... if you want to send #troops somewhere, send them to the countries in need to make them safer for their citizens. https://t.co/LF0BIXHqwt

The #democratic s already did, almost a decade ago, the #republicans have yet to try; unless you count the 100+trys to take it away. You are great a distroying things, but what have you &amp; @GOP built? A regimen of #discrimination &amp; #greed? https://t.co/zENttotRXB
First it his #Constitutional Right, second no #American #Patriot would work to take those #Rights away. #FreedomOfSpeech, #FreedomOfThePress #FreedomOfRlegion TheRight to #Vote #Citizenship ALL of which you have worked against.

semantics, as you think all negative coverage is #fakenews. And @FoxNews whos business model is not to report the news, but to prop up you &amp;  @GOP #lobbying for corporate #greed - it is disinformation for profit... and its a disgrace as are you MrPresident https://t.co/jECIXV4pbj
I think Americans are angry &amp; #disillusioned because they have a president who makes up claims, #lies to their face &amp; pursuit of policies for personal gain based on ignorance &amp; uses #hate &amp; #discrimination to distroy the #American experiment- that one thing that makes us great https://t.co/bPmegtmsmR

@realDonaldTrump MrPresident, you &amp; the @GOP have done nothing to build a better alternative to the #obamacare &amp; everything to destroy it. If the #republicans really cared about America, they would have presented something other than snake oil over the past 10yrs. You only work to hurt Americans
Just goes to show #American s produces its own #terrorists born of #ignorance &amp; #hate . You see it in our #bigotry, our #gun #violence &amp; our #rape culture. If we want a better #America, we need to raise a better healthier stable people https://t.co/1BwYmhDwW3
@realDonaldTrump No one MrPresident wants illegal immigration, they want non-#discriminatory #immigration that Balances the strength of #diversity w/ the needs of #businesses... like all the foreigners workers you the @realDonaldTrump bring in each year to run your resorts rather hire #Americans
@realDonaldTrump What is happening in #Europe and our southern Nieghbors is refugees fleeing #war, #violence, #discrimination and #poverty. A true #leader or #Christian would be working to eliminate those factors. Not exploit them.
#vote for #WOMAN... #vote for #diversity, #vote for a better and fairer #world... #vote for #America
@realDonaldTrump You do realize MrPresident #American have to pay your #tariffs, for your #tax cuts for the #rich, your #arms #war, your attacks on #healthcare, corporate pollution and your wall. All while you restrict #trade, restrict #immigration and force #jobs to be exported - great job!
@realDonaldTrump The #jobs numbers are @BarackObama ‘s the #trade #war and the #GOPTaxScam and record high Debt are the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump Any true #American who loves this country can take the 60seconds required to look it up. #Vote out the #republican #conspiracy to #SaveAmerica
@realDonaldTrump Hopefully it means they are deleting your account
@realDonaldTrump What proof do you have MrPresident, you still hold the record for be the most #dishonest #president in history. Show #American s the proof or stop coning your supporter with #hate #fear and #ignorance
@realDonaldTrump Like all migrants, they come because they have lost hope. Other come because they mistakenly think you are a good president
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident the foreign aid is to help these countries to retain their people confidence &amp; #safety. If they are still coming then we need to do more to help, not less. If we fail our neighbors then no #wall will ever by high enough to stop the exodus. #MS13 is an #American #gang.
@realDonaldTrump You MrPresident have cost this country trillions, you @realDonaldTrump and your @GOP backers are our greatest threat
@realDonaldTrump Because we have laws, which you are trying to remove, that protect #Americans from #polluters. But you are trying to corporations richer, by shifting the costs on to the #taxpayers - you truly not #MAGA but destroying it and the #world with it
@realDonaldTrump Your approval ratings MrPresident are low in #America and around the #world, because you are a disastrous president and a disgraceful human being
@realDonaldTrump For for anyone other than disastrous destruction of #America under @realDonaldTrump and the disgraceful @GOP
@realDonaldTrump Extraordinarily prosperity for the #rich, and the highest #deficit in 8yrs MrPresident. Average #Americans are not #wealthier, #healthier, #safer or better off under a @GOP backed #Trump #administration.
@derekkerton @JacksonDiehl @TresMamae it seems their story is self-defense, as absurd as that may be. More absurd is how Americans are dismissing mured as a threat to their livelihood.  I the greater threat is to their values or lack of them.
@eshaLegal @Hebahersi @GeorgeWill , @MaxBoot, #ChrisWallace not that I agree with everything he said or did... @SenJohnMcCain.  I would say most of the @GOP has been #corrupted and the greatest threats to #America are the #fear , #hate &amp; #greed of both parties.
@TinaDesireeBerg @Hebahersi I agree, but it is the immoral in power we have to stop first
@JacksonDiehl @TresMamae They dont need time to investigate, they need time to come up with a better story. There is not enough time in the world to do this. #trump will do exactly what he did about #massshootings - condemn publicly and do nothing undercover of the next news cycle
https://t.co/vbgfdcQsWn
@Hebahersi Its not the #conservatives or #liberals are amoral, just that this #administration has never made a single #moral decision. https://t.co/vbgfdcQsWn
So far MrPresident, all you have supplied is hiring and protection of rapeist, wife beaters and men exercising power over women (#DeVos, #kavanaugh,  #Ailes, #Porter and of course yourself) https://t.co/xO6H8BnBIK
The only criminals I see MrPresident are in your administration... violating the #constitution &amp; #world #law. Taking money from @fema to imprison #children guarded men who #raped 3 MrPresident the is no #moral authority leading this country, just your #hate, #fear &amp; #ignorance https://t.co/N81LDrb6Mz

Ater 3yrs Of attacking the #media, calling them the #enemy of the people, questioning their nationality just day earlier as if it mattered. What matters MrPresident is the protection of #democracy and #HumanRights which requires a #FreePress, #FreedomOfSpeech &amp; punishing #murder https://t.co/xzzJpWW1x3
MrPresident, 4 the last 2yrs you have done nothing to fix #healthcare in #America, but to actively work to destroy it in name of corporate profits ove amercan lives... from #Obamacare, #Medicare to #perscription #drugs, #pot, #opioidcrisis you have only cut funding/ #regulation https://t.co/k3XZJNb5Yw

If you think there is NOT a #FinancialCrises, then think again.  The #Trump #Administration may be the most #expensive in US History as he continues to cut #programs. https://t.co/gXHwpARzVL
@realDonaldTrump 1/7th of the #soybeans you MrPresident forced #china not to buy.
@realDonaldTrump @JunckerEU @EU_Commission The @EUCouncil has no #love for @realDonaldTrump or any of your #policies, like true #American ’s we are waiting for your exit
Does anything with #Trump ever add up - LiarLiar	https://t.co/BY6KcXgYIc
Must be the same people who made the @etnow_ #EntertainmentTonight #BusTape. The one #Trump apologized for then claimed it was fake.  How do #American 's follow such a #liar and why would the #World want to deal with him?	https://t.co/wdQTlQo3E6

@realDonaldTrump Funny, MrPresident how you are sacrificing everything from the #deficit, #trade, the #environment, law&amp;order, #education, #healthcare, world #leadership, #alliances, #security #Religion, #equity &amp; the #constitution itself to claim as your own the #economy @BarackObama gave you.
@realDonaldTrump True #american’s are trying, but firt we have to take back our #government from you and the draconian @GOP and then from the @DNC
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident, to @PutinRF_Eng you ARE the gift that keeps giving, he will never let you go. #Congress has been the hardest on #Russia. You have been the weak. Refusing to empliment #sanctions &amp; try to remove them. If you really care you would #price match #Russian #NG to #Germany
@realDonaldTrump @VFWHQ Where are the 200 remains from North Korea?
@realDonaldTrump So you @realDonaldTrump are proposing to end ALL #Farm #Subsidies and ALL #Oil #Subsidies and #Export #Subsides by the US #Government to finally end the #TadeWar you started? Including the $12billion you just offered #Soy &amp; #Pork #Farmers? Good to see you thought this out!
@realDonaldTrump Yes! MrPresident, your actions were so bad for our country.  That is why EVERYONE on both parties past and present said so.  Including @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump You MrPresident knew about it after the #Election, but you don't do anything about it, but to deny it.  Why are you the ONLY person to deny #Russian medaling?  Even #Putin has said they did.  I hope he is paying you well to act stupid.
@realDonaldTrump Shame @realDonaldTrump you are not this forceful with @PutinRF_Eng who is a greater threat to the United States &amp; the World than the feeble toiling of Irans misadventures
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps your followers should read it for themselves MrPresident, since no one who reads it agrees with your conclusion on collusion
@realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch All evidence to the contrary MrPresident, its your #Credibility in question &amp; every attack on #Mueller shows your #fear &amp; #insecurity
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident, you gave up The Opportunity, to push America 's  interests, values, strength &amp; dignity.  You got nothing: on #Crimea, #Syira, #RussianMedaling, #assassination. And you gave up, your remaining credibility
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident, nothing has come from #Singapore, except your behavior.  Nothing is written down because there was no time. Poppycock!  Then you continued to say you brought back 200 remains.  None yet returned.  #KimJongUn already said there would be no tests before #Summit FAILURE
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like your pre #NorthKorean strategy before you decided the ruthless #DearLeader is, in your assessment, an “honorable man.” I think you said that about #Putin too. But really MrPresident it sounds like a lack of judgement and moral conviction.
@realDonaldTrump What next?... internet wars? Unpluging  @EUCouncil sloweing their internet?
They can all be solved by great leaders. Unfortunately they were all created by self serving egos like @PutinRF_Eng &amp; yourself MrPresident, motivated by #greed, #lust, #hate &amp; #fear. You will continue to be #Putin ‘s puppet &amp; he will protect authoritarian regime to rebuild #USSR https://t.co/HuunHZ1KMD

@realDonaldTrump And then quickly denied it. Tweeting from the under the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and sining  @PutinRF_Eng ‘s denial with him, is MrPresident the subservient behavior and lack of leadership you have exhibited since the election. You have less backbone than @BarackObama
It has cost over the #American #Taxpayers $40million to house children taken away from their parents, some housed in vacant offices &amp; industrial warehouses. we could have housed them in #trump hotels cheaper https://t.co/ikIlXbLg9c - disgraceful https://t.co/ngG4CarlMQ
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump #MS13 and all the #asylum seekers of was created by deporting gangs to countries ill equipped to control them. Your #CatchAndRelease policy only gose to propagate #MS13
@realDonaldTrump So far, your whole strategy is to just undoing @BarackObama ‘s accomplishments and continuing his failures. Other than blame others as the President of the United States... why dont you do something about it?
@realDonaldTrump All of the #Press, not media which includes paid personalities like @seanhannity are the watch dogs of #democracy. You and your policies are the enemy of the people.
@realDonaldTrump Other than a soccer ball, what did you get “as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by #Russia...”?????
@realDonaldTrump Our weakness is the result of a year and a half of countined foolishness and stupidity under the #Trump #Administration
@realDonaldTrump Then give amnesty to all the illegal aliens... obviously they are contributing and its fiscally responsible.  But you won’t, because its not about law &amp; order it’s about whats in it for you. And Russia is no different.
@realDonaldTrump It would if you were not so submissive to #Russia and #Putin and if you were his intellectual equal. That is the issue MrPresident. You are his greatest avocet and defender of #Russias misdeeds
@realDonaldTrump They all committed to raise their contributions not because of @realDonaldTrump , but because of @PutinRF_Eng , but the less reliable you continue to be, they may believe they cant trust you and your #FakeFacts like we pay 90% and not the true figure of 22%
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @RandPaul is not avoice of reason, nor are you MrPresident
@realDonaldTrump Its more optimistic, NOT Stronger. You gave $1.5trillon to the rich and nothing to Infrastructure. You &amp; the @GOP have raised the cost of #healthcare, #gas &amp; the cost of living. Your #TradeWar is Killing exports &amp; #farming . Look at the #YieldCurve and the looming #recession.
@realDonaldTrump You mean your #FakeApology. We ALL watched the press conferences at #G7  #Trump #KimJongUn #Summit , @NATO, #TrumpMay &amp; now #TrumpPutinSummit  NONE OF THAT is #FakeNews  its just your #FakePolicy &amp; lack of strategy. This just proves your #AmericaFirst is just a bumper sticker $5
@realDonaldTrump The cries MrPresident to abolish #ICE is the result of them following your #illegally and inhuman #policies which only highlights the ineptitude of you, your #administration and your policies of #hate and #greed. #America needs to vote for ANYONE except a #Republican
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident, you may be the biggest narcissist, but Im going with Peter M. Robinson @GOP insider &amp; historian who said #trump is the most uneducated &amp; least qualified man to ever sit in the oval office. And he voted for you!
@realDonaldTrump Then you misspoke again when you used the phrase “higher ends of intelligence” NO ONE LOVED YOUR #PRESSCONFRENCE but your handler @PutinRF_Eng
@realDonaldTrump Every thing positive that came out of @NATO was due the actions of the other members. Everything negative came from you MrPresident. And that goes for the #TrumpPutinSummit
@realDonaldTrump So @PutinRF_Eng played you like #KimJongUn did - who cares. #Elections, targeted #assignations, #proxywars and the return of #crimea where are we with those?
@realDonaldTrump The one who rightfully denounced you and not sucks up to your base. I guess like @realDonaldTrump suck up to @PutinRF_Eng
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @kilmeade The #Tax cuts for the #rich was a travesty and will be the @GOP ‘s greatest fiscal mistake, since the #TradeWars the lead to the #GreatDepression and not true #TaxReform which I support
@realDonaldTrump No MrPresident, it is that you are incapable and more importantly unwilling of stand up against #dictators, especially those who actually mean us harm. Did you demand Crimea back? did you demand Russia to get out of #Ukraine and #Syria ? Did you demand them to end Cyber #War?
I agree!! And #American ‘s need to say so. This president is not building a better #America or #World, he is simply blowing it up. #hate #crimes are up, #inflation is up, #Trade and #infrastructure is down, as is our standarding in the #World https://t.co/ROz0PMUPyi

@realDonaldTrump America’s #deportations practices created #MS13 now the are driving people out of their own countries to flee to ours. Help round them up there so good people can live their lives in #peace. If the richest and powerful can’t help, who will?
@realDonaldTrump We do need to arrest #IllegalAliens MrPresident as we need to arrest government leaders who enact #policies that deny them and fellow #Americans their #rights.  #Asylum seekers and their children are not criminals, our #administration is.
Because MrPresident you wish to replace them with even worse #immigration #laws Bar 100% from #citizenship (as penalty) Detain 25% (for crime) give 25% PermanentResidency (for merit of #education #DACA built #business or property in US), 50% 3yr #greencards , fines for employers https://t.co/x0arMeYTQt
No we don’t MrPresident; they did not embrace the #ArabSpring, they did not stop the #war, they did not fund the #refugee camps. If you fail to help others you ultimately fail yourself. America and all the members of the @UN need to end #violence &amp; defend #HmanRights. - you could https://t.co/bFIAww8ruL

I agree MrPresident vote out all white male members of the @GOP and bring sanity and security strong. Because “they” like you are weak and ignorant and history will label you and your party as the worst example of both. https://t.co/BJI2jS9XsF
Because you MrPresident &amp; the @GOP have used #immigration as a #dogwhistle as the @DNC has used it as a voting block. Neither of you want to resolve it.

Americans have long held the tittle of #killing more #Americans than ALL other groups combined. If we can't protect us from our own #Gun Culture, banning everyone from foreign countries who have not attached Americans &amp; not ban countries because they gave us #money is pointless https://t.co/BdAf47Rkjw
@realDonaldTrump #NAFTA MrPresident has been good to US, but due to corruption &amp; shortsightedness on #Mexico &amp; #America failed to raise Mexicans out of #poverty. #Mexico was far better position 2 have been #China than China. Its not too late, to make all of N.America stronger #Equality for #NAFTA
@realDonaldTrump #Mexico has not done enough 2 stop DRUGS, nor other countries. Because, like in America @GOP make #DRUGS &amp; #DrugEnforcement into an industry. Drug demand is  reflection of our failure 2 fight #poverty, #education &amp; #healthcare. Buy up raw coca, ban #cannabis &amp; provide #treatment
#EndSexualHarassment #EndGunViolence #EndDiscrimination #EndPoverty #endWar anything less in #America is a failed #Administration

@realDonaldTrump #SafeCommunities MrPresident, are ones where everyone isn't carrying loaded #Gun (a tool specifically designed to kill with little effort) our goal are communities where citizens don't cower behind #guns

@SenatorDurbin continuing #Immigrant reform. Build a better bill. Here is mine: Deny citizenship of all aliens as ultimate penalty. Give #DACADreamers &amp; anyone who invest in US permanent alien residency. Detain/deport criminals. 3yr visa for everyone else. Keep lottery.
@SenatorDurbin heard your @NPR interview. First I think the @DNC is wasting your session. #DNC should be writing #Bills that actually solve our #problems and showing it to #America in contrast to the #Trump chaos. Either you will form national option or win back congress.
@HouseGOP @cvs @Discover @fifththirdbank This is not wage increase, this 1st yr entry level rate.

@realDonaldTrump Is that a map showing the bloodshed of #hate, of #Gun #Violence or is it the red of our #NationalDebt or the increased #TradeDebt under your #administration ?
@realDonaldTrump Several judges disagreed and you yourself said lowest boarder crossings in 45yrs. I bet most Americans would want the $35b to go for national #infrastructure or better yet the $1.5t from #taxreform #scam then you can use the $200m you offered.. for more #BoarderPatrol measures.
@realDonaldTrump We are only 45% the way thru this collective  nightmare we call the #Trump #administration ? Sad!
@realDonaldTrump Thats ok 45yr low in crossings ~ who needs a wall?

@GenJohnKelly say beating UR wife is honorable &amp; performed by men of integrity?  Dose Kelly beat his wife? There is no honor or integrity in oppressing another human being. In fact it is the exact opposite. But they R required in Leadership &amp; Service. Something U R starting 2lack
#ImmigrationReform NOT @GOP #hate. For whatever reason they came, #Legal or #ILLEGALLY, #policies need to be made to endure &amp; achieve our future needs. Logistically you cant deport everyone.

@realDonaldTrump Study after study shows the benefits of #Immigration. I 2agree w/ #merit based, but not by your merits.

@realDonaldTrump We had been for the last 8+ yrs However your #MuslimBan, $1.5trillion giveaway (leaving you only $200b for #infrastructure) Corporate #TaxCuts, failed #Trade #policies &amp; your misguided #ImmigrationReform policies will reverse @BarackObama gains into @GOP @realDonaldTrump failure

@realDonaldTrump You only won the first skirmish in #ImmigrationReform  MrPresident, but you can NEVER #win the #moral high ground
@realDonaldTrump All we learned is what we always knew #Americans need better parties w/ better goals &amp; strategies.

@realDonaldTrump Yes MrPresident, it has been a horrible year of government #greed, power &amp; #corruption. Discrimination, hate &amp; betrayal, by Your administration &amp; the @GOP agenda to destroy the PeoplesGoverment in favor of corporate greed &amp; power of the rich. But 2018 will be better, will be free
@realDonaldTrump It looks, MrPresident as suppression of the will of the #people (2to1) &amp; #OverReach by the admin the @GOP  EVERY #American should #March on #WashingtonDC this weekend &amp; #vote out everyone who signed this #TaxBill because it is just a giveaway to the #rich #CampaignContributers
@RepJasonSmith Why give 1/10th of 1% 42% of the $1.5t ? You could give every man, woman &amp; child $9k. Free healthcare, free electricity, free education, why $700b to people who already too rich by anyone standard?

@realDonaldTrump The bad joke MrPresident is you desire to build a wall to keep drugs out, yet are allowing illegal drugs to be licensed, taxed &amp; sold. Weakening @FdA #drug safeguards &amp; which created the #opioidcrisis after a year paid little more than lip service to the #opioidcrisis.
@realDonaldTrump In june 2015 it was 55'tall 2000mi the it "evolved" to 1000mi w/ windows, what you need is simply boarder guards stationed where they now climb over or tunnel under.

@realDonaldTrump I think ALL #Americans want you to #record ALL your #meetings MrPresident
@realDonaldTrump I think MrPresident THEY along with 99% of #Americans want you &amp; the @GOP to stop paying $1.5trillion to the #Rich for being rich. And NOT cut more #government #Jobs, 2 buy more #weapons. #America needs a better #educated #Workforce &amp; #DACA &amp; #investing in #Americans provide that
@realDonaldTrump ... And because of it, THEY have a higher standard of living than @realDonaldTrump offer #America
@realDonaldTrump What IS out of character is YOU NOT favoring #white #immigrants over #immigrants of #color. Besides no one from #Norway would want 2 live under your #Administration. THEY HAVE &amp; VALUE  #UniversalHealthcare, #PaidLeave #Pension strong #food #safety &amp; #Environmental #regulations ..
@realDonaldTrump MrPresident U have no credibility when it comes 2 denying what U say. The tapes ALWAYS contradict you.

@andersonDrLJA @NFL @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DNC @TheKochBrothers @wallstreet Or favor to live with respect &amp; dignity. #America stands above all nations, because of these promises which we all believe in (for ourselves), but until we ALL work to lift up not only ALL #Americans, but ALL the #World we will continue w/ the #violence that pledges us ALL.
@andersonDrLJA @NFL @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DNC @TheKochBrothers @wallstreet We need to end this course of discourse. To end the power of the wealthy &amp; the corrupt in government. For true #Justice, #Equality &amp; Fairness. To protect the weakest of our society, to promote the general welfare by #diversity,  #Healthcare, #education &amp; #freedom w/out dominance
@andersonDrLJA @NFL @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DNC @TheKochBrothers @wallstreet Our rule of law. Regulations protect ALL of us from discrimination, from harm, from control. They protect our food, water &amp; air. Which protects of family's health &amp; wealth. @andersonDrLJA the administration you support is the evil you swore to defend us from.
@andersonDrLJA @NFL @realDonaldTrump @GOP I personally don't understand why EVERYONE  is not #TakeAKnee at every #NationalAnthem  marching on Washington every month?  America has fallen &amp; the @DNC &amp; the @GOP had forsaken us for @TheKochBrothers @WallStreet &amp; greed. #Trump is dismantling our courts, our diplomacy...
@andersonDrLJA @NFL @realDonaldTrump @GOP Of our citizens by its leaders to blame others for their lot, like that of #Nazi  Germany, undermines OUR freedoms &amp; OUR Government's infrastructure to weaken OUR alliance to the #Constitution  for the whims of the #Plutocracy ... It is a true betrayal of The United States
@andersonDrLJA @NFL Our president @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have no plan, but to further the control of the wealth &amp; this country away from EVERYTHING that it once held sacred. Sacrificing morality of faith for discrimination of faith. Sacrificing diversity for hate. The manipulation...
@andersonDrLJA @NFL Represents #America, not just the sacrifice of those who died in its name. The myth of America is that it stand for #Justice, #Equality &amp; #fairness, but continues to fail as our Government is being controlled by wealth &amp; discrimination. Both parties have been corrupted...
@andersonDrLJA @NFL is not sacred! This country has real problems... Its greatest threat. Divided by #hate &amp; #fear, #inequality &amp; its perception; in wealth, power, race, faith which continues to expand. We have No Moral Leadership, no governance &amp; no plan to fix anything. The anthem...

@thebeej1966 IF you had bothered to read my tweets you would see I support a 25% corporate tax, and a 25% flat tax. and I always have
@thebeej1966 it can be, but in this case Trumps polls are rock bottom here &amp; aboard.
@thebeej1966 apparently I'm not as well educated or informed as you. You obviously know something the rest of the world doesn't
@thebeej1966 Again I'm sorry, but EVERYTHING he has done has damaged this country and that's also effects the world. He is by ALL accounts the worst prez
@thebeej1966 China wants 50% robot workforce, because their works want more money. population grows &amp; tech needs less people to do everything.
@thebeej1966 it has nothing to do with taxes. I am head of design for a world-wide-brand jobs are gone for lower wages &amp;/or automation
@thebeej1966 that is such a lie. US Corp is like 3 or 4th highest, but they pay no more than 25%, most like Trump argued in '91 pay 0% just google it
@thebeej1966 again what he says has nothing to do with what he does. Read the actual Bills &amp; ExcOrders, because that is the truth
@thebeej1966 One is correct &amp; one is not. I support Estate Taxes, because not having one makes the economy unstable.  U might need to read more economics
@thebeej1966 listen less to what they are saying and simply ReadTheBills that's where the truth is, not anything I say or they say
@thebeej1966 they built a database to remove people with ethnic names of the rolls in key states. look obviously you believe Trump &amp; 4 that I'm  sorry
@thebeej1966 its not for the middleclass and the poor. neither is corporate tax, nothing that increase the debt... none of it is for them.
@thebeej1966 google it. when he was crashing &amp; burning at the convention they stepped in. Forced Bannon and his friends on Trump
@thebeej1966 see Robert Mercer and his daughter they not only own #Trump they suppressed the vote using his computer program. The're the crooks you fear
@thebeej1966 &amp; they do nothing but screw over people. They own #Trump &amp; if they get their way... $30+billion in #taxcuts JUST FOR THEM. see Koch Brothers
@thebeej1966 I completely agree, nor should the #republicans, unfortunately 80% are in the back pocket of three riches billionaires in the US...
