@Susan_Economist @DebFlemingmedia @NAACP @TheRevAl @RevDrBarber Apologies, I'm not sure what you mean by "the former today."  But this does seem to be a framework designed to impose costs upon actual discovery of something suspected of being human remains, rather than costs because of a broader community awareness of where remains might be.
@Susan_Economist @DebFlemingmedia @NAACP @TheRevAl @RevDrBarber The bottom of the article explains it; until it is clear if/where remains are, the State does not have an active role.   Under current law, one has to hope that a developer who encounters remains or possible remains would then comply with this law.
@Susan_Economist @DebFlemingmedia @NAACP @TheRevAl @RevDrBarber This section does not apply only to Native American remains.

@rtackhooper @TNJ_malbright Indeed.  Curious how these laws shift other behavior, too.
@TNJ_malbright And in fact that does happen sometimes, but usually only on policy/legislation/votes, and not on constituent services.  I'm curious -- how much $$$ is spent on FOIA compliance (including review/redaction) in other states, particularly those with gold-standard FOIA laws?
@MargieTrenDE I'm not sure the specific %, but it's not insubstantial.  I'd add to that all the other emails we get expressing constituents' viewpoints on issues (which, often, they probably wouldn't want made public). Transparency is critical; I'm just noting that its costs $$$ to administer.
One difference (in theory) is that legislators are directly accountable to voters.  Ask us questions, then vote or not vote for us.  Executive branch agencies are not directly accountable to voters, and so FOIA monitoring is a tool.  But incumbency advantage might trump theory. https://t.co/QQG8a9r5MX
We could, and there's good reason to open up access.  But it's also important to note that it costs $$$ -- often serious $$$ -- to review all the emails, redact sensitive information, etc.  My point is that it's not a simple and one-sided as some people assume. https://t.co/9khVT1OEi6
A legit concern with email access is the many constituents who send me emails but might not want the public to know their loved ones are struggling with addiction, or subject to bullying, or suffering from dementia.  It costs taxpayer $$$ to review/redact that kind of info. https://t.co/NsfDkeLNY3
