@CoryBooker What made you change your mind from voting against drug reimportation to being a cosponsor for @SenFranken S. 771?
Will be interesting to see how many moderates they will sacrifice to appease the @freedomcaucus, and whether it will be enough to pass #AHCA
This backdoor amendment is trying to get more conservatives on board who see EHBs as overreaching and moderates who's constituents want EHBs
#MacArthurAmendment to #AHCA reaffirms Essential Health Benefits as federal standard but allows states to get waivers to avoid offering EHBs

@SenFranken Would also allow for the importation of drugs from Canada, which @BernieSanders and @SenJohnMcCain have both introduced bills to allow.

@HouseGOP Interesting that it was proposed by @freedomcaucus members. More to come after congressional recess #GOPgettingcloser #AngryTownHallsAwait
@HouseGOP The #AHCA would allow companies to charge sicker people more, and a federal cost sharing will cost closer to $100 million a year.
@HouseGOP However, the new GOP amendment only allocates $15 billion to insurance companies over 10 years, plus other unallocated funds.
@HouseGOP These programs did lower premiums for high-risk patients, and some insurance companies requested they continue past their 2016 end date.
@HouseGOP are adding a Federal Risk Sharing Program to the #AHCA, which is nearly identical to #ACA reinsurance and risk corridor programs.
This will destabilize the insurance market by decreasing costs for the healthy and drastically increase prices for the sick. #NotASolution
Allowing the sale of plans across state lines, coupled with deregulation, will create a "race to the bottom" to sell cheap, bare bones plans
This cutting of all global health aid to NGO's who perform abortions will include HIV/AIDS as well as maternal and child health funds.
@POTUS reinstated the #MCP early this year, and added the canceling of all global health aid to NGO's who used any funding on abortions.
Past enactments of the #MCP have shown increased rates of safe/unsafe abortion due to decreased access to contraceptives.
The #MexicoCityPolicy cancels aid of foreign NGO's that use US and non-US funding for abortions as a means of family planning.
#AHCA vote postponed in the House as @HouseGOP did not have the votes to pass. The Freedom Caucus will play a bigger role in any new bill.
House  debates and will vote on #AHCA. In case you want to watch some riveting #CSPAN today...	https://t.co/7cbvdNfbZO
By establishing a market of plans that only appeal to wealthy/healthy, health care costs will rise for everyone, especially sick/poor.
@HouseGOP have not reinvented the wheel with the #AHCA. They're simply doubling down on strategies that have proven to be ineffective.
HRA's and HSA's alike offer no tax incentives to the poor who already don't pay federal income tax. #HaveNotWorkedSince2003
The RAND experiment showed people will see the doctor less often and the health impact was greatest on the poor. 	https://t.co/1XkaOxlpQU

That's great, but how?? HSA's, high risk pools and no mandates have yet to be shown effective. I'll expand in the coming days #ShowUsAPlan https://t.co/0i1QIiaUs7
This plan leaves the door open for people like his guest, who suffer from pre-existing conditions, to be denied care. #showustheplan

@SpeakerRyan's "Better Way" (which is not yet been submitted as legislation) transforms Medicaid into a block grant system.
@SecPriceMD's H.R.2300 (introduced last session), went all the way to the right and simply seeks to repeal all Medicaid expansion from ACA.
In response, @RandPaul S.222 bill  sought to go further right, allowing states to withdraw from the expanded Medicaid system.
Moderate Rep.'s favor Sen. @BillCassidy S.191, which would maintain Medicaid's status as an entitlement program.
@SpeakerRyan says legislation is coming soon. Multiple bills reflect range of conservative solutions to the "collapsing" ACA. https://t.co/bHK6qCxEnH
