@kcul7777 @politico Thanks for the advice good sir.  	After spending 80 years here on earth, I've been startled awake since 1981.  	I honestly think Jimmy Carter was the best President to serve.  1977-1981 when no War was done.  I do support our Maverick President because he gets things done.

After 100+years without a business-man in the Presidency our nation has floundered deep into debt.  Pres Trump hired a number of successful-wealthy men and women to run the nation.  They, for the most part have done a great job.  Let's give them a chance, without chastising.

@BreitbartNews Mr. Slater.  Do you not understand why President Trump is needed?  	After a Hundred years or so we finally have a businessman as CEO for America.  	He's hired the best business leaders he could find and those leaders are trying to make our nation better.  Get with the program.
@POTUS @VP I read the NY Times for 50+ years. After they hired incompetent Editors I canceled my subscription. They were running Obama's picture in the upper right hand corner of their front page, 	EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Propaganda is an unnecessary evil in the USA.
Hi Bill.	The opposition to President Trump shows a lack of common sense.  	@POTUS @VP All we can do is watch the Democrat Party sink into the sea.  	Certain disaster and none of them will admit to being wrong.  Their hatred 	has no rhyme or reason to support it.  It is sad. https://t.co/upu9tiNwTL
@foxandfriends Senator Rand Paul; Thank you.  	President Trump is working to improve America's status.  	He does not mind laying the facts on the table and saying that enough is enough.  NATO's been bankrupt for years, because EU members do not pay their bills. @POTUS @VP
FAKE NEWS has attacked President Trump.  	They've hired Retired Intelligence Officers to attack the President while he is/was out of the country, and working to repair years of damages by prior administrations. 	@POTUS @VP  Cleaning the Swamp is necessary but not easy.  Sic 'em.
Some years earlier, the NSA General had his office made into a space ship.  	There are some really nutty people in charge of our Intel.  The State Dept used to run the CIA.  Now the ex-director of the CIA is the Secty of State.  Go Figure.  We could wake up to a whole new world.
Yeah, Trump won because he played by the rules.  Hillary and company didn't even know the rules.  	Remember when Trump had to visit Intel HQ and tell them he supported their efforts.  Well, it's like their leadership became the three stooges today on CNN.  BOING !!! https://t.co/GHsaPRIwJa
Opinionated Garbage, printed by CORPORATE PROPAGANDA interests has destroyed Hillary Clinton's Bankrupted "DNC" aka: DEMOCRAT PARTY, or simply as "toast".  	As a by-product, a NEW youthful POLITICAL PARTY is being formed as this Tweet is being written.  I wish them good luck.
@nytopinion CRAP NEWS is NEW YORK TIMES NEWS.
Makes you wonder...  What Government Agency allowed a Tour Boat in the area? ⚡️ “Lava bomb hits tour boat in Hawaii, injuring at least 13”		https://t.co/MDQAk3oDNF
Everyone who slams Hillary and Bill Clinton somehow live short lives.   ⚡️ “Anthony Bourdain slams Hillary and Bill Clinton in his final interview”		https://t.co/ObsulvfGO2
Black Women in the NEWS.  it's a fine old world for Gossip about Black Women and their DOWN-TRODEDNESS.  I see these Gossip News articles and wonder where the Pay-Pal indicator is on their Web-Sites.  The NYTimes leads the nation is CRAP NEWS. https://t.co/yJxcIr3lud
Mueller is highly paid to use Detention, Pain &amp; Fear as his tools of trade.  He runs "America's Gestapo" with hundreds of troops under his command. FAKE NEWS (Gossip Journalist's) never inquire into Mueller's possible unlawful investigative methods.  No spotlights on his work. https://t.co/pDuVr9KDND
For those of you who want to build a better nation - I urge you to read every Presidential Executive Order issued.  Once you start you will never want to stop.  With each President, begin within the 3 or 4 weeks after each inauguration.  Read very - very carefully.
Every Election since Gerald Ford's (Non-election by popular vote.).  Has cost our nation dearly. Ford's White House Staffers included Cheney, Rumsfeld, and HW Bush.  Those of you who know, or want to know, can research how these men used greed to destroy our once great nation.
News Media is paid by Politicians via Advertising Dollars. Politicians expect the Media to make people think that any 2 or more Paid Employees can voice intelligent political opinions. It's hiring a hypnotist to sell "Bigotry".  Just look for the Pay-Pal icon on their Site.
You are young enough to be my son.  Billions on the earth are living longer today.  	Looks like a new more youthful political party is in the process of being formed.  	Democrats will be throwing in the towel.  They had no plan "b" when Hillary lost.  	Mad at the winner?  Ha! https://t.co/ewFTt6rwFR
Our "cut a deal" legal system sucks.

@RealJamesWoods It's just another SCAM.  It always has been a SCAM.  	I wish the IRS would look a bit closer.
We will probably call her SCOUT. https://t.co/STAPqcJyIq
@mitchellvii Trade wars are never won or lost.  There's just too many loopholes available.
@RealJamesWoods James - Maybe Hillary just needs to tell it like it is before the Congress impeaches the Deputy AG, exposing her.  Congressional Democrats will have to change quickly now. There's a new political party gathering.  It is young, eager and strong, likely to replace them next year.
It is time to do FACT CHECK on individual FAKE NEWS MEDIA's Opinionated Reporters and their hidden Editors or higher level Decision Makers who attempt to slide garbage through their systems.
Our President Trump works 24/7 to make America Great.  	It is not a lie.  He wanted the job and can do the job.  	We all should support him.  His Quest is Our Quest. https://t.co/Gcx2NyDA2b

Remember Hillary lent them all that money, with strings.  She may be pulling on them still.  The overt Treasonous Acts that Hillary committed involve the DNC and the National Convention (a different corporation).  FBI &amp; Justice Dept ignore that. https://t.co/xbJUT3Lqa9
NYTIMES Editor  @nytimes	You guys are picking scabs.  What a load of horse hockey you sell.  	The President owns a golf course.  So what?  	He can say what he wants. https://t.co/G7YoQ0WgJD

CITIZENS OF AMERICA	Please save your National Healthcare Plan.  	Write your Congressman, tell him or her NOT TO USE HEALTH INSURANCE.  	It is the WRONG TOOL.
Mr. President,  @realDonaldTrump Obamacare was broken when it started.  Actuaries had the wrong premise in the beginning.  They priced-premiums expecting a mix of sick and well insureds.  What they got was sick insured's.  	The well ones didn't play the game.  Broken it was. https://t.co/UVkoTwBdQW
EVIL DOTH SHINE. https://t.co/Knm42875bQ
President Trump  @POTUS @VP  	Any National Healthcare Program does not need Corporate Insurance involved.  	Health Insurance was a scam to begin with, and over 100 years, has continued.  	to become an intentional International Deception.  Clean the Swamp.
The majority of democrats live in the cities where votes do not reflect how the grass-roots feel about our Congress's performance during the Bush &amp; Obama administrations.  The current Congress is a stagnation-personified Democrat Party ignorant of needed NEW BLOOD in charge. https://t.co/oxHeOsXCk1

Hillary's thousands of emails were found on "felon" Weiner's bedroom computer.  	Now there's a thought I find a bit more than disgusting.  Weiner married to Hillary's favorite INTERN, who worked as her assistant.  Hillary &amp; Bill both had INTERNS.  Makes sense.  Still Disgusting. https://t.co/Akhkcx7JBt
Hillary lent the bankrupt DNC $10 Million.  But demanded that she run things, and she did.  Right into the ground.  Her Overt act of Treason included a separate Corporation the National Convention.  We don't hang or shoot our bad Politicians.  	Mores the pity. https://t.co/kCgfaAMHR8
@mitchellvii Mueller is milking this for all he can get (money-wise).  There was an article I read when he was first appointed that outlined what would occur.  And it has.  	Democrats are led by the old and infirm in mind and body.  They have really cost 	America's Taxed Payers a bundle.
@nytimes CAMERA ANGLES
"WELL YEAH" said the California Girl.  The DNC was broke and Hillary bought it, lock, stock and barrel.    	Could anyone imagine Hillary could spend a $Billion Dollars to garner votes in Population Centers but never do a Grassroots Tour?  That's the thinking of an Alcoholic. https://t.co/kCgfaAMHR8

@RealJamesWoods Well, you just have to shake your head and smile at the antics of fools having fun.  	It's called Free Speech and Free Expression as a sub-of Free Speech.
@RealJamesWoods Obama is a Muslim in thought and deed.
@AnnCoulter @sjgiardini Right again.  Ann, you are consistent.  	Any thoughts on the Healthcare Plan that Congress will be pushing?  	We really need one without Corporate Insurance participation.  	I say that to get your attention to another path that will work.  	Think about it...
HI Lee.	Peter Strzok gave Hillary a pass.  Bill Clinton and Hillary each had their own Intern's.  Sex makes the world turn. Hillary's emails were found on a computer in a bedroom of ex-Congressman Wiener, a felon, married to Hillary's Intern. Funny Huh? https://t.co/q5c3HXyMqr
@TWDOurWorld Sorry guys, I miss-sent the Tweet.
@TWDOurWorld He is like a caged animal, we can only hope the FBI's new Director has implemented new policies to prevent mental midgets from rising to high office.  Perhaps, making Hilary Clinton answer a few more queries would be the right thing to do.
@nytimes I like John Schnatter and applaud his stance.  Too much nonsense is going around. Most of it is by Racer's themselves.  You can tell by the Pay-Pal solicitations on their web-sites.  It's not about hurt feelings.  It's about the money.
@TaxReformExpert @mitchellvii Gee Wiz Julio, that all sounds interesting.  Like the Housing Bubble.  	Should be easier for all concerned just to sit down and hash things out.  	Of course Consultants, IRS, CPA's, Actuaries, Salesmen and Regulators might not like losing some of their incomes.
@nytimes She could and should bow out, but the money probably was advanced and there's no way Sarah Palin will pass that up.
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Time to say good-bye to the incumbents this mid-term.  	California needs to consider the shabby way Democrats have left the State.  	All the major cities are rife with homeless-helpless-hopeless.  	My town misplaced $8million sewer funds, now it's a bookkeeping errrorrr.
@RealJamesWoods Old News James.  Slow news day with the President out of town.
Charlie, You are right.  But the reason is Political Corruption.  	In the '60s I took a flight from LA to Midway in Chicago. 	Read and enjoyed the LA papers on the plane. 	In Chicago, I passed a news-stand and the HATE and FAKE News was sickening.  	Today, the Mayor is ??? https://t.co/WVTI4KCSvs
@HarvardBiz Younger, more hardy, and much more malleable.
@charliekirk11 Charlie, The violence is to cloak what the media is trying to do.	Worldwide "News Media is testing to see how much impact they can have" in the Mid-Terms.  The UK's Guardian has moved into (minor) US markets for Political Advertising.  Worldwide in scope, $'s are their salvation.
@mitchellvii Hello Bill,	A funny thing about Hillary's Hens. 	They are Democrat(s) who watch and listen and slowly begin to believe the 4 or 5 FAKE NEWS EMPLOYEES who sit in a 1/2 circle and Gossip like Hens.
@NickyBeaster We better get used to being HOT.  The world is heating up and CO2 has nothing to do with it.  Pray that it stops in the next few years, like it did before the little Ice Age.  	Otherwise we're toast.
@nytimes NAW...  Oakland, California has been known for VIOLENCE for 50 years.  	Tourists avoid Oakland, California like the plague.  	The only time my family traveled their for a NFL game, their Van was ransacked while they were inside the stadium.  We knew better than to go to Oakland.
I spent 2017 Boycotting the NFL so, 2018 spent Boycotting the NFL looks like fun.  Maybe "the Players left" will be getting smaller paychecks soon.  	They are being complete idiots for not "asking-in-advance" for their Fan's Support for their complaints. https://t.co/F7ibuuzhZM
@DailyInsurance_ Are you in the insurance business, or know a bit about how insurance really works?  Not premium collections, or claim payments.  Do you know how insurance is designed and could you construct an insurance company from scratch?  Interested in my query?
@bryanbehar Please don't worry. 	The Supreme Court is a "nuts and bolts" organization used to benefit us all..  	I hope a national healthcare program is being designed by the Congress using tools other than "Health Insurance", which has been used to bilk American's for over 100 years.
@RealJamesWoods Tweeted NYTimes Opinion reporter's about MISTAKES made by using HEALTH INSURANCE as a TOOL for State and National Health Care programs.  For 100+years since the advent of Health Insurance, American's have been led astray by Nationwide $Trillion Dollar Scams.
@RealJamesWoods I just came off of a 30-60 day suspension from Twitter.  I was feeling like they had been right, but lo and behold they sent me an apology letter for their mistake.  James, I will support you in my mind and Tweets.  Keep the faith, as we need more like you.
@nytopinion Mr. Behr, Common sense says; "You are right".  	I'm 80yr old looking for a NYT reporter to push for National Healthcare that works. Using ERISA-1974, I built a Health Care Trust that worked.  Now in my terminal years I want to give back helpful knowledge.  Any interest?
@nytopinion I'VE BEEN READING THE NYT 60+YEARS	American's who care about this NATIONAL HEALTHCARE PROBLEM. 	have no way to provide informative solutions.  	I owned and operated a small to medium sized Healthcare Trust.  	I have answers that make sense.  Interested?
@GeniusIQ1790 From me to me.  Convincing anyone of the TRUTH is DIFFICULT.	HEALTH INSURANCE is the wrong tool  THE WRONG TOOL TO USE in today's PROPOSED NATIONAL Health-Care-Reimbursement for services rendered.  	IN EFFECT we HEAVILY-TAXED-PAYERS are spending 150% MORE THAN IS NECESSARY.
is it working now?
@JohnLegere @TMobile @netflix I think I found my spot.  	John, I'm a bit too old for your very nice tweets.  	My son has your services.  	Good Luck

@GeniusIQ1790 @Resolver @FoxNews Medicare scammed by US Big Pharma and Foreign Drug Cartel Pharmacy Networks for 60 years. Maryland Gov'r is pissed. True or False?
@GeniusIQ1790 @Resolver Thanks Resolver. want put 100% Healthcare before Congress but one of them has to submit it in Bill format.  I'm old man, tough to get going.
