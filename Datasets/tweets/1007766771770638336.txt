@RepGosar How about you say the same thing using FACTS, how many terrorist, names? How about the overall Republican strategy for imigration? Oh that's right you don't have one just a strategy to scare people. Is this your drug war strategy? The opioid crisis was big business, do your job!
@emilynussbaum I think Dale should be given airtime for a rebuttal, Trump and Sanders both have been proven to be habitual liars, the American people deserve to expect the truth from their President
@maggieNYT If anyone but Fox carries this it is just enabling, all the networks and news outlets are fully aware of the lying and distraction moves, airing this is promoting and enabling pure propaganda. The border scare tactics are proven lies, ask Chris Wallace!
@joshscampbell Maybe we should just pass a law that says the President can't lie to the American people, Trump would be sentenced to life in prison if we could get that passed, and that's just for his Tweets from today!
@davidmweissman We need a wall around the South, all that Coke coming in from Atlanta!

@Karandikar18 JFK assasination, Bobby Shriver was in my class and they came and removed him from class.

@KellyO Why don't we call it invisible, why don't we make it part of an actually strategy for imigration reform... Oh hell, call it what it really is, a distraction from your incompetence
@SangerNYT @realDonaldTrump Trumps staff or what's left of it must must feel like Linda Blair in the Exorcist with all the position changes. Kevin McCarthy looked like he was going to have a stroke yesterday when Trump said, I can do that, I might still do that, oh no what's he committing us to NOW call 911
@KellyO @realDonaldTrump Why can't we use the steel plate in his head that is causing him to talk through his ass?
@realDonaldTrump 9 out of 10 people that talk about themselves in the third person are Institutionalized, I would be happy to make a reservation for you tonight
@SenatorSinema Just don't criticize Republicans
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you can build a wall around their manufacturing plants
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I think one of the "other topics" should be drafting your resignation speech, the phrase " I am not a crook" has already been used. "I am guilty as hell, even the per tape was true" is still available
@JDaIey Waymos
@1pissedPolack You bring a lot of smiles and joy to the people on here, you got this!
@realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT Donnie, could just tell us who in the prior administration said this? If you can't then stop asking us to believe ANYTHING you say  The thing is Donnie once you lose peoples trust it is hard for them to believe you again. You my friend LIE constantly, so either put up or shut-up!
@Dax_x98 I will be 66, but 43 of those have been clean &amp; sobah!
@realDonaldTrump Sadly,  I will not feel REAL secure until you resign or  are walled off from the American people
@realDonaldTrump Do you know what kind of message it sends to our young people when you don't take responsibility for ANYTHING and you lie Everytime you move your lips.
@NikkiHaley Another way of saying " Thanks Obama"
@SenSanders I am sure that will be the mandate for the Space Force, they certainly will need something to do!
RT @funder: .@realDonaldTrump-Everyone who retweets this thinks your New Year‚Äôs resolution should be to resign. #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump ... Remember this. Throughout the ages somethings never change, honesty and integrity, who is going to pay for the WALL? Mexico! Who said this for over 2 years? Not Democrats, that was  the you, now own up to YOUR mistake and reopen the government! I will let you have a lollipop!
@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, I meant to say I am on the Oval throne not the Oval office. If I am going to tweet out shit, I like to have ready access to it!
@realDonaldTrump The only concrete are the pieces rolling around in your head. The only thing abandoned was the promise you made that Mexico would pay for it. The only thing that is see through are all the lies you tell the American people every day!
@LindseyGrahamSC If reports are accurate that Donald Trump is still president aligning with Republicans we also have a disaster in the making
@realDonaldTrump I am in a bar playing a game of Trivia, the first question was who is going to pay for the wall, do you know what the answer was Donnie? Multiple choice A) Democrats B) Russians C) Robert Mueller D) MEXICO amazingly the answer was NOT A!
@realDonaldTrump When you have your next rally and you say who is going to pay for the wall? Should we change Federal Workers, Federal Workers?  That doesn't have the same feeling, doesMullvany know he has to dial 011+52+ when calling Mexico, let's do this Donnie, who is going to pay for the wall
@realDonaldTrump I am not sure Fox news covered this but Mexico has a new president, his name is Enrique, if you need help with translating my kids know Spanish. You are an amazing con man, con Mexico into paying for the wall, like you conned voters that you would actually work hard as president!
@realDonaldTrump Now get off the damn phone with China and call Mexico, show us those amazing negotiation skills, you can do this Donald, I know your father had no confidence in you, but you got this! MEXICO Is paying for the wall!
@realDonaldTrump You said over and over and over "who is going to pay for the wall" not once did the response come back as "the Democrats". We all know the answer is MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL?

@johnpavlovitz I miss playing games like Charades and Pictionary with my Mom, she absolutely sucked at both but her hand motions made us laugh hysterically.
@johnpavlovitz I miss my father laughing to the point of tears talking to his best friend Lenny Benson every time the talked in person or on the phone.
