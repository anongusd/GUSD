On @CBSThisMorning today, I asked former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe whether President Trump would finish out his term. His response: "I think the overwhelming likelihood is that he will." https://t.co/WUMvDC9mJ4
My latest for @TheAtlantic -- Michael Cohen's Made for TV Mea Culpa: https://t.co/TvbEMuVoM0
I am not ready to watch Bryce Harper play for the Phillies.
CPAC is taking place less than 10 miles away from Capitol Hill, where Michael Cohen is testifying (behind closed doors) about Trump being a racist, a conman, and cheat. Might as well be another universe: https://t.co/kQUWZ37DMY
Rep Cummings issues “Come on, now!” real talk to everyone, but especially perhaps his Republican colleagues. “We’re better than this!”
Cohen closing out this hearing by weighing in on completely unrelated issues including: Trump’s child separation policy, his shutdown strategy and his foreign policy isolationism. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Prison *has* to be better than this" https://t.co/DefDAsZK22
It's unfortunate that this hearing is going to end with a back and forth over whether Mark Meadows is a racist.
I believe that @RashidaTlaib effectively just called @MarkMeadows a racist.
FYI This is Matthew Calamari: https://t.co/97Nkq6f2X3
Also very shrewd strategy for subpoenaing Trump's tax returns, and ordering a number of his associates to the Hill for testimony. https://t.co/IOOyFQRIrn
. @AOC is laying the groundwork for the Oversight Committee subpoenaing Trump's tax returns.
Lot of confusion about Trump Org CFO Allen Weisselberg and his deal with the feds: he was provided immunity to testify before a grand jury, but is (apparently) NOT a cooperating witness https://t.co/kksJYbuRme
Cohen says Trump did not want to release his tax returns because he'd be audited. But...the reason Trump didn't release his returns in the first place is because he said he was under audit. Hmmm.
The Dems have three stars batting cleanup on Cohen questioning: ⁦@AOC⁩ ⁦@AyannaPressley⁩ and ⁦@RashidaTlaib⁩ will close out the hearing for the Dems today https://t.co/TKngbjGTRw
This is a BIG DEAL: Cohen says he can provide copies of all 11 checks paid to him by Trump as reimbursement for the Stormy Daniels hush money.
"'Michael, there's no Russia, there's no collusion'... that's the message that [Trump] wanted to reinforce."
Republican committee members seem unconcerned that calling the President's close associate/fixer/consigliere a "pathological liar" in any way reflects badly on the president himself.
Cohen is literally begging the House GOP to ask him about his submitted documents. So far no takers. https://t.co/ZBV3mZ6yj6
GOP now focusing on Lanny Davis, Cohen's lawyer. Still not a single question from the R side of the aisle on any of the evidence Cohen has presented.
Reminder: Trump Org CFO Allen Weisselberg seems to have been in the middle of all of the hush money payments and is now cooperating with the feds.
"Shame on you, Mr. Jordan... I made mistakes and I own them." 💣💣💣💣
I believe this is what we call "neutralizing the opposition." https://t.co/cobvayGB7s
Yesterday, I spoke to GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who said any documents Cohen produced during his testimony would be duly considered. So far, no interest from any Republicans on the committee in examining Cohen's presented documents.
You are not crazy but this is all crazy. https://t.co/H94HUa7vee
Cohen cant answer a question about "how many women" he was directed to pay off on Trump's behalf from 2015-2016. Says it's definitely" the two we know about (Daniels and McDougal). Hmmm.
It's either irony or comeuppance that @DWStweets gets to ask the first question about Trump's alleged role in the Wikileaks DNC dump.
Seems to me that—strategically—the Rs on the Oversight committee have to spend at least *some* amount of time questioning Cohen on his actual allegations, rather than discrediting his testimony on whole. Just in case he's, y'know, telling the truth.
@KatyTurNBC Girl PREACH
Trump signing hush money reimbursement checks—in the Oval Office, from his *personal checking account*—is almost too crazy to process. Almost.
The fact that the alleged reimbursement checks to Cohen are in the *exact same amounts* makes it harder to suggest that they were just paybacks for normal expenses. Either sloppy or brazen or both.
"A lot of people have asked me whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked DNC emails ahead of time. The answer is yes."
"For the record, Individual #1 is President Donald J Trump." And here we go.
"He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat." (He is also the President of the United States.)
Cummings opens up Cohen hearing with a salvo to his Republican counterparts: "The days of this committee protecting this President at all cost... are over."
In the room, Cohen taking his seat, let it begin ⁦⁦@SHO_TheCircus⁩ https://t.co/OCKRGqNY8b
Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee is subpoenaing Trump administration records pertaining to family separations at the border, which committee chair @RepCummings is calling "government-sponsored child abuse." https://t.co/5cZ8B2bpyY

“I’ve already done a lot of wall for the election — 2020.” (This is a fairly revealing quote)
@fivefifths Scarier than gang members let me tell you

Renovate the Wall
There is no TelePrompTer for these National Emergency declaration remarks and Trump is not really looking down at notes. This is the stuff that administration-wide panic attacks are made of.

@Its_Just_J1 Exactly
Now that Mueller’s revealed he’s onto Manafort’s lies and Cohens lies, gotta wonder how badly Trump would like to revise that written testimony he submitted last week.
Manafort had a plea deal and continued to backchannel to Trump, presumably in the hopes of a pardon. Cohen had no deal but went out of his way to cooperate with Mueller, in the hopes of reduced sentencing. A study in contrasts — will be interesting to see whose bet pays off.
Cohen will say he lied to Congress. About what? Here are some of the topics he likely addressed in that closed-door testimony: Russian involvement 2016, Trump’s involvement in Russian collusion, the Steele Dossier, and plans for a Trump property in Moscow: https://t.co/Uyko7NM6D5

Collins is bringing up the silimiarity between Merrick Garland’s rulings and those of Brett Kavanaugh. This seems, especially right now, pretty unwise strategy.
Collins remarks almost sound as if they were written before Dr Fords allegations even became public. She hasn’t mentioned ANY of the issues that have brought us to this moment: allegations, temperament, truthfulness.
Has Collins even mentioned Dr Ford?
Collins, far from being swayed by the voices of survivors, appears frustrated and angered by the chaos they have caused in the institution. https://t.co/ucvbcpKt0P
For anyone who thought Collins would not have called national attention to her vote unless she was voting No—it appears to be quite the opposite: she’s using the moment to criticize the opposition, full stop.
It is *Peak Flake* to open the door -- however slightly -- to his Yes vote somehow changing, after a week of suggesting his support for Kavanaugh might be changing, only to have it not change at all. https://t.co/i9mmbzAjBS

Fmr Justice John Paul Stevens calls Kavanaugh's behavior disqualifying. Chief Justice Roberts, not public w/his thoughts, may very well concur: Kavanaugh's presence on the bench will likely inflame partisanship that ultimately erodes the Court's legitimacy https://t.co/LCpxcdDk6b

Part of me imagined that -- just for the naked political calculation of needing some kind of platform to actually run on in 2020 -- Flake would be a No on Kavanaugh. Guess not.
This moment feels as pivotal, as gut-wrenching, as high stakes as Election Day 2016.

Lindsey Graham has a lot of nerve going after Democrats for unduly delaying a Supreme Court nomination.
Why. Doesn't. Kavanaugh. Want. An. Investigation?
Kavanaugh is indignant about using a high school yearbook entry as part of a Supreme Court confirmation....but eager to use a high school calendar instead?
The asymmetry of Mitchell's questions -- asking Kavanaugh in great detail about the alleged assault and refusing to ask Ford about the assault at all -- is glaring.
Not only reasonable but urgent https://t.co/gWYHAvxU1s
Didnt realize that Mitchell would be asking Kavanaugh questions as well -- this seems like a major disadvantage. He (badly) needs a sympathetic line of questioning from the GOP.
Too many points, too much detail, too much emotion, too many attacks. https://t.co/sb0pXUGqbf
I would bet that Trump likes the pugilism and anger but loathes the tears and emotional outpouring.
It seems like Kavanaugh should have perhaps had another pair of eyes on this statement before he delivered it to the nation.
The calendar defense is thin... and I keep a good calendar.
Ford was polite, deferential and accommodating. Kavanaugh is loud, angry and aggressive. Tells you a lot about what we expect from women and what we allow on the part of men.

As much as Trump probably hates this entire Ford-Kavanaugh story, he’s gotta be pretty stoked that it drowned out Toad coverage.
Despite the fact that Trump is asserting the FBI “doesn’t want” to investigate the Ford allegations—and Republicans’ contention that such a process is unnecessary—it seems pretty hard to believe that the FBI won’t do a background check on this and doesn’t believe it should.
Trump calls only on One America News and FOX — no other American news outlets — at today’s presser, on a day/in a week full of news.
Trump says — repeatedly—that he “feels terribly” for Kavanaugh but summons no empathy for Ford, whom he refers to as “the woman.”

Clarification: the government has, as yet, done nothing to reunite migrant children whose parents have been deported. We are awaiting word on what the plan may be (if there is indeed a plan). In the meantime, hundreds of migrant children remain in US custody without their parents https://t.co/TFyhNsWhig
@JamesSurowiecki @DLind We can tweet-parse “not found to be eligible” vs “ineligible” all day long, but I think it’s gross overstatement to suggest that concluding ineligibility is factually inaccurate. Thanks for the feedback though.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLind The government’s “forthcoming plan” is in my story, as is the analysis from the groups who are (actually) working to reunite these families.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLind How can they be “eligibile” if all “eligible” reunifications have been complete? The government has been unable or unwilling to demonstrate these families are a priority in any way.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLind ICE said yesterday it expected to complete all “eligible” reunifications by midnight Thursday, Pacific time. I’m not sure what is “blatantly untrue” about concluding that families of deportees are therefore not eligible, as the status reports suggest.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLind Blatantly untrue?
@DLind I would hardly say its "baseless" to claim that the US govt has no intention of reuniting these families, but I appreciate the criticism and will do more to clarify.
@DLind 1) Govt says reunifications are complete for eligible families, indicating an intention to exclude deportees. Coupled w the absence o plan (or indication of a plan) + the fact that many deportees are on the move in their host countries, intention to facilitate a reunion is dim.
@DLind Groups I’ve spoken to say that they have seen no indication of a priority or plan — from the govt— to reunite the deportees with their children. Requests for clarification/comment/clarity from the govt have gone unanswered.
@DLind The government insists the deported parents are not “eligible” for reunification. All present action is being taken by outside groups, none of whom have received help from the government. The govt has further not made any indication that it intends to change that policy.

In a hearing today, the ACLU + DoJ agree migrant parents can waive the right to reunification w/child or waive the child's release rights under the Flores settlement. So: kids can stay w/their parents in detention or parents can allow their kids to be released to the US govt.

It’s hard for me to reconcile the fact that we’re a society enlightened enough to establish and support a free press—and depraved and brutal enough to slaughter that very same press.
What. Is. Happening.
Liberal jurisprudence would not have to depend on an 85 year-old’s workout regime if perhaps RBG had opted to retire when Democrats held the WH and Senate. https://t.co/g66qMpEkDQ
This is 100% true. But the calls today are not to "Reform the mission of our immigration enforcement agency." The calls are to "Abolish ICE." The buy-in required for reform is significant; the call for abolition makes that work much, much harder. https://t.co/qss6S5o7m1
The RBG renaissance has completely failed to account for the fact that her refusal to retire during the Obama administration (and instead bet on a Dem win in 2016) has put the very values she seeks to uphold in jeopardy. Not a popular opinion but some #realtalk https://t.co/Tm3VxDjXOz
@ericpalmsprings Yes: ICE was INS. But US immigration laws were being enforced. ICE as an agency could be restructured (and renamed) but functionally it is always going to exist.
Also: ICE is not going to be abolished. There is no world in which the US government will put an end to enforcing immigration and customs law. [The end].
But I did focus on the "very smart" part, Waj!!!!!! https://t.co/oB472feRyp
@GPollowitz That suit was over unaccompanied minors (not tender-age children forcibly separated from their parents) entitled to legal representation. The Obama administration never supported the idea of a) forcible separations b) tender age children facing deportation trials on their own.
@GPollowitz I didn't leave out anything: you're conflating witness testimony with administration policy. That is false and misleading. The WH did not stand by the judge's assertions and--in fact--went to some length to disavow the concept. Read the article. Know your facts.
Comments like the one below are patently false. The DOJ's position under Obama: "At no time has the Department indicated that 3 and 4 year olds are capable of representing themselves." That position has changed under President Trump. https://t.co/pnF6uNbvRA https://t.co/W6buBOVIpI
@GPollowitz Your comment is entirely misleading. Toddlers never represented themselves in court in the Obama era. One judge made the case for that — it was never administration policy and it was never enacted.
Toddlers are being ordered into court for their own deportation proceedings. "The expectation that children can mount a legal defense is 'unconscionable.'" https://t.co/UqYftSVdaX

This is Trump's legacy: from Supreme Court decisions (see: today's decision on the Ohio voter purge) to federal appellate courts ruling on key voting rights issues (see: North Carolina), this is how you reshape the country. Trump has 139 open judicial seats to fill.
SCOTUS upholds Ohio voter purge. Context: "In 2015, hundreds of thousands of infrequent voters were purged from Ohio's voter rolls, incl. over 40,600 registrants in Cuyahoga County, many of whom reside in low-income communities &amp; communities of color."  https://t.co/0ZGIhtUcZf

Clinton: "I'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain Trump's affection for tyrants."
"There's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal." There is a distinctly joyful devilishness in this speech.
Clinton can just rattle off Trump quotes and that's basically enough to get the audience roaring/terrified.
Clinton is clearly channeling her inner Kate McKinnon in this foreign policy speech.
Clinton on Trump foreign policy: "They're not even really ideas... There just a series of bizarre rants."
Correction: FBI officer who interrogated Gitmo detainees is calling waterboarding a national shame (but Trump would like to bring it back).
So now the CIA officers who waterboarded GITMO detainees are calling the practice a national shame, but Trump is still saying "it works."

Trump is turning Cruz's corny New York Values line into a repudiation of 9-11 Responders. YOWCH.

Christie says he will "Kick Obama's rear end outta the White House." Which I guess is his version of "allow him a term-limited exit."

Christie doing an effective job of shedding his image of "loudmouthed bully" by calling our President a "feckless weakling."

Interesting that Fiorina thinks McChrystal and Petraeus were forced out because they "told Obama things he didn't want to hear."
I would trade John Kasich for Lindsey Graham on this debate stage.
Observation: The GOP debate is presently focused on "closing the internet." I believe Hillary Clinton is #winning right now.
Weird that Bush has decided to spend his time on Trump instead of trying to get in the mainstage battle between Cruz and Rubio.
"Political correctness" being synonymous with oh, I dunno, "constitutionality."
Trump will build a beautiful, great wall between ISIS' internet and our internet.
The constant invocation of "PC culture" says everything about the culture war that's at the foundation of the Republican platform.

To be honest, "a caliphate the size of Indiana" doesn't sound all that big to me?
Wait: Ben Carson thinks Putin is going to use the mideast as his base?
If you were wondering whether the hawks still run the GOP, the debate between Rubio and Paul should answer that question. (Yes.)
Ted Cruz lists the 5 Government Agencies he would close &amp; counts the Dept of Commerce twice. Does this count as a Rick Perry Oops Moment?
Republican candidates are now measuring the word count of our laws against the word count of the Bible.
Contrary to Carly Fiorina's theory, I was under the impression that the Secret Sauce of America involved mayonnaise and ketchup.

Everyone should be able to reward themselves with a long toke of Jeb Bush's 40 year-old pot when this debate finally ends.
Not birthright citizenship, but the right not to "bunch up" one's vaccinations.
Now we know that Donald Trump does not like "horse pump" vaccines.
So the consensus seems to be :"We're not debating whether climate change is real...we're debating whether we want to do anything about it"
Pot is the tiny, sanctioned corner of the universe where Republicans go out of their way to demonstrate how progressive they are.
@jheil I'm going to get into the portable fan business.
Lots of discussion about Ted Cruz's support of John Roberts Supreme Court nomination in 2005 but not a single question on.... climate change
Of all the things you can blame Bush for, not listening to Dr. Ben Carson's foreign policy advice in 2003 is not one of them.
@JeffreyGoldberg squeegee, more like it.
Thank god we're debating the "lameness" of the minimum wage.
"Seal the borders"...like a Ziploc bag, right? Seems like it should be fairly easy.
Letting Trump dominate the immigration portion of the debate is cyanide for the GOP in the national race.
There is something nearly marital in the strife between Trump and Bush.
CNN pit crew: cold washcloths for the debaters at THE VERY NEXT COMMERCIAL BREAK please.
Ted Cruz is  talking to the cameras. Everyone else is talking to the people in the room. 'Nuff said.
Trump shouting down people in his own party, then going on about how well he will get along "with everybody" seems...improbable.
Ben Carson's voice or white noise machine? I'm not sure which affords a better night's sleep.
Jeb Bush saying "You wanted it. Yes you did" is all you need to know about his murderboard debate prep.
