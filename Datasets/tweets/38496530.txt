“It is a way of denying one's will to please your counterpart, although sometimes the will is only denied because of the custom and not just to please the counterpart.”		If you’re an Iranian-American, you should just print out this article to take to your therapist.
@hankstuever Yes!! You know, one of the rules is if someone compliments an object you have, you have to give it to them (my mom had to hand over a pair of her shoes once).
“It is possible to ask someone not to taarof (‘taarof nakonid’), but that raises new difficulties, since the request itself might be a devious type of taarof.” 		😂😂😂“a devious type of taarof” 		Like you thought there was an exit strategy but NOPE
“Taarof more often works in a totally opposite way. For example, an absolutely desired object/person/offer may seemingly be refused while deep inside is demanded and wished.”  *whispers: and then that way of thinking seeps into your being and directs your posture toward life*
“one example of taarof could be described as posing false invitations and promising future services or deeds to primarily strangers or distant relatives and expecting them not to take the offer and keep declining it.“

@SonnyBunch The thing that struck me about the SNL scene was that it felt like being in the space, rather than what it's like watching on TV. And sort of from Jackson's perspective. She is stilted, though.

We would get thankful calls, emails and letters. We'd also get nasty calls, emails and letters. And our readers weren't anonymous. We'd have to face them, every day.
My colleagues and I spent our weeknights at city and county council hearings. We wouldn't back down from officials who wanted us to keep stories about corruption out of the newspaper. We took our jobs seriously, worked long hours and got paid little (I made more as a waitress)
A lot of us at big media outlets started out in community journalism. During my first few years as a fulltime reporter, I profiled middle school students, wrote about town budget cuts and zoning decisions, interviewed parents whose children were killed by gang violence.

it is true that some audiences are super tight and won't even listen to or consider a joke if it's dealing with fraught matter.
oh and "it's just a joke" implies that you had to clarify that your material, was in fact, comedy. maybe it just wasn't funny!
and the laziest response ever is "it's just a joke." you can, as a comedian, either choose to ignore, engage with your audience or interrogate your own material. and just know that the audience has a right to hate something just as much as you have the right to say it.
and they most certainly never behave abrasively
oh that's just because, as we all know, men consistently and always are perfectly well-adjusted and have no negative personality traits whatsoever https://t.co/ERhYTfZ4J8
there have always been people offended by certain jokes. it's not that those jokes *weren't* offensive to people before. it's just now the offended are able to be heard.
