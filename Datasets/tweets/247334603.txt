I’m deeply troubled by reports of Saudi Arabia torturing an American citizen. He and other political prisoners must be released. This is despicable in aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
Convicted felons are prohibited from buying guns, but there are gaps in the records that must be closed. I'm asking the FBI to conduct a review to ensure records of felony &amp; domestic violence misdemeanor convictions are being appropriately shared across FBI databases. https://t.co/JZh77fRPF4

Credit and debit card swipe fees cost U.S. businesses and their customers $90 billion/year. This is unsustainable. Yet the WSJ reported that  @Visa and @MasterCard are looking to raise swipe fees in the U.S. and lower them in Europe. How is that fair? 	https://t.co/r1cGkQmUMP https://t.co/wIW2P2XKUZ
I was glad to talk about REFUND Act this morning at @RushMedical. Nearly $3B is spent each year on cancer meds that end up in the trash, due to Pharma producing excessively large drug vials. My bill with @SenPortman reduces this colossal waste and lowers costs for patients. https://t.co/m1fi2ICYEw
In a letter today with @SenKevinCramer, @SenBillCassidy, and @SenTinaSmith - we urge the @US_FDA to revise its generics &amp; biosimilar policy to speed up approval of new, lower-cost insulin products. https://t.co/1y5XJSWhNL
The price of insulin is unacceptable. People shouldn't be rationing this life-saving medicine, or starting Go Fund Me's, for a drug that was discovered nearly a century ago. I'm fighting to lower costs for patients.
Students who were hung out to dry by deadbeat for-profit schools, with mountains of loan debt, should be allowed to hold these schools accountable in court. I've intro'd the CLASS Act w/ @RepMaxineWaters. It ends mandatory arbitration in for-profit college enrollment agreements.

The Senate just passed a resolution honoring the victims and thanking the first responders from the Aurora mass shooting. Our hearts remain with the victims, their family and friends, and the Aurora community during this difficult time.
It is within our power to help keep innocent men, women, and children out of harm’s way by granting Venezuelans already in the U.S. TPS. Let’s pass the Venezuela Temporary Protected Status Act of 2019.
Venezuela is in the throes of a crisis, and if we are truly committed to helping their people, the very least we can do is ensure that Venezuelans in the United States are not forced to put their lives at risk by returning to such dangerous conditions.
When it comes to seniors in support living facilities, many of whom are facing illness, disability, mental illness, and the like, I hope USDA won’t treat them as they’re somehow cheating their government. They depend on SNAP as a lifeline. https://t.co/TJVs69x62F

The Pharma Fleecing of Insulin must end. We should reward innovation, not greed &amp; create truly competitive free market for drugs. Pharma must be held accountable for their greed &amp; abusive practices. #PharmaFleece
This starts w Pharma’s war on patients w Diabetes. Insulin is one of the most common life-or-death products, 7.5M Americans rely on to survive. Yet in the U.S., diabetics pay 7x more than other countries for the same insulin. How is this possible in the richest country on Earth? https://t.co/gZMI6HaFx0
For too long, Big Pharma has abused the drug market &amp; their government-granted monopolies for prescription drugs that millions of Americans depend on. #PharmaFleece
Today, I started new series of floor speeches called “Pharma Fleece Award” to shine light on the outrageous greed of Big Pharma. Drug companies continue to fleece Americans with the skyrocketing cost of Rx drugs, despite selling the same drugs for much less overseas #PharmaFleece

The House just sent a clear and bipartisan message to President Trump. His national emergency is legally dubious and a blatant power grab from Congress. The Senate should follow suit and pass this resolution. https://t.co/wsyWbUwGxt
Mr. Miller’s nomination is also opposed by a broad array of civil rights, environmental, labor, and other organizations who are concerned about his record and his legal views.
The 9th Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally recognized tribal nations. It hears more cases involving tribal issues than any other circuit. It is deeply troubling to see a 9th Circuit nominee like Mr. Miller whose impartiality on tribal legal matters is in question.
It is rare for the National Congress of American Indians to weigh in against a judicial nominee. But NCAI strongly opposes the Miller nomination. Here’s what they wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee: https://t.co/iCuhj0cPGy
WA's senators oppose his nomination, and for good reason. Mr. Miller is only 43 years old. But in his relatively short legal career he has demonstrated that his views are far outside of the legal mainstream, particularly when it comes to legal issues involving Indian tribes.
The Senate is currently voting on 9th Circuit nominee Eric Miller. If confirmed, he'd be first judicial nominee confirmed with no blue slips - i.e., no approval from either home state Senator. Republicans would remove yet another guardrail in the Senate advice &amp; consent process.
I have introduced the REFUND Act w/ @senrobportman to stop drug companies who insist on these wasteful practices, especially when they sell smaller vials overseas. The #REFUNDAct will help recoup money for wasted medications and lower Rx drug costs for patients.
For too long, Pharma has sold their medications in excessively large packages that contain more medicine than the average patient needs. American patients and taxpayers end up paying nearly $3 billion each year on drugs that are being tossed in the trash. #REFUNDAct

This boils down to whether you believe health care is a privilege for the wealthy and healthy few, or a right for everyone. I believe it's a right for all Americans.
By giving more Americans the choice to participate in Medicare, while simultaneously protecting the program for today’s seniors, this bill represents an important next step toward our shared goal of health care for all.
Introduced the Medicare at 50 Act with @SenDuckworth today. It would give people between the ages of 50 and 64 years old the option of buying into Medicare.

That has to change - and it's why I'm joining my colleagues on a bill that would restore it.
A provision that helped IL families save money - the state and local tax (SALT) deduction - was capped by the Republican bill, subjecting families across the state to burdensome double-taxation &amp; hurting local communities’ ability to raise revenue for essential public services.
Illinoisans are now realizing that not only are they not receiving the $4,000 raise that was promised to them by the President and Republicans, but they could owe more on their taxes this year because of the Republican tax law.
The #FAMILYAct means more mothers, fathers, and American workers will have the opportunity to care and provide for themselves and their families while keeping their jobs. It’s time to make #PaidLeave more accessible to everyday Americans.
In Illinois, even unpaid leave under current federal law is inaccessible for 60% of working people. This means Illinoisans are continuously faced with tough choices when starting families and dealing with personal and family health issues. #FAMILYAct

Tune in to @CNN @AC360 tonight at 8pm ET / 7pm CT to catch my conversation with Anderson about last night’s #SOTU address, the ongoing bipartisan negotiations to fund DHS before the Feb. 15 deadline, and tomorrow’s Judiciary Committee vote on Pres. Trump’s AG nominee.
Great to see so many members of @STLRegChamber today. I enjoyed our discussion on a wide range of issues from the need for comprehensive immigration reform to infrastructure improvements in the St. Louis region and across Illinois. https://t.co/pl0VI65D0v
Ahead of tomorrow’s Judiciary Committee vote, I met with President Trump’s Attorney General nominee, William Barr. My full statement below. https://t.co/98v6UXiVNv
Rural Americans face unique health challenges that we must address. Since 2010, 95 hospitals nationwide serving rural areas have closed. Today I met w IL Critical Access Hospital Network to discuss solutions to bring more doctors &amp; nurses to rural IL &amp; ensure sustainable funds. https://t.co/R0AIE69lYZ
It's time to put the lives and health of patients first and make life-saving Rx drugs more affordable for working class families across the country. #FLATPricesAct
Today, I introduced the FLAT Prices Act to stop the abusive pharma companies that dramatically increase prescription drug prices. My bill will target these companies by shortening FDA monopoly periods to bring lower-cost generics to the drug market sooner. https://t.co/1K0uMxCkcZ
For too long, Big Pharma has been protected from competition by govt-granted monopolies—enabling them to price-gouge patients with ever-higher costs for drugs, like insulin.
I also made clear that Congress will remember those within the outgoing regime who played a constructive role in a peaceful transition when considering future targeted American sanctions.
Welcomed top Venezuelan diplomat to U.S., @carlosvecchio, to discuss ongoing Venezuelan government transition under Juan Guaidó.

Joe Ricketts may have made a fortune but his emails show he is penniless when it comes to tolerance. 		The @Cubs have a challenge and an opportunity to turn this embarrassing moment into a clear commitment to the diversity of their fan base and the nation we call home.
When this President says his Administration is unlike anything in the history of this country, there is no argument that he’s right. #SOTU
And America’s confidence in our government is at risk because we’ve been shaken by this President and his Cabinet riddled with corruption and conflicts of interest.  #SOTU
Our economy is at risk because President Trump’s tax scam left the middle class behind. #SOTU
Our planet is at risk because this President and his party have broken with every nation on Earth in their opposition to responsibly address #climatechange. #SOTU
Our national security is at risk because of threats to #NATO, a return to an arms race, and a phony caravan crisis at our southern border all brought on by this President. #SOTU
The basic services of our government are at risk because of President Trump’s 35-day shutdown and threat to do it again next week. #SOTU
What is the state of the union under President Trump? Affordable health insurance — including for people with pre-existing conditions — is at risk because of a lawsuit filed by Republican Attorneys General and supported by this President and his Administration. #SOTU

As an academic and Trump Administration official, Ms. Rao has advocated for extreme views of Presidential power and has staunchly opposed regulations to protect Americans’ health, safety, and environment.
Ms. Rao also has very limited experience practicing law. She has never tried a case or argued an appeal, and she reported that she has only worked on three litigation matters in her entire career.
Ms. Rao wrote that “Myths of sexual and racial oppression propagate themselves, create hysteria, and finally lead to the formation of some whining new group.” She has a troubling history of expressing cringeworthy views on race, gender, sexual assault, and LGBTQ issues.
Neomi Rao, President Trump’s nominee to serve on the D.C. Circuit, gave testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee today. I asked her to explain her past writings where she discussed “myths of racial and gender oppression.” https://t.co/L5OUoEfqUw

Toby and his wife, a neonatal nurse, are looking after their two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter during the ten-month deployment. I told his story on the Senate floor during the government shutdown: https://t.co/DMpaP4cv54
Toby is an Air Force veteran &amp; air traffic controller in Aurora. His father &amp; grandfather served in the military &amp; now his son and daughter-in-law are deployed overseas.
President Trump’s shutdown was a kick in the gut to Toby Hauck &amp; all air traffic controllers.

On 1st day of #BlackHistoryMonth, @SenDuckworth &amp; I are announcing a bill that would designate the 1908 Race Riot Sites in Springfield as a National Monument. It would help future generations learn from our past &amp; renew our commitment to fighting prejudice &amp; promoting equality.

There are several Continuing Resolution options available to reopen the government. I hope my Republican colleagues will join our call to open the government as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, not enough of my Republican colleagues joined this bipartisan effort, so the government will remain closed for now and federal employees will risk missing yet another paycheck.
There is no reason why essential federal employees should continue to suffer while politicians in Washington bargain a compromise on border security. That is why I voted to reopen the government for two weeks while we continue to debate smart and effective border security.
This isn’t a compromise. I have always backed smart measures to secure our border, but this is an anti-immigrant wish-list that I can’t support.
Makes it much harder for anyone fleeing persecution to claim asylum.
Makes it much more difficult to receive TPS in the future, and guts protections for Central American children seeking safe haven in our country.
Excludes hundreds of thousands of DACA-eligible individuals and all TPS recipients from the African countries the President disparaged. Includes sweeping new restrictions that would bar many current DACA recipients.

Mr. President, your proposed "fix" leaves thousands of the victims of your DACA abolition unprotected. No honest solution will leave these forgotten young people behind.

America can have border security without bullying and we can be safe without treating toddlers as terrorists. DHS Secretary Nielsen should accept responsibility for this outrage and resign.
No one has been held accountable for this humanitarian disaster at our Southern border. Instead President Trump continues to push anti-immigrant policies making it easier to detain and deport children as a condition for reopening the government.
It’s inconceivable that our government chose to secretly separate thousands of children from their parents, was unable or unwilling to reunite these families for months due to incompetent leadership and poor planning, and still doesn’t know how many children were separated.
The Trump Administration’s family separation policy is more than a bureaucratic lapse in judgment. It is and was a cruel policy inconsistent with the values of this nation. https://t.co/32rd6g0QxU
Today’s bombshell report reveals the true scope of this horrific policy: thousands of children were forcibly removed from their parents before the policy was made public and the fate of these children is still unknown. https://t.co/WMBzyVczfM
Joining @CNNnewsroom at 10am ET / 9am CT to discuss this week's Attorney General nomination hearing, and the ongoing #TrumpShutdown. Tune in.
It’s time for President Trump to wake up and recognize that his shutdown is hurting people from all walks of life, including hardworking veterans like Toby. They don’t deserve to be punished for a campaign promise.
Here’s what Toby had to say about the #TrumpShutdown: “It's not acceptable as a veteran, as a federal employee, as an air traffic controller to use my profession and my livelihood as a political football.” I agree.
Veterans are some of the hardest hit by the Trump shutdown. Today, as many as 250,000 veterans across the country – direct hire federal workers and contractors alike – are going without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown.
Toby, a 6-year Air Force veteran from Aurora, is an air traffic controller who has gone without a paycheck since Dec. 31. I shared his story today on the Senate floor. https://t.co/avsTd92kRF
Yesterday, I sat down with CBP Commissioner McAleenan. Customs officers at legal ports of entry seize the vast majority of lethal narcotics coming into our country. We need more screening technology, not a wall, to stop the flow of drugs through our border. https://t.co/59BdJzLPdR
As the #TrumpShutdown continues, its impact on climate science is taking a toll. Researchers can’t finish reports on critical data that helps the world understand the effects of climate change each year. https://t.co/Ii16sEDmQQ
Stood with @SenateDems today to tell President Trump enough is enough – end this hurtful and unnecessary shutdown. https://t.co/vvUNulNKKe
My message to Senator McConnell: reopen the government while we continue to negotiate border security. You do not need a permission slip from President Trump to do your job. It’s time for the Senate to act.
All of this pain that President Trump is causing is over a campaign promise. We can have a debate about effective border security, but we shouldn’t do it while holding the rest of the federal government hostage.
President Trump continues to hold the hard-earned paychecks of Americans around the country hostage in a desperate attempt to fulfill an unrealistic campaign promise that the majority of Americans oppose.
Americans deserve the right to affordable and quality health care. Congress must act now to defend the #ACA and protect American’s health care. I will continue to call on Republican leadership to bring this resolution up for a vote on the Senate floor.
Once again, the #ACA is under attack by the Republican party. The TX court ruling completely undermines protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

As of today, the President's pursuit of a medieval wall has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to miss a payday. He's holding their paychecks hostage to fulfill a shortsighted campaign promise. It is cruel.
No, Mr. President. According to your own Admin, the majority of drugs are smuggled into U.S. through legal ports of entry. A wall would do nothing to stop that. More screening technology at ports of entry would. We can save lives, but not with an ineffective wall. https://t.co/YonVxymEAU
The Senate doesn't have to wait for a permission slip to exercise our constitutional authority. The votes to pass a bill that reopens govt, I believe, are on the floor of the Senate today and that is what has led Senator McConnell to the conclusion that he won’t call the bill.

Mr. President, you may have never lived paycheck to paycheck, but many workers do. Stop picking on these federal employees.
Unfortunately, President Trump has decided to stop paying hundreds of thousands of federal law enforcement personnel and researchers to pressure Congress for his wall.
Democrats support strong border security. And we can have a debate about effective border security, but we shouldn’t do it while holding the federal government hostage.
Tonight, what we heard from the Oval Office was a desperate attempt by the President to gain support for his medieval border wall. It won’t work.

This is just one example of the smart and effective border security that Democrats support and would gladly fund to help keep Americans safe.
CBP Commissioner McAleenan said it would cost $300 million per year to inspect all arrival cargo, passenger vehicles, and sea containers. That’s a far cry from $5 billion or more per year for a border wall.
According to DHS, these drive-through inspection systems examine 98% of rail cars but only 18% of cargo, passenger vehicles, and sea containers combined. Yet the President’s FY 2019 Budget request included just $44 million for these systems.
CBP Commissioner McAleenan told me in October 2017 that his top priority to secure the border was more drive-through inspection systems at ports of entry. He didn’t mention a border wall.

Getting ready to speak with @MSNBC @Morning_Joe about yesterday’s meeting at the White House on border security and the latest on the government shutdown. Tune in.
The President failed to give us even one reason why the eight Cabinet departments and dozens of smaller agencies in the 6 bills, which are separate and apart from border security, should remain closed.
Today, we urged the President and Republican leaders to pass the 6 other appropriations bills, which would reopen most of the government, along with a short-term bill to keep DHS funded and working while we continue to debate the path forward on border security.
But here’s what we should all agree on: large portions of the government shouldn’t be shut down while there’s a debate on border security.
Let me be clear: Dems support strong, effective border security. The type of border security that Dems have long-supported, including increased funds for tech, is what experts have said is needed &amp; actually works. What doesn’t work is an ineffective, expensive &amp; medieval wall.

Just went through TSA at STL Lambert. These professionals continue to do their job, without pay, in good spirits with many passengers thanking them. How can anyone be “proud” of a shutdown that hurts so many innocent people?
President Trump has taken hundreds of thousands of federal employees' pay hostage in a last ditch effort to fulfill a campaign promise. Building a wall from sea to shining sea won't make us safer or stop drugs from coming into our country.

If President Trump chooses to shut the government down – hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed and without pay during the holidays. People who protect our border would be forced to work without pay.
Instead President Trump is threatening to shut down the government if he doesn’t get nearly $6 billion for a wasteful &amp; ineffective border wall. We need modern technology to stop drug cartels from importing the poison that is killing our kids, not a medieval solution like a wall.
And the Administration didn’t ask for any funding for additional Customs Officers, even though we clearly need more personnel to detect drugs at ports of entry and in international mail.
According to DHS, these drive-through inspection systems examine 98% of rail cars but only 18% of cargo, passenger vehicles, and sea containers combined. Yet the President’s Budget for FY19 includes just $44 million for these systems.
CBP Commissioner McAleenan told me directly in October 2017 that his top priority to secure the border was more drive-through inspection systems, known as Z-portals. He didn’t mention a border wall.
For example, the DEA has found that the cartels transport the bulk of their illicit goods over the Southwest border through legal ports of entry using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.
Democrats have made it clear to the President that there are much more effective ways to secure our border than a wall – like more screening technology and personnel to stop drugs from flowing through our borders. Democrats support smart border security that works.

Their leadership has helped states pass more gun safety laws, and is making this country a safer place. I hope we will see that kind of courage in the halls of Congress soon.
Over the past year, as more cities, towns, places of worship, and schools faced the scourge of gun violence, we’ve seen parents, students, and community members speak out to say enough is enough.
Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. We can help prevent these tragedies if Members of Congress have the courage to pass common sense gun reform laws that can help keep our communities safe.
Today, we remember the 20 children and 6 staff members that were shot and killed at #SandyHook 6 years ago. Gun violence has taken far too many of our loved ones - young and old - far too soon.
Websites, apps, and other online providers should be required to protect their users’ personal data. This bill is a sensible step in protecting consumers’ sensitive information and I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing it.
In today’s era of ‘big data,’ Americans are using the internet every day without fully understanding the consequences of every click and whether that click just handed over their personal data for unwanted uses. This is simply unacceptable.

Farr told the Judiciary Committee he didn't participate in any campaign meetings in which this mailing was discussed before it was sent. News reports then indicated Farr did participate in an Oct 1990 meeting that included discussion about challenging voters’ residency.
The Helms campaign sent over 100,000 postcards to mostly African American voters warning that they might be ineligible to vote for residency reasons. The postcards warned that the recipients might be arrested for voter fraud if they came to the polls.
The 1990 campaign for Jesse Helms in North Carolina engaged in deeply disturbing tactics aimed at suppressing the vote. Who was Helms’ legal counsel? Thomas Farr – now seeking Senate confirmation to be a federal judge in NC.
The cruelty of this ill-conceived, heartless, and poorly implemented child separation policy seems to be never-ending. The Republicans who control Congress have failed to conduct the most basic oversight to prevent these abuses and hold this Administration accountable. https://t.co/ALpoxKortk

The comprehensive #cjreform bill is the best chance in a generation to make meaningful changes in our federal drug sentencing laws. We can’t waste this opportunity to help thousands of people have a second chance at life, and even the scales of justice.
And the large majority of those subject to federal mandatory minimum penalties are African-American and Latino. The Senate now has a unique opportunity to reform these outdated and unfair policies.
We also have to consider the racially disparate impact of these unfair laws. The majority of illegal drug users &amp; dealers in our country are white, but 3/4s of all people incarcerated for drug offenses are African American or Latino.
The largest increase in the federal prison population is nonviolent drug offenders, and this is because of inflexible mandatory minimum sentences. These mandatory penalties don’t allow judges to distinguish between drug kingpins—who should be our focus—and lower-level offenders.
Today, America holds more prisoners, by far, than any other country in the world. Our overcrowded federal prisons consume one quarter of DOJ's discretionary budget. This undermines other important priorities, like preventing crime and treating drug addiction.

.@LisaMurkowski and I introduced a bipartisan bill to crack down on e-cigarette and cigar flavorings. I’m glad @US_FDA worked with us on the actions announced today.
These flavors are the key to their callous business strategy, and they have no business being sold on the market. The FDA’s actions today make clear that we won’t stand for manipulative marketing tactics, and that our children’s health and safety will always come first.
The bottom line is this: it’s ludicrous to think flavors like bubble gum, cotton candy, or tutti fruitti are meant for adults. E-cigarette companies want to hook another generation of Americans onto a deadly and addictive product so they have a customer for life.
E-cigarette use among children and teenagers is an epidemic, just ask our federal health agencies or any school teacher in America.  The FDA is finally moving in the right direction by cracking down on the sale of kid-friendly flavors in e-cigarettes and cigars. https://t.co/7GStnwT1G6

There’s more work to be done to hold Big Pharma accountable &amp; improve how we treat addiction, but I’m encouraged that this legislation includes my bills to limit the flood of opioid pills put onto the market, support children who experience trauma, &amp; expand drug treatment.

Saudi Crown Prince says, “more people more money" at an investor conference - mocking his critics in the Khashoggi murder scandal. The feeble response from the U.S. and President Trump proves his point. https://t.co/KVpSh3ZP5J
Blacklisting 21 Saudis is a weak response to Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder. The U.S. should expel the Saudi ambassador and call on our allies to do the same until a third party investigation is completed. No arms deal is worth our moral authority. https://t.co/v2GAYgLLvN

The only person on Earth outside of the Saudi kingdom who appears to accept the Saudi ‘investigation’ is President Trump. We should expel the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. until there is a completion of a third party investigation into the kidnap and murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

Nearly 5M Illinoisans– 40% of people in our state – receive Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, or tax credits from ACA to help buy health insurance. And yet, congressional Republicans &amp; Pres. Trump have made no secret of the fact that they want to cut these essential programs.
The last column from Jamal Khashoggi sends a powerful message to the Arab world. Mr. Khashoggi died for his cause, and the United States can’t forget its values &amp; cower to Saudi Arabia as they and others suppress free speech by the most atrocious of means. https://t.co/jQiaJveS0B

The challenges our environment faces have never been greater. Mr. Clark, who the @SierraClub described as an “outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protection,” is the wrong man to lead this critical division of the Justice Department. I oppose his nomination.
He called the science of climate change “contestable”, he represented BP in litigation over the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, and he represented industry groups in challenging EPA greenhouse gas regulations.
The Senate is currently considering the nomination of Jeffrey Clark to be the Assistant AG in charge of DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, which enforces federal environmental laws and regulations. Mr. Clark is the wrong person for the job.

The White House could have worked in a bipartisan way to pick consensus nominees. They didn’t. They are determined to stack the courts with nominees who have a record of ideological hostility to critical rights and protections.
The White House also nominated Eric Murphy, who is only 39 years old and has a lengthy record of litigating to restrict voting rights, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, and more, to the 6th Circuit.
Make no mistake: the Trump Administration wants to end the Affordable Care Act’s coverage for pre-existing conditions. The Readler nomination shows they really mean it.
The White House announced it would nominate Chad Readler to the 6th Circuit on the same day Readler filed a brief arguing that the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional.
Today Senate Republicans are “plowing right through” with two controversial circuit court nominees who have worked to restrict voting rights and strip health coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

Violence against children is tragic and preventable. It can take many forms: physical or sexual violence, emotional abuse or neglect, trafficking, child labor, and forcible family separation. It must be condemned and confronted everywhere.
The World Health Organization has estimated that globally, at least 1 billion children have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year.

This embarrassingly-low number betrays America’s values and relinquishes our leadership role in defending human rights. I urge the administration to reconsider and set a higher annual refugee admissions goal. America is better than this.
Since 1980, the U.S. had resettled an average of over 80,000 refugees per year until President Trump set the admission goal for 2018 at 45,000 and then failed to resettle even half that. This includes just 62 refugees from Syria – despite there being 5.6 million Syrian refugees.
Today I joined @JanSchakowsky and advocates at @SCN_Network to discuss the Trump administration’s shameful decision – in the midst of the worst refugee crisis in history – to slash refugee admission levels to a historic low of 30,000. https://t.co/nhMzhEc3Nz

He is sending a clear message to sexual assault survivors: if you have the courage to come forward, I will mock you and attack your credibility.

I'll be joining @chucktodd on #MTPDaily soon to discuss the latest with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Senate Republicans and the White House must let the FBI follow the facts where they lead and hold off on scheduling a vote until we learn what the FBI uncovers.
The Inspector General needs to get to the bottom of the Justice Department’s role in this disgraceful debacle, which led to thousands of children being separated from their parents, including at least 136 kids who have still not been reunited today.
I called for this investigation into DOJ’s role implementing this policy. Attorney General Sessions, who is well known for his anti-immigrant views, has been a leading champion of the so-called ‘zero-tolerance’ policy.
News: The DOJ's Inspector General is reviewing DOJ's implementation of the zero-tolerance policy. It is completely unacceptable that no one in the Trump Administration has been held accountable for the humanitarian crisis created by its family separation policy.

The faith of the American people in the integrity of the Supreme Court is hanging in the balance. Let’s do this the right way. Let’s allow the FBI to do a thorough, non-partisan investigation into the serious, pending allegations. No more interference, no more concealment.
With so much at stake, we should not confirm a nominee to the Court unless we are sure that the nominee’s credibility, integrity, independence, and judgment are beyond question.
It is hard to imagine how a nominee who has displayed such raw partisanship could then claim to serve as a neutral umpire on the Supreme Court.
He cited “apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election” and “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.” These partisan attacks were in no way responsive to Dr. Ford’s testimony. It was like he was appealing directly to President Trump.
I've never seen as partisan a statement by a federal judicial nominee as I saw from Judge Kavanaugh last week. He claimed that he bore “no ill will” towards Dr. Ford, then turned right around and called her allegations, “a calculated and orchestrated political hit.”
It has been hard to take Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony at his word, on matters both large and small. That matters a lot when we are evaluating a nominee’s judgment, temperament, and integrity.
Unfortunately, the apparent effort by the White House and Senate Republicans to tie the FBI’s hands in the Kavanaugh investigation is part of a pattern. It’s a pattern of concealment when it comes to the history and record of Brett Kavanaugh.
The White House and Senate Republicans must not interfere with the FBI’s ability to follow the facts and get to the truth. We need to let the career professionals at the FBI do their job without partisan political interference.
Senate Republicans must not “plow right through” the FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. This is too important. https://t.co/Dck93MFz8g
Weeks after it announced a mere 30,000 refugees would be welcomed to America this year, the Trump Administration finally consulted Congress about this radical change. President Trump has turned his back to the world’s most vulnerable and victimized.
Secretary Nielsen signed off on this family separation policy, falsely claimed that the policy did not exist, and then callously failed to address the policy’s tragic and inevitable fallout. In light of this devastating report, she should resign.
Thousands of children were separated from their parents, and months later, hundreds of families have still not been reunited due to a heartless mix of cruelty and incompetence.
Confirms that DHS was completely unprepared to implement the Trump Administration’s disastrous zero-tolerance policy. The humanitarian crisis that resulted was not only predictable, but apparently orchestrated. https://t.co/SeuHeUUJdj

Americans are speaking out against the Tump Administration’s efforts to weaken environmental protection laws, but the President won’t listen. He's putting special interests over the public health of communities nationwide. https://t.co/qpddEPBwsP
In April, I joined @SenBlumenthal and colleagues in raising concerns about Jones’ conflicts of interest in the ACICS case from her time working with them in the #4profit industry. Given her background, her decision on deadbeat ACICS is highly suspect, though not surprising.
ACICS – infamous for accrediting #4profit Corinthian, ITT Tech, Westwood – was complicit in the exploitation of tens of thousands of students and the loss of millions in taxpayer dollars.
Former for-profit college exec. and top DeVos Dept. of Ed. official Diane Jones, just gave new life to deadbeat #4profit accreditor, ACICS – allowing an additional year to come into compliance. It’s a betrayal of students and taxpayers.

These sexual assault allegations are serious and credible - they deserve respect and an FBI investigation. These three women bravely came forward, risked everything in doing so, and the response they get from the President of the United States is "big con job."	 	Shameful.
Today, @SenFeinstein, @PattyMurray &amp; I sent a clear message to DHS Secretary Nielsen &amp; HHS Secretary Azar: family detention is immoral, cruel &amp; harmful to the health of children &amp; parents.

No nominee is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court. It’s a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. The person who fills that seat can make decisions which swing history one way or the other. Decisions that affect justice, privacy &amp; fairness in everyone's life.
Despite all the calls for fairness over and over again by Senator McConnell, fairness would dictate that the FBI do an impartial investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and present their conclusions, whatever they may be.
“Plow right through.” That’s what Republican leaders want to do with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, even though serious and credible allegations of sexual misconduct have been brought forward. Republicans want to rush this vote through ASAP. https://t.co/2WQ2wYzZkt

Dr. Blasey Ford has been clear in her desire to testify following an independent, thorough investigation by the FBI. The fact that Senate Republicans seem determined to avoid that &amp; continue to push her into a rigged hearing before she is available is beyond the pale.

We’re dealing with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. If Republicans vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, Americans can’t vote him out. If confirmed, he will be deciding cases affecting our health, safety, and privacy for decades. Republicans are comfortable with that?
America is watching how the Senate handles Dr. Blasey Ford’s serious, credible allegations. This is not a typical partisan fight over process. This goes to fundamental questions about whether survivors of sexual assault will be treated with dignity and respect.
Senate Republicans have tried to rig the process against Dr. Blasey Ford – no neutral investigation, no other witnesses - and now they seem happy that she won’t commit to a partisan ambush.

The FBI’s career professionals should conduct an independent investigation before the Committee determines how to proceed on a bipartisan basis. My Republican colleagues are making a mistake if they plow ahead with a Committee vote this Thursday. They should reconsider.
Some Republicans want to handle Dr. Ford’s allegations with a conference call. That is not a fair or credible approach, especially given that she is willing to testify before the Committee.
In June, the Judiciary Committee held two hearings that discussed the challenges sexual assault survivors face in coming forward. #MeToo has shown that credible allegations often surface many years after the fact. We must respect &amp; listen to survivors, not attack &amp; bully them.
Republicans cannot simply dismiss Dr. Ford’s allegations with a conference call. These are serious and credible allegations. Thursday’s vote must be delayed.

Thinking about those lost due to Hurricane Florence and everyone who is still affected by the storm. Very thankful for the hard work of first responders who have braved the elements and danger to rescue those in need.
If the #MeToo movement has taught us anything, it is that we must respect and listen to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of the age of those involved or when the alleged attack took place.
Let me add - it is up to survivors of sexual assault alone to decide whether to come forward. It is completely unacceptable to attack anyone who alleges she has been assaulted.
Kavanaugh provided misleading or inaccurate answers to many questions. And Republicans are hiding documents for 35 months when he was a top advisor to President Bush and worked on controversial issues like abortion, torture, warrantless wiretapping, and banning same-sex marriage.
The American people deserve to know who Judge Kavanaugh is, but Republicans are trying to rush through this nomination while concealing critical parts of the nominee’s record. There are far too many questions swirling around this nomination. #WhatAreTheyHiding

This is a theme that we see emerge with Judge Kavanaugh time and time again – he says one thing under oath, and then the documents tell a different story. It is no wonder the White House and Senate Republicans are rushing through this nomination and hiding his record.
It is clear now that not only did Judge Kavanaugh mislead me when it came to his involvement in the Bush Administration’s detention and interrogation policies, but also regarding his role in the controversial Haynes nomination.
However, these emails from 2002 and 2003 show that then-Associate White House Counsel Brett Kavanaugh played a substantial role in the decision to nominate Haynes, including examining whether Haynes “would be an across-the-board judicial conservative”. https://t.co/Ri0EuREWYM
In 2006, I asked Judge Kavanaugh about his role in the 4th Circuit nomination of Jim Haynes – a key figure in crafting the Bush White House detention &amp; interrogation policies. Under oath, he said, "I’ve—I know Jim Haynes, but it was not one of the nominations that I handled.”
We continue to find more evidence that Judge Kavanaugh misled me and the Judiciary Committee under oath. I’m posting important documents that Senate Republicans didn’t want the American people to see. We deserve transparency about this nominee.

Finally, Judge Kavanaugh has been chosen by a President who shows contempt for the rule of law. And Kavanaugh has said that Presidents can ignore certain laws and that sitting presidents should not face criminal investigations. Never has a SCOTUS nomination had so much at stake. https://t.co/5uPIVpFsjy
I showed Judge Kavanaugh his 2006 testimony, where he unambiguously said he had no involvement in these questions. But we now know, from the limited records we have, that he was involved in at least 3 ways. His claim that he told the “whole truth” in 2006 is simply not credible.
Then, on two separate occasions, Judge Kavanaugh denied misleading the Committee in 2006 when he told me under oath, “I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants” while at the Bush White House.
I asked Judge Kavanaugh about dissents he wrote on women’s rights, labor rights, and gun safety laws. His writings and his answers were troubling. He has shown he will go out of his way to ignore clear precedent in order to seek outcomes that fit his ideology.
There is a cloud over this nomination given the lack of transparency around Judge Kavanaugh’s public-service record. But we did learn at least a few things from Judge Kavanaugh this week.
However, an unprecedented amount of Judge Kavanaugh’s record is being concealed &amp; he refused to delay his hearing in the name of transparency so his full White House record could be released. The Senate is being denied information that we need to evaluate his views &amp; credibility.
Instead, Judge Kavanaugh wants us to trust his word that he would be an independent justice who would approach cases with an open mind and no agenda. As President Reagan used to say, trust but verify.
In my opening statement at Judge Kavanaugh’s hearing, I predicted that he wouldn’t tell the Judiciary Committee much. I was right. He refused to discuss his views on many critical issues facing our country in this perilous moment.
Like my mentor Paul Douglas, Barack Obama held himself and all around him to the highest ethical standards. Eight years in the White House and not one scandal, not one indictment, not one whiff of impropriety. Isn’t that what America deserves?

This ruling highlights that if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh will undoubtedly erode women’s constitutional rights.
Instead of respecting her decision and acknowledging the hoops that she had jumped through, Judge Kavanaugh called it an “abortion-on-demand” and would have allowed the government to further delay her ability to access an abortion.
Yesterday I asked Judge Kavanaugh about his dissent in Garza v. Hargan. This case involved a 17-year-old young woman who sought an abortion in Texas while in immigration custody. She took every step required by law to move forward with her decision.
This would be a tragic comedy if it weren’t for the fact that we are talking about the highest level of government in our nation that makes life and death decisions. https://t.co/u5JzXBt9Xg
His dissent ignored the clear definition of the word “employee” in the National Labor Relations Act. Every other adjudicator who considered the issue – including conservative Republican appointees - ruled for the workers.

In 2006, Judge Kavanaugh told me under oath “I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.”

All day long, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee argued against transparency when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh’s record. The American people deserve better. If Rs are proud of this nominee’s record, they should let the American people see it.  #WhatAreTheyHiding
This partisan Republican process will keep millions of pages of records from critical periods of Judge Kavanaugh’s career hidden from the American public.
Under Mr. Burck’s process, the Senate and the American people are left in the dark. And of the documents he has given to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Burck is trying to keep many of them hidden from the American people by claiming they should be kept “committee confidential.”
Mr. Burck is picking and choosing documents to share with the Judiciary Committee. He is not producing a privilege log – a record of what documents are being withheld – so we do not know what he is choosing to hide and why.
Who is Mr. Burck? He’s a Republican attorney who represents both President Bush and White House Counsel Don McGahn. He actually used to work for Brett Kavanaugh as his Deputy Staff Secretary.
So far, the only documents we’ve seen from Judge Kavanaugh’s White House Counsel record are documents that were handpicked and cleared by Bill Burck. Burck is also hiding one hundred thousand documents citing “executive privilege." https://t.co/Yd2mxXhBFl

What is in these documents that Judge Kavanaugh does not want America to see?
Time and again, he would not rule out that there are documents about his work on these issues. The American people need to see these documents before the Senate considers his nomination.
Judge Kavanaugh today acknowledged that he was involved in many of these issues, including same-sex marriage, abortion, executive power, detainees, torture, Supreme Court nominations, warrantless wiretapping, and more.
The Administration and Senate Republicans have refused to disclose any documents from the 35 months that Judge Kavanaugh spent as Staff Secretary in the White House, a time when many controversial issues of constitutional importance were debated and decided. https://t.co/80tx8kbqqr

That is why I joined @SenatorLeahy &amp; @SenFeinstein to press the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman to request the public release of all documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the White House, which he called the most “formative” preparation he had for becoming a judge.
Even in the small percentage of docs made available to the Judiciary Comm thru the partisan process led by Kavanaugh's former deputy, we have found info raising serious concerns regarding Judge Kavanaugh’s ’06 noms hearing, where we believe he misled the Senate #ReleasetheRecords https://t.co/WHJHR7wjwe
This is the action of a President consumed by fear and determined to undermine free speech, the rule of law, and our Constitution. When will the Republicans take a stand against these outrages?
Revoking John Brennan’s security clearance is a transparent attempt to silence a critic and to intimidate others who might question the President's conduct.
But Republicans won’t disclose any of Kavanaugh’s Staff Secretary documents. They want to keep the American people in the dark about this 3-year period in Kavanaugh’s career where he worked on highly controversial issues. This is a Supreme Court nominee we are talking about.
If there are Staff Secretary docs showing Kavanaugh’s involvement in “questions about the rules governing detention of combatants," those docs are directly relevant to the credibility of his sworn testimony in 2006.  That’s why it’s so important to see them. #WhatAreTheyHiding
Take note: Republicans are trying to ignore the plain words of what Judge Kavanaugh said under oath in 2006: “I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.” This statement covers his time as WH Staff Secretary.
There is a growing recognition that we need to take a serious look at how many of these pills are allowed to flood our markets &amp; streets. We cannot continue to lose 115 Americans each day - more than 42,000 a year - to opioid overdoses. Prevention is critical.
That's why I intro'd bill w Sens. Kennedy @ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein that enhances DEA’s existing opioid quota-setting authority by improving transparency &amp; enabling DEA to adjust quotas to prevent opioid diversion &amp; abuse while ensuring adequate supply for legit medical needs.
But our work is not done. Reform of opioid quota laws is needed so DEA can take important factors like diversion &amp; abuse into account when setting quotas, rather than chasing the downstream consequences of this crisis.

I’ve shared over 100 Dreamer stories on the Senate floor. Despite the contributions #Dreamers are making in our communities, Pres Trump heartlessly ended the #DACA program last year. He broke his promise to them &amp; uses Dreamers as a bargaining chip for an anti-immigrant agenda.

And who is Bill Burck, the lawyer Republicans have tasked with screening Judge Kavanaugh’s documents for release? He’s Judge Kavanaugh’s former White House deputy and he represents George W. Bush, Don McGahn, and Steve Bannon. Not objective.
The Bill Burck document production is a partisan effort to flood the Judiciary Committee with largely irrelevant documents, like news clippings and mass emails, while withholding controversial documents from Kavanaugh’s record. It’s not credible.
Because the National Archives won’t be able to complete its production of Judge Kavanaugh’s White House documents by October, Senate Republicans are getting ready to argue that the partisan Bill Burck document production is good enough to use for a September hearing. It’s not.
Take note: Unless it was produced by the National Archives, every document you see from Judge Kavanaugh’s White House tenure was selectively chosen for release by his former deputy, Bill Burck. This is not an objective process. https://t.co/FSDlOT9jJ5

Trump Admin officials told us this week that giving them the authority to indefinitely detain parents &amp; kids together would help solve the crisis at the border they created. Locking up children in detention facilities isn’t a solution, it’s just more cruelty by this White House.
The zero-tolerance immigration policy has been an unmitigated disaster from start to finish. The Trump Administration never kept sufficient records for the kids they forcibly separated from their parents, and seemingly had no intention to reunite them. Inexcusable.
What is the Trump Administration doing to reunite the 711 “lost” children with their parents, who were forcibly removed from their mothers &amp; fathers at the border? We cannot rest until every child is safely back in their parents’ arms.

The Trump Administration should own up to its cruel decision to forcibly separate children at the border, and the humanitarian disaster that ensued in its aftermath. There is no one else to blame for this chaos. https://t.co/7jHTJ9JgVA
The Trump Admin’s child separation policy is more than a bureaucratic lapse in judgment. It is – and was – a cruel policy inconsistent with the bedrock values of this nation. We can have border security without bullying. We can be safe without treating toddlers as terrorists.
On Secretary Nielsen's watch, nearly 2,700 children have been separated from their parents &amp; more than 700 children still have not been reunited with their families – including over 400 whose parents were apparently deported &amp; more than 90 whose parents cannot be located at all. https://t.co/UcUUlhYrre

Medicare has been the health care security blanket for so many seniors. As this essential program turns 53 today, it’s a reminder that we have to be vigilant in protecting it for years to come. #Medicare53
These products, especially flavors that shamelessly appeal to kids, are doing more harm than good. It’s time to hold this industry accountable for their marketing tactics on our kids.
E-cigarettes represent the "re-invention of smoking" cooked up by Big Tobacco. Fewer and fewer kids are smoking cigarettes, threatening Big Tobacco’s pocketbook, so they’ve had to develop new kid-friendly flavors to addict our kids on their nicotine products.
Our bill is simple: it makes tobacco companies prove that their kid-friendly e-cig flavorings 1) help adults quit smoking; 2) don’t cause kids to start smoking; and 3) don’t harm the user. It’s that simple. https://t.co/XdZrmkQy13

The DETER Act would make “improper interference in U.S. elections” a ground of inadmissibility under U.S. immigration law. Violators would be barred from obtaining a visa to enter the United States.
According to the indictment, these Russians “falsely claimed they were traveling for personal reasons.” They traveled across America to collect intelligence for the Internet Research Agency’s operations, which included waging “information warfare” against the 2016 election.
Russians traveled to the United States with the explicit purpose to learn more about American political &amp; electoral processes &amp; how they could interfere. One of Mueller's indictments describes how these Russians gathered intelligence during a three-week trip in June 2014.

Soybean farmers in Illinois tell me that since the start of the president’s trade war, they’ve seen their crop value drop by 20 percent. Declaring a trade war on the world, instead of the truly bad actors, leaves a lot of collateral damage.

Let me be just as clear. I will keep fighting until every child is reunited with their parent &amp; I will do everything in my power to stop a bill that would authorize the Trump Administration to throw migrant children in jail and throw away the key. It is immoral and un-American.
The Administration’s goal is clear – in the midst of the world’s worst refugee crisis, they want to make the situation for families fleeing persecution as painful as possible – in order to deter them from seeking safe haven in our country.
The Trump Administration claims they are concerned about what they call “catch and release.” But there are alternatives to family detention that are secure, more humane, and use less taxpayer dollars.
Experts tell us that jail is no place for children, and that even short term detention can do permanent damage to a child’s health and wellbeing.
Because of the backlash, the Trump Administration is no longer separating families. Instead, they want to jail them indefinitely.
And the Administration has 37 children in custody who have, “not yet been matched” to their parent. In other words, the government has lost track of the parents of 37 children. This is an outrage.
More than half – 463 – have parents who are, “not in the U.S.” – apparently because they have been deported by this Administration.
What about the other 917 children? My office has heard from attorneys who are representing some of these children and they have not been given any explanation for why they are not eligible to be reunited with their parents.
The Trump Administration has identified 2,551 children between the ages of 5 and 17 who were separated from their parents. Of these children, the Administration claims that only 1,634 are “possibly eligible” for reunification.
This Thursday is the deadline for reuniting thousands of other children with their families. Here is what we know as of last night:
The court deadline for reuniting 103 children under the age of five was two weeks ago. Only four were reunited with their parents before the deadline. Even now, two weeks later, the Administration has reunited only 58 of these 103 children.

Amid President Trump's deeply troubling mix of lies, and his naïve &amp; dangerous cozying up to foreign dictators who want to weaken our nation &amp; democracy, where are today’s Republicans who are willing to stand up to him?
We urge our colleagues to support this amendment. It can’t wait because Russia isn’t waiting. Republicans need to speak up loud and clear, with Democrats, that we won’t let a foreign power interfere in our elections ever again.
This was an important first step. But more must be done. That’s why I support @SenatorLeahy &amp; @amyklobuchar’s amendment to the appropriations bill we are considering this week. The amendment would offer an additional $250 million in election security grants for states.
Earlier this year, we finally came together on a bipartisan basis to provide $380 million in the FY18 omnibus spending bill for states to modernize and secure their election systems.
It’s imperative that we make a serious effort to secure our elections in the face of Russian interference and cyber threats. President Trump may not want to believe it, but the threat is real and demands American resolve.

Let’s not hide the ball, this goes to fundamental questions of transparency and accuracy. More from my remarks to Judiciary Committee members this morning: https://t.co/b82ZpNQlRZ
The Senate deserves to see every document related to his time in the Bush White House – the same precedent Elena Kagan was held to by the Judiciary Committee for documents related to her time in the Clinton White House.
Documents pertaining to his time in the Bush White House bear a direct relevancy to a sworn statement he made under oath that has now been disputed.
Judge Kavanaugh never replied to a letter I sent him 11 years ago about a misleading answer he gave during Congressional testimony on his involvement in questions about the rules governing detention of combatants during the Bush Administration.
This passed 98-0, just as it should. We should never need to pass a resolution reaffirming our commitment to protect U.S. ambassadors from questioning by foreign governments, but this President’s pursuit of Putin's agenda made it necessary. https://t.co/BAVLfeRQqx
Bounds wrote articles that his own county bar association described as “racist, misogynistic, homophobic and disparaging of survivors of sexual assault and abuse.”  He then failed to disclose these articles to Oregon’s judicial selection committee.
Ryan Bounds never deserved a seat on the federal bench. I’m glad his judicial nomination was just withdrawn.
It's up to Speaker Ryan to do the right thing and call up the #NetNeutrality resolution in the House so we can finally restore the rules that protect a free and open internet #SaveTheInternet.

My Republican colleagues are simply rubber-stamping President Trump’s nominees for life despite so many of them being extreme. The fact that they moved forward this week with these two nominations is a troubling sign for how they'll handle the Supreme Court vacancy.
This is not a close call. The Senate should not move forward with Mr. Bounds’ nomination. It is hard to believe Senate Republicans would abandon the century-old blue slip tradition for the sake of this nominee.
Not only did Mr. Bounds publish these writings, but he chose not to share his writings with Oregon’s judicial selection committee - even though the committee had asked him to disclose any potentially controversial materials.
The statement went on to say that the association “strongly disavows the views expressed in those articles as racist, misogynistic, homophobic and disparaging of survivors of sexual assault and abuse.”
The Multnomah Bar Association said Bounds’ writings “express insensitive, intolerant, and disdaining views toward racial and ethnic minorities, campus sexual assault victims, and the LGBTQ community.” https://t.co/geHsVOnExH
Mr. Bounds has written and published articles that should disqualify him from consideration for a federal judgeship. Consider how a county bar association that Mr. Bounds has belonged to for 12 years described his articles after they were revealed.
By ignoring the objections of home state senators, Republicans are diminishing the voice that home-state constituents have, through their senators, in the process of selecting judges in their states. This precedent could affect every state.
Now Republicans are looking to rubber-stamp Ryan Bounds to be a federal circuit judge sitting in Oregon. Bounds has received zero blue slips; his nomination is strongly opposed by both of Oregon’s senators.
Mr. Oldham’s views are outside the judicial mainstream and show an extreme ideological agenda. That’s clear from his writings and own words.
He has also called the Supreme Court “the most dangerous branch” and told the Federalist Society that there are “particular things that I think are illegitimate in the way that we conduct modern American law.”
In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Oldham refused to say that the landmark #SCOTUS case Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. He also refused to say whether he agreed that voter discrimination still exists in the United States.
Senate Republicans just rubber-stamped another extreme, Federalist Society-approved judicial nominee to the federal appellate bench: 39-year-old Andrew Oldham
Judge Kavanaugh must also answer whether he would support the existing special counsel investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy. His record shows serious cause for concern.

The Administration even had the gall to tell us today that “nothing went wrong” with the family separations. When will the Republicans who control Congress hold the Administration accountable for this cruelty and incompetence?
It’s no wonder the judge overseeing the case said “HHS either does not understand the Court’s orders or is acting in defiance of them.”
The flowchart calls the separated children “UAC” - which means unaccompanied alien children. But they’re only unaccompanied because the Administration separated them from their parents!
The Administration gave us a copy of this convoluted flowchart that apparently is being used to determine whether to reunite children with their parents and seems designed NOT to reunite families. https://t.co/l08FaVU6xg
But the Administration couldn’t (or wouldn’t) tell us how many families are detained and wouldn’t give us a copy of the waiver form they signed.
The Administration told us that some parents have waived their children’s rights to be held in a facility that has a state child-welfare license and to be released after 20 days. These families are now being held in DHS detention centers.
We were told the government has identified at least 180 parents who have been deported without being united with their children. The Administration said some of the 180 agreed to be deported but couldn’t (or wouldn’t) say how many.
I still haven’t received answers to dozens of questions I sent the Administration weeks ago after another private closed-door briefing I attended. Today Administration officials still couldn’t answer many basic questions about family reunification.
This is not how Congressional oversight is supposed to work. The American people have a right to know what is being done in their name. So I’m going to share some of what I learned.
.@SenateDems asked for a public Judiciary Committee hearing on Trump’s cruel and immoral family separations with Administration witnesses testifying under oath. Instead, today we received a short private briefing that was closed to the press and public.
I spoke on the Senate floor this morning about President Trump's appalling performance yesterday in Helsinki. Watch it here: https://t.co/TlVuIloq7o
Enough is enough. I urge my Republican colleagues here in the Senate, speak up. Put country before party and certainly before Putin.
Instead of condemning President Trump and supporting the Special Counsel’s efforts to get to the bottom of Russian election meddling, many Congressional Republicans are actively working to undermine the investigation.
We should all agree that our country comes before party. So then why do most of my Republican colleagues remain silent on the President's performance yesterday?
We have an American President who seems utterly incapable of saying the obvious to Vladimir Putin. He’s still in denial this morning. https://t.co/TbECy8B6nJ
My full statement on President Trump's Helsinki press conference: https://t.co/On846iCrWU
Question to Republican leaders: Will you stand with John McCain’s clear condemnation of President Trump’s Helsinki performance?
The President’s non-stop preening over his 2016 election victory shows clearly that his ego is more important to him than standing up for America.
President Trump’s performance in Helsinki was appalling. By ignoring the evidence of Russian interference in our 2016 election, President Trump joined Vladimir Putin in blaming America for the charges and throwing our intelligence and justice officials under the bus.

NATO allies have stood by us in our darkest hours, sending their men &amp; women into battle with U.S. troops, sometimes to die for the causes we share.

Let me be just as clear. This Senator will do everything in his power to stop legislation that would authorize the Trump Administration to throw migrant children in jail and throw away the key. It is immoral and un-American.
The Trump Administration’s goal is clear – in the midst of the world’s worst refugee crisis, they want to make the situation for families fleeing persecution as painful as possible – in order to deter them from seeking safe haven in our country.
And they are asking Congress to pass legislation overturning the Flores agreement and authorizing them to jail children indefinitely.
According to media reports, the Trump Administration plans to appeal the Flores settlement - a legally binding agreement to protect the best interests of children that has been in place for over 20 years.
I’m not going to stop demanding answers from this Administration until it abides by the court’s order and reunites every single child who has been separated from their parents #FamiliesBelongTogether.
The Administration’s real plan is not to reunite these families but to undermine the Flores settlement, a legally-binding agreement in place for over 20 years that protects the best interests of detained children.
The Trump Administration continues to try to shift the blame for this humanitarian crisis onto Congress, when in reality this is, as a federal court found, “a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making.”
Contrary to what HHS Secretary Azar told Congress, many parents of separated children reportedly still do not know where their children are, and their attempts to contact them have been unsuccessful.
The Administration has failed to even identify the parent of one child and has made no effort to contact 12 parents who the Administration itself deported.
Yesterday, the Trump Administration notified the court that it has identified 102 separated children under the age of five – and that only four of these children were reunited with their parents before the deadline.
I spoke on the Senate floor this morning about the Administration’s cruel and immoral policy of separating families fleeing persecution. Watch the speech here: https://t.co/mo9kqrzwjc
Also, @RonWyden, @SenFeinstein, @PattyMurray, and I are calling for the removal of ORR Director Lloyd – he is the one largely responsible for these children and his silence is deafening. He must go. https://t.co/iYbh08632j

Beyond Mr. Benczkowski’s Russia ties and troubling judgment, he’s been nominated to head the DOJ Criminal Division and hasn’t prosecuted one single case. Not one. https://t.co/bda4GuMnnZ
In fact, I am increasingly convinced that President Trump is so enamored by validation-seeking autocrats and offended by allies expressing disagreements that he is incapable of distinguishing friends from enemies.
I do not know of any modern president who let normal disagreements between key allies turn into personal spats that alienate our friends and undermine our security.
I continue to be deeply concerned about the current course of American foreign policy under this President. He's willing to undermine allies and instead cozy up to adversaries like Russia and North Korea.
I posed a simple question to my Republican colleagues: What has happened to the party of Ronald Reagan when it comes to national security matters today?

Remember, thousands of other children are still separated from their parents because of Trump’s cruel and immoral immigration policy. Your voices are still needed. RT to spread the word.
The court said these separations are causing “irreparable harm” and this humanitarian crisis is “a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making.”
BREAKING: The Trump Administration says that ONLY FOUR of 102 separated children under age 5 were reunited before today’s court’s deadline. They can’t even identify the parent of one toddler and have made no effort to contact 12 parents who ICE deported.
Brett Kavanaugh would be the deciding vote on this Court to change the rules in America for the next generation.
And just in time, the President has found a Supreme Court nominee who argues Presidents should not be distracted with criminal investigations and prosecutions while in office.
Kavanaugh’s views on the Second Amendment are straight out of the gun lobby playbook.
Given a choice between the freedom of women to plan their own families and the strong hand of government, women lose.
Given a choice between polluters and public health, he consistently finds a legal escape for the polluters.
His record shows that given a choice between corporations and consumers, he’s a reliable ally of big business.
If Justice Kennedy was a swing vote on the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh would swing the Supreme Court to the far right #WhatsAtStake.

Will Senate Republicans simply rubber stamp this nomination? The Benczkowski vote could mark a pivotal moment in the Russia investigation. The warning signs are clear. Read my letter here: https://t.co/I3FbK26ZMJ
Benczkowski has no prosecutorial experience. He showed poor judgment by choosing to represent Russia’s Alfa Bank while he was seeking a DOJ job despite reports that Alfa was under criminal investigation. He won’t commit to recuse himself from Russia-related matters if confirmed.
Today Senate Republicans have scheduled the first procedural vote on the nomination of Brian Benczkowski to head the DOJ Criminal Division. Mr. Benczkowski is the wrong person for this job.
At 10:30am I’ll join @SenateDems at #SCOTUS to share #WhatsAtStake with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Livestream here: https://t.co/AtKco2KQgC
The stakes for this SCOTUS nomination are historic. Critical rights, freedoms, and protections are hanging in the balance. #WhatsAtStake.
Replacing Justice Kennedy’s swing vote with a far-right jurist like Judge Kavanaugh could change the rules in America. With a subservient Republican Congress and a far-right Supreme Court, there is a real risk that the worst impulses of the Trump presidency will go unchecked.
And in light of the ongoing Russia investigation, is it a coincidence that President Trump picked a nominee who has expressed staunch opposition to criminal investigations of sitting Presidents?
Judge Kavanaugh has a record on the bench of consistently favoring big business and undermining protections for consumers, workers, women, and the environment.
The Committee will need access to documents about Judge Kavanaugh’s work in the Bush Administration to get to the bottom of these contradictions.
In 2007 I sent Brett Kavanaugh this letter asking to explain his inaccurate and misleading testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. I’m still waiting for an answer. https://t.co/c7XoGJKDSj

We must send a clear message that DOJ will stand strong against Russian meddling. That means withdrawing the Benczkowski nomination and putting in a DOJ Criminal Division head who has real prosecutorial experience and is free and clear from Russian connections.

Watch this vote next week. Republicans will try to confirm Benczkowski while attention is focused on SCOTUS. This could be a pivotal moment in the Russia investigation.
In May I joined my Senate Judiciary Democratic colleagues in calling for Benczkowski’s nomination to be withdrawn. See our letter here: https://t.co/3JEbCfjGcv
Why does President Trump want Brian Benczkowski for this important job? Why not find an attorney who has actual prosecutorial experience and who is free and clear from Russian connections? And we still don’t know the full story behind Alfa Bank and what they did in 2016.
Benczkowski has no prosecutorial experience. He showed poor judgment by choosing to represent Alfa Bank while he was seeking a DOJ job despite reports that Alfa was under criminal investigation. And he won’t commit to recuse himself from Russia-related matters if confirmed.
Heading the DOJ Criminal Division is a critically important job. This person will supervise over 600 federal prosecutors handling thousands of cases and investigations, and will oversee sensitive matters such as the criminal investigation of Michael Cohen.
Remember Brian Benczkowski? He represented Russia’s Alfa Bank and was a top staffer to then-Senator Sessions. Senate Republicans plan to vote next week to confirm him to head the DOJ Criminal Division.

The government has a legal &amp; moral obligation to ensure that each of these kids can be located by, and quickly reunited with, his or her parents. The Trump Administration took these children away from their parents. They must fully comply with the court’s order and reunite them.

No law requires children to be ripped away from their parents. This cruel policy would end today if the Republicans who control Congress demanded it.

I call on all Republicans &amp; Democrats who care about Dreamers and still believe we are a nation of immigrants to oppose this cruel legislation.
Instead, next week he will try to pass partisan legislation that uses Dreamers as hostages to advance the President’s anti-immigrant wishlist. This bill would slash *legal* immigration &amp; fast-track deportations of women &amp; children fleeing horrific gang &amp; sexual violence.
If Speaker Ryan had the courage to bring the #DreamAct to the floor of the House it would pass on an overwhelming bipartisan vote. We cannot wait, the time to act is now #DreamActNow.
I’ve been urging Republican leaders in Congress to do the right thing by these kids and pass the bipartisan #DreamAct. It’s the only way to protect these talented students, teachers, nurses, and a whole host of others who love this country as much as anyone.
In September of last year, President Trump made the cruel decision to end #DACA. Now, 800,000 Dreamers face deportation to countries they have never known.
On this day 6 years ago President Obama established #DACA. This program gave young immigrants the chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they’ve ever called home.

Yesterday, the state of Illinois put the health of our young people ahead of Big Tobacco. This new law will help prevent our kids from getting hooked on a lifetime addiction to nicotine. https://t.co/adro4HkqEc

It is no secret that big tobacco companies will stop at nothing to hook young people on their addictive and dangerous products. We must be proactive in educating young people about the dangers posed by e-cigarettes. Read our full letter here. https://t.co/nCOH5buZQw
Nationwide, the use of e-cigarettes among high school students has been skyrocketing – largely because of kid-friendly candy and fruit flavorings and sleek looking devices that can easily be concealed in classrooms.
Today, @SenDuckworth and I sent letters to high school and middle school Superintendents across Illinois requesting information on student use of e-cigarettes and vaping products, such as the JUUL vaping device.

We're 21 weeks into 2018, and there have already been 23 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed. That averages out to more than 1 shooting a week. 	 	Is there any sane person in America who thinks our kids should have to go through this? https://t.co/26ccXv3fjs
My heart is heavy for the students, teachers, faculty, families, and community of Noblesville West Middle School following today’s shooting. My thanks go out to the first responders who were quick to act.

Sadly, Trump Admin &amp; Secretary DeVos are more concerned w protecting their rich buddies in the for-profit college industry than protecting America’s students. 	 	They don’t seem to care that taxpayer $$ are being wasted, as long as those $$ are going into their friends’ pockets.
In her latest move, Sec. DeVos has dismantled the Enforcement Unit that was set-up in 2016 to prevent future fraud by for-profit colleges. She did this all while tens of thousands of students continue to wait for the federal student loan discharges to which they are entitled.

We may not be able to stop every shooting in our schools and in our streets. But if Congress takes meaningful action to close the gaps in our gun laws, we will save lives.
Congress is going to have to choose who they listen to more -- the students who are in class thinking about whether their desks are in the line of fire, or the gun lobbyists who want to further weaken gun laws on the books so they can make more sales. I know where I stand.
Last Friday, the nation watched in horror as news broke of yet another school shooting, this time at Santa Fe High School. 	 	Today, I called on Congressional Republicans to stand up to the gun sales lobby &amp; act to help prevent future violence https://t.co/HGnwu6kEh5

In the coming days, we will be introducing bipartisan legislation that represents a much-needed comprehensive approach to Venezuela’s political, economic, and humanitarian crisis.
Under Maduro the Venezuelan govt has taken a series of repressive &amp; undemocratic actions that threaten its people. He &amp; his government must delay the election at least 6 months to allow for a legitimate campaign &amp; electoral process that meets established international standards.
Today, @SenatorMenendez and I warned the Maduro regime in Venezuela that its upcoming sham election would be considered illegitimate if it failed to meet basic established standards, and called for free and fair election for the Venezuelan people.

Every day President Trump waits to take action on Rx drugs adds to the significant financial burden facing Americans and threatens patients' health. We don’t need vague speeches, we need action. Right now, he’s breaking his promise.
Instead, he’s continued to side with big pharma companies that price gouge and markup Rx drug prices. If pharma industry executives support your plan to lower Rx drug costs, you’re not going to fix anything.
President Trump took office 16 months ago and in that time, Rx drug prices have continued to skyrocket. His administration hasn’t take one action to help Americans struggling with these high costs.
He pledged to take on drug companies to help lower Rx drug prices, but he hasn’t even come close to doing that. Instead, he lined the pockets of big pharma CEO’s with a giant tax break last year.
Ahead of the President’s speech on Rx drug pricing, let’s remember what candidate Trump promised the American people…

While the FDA has recently taken important steps, e-cigarette companies continue to take a page out of Big Tobacco’s playbook to market their addictive products to youth. Today I joined @advocatehealth in Normal, IL to call on the FDA to do more. https://t.co/xmNozbkkoh

We can't let the second act be pillaging from the programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) that actually help low and middle income Americans the most in the false name of fiscal responsibility.
The devastating first act of the #GOPTaxScam and phony fiscal conservatism has been to explode our nation’s deficit to provide enormous benefit to the rich and powerful.
The GOP treated our tax dollars like monopoly money. This debt is a burden we will be passing onto our children and it'll take generations to pay it off. #TaxDay.
The CBO has predicted the #GOPTaxScam would cost us roughly $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. So much for the GOP’s promise that these tax cuts would pay for themselves. #TaxDay.
It doesn’t stop there. More than 100,000 employees at large corporations have lost their jobs. Remind me how this bill was supposed to bring about tax relief for working families? #TaxDay
They took their tax-payer funded tax cut, turned right around &amp; gave their wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders a raise. In 2018, large corporations have announced over $235 billion in share buybacks – far outpacing the rate of companies announcing one-time bonuses for workers. #TaxDay

Let’s come together and work on bipartisan ideas to improve upon the law and make the next 8 years even better than the last.
Despite GOP attempts to rip health care away from 20 million Americans (and their ongoing sabotage efforts which are driving up premiums), this law turns 8 today.
Health plans must cover basic, important health care needs – from doctor and hospital visits, to prescription drugs, to mental health and substance abuse treatment.
Insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition … and they can’t impose lifetime/annual caps on your benefits.
The Affordable Care Act turns 8 years old today.	 	Because of this law, more than 20 million people have gained health insurance (including one million Illinoisans).

We can't continue to let the NRA have veto power over gun policy in this nation. We are facing an epidemic of violence, with hundreds of Americans shot every day. Let’s put the safety of our kids and our neighborhoods ahead of the gun lobby’s agenda of selling more guns.

Opioid quota reform is needed so DEA can take important factors like diversion and abuse into account when setting quotas, rather than only chasing the downstream consequences of this crisis.
DEA plays an important gatekeeper role over the volume of opioids that can be produced each year. And while DEA has taken recent steps to lower opioid quotas, their ability to do so is limited.
14 billion opioid doses are put on the market each year—far more than necessary under current medical guidelines and enough for every adult American to have their own bottle of addictive painkillers.
Such increases occurred largely because current law directs DEA to only consider certain factors when setting quotas—like past sales and estimated demand—but not other factors such as the impact of such opioid production on diversion, abuse rates, or overdose deaths.
DEA approved significant increases in aggregate opioid production quotas between 1993 and 2015, including a 39-fold increase for oxycodone and a 12-fold increase for hydrocodone.
Every day, more than 100 Americans die from an opioid overdose. While we know that there are legitimate uses for opioid painkillers, we also know that these dangerous pills are being over-produced, over-prescribed, and over-dispensed.
I’ve joined @SenJohnKennedy, @SenFeinstein and @ChuckGrassley to introduce a bill that would strengthen DEA’s ability to prevent opioid abuse. The agency should be able to consider the opioid epidemic’s downstream effects when setting quota levels for opioid production each year.

The need for the Dream Act has never been more urgent—tens of thousands of Dreamers are still losing their work permits and protection from deportation.
Six months ago, President Trump created the DACA crisis. For six months, his administration has used every available legal option to prevent Dreamers from keeping their DACA protection.

The American people can now see the President’s agenda for what it is, and it’s not protecting Dreamers.
Democrats and a handful of courageous Republicans tried to free the Dreamers by paying that $25 billion ransom for Trump’s infamous border wall. But he rejected that offer.
Yesterday the Senate rejected the President’s immigration plan by a bipartisan supermajority.
Dramatically cutting the number of immigrants from African countries that he hatefully disparaged.
Fast-tracking deportations of Central American women and children fleeing gang and sexual violence.
Reducing legal immigration by more than 40 percent by barring Americans from sponsoring their parents, siblings and children as immigrants.
Let’s be honest, President Trump’s plan is to ransom these young Dreamers in exchange for his entire anti-immigrant agenda.
Give me a break. You killed DACA and have now rejected six bipartisan deals to protect Dreamers. I’ve been fighting for Dreamers for 17 years and will never abandon them.

Dreamers are teachers, nurses, and engineers who contribute immensely to our country. 86% of Americans are behind them, and I’m one of them. Let’s do the right thing by keeping them in this country #DreamActNow.
DACA recipients are talented young people, their majors include: medicine, business, engineering, computer science. We must pass the #DreamActNow to #ProtectDreamers.

I’m heartbroken that 18th District Commander Paul Bauer lost his life in a shooting today. My thoughts are with his family and @Chicago_Police during this difficult time.
We have a chance to get this right. Dreamers have pledged allegiance to one flag. The Dream Act gives these young people a chance for a future in America, their home.
More than 19,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status because of the crisis President Trump created. After March 5th, one thousand will lose their status every day and be subject to deportation. The stakes couldn’t be higher to find a deal this week.

Joining @Morning_Joe soon to discuss the latest on the Dream Act in the Senate. Hope you can tune in.
The President’s immigration framework would fast-track deportations of children who come to our border fleeing war, gangs, and sexual violence. It would be unconscionable to do this to families in the midst of the world’s worst refugee crisis.
On the backs of Dreamers, the White House is attempting to radically slash legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from reuniting with their parents, siblings, and children. This isn’t what America should stand for.
President Trump has rejected three separate offers to fund his broadly unpopular wall in exchange for the broadly popular Dream Act.
We have to end this needless delay now. I joined a bipartisan group of Senators today, urging congressional leadership to do the right thing by American families and pass a funding extension for community health centers ASAP.
Community health centers provide affordable health care to 27 million Americans, including 1.3 million Illinoisans. They're invaluable everywhere, but especially in rural communities. And yet, more than four months ago, Congress allowed funding for these health clinics to expire.

I’ve been clear from the start: I will consider reasonable border security measures to pass the #DreamActNow. $18 billion for a wall we don’t need and the American people don’t want doesn’t fall into the “reasonable” category.
The White House set this crisis in motion when it ended DACA four months ago. Now, they are using Dreamers as a bargaining chip to pass a wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills. That’s being unreasonable #DreamActNow.

Just in: Senate GOP rams through partisan tax bill that will hurt millions of working families across the country while the wealthiest 1% &amp; largest corporations receive nothing short of a windfall #GOPTaxScam
The bottom line is that Republicans believe we can afford to add $1.5T to the national debt when it comes to giving tax cuts to the wealthy, but we can’t afford it when it comes to helping the most vulnerable in our society. #GOPTaxScam
The real surprise here is that many of the so-called “fiscal hawks” in the Republican Party are ready to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit after complaining about our national debt for the last 8 years under President Obama. #GOPTaxScam
I’m on the Senate floor touting the #GOPTaxScam for what it is – a massive give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans. Watch live here: https://t.co/x87BhFnet2
The nonpartisan @USCBO says that 13 million Americans will lose their health insurance &amp; insurance premium costs will go up by 10% each year if the #GOPTaxScam is signed into law.
After failing miserably to achieve one of their campaign promises to repeal the #ACA &amp; take away #healthcare from millions of families, Republicans have slipped in to the #GOPTaxScam a provision that will undermine our health care system.
Why are the GOP rushing through their partisan #GOPTaxScam? Because if the bill were to receive proper scrutiny, it would be revealed for what it is—a monumental give-away to corporate special-interests, campaign donors, and the wealthiest Americans.

I promise to continue to fight on behalf of gun violence victims, including the children &amp; women who were murdered at #SandyHook five years ago. They will not be forgotten. https://t.co/Yz5fWHUeuX
We have seen far too many lives lost – in #SandyHook, in Chicago, in towns and communities across America – to stand by silently.  We must act to reduce the deadly toll of gunfire.
While mass shootings continue to occur with horrifying frequency in the U.S., the gun lobby and the Republican Congress are trying to weaken laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  That is wrong.
And sadly, Congress has done nothing – nothing – to try to prevent another senseless tragedy like #SandyHook from happening again. Instead, last week, the GOP-controlled House of Reps. passed legislation that would weaken gun laws on the books in many states, including Illinois.
5 years ago today, 12 little girls, 8 little boys, and 6 educators were senselessly &amp; heinously murdered at #SandyHook a mere 11 days before they were supposed to celebrate the Christmas holiday w their family &amp; friends. It remains one of the darkest days of my time in Congress.

That is far too high. I'll continue to work with DEA to bring these opioid quotas down to a lower level of legitimate medical need. 	 	With over 200 million opioid prescriptions written and tens of thousands of people dying, Congress &amp; the DEA have a responsibility to act.
However, drug companies still flood the market with an estimated 14 billion opioid pills – enough for every adult in America to have a one-month prescription.
Since 2016, DEA has met with me several times &amp; worked to lower opioid quotas 2 years in a row. Aggregate production quotas are now down by an average of 41 percent from where they were in 2016 https://t.co/m3zv9fbY5e
Between 1993 &amp; 2015, DEA allowed production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold and hydrocodone to increase 12-fold.  With higher quotas, opioid prescriptions soared – from 76 million in 1991 to 245 million in 2014 – and overdose deaths quadrupled to more than 33,000 in 2015.
At today's Judiciary Committee hearing, I questioned the DEA Acting Assistant Administrator on the DEA's role in the rise of the national opioid addiction epidemic. Watch below https://t.co/speMaCe2vJ

Republican health care promises do not match reality. I urge my colleagues to actually do something for the Americans we serve and and work with us to strengthen our health care system.
Republicans promised to lower health insurance premiums.	 	Instead they’ve acted to increase premiums via repeal, sabotage, and refusing to pass bipartisan health care stabilization bills.
Republicans promised to treat the opioid epidemic like an emergency.	 	Yet there has been no emergency funding to respond to it.
Republicans promised to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 	 	Instead, their #GOPTaxScam lowered the corporate tax rate for Big Pharma.
Health care funding for 9 million kids expired more than 2 months ago. 	 	Republicans promised to reauthorize CHIP — so far all they’ve offered are words and half measures.

Fourth, the Rohingya prison camps in Myanmar must be closed and all Rohingya must be free to travel, work, send their kids to school, access to health care, and gain citizenship.
Third, if any Rohingya choose to return to Myanmar, the process of repatriation must be monitored by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
Second, we must require that those in the Myanmar military responsible for crimes against humanity be held personally accountable in an international tribunal.
First, we must demand full access by the official UN fact-finding mission, NGOs, and the press to North Rakhine to verify the devastation &amp; discourage even more exploitation.
The Myanmar military has burned hundreds of villages to the ground and there are countless reports of rape, starvation, and mass killings. America cannot ignore it.

Congress must crack down on the illegal trafficking of guns and impose strict federal punishments on those who supply guns to criminals.
Gun trafficking is one of the key drivers of gun violence in Chicago. Republicans: Do more than just hold another moment of silence. https://t.co/w3g25tG7tA
Congress must pass bipartisan #DreamAct before we leave town for Christmas so Dreamers can rest easy over the holidays. RT if you agree.
In today’s least surprising news, more false claims on immigration from Attorney General Sessions https://t.co/i8dUOfM5Xj
We are a nation of immigrants. That’s my story, that’s my family’s story, and that’s America’s story. #WithDreamers https://t.co/BkzwPUq24O
Dreamer William Medeiros has enlisted in the Army. He'd never turn his back on the country he loves. How can we turn our back on him? https://t.co/iaeZkT0x2y

@POTUS .@POTUS, your commission says proposal in my bill would be "the single fastest way to ↑ treatment availability across the nation”
@POTUS I've introduced the bipartisan Medicaid CARE Act to lift an outdated barrier that restricts addiction treatment: https://t.co/Jj7dzdfYIW
@POTUS .@POTUS needs to quickly invest money and heed his own opioid commission's recommendation to expand access to treatment under Medicaid.
Glad the opioid epidemic is finally being treated as a national public health emergency. But @POTUS must do more. https://t.co/fS5lOGSi43
Trump Admin says they focus limited resources on violent criminals. So why did @CustomsBorder agents target &amp; arrest 10 year old Rosamaria? https://t.co/5orFKB4wCC
For years, Filipino veterans weren’t recognized by the US for their bravery &amp; sacrifice. I told Marlon I’ll keep working to right that wrong

MORNING READ: The Republican legislative playbook → keep Americans in the dark to ram through massive tax cuts for the wealthy few. https://t.co/uLj6mMvuma

If 94% of the American people are ready for comprehensive background checks, why aren't Senate and House Republicans? https://t.co/7CuprxFDA8
Sat down with Burmese Ambassador to the US Aung Lynn to call for an end to the atrocities &amp; systematic discrimination against the #Rohingya. https://t.co/0gb2LBRcbk
Talked with members of My Sister's Keeper about what we can do together to improve the health &amp; wellness of 21 million black women and girls https://t.co/4zeniS1l7v
The President’s idea of “making America great again” is giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. That’s in Trump’s tax plan. https://t.co/o1N7ErXRc3
It’s simple: If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. Retweet if you think so too. https://t.co/VeRK0p32rM
The American people overwhelmingly support background checks (94%). But Republicans in Congress won’t stand up to @NRA and do their job.
Joining @ChrisMurphyCT &amp; victims of gun violence to call for passage of the Background Check Expansion Act. Watch: https://t.co/PtOcH8mXn8 https://t.co/IbTrZCV6sJ

Let’s pass the Dream Act for these young students and teachers — we cannot turn our backs on them. #DreamActNow
DACA recipients are teachers too. If Congress fails to pass the #DreamAct, our school districts could lose an estimated 20,000 educators.
94% of DACA recipients pursued higher education thanks to the program. Ripping away their chance to follow their dreams is not who are. https://t.co/m5sJfBsKkC
72% of DACA recipients are pursuing a bachelor's degree or higher. These young people are the future of our country. #DreamActNow https://t.co/IHR488n6RN
Young people in school shouldn’t have to live in fear of deportation from the only country they love. Which is why must pass the #DreamAct.
NOW: University chancellors and presidents are standing with me to call for passage of the #DreamAct. Watch here: https://t.co/Vk2jC2FsXs
My next constituent coffee with @SenDuckworth is this Thursday in DC! Call my office for details: 202-224-2152.
@SenateGOP @CFPB Republicans to American consumers tonight: We work for big corporations and seedy special interests here in Washington, not you.
@SenateGOP By voting to repeal @CFPB’s #RipOffClause rule, Republicans refused to hold big financial companies accountable for their fraud or misdeeds.
@SenateGOP Here’s what happened →Wells Fargo, Equifax, &amp; big banks took away your right to go to court with help from their friends: Senate Republicans
Under the cover of darkness and distraction, @SenateGOP just voted to rig the system against millions of American consumers. https://t.co/yz5enqeS8S
In about 1 hour, @SenateGOP will throw American consumers under the bus so big financial companies can avoid accountability for fraud. https://t.co/ayFr3FnJpD
I called on @POTUS to ensure these monuments remain in their natural condition for current and future generations to enjoy. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/jRjiNnxmDV
