Kidnappers too,should be given same warning given to ballot box snatchers.		Believe me they deserve more than that.
APC has really succeeded in black- painting and blackmailing #PDP for corruption and other related sinisters.		While		PDP has succeeded in blackmailing APC for hunger and starvation.	Bothe PDP and APC are birds of the same feather.

@GideAbdulwahab QS, take it or leave it ,the suspension of Welter samual Nkanu Onneghen was politically motivated. Attacking the judiciary system of government is like attacking the unity of this Nation.

This is Ahmed Babba kaita of #Apc who defeated his elder brother of #Pdp in today's Daura senatorial by -election.	Before that he was member representing :kankia and kusada local governments.		He happens to be the best House of representative in katsina state. https://t.co/Uat3i3lq3x

@renoomokri Naked truth.
Dear football supporters.		Football is an investment and profit. When you invest more you will definetly earn, succeed and win more.	But,when you invest less you will definetly earn, succeed and win less.	#FootballisAllaboutBussiness.
@NigeriaNewsdesk @todayng Take it or leave it,Shema has done a tremendous projects in katsina state and his spirit will continue to linger on the minds of katsina people. Kudos Shema.
@Meens__ Amin ya Allah.Babu abin da mutuwar zuciya ke haifarwa ,sai bakin ciki da koma baya.
@AishaYesufu That's was then .When Comparing what he had been said and what's now busy doing ,you easily know and understand that ,there is no coherence and cohesion in his utterances.
See mammoth crowd in #PMB's home state (katsina state)		Important dignitaries and heavy weight politicians were all present, during the political rally.		Behold:PDP is now loading and reactivating in my state. https://t.co/lxCRfD83hX
@Zahrahmusa Splendid. Congratulations.
Death has rocked both the upper and lower chambers of Nigeria's legislative.		This and others factors suppose be deemed by our senators and other occupants of political positions. https://t.co/DKXYCtnOLL
@BashirAhmaad APC begins to implement its comphaing strategies. After the first, second ,we are waiting for the next list.
@amkareto @tinkizee2 I am with him,since the federal government could not protect the lives and properties of its citizens.
@RitaPanahi @dodo Fantastic!
@Aminuadagash Allah ya baku zaman lafiya.
I see no reason why some people are ignoring theirs mother tongue.		Weather you like it or not ,your mother tongue is your identity.		So,use and patronize it.
It was yesterday, i understand and realized that ;children are egocentrics.		So,nurture and pamper your children, for, they are the best ladder for jannah.
Tomorrow is (01-4-2018).		May we ,be among those who are going to actualize their dreams.
@farooqkperogi @AkinwunmiAmbode @MBuhari Buhari's Media team lacks consistency in doing their work.

Though, i am not partisan politician.		But i do solute and regard #GovernorEl-rufai ,for his leadership style in Kaduna state.
@DailyPostNGR We had been hearing inauguration of different committees by #PMB.		But the problem is that of implementation of the programs of the committees.		PMB,should wake up from his slumber and initiate programs that are main for masses.
@MaryamTino @GuardianNigeria Do you know the gravity of his words?		Certainly, TY's statement ,is a threats to the sovereignty of our father's land.		Just brainstorm my assertion.
@GuardianNigeria @MaryamTino Indirectly, TY is calling for anarchy.
@MimieLaushi I will call him/her into order and later let him/her go.
@dawisu @MBuhari This is a hate speech and has not suppose to come out from people of higher caliber like Danjuma.
@aminugamawa They are regretting their action. Masses to PMB.
@AishaYesufu @runciecwc I concur.
@farooqkperogi Wonders shall never end in my father's land.
@HouseNGR @YakubDogara @NGRSenate @OrderPaper @GovMAA @Bauchi_Facts @LeadershipNGA @bukolasaraki @ToyinSaraki @daily_trust @DailyPostNGR @BauchiState Amin ya Allah.
Buhari's administration teaches us;1-Saving culture.	2-Financial discipline.
@alinuhu Congratulations legend of kannywood.
The worse and saddest thing is that up to now ,the president  has not plan to visit the soil of the Dafchi incident.Yobe people needs your symbolic presence.#PMB.
Dafchi girls are in captivity while their president was busy attending wedding fatiha in kano.
My president has neglected his primary assignment and busy attended his secondary assignment.
@BashirAhmaad @MBuhari I really lost confidence in Buhari led Administration.
@dawisu Nice outing.
Our institutions needs to be redefined ,in order to cope with the present challeges of #21century.We totally left behind.
@BillkisuB Amin ya Allah.
@tinkizee2 You spoken my mind.

@dadiyata @m_malumfashi @leschique @FalaluDorayi @fdangwani @Meenatishaq1 This man, really deserved my applause.
FGN spend 14,000 on feeding inmate daily while the monthly minimum wage is pegged at 18,000 being in prison is more rewarding!

@alinuhu @BalaUsher @jimiykeofficial @mcbaror Wishing you hitch free.
How can we change our country when we are all not interested in the affairs of our nation? Go and collect your #PVC.....Governor Dankwambo.
@AdizatouGabon Amin ya Allah.
https://t.co/Yj7EN0ZJOx seems kwankwaso would soon be frustrated by rulling party.
With the recent arrest and detention of #Babachirlawal by efcc, has clearly shown that, the OBJ 's letter has started yielding a positive result.
@AishaYesufu @PoliceNG More grease to your elbow. Carry on, until the remaining chibok girls were released.
The recent verbal attacks by former president olusegun obasanjo ,is definitely going  to open a get-way for others to start criticising this #pmb led administration.
@Rahma_sadau @ifeanyiiloduba Congratulations for the safe return home.
@dawisu The best for them is to ignore and silent about the letter. Because definitely, if they talk new things would emerge.
Almighty Allah is there, looking at you and i. So ,always do good and quickly repent for bad deeds.
Nigeria's political system, suppose be overhauled. Because it's too costy.
Your #PVC ,is your YES and NO upon any political aspirant. So preserve it warmly.
@NafisatOfficial Allah ya ba da sa 'a.
@AishaYesufu Congratulations to both of you.

@MBuhari Why always kaduna state? Why didn't commission any thing so far in your state... Sir?
@ContactSalkida @bebs730 Why other Victims of the insurgency are not giving them, the same treatment with the chibok girls ?.This is unfair at all .
@fahadaliyu @WordsworthGwary @LikemindsPro Nice gesture.
@MobilePunch Instead of you to focus on good governance, but you are busy opening campaign office for #buhariosibanjo. I doubt much for your re-election.
@AishaYesufu FG, needs to act deligently  and professionally to end the killings of the innocent citizens.
@AHayatu @Isah_ne @elrufai For what reasons that; he refuses to announce the result?
@ShehuSani We Nigerians are familiar with the fake prophecies of some postors.
@BashirAhmaad We hope the resolutions of the meeting, would be implemented.
@Itz_Shahee I learn to pray and to strive for the desired things.
@NGRPresident I am wishing President Buhari, to actualize his dreams for Nigerians and Nigeria respectively.
@ProfOsinbajo @DigiCommsNG Happy new year too.
@NafisatOfficial Praying and hoping so.
@realDonaldTrump Very unfortunate!
@JibrinIbrahim17 2018 would be a year to decide.

@Bellokingkhan This is yar'adua, a man of vision and mission.
@DailyPostNGR Really, the recent appointment, of dead men into the #buharigoverment was a culpable sign of his  level of sinile dementia .
@NigeriaNewsdesk @todayng The list was prepared two years ago.My question is that; why the predency refuses to review the list before it was being published?
@BashirAhmaad @Sharksawn May Almighty Allah, bless the union.
@AishaYesufu Adieu 2017.And we are hoping 2018 would be a fruitful year to all Nigerians.
@bukolasaraki @SPNigeria @NGRSenate @nassnigeria @USEmbassyAbuja @stuartsymington @MrBanksOmishore @OnemolaOlu @wale_bakare1 @zebbook With this improvement, Nigeria now has the means to fight and to come to an end ,to this insurgency.

@GovAyoFayose Right thinkers, always do right things. More grease to your elbow.
@BashirAhmaad That's the problems of we Nigerians, instead of all of us, to put hands on deck for the lasting solution of our problems. Some would choose to adhere their wishiful thinking.
@MBuhari Do something past... Sir. Let fine out a permanent solution to this reccurent problem.
