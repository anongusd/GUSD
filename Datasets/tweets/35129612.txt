@BruneElections Joe Manchin could win the Democratic Primary in a 13 way race ,  but someone would run as left leaning independent and would get more electoral votes than him. All Manchin could ever do is split the vote, because no way would the Berniecrats even pretend to support him.

@benshapiro You seem to define racism strictly as " to believe one race is inferior" and anything below that doesn't count, you are wrong .
@RubinReport You supporting that notion simply because you no longer are fond of the Democratic party is intellectually dishonest .
There are actually 3 people who could have wrote the op Ed 		Keith Kellogg is the best bet.
The biggest problems for Republicans and their Kavennaugh argument is that you could switch his name with Merrick Garland  and make the same case, which begs the question , " if you believe what you say, then why wasn't Merrick Garland confirmed ?"

Judicial activism = believes LGBTQ people should have the same rights that everyone else has. Thats the context conservatives have used that term in.

@GovMikeHuckabee Governor Huckabee calling anyone a bigot after he stood next to a County Clerk Kim Davis is the definition of hypocrisy and irony all wrapped into one.
For years, conservatives have argued that it is the right of business owners under the philosophy of free association to not serve anyone of their choosing. 	Seems you miscalculated and thought straight white conservatives was a group that could never be discriminated against.

@charliekirk11 So my question to you then, is why did you not speak up for Tim Scott when conservative media ignored him when he was talking about police brutality. It seems you are actually more worried about the size of the platform rather than the whole diversity of thought situation
@BenjiBacker I don't see you articulate that though. The whole diversity of thought argument coming from people we place of the political right is more about being anti left ( as Been Shapiro said) than it is  about sharing new ideas and actually supporting diversity of thought.
Conservatives inadvertantly making a great argument as to why most Black people are Democrats . You( Cons/GOP) seem to only care about people of color when we agree with you, same situation as when Tim Scott got replaced by David Clarke for 2 weeks because of his police views
@BenjiBacker I'd love if you retweeted liberal black people in deep red America making that argument from the other side , that would show you were actually supporting diversity of thought and not just reinforcing your beliefs and supporting "your side" .
@chancetherapper The problem is that most people retweeting you believe the "have " to be Republicans instead . You are feeding a bigger hypocritical argument .
@RealCandaceO @chancetherapper But black people don't have to be Republicans/Conservatives either . 		If you would actually acknowledge both truths, it would go along way to you actually supporting free thinkers
@charliekirk11 @kanyewest The problem with your argument is that diversity of thought does not equate to stomping out the left, which is what Candace Owens( how all this started) seems to want.
Conservatives attacking liberal black people for having a different point of view as them is no different than libs doing it to conservative black people, yet @charliekirk11 @guypbenson @RealCandaceO @RubinReport  and others only care about one of those scenarios

@samwhiteout Well, you are wrong, the SEC has a stipend, and these kids have educations worth 100 of thousands of dollars as well as Pell Grants and other financial assistance, some of these kids pocket 15K+ a semester and then move on to a million dollar NFL career
@BrodyLogan So one comment on one board = "fans"(plural/majority)
@guypbenson If you are going to play that comparative logic BS game, then well  UGA&gt;Oklahoma&gt;Ohio State
@guypbenson Auburn, Alabama and Georgia all had the same conference record. You cant really say Alabama finished 3rd. just because Alabama and Auburn were in the same division, and didnt get to play Auburn a second time around.
@TaylorTwellman The Giants won a superbowl with a 9-7 record. No playoff provides "clarity" by your definition.
@BenjiBacker The truth of the matter is that the SEC was the underdog in  7 of those 9 bowls.  Actual conference match ups were like SEC #9 vs  Big 10 #5.  so lets not pretend like the match ups were even.
The problem with the,UCF, Auburn ,Alabama, Georgia comparative fallacy is that it would also make Syracuse the best team in the country since they beat Clemson
Mark Richt aged 10 years between has last game at Georgia and today.
@Fabrizio_tl @nowthisnews The problem with your argument is that "white culture" does the same thing.
There are conservatives/republicans making fun of the death of  Erica Garner, and they wonder why black people stay away from that ideology and party.
@CollinRugg Like who ?
@RealJohnSandor You believe a lot of conspiracy theories, so the fact that you believe those 2 isnt all that new.
@tarakelm Based off of Offset and Cardi B ????? Thats not the best example to make this argument with.
@RedPillBlack Im pretty sure you dont have to be a republican to understand that white people are not responsible for every problem. The person you quoted is using a lot of hyperbole.
@FLCommonSense @RedPillBlack @TPUSA Again, how is calling other people stupid for simply disagreeing with you going to help your argument, remember, the premise of this thread of tweets was racial make up of the Right.

@smashbrolink @FLCommonSense @RedPillBlack @TPUSA Your post is filled with hyperbole and stereotyping. Just because you attend a protest does not make you a member of either of those groups.
@joetwi2 @RedPillBlack @TPUSA Are you actually trying to a rgue that some site ordinance matters more than the laws passed in your state capital ?
@joetwi2 @RedPillBlack @TPUSA Also, how one votes is not the same as who wins elections. Most black people in this nation live in states controlled by Republicans, not democratic policies.
@joetwi2 @RedPillBlack @TPUSA I dont have a problem with a black person voting for Trump or even being conservative. I have a problem with people like you not believing in that same concept as your post shows with so much irony and bias.
@smashbrolink @FLCommonSense @RedPillBlack @TPUSA What is right in your eyes is not what is right in another's. You have to remember that while you are calling others fools for simply having a different opinion than you
@FLCommonSense @RedPillBlack @TPUSA Considering the post Candace was responding to, the amount of irony in you using the plantation phase is staggering. That aside, there are many people of color who have had the same experience as you from the opposite direction and took the blue pill.
@RedPillBlack @TPUSA your response is going to get a lot of retweets, but it wasnt actually a response to the context.  Both the GOP and the Tea Party Movement have a very small number of minorities. That is just a fact. Maybe you should try to find out why .
@guypbenson ATT had "pure" profit of 13 billion, and you think they gave their employees a 1000 dollar bonus because of Tax reform ????

@velosterapter @guypbenson The rate of increase in cost actually slowed under Obamacare despite republican opposition and sabotage, so in context, you are still wrong, never mind the fact that you are still ignoring the contest of my tweet.
@velosterapter @guypbenson You know the context of which im speaking, so dont play obtuse. I never claimed it saved all money, so dont use an anecdotal argument.  And again, the topic is the purposeful sabotage of the program which has nothing to do with you liking it or not.
@velosterapter @guypbenson Save is a relative term here, so please stay on topic.
@velosterapter @guypbenson Stop the hyperbole. You know that part of the cost saving measures was based on the amount of people signing up. You deter those people from getting involved, you Re purposefully hurting the program.
@velosterapter @guypbenson What does that have to do with the fact that Republicans ran a negative campaign on Obamacare, told people not to sign up, and didnt expand medicaid causing unhealthy people to go into the market and raise prices ?
@TheMarkPantano Considering the American left doesn't wanted socialism, what exactly is your point ?
@guypbenson If you take a tire off a car and all you have is the rim, it will not function; Undermining the mandate, medicare expansion, and not setting up exchanges all hinder the program and increase costs. Dont pretend it doesnt just because you are against the program as a whole.
@PrisonPlanet Naw, im 100% sure people are laughing at her because even many Conservatives see her as a horrible person and that being the reason for her loneliness.  T his int about left vs Right
@guypbenson Jones does not believe abortion should be legal in all cases, it isnt that hard to not use hyperbole.
@benshapiro Roy Moore lost mostly because he is a homophobe and times are changing.
It is always Interesting to watch conservatives says MSM has no credibility because of sex scandals as if FOX News didn't have it's own scandal
@RedPillBlack Id take Conservative black people more seriously if you also combated racism from the Right and Republicans as well.
Dear Ohio State defenders, the win over Wisconsin does not look all that great because the committee never really thought Wisconsin was a great team, same with Penn State. In the eyes of the committee, PSU and WISC = LSU and MSU, so 11-1 Bama &gt;  11-2 OSU

@themuzza60 @DannyAkin exactly, they were peeing where they wanted to then all of a sudden republicans had a problem with it.
@DannyAkin Why is it so hard for conservatives to treat people equally ???? And how is it PC to do so ???
@DavidAFrench  could it be that people simply want others to be treated equally ????
Cudi owns his career to Kanye,  you cant say the same in reverse. Kid Cudi is a best though.
@JmsWmFox my post didnt mention parties or ideology.  So the narrative you are attacking inst present.
@JmsWmFox  Its a trending topic with 160K individuals talking about it, "you guys" isnt partisan, it is descriptive.
@VTRepublican I didnt defend anything,i said people are tweeting generalizations and asked for specifics. You answered with personal attacks
@qwestie @AdversAerialOne If you are going to block or mute ne, please remove my twitter handle from your discussions.
@VTRepublican  Or you could just not read my tweets. Is that to complicated for you ????
@AdversAerialOne @inkersive I find it strange that people who randomly follow others on twitter with not common interest call others creepy
@VTRepublican  Another post from someone who didnt answer the question, thanks for proving my point.
I do love people who follow u, then unfollow u to get their count up, and then get angry that you dont retweet them , LOL
@qwestie @AdversAerialOne If your handle isnt first in the tweet, then it wasnt directed at you. Also, i answered your question.
@qwestie @AdversAerialOne yo have a right to that opinion, but again, i disagree with your premise entirely.
@inkersive @AdversAerialOne  jeh johnson was an Assistant US Attorney, Air force Counsel, General counsel to the DoD, flawed logic
@qwestie @AdversAerialOne I disagree with your premise altogether.
@inkersive @AdversAerialOne Every person who has ever phone banked is a fundraiser.
@AdversAerialOne @qwestie And yet, you arent actually talking about it at all, just generalizations, LOL
@qwestie @AdversAerialOne What does any of this have to do with Hillary Clinton ????? And yes i read a couple.
@inkersive @AdversAerialOne  As i said in my other post, you guys are labeling people like Jeh johnson as pay for play.
@inkersive @AdversAerialOne Except, the "exchange" part is an opinion. thats the flaw in your argument.
@AdversAerialOne Still waiting on you to name a specific, all you can do is talk about some animal tweet.
@AdversAerialOne  Why do u keep saying I should have "helped" you as if I had an obligation to retweet your animal tweets there i never saw?
@JmsWmFox When you guys are claiming Jeh Johnson was pay to play, it is hard to see your argument.
@AdversAerialOne The DNC didnt present Clinton as the eventual nominee, the media and polling did that.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller  I have not mentioned Hillary Clinton a single time, only you have. I see nothing that even mentions CLinton
@JmsWmFox What evidence do you see ???
@AdversAerialOne You are far from intelligent.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller So, you are a follow/unfollow troll, got it.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller  LOL, Are you serious right now ?
I asked people to tell me what they specifically dislike about the #DNCleak , not a single person has been able to tell me.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller  If that was actually true, you would have simply not responded.
@allchops1 It seems you have already proven the point that you can no hold a productive conversation.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller  I not an aminal person, me following you means you followed me  at some point.
@AdversAerialOne @JoelAFuller  I see, you cant answer the question, so you resort to personal attacks, carry on then.
@JoelAFuller @AdversAerialOne  What specifically in the emails do you have a problem with ???
@allchops1  doesnt make my tweet dumb
@allchops1  my tweet is accurate, a majority posting dont seem to have read a single leaked document. You can disagree, but that doesnt....
@realkingrobbo  Are you really trying to argue Jeh Johnson was just a lawyer before he came Homeland Secretary ??????
#DNCleak dont see anything other than people posting vague comments as if they havent read any of the new leaks, they are just assuming.

@hortstu @HumanistReport not really, she was actually very quiet on the subject .
@hortstu @HumanistReport As I said before, he only signed the implementation , Bush signed the actual agreement
@hortstu @HumanistReport 1. trade agreements are negotiated by the executive. He wouldnt have actually been vetoeing the agreement
@hortstu @HumanistReport She has actually said she wont support TPP.
@hortstu @HumanistReport I find forbes to be pro business freedo(not always a good thing), but not really the point.
@hortstu @HumanistReport Well one is agreeing to do it , the other is simply giving it a start date.
@hortstu @HumanistReport Well lets be clear, Bush signed it. Clinton only signed the implementation
@hortstu @HumanistReport  define impartial, or rather give me the names of sites you trust .
@hortstu @HumanistReport My only point about NAFTA really is that if we are going to blame someone, lets blame the right people.

@Geth_V  Have a nice night.
@Geth_V exactly,  you are making my point. I have protested and never said "kill police officers" and yet, you inadvertently said I did.
@Geth_V You are generalizing right now as I have not mentioned "all police" or "all white people"
@Geth_V except, im not arguing that there arent violent protesters, im simply saying that not all are, and you are generalizing.
@Geth_V there are 50 states and 320 million people in this country. arguing 3 vs 1 isnt actually helping your argument.
@Geth_V @AmoraBunny you are judging protesters across america by the actions of one group in one city ????
#ConservativeBecause  I would like to see more decent post on this hashtag
@KateHyde55 @POTUS  It is not his name, and we arent talking about rights.
@hboulware  That you are generalizing and assuming everyone is a hypocrite.
@hboulware But what if someone is outraged by both, then they are not a hypocrite, of if they actually used W as a distinction as many do.
@KateHyde55 @POTUS  That isnt his name and it is not what he chooses to be called. Dowd knew that and did it anyway
@hboulware But shouldnt you be outraged by both in that case and not just one ?
@hboulware The W is used to draw distinction from his father, people making itinto a mockery is a different subject/

@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit I think you missed my point, in short, your argument goes both ways.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit isnt offensive subjective to the individual ???
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit ANd I would argue that it is subjective on your part to judge them the same,LOL. This argument is circular.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit I actually dont think Sanders had to apologize, simply disavow Song's use of it.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit the joke want inappropriate, it was a satirical dinner. bad jokes are actually a part of it, context matters
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit the offense are not similar.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit selective outrage insinuates that the subject matter is equal, they are not.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit  Unwarranted within the venue is not the same as calling someone a whore, which is what was claimed.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit  I dont beleive you have to agree that its ok for him to say it,but its not equal to calling someone a whore
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit The fact thatpeople dont even see that it was a joke about a joke is part of the problem.
@IDoTheThinking @savannahdammit CPT in and of itself is a joke about people saying black people are always late.  It is a black inside joke.
@savannahdammit CPT is a joke about a joke. Not even close to the context of calling someone a whore.

@CNN spent more time on Peyton Manning than on the Flint Water Crisis.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint That something shouldnt be race.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint why do you defend judging someone by the color of their skin ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint yes, racist. Did you expect me to defend it ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  I simply said there are some who are, not a majority, not even a large percentage, just some.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint to a large extent yes, I have said that all along. but some are indeed racist.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint policies dont care about the color of the individual caring it out,
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint Are you saying black people cant be racist ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint and apparently where the white people are in NYC&lt; they proportionally have more guns and drugs
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint if criminal profiling actually worked the way you said, whites would be stopped more than blacks.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint they should be stopped the most as well, but they arent.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint And guns and drugs are found on white guys more than black in New York, which is why your logic is flawed
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint IDK, you brought it up, not me.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint it means the policy is.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint You do realize the Ferguson cops admitted to racial profiling right ???? And even got caught in emails.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint black people get stopped something like 9X more.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint and before you respond, Google the Stop and Frisk stats. More whites with illegal guns than black but....
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  Dems have no problem with tough on Crime, we have a problem with racial profiling.

@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  One of the people beaten by Bull Connor's goons was John Lewis, who is a Democrat now.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint Modern Dems include Many people of color who obviously were not clainsmen
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint How about whether or not you praised Democrats when these cities were doing well ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint Im still waiting for you to name the actual policy that you claimed caused this.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  Why does it have to be major ? Does population determine whether or not a city matters ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint Many cities in Michigan, Dem and Republican have been bankrupt. Hence the flaw in your argument.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint It applies to the specifics of the Michigan Economy, which again, Republicans have controlled.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint And you know what, neither do I. Because I understand diversification of an economy is hard to do
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint Michigan as a State has declined, Republicans control the state, do you blame Republicans ? of course not.
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  You are arguing that being in charge is the same as your policies being the cause of decline, that is a fallacy
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  What part of their financial problems to you specifically contribute to Democratic policies ?
@gcems645 @infmom @MMFlint  Im no no way arguing republicans are evil, only debunking the argument that (D)'s are to blame here.
Republicans say our nation is failing,they forget they control the Senate,House,33 State Houses,35 Senates,31 Governors,yet (D)'s get blamed

@jabney8 @WayneRoot So then we agree, A majority of the voting population, wanted Obamacare.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot But a majority of the people in this country said yes.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot the governor represents the people, but he doesnt speak for all of them
@jabney8 @WayneRoot im simply pointing out that living in a state that didnt create the exchange doesnt mean " the people" didnt want it.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot it is a falsehood to speak as if these guys are unanimously voted into office, that is exactly why i said majority
@jabney8 @WayneRoot Dear, the governor represents all the people, but all the people did not vote for him.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot President Obama got 65 million votes in 2012, are you arguing the negative? if so,  then the same burden is on you
@jabney8 @WayneRoot No, the court said the people bringing the case were wrong as the law even states the Fed would make the exchanges
@jabney8 @WayneRoot No, you said "The People" of 30 states.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot This is a circular argument that the court has already said is wrong.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot No where in the law does it say that. It says, "the State", that is what this whole lawsuit is about.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot Did you not just say the same exact thing with "The people of 30 states comment", how is that any different ???
@jabney8 @WayneRoot No they didnt, there is not a single state that is 100% republican. what you mean to say is 30 governors said no.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot as are millions of people who disagree with you. I would say a Majority seeing as Barack Obama is still President.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot There was no bribe as the subsidies were there either way, and the people were not ignored as I am one of the people.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  We disagree on it being a bad act.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  It doesnt make them obsolete.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot The fact that this was part of the law shows what the word "State" means.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot No im not as the law says the Fed sets up the exchange if the state doesnt, no one added that after the fact.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot Everyone always says that when their party isnt in the Presidency.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot In the context of what you are arguing, his vote didnt matter, its that simple.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot I never said it was up for debate,I said the plaintiff believed it was and  brought it to court, they were wrong.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot All you need is a 5-4 vote for something to pass the court, and since it was 6-3, no , his vote didnt matter in context.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  i didnt say it didnt matter,i said you were wrong about the meaning of the word and the context of your supposed quote.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot The court case wasnt about the exchanges' legality, it was about whether the law stated who got subsidies.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  By the way, the vote was 6-3, roberts vote didnt matter.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot SCOTUS didnt change or rewrite anything, He made the same call most legal scholars already made years ago.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  His statement is about assuming the states would create their own exchanges instead of making the fed do it.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  Gruber wrote Romney care, atleast now your side can admit the 2 are the same.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot But even if it did exist, it has nothing to do with our discussion.
@jabney8 @WayneRoot Um, the Supreme court agrees with me, so its you who needs this. And I have never heard that Obama comment you speak of
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  The word state is what is usually used in formal settings, not "nation" or country. Thats why this is BS by republicans
@jabney8 @WayneRoot  the word state is the 1 being debated in the law,thats it. ONE word, if the law had said nation, we wouldnt be talking.
@WayneRoot  many smart people. Aren't like you, this law was up for debate because of one word.
I am i the only one who remembers @secupp 's "dog whistle" racism speech and wonders if she finally sees the light, @marclamonthill ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Good night.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley You are right, your party made it impossible for anyone to work with them from the start.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley I knew from the start you disliked his polices, but you said you disliked his ideals. So answer the ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley You dislike the idea of making healthcare more affordable, to not be at war with Iran or Russia ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley So you dont think America can be any better ???
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Are you not understanding that you are viewing that word as bad when in reality it isnt ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Our Founding fathers saidAmerica should change, thats why they created amendments to the constitution
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley no, im a Southern Democrat, i understand just fine how you can disagree. however you......
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley You dislike the idea of any of those things ?????
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley unless you believe America has reached perfection, you want it to fundamentally change as well.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley every president has wanted to change america for the better, so you would be wrong there too.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley What creepy agenda did you hate, name specifics, no generalizations.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Its not an alternate universe, Republicans dont hide that this meeting happened.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  What you mean to say is you didnt like his approach.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley You are arguing that the result of their actions is Obama;s fault even though they admit to doing it
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley He tried to work with Republicans and they said no, which their ringleaders admit to.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Newt Gingrich said just oppose everything and we will win by dividing.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley No, they just didnt want the president to succede, read the link and the quotes
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley So who started the agitation isnt really up for debate. http://t.co/X4nPTRfWqY
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  they met the night of the first inauguration and said they would stand against him on everything.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  id argue that the republicans who hated him from the start are the agitators
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley They do, but Congress passes laws, not the president, and you argued power, not perception.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley It started going wrong before Pelosi took the speakership. thats exactly why she got it.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  And in some cases, congress specifically chose them.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  but since you are making that argument you need to acknowledge that congress vetted and liked them.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  Your argument is that those people did a bad job, i disagree.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley The President's nominees to those departments are all vetted by congress.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  You have a right to that opinion, we simply disagree.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  your denial is based on believing the presidency trumps the other branches and power int he states
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Do you deny that you have controlled the House of Representatives ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley Do you deny that you have held the State legislatures and governorship ? Google can rectify that.
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  I compare who has actually had power and it has been republicans. Do you disagree ?
@CapVere @edestrada71 @GovernorOMalley  Kind of sad that republican party cant take responsibility.

@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 Nope, But you seem to argue the opposite end of that spectrum which is no better
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 You on the other hand, argued opinions
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 I do think for myself, and in doing so, i supported my argument with facts.
@HaloChiefPO117 @FilthPigPDX @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1  You think I work for media matters ?????
@UniversityWatc1 All those retweets and none of you can prove me wrong, is this all conservatives have to offer ????
@HaloChiefPO117 @FilthPigPDX @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 the people responsible for their deaths are the terrorist or did you forget ?
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 I posted links to the intelligence committee finds, thats not opinion,thats facts
@HaloChiefPO117 @FilthPigPDX @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 I disproved ur argument by quoting a Republican led investigation but keep trollin
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1  everythign you posted was opinion.
@HaloChiefPO117 @FilthPigPDX @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 You mad, its cool bro. Just dont let those facts from the Benghazi report hurt you
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 I said early on that they did the same thing to Obama		http://t.co/bMlLhwMCMB
@HaloChiefPO117 @FilthPigPDX @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 still waiting on you to prove me wrong.
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 and How does believing that change that the republican report contradicts u
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 The next question is obvious, why blame Hillary if you believe that ?
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1  So you have proof the intelligence agencies were all lying to Hillary ?
@HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 Here are your facts. Read and weep.		https://t.co/nF31hyAIcS
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1  She went on the Info the DNI gave her, are you saying the DNI lied ?

@HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 Posting a meme doesnt make your lie true.
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1  Remember, Republicans controlled the House intelligence committee
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 The lie is that she left them behind, Your own party said you guys are lying.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @UniversityWatc1 And if you believe that, you have admitted you have no proof at the moment, LOL
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @UniversityWatc1 How does it feel to be so naive that you think a meme is "facts" ? You mad bro ?
@HaloChiefPO117 @UniversityWatc1 @terrimore1 im not bright, but you have believed the same Benghazi lie for 3 years? HA HA HA

@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 You are angry enough to red my Bio and see where I live but so blind u didnt see the #OMalley2016 hashtag #fail
@FilthPigPDX @HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes Master Chief wins battles, this guy gets destroyed.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes You guys are that scared of Hillary, you have already given her a victory smoke.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes atleast you admit you changed the subject because facts didnt support your earlier argument.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes  yes Facts do hurt, thats why you havent once refuted the original post you responded too.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes Im good, but you seem a little unhinged, are you ok ???
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes saying you are mocking me doesnt make you any less wrong, but if it makes you feel better, have at it
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes And now you are name calling. Sad but expected.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes I responded to ur post, u plain sought out a fight and in doing so didnt even make a cohesive argument.
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes  nothing in these tweets have anything ri do with what I typed. You are trolling for an argument
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes @fredwimpy @LodiSilverado @alpipkin did you even read the Benghazi report ???
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes @fredwimpy @LodiSilverado @alpipkin how did Hillary let them die ?
@BrentRosenbaum they did, go to google news, put 2008 into the custom search range
@BrentRosenbaum im trying to say it isnt a left v. right thing, its just a "He/she is running for president" thing
@BrentRosenbaum I actually agree, but did they not do the same with Barack OBama not paying a parking ticket when he ran ????
@BrentRosenbaum so of the top retweets are clearly serious, so i would say at least a large chunk see it that way. I never said all though.
@Atlanta_Patriot nothing like race baiting on a friday evening after showing someone how flawed their argument is.
@BrentRosenbaum u should go to the hashtag and hit all,some of these people are taking it seriously and making it a left vs right issue
@Atlanta_Patriot I in no way called you stupid, you however used hyperbole in your defense of this overblown hashtag.
#HowToMakeAConservativeAngry thats easy, point out the falsehoods in #RubioCrimeSpree and they come to you like flies.
@Atlanta_Patriot I didnt say u have no right to post it or me to not read, my argument is that it is over blown, can you not differentiate ?
@Atlanta_Patriot @TheDemocrats you are making a joke, some of your Republican/conservative colleagues are not
@HaloChiefPO117 @terrimore1 @nytimes it tells me you dont actually research your arguments before you make them.http://t.co/qxovT6YkpP
@Atlanta_Patriot this argument insinuates that the world took the story seriously when they obviously did not.
@terrimore1 @HaloChiefPO117 @nytimes what does answering questions have to do with going after her ? she didnt answer the NYT either
@RedStateJake  You dont have to block me, you could simply stop replying and never see me again.
@RedStateJake And yet, you never once refuted what was said. sad
@RedStateJake further more, both post you responded to were truthful and you never even attempted to refute them because you could not
@RedStateJake You have no interest in debating and yet you replied to an independent post of mine ???
@RedStateJake This isnt about thick skin, this is about being an adult and being able to communicate and have intelligent conversations.
@Michele_Henson So you agreed with me, and instead of admitting that you are trolling, you start name calling. sad. We are better than this.
@RedStateJake It is relevant since you seem to see it the way you do. We Americans should debate issues and not name call like children
@Michele_Henson The fact that you arent disagreeing means you are arguing arbitrarily for some odd reason.
@Michele_Henson Or because you are wrong.
@RedStateJake U do realize that Community Organizer is a title used both by Democrats and republicans right ???? And yes twitter does agree
@Michele_Henson nope , you are arguing an opinion, Im arguing an observation, one you didnt even disagree with.
@Michele_Henson My Profile says #OMalley2016, not Hillary, but your definition of skeletons is all about ideology, not proof.
@RedStateJake  If not, then you are just mad that I called you guys out on your BS.
@RedStateJake So you are saying this was trending world wide before Conservatives made it a hashtag ?
@Michele_Henson  What does that have to do with the post you are responding to ????
#RubioCrimeSpree is the perfect example of conservatives making something out of nothing and then claiming "The Left" made it a big deal.
@HaloChiefPO117 @nytimes  The Times went after Hillary for the last 2 months harder than you conservatives have so that makes no sense.

@waltb31 @angelwryter to be fair that link shows 2010 Comcast numbers, they didnt buy NBC until the very end of 2011 year.
@NishwaAshraf LOL, you probably should have said that, instead of the "there is no little guy" argument. It would make more sense.
@NishwaAshraf Not what I was debating,these artist are for exposure more so than anything else,if POND had done this, would it be trending ?
@t3mzilla Because Michael Brown wasnt innocent, and Ferguson from the outside was only about that.
@NishwaAshraf "with a following" is the key flaw in your argument in my opinion.
@NishwaAshraf Would you have heard of it is up and comers aka nobodys were the faces of it, i think not.
10 years ago kids went directly from high school to the NBA,so why is it that u dont think a seasoned NCAA team could beat a bad NBA team?
So many tweets fat shaming @CandyCrowley , are you people proud of yourselves ???
@thesavvy No they didnt, that is why neither your post or the one you responded to actually included a link to the CNN article.
@thesavvy the Obama administration has never done such a thing and you know it
@CNN plays the Atlanta Child Murders more than @BET plays Baby Boy.

@Elk_Eater  State legislatures are gerrymandered just like House seats, the senate would not represent the state because of that.
@Elk_Eater my point was simple, the Constitution is meant to be amended to fix those problems like that.
@Elk_Eater So you want The legislature of a state picking the senate and not the people, why may i ask ???
@Elk_Eater No, the 3/5ths compromise is in the original clause of the Constitution. Article 1, section 2, article 3.  it is not an amendment
@Elk_Eater  The original Constitution says that people of color are 3/5th a person. That legislatures pick the senate, not the people.
@Elk_Eater no you dont. There is  West Wing moment in this, im sure you can guess it.
#UKvsUGA, people always want to see #1 fall.
@Elk_Eater You yourself want to fundamentally change america. So whats your point ????
@Elk_Eater  Who said they dont like America ???????
@Elk_Eater remember, ideology has no party.
@Elk_Eater so you are saying George Wallace didnt call himself a conservative ????
@Elk_Eater So you dont think liberals believe in the American Dream ??? Why degrade your fellow Americans in that way ?
@Elk_Eater  You know who also called liberalism a disease, George Wallace.
@Elk_Eater Those Dems all called themselves conservative as did the Republicans who supported them.
@Elk_Eater so you cant think critically. You dont think anyone who is "truly" conservative can ever be wrong ?
@Elk_Eater When you argue that everything wrong with this country is because it is "liberal " then you are doing the exact same thing.
@Elk_Eater There you go again, labeling anything you disagree with as  liberal.
@Elk_Eater Again you have a right to that opinion, but your own post show you follow a similar path.
@Elk_Eater You have a right to that opinion and maybe one day you will go after republicans.
@Elk_Eater Or, i could simply disagree with you. but you seem to under the impression that only your view is truthful.
@Elk_Eater We did have computers, but that isnt how we did research, we went to the library every Wednesday.
@Elk_Eater No he wasnt, This is  another problem labeling every conservative idea that fails as liberal. u do realize ur side can be wrong?
@Elk_Eater Again, we learned to site sources in elementary school
@Elk_Eater You are arguing growth but have nothing to back it up and did not even pretend to post stats, so yes.
@Elk_Eater But as i said, FOX has the same corruption as do many right wing website like Red State, so what is your point ????
@Elk_Eater Liberal economic structure ? the greatest contributor of debt is currently the recession. No liberal involved there.
@Elk_Eater Both parties write rules and regulation. if you have a site that counts numbers we can talk about that
@Elk_Eater  How is that Corruption ? Mike Huckabee is  running for President. Gavin Newsome's ex wife is a co host on FOX.
@Elk_Eater in the entire time we have been debating, did i once call you a derogatory name or claim you didnt want freedom, nope.
@Elk_Eater See, thats the problem, instead of having a discussion on issues you choose to try and degrade me.
@Elk_Eater Conservative is an ideology as is libertarian , if you are a libertarian then you are by definition, not conservative.
@Elk_Eater PGES
@Elk_Eater and yes, we did it in elementary school.
@Elk_Eater Liberal and progressive are 2 different ideologies. Just as libertarian would never call themselves conservative.
@Elk_Eater What he said is that they hadnt come to a final agreement, not that there wasnt a plan. You have a comprehension problem,
@Elk_Eater  Im not even a progressive And you learn in elementary school to site your sources. Thats on u, not the person u are debating
@Elk_Eater If they dont allow the inspectors to inspect then they would be breaking the deal that you are talking about negating your point
@Elk_Eater see that wasnt hard now was it ? your links say the same thing, they answered some Q's but not all, but doesnt back up your claim
@Elk_Eater  You are asking me to find something that even you cant find LOL
@Elk_Eater So you cant give me a link to one of these articles that proves your point ??????????????????????????????????????????
@Elk_Eater This isnt about education, you are making an argument with nothing to back you up. maybe if you tried, more people would belive
@Elk_Eater again, prove it,
@Elk_Eater  So prove it.
@Elk_Eater are you saying Politifact is wrong ?
@Elk_Eater  Facts matter 		http://t.co/cVsGph4QGC
@Elk_Eater Your argument in calling Democrats antisemitic doesnt make sense.
@Elk_Eater  You do realize President Obama and Netenyahu have held press conferences together right ?, that he has adressed congess before
@Elk_Eater  They didnt go to the speech because the speaker invited him without ever informing the white house,thats it
@Elk_Eater If you are smart enough not to see the irqn walk out as best bigoted, you are smart enough not to see this one as the same.
@Elk_Eater  you chose to be simplistic, you have to live with it.
@Elk_Eater You think they are bigots because they didn't go to a speech but you don't think the same of walking out Iran's president ?
@Elk_Eater Wow, and the fact that she was born in Iran has what to do with this ? You do remember her and both parents are american right ?
@Elk_Eater And you do realize that there are 200+ dems in congress and only 60 stayed home. Your argument fails on all fronts
@Elk_Eater He has spoken before congress 3 times during the Obama presidency.
@Elk_Eater And 2 , the GOP did boycott mandela. Killed your own argument
@Elk_Eater 1. Bibi has spoken before congress before, you would literally be arguing that they became anti Jewish overnight to be right.
@Elk_Eater And no one walked out on Bibi because of the speech itself.
@Elk_Eater not, you made the simplistic argument, you can't change the rules now.
@Elk_Eater  so you think us walking out on Iran's Presidents UN speech was bigoted ???
@Elk_Eater the boycott wasn't over belief, it was over protocol. But do you believe any boycott is bigoted ?
@Elk_Eater  how is anything involved bigoted ?
@fishin_247  You said you would vote for Bibi, who is elected in Israel, how is your comparison even close to my statement ?
@xoLJ Im not a "fan",  I simply believe the speech was political and Republicans chose to take it and run with it.
@JBLuvsCeltic  No it doesnt.  It means by his own argument the deal is meaningless.
@JBLuvsCeltic that destroys the Prime ministers argument
@JBLuvsCeltic  I do, but you seem to be missing my point, Right now they have a reactor regardless of  sanctions and our involvement.
@xoLJ  President Obama isnt anti Israel.
@JBLuvsCeltic You realize Iran already has  nuclear reactors right, but Bibi's own logic, he should have been bombing Iran in 2009.
@JKelligesq Bibi's party is down 3 seats in the latest polls. but you can keep pretending.
@Elk_Eater  You have a right to believe that. Doesnt make you right.
@fishin_247 move to Israel and you can
@TrusMeDaddi I have no problem with them, i was simply refuting her Christianity argument. Context matters.
@xoLJ  You chose to argue Christianity, to be a Christian you have to believe in the father and the son.
#BibiSpeech was a political campaign speech, and Republicans are taking the side of a foreign leader over their own president.
@xoLJ That doesn't even make sense considering the Israelis are Jews who don't believe in Christ.
@CThursten LOL, you are right. The director did claim this was a parody, so that would have been even better.
@CThursten no, i got it, you were just wrong, he snorted coke(i assume it was coke) and in the very next scene said "its morphin time".
That Power Rangers short film was actually decent, but people will still hate it because it isnt exactly what they wanted.
@CThursten Zack said it's morphin time.
@ELLEmagazine Power Rangers has never been a cartoon, it was always live action, you shouldnt screw up something so simple.

@MCHaysRN @cmills9261  there is also the simple fact of multiple Rs calling me everything in the book up and down my timeline for that twt
@MCHaysRN @cmills9261 Never argument that but you want me to respond to something I didn't see.
@MrsO4America all of which happen before President Obama which negatives your point
Gotten like 30 responses from on my one Tween 28 negative . again, sad  #DefineDemocrat
@cmills9261 I can only go by what I see in my time line, not what you see, do you believe both are doing it and both wrong ?
@Scgator1414 Have you never once made something you love even better by adding to it ?
#DefineDemocrat this hashtag is bringing out the worst in republicans, sad you would attack fellow Americans in this way.
@deegan16 @hale_razor that's not how the word hypocrite works. You need to look it up apparently.
@deegan16 @hale_razor The war on women has nothing to do with touching some women's shoulders, so you are still wrong, keep trying.
@deegan16 @hale_razor  You also seem to not understand the definition of the word hypocrite.
@deegan16 @hale_razor they are indeed not equal, you just have it flipped.
@rjames1928 if u are going to randomly @ me,please dont block me before i can respond. You are trolling when you do it, and that is childish
I dont understand people who've never had a conversation with u, replying 2 ur tweets and then blocking u before u can respond, y troll ???
@deegan16 @hale_razor And 2nd,no they arent equal. One is arguing proper etiquette(pure opinion),the other is political bullshit attacks.
@deegan16 @hale_razor  First off, i wasnt even responding to you, so why are you foolishly attacking me as if I personally insulted you.
@deegan16 @hale_razor  How is that equal to saying someone doesnt love their country ??????
@PatrioticPigeon @YoungBLKRepub Most people are anti colonialism, What do you think Monroe Doctrine is ????
@horton_j @YoungBLKRepub  I have read it.
@hale_razor so you think touching  a womens shoulder is equal to saying the president doesnt love this country ? There is your problem folks
@NolteNC Giuliani said Barack Obama didnt love america because he didnt talk about american exceptionallism enough. thats an opinion sir.
@YoungBLKRepub  how is any of his past anti american ?
So all you republicans agreed with the guy who was on FOX Saturday morning and said it was because of high speed internet ????? #JobsForISIS

@kevinlicklider @PolitiBunny I never said it wasnt fun for you. You defeat the point of mockery if the other person doesnt care
@kevinlicklider @PolitiBunny  mockery only works if the other person actually cares.
@kevinlicklider @PolitiBunny  Sears didnt do that, its a very simple "move to forefront" application.
@PolitiBunny Are u saying u were implying he was a Republican ? instead of playing coy,why not debate with intergrety and bestraigth forward
@CplSoletrain @PolitiBunny  #UniteBlue has no problem with responsible gun ownership, your idea of them is based on misinformation
@PolitiBunny I made no assumption,i responded directly to what you typed were as u made an assumption about my ideology based on bias
@CplSoletrain @PolitiBunny  gun control has nothing to do with the ideology of the individual, im a gun owning liberal.
@PolitiBunny By the way, i would find absolutely no joy in it, nor would i attempt to make ideology a focus point of the discussion.
@PolitiBunny You dont know "my" game so letsgo by what you have actually seen me post, not what you believe i have posed based on ideology
@PolitiBunny Why does it matter which way he voted?u have said in post not 2 name him islamaphobic, but yet u are giddy at naming him a dem.

@ShawnDrurySC stand corrected on UCONN, I assumed the 2011 class was top 5, anyways, my point was that the teams that win usually are at top
@ShawnDrurySC  Not saying #1 always wins, but UConn, UK, UL,Duke, Kan, and FL all had top 5 classes when winning the title.
@ShawnDrurySC  outlier seasons dont prove your point.
@ShawnDrurySC That argument doesnt really work when Duke has more Elite 8 appearances than UVA does tournament appearances

@bamasevere I dont think anyone hates Chris Kyle they just feel his book spread fear about people of the Islamic faith.
@TibbersDebra What are you even talking about? when did I accuse anyone of assassinating anyone.You seriously need a lesson in reading comp.
@TibbersDebra  again, King Abdullah died of cancer at age 90, you are proving my point with every post.
@TibbersDebra  The stretch was including a NATURAL death that happened AFTER the speech, you failed on 2 levels there.
@TibbersDebra  As my post actually had to do with the subject matter and yours didnt.
@TibbersDebra  since the king of Saudi Arabia died of cancer at 90, that argument is fraudulent. So no, its not pot meet kettle,,,,
@TibbersDebra  the person I responded to was making an accusation of political turmoil.
@TibbersDebra  Are you incapable of staying on subject or do you just pride yourself on dodging questions you cant answer ????
@TibbersDebra It didnt ask why did it matter, I asked what does it matter in the context of my post.
@TibbersDebra  what does that have to do with anything you responded to ????
Saw American Sniper, it was good but not great, definitely over hyped by right wing media, but not at all Islamaphobic(outside of one line)
@GovernorPataki Did someone assassinate the king??? Obviously not so stop fear mongering
@EWErickson I didn't ask if you thought he has a legal right to  ask people to speak before congress. the I'm looking for a straight answer
@EWErickson  so do you believe  Speaker Boehner is wrong in what he is doing ?
@EWErickson How did he collaborate with the enemy ?
@EWErickson  so you are saying both are wrong ?
@sweetpotatertot  also, you tweeted me so blocking me is kind of moronic.Like calling someones phone just to say you aren't speaking to then
@sweetpotatertot This also has nothing to do with Saul alanskiy
@sweetpotatertot We both know being wrong and lying aren't the same thing so why are you playing coy ?
@sweetpotatertot  the word you are looking for is "wrong" as a lie is purposeful, self inflicted  and intended
@sweetpotatertot I'm not irrational, you just seem to not understand the concept of what a lie is. The word you are looking for is wrong
@sweetpotatertot  it isn't . he didn't get rid of plans, companies chose to close them our and open others.
@sweetpotatertot Calling something a lie without proving that it is one is indeed a fallacy.
@sweetpotatertot I have refuted each one even though you have no evidence to back either one up.
@sweetpotatertot No its you with the red herring moving the goal post every time you have been proven wrong
@dylan_struble  Matthews always criticizes President Obama, its not new.
RT @ppppolls: Reality check on how famous cable news makes you- Chris Matthews has 43% name rec in PA. Would trail Toomey 42/38: http://t.c‚Ä¶
RT @owillis: hahahaha, chris matthews saying obama slighted cable news, lololol whatever dude
@sweetpotatertot My responses were all rational, when you were proven wrong you moved the goal post or outright ignored it.
#IWonBothofThem destroyed republicans.
#LiberalWarMovies this is what happens when Republicans cant differentiate between subjects of war itself and islamaphobia.
@sweetpotatertot I made up nothing and denied nothing. I asked you to present facts to back up your claims and instead, you name called.
@UtraveliWork LMFAO, you are right, my bad.
@sweetpotatertot Security council votes have to be unanimous, the U.S. is on that council, so you are wrong
@sweetpotatertot Is the argument specifically about them being an ally ?
Wonder how long it'd going to take the lady I'm debating with to realize Pakistan is in a civil war and we drone the militant opposition.
@sweetpotatertot agree that by your definition every President since Truman has, not under my definition.
@sweetpotatertot By your argument every President since Truman is a murderer
@sweetpotatertot We have not declared war since 1942.  We killed 100,000 Civilians in Afghanistan. your argument is biased.
@sweetpotatertot  We didnt. I just gave you a link from the Congressional research service that shows we didnt.
@sweetpotatertot  instead of changing your argument to " we bombed a non nato ally( which i never disputed), just admit you were wrong.
@sweetpotatertot  your argument is that we had not declared war and did not have international authorization to be there.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  I doubt you will admit you were wrong
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  Here, i will help you out.	have fun learning something new		https://t.co/lPXtmDucOT
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan Your article is cute, but you seem to not know what War is, defined in US code. We did not declare war.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan You have yet to back up any of your claims.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  You can not claim we can attack Iraq and Afghanistan with out a declaration of war, but not Pakistan.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  I did no such thing. I sited the war powers act/resolution, the Constitution and your own hypocrisy
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  simply put your ideology aside and argue in good faith.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  When you saw that you were wrong you resorted to using those names instead of  admitting you were wrong.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  it is when you have not shown me to be either. You have not refuted any of my arguments.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan And again. If you actually believed in your argument, you would be attacking every President since Truman.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  He could cure cancer and you would say he put cancer researchers out of work.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan I asked you to prove me wrong, and instead you sling insults.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan And dont get me wrong.it was perfectly legal to attack all 3. War Powers act and Constitution makes that clear.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  Oh, thats right, you cant because they dont exist. Which means im right and you are wrong.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  Instead of name calling an slinging insults. Why not just post a declaration of war on Iraq and Afrganistan
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan If u aregument was about doing wrong and not just political biases, u would be against every action i mentioned
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  im not ignoring facts, you are, Iraq and Afghanistan were illegal invasions by your own word.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan Because you are singling out one president based on your own biases.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan We have not declared war since WW2, by your logic, every president has done that so you are wrong
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  Umm, we are in agreement, that is why I asked what was your point with mentioning Pakistan. Keep up.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan You are smart enough to know the difference between a declaration of war and  authorization for force
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan Authorization to use force does not equal declaration of war
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan We didnt Declare war on Iraq or Afghanistan either.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  No, that wasnt his point. His point was that no one knew of it before the leaks,
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  We should not pretend that there are not casualties in War.  Pakistan needs to stop harboring terrorist.
GO SEAHAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot No, you just want to change your argument after being proven wrong.Not going to work.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Learn more about does no equal saying he didnt know it existed, which is what you argued.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  No you didnt, you said the actual TPP was secret.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Congress did know about it. The page you posted didnt say they didnt know about it.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot No, you claimed the existence of the TPP itself was a secret. So you were wrong.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot Good attack him on transparency, i would agree there, but you are wrong about people not knowing about TPP
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  I didnt look anything up, i already knew all this and it all proves you wrong.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Negotiations for this thing started 10 years ago in 2005
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot You do realize the very article you are quoting says it was already public, your link deals in negotiations.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot They got rid of all of the ones we know about, so yes they did.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  does not change the fact that you were wrong about them getting rid of them, which you claimed didnt happen
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  the ones declared by them are actual weapons, and whether or not they have any left is your opinion and(cont)
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  the word declared has no baring on my argument or yours. So it is you who needs to try again.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Anti war means you dont go to war over false pretenses, not that you wont do it over the right reasons.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  You are very mistaken here. Care to admit you were dead wrong ?		http://t.co/sH5qVeV4eo
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  It has already been announced before Wikileaks.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot Who is debating a difference? Im just sayin he never claimed he wdnt use drones, so i asked what is your point?
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  You mean the trade agreement President Obama announced 2 years ago ???
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot How is Trans-Pac secret and nontransparent ?
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  And President Obama was never anti drones, so not sure what your point is.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot Assad gave up all his chemical weapoins that before hand he didnt even admit he had
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot Trans-Pac isnt secret, Not sure what you mean about Pakistan as we arent in that country
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot Sure, we can talk drones, Syria, Pakistan, TranPac, what about them ?
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Congress didnt cut anything, it was a continuing resolution, revenue came in almost 300B more than expected
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot 2013 fiscal budget is the last one of the Obama first term, so yes, he did cut it in half.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  failed policy means it didnt work, not that it didnt happen because Congress was against it.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan You said that, not the President. He said he will act where the Constitution allows him. Why all the semantics?
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot read what ?
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  Who knows but that isnt his failed policy, thats just something you dont like.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  umm, no. Fiscal years start in Oct of the Previous calender year. so thats actually Bush's defeict, not OBama
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Do you want him to close it, go tell your congress member to stop objecting.
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  the deficit  for the 2013 fiscal was 680 billion, that is half of 1.4 trillion, promise kept.
@sweetpotatertot @PanteraFan  you mean the NDAA a majority in congress voted for  ?????
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  Is it still open because he wants it open or because of Congress ?
@PanteraFan @sweetpotatertot  How so ?
Who's damn cell phone is that going off in the background of the Obama and Cameron press conference ?
@sweetpotatertot  My ideals and values come from world experience and practicality.
@sweetpotatertot my high school teachers and college professors were openly conservative.
@sweetpotatertot  also, that 37% is based on approval not " would vote for a Conservative", just saying.
@sweetpotatertot  we have different ideologies and beliefs in what is pratical that is why.
@sweetpotatertot  what do you mean people like me ? Ideologically liberal ?
@sweetpotatertot I will take the SCOTUS rulling in 5.5 months since neither of us is a constitutional lawyer and Obama is .
"Jay Z is 45", but his birthday is in December so why is it trending ?
@sweetpotatertot  So if the supreme Court rules in favor of President Obama in June, you will be ok with it and drop your argument ?
@sweetpotatertot  did you also know all along that obamacare was un/constitutional?
@sweetpotatertot  Actually congress passed that one, and it made them go onto the exchange.... unless you are talking about something else.
@sweetpotatertot We disagree, thats fine, i believe SCOTUS will decide it in June, then we will have our answer.
@sweetpotatertot  again, he didnt change the law, he delayed the penalty.
@sweetpotatertot  He didnt change a law,he delayed the penalty.
@sweetpotatertot  You havent given an example of these "many times"
@sweetpotatertot  Congressmen purposefully lied to their constituents and President Obama tried to ave them.
@sweetpotatertot  He changed when the penalty would go into affect because GOP told business owners not to worry about fines.
@sweetpotatertot  Im not an economist, nor will i try to pretend to be one. but QE has to do with overall policy, not just money printed.
@sweetpotatertot  What executive order are you claiming has caused the current economic status, name it.
@sweetpotatertot Everything he has done has been within the powers given to him by the Constitution of the united States of America
@sweetpotatertot  Actually what he said is that he will do what he Constitution allows him to do. He in no way declared himself king.
@sweetpotatertot In your own post, you say the economy would crash, do you want that to happen ? Would you blame Obama for it  ?
@sweetpotatertot you are talking about QE, which isnt the same as printing money, but what do you thin would happen if they stop ?
@sweetpotatertot  a recession is an economic term it has a defined definition, you may not like that definition, but it is there .
@sweetpotatertot  also, its not splitting hairs, when you say 92 million, you are including people on their death beds who cant work.
@sweetpotatertot  did he not live up to those promises because of his own fruition or because of Republican obstruction ?
@sweetpotatertot  No it doesnt with 10,000 BB retiring each day and them being more than a 3rd of the population coupled with a recession
@sweetpotatertot  So you arent going to respond to the context of my post ?
@sweetpotatertot  again, your 92 million includes everyone over 16, thats not accurate to the argument you are trying to make.
@sweetpotatertot  it then picks back up in 2009, when we were still losing jobs, They purposefully left a gap to try to hide the fact that
@sweetpotatertot  Your article leaves out a gap of 2008, the year the economy went to hell, and 7 million people lost their jobs.
@sweetpotatertot  President Obama took officer 13 months into the recession your article is talking about, do you not understand that ?
@sweetpotatertot It does not, it talks about the anniversary of the Great Society speech, it talks of none of President Obama's policies.
Republicans were not going to pick anyone running for President to respond to the SOTU speech, it would be seen as favoritism.
@sweetpotatertot Again, name the specific policy you believe is causing this and we will debate it.
@sweetpotatertot  Im saying its not an accurate number to use
@sweetpotatertot  also the 92 million you are referencing is everyone over 16 including the 109 year old grand mom and the paraplegic.
@sweetpotatertot so lets talk about the specific policy you think is causing that ?
@sweetpotatertot  What free stuff ? What Obama policy put people on welfare, lets debate an actual policy, not generalizations.
@sweetpotatertot  Show me the Obama policy you claimed is failing.
@sweetpotatertot  If it passed a Republican House of Representatives then it is their policies as well as Democrats.
@sweetpotatertot You are comparing calling someone fatherless based on the color of their skin to calling someone a GOP'er based on ideology
@sweetpotatertot Personal responsibility remember.
@sweetpotatertot  being born out of wedlock is not the same as not having your father in your life.And LBJ didnt cause any1 to be a deadbeat
@sweetpotatertot  So you are saying Conservatives in congress let him do it , great, go after them for not having a backbone.
@sweetpotatertot  Presidents dont write legislation, congress does.
@sweetpotatertot my assumption came from him calling me FATHERLESS, jobless, and on welfare based on a profile picture, you are being naive.
@sweetpotatertot  So you are ok with stereotyping people based on preconceived notions, that is sad.
@sweetpotatertot  What Policy did republicans pass in the House(that senate declined) would have helped black people ?
@sweetpotatertot The House of Representatives control the purse strings, Blaming congress is more reasonable than blaming any president.
When Cons realize they're wrong "@sweetpotatertot	@dsjj251 So b'cuse Bush also ran guns 2 Mex Cartels that justifies Obama doing it. "
@sweetpotatertot @Misterhowitis  You are calling me a kool aid drinker after agreeing i was right and retweeting a racist, that is hilarious
@sweetpotatertot Under Obama ? you do realize your party has controlled the House of Representatives for 6 years right ?
@sweetpotatertot  The 2 of us have never debated ideology or views on the worl/.government. he literally just looked at my profile pic
@sweetpotatertot  Just so you know the guy you are retweeting assumed I was fatherless, job less and on welfare because i was black.
@sweetpotatertot We werent debating justification, we were debating whether it happened or not and it did.  You now admit that.
@sweetpotatertot  have fun reading these facts		http://t.co/DFm54D1flC
@sweetpotatertot  You think Gun tracking started in 2009, that's cute.

@Misterhowitis you obviously dont know what time zones are because it isnt 2:20.
@Misterhowitis  SHow me where i said we should do that.
@Misterhowitis again show me where i said that.
@Misterhowitis How have i proven that sir, show me the post where i did. All we have debated is unemployment rates.
@Misterhowitis  Also, government is the people, we elected them.  And right now, your party has the majority.
@Misterhowitis there you go again, not putting forth any rebuttal at all.
@Misterhowitis  you have posted like 30 comments and not once have you refuted anything I said.
@Misterhowitis exactly, and they are all down, disproving your argument. You cant argue U3 for one period and U6 for another.
@Misterhowitis  The only person talking about race here is you, try again.
@Misterhowitis U6 vs U3,  do you want me to post you a link ???
@Misterhowitis "real " unemployment is what you are arguing, and that is down 4 points from when he took office, try again.
@Misterhowitis  The KKK now fully supports republicans, by your logic, i should hate republicans.
@Misterhowitis  The KK was started by people who shared a similar ideology of hating black people, not by a political party.
@Misterhowitis  Black unemplohyemnt is down 3% from when President Obama took office. I have a job.
@Misterhowitis if you believe "my"(LOL) people cant help themselves then why did you try to blame Democrats?????
@Misterhowitis I already have, and you would be wrong. fiscal =/= calender 	look that up
@Misterhowitis  Which one of those bills are you claiming would have helped "My"(LOL) people ?
@Misterhowitis 17 trillion, President Obama has been in office since the country was formed ?????????
@Misterhowitis Pretty sure this recession started when President Bush was in office, and ended half way through President Obama's first year
@Misterhowitis  Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives for 6 years.
@Misterhowitis @FoxNews apparently you do, since that is the post you chose to respond to. If you didnt care, you wouldnt be responding now
@Misterhowitis @FoxNews  You have a right to your opinion, but that has nothing to do with what i posted, which by the way, was a question.
@Misterhowitis  actually both sets of my grandparents were married and together. Another fail on your part.
@Misterhowitis @FoxNews  What does France have to do with people in the UK being mad at FOX ?????
@Misterhowitis My comment was about the United Kingdom, not the U.S Not only did you troll, you didnt even know what you were responding to.

@bmdk051007  who said anything about wanted a cop dead , and what makes them thugs;not agreeing with you ??????
@bmdk051007 @cglowka9  there something like 50 witness statements agreeing to both sides of the story.
@bmdk051007 Nope, that's only the cop's story. We will never know what actually happened.

@jax290  have a good night
@jax290  The problem isnt if he meant it, but if you understand it, which you seem not to.
@jax290  See, that is a conspiracy theory not a fact. You are trying to make a factual argument based on opinions and that isnt possible.
@jax290  When Obama says redistribution of wealth he is saying the same thing, just with  minimum wage increases.
@jax290  I never disagreed with that, but trickle down is saying the rich will give you money once they have enough.
@jax290  they are. heck F&amp;F and NSA started under BUSH.  And Republicans defended the NSA
@jax290  it would take me Hours to debunk those argument in twitter post. if you want to email me, i would be happy to.
#HighschoolTaughtMe that the nicest people have been through the worst shit.
@jax290  I didnt say it wasnt the best, it doesnt change the fact that Trickle down in still redistribution of wealth.
@jax290  Also, i just gave you 2 links to fact checking sites that prove you wrong. You obviously listened to people who lied to you
@jax290  MSNBC is left leaning, but not socialist. the rest arent even left leaning, they pretty much let everyone speak their mind on air
@jax290  here is another fact checking website for you 		http://t.co/BqXppeWhtd

@jax290  Food stamps are state programs and the amount you get differs by state, other states give much lower amounts than 1000 for 4 kids
@jax290  You say you fault both parties, but all your hatred has been aimed at Democrats. It was unwarranted
@jax290 Thats untrue, you dont make more on government assistance than on a job unless you count the cost of a fully built home.
@jax290  Those states now have the ability to weaken work requirements or strengthen them as they wish.
@jax290 NO, he did not, he gave a waiver to states to do what they wanted, and the waiver went to red states like Utah.
@jax290 But thats not government(Both Dems and Reps) fault, thats the fault of those stealing.
@jax290  Also, none of those programs do what you claim. There are many people who would die without those programs.
@jax290  Republicans support all the programs you just named.
@jax290  Robert Byrd was a KKK member, and he was wrong for being so, but Strom Thurmond was no better.
@jax290  There is no evidence that LBJ hated black people, the quotes Republicans use about him are all rumors,
@jax290  How do you believe Democrats do that ?
@jax290  You have a right to your opinion, but i disagree, I believe both parties work for a goal of unity from different positions.
@jax290 Jessie Jackson has nothing to do with anything we have posted to this point.
@jax290  You have a right to your opinion, but so do we. I am not a socialist.
@jax290 Using the word plantation is nothing but race baiting. If you have an argument, then put it forth, but just using a word isnt one.
@jax290  The Democrats of 2014 are not the same as Democrats in 1860.
@kimmie99 @LeahR77 What exactly would I learn from him other than why he is a republican ?
@kimmie99 @LeahR77  I see all you can do is throw insults
@kimmie99 @LeahR77 No I asked you to disprove me, which was your objective in the first place and our failed.
@kimmie99 @jax290 @elisamich0422 @LeahR77 What are you talking about ? Your last post didn't make sense. I think a word or 2 it cut off
@kimmie99 @LeahR77 Then the majority in the south would still be democrats , but they aren't
@kimmie99 @LeahR77  not really seeing your point since that doesn't refute my point.
@kimmie99 @LeahR77  so prove me wrong then
@kimmie99 @jax290 @elisamich0422 @LeahR77 		And then we became democrats , just as a majority of the south were once Democrats.
@kimmie99 @LeahR77 And the current kkk endorses republicans negating your point all together.
@kimmie99 @LeahR77  conservative is an ideology. Democratic is a party. The 2 crossed paths at one point you know ?
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  oh, I get it. You are a troll.
I will unblock misguided conservative at 8 am
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  yep, after you have lost an argument, its always nice to degrade another person.
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  in this conversation you disproved your owe argument and When proven wrong said it didnt matter,but I'm the dumb 1?
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77 If you want to continue this convo, reply after 8 am
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77 " it doesn't matter" , now that you realize you are wrong, it no longer matters, lol. I'm really going to be now
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  dems as a majority were not liberals in the 1800s when the kkk was formed. Do you not understand that ???
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77 again show me the ones that I identified as liberals and you will have a point.
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  find the ones that defined themselves as liberal and then you will have a point
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77 And its 3am dude.
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77 did Strom Thurman not die a republican ?????
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  im going to bed, you 2 have fun.
@RtWngXtremist  ideological shift and power. Southerns are conservative and they thought Dems were becoming to liberal.
@LeahR77 @RtWngXtremist You do realize neither of those quotes have been substantiated right ? and the second one actually proves your wrong
@RtWngXtremist Nope. Norther Democrats and Northern Republicans supported Civil rights(google voting record) Southern parties both opposed.
@RtWngXtremist  I know what im talking about, you are the one who contradicted your own argument .
@RtWngXtremist Again, i didnt call anyone racist. Why the attempt to put words in my mouth ????
@RtWngXtremist  I knew what you meant, im not the grammar police
@RtWngXtremist gradually over about a 30 year period, atleast in the South that is.
@LeahR77 Are you having fun retweeting all these flawed tweets ?
@RtWngXtremist I never said anyone was racist in my post, so try again. All i said was a party switch happened. try again
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  Its racist to simply say racism exist ?????
@RtWngXtremist  I think you forgot your own argument LOL
@RtWngXtremist Your argument doesnt even make sense, first you claim there was no party switch, now you admit the entire south flipped
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  Every party targets based on ideas, thats the definition of "Ideology", but you are wrong on race.
@RtWngXtremist You should probably go to wikipedia and see Who controlled the SOuth up until the 1990's/early 2000s. It was Dems.
Not sure if Conservatives think Pakistan is a city in Afghanistan or if they r just confusing the 2 countries all together as they blame BO
@RtWngXtremist @LeahR77  Those men called themselves conservatives, not liberals. try again.
@Im_bonafide Your article argues support, not origin and now the KKK fully supports republicans, So your argument is flawed on all levels.
@LeahR77  Last but not least, a political party did not start the KKK, individuals did.
@LeahR77  Also , your argument was about liberals, not Dems, Dems in the late 1800's/early1900 were not liberals. Ideology switched parties
@LeahR77 so you are claimign all of academia, the media etc want to kill NRA Member children ???
@LeahR77  A couple of morons on the internet do not define all liberals no more than the KKK defines all conservatives.

@Wolfknight74 @CoFemale You continue to beleive that, im going to bed.
@CoFemale Bush's exact words was that he had them, not just the capacity. And President Bush admitted he was wrong.
You conservatives have a good night
@CoFemale We separated the 2, calling nukes by the phrase WMDs and specifically calling Chemical weapons as such.
@CoFemale @Wolfknight74  if your argument is that WMD's meant Chemical, then that means Bush lied in 2006. Thats your logic, not mine
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers You dont need a question mark to answer that question.
@CoFemale False argument on your part. I never said they didnt have chemical weapons.
@Wolfknight74 @CoFemale So he either lied in 2006, Or the military lied to him about finding weapons in 2004. Which is it
@Wolfknight74 @Bwana86 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers #4. You are nitpicking instead of actually answering the question.
@Wolfknight74 @Bwana86 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers 1. typing fast 2. rewrite because of limited characters 3.you still knew what it meant
@CoFemale and Bush defined WMDs as Nukes, not Chemical weapons, but either way, you would still be wrong.
@CoFemale the article in NYT says the US army found them in 2004, my video of Bush is from 2006.
@CoFemale  Is this a parody account or do you honestly not remember what you typed ???
@CoFemale " WMDs were NOT FOUND in Iraq. Not that they never had them. "		So you agree with both the President and I, so where is the spin?
Sot he Republican/Conservative theory is that either Bush lied about WMD's in 2006 or the Army lied to him about WMD's from 2004 to 2009
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers So i need a simple ues or no to you. Are you saying the military lied to him about finding weapons
RT @TheMaverick21: Hold on..  @dsjj251 @Wolfknight74 @EvanDMyers http://t.co/t8NeltoF55
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers No it isnt, i was simply guessing as to what you could mean by your statement.
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  LOL. its more likely that he simply meant WMD=Nukes, there for, he admitted they had no nukes.
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers again. thats not my theory, I was simply trying to guess what you meant.
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers Not my theory, i was just guessing yours.
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  We are getting deep into conspiracy theory here. Why would the army Sabotage a president ?
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers So you are saying the Army hid the fact that we found "WMDs" from Pres.Bush for 2 years ????
@Wolfknight74 the nukes werent there. Thats what he was labeling WMDs
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers LMFAO, for 2 years ?????????		remember the article says they started finding them in 2004.
People should stop complaining about Amber Alerts, you have to power to turn it off if you dont care, but it could be your kid one day.

@CoFemale @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  So again, Bush was lying here ???		https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers The "Bush meant" part is the qualifier. As I pointed out. in 2006, Bush said he was wrong. Your move.
@Wolfknight74 @TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers This is why i let the man speak for himself 		https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ
@HaugenTRA so the article says they were found in 2004, the link i gave you was from 2006. if he defined them as WMDS, then he lied in 2006.
@DEMAGOGSSUCK @TheMaverick21 @alilovestexas @EvanDMyers @HillaryClinton @BarackObama  So President Bush lied too ???https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ
Some people are so simple minded that it isnt even funny.
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  Im a liar because your own post destroyed your argument LOL, ok.
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  in all of your links except one, the congressmen themselves differentiate between the 2
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers I said he did not refer to them as WMD, he did not he was talking about Nukes and he admitted he was wrong.
@HaugenTRA im not arguing if he mentioned them in the same sentence. He did  differentiate them. And admitted there were no nukes.
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers And this one says Nuclear Capacity as well.		You are 1 for 9
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  I think this is the first one that doesnt say "And Nuclear weapons/programs"	congrats, you went 1 for 8
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  Another Post that includes the words " And Nuclear " ???
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers  Does your post not say " AND NUCLEAR PROGRAM"  ?????
@HaugenTRA my point went over your head. People make the distinction because they are viewed differently, Bush did just that.
@HaugenTRA We are talking about what HE said remember, not what you believe. and since i cant read minds, i can only go by his word.
@sunnyright Statement ? my very first response to you was a video of him saying he was wrong.
@HaugenTRA If u call 1 a chemical weapon and call the other WMD,then yes, u separated them, like when people say Drugs &amp; alcohol
@sunnyright So Bush was wrong about being wrong , thats what you are saying ???
@HaugenTRA As already stated, he separated the 2 for a reason
@sunnyright As I stated, he separated the 2 and admitted being wrong on the later.
@HaugenTRA @EvanDMyers  As you just stated, he separated the 2. You really think we would have invaded iraq based on Chemical weapons alone
@sunnyright Which does not change my point that President Bush specifically defined it as nuclear and admitted 2 the world that he was wrong
@TheMaverick21 @EvanDMyers SO President Bush himself was lying about being wrong ? https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ
@sunnyright The President himself defined them as such, If not , why else would he admit he was wrong on national TV ????
@HaugenTRA At best, your argument should be that Pres,GWB defined it to narrowly
@HaugenTRA @EvanDMyers Its not a ridiculous narrative. President Bush defined specifically what he was talking about in 2003.
@EvanDMyers Umm, 1. President Bush signed the Status of Forces agreement.		2. I gave you a video  link to him admitting he was wrong.
You can lead a horse to a video showing showing President Bush admitting he was wrong, but you cant make them watch it LOL.
@EvanDMyers Chemical weapons were are not WMD's. Bush meant nuclear weapons.
@GayPatriot im Butt Hurt by posting a video of the President admitting he was wrong ????
@EvanDMyers So President Bush said in plain words " we were wrong" and you still toss it aside ?
@GayPatriot @OxonGooner  So Bush lied ???		https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ
@EvanDMyers https://t.co/gn1lEMereZ

@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth No, its not. You not liking it doesnt change whether it happened or not.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  but its not a bad example, because we are debating the distraction itself, not your feeling about it.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  Thats a horrible argument on your part because regardless of how you feel, It was a media firestorm
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  You are arguing that vick is a bad example only because you dont care about dogs over humans.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  Again, we arent arguing your opinion of the incident. Only that it was a distraction and Dungy took it on.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  No one is claiming it trumps people problems. But the media did cover it and it was a distraction.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  but again, we are arguing the distraction, was Vick not a distraction, did the media not cover him ???
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth The argument is the level of media scrutiny, regardless  of if you agree with that scrutiny, it happened.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth You think fighting animals for your own enjoyment and then killing them(if they dont die in the fight) is ok
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  Further more, why does "first" box need to be checked ???? The argument is the distraction, not the "first"
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  if this is about novel first, then the Vick argument is definitely in play.
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth  Dungy has had players arrested for beating their wives
@TheFeministGOP @KhannaOnHealth Good NFL arrest records, it will give you a list of his players and what they went to jail for.

@gopthinking @Napps @RonHall46  Based on your post, you didnt actually know what tea bagging was, instead of admitting that, you project.
@gopthinking @Napps @RonHall46 To argue that is a homosexual act is to argue that only homosexuals can do it, you are wrong.

@DJSPINtel You are proving my point. They dont have to opt in for ever and the federal government is paying for the expansion
@DJSPINtel Nope, you have already proven you dont even know the basics of the law.

@DJSPINtel Its expansion being hindered by those who preach that it is morally wrong is indeed religious.
@DJSPINtel Again, your philosophy and you have a right to have it, but off subject.
@DJSPINtel  You seem to be operating under the assumption that if a bill does not include the word GOd then it isnt religious, you are wrong
@DJSPINtel Your argument that medicaid is public policy and there for not religious is a fallacy. One does not negate the other.
@DJSPINtel Not at all, The supreme court strikes down those laws, whether on a state or national level.
@DJSPINtel Thats your opinion and you are free to have it, but you are changing the subject, stay on topic.
@DJSPINtel If said bill passes, then it is. Are you saying no religious bill has ever been passed into law????The Supreme court disagrees
@DJSPINtel So you are now admitting you were wrong ? and are you saying there is something wrong with Democracy ?
@DJSPINtel Are you telling me that you have never heard a conservative politician say they support this bill because of their religion ?
@DJSPINtel I did not say it was a religion, I said law makers are against it and legislate new laws on them based on religion.
@DJSPINtel Actually in my community the city and police department try to make church part of punishment. Again, i could go on.
@DJSPINtel They are both indeed religious as that is the argument Republican politicians are using for why they bring up that legislation
@DJSPINtel Already responded.
@DJSPINtel So you are now pretending that Abortion laws being past are religion based, not expanding medicaid here in my state ???
@DJSPINtel And even if i had mentioned the state, it wouldnt be a false narrative.
@DJSPINtel Since I didnt mention the state, are you the one with the false narrative ?

@DonnyLateNight @Rockprincess818  As my link shows they are a very small minority not being more than 10% in any poll.
@FirebaughNorman  You only believe it because you disagree with them.
@FirebaughNorman But your argument is that their belief influences their scientific conclusion, you have no proof of that.
@joesbooks LOL, you said not being able to explain something meant there was no proof it is happening. I countered with something simple.
@Kimmyincali  You think it is vilification to ask companiesand individuals to pay the same tax rates they did in 1999 ?
@FirebaughNorman Who is "he", you havent said a name in your post yet.
@FirebaughNorman so you agree some regulation is needed ?
@BigBlue1180 I already told you that my politics are separate from charity also, alabama doesnt have party registration.
@Kimmyincali  I never said he did, but if oil production overall is up, what is your point???		no the EPA didnt kill coal free market did
@Rockprincess818  thousands of men with years of experience says it is happening are you saying you know more than them ?
@FirebaughNorman So you are saying the government paid these scientist ?
@Kimmyincali so more name calling, instead of a discussion, thats fine, have a good day.
@FirebaughNorman What scientist and when did he prove it wrong ?
@BigBlue1180  So no real discussion here, just name calling and rhetoric, got it.
@Kimmyincali That would be the Eu's policies.
@FirebaughNorman @Rockprincess818 @UniteRight @Kimmyincali  are you saying all regulations are unconstitutional  ?
@Kimmyincali Oil drilling regardless of location has continued to rise, BO didnt kill Coal, the free market did.
@joesbooks I can not explain how energy gets to my house from a power plant, does that mean it isnt there when i turn on the light ?

@UniteRight @zanEcho @Kimmyincali   Food stamp jokes, nice. Good thing i have never gotten any.
@Rockprincess818 @UniteRight @Kimmyincali  So regulations do need to be rolled back and laws repealed, but im sure we disagree on which ones
@Kimmyincali @UniteRight If you are going to argue U6 or U3, you need to argue it from 2009 as well, so yes it is down.
@Rockprincess818 @UniteRight @Kimmyincali  and yet, You only claim the Country started falling apart in 2009.
@UniteRight @Kimmyincali So wait you are blaming Democrats when Republicans had control of the House Senate and Presidency ?????? Im done.

@UniteRight @Kimmyincali  So president Obama controlled the 2009 Budget, the one that started in  October of 2008 before he was elected ?
@Kimmyincali @UniteRight  How exactly has he moved the debt clock at warp speed tell me, what was debt at 4 his first budget as President?
@Kimmyincali @UniteRight Low job performance only from your ideological perch.
@Kimmyincali @UniteRight  You have your system of beliefs, thats fine, i have mine.
If you are going to block me dont mention me in your tweets
@UniteRight  President's dont balance budgets, If it happens, it would be congress that does it.
Someone didnt realize they were being called a RINO and retweeted LOL!!
@UniteRight Idid not deny that Democrats had not balanced it either, but im not running on it or using it as a talking point like you are.
@UniteRight  Again, you have had 60 years and not a single balanced budget since Ike.
@Kimmyincali @UniteRight  Your argument is that the President of the United States should not be admired, that makes no sense.
@UniteRight didnt avoid it at all, I just wanted an answer to the question I posed to you.
@UniteRight So you are saying Republicans abandoned Balanced Budgets for 60 years ?
@UniteRight So, you cant tell me the last one ?

@haleynwallace You still have that freedom. You can choose to pay the fine. Any other Freedoms ?
@BigRedCheetah So you are saying the economy is booming ? wow, we need more Republicans to say that.
@haleynwallace  You are entitled to your opinion, but alot of use out there disagree. What Freedoms have you lost under this President ?
@BigRedCheetah The economy was already booming,You called the president a liar based on your own lack of knowledge
@BigRedCheetah  Republicans lost seats in the House of Representatives
@haleynwallace Or Maybe Republicans are just that stubborn ?
@BigRedCheetah Any other day, Republicans would be saying the Dow is not indicative of the over all economy
@mike_cluff Great Leaders place blame where itis due, and Republicans own it, dont be so asinine yourself.

@BSull106 http://t.co/bOkAxCRuTn	again, very easy to prove you wrong.

@lshiry you can call me what ever you want but you still havent proven me wrong.
@lshiry  LPR is not the same as "Number of people in the labor force", you are making 2 different arguments.
@AngieinWAState @lshiry  yes ma'am.
@lshiry @AngieinWAState You are so anti Obama that you will believe anything, that is sad.no, i take it back, that is beyond sad.
@lshiry @AngieinWAState Dude you just linked to a blog , I gave you BLS data from the BLS themselves, you cant be serious
@lshiry @AngieinWAState Where are you getting your info from &gt;
@lshiry @AngieinWAState Again, if you can show where you proved me wrong, why not just repost the link in your next tweet.
@lshiry @AngieinWAState Odds are, you will just respond by saying the government lies, either way, im done for a while.  good night.

@shemararae @Maggyw519 So you are admitting the GOP is divisive ?
@lshiry @AngieinWAState It was President Obama who reorganized the task force to find him.
@shemararae @Maggyw519 So then why do you not call those whites slaves ?
@shemararae @Maggyw519 @EileenHart1 Ghettoes are communities, not poverty guide lines, or did you think all poor people lived in ghettoes ?
@lshiry @AngieinWAState President Bush shut down the task force that was looking for Bin Laden, so without President Obama, he wouldbe alive
@shemararae @Maggyw519 You are falling for the divisive nature of the GOP, dont let yourself be fooled.
@shemararae @Maggyw519 @EileenHart1 There are more whites on welfare than blacks most people on welfare live in red districts
@lshiry @AngieinWAState He has done many good things
@Maggyw519 The Republican definition of well known is anything that has ever been mentioned on a Right wing site.
@shemararae @Maggyw519 @EileenHart1  they would be greatful and vote Democratic, and they have.
@shemararae @Maggyw519 @EileenHart1  By the way, he wasnt sayign he was conning black people, he was saying his programs helped blacks
@shemararae Reread your comment, you may have just worded it wrong, but in its current state, you said "he voted"
@SecolaEdwards @YDanasmithdutra Thank you when i went to my ADM intern training, they said always be nice even when people are dead wrong.
@lshiry  What are you defining as a Waiver. Thats the easiest way to get to my point, what are YOU defining as a waiver ?
@YDanasmithdutra @SecolaEdwards Just got home from work, give me a minute to catch up to all these tweets LOL.
i really wish i could be apart of this debate on my twitter page, but im at work.
Explain to me how you can call something an exemption when it says they have to do it ?
@BestWriterExtra  Also, it isnt superior knowledge, i have yet to see you say the same to white liberals. That means it is indeed race based
@BestWriterExtra  You asked how today is different Did you see any Dems in white cloacks today ?
@BestWriterExtra The KKK had members from all sides of the political spectrum.
when people race bait rather than debate "@BestWriterExtra Supports white guilt, works on an Alabama cotton plantation: @dsjj251 #caring "
@BestWriterExtra  LOL ok then.
@BestWriterExtra by your same logic you are on a plantation.
@BestWriterExtra I wasnt alive during slavery so that comment makes no sense. Just because i believe diff doesnt mean im on a plantation.
Ugh, Since i have to work thismorning, im going to miss the Alabama vs Texas AM game @rolandsmartin  should keep me updated though. LOL #RTR
@YDanasmithdutra @SecolaEdwards Thanks at one point i was responding to like 10 people at once so it took some strength
@caroletalk @BestWriterExtra @HarrietBaldwin @conservativeJT @BSull106 @edshow   you cant prove your point so you use racial rhetotic
@BestWriterExtra @HarrietBaldwin @conservativeJT @BSull106 @edshow  so you admit you cant prove what you claim.
@SecolaEdwards @YDanasmithdutra  I am used to it. When people disagree, their first response is not to disprove but to call me "lazy"
@lshiry So why not just show me the tweet that proved me wrong anyways ?

@BlazerTalon @HarrietBaldwin That is obviously not true, but your friends keep saying it is.
@BlazerTalon @HarrietBaldwin The argument from your fellow posters is tha congressmen and their aides do not have to purchaces healthcare
@shemararae The first 2 black senators were republicans and died Democrats.
@conservativeJT @HarrietBaldwin so you are calling it an exemption to keep the healthcare you already have ? am i reading your right ?
@lshiry @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106 @edshow  please show me the tweet where you proved me wrog.
@lshiry @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106 @edshow so jusy prove ne wrong.
Ok, im going to work now.
@jensan1332 yoru original comment is about population, not apportionment. You were wrong.
@jensan1332 do you not understand what proportional means ? California's population grew in the last 10 years, you were wrong.
@shemararae Both the black men Republicans voted in died Democrats and attacked the Republican party.
@BlazerTalon are debating. Your friends claimed congress was exempt they are not and never have been.
@BlazerTalon So you mean they added good things great. Did they add a part saying Congress didnt have to by health care, nope. thats what we
@shemararae The majority is 152 Democrats for it, 152 looks like more than 96 now does it.
@jensan1332 @WSJ  Again, you could just read the cenus, but you would rather read spin i see 	http://t.co/0hJVTfkPII
@jensan1332  House apportionment are proportional. California grew by3 million in between censuses.
@jensan1332 I did not mention NY in my post. YOU did, and in the post i responded to you mentioned CA, keep your tweets straight.
@shemararae Jessie Helms never switched parties, George Wallace ? hell Jeff Session use to be a Democrat. they indeed switched parties.
@BlazerTalon I dont remember any amendments to the law since then do you ?
@jensan1332  Funny you mention that seeing as those jobs are in Dallas, Austin and Houston, which are run by Democrats.
@jensan1332 California just grew by like half a million last year, what are you talking about ?
@shemararae It takes 10 seconds to google the roll call vote for the 1964 Civil rights act. 		http://t.co/GrNEmwZj1k 		but i need the lesson
@shemararae  Yes, just like that. I have no illusions that Democrats said racist things,doesnt change that your arguemnt is  flawed.
@jensan1332 So explain to me hwo prices and inflation have rises more than wages have in the last 60 years.
Am i in secret twitter jail or are right wingers just ignoring my responses ?
@jensan1332 cost in NYC and the rest of the state r completely different, cost are going to be more when 8 million live on top of each other
@jensan1332 http://t.co/GJiTt7Siof		as i said, bad argument on your part.
@jensan1332 Because NY taxes the hell out of cigaretts. it cost more to live in NY in general though, so that is a bad argument.
@shemararae @EileenHart1 We had 2 Republican congressmen refer 2 Hispanics as wetback Are you really arguing that racism is only on one side
@shemararae @EileenHart1  Civil rights and jim crow were not a left vs right issue, they were North vs South issures
@shemararae @EileenHart1  every southern Republican in the senate and a majority of Southern R's in the house voted against it
@shemararae @EileenHart1  Democrats as a majority voted for the civil rights act of 1964.
@EileenHart1 Again, i gave you link 3 times and you are the one being nasty and LOL @ elitist ? what did i say that was elitist ?
@jensan1332  That is not true. mind backing up your claims ?

@EileenHart1 @HarrietBaldwin http://t.co/lbMwkpGKfk		this is the 3rd time i have linked you this article. You are so pissed you're wrong LOL
@EileenHart1 @HarrietBaldwin @marklevinshow @Betsy_McCaughey The only thing i said was that you proved yourself wrong. How is that nasty ?
@EileenHart1 @HarrietBaldwin @marklevinshow @Betsy_McCaughey You were the one who got nasty. to this point i still havent.
@EileenHart1 Again I already linked to Betsy's article it proves you wrong.
@EileenHart1 @HarrietBaldwin Again, i already linked  Betsy's artile  to you a while ago , what is your problem.
I have been typing Your for youre for a while now. i wonder how long it will take right wingers to grammar police me LOL
@xTartanforeverx If you had read it, we wouldnt be arguing about this now
@xTartanforeverx LOL, that is good, but you are again perpetuating a lie that says they are exempt they are not. It is in the law,
@EileenHart1 I linked the article to you like 5 minutes ago. Are you ok ?
@EileenHart1 How is that being nasty ? and how can you tell me to go find the link while responding to a tweet with the link in it ?????
@EileenHart1 again, thanks for proving my point with your own link.
@EileenHart1 LMFAO i just linked you that article she clearly says they have to buy healthcare, yet she is still using the word exempt,
@EileenHart1 from her own mouth(or hands)  http://t.co/lbMwkpGKfk		. Thank you for finding your own source that proves your wrong.
@HarrietBaldwin And you should read one of Ezra Klien's aricles free from the Washington Post.
Why is crossfire only 30 minutes ?
@xTartanforeverx You wouldnt be saying the lie if you read the law.
@xTartanforeverx You are continuing to perpetuate a lie and your excuse is that i linked you the law from the HHS home page.
@xTartanforeverx So again, you are debating something without ever having read the source material ?
@EileenHart1 Because a party did neither just as Jessie Helms died a Republican who still advocated for Segreagation.
@EileenHart1 the Organ Doner rules have been in place for decades, you are again perpetuating a lie.
@EileenHart1 again no it did. 		http://t.co/TNpYtLxF5V		You are perpetuating a lie and you choose to continue.
@EileenHart1 @BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow  Show me where it exempts them from the law.
@EileenHart1 You need to read the law the same as the other peolple i responded to http://t.co/mYnndIE7K1
@xTartanforeverx Youa re arguing about a bill that you have never read.
@xTartanforeverx We arent talking about life experience, we are talking about if something is true or not and you refuse to read the source
@EileenHart1 im not brainwashed, we just disagree.
@EileenHart1 @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106 @edshow you are serious ? LOL
@xTartanforeverx You said you didnt believe the text of the law because it came from the HHS. You are now showin your own ignorance, im done
@HarrietBaldwin @jensan1332 Real UE is 14.7% but it was 17.9 when he took office either way, your argument is flawed. Had this convo before.

@HarrietBaldwin but LOL that you think right wing sites are credible. Partisanship at its best.

@xTartanforeverx @BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow stop perpetuating a lie 		http://t.co/TNpYtLxF5V
@conservativeJT @HarrietBaldwin my bet is when this convo is over you will still say it is true in all of your tweets about it.
@conservativeJT @HarrietBaldwin You and the people i have been responding to are perpetuating a lie and now you know it is a lie but.....

@jensan1332 We always ahve a record level of people on food stamps. next .
@HarrietBaldwin @conservativeJT @BSull106 @edshow yet you cant debunk the words in the law or the link i gave. smdh.
@conservativeJT @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106 @edshow  I just posted a link to the law and a plain word explantion, debunk me if you can then.
@ruskaj @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106If that is the problem, then say it, but what the other person was saying was a right wing lie.
@jensan1332 Labor force participation was predcted to fall decades ago, Baby boomers are retiring, they are the 2nd largest segment of pop.

when Republicans cant win an argument, they blok you and run LOL

@jensan1332 They do not. But im glad you atleast admit you were wrong.
@jensan1332 @ShareThis As i already explained they are not exemptiong themselves.
@jensan1332 @ShareThis So where is your proof that Full time outweighed part time years ago ?

@HarrietBaldwin @lshiry @BSull106 @edshow  How about you read		http://t.co/mYnndIE7K1
@jensan1332 @ShareThis More productive workers make less mistakes and sale produced better.
@jensan1332 the FED is not part of the government.
@jensan1332 @ShareThis Workers are consumers or did you think consumers didnt have to work to get the money they spent ?
@jensan1332 @ShareThis most of the jobs created every year are part time. show me one year where they werent? i will wait.
@jensan1332 @ShareThis Government doesnt print money either. More productive workers = higher profit margins.
@lshiry @HarrietBaldwin @BSull106 @edshow  No they arent, I just explained why your argument is wrong, read it and read the law.
@jensan1332 @ShareThis The majority of Businesses have not cut hours, you are making a 1% argument as the rule for the other 99%
@BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow can they can now continue with the healthcare of their employer. it isnt an exemption, never was.
@BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow enter into the exchanges instead of buying insurance from their employers, the new part passed says ......
@BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow The thing people keep calling an exemption is not an exemption.The original law says staffers have to....
@BSull106 @HarrietBaldwin @edshow  Because you are wrong and congress and their staffers did adopt Obamacare
@jensan1332 @ShareThis  They didnt reject Obamacare, they rejected Businesses that took advantage of it.
@VanJones68 is making a great argument and you know what the response from @secupp  and @wolfblitzer is "Politics and optics" LOL

@Category0ne You mad ?
@Category0ne You are now making an argument based on a blog, why are you not quoting the NPR article ??? OH, because it disagrees
@Category0ne Never admitted that because what you are claiming is untrue.
@Category0ne It says to spy on Americans, they need a FISA warrant, come again ?
@Category0ne yes, but only when i choose to.
@Category0ne The problem with posting 6 links like you did ist hat 5 disagree with your blog LOL
@Category0ne Its my opinion that Obama is none of those think, its a FACT, that is disagree with you.
@Category0ne Snowden ?? He is PRISM,which is metadata, not wiretapping. and from 2007
@Category0ne No it doesnt. the law says they can spy on foreigners in the US, not American citizens.
@Category0ne No it inst. You are in fact wrong because i dont see President Obama as any of those things.
@Category0ne  LOL, you were wrong, the law doesnt allow them to spy on Americans.
@Category0ne everything you just said is your opinion, not mine so there for, you are wrong.
@Category0ne President of the united states, but he is a failed politician ??? Also how am i a parasite, im waiting ......
@Category0ne So no, it isnt being used to spy on Americans.
@Category0ne Again, just prove he is using it, Also, did it not say "does not apply to Americans" ???
@Category0ne  I am neither, you are just a fake libertarian. Real one go after the ones who write horrible laws.
@Category0ne Your argument again, is based on information you admit you can not obtain, you are guessing.
@Category0ne  Also, It took a majoirty in congress for it to pass, they day you go after all of them is the day you can call me a sell out.
@Category0ne You have proof he is using it ? No, so in your own words "Epic fail"
@Category0ne If you want to say he should have not extended it, thats fine, but you went farther than that and tried to claim continued use.
@Category0ne You have no argument if you are basing your analysis on something you cant even prove.
@Category0ne If the law isnt being used, then you have no argument. Look at Federal Weed laws, now look at AG Holder's statement today
@Category0ne Your argument isnt that he extended it though, your argument is that he is using it and there is no evidence of such.
Keith Olbermann is back on ESPN !!!!
@Obomination1 So you are admitting that you cant prove your point. thanks.
@Category0ne Your last paragraph never claims President Obama used warrantless wiretapping though, your argument is flawed.
@Category0ne doesnt make it warrantless. Your ACLU article clearly states that they have warrants, regardless of the title they use.
@Category0ne  do i need to continue to define the word warrantless to you again ? you not liking where the warrant came from ...
@Category0ne How can it be "warrantless" if you are pissed at the FISA court for giving them the warrant ???
@Category0ne agian, read your link , they are talking about the way they get the warrant(from FISA)
@Obomination1 You said that we cant know if there is fraud without ID, yet there being fraud is the basis of your argument.
@Category0ne  the word warrantless only appears in reference to President Bush, BEFORE FISA, not after. seriously read your own source
@Category0ne  excuse me, redefine the word warrantless. You not liking the way the warrents are obtained is not the same as not having it.
@Category0ne  not a single one of your links back up your claim unless youre define the word wiretapping.
@Obomination1 you just destroyed your own argument. LMFAO ROTF
@Category0ne no where in it does it allow warrant less wiretapes
@Obomination1  or do you just not care ? There is also no voter fraud, so why the uneeded expense in the first place ?
@Obomination1  people have done studies on this that show how many citizens are screwed by this . Are you claiming the studies are lying ?
@Obomination1 No it doesnt and not all old people have it. Youa re making an inclusive argument based on a small percentage.
@Category0ne There have not been any warrantless wiretaps and FISa courts answer the other part of your argument.
@Obomination1 But you dont care, You just want your side to win rather than insure the rights of every american.
@Obomination1 Most older people are actually grandfathered in, there are countless stories of people who are screwed by these new laws...
@Obomination1  What does SS, Medicare or Foodstamps have to do with this conversation ?
@Obomination1 Most states have a State ID they offer to none drivers. It cost about the same, why do you want to charge people to vote ?
@Category0ne The size has changed, the use has not, there has been no expansion.
@funlibertarian @Category0ne i mean the program itself, not simply the size. The Program still does the same things as 6 years ago
@funlibertarian  changing it.
@funlibertarian Your initial argument was that he could stop it if he wanted to, which was untrue. not simply that he doesnt talk about...
@Obomination1  And older people who do none of the things you just mentioned do not have ID's, nor do people who use public transportation.
@Obomination1 In many of the states, the Voter ID's are not Drivers licences, but a separate state ID
@funlibertarian @Category0ne The Patriot had to be reauthorized by congress before it could land on his desk, which way did your C-man vote?
@funlibertarian @Category0ne  Companies have been added, not an expansion of the program itself.President Bush is very proud of his creation
@funlibertarian Your profile self identifies you as a comic, i should not have expected a serious discussion void of twisting words.
@funlibertarian I never said i thought he wanted to stop it, nor did i claim i was ok with it.
@funlibertarian He shouldnt have to go to congress, You are their constituent, not him , they should be listening to your opinion.
@funlibertarian  the very first point in your link says CONGRESS
@funlibertarian Your premise is false, he never made such a claim.
@funlibertarian an executive order can not stop a law only change policy.
If @kendricklamar held voter registration drives at his concerts ...........
@funlibertarian I never claimed he did, but you did claim he could just stop it which is untrue, stay on topic.
@funlibertarian  the NSA data collection is law, not policy , there for he can not just stop it as you claim. It takes an act of congress.
@funlibertarian No, he doesnt have that power, that is the problem with your argument.

@USAF_DBW @ejayharris38 @stacihogan Liberal groups where audited as well, there just wasnt a list of liberal possible group names
@USAF_DBW @ejayharris38 @stacihogan  What do you mean own it,there was nothing wrong with it, the argument is literally over the list itself
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan  You cant be cause none of them do. F&amp;F guns where found at the scene but the weapon he was killed with was not 1.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan  find one article from a credible source that says he was.
@USAF_DBW @ejayharris38 @stacihogan  and no , they didnt all get approved.
@USAF_DBW @ejayharris38 @stacihogan  there were less liberal groups because con groups make up 85% of all applicants.
Isnt it funny how when people cant back up their right wing arguments, they immediately start calling you names or using generalizations.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan generalizations usually come from those who cant back up their claims.
@CapitaLiszt @ejayharris38 @stacihogan  Read your articles before you post it, He didnt recant.
@USAF_DBW @ejayharris38 @stacihogan The IRS admitted to creating a list of key words, they audited Liberal groups as well.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan Brian Terry was not killed by an F&amp;F gun.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan the government did not sell a single weapon.
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 They didnt give anyone anything, F&amp;F was a gun tracking operation.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan Just believe the first right wing blog you come to.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan  I understand you 2 are conservative and i will never change your mind, but atleast do your own research and not..
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan None of those things are criminal just things you disagree with, some are out right lies and conspiracies
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 It seems the only thing you know is that the cartels got guns that were part of F&amp;F
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 The government did no sale guns to the Mexican drug cartels. Did you actually read what F&amp;F was because.....
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan  none of those are laws he broke but rather things conservatives disagree with on an ideological level.
#WhyBidenWouldBeBetterThanHillary		They would be equally great and continue the economic growth started by President Obama.
I understand conservatives attack anything left of center, but at some point we are going to have to debate reality and not generalizations.

@ejayharris38 @stacihogan He did not lie under oath, so can you site something that actually happened.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan investigated? i remember them bring'g him up on contempt charges,but not an investigation,n he wasnt found guilty
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan So why dont you name the law he broke ?
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 That is good for you, sadly there are people who do not.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan and let me go ahead and respond, yes i am knit picking gun running has a set definition and by it, F&amp;F isnt it.
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan Holder had nothing to do with the latter 2, and F&amp;F was not gun running, nor was it illegal.
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 What law did he break ?
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan Ij ust told you how, smarter and better laws that are more easily enforceable,
@ejayharris38 @stacihogan I think "smarter" more up to date laws would help, do you disagree ?
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 I dont call that effective.
@stacihogan @ejayharris38 You can enforce weed laws, but more than 50% of people in this nation still admit to having used it by adulthood.

@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin You said "why argue with people who dont believe in god" earlier.
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin right, my question is why do you think it is morally wrong to be gay ?
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin by the way, disagreeing with you on homosexuality does not mean someone does not believe in god.
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin yes, but why are you equating murder to homosexuality ?
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin well that begs the question of why do you believe homosexuality is morally wrong ?
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin belief is void of facts. believing that someone chooses to be gay does not make it true.
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin you said "beliefs" if you are not talking about religion,then what are you talking about ?
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin so even if you want to argue that it is a sin, that doesnt make it a choice.
@Tabitha_Asare @Troy_Franklin your argument is based on a flawed premise, i dont remember the bible saying homosexuality was a choice.
@Tabitha_Asare @MentalOrgasm @KevinHart2ReaI @JamaLisWho there are studies done by the APA that say it isnt a choice.

so fun watching Republicans lie to themselves.
@IrishTea1 I have seen the video and you are lying, not once in that video does he say the Obama administration will kill in the U.S.
@IrishTea1 Your tweet should read war or drones and i choose drones.
@IrishTea1 Obama has never once said he would do that. and no i wouldnt be ok with it,now talk about something that actually happened.
i am beginning to think that some Republicans dont care if they  are right or wrong, only that they are heard.
@IrishTea1 im going to end this conv.
@IrishTea1 RandPaul himself disagrees with you, he said it live.
@IrishTea1 Bush's solution was death by war (invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan ) yes,drones are better than war
@IrishTea1  How is it a copout ? you made a claim that was untrue.
@IrishTea1 both are wrong. never once denied that.
@IrishTea1 none of which say President Obama would drone strike anyone in the US, which is what you claimed.

@IrishTea1 He did no such thing, did you read the email ?
@IrishTea1 I do not disagree with what he said. i disagree with what people on twitter asPaul himself said Obama wasnt going to do it.
@IrishTea1 the bigger point is, Obama never said he would use drones, nor did Holder. Filibuster was about a hypothetical.
@IrishTea1 and wow, why the need to stoop to low ball tactics? #stayclassy
@IrishTea1 they arent, nore did i say they were.Paul covered 3 different areas in his filibuster.
So many republicans supporting Rand Paul not even realizing who voted for the 2012 NDAA.
@IrishTea1 LOL, your and Rand's party created what Rand Paul is filibustering, yet your comment is about Obama.
Rand Paul is a senator, he could introduce legislation if he really wanted to take a stand
@IrishTea1 You do realize Republicans wrote the 2012 NDAA that rand mentioned right ?
@gbmegafan you probably should watch the clip before you retweet it.
