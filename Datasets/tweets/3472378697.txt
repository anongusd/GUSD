As a former defense and intelligence officer, @ElissaSlotkin recognizes the threat that climate change poses to national security. She defeated a climate denier and will be another critical voice in Congress for the best interests of our children and grandchildren.
.@sharicedavids knows that protecting our environment and natural resources is necessary for our planet and economy. We can count on her to support measures that help states realize their full renewable energy potential and to fight to keep air and water clean
.@Abby4Iowa has already proved she is a champion for our environment and climate in the IA State House, especially for Iowa's plentiful wind energy. She also beat Rod Blum, an admitted climate denier.
.@AngieCraigMN recognizes that climate change can be combated while boosting our economy, protecting our families, She also beat Rep. Jason Lewis, who spouted conspiracy theories about climate science
.@XochforCongress opened her campaign with an ad touting her work to preserve water rights and protect public lands. She also defeated State Rep. Yvette Herrell has been a reliable ally for out of state polluter interests.

The economic benefits of the standards are as high as $90 billion annually, outweighing the costs by up to a margin of 9 to 1.
There's no reason to roll these back since virtually all power plants now meet the standards, and have done so at a fraction of the expected cost.
Serious benefits: EPA estimates the standards save up to 11,000 lives each year and prevent thousands of heart attacks, asthma and bronchitis attacks, and hospital and emergency room visits.
Serious impact: The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ensure 90% of the mercury in coal burned in power plants is not released into our air.
