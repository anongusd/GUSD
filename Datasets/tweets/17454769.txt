@nickmalark I didn‚Äôt say I was trying to find YOUR happy place.  But, perhaps, you should work on that yourself.
@Aussiekate1 Very, VERY early.  But you can‚Äôt see the beginnings of a smile on her face?   Sun, mountain, skiing.  Sounds happy to me.
@reddblossom It is my living room.   It isn‚Äôt great.   I make a mess.
@SonSheik Oops, I just got it.  No. But, I did have to take a break from my	 Native American series because I didn‚Äôt want to bring any negative thoughts into that work.
@SonSheik I will have to look him up.
@cpproaudio Chris.  Thank you for being cool.  I am sure we disagree on a ton of things, but being able to see past th\ose th\ings and seeing people as ‚Äòpeople‚Äô again, is rare and almost heroic.   Sad isn‚Äôt it.   Keep it up.
@wmoretti1coxnet You\ are too kind.   Believe me there are many things I cannot do.	I actually put painting in that category.  :).  But I enjoy it.
@sarabelluum Sure. Haven‚Äôt even started the back ground yet.
@Maureen11015929 It would look better if you had a few belts first I agree.  But I assume you are not speaking about the art however.   I am so sorry that you feel better by lashing out.   I hope some day we can both lessen the focus on politics and see people for more than their opinion on DC
@GalaxyofSloth It is funny how accurate those chalkboards were.  Caliphate, isis, rise of Nazis, destabilization of in Europe and our border. The rise of Russia meddling in our elections, tHe death of Obama care and the push for single payer and my favorite, the rise of socialists in the US.
@KPY1134 Really?   I need more time.  I paint for a couple of hours on the weekend and then usually very late at night after all are asleep and I can‚Äôt sleep.   I need more time and you TOO, need an extra O in your tweet.
@MarclovesAshlee @RenleeAsh How I wish I could play the piano.   If I could ask for a talent, it would be that.  Music speaks to me.   What a couple.   I wish Tania played piano, while I painted.   Love to see her art or hear you play.  Ranch no 3? Or anything Chopin.
@Ulfhednar357 Did you paint this?   If so,  it is very good.
@TL38227608 Yes,  I am trying to learn how to paint graphic, poster like art.  I love WPA national parks and ‚Äòtravel‚Äô art from the 40‚Äôs.
@lrmortensen Believe me I won‚Äôt.   If you are one that is saying this thinking you are cruel here and want me to feel some pain.   Just know, it is comments like this that ensure that I never quit my day job.  If you were just being honest as a fan... believe me I know. It is a hobby.
@swissreason Michael, I am sure I have done plenty to piss you off.   If I hurt you personally in someway, I apologize.  My opinion on politics like yours is personal.   I don‚Äôt like the stance and attitude of many on the left, but am trying hard to look for things beyond politics. Best 2 U
@AbbyRoggenkamp Abby, really neither can I.  Most of my paintings, 99% I don‚Äôt like.   They never turn out what I wanted them to look like, but I have learned to let it go.   Enjoy it for the work and just keep painting.  Most of my paintings have 3-5 older paintings underneath.
@Aussiekate1 See my note
@shawnkinney4 Never pay back. Pay it forward!  Things always get better when you help others.   Thank you for blessing us.  No go get your blessings!

@aplusk 4.   Overdose deaths from opioids, including prescription opioids and heroin, have increased by more than five times since 1999. Overdoses involving opioids killed more than 42,000 people in 2016 alone.
@aplusk 2. Suicide was the 2nd leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 - 34, and the 4th leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 -54.There were more than twice as many suicides (44,965) in the United States as there were homicides (19,362)
@aplusk 2.  You are also mixing stats.   Your stat also includes suicides and shootings in places like Chicago.  Why is it that no one seems to really care about the dead in Chicago?  Is it that it shows that gun bans don‚Äôt work? And those who are suicidal will find a way.
@aplusk 1.   Okay, let‚Äôs.  10 people a DAY die in the US in a pool.  75% of them are children.  We could eliminate ALMOST ALL pools. Very rich criminals may still get their hands on a indoor, inground, illegal pool. But at a lower rate Han illegal guns.
2 @aplusk - no disrespect Ashton, as you stated, Guns are not for hunting or simply to protect your home &amp; 4 those who say you can‚Äôt fight the us govt, see Afghanistan. + School gun violence is down by 33% since 1993. (DOJ|Pew|Pinker) gun homicides Down 49%, gun crime down 75%

@DCW00ds777444 Then stop pretending to be a journalist and become an advocate.   As a member of the press corps there is a set of standards.  You cannot just hijack.  How was the president to respond?  He answered and JA didn‚Äôt like the answer. Would you support fox doing this to Obama?
@sturgeon_slayer @Acosta No. Hijacking a press conference is a problem.  The president answered his ‚Äòcharges‚Äô.  JA wanted this fight.  Unfortunately, Sarah Sanders gave it to them.
@agent1220 No. Both to the same standard and they both failed.
@Claypleasoptin Thank you.  This was wrong as well.  He did not ‚Äòassault‚Äô the staffer.  Even though that is exactly what the left would claim if roles were reversed.   No need to stretch or make things up. Like I said, two kids. Both need a time out.

4. Again, if you judge them, then you must judge your ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô history.  If you think capitalism is evil, global warming must end today and are not forming an army and killing those who disagree, you are exactly like the founders. My fear is, many don‚Äôt value peace 2day.
3. The 3/5th‚Äôs clause was to WEAKEN the hold of the slave owners who wanted to count slaves as 1 whole person.  The Founders said ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt count slaves as a human you cannot count them for ‚Äòrepresentation‚Äô. Thus REDUCING influence. The ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô compromise was 3/5th.
2. Answer: because it would require you to kill half the population.  What makes you a ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô? You believe in moving the ‚Äòball‚Äô down the field bit by bit instead of revolution.  The same in 1789. The constitution banned the sale of humans as step one. Cont.

@ArtsBlogKeeper1 Agree, but he has delivered a sworn statement under penalty of perjury.I do not feel 100% about judge, but I want a fair and just system of Due Process.Leaks from the DNC has destroyed Ford and Kavanaugh. Any leaks on the fbi report, should be found and sent to jail. Either side.
@TBoharic I agree.  However, is he a credible witness?  Addict, alcoholic and very unstable.  I know nothing about him.  If he has truly turned over a new leaf, he may be the most credible witness. He should be asked and clarified, but raw data and public performances add nothing.
@jo_conservative We stand.  We refuse to go over the cliff with the rest of humanity.  Due process, rule of law, the bill of rights.  We must continue to make this about facts, principles and reason. NEVER about personalities, teams, or ‚Äògetting even‚Äô. Be the highest version of yourself.
@ConAlterEgo Not at all.  I believe Mark judge should testify.  He has given his statement to the fbi.   Raw data should be withheld from public scrutiny.   GPS/fusion is a perfect case in point. I want rapists to go to jail. But I also believe in due process.
@Atheist_Cowboy @Cassie_Jaye Rob, it is so much better to listen before you speak.  I think you would find the conversation not what you might expect.

#LindsayGraham has never been a favorite of mine, in fact quite the opposite, but he not only spoke every word I was feeling but I believe the words that 60% of Americans are feeling. Both Kav and Ford were victims of power hungry dis. Thank you Lindsay.
I watched the #KanavaughFord horror show w/ my kids. They didn‚Äôt understand the process and didn‚Äôt know who ‚Äòwon‚Äô.  That has bothered me all day. Won? Tonight, watching cable news act like ESPN, I‚Äôm sick. I don‚Äôt know who won. But it is clear who lost. All of us and our children.

Ford trusted the democrats who now say Fords friends leaked the information.  They betrayed and used her, all victims and the innocent for nothing but political gain.	Shameful.  Americans are fair and just. Both Ford and Kavanaugh were used and destroyed.
2. Americans are fair and I believe they see the pain on both sides and w/o evidence will not want to choose. If the democrats cram this down, I believe Americans will rise up at the polls, as we don‚Äôt want this to happen to our sons, brothers, husbands fathers. DUE PROCESS.
1.  This may backfire on he democrats in a very real and powerful way.  Americans believe in fairness and justice. Ford was good, but changed no minds, Kavanaugh brought it to even at worst. Fair minded don‚Äôt feel comfortable deciding this fate...
So if you are a man, you can interupt, shout down and mock.  But the republicans had to fall over themselves in kindness.

Facts and feelings.  #Kavanagh wins both today.
I don‚Äôt think I can handle listening to the press tear this man apart after hearing #Kavenaugh   What they say will set the country up to peace or conflict.   Will they ratchet things down or double down?  I fear for the future.
If you think #Kavanaugh is lying then he deserves an Emmy and an Oscar for best performance.His emotion for those who stood up for him is palpable.  Name the actor that could deliver this if it weren‚Äôt true. No one but the best actors could pull this off. He is telling the truth.

Kavanaugh is hitting it out of the park.  The left will not hear him but 60% will - if they are able to see this response.  This is a pivot point.  #KavanughHearings will be remembered as a key point in the death of our nation.
It is time once again for someone to ask:  ‚Äòhave you no shame!‚Äù  How can a country survive if this is our selection process.   ‚ÄòA national disgrace.‚Äô

Dear God, I cannot take #coreybooker talk about our ‚Äòlives, fortunes and sacred honor‚Äô.  Sit down Spartacus.
The #FordHearing is NOT about truth, Justice 7 certainly not about you. This is ONLY about three people.  Can the press convince 3 senators that the backlash to them will be too great if they vote for Kavanaugh.We are watching the most expensive lobbying moment in history.
Why do the @CNN hosts keep asking about republicans who come to this #fordtestimony ‚Äòwith an open mind‚Äô, and not the same for democrats? Does an open mind indicate that you can only achieve this status by agreeing with Ford?
This is the OJ Trial Redux. #FordKavanaughHearing   When social justice is involved, peoples ‚Äòfeelings‚Äô trump evidence. Half of the country and apparently EVERY VOICE on cnn believe her. The other half will not.  OJ jury had dna evidence they dismissed. Here it is only her word.
2.  How can ANY one defend themselves if we make it all about personality performance? ‚ÄòShe is so credible‚Äô.  Is countered with ‚Äòshe is lying.‚Äô  He said/she said. No winners.	We cannot destroy people on this level of evidence. Would you accept this standard for YOU?
1.   #FordKavanaugh observations so far. 	#cnn keeps referring to her crying. Not once has she cried.	She has seemed nervous or afraid. She has not provided any evidence beside her testimony. Mark Judge should be compelled to testify.  This process doesn‚Äôt work.
This is a search for truth &amp; justice? This is ridiculous.  Let the woman who does this for a living do her job then give the senators time to ask afterword.  This is a joke.  #ChristinaBlaseyFord

Now, I only remembered this because when Donald trump was running I saw BK‚Äôs name on that judge list. Now I know you say his name wasn‚Äôt on that list, but that is like saying the NYTs removed a paragraph and then denied it was ever written....2
1.  I need to make this statement that I am pretty sure happened sometime between 1964 and 1987.  @BrettKavanaugh who may have been 7 yrs old, (possiblly 15)ran a chain of whore houses where he kept college age woman locked in hush puppy shoe boxes.

@OKnOKC @joerogan I drove the first hydrogen car that GM built.  I had it for a week.  No doubt in my mind that it could be done quickly.  That tech was in 2007. (My review is somewhere on YouTube) the bailout forced them to ditch it for the volt!
@StuntsWard @joerogan Where was there any anger in my tweet?

@D_Barbera @fred_guttenberg I was not reading into it. I was reading Fred‚Äôs tweet from 2 days ago.
@ernestoserrano @fred_guttenberg @famsvarpac No tragedy NONE gives you lifetime license to be free of challenge. I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child in ANY way let alone a shooting. &amp; as I said to Fred, I should have been more gentle in my 1st tweet. However, the ?‚Äôs I asked are fair &amp; deserve a civil conversation.
@fred_guttenberg Fred, I am truly disappointed.I have NEVER set a guest up. My bookers at CNN and Fox will confirm I ALWAYS keep my word with guests ALWAYS.americans want a fair, civil conversation (not debate) i tweeted ?‚Äôs in a thread earlier. I want reconciliation not a win.plz reconsider

@mikiebarb Michael as a daily podcast listener, I would love to hear you address - If trump is a danger:  1. Doesn‚Äôt he have a responsibility to tell us and not allow people to just claim he is a ‚Äònobody‚Äô or fake news?  2. Doesn‚Äôt this make POTUS more paranoid? 3. Is this even lawful?

@LiberalPaul I am for tough enforcement laws.   Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth. Also, just because we disagree doesn‚Äôt mean I want children to die.   I believe there are things that aren‚Äôt being done on both sides but name calling stops reason.

5.  FYI, this judge isn‚Äôt one I would pick, so I am not a blind defender, nor a guy who blindly defends Trump or GOP, but I was ashamed by the circus - he does not hate you, your child or children. You accomplished your stated goal.  I find it sad and dishonorable.

3.  Fred, completely apart from my disagreement on gun control, or tragic loss for your child.  You tweeted that you were going to do something to insure he wouldn‚Äôt be confirmed, 2 days b4 the ‚Äòhandshake‚Äô. Were you an ‚Äòhonest broker?‚Äô  Cont
2.  Before we get to Kavanaugh - I am honestly trying to understand, why you haven‚Äôt banned together for a new Sheriff, school board etc.   While I disagree with gun control, it is your right to disagree, so yes, pursue that, but when will those locally be held Accountable?
1. Fred, truly I am sorry for your loss.  I cannot imagine what it is like to lose a child.  The pain must be crippling and never ending.   There is no daylight between us on this.  Please know that I believe you, that you would never choose this life or path.  Cont. https://t.co/d9BW2pGY4y
I will NOT apologize.   2 days before his ‚Äòmeeting‚Äô, he stated his goal of being there to make sure the nominee would be blocked for confirmation.   That is not an honest broker. This was a preplanned set up.

@mom_5girls @chucktodd I am being kind.  Actually the 9th ‚Äòmost trusted‚Äô is CNN.  BBC is 1, FOX is Two, PBS/NPR is three.  Clearly lots of liberals in this poll, but to have FOX surrounded by those two over media giants speaks volumes.

College is absolutely critical for some.  But non traditional pathways are now opening up.   I don‚Äôt know why we ever got rid of apprenticeships.   People need different roads.  Why does society believe one size fits all when we reject it in everything else? https://t.co/cnCr3pwsAF

@HollyCabot @benshapiro @MarkDuplass You are half right.  Disney knew about these tweets which he explained and publically apologized for years ago.

@realGaryCondit @JamesGunn No Gary, I was there.  I remember when the mob surrounded you before sept 11th.   I honestly don‚Äôt remember what my stance was back then regarding you.  But I do know,  I have learned a ton since then.  Isn‚Äôt that the point @JamesGunn is making? We can all change?

@RobertaSparks8 Trying to understand how Kipling‚Äôs Warning of Fabian socialism/progressivism, is me going off the deep end.   Does what you see on tv seem logical?
@TParty4America No, not at all.  Just sharing a warning of what happens when the world goes mad. Where people, like Chuck Schumer, claim trump is a dictator only to then tell him to change laws w/ a ‚Äòflick of his pen.‚Äôthis whole media/border thing is NOT about truth or kids.
This becomes more and more correct with each passing day.	He wrote it as a warning to us and all future generations about Fabian socialism.   Or what in America we call progressivism.  	Rudyard Kipling after the lies were exposed at the end of WW1
14.  And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins	When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,	As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,	The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!
13.  As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man	There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.	That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,	And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;
12.	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.
11.  Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew	And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true	That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
10.  In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,	By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;	But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "If you don't work you die."
9.  And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "The Wages of Sin is Death."
8.  On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life	(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)	Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
7.  But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "Stick to the Devil you know."
6. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.	They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
6. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.	They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
5. So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things
4With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
3. We moved as the Spirit listed.They never altered their pace,Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,But they always caught up with our progress, and word would come	That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.
2. We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn	That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:	But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,	So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.
1/. AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,	I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.	Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,	And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

@cnn is at it off the bat.  @jaketapper did you feel this way about how polarizing the Obama speeches felt to half of America?  This president gave more opportunity to work together at HIS own peril just tonight, than O did in 8 years.
#sotu #donaldjtrump #potus  I am not sure what the North Korean or Russian judge will give him.  But this American judge gives him a 9.0.  The author gets a 10.0 a perfect score.   Very strong.
#sotu ‚Äòtotal resolve‚Äô.   This section on North Korea is powerful and FRIGHTENING.   Why does this feel like a pathway to war?    So evil.  So dangerous.
#potus #sotu OBAMA must be pissed!   Wow.  G Bay double down and revised rules of engagement.   Perhaps he is on the bar stool next to Steve Bannon with a half empty bottle of Zima muttering, ‚Äòwhat the hell happened to all my executive orders?  They could have been laws‚Äô.
#sotu   I would give my left arm to deliver this speech for DJT tonight.   So well written ... can I be a pinch hitter?  POTUS can run the bases and get the glory.   This speech deserves the Reagan delivery.
#potus #sotu #opioidcrisis - please - PLEASE - no war on opioids!   It isn‚Äôt just the drug dealers, but also over prescribing and then no assistance for people who want to get off.   I have seen how these drugs enslave and kill first hand. #compassion&amp;empower
#sotu how are the democrats not loving this immigration reform stuff?  4x‚Äôs as many dreamers WITH PATH TO CITIZENSHIP!!!  Frauds!   The first pillar is A Path not a wall.  Wow.   If all could get done, no one in DC will be happy. But most Americans will be.

#sotu #DonaldTrump is hitting this out of the park.  His invitation to the Democrats to stand for low drug prices was worth the price of admission alone.
#sotu laundry list of what has happened this year is off the charts!  This is the best speech he has given ever.  So well written.
Notice he doesn‚Äôt lean, look or even notice anything on his right.  For those on the left, this is what the other half felt like every #sotu  between 08-16.The first 20 minutes has been a delicious and well written declaration of what the right has waited to hear. #iloveTHIStrump

@AlanStump1 Do you even understand my tweet?   Btw- just because you read something, doesn‚Äôt mean you endorse or believe.  I have read Marx, Hitler, and Churchill.   I only agree with Churchill.
I am 1/3 through #FireAndFury.I read the tweets both left and right this am about #stablegenius. Read them all and then this line from the book:  "Everybody believed their side‚Äôs conspiracies, while utterly, and righteously, rejecting the conspiracies leveled at them."
On my third book in the Singularity series by William Hertling.  The BEST novel(s) I have read so far on the solutions and problems with AI.  Very balanced - both utopian and dystopian at the same time.   Must read for those who want to understand what the next 10-20yrs hold.

@cmanock1 @benshapiro Agree.   But this is a problem on both sides.   Now, just much more pronounced on the right.
@petefrt No crow for me.  I have warned against Bannon and almost everyone that associates with him for years.  He is still a symptom of the problem.   Albeit a bad symptom.  What is our actual problem?  It is way beyond politics.
@BrownTieDan I am and have been.Just because you don‚Äôt listen or watch, please don‚Äôt assume.I have been almost alone on the right standing against trump since he announced.  I have and continue to pay a high price.   I do talk about Non political solutions everyday as our symptom is politics.
@suep398 @jaketapper Who said that?
@al5252 I have warned against him and the White House since long before they were all in the White House.    You are right, some don‚Äôt like him because he now is against trump.    He has always been a danger to the country and world.   And he isn‚Äôt the only one.
@Poohbear98188 I think your right.  Now, who has the credibility to build the case with facts that 70% of the country will accept?  We must restore truth.   Investigate all of them and let the chips fall where they may.
@mrsblack777 Who said it was a lie?
@KGoldPhysics This shows that you haven‚Äôt taken the time to see what I have been saying for the last two years.   You most like;y don‚Äôt even know that trump has Put me on his enemies list since the day he announced.
