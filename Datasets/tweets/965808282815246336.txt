What is happening in America between Democrats et Republicans is horrible. Over the years Democrats had a harsh language against illegal immigration but they never did anything (just speaking). But when Republicans try to fix the issue (because they take action) it becomes badü§î https://t.co/PsVBBYKzqQ
@JProskowGlobal Why do parents put their own children in such a risk? Their parents should locked out where the hell they are. Why using the children trying to force them to become immigrants? It is very sad that Americans see only the children to enter in their country but they don‚Äôt care why??

About 2 weeks before the renewal of the largest UN peacekeeping mandate in the Dem. Rep. of Congo, more 41 people were killed in Ituri district yesterday. It is unbelievable that this continues to happen where more than 18,000 well-equipped so called peacekeepers are serving.
Coming back to Twitter after a long time, I like to follow and be followed by people who spend their time thinking how to make the world a better place for everyone. So, if you are a world spoiler and I followed you by any chance, please unfollow me immediately.

@TynaDolce @MONUSCO C'est tout ce la MONUSCO sait faire en RDC pendant que les gens sont tu√©s et massacr√©s tous les jours. Ce sont des tourristes qui sont venus gouter du miel et du lait du pays.
Le mandat de la mission de maintien de la paix de l'ONU en R√©publique d√©mocratique du Congo, la plus grande au monde, se termine le 31 mars  2018. Une force compos√©e de plus de 20.000 hommes est sur le terrain depuis pr√®s de 2 d√©cennies avec d'innombrables meurtres de civils ....
The UN peacekeeping mission's mandate in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the biggest ever in the world, is ending on March 31 this year. A force composed of more than 20,000 people has been on the ground in the country for nearly 2 decades with countless killing of civilians...
I want to remind all the pauperized people of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that there is no situation in the world that remains unchanged. Everything has a beginning and an end. Your suffering will also end (and maybe soon). Keep hoping for the best! Mobutu's era passed

More 7 people killed by rebels in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I feel so sad every time I look at the suffering people are going through across the DRC where the United Nations have the world biggest peacekeeping mission!
What does really the United Nations mission do in the Democratic Republic of Congo? With over 18,000 peacekeepers and very good military equipment people are still being killed every day in the country!
Hi there! I'm back after a long period of absence here. What's going on there? I hope everyone is still working hard to make peace and love in their surrounding. May peace and love reign in the world.
