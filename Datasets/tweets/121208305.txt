Bernie lost control of his movement bc he endorsed too late. Now he's gotta get them in line.
This was hard for Bernie and he should be saluted for it.
Love fantastic contrast between Michelle and Warren. Passion followed by prose.
Alpha girl power from Michelle right now. Truly real and powerful endorsement.

Make @megynkelly CEO of Fox News. Has the balls and smarts, plus Fox needs a gender revolution.
Exit Ailes, who defined cable news culture for so long. Inevitable he would be done in by new rules, strong women and new Murdoch regime.
