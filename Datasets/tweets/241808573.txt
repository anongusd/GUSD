3️⃣ parts to today’s episode:	- “WTF just happened” w/ our map guru @TomLlamasABC 	- “On the ground” with our reporters across the country	- “What’s next?” with our team thinking 10 steps ahead: @karentravers, @KSoltisAnderson &amp; pod host @anamariecox. 		https://t.co/HWC8IbX8Af
Chris Collins, who was indicted for insider trading, who Republicans tried to get off the ballot, has won his NY congressional seat.		And Bob Menendez, who was also indicted, who has a 33 percent approval rating, won his NJ senate seat.
Except for Florida. Right? https://t.co/UKxnT0nNyn
RT @jdistaso: Just in: @EddieEdwards has just CONCEDED THE #NH01 RACE TO @ChrisPappasNH #nhpolitics #WMUR
BREAKING: ABC News can project that Democrats will take the House.
We hear all the time how Democrats, even in losing, are overperforming in districts. 		Regardless of how Florida turns out, polls in Florida were clearly off -- Gillum and Nelson were up by about 7 points in some recent polls. Republicans are the ones who overperformed here.
Remember, Heitkamp was already on thin ice - and then she voted against Kavanaugh. That clearly sealed her fate -- close to half of ND voters said it played a role in their decision.
REPUBLICANS WILL KEEP THE SENATE. ABC is able to project that Heitkamp will lose to Kevin Cramer in North Dakota.
Big moment for the LGBTQ community: Colorado becomes the first state to elect an openly gay governor. But minutes later, ABC projects that Christine Hallquist will lose her race in VT. She would have been nation's 1st trans governor.
Donnelly goes down early -- ABC News projects a huge win in Indiana for @braun4indiana, and Republicans. as they look to hold the Senate.
Amazing moment from @jonkarl, as he points out that according to exit polls, 2/3 of New Jersey does not like Bob Menendez -- he looks to the camera to say -- "and he won."
This isn't the first time there have been some egregious issues with the NYC Board of Elections though - also during de Blasio's tenure: https://t.co/wS3q4y8F2W https://t.co/DcLBGnRQrJ
That was quick: Comstock goes down in Virginia in the first big House flip of the night.
Barely three years ago, I was talking to @ChrisPappasNH about his family restaurant and their famous chicken fingers. Tonight he could become New Hampshire's first openly gay man elected to congress. 		https://t.co/DeePUiiln6
The highest midterm Hispanic turnout we’ve ever seen is 8 percent of the vote. According to preliminary exit polls, Hispanics make up 11 percent of today’s voters.
@MericaAmerican @AronBender No not really - not every state allows early and absentee voting. In some states you have to provide a valid excuse. 		And Christmas Eve shopping wasn’t enshrined in the Constitution as a basic right.
Can someone explain to me why hour long lines are heartwarming? That means voting continues to be way harder for some than others. 		You don’t see an hour long line at a grocery store and go “this system really works.”

Bharara says he was not called up by Obama. Between November 8th and the day he was fired, Trump called 3 times.

@janjez9 Ha whoops
Comey tells Susan Collins (R-ME) that POTUS was not under any investigation of ANY kind when they spoke, and still wasn't when he was fired.
Says he was concerned with saying POTUS wasn't under investigation, in case that changed, a scenario "which I've lived before."
Calling himself "slightly cowardly," wishing he would have told POTUS he was wrong, "if I were stronger." https://t.co/w4VMGguoRQ
Comey's set pieces always involve the word Lordy. "Lordy, that would be bad!" https://t.co/DNQPnkYs4j
"I’ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes."
We had wondered if Comey would refuse to answer questions about why he was fired: he's hedging, but not staying away from speculation.
Comey clarifies: “I took it as a direction.” https://t.co/8SVoUvLmXN
Comey pressed on whether POTUS ordered him to "let this go." 		"Not in his words, no."
This is remarkable: Comey says he got the feeling from everyone in the room, including Kushner and Sessions, could tell it was big. https://t.co/GdZvwj815O
Comey: My impression was “something big is about to happen." I need to remember every word that was spoken.
Why the job talk? Comey: POTUS had concluded, or someone had told him "you already asked Comey to stay, and you didn’t get anything for it."
With Bush and Obama, "I didn't feel the need to document it in that way." https://t.co/W9gKkoKTSi
Among other reasons, Comey says President Trump's "nature" required note-taking: "I thought he might lie about the nature of our meeting."
Was Flynn incident obstruction, or saving face? Comey doesn't say, but adds there WAS an investigation...&amp; POTUS words were "disturbing."
Did the president ask you to stop the Russia investigation? 	"Not to my understanding, no.”
Staunch defense of FBI: honest, strong, and independent. To agents: “I am so sorry I didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to you properly.”
If you're wondering why he chose to release the statement -- he's able to riff on it today. https://t.co/8LZgFhppxP
Warner: "DNI Coats and NSA Director Admiral Rogers had plenty of opportunities to flatly deny these reports yesterday. They did not."

This received unanimous approval. Wyden: "you can get as high off of hemp as a basket of vegetables." https://t.co/4KA850ZrIp
(2/2) ...but that explanation ignores Trump's repeated concerns with the broader investigation. Flynn is not "the cloud."
You could construe POTUS words about Flynn as a boss who's concerned about persecution of his disgraced employee, not Russia... (1/2)
The thing that sticks out to me is the persistence: Comey says POTUS pressed "loyalty" multiple times, as well as "letting Flynn go." https://t.co/dNwr92z8oa

Comey says he thanked the lawyer for asking, but "not for a moment" would he consider what the outcome would be.
Comey says a young FBI lawyer asked him: should you consider that what you're about to do may elect Donald Trump president?
On speaking out, ten days from an election: "Lordy that would be bad!" But Comey says the other option, concealing, would be even worse.
Comey says the idea that he influenced a campaign makes him "mildly nauseous," but that looking back he had no other option.
Passionate defense from Comey over his decision to go public: "I could not see a door labeled 'no action here.'"
Grassley asking about NYT report that Clinton was assured she was safe from prosecution. Comey says he can't answer in open hearing.

The argument of the court: in terms of 1st amendment, these anti-selfie laws are "burning down the house to roast the pig."
The argument against: this enables vote buying, since you can ask for a photo of the previously secret ballot.
1st circuit has ruled that "ballot selfies" are constitutional, upending a NH law.
It's official: Congress has handed POTUS the first veto of his presidency.

The word "yarn" doesn't begin to describe this epic by Bill Clinton. https://t.co/zVip0kkMVk
Who knew it would be South Dakotah? This was the moment Hillary Clinton went over the top: https://t.co/ypjejK9kou
RT @shushwalshe: Tune into @ABCNewsRadio @AaronKatersky @treyhardin16 @AnnCompton @TheBradMielke &amp; I are reporting from #DemsInPhilly
But quote of the day from a HI Sanders delegate: "they think they can sells unity with some well-placed signs? No." https://t.co/od0tULPZkh
Omg just had a @mjzona sighting at the #DNCinPHL #nhpolitics https://t.co/frPdI2KX78
Citing a run by Joaquin Castro, Ted Cruz is soliciting donations for his 2018 re-elect...a week after many R's refused to support him again.
"I'm Elizabeth Banks...this is what it's going to be like." -proof that mic checks are even awkward for famous ppl. https://t.co/BtBdTToBFU
If Sarah Silverman has trouble keeping her cool among Bernie Sanders hecklers, how is Bill Clinton going to react to extended boos?
"No TPP" is one of the most sustained chants so far.
The reaction to Sanders' endorsement of Hillary Clinton: "We Want Bernie." https://t.co/bWFTpkG3ar
These cheers are absolutely deafening. Unlike anything so far at either convention. https://t.co/O7CXzPBXMr
This the reaction to Elizabeth Warren, the most fiery speaker in the Democratic Party. https://t.co/KFN5XVtqxt
First speaker the crowd has really gotten behind. https://t.co/V9f01nzf3i
"Hey let's give out signs for every speaker. All of a sudden I can't see the Bernie supporters."
While Michelle Obama gets in her Trump digs, Team Kasich gets in its own.  https://t.co/RhN0AEeM5Y
Oh she's getting direct quickly. @MichelleObama calling out @realDonaldTrump for birtherism.
Signs bearing the name @MichelleObama being passed out as a video plays. #DNCinPhilly https://t.co/egFDhLC5ZX
She looks genuinely distraught in this moment.  https://t.co/m0WvBRB9HS
RT @PeterSullivan4: So who had Sarah Silverman in the "pivotal moment in the convention" pool?
"You're being ridiculous" absolutely blew the roof off the place -- but seemingly only because both sides were louder and angrier than ever.
Sarah Silverman couldn't be heard over her fellow Bernie Sanders supporters. Finally she snaps at #BernieOrBust: "you're being ridiculous."
This is remarkable. Big names like Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Al Franken are met with crossed arms by Sanders delegates, even on agreeable issues.
A rare sight right now: Colorado delegates embracing. Chris, in tears, says he's disappointed in Sanders boos. https://t.co/Pm2SHL5TUK
A Bernie Sanders delegate from CA just articulated his strategy tonight: boo anytime the words "Hillary Clinton" are mentioned.
As @rickklein points out, "this is not normal."
Short of Ted Cruz, this is the most raucous moment in either convention. We are 35 minutes in.
Uh oh. Marcia Fudge just gave loud delegates a pointed "excuse me." Jeers only got louder. #DNCinPHL
Boos at nearly every mention of the name "Hillary Clinton" or "Tim Kaine."
The floor erupts into "Hillary" and "Bernie" chants...during the invocation, no less. #DNCinPHL https://t.co/0tMhtPNIHX
.@BernieSanders doesn't just want DWS out of the DNC, he wants her out of Congress: Tim Canova says he's raised $100k since the leak.
RT @ABCPolitics: JUST IN: Outgoing DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz will not gavel in DNC convention, official tells @ABC.
This is insane https://t.co/V07npKsbzH
This is Nowcast, the simulation of if the election were held today.  https://t.co/XfiJSZIhId
Late to post, but this was the scene facing DWS the moment she took the stage. https://t.co/TEg0yYsV3D
A @BernieSanders supporte gets into it with a @DWStweets supporter. He asks for a hug...and doesn't get one. https://t.co/nKSpWRI3Az
My how time flies https://t.co/OmhyqA8Oqv
Nothing but thanks from @HillaryClinton to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. https://t.co/0wj7lnohJM
Stephen Colbert working the floor, looking for missing emails. #DNCinPHL https://t.co/343dCpEN77
Former NYC mayor (and fmr Republican) Michael Bloomberg will endorse Clinton &amp; speak in Philly, @JoshMargolin confirms.
More balloons are still trickling out. Could just be stragglers, but imagine how nervous organizers will be about a primetime disaster.
RT @jonkarl: Another leak!  Who is behind this one?  As @rickklein points out, the balloons are red .... https://t.co/5xiPPOw2kd
Democrats probably asking why the RED ONES screwed everything up.
Balloons dropping early! #DNCinPHL #YouHadOneJob https://t.co/fuGceAv1jx
Premature balloon drop: several dozen red balloons just escaped their netting and covered the New York delegation's seats. #DNC2016
RT @jonkarl: "I think she should resign" - @BernieSanders on @DWStweets  #ThisWeek @ThisWeekABC
RT @ThisWeekABC: Paul Manafort: Trump's acceptance speech "was not a dark speech. It was actually a very optimistic speech." https://t.co/o…
RT @rickklein: In line w @jeffzeleny reporting - Dems in talks to majorly downgrade DWS role at her own convention. She may not even gavel…
Put us in, coach. #dncmediaparty https://t.co/76znKzqeXj
Halperin asked if @realDonaldTrump entered during Cruz's speech to "tweak" him. "Tweak him? I would never do a thing like that. But yes.”
RT @JeffFlake: Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.
Remember 2008, when all the drama revolved around the vice presidential debate? Somehow I DON'T think that's the case this year.
@jesshop23 how's your Spanish??
Kaine's first words: "Bienvenidos a todos." Expect lots of Spanish in this week and throughout this campaign.
This mentality would fly better with @BernieSanders fans if parties didn't hold primaries. https://t.co/mBOnR7c7Q7
Clinton literally took a deep breath before thanking Debbie Wasserman Schultz by name.
A vice presidential candidate's initials are "TK." Newsrooms are so screwed.
ask JEB! https://t.co/ue2xqbG4Wd
Thoughts? https://t.co/tFrFfcAdIC
RT @kasie: PARALLELS: Tim Kaine and Mike Pence are two of the most gracious, polite politicians I've ever covered
Another useful fact: @timkaine has never lost an election.
RT @JulianCastro: #Clinton/Kaine! A winning ticket for America. #ImWithThem
Fun fact about Tim Kaine: he's fluent in Spanish.
