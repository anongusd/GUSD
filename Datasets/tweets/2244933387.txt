@foxandfriends Dems will follow the Mitch “weasel” McConnell rule displayed in 2016. Cheers!
@senorrinhatch We will take the 2016 GOP example. Cheers!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Tell your daddy to start working on his next choice for nominee. Kavanaugh is not going to make it. Wanted you to hear it first.
@SarahPalinUSA Great!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You and your Dad are liars. Every time you open your mouth it’s all lies.
@RealDonad_Trump Repeatedly walking past the same deplorable people &amp; Placing video in a loop does not make your crowd look bigger...it only makes you seem more desperate. Trying to manipulate your followers is not necessary, they are already committed. Your not picking up one new voter. #LOSER
Great! So sad-too bad it takes Democratic muscle to make trump’s White House do the right thing...now it looks like trump, Graham &amp; Grassley will back off their FBI manipulation.
@thedailybeast Sure thing...after he calls for probe into all trump’s sexual assault accusations. You first.
@BostonGlobe White male privilege speaking
@TIME White privilege talking.
Lindsey Graham &amp; Chuck Grassley are working behindthe scenes to manipulate FBI findings...”coverup”! @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SarahPalinUSA @ThaddeusArjuna @coleyworld @DonaldJTrumpJr @RealDonad_Trump @senorrinhatch @NBCNews @MSNBC @ananavarro @KamalaHarris @SRuhle @BillKristol
@GOP @senorrinhatch I’ll tempered, and a liar. Doesn’t matter if proven to have assaulted Ford. Kavanaugh is not fit to be any kind of judge because he’s a proven liar.
@maddow Hopefully Jeff flake and murkowski and Collins will vote no next week and make trump regret their deception.

@senorrinhatch Like Merrick Garland?
@GOP Yep! Just like Merrick Garland. Now STFU!

@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you know what a lying, cheating, piece of shit crook looks like? Look either at your Dad or in the mirror doofus. No worries; Kavanaugh won’t save you or your dad.
Called my senator and demanded the FBI be allowed to interview mark judge. If you feel strongly about trump stooges’ handling the Kavanaugh hearing, call your senator (202) 224-3121 and tell them how you feel. Time to get off the sidelines! Call now &amp; vote Tuesday, November 6!
@ItsMeCathi @realDonaldTrump Trump will likely be the rapist.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are slow. You don’t understand much do you. Keep your thoughts to yourself. Your as retarded as your dad.
Only an idiot would be distracted by a claim that virginity prevents sexual assault. Kavanaugh’s statement is irrelevant.
Kavanaugh states he wants a fair process yet he doesn’t support involvement by the nation’s premier fact finder (FBI). What he wants is to allow the “good ole boy” network to give him what has been given him his entire life...a pass. I say not only NO but HELL NO! #NoToKavanaugh
@Morning_Joe I feel like the country witnessed trump gambling with our lives while he played “chicken” with Kim Jun as elevated threats were tossed between them.
@SenatorCollins So do something for God’s sake! Step into the vacant role of “Maverick” and follow in the shoes of John McCain; do the right thing. #NoKavanough #ProtectMueller
@realDonaldTrump The term “greatest” starts by not having accusations. He nor you have any potential for being great at anything but lying.
@RepMarkMeadows You’re a joke of a public servant. Declassifying without concern for methods &amp; sources to support this criminal president is most irresponsible. You, Nunes &amp; Jordan are as complicit as Trump and you will all be held accountable in both November and 2020.
@gsmith3141 @ThaddeusArjuna @realDonaldTrump @GOP #resist
@GOP @KellyannePolls Oh please. If Kavanaugh wants to clear his name, no better way than involving the FBI. Otherwise, stop your whining.
I do! My hand is raised high. https://t.co/rO9LhVBgxu
@Morning_Joe if Kavanaugh is innocent then he should be calling for FBI participation; any such smear concerns would be thwarted by doing so. Kavanaugh is obviously not telling the truth.
Kavanaugh’s disclosure that he was a Virgin is not germane, and I see it as a distraction. Virgin teen boys think about sex more than any species on the planet; that, coupled with his discouraging FBI participation, is telling. He is obviously lying and the GOP knows so.
Took a break from Twitter to decompress after Twitter-fighting with trump supporters (exhausting effort when they don’t use their brain cells). Now I’m back.
Even more true today. https://t.co/KEpSfuUDNU
Mark Judge refuses to testify so he won’t lie under oath. He was witness to Kavanaugh’s attempted rape of Dr. Ford. If the charge wasn’t true, Judge should be eager to testify to clear his friend’s name. Kavanaugh and Judge are both liars. Tired of racist men and their privilege.
Did secretary Nielsen just start her comments on the storm situation with praise for trump? What’s wrong with these people? Are they fearful of trump or what?
Worth repeating: Paul Manafort “shall cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly...in any and all matters as to which the government deems the cooperation relevant.” Let that sink in.
So let me get this straight, trump can call for constant FBI investigations on Hilary but won’t call for FBI to investigate a legitimate charge against Brett Kavanaugh? Another example of trump’s divisiveness and misogynistic attitude. Trump: “everything but the right thing”.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Obama actually saved us the embarrassment of losing a court battle to Iran which would have looked badly. Faux news didn’t tell trump’s sycophants anything about that.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Emphasis on Faux cause ain’t a damn thing real about that fake channel.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr And Melania has posed naked, with other women and a lot of people are saying she was an Eastern European prostitute and nothing said by same evangelical Christians and right wing but jobs.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Forget about the elephant; I’m thinking the new mascot for the GOP should be the ostrich since the old adage “head in sand” is apropos.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr And...the best example of humanity, dignity, and descency. Entire country misses the leadership shown by obama.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL
@DonaldJTrumpJr No one is falling for Kim’s lies and the trump lies. Both are a disgrace to the world.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Trump family are biggest liars in American history. Lying treasonous criminal family that is trump mob.
@SarahPalinUSA Fake news
@FoxFriendsFirst She is correct.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Fake news

@DonaldJTrumpJr Your the prince of fake news and your Dad is king. Trump’s created fake news.
Mark meadows, Devin Nunes, trey gowdy, Jim Jordan, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan &amp; the GOP at large are all complicit in the most consequential coverup of the sellout of America. All are treasonous bastards.
@ringoskid @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce That was kind of funny

@ringoskid @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce https://t.co/JAEzgpnAuS
@ringoskid @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce Trump won’t even meet with Kavanaugh. Oh yeah he’s done for sure.

@ringoskid @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce Slow train wreck with Kavanaugh, and trump’s ego as the main casualties.
@ringoskid @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce By the way, Thursday vote is already off. Not this week baby!
Since trump won’t govern for all then the people have to take control to ensure their voices are heard. Trump will not have his way over the majority.
@SovietSergey Dasvidanya comrade sergey. Your asset in our Whitehouse has proven a productive tool for you and the Russian federation. I would like to propose to your leader, putin, that the orange mole has been compromised. Suggest you recall him immediately before the walls close in on him.

@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump has done something he’s never done since in office; he has been completely silent about manafort’s deal to squeal. Zero tweet referring to manafort since last week. Trump is scared. Trump is the 1,000lb grouper that mueller is setting the hook in. Big fish Donnie.
@KateBekx @DonaldJTrumpJr @robbystarbuck Dear I only claim to know what the majority thinks. Operative word is the majority. Trump’s supporters are in an ever shrinking minority.
@ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Not to mention nearly no one attended his inauguration. Crowd size at that pitiful event was weaker than a Barnum &amp; Baily big top event in a small country town, sad.

@KateBekx @DonaldJTrumpJr @robbystarbuck You don’t but majority do. They love him.
@KateBekx @DonaldJTrumpJr @robbystarbuck Yes they do
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr His intent matters kind of like facts matter. Trump is compromised. He’s in Putin’s pocket.
@DeplorableDonn4 Sounds like a typical trump supporter- no fact is good enough for you but what trump says is good. I haven’t seen CNN in 5 years but I’m sure they are reporting accurately on trump. Anyway, get back in your hole troll.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Thanks to the adults around him. Trump doesn’t know any details. Even so, trump delayed implementation for as long as he could. Congress had to step in and require trump’s hand (remember when he reluctantly signed the bill- congress’ bill by the way) &amp; signed it without fanfare.
@AllmenKaren @DebS96135026 @RealCandaceO Ok sweetie. Don’t be jealous-you can’t change my title; only make yourself crazy angry wanting to. I stand by my statement. Get back in your trailer.

Who knew we would have a lame duck President @realDonaldTrump less than 2 years in trump’s term. Along with a lame duck speaker of the house, @GOP really solidifies the view of their inability to lead over the last 12 years. Without a black-boogeyman, they are lost-Directionless.
@RealCandaceO We’re going to force the GOP to live by the McConnell rule; the people should have a say and we want to kick out Kavanaugh and have trump start over.
@foxandfriends @billmaher is correct.
The Kavanaugh nomination unraveling like thread pulled from a cheap sweater. GOP already reviewing the list of candidates. Trump secretly discussing plan B with his aides. This thing is a wrap.
@DeplorableDonn4 Hope that passion extends to bettering opportunities for people like her. I am betting it doesn’t.
@DebS96135026 @RealCandaceO If she stepped she did so right into the hands and culture that’s fighting to keep her on the plantation. See the reality that is trump and the GOP.
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles Have a great day!

@MattNovak4 @realDonaldTrump Opinion not fact.
@MattNovak4 @realDonaldTrump “Feels good, confidence, and planning on” translates to nothing has happened. Nothing. Workers have not received wage increases; just ask around. Maybe they will in the future but they have not so far and I doubt they will. Read the article, it supports what I’m saying.

@Proven_again @foxandfriends Go do it
@FoxFriendsFirst @DougLuzader No. The White House says the accuser should be heard. That doesn’t sound like standing by Kavanaugh. He is on a downward slope and I suspect he will withdraw his nomination by next Friday.
@ThePlumLineGS @LauraLitvan @spettypi I know damn well trump nor anyone on his team will be questioning the credibility of anyone considering trump has more accusers than any politician in history and justice has not been served to his disgusting self.
@washingtonpost But trump does have the insecurities of a teenage girl. Even teenage girls will tell so. Keep your focus on the issue at hand...trump.
@GinaRankin6 @Altanana @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce You are correct sir
@FoxNews I want to see trump’s tax returns.
@Altanana @GinaRankin6 @foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce ...is good for the goose. We will do whatever it takes to stop trump. Your constitutional argument doesn’t hold water, ie Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland.
@Proven_again @foxandfriends Start their with all the lies trump has told and fact check each. That will keep you busy .
@Proven_again @foxandfriends Oh bless your heart...you want to check facts? How bout starting with your president. Check his facts/lies: show taxes (lie), didn’t pay porn star (lie), 16 Puerto Rican’s died (lie), didn’t know about mtg (lie), tough on Russia (lie), obama Muslim(lie), tax cut pay raise (lie)..
@Proven_again @foxandfriends The more you fight the harder we will push. Knocking down trump’s administration until only crumbled rubble remains or him out of office. Either way, we going to show you what petty looks like. Getting trump out by any means necessary.
@AlpacaLibby @foxandfriends Only applying GOP behavior of last 8 years of obama to trump. When obama was potus you loved every minute of ridicule but now it bothers you. See how hypocrisy feels? We are giving trump twice what he and the GOP gave out. So get over it. Donald J Trump can eat dirt.
@DICEY63 @foxandfriends Like I said, deep in the sand.
@Proven_again @kudenchi @foxandfriends What do back communities have to do with anything? I’m white.
@Proven_again @foxandfriends Doesn’t that statement you just made insult your own intelligence considering what lengths trump is willing to go to deceive you? Really, when, not if, but when you learn trump has lied to you the whole time, how will you react? Kavanaugh is a symptom; trump is the problem.
@DHSgov @realDonaldTrump How can you square this with the POTUS saying don’t snitch? Trump calls people who snitch a rat. The president use mob code and encourages the citizens not to cooperate or tell when they see something. As a citizen, I demand my president go back and reverse his statement.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst That must have been very painful for you to hear him say obama gave a decent e economy. That is more true than he even admitted and he lied about low income workers getting raises because they aren’t.
@realDonaldTrump Now that’s a yuge lie. Let’s hear from the Steele industry. They say otherwise. You open your mouth, a lie falls out.
@foxandfriends Dems been trying to tell you trump friendly fools that for a while now. You just won’t listen. Go ahead and keep your head in the sand if you want; we will have trump out by Spring...your welcome.
@kasie All we need to do is have FBI find other guys that we’re in the room and interrogate under oath. I’m sure they will corroborate her claims. Cant expect Kavanaugh to tell the truth when he already lied like the boss that he serves to aid in avoiding justice.
@foxandfriends @HeyTammyBruce Problem solved by Kavanaugh backing away from nomination or better yet never having accepted the nomination. He should have made a stand and deferred to Merrick Garland. Kavanaugh will only help trump evade justice. He caused this on his self. No sympathy for him.
@realDonaldTrump Ok fat-Donnie. Just because you say it don’t make it so. The country more likely knows it a lie if coming out of your mouth. If true then small businesses would be professing such profits and wage increases but they aren’t. Silence. Crickets. Economy ain’t better because of you.
@foxandfriends Stop the press. Hold up. Apply the brakes. Cease fire. Wait...no vote on Kavanaugh. Reject Kavanaugh. Reject trump’s nominee. Reject the illegitimate president. Resist.
@Variety Interesting
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles Your last sentence is absolutely accurate.
@realDonaldTrump Federal law enforcement is also professional no thanks to you tearing them down. Remember you claim the law &amp; order title, so shut up about the great job DOJ &amp; Mueller are doing...better idea, you should resign immediately without delay; save face &amp; the GOP by slithering out now.
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles Only one is enough. I don’t like tax evaders. I don’t like racist bigots. I don’t like narcissist. Trump is all that and more. Don’t care about Benghazi grandstanding.
@PizzaGateLibya @DonaldJTrumpJr @GenFlynn Insulting me make you feel better? You don’t need to know what I command. know that trump is a creep &amp; criminal. will crawl back in my hole when trump is brought down to my level and justice is served. The law &amp; order president will taste some law &amp; order. Trump crimes to light.
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles I won’t agree but I will not argue against it if it will shut you and trump fans the hell up. I think it will be as enlightening as the Benghazi waste of time and $$ but if that’s what it takes. I just want justice served and the process allowed to finish with trump.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr What exactly is conspiratorial about trump never saying a bad word about putin because the Helsinki sycophancy trump showed putin had entire country scratching its head, even GOP. Yeah if you disagree with that then you really are in the minority view. Keep your head in the sand.
@Cannon46Trent @RealDonad_Trump Thought not. Just checking.
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles Hey I tell you what, I agree to do whatever you want to Hilary after we are done with Donald j trump. So sure, have at it. We gonna geterdone with trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Junior, nothing and no one can do or say anything more embarrassing or stupid as your dad, besides you of course. Donald j trump is the king of creepy as he walked in on those teen girls while they were undressed during the pageant. For America, just STFU!
@realDonaldTrump Your poll numbers suck. Your followers are starting to see through your BS. And those that are too stupid to see, won’t amount to enough votes to make any difference for you. Your a terrible president and person. You will be remembered for how bad you are. #TFA
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump is a reluctant participant in his own administration. He’s so obviously Putin’s puppet that everybody is saying Hilary called that one right.
@Cannon46Trent @RealDonad_Trump Are you actually betting me that Donald Trump “Will” throw paper towels at Carolina citizens? Really? Just want clarification. My contention is that trump won’t dare do that.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @JeremyStolz256 @DonaldJTrumpJr Everything trump has done was with resistance and delay by trump himself. Even so, trump has never said a bad or out of the way word against Russia like he demanded obama do before Russia elected trump. Trump is a reluctant participant on anything Russian. He kissed Putin’s ass.
@Luke0566 @foxandfriends @michaeljknowles Prosecution has been consistently performed for generations; their job is to uncover criminal activity regardless of the initial crime, and the process will not be changed or modified for trump. No special treatment for trump; he wouldn’t want it cause he’s law &amp; order, right?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are correct. Google can do what ever they want.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr That’s the point. GDP should be better as it continues what it has been doing for over 8 years now thanks to Obama’s (get out of recession) policies. Your welcome.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr I Iove the “at this time” caveat lol
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr I can’t continue arguing for the sake of arguing. The chart reflects all you need to know about the overall health of the economy. That’s why the Dow Jones is used over, say, the S&amp;P500. You may be able to keep this tussling going but I got other trump supporters to fight. Later.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @KentHorton @DonaldJTrumpJr You can help us out by providing names of such sources that you think are non-bias. I’d like to hear them (I’m open to other good sources).
@Rpmahaffey @KentHorton @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Tell me something...when all I said about trump is proven to be fact by someone who you will believe, what are you going to do? Will you believe or will you continue denying the obvious to everyone else?
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @drdocdoctorson @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL. Halfway descent is as good as I would expect from a trump supporter. That’s as good as a submission. I’ll take that.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr LOL
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @drdocdoctorson @DonaldJTrumpJr So if bush policies were better and allowed to continue, the country would have entered a certified depression. Was that better? Obama saved then improved this economy.
@KentHorton @Deletethemedia @ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr But this ain’t no movie.
@foxandfriends @michaeljknowles So your telling me the “law &amp; order” President is not supporting the prosecution of a man (manafort) with decades and current criminal activities? Should crime be fought no matter the criminal? Is trump saying manafort should be allowed to avoid justice? Is trump two-faced?
@thinkprogress Federal judge needs to hold her in contempt and give her jail time.
@LMAO_in_Fla @DaftErroneous Larry is struggling internally with his own gay tendencies and is acting out as a form of concession.
@zoe_samuel First, I agree your assertion about tucker. Second, he more likely only slept with the woman he married because his annoying personality is a dead turn-off. Third, he is also creepy. Fourth, he speaks from a point of sexual frustration, so his own wife won’t sleep with him.
@sahilkapur Anyone but a trump-saving Kavanaugh will do. Just don’t want someone who will let trump avoid justice. Doesn’t matter that all else is the same. I’ll take it.
@foxandfriends These three Faux news knuckle heads are more than funny...”weak field” really. Really. Anyone or anything will be a better choice than Donald j trump. And I mean anyone or anything. If the choice comes down to trump and a mannequin, the lifeless dummy gets my vote.

@TwoTrumpQuotes @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr The chart tells them everything they need to know but trump fans perform mental warfare within their own heads to not allow themselves to acknowledge what they know to be true. Denial is a real condition. Maybe the mantra “facts matter” should be repeated to them hourly.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Sure did, slowed the economic free fall we were in and took us from somewhere around 8,000 to 20,000 which is close to where trump took over. You just are not succeeding in rewriting history. Obama save our economy and trump hasn’t don’t more than flat performance so far.
@Deletethemedia @ThaddeusArjuna @KentHorton @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr You sound like Morpheus talking to Neo
@ThaddeusArjuna @KentHorton @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr Amen
@KentHorton @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr This is not difficult nor is it in dispute. Use whatever you want; just don’t make it up yourself.
@KentHorton @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Use the term as loosely as you chose. Find anything in print available to all and has a editorial board, staff, or something that is nationally known. This is not hard. Trump sucks and is at the bottom of any presidential comparison and obama is at the top.
Bubble bubble, toil and trouble...witches a rage in trump administration. Someone help me out here; if Paul Manafort is not the final catch and mueller is in seek of larger fish, who would be higher up the food chain from manafort? Hint: it’s 300+lbs, orange, &amp; has a yellow spine
I bet @RealDonad_Trump doesn’t toss a singe paper towel roll at Carolina citizens when he visits. Bet you any some of money he doesn’t....Bet me!
By the way trump lump, the numbers are not up for debate. Not up to you fool. Shut up about it; stop tweeting; and just shut the hell up! https://t.co/tzZcIiFiQH
If trump ends another statement with “no collusion” I’m going to flip a table. Guy has said it so many times I’m expecting to hear it on every occasion. Does he think he can hypnotize American people by saying it repeatedly? Maybe/should try dangling a pocket watch while doing so
@AdamsFlaFan @cam121269 @politicususa Ain’t this the truth. Trump tweet and golfs and nothing else but campaign; never stopped campaigning and never started governing. Worst and most petty POTUS in American history. Sad for kids looking to model country’s CEO. Sad for America. Sad for Allies. Sad for the world. #SAD
@jnizzle44 @realDonaldTrump Nice chart. Trumpians continue to deny. They’re suffering from whataboutism and are stuck on stupid; must be contagious and spread through television airwaves &amp; digital cable cause they all caught a case directly from trump himself as he continues spreading dumbness nationwide.
@drdocdoctorson @ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr I think you can agree what an incredibly positive trend we had under obama. So many forget how bad it was in 2007 &amp; 2008 when obama took office January 2008. Never understood how GOP and trumpians can discount that fact. Divisiveness worsened under obama due to his opposition.
@tedcruz I don’t dislike you personally like most but I do dislike your politics (you grandstand at any given opportunity, you don’t stand for anything and move Ike the wind, and you did a terrible job standing up to trump especially when he insulted your wife). I will be voting for Beto.
These are the Americans that died due to hurricane Maria and lack of response/leadership from the dear leader Donald J Trump (Grade: F-). You are all complicit. #Shame #TFA @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SarahPalinUSA @SarahPalinUSA @GOP @RealDonad_Trump https://t.co/YsZnc87MSv
@drdocdoctorson @ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok I apologize for the insult. Didn’t mean that really and am sorry about that. I get frustrated from chatting with so many trumpians who typically deny facts as facts...If you can see scale on the chart, it shows trump’s 2 years as near flat. Not my data but the economy itself.
Hey...whoa...is this thing on!
@thesopranos6 How do you like my “fish rots from the head reference”? I see your tony soprano cover pic :)
@drdocdoctorson @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Dow Jones
@drdocdoctorson @ThaddeusArjuna @Rpmahaffey @DonaldJTrumpJr Look genius. If trump made any difference, the trend line would not continue its linear path upwards where obama guided it. It would be more exponentially upwards (curve more up) but it doesn’t. It appears in same general direction as if trump had zero difference which he didn’t.
@BarneRamshackle @CurtisIngraham1 @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle @CNNPolitics Same as law enforcement has to do with what trump wants. Good enough for him to demand investigation on his opponents; I’m pushing for folk I don’t like just like trump.
@drdocdoctorson @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr It’s not a left or right issue; it’s the truth and fact. Not alternative but fact. If you watched anything but Faux news you would already know.
@BarneRamshackle @CurtisIngraham1 @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle @CNNPolitics If you feel so strongly about his issue, you should be speaking out against Laura’s supportive stance on trump’s policy separating kids/babies from their mothers at he border. You sound more hypocritical than concerned about kids being taken. Kidnapping is exactly what trump did.
@mesamuelson @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Yep and yours runs deep

@neighborwatchin @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr By the way trump never worked a day in his life. Tweeting and golfing do not constitute as work so don’t kid yourself dear. You can be mad but be ready to lose your precious crook to resignation, impeachment, primary, or general election. I prefer impeachment.
@neighborwatchin @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Nah. I think we will send trump there or to Russia after impeachment. Trump out! Any means necessary.
@Cannon46Trent @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr I want failure if it takes that to remove trump and I stand with millions in and out the military. We are the many; we are the patriots who value leadership and decency. Out with trump by any means necessary.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr You call it “acting like a child”, we call it exercising the right to voice opinion and ultimately voting. We will do just that. Trump has two choices: get impeached early next year or voted out the year after. Either one suits the American people. There.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Charges for the biggest fish are always last to occur and after all bait (manafort, Cohen, gates, Flynn, papadopolis, trump org business manager) is exhausted. Won’t hear any proof until all trump’s crimes have been delineated, subpoenaed, and charged. Sorry but trump is toast.
@KentHorton @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr All you need to do is find a ranking of presidents from any periodical to see obama ranks far beyond trump. Obama is always in top 20% while trump is consistently within the bottom 3 of all presidents. Go ahead; google it yourself and get back to me...I’ll wait.
@JeremyStolz256 @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Don’t here me making any excuses for past presidents. Don’t make anything right about current President. One thing is certain; the last president showed the highest of moral character and that’s what is so strikingly different now. I want a person I can respect as POTUS.
@KentHorton Political Commentary; I was fire lol (just kidding)....was a marine combat corpsman prior to becoming a SWO (surface warfare). Loved every minute. I see you were an armorer. I shot my share of m60s, m209s, 50cal, 9mm, and others. That’s what’s up.
@mesamuelson @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe I’ll see trump on the aisle as the main feature. He stinks with criminality. His administration rots from the head.
@mesamuelson @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Ooh I can feel the hate lol, or is that right wing tears? Your feelings hurt cause precious trump is being disrespected? Trump sucks yugely! He’s probably on phone whispering sweet-nothings to putin as we chat lol. #TFA
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Everything trump benefits from is thanks to obama (especially the economy). America thinks obama is the best not trump (google any poll). Trump is most divisive. Your upside down and backwards in your facts and your thinking. No surprise if you wear MAGA gear. Wake up see reality
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes I am a racist and so are you. We all see color. It’s just that some of us treat others differently because of it. I bet I’m more empathetic and open-minded than you are. Did you hate obama for his color? I hate trump’s for his policies, attitude, narcissism, and divisiveness.
@accgod2003 @SaveNavyPeacoat Mustang actually.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr His only policy is to undo the Black President’s policy. Trump is doing nothing else but tweeting and campaigning. He is utterly useless for sure.
@axios Wow really! So like all I need is for Donald (god damn) trump to have direct access to me and my family’s cell phones so he can use the system for personal gain to plead his case against mueller and throw shade on what he thinks is fake news! Great. Trump really sucks! #TFAnow
@sonyadish @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle They found it all. After mueller ties it all together in a bow so nice it will choke you, it will be released. It’s going to be earth shattering when it comes out. Trump fans are going to take it very hard- Brace yourself. It will be mueller’s gift to the nation. Popcorn on ready
Does trump really have a college degree? Really? Or did his dad pay for the school to lie. Why never any classmates interviewed? Nobody knows the guy. Can’t find anyone who knew him in or around any university or college. I have investigators looking and have info in coming weeks

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Not enough/not as much as putin gave trump for years of puppet behavior (trump smiling the entire time). Boy was Hilary prophetic when she stated “trump would be under constant investigation for being a Putin’s puppet”. I love obama is getting paid and relaxing; can’t be touched.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Zero success at distraction. Trump owns collusion lock, stock, and barrel. Laser focus, the country is, on trump’s criminal enterprise. Lock him up along with manafort, papadoplis, gates, Flynn, Cohen, Jared, J.R., and hopefully Donald J himself. Take them down!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Because the focus is on saving the country from trump and his bullshit that’s why. We ain’t allowing distraction. However, nice try.
@JacobAWohl My god such an empty expression from a Russian agent &amp; sympathizer. You are really showing your ignorance or stupidity I’m not sure which (maybe both). Oh well, hang on to your trump-god; I’m sure he will lead you to Nirvana lol.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Bless your heart Jacob. Sorry but everyone knows obama is intelligent. Sorry but that ain’t changing because you don’t like him...now your boy trump is as dumb as a box of rocks. He can’t be any more stupid. Trump is “basement I.Q.” Type stupid. So dumb he don’t know it.

“Deep state” are the hero-patriots of the modern era....soon trump will be unraveled like a cheap cloth rag and exposed for all his crimes (tax evasion, money laundering, conspiracy, perjury, threats to bodily harm, a foreign agent, and masquerading as a legitimate businessman).
...power to the people. It takes patriots to stand up and take action to a man that has been identified as a Russian sympathizer. They are adhering to their oath “to protect and defend against enemies, foreign and DOMESTIC” and I applauded them for their efforts. #CountryFirst!
“deep state” as the pig in the whitehouse is referring to is a misnomer and a first for our nation. It is more accurately a response by sensible patriots to the idiocy that is trump. He is threatened by those who resist foreign manipulation/interference and thwart his efforts....
@Joe38958631 @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr No other example of decency matters but the leader of the country. Starts with him first. If trump shows a thread of decency then we can discuss others. Don’t care about any other indecent act but the guy in the Oval Office. Trump first.

@SeanFoley11 @Jodyturcotte1 @RedNationRising Refreshing? Nothing trump has done has any impact on your life. I bet there’s been zero change in anything you got going on since trump took office except your love of your dear leader.
@moldyjellie @Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr No excuse for the president to be indecent. Leadership starts from the top not the bottom. The balls in trump’s court.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Decency from the highest office in the land is dead. Used to be acceptable to go high when others go low; teachings of Jesus predicated on such turning the other cheek. Sighting others misses the point (two wrongs don’t make a right). Trump should not retaliate even if right.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr Tell me, do you think wapo is not actual facts because trump says so? Do you have your own opinion?

@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr That’s the point. Decency is no longer since trump-entered the scene. Anything goes now. If you have young ones, we should want for better examples. Personal life matters for the leader of the free world; always has and always will.

@MarkDoldon @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr I’ll take full responsibility for ivanka; they can leave her with me. Take the rest. She can work for me in a skimpy maids outfit and do odd jobs around the house lol. I’ll make sure she is properly disciplined.
@Rpmahaffey @ThaddeusArjuna @DonaldJTrumpJr my best theories: trump has laundered Russian $$ for many years (it bailed him out of bankruptcy); trump has committed statutory rape; trump lusts after ivanka; trump evaded taxes; trump associates with the mafioso; trump cheated on every wife; his I.Q. a low 80- his fans lower.

Trump can’t run on the economy because he knows the house of cards will soon give way and crash to the ground.
CNN and Quinnipiac polling suggests trump’s base are the only Americans that support him with his approval rating matching numbers that equate, percentage wise, to the size of his base. Trump is in trouble and is scrambling to push even more lies to save the senate and himself.
I hope Trump’s FEMA is more prepared now than they were for Puerto Rico. It took celebrities and the kindness of the American people to provide most of the aid they got. Trump either can’t or hasn’t learned and still has no clue. Trump’s negligence is impeachable.

It won’t change trump’s dropping poll numbers or America’s negative view of trump and his swampy family. #TFA #VoteDems

@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Economy is better because of obama. Job growth was faster and is not as fast now. Business confidence is only higher now as part of racial resentment that led white America to vote for trump and keeps them from admitting they made a mistake now. White CEOs are complicit. #Racism
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Wrong. This is Obama’s recovery. Trump is only wrecking our economy.

@CindiTurchik @SarahPalinUSA Group think is being afraid to admit your made a mistake voting for trump and continuing to fall all over his feet even when he says things you never agreed with before and won’t agree with when another says it. You swallow trump’s cool aid on the daily...hahah laughing at you.
There’s the Bob Woodward book, Omarosa’s book, michael Wolff’s book, James Comey’s book, David Frum’s book, the NYT’s Op-Ed, Stormy Daniels &amp; Karen McDougal hush money, Puerto Rico response, taking-babies at border, banned from funerals and weddings...trump is a disaster! #TFA
@TuckerCarlson Spend your time trying to pick apart what obama has done and says but you only make yourself look bad in the process. Great leaders like obama will continue using inspirational language only future leaders won’t be black, so I guess you won’t have a problem when they say it. #TFA

The man endured more than most will in a lifetime.
@Jen80092294 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk thank you for for the gratitude. I did serve (near 26 years)...I am not saying trump is the enemy necessarily but am saying he is divisive, without moral character, mean &amp; petty, and undeserving of respect generally. Everything I was taught and learned prevent me from liking him.

@rickbigmoney @SallyEileen1 @senorrinhatch @senjudiciary Trump was set up for success thanks to obama.

@noname21500262 We were and are talking economy; watch how quick it grinds to a holt when congress figures out they have to pay for the unprecedented spending trump is doing but without tax revenues because trump has given away our income to corporations. Just wait till spring for budget talks.
@yenotbre @GlennThrush More likely they are blind to any since of descency or leadership. They’d rather see through their hate filled lenses within themselves. If obama where white they would have sung his praises. Instead, nothing he said could penetrate their black hearts.

@BradMossEsq @AngryFedupVtr Trump failed to factor costs with overall objective. Popdock (whatever), Flynn, manfart (stinky), and gates are all minnow fish/bate; $2 million per day is well worth taking trump down cause we save over 3 billion not having to build a stupid wall. #impeach

@juliajenson24 @BreitbartNews Look at trump’s history; there is much evidence of his ignorance and stupidity. Starting with the first of his administration where he pressured Sean spicer to make NPS manipulate/photo shop inauguration photos to support his lies per inspector general report. Lying is not ok.

@PhiferRita It sounds like you and I agree on more than we disagree. I would only ask that you hold trump accountable for his behavior and when he gets it wrong like you would have done for obama. I voted for both bushes and Reagan but my eyes are wide open to what trump is doing.
@PhiferRita Military seeing any doctor started under obama (sorry to tell the truth on that one). Trump’s only agenda is to undue the last guy. That is petty and what the other side means when stating that trump is tearing or dividing the country.

Trump will never see a cause bigger than himself. He only cares about himself and himself only. Nobody else matters to Donald J Trump. Our country is suffering folks.
A backdrop of nearly all white male police officers makes not a picture of consensus in this great country. That my friend is part of the problem.

@RealKingMyers Prolly show him my hands just prior to throwing them; jab to his right eye and right hook to his left temple. In short, I’d lay him down. Immediately there after, I’d look over my shoulder cause I’d have to handle mike pence next. That’s just what I feel...leave me alone S.S.

Sen Kennedy is correct about his assertion the country is divided. The basis is anger; too many African Americans have never been able to share in the great wealth in this country (not economically, not socially, not culturally, and not spiritually). It has been a game all along.

@RepKarenBass @chrislhayes Why not sue trump administration and have an emergency session of the Supreme Court to force a remedy satisfactory to those children?

Stand Up America: Kavanaugh's SCOTUS confirmation hearing starts TODAY &amp; your senator could make or break this fight. Call &amp; tell them to vote NO: 844-762-8687
@SarahPalinUSA I’m going to try a little trumpian whataboutism here. What about trump campaign funds that took in hundreds of millions of laundered dollars from Russia and other criminal activities plus donor money that he uses as his personal slush fund. All that and he won’t pay his own bill.
@619cenaa @Nike False equivalency and false choice but oh well. Long as it’s not my money burning lol.
@619cenaa @Nike Have always been offensive to some.
@619cenaa Nike will not only survive but flourish
On Nike/Colin, everyone has an opinion on what is considered patriotic but most have never served. If you care to listen to those that have, we are telling you we served and fought for each American to have that right; your just not listening. I applaud Nike. More should follow.
@BewleyRemodel @darrenrovell If I had my way, the only votes allowed on what is acceptable or not regarding patriotism would be from those who actually served. Veterans stood up to ensure this right and are the only voice worthy of respect on the issue. The rest of you argue about something provided to you.

@jeffpayne1108 @BewleyRemodel @darrenrovell I agree brother. As a vet, Colin has my full support as any other American has (kkk for instance which I don’t agree with but have the right).
@BewleyRemodel @darrenrovell Yes. We will.
@AnnCoulter You would be far more useful to our nation as a talking-head if you didn’t troll the majority of American people like your idol trump. Trump’s reign will not last forever and the country will eventually need to be put back together. Play nice now. You would do well to remember.
@Over_the_Sassie @SarahPalinUSA Only saying Americans commit 99% of crime in America and are by far the biggest threat. For nearly all of us to remain safe is to simply not tread into a crime infested neighborhood (a luxury poor folks don’t have). Just keeping things in perspective. Trump needs to focus big pic
@Ma1973sk @Nike Is that all you got from Colin and Nike even after they stated the reason behind the protest? We will never come together as a country if we chose not to acknowledge the other’s view. I take them at their word like you take trump at his...I’m sure they will be fine without your $

I love sea bass!
Fish fraud is real people.
Still not understanding how trump who purports to be the law and order president nationally states that he really thinks like a mob boss and believes one shouldn’t snitch...I think law enforcement’s motto is “if you see something, say something”? When will he be held accountable?
@SarahPalinUSA By the way you never apologized for costing McCain the republican nominee because of your going off the rails with your “paling around with terrorists” comments.
@SarahPalinUSA Take him down and take down American citizens who are doing the same and many more incidents and much worse severity. Don’t bias your opinion only toward an occasional incident when you ignore thousands of citizens committing crime daily.
@Dragonstar028 @Jodyturcotte1 @realDonaldTrump I think we will pack him up and get him out of the Oval Office. If he wants to move to Moscow that’s completely acceptable by the American people. Don’t be mad; just be.

Hey trump lovers, let’s assume there was bias in the FBI; if so (and that’s a big if), one bad apple doesn’t spoil the whole bunch. If it did, then the trump train was spoiled along time ago and every damn apple is rotten to the core. Still have more confidence in FBI than trump.

@RealDonad_Trump Your pathetic... a sorry, pathetic little man. If we all say we like you and your great, will you resign?... you first; I promise I will say it after you leave. Come on man, let’s not make this anymore painful than it has been over the last 20 months. Please, I’m begging you.
@APWestRegion @AP I like this guy.
@ReutersPolitics @Reuters Who knew they had a trump supporter on that jury. It must have been excruciating for the normal folks on that jury to have to witness such stupidity which is par for the course for MAGA pukes.
@FoxNews @Rep_Hunter This guy is using trump’s playbook or is in denial or thinks the public is just that stupid and for that I hope he goes to jail when they convict him.
@ItsMeCathi when it comes to trump, i like the way you think.
@ItsMeCathi Let’s see the info!
I rather enjoyed watching trump perjured himself into a corner.
@Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr So.
@realDonaldTrump And you violated campaign finance law, and laundered money, and conspiracy. So there’s that, but I’m sure you good.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Thanks obama!
@IvankaTrump Hope you get indicted after your scumbag Dad and brother.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your such an idiot. Didn’t fall far from the tree.

The witch delegation passes on Donald J Trump lol. https://t.co/SroU2M4LNE
@TC4eva @RealDonad_Trump The devil is a lie. Donald J Trump does not know the truth.
@GlacFreeze @RealDonad_Trump @HillaryClinton LOL. You still crying about Hilary lol. I thought Dems were the ones to be mad but it appears trump cult members have Hilary syndrome (Hilary keep coming out of your mouth- you miss the woman lol)... you are correct though, Hilary is coming for trump lol.
About to corner this grand-witch; captured many of his witch clan and he is going down soon. https://t.co/cEU3tjDkYY
@RealDonad_Trump You suck.
@FoxNews @POTUS It’s like your in a bubble...the world has zero respect for us because of and because of trump. Faux news saying it doesn’t make it so. If trump is impeached though, the world will respect America’s commitment to the idea of democracy and the systems ability to right itself.
@Reuters Enjoy!
@FoxNews @POTUS “Trump digs hole”
@FoxNews @Scaramucci It’s clear as mud. It will be tested... by the way, please stop parroting trump’s lawyer and letting the right use your network as its platform. Try  acting like an unbiased news organization. Get rid of Hannity, ingraham, fix&amp;friends, tucker, &amp; the judge. Start from scratch.
@NPR Just means he lied to Congress a second time. Only not under oath this time.
@ABC If this guy had operated on me I’d be looking for signs of work defects, signs of failure, and checking for recalls.
@FoxNews @POTUS Because you find one or two black guys and strategically place them in your background doesn’t make the African-American community want to support you. It only makes them wonder what the hell is going on with those two black guys.
@FoxNews @POTUS At this point, trump is toxic and all he does should be put on hold till his situation gets sorted out. Just freeze cause I didn’t vote for no crook. Seems he manipulated and I ain’t haven it.
@FoxNews @POTUS Yea I think Obama was done wrong. Now that trump is becoming more clear every day for the criminal he is, I think I’ll vote DEMs all the way down the ballot this time. Trump is taking my country on a ride home of us want to be on so he’s got to go.
@robbystarbuck @DonaldJTrumpJr Citizens kill more citizens yearly. Gave up on GOP this year. Trump has ruined a descent party and is on track to ruining race relations, the economy, trade, the environment, and the country generally. But hey, the rich and corporations are well so there’s that. SMH
Take my clearance to; shove it up your loose, wrinkly ass! https://t.co/zAgvwTqpgl
Now for other trump crimes:	Money laundering, conspiracy, RICO act violations, etc.
Trump is guilty!
Trump is going down! What a great Christmas gift to America!!
Trump is guilty! Let’s talk about that before we talk about how he will attempt to get out of it.
