@frisbee_dennis @carloslcurbelo @leocosionews @GOP Also, did you know that the only reason that houses continue to be built in these areas is because the federal government offers low cost flood insurance where regular insurance companies won‚Äôt? The government is using taxpayer money to rebuild these homes over and over again.
@frisbee_dennis @carloslcurbelo @leocosionews @GOP China and India have made a lot of progress in reducing emissions! Sadly, famine is already occurring due to climate change.

@frisbee_dennis @carloslcurbelo @leocosionews @GOP We have made excellent progress but the rate of change is still too slow. We need to decarbonize faster to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
@Flux_Capacitor1 @carloslcurbelo @GOP I had this same question. The federal government offers low cost insurance in places where regular insurance companies won‚Äôt or price it so high it‚Äôs unaffordable. The government is artificially subsidizing properties to exist where they shouldn‚Äôt and taxpayers are paying for it.

@texecon @JasonBordoff There is no way to cheat the system other than to switch to renewable sources of energy. It is not cap and trade. It uses price signaling to correct the problem and allows the market to decide the best way to decarbonize without government regulations.
@texecon @JasonBordoff There would certainly be people that would need to be hired to administer the dividends (same process as income tax refund). The cost would be small in relation to the revenue collected and would be self funded. It is a market based approach to addressing carbon pollution.
@texecon @JasonBordoff The model of carbon tax that is best for low income is called carbon fee and dividend where carbon emissions are taxed at the source and 100% of that revenue is given back to households in the form of a dividend. Check it out.
@texecon @JasonBordoff Yes, but the dividend would represent an even higher percentage of their income.

@thehill What kind of person opposes endangered species protections?
@RobPDiaz That may be true but if it weren‚Äôt happening why would big oil companies acknowledge that climate change is real and that burning fossil fuels is contributing to it? And why would they advocate for a carbon tax?
@RobPDiaz I think most people, not just Trump, don‚Äôt know very much about climate change. When there are climate news stories happening I check conservative outlets to see if they are reporting on it and they never do because their viewers don‚Äôt want to hear about it.
@RobPDiaz You‚Äôre right. The change can‚Äôt happen overnight. Check out the solution that I posted. It is market based and doesn‚Äôt grow the size of government or increase regulations.
@RobPDiaz I think even if we disagree on climate change, we can agree that switching to renewable energy is better for the environment. The link I posted is a solution to do that in a way that works for all sides. Even Exxon, BP, Shell, James Baker, and George Shulz support this plan.
@RobPDiaz Also, taxpayers in these areas are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to raise the roads and install pumps to combat sea level rise. Miami Beach alone is paying between $400 and $500 million to do just that. Investors aren‚Äôt paying for this, WE ARE!! Doesn‚Äôt that suck??
@RobPDiaz Wow I really butchered the word appropriately
@RobPDiaz Why do you think it‚Äôs a scam?
@RobPDiaz I had this same question because it didn‚Äôt make sense. Then I learned about the Federal Flood Insurance Program that offers low cost insurance in areas where private insurers either do not provide it or offer it at aprroptiately ridiculously high rates.
@scott6171 Thanks!
@scott6171 And thank you for taking the time to talk with me about it. I really appreciate it.
@scott6171 Yes, sounds crazy right? Check out the Climate Leadership Council @TheCLCouncil. It is a group of conservative voices that are advocating for this revenue neutral carbon tax. The tax is returned to households, not oil companies or government.
@scott6171 And the oil companies will actually be really hurt by a carbon tax but they realize that we need to reduce carbon emissions.
@scott6171 Who is telling you there is no warming?
@scott6171 Why do you believe we can‚Äôt affect it? Even most climate skeptics don‚Äôt argue that putting more GHG in the atmosphere causes warming. Did you know that even Exxon Mobil supports a revenue neutral tax on carbon?

@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Yes, the tax increases slowly over time so individuals and businesses can reasonably plan and adapt. What incentive do you propose that wouldn‚Äôt involve bigger government?
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Also, scientists are telling us we‚Äôre not reducing our carbon footprint fast enough with business as usual. Are you aware of the negative impacts doing nothing will have? I‚Äôm asking seriously because a year ago I had no idea and wished I would have learned earlier.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Most people would get more back. The others could choose to pay more or reduce their carbon footprint. Here is a link to the findings of one of the non-partisan studies done on a revenue neutral carbon tax: https://t.co/4biMsWtFLO
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol It‚Äôs not force. We tax cigarettes and people still smoke them because they are free to do so. I read number 9. Most proposals that I know of increase the tax amount by a fixed amount slowly over time, which they say addresses the issue.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Businesses would have the incentive to switch to remain competitive. There are non-partisan studies that show that not only would this plan significantly reduce emissions, but also boost the economy with the dividend checks. If there is a better idea out there I‚Äôm all ears.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Oh I see. Are you saying people would complain about getting smaller dividend checks? Yes, that would be a hypothetical problem in the distant future. The good news is that the climate would be doing better.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol We already have the technology. What we need is the will to change. A price on carbon that would be returned (not kept by government) would do that. It would be predictable for businesses too. CLC‚Äôs proposal might allow a future increase but not all proposals do.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Ending all energy subsidies would not get Republican or Democrat support, which is why no one is proposing it. I‚Äôll read point 9. Doing something is at least better than doing nothing. Did you know in Miami Beach alone $400 million is being spent to raise roads and install pumps?
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Thank you for taking the time to look into it.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Government involvement and taxes should be avoided if others aren‚Äôt being negatively affected. In this case, the government has artificially reduced the cost of fossil fuels and even the cost of flood insurance. Normally, I would want the market to work it out but time is short.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol It might not be a perfect solution but is better than doing nothing. The government has already chosen the fossil fuel industry as a winner. This levels the playing field. I would prefer ending subsidies for both. Good things are happening with renewables but not fast enough.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Declining revenue for who? I think the ultimate goal is that there would be no revenue because that would mean we‚Äôre leaving fossil fuels in the ground. If they are saying the government would keep the money, legislation would be required to do so.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol People in the country have less public transportation options but they also tend to consume less goods, which would help them also come out ahead.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Also, this isn‚Äôt creating bigger government. There are no new regulations, agencies, or government spending with this plan, which is why Republicans like it. This is a market-based approach that makes renewables cheaper. The market will fix this faster than government can.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Thank you for respectfully engaging in conversation and asking questions.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol The government still has to work within the law. If the law is written to return 100% of the revenue, they have to or pass new legislation to change it. A revenue neutral tax on carbon has Republican support. Even Exxon and Shell support it. https://t.co/UpqhAEhpSY
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Considering natural factors alone, we should be entering another ice age. Some warming is good but too much is really bad. Reducing CO2 is something we can control if we choose to. Also, billions of taxpayer dollars are already funding this whole mess, which should be stopped.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Good questions. The dividend would be monthly. Lower income households tend to have smaller carbon footprints and would receive more dividend than increased cost. The 100% revenue return would have to be written into any legislation that is proposed.
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Also, volcanoes can actually have a cooling effect (more aerosols in the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space).
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol None. There is a solution for carbon fee and dividend that would do the trick. https://t.co/tSWfQziaPw
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol Scientists are telling us we need to reduce emissions even more to avoid the worst effects of climate change, which we are already starting to see. Also, the current administration is trying to undo everything that allowed us to cut emissions by 7%. Do you agree with that?
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol The US has the second highest greenhouse gas emissions. Second only to China. Climate change is already negatively impacting even us through more intense hurricanes, more flooding, wildfires, and sea level rise - just to name a few. This costs billions in taxpayer money.
RT @MarkRuffalo: One in sixth deaths worldwide is from pollution. We can get to 100% renewable energy. https://t.co/iyTgD5fbZI
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol The government is already subsidizing things that created the climate crisis. For example, huge subsidies for coal, gas, and oil. Also, do you know who pays for it when Florida floods? The federal flood insurance program. Should those continue?
RT @leapingotter: @exxonmobil RT if you agree: #fossilfuel companies lied to the public about #climatechange
@Apathycase @HuffPostPol True, but how does it hurt to join? We need to do something to address the climate crisis. What do you suggest?
