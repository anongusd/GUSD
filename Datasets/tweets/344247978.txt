@billstolpe3 @thistallawkgirl Trump seems to be brandishing a pentacle, not a cross, and he left a hammer and sickle backstage.
@jennflanagan @thistallawkgirl Don’t say that.  Trump is just A FACE IN THE CROWD.  Besides, IT CAN’T HAPPEN HERE.
@CuteLazy_Panda @thistallawkgirl Yeah, but he’s really shaky on the cross.  It looks more like a pentacle he’s brandishing.
@thistallawkgirl Second entry:  “Mr. Trump, you can’t do that here.  Where were you raised?  You should have relieved yourself before you walked on set.”
@kim60312603 @thistallawkgirl Makes me sick after Trump faked an injury to avoid serving in the military, and doubly sick now that he has sold out this country to foreign enemies.
@thistallawkgirl “Counsel, please explain to your client that he is being taken into custody, whether he clutches the flag he has forsaken or not.”
@NakedTreePhoto @thistallawkgirl Beneath contempt.  Check out his entry in Wikipedia for some of the sorry details.  Matt hurried to join Trump’s eunuchs so fast he knocked over other cultists.
@_MichaelEM @thistallawkgirl Liar Trump, always ready to bend over for Russians, tries to con Republicans into thinking he loves the USA, by wrapping himself in the flag, when he steals from the Treasury and attacks the press and the legal system every day.  He sells us out to the foreign rich.
@thistallawkgirl Republicans who joined the Trump cult because they’re afraid.  I’ve opposed their “reward the rich, and never question business” policies, but I thought that more regular Republicans loved American democracy.  They fooled us by wrapping themselves in flags, pretending patriotism.
For sure. https://t.co/wBd0qqwWus
@KatiePhang Clean up the corrupt mess the Republicans have caused, by hiring lobbyists to run the agencies they oppose and by giving jobs to unqualified children of the rich.  Find out exactly how rotten it has gotten.

@emptywheel The Republicans look and sound like they've been snorting cocaine.
@kubrabenelli That one guy was throwing questions at him in such a rapid-fire manner that it seemed that he either wanted to put them all in the record without any answer from Cohen or wanted to confuse Cohen.  They will forever be known as "dead horse beaters".
I wonder whether other Republicans will continue cutting off Cohen's answers, even though it's obvious that he isn't stalling.  I know that they're going to continue calling him names, but they need to treat him with civility.
Having heard only three Republicans at this point, admittedly with the sound turned down, they seem to be unaware how boring they are and how nasty they sound.  What's more, several who haven't spoken yet, keep giving people dirty looks.  Some photographer needs to document that.
Jordan still is trying to win the 2016 election.  In a sense, he's forced to do that, because more people are deciding that former Secretary of State Clinton in fact won the election.
I have chosen a strategy to counter the Republican lies and obstruction. I will turn the sound way, way, way down when hard partisan ideologues like Jordan and Meadows are trying to lie and obstruct, and I will turn the sound back up when everyone else speaks.

@GolfSoBad I have a bunch of anecdotes from that campaign.  I learned for the first time why people plugged their non-electric cars into their houses.  I wished I had brought my cross-country skis.  I wanted to go on to NH, where I wouldn't have bumped into Sanders, but I was sent up to SD.
@GolfSoBad I guess that's called a "dusting" of snow.  That winter of 1988 was cold in Iowa.  I had flown out to Des Moines from southern California.  I was given a car and sent down to Fairfield.  The first night, I stayed with a couple  who each backed other candidates.  We went bowling.
@GolfSoBad We had a sprinking of snow today. the frozen equivalent of misting, and I thought back 31 years, to when I helped organize down in Fairfield, in Jefferson County, for Dick Gephardt.  I didn't see Sanders anywhere, there or in other states, that year. When did he discover Iowa?

@jdawsey1 Have you read any of Carl Hiaasen's comic novels about Florida?  In SICK PUPPY, a lobbyist gets his just desserts, in SKINNY DIP, a guy who pushes his wife off a cruise ship on their second anniversary, and in CHOMP, an outdoor adventure reality TV star.  There are close to 20.
@JoyceWhiteVance That's an easy one.  With his short, stubby fingers, of course.

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Well, SDNY is federal.  You really need to talk about the work the New York state A.G. is doing, if you want to beat the cowed Republicans over the head with "states rights".
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Hell, it's obvious--the failing New York Trump has been damning the investigation of Russia's conspiracy with him and his campaign since Day One--something other persons holding federal offices haven't done (the most Nixon said publicly was "one year of Watergate is enough").
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Old man Giuliani was gone from the SDNY office by the time Berman put in four years as an assistant there, but they worked together much later.  Berman did "volunteer work" for the Trump transition, which probably is why he can't oversee the investigations of the failing Trump.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Alternate analysis:  the failing New York Trump has been dropping references to "McCarthyism" into his public statements lately.  He may be getting his slogans from a biography of Roy Cohn--I know he doesn't read, but does Donald listen to audio books?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Thanks. man.  A real public service.  I hope you caught Stephen Colbert's report on the "national fantasy" declaration by the failing New York Trump--he and Jon Batiste agreed that Trump kept hitting B flat with his singsongy rendition of possible judicial review.

@bookheart @essenviews One more thing: some of the senators have been inching away, because they can tell already that they individually will be in trouble. Gardner, McSally, Tillis, and Ernst are most often mentioned, but I'd add some others. Collins might decide not to run; she'll lose if she runs.
@bookheart @essenviews that a few of the older ones will NOT run for re-election next year (Alexander has announced that already), some are filthy rich and will coast on incumbency, some are hard ideologues (Cotton) and will never diverge from Trump, or Pence if lightning strikes.  Any questions?  6)
@bookheart @essenviews the individual Republican senators have moved so far away from previous positions, about policy or about Trump himself, that there indeed may be things being held over their heads, but I think that the sources of massive campaign contributions control them more.  Keep in mind  5)
@bookheart @essenviews discipline is even tighter.  What puzzles me is why MORE registered Republicans, who have access to other information sources, fail to question some of the squirrelly moves of the regime and the demonstrable inability to recruit more qualified persons to work there.  Some of  4)
@bookheart @essenviews You need to look at each of the 22--some are leaders, but most hew to the party line.  In recent years, that line has been delivered over Republican TV, Fox--when it began, the people running it REQUIRED the news anchors to cover the Republican talking points daily.  Now, that 3)
@bookheart @essenviews What Trump and his gang have on ALL of them is his continued high support from registered Republicans.  While there's been erosion, there's been less than I'd have expected, and I've been active in politics for more than 50 years--if one bolts, Trump will support an opponent.  2)
@bookheart @essenviews I'll try to answer your question.  First, those are just the ones whose terms end in 2020.  Others will be up in 2022, or, like Scott (yech) or Cruz, were elected last year.  A few on that list are not OLD, of course (McSally, or Sasse), but have gone along with everything.  1)

Stop stoning the young woman.  I see her comment as clumsy, not "anti-Semitic".

Hey, stop.  It isn't "anti-Semitic" to criticize AIPAC.  Perhaps it would help if the criticism is given more context.  AIPAC has resembled the NRA, through its support for and opposition to candidates.  https://t.co/r4qQAqsUe4 https://t.co/lb9crsLjB8
@CharlesMBlow Sorry.  I thought you were referring to politics generally, not to black people.  There has been a recent discussion of the use of the term generally.
@CharlesMBlow After all, during the Progressive Era, people fought against the economic Trusts.  Perhaps folks are choosing to hark back to those days, instead of allowing others to dismiss them as "libruls".
@CharlesMBlow Folks only are admitting that the campaign Republicans have run since the Roosevelt administrations to blacken the term "liberal" has succeeded, just as the shorter campaign against Hillary Clinton (which began when she was the wife of the Arkansas governor) did.
Did I really say "open mike" instead of "open mic"?  Folks, please forgive me, because immediately before I did that I advised Rick Wilson to call Pompeo "Mucho Pomposo" instead of "Mike"--I had "mike" on my mind. https://t.co/HIlJt2eL4k
@2020Bluevoter @jmartNYT You got that right.  I told him he should save that line for when he gets up enough courage to show up at an "open mic" night.
Why don't you bite the bullet and show up at an "open mike" night instead of trying out your routines on readers?  I throw off comments too quickly at times myself, so it's easy for me to recognize when others do it. https://t.co/XIbsJ0QH9s

You'll love every moment in Glendale, Arizona until you're attacked by one of their sadistic police officers. What, they don't like me calling them "sadistic"? What do you call someone who tazes an unresisting person ten times, then pulls down his shorts and tazes his testicles?
@MollyMcKew She plans to stay there, I hope.
Let me correct that:  they say that you'll LOVE every moment, until you're attacked.
Glendale, Arizona.  The tourist office says that you'll enjoy every moment, but it fails to add "until you're attacked by one of our unhinged police officers".  https://t.co/WLqAJ3fKqB
Glendale lies next to Phoenix.  If that police department defends such barbarity, it would be wise to stay hundreds of miles away from the place.  https://t.co/T6JEToJbjU https://t.co/KmJajC0XDB
The man was a passenger, not the driver.  The car was parked, and the man's wife and two children were in the car.  No serious police officer can defend this barbarity.

@thistallawkgirl So true.
@thistallawkgirl Much of the discussion has referred to a man's private part touching porcelain, but has overlooked the problem of possible touching or scraping the rim of the toilet seat:  https://t.co/KBz7MRsq6Q   If you're going to make fun, you should not ignore that possibility.  4)
@thistallawkgirl solo sexual activity while in the privacy of a bathroom (I refer you to a particular scene in the film "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as an example of such solo activity).  https://t.co/ahUemsCb7E  You may not read men's magazines, which is why you haven't till now.  3)
@thistallawkgirl at times, men and boys need to use the toilet when their personal part temporarily is enlarged due to sexual activity, whether alone or with a partner, and a standard-size toilet seat might chafe or scrape that sensitive area.  At times, men such as Whitaker might engage in  2)
@thistallawkgirl So glad you asked.  A number of articles have explained that project when referring to the various scams with which Whitaker has been involved.  https://t.co/kP1SUdAyW4  Whitaker is a big person, and toilet seats usually come in standard sizes, but there is another reason why: 1)

@Wonkette @EvanHurst Well, he's there physically, looking more than a little constipated, but mentally he seems controlled by some outside force.  Whitaker is weak as hell, afraid to answer direct questions.  Sure looks like he was ordered to play "rope-a-dope" in front of the committee, to stall.
@yruwhining @jdstigall @KellyO Anyone who refuses to believe that CNN detailed someone to watch Stone's house for DAYS, as CNN has represented and as the person who was there has said, is a tool.  That feigned ignorance is the hallmark of a tool.
@KellyO @SenRickScott Who the hell cares, about playacting by a corrupt Senator?
@KellyO You mislead your viewers in a number of ways. First, on Whitaker, you FAIL to say that he came to Sessions from a right-wing foundation. Worse, you also joke about Trump making reporters like you to grab at him when he leaves, instead of holding regular press conferences.
@craigmelvin  This is worthless, putting a "friend" of Whitaker on the panel appearing during your hour-long program--not only is Whitaker playing "rope-a-dope" before the House Judiciary C ommittee, stonewalling and misusing executive privilege, but his buddy stalls before you.
