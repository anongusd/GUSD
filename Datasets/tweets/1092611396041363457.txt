Suspect in Salinas_CA robbery is wearing a gray hoodie black shoes with white souls, and a backpack. Basically he's dressed like Trayvon Martin, but with a ski mask and white gloves. 	#LivePD #LivePDNation #LivePDFans #livepdwatchparty https://t.co/ZZONbaT9GQ

@Stacyrr92 It was real quick. Either he passed gas or he has a noisy car seat.

@CBSNews Illegal immigrants broke the law to get in the country. They don't like that they were detained. So they have a hissy and refuse to eat.

@NBCNews Bill de Blasio could have been a leader and helped to encourage Amazon to stay. That's tens of thousands of jobs. Instead he forgot that Amazon could always say no. So now people won't get those jobs. de Blasio failed his people. #AmazonHQ2 #BilldeBlasio https://t.co/morgF6i35l

@GodPrevails17 @PaulaBRoyce1 @POTUS In fairness...if the public schools are teaching it then it's probably getting taught wrong anyway. They'll go in for the #Sharia, and end up learning about cherries.

@benshapiro Well, on the plus side. His lies may get rid of a show I didn't watch anyway. So Maybe it'll get replaced with something I might actually care about. #JussieSmollet
@catturd2 That sounds a lot more real than the crazy story Smollet tried to pass off to the cops. Clearly this is why he's an actor and not one of the writers. #JussieSmollett https://t.co/QtHcTCOXd2
@benshapiro Let's face it. #AOC is basically the Democratic party's bizarro version of #SarahPalin. Sarah Palin would say things that the media pooped on but would turn out to be right, and AOC says things that the media loves but turns out to be 🦇💩 crazy.
@MsAvaArmstrong @realDonaldTrump I'd definitely support that. Of course the rub is that this is basically what the Dems did during President Obama that cost them the Senate and the House. So...I guess they didn't learn anything then. #Budget2019 https://t.co/tvx9Zd8adM

@markbland As strange as it is to say this. The women's wrestling has actually started to become more entertaining than the men's wrestling in the WWE. I'd rather watch the women in the WWE than the men anyway. To think we're only about 10 years away from the women being a joke in the WWE.

@cs00582scs @ChristalSweets @POTUS I hate to explain them both this way, but Beto was the creepy guy always lurking in the "friend zone".

@CassyWearsHeels @skynnergoin If he'd just genuinely be like, "Yeah. I was stupid, but at the time it seemed funny. I regret it now, and I cringe when I see it." I'd be okay with letting him stay in office because it was a long time ago and people change, but he doesn't seem to really mean it.
This doesn't seem to be a hard choice. We can side with the people that just want to live their lives, or we can side with the group that wants to murder everyone. This is like choosing between cake and a root canal. 		#mondaythoughts https://t.co/7gAZ3FXoyg
