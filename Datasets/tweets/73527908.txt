@BernieSanders i hear you and you navigated the trappy waters of that interview masterfully not alowing questions on things that e have not got to yet and remaing on message #feelingthebern
and not to mention how gerrymandered al thess districs have been for years
into other counties not just Robinson
because they as in the poll workers were telling certain people that they didnt have to correct ballads for folk to fill out and cast their vote on was told to return later only to either get the same answer or they were already closed so this probe needs to reach into other
cast votes in Tabor because  whn folk showed up they were telling them that you cant vote because they as in the poll workers were telling certain people that they didnt have to correct ballads for folk to fill out and cast their vote on was told to return later only to either
been going on for years and not just Robinson County but Columbus county as well these past mid-term these small poor very rural  parts that are close to the south Carolina Myrtle Beach boarder Imid-terms lots of lower wage and Afro amer voters were not even able to cast votes

and im confused to  why would you attempt to unto another country only to come back for 500 bucks, and what sense does it make for these guys to say something if in 1 hour they would have been released.
and now you say from the start law enforcement had their doubts, and again i say if it is found to be true then the tow brothers were totally knowdlegable of the entire process so i dont see where they become vitcims
so if a person hires a hitman doe that me the hit man goes free
this interview only make this case even more blurred.  so you telling me that the rules have changed that if 3 people rob a bank now only the ring leader gets charged now..since you have so much phone evidence then why arent the other two being charged
now on the other hand if in fact he is factionally found guily then he should be dealt hit lawfully wrong punishment as well as all others involved

im lgbt all day and african american from small town south carolina and i will be the first to tell you that its been proven time and time again that majority of straight african american folk are the hardent and are the most against the gay community
omg her brain in tucked underneath that soiled wool coat that he walks around it all day long...i mean....OMG
@morningmika  @Morning_Joe  her comments just make no since to sit here and hear her say that trump is misinformed in bs and demoralizing to all our educated minds sometimes you have to call a spade a spade she really tried to make light of trumps dividness
im confused as to why he is not yet impeached?.....we have a sitting president that went to flint to support and celebrate the gov who was on a political and personal journey to delete and entire city of people and that was years ago and he still there
and i think its such a dis-service that some media host cant even have an adult conversation with entertaining their viewers thoughts without getting all snappy and soggy because they feel some type of way we all get it wrong sometime but we learn from that i hop...I KNOW I DO
in my world race sex nationality or any other cultural definig lables play no role in my thought process i would have the same opinion if this was a gay straight man woman white lack green or alien sometimes the media just dive in right is right and wrong is wrong
an please dont take my tweets as an attack but to be honest all the small talk thats been given on this case no matter what way you word it it still sounds like he is being branded as being in the wrong and thats just not right
this is why i love you @morningmika and @Morning_Joe  due process to me it dont matter if you black white male female dem rep and im not saying he is wrong or right but all digital we've seen in 2 vids and non with him in it

#fact @POTUS white man, wealthy, has been accused of sexual assualt and gets to be president with nothing said
#fact vanessa alerted scott of this in 2017 if true then why would he sit on this info until 2019 when this guy is about tobe elevated to gov? also why would a sexual assault victim put trust in her story to someone who is at the sametime known publicly of be accused ofsame thing
#fact days ago scott states that quote "Allegations of sexual assault need to be taken seriously, I have known Professor Tyson for approximately a decade and she is a friend. She deserves the opportunity to have her story heard" and quote
#fact fairfaxs accuser as well claimed she was a sexual assualt victim of his as well in earlier years she claimed she was a sexual assualt victim before that of fairfax HUMMMMMM
#fact  scotts accuser  alleged she was sexual harassed by him but also in a past account the same women tried that in Chicago against another public figure which both panned out to nothing or a falsehood
#fact if you compare the two ladies account of things in my opinion it looks as if they edited the scandal against scott by replacing his name with that of fairfax and changed the victim name from macherie to that of vanessa
#fact dec 2017 d-va @BobbyScott was accused of sexual assault by former aid named Macherie and at the same time he is notified by a lady named Vanessa who reportedly stated that she was a sexual victim of @LGJustinFairfax

Anybody who thinks that in order to beat trump you need to be better on twitter  or the mic has gotten the standard for president all messed up it's supposed to be about who can move the country forward
It's fierce Trump tweeted more in support of these foolish teens who are clearly mocking but showed no sympathy for the kids that were running for their lives in these school shootings. Mr Trump you are the scum that sits on the top and bottom of the swamp
Let me get this right trump defends rapist and racism. Tears kids from family's and locks them in animal cages works for a foreign radical power lied his way out of military duty because he was sacred and weak and got the nerver to say that trans don't meet military reddiness smh
How can you say that this is the land of the free whenever certain. Groups of American citizens are still being targeted for example by people who are too dam scared to give their life for the USA AND TOO Dam lazy to get a dam job
Why should it matter what the next person has between his or her legs.  These people choose to dedicate their lives for our safety and security and it's a dam shame how you take a truck and just run right over people's lives just like that
So sad that it's 2019 and we live in a country where we some of our peers who are legally born citizens still have to live in shadows because of silly ass simple minded people who can't accept others lifestyle.

these folk can say what they want to say, pretend they don't notice, or sounding their dull but very clear "dogwhistles". These same fabricated ill will and or ill gotten gains, that are obviously selfishly laced with toxins commonly known as greed, self-pity,unlawfulness, guilt

On May 5, 2016, Sater invited Cohen to travel to St. Petersburg in June to attend a forum as a guest of Putin‚Äôs spokesman. Cohen agreed to go but later backed out of the trip.
weeks before Trump clinched the Republican nomination!  "Trump would do so" ‚Äúonce he becomes the nominee after the convention.‚Äù Cohen responded.
and ‚ÄúBuddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it,‚Äù...Sater wrote in an email to Cohen dated Nov. 3, 2015.¬†Sater asked Cohen when Trump would be able to come to Russia,¬†On May 4, 2016,
Sater argued that it would help get Trump elected president!. ‚ÄúI will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.‚Äù
2015 ran the idea of a real estate deal in Russia to Cohen, according to emails the Trump Organization provided last year to the House Intelligence Committee.
Cohen‚Äôs guilty plea tell us in a number of words that FelixSater is Individual #2! Facts!Felix Sater, former broker for the Trump Organization and a Russian immigrant
Given the golden nuggets from Cohen....its about to hit the fan
