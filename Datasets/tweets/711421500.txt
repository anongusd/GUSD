@beyondnothing74 OECD comparisons between single and mulit payer systems. Multi payer costs significantly more per capita. That's a fact, you can look it up. 		And mind you most of thos systems expressly outlaw any for profit health insurance. Does your solution do that?
@beyondnothing74 If you think a public option doesn't cause massive ripples you're kidding yourself. But it only half solves a problem and allows the continuation of immoral profiteering from suffering.		Not cookie cutter treatment, just a guaranteed right to get the treatment they need.
@beyondnothing74 Also your way costs unnecessarily more money.
@beyondnothing74 Your solution is some people get one kind of care. A different group gets different care. A third groups has different care. Can you ensure each system will provide the same quality and affordability? 		Why can't we just keep it simple and cover everyone equally?
@beyondnothing74 Sounds like you're saying young people don't deserve healthcare... why can't we drop the Medicare age to 0? Why are we dividing people by age. Healthcare is a right for everyone. 		If the ACA had been Medicare for All we wouldn't have lost Congress and Trump wouldn't be POTUS

RT @SenSanders: Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
@dantonnoriega @neeratanden It might be, but it wouldn't offer a full choice of providers. It would also be means tested which adds to the cost of the entire system.		Pretty good is not good enough. Why are we settling when better coverage also costs less and saves us all a lot of headaches?
@Alex__Katz @_waleedshahid @neeratanden Read the actual bills buddy. HR676 and S1804. Then come back. 		Copays don't actually reduce usage by any metric. They just increase costs. 		Turns out people don't like going to the doctor unless they absolutely have to. Who knew?
@sukatra @cry_twombly @neeratanden Keeping a multi tiered system costs us all more money. Risks poorer care options for more vulnerable communities. Creates cracks where people fall through. 		Your selfish desire to chose a plan that is objectively worse causes harm to others. That's just bitter spite.
@beyondnothing74 You really think we'd leave folks with disabilities out in the cold? Come on now.
@beyondnothing74 When we say #MedicareForAll we are referring to legislation. HR676 in the House and S1804 in the Senate. Technically it's "Improved and Expanded Medicare for All" but that doesn't exactly work on a bumper sticker. 		No need for waivers, it's covered.
@sukatra @cry_twombly @neeratanden Wouldn't it be great if y'all never had to do that again and could see any doctor, or dentist you wanted? 		I also know a lot of folks whose job offers 1 option that you have to take.
@newyorker_expat @GovHowardDean That's a broad statement considering those countries have much higher per capita cost than say Canada or Australia neither of which seems to be opting for a switch from single to multi-payer. Also most of those systems expressly outlaw for profit health insurance.
@beyondnothing74 I'm well aware and every #MedicareForAll proposal addresses exactly that concern by eliminating all copays and premiums. They also cover 100% of the cost instead of 80%. 		The proposals are free care at the point of delivery for every American. Period.
@syrrruup @neeratanden The PO is also subject to the whims of the present government. Since changes to it don't affect everyone. Do you trust @realDonaldTrump to do a good job administering a public option?
@syrrruup @neeratanden The problem is if you keep the rich powerful health insurance companies in place they will use their power to buy politicians and ensure the public option is insufficient.
@newyorker_expat @GovHowardDean #MedicareForAll is perfectly workable and less of a government controlled enterprise than the NHS which is a fully socialized healthcare system. 		What benefit did you get from private coverage? Did you cut in line?
@neeratanden @_waleedshahid Again why the unnecessary complexity?
@neeratanden @_waleedshahid Does your proposal guarantee that Medicare Extra will be affordable for everyone? What's the premium going to be? What about people that can't afford that premium but make too much for Medicaid?
@neeratanden @_waleedshahid Choice of insurers is irrelevant. Choice of providers is what matters. 		No one has the time or desire to read the fine print on a private health insurance policy. Nor do we like renewing every year. 		#MedicareForAll allows patients thr maximum possible choice of provider.
Those who oppose a #GreenNewDeal have to tell us how they're going to pay for the damage extreme climate change will cause. 		The question has never been "how can we afford too?" The question is: how can we afford not to?		Opposing a GND is fiscally irresponsible. https://t.co/WBEkNoFykb
@newyorker_expat @GovHowardDean How when it's the same resources and facilities being used? Private insurance doesn't build more hospitals or train more doctors.
@cry_twombly @neeratanden I haven't met anyone in my work concerned about choice of insurance policy. Folks don't have time to sit and read the fine print on different coverage options. What we care about is choice of provider. #MedicareForAll allows maximum choice of provider. That's what counts.
@neeratanden And that justifies the added cost and complexity? 		Public option proposals run the risk of creating a two tiered system where the rich opt out and leave the PO as a dumping ground for the sick and poor. This could lead to providers opting out of accepting the PO.
@newyorker_expat @GovHowardDean Allowing folks to opt out creates a two tiered healthcare system where the public option becomes a dumping ground for the sick and poor.
@neeratanden You also need to wrestle with the fact that multi-player systems are more expensive and more complex. It's less efficient and for what benefit?	Mind you a lot of employer sponsored plans are poor options with high premiums, deductibles, and copays. Folks hate them.
@BungalowBILLcom @neeratanden @rosadelauro @janschakowsky That's exactly what S1804 proposes to do over a 4 year period.
There's a lot I like about @SenSherrodBrown, but seeing him talk about "Medicare at 50/55" instead of #MedicareForAll just makes me wonder why he doesn't think providing quality healthcare for my generation should also be a priority. Young folks get sick too. Stop dividing people

@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @GOP @NYFarmer I don't really have extra money thanks to the capitalist idea of treating education as a product instead of public good.
@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @GOP @NYFarmer Capitalism with the support of labor and sizable public investment did that. How much can be attributed to the internet alone?

@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @GOP @NYFarmer Perhaps I misread you. 		My mistake, it's just you seem to have so much to learn about capitalism and government.

@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @GOP @NYFarmer Also when is capitalism finally going to work so that nobody starves to death, or dies because they can't afford to see a doctor? 		Might be a great idea in theory but no one has seemed to make it work yet.

@JohnDPeck @djere @justicedems @AOC @GOP @NYFarmer John your ignorance is showing. China doesn't own the bulk of our debt, Social Security does. We owe most of it to ourselves... China owns the plurality of foreign debt, but not even a majority of that.
@JohnDPeck @djere @justicedems @AOC @GOP Cutting benefits for Congressmembers would have no significant impact on the Federal Budget whatsoever. Come on John, be serious.
@JohnDPeck @djere @justicedems @AOC @GOP Cutting corporate welfare is not austerity, this is a goo idea. Those funds should be invested in education and infrastructure. 		Undocumented immigrants already pay taxes, but with a path to citizenship they would indeed pay more. Good idea.
@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @GOP You need to read/listen to Mark Blythe's "Austerity: the History of a Dangerous Idea" 	In the Eurozone after 2008, those countries that cut the most and did the most austerity ended up in the most debt. Cutting spending shrinks GDP and thus increases Debt/GDP. Basic fractions.
@JohnDPeck @djere @justicedems @AOC @GOP You seemed to oppose a common sense solution to raise revenue to close the deficit. Am I wrong and you do support a 70% top marginal tax bracket? 		What does "sell your heritage" mean?		Also our Federal Government is not a small business. Nor is it a family. Bad comparisons.

Two years ago to the day I laid out my case for what we now call the #GreenNewDeal and declared my candidacy for the US House. A lot has changed since then, yet the need to address the crisis of human caused climate change in a just way remains the same.	https://t.co/oxKXL0doDG
@JohnDPeck @djere @justicedems @AOC It obviously doesn't concern you or the @GOP otherwise you'd be in favor of raising the revenue to close it. All I've heard even mentioned from the other side is austerity policies which only lead to more debt. You can't cut your way to growth or a balanced budget.
@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC If we could similarly invest in education, research, and infrastructure like we used to we'd very likely see similar returns on those investments.
@djere @JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC Nope I'm stating that high tax rates did not stop growth. However the argument follows that the investments that flowed from those receipts did indeed bolster growth. 		Taxes are not punitive. Certainly not those at the high levels of income.
@JohnDPeck @justicedems @AOC @djere On incomes over $10 million? Of course. That's about what it used to be when we had the best economic growth, employment, and wage growth in our history. We know for sure that tax cuts don't help anyone but the wealthy.
@AOC That's it folks the internet has been won. It's been a good game. Pack it up let's go home. Game. Set. Match.

So if DC and @realDonaldTrump want to tax our taxes and make NY fund the rest of the US, we can tax the rest of the county's stocks to get some of our money back. For context: ~$16 billion is also the total annual budget of the @MTA. ~$18 billion is our Medicaid contribution. 2/2
Something missing from @NYGovCuomo's remarks yesterday on #taxes and #SALT was NY's stock transfer tax that is still in existence and collects some $16 billion every year and then refunds it to Wall Street. The kicker here is a big chunk of that is paid by people outside NY. 1/2

@thaeox @_waleedshahid I mean carbon neutrality is a waypoint between where we are now and being zero emission.... which was also the goal out forth by the Gov. (Good lord I'm defending Cuomo here...)
@EnvNY @RepStefanik What about the #GreenNewDeal? We have 130 months to get off fossil fuels. What's the Congresswoman doing about the climate crisis?

@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie I've been on that plan myself a few times and never had a problem. I've had worse problems with private health insurance than I ever had on the public system.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie It's not magic when every other industrialized country on the planet has been doing it for decades. 		It's about cutting red tape and inefficient corporate bureaucracy, negotiating bulk prices for prescription drugs, and diverting folks from the ER into preventative care.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie And that is an extreme right wing view point. That's to the right of Angela Merkel and Thearsa May and they are both very conservative leaders. It's also a viewpoint out of step with the majority of Republicans.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie I'm not painting you. You're just using tired talking points put out there by right wing ideologues.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie Your Assemblymember, Senator, Legislator. I used to do constituent services it's a regular part of the job. And unlike a private company, if you get bad customer service, you can fire them.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie All of those countries have MORE, not less government involvement in healthcare than we do. 		Moderates understand that there are things the private sector does better and things the public does better. Healthcare like infrastructure, policing, and firefighting is the latter.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie Medicare efficiency is 2% the private sector is 10 times less efficient with a 20% overhead. 		Our country spends more tax payer dollars on healthcare than all but 3 countries in the world. And we spend twice as much per person total as any other nation.
@JohnDPeck @marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie We're talking about moderates here John. Most Americans don't share your far-right anti-government ideology they just want healthcare that works at a price that's affordable. 		Also you're making up facts about government efficiency that might feel true, but are in fact false.
@marcmolinaro @pmdemola @AdirondacKatie Indeed folks want reasonable solutions like Medicare for All which is supported by 70% of Americans. They also want term limits and money out of politics.

@JacksonLasarso And yet he did. The State Party doesn't put out a hit piece like this on its own. If what you're saying is true why would the party do this in its own instead of fighting the GOP? Especially when the Gov has already laid out something like $20 mil from his own campaign?

BREAKING NEWS from the mouth of @NYGovCuomo himself. He is NOT RUNNING for President in 2020. #NYGovDebate
@PensiveTM @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders They shouldn't be included in delegate counts because they don't get a vote. Perhaps they will be included if a brokered convention looks likely, but the way the primary season is set up a brokered convention is very unlikely
RT @NomikiKonst: Eh hem https://t.co/Zs32yXJ22a
@PensiveTM @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders Even if super delegates were eliminated from the bylaws (which I support doing) the folks who are currently SDs would still have influence over public opinion by virtue of their governmental, or party position. We can eliminate the hard power, but the soft power will remain.
@PensiveTM @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst I mean yes Democratic Governors, Senators, Representatives, and party leaders do have an influence on public opinion. That's why it matters to take an interest in who those people are. @Ocasio2018 should she win in November will be a super delegate. @SenSanders is too.
Watching every candidate for #NYAG in the debate tonight try to get a piece of @ZephyrTeachout. It's clear she is getting the front-runner treatment and that's because she is the best candidate to be NY Attorney General by far and the rest clearly know it too. Vote on 9/13

@triplevito @GenePeyroux @theladychuck @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst I am worried about the same. However I think there'd need to be a massive change in the primary schedule for that to happen.

@DOdell85 @AlyJohnsonKurts @Ocasio2018 @nikhilgoya_l @ZephyrTeachout @JumaaneWilliams As did I, I did pretty well too. 	You're confusing human rights with constitutional rights. Congress has the power to provide for human rights (think education) even though those rights are not in the Bill of Rights which are restrictions on state power. Different kinds of rights

@GenePeyroux @theladychuck @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst We haven't had a second ballot since 1952 which was about 30 years before there were even super delegates. It's a major victory for the process and for progressives. Can we do more? Yes. But don't let perfection be the enemy of progress.

@JodyCoyote12 @PaulSorrentino3 @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst Effectively they are no more. Not in the way we have known them. They're still going to get to have credentials for the convention, and I think that's totally fair.
@PirateEdwardLow @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats They effectively eliminated with this rule change. Their endorsements will be simply endorsements with no impact on the delegate count unless we go into a brokered convention which hasn't happened since 1952. That said watch it happen in 2020 now.
Ok ok ok @TheDemocrats have EFFECTIVELY gotten rid of #SuperDelegates because since 1952 the first ballot has been the ONLY ballot. #NotMeUs 		I was super excited when I got the news and should have added a word there. Super Delegates as we have known them are indeed no more https://t.co/eHfoOUHOdf

@DefyMasters @amend28th @NomikiKonst @DefundN @TheDemocrats The previous threshold included the super delegates. The threshold as far as I know is still 50%+1 on the first ballot. In the the new case that's just a majority of pledged delegates. Super delegates wouldn't be in that total because they can't vote on that ballot
@JohnDPeck @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst In the kindest view they also get high level party officials a seat at the convention without having to run against grassroots activists. Thus allows more activists a place at the convention. I'm being super charitable here. Honestly they're stupid in my view.
@JohnDPeck @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst Their inception was inspired by the nomination and defeat of George McGovern in 72. To prevent the nomination of "unelectable" candidates. Though they never did overturn pledged delegates. They always could have.
@DefyMasters @NomikiKonst @DefundN @TheDemocrats Yes she did. The super delegates helped in a secondary sort of way by endorsing super early and giving her the appearance of an insurmountable lead in delegates. She did however win a majority of pledged delegates.
@DefyMasters @NomikiKonst @DefundN @TheDemocrats There hasn't been a brokered convention since 1952 and still not since the modern primary system. Not saying it couldn't happen, but it is unlikely. It always seems to come down to 2 final candidates. The rigors of the primary season narrow the field on their own.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats @nydems @ZephyrTeachout Welcome aboard! PM me your county.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats @nydems @ZephyrTeachout Register and help us fix it! Run for county committee and start making good trouble at the meetings. That's how this vote happened. People stood up and said "No, this is my party too and I'm changing it!"
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats @nydems @ZephyrTeachout Yeah we have to fix that awful deadline. Be sure to register Dem before this October deadline so you can vote in 2019 and 2020 primaries.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst I don't have a problem with elected officials or any citizen endorsing a candidate of their choice. I've endorsed @ZephyrTeachout @JumaaneWilliams and @CynthiaNixon in  NY primaries. I wouldn't deny that right to any other elected official or party leader.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst My member of Congress gets to vote on election day same as I do. They can tell people who they are voting for or not. So can I. But with this reform they can't cancel out the votes of thousands with their one vote.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst So it's no longer official influence on the delegate count i.e. HRC getting some 400 delegates before Iowa even voted. But yes major elected officials and even celebrities will still endorse candidates and voters can decide if they care about that or not.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats @nydems I understand that, but I'm generally always opposed to concentrating more power in national bodies than is necessary. I'd rather see the decision move from state to local parties where the grassroots has more power. It'd be a headache to administer though.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst answered in 2 parts, first for context.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst Not that the media is honest (@NomikiKonst is better to answer this) but including Super Delegates in the delegate count in 2020 would basically just be lying to people as in all likelihood those super delegates will not get a vote. Their endorsements have persuasive power only
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst The last convention to go to a second ballot was in 1952. Since then all nominations have been decided on the first ballot. Under the modern primary schedule 2 final contenders basically have to emerge and one comes away with the pledged delegate lead.
@PaulSorrentino3 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats That's a state level reform, but there is support for doing just that in the reform package just passed. I'll be working on opening NY primaries in my new role on the @nydems State Committee.
@DefundN @_84Train @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst Why shouldn't elected officials be able to endorse like any other citizen? A Senator can endorse, but so can @Oprah or @SnoopDogg and under the new party rules all would have the same official influence over the delegate count on the first ballot: 0

@yusuf_VI I'm aware. That was the problem. This works to correct that as they won't have a vote to be counted.
@yusuf_VI They can endorse, but they don't get a vote. They don't get a vote. They don't get a vote. They can't be included in the delegate counts because they don't get a vote. Somehow you won't accept that. Is it perfect, no. Is it progress, tremendous progress. It's a win.
@audreyregan @tomwatson Agreed, doesn't mean getting rid of super delegates isn't a good thing. It's good for the party, stop making it about 2016, it's about 2020.
@jeffmatt_us @DefundN @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst I'm not the media, but my sense is no they won't because those votes are very unlikely to count or matter at all. Super Delegates will not get to vote at all unless it's a brokered convention which hasn't happened since 1952.
@yusuf_VI Yes it does. Those endorsements will not affect the first ballot vote totals that determine the nomination. Only pledged delegates count. Unless no one wins a majority of delegated, Super Delegates don't get a vote at all. They get floor tickets.
@Benny05 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats @jjz1600 @OurRevolution @ninaturner Indeed absolutely! Too many folks to fit in 280 characters.
@yusuf_VI If a superdelegate bucks her constituents with their vote, those constituents are empowered to find a new representative. 		And with these reforms that outsized influence is all but eliminated. The endorsement may be for persuasive purposes with the voters, but it has no power.
@audreyregan @tomwatson People of color want party insiders to have the power to overturn their votes? What are you talking about? Who wants obscene voter registration deadlines and inaccessible caucuses? These reforms are about making it easier to vote and for those votes to carry more weight...
@yusuf_VI They can declare that intent but it would be meaningless in the preconvention delegate counts. The majority of pledged delegates wins. Full stop.		The last brokered convention was 1952
@Benny05 @NomikiKonst @TheDemocrats Yes I covered this in a tweet below. Functionally speaking superdelegates as we have known them are no more. We haven't had a brokered convention since 1952.
@yusuf_VI I mean every American is free to endorse whomever they want. That includes elected officials. The point here is that an endorsement by a super delegate is virtually meaningless in the nomination process. Superdelegates don't get a vote unless it's a brokered convention.
@audreyregan @tomwatson Well I disagree on every point here. The movement started by the Sanders campaign has brought new people into the party, strengthened the party, honed a more popular message, reframed the debates on once stale issues. Made #MedicareForAll possible.
@arthurtarley @NomikiKonst @DefundN @TheDemocrats While it was dishonest for them to include them in the past, it would be doubly so now as they effectively don't have a vote. A majority of pledged delegates wins the nomination.
@JohnDPeck @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst Yes that's the technical truth of the matter which I said in a later tweet. But seeing as all modern primaries are decided before the convention, Superdelegates as we have known them are eliminated.
@audreyregan @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst There are caucus reforms in the reform package as well. Allowing folks to vote without having to be there all day.
@NomikiKonst @DefundN @TheDemocrats True, I just don't want to tempt fate on that point.
@DefundN @TheDemocrats @NomikiKonst They will have no vote on the first ballot at the convention. That's pretty close to eliminating them altogether as the nomination is usually decided on the first ballot.

@SippinMyCoffee @vivkassa That's not the point here. Yes there are multiple ways. I support multiple ways, though Medicare for All is perhaps the easiest to implement and has by far the most popular support so that seems to be the way to go. 	Supporting multiple approaches is not opposing Medicare for All
@SippinMyCoffee @vivkassa But if only 12% of the Democratic Party opposes #MedicareForAll that does make the viewpoint a fringe viewpoint. Big tent or not, the opponents are not in the mainstream of the party in regards to healthcare policy.
@SippinMyCoffee @vivkassa Then you're agreeing with the vast majority of the American people... What is your issue?
@SippinMyCoffee @vivkassa I'm really not sure what you're getting at. 70% of the country supports #MedicareForAll, 88% of Democrats, and 52% of Republicans. I was going after Republican leaders in office with this tweet who are out of touch with their own party.

@KathrynECramer That's not the answer I heard at the debate. None of us has the power to vote in Congress until after the midterms, that's a given.
The Senate should conduct an investigation and then decide on removal. The House should allow this process to begin.
This President's failure to divest himself of his international business interests and his showing preferential treatment to ZTE after China guaranteed financial resources to one of his resorts is a potential violation of the #emoluments clause of our #Constitution.
As the only candidate in #NY21 that supports #impeachment of @realDonaldTrump, I want to be very clear about what this means. It means that I believe there is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation and trial in the US Senate. #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/W9ubIjQNnk

@KathrynECramer @pmdemola It's also bad political strategy. Running conservative Democrats has been a sure loser for the party over the last 10 years. This kind of thinking is what got us Trump. Also there's a green in this race again that cannot be ignored. A self styled moderate has a 3-5% handicap.

@Thomas_Gokey At the end of the day, there's going to be some kind of immigration enforcement in this country. I really don't care if they are still called ICE, or are returned to being called INS, or if we come up with a new name. One person's abolishment is another's reform.
@Thomas_Gokey I'm focused on the outcome rather than the branding. I want the current behavior to stop: separating children, terrorizing communities. I want the officers that are currently enforcing this inhumane policy evaluated and then either retrained, or replaced.

@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe Making the rules for a market = making a market. No rules = no market. 	The protection of private property rights is in and of itself another rule created by the government. Without that rule there cannot be a market. 	No "government interference" means I can just take your stuff
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe I call that helping people afford an education so that we have a stronger more productive society
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe Market failures are a real thing with or without government involvement. Also government doesn't interfere in markets, it creates markets and the rules by which they operate. You cannot have a market without a government. At least not any kind of modern market...
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe So public police, no public roads, no public parks, no public schools, no public fire departments, no public EMS? That's your position? Everything should be done for profit by the market?
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe I'm not claiming better outcomes. That would be the World Health Organization. We're talking about per capita spending here, the size is not an issue. Certainly not when we are talking about the NY Health Act which is for NY State which is comparable in population to Canada.
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe Sometimes the market is better at things, sometimes the public sector is better at things. You can't honestly think that the private sector is the solution to everything. Honestly?
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe In regards to healthcare it's just a fact. Medicare has a 2% overhead and the private sector has a 20% overhead. Demand for healthcare is inelastic making it impossible for the market to control price.

@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe This is why ideologues shouldn't be making policy. It's not about being for or against the government. It's about creating practical policy that works for the American people.
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe Why do you support corporate control of our healthcare? When compared directly governments are more efficient and deliver better healthcare outcomes. Anti government ideology is resulting in irresponsible policy and a waste of taxpayer money.
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe How about the fact that the US is already 4th highest in the world in government spending on healthcare per citizen? Both the Canadian and Australian governments spend about $1500 LESS than we already pay. They cover everyone with better outcomes.
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe @LarrySharpe Would you sign the New York Health Act and save NY taxpayers $45 Billion a year while guaranteeing care to all New Yorkers?
@chris_kittredge @Martz4Congress @EliseStefanik @CynthiaNixon @LarrySharpe .@CynthiaNixon supports the NY Health Act which will save taxpayers money in the State of NY.  $45 Billion a year. It will help us lower property taxes too.

@Thomas_Gokey @SeanMcElwee I embrace the movement, I'm just not for binary views on important issues.
@Thomas_Gokey @SeanMcElwee I'm for making it possible for working people to come to this country legally. I'm against private prisons. I am for some level of immigration law enforcement. That said #AbolishICE
@Thomas_Gokey @SeanMcElwee I'm for a pathway to citizenship for otherwise law abiding undocumented immigrants. I'm for #DACA. I'm for getting rid of ICE as it exists today. I'm for fundamental immigration reform that respects human rights and understands the economic situation.
@Thomas_Gokey @SeanMcElwee With the caveat that I'm either for fundamentally reforming the agency, or replacing it with one the respects human rights. There are people that should be deported even after comprehensive immigration reform, but this as it stands is completely unacceptable.
So @RepStefanik is willing to stand up to Trump on #tariffs, but not against this egregious and inhumane policy of separating children from their families at the border? #HumanRights #WhereAreTheChildren #ShouldBeWithTheirFamilies #AbolishICE Photo:NACLA https://t.co/Gp9zIdn8Sx

@Thomas_Gokey @AdirondacKatie @DylanRatigan @Martz4Congress @TedraCobb @SeanMcElwee It certainly needs to be reformed along with our entire immigration system.

@Thomas_Gokey @stf18 @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie That's why I mention it on the campaign trail.
@Thomas_Gokey @stf18 @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie Oh sure after 2021 with a new progressive President. But that doesn't mean we sit on out hands for a whole term in Congress. Might be able to get some debt relief into an omnibus bill, or something like that.
@Thomas_Gokey @stf18 @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie Public policy is managing the art of the possible in the short term while not taking our eye off the ball in the ling term. We have to be able to have both conversations.
@Thomas_Gokey @stf18 @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie Public servants. I'm looking to mirror that for people who start businesses in communities that need them badly like my district. I think maybe also we could reduce interest rates.
@Thomas_Gokey @stf18 @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie So if I had my choice, forgiveness is the way to go. For the next Congress though we are stuck looking at proposals that can be signed by a GOP President and get 60 votes in the Senate. There are similar forgiveness programs for rural doctors, nurses, social workers, and 1/2
@stf18 @Thomas_Gokey @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie I would say so. Those kinds of proposals are how we shift the current political climate.
@stf18 @Thomas_Gokey @TedraCobb @Martz4Congress @DylanRatigan @AdirondacKatie So blanket principal forgiveness, or even reduction, is most likely DoA in the next Congress, but I've also been running on targeted debt relief/forgiveness for entrepreneurs in areas that need new businesses like most of #NY21 What do you think?

@McadooAndrew A position very likely supported by the majority of the people in the district? I don't see where the risk is.. We can't keep running away from a loud, vocal minority on this issue. It's far more risky to keep running away. The real risk is more dead Americans when we fail to act

@chris_kittredge Wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, etc. That said I am somewhat familiar with next generation reactor technologies that produce an order of magnitude less waste and are designed to make meltdowns impossible.
@chris_kittredge So nuclear energy is not renewable, it is a process that consumes. It is however emission free. We currently haven't figured out what to do with nuclear waste already generated let alone if we expanded production. So my focus is on genuine renewable electricity sources.

@chris_kittredge And finally it is more than fair that the top 5% pay more than 60% of taxes considering they get more than 60% of the benefits from those taxes. Protection of their private property rights for starters. Also the education of their workers, roads their businesses use, and more.
@chris_kittredge We need higher tax rates on higher levels of income to avoid the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of too few people. Concentration of wealth and power threatens the economy and hurts our Democracy.
@chris_kittredge Everyone is subject to the same rates of taxation, Warren Buffet and I pay the same rate of capital gains and the same rate on the first $20,000 of our income. The tax code is static but the income of citizens is variable.

@chris_kittredge @FarmerShaun @pmdemola @RepPaulTonko @RepStefanik The Amash amendment would have required intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant to spy on Americans. This is what the 4th amendment requires. It was a bipartisan amendment that the Congresswoman voted against. It seems she picks and chooses which amendments to defend.
@chris_kittredge @FarmerShaun @pmdemola @RepPaulTonko @RepStefanik The Congresswoman claimed that she voted for the Nunes memo because she had concerns about our intelligence agencies spying on Americans. I asked her to square that concern with her vote against Justin Amash's (a Republican) amendment to the FISA reauthorization.
@FarmerShaun @pmdemola Yes @FarmerShaun and part of that job is doing regular #TownHall meetings that's my point here. @RepPaulTonko has the same job and has done many Town Hall meetings. And for the first 4 Town Hall we did I was still working at the State Assembly. 4 is still more than @RepStefanik
@pmdemola Also I spoke to her staff about this being the 16th and 17th such event. That number goes back to the Congresswoman's first term. Kind of disingenuous considering this is her 3rd such event this term.

@UpstateNYBlue I'm not talking her up @UpstateNYBlue I'm not voting for her. I've carried petitions for @AMCarrieWoerner, I've donated to her campaign, and knocked on doors for her. I'll be voting for her in November. My point is attacking her opponent's age is a bad idea. Don't twist my words.
@UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers Have I said otherwise? That's not my point. My point is your attack on Zergers is ageist at best and only serves to strengthen her campaign. Focus on the issues, not the people. Will Zergers stand up to fully fund our public schools? I doubt it. Will she support our unions? No.
@UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers Ultimately I think this kind of campaigning will play right into the narrative Zergers is crafting for herself. It has a high potential to backfire and rally younger voters to her cause. I mean you've even called her a "college kid" here. She's not a kid, she is an adult.
@UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers Also experience comes in different forms. A recent high school graduate and current college student would have a very valuable perspective when it comes to developing the State's education policy. The Assembly is also very very far from the White House in terms of responsibility.
@UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers The argument you are making could be applied to anyone at the age of 20. Do you think no one at the age of 20 should be able to serve in the State Legislature?

@MikeChapmoo @UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers Young people have the greatest stake in all governmental decisions because we will have to live with the consequences of those decisions for longer. We are grossly underrepresented in the halls of power and underserved by government decisions. We need more young people in power.
@MikeChapmoo @UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers I don't feel this is a fair point against @morganzegers. I disagree with Morgan on most of her policy views and it is on those views that campaign against her should be run. Otherwise you are saying that 20 year olds need not apply to the State Legislature. That is ageist.
@MikeChapmoo @UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers That being said, folks still knock me and our campaign because I lack experience. Sadly a lot of these folks make this claim without having taken the time to check the bio on my website. They simply assume a 28 year old must lack experience. And that is ageism.
@MikeChapmoo @UpstateNYBlue @morganzegers Actually I have owned a business @MikeChapmoo and I've employed myself as a consultant helping entrepreneurs hone their ideas.

Ok @EliseStefanik I've responded to your question. How about answering one you have had 4 years to think about but still haven't answered? #ElusiveElise #SilentStefanik  https://t.co/bhkibCkKsX
@rscollin @studw2003 @pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik @Martz4Congress @Adirondackatie @BernieSanders Hey man, like but seriously though millenials are gonna millenial ;) 		If you're concerned about casual language on Twitter I think your issue should be with @realDonaldTrump casually threatening nuclear war on a forgein nation. Just a thought.
@rscollin @studw2003 @pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik @Martz4Congress @Adirondackatie I thought one of @EliseStefanik was that elected officials should be held to the same standard as every other citizen... Like I admire your dedication @rscollin I really do. But you've lost this round, better luck next time.
@rscollin @studw2003 @pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik @Martz4Congress @Adirondackatie Like seriously @EliseStefanik and @alcivar couldn't figure out who the @BernieSanders voted for in the 2016 primary.... let that sink in. Meanwhile our Congresswoman never endorsed a candidate for POTUS and has never revealed her vote. That is a literal double standard...
@rscollin @studw2003 @pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik @Martz4Congress @Adirondackatie Hey a straight answer, thank you. Now is that your answer or @EliseStefanik's because due respect only one of you has the power to privatize my social security. Hey man silly political stunts get silly responses.
@rscollin @studw2003 @pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik @Martz4Congress @Adirondackatie @rscollin so what's the answer then? What does "near retirement" mean? What age?
@pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik But again the story here is @EliseStefanik having the gall to ask questions when she will not answer questions. Holding Democratic candidates to a standard she herself refuses to meet.
@pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan @EliseStefanik I don't consider them opponents @pmdemola We're fellow candidates and we are all running against @EliseStefanik. I believe I am still the strongest candidate. We had 9 candidates and now there's 10... what's there to say? We've been through this 9 times already.
@pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan I have one opponent, that's @EliseStefanik. And I'm waiting with the rest of #NY21 to see if she's come up with an answer for "near retirement" after having almost 4 years to think about it.
@pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan June 26th
@pmdemola @alcivar @DylanRatigan Hasn't changed my vote

@pmdemola @alcivar Our campaign has also offered to plan a #TownHall meeting for @RepStefanik to show she can answer questions, rather than ask them. We will do all the work since we have done 300% more Town Halls than @EliseStefanik. What say you @alcivar? Or do you only know how to ask questions?
@pmdemola @alcivar Did @RepStefanik call @RepTomReed to try and persuade him to vote against the #TaxScam? Did she call anyone? Or was her vote against it just a cynical act of political theater? If I can get an answer to this one question I'll answer 2 of @alcivar's silly questions.

Let's be clear if @GOP members of Congress and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump had used budget reconciliation for its intended use (passing the budget), instead of as a way to give $1.5 Trillion of taxpayer money to their campaign donors we wouldn't be having a second #GovernmentShutdown
I'm waiting for @SpeakerRyan @RepStefanik @SenateMajLdr and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to try to blame this #GovernmentShutdown on @TheDemocrats too... Once again they cannot get their own party in line. @SenRandPauI is right about @GOP #hypocrisy on the #deficit though.

Yes they repealed the regulation that prevented #coal companies from dumping waste into #rivers and #streams #HJRes38 #environment #climatechange #SOTU @realDonaldTrump and @RepStefanik worked together to do that. Quite the accomplishment.

@KMcMays shouldn't we and our representatives be given time to read the new amendments before passing the bill?
@KMcMays I've read the entire Bill yes, reviewed the amendments yes, spoken to doctors, nurses, and patients yes. Have you?
@BetsieFl care to start now? https://t.co/A2jUBnuiYl ??
@KMcMays If you don't like the #ACA you won't like the #AHCA which is just a worse version of the same system. Higher prices, lower coverage

@brentsacks So now you're arguing ideology and not effective policy. More concerned with what makes you feel good that with what works.
@brentsacks that's not how efficiency works, that's gross spending. Sleep through fractions in school?
@brentsacks Best #healthcare in the world is #France. Most effective and costs ~12% of GDP to the US's 18% You sir are misguided #DemDebate
@brentsacks #Medicare and #Medicaid are the most efficient health insurers in the US. #DemDebate

@enzerukristin that's because generally when you buy stock on an exchange, it's not from the company itself but someone else who bought it.
RT @enzerukristin: That's correct. @PatFNelson I was curious about the outside entities supporting  @WoolfforNY campaign. @alcivar
@alcivar @enzerukristin was asking about @WoolfforNY's campaign support, not his private investments. Nice try, thanks for playing. #NY21
@enzerukristin See for yourself http://t.co/wtKd130rDh @EliseStefanik  only candidate with $ from big oil. Also 4X $ from wall street. #NY21
I'll ask again, Does @EliseStefanik think she is running for Congress, or President? It's 2014 not 2016. #NY21
Will someone please tell @EliseStefanik that it's impossible for a taxes to be both flatter and fairer? It's like squaring a circle #NY21
@enzerukristin @WoolfforNY does support renewable energy. It's a major point in his platform:  http://t.co/t4JfVjZJVm #NY21
RT @RyanMorden: Based on @WoolfforNY's specific proposals on green energy, he's more green than the Green Party candidate #NY21
@TheMightyLyon @EliseStefanik  doesn't want to say she's from Albany which isn't  #NY21. Albany Academy, Harvard, and DC. Not north country

Is it me or does @EliseStefanik remark on every question that it's great, good, or important? Of course they're important. #NY21
@RyanMorden @EliseStefanik Nixoncare is more apt than anything. It was not a liberal idea, it was a conservative "free market" idea #NY21
I believe all of us who have followed the #NY21 debates have @EliseStefanik's opening statement memorized by now.

@pmdemola @EliseStefanik has been training to be a politician her entire life. She's a master at avoiding actually saying anything #NY21
@alcivar @EliseStefanik  spends 60 minutes in support of @SpeakerBoehner @KarlRove and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires #NY21
@EliseStefanik works hard for her campaign donations. Works hard for @KarlRove @SpeakerBoehner and @GOPLeader  #NY21
@EliseStefanik "a seat at the table" what does that even mean? #NY21
@EliseStefanik answer on the minimum wage and small business: "obamacare is bad" Answer the question Elise. #NY21
@TheMahoney Warren Buffet is a small business? @WoolfforNY wants to raise taxes on the extremely wealthy, including himself #NY21
Does @EliseStefanik think Warren Buffet and the Koch Brothers are "hard working families"? Smh #NY21
@EliseStefanik our tax code cannot be be both flatter and fairer at the same time. Flat taxes punish hard working families #NY21

"Bipartisan" @EliseStefanik can't even have a civil debate. Will she interrupt her Washington colleagues the same way? #NY21
@EliseStefanik how are millionaires and billionaires the same thing as working families? How does buffet rule impact small business? #NY21
@EliseStefanik can't stop bashing @BarackObama even when the question specifically asks her not to. New ideas? #NY21

RT @SpartanBen87: @guypbenson That darn journalism thing...credit for owning up to your mistake though.
@guypbenson It applies to those employers receiving $1 million or more in city funding. Most Grocery stores don't.
@guypbenson Epic gotcha that was planned for weeks and turned out to be founded on a false premise. NYS and NYC min wage still $8.
@BloombergNews so happy I picked Jamaal Charles with the first overall pick in my fantasy draft.
@WhiteHouse Labor participation rate also still falling though. Unemployment number doesn't tell the whole story. Wages also still stagnant.
@SenTedCruz @Scotus not judicially active. Hearing case would have overturned all gay marriage bans in USA. As a lawyer you know better.
@nrcc Typical republican strategy: lie, then when you're proven wrong keep lying NY min wage still $8 smh: http://t.co/YqRnJVaSe2

@EliseStefanik has not proposed 1 new idea. All ideas come from @GOP @SpeakerBoehner @KarlRove and Wall Street #NY21
@pmdemola @EliseStefanik @WoolfforNY And that grenade was a dud.
@iprior1177 DeBlassio minimum wage only for businesses that receive over $1million in city subsidies. State wages still $8
@EliseStefanik can't stand partisan attacks, except when she launches them. @WoolfforNY is running as Aaron Woolf, not Obama or Pelosi.#NY21
@EliseStefanik is the Champion of small business and small donors. Pay no attention to the $200,000 Wall Street gave to her campaign. #NY21
@WoolfforNY stands by his career. @EliseStefanik runs away from hers.
@EliseStefanik supports the environment and supports subsidies for big oil. Which is it? #NY21
@EliseStefanik learned well from the Romney campaign how to not answer questions. #NY21
