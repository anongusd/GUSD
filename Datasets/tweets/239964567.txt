Thank you, @InHomelandBlog, for posting on the January #TerrorThreatSnapshot. https://t.co/TDFd5Xj7PW
This month POTUS has released close to 20% of GITMO's population, even though nearly 1/3 of freed terrorists have returned to the fight.
President Obama‚Äôs rush to open the jail cells at GITMO is reckless and puts the American people in danger. https://t.co/r5cINJcVut
What Commander in Chief releases terrorist detainees? 		Answer: President Obama		#GITMO #Oman https://t.co/r5cINJcVut
Ten GITMO detainees were released to Oman today. The President seems more focused on letting terrorists loose than on rounding them up.
