@BeachlifeisB Blame starts with Labour Party who decided everyone must come-no matter if they didn't acclimate to British society.  Next to blame are the Conservative party for simply sticking their thumb in their bum and brains stuck in neutral.  It's exactly the same as is happening here...1

@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee Harold moves to Florida in 2002. We all missed him greatly. He passed from lung cancer two years before Dad. A huge loss to his patients.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee My parents had a GP whilst in NY-Harold Steinbaum-he was brilliant. He was born in the 30‚Äôs but was old school. He was so through that he found the cancer in both my Mum and my first wife-cancer everyone else missed.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee Dad nurses were outstanding.  Even my sisters said they could do what they did. My Aunt Kathleen did it until 75-but her arthritis put a stop to that.

@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee You‚Äôre exactly right. At the VA, RN‚Äôs are deskbound mostly.  Med passes are handled by LPN‚Äôs and patient care by NA‚Äôs.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee Nor I. Patient care is a calling-not a job. Mum was a nurse as was her mum. A couple of sisters were RN‚Äôs. They took caring to heart.  You don‚Äôt see that much nowadays.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee When I was in physical rehab, I had a NA that was fantastic-yet she wasn‚Äôt certified.  Many of the certified ones were awful.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee I thinks it‚Äôs rare for RN‚Äôs to bring doing that sort of care-I could be wrong, though. One aunt(Dads youngest sister)  just retired at 80-nurse for  sixty years-she was mostly admin last five.
@heartsabustin @MsMakita @EmersenLee Some of the NA‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even certified.
@MsMakita @EmersenLee @heartsabustin Flip side of this was care my Dad received when he went into hospice-caring for him at home was more than my sisters could handle. The nurses and aides he had at Calvary were magnificent.

@Food_2_Die_4 If you‚Äôre interested in the job, you‚Äôd soon see how Americans were forced out of backstretch. Trainers and owners wanted cheap staff, so they cut pay and Americans left. Horses pay the price in the end with lower quality barn workers.

@Food_2_Die_4 How about you consider Americans for jobs first?
@Food_2_Die_4 We already have H1B. It‚Äôs abused by potential employers such as racetracks and service industry and even tech industry. Hard pass.
@Food_2_Die_4 We need to enforce our laws. Overstay a visa, you‚Äôre banned from the USA permanently. Employing an illegal? Your company and assets are seized. BTW, you neglect the numbers of illegals already here illegally. I‚Äôll wager you‚Äôre all for another amnesty.
@Food_2_Die_4 What you want are foreigners to come in and get paid half of what an American would get paid for the same job. In short, a permanent underclass permanently  kept on a figurative plantation.
@Food_2_Die_4 You talk about fields as if you think that‚Äôs all blacks are capable of. That‚Äôs smacks of racism.
@Food_2_Die_4 You‚Äôre a nice lily-white who‚Äôs likely never had a rough job in your life. I worked with racehorses whilst in college, my first wife her entire life. We saw wages tank with illegals and saw hard working black men-who were true horsemen-tossed to make way for cheaper staff
@Food_2_Die_4 You‚Äôve no clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Philippines‚Äôs uses extrajudicial punishment. We can try dealers, and when found guilty execute.
@Food_2_Die_4 Rubbish. Illegals cut pay for many jobs by over fifty percent-so no American of any colour could afford to live on it.  Look at any throughbred racetrack and be amazed.

@Food_2_Die_4 In 1986, amnesty was given with a promise that enforcement thereafter would be carried out-it wasn‚Äôt. It was allowed to continue with even greater numbers. How is this overblown?
@Food_2_Die_4 As for the drugs: start executing dealers and distributors and you have a real war. Not a war where you simply claims drugs are seized, but where dealers actually become casualties.
@Food_2_Die_4 Overblown numbers? Look at the number of illegals in the USA-a low number would be about 12 million-and tell me where that‚Äôs overblown?  Ask African Americans here who‚Äôve lost jobs because of illegals how overblown those numbers are.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC North America is made of two nations.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC As you can see, some nation put restrictions on Birthright. Even Canada has *some * restrictions; The USA has none.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Not white accurate as you ascribing EU law which allows unfettered access between member states.  Each EU nation does have it won laws regarding birthright.  The attached isn't the best, but is failry accurate:	https://t.co/7tqmXBynvc
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I'll not speak for canada-that's her options as to who gets citizenship.  Of course, any change here would not be ex post facto.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC At the very least it should be modified to give citizenship to those born to  US citizens or legal residents.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Oldest and now largely abused.  Many nations have done away with it for that reason
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC No.  they did not.  They saw an injustice being righted.  Again, the Law of Noble Intentions.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That's what the law says, reality is far different unfortunately.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC My parents had to register my birth at the US embassy in London.  If you're out of this country for 5 years-unless in military or Federal employ-you should have to apply for your child to be a citizen.  Birthright citizenship is being abused-it needs to be ended.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC And it needs to be stopped.  Airlines need to be told that any pregnant passenger coming to the States is to be refused passage UNLESS coming for medical treatment.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC My wife came here with green card in hand.  Started work a few days later and paid taxes from the start.  It's not an easy process, but it is what it is.  Asylum is meant to be a strict process to weed the underserving out-but it's also easy to game
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Birthright citizenship needs to be ended as well
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Oh, yeah.  It's not a pretty scene when my missus has the displeasure of seeing her.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Ever been to Flushing, NY?  It's filled with women nearing birth that want their kid born in the US to keep them from being deported.  You'll think your in a borough-wide maternity ward there.  All of those mothers end up getting welfare from NYC for themselves and the kid
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Then send them back.  I'm tired of the US being the whipping boy for poor actions of others.  Again, follow the rules and apply in your home county-as my wife did.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC My wife spend thousands-and a great deal of time-to come to the US with her green card in hand.  One of her nieces bullshitted her way into one by by blaming asylum based on religious persecution-yet the kid is an atheist! Needless to say my wife wants nothing to do with her.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Are you aware that many seeking asylum are told what key words to tell officials here?
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC What IS bad is using a child to game the system.  Apply to come here legally, i's not much to ask,  Coming to any country isn't a right.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Bad? No.  Coming here without following our laws...yes.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That it is-and the illegals game the system for everything it's worth.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC A niece works at Federal Plaza in NYC where those hearing are held: She'd disagree.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC A noble reason doomed to failure
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC When I saw illegals bagged at Belmont, we saw them come back two days later-court appearance date in hand.  90% never went.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Some were the victims of human trafficking as well.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That's what happened-or they were release to people that were supposedly "family"
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Problem is the many-asylum seekers or not- that were released ROR never came back for the hearings.  Whilst more seeking asylum came for hearing than simple illegals, it wasn't most of them.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Different Days at Ellis-people were coming after being checked first at port of embarkation, and a ship's manifest was given to the agents ding the inspections.  IF people would request permission to come here at an embassy or consulate in their home country, no problems!
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Are you talking at present or in the past.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Actually, they were often simply deported (mother's side of family was with Cunard and White Star from the early 1880's until 1970's) as they committed a crime.  If stowaway was not caught as such, and officials were none the wiser, they went through the same inspection as others
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC open, but subject to inspection.  if you didn't pass through the process successfully , you were deported.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Any nation reserve the right to accept anyone they wish-and deny those they don't.  Perfect system? No.   The H-2B visa is one of the most abused visa in the system.,
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Obama was covered for where Trump was not.  Obama could do no wrong according to the Sainted and Haloed heads of the media-so he was given a pass.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Also, if a person was found to be a stowaway, they were sent back.  If they were not caught, but process through-they were considered legal under us regulations.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Rubbish.  If they came through Ellis Island  or any other station-and were processes through, they were legal.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Yeah, it sucks. This is why you come here following the rules, not en masse.  Now do Obama and the dog kennels.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Obama held kids in dog kennels, but seems the media forgot all about that.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC They were given an exam at Ellis.  In order to avoid the costs of shipping back returnees, many shipping companies (Cunard, HAPAG and North German Lloyd) often did exams of their own in such ports as Liverpool and Cuxhaven.  Depending where you came from dictated need for exam.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC And a chest Xray isn't all you need for TB, you also will be given a PPD depending on where you are coming from
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC If you come to the border without any documents, you WILL be examined.  TB is rife in South America as much as Hep A and B are in China.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I try to be considerate-but if anyone gets in my face, they'll jolly well regret it.  Look what happened to those Teens from Kentucky...a perfect example.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC on the Rez my dad was from-mostly because you didn't see people with my skin possessing a broad Yorkshire accent.  That was simply taking the piss, with nothing nasty meant

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC What's interesting  is that for all you lot accuse "The Right" of such behaviour, it's the left that I see doing it on a daily basis.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC A Heath Cert is essentially the results of an examination.  US government is free at any time to have an exam done by their own people as a requirement for entry as a legal or landed immigrant.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Medical records presume a medical examination by a competent physician who sign off on them, but you knew that.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That caravan doesn't want to follow our laws regarding immigration.  They tried to gang rush the border-and were tear gassed as a result.  Actions have consequence.  If a border crossing cannot handle mass amounts, they close until backlog is dealt with.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I think Canadians need to worry about Canada.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC did you notice that part about an inspection to determine the fitness of an immigrant?  Guess not.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Because they rushed the border.  If you come here, you sit and wait until you are seen about entering.  Period.  They could've avoided that by seeing a US embassy or consulate in their home countries.  Their bad planning isn't the responsibility of the US
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC They've no right to come to the US, they can try and come here legally.  If they are found to be suitable, they cane come in.

@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC A problem the left have today. They say we are anti-immigrant, we say simply come here legally.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Anyone likely to be a public charge was sent back-as were "undesirables" and anarchists.  Those that were ill with something treatable were allowed in after medical clearance *only* if they were not caring a communicable disease. Arnachist were sent back almost immediately.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Exactly so.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC You know nothing about Ellis Island, your posts proved that.  It did not process illegals-they sent them back.  BTW, the boats weren't trying to rush a border crossing-a term usually called invading.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Anyone not meeting the requirements of the time were sent back to port of origin on the vessels that brought them here-at the shipowner's expense.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Yes.  They followed the established procedure of laws of the time.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Nah, You want everyone to be allowed in-but don't want them your neighbourhood.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That is an outright lie.  Ellis island processed those that came to the USA.  Inspectors saw that they sufficient money to avoid becoming a public charge, carried no loathsome diseases or were people thought to be f low character or anarchists.  Seems your knowledge is lacking.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I think she doesn't like italians...sad.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC My fathers Family is Native American, so he didn't have to worry about it.  As for Italians, most did not come illegally as US had immigration centres when Italians arrived (look up Castle Garden and Ellis Island)
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC "Equality", that's a proper laugh!  I see you "progressive" types yapping equality, but seldom practising it.  I saw less racism in the UK than from entire cities like NY or LA.  They talked "equality" until it come time to actually live up to iy.

@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Beyond false equivalence, it's and outright fraud.  West Berliners wanted East Berliners to come to freedom-they wanted them to escape tyranny from fellow Germans
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Do spare me your silliness about history.  Comparing a US border wall with Berlin is outright lying.  With a US wall, the wall proper is but one of the assets used to secure the border..with electronic surveillance and extra patrols assisting
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Same applies for CBP.  They are federal agents, so that's it.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC If illegals are being harboured/employed, ICE has every right to get them  and deport them.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Why are you concerned with American laws?  As for "unlawfully", it appears you've a bias against them.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I was questioned by CBP (forms) my wife (Chinese born and raised) by ICE
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC CBP is hamstrung by people like you making their job far more difficult.  CBP cannot be all places at once despite their zeal.  Given some people come here and overstay a visa, ICE, bot CBP would fetch them and deport if needed.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Yes, I have.
@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Number granted amnesty by Simpson-Mazzoli about three million that had entered the USA before 1982, but was supposed to be also followed by persecution of any employer found to be employing illegals and deportation of anyone found here illegally-some thing that didn't happen
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC False comparison.  If CBP misses someone or something at a border, they often call upon ICE to assist.  Your comparison to CBP/ICE to roads and food stamps is a very silly one.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC ICE assists CBP often-how can you not know that?
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC one raid at Belmont they picked up nearly 500.  It was a circus, but they were caught.
@WazzuCoug94 @mommydoing @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC INS would come to racetracks and the same would occur.  One time a security guard tried to warn the illegals over the tannoy-a Nassau County policeman pointing a 9mm at him dissuaded him of that foolish idea
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC How is it not?
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC What part of "sister agencies" don't you quite understand?
@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC That said, those days were-If you'll excuse the term-simpler times.  We had neither the amount of illegals here-and certainly little terrorism to be concerned about. 9/11 was a game changer
@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC I have my problems with the Patriots Act, but I also realise that both ICE and CBP do the jobs they've done before under a different name.  Both are important whether or not you like it.  I'm old enough to remember the old INS making raids at racecourses in  NY &amp; New England
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Both are part of Homeland Security...they're sister agencies.

@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC If you want FBI to handle raids-I'm fine with that.  Just increase FBI manpower to insure other LE cases aren't effected.

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC 10 miles is the usually given-and they do work outside both numbers.  I've seen them working in south-central Wyoming-far over 10 miles from the border.
@Granmadd @journiest piss off
@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC FBI doesn't just have terrorits and immigrants that might be terrorists on their plate, you know.  Whilst their specialty is law enforcement, they have a far wider scope that either ICE or CBP.
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC You're clearly not paying attention.  Anyone who thinks the ten mile rule for CBP is sacrosanct is deluding themselves
@mommydoing @oneeightirish @WazzuCoug94 @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC More rubbish.  You do realise the stop of the different agencies, do you not? Do you also realise how one agency will work with another?
@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC All the same agency in end-for better or worse.  CBP picked up three illegals near me when in NYC last week-far from any border

@mommydoing @WazzuCoug94 @oneeightirish @Michael_kings_ @GoBlueInOak1 @officialmgamerz @stephens_ben @AOC Actually not mistaken.

IF there is a person of interest, ICE is warned beforehand and FBI available if needed as FBI doesn't actively work border crossing.
