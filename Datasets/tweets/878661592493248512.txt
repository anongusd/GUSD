I figured it out. People can't think logically because of feelings. When these people were growing up. They had their feelings validated all the time. So these people need validation as adults now. It also seems like society cares more about women's feelings than men's...

@ehnottooxabi I don't think any of those companies provide abortions on taxpayer money.

@ehnottooxabi Our society should promote ProLife. Not our government forcing us to. Stay out of our lives and take your big government with you.	 	Surprised?
I find it funny that abortion is the only answer for a unexpected pregnancy instead of adoption. 	A lot of people cannot have babies. So let's just kill all of the perfectly healthy babies but If the baby had a birth defect then it's your right to have an abortion. #ProLife https://t.co/gozS0BgTXo

@Jwine05 @OhQueenBey @Deebiosi @_ORIGINS @GoodLuckChuck12 @benevolentamiss @ChristineFox_ @_Queen0fLove_ I disagree. I think sexism towards men does have a negative impact. Especially if it matters less than sexism towards women. That makes men think they're less valuable than women in Society. If sexism against both sexes are not held to the same standards then that's hypocrisy.
@OhQueenBey @Deebiosi @_ORIGINS @GoodLuckChuck12 @benevolentamiss @Jwine05 @ChristineFox_ @_Queen0fLove_ Can women be sexist towards men?
