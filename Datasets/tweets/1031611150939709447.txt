@azuresupport #azhelp: What Azure services are HIPAA compliant, or, alternatively which aren't? (e.g. LUIS, etc)
@azuresupport #azhelp: What adjustments to my privacy policy are needed if I use Azure WebApps, or any other service?
@sergejusb Hey there! Do you know anyone interested in an hourly contract involving TaskParallelLibrary? I found your TPLExtensions on Nuget, which lead me to Git, your username there, then your LinkedIn, now here. LMK
@lopp This is terrible.  If you come across an opt-out be sure to share it (and CC this account)
Our guiding principle can be best summarized with this statement:	"What is best that humanity has to offer, and what digital tools are needed to demonstrate that with the digital arts?"		Once we finish the Privacy Enhanced ID, we will create tools that promote social health. https://t.co/kWbWJuYKPd

@brianlagunas Using Prism for a large project and discovered that Visual Studio for Mac doesn't work well with many files... e.g. lots of views, models, classes, etc.  Intelisense dies, as does every right click option. 		Is this why I should use PRISM Modules?  Trying it now.
All of the #serverless features in the poll above are in addition to the gated access control included in the standard license.This includes anon proofs such as		• Is over 21	• A site-specific,non transferrable unique ID	• Is resident of X	• Verified email	• Verified phone
@xamarinhq Visual Studio for OSX has too many issues with intellisense breaking, and all of the dynamic syntax highlighting I'm switching to PC.		Please fix this, it's much more power efficient for me to not run a virtual machine to code, not to mention I don't have to pair w/Mac
@nickmlittlejohn Would love your support!
@nickmlittlejohn How cool would it be to have a car sharing system based on anonymous credentials?		E.g. A UPS fleet of trucks could all use keyless entry based on a distributed public key system like the one we're building. 		Set the permission to {isUPSEmployee == True &amp;&amp; Class2Vehicle == true)
@NSF Hey NSF, we're producing an open source technology to increase privacy without sacrificing security.		It has a lot of different possibilities from online voting, anti-bullying, to e-commerce.  Can you help us identify sources of funding? Our kickstarter is struggling.
We've updated our Kickstarter with a more descriptive overview of the technology.  Feedback welcome!		https://t.co/0IYtOKRy5q
What will you most likely use ZeroPKI technology for?		Not sure? Read more on our Kickstarter below	https://t.co/0ScegP83JA
@OpenAtMicrosoft Would love your support or sponsorship on using MSFT's UProve with Xamarin Forms.		We're open source and using the best of your tech: @VisualStudio, Prism, @xamarinhq, @AzureCosmosDB		/cc @JamesMontemagno @MSFTStartups @Azure @MSFTPrivacy if you have any ideas https://t.co/LE7ucyujuN
The events of 9/11 made a profound impact on how Americans perceive and relate to security at the expense of privacy.		We are building a consumer-driven technology based on Anonymous Credentials and Zero Knowledge Proofs so we can achieve a balance of privacy and accountability. https://t.co/9SYBpFZmNe
@AzureCosmosDB Hey there! We're building a Web Of Trust on your platform...  it's a more secure alternative than PKI X509's trusted certificate store.		Our solution relies in part by finding a "trust anchor", such as an accrediting body, etc. Need help defining schema. Can u help https://t.co/d8OgDg2uOS

@DeptofDefense We are leading an effort to add privacy protection to BYOD devices that store and share military information.  		With your help, this technology can reduce fraud targeting veterans, and ensure compliance with how a military ID is used and shared.
@usedgov Hello! We are leading an effort to add privacy protection to BYOD devices that store and share student information.  		With your help, this technology can reduce COPPA violations and related privacy issues when the student shares their information with others.
Want an Identity card with no centralization, and the end user directly interacts with the school, DMV, or utility bill provider to get verified?		It's like Bitcoin but for authentication.  	It's like PKI with Web Of Trust mixed in.		Think @Zero_PKI
Do you work in #Healthcare or concerned about HIPAA?		Our technology can be used to create a privacy enhanced insurance card you can use for online services and at the doctors office.  More security, with reduced liability.		Contact us for more info.	#HIPAA #GDPR #healthcare
Hey @Facebook-Did you know you can increase user privacy and reuse the verification people have already done for their school, work, and the DMV?		Yes, we can even protect the privacy of utility bills too!		Consider supporting our Kickstarter! #facebookads https://t.co/RU7OPMXvS1 https://t.co/YDZEoDergv
@verified Hey Twitter, maybe our cross-platform identity wallet can help!		We're building a decentralized, privacy focused identity wallet that can be used online (social media, online voting etc), or offline (at a bar, etc)		Want to collaborate?
@AAAauto Would you be interested in having a digital AAA card added to our mobile wallet (iPhone and Android)?		Let's discuss!
@AAASafety We are developing a Privacy Enhanced Digital Driver's license and would love to have a discussion on how it can save lives and improve safety during road stops.
@end_dd Hey we're in Philadelphia too!		We're working on a project that can help save lives 		A digital drivers license can store vital information needed for police and rescue, 911 operators, fraud prevention. Saving time, frustration, reducing paperwork.		Would love to chat!

Tip #5	If you're having issues with the UWP simulator, and your files are exposed to your Windows 10 virtual machine via Parallels, then be sure to select "remote" and "localhost" has shown below https://t.co/nlS18RZL2G
Tip #4	Still having build issues? 	Make sure that only one instance of Visual Studio is accessing the directory (including on shared drives).  	Delete the ./bin ./obj from each project.  	Finally close and reopen @VisualStudio 		Would love to hear your thoughts on how to improve!
TIP #3	Prevent mismatched nuget package versions by using @VisualStudio on a PC, right clicking on the topmost project and manage packages. It's only available at the solution level (not project) and isn't available at all on a Mac. https://t.co/1kT6gFh7Eu
TIP #2	It's not a good idea to directly share the same project and files with your Windows Virtual machine. Instead do a GIT/TFS sync to a server and maintain two copies of the software, local to each OS.		Why? VisualStudio on Windows will embed the drive letter in the ./obj dir
TIP #1	If you use iCloud, make sure you don't select "optimize Mac Storage", or simply store the files outside of your default profile ~/SomeOtherPlace		Why? The compiler seems to dislike it when the files it wants aren't immediately available for download, or the symlink to it https://t.co/NZi7xr0LAC
Through painstaking trial and error, and searching, here are the best practices I've come up with for app developers who want to deploy to iOS, Android **and UWP**, but use MacOS as their primary machine.

@martenmickos We're building a safer Internet with Anonymous Credentials.  minimal disclosure, homomorphic encryption, and zero knowledge proofs.		No idea how to start a company, get funding, locate partners, etc. so I'm reaching out for help!  Referrals welcome.
@garethreynolds ZeroPKI is porting anonymous credentials to iOS... a technology that can increase both privacy and security for end users.		It's an alternative to differential privacy, and wholly compatible with Apple's business model.
What is the best way to get #sponsorship or #funding for a security startup?		I'll keep on building this PKI-alternative server, client, and related software until someone gets interested enough ;)
Nuget package "ZeroPKI.Crypto" published. 		It's just an Alpha version, as I sort out how to do this in .NET/Core.	https://t.co/ObjOXrX9AE
