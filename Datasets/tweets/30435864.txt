@Tips_Of_Love @BRealer @thehill DACA is an executive order that does not follow current immigration law. Essentially, Obama used his phone and pen to rewrite law that can only be changed by Congress. Therefore, if Trump "reauthorizes" DACA, he also will be in direct violation of the Constitution.

@JoJoFaiman @RealJamesWoods My point was not that a SuperPAC was donated to. But rather a SuperPAC is a legal way to avoid campaign finance laws. It was a side comment about a legal alternative to what appears ti have actually happened.

@klstorey You don't seem to understand the concept of free speech	 We want libs to spew their nonsense. It makes for easy exposure of hypocrisy. 		As I stated before, Texans don't do fake outrage.
@klstorey Climate change is a religion, police brutality, while bad, is rare, and is being exploited for political and financial gains more times than there is a legitimate grievance.
@klstorey And no, I can assure you that it wasnt fake outrage. Trump has his detractors on both sides when he says stupid stuff, and I know we have all heard the threats against him.
@klstorey I don't see an equivalence between what you said about Texas and expressing support for the president. You messed with Texas, that transcends party. And before 10 minutes ago, I didn't know this story.

@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan with that moral equivalency, I could kill anybody I felt could negatively effect me
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan gangrene is an infection and life threatening, an unborn baby is neither
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan life is life, no matter how big, or else why so much anger about the delta smelt
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan or that global warming is not caused by any action of man that man can correct
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan thank you, that's the point. There are consequences and "her choice" has the only mulligan, how's that fair?
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan how are you to build a civilization on choices but not give the unborn a choice? There are many that would adopt
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan well that's just silly, it couldn't happen, but if rape is justification then 2 wrongs do make a right
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan but that means there is a moral obligation to accept something is less than human, but only before birth
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan it's morally inconsistent to say "choice" is the only factor that decides whether a person is a person
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan my point exactly, no choice can justify denying the freedom of the unborn, it can only be made before conception
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan any action, selfish or selfless, will have a cost, and "her choice" shouldn't be the only 1 with a mulligan.
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan the choice to be made, is to be responsible before acting on an animal urge, not denying the consequences after
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan just because it makes some snowflake melt, doesn't mean that one life is less significant
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan how is it apple/orange only at the beginning of life?  To be consistent, then no life can be precious
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan that'd not true, if I was in my mother, and she choose to end me, that certainly interfered with my life

@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan we warehouse the sociopathic, even thou it's proven most only get worse in prison, why protect them?
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan warehousing then is inhumane, but what of those that fail to medicate properly and shoot up a school? Who failed?
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan the insane or sociopathic both are not treated the same, the former is let free to roam society because
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan but what of those that are deemed incapable of making that choice? Why are they protected? Who decides for them?
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan basically the current "norm" is you only have the right to choose if you are capable of choosing
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan no, it does not, life is life and they should all have the same protections or else none should
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan neither got a majority, it was a plurality
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan how is the intentional self interest of capitalism so evil if "her choice" isn't?
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan or that the death penalty for unreformable criminals is unfair,
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan those that would say it's not God's intent for all life to be protected then say guns are evil, are hypocritical
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan the order in which those words appear is not by chance, but a very deliberate statement of priorities
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan the first mandate of the govt of this country is the "protection of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan then perhaps she shouldn't choose to participate in the creation of life, or perhaps that should be regulated too
@worldtwitsaf @SpeakerRyan I agree, and it should start with the protection of the unborn. Since they are the most fragile of his creations.
