I object to the president's decision to withdraw from Syria. We must ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS; this move may allow Iran to consolidate gains. I am especially concerned over the tragic consequences this will have for civilians living in Syria. #SyriaWithdrawal https://t.co/vIjnZ49tjV
I encourage the president to remember the mistakes of the Obama administration when it withdrew for a “stable Iraq.” We cannot allow the atrocities being committed against the Syrian people by the dictator Assad, Russia, and Iran to continue with impunity.

Nearly 65,000 Americans died in 2016 due to drug overdoses – more than our losses in the Vietnam War. Of those, 45,000 were from opioids, which is why the House prioritized comprehensive action - passing more than 50 bills in the past two weeks. https://t.co/gjxygQ61Be
Stronger border security is imperative, but it cannot be at the expense of compassion, which is why I joined my 41 colleagues in asking for clarification of administration policy re keeping families together. See letter here -&gt; https://t.co/JV9lvy8bpf
Agriculture is Arkansas’s number one economic industry. I was proud to support the passage of the farm bill to give security and assistance to Arkansas’s and our nation’s farmers. #AR02 https://t.co/PTLTGBRNgB
Wages are growing at their fastest pace since 2008. Not only that, but over 4 million American workers have received bonuses and over 87 million people – so far – have seen lower utility bills due to #TaxReform. #checkyourcheck
In the past two weeks, we have successfully passed over 50 bills in the House to bolster the multiple fronts of stopping the #opioidcrisis!

When you lose 65,000 people in 2016 and 45,000 people in 2017 due to drug overdoses, that's two Vietnam Wars of American losses. The opioid epidemic is a big issue. https://t.co/wCOvT1rgSw

We must lend a hand to help Arkansans and Americans go from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We are duty-bound to help our neighbors in need shift back to society. #SOTU
The opioid epidemic has a heartbreaking impact on thousands of our families. Out of the darkness of opioid and heroin addiction, there is  hope. #SOTU
In 2015, 392 Arkansans lost their lives to drug overdose. We're losing our friends, classmates, and family members to the grip of prescription drugs and illegal substances. We must continue to fight against drug and opioid addiction. #SOTU
Our current immigration and border security issues have been inherited from past Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations. I'm committed to fixing our broken immigration system by securing our borders, enforcing our immigration laws, and reforming our legal immigration. #SOTU
I agree @realDonaldTrump - "One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States." We must work hard to reduce high drug costs in our country. #SOTU
I’m grateful that @realDonaldTrump and Congress are working together to roll back and rightsize Obama-era regulations that block Arkansan and American entrepreneurs’ ability to launch and grow businesses.
Proud of our dedicated men and women in uniform who bravely defend our country every day, and for all those who have served in our nation's military. Thank you - you deserve our unwavering support! 🇺🇸 #SOTU
We worked hard to cut America's corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Since then, businesses are coming home, creating new jobs, and raising wages for hardworking Americans. #SOTU2018
We've seen the biggest tax cuts and reforms in history after Congress and @realDonaldTrump worked together to enact #taxreform for hardworking Americans. #SOTU
Looking forward to hearing @realDonaldTrump deliver his #SOTU tonight. https://t.co/SHQ1dcrl2A
