There is a worldwide race to lead in the deployment of #5G wireless. Right now other nations are poised to win. But the remedy for this problem offered by those with close ties to the Administration—nationalizing our 5G networks—really misses the mark.

The White House announced that late next year it will have a new national spectrum policy. But other nations are moving ahead while we’re headed to study hall--and in the interim we’re slapping big tariffs on 5G networks. This doesn't speed our 5G leadership--it slows us down.
Today the @FCC sets up a new Office of Economics and Analytics. To trust its work, two things are required. First, the @FCC must commit to peer review of its work. Second, the @FCC must require anyone submitting studies to fully disclose who paid for them. https://t.co/BqYilW4Jgz

It’s great that the @FCC is issuing fines to bad actors who flood our phones with #robocalls. But this is like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon. Because by 2019 half of all cellphone calls will be scams—and this wave of fraud needs to be stopped NOW. https://t.co/cGEoJU2C6e

Thank you for joining me, @RepGwenMoore and so many others to raise awareness on just how critical affordable phone service can be for victims of domestic violence. #LifelineForSurvivors
During Lifeline Awareness Week it's critical to draw attention to the needs of domestic violence victims, who rely on their phones to get help. Read why I'm fighting to protect the women, men and children who rely on Lifeline: https://t.co/FGiy5Bwg8a #LifelineForSurvivors
Nearly 50 organizations representing victims of domestic violence have called on the @FCC to protect the Lifeline program from cuts. They know just how important a phone can be for a victim of violence. Read their words: https://t.co/3GUQHn35SO #LifelineForSurvivors
Every day 20,000 calls are made to domestic violence hotlines. We need to make sure those lines of communication are accessible to those who need it. We can't let the @FCC hang up on the Lifeline program. #LifelineForSurvivors
The Lifeline program provides low-cost wireless service for those who qualify. Many domestic violence shelters provide these phones to women, men and children seeking aid, shelter, and support. I want to fight to protect this program and ensure #LifelineforSurvivors

Thank you @GovInslee for your efforts to address the #HomeworkGap.  		Today 7 in 10 teachers assign homework that requires internet access.  But 1 in 3 households do not have broadband.

@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan @AGOWA @mnickelsburg @geekwire 24 million people wrote to the @FCC about #netneutrality. Millions more called their representatives, spoke out online, and as I like to say, made a ruckus. We need more of that. Keep it up. I know you &amp; I won’t stay quiet and I hope all everyone following along won’t either.
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan We’re seeing a lot of momentum across the country from small towns to big cities and states to protect #netneutrality. What’s happening on the ground in your state?
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars .@SenatorCantwell, tell us what’s happening in Congress to fight for #netneutrality
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars That’s right. 	  The 	  Internet	  Could 	  Move 	  A lot 	  Slower 	  Without 	  #netneutrality.
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars The internet could be carved into fast and slow lanes. We might have to pay more to access certain websites, see our speeds throttled, or see our internet service providers block content. It’s not right and that’s why I voted against it. #netneutrality (2/2)
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars Think about #netneutrality like a highway. All cars should move at the same speed and have equal access to the road. Without #netneutrality the highway could be turned into fast lanes and slow lanes. And if you can pay more, maybe you get to drive a little faster. (1/2)
@SenatorCantwell @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars There’s no question that #netneutrality impacts all businesses—and especially the tech startups in Washington state. That makes today’s repeal all the more damaging.
@SenatorCantwell @FCC #Netneutrality does impact all of us—whether you’re a student, small business, or just shopping online. @SenatorCantwell, have you heard from small businesses who are impacted by the #netneutrality decision?
@SenatorCantwell @FCC Last December, the @FCC wiped out #netneutrality. I voted against it (my dissenting statement here: https://t.co/HqGnvXUlFo). The @FCC was on the wrong side of consumers, the wrong side of the law. And today, that misguided decision, goes into effect.
@SenatorCantwell A1 #netneutrality means there are no limits on what we can create or imagine. An open internet equals opportunity to build everything from new businesses to new communities to new movements online and offline. (2/2)
@SenatorCantwell A1 Plain and simple, #netneutrality= internet freedom. An open internet means you can go where you want &amp; do what you want online without your internet provider getting in the way and slowing down content, blocking websites, or censoring what you read, see, and learn online (1/2)
Today the @FCC #NetNeutrality rules expire. This puts the @FCC on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public. So now it’s up to us to keep raising a ruckus until internet openness is the law of the land.	https://t.co/cWafs857yN

Today the @FCC roll back of #NetNeutrality takes place.		What happens next? How do we keep standing up, speaking up and making a ruckus to ensure the internet stays open and accessible to all?		Join me and @SenatorCantwell for a twitter chat to discuss. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/p3Tp2e7UgG

The only thing more annoying than waiting for a customer service agent to respond on a 1-800 call is being told you have to pay for the privilege. But inexplicably today the @FCC puts forward a proposal to make consumers pay for toll-free calls. Ugh.		https://t.co/DGampakbXY
We’ve all been there—on hold with a bank, airline, or insurance company. Canned music, getting passed from agent to agent. It’s no fun. The saving grace of this mess is that 1-800 calls are free. But today @FCC proposes to change that &amp; make consumers pay for such calls. Bonkers.
Closing the #digitaldivide is  a noble goal of @FCC policy. But the agency’s rhetoric needs to match its math. In the last month the @FCC has made changes to its accounting policies resulting in $100 million less in funds to support #broadband in rural America. Not good.
We have so many new services and ways to connect. This is good. But today the @FCC gets rid of basic duties requiring carriers to tell consumers when old networks will be swapped out for new—so they can plan for alternatives and reconfigure their homes and businesses.		For shame.
The @FCC takes action on #5G #wireless service today, but fails to be bold and timidly insists on auctioning millimeter wave spectrum slowly, band by band.		This is not the way to be first to the future. This is not the way to lead in 5G.

Millions of fake comments have been filed in Washington regulatory proceedings from Americans across the country who did not write, send or authorize them. 		This is fraud. This is identity theft.		We should be doing everything we can to fix this. 		https://t.co/1bnI4z3OiT
The @FCC #NetNeutrality record features half a million comments from Russia.		What are we doing about it?		Nothing.		That's a problem: https://t.co/1bnI4z3OiT
Just voted at @FCC: Improved geo-targeting for wireless emergency alerts--making them more efficient, more effective, and more likely to save lives.
At @FCC meeting: preliminary report on false emergency alert in Hawaii on January 13th.		Bottom line: We have work to do. @FCC should immediately develop best practices for alerts at the local, state, and federal level--and then ensure they are part of annual state alert filing.
The @FCC has 2 million comments from people with stolen identities in our #NetNeutrality record. When they complain the agency tells them to file another comment saying the first is fake. Please. This is not a real solution to fraud. We need to fix this.		https://t.co/1bnI4z3OiT
The process for seeking public comment at federal agencies needs a do-over. We saw it clearly in #NetNeutrality where @FCC record included 2 million stolen identities and half a million filings from Russia.  We need to get to the bottom of this and fix it. https://t.co/jukacJkRlq

Hoping for this week: an end to the shutdown mess in Washington, an end to laundry pod challenges that do not involve simply getting clothes clean, and an interview with someone in the police department tasked with slathering the civic architecture of Philadelphia with Crisco.
Glad @FCC decided not to lower national #broadband standard from 25 Mbps to 10 Mbps. But let's not kid ourselves. It's time for a higher standard, like 100 Mbps. When we set audacious goals we can do big things. We need to do better than dream small if we want to lead the world.
12 million US students fall into the #HomeworkGap because they lack the broadband access at home necessary to do basic schoolwork. This is the cruelest part of the #digitaldivide. But sadly today the @FCC disregards them &amp; concludes all broadband access is "reasonable &amp; timely."
Glad @FCC dropped crazy idea to lower the national broadband speed standard.  We don't fix problems by lowering standards. But it defies logic that at the same time the agency concludes all broadband deployment is "reasonable &amp; timely" when 24 million Americans lack access today.
On January 13 Hawaii woke to a harrowing &amp; false emergency alert. We need to understand what happened. As Senator @brianschatz said: "This system failed miserably. We need to improve it &amp; get it right." Amen. Let's get to work. My thoughts from the @FCC: https://t.co/6D8F2cA9fb

It's true that you can now read the @FCC decision rolling back #NetNeutrality. But it's cynical and false to describe it as restoring Internet freedom.

This week @FCC cleared the way for bigger media mergers. But I don't think we are going to fix our ability to ferret out fact from fiction, fight charges of fake news &amp; get the information we need to be citizens with less competition in our media markets.  https://t.co/qRh8D1bnfP
The National Thanksgiving Turkey is getting its pardon on Tuesday in the Rose Garden.  Anyone else game (ahem) to admit they find this tradition creepy?
Today the @FCC quietly decides that we need a new television standard. Here's the kicker: it doesn't work with a single television set in any home today. That means we will all need to buy new sets and equipment. Let's call that what it is: a tax. https://t.co/snE5nN6dyZ
Digitization has changed media markets.  But instead of engaging in thoughtful reform, today the @FCC sets fire to the values of competition, localism, and diversity that have informed its media work for decades--in order to clear the way for more mergers. https://t.co/qRh8D1bnfP
Today's @FCC decision on #Lifeline is not real reform. It's cruelty to the students, veterans, Tribal residents, elderly, homeless youth, and hurricane evacuees who rely on this program for the communications services necessary for modern life. https://t.co/3tTqFYwmq2
The @FCC swings and misses on #broadband deployment today. It gives a green light to swapping out old services and replacing them with new infrastructure but doesn't insist on notice to consumers and businesses--who may lose service--in the process.  https://t.co/dmS2EWdh7Q
The US has led the world in the current generation of wireless, known as 4G. But laurels are not good resting places. So it's time to get going on #5G. We can start with the world's first auction of new millimeter wave spectrum in the 28 GHz band. https://t.co/N0lB5snMSi

54 days since #HurricaneMaria hit #PuertoRico. 40% of the cell sites remain out of service. This is an unprecedented loss of communications. It deserves an unprecedented response from the @FCC. But to date no hearings, no report, no date by which service will be fully restored.
