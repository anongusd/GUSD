@danNYdelaney93 @HamillHimself And I apologize for typos.  Typing as I walk in NYC.
@danNYdelaney93 @HamillHimself Mine anymore.  Felt like it ended.  Hope IX changes that and I look forward to seeing Rose in it. She is far far far from worst thing about TLJ IMO.  thanks for listening. :)
@danNYdelaney93 There was good in TLJ.  Kylo seizing power.  Lightsaber battle on destroyer.  @HamillHimself getting the scenes with R2, LEIA, etc. Visuals.  But to say Rose is worst thing in that film...no way. So much wrong on all levels from a SW perspective.  I left feeling like SW wasn't
@danNYdelaney93 Rose isn't best character ever but she's the every man.  The worker bee.  Caught up in a larger narrative after losing her sister.  That's no different than Luke after losing Owen and Beru.  I dig Rose.
@danNYdelaney93 Imagine if it ended with Luke fading away.  Kylo knows where he is.  Falcon shoots off into hyperspace.  Race is on to see who gets to Luke first....man....I'd be counting down the days.
@danNYdelaney93 It looks beautiful and the opening battle is amazing but so much is wrong in ton and characters.  Not ONE person was willing to help LEIA in her time of need.  Death of Luke was unneccsary.  Could have been greatest cliffhanger for a future battle ever but instead needless death.
@danNYdelaney93 Dialogue out of a Marvel movie...laser sword?...Maz Kamata crowbarred in for no reason....they need codebreaker to get on Star Destoyer but Rey waltzes right in...let's rescue the space horses...lets give a solilogy on war profitteering....the Newsie at the end....

@TooFastForBlood Dusty was the booker then.  Not Jeff.
I hope we get more Tag matches like we did on Raw last night.  Those saves during the near Falls were absolutely great. Kudos to everybody involved especially whoever got them to get three segments.
I still maintain they should have put the NWA title on Tully that night. He showed up in amazing shape and it would have been the right finish for that crowd. He easily could have dropped the belt back to JJ at the next TNA taping in a dark match.  A missed moment to be sure IMO. https://t.co/QXzgb6jgNN

The only thing that can hold them back is bad creative.
EC3 should have been there years ago.  Just hand him the Mic.  Lacey has been consistently good in last year and has made great strides.  Cross is awesome.  Tucker plays his role well alongside Otis.  These are all really good choices.
Every single main roster call up is worthy.  Excited especially to see how Lacey and Otis are used.  Otis to me has huge potential to be modern day kids character a la Hillbilly Jim or Santino.

Find where you want it to go and spend your time and money there. You won't be disappointed. -MIKE
Which means that it's time for you to make the big comeback and pick a new roller coaster ride to go on instead. I always say wrestling is like water, it Ebbs and flows and no one can really control where it's going to go. That includes your fandom
A horror or nonfiction book. It's up to you to make the decision to find something that makes you happy. Giving up on wrestling altogether because of a few bad weeks of TV, that sounds to me like you're trapped in a sleeper hold and the referee has dropped your arm twice.
None of that has changed if you make the decision to find the stories and the athletes and the companies that you want to enjoy. If I can't find a book I want to read in the science fiction section of a library, I'm going to walk to another section and maybe choose
At the end of the day everyone reading this fell in love with pro wrestling for some unique reason and wanted to follow the adventures of men and women fighting in the ring as they carried us all through some physical and emotional storytelling.
Especially when you factor in all the amazing stuff taking place in Europe and in Japan and in Mexico which I didn't even touch upon at all previously in this thread.
And renewed perspective on it. Variety is important and if you want to be a pro wrestling fan in 2018 there are lots of reasons to be a fan. Don't give up. There are more great wrestling matches per week than any time I can remember
And recharge the batteries. My advice to anyone who is feeling like Monday Night Raw has made them hit a wall is to go and watch something else and reboot your system.  Not only will you enjoy what you find but it might make you enjoy WWE more because you have a fresher
Discovered it. I love pro wrestling but I'm also lucky enough to dive into all of these different promotions and shows and streaming services and books that continuously reignite my love for it
Who are producing the show you don't enjoy. That's on you for not finding something else you want to watch that you might love. There is no reason why you can't find something else in pro wrestling that speaks to you and makes you enjoy it the way that you did when you first
I had more time to watch and enjoy.  There's tons of promotions and talents that I haven't even mentioned that you have the opportunity to find and discover for yourself. If you are allowing yourself to only hate watch something that you aren't enjoying, that is not on the people
Heck technically WWE itself is its own alternative with the programming that is on Wednesdays on the WWE Network. There's no need to make excuses as to why you can't find something that you can enjoy. There's so much out there right now that I personally want to watch that I wish
My point in all this is that today right now there are more Alternatives available to you and it is so much easier and cheaper for you to find something that you love. There are streaming service is literally dedicated to being the alternative to what WWE puts out.
If I was tired of the Hulk Hogan show, I could go watch The Four Horsemen. If I was tired of watching The Midnight Express (NEVER HAPPENED FOR THE RECORD), I could go watch the Midnight Rockers, etc.
I didn't love all of those products but they were available to me and watching them and seeing the different styles and different talents allowed me to like pro wrestling and have it always feel fresh to me.
Growing up I had the Good Fortune of being able to watch WWF, AWA, NWA, UWF, World Class, Continental, ICW &amp; even Pinoy Wrestling on cable.  This was before I knew what independent wrestling or taped reading was or that they even existed.
Not all of this stuff will be for you and not all of it will be something that you want to invest your time and money in but there is more out there than just what is on the USA Network.
Talents working one night stands before running off to the next town. There are undiscovered hidden gems who are coming up and there are all sorts of different styles and flavors of pro wrestling.
There are more independent wrestling companies running regularly in so many cities that I can't even keep up with everything and there are more independent wrestlers who are busting their butts like modern-day Vaudeville
Of my head. Had it not been for a family birthday that I needed to attend oh, certainly I would have been at one of these shows. Tomorrow is WWE TLC. Last night @MLW had a live TV show.  @IMPACTWRESTLING was on Twitch.
To them and everyone else who feels that way, I want to remind everyone that within a 2-hour Drive of my home tonight there were quality wrestling shows being promoted by @ringofhonor ,@WWNEVOLVE, @HOGwrestling, @HouseofHardcore, @4MonsterFactory &amp; others I am forgetting off top
And this is likely going to be long so I will try and keep it in one thread.  I had someone write me today about how they're willing to give up on pro wrestling because they have hated how Monday nights have been the last few weeks.

Sad to hear of passing of Larry Matysik.  Gave a lot to pro wrestling in so many different roles. Seek out all of his books.  I read his St. Louis book so often I had to replace it.  Wishing his family &amp; friends all the best.  Rest in peace.
@hXcFuller You can pretty much predict the result even without reading it.
@TheRealAZJhawks Piper on Alcatraz was amazing.  Well I'm of the opinion that anything Piper did was amazing no matter how bad it was.
@hamlin37 Yeah.  It was rough to see.
Well, those last punches were something.  Ouch.
@hamlin37 If they are it'll last longer than the fight just did.
Oh Chuck.  Come on man.
I will do my best.  Thanks for caring and supporting! https://t.co/0M6Ed7qdGP
@hamlin37 Its iconic.  They could probably make a decent amount of money going out on the convention circuit together to do posed professional photos with fans.
I am far more invested in this than anything I can remember in UFC in a long long time and it's all based on Rosy memories of going to bars with friends watching the old bouts.
I wonder if everyone watching this Liddell vs Ortiz fight feels the way WCW fans felt watching Hogan reprise his Feud with Piper.  Nostalgia can be a hell of a drug.
@courtbauer Just write the book now.  That's hilarious.
@JayDaYanksGints @ItsBrianShields Katz still has a Godlberg photo on the wall since like 1998 too.
@HapTheCat Remember it's entirely possible they might are the other matches at another time too. We haven't heard otherwise.
@HapTheCat I don't have definitive answer but my guess is they are testing the technology they are using. It's a smaller production scale.
Legit 60 minute bout.  Huge standing ovation after.
Hearing raves about @GoGoACH vs. @TLee910 at @AAWPro.  One to track down and see apparently.

A big thank you to all out veterans, past and present, as well as their families, for sacrificing so much in ways we will never truly understand, so we can live our lives.  We can never repay you for your service.  Thank you all.

@idioticmetsfan @BellaTwins I'm not absolving her mistakes but they are just mistakes. No one in 2018 is going out there trying to hurt someone else.
@ihateatmfees @BellaTwins As I wrote on the site it's a learning moment.
@Derrick4523 There may have been, but I don't want to crucify someone who's in the middle of trying to hold together a match on live TV. I have no idea what was going through her mind although obviously she was trying to get Morgan out of the ring which is what she should have been doing IMO.
Regarding the negative reaction to @BellaTwins, there has not been one pro wrestler in the history of pro wrestling who hasn't made a mistake in the ring at some point. Stan Hansen dropped Bruno Sammartino on his head and broke his neck. Accidents happen.  One did last night.
@MelinaEvolution @PWInsidercom Ridiculous.
@frankp316 It's kind of hard to say the biggest female stars in the division shouldn't be in the division. They make a lot of money for the company. When someone does that, you have to use them.

@JoeDawson8 @SamoaJoe I was speaking of reading from scripts vs. Promos from the heart.  Obviously Joe has always fallen into the latter.  I was also speaking of Raw, not SmackDown.  My point was how much more fun with Raw be if we had more of those promos vs. Scripted monolouges?

Welcome to this week's segment of @SamoaJoe's ring with guest star The American Dragon @WWEDanielBryan.  #MurphyRecCenter https://t.co/FgoKKcNUL5
That was a PPV worthy main event.  @TonyNese @WWE_Murphy @LuchadorLD @WWEGranMetalik killed it.  Well worth seeking out.  Just kickass athleticism, innovative highspots &amp; near falls.
The @WWE205Live main is great.
.@SamoaJoe is ON.  That is the Joe that defined ROH.  Loving so much seeing him Joe kill it.  He and @AJStylesOrg's work this week make me want to get on a plane to Hell In A Cell.   Just incredible stuff.  They are in the zone.
Just announced dark match is Samoa Joe vs. Daniel Bryan.  Very jazzed for that.
That @BeckyLynchWWE promo and brawl with @MsCharlotteWWE was  GREAT from start to finish.  Reminded me an old school Memphis segment.
Really entertaining Smackdown thus far.

Will be interesting to see the effect all of this has on these properties for merchandising, licensing, theme parks etc.  Possible we might finally see original versions of SW films released on DVD, Bart Simpson at Disneyland, etc.
This would also bring Simpsons under Disney banner.
This also means that Marvel gets the rights and ownership of films to Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer, Deadpool, X-Men and all of their associated characters and terminilogy, including mutant, which was never used in any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.
Disney FOX merger approved.  This means Disney owns the original Star Wars film out outright where before they had to work out a deal with Fox to use and distribute.

We will never know the answer sadly but it's interesting to think about. He and Trent Acid always come to mind as names who help set the table for today but never really got to enjoy the meal.
It would have been interesting to see if he would have remained with Ring of Honor or moved on to work for WWE or some other company especially given how much love he had for the international scene and how popular so many names internationally have become on the Indie scene here
Which is a real shame because he had a lot of influence and insight into a lot of things that happened in the late 1990s and early 2000s which began setting the stage for where pro wrestling is today. It's unfortunate he's not celebrated more.
I really wish I could live in a world where Doug Gentry hadn't passed away because it would have been really interesting to see where he would have landed in the world of wrestling by now.  As time passes on I think he's forgotten by some (1/2)

@twynn2510 We discussed in depth on audio today!
And if you need fresh ideas @starwars braintrust, just point me the way to Skywalker Ranch &amp; let's chat. :)
You already have our love.  Thats why we get so engaged.  Cos our friends and family all grew up with &amp; passed on SW to nxt gen &amp; want to keep doing so.  I hope we can.
Whoever runs it going forward.  Dont overthink.  Remember the basic tenants of the franchise.  Make it fun.  Hot rods in space.  Bantering dialouge.  Good vs. Evil.  Love overcoming hate.  You know how it should feel.  Like home.  Good luck.  Entertain us &amp; earn our cash.
I grew up wanting to play in that sandbox.  I still do even as an adult &amp; I am envious of those who get to do it.  I just hope they all bring us the joy we hope for with Episode IX on.
I hope one day thats all @starwars does.  I just feel like I am in the Falcon on some. Swashbuckling adventure when I am watching those movies.  Hope Disney can right the ship.  It will sadden me if they can't bc it would be the most expensive golden goose ever murdered.
@starwars is special to a lot of people.  It used to unite people and be fun.  It used to be about magic and myth and wonder and droids and wookies.  It was the best fairy tale ever.  It doesnt need to perfectly interconnect &amp; it should always be special.  Its meant to inspire.
Reasons but don't have any sense of joy if Kennedy does get axed.  Lucas picked her for a reason.  She did what she thought was right.  I just hope whoever is in charge (Dave Filoni???) Does right by Star Wars even if its Kathy remaining.
Lots of rumors @Disney is about to fire Kathleen Kennedy.    Any moves made should be to benefit Star Wars as a franchise with respect to what makes it special. Nothing more.  If she is fired, she brought us 2 great movies, a solid Solo and well, Last Jedi.  I hated TLJ for many

@obviate Nor I you.  I am glad you enjoyed the film.  I wish I had.  I walked out feeling like the story I grew up with since I was 3 was over and I had no reason to care about Episode 9. That hasn't changed for me.  That makes me angry and bums me out.
@obviate Luke who fought to bring his dad back from the dark side was willing to kill Han and Leia's son in cold blood on a whim? Yeah, that made no sense for me.  If it did for you, great.  Not for me.
@obviate So, no.  Not a fan.  I can live with them killing Han because we got to actually see him be Han.  They can't say that for Luke.  Like TFA.  Loved Rogue One.  Liked Solo.  Every viewing of TLJ just gets me angry.  Hope they can right the ship.  I love SW.  Always will..
@obviate Return.  Now they have no legacy characters really left, fractured the fan base and killed all interest going forward for any fans that supported franchise pre-Disney.  Thats what killed Solo (which was solid and fun) at the BO.  The sting of TLJ hadn't worn off IMO.
@obviate Its a piece of garbage that needlessly destroyed every plot TFA started, made fun of every SW convention, worthless casino subplot &amp; cast Luke as if played by Ed Asner before needlessly killing him without redemption after fans waited 31 years and a whole movie building to his...

I hope everyone has that moment of joy, reflection and happiness in rhe journey if their life.  I am ever appreciative of everything ECW ever brought to mine.  There would be no "Mike Johnson" without it.
That show was very much a gift to me that reminded me how lucky I was in life, how blessed I was to still be here &amp; how that time period changed me for the better.
I went into that show wanting to enjoy it the way I did walking into ECW as a 19 year old in '94. It was last time I went to a show strictly as a fan.  It really was a bookmark event in my life.  I got very emotional realizing I almost missed it and what my life become that night
Seriously, I don't think my friends &amp; I ever had more fun at a show.  This was the end of an entire chapter in my life.  I had nearly died in 2001 &amp; then again in 2002.

Watching @MLW.  Have to give them credit because just over the first 4 weeks of the show,you can see the Improvement in production and look of the show each consecutive week. This is a really easy, fun show to watch. They've done a nice job thus far.  Something to be proud of.

Seriously if @TheDCUniverse wanted to pick up some immediate goodwill they would announce Lucifer as part of the slate of original programming. #savelucifer
@StudMuffinSays @IAmJericho I walked into that.
@lostsassafrass I want to hire Mace and point her at the FOX execs.
@TheBlargg It's that time of year.
@RAWFShowtime No word yet on Gotham.
Canceling Lucifer may be the stupidest TV decision since the cancellation of Jericho.
#savelucifer already trending worldwide.  If only @TheDCUniverse had a STREAMING service it was going to launch and if only they owned the comic the series was based on....OH WAIT.  GET TO WORK. https://t.co/i5vUbp8ap3
So thanks to everyone who worked on @LuciferonFOX.  Sincerely was one of my favorite shows over the last three years.
A BIG flip of the middle finger to FOX for cancelling Lucifer.  I am completely gutted over this one.  What a tremendous job that cast and that production did, every week.  Kudos to every single person who worked on that show.  You all deserved better than this.

@kevinkimmins Yep.  Exactly where I stood.  It really is a testament to how good the casting the production and the work of the actors was that it one so many people over when it had no right to on paper.
@CrusitaSoto I totally understand why he was fired but  he was the firing pin that made the entire show work. His chemistry with Damon Wayans was out of this world and there's no way to replace that. It's the beginning of the end of the show and honestly they should just cancel it.

I just hope this, when itnis finally over, brings some peace to the women who had their lives ruined and for too many years suffered in silence.  This story isn't over yet but I hope we have hit that turning point where they can take a deep breath and take solace in today.
I know I have a stack of records that brought me not growing up that I was ashamed of owning and got rid of a year ago....but I can't expect everyone to look at this the same way.  Books could be written and should be written about the moral and social fallout of this conviction.
He went from groundbreaking in public perception to horrible predator.  Undoubtedly he deserves what he gets but from a sociological standpoint....his standup and acting work...retroactively and moving forward....uncharted territory. Thoughts?
But these are shows that were extremely important culturally in their time.  When and how does one separate the Cosby I grew up seeing on Romper Room's Picture Pages with this man? I am curious how he will be seen 100 years from now.
The truth always comes out in the end.  Justice is served.  What will be fascinating in fallout of this will be seeing if &amp; how people choose to separate Cosby the performer vs. the convict.  How does anyone ever watch Fat Albert again? Or Cosby Show? I can't imagine it.

Ash vs. Evil Dead canceled.  It had a good run.  Starz will be canceled from my cable 10 seconds after the series finale.
Thinking about Trent Acid got me thinking a lot about the indy scene in 1998-2002 that set the stage for the birth of today's national stars.  That made me want to start what I hope will be a fun... https://t.co/SIJCub9nzK

@CatchThePinfall So you want me to take time from chasing and reporting actual news and instead read sites that are incorrect, write &amp; comment on their stories and put a spotlight on them?   HARD PASS.  I'd rather drink bleach every day.
And hope everyone who is sad she retired shows her support in her outside projects.
Just as I was Daniel Bryan.  When a career is cut short, there should be no concern about being *right* - this is her life and she set the table for today's WWE &amp; NXT females.  It's unfair that she can't enjoy the meal.  I wish her the best
Had a few people email me so wanted to address:  I take no happiness in being proven "right" about Paige. The situation is, was &amp; will be a tragedy IMO and I wish her peace, happiness and millions of dollars in her future.  There is no *win* on my side here.  I am sad for her...

Young Jarrius is dead on about organ donation.   I admire this kid. What a spirit.  God bless him and his family.
@Natedawg316 You may have missed the point of my tweet.  It was to point out the importance of their friendship nothing more. If you wish to take it out of context, I don't know what to say and won't comment further.
I completely loved the @RealJeffJarrett speech.   He's given a lot of people opportunities and I hope this New chapter is great for his family.  Laughing so hard at this duet.
If it wasn't for Brian James, Jeff Jarrett would not be on that stage right now.
Fingers crossed for an Eric Embry reference.
What a difference a year makes @RealJeffJarrett.
Joe C. Shout out! THAT DUDE loved wrestling more than anyone who is reading this.  Great way to close out the speech with a dedication to him.
.@KidRock paying tribute to the difficulty of the road life for wrestlers is dead on.
.@KidRock is a lifelong pro wrestling fan who gave back to wrestling with his music.  You can tell he's loving being here. Good for him. Great performer.
.@MorettiIvory's speech was incredible. Loved the shout outs to Lipstick &amp; Dynamite, one of my fave wrestling docs ever and GLOW.  A great great speech.  Loved her story.
This Hillbilly Jim #WWEhalloffame was long overdue and it's great.  He mentioned The Mongolian Stomped! Love it.  One of my faves growing up.  So happy @wwe honored him.  A class man.

Today was rough.
@mikeodd667 @davescherer He was a TAD stiff on Ryder!
@mikeodd667 @davescherer When was this interview from?
@markbreese @Sienna If promoter wants you, they should fly you out. I am specifically speaking of scenario where promoter says hey I want to book you on X date. If its not geographically reasonable to drive they should book a flight.  Some even reimburse gas and tolls.
@markbreese @Sienna Difference is one is predicated on using ones own car.  If worker owns a plane and wants to fly, go for it.  Paying to fly yourself seminar, tryout or even mania weekend to network, I get.  Flying yourself to work indy show in front of 300...not so much.
@markbreese @Sienna The only bubble thing here is failing to understand that difference is in film world you are building credits or working towards union membership.  Here a worker would be sending message they are a mark willing to pay for play.  That rep rarely changes. Its for a "maybe if..."
* should.  Yes there is a typo.
100% in agreement here with @Sienna.  If you want to get yourself to a seminar or tryout, fine.  Promoter in NYC wants to book you and you are from Cali, they shoulf pay for trans.  Period. https://t.co/cjbYzQtPbI

One more thought: In one year, we will either be applauding how Black Panther was awarded or shaking our heads in how it was ignored by the Academy.  I hope very much for the former.
@TWJackFoley @JoePillarToPost They were shocked into Jetski and mustard guns.  It was obvious they were playing SAFE.
@WWEDUTCH Yeah, no doubt about it.  That sucks.  I liked everything he did, even The Mangler.
@TWJackFoley @JoePillarToPost How was it not going to be blah this year with all the poltical and social upheavals?  I was shocked Kimmell even made a Weinstein joke.   It's all eggshells man.

10 - That's all from me.  Again, just my opinions.  Your mileage may vary  You might hate what I think.  It's all art &amp; its all subjective.   May the force be with you.  Except @HamillHimself.  He has it in spades.
8 - Very happy with the Supporting Actor &amp; Actress nods  Both perfect choices in my mind.  	9 - Apparently, I really, really, really need to see Coco.
Not one that deserved to be lauded with awards IMO.  I am just happy that the one person beyond Williams who DID deserve a nomination @HamillHimself was on stage presenting.  He deserves to be center stage.  He is SW &amp; he was awesome in the film.  He deserves the world.
7 - As much as it pained me to see Star Wars completely shut out at Oscars, let's be honest, it didn't deserve to win anything this year beyond John Williams for score.  I can admit it.  I am at peace with it.  Rian Johnson didn't make a good SW movie.
4 - Frances McDormand is amazing and her words should be taken to heart.		5 - Bummer to see John Williams not get another Oscar.		6 - BB8 at the Oscars made me smile huge.
ideas.  I hope this means he gets to do whatever he wants, forever, because I enjoy his work.	3 - THAT SAID, having seen all of the films nominated, Get Out was the best of the bunch &amp; deserved best picture.  I loved Shape of Water but Get Out was robbed..
year's Best Picture winner.	  2 - GUILLERMO!  From Cronos to Mimic to my beloved Pacific Rim to The Strain, I have loved Guillermo Del Toro's work. I am so so so so happy for him.  I hope this sparks more fantasy/horror genre material with big budgets and interesting, unique...
1 - As much as my heart melted seeing Nakajima included in the "In Memorium", to not include Tobe Hooper is pretty ridiculous.  Not everyone can be showcased obviousm ly but Hooper left an indelible imprint in horror films, the same genre that helped to foster this....

The sheer amount of concern from subscribers who owe me nothing since they invest in us already blows me away.  I am so appreciative &amp; humbled by the kindness of so many wonderful, supportive people.  Little things like that
I had to do a shorter than usual audio today bc I had to handle a family matter.  I mentioned that.  I had 18 emails from listeners concerned and/or offering a kind word &amp; even help. Everything is 100% OK but
@josephharris67 @MLW @PWInsidercom Thank you.
@UnstableNY Sigh.
@jmrosad @MLW Pretty much.
@josephharris67 @MLW @PWInsidercom I did some for Donnie B's PCW in Jersey a long time ago.  I wasn't very good.  It's not really the role I should have in pro wrestling either IMO.  I've never sought to be a performer.
Complete MLW Road to the World Championship coverage &amp; latest MJ Mailbag audio now up at @PWInsidercom!
Agreed. @MLW  has a nice mix of 80s style logical build on undercards and big match feel in the main events.  Def.  deserving of more attention, hence why I'm covering it the way I am this morning. https://t.co/fRRpWiZm87
Today at a WWF taping, Adrian Adonis accidentally cut Brutus Beefcake's hair, setting the stage for BB to morph into "The Barber" &amp; help Roddy Piper win his WM 3 retirement.  Enhancement talents regularly politicked for Beefcake haircuts, wanting the extra cash that came with it. https://t.co/Rz8UASQ8zy
Watching @MLW Road to the World title.  Do have to say it's great to hear Schiavone approaching the call like Crockett Tony, not Nitro-era Tony.  Brings great credibility to the entire show, as well as nostagla.  Report forthcoming on @PWInsidercom!
If I could have a cable network play Curse of Oak Island, Expedition Unknown and  Destination Truth, I'd never change the channel.

How has WWE not signed @StokelyHathaway to play the Jerome to @VelveteenWWE's Morris?

It's about time Buddy Murphy got a shot.  Good for him.  Liking the idea of 205 Live as the land of opportunity.
Moral lesson of the day: Be upfront and honest and you will be build a relationship.  Be sneaky and you might get what you need once, but will have ruined all goodwill.

@Daniel_Zamorano Her passing had nothing to do with whether she will was in the HOF or not.  They will induct her one day.
Ivory.  Well deserved.
@TimLeMule @RealJimmyHart Story is true.  Band is wrong.  Hart was in The Gentrys, not the Bee Gees.  Gentrys had a hit - "Keep on Dancing" - Hart's musical background led to his friendship with Jerry Lawler, which led to Hart getting into pro wrestling.
One of the hardest working men in pro wrestling history, @RealJimmyHart made his WWF debut today in 1985 in Poughkeepsie managing Valentine &amp; Neidhart. All time great talker, ambassador &amp; antagonist for pro wrestling.  Plus, he performed 'Eat your heart out, Rick Springfield!' https://t.co/hhN4nZgDGR
Just learned the awesome doc GAEA GIRLS will be screening for first time in 15 years in NYC at @alamodrafthouse in Brooklyn on 3/1.  The British film only screened once previously at NYC's Museum of Natural History in 2003.  I suspect this will be a far more fun audience.
Ingrid Goes West was vasty underrated with some great performances.  Really good socal commentary.  Reminded me of "Big Fan" for Instagram culture instead of sports fan culture.
@RBECERRA21 100% underrated as both.
"I respect you, Bookerman."  People today will never understand the utter chaos, amazement &amp; shock factor of the true original "Pipe Bomb"promo when Brian Pillman uttered those words.

Just woke up.  Mysterio vs. Liger announced for New Japan in Cali.  What a cool attraction.
@yumabooma @aestheticstevie @TheMattKnicks @eyecandyelliott I was actually gonna watch Freelance live but winter canceled their show!
I watched and covered two shows today.  So, what am I doing now that I am done?  I am watching IWA Mid-South to see what talents are in the Mid-West that are worth paying attention to.  Why? I like wrestling and want to see who's the next generation out there.
And I don't want hear, oh he helped so and so.  A big part of any business is networking but the second he walked in that Performance Center he was going to fail or succeed of his own accord.  Getting invited to be there is a victory. Everyone should want that victory.
If the fact Earl Cooter has a WWE tryout right now doesnt show indy wrestlers anyone has a chance to be in WWE and if THAT doesnt inspire you to work harder to get that chance yourself, like Flavor Flav, I got nothing for you man.
Sweet dreams are made of this. https://t.co/yW7UibYlaV

Jay Lethal vs. Jonathan Gresham on the ROH show was GREAT.  Awesome mat wrestling and a great physical story told.  Hats off to them.
Enjoyable ROH show thus far.  In the future, hope they replace this WE WILL RETURN AFTER INTERMISSION video with commercials, promos, hype videos, something.  You have a captive audience.  Promote to them.
Earlier - Bellatrix coverage.  Now - ROH coverage.  Later: Impact via VOD coverage.    Let's go!  All at @PWInsidercom!
I would sincerely pay to have this framed in my office.  Sheer brilliance! https://t.co/QJ4EFFgwpN
EARL COOTER HAS A WWE TRYOUT THIS WEEK.  This is the greatest news I have ever heard.  I am officially done and retired.  Life doesn't get better than that!!!!
I don't care.  True is true.  Funny how no one actually EMPLOYED by Impact feels that way! https://t.co/MXhgoc2yLL
Impact source confirms the "Brace the Impact" show will be available via VOD on Twitch after it airs at 8 PM but did not timeframe as when that will happen. Could be immediately, could be next day,  could be next week.  So, keep checking if you wanted VOD viewing - FYI.
@JordynneGrace @nmatthewsninja The worst part of meeting non-wrestling new friends is accidentally saying "gimmick" in the conversation and getting blank stares.....not that I ever did this...like 12 times.
Rough drop for Impact viewership wise this week but not a shock.  Look at #s for last few years.  Last week in January always peaked and then Feb it began to drop again.  Usual pattern.  Not an indictment on new direction IMO, at all.  Just usual pattern.
Well that main event on @BellatrixFW was something!
Neither has been made clear to be honest. https://t.co/xugS20gdGA
Believe it. https://t.co/1SnHJ3I4Jv
Doing live, ongoing coverage of @BellatrixFW on @PWInsidercom.  Fun little show thus far with young talents &amp; with lots of old school touches not seen in 2018 wrestling.
@a_real_zinger @DCComics I just wanna voice Skeets.
@a_real_zinger @DCComics Show never made it past script stage, but Greg Berlanti is said to be directing a Booster FEATURE FILM.  If that happens, I may quit my job and stand outside the set until they take pity on me and let me.
So, now that we have covered that, let's all go look for some Lizard People with Gov. Jesse Ventura, shall we? https://t.co/jY3owAsq6W
5. Although I have really enjoyed the new season.  Have you?  So, for the 2 people who care about what happened, now you know, although reading the correction post should have been an obvious explanation.  Have a great Friday!  Excelsior!
4. I then wrote up another post, pointing out the error, why it happened and why I corrected the post.  I also apologized for said error.  Despite that, and everything else I reported all week being correct, some decided to create a conspiracy theory.  No X-Files here!
3. Since I was in my car (I pulled over like a responsible driver), it was easier to delete the post then edit via my cell phone.  When I returned home 20 minutes later, I put up the remainder of the post (credited to @pauljordanjr , as it was his material)
2 - Within 5 minutes of the story going up, someone within WWE called to let me know the reason Bryan was no longer listed on TM was bc his session was sold out and told me how I could see his session was actually listed but not active.
1 - I posted a story yesterday noting that it appeared that Daniel Bryan was pulled from his AXXESS signing.  A reader sent that along.  I looked at Ticketmaster.  No signing.  I made a mention of that as part of News &amp; Notes post.  I then left my house to run an errand.
Quick note for the 2 people who will care: Was told someone is spreading a story that I reported "an indication Daniel Bryan was returning to the ring" &amp;/or that I am hiding that I reported said story.  This is the truth &amp; this is how stupidity happens.  Let's dive in.

Yep, fresh and smart at it and he's the right guy, since he's the one writing the TV shows, just as Bill Watts was great in his role for Mid-South.  Dutt knew what he wanted to get over and did it.
No matter what moves Impact makes next, Sonay Dutt should stay on commentary.

I've been in this business fulltime since 2004.  As far as a viable promotion, would you like you like to see my ECW staff laminates or copies of the ECW DVDs I wrote that sold 200,000 copies? https://t.co/EoUov0CiOu
I lost the BigDawg's respect for giving a fair, honest assessment.  Hope Dean and Seth are still in my side. https://t.co/3Ls53svSZY

Impact has never had the level of excitement or fan enthusiasm ECW was blessed to have. https://t.co/yNVetVVLRl
I hope they do.  Don, Scott and Sonjay are a hell of a nucleus.  I never said otherwise. https://t.co/23MJR7D0DH
The oddest thing is when I posted it, I thought someone was going to accuse me of taking up for them. https://t.co/IBfKFKvyEr
@RossLeslieGuy Nah he's in love with Impact.  Thats cool. https://t.co/kg4jRGCfy0
@LuigiThirty Should we start with my childhood?
BTW Newsweek calling me for quotes on Impact today makes all this even more priceless....
Great answers from @AllieImpact &amp; @BraxtonSutter on today's Impact call.  They represented the company well and should be used far more in that regard IMO.
I've been about 100 Impact shows in person since 2004.... https://t.co/jEyzeBCaiU
Gargano vs. Almas says hi. https://t.co/3NxeGB0W9M
Btw responding to all of this while on the Impact media call is priceless.
Not the week to say WWE doesnt provide great wrestling. https://t.co/AaOiRHX9Kg
I havent tried to provide.  I have done it since 1996.  What I did today however was writing a column.  Sorry it wasn't as masturbatory as you want it to be.	  Thats life. https://t.co/xGlSZWEIXa
The silliest part is there are people I have great respect for in the braintrust. https://t.co/sEnKRTIbRX
I get they are fans who love the company.  Their love has sadly blinded them to what I was writing about.  If its a new era, let go of the past which includes reminders that isnt the force it was and without the budget it used to have. https://t.co/Y4gChrMnPC
Impact made you give up on Total Divas? https://t.co/KkiF22DLtZ
I just celebrated 14 years of writing about it full-time.  Honesty helps longevity.  Framing Impact as what it is, starting over, is an honest representation. https://t.co/n5DrKPRrQw
I never said there were no stars left.  Alberto is still there, this week. https://t.co/D1MSvOn6ab
But the article wasnt about WWE.... https://t.co/AaOiRHX9Kg
I was reminding everyone to stop comparing Impact to what it was.  They are the ones who said it was a new era, not me. https://t.co/PF1SGdVnYx
