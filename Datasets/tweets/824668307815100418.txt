@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/xxbU6odzI8
@realDonaldTrump Yeah cuz you‚Äôve always been such a great military hero, right?
@LindseyGrahamSC Just ask Iraq
@LindseyGrahamSC Uh, obviously Syria needs to be dealt with. But let‚Äôs face it, the US usually IS the bully...come on now
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, cars! But what about all of the other stuff we trade with them on? Do they maybe pay a higher tariff on something else they export or we pay a lower tariff on something else we export. Yes. Simply put
@realDonaldTrump Border walls are for pussies.	There. Maybe now you‚Äôll change  your mind. Haha
@realDonaldTrump Do you also believe, like your friend Ted Nugent, that they should be shot, oh wise one?
@realDonaldTrump Yup. Keep blaming Obama...‚ÄùIt‚Äôs ok Mr. Assad. It‚Äôs not your fault...it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs. I know you don‚Äôt know any better Mr. Assad...yes, I know, President Obama should have informed you about Geneva Covention laws. It‚Äôs OK...‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Nobody gives a shit if you two doofuses are friends or not
@971FMTalk @MarcCox971 Really think you should boot Allman....that‚Äôs just ridiculous if you don‚Äôt. Craziness...
@ronbeatyjr @NRA You should seriously move your ass out of the great state of Massachusetts- shameful human
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Yeah. While Trump touted military spending to a bunch of kids waiting to do an Easter egg roll...come on man
@skip_towne @YallRCrazy @realDonaldTrump How was THAT ‚Äúblowing a head gasket?‚Äù Lol
@MotherLoveJones @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs why he says it, I‚Äôm sure.	He‚Äôs definitely ‚Äúthat guy.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer The economy could tank and an epidemic could kill 1/2 of the US but Trump would still only be worried about how he‚Äôs doing compared to Obama. Sheesh. It‚Äôs getting old
@realDonaldTrump The times they are a-changin‚Äô my friend. Deal with it ya snowflake
@realDonaldTrump Yeah like there was ever gonna be one! Hahaha
@realDonaldTrump GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS üé∂
@JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump Looks like a fence. You blind ?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah Democrats don‚Äôt wanna repeal the 2nd A. you uninformed fear mongering piece of garbage
@JTM_YVA @realDonaldTrump Really? Cuz the right said that (among many other falsities) about Obama when he was elected too and it never happened. Lies and bullshit from you ALWAYS
@realDonaldTrump April Fools...jerk.
@SpeakerRyan @AndrejBabis Hurry up and resign goddamnit.
@bbnfan89 @Carolyn_Hoechst @MAGAExpressUK @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs I love America. I just hate a lot of the people that live here...
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Lou Dobbs is quite the conspiracy theorist. Good to know you agree with that garbage
@realDonaldTrump Farm this!
@JimCarrey This made my day! Hahaha!
@robert_hess71 @Dracwyrm @realDonaldTrump Where is your proof of this	Deep State nonsense? Are you just putting all your faith and trust in Infowars?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe has more faith in Dems not being complicit hahaha
@BarackObama So much human greatness in that picture
@ChuckGrassley So are you going to open up a hearing regarding Andrew McCabe‚Äôs firing VERY soon or KIND of soon. Because, you know, the American people are waiting Sir.
@Martin1517Choi @realDonaldTrump No I understood you- your English is fine. I just don‚Äôt understand exactly which law or laws Obama has broken that you think should put him in jail.
@ughh_erin Let them laugh. People making change always get mocked and ridiculed. But know this- the rest of us support and stand with you. My generation didn‚Äôt have to worry as much about school shootings- I can see 100% why you all are standing up - keep at it!
@ConorLambPA Congratulations Congressman Lamb! Well done!
@Martin1517Choi @realDonaldTrump What exactly do you want to ‚Äúsend Obama to jail‚Äù for?
@Peggyost @laxtaxitsme @realDonaldTrump It is true. Unfortunately
@RepShimkus New York with coal burning and New York without...can you guess which is which, sir? https://t.co/NKIgYwvWxP
@RepShimkus Coal is just an industry of the past- it‚Äôs petering out- like other old timey industries haha.	It‚Äôs called human progression- deal with it. New England ruled textile mills in the 19th century then they all went South. THEY managed and adapted ...
@RepShimkus Good lord, that‚Äôs a bunch of bs!
@JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump The ultimate goal is to NOT ‚Äúobliterate‚Äù other countries or people and to use dialogue to reach peaceful resolutions. That is what real adults do. That is what Obama‚Äôs goal was. He was trying NOT to further increase military losses with ANOTHER war
@JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump Trump had nothing to do with this. You watch- the North is trying to make peace with the South to drive a wedge between the South and the US. Mark my words-don‚Äôt be touting Trump as this foreign strategy expert just yet haha
@PressSec You‚Äôre a fuckin coward Sanders. Y‚Äôall are just using veterans to make yourselves look less like human garbage. You could give 2 $hit$. Wht a con
@realDonaldTrump You should build a wall to prevent the European cars from ‚Äúfreely pouring into the US‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump What if that country is dirt poor?
@realDonaldTrump Snowflake
@Amy_Siskind I‚Äôm afraid that he actually has been kept in the dark by the administration from the get go so that if and when Trump gets nailed, Pence can keep the agenda goin- I think it was planned that way
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Oh so apparently stopping a mugging 25 years beforehand is a fucking prerequisite to being a qualified US President.	Come on, stfu	Dumb
@realDonaldTrump Ahahaha! You still don‚Äôt know how elections work! Lol!	More land = more votes?	Hahaha
@NullArcana @steffan_nancy @ree13182 @VoteforMenzim @aremtula1 @trevorHartje @realDonaldTrump Then enlighten me. What is the point of the image? Was it not about these supposed ‚Äú3 million illegal citizens‚Äù who voted in the ‚Äò16 US elections?
@steffan_nancy @ree13182 @VoteforMenzim @aremtula1 @trevorHartje @realDonaldTrump Where does it say they all voted for Hillary though? Those numbers don‚Äôt mean anything. Come back when you get some real evidence...f-f-f-f-fake neeewwwsss!!!
@marcorubio Enough with the friggin bible quotes - ugh. Here, how bout if I tweet a quote from Cinderella.	Same difference man
@FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Fraudulent?  üòÇ
@realDonaldTrump Nope. Definitely not being ‚Äúremoved by the thousands.‚Äù	What a bunch of b.s. How would u be able to prove whether or not thousands of different individuals belong to a particular gang AND remove them from the US so quick? Lies
@realDonaldTrump Not just conservative Christians believe in God or a god you jackass; and furthermore, many believe in no god at all- and that‚Äôs just fine - ok? Got it? This is US in 2017, not 1600s Europe
@ptsalt If I believed there was a hell (but since I‚Äôm not a fairy tale believing jackass, I don‚Äôt), I would tell you to go to it...so instead-go eat shit
@realDonaldTrump ‚Äú...oh yeah, and there was no collusion!‚Äù üòÇ
@JasonKander Same	Gotta listen to the kids
@sandyj0216 @bowyer2018 @johnescareno1 You don‚Äôt know shit about how $ is appropriated in govt- the military gets more than its fair share of the GDP- they just squander it on garbage r&amp;d and projects that never see fruition. They don‚Äôt need half the $ they get to keep an effective military maintained - Eat shit
@realDonaldTrump Hahahahaha	You‚Äôre so ridiculous
@johnescareno1 @End_DACA No disrespect to the vets, but you DO know a lot of them come back from war with PTSD and other mental problems. That could end up being an issue
@bowyer2018 @johnescareno1 Well for one thing- instead of Trump giving like 50 billion dollars to the military which DOES NOT need it, he could put some of that $ toward, these security systems
@johnescareno1 @End_DACA That sounds PRE fect. Haha
@End_DACA @RyanEGraney @BarackObama Always missing the point- no one wants to take away guns. Even Dems. There‚Äôs just no need for guns that get off like 1000 rounds a minute. No need for them -
@thereal_SwaggyP @cjheiden6 @BarackObama Well than why hasn‚Äôt Trump signed an EO either then?	Guess that makes him a coward as well?
@thereal_SwaggyP @BarackObama @cjheiden6 He tried
@dangainor @ktwopines No need for em. Not now. Not 100 years ago. People who want to be John Wayne can go f*** themselves
@marcorubio Marco-	Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and 	again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again...they‚Äôre fucking KIDS
@Margaret52263 @BonnieDowden @charliekirk11 Ironically, speaking of North Korea, he has become Dear Leader Trump to them
@realDonaldTrump Your likes have been down lately. Better hire more bots
@JBitterly @mikebloodworth @realDonaldTrump Rasmussen polls? Pfffft!  Yeah ok! What a load of fake garbage haha
@realDonaldTrump I know right Don?!	Like FOX News! They are SOOO full of shit! You‚Äôre right man. Glad you finally realized this
@realDonaldTrump Positive for who? You and your Wall Street douchebag friends?
@bterp23 @bmin @DerkaCards @realDonaldTrump Uh, MOST people with half a brain
@BearticGaming @Algernon07003 @JPK051315 @Karmatella @realDonaldTrump U probably still call women ‚Äúbroads.‚Äù
@BearticGaming @Algernon07003 @JPK051315 @Karmatella @realDonaldTrump You got some proof there buddy?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah thanks for letting my prescriptions increase by 1500% you fuckin dipshits
@BowlinPat @RealNativeTaino @realDonaldTrump Was already going up- Trump‚Äôs election caused positive speculation cuz those fuckers on Wall St. who fucked the economy 10 years ago love oligarchic capitalist frauds like Trump. All those pricks care about is $$$
@realDonaldTrump Then why did these guys resign?
@Amy_Siskind No leader
@Amy_Siskind Oh the more people that leave, the shittier the people that will enter. It‚Äôs just gonna keep going from bad to worse. Pray that the GOP loses both houses in Nov.
@realDonaldTrump Can we talk about Bayrock?
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Hahaha	You numbskull. A hot mic and in front of cameras, you really think he‚Äôs gonna pull some shit?	He‚Äôs not stupid...he‚Äôs not Trump
@IngrahamAngle You readin a Rasmussen poll? Ok, discussion finished
@RepSwalwell Trump=Ultimate fraud
@realDonaldTrump Time to end your presidency little man
@RealJamesWoods All thanks to Obama and you know it you propaganda consuming piece of garbage. Spreading lies like a fuckin virus ya joke

@ckblv @davematt88 @Goss30Goss @jfablues @realDonaldTrump Then they put pics of a child molester as their profile picture on twitter üòÜ
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a fraud just like the bullshit religious ‚Äúleaders‚Äù at that breakfast - you just want to take advantage of the sheeple that follow that bs for votes...and more $ you fool. If u really ‚Äúfollowed Christ‚Äù you would give all your $ to the poor
@SirmanStella @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump No God 	Show me proof there is...	Fairy tales and bs
@realDonaldTrump Solely a Christian god? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what they intended- they were deists. You don‚Äôt know shit you fool
@realDonaldTrump You fuckin‚Äô fraud. Go to hell you poor excuse for a human
@Amy_Siskind What you do is nothing short of heroic. Thank you
@BlacksForDTrump @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends But maybe she really IS a Democrat? Whooooooooaaaa!!!!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends They‚Äôre like, sooooo much better oh my gawwwd...
@realDonaldTrump No one is marching in the streets of the UK! What are you even talkin about Insano?
@Maggieb1B @HuevosDeChivo I think it‚Äôs more about being logical. Ya know, unlike those people who believe some old man created the Universe and that his human son could heal the sick and cure  blindness but couldn‚Äôt get himself off a wooden cross üôÑ
@HuevosDeChivo @realDonaldTrump Why the fuck would anyone be blaming any particular political party? That‚Äôs retarded you said that
@PressSec I think raises in hourly rates would make more sense
@SpeakerRyan Hey, nationalist thug politicians like you help sow international discord creating these threats. Then you send poor kids turned soldiers over there to feed the flames. You create the cycle but go home every night to your comfy home while the rest of the world broils. Fool
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Oh man! You ain‚Äôt gettin re-elected you lunatic. Those tweets just sealed it hahaha
@realDonaldTrump Hahaha. Claps for himself.
@realDonaldTrump How the hell do you know what they have or haven‚Äôt found?!
@ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump APPROVED. Not LOVED! The bar is set pretty low for https://t.co/6cPVrhOcUL just means he didn‚Äôt say as many idiotic things as https://t.co/vji89Q5jWp
@realDonaldTrump So basically the economy is where it was when Obama left office?
@drzaibkhan111 @EulogyofaSinner @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @POTUS Trump‚Äôs no Republican.	If he ain‚Äôt praising Trump-then he‚Äôs probably a traditional Republican
@SenateMajLdr Cut the shit McConnell
@realDonaldTrump Man. The most childish thing I‚Äôve ever seen
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@RepThomasMassie He DOES act like a dictator and you‚Äôre brain dead if you think otherwise. The supposed liberals who voted in favor are probably assuming Trump will be too busy tweeting while the intelligence agencies and FBI deal with necessary FISA stuff.he‚Äôs too dumb to deal with it anyway
@WBZNightside @POTUS Nice deflection
@RepMattGaetz @MSNBC @ChrisHayesTV No thanks.	I don‚Äôt need reiteration that you‚Äôre a total douche
@cspenceNY Yeah I think that‚Äôs called fascism
@BarackObama You got that right!	Cheers President O.

@Danneskjold_won @thedonaldreddit @jack Hahaha!	Anytime ya fruit
@Danneskjold_won @thedonaldreddit @jack That‚Äôs just retarded	And not clever
@thedonaldreddit It ain‚Äôt just ‚Äúleftists‚Äù upset about it. Trust me
@thedonaldreddit @realDonaldTrump You can be a decent human and help other people from other countries AND still take care of your fellow Americans. It doesn‚Äôt have to be one or the other
@Serafina2112 @Nightscene1 @VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôll still be there. It was underlying before unfortunately- he just brought them out of the woodwork.
@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Yeah unfortunately there are a lot of spoiled closed minded babies still here in America that those remarks wouldn‚Äôt bother. Ya know, people who never go outside of their homes to see how much others truly suffer
@realDonaldTrump You should release your taxes.	You know, balance it out
@realDonaldTrump I stayed in a Trump hotel once. Talk about a friggin shithole!
@SouthernLibtard @realDonaldTrump John C. Reilly?
@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Fox. Believe me, Most Americans will always love and welcome our Mexican and other global brothers and sisters!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah but you need  to START using drugs- like anti-psychotic medication or something
@SJP1972 @jimmygsus @nickle1014 @realDonaldTrump Hundreds?! Hahaha! Out of a country of 320 million?!	That‚Äôs not bad at all!!!
@realDonaldTrump So I‚Äôm other words you‚Äôre moving it up about a week and a half because that‚Äôs about how long you figure it‚Äôll take people to forget about it and you won‚Äôt look like an even BIGGER jackass when it doesn‚Äôt happen?
@realDonaldTrump First try? You forget you ran in 2000?
@heyjudeletitbe1 @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs been calling them fake news for the past year, yet people in his administration continue to do interviews and briefs with them?
@realDonaldTrump If you all think it‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù then why do you agree to do interviews with them? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense!
@SecretaryZinke @realDonaldTrump @VP I hope you realize you‚Äôre just getting yourself into deeper and deeper shit with the public. Good luck
@SierraRise @SecretaryZinke @FLGovScott @marcorubio @LarryHogan Don‚Äôt matter. They just want Alaskan waters and the Gulf
@SecretaryZinke Oh, the public comment period that you‚Äôll just ignore you mean? Go to hell Zinke
@realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt have any respect for anyone or anything. Who you kidding?
@realDonaldTrump Cuz that‚Äôs what a great country that leads does you dumb shit
@realDonaldTrump Hope you have proof of this dishonesty and corruption- otherwise, no one‚Äôs buying it
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity That‚Äôs a haaaaard...hellno!
@TerrorFreeSomal @SpeakerRyan Oh hell yeah. Before he took office people around me were driving all over with those proudly displayed - I‚Äôd see plenty each day. Now, I‚Äôm surprised if I see one in a whole week ...
@SpeakerRyan Listen, I don‚Äôt need you worrying about MY taxes- just worry about the people you represent in Wisconsin and what they want
@SenSanders Hell yeah Senator, we‚Äôre just gettin rollin!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Ya know, me personally,	I don‚Äôt want to be rich. I just want to help my lower and working class brothers and sisters on their feet. That‚Äôs not	Gonna happen with you money worshippers in office
@realDonaldTrump I hope you feel the same way about the Saudis...
@realDonaldTrump Yeah. Like YOU always tell the truth! Hahaha!	Who u foolin?! Hahaha

@realDonaldTrump Why the FUCK do you still give a shit about Hillary Clinton?! Shut the hell up about it! Jesus! Lol!
@realDonaldTrump Arrests don‚Äôt mean shit. Convictions do
@RepGosar Congressman Gosar, do you still believe Charlottesville may  have been a false flag operation perpetrated by the ‚Äúalt-left?‚Äù  Hahaha	I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre a sitting congressman in 2017! Wow!!!! hahaha
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends Look what else Fox and Friends said: https://t.co/wFM01ZK4Ed
@realDonaldTrump If you really believed that, you wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to say it so much
@VP Jesus should‚Äôve been aborted
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm an atheist and I was always said Merry Christmas. You fool. You didn‚Äôt lead anything - it never went away, we‚Äôve just been including others in addition. I hope your Christmas sucks you lying bag of shit
@MaddoggKushEnt @NJTrainDelays @realDonaldTrump They are as much ‚Äúour problem‚Äù as any other US state or territory is
@JesseGofUSA @JustSchmeltzer @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs literally been ON Fox News. Hahaha. Def not a bot
@realDonaldTrump Thanks for letting me say Merry Christmas again. Last year I was afraid if I did that, then Obama would come to my house, take my guns, put me in a FEMA camp and force me to convert to Islam...üòÇüòÇüòÇ	You friggin tool
@FLOTUS @POTUS @NoradSanta I thought you were a Christian? What the hell does Santa have to do with Christianity...you‚Äôre not supposed to be touting that anti-Jesus garbage at the time of his birthday...and remove your Christmas tree- that‚Äôs a paganistic symbol
@VP @POTUS Cool Christmas tree and Yule log- rooted in paganism waaaaaay before Christianity....you‚Äôre not a TRUE Christian
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @POTUS There‚Äôs no god
@realDonaldTrump Man! You basically sent this same tweet out like a week ago. You‚Äôre slipping very quickly
@SeanMcElwee Then they can be thrown out of office and/or hung on the National Mall
@realDonaldTrump How can the President of the US believe and say aloud that an entire nation of people have AIDS and and another nation of people all live in huts ?
@realDonaldTrump Popular amongst who? Oh, billionaires? Yeah...just billionaires. No one‚Äôs getting showered with bonuses...well except for them...
@realDonaldTrump Wtf is Turning Points USA? Another thing run out of someone‚Äôs basement? Like Breitbart hahaha
@1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump Yep. Rich definitely should NOT have been pardoned. Maybe Trump should teach Clinton something then and NOT pardon Flynn
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @JusticeWillett @POTUS Nice going ya jerk

@GDouglasJones Congratulations Mr. Senator! Great job Alabama!
@WBZNightside Also most millenials I know DO write checks every month to the damn banks to pay off those ridiculous high interest loans for college while they work in meager entry level jobs.if anything Your AND my generations were dealt much better hand.That spoiled millennial crap is a myth
@WBZNightside To Dan Rea and caller Barbara- colleges are not intolerant to people with different ideas...just hate filled nazis and bigots...I‚Äôm a 40 year old blue collar worker. I love the diversity in my workplace- nazis and bigots can eat shit for all I care
@PressSec @PresParkNPS Man, you made it ridiculously clear today that Trump hasn‚Äôt the intellect nor moral character to answer ANY and All critical questions posed to him whatsoever...Jim Acosta really has nothing to do with it....You ma‚Äôam are a waste
@RealSaavedra Oh come on. You know what she meant. You can‚Äôt be that dumb can you? You know exactly what she means regardless of your biases
@RealSaavedra Trump is too much of a pussy and too much of a dumb sack of shit to answer any relevant  and intelligent questions . Any media outside of FAKEFOX propaganda souldn‚Äôt even waste their time
@MooreSenate Hahaha! You‚Äôre such a tool Roy Moore. Ridiculous.	ü§üSATAN! 666

@TVietor08 @Rob_Malley Awesome episode Tommy. I learn so much from your discussions- it would be great if more people listened and maybe get a better understanding on just how much US foreign policy affects the world etc. Thanks man.
@realDonaldTrump How the HELL is he a puppet?!	That makes no sense!?
@realDonaldTrump Lol! So it‚Äôs up to YOU?! A man who probably can‚Äôt even locate Israel on a map!!! Lol!
@MooreSenate Nah. We can ignore your crazy religious values...not your pervertedness though
@realDonaldTrump Awfully close to Alabama...what‚Äôs the deal? Why not go all in?
@FLOTUS @SecondLady Puerto Rico?
@RepShimkus Yeah. And my dad was a unicorn and my mother was Santa Claus, ok?
@TerrificTom777 @RepGosar @POTUS Oh. Oh ok. Thank you. My feelings were really starting to hurt...I thought I may have to jump into the last Train to Cucksville
@RepMikeRogersAL Go wring out your panties	LOL
@SteveScalise You guys keep saying ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù like as if you‚Äôre actually not lying about it. Hahaha
@TerrificTom777 @RepGosar @POTUS What?! That‚Äôs it?!	Worst excuse for a troll EVER?!	What are you 12?!	Uh oh 	Watch out for Roy Moore!
@TerrificTom777 @RepGosar @POTUS Goddamn it. You did it again! You showed me up by assuming you have more and better sex than me! Ugh ! I gotta go hide in my safe spot with the snowflakes üò±
@TerrificTom777 @RepGosar @POTUS Yeah you got me. I‚Äôm clearly	crying up a storm while you doofuses keep slowly and systematically getting fucked by your own elected officials. Hahaha. Keep drinking that Kool-Aid dingus. Don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn ya. Being an offensive jackass will only get u so far
@RepMikeRogersAL @POTUS Can we get rid of  radical Christians too you doofus?
@RepGosar @POTUS Eat shit...you and your treasonous President
@washingtonpost After all this bulls**t and DJT is long gone. The govt. should buy up one of his golf courses and name it Bear‚Äôs Ass
@washingtonpost I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and guess Trump couldn‚Äôt name one national monument before he became President...wonder	who swayed him here.
@realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúHi my name‚Äôs Donald Trump. I‚Äôm too stupid to initiate any real policy, so I‚Äôll just undo all of my predecessor‚Äôs because he made fun of me at a gala one night and I‚Äôm too much of a SNOWFLAKE to deal with it like a regular adult.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt forget the racism and bigotry part of the agenda too! Asshole
@realDonaldTrump Oh you're pro-life now?! Hahaha!!!	Sounds like someone else besides Doug Jones is a puppet!
@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada ‚ÄúWrote it‚Äù...‚Äùhelped write it‚Äù...‚Äùread it‚Äù....‚Äùdidn‚Äôt read it‚Äù...eh, what difference does it make? Dirty Dean strikes again

@SenateMajLdr Disgraceful. UnAmerican
@SenatorCollins Don‚Äôt do it. Just don‚Äôt - it‚Äôs not good for the fine people of your state. Change your stance please!
@ZiffyKat @Hanrahan_PNN @cwisme @BTerri64 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Haha! Half of that is just stuff that just happened in government. How is Ben Carson finding an error a Trump accomplishment? Then the other half is just reversing Obama era stuff- a baby could do that. That‚Äôs a really fluffed up list-sorry
@realDonaldTrump @theresa_may Then don‚Äôt focus on Europe either you numbskull-next time THEY have an issue, keep your big mouth shut
@TrumpAmerica45 @realDonaldTrump Another reason Religion is bullshit- Trump is Western Christianity‚Äôs champion right now. Yikes
@realDonaldTrump Yeah thanks to rich assholes like you and your corrupt Wall Street cronies
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews More conspiracy theories...oh boy...who woulda guessed
@realDonaldTrump Yeah but how are the ratings? I‚Äôm sure You‚Äôll let us know...
@realDonaldTrump Hey, ya hear about Roy Moore?
@mle_sarah @JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump Yep. 5 years of Catholic School basically opened my eyes to disavow all religion. All bullshit
@JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump When did Trump become such a hardcore Christian? Hahaha	Gimme a break
@JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump Boy? Dude is like 20. 	Oh and by the way, that‚Äôs fake.	He ain‚Äôt really hitting him
@JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt bother me-I‚Äôm an atheist. But considering all the mosques and religious sites destroyed by anti Islamic	War over the last 17 years, I think the Christians got off easy here
@JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump What was the reason they were attacking them? Does anyone know?
@ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump They told him they weren‚Äôt  coming...he still went...I think he‚Äôs the one looking ‚Äúsilly‚Äù
@toddstarnes know what else @toddstarnes? Most ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù in the US (probably like you and Humpty Dumpty in the White House) are non practicing (aka b.s.) Christians just too scared to call themselves Atheists! This is NO Christian nation! Not by a long shot- but go on keep calling it one
@toddstarnes You idiots know the Xmas tree and wreathed and Yule logs and all that other shit came straight from pagan traditions right? Look it up ya freaks. Ain‚Äôt no fir trees in friggin Bethlehem	Hahaha
@toddstarnes That‚Äôs bull. There was never any ‚Äúwar on Christmas.‚Äù What a bunch of hypocrites- they bitch about being Christ-like and then all line their pockets with millions. Get a life-every religion has a place in USA, including Christianity. bull-SHIT!
@realDonaldTrump Ok, first of all- attendance was low BEFORE the whole kneeling thing. Secondly, most of the teams are pulling in at least 60K- don‚Äôt make it seem like the stadiums are half empty. They‚Äôre not

@PamelaGeller @TrumpsDisciple Other than the headline (that Pamela Geller put up herself)
@PamelaGeller @TrumpsDisciple Ok. But one thing- I didn't see anywhere in that article that said that the couple are Muslims
@TrumpsDisciple @realDonaldTrump And monarchism is just absolute- so there is no far left ideology concerned there whatsoever. Where the hell did u even dig up that bs?
@TrumpsDisciple @realDonaldTrump It's totally irrelevant to where you stand on the poli spectrum. Anarchism is far left. Socialism and Nazism are not exclusive (EVER) ...
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Working hard at yelling at his television like a grumpy old racist (which he is )
@RepTerriSewell Absolutely!	Racists, GET OUT!	Despicable

@AnnCoulter @RichardBSpencer Annie the Tranny
@SarahPalinUSA And good luck to pulling any funding to NFL teams - you'll essentially be taking revenue out of the pockets of nearby businesses that way

@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump ...and trolling Obama/Clinton supporters and the Left like a little child
