It's 2012 all over again: "Don't boo, vote."
Tweeting has been code for Trump in this rally. Obama hasn't mentioned him by name once.
"I don't know about you but we are fired up and ready to go," Clinton says, a nod to Obama's campaign chant in 2008
Clinton says she and Obama went from rivals to partners to friends. "My esteem for him kept growing,"
Clinton says Obama never forgot where he came from. "Donald if you're out there tweeting it's Hawaii."
Wouldn't it have been fun if POTUS and Clinton went back to Unity? Just for old times' sake.

RT @iswanTheHill: The take from @amieparnes and @NiallStanage: There was really only one winner on stage last night: http://t.co/MrZSbUkBQA
Obama isn't on the stage tonight but everyone keeps bringing him up, in good ways.
Notice how many times Clinton has mentioned 'first woman president.' Huge difference from 2008 when she was hesitant to even bring it up.
'Go further' is the new 'daylight' between two candidates, apparently.
One clear winner tonight. The question is, how much of a bump does she get out of this debate.
Email scandal hasn't come up at all yet. Shows how good Clinton can be when she's in her element/focuses on policy.

Hillary Clinton "is not half-baked" in terms of her approach to Syria, Obama says.
