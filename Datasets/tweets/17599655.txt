Introducing @_LivingStandard. This campaign goes well beyond building materials and aims to address and reduce all of the environmental hazards that exist anywhere human beings live their lives. https://t.co/z44P9zmuLq https://t.co/3gomceJ1jG
If we realize how interconnected all of us are in our own daily lives, we can begin to build a new #livingstandard that truly redefines what it means to be human. ➡️ https://t.co/z44P9zmuLq https://t.co/qUvIzeB3cT
"Talking to human beings in terms of how our decision making impacts their everyday lives shouldn’t only be part of the conversation. It should be the heart of it." - @m_raman at #Greenbuild18

We committed to doubling our non-English offerings for #greenbuilding education, and we’re already 86% of the way toward our target — having added courses Bangla, Chinese, Serbian, Swedish, and Urdu. #Greenbuild18 https://t.co/mdbE0N7Nya
The next phase of USGBC’s efforts will be #LEED Positive, where buildings are actually generating more energy than they use, and removing more carbon than they produce. #Greenbuild18
