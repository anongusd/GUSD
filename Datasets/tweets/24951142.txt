‚ÄúIn all fairness to Russia...‚Äù is not a great way for Trump to start a sentence, politically speaking.

Trump ‚Äî AGAIN ‚Äî is totally mischaracterizing how the Diversity Visa Lottery works.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hear it, NBC,‚Äù says Trump as @PeterAlexander gets up to ask a question.	Trump goes on to defend his conduct of the shutdown and negotiations with Congress. 	But ‚Äúon the wall, they skimped,‚Äù he complains.	Also: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already done a lot of wall for the election ‚Äî 2020.‚Äù
‚ÄúThousands... of gang monsters.‚Äù
Trump references ‚ÄúOur REAL country,‚Äù which is the kind of turn of phrase one could write a thesis about, frankly.
Also part of a Trump‚Äôs remarks so far today: Trade with Britain, state of the economy, death penalty for drug dealers, trade with China, state of the stock market ‚Äî and a brief impersonation of Xi Jinping.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people,‚Äù Trump says in seeking to justify his declaration of national emergency.
Trump now noting the past presidents who have signed emergency declarations.		‚ÄúThey sign it. Nobody cares. I guess they weren‚Äôt very exciting.‚Äù		Here, he says, ‚ÄúWe are talking about an invasion of our country.‚Äù
Trump is going hard on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs all a lie, it‚Äôs all a con game‚Äù thing.

One hour, 23 minutes according to my timing. #SOTU
‚Äò@dougmillsnyt is the best, end of. https://t.co/2Njv5mn70W
Pelosi flipping through the pages of Trump's speech, clearly wondering how close he is to the end, is quite something.
The moment with the Democratic women celebrating, to Trump's annoyance, is by far the most visually compelling moment of this SOTU so far.		That'll run A LOT on cable news tomorrow.
After the Democratic women celebrate again, a pretty clearly displeased Trump says drily, "That's great. Congratulations."
Trump talks about women benefiting from the economy by gaining jobs.	Democratic female lawmakers celebrate, mocking him.	Trump: "You weren't supposed to do that."
Trump's phrasing about his commutation of Alice Johnson's sentence ‚Äî "I knew I did something right" ‚Äî could be read a bit more ambiguously than I think he intends.
If I heard correctly, Trump is suggesting that investigations of him and his campaign are endangering the American economy.
Trump:"The State of our Union is strong."	Pelosi: Head-shake.
The"Look Of Disdain" 2020 primary is well underway here.	Strong showing from Gillibrand, with what looked like some side-eye.	#SOTU
@mirandacgreen The thoughts are obviously... https://t.co/8ICTsZxXcq
Key line in Trump SOTU excerpts: 	"No issue better illustrates the divide between America‚Äôs WORKING CLASS and America‚Äôs POLITICAL CLASS than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards."
Sen. Kamala Harris concludes her fairly standard SOTU prebuttal by stressing that people should "tune in" for the official Democratic responses by Stacey Abrams and Xavier Becerra later.

@mickcreaby Yes. His argument really is "I don't like the result of the referendum, so I think we should have a redo since I believe acting on that result would be too damaging."	Okay, I guess. 	The idea that countermanding one referendum with a 2nd will "bring closure" is clearly nonsense.

@XeniaB16 Very. And didn't really disguise the fact that he lost, either.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she thinks Bill Barr's memo last year incorporated "a determined effort, I thought, to undermine Bob Mueller."

The argument in/from the White House was that a presidential address would allow Trump to reset, or at least fundamentally reframe, the shutdown debate.	I didn't hear anything that did that, at all.

@bwcorb @JaredRizzi Yes, but that's not my point. If Pelosi passes a House bill that is in essence the same, the Senate will have to re-vote on it. And GOP Sens. would then have to either a) vote for it (thus breaking with POTUS) or b) explain why they are opposed to something they just supported.
Totally here for any series casting @Maitlis as a Belgian detective, for the record. https://t.co/wmGM8yq2k7
The shutdown is one more illustration of the dysfunction between Trump and Senate GOP.	Politically, one of POTUS's biggest problems is that GOP-led Senate has already passed a bill w/out wall funding.	So what if Pelosi just passes an identical House bill Jan. 3?	Easy checkmate.

Sorry but want to reiterate a point I made earlier today ‚Äî	Rust Belt was pivotal to Trump's 2016 win.	Tonight: Democratic Sens. in Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania won reelection easily. Likely to win in Michigan too.	Don't overlook significance there for 2020.	#ElectionNight
NOW: '@NBCNews predicts Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives.	GOP will hold Senate.
@williamcbrennan Oh for sure. Not saying it is not an impressive result. It clearly is.	I think the original tweet is maybe being misconstrued. I meant specifically people seemed to be thinking *earlier tonight* that he was on his way to victory, and it never looked that way to me.
@juliemason I mean tonight, Mason, tonight.	üôÑ
Not to be all...whatever...but I *did* say people were getting too excited about Beto's chances.	NBC and ABC both projecting Cruz to hold seat.	#ElectionNight
This could end up a much-needed good night for the pollsters.	Overall gist now pointing to solid Democratic majority in the House and small GIOP pick-ups in the Senate.	Which is pretty much exactly what the consensus was.	#ElectionNight
And my recollection is Bradley was projected to win in exits as well. So people said they actually *had* voted for him when they hadn't. https://t.co/U0vRai4Jvh
The @NYTimes needle now pointing to a 29-seat House majority for Democrats, 232-203.	**If true**, that would be a significantly better night than it looked that Democrats were having about an hour ago.
Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), who drew on considerable political skills to keep a district competitive that went for Hillary by 16 points, has reportedly conceded.
RT @BCAppelbaum: BREAKING: The needle is alive.		https://t.co/2W9VAw4Npf https://t.co/vu7GBfUF9N
NBC now saying 70% chance of Democrats taking the House.	Honestly, the big picture here remains unclear. 	For Dems, evening started strong, then the outlook dipped sharply, and it has now recovered a bit.	#ElectionNight

'@SteveKornacki, who is the person to trust in these matters, is projecting about a two-thirds chance that Democrats take the House.	N.B., they thought their chances were better than that.	#ElectionNight
Can't help feeling that Democratic excitement over Beto is distracting from what is looking increasingly like it could be a decent-but-unspectacular night for the party overall.	#ElectionNight
'@ABCNews calls Indiana Senate race for Republican Mike Braun, defeating incumbent Dem Sen. Joe Donnelly.	-- That is pretty much that for any slim Dem hopes of taking the Senate.	-- @RealDonaldTrump went to Indiana twice in the last 6 days of the campaign. He may mention this.

James Carville being appropriately circumspect from a Democratic perspective on MSNBC at the moment.	Some other left-of-center people getting a bit carried away a bit too early imho.	(Which is not to say it won't be a good night for Dems.)
Florida Senate looking like a razor-thin race right now. 	Coin-flip chance of a GOP pick-up.	Rick Scott up right now by a whisker over incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.	#ElectionNight
Second flip: Democratic Donna Shalala takes FL-27 where Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen retired. 	Dems were nervous about this one, even though on its face it should be pretty easy for them to take. (Voted for HRC by almost 20 points)
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown projected to retain seat in Ohio, per NBC.	No surprise at all but recall: 	a) Trump won the state by nine points	b) Early call for Brown suggests a very comfortable win. 	#ElectionNight
It is certainly true that Comstock was one of the most endangered GOP lawmakers. Clinton won that district by 10 points over Trump.	However: With almost 60% reporting, Comstock is down by 17 points.

@eoghan_hickey Sorry, just seeing this. I don‚Äôt want to downplay the dangers that can crop up if you have a small number of belligerent people, which can happen. But most of the time people are nice to individual reporters even if they agree with Trump on the media writ large.
I was Our Man In Pensacola tonight for the Trump rally.	Here‚Äôs what I saw:	https://t.co/0iN9DkFRLm
Chants of "USA! USA!" break out after Trump says his administration is "standing up for our great national anthem."
‚ÄúIt's a little suspicious how those caravans are starting‚Ä¶[But] maybe it‚Äôs a good thing that they did it. Did they energize our base or what?"
Trump says Andrew Gillum is "not equipped" to be Florida governor. "It's not for him," he says.	Gillum is bidding to be Florida's first black governor.
Trump accusing Democrat Andrew Gillum of being soft on immigration: 	"When you have people camping out on your front lawn, remember Gillum.‚Äù 	Huge cheers here for his sending troops to the border to respond to the caravan.
Trump has handed the mic over to Rick Scott, who carefully stays away from any hot-button issues ‚Äî and is rewarded with a modest but steady stream of people apparently leaving.
"A vote for Nelson is a vote for Chuck Schumer," says Trump, amid a long riff about how he's never got a call from Bill Nelson but Rick Scott would "drive us crazy" with calls for help.
"One of the highest-rated nights in the history of television," is how the President of the United States just described his own election.
"Trump plus God equals a majority," says Bowden. Not really sure what that means, honestly.
Now former FSU coach Bobby Bowden brought up for brief remarks as Trump stands to one side.
"He was always considered small for a heavyweight but he made people suffer. He had zero  ‚Äî zero ‚Äî body fat, I can tell you," says Trump giving a shoutout to Evander Holyfield. "I"ve made so much money on Evander."
Democrats will impose "socialism," Trump says. "Welcome to Venezuela!" 	He also says Dems will "erase America's borders," to huge cheers. Chants of Build The Wall" duly break out.
"They'll take away your healthcare," says Trump, referring to Democrats, though his administration is backing a lawsuit aimed at striking down the Affordable Care Act.
"Cryin' Chuck Schumer" and "the legendary genius Maxine Waters," now in Trump's rhetorical sights as he warns of what will happen if Democrats win  big in the midterm elections.
Not a bad campaign prop to have https://t.co/kQTqCCCjkq
Trump on presidential debates: "It's the person, plus the media, against me." Now riffing on how easy the questions directed at Hillary Clinton purportedly were in 2016.
Trump says that Rick Scott is "running against someone who is falling asleep" a reference to Sen. Bill Nelson, who is 76.
"Has anybody not voted? Raise your hand‚Ä¶.Not that bad," says Trump mulling the modest number of raised hands. "But you‚Äôre going to vote, right?"
"If this election is based on crowds, they might as well cancel it because we won," says Trump beginning his speech here at 6:40pm Central.
I shall tweet Trump in Pensacola from here, connectivity and time permitting, but will thread tweets so you can simply mute the thread if you don‚Äôt want to read about that. https://t.co/c1lGmDOy4T
So far, we've had "Under Pressure," "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" all on the playlist for Trump in Pensacola. Haven't heard so much Queen before. 	Perhaps @RealDonaldTrump is excited about the release of Bohemian Rhapsody?

One of the idiosyncrasies of Trump campaign events is the soundtrack, which is quite far removed from the "Super-Patriotic Country" genre usually favored by the GOP.	Currently have "Under Pressure" in Pensacola, following on from the Stones' "Let's Spend the Night Together."

Struck by how many conversations in Atlanta today have centered on @oprah as much as Obama.	She‚Äôs really an extraordinary phenomenon, still. I can‚Äôt think of any other broadcaster whom so many people consider their friend.
Correction (blame the sound-system and the basketball-arena acoustics): Actually "...democracy can't work."
"When words stop meaning anything; when people can just make stuff and there's no consequences; democracy can't win," says Obama.
Obama on GOP claims that they will defend protections for people with preexisting conditions (while 20 GOP-led states sue to bring down the whole ACA): 	"It requires some kind of nerve, some kind of chutzpah. We can also call it what it is: It‚Äôs a lie."
"I believe in fact-based campaigns." ‚Äî@BarackObama
Obama on now and the Civil Rights Era:	‚ÄúJohn Lewis didn‚Äôt sit back and say,‚ÄòMan, I hope some day things get better.‚Äô It happened because some people marched, some people mobilized, some people organized. And when they won the right to vote, people voted to make a better history."

There are two things I know:	1) Politicians' words can be like throwing lit matches on petrol	2) If that fire takes hold, it's a hell of a job to extinguish it again.	So.	Be careful, America.	That's all.
My point is not that Paisley=Trump.	 Or that Ireland = America	But the place where I grew up remains scarred and less-than-normal more than 50 years after the Troubles began.
Paisley, as he always did, insisted that he bore no responsibility for this, or for other acts of violence. 	Those denials were treated with derision by many people, not least some loyalist paramilitaries who believed following him had landed them in jail while he skated away.
In the days afterward, Protestant paramilitaries firebombed a nearby home. Three young boys, Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, were murdered. 	They were aged 10, 9 and 8. https://t.co/2rXPEGzZoG
Twenty years ago, I wrote about a prolonged confrontation between Protestant marchers at Drumcree Church and Catholic residents of the nearby Garvaghy Road. 	I watched Paisley address the Protestants, roaring into the night air.
Before The Troubles burst into full effect, Paisley spoke in a working-class Protestant heartland, called out specific addresses and, according to one definitive biography, said "Do you know who lives there? Pope's men, that's who!" 	A riot ensued.
Any echoes in the current climate, d'ya think?
Paisley was a fundamentalist preacher, an ambitious politician and a demagogue. His demagoguery was built on telling the majority Protestant pop. that they were 1) under attack from a subversive minority; 2) being sold out by establishment politicians &amp; 3) he could save them.
Incendiary rhetoric from politicians was far from the only reason why that conflict occurred, but it was a factor. 	In my opinion, the worst personification of that tendency was the late Rev. Ian Paisley.
During the course of that conflict, more than 3,600 people were killed. The deaths overwhelmingly took place in a territory with a population of roughly 1.8 million. 	That population is significantly smaller than that of Brooklyn or Queens.
I was born in Belfast in 1974. The conflict known as "The Troubles" was by then -- depending on when exactly you date its start ‚Äî five or six years old. It took a generation before the worst phase of the conflict was brought to an end, in 1998, with the Good Friday Agreement.
In light of today's events, I'm making an exception to my dislike of multi-tweet threads and my reticence about getting into personal history. 	Maybe it will at least illuminate some dangers...
The usual Twitter dichotomy at moments like this: 	Very useful for nuggets of actual news, very dreadful for the the avalanche of awful takes.

@KatieBoWill @inihelene I'm confused, KBW, what's happening? 	(I have been practicing in my head btw and I think I'm wrong. It actually rhymes with "hat" as I noted further down. Apologies to you, Ines and indeed the world.)

I know there's a kind of snobbery about local news but don't sleep on the size of its audience.	I do a fair amount of TV of all kinds and, of the times strangers have stopped me to say something about that, @Fox5DC is by far the outlet they most often mention.

Good afternoon from Erie, Pa., where this is the scene with 3 hours to go before @realDonaldTrump is due to speak. https://t.co/3Uerhb8D3F
I first came to the U.S. to cover the 2004 presidential campaign.	At the time, it seemed to me that people who detested Bush's policies also underestimated his abilities as a campaigner.	I wonder if the same is true of Trump and the Resistance.
Trump repeatedly mischaracterizes how the diversity visa lottery system works. 	"They put names in a bin...not their best," he says. 	He never/rarely mentions that the winners do in fact have to submit to a background check by U.S. immigration authorities.
And now lusty chants of "Lock her up!" for...Dianne Feinstein.
Adjectives Trump has used to describe Democrats in the first 10 mins of his speech: "Dangerous," "radical," "wacko," "unhinged."	Also: "The Dims."
Trump basically just shouting out Fox News anchors' names from the stage. 	"Do we like Tucker? I like Tucker!"	Shoutouts also for Hannity, Dobbs, Ingraham, Pirro and Doocy (think I missed some).
"If you did early voting already, go home, have a good time," a notably upbeat Trump tells crowd in Council Bluffs, Iowa. 	Also does his riff about cameras not wanting to show the size of the crowd...as the cameras show the size of the crowd.
I'll be in Erie tomorrow. Sounds like a fun night out.... https://t.co/YlwYEEEb7K

Number of theories I've been told for why Nikki Haley resigned ‚Äî none of them from crazy people or rent-a-quotes ‚Äî is already nearing 10.
"Something doesn't smell right, something's weird," says Mark Sanford about Nikki Haley's departure. (On air now with @craigmelvin on MSNBC.)
That appearance with Haley and Trump didn't reveal much about why someone as ambitious as Haley would leave while still on apparently good terms with POTUS. 	Much reporting to be done.
"Hillary never got it. That's why she lost. Anything else?" ‚Äî @realDonaldTrump
Trump says Nikki Halley has made US ambassador to the UN "a more glamorous position" adding ‚Äî rhetorically, I presume -- "I wonder why?"
Nikki Haley calls Jared Kushner "such a hidden genius that no-one understands."

Sen. Collins doesn't sound like someone who was really agonizing over her vote, to be honest.	Pretty emphatic in asserting that Kavanaugh is the more-wronged party.
News, I think? 	During this Collins oration, the White House has sent an email announcing a new Acting Director for the Office of Personnel Management. 	Unclear what happened with previous director. OPM webpage working fine except for "Director" page... https://t.co/YYQZhlOC6J

@miss_speech It's a bit unclear to me how long they can hold the vote open for. But my guess at this point is that his vote may not be needed in any event.

So a final vote on Kavanaugh will happen before 4pm tomorrow.*	(*Unless I'm failing to understand some arcane Senate rule, which is always possible.)
Kavanaugh has three "yeses" from the four critical senators in the cloture vote, per @NBCNews. 	Collins, Flake, Manchin voting yes.	Murkowski voting no.
@ClydeHaberman Exactly! And thanks.
Usage bugbear: "Woman" and "women" are nouns. "Female" is an adjective.	Ergo: "female voters" not "women voters."	Even more emphatic ergo: "Black woman" not "black female."

Good, fair summing-up from @AriMelber on MSNBC just now: 	Paraphrasing but basically a) Ford made a huge impact b) Kavanaugh not so much ‚Äî but did enough to rally his people, and c) we're basically back to where we were: it's all on Collins &amp; Murkowski.

Kamala Harris is the Dems' most effective questioner in this kind of setting, so it's a bit unfortunate for them that the order of this hearing requires her to go almost last.
GOP strategist with links to WH, who told me earlier that Dr. Ford was "credible" and "impactful," now enthuses Kavanaugh "gets confirmed hand-down." Predicts a couple of Dems could vote for him.
Kavanaugh apologizes to Klobuchar for the weird blackout question.
That was a weird exchange with Sen. Klobuchar, who had just spoken about her own father's alcoholism.	Why does Kavanaugh care, or why would it be relevant, if she has ever blacked out or not?
Anyone else got the sneaking feeling that, after all this sound and fury, the vote will be along predictable party lines after all? #BrettKavanaugh #ChristineBlaseyFord
Flashback: https://t.co/Hu5juASOwP
Exactly this, when it comes to the politics. https://t.co/mneGt6o8ra
I'd like to think Our Divided Nation could agree that Kavanaugh's calendars don't prove or disprove anything germane at all.
There are going to many academic theses written purely on the events of the past 5 hours or so. #BrettKavanaugh #ChristineBlaseyFord
Can't remember who, but someone credible reported Kavanaugh had been advised to show more fire than during the Fox News/Martha MacCallum interview.	That might turn out to be very bad advice, if he goes too far. 	Too shouty right now. Process has become "a national disgrace" etc
Made a few calls/texts during that recess. 	Pretty widespread concern about Kavanaugh's fate even in pro-Trump circles ‚Äî though the depth of it varies greatly. 	Everyone on tenterhooks about how Kavanaugh himself performs.
I hear you all on Rachel Mitchell. 	But worth noting that she's there in the first place because Republican senators wanted to probe for holes in Blasey Ford's account, but were too scared of the political consequences to do it themselves.
@lma1 @scottwongDC No worries, it is actually a fair point, kidding or not. :)
Chuck Grassley seems to get quite a lot more impassioned about Senate process and etiquette than about, say, credible allegations of sexual assault.

So my point isn‚Äôt really about a sign or a chain-link fence. It‚Äôs about people creating inconvenience and risk in pursuit of $$$ and not having the basic decency to spend 10 mins ameliorating those risks. Because time is $$, right? 	Harrrrumph.	The end.
It doesn‚Äôt take some Genius of Foresight to think that might be a bad situation, and one that could easily be avoided. With a sign. But if you‚Äôre throwing up upscale apartments to make $$$, who gives a shit about ‚Äúwasting‚Äù 10 mins throwing up a sign to be considerate, right?
To me ‚Äî able-bodied white dude, who knows the area‚Äî this is a minor inconvenience. But how about to someone of limited mobility? Or old? Or a woman on her own getting off the last Metro of the night?
Did @MRPRealty (if it is them) or their subcontractors do that? Nah. They just left people to walk for 5 mins, either into the parking lot or off the Metro, before finding themselves in front of a fence with no way through and no signposted alternative.
I didn‚Äôt know any of this til today, when I found access blocked by a chainlink fence. Obvi I have no objection to fencing off construction areas. But, with no work evident, it‚Äôd seem reasonable to post a notice or direct to an alternative route. Or just allow pedestrian access.
As I‚Äôve now found out, the shopping center is being redeveloped, apparently by @MRPRealty (though if that has changed, I stand corrected). It appears to be the usual gentrification story, building upscale apartments blah blah blah.
So, I live close to Rhode Island Av Shopping Center in DC. The shopping center has seen better days but its parking lot is used by pretty much everyone as a shortcut between the Rhode Island Avenue @wmata Metro station and the heavily residential area to its west.

The Ocasio-Cortez profile also includes the mandatory musing on the word ‚Äúsocialism.‚Äù I understand why, even though to someone like me who‚Äôd only lived in Ireland or Britain till the age of 29, it always sits a bit strangely.
Just read David Remnick‚Äôs @NewYorker profile of @Ocasio2018, which is predictably excellent and also genuinely moving. https://t.co/PjRzVnzdzh

Joining @megoliver on @CBSNLive at about 7:30 to talk news of the day, of which there is plenty.
Just so we're clear, the point in this evening's @kaitlancollins media news is not, "White House was rude to a reporter" (which is admittedly not great). 	It is: White House apparently wants to paint legitimate questions as out-of-bounds and thus prohibited.
They never promised much in that Rose Garden.
Several minutes into these Trump remarks and it's not clear to me, really, whether he's pledging Talks About Talks (plus EU soybean purchases!) or whether there are concrete changes here.
@COUNTRYMOMCAT Yeah, I actually don't think we disagree fundamentally.
@COUNTRYMOMCAT My gripe, to be clear, isn't with people who hit the wall. It's with companies that are, in my view, trying to seduce people into buying things they cannot actually afford, while presumably hiding punitive terms and conditions in the fine print.
Random point I know, but all these ads, especially on radio, that are some variation of ‚ÄúBad Credit? No problem!‚Äù...	Please.	I guess ‚ÄúBad credit? Don‚Äôt take on more debt then!‚Äù might not work as an ad slogan.
Just like to point out to Brian Williams‚Äô @11thHour viewers, that was @Maitlis you just saw in action with Sean Spicer. 	As was evident, she is the best TV interviewer in Britain.

Trump claims an unspecified news report from @NBCNews was "done by the lobbyists." 	Honestly don't even know what that means.

@Headerop1 https://t.co/iIYFpckWk2 https://t.co/cS3uwJXdaJ
@Headerop1 Sorry, I don't quite get your point. I think many Democrats are surprised that a) the Putin debacle did not hurt Trump more, it seems and b) around 45 percent of the electorate apparently approves of him. 	It's not clear to me that you actually disagree with these points?

But my broader point is: 	Maybe be skeptical of things even when they comport with your ideological preferences? 	It takes all of 3 seconds to check whether a particular section of the Constitution is being accurately quoted. 	And doing so would help ebb the tide of Fake News.
What this means, quite obviously, is that any of these people can be removed if they themselves are convicted of such things. It does NOT mean that convicting one (even if that one is the president) removes all.
What it actually says is: "The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."
The Constitution says no such thing, nor do its actual words carry the implication of the fake news version.

I genuinely don't understand the MAGAs who profess super-patriotism but have no problem with their President effectively siding with the president of Russia over the U.S. intel community.
On MSNBC, @JohnBrennan tells Brian Williams that  ‚Äúgood American patriots‚Äù on Trump‚Äôs national security team ought to resign after that debacle. 	‚ÄúOne can only conclude he fears Vladimir Putin."
The general frame of "On one hand the US says this; on the other the Kremlin says that, so who knows?" was once confined to the very-far-Left.	Now has an advocate in a right-wing Republican president of the United States.
Typo in this, meant to be @JonLemire, apologies.
Not to get too far over our skis here, but Putin did *not* explicitly deny the kompromat charge. 	He basically said he didn't know Trump was in Moscow then, and that you couldn't get kompromat on every businessman who visited.
Most jaw-dropping Trump news conference I've seen since Charlottesville, honestly.
Trump tells AP's @JonLemie that his Director Of National Intelligence says it was Russia, Putin says it wasn't and "I don't see any reason why it would be."	Okay then. 	Also: "President Putin was extremely strong in his denial today."
Trump said basically nothing about Russian actions, hit Mueller, hit Hillary and handed the floor to Putin to answer the interference point. Amazing.
This is astonishing. Asked by @jeffmason1 of Reuters if he holds Russia responsible for anything at all, Trump replies yes only in the vaguest generalities. Then complains about Mueller, says "zero collusion" and talks about his electoral college margin over Hillary again.
‚ÄúI called him a competitor, and a good competitor he is. Actually the word ‚Äòcompetitor‚Äô is a compliment.‚Äù ‚Äî @realDonaldTrump on Putin.
Unless I missed it, Trump expressed no opinion about Russian meddling; merely said he raised it, they talked about it, and that Putin has "an idea" and strong feelings about it.
Trump framing meeting Putin as an act of political courage in the face of criticism from "partisan critics or the media or Democrats."
I believe this is the third time Trump has congratulated Putin on the World Cup.
Don't miss how, immediately after Putin denied election meddling, he suggested that a joint working group on cybersecurity between U.S. and Russia would help...
Putin calling for closer cooperation between US and Russia intelligence agencies.

"I didn't criticize the prime minister," says Trump just now.	Trump to The Sun:  ‚ÄúI would have done it [Brexit negotiations] much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn‚Äôt agree, she didn‚Äôt listen to me."
"Whatever you're gonna do [on Brexit] is okay with us," Trump says, making some semblance of an effort to reverse from that Sun interview.

'@RealDonaldTrump spoke to traveling media for almost 35 mins on board Air Force One this afternoon, per pool. Mostly off-record. 	On record, he claimed, regarding N. Korea, that President Obama "was very close to going to war and he would have lost 50 million people."
Will discuss Pruitt resignation on BBC World News America at around 5pm Eastern with @trowynt.
Yes, the scandals. 	But Pruitt got the job in the first place because he was so skeptical of climate change, and of the traditional mission of the EPA.	Will his replacement be any different in that regard? 	Not sure why s/he would be, given Trump's own thinking.
No support for Scott Pruitt anywhere, really. 	A Trump loyalist who recently spoke to the President about him texts: "Not surprised. Long overdue."
