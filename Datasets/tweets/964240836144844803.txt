@Plantflowes Sad part is that Fox News watchers won‚Äôt even watch the full video...they‚Äôll just believe whatever he tells them
Finally the truth behind Fox News https://t.co/ktLLnvZWfW
@Education4Libs This is such an ignorant and unintelligent thing to say
Trump argued there was a ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù crisis at the southern border. Yea it‚Äôs you inhumanely separating families! 		It‚Äôs like he uses exactly what he‚Äôs doing wrong, twists it and then uses it to defend himself...absurd 		#BorderWall #TrumpSpeach
@Jenn198523 @KAG4All How did the Great Wall of China work? Lasted three weeks, walls don‚Äôt work and won‚Äôt solve any problem

Republicans are out here on social media ripping the democrats not being bipartisan and funding the wall		It‚Äôs like they have completely forgotten about how the republicans did the same exact thing to Obama for eight years #GovtShutdown
Do we know if Chris Wallace is still alive after calling out Sarah Sanders BS statistics? #FoxNews
It‚Äôs so obvious that the government shutdown and ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù rhetoric is Trump playing to his base and giving him talking points for the 2020 election #GovernmentShutdown
@Toneman807 @Education4Libs The Great Wall of China failed in three weeks...walls do not work
@RawieDarren It‚Äôs pretty wild how devoted Republicans are to Trump. It‚Äôs like all logic and objective thinking has gone out the window, so yes, the dems need a strong candidate. Especially someone who can connect with people
I agree with everything Elizabeth Warren is saying on Maddow but I don‚Äôt think she can win an election against Donald Trump		We need more charisma and connection with middle America

@adamantone1 @BillZankich @1776Stonewall Also...if you want to believe the media is ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or ‚Äúhaving an agenda‚Äù you may be right. It DOES NOT mean that Trump is telling the truth either
@adamantone1 @BillZankich @1776Stonewall Please remember ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù is not original...Reagan in 1980 said that first
Twitter, Facebook, or any other social media platform or website are allowed to set their own rules and policies and govern those how they want, whether that‚Äôs promoting your agenda or not....this is a free country and they are within their rights to act as such
This isn‚Äôt Russia or China, private companies are allowed to make their own rules and govern them however they like, if you don‚Äôt like it too bad
The same way that alt-right and anti-Semitic websites are allowed to promote hate speech and racism, maybe you guys should go hangout there
For all the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù twitter accounts upset about how twitter is handling such accounts...they are private companies and are within their rights to act as such
@Education4Libs These are private companies, fortunately in the United States, they have the right to do whatever they want...in fact they are acting within the rights they have in this great country...whether you like or not
Hike up military spending....distract the country, I just know it‚Äôs coming
It seems like a good time for Republicans/Trump to make up a war...I really hope that doesn‚Äôt happen. We don‚Äôt need to be in any more phony wars!
@1776Stonewall Is it possible to be a republican and not support Trump?
Blockchain could also be used for Americans to vote on policy change rather than elected officials who vote based on the interest of those who donate to their campaigns....just a thought
All of the recount issues could be solved by using blockchain technology to vote rather than written ballots		Blockchain could also help solve major gerrymandering issues in this country #recount #ThursdayMotivation
The US holding 12,800 migrant children in detention centers. Five times more than a year ago.		This is eerily similar to the early hitler days and it‚Äôs disgusting
Trump is using Hispanics the same way that Hitler used the Jews. The scary part is that republicans won‚Äôt stand up to him. 		We need to get out and vote to stop this mad man!
EPA penalties under Trump. This is a perfect representation of where his priorities are...help the rich get richer https://t.co/zlL8C9lQoy
For everyone trying to discredit the op-ed in The NY Times because of the anonymity of the author...		Anonymity is vital to journalism and is key in order to get stories like this out because people fear for their jobs. There is no problem with the author remaining anonymous
A new proposal would allow the federal government to detain migrant children indefinitely. Essentially keeping them in prison camps...remind you of anyone? This is ridiculous and unjust! https://t.co/ushcgZin4i
Cory Booker is a true patriot! This is exactly what we should expect from our politicians		He refused to let Republicans protect their SCOTUS nominee by hiding his emails...this is what the American people deserve 		#KavanaughConfirmationHearings
Leaked Kavanaugh documents discuss abortion and affirmative action and he also lied under oath. 		The mental state and motives of Trump are questionable and members of his own cabinet say he is unfit to be president, he should not be nominating a Supreme Court judge!
Senator Booker on Kavanaugh hearings ‚Äúthe system is unfair, unnecessary, unjust, and unprecedented on this committe‚Äù  		Everyone should go read the leaked documents about racial profiling so republicans understand who they‚Äôre appointing #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
@yehti75 @ItsReallyMeKW @1776Stonewall Not here...I just want a president who is a decent person, not one who rips off poor people (trump university) or racially profiles his renters, or has multiple sexual abuse allegations, isn‚Äôt a womanizer. You know just overall basic decency
I love how Nike is debuting the Colin Kaepernick ad during the NFL season opener tonight...		I don‚Äôt think we have seen this before, Nike is a corporate sponsor and their just giving a big bleep you to the NFL and it‚Äôs awesome #NikeJustDoIt

@1776Stonewall It was actually a senior White House official who brought up the 25th amendment...
Okay so you either believe Woodward who has years and years of credible journalism experience or you believe our president who consistently lies and is a twitter troll! https://t.co/u0V1axnaco
In Woodward‚Äôs new book		‚ÄúTrump stumbles, lies, and lost his cool during Mueller interview prep‚Äù		This book is not ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS MEDIA‚Äù as President Trump would want you to believe 		#MuellerTime #MuellerIsComingForYou
Bob Woodward‚Äôs new book sounds fascinating...no one is calling this book fake news except the White House		He is an incredibly honest journalists and one of the best in the business
It‚Äôs crazy how people will boycott Nike over a black man protesting social injustices but won‚Äôt protest the Catholic Church for sexual abuse

@Plynn329 I don‚Äôt want to argue either or be a bully, I understand your side of the argument. 		Many didn‚Äôt agree with how Martin Luther King Jr. or Muhammad Ali went about their protests but they were heard		I just wish these NFL players would be heard also ‚úåÔ∏è
@Plynn329 Unfortunately, for whatever reason the conversation has been hijacked by president Trump. 		So now it‚Äôs become a political issue instead of a human rights issue		Protesting racism should never be a political conversation...
@Plynn329 By the way...they are protesting racism, systematic racism, police brutality, and the overall injustices being done to the black community 		The small minded tunnel thinkers will have you believe they are protesting the flag and the national anthem
@Plynn329 So because social injustice has been around for hundreds of years we shouldn‚Äôt talk about it? 		Do you know what else was around for hundreds of years? Slavery, women unable to vote, gay/lesbian unable to get married...		Should we have not talked about those things either?
I hope the NFL players keep kneeling		They have the right to protest social injustices that exist in this country 		The conversation has been hijacked by president Trump and somehow this is about the flag and not what they‚Äôre protesting 		#nflprotests #Anthemprotests

Kneeling during the national anthem should NOT be a political conversation 		It‚Äôs about social injustice and systematic racism...none of which should be political at all. 		It was made political by Trump to gain support from his white voters 		#BoycottNFL #anthempolicy
Telling the NFL players they aren‚Äôt protesting the ‚Äúright way‚Äù is like telling Rosa Parks to make her protest from home...		They can protest however they want and it‚Äôs working because everyone is talking about it		#BoycottNFL #anthempolicy
I‚Äôm gonna lay into the NFL pretty good here until the season starts! 		This is America, people have the right to say and protest whatever they want. 		#BoycottNFL #anthempolicy

Didn't think so #GunReformNow #SocialJustice
@FoxNews @newtgingrich "Every school in America should have several teachers and administrators trained in firearms who are permitted to carry concealed weapons" Adding more weapons isn't the solution and who will pay for this? #GunReformNow #GunControlNow https://t.co/2Gl2zMnYmI
@FoxNews @PressSec The only facts we have are that 13 Russians and 3 Russian organizations illegally tried to disrupt the American political system...let's all hold off on jumping to conclusions until more facts are brought to light #RussiaCollusion #13Russians #MuellerInvestigation
Agreed the investigation needs to continue regardless of what political party you stand for #MuellerInvestigation #Mueller https://t.co/FuGO0zV6LC
@1776Stonewall Because they want to disrupt America by getting everyone into a fight by playing all sides and turning this country into a divisive mess....either way Russia is winning and we are losing #Mueller #MuellerInvestigation

@Liz_Wheeler @clarkeygirl166 Or we could take it out of our $600,000,000,000 military budget which is about 450,000,000,000 more than the next country...#GunReformNow #GunControlNow
@Education4Libs Let's hold off from the conspiracies and make our judgments based on facts #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
@AmericanHotLips @LATiffani1 @maddow The only facts we have are that 13 Russians and 3 Russian organizations illegally tried to disrupt the American political system...let's all hold off on jumping to conclusions until more facts are brought to light #RussiaCollusion #13Russians #MuellerInvestigation
Although essentially every news network has an agenda, the propaganda being spilled from Fox News 24/7 is something to pay attention to...I advise people get their news from multiple sources and not just a single one, as many do. #MuellerInvestigation https://t.co/9GYn28DU6J
Here is what Fox News has to say...you can decide who you want to believe https://t.co/NQCWn16c2r
Here is what CNN has to say... https://t.co/3HSXIOyEev
@DoYouMineCrypto Being that I just graduated from an established university I have to say there are some major flaws in our education system and there is absolutely room for #selfeducation and having #morethancommensense is something we should all strive for...
@wrthomasson Thank you! I will try to be a voice for what I believe and most of the country believes is right and just!

@SRuhle @KingJames #LauraIngraham comments are an absolute joke, incredibly racist and ignorant. Lebron, KD, and many more athletes need to use their platform to shed some light on racism and hate in this country #SocialJustice
Facts do and should matter...pay attention people https://t.co/WHT5aVURXk
@jfreewright @IngrahamAngle @KingJames #LauraIngraham comments are incredibly racist and ignorant and she should be ashamed of herself. I praise Lebron and KD for using their platform to shed some light on these issues in America, we need more athletes like them #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar
@GQMagazine Unbelievable what she said, incredibly racist and ignorant. I hope more athletes like Lebron and KD continue to use their platform to shed some light on these issues #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar #LauraIngraham
I hope athletes like Lebron and KD continue to use the platform they have to bring these issues to light #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar https://t.co/qRAWuhSM3l
@roybelly Love the show guys... I love how you talk about race and shed some light on some of the legitimate problems we have in this country. We need more athletes like Lebron and KD, keep towing the line!
@JOEL9ONE Her comments are outrageously racist and ignorant...I praise you and these NBA players for using their platform to shed some light on racism and hate in this country, we need more athletes like you #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar
@JulieAnnSilver @JuddLegum Her comments are incredibly racist and ignorant. Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich have been critical of DT for his entire presidency, she waits until now to attack the NBA and its players? When black men use their platform to talk about race issues and our president? #SocialJustice
@JuddLegum These comments are an absolute joke, she should be ashamed of herself. Incredibly racist and divisive... We need more athletes to use their platform to shed light on these disgusting cultural problems #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar
@thehill Her comments are absolutely ludicrous,we need more people like this in sports using their platform to shed light on these problems in America. If anyone says anything that goes against DT and his state news network they pounce on it...especially when it comes to race #NBAAllStar
@JuddLegum I absolutely love this...I praise them for using the platform they have to let their voices be heard, we need more people like this in sports towing these lines to really bring about change to racism and hate in this country #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar
Shame on you @IngrahamAngle black NBA players have the right to speak their opinion. I praise them for using the platform they have to get these issues out into the light, you should be ashamed of yourself for saying some of the things you did #SocialJustice #NBAAllStar
@JamesDoss50 Im saying it isn't very logical to compare the US to a country that is ran by the cartels and has a corrupt government. The numbers and stats state very clearly that when stricter gun laws are enforced in **developed** countries...gun crimes go down, do some research
@FoxNews Why there will be no action on gun reform....#GunControlNow #GunReformNow https://t.co/aThPkdvEsR
@JamesDoss50 Unfortunately you are misinformed, when comparing the US to **developed** countries where there is legitimate police and legitimate government in place....where stricter gun laws are enforced there is less gun violence and the numbers are staggering https://t.co/TKoH8iPTIr
@forgottenson09 @JinSaotome @FoxNews Yes, most gun owners are fine and will not commit these heinous crimes, but it's the small few that ruin it for everyone, just as is with countless other laws like speed limits, drugs, and many more...
@forgottenson09 @JinSaotome @FoxNews A simple place to start which seems fairly rational and most people will agree with is that we shouldn't be able to go buy AR15's over the counter...that is one simple step that get us a little bit closer to being better
@forgottenson09 @JinSaotome @FoxNews Yea that's a good article but it doesn't really back up your point at all. I personally am not here to ratify the 2nd amendment, but the reality is the US mass shooting problem is a MAJOR problem that doesn't really exist in any other country, clearly something needs to be done
@jeff_curlee @JinSaotome @FoxNews Go find me some data to back up your point that these incidents happened in gun free zones...I am only offering the statistics which cannot be argued, bring me statistics on how adding more guns makes this better and I will listen...#GunReformNow #GunControlNow
@forgottenson09 @JinSaotome @FoxNews Go get me stats to back up these claims and I will listen...
@TomthunkitsMind Here are the facts and data about big pharma contributions.... https://t.co/j4mtPCi75A
@FoxNews YES...we need to look at gun control and mental health together. Neither of which Republicans are motivated to change or increase funding to #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@FoxNews @BarackObama In most countries it takes one mass shooting before they make change, we have hundreds here....hundreds. Nothing gets done, I don't believe we are the ones doing it right and the rest of the world is wrong, when will it change? #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@JinSaotome @FoxNews or this? https://t.co/0mPStTqnZH
@JinSaotome @FoxNews or this? https://t.co/8EGaUHPTpo
@JinSaotome @FoxNews What are your thoughts on this? https://t.co/Kso1W3XBFW
RT @johnpavlovitz: .@realDonaldTrump and the @GOP own this carnage.	They manufacture it.	The lobby for it.	They legislate it.	They cannot b‚Ä¶
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine sorry guys "modern sport rifles"
@RedNationRising @TreyStockton You don't know my position on abortion, your entire account is optics and propaganda....you haven't presented any facts or data to back up some of the ridiculous things said in this video, just gas bag non sense
@RedNationRising @TreyStockton great response lol
@TreyStockton @RedNationRising I won't waste another tweet on you lol
@TreyStockton @RedNationRising blood money to fund campaigns? https://t.co/HITr5R1ihx
@TreyStockton @RedNationRising https://t.co/8NEx0OU4gO cuts largely help the rich not the middle class so obviously condemn them 4. exploit the black/hispanic, gay, women community? DACA, everyone can get married now, a woman ran for president lol
@TreyStockton @RedNationRising 1.Kneeling for the national anthem is about protesting social justice for African Americans not the flag or the military 2.Trump has done nothing to get more African Americans employed, math tells us that lower UR rates will lower UR amongst all races
@clonethemac @JamesDoss50 sorry...."modern sporting rifle" are you happy now
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Lets connect these dots... walk into store, purchase assault rifle, purchase magazines, walk into school, pull fire alarm, shooting spree.... #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@LouisianaEagle @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Why am I caught up in this robot war lol #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@JamesDoss50 Ask yourself this question and just say it out loud and see if it makes sense....Should you be able to buy an assault rifle over the counter? #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@Jillibean557 Would it not be better to make it harder for the crazy person to acquire an assault rifle? We have zero control over mental health, but what we do have control over is policy....lets focus on the things we can control to try and get better #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
@JayCory7 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Another problem...robots are having fake arguments with each other all over twitter and social media (see above). Russia is winning....
@LouisianaEagle @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Thanks for your input robot...as I said in the first place, there is no perfect system and it is impossible to completely remove all evil and all firearms, all we can do is try to get better, there are easy adjustments that can be made here #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@RedNationRising There are so many things wrong here...what a gas bag propaganda goon
@NRATV @DLoesch #GunReformNow #GunControlNow https://t.co/G6oK4efnqO
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Unfortunately we have almost zero grip on how to solve mental health problems. There is no perfect system and no perfect way to fix these problems but I think an easy place to start is by restricting over the counter sales of assault rifles #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama Well saidüá∫üá∏
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama Obviously we can't stop all evil or remove all weapons, but we can get better....there are things we can change to make these types of massacres harder and that makes so much sense and almost everyone can agree with that #GunReformNow
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama No system is perfect...all we can do is get closer to better, restricting over the counter assault rifle sales is such an easy and logical first step
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama I hate that argument, "there will always be tools for destruction" by that logic we should just let North Korea and Iran acquire nuclear weapons because "even if we do remove nuclear weapons they will harm us another way, so what's the point" the point is we can make it BETTER
"common sense gun safety laws that most Americans want" #GunReformNow #GunControlNow https://t.co/3MDiw0IwGN
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama I believe an easy place to start is by controlling the things we can control...restricting the sale of assault rifles over the counter seems like an easy and logical place to start #GunReformNow
@CNN @CNNOpinion Yes we need to pay attention to warning signs, yes we need to take a deeper look at mental health. We also need to make it harder for people to acquire assault rifles #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
@CNN "politicians are not going to take the risk unless they know they're being pushed"....speaks to one of the biggest problems our current system has, policy isn't being driven by logic and what's right but rather political standing, money, and lobbyists, it needs to change
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama Also, it is highly unlikely we would ever get a 3/4 vote because money and the interest of lobbyists is driving public policy, which is a major problem with our current system on both sides republican and democrat, but when it comes to gun reform.... https://t.co/TWSTpoCInW
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama It's a very good point you're making here...I agree we should also focus on why, I don't believe we should ratify the 2nd amendment but there is a happy medium to be found and I think (as well as most of the country) that an easy place to start is assault rifles
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama Something needs to be done, something has to change, this is a MAJOR problem here and we are doing nothing....we're one of the only countries not reforming gun laws, in most countries it takes one mass shooting to get reform, we have hundreds here....hundreds. Nothing changes
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama So many other countries have done this and been successful...it's not impossible, and it will make getting these weapons a lot harder than it is now...which is better right?
@FoxNews @Judgenap Wrong https://t.co/AkgjDnMTUj
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama I don't think making all guns illegal is the answer but we can start with assault rifles,makes too much sense. Mass shootings are such a big problem in this country and other countries are doing things to fix it, why can't we do the same? No system is perfect, lets make it better
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama Many Many countries have reformed there gun laws and have seen drastic improvement, do you believe that Australia and Japan are oppressive regimes?
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama You think the left is taking away free speech? DT wants to end free press, he hands out fake news awards to reputable journalist, and controls everything @FoxNews does....threatening free press threatens the first amendment
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama The founders believed that when we had muskets, its 2018 and I can buy an assault rifle and many magazines over the counter, I don't think they saw that coming a couple hundred years ago. I don't believe removal of all guns is the answer but there is absolutely a happy medium
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama almost no countries have similar firearm laws compared to the US...that's the problem, the rest of the world is being progressive on this issue. We must be doing it right though?
@FoxNews @BarackObama Why there will never be gun reform.... #GunControlNow #GunReformNow https://t.co/rFAPltQjSs
@brentjones009 @SustainableFred @FoxNews @BarackObama What about by country? #GunControlNow #GunReformNow https://t.co/sBmCSHI41l
Yes, there is lobbyism that contributes to gun reform.... https://t.co/ogQO8gOtPl
@ClintHoward5 Its drastically less.... https://t.co/dwYcvNd91M
Why we will never have gun reform....policy is being driven by money, not what is right for the citizens of this country #lobbyists #GunControlNow #GunReformNow https://t.co/JuhgbxXvxT
To those of you who believe we should put more guns in the hands of citizens to guard against mass shootings...the data tells us otherwise #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #guncontrol #MassShooting https://t.co/6rplGGaK8v
There is a mental health issue in this country, however, to say that guns have absolutely nothing to do with mass shootings and gun violence in this country makes zero sense, the data says otherwise #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #GunViolence #guncontrol
https://t.co/IKKRRd9Zix
https://t.co/BkuZ3LaEm9
One of the biggest problems in this country is lobbyism...public policy is not being driven by the betterment of the people or what seems rational and logical but rather by the interests of lobbyists. We have made bribery legal.
