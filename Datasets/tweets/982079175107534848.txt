@realDonaldTrump Wrong!
@realDonaldTrump We will see how much of a hoax it is when you're on the outside looking in, or maybe inside looking out.
@realDonaldTrump Your party broke the system, now people suffer. You should be so proud.
@realDonaldTrump We already have a wall. And you already have $1.6 billion dollars from the last budget you haven't touched.
@realDonaldTrump You might want to talk to the actual farmers, because they are not pleased with your legislation.

@realDonaldTrump Lmao, I cannot believe we have a president that calls someone a "RAT".
@realDonaldTrump An innocent person would use the word liar. GUILTY people call them RATS, think about that!
@realDonaldTrump GREAT, I can't wait for the tweet lol. Whomever it is, I am sure they will be the GREATEST Secretary of Interior EVER lol.
@realDonaldTrump @RyanZinke Do you work for the citizens of the United States or for Twitter? You have done more work on Twitter than you have for the citizens of this country.
@realDonaldTrump The American people are still waiting for your "great" healthcare plan, where is it? Perhaps, Mexico was supposed to be working on that as well?
@realDonaldTrump No, they don't. Because the people in the military doing the work actually make below minimum wage. And that is the only reason you sent troops to the border.
@realDonaldTrump No, what will make communities safer is tackling poverty. You know that thing you admired from your penthouse suite.
@realDonaldTrump We have border protection, we also have walls. How about we take care of the poverty in this country with that $5 billion dollars you want to spend, which not be enough and you will ask for more.
@realDonaldTrump How much is Mexico contributing to the wall? Oh yeah, nothing. Sounds like the rest of your business deals. Perhaps when you're building your next campaign plan, you won't allow your staffers to make up unrealistic plans.
@realDonaldTrump They looked thrilled to see you. FYI, when the flag goes by you at half staff, your hand should be over your heart Mr. President.
@realDonaldTrump Renewable energy!
@realDonaldTrump Said who? Not your previous business partners or the contractors that you hired to do work for you that never got paid. Definitely not the 4,000 plus people that filed lawsuits against you. Did you rate yourself again?
Today is election day. Make sure you get out and vote in the general runoff election!

@realDonaldTrump Isn't there a homeless Veteran you could help nearby rather than wasting your energy on Twitter? You have been self absorbed since the 70's, probably longer. Look at me, look at me, it's getting old. Do something useful!

@realDonaldTrump Way to use our military as a chess piece to put up some of your wall.
Our troops are coming home after a few weeks of being deployed to our border (unnecessarily). This administration, @realDonaldTrump, should be ashamed of themselves for using our military as a political chess piece to obtain votes. @GeorgiaDemocrat https://t.co/mQmgWBuFJU
So now after receiving much criticism our president is making arrangements to visit our troops overseas. I'm really glad we have a Commander in Chief that takes the initiative.
