Meanwhile my colleagues in the Democratic Party have been pushing for solutions. The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct solves family separation at the border. And unlike what Donald Trump and his cronies want, this bill focuses on the health and well-being of all the children.
The executive order and these bills DO NOTHING to reunite families that have been torn apart.  Parents still don‚Äôt know where their babies are.
These bills that Republicans are offering do nothing to help DREAMERS, even though they know losing Dreamers would cost America $433 billion in GDP over the next decade.

I voted NO because Vladimir Putin interfered in our country‚Äôs presidential election, and this bill does nothing to protect Robert Mueller so he can get to the bottom of it.
I voted no because the bill sets our country back by $400 billion, denying American citizens jobs and higher wages, all by failing to secure a place for Dreamers.
I voted 'NO' because this bill spends $1.6 billion of American taxpayer money for a border wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.

Working families need more access to fresh produce, not less. The President‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúfood box‚Äù proposal would make it more difficult for working families, reducing their food budgets and limiting their choices at the grocery store.

Trump‚Äôs decision to end TPS for 200K Salvadorans is inhumane. They pay taxes, serve in their communities, and call America home. America is supposed to be a country for those who want to work hard and contribute to their society. This decision is simply unAmerican. #SaveTPS
Trump decided to end legal protection for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans who have called America home for decades. This irresponsible &amp; senseless decision will not only negatively affect our country‚Äôs economy, but it will also tear thousands of families &amp; communities apart #SaveTPS

I will vote NO on #HR38 because it makes it more difficult for police to do their job. #HR38 is opposed by law enforcement, @USMayors, @AmerAcadPeds and many others.

TODAY, instead of trying to prevent gun violence, Republicans are actually passing an NRA priority: #HR38, which allows untrained people to carry a concealed gun ANYWHERE in America.

As a Representative of people, not large corporations, I will not support this #GOPTaxScam. Republicans have turned their backs on the middle class &amp; add $1 trillion to the deficit in the process. Who benefits? Not the middle class, not the country, only #TrumpsBillionaireFriends
The next step for the #GOPTaxScam is yet another closed door meeting. Early next week we'll find out who will be at the table. Certainly not the American people.
As you might have heard, Republicans passed their #GOPTaxScam bill last night at 3 a.m. This is not a tax reform bill and it is not a tax cut bill. Trying to please their donors, Republicans have stitched together a mixed bag of horrible giveaways to large corporations.
Seriously, this is not a drill. Turn on C-SPAN, now! The bill is 479 pages long, full of handwritten changes, and nobody, not even the Senators, have had time to read it. #GOPTaxScam being jammed through right now.

More fun facts: @AARP @AmerMedicalAssn @ahahospitals @ANANursingWorld all oppose this bill. Thats seniors, drs, hospitals, and nurses for ya https://t.co/piHXU9eV8M
Also puts an age tax on older Americans, allowing insurance cos to charge them 5x more than younger folks -- is that on your quiz @HouseGOP? https://t.co/piHXU9eV8M
But for fun -- I also know that it doesn't protect folks from pre-existing conditions, and will make their insurance rates go thru the roof https://t.co/EbrMt1fXEj

.@potus is worried about helping "next wave of refugees." They're here. You're deporting them. Stop &amp; give them asylum from rape &amp; murder.
#SOTU: medical research is critical. It's critical to the Valley too! We can create the 21st Century Cures right there at home!
#sotu: immigrants aren't the reasons wages haven't gone up. Food stamp recipients didn't cause Great Recession. Right on @POTUS.
.@SpeakerRyan and @potus, we must tackle poverty and give our kids a shot, part of that includes keeping them out of justice system! #SOTU
Great #sotu message for working families: "no hardworking student shld be stuck in the red. Now, we‚Äôve actually got to cut cost of college."
But, #SOTU: Its harder for hardworking family to pull out of poverty, harder for young ppl to start careers &amp; tougher for workers to retire.
