@Pherekydez @mycroft16 @EdKrassen We don't know. All we do know is that the internet has expanded rapidly over the last two decades. And it did so without net neutrality. Net Neutrality seeks to take away the 1st place trophy and give everyone participation trophies instead. In the name of "fairness"
@mycroft16 @EdKrassen What's next? Used car neutrality? Coffee neutrality? Cell phone provider neutrality?
@mycroft16 @EdKrassen Every time a provider attempted to get an edge pre net neutrality they were sued. And lost horribly. That said competition is healthy. A socialism approach to our internet fixes nothing. It just allows government to pick winners and losers.
I will admit it becomes very petty when Government ignores current events and threatens businesses because they no longer offer a discount. Flip the coin? Can Government threaten businesses to give discounts? Its the businesses choice. Not Governments. https://t.co/6TYk0Uzp2P
@EdKrassen If it ain't broke why did we pass #NetNeutrality in the first place? Anytime an issue was discovered it was settled by lawsuits. Keep the internet truly free. No Net Neutrality.
