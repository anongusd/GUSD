RT @CDC_Cancer All women are at risk for gynecologic cancers (cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, vulvar).#CDCCancerChat
RT @CDC_Cancer Uterine #cancer is most common gynecologic cancer. Ovarian is deadliest. Cervical is easiest to prevent. #CDCCancerChat
RT @NOCC_National: There is no screening test for ovarian cancer. A Pap test DOES NOT detect the disease. #cdccancerchat
@cdevos28 One way to reduce risk of #ovariancancer is by taking oral contraceptives http://t.co/U0JnvLvSDL #CDCCancerChat
RT @CDC_Cancer Each gynecologic #cancer is unique, with different risk factors, signs &amp; symptoms. #CDCCancerChat
22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers #CDCCancerChat
RT @CDC_Cancer About 83,000 US women get a gynecologic #cancer each year &amp; 28,000 die from one. #CDCCancerChat

Q: what should women do if they live in a state with no gyn oncologists? #OCNA13
Dr Bast: we need better predictive biomarkers to know which patients will (not) benefit from a particular drug. #OCNA13
Ms Decker: Complementary treatments for neuropathy include reflexology, magnets in shoes. #OCNA13
Responding to a Q from Twitter: radiation not used often as primary therapy. Most oncologists prefer chemotherapy. #OCNA13
Dr Bast: what we really need are studies showing whether soy is safe for women with estrogen-responsive #ovariancancer   #OCNA13
Dr Kauff: re: soy and #ovariancancer, like many things in life, moderation is probably key. #OCNA13
Ms Decker: for cancers that are estrogen-responsive, patients may want to avoid soy. No studies of soy and #ovariancancer yet #OCNA13
