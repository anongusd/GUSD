Mr. Rosenstein must commit to naming special prosecutor when he appears before Judiciary Committee tomorrow 7/7

Special prosecutor would have built in oversight. Congress is notified when counsel is appointed, removed, or finishes investigation 4/
Special prosecutor could only be removed for good cause, such as misconduct. Can't be fired in order to quash investigation 3/
