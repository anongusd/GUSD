This will blow your mind! 	‚†Ä‚†Ä	‚Ä¢ Young Living's BCP? 55%! Wow!	‚†Ä‚†Ä	That‚Äôs the highest concentrated cannabinoid available. Yet because it is not a cannabis derivative it will never show up on a drug test or make you high. Boom! #Copaiba! #EssentialOils #CBDOils #plantbased
And while it's different from #CBD, it directly affects the same CB2 receptors and is a much more concentrated form. For example:	‚†Ä‚†Ä	‚Ä¢ CBD derived from hemp has a 2-4% concentration.	‚†Ä‚†Ä	‚Ä¢ CBD derived from cannabis/marijuana has a 5-35% concentration.	‚†Ä‚†Ä	But wait...
*What you may not know is that there's a THIRD type of #cannabinoid--BCP (aka #Copaiba). #BCP is the long lost relative we always hoped we'd find!		#CBD #EssentialOils #HealthyLifestyle
... and 	-nervous system support	-neuro health support	-supports insulin levels	-cardiovascular health	-and more!		*THC is the controversial component that interacts with our CB1 receptors which is responsible for causing the "high" associated with marijuana. #cbd #copaiba #oils
CBD is all the rage. But #Copaiba may be a better option. #CBD interacts with our CB2 receptors and gives us incredible therapeutic benefits such as:		-support occasional pain relief 	-supports decreased inflammation	-reduced anticipated emotional feelings	-healthy cell support https://t.co/Qch52Qctvi

We may not understand it, but if it‚Äôs ended, it wasn‚Äôt meant for you. I believe when this happens, there‚Äôs something bigger and better waiting for you. 		I hope this encourages you!
How much time do we waste wondering why something has ended? Whether it be a friendship, relationship or job, there‚Äôs a good reason it‚Äôs over.
Never put a question mark where God has put a period. When something is over and done, let it go and move on to the next chapter of your life. https://t.co/D7GHrTgHUk

@anniemal And with all that commotion and people attacking him, I'm not surprised he was taken aback at someone coming at him. If you've never been in a situation that chaotic, maybe give people a little grace. The fact that people are outraged over this is ridiculous to me.
@anniemal I see a whole lot of lip movement, saying who knows what, but I don't clearly hear anything except at the end. That's part of what concerns me. Plus, it was crazy town in there, who knows what he heard or didn't hear.

@heyitsaaron @cstevenson7 That‚Äôs great. None of the schools I went to in South Fl had that. But here‚Äôs the thing, they knew this guy was trouble. If there were better security, they could have called the police. Imagine his pic in every guard station. Maybe he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in.
@johnhawkinsrwn @Rach_IC Agreed! It‚Äôs so ridiculous to me that we secure our Fortune 500 companies &amp; big corporations better than we do our schools. We should care more about our kids than our CEOs! How about guests stations in lots &amp; security taking photo IDs &amp; license #s. Lock schools &amp; buzz people in.

Why is it harder to get into a Fortune 500 building or big corporation than it is to get into a school? ‚ùì Why don‚Äôt schools have guard stations taking down license plate numbers &amp; photo IDs before letting people into the parking lots? I know why. $$$ BUT why is it ok?

@didyousaytacos Crazy right?
@6jacks @NCBlogNet Thank you! Our system is going to emergency heat automatically but it just isn‚Äôt getting warmer than 57 - 63 in some rooms. And it‚Äôs only gone up into the 60s cause we put the gas fireplace on.
@nicholee Thank you! I definitely need to cover the bottoms of the doors. #ncwx
@ToddBrison Hahahahahaha!! https://t.co/jXcK4WsEQe
@didyousaytacos This is all new to me &amp; blowing my mind. I just can‚Äôt imagine heat not working to heat your home when it‚Äôs freezing. Like, isn‚Äôt that the point of heat? #ncwx
@SherryHintze @downeastheating Got it up to 60 in my room with a space heater
@NatashaBright77 Thanks! I appreciate all the info. I‚Äôm using a Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater as well. They‚Äôre not making a difference in the larger rooms but they do well in the smaller ones. I just can‚Äôt imagine heat not working when it gets freezing.
@didyousaytacos Thanks! It‚Äôs stuck at 57 right now.
Hey North Carolinians, how do you keep your home warm if heat pumps don‚Äôt do much when temps drop below freezing? We can see our breath inside the house. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. We‚Äôre freezing! #ncwx #mycrystalcoast #ecnc #nc #NorthCarolina https://t.co/e9CaC4KNnD

@CarteretCoGov How do people stay warm around here if heat pumps don‚Äôt heat homes when the temps drop below 32 degrees? #ncwx

@SherryHintze @downeastheating Thank you! We‚Äôve got 2 &amp; got the fireplace on &amp; it‚Äôs still 57 inside.

@SuburbanPropane You should stand by ALL your customers - like the ones with no gas, elderly parents &amp; small kids who are freezing while you lock tanks, fail to show up for deliveries and price gouge. #suburbancares #OrDoThey? #custserv #CustomerService #EpicFail
@scottlarsonclc @SuburbanPropane They never seem to be able to handle demand. I hope you‚Äôll call th corporate office and report it. This is common practice it seems. They locked my tank &amp; want me to pay $95 to get it unlocked. While we have no heat &amp; 75 gallons IN the tank.
@cabledawg71874 @SuburbanPropane Seems like this is a common practice at the local level. Maybe we should all call the local news.
@garza_p1 @SuburbanPropane @downeastheating Yup! Dayngr no happy
@garza_p1 Currently freeeeeeezing @SuburbanPropane has no checks &amp; balances and locked our tank &amp; @downeastheating sold us a brand new system that seems to no longer be working properly. :(

@AskMarkWard @NBCNightlyNews Well, she did marry him
RT @chefjoseandres: 7,000 sandwiches out the door by 9am today to feed families in Rio Grande, Sabana Grande, Ciales, Hatillo, Patillas, Co‚Ä¶
@AskMarkWard @NBCNightlyNews I don‚Äôt think he is with THAT many people coming forward but then again, I put nothing past political agendas.
@AskMarkWard @NBCNightlyNews Maybe she thinks her husband is innocent. Christians do believe that the battle is the Lord‚Äôs and that we should put on the full armor of God.
@SwayWithSway Yes. The peach fuzz is adorable but I‚Äôm so not ready.

@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Again, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the original. We were friends for a while and I never saw any of that. He was humble and funny &amp; kind. I do that you were dealing with a troll/imposter.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Now it's tattykins. Last I heard PreppyDude kept in touch with both of them.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard She‚Äôs changed her name
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Crazy! Well, last I'd heard he divorced his wife. Not sure who got the kids. And he married someone he met on Twitter.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Not the same guy. Not even close. I get using accents etc but that's someone else. He left Twitter (can't recall when) &amp; Facebook and it sounds like someone took the opp to use his name &amp; play some disturbing games. He's someone I talked to often.

@politico @sanuzis Coincidence? I think not.
@DarthGarry Bwahahahahahahaha
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard I honestly don‚Äôt think it is the same person. Nothing in the voice is the same.
@vicequeenmaria *if you‚Äôre writing* oops
@vicequeenmaria You should talk to @GioLovesYou - especially if you let writing stories about Weinsteinesque harassment. She‚Äôs looking for some help in better her story told. Maybe you can point her in the right direction.
@GioLovesYou Ain‚Äôt that the truth. You do know he was married, right?
@GioLovesYou I don‚Äôt know who that is. That‚Äôs not the person I knew as @foulbastard. My guess is that someone took his account when he left Twitter &amp; assumed his identity. You‚Äôre looking  for the wrong guy. That‚Äôs not even his voice.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard It seems to me that if you‚Äôve been involved with this person, you‚Äôd know who his friends were &amp; who he was married to. Those are the folks you should be talking to. I‚Äôve already said, you know as much as I do - actually more if you‚Äôre saying there were all those aliases.
@GioLovesYou If you want to be a victim that‚Äôs your choice. Or, you could hire a lawyer and go after the bastard.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard I‚Äôm not involved. I haven‚Äôt talked to him in years.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard You‚Äôre funny. First you say you remember me &amp; now you found me from some rando note - but won‚Äôt share who it‚Äôs from or when. My advice, get a lawyer if you‚Äôve seriously been stalked or harassed. And perhaps seek counseling.
If someone were stalking me &amp; harassing me on Twitter, I would block them, not be copying them on every tweet. But that‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôd also be sure to make my account private. You know, if I were serious about not being stalked &amp; harassed. Crazy right? https://t.co/fH2wAK5AE0
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Fab. Send the link to it. I‚Äôd love to see who it‚Äôs from and when.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Sounds to me like you know more than I do. If that‚Äôs the case, it would make more sense to speak with the people he was closest to. That wouldn‚Äôt be me, on Twitter. Like I said, last I heard he was married. But you should know all that if you were in a relationship with him.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard You still haven‚Äôt answered my question about th note.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard And according to you, I don‚Äôt know him anyway &amp; have been duped, so not sure I‚Äôd be much help to you.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard ... and who wrote that note referencing me and when?
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard So you‚Äôre telling me that though you don‚Äôt know me and we‚Äôve never spoken before today, you remember me being friends with someone from 9 years ago? Yeah, that‚Äôs not strange at all.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard I mean, me of all people.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard What made you reach out to me?
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Can‚Äôt say that sounds familiar.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Because I don‚Äôt actually know that what you‚Äôre saying is true. As I mentioned, I don‚Äôt know you. You could be a stalker. You have no real photo or any identifying info &amp; you‚Äôre asking me to give you someone else‚Äôs.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard I really don‚Äôt know you. You don‚Äôt have any identifying information. And, last I heard he was happily married with little time to bother anyone. My guess is someone took over the twitter account name.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard Yes, we were friends.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard @Apple Also, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm understanding how you‚Äôre not getting legal help if you have proof you‚Äôve been hacked, stalked and illegally spied in. The @FBI doesn‚Äôt play when it comes to cyber crimes.
@GioLovesYou @FoulBastard That‚Äôs a long time. But it doesn‚Äôt sound like the @FoulBastard I know.
