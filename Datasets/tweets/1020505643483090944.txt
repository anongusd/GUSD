@Shaithis1404 Ok it is time to stop.  You are assuming that they will always have money. I am telling you that is not how it works. The world is not a limitless resource on anything. That includes the NHS.  You are seeing limits all around you and refuse to see it could happen to NHS.
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders "No free speech üòÇ, that is laughable." Start posting about the pedophiles in the Muslum community in the UK. See how long you last.

@Shaithis1404 Let me try this way.  What happens when there are not enough resources to care for all that need it? Do they A continue forever and continue to raise taxes over and over again. Or B do they limit care for those they deem too sick?

@SaRaAshcraft Zero.  That requires math skill.  That requires #CriticalThinking.  That requires that there are boundaries. They think zero does not apply since is of course ZERO.  :P
@Shaithis1404 LOL yep call me out.  I am not wrong.  There is a limit and they do limit care.  Web searching for dummies.  https://t.co/FODjBlUsvN
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders "Unlike America where you have to pay before they‚Äôll treat you." not true in all cases.  But for elective care yes funds need to be decided before treatment.  How is that bad?  And state your source.
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders The MSM has been lying to us in the US for over 50 years.  This has been a bitter pill for most to swallow and for us to realize.  I dont know if that is true there.  But I do know that your news can be silenced since you do not have free speech.  Elton John come to mind
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders That is for you to decide.  I will not and should not tell you who to follow.  You are a big boy you can make your own decisions. Since I dont live in the UK is the local news following the unrest in France? If they are good. If they are not then ask why?
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders Are you really this clueless.  THERE IS A LIMIT ON THE TAXES.  THEY WILL CHOOSE FOR YOU HOW YOU ARE TREATED.  THAT is my only point.
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders Good I am glad you have a choice.  IS that a choice there or in another country?
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders So piss poor that people fly here from around the world to use it.  Stop following the MSM.  YOU and I can agree that healthcare is way too expensive. But to say the US has "piss poor" health care prove you are clueless and are following the MSM like a slave.
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders You obviously like and care for the NHS.  That is fine.  All that I have been pointing out is to understand their limits.  And I hope and pray you dont get into a situation that you have to question those limits.
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders What I am telling you is you do NOT have a choice to care.  If they decide to not care what is your option?  Vote them out?  LOL you will be dead by then.  Nothing changes.  You cant vote with your money and go elsewhere...
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders I am not telling you they are going to suddenly go belly up.  I would wage an argument that they are not as funded as you think they are.  Age has noting to do with this.  In the US we have Social Security.  It is tax funded. And the politicians cant keep their hands out of it...
@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders Crazy me for doing a quick web search.  You are right us "idiots" will happily keep our tinfoil hats when we can #ThinkCritically and stop following what is fed us.  It is time for you to ask questions and red pill and stop following what if fed to you.  They are LYING TO YOU!

@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders You made my point.  Taxes. There is a limit.  They will and do decide if you get treatment.  Mark my words. This is NOT a bottomless pit of care. They do draw a line and stop treatment.  And you DO NOT get a choice when that happens.

@Shaithis1404 @genuinelyross @BernieSanders And, how is that paid for? A magical money tree? NO! TAXES. Your taxes. Your taxes pay for others to get care. YOUR money is used for someone else. And when that money runs out what do they do? THEY make choices on YOUR care. So if you are TOO expensive you dont get care.

@Concern58719548 Sex Trafficking.  Drugs.  Crime.
@Concern58719548 Avoided no.  Deep rabbit hole yes.  Let's start with ONE value.  The first job of the federal government is to protect the citizens of said government. The Democratic party has proven over the past 50ish days that they do not care about our safety.  Why discuss any other "value"?
@Concern58719548 Why give more than what is requested?  How does this benefit the taxpayer?  Hint: It's never charity and typically benefits the pockets of someone one that controls the flow of this money.
@Concern58719548 Nothing.  Nothing is more effective than a wall.  They slow down the intruder so the "other" methods work better.  I assume you understand this.  So, why make me explain it?
RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!

@VanDea5 @StillJohnCA @realDonaldTrump I dont believe everything.  But for you to think it is not a crime is poor thinking.  It is obviously a crime.  It is time for people like yourself to ask questions.  If you had the server you would be in jail.  You would NOT have gottan a free pass....

@Concern58719548 @adriandt31 I would tend to believe this thought direction.  There is no true way. The only way it through polling.  That is what he did.  Based on polling he the followed logic and then applied math.  This is not any different than how polling is used in the US now.

@Judd5ter @wesley_jordan @realDonaldTrump Tell that to all of the people that have more money in their paychecks.  More people working leads to more tax income which leads to less nation debt which leads to long term positive consequences.  Just like Reagan in the 80's...

@Concern58719548 @adriandt31 At what time does the math work? He said 50% and 70%. Lets cut that in 1/2 and stick to the 1st number. 205*.25=51.25 million radical Muslims. That is more people than California. To get 5 terrorist out of that number we have to * by .0000001

@Concern58719548 ALL violent groups need to be dealt with by everyone involved.  Family, friends, law enforcement.
@Concern58719548 Fringe groups don't get press.  BLM tons of press and air time.  ANTIFA again lots of press.  So, I didn't identify "fringe" groups.  They are mainstream.  There is a difference.  They have agendas are are being helped by the MSM.
@Concern58719548 I agree with you on most of this.  The ones that promote this type of hate is very much part of the problem. All of MSM is guilty.  Maxine Waters is very guilty.  Interesting that those two examples are either Liberal or have very left leaning views.

@Concern58719548 If Liberalism is actually going to be a group of people that that makes sense they as a group need to address this.  ANTIFA needs to go.  Their physical threats on others that dont think their way need to go. ETC...
@Concern58719548 Thank you.  It is intended as an insult.  Liberalism as we see it today is a mental disorder.  They cant argue.  They cant think.  They cant reason.  So, that leads most rational people to conclude they are mental and walk away...

@Concern58719548 I am willing to talk more....But what is your motive?
@Concern58719548 Liberalism in this current age backs ANTIFA, Nancy Pelosi, Mad Max, Obama, Hillary Clinton.  The ones that are doing #walkaway have figured it out that liberalism is a mental disorder.  So, why do you ask?  You want to a argue? You want to have a discussion?
