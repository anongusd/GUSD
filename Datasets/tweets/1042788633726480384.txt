The way we women become better, stronger &amp; United is by continually helping one another. "It takes a village." 		I offer to babysit a couple times a month.. for free.	One of the ways I uplift other women &amp; help them.		We can accomplish so much. It's the little things.	Namasté
How do you shoot a person 20 times? How does anyone justify that?	That's something mass shooters do. We give too much power to police without consequences and it's disturbing.	They're trained to NOT value life. We don't need more cops like this. 	#Justice https://t.co/FnhHhR37mA

With great power comes even greater responsibility. When you misuse that power your actions must have consequences.		We must STOP giving such power without consequences. It's damning .		Shooting a person should not be the first choice, ever.	California police conduct is shameful https://t.co/tyxBGxpaef
I watched her struggle from a distance for awhile. I watched people keep their distance. She would have made it, mother's are amazing. 	Regardless of their race or religion all women are amazingly strong.	We're even stronger when we lift one another up.	It's empowering. 💙🌊💙
I was visiting a buffet when I saw a mother with a small boy trying to carry 2 plates when her child wanted carried. He was having anxiety from Asperger's.	I gladly took her plates to help her back to her table. 	I was sad that nobody else tried to help her.	Cuz she was Muslim?
@RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN This is an atrocity. There is NO excuse. This is hateful and it's authors should be fired. 	I'm deeply ashamed of the racism and hatred and lies.	I'm extremely proud of all the women and their diversity in our government. They're not going away and we will be electing more!💙

Would it surprise any of you to hear..	People with mental illness ask for help Everyday. They are in crisis.		They ask for help. They need help.		#MentalHealthMatters	Why do we say.. NO?		Don't tell yourself they don't want treatment. Many do. We tell them no, later, maybe.
@Aoife_Clif Yes. Some resist tx.	 But so many don't. We make it so difficult to obtain mental health services it's discouraging. We can't discourage them. We can't make it impossible. We need to make it possible. Right now we turn people away. We refuse to help them. They beg and beg and ask
@Aoife_Clif I disagree. The people around her saw she needed help and did nothing. Same thing for Andrea Yates. I work with people who ask for help every single day and they get denied, denied, denied. 	It truly is inexcusable.	I had a young man beg to have his meds fixed. He took his life.

You don't have to be sheep. Think for yourselves. It's liberating. We're destroying this world from within for them. We don't need to dictate the way others live to be happy ourselves. Find your own peace and quit stealing it from others.
Of you will say.. don't believe then about politics but you'll believe them about big pharma. Or don't believe them about immigration but believe them about public health. At least everyone is consistently inconsistent. The sheep routine is old. Your way isn't the only way.
We don't need to buy the bullshit. We don't need to drink the Kool-Aid. It's ok to question shyt, I highly recommend it. Don't take their word for it. Use your brains. Mostly start taking care of your own shyt and k keep your nose out of others shyt.	I'm truly shocked at how many

If we're not attacking each other for political beliefs and showing rumors and blatant lies on both sides then it's racism feed by more lies then xenophobia more lies and it's bigotry or misogyny and more lies and propoganda to attack people for vaccines. JFC wake the fuck up.

@davidmweissman @TheDweck @JenaFriedman @ChelseaClinton They're are many reasons for your non vaxxers and people should take time to understand what they are before they blindly judge them. Intolerances based on ignorance or a lack of understanding is not going to produce results.

@peterdaou I wish you would show compassion for all children @SenTedCruz black, white, brown. Where is your outrage for black girls being strip searched at school or children who went w/o food and medicine because of a shutdown? The act is old. Watch Beto O'Rourke to see what a real man is.
@7gnat If not women need to organize and go stomp some assess.
@itsteesh_ Lunch time? Where kids get a break from class, reload on carbs and sugar to survive the second half of the day and they get hyper? On all that crappy sugar filled empty of nutrition shyt they serve them? And they're looking for drugs? It's in the food and it's called SUGAR!!!
@itsteesh_ WTF!! We need a women's March.. Across the faces of the people who touched those girls now. We will ask show up, with boots on. That was a sexually violent act. Period.👊🏿👊🏾👊👊🏿👊🏾💙💙

@AngalaGoff @MrTravoli @SpeakerPelosi Jeezus cristos did you just try to thump her with your Bible? Try reading it. Calm down lady. Open your mind and heart and close thy mouth.
@SenSchumer @cleearoptics @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Senator when will you begin impeachment hearings?
@MeredithBrooks @TalbertSwan Did you speak out and shame the killers of Trayvon, Lequan, Tamir, EJ? The list is much longer and grows daily.	Righteous indignation is typically a reactive emotion of anger over mistreatment, insult, or malice of another. It is akin to what is called the sense of injustice.
@davidmweissman @TalbertSwan Just imagine if you were black and right in white racist America.
