(2/2) thing to poll is the concept of third party choice. Do people accept and move to idea of centerist ex-D running as Indy to create new choice/direction for country or does it only help re-elect Trump? I‚Äôd bet result would not be very happy news for Schultz.
No. I‚Äôm sure it was honestly taken, but timing is key. Never poll into an announcement bump. It‚Äôs just a noise meter. Poll next week after opinion settles. And candidate name/ballot polling this early is joke since everybody is unknown except Trump. (1/2) https://t.co/65kxy39cyx

Remember; average car only operates 5% of time. It‚Äôs a way off, but AV will mean a lot of people will buy a mobility service instead of car. So, fewer machines, operating 20/7. GM et el must figure out how to invest to survive in that new world, &amp; more plant capacity ain‚Äôt how.
