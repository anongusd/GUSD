@realDonaldTrump You are abusing your power as President, and it's time for you to leave office.  You are nothing but a farce, and a stain on America's reputation.  You are not the president, you are a dictator.
@realDonaldTrump we have, in all of history, never seen such a blatant disregard of the Constitution.  You are nothing more than a huge child that is whining because he's not getting his way.  You are not mentally stable enough to be POTUS...We don't need a wall!
We hope you voted!  #BlueWave2018
Change the constitution?  You can amend, but you can't change it completely.  @realDonaldTrump, you are nothing but a moron and a poor excuse for a person.  We, at the @UnderRebellion, will prevail!
We have been quiet, but it's time to discover our voice again!  We welcome the new members of the Rebellion!  Share and let's get more members for the movement!
We at the Rebellion Underground call for action against @realDonaldTrump and the Republican Party.  Stop separating children from their families! Stop putting people in cages!  Apparently you are Hitler reincarnated, @realDonaldTrump!  Because that is exactly how he acted!
So, you want to send troops down to protect our borders, @realDonaldTrump?  Why?  Seems that all of America's problems are coming from the inside, not from outside.  Maybe we should be protecting the @WhiteHouse from you!
We've seen people saying that we need to return to a Republic instead of being a Democracy. People are comparing our politics to Star Wars?  You do realize that the Republic was corrupt and became the army for Darth Vader, right?
We grow tired of the tweets that plague the Internet from the supposed POTUS.  		We believe that the POTUS needs to stop and take a step back. You don't realize that you're ruining America. You're ruining lives.  		Don't you get it, @realDonaldTrump? You've already destroyed us!
When will Congress listen?  What will it take for those in power to amend the 2nd amendment?  No one is taking guns away, we want stricter gun laws!  Yes, criminals will still get them, that's obvious.  Just make it harder to sell them, and mandatory psych evals to buyers!
Our sentiments exactly!  What are you hiding, @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/gxp1lhQUaT
RT @nowthisnews: Remember what it was like to have a president respond to a mass shooting like this? https://t.co/gIuRuvgx3E
@realDonaldTrump How about making it great by taking the parade money you intend to spend and using it, instead, to help the Veterans that need help.  The parade to show off our "prowess" is Un-American and very, for lack of a better term, snobbish.
The Rebellion Underground will take a moment to say R.I.P. to Mr. Stephen Hawking.  We send our condolences to his family, friends and fans.  		"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." - Stephen Hawking
We at the Rebellion Underground wonder....How can a person like @realDonaldTrump truly run a country?  So far, he's fired many of the staff throughout his administration...Hey, Trump!  This isn't your awful TV show!
The legal age to drink is 21.  The legal age to gamble is 21.  So, why shouldn't the legal age to buy a gun be 21?  		You should also have to get a psychological evaluation, background check and a minimum six month waiting period before buying. Simple.  		#GunControl #SafetyFirst
@realDonaldTrump We, the Rebellion Underground, do NOT approve.  #NotMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump According to our research, @BarackObama had a higher approval rating during his entire presidency than you did when you took office.		Here's a tip: Start actually doing your job and stop acting like a child every time someone says something or does something that you don't like!
How many out there want to see a change?  We at the Rebellion Underground want to see a huge change!  Not just in the upper levels of government, but in our local communities, as well!  		#BeTheChange #March14th #GunControlNow 		@realDonaldTrump Time to pay attention!!!
As another day starts here in the US, the Rebellion Underground starts a new day of research.  @realDonaldTrump Perhaps you should actually start researching things before you tweet?
On March 14th, schools across the nation will be observing a 17 minute walk out to honor the teens lost in the school shooting in Florida.  Know that the Rebellion Underground stands behind all that participate.  #Peacethroughstrength #GunControl
Gun control is not taking away guns from everyone.  It's controlling who has access.  Any weapon that can tear a huge hole in someone's body has NO PLACE in our communities.  #GunContolNow
This is to the American public.  Do not let @realDonaldTrump continue to speak like he has.  He does not speak for us.  The Rebellion Underground will continue to promote peace.
We are the Rebellion Underground.  We promote peace, not war.  Love, not violence.  If you believe in peace, retweet with the hashtag #PeaceLovePositivity
We believe in Equality for all.  No matter your outer appearance, no matter your religion, your sexual orientation, or your gender, we are one race!  #HumanRace
This is the kind of thing we, The Rebellion Underground, want to stop!  Healthcare should be free for all!  #NotMyPresident https://t.co/ka5kG7KLcv
The Rebellion Underground stands strong with #WomensHistoryMonth and equal rights for all! https://t.co/4JQvRTRsAR
Call me the Phoenix.  I have risen from the ashes and will strive for peace. Those who feel the same, join the Rebellion Underground!  Let's take back our country!
If you are on the side of peace, follow this account.  We stand for justice!
We should not have to arm teachers with weapons.  They should be able to arm our children with knowledge!
Gun control is NOT taking away guns from responsible owners.  It's the removing of military type weapons that have no place in a non-military environment.  Leave the military weapons to active military!
We are the Rebellion.  We will speak for those who have no voice.  We are the voice of peace.  We will bring order to a chaotic world.
