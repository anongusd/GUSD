Good thing in budget is they are putting $10 million more in maintenance into the budget. Of course, it's only good if we stop borrowing money for it.
County Manager talking about making "cuts." If you are raising overally spending by 4.7%, you are not really cutting so much as choosing to spend more elsewhere.
County Manager's slide presentation also compares tax rates not average out-of-pocket tax bills. Rates are not relevant without being applied to average property values.
Average homeowner would see a $277 tax bill increase for 2019. That is retroactive to January 1st despite the Fiscal Year running July 1 to June 30. Part of the reason there is always a year-end slush fund available.

Two "needs" that the County Manager cited in the report for the slush fund was a noise study (yes airports make noise) and a consultant to study parking permits.
I hope @voteforvihstadt at least comes out against the $2 million slush fund. If the manager needs more money in a down year, he should come back to the County Board for approval.
Try some common sense. You know next year is harder. But instead the manager is recommending a $2 million slush fund for himself and only talking about setting aside half of the total surplus aside for next year.

@JNagurka . . . would be surprised if this is a vote-moving issue for many people. could be wrong I guess.
@JNagurka final point before the thoroughly beaten dead horse . . .
@JNagurka my original point was having more direct representation by creating districts is not inherently partisan.
@JNagurka I have NO idea whose idea it was originally. All I know is the firefighters funded the petition drive.
@JNagurka petition drive started in early 2010, much closer to 2006 than to 2015 . . .
@JNagurka anyway, that's your opinion, just as it's mine that Gov. McAuliffe supports independent commission to pick up seats for Ds.
@JNagurka The GOP ended up supporting it as well.
@JNagurka You know the Arlington firefighters ended up initiating the petition drive on districts, not the Arlington Republicans, right?
@JNagurka Rockingham County, pop 77K has 5 districts . . .
@JNagurka and at-large representation in Loudon would make it better?
@JNagurka Loudon has 360K, 8 districts plus one at-large
@JNagurka I think the proposal that didn't make the ballot was 4 districts and one at-large.
@JNagurka if you like at-large representation, why not just have at-large Congressional districts too?
@JNagurka I get what you're saying, I'm not sure you get what I'm saying. districts would give each person more direct representation.
@JNagurka @LiUNA_CIO @mike_berecz I'm not sure creating districts to ensure more direct representation is partisan, but ok.
@JNagurka @LiUNA_CIO @mike_berecz effort to get that on the ballot a few years ago fell short.
@JNagurka @LiUNA_CIO @mike_berecz That's a different question really as in whether Arlington should change its current form of gov't.
@LiUNA_CIO I want to know if they support narrowing major thoroughfares to cause more unnecessary traffic backups.
@LiUNA_CIO I get it, but they will never get to vote on it unless they run for the General Assembly.
@LiUNA_CIO @mike_berecz Arlington County Board does not draw district lines. All elected county wide.
@mike_berecz do you think a commission made up of political appointees will not make political decisions?

duh-duh-dnnnn MT @Redistrict New plot twist? Source tells me there may be up to 500 uncounted votes in Bedford County (74.96% Obenshain)
@notlarrysabato if so, all GOP Members of Congress represent more, right?
@notlarrysabato only about 304K voters eligible in last mayoral race http://t.co/JM3TwR7Zd9
@notlarrysabato I thought VA Beach's population was around 450,000?
@notlarrysabato I will have to apologize to John for forgetting him.
@notlarrysabato Wolf
@JetSetterRyan Here's a quick explanation. http://t.co/BuvCe7qpfM
@JetSetterRyan consensus is there are 2-3K uncounted AB votes in 8thCD section of Fairfax.
Barring big change elsewhere in VA, odds are Herring will take lead later today. Could be under 150, could be over 750.
I had almost turned off this Oregon - Stanford game.
Just when you thought the AG race couldn't get more interesting, it did.
@Redistrict in most precincts, total votes cast in any race is less than in person votes. How can we say what AB return rates are?
@Redistrict right, but it's virtually impossible to know how many ABs we're returned and counted from this spreadsheet?
@Redistrict just to clarify, the county did or didn't report applications by CD? That's what it sounded like in your tweets.
@Redistrict is this available on the Fairfax website?
@Redistrict did you compare to votes by magisterial district?
@kerpen same with Alexandria. ~16,000 AB in 2012. 3536 this year.
@kerpen Arlington ABs down about 75% versus 2012. Also in 8th.

@kerpen I feel a lot better with the margin &gt; 500
AP has race at 153 vote margin - with a mess in Newport News?
AG race could be down to less than 1/10th vote per precinct.
@museisluse SBE made adjustments for days after Election Day last year. I trust county elections pages. Margin likely under 2,000.
Looks like AG race down to a difference of less than 1/2 vote per precinct.
@kerpen SBE and Fairfax County's elections page don't match up. Herring +5,000 margin not on SBE.
@lockhartgmu both
7 precincts left to report in VA.
Wow, Arlington ABs went to Herring by 4,500 votes - out of 7,200 total cast. Yikes.
AG race down to under 8,000 votes, but practically nothing left outstanding.
McAuliffe could lose Senate tie (if Rs win both specials) &amp; face veto proof majority in House. I'd say Obamacare will not be expanded in VA.

@jmaleski Interesting thing about Ds winning LG race, Rs could win that Senate seat in a special &amp; break 20-20 tie.
Fox calling VA for T-Mac. Blech.
Still can't believe Dems are sending out talking heads saying the policies people are losing were bad. Simply not true.
Hopefully, if nothing else, this ensures Mark Warner picks up a top tier opponent.
Based on precincts still out, this thing still slightly tilts T-Mac. But only slightly.
Obenshain consistently running 5% ahead of KC. Likely to hold on barring something surprising.
Latest update from SBE. 15,000 vote margin.
@JimDolbow T-Mac won big, but still under 71%. Better than Obama last year. Worse than Kaine in 2005.
Arlington and Alexandria are mostly in. Unless there is a bomb in the ABs, % unlikely to move much. Could have been worse here.
@Redistrict T-Mac is at 70.7% in Arlington right now.
Pollsters busy tossing memos praising their accuracy &amp; replacing them with margin of error explanations?
This is getting very interesting. #VAGov
@SatirclAlx ABs reported county wide. Seems Gunston still on pace for around 700. If similar county wide, turnout will be about same as 2009
@SatirclAlx in Gunston. roughly 1500 turnout in 2012. At 12:30 this year, about 350.
@SatirclAlx I didn't compare to 2009, I said "last year".
@jouteni on statewide election - closer to 35% then 25%.
@amoylan Thanks. I may outpace Mickey Mouse this year.
Deeds only won Arlington by 17,000 votes in 2009.
Raw vote margin is more important percentage in Arlington. Obama won by 47,000 votes in 2012. About 1/3 statewide total.
Gunston precinct in Arlington on pace to be less than 1/2 last year's turnout as of 1pm. Seems in line with predictions.

RT @baseballcrank: Yet again, government's settled science unsettles itself http://t.co/sUvenhoUm8
Schedulers all over House offices yelling louder at TVs with each procedural vote, followed by heads banging on desks.
Now I remember why I refuse to listen to the "debate" on the House floor most days.
Ds opposing food stamp work requirements (which can be fulfilled w/community service) for able-bodied adults without dependents.
Maybe Rs should take opposite tact. Dems standing up for felons and lottery winners receiving food stamps.
@kerpen most likely. Gwen Moore up now explaining it to us.
Add Jackson-Lee to list of Members of Congress who doesn't understand how nutrition program funding works.
Or "THEIR FOOD STAMPS" #typo
Again, Farm Bill expired last September 30th, not extended till Fiscal Cliff deal. NO ONE LOST FOOD THEIR STAMPS.
DeLauro also doesn't know nutrition programs will continue with or without re-authorization.
Nancy Pelosi apparently has no idea that food stamps will continue regardless of whether re-authorized.
Reid also complaining about GOP holding up Obama nominations like he never held up Bush nominations.
As House votes, switching to Senate . . . Reid on floor complaining about GOP obstruction when he regularly refuses to allow GOP amendments.
@amoylan again, not approving the process, just saying it was not a secret to Hoyer or Peterson.
@amoylan not saying we should bring bills forward this way, but it was not a secret.
@amoylan that EVERYONE on the Hill knew would be in there.
. . . apparently, he doesn't read any news outlets that cover Capitol Hill.
Hoyer on the floor complaining that they did not know this bill would be brought up . . .
The way the law works, food stamps continue whether or not a new authorization bill passes.
Have no deep personal feelings one way or another on splitting farm bill/food stamps, but ... (1 of 2)
RT @ChadPergram: WH threatens veto of revamped farm bill sans food stamps.
RT @waysandmeansgop: Chairman Camp: Senate immigration bill a revenue bill; unconstitutional and cannot be taken up by the House.
@armbar_city odd that Obama seems to be leading the party of Wall Street over Main Street.
In fact, Dems showed ZERO interest in Republican amendments when Obamacare was passed.
How about, we told you this law was terrible 3 years ago and it took you this long to realize the same thing?
Favorite spin emerging from Obamacare delays: Unnecessary if GOP would help White House improve the law.
To clarify - two schools of GOP thought on Obamacare.
2) We should not let Obamacare funding &amp; programs start because it's impossible to end a federal program no matter how ill-conceived.
1) Obamacare will collapse under its own weight, so we should just let the whole thing move forward and blow up. (cont...)
Two schools of thought in DC right now on Obamacare (cont...)
@fuskiegirl21 yes, but there are structural reasons why college costs are far outpacing inflation.
I can't wait for the spin from the left if the Admin announces the exchanges will be delayed. http://t.co/DxR2BfB6Dh
The student loan interest rate has little to do with college being prohibitively expensive, but you wouldn't know it in DC right now.
I guess this the answer I was looking for. Individual mandate is unenforceable so Feds essentially won't enforce it. http://t.co/xkl6qalMTQ
I would like a Treasury official to explain to me how they plan to enforce the individual mandate w/o employer/insurer mandate?

Best part about working July 5th - I was in a much better mood arriving at work after there was no morning commute traffic snarl.
Where did all the Obamacare defenders go who ridiculed Romney for saying he could just waive the law?
Good thing those Republican governors went along with the plan, right?
We may be left with Medicaid expansion only in 2014. (cont.)
It seems inconceivable that those major provisions can really be enforced either. (cont.)
Those are key pieces to individual mandate and exchanges. (cont.)
For those who don't live &amp; breathe public policy in DC, Treasury decision not only stops employer mandate, but insurance reporting. (cont.)
One of Dems standard talkers on Obamacare repeal is "it's happening, so this is a waste of time." Whoops.
