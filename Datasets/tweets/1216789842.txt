15. Threaten mass deportations, registries of religious minorities, and the banning of refugees	16. Attribute acts of domestic violence to "enemies within," and use such events as excuses to beef up internal security and limit civil liberties
13. Repeatedly tell big lies, causing the public to doubt the truth and to believe fictions that support the tyrants' goals	14. Blame economic stresses on immigrants or racial or religious minorities, and foment public bias and hatred against them
11. Repeatedly claim massive voter fraud in the absence of any evidence in order to restrict voting in subsequent elections	12. Turn the public against journalists or media outlets that criticize the regime, calling them "deceitful" and "scum."
8. Stoke tensions abroad, even the specter of nuclear war, to distract from the tyrant's efforts to consolidate power at home	9. Circumvent the independent press and communicate directly with followers	10. Vilify legislators and judges who are critical of the regime
4. Spread conspiracy theories about "deep state" forces seeking to oust the tyrant.	5. Refer to top-ranking military leaders as "my" generals	6. Threaten to jail political opponents	7. Claim to have won an election by a landslide even after losing the popular vote
