U.S. official details that what Kim Jong Un wanted was to lift ALL economic sanctions imposed by the UN since March 2016 but not sanctions specifically targeted at WMD production.  So, basically, all of the sanctions that have been putting the squeeze on him.

Props to @DavidNakamura of @washingtonpost   I believe he is the first American journalist to ask - and have answered - a question to Kim Jong Un

@IsabeauMann @realDonaldTrump @dougmillsnyt I didn‚Äôt have to move hotels. You missed the entire point of what happened.
At his dinner with Kim Jong Un tonight, @realDonaldTrump gave a shout out to @dougmillsnyt , calling him ‚Äòone of the great photographers of the world‚Äô. Amen to that!  Doug is a master.
Officials say the U.S. has absolutely not moved off it‚Äôs position that Kim must agree to ‚Äòfinal, fully verifiable denuclearization‚Äô. Former North Korea negotiator Joseph DeTrani told me today he would not be surprised if Kim agrees to a definition of ‚Äúdenuclearization‚Äù this week
As @realDonaldTrump prepares to meet Kim Jong Un tonight, two U.S. officials strongly dispute the idea that Special Envoy Stephen Beigun was ‚Äòwilling to offer too much‚Äô in negotiations leading up to the summit. They also insist denuclearization has not become a negotiating point.
We can debate whether she was talking generally about what we do on a daily basis at home - which is how I saw it. But at the very least, I see covering the news as a duty - certainly not a privilege. If we treat it as a privilege, we give power to those who would control us. https://t.co/cNfxG8S1VI

@CaleneGrice67 @WhiteHouse It actually is a right, not a privilege.  It's called the First Amendment.  No less a right than the 2nd Amendment.
@maggieNYT Unclear.  There may have been no fight to have. But a colossal miscue. Apparently everyone - except Kim knew we were there.
For example, in Buenos Aires, we were in the same hotel as French President @EmanuelMacaron and there was zero problem.  Kim comes to Hanoi and we get evicted from space we had bought and paid for just because he is in the same hotel.
In nearly 10 years covering the @WhiteHouse, having been on Presidential trips to more than 100 countries, I have never seen the White House Press Corps kicked out of our unilateral press/broadcast center by request of a foreign leader.

@AlexLittleTN @AOC "Holy cow" was a joke......

@AlexLittleTN @AOC Actually...let me pull back ‚Äòidiotic‚Äô and replace it with utterly uninformed.
@AlexLittleTN @AOC That is simply an idiotic statement. We covered the infamous tape at length.

The latest version of FAQ's on her blog has removed the "f" word in favor of "emissions from cows"		Holy cow
The FAQ's released by @AOC 's office regarding the "Green New Deal" include the following passage: "We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast"

@CRobertBuchanan @cahtx01 True that overall numbers have declined. However, record numbers of ‚Äúfamily units‚Äù and UAC‚Äôs are crossing the border
The Border Patrol has acknowledged that the TX barrier is aimed primarily at drug/human trafficking and other criminals. That is why POTUS issued the directive about asylum claims only at Ports Of Entry - and the deal for migrants to wait out asylum claims in Mexico https://t.co/oLYc8h0Zuq
...whose goal is to be apprehended by the Border Patrol. Migrants could still get feet on U.S. soil, which would put them into the asylum/detention/removal system. Record #'s of family units and unaccompanied children are crossing the border, with the intent of being caught
... from the riverbank. Between the river and the barrier is a lot of land - which is U.S. soil. While a new barrier may disrupt drug and human trafficking and people who don't want to get caught, it would do little to stop thousands of Central American migrants.....
Here's something neither side in the "wall" debate is talking about. The $5.7 bil would build about 170 miles of barrier in Texas. In most places, the barrier can't be built in the flood plain of the Rio Grande. Much of the existing barrier is built hundreds of yards......

@nixmastro @realDonaldTrump 62,628 illegal immigrants have been apprehended in the Rio Grande Sector since Oct 1 2018
Another favorite spot for migrants to cross was right under the international border bridge just west of Hidalgo (south of McAllen). There is fence on the bridge, but not under. There is also a lot of private riverfront property in the area that frequently sees illegal crossings.
2/2..Illegal immigrants dropped at the dock would try to disappear into the park. Many were picked up by Border Patrol, but some made it through. Most of the immigrants were Mexican and could be directly removed. But it was also a hotspot for Central American migrants to cross
In 2014, I was about 200 yards upriver from where @realDonaldTrump was. All day, every day, people on jet skis were smuggling people across the Rio Grande.  They would take them from a park on the Mexican side to a dock at Anzalduas Park on the US side.  1/2
@AngelaPellerano @realDonaldTrump Angela - I spent several weeks in the Rio Grande Valley Sector during the migrant crisis of 2014.  Every official I spoke with - (CBP, Texas) and private landowners told me a physical barrier can't work there - except in small sections near border crossings - as in Hidalgo
@lhougland53 @realDonaldTrump It's not a matter of engineering.  You can easily build a wall there - if you had a notion to wall off the entire state of Texas from the Rio Grande.  Private landowners - and the state (parks) might have some concerns about that.
@thomasOakes16 @realDonaldTrump It's not a matter of engineering.  You can easily build a wall there - if you had a notion to wall off the entire state of Texas from the Rio Grande.  Private landowners - and the state (parks) might have some concerns about that.
An important fact to keep in mind in the debate over a border wall.  While @realDonaldTrump spoke about how a wall could help CBP in the Rio Grande Valley sector control illegal cross-border traffic, along most of the 1,260 miles of Rio Grande border, a wall is unfeasible.

According to Lanny Davis' statement, it appears @MichaelCohen212 will spend the next three months before heading to jail telling Robert Mueller everything he possibly can about @realDonaldTrump in hopes Mueller can get him a reduced sentence.

WH Chief of staff John Kelly will leave by the end of the year, @realDonaldTrump says.
POTUS weighs in on Cohen Sentencing memos https://t.co/dlrtlVNx5X
And there's this:  "Cohen argues that the emotional toll of his convictions on him and his family, the loss of his law license and other business, and civil tax penalties, ‚Äúamount to an alternative form of punishment,‚Äù which warrants a sentence of time served.  They do not."
OSC mocks @MichaelCohen212  "Now he seeks extraordinary leniency ‚Äì a sentence of no jail time ‚Äì based principally on his rose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes" and says his claim to be a "co-operating witness" is unfounded.
.@MichaelCohen212 is likely going to jail for a while:  "Office respectfully requests that this Court impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable Guidelines range"(guidelines are 51 to 63 months)
Washington abuzz with rumors that WH COS Kelly is on the way out.  But he is attending a Christmas dinner reception with @realDonaldTrump and other senior staff tonight.

@xXcollinwaterXx @craigdeighan @cultofpolitics @JeanShots @KeithLeBlanc63 @FoxNews @SecretService I‚Äôm an American. And I have lived here since 1989.
@FixSheltersNow @ccowley57 @JpcToronto @TFerrandino @FoxNews Yes. The backup plan involved shutting down main roads for hours.  They could have done it. I assume the WH thought that wouldn‚Äôt have been such a good idea.
@morningj @LizWFB @MarkSteynOnline @SecretService Not in the way the @SecretService demands. Other leaders have relatively light security.
@ccowley57 @JpcToronto @FixSheltersNow @TFerrandino @FoxNews The President neither requests, nor encourages weather calls. Any President generally takes the advice of the people who are charged with protecting him.
@MoscovaRoger13 @TFerrandino @ccowley57 @FoxNews @BarackObama Yes. I would.
@anauburntiger @TFerrandino @ccowley57 @FoxNews @POTUS This is true. @SecretService has the final say. The Marines make a recommendation to USSS.
@JpcToronto @FixSheltersNow @TFerrandino @ccowley57 @FoxNews Stop what nonsense? Informing people of how things actually work?  I thought that was my job description.
@christopherp60 @SecretService Yes, they would have driven him out there. But they would have required massive road closures. You seem to be missing something here.
@saints618 @KennedyB420 Yes. The weather call came from the Marines. They are the ones who make a weather call, not the White House
@phillyfaulhaber @LizWFB @MarkSteynOnline @SecretService More information coming your way - Trudeau wasn‚Äôt there. And the don‚Äôt shut down roads for Kelly - or Dunford
@MarcOfApproval @AprilDRyan @FoxNews Yes, they have a plan.  It involves shutting down traffic for hours
@LizWFB @MarkSteynOnline The @SecretService does what it believes is necessary to protect the President of the United States. As there have not been any serious incidents regarding a President in nearly 4 decades, I‚Äôd say they are getting it right.
@BMbsf @AprilDRyan @FoxNews I‚Äôm sure President Trump could fly into Bagram on the QT. Perhaps he will some day..  when he does, I hope to be the TV pool reporter
@FixSheltersNow @TFerrandino @ccowley57 @FoxNews It flew in the cargo hold of a C-17 from Joint Base Andrews
@cultofpolitics @JeanShots @KeithLeBlanc63 @FoxNews @SecretService Yes. He could have shut down traffic in Paris and out into the countryside for hours.
@Mainegirl123 @julieschultzsnp @FoxNews I can‚Äôt run for President. I was not born an American citizen.
@christopherp60 @SecretService There are some things in which the @SecretService has absolute authority. Such as the day agents burst into Dick Cheney‚Äôs office...picked him up under the arms and literally carted him off to the elevator to the PEOC.   They have great power over motorcades as well
@glamelegance @FoxNews I suggest then, you contact either the Pentagon or the White House Military Office and they can tell you directly.
@spaznak @AprilDRyan @FoxNews As I said in a separate tweet, Macron and Merkel did not go to Aisne-Marne. Kelly and Dunford went in a small motorcade (2-3 vehicles) that did not require road closures
@JeanShots @KeithLeBlanc63 @FoxNews @SecretService Jean....I have simply told you what the military said, and what the Secret Service would require. If you need your own confirmation, you can easily call them.
@mlwelch31 God bless him for his service to our great nation, and to the defense of our allies
@KennedyB420 Trump was never scheduled to go to the Forest of Compiegne
@Bespoken2018 If you have solid information that the Marines thought the weather was fine, but the White House over-ruled them, I will be happy to put that on the air
@bksrmyaddiction I am not defending anyone.  I am merely providing information
One more piece of information - Macron and Merkel did not go to Aisne-Marne - as many Tweeps seem to think. They went to the Forest of Compiegne - where the armistice was signed in 1918.
@TFerrandino @ccowley57 @FoxNews You may not think it‚Äôs right, but the Marines didn‚Äôt think it was right to potentially risk the life of the US President by flying in low ceilings.
For informational purposes - The Marines often make a ‚Äúweather call‚Äù in Washington DC, that forces the President (whomever that might be) to motorcade to Andrews. But the @SecretService does not like long motorcade rides into the countryside - no matter where they are.
@ccowley57 @FoxNews The Marines made a weather call, not the White House
@ccowley57 @FoxNews They were not at Belleau.  They were just north of Paris.  Belleau is 55 miles away on the road to Reims.
@KeithLeBlanc63 @FoxNews No, they would not.  Security for an American President (as prescribed by the @SecretService ) is unique.
An Administration official tells @FoxNews the reason there was no motorcade backup option for Aisne-Marne cemetery after the Marine One weather call is that it would have shut down traffic from Paris all the way to Belleau for hours.

Side note to all of this:  @Sen_JoeManchin informed the @WhiteHouse of his intent to vote for Kavanaugh before @JeffFlake and @SenatorCollins made their intentions known.  It didn't make him the "deciding" vote, but he wasn't riding Collins' coattails, either
@johnondrasik @realDonaldTrump Just like Governor Justice
I wouldn't be surprised if @realDonaldTrump doesn't make any more campaign appearances in West Virginia.
With @Sen_JoeManchin now a "yes", Kavanaugh confirmation vote count is 50-49.  Will @lisamurkowski reconsider her position from earlier today? @SenatorCollins believes Kavanaugh IS the right person for the job
Unless something happens between now and tomorrow afternoon, Kavanaugh will be conformed on at least a 50-50 tiebreak
Also, if @SenatorCollins says she‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes‚Äù on Kavanaugh, it doesn‚Äôt leave @Sen_JoeManchin in the position of being the ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù vote. He simply becomes a buffer.
If @SenatorCollins says she will vote for Kavanaugh, @realDonaldTrump gets his nominee.  All that would be left to decide is whether @SteveDaines has to race back from his daughter‚Äôs wedding. That‚Äôs up to @Sen_JoeManchin
If @SenatorCollins announces she‚Äôs voting against Kavanaugh, it would be a huge pivot from the case she‚Äôs laying out.

@mickroberts74 @Sen_JoeManchin @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @SteveDaines Pence only there to break 50-50 ties.  50-49 is not a tie. 	If the Patriots ended the 4th quarter of the Superbowl leading the Eagles 50-49, would they go into overtime?
Sources familiar with Senate lobbying efforts tell me the WH believes @Sen_JoeManchin will vote to confirm Kavanaugh, but that @lisamurkowski will vote no.  WH thinks @SenatorCollins and @JeffFlake are alson  onboard. With @SteveDaines in Montana, that nets a 50-49 vote.
The @WhiteHouse believes the vote for Kavanaugh tomorrow will mirror the cloture vote today - which means Sen. Daines may be able to dance with his daughter tomorrow night
WV Senator @Sen_JoeManchin votes in favor of cloture.  An indication of how he may vote tomorrow?
@jw__222 @MrRiotDiet My point exactly

Sources tell @FoxNews that @realDonaldTrump attorneys are "pleased with the progress being made" in talks with Mueller about an interview with POTUS. The last proposal was for written Q&amp;A limited to Russia/collusion. Source tells Fox "I think the plane lands"
Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation team put him through a "murder board" yesterday in preparation for Monday's scheduled hearing.  Sources say he did well "He was solid - there was no wavering" @FoxNews
@wgrzMichael @trufaxrbtr I imagine POTUS could ask the FBI to get whatever greater level of detail they can about the incident.  But the upshot of the FBI's Hill investigation is that it got her in front of the committee.  Ford has already been offered to appear in whatever form makes her comfortable.
@LisaBritton @FoxNews It is not the FBI's job to "clear the air".  That job falls to the Senate Judiciary Committee to do that. The FBI simply develops the information and passes it to the relevant parties.
@wgrzMichael @trufaxrbtr One of the big differences between this case and Anita Hill is that Hill's allegations had not gone public - so the FBI was investigating something that was still private.  We learned about this alleged incident - and the details after it was leaked to the media.
@gonow1040 @ceyockey @joshdcaplan @FoxNews In Maryland, there is no statute of limitations for felony sexual offenses. For misdemeanor offenses, the statute is 1 year.  I don't know enough about the law to know which category Ford's allegations fall into.
@wgrzMichael @kml423 It is interesting to note here that the Judiciary Committee "immediately informed the White House" of the allegations and that they did not become public until after the FBI check had been completed.
@wgrzMichael read the history of the Anita Hill case.  She was briefly questioned by 2 agents, and there were long and loud complaints that the FBI 'did not fully investigate' her claims.  I don't think that is a model on which to base any further inquiry into Kavanaugh
@wgrzMichael I did ask why - and here is the reason.  This information has already come to light, so there is no reason for the FBI to go back and discover what is already known.  There is no Federal crime alleged.  And the statute of limitations on any local crime has long run out.
Federal law enforcement source tells @FoxNews there is nothing for the FBI to investigate regarding Kavanaugh and that ‚Äúthis is a political issue - not a law enforcement one‚Äù

@habfan1959 @WhiteHouse 1 in 15 Canadians owns a firearm.  That's about 2 million people.  Yet gun violence in Canada is negligible.  Same thing in Switzerland.  There must be a reason for that.
@MN_poppy @AMcCorm77526975 @WhiteHouse @davidhogg111 @AMarch4OurLives @FoxNews I very much shorthanded what he was yelling at the White House...
@habfan1959 @WhiteHouse You miss the point.  Shotguns are readily available in Canada, yet there have only been 7 school shootings in Canada's history.  Which leads me to believe something else is at work.
@eelarson @yeschrisyes @WhiteHouse That‚Äôs an idea that may have applied in this case. But that‚Äôs not what people are loudly calling for.
@AMcCorm77526975 @WhiteHouse @davidhogg111 @AMarch4OurLives @FoxNews First of all, I was t knocking him. Just pointing our t that the usual arguments don‚Äôt appear to apply here. And he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúurging government leaders to take action‚Äù.
@habfan1959 @WhiteHouse As I recall, it's pretty easy to buy a shotgun in Canada.....and Canada has some of the toughest gun laws anywhere.
@AMcCorm77526975 @WhiteHouse @davidhogg111 @AMarch4OurLives @FoxNews There is likely PLENTY that can be done.  Who said "go away and forget about it"?  My point is simply that the circumstances surrounding this shooting require a different paradigm of thinking.  One that likely begins with parental involvement
@glennyork @WhiteHouse Precisely
@SoulOnJourney11 @WhiteHouse And pipes.  Don't forget pipes.
@yeschrisyes @WhiteHouse How simplistic.  What about doing whatever is possible to make sure parents are on top of what their kids are doing - and if you do own shotguns and revolvers, making sure they are responsibly locked up.  And then there's the mental health/social media aspect of this
@larkin1235 @WhiteHouse That will NEVER happen.  Not now, not in a million years.
@JHead1984 @WhiteHouse Illuminate one proposed gun control measure that could have prevented THIS event....	-ban assault-style weapons 	-raise age to purchase a rifle 	-close gun show loophole	-longer waiting period	-ban bump stocks 	The problem is - this type of shooting requires a different paradigm
@thedailyveteran @WhiteHouse Unknown on both counts

Rudy Giuliani on the Mueller probe:  "The case is essentially over.  They're just in denial."
Rudy Giuliani tells @FoxNews that Robert Mueller told @realDonaldTrump legal team two weeks ago that he will abide by DOJ guidelines that a President cannot be indicted.  Giuliani said Mueller has no choice but to honor a 1999 Clinton-era memo
@pachapman1776 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yes.  I realize that you don't care.  However, the Office of Government Ethics and the DOJ do care.  That makes it news. Even if you don't care.
Source tells @FoxNews that Rudy Giuliani revealed the reimbursement to Cohen because he was aware it would be reported in the financial disclosure.  Getting out ahead of it meant that Giuliani would take the hit - not @realDonaldTrump
One potential problem for @realDonaldTrump - in letter to DepA-G Rosenstein, @OfficeGovEthics says the payment by Cohen should have been included as a "reportable liability" - which means POTUS should have disclosed it last year.  This may buttress @CREWcrew lawsuit with DOJ
.@realDonaldTrump including payments to Cohen on financial disclosure puts it the category of a personal "reportable liability" - which may give more ammunition to claims it could not have been a "campaign contribution".  Disclosure form was also approved by @OfficeGovEthics
We may have discovered why Rudy Giuliani disclosed the "reimbursement" to Michael Cohen.  It is detailed on page 45 of @realDonaldTrump financial disclosure:  https://t.co/fZLdN4yaam  They knew it would come out, so they tried to get ahead of it.

Some of the more pithy quotes from @FoxNews interview with Rudy Giuliani https://t.co/wiLao9ETPE
Rudy Giuliani tells @FoxNews acceptable parameters for a @realDonaldTrump interview:  "2 hours"  "Questions in advance" "relevant topics - meaning Russia - which may not be relevant any longer" and "the Comey firing".  "The rest is tangential"
Rudy Giuliani tells @FoxNews if Mueller keeps an open mind, an interview of @realDonaldTrump is "something we'd consider.  If they don't, then given all the irregularities of this investigation, we would be foolish to have him be interviewed."
.@RudyGiuliani on a possible @realDonaldTrump interview with Mueller: "My position isn't determined yet. Are they objective about the President's interview? Do they have an open mind to the fact he could be telling the truth and @Comey may be lying?"
.@RudyGiuliani On the Mueller questions "The questions almost cry out that they don't have a case.  They're desperate.  And they want to make a case.  Look how few questions, if any, are about Russia.  Wasn't this investigation about Russian collusion?"
.@RudyGiuliani tells @FoxNews an interview with Mueller is weeks away "if that's the direction we're going to go.  Or, if we're going to go in the direction of a subpoena battle, we're ready for that."
.@RudyGiuliani tells @FoxNews he fears a perjury trap in the Mueller questions.  Says with NoKo summit looming, an interview with Mueller wouldn't happen until "into the beginning of the summer". "We can't effectively prepare him over the next two to three weeks."

@waltshaub @BretBaier @FBI @realDonaldTrump Correct, I did not mean it in the strict legal sense of the word.  I clumsily short termed "reasonable expectation of privacy" - which I think all Presidents have in their communications with staff.  Thanks for your thoughtful responses.

James Comey told @BretBaier he didn't "leak".  Yet the contents of a private and privileged conversation between the @FBI director and @realDonaldTrump ended up in the hands of the media.  Many people would consider that to be the very definition of a leak.

Sources telling @FoxNews that the departure of VA SEC is on a hot boil again - could happen today - maybe next week.
With John Dowd‚Äôs departure, @realDonaldTrump loses a fierce legal mind who was unswervingly loyal to his client.
After the HR McMaster hoodwink, we need to keep a close eye for a possible Shulkin departure.
We were assured last week by several top @WhiteHouse officials that McMaster wasn‚Äôt leaving.  Which can only lead us to conclude one of two things - those officials were out of the loop - or they were not being truthful.
Looking at the incessant "BREAKING NEWS" banners on the competition this afternoon and thinking - If EVERYTHING is breaking news, then breaking news means nothing.
Based on the number of telemarketers that call my cellphone, the government's "DO NOT CALL" list appears to not be particularly effective.
Administration official tells @FoxNews that @realDonaldTrump will announce "protective" tariffs against China amounting to $30 billion or more - as well as "investment retrictions" to prevent China from capturing the technology businesses of the future.
@Dannychauncey @WhiteHouse @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT I wonder if she plays guitar??
Senior @WhiteHouse official tells @FoxNews that while NSC's Putin call briefing memo said "DO NOT CONGRATULATE", @realDonaldTrump likely didn't see the memo as his pre-call briefing was by phone - not in person - and 'do not congratulate' was not mentioned in the phone briefing.

Part 2  .......from his or her parent or guardian granting the applicant permission to apply for a FID. A FID will not issue to a minor until he or she reaches 15 years of age. This exception allows persons 15 years of age and older to possess rifles and shotguns.
For all the trolls out there, here's the MA law:  Under certain circumstances, however, minors may possess weapons. Persons ‚Äúmore than 14 but less than 18 years of age‚Äù may apply for a Firearm Identification Card (‚ÄúFID‚Äù) if the applicant submits a certificate..........
@Buppy9999 Yeah.  Find the video.  Then you can apologize to me.
@SiochanaPMC @katshere68 @maggieNYT @BetsyDeVosED I didn't say that.  Again, listening helps.  I SPECIFICALLY said (replay the tape) that in MA, a 15 year old "can POSSESS a RIFLE with parental consent".  Look it up and tell me who's the d-bag.  Me or you.

There has never been a tradition of military parades on the 4th of July. The revolution has always been celebrated in a non-military way.
@Hesiod2k11 @davidscall You should send your thoughts to @realDonaldTrump .  He's the one who wants to have a parade.  Not me.

@TVietor08 @HillaryClinton We'll have to agree to disagree. As long as HRC operates as a "shadow President", what she says carries relevance and weight.
@TVietor08 @HillaryClinton And what epithet would you use to describe HRC weighing in on it?Don't engage in disingenuous claptrap. You know we cover all the big issues
@TVietor08 @HillaryClinton 2/2 used to interview Sen BO...  But - @HillaryClinton has not yet left the stage-therefore what she says remains relevant to the discourse

The Force is with me, I am one with the Force https://t.co/7JhmElqqFD
Two questions:  Did Comey "memorialize" his "matter/investigation" conversation with AG Lynch - and why did it take so long to come out?
"Covfefe": colloquial Montenegrin word for "excuse me - you're standing in my spot" https://t.co/Qr6b5p1jbC
Even Comey wouldn't go this far in his testimony https://t.co/AVkEZd4CJ3
Comey acknowledges that he went along with Lynch's request - even though it made him "queasy"
Comey just tossed Loretta Lynch under the bus-saying she wanted to align FBI language of @HillaryClinton investigation with that of campaign
Comey - asked whether closing out Flynn investigation would affect overal Russia investigation..."No" the two were touching, but separate
James Comey just outed his own "deep throat"
The hazards of tweeting:@realDonaldTrump threatens Comey with "tapes"...Comey releases a memo about meeting....Mueller appointed Sp. Counsel
James Comey just drew a straight line between a @realDonaldTrump tweet and the appointment of a Special Prosecutor.
Comey on anonymous sources: "Those who are talking don't know and those who know aren't talking"
Point made by @marcorubio "The only thing that‚Äôs never been leaked is the fact that @realDonaldTrump was not personally under investigation"
James Comey just drew a very small circle of where leaks about his interactions with @realDonaldTrump may have come from
Comey on coversations with @realDonaldTrump "I‚Äôve seen the tweet about tapes‚Ä¶Lordy, I hope there are tapes‚Ä¶"
Comey says he took notes because he was concerned @realDonaldTrump might "lie" about the content of one-one meetings
James Comey reveals that Loretta Lynch told him to call the @HillaryClinton email investigation a "matter" and not "an investigation"

I have always been curious to know how much @POTUS ground stops cost in lost productivity, business, etc, but it's impossible to calculate.
@3DOTNEWS @POTUS @HillaryClinton He could have flown into NAS JAX
Total ground stop at JAX for @POTUS to campaign for @HillaryClinton = 45 minutes. Many people will miss connections.
All air traffic at JAX suspended for 30 minutes because @POTUS was landing to campaign for @HillaryClinton
The height of irony - now we're getting to the point we may miss our @AmericanAir connection in Charlotte

Talking to home builders, @realDonaldTrump says had he known his eventual path, "I would have talked to Howard (Stern) a little bit less"
@AY4WEB And did you buy a hat from one of the OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED vendors?
@AY4WEB Perhaps you need to get out of the house and actually attend a Trump event.

@MaryEll36176646 It worked brilliantly. But now it's a different time. Keep moving ahead, not backwards
@MaryEll36176646  Respectfully, you heard his side. 3 months ago. Bringing it up again now merely takes him off message.
@bcb044 @FoxNews He didn't clear it up. He merely turned the wheel.
@MaryEll36176646 The only people he should be fighting with are: HRC, BO. Not Cruz.
@Softcrush @MaryEll36176646 He is now the Republican nominee. Zany needs to be kept to a minimum. Berlusconi was zany.
@MaryEll36176646 there's a rule in politics: Never punch down. Hitting Cruz at this point is 'punching down'.
@MaryEll36176646 I completely disagree.  He's the nominee. No need to relitigate the primaries. Message discipline is key. Cruz not relevant
@jayd1963 Yes.  you completely misunderstood
@jayd1963 Uh....it was a complimentary observation.
.@realDonaldTrump has now managed to marry the energy of his ad-lib speeches with the disciplined language of a TelePrompTer address

New Q-poll shows 42-40 dead heat between @HillaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump
@WilsonFrontier I'll just close by saying that I am constantly telling my 5yr old twins that paper, cardboard, bottles and cans aren't trash
@WilsonFrontier I'm not irritated at all. Just standing up for recycling.  An attitude I am attempting to impart to my young children.
@WilsonFrontier Are your opinions "fair and balanced"?  You appear to be following me...or trolling...
@WilsonFrontier 'Trash' goes to a landfill or incinerator. 'Recyclables' go to a plant to become new things.
Let's put this to a vote - who thinks recyclable materials are 'trash'? One word answers, please @WilsonFrontier
@WilsonFrontier I think considering them "trash" was what was leading to an environmental crisis - before we got smart
@WilsonFrontier I'm just amazed that as a self-described 'aggressive liberal' you're in the dark ages on the recycling thing.
@WilsonFrontier just making the point that things evolve. Well, some things.
@WilsonFrontier Thankfully, we've moved past such horrendously wasteful ideas. Well, some of us have
@WilsonFrontier and what were you 50 years ago?  A few cells floating around in your mom&amp;dad #thingschange
@WilsonFrontier In my neighborhood, they're picked up by a recycling truck. It has a big symbol on the side that says RECYCLING
@WilsonFrontier How am I biased/twisting by calling recyclable materials for what they are?Seems to me people who call it trash are twisting
@WilsonFrontier I thought you were being both unfair and anti-environmental by labeling material that had been baled for recycling 'trash'
@WilsonFrontier And you are ignoring the new economy.  Not to mention environmentalism.  Go ahead and throw out all your cans
@WilsonFrontier When you consider one producer is shooting for 80% recycled material in new aluminum, it doesn't seem like trash at all
@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump I expect most environmentally-conscious people would consider those bales to be 'recyclable material'
@WilsonFrontier You recycle 'recyclables'.  Trash cannot be recycled.  That's why it's called 'trash'.
@SopanDeb Intellectual property theft.
@WilsonFrontier @KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump Interesting how Democrats see recycling as "trash".  Just sayin'........

@TeamTrumpNC @atensnut You're correct. Lewinsky (which I mentioned) was a peccadillo-the other incidents were of a different nature- apology
@MickSPrice @realDonaldTrump  So - what's your point?  That what he said in an early tweet supersedes what he said 14 hours later in person?
@Centaur6D @SenSessions3rd Wrong.
@Buckeye_75 This is what Trump said in NJ:  "If anyone thinks it wasn‚Äôt blown out of the sky, you‚Äôre 100 percent wrong, folks."
@MickSPrice Perhaps you missed this: "If anyone thinks it wasn‚Äôt blown out of the sky, you‚Äôre 100 percent wrong, folks." Trump in NJ
@Centaur6D @SenSessions3rd he also told a crowd in NJ that anyone who doesn't think it was "blown out of the sky is dead wrong"
@Buckeye_75 Ahem....DT said emphatically that the plane was "blown out of the sky"

.@FLGovScott endorses @realDonaldTrump   Not that he needed the help BEFORE his crushing victory here.
@daquenzer @GOP I started at 1880
@MGCoins @FoxNews He won his home state.
Fun fact - since 1880, there have been 8 'contested' @GOP conventions. In 5 of the 8 the winner went in without a plurality of delegates
@MediaOwl207 you're right.  That's a better way of saying it...or 3 OF 5
Tight race in MO, but the real story is 80+% of the vote is anti-establishment @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz
@MilkoDpaul @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @JohnKasich rule 40 may be rewritten before the convention. Rules cttee can do what it wants
@JamesA46 what you're forgetting is that winning creates momentum.
At this moment @realDonaldTrump is exactly 1/2 way to the 1237 delegate mark. He has 619
.@realDonaldTrump now 3 for 5 with one outstanding.  In the sports world, that's a win already..
.@realDonaldTrump takes NC from @tedcruz  - Trump 2 for 5 with 2 outstanding
It is now a 3-person race:  @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz and @JohnKasich
.@realDonaldTrump at 50+% in early and absentee in Palm Beach and Broward Counties.
.@marcorubio took 64% of early and absentee votes in Miami-Dade County.  That's his strongest area
.@realDonaldTrump opening with a big lead over @marcorubio in Florida.
Mitch McConnell reaching out to @realDonaldTrump is an indication the GOP establishment is coming to grips with the idea he will win.

@Blakegk If you had read the editorial before reacting - the premise was - she was urging the GOP to stop Trump then said she was voting HRC
@Blakegk @washingtonpost you utterly miss my point
@DTienes @washingtonpost the point she was making is that the GOP must stop Trump.  Like the Nationals asking the Sox to beat Yankees
.@washingtonpost columnist writes "We must stop Trump", then says she's going to vote for HRC. You kind of stop reading after that.

Here's the question of the night.  Will SC again play kingmaker as it has in so many elexn years, or will it be a repeat of 2012?
Still doing the math on 1st and 6th CD, but @realDonaldTrump has 44 delegates from SC so far.  Will likely take all 50.
.@RealBenCarson has a sneaky sense of humor.His campaign points out he received the same number of delegates as everyone except the winner=0
Already, more than 110,000 more people voted this year than in 2012 #SCGOPprimary
Did the @washingtonpost make a mistake or get hacked?  Their map has @marcorubio winning SC....
The next contests come fast and furious now!!!!!
What is going on in Spartanburg County??  No returns yet.  2nd place rides on those results
Race for 2nd tonight is going to be a skweeker...
Despite @marcorubio leading in Charleston and Richland Counties - @realDonaldTrump on track to take all 50 delegates. that would be yuuuge
.@marcorubio winning Charleston County
Bit of a surprise for @marcorubio Greenville County breaking his way.  I would have thought it was @tedcruz country
if the @JebBush vote goes to @marcorubio , he quickly vaults into 2nd place
Kudos to @JebBush for suspending on primary night instead of waiting a few days then quietly dropping like others  #headheldhigh
SC counties that are still out will likely favor @tedcruz over @marcorubio
Still early, and could change, but looking like @realDonaldTrump could come out of SC with 47 delegates - if not all 50.  whoa
If @realDonaldTrump maintains his double-digit margin in SC, that will lay down a very big chip for the contests ahead.Train will be rolling

it is all-out war between @realDonaldTrump and @JebBush
As I predicted earlier - @JebBush really going after @realDonaldTrump
didn't take long for @JebBush to start hitting @realDonaldTrump
.@marcorubio has strong start.  not sticking to talking points

Commercial break right off the top?  WTH?
@POTUS says he will nominate a SCOTUS justice in "due time".  I'm betting due time is somewhere between 36 hours and 10 days
