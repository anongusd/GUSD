Ground troops were not deployed to defend our people in our land, nor to go after the perpetrators. They maimed, killed, destroyed &amp; disappeared into thin air. Is there hope for Nigeria?

@Intergrity56 @MBuhari This indicates that Nigeria is on the precipice and needs to be salvaged urgently.
@bolanle_cole We need to understand that this hypocrisy/deciet is Bourne out of desperation for something which if not averted, will bring down Nigeria.
@Intergrity56 Great job!
@futurKing Mr Man, I believe you don't have an Idea of what has been happening in the State in question. Besides, why not enquire of the rationale behind supporting this person rather than making irresponsible comments. Who are you referring to that is pretending? If you are, I'm not.
@futurKing Your suggestion is not bad, however, the timing for a youth at this dispensation is not realistic due to certain factors. How do you expect a Youth to win at this crucial period when the finance to Carry out certain basic polical activities is not there?

@Buyandshipng @soloakon When you say that certain things or people are the same, that means that they share the same ideologies, characters etc. Be it known to you, they are not (the same)! You can't equate destroyers with builders, well informed with the naive, the extremist with the moderate.

@ArakunrinYinka About 50 communities so far destroyed in Adamawa State and by same fulani herdsmem.
@OtunbaBabalola They are facing the consequence of their actions.
@SweetShantel @MBuhari Oh! He must! As long as God lives. #ForTheLivesOfOurPeopleKilledbyHisKinsMen
@RealOlaudah Docility must come to an end now so that we all don't get consumed.
@boluxxxx Injustice in the highest order! Clear Display of Nepotism
@adeyanjudeji @FadaunsiAdeniyi Exactly! A just country.
@ChidiOdinkalu @FadaunsiAdeniyi @MBuhari This is the kind of impunity, injustice and insensitivity that is been perpatrated in this administration
Do we have a "government' in Nigeria? Our communities ( Gon, Bolki, Nzumosu and Yanga......and counting)   currently on fire-under attack by @fulani herdsmen. Over 45 communities were earlier  attacked, all in Numan Federation,  Adamawa State. Please let the world hear this!
@realKefason @HQNigerianArmy @hrw @YarKafanchan @ChidiOdinkalu @segalink @vashtiy This is the kind of injustice going on in the country.
@Steadi_lady It's largely about religion than tribe. Most of those killed by Fulani herdsmem are Christians.
@Nedunaija @VSD_NGO They expect Nigerians to be fools and cowards to swallow any trash they trow at them...... sorry for Nigeria!
@cindytrimm Amen
@Paula_White Amen
@ChidiOdinkalu Justice needs to be done for those who where treated unjustly.
@john_danfulani @MBuhari Those who preside over the affairs of our country and whatch the massive killing of our people and  have failed to protect us should honorable decline to contest the 2019 elections because God will disgrace them. For the blood of the innocent has reached God.
@The_Jonathanian Pretending that this is farmers Vs Fulani herdsmem clash is calling for dooms-day for the country they govern. Justice needs to be done.
