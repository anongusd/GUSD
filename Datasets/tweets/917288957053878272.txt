@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 Out of retaliation because he was arrested on mother's day 2017 for domestic violence i didn't press charges against him I should of. I didn't want to ruined his life.I try to get into shelters with my children they where all full.Inreturn he has done this to me out ofretaliation
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 My children  are in the care of the abuser who abused me. I for one feel sick about this situation  his attorney  wanted to keep me away from mychildren  when I did nothing to have my children taken away from me in the 1st place I did everything to keep my kids safe. He did this
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 My oldest child started  to act like her dad she didn't  like rules she would take her anger out on me and she threatened to kill me his attorney used me calling for help as a bad thing he twisted my words saying I didn't want my child.
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 I was accused  by the kids dad abussing him and my children I was never arrested  and child welfare was in our lives  because i had 1 mental breaking down by overdose  I couldn't deal with my husband abused me mentail/verbal abussive  to physical sometimes infront of our children
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 So they don't have to paid alimony and  child support and the attorney fees because it's a package deal filed a DVRO and divorce don't have to paid alimony and child support and the other person attorney fees  and take the children away from the other parent by accused them
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 I wish people wouldn't abused the domstic violence restraining order in family court system they do it all the time to gain custody away from the custodian parent. I was told from 1 attorney  they do this in CA because its a easy win for Abusser they can accused their victims
@CabductionToPL @Peace_Not_Pas @fatherscontact @murilyn123 I can speak about my sitution  the abuser  had attorney exsparta/to kidknapped the children had he served   DVRO that had allegations and divorce he stoled my custodian parent rights away. We had child welfare in our lives the judge granted him without me presented or contact CWF

@ferarimone I miss my children so much and i am very worried about them and how and what they are doing to my 3year old makes me sp sad how anyone can treat anyone like this
@ferarimone Thank  you Rumi it's along road a head  and I have to sale everything  because I will no longer have a place to live in feb. It's awful feeling and scary how a person can do so much destorying someone life
@ferarimone Child welfare/ trusting a story and 1st of all did a exsparta  when the children was never in danger from the start and he was good at gas slighting me / justice need to be served this is sicking and everyone involved with this should be charged because it damaged my kids /mylife
@ferarimone they will continue to lie and used  people  if its to money or family or attorney  in the end do these people ever think of this behavior has caused the children and their pain it is wrong for people to accused anyone of hurting a child and how come no one pick up the phone and
@ferarimone I will keep on telling the truth and he  calls me a lyre even though I  have  prove  he has no prove  but his Declaration and attorney  this a  nightmare especially   these people  do this because  they wanted out but  they don't want to pay alimony or child support.
@ferarimone Talk about respect and love this is not love or respect and it is very painful and damaging and dysfunctional  DV restraining order ruined lives and exspelly the children lives  and the one who started this mess don't  care how or who it hurts
@ferarimone This is a nightmare I don't wish anyone to go through this/I tell  my story  to warn their is evil /these people  have good educated  and carsmanic they are good at their games as a player  they are poison to your life and to the children they will lie/cheat to get what they want
@ferarimone This Attorney down grade the real victim and does not believe in the welfair and safety of my children  and the lies my kids dad keep on lying and he has nothing to backup his story  not a paper trail maybe a video  because  i was gas light many times but their is no paper trail
@ferarimone This is sicking and how easy how to put a DV restraining order against the real victim and his attorney profile  online saids he is a biggest advocacy  for DV victims  I can say NO he isn't  and he is the person who abuse  people  and he stand by them  and the attorney down grade
@ferarimone His attorney  and my lame duck attorney  sold me out because  she had all the facts infront of her and rhe edvince  in front of her she blame me because I should filed a restraining order against him so she feed  into their hand  and sold me down the line
@ferarimone To my background in and out of the foster care system  and my learning disability  to i try raking my life from the start in April  and him and  his high paid attorney  try to used this against  me  to try to get his permit  restraining order against me  how is this abuse people?
@ferarimone Just because  he was arrested on mother's day of this year  he used the DA drop charges latter against him inreturn he made a big story out of thin air and child welfare case pland  he didn't  subment the real one that everyone had signed  and the lies he made up
@ferarimone You never know when he or she is telling the truth  to the words trust me to the other words give me time things will get better NO this a nightmare  I don't wish anyone to go through this hell. 13 years to end in this way and accused  me of physical abuse my children and him
@ferarimone And if they are forcing to get abortion  or their family is.  Also if they blame u for their actions and behavior  and their family  behavior  get out don't be a fool it is never going to get better the lies and the stealing and hiding instead of comuncation  ends up being a game
@ferarimone To later if the true victim speak out these people used money and a price if attorney  to take children wrongfully by misusing a DV restraining order against  their victims  stay away. Look at the warnings  sighns  if they can lie to their family about you from the start
@ferarimone I will say NO because these peiple don't ever married  a US citizen  for love / they  think anyone can exsept them abuse/used children  in a court room or documents   our court system  should  check things out these people are slick at their game at marrying us citizen /have kids

@MissyDuckWife @JaseDuckman @FocusFamily Focus on the family has been around  for a very long time
@sooyoenc Sadness
the truth is the best thing/ actions speak louder then words,  No man who ever loved his wife doesn't act in this manner this is hate / evil
a true victim does not threat or threatened anyone,  They are focus on whats best for the children lying is not the best thing .
and tell them if she doesn't do what I ask her to do  then I am going to do this. this behavior is mental abuse
or want to be the center of attention they don't threaten the other spouse by using people to be middle to be message
and plays victim and enjoy life the real victim crys them self to sleep they miss their family and don't go to party's
anyone said this guy loves his wife is a fool a guy who loves his wife don't make up lies / files a dv restraining order
while he acts like he won a prize for lying, He doesn't care who he hurts  not even the children his friends, family stand by him
the perpetrator is playing victim and he made up lies and the real victim is not enjoying this at all and her life is torn upside down
This is not better this is worse and how can the perpetrator enjoy life and and act like nothing is wrong go to work
I was told you all are in counseling and things will get better same with the social worker/ my individual counseling /family counseling

What he has done to me has been damaging while he is enjoying his life while he hurts hurt my children by doing this emotionally,
The laws should be changed about getting a dv restraining  order  no one should have the right to hire attorney and make up a story.
