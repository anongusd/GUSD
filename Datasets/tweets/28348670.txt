A10: This week, YWCA is also conducting our annual #WeekWithoutViolence campaign, which focuses on raising awareness and holding events around supporting survivors and ending gender-based violence. Visit https://t.co/HGEIlaGdQI to learn more! #Safety4Survivors #WWV18
A9: Improvements continue to be made, and we thank organizations like @ndvh @RAINN @nnedv and others for continuing to push for change and proper trauma-informed, survivor-centered responses with 21st century technology. This is vital for survivor support. #Safety4Survivors
A9: Siri can now direct those trying to leave a #DV situation or who have been sexually assaulted to the @ndvh. Organizations like @RAINN have worked with companies like Apple to adjust their language to support survivors &amp; give more compassionate responses. #Safety4Survivors
A8: 1 in 3 US teens have experienced some form of abuse by a dating partner. @WithoutViolence provides excellent resources on steps parents/guardians can take to talk to teens &amp; younger people about #DV. #Safety4Survivors
A8: We absolutely have to meet young people where they are when it comes to talking about building healthy relationships. #Safety4Survivors
A7: We encourage folks to use social media too, to encourage candidates &amp; lawmakers to support these vital policies. Tag your officials &amp; candidates on social media to ask them to publicly support survivors of violence, as well as #VAWA &amp; #FVPSA reauthorization. #Safety4Survivors
A7: Collective action requires collective responsibility, &amp; it all starts with YOU! It is critical that we each engage with our elected officials and political candidates on the important issue of gender-based violence. Calling, writing, attending forums &amp; more. #Safety4Survivors
A6: Can't think of many off the top of our heads‚Äîand that is incredibly telling. It's indicative of a toxic culture that still struggles to center survivors, neglects their needs, and normalizes violence, victim-blaming, and toxic masculinity. #Safety4Survivors
A5: Along with our YWCA resources, we also love amazing, survivor-centered, trauma-informed organizations such as  @ujimacommunity @NWLC @NNEDV @USOW @WithoutViolence @StopStHarassmnt @EROC @RAINN &amp; many more‚Äîorgs that take care to center the most marginalized. #Safety4Survivors
A5: YWCA is the largest network of #DV service providers in the country. We follow the lead and share &amp; leverage the resources of our entire network of YWCAs across the country, in locations urban, rural, and everything in between. Together, we are #OnAMission. #Safety4Survivors
A4: It is important that we share local and national resources with media so that survivor stories have nuance, and don't unintentionally victim blame. Also, pro-tip: reach out to advocates so we can provide context on the complexities of gender-based violence. #Safety4Survivors
A4: We have seen with #MeToo and #TimesUp, that media can be a powerful tool in shaping public perception of domestic violence. It can help raise awareness, facilitate conversations, mobilize, and debunk common myths around #DV. #Safety4Survivors
A3: Media reports often shift blame from the perpetrators to survivors. This encourages a culture of victim-blaming and implies that survivors hold responsibility for other‚Äôs violent behavior.		üó£Ô∏èFALSE! It's NEVER a survivor's fault for their abusers' behavior. #Safety4Survivors
A2: In order to address safety for survivors and to end sexual violence, it's critical that we take an intersectional approached. 		One starting point to learn more, get resources, and raise awareness is our #WeekWithoutViolence campaign! https://t.co/bpqBAnx5xk #Safety4Survivors
A2: Domestic violence impacts all of us, however, it doesn't impact all communities equally. In order to have #Safety4Survivors, our solutions should start with the most severely impacted by #DV‚Äî their access and safety needs, their voices and their visions for justice.
Black women are 35% more likely to experience intimate partner violence than White women, and that 1 in 3 Latina women experience physical violence in their life time. #Safety4Survivors https://t.co/prVMDPRori
A1: We know WOC are disproportionately impacted by #DV. That's why @YWCAUSA works to support women &amp; girls of color &amp; other marginalized survivors; poor women, LGBTQ+ survivors, survivors with disabilities, rural women, &amp; women who live at the intersections. #Safety4Survivors
A1: One of the most pervasive myths about #DV is that "fleeing domestic violence is easy." we know that the barriers to getting safe from abuse loom large, and that women of color and other marginalized groups have less access to resources to get and stay safe. #Safety4Survivors
