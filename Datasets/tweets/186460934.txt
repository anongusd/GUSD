@visions_studios @Copwatch That's a great example and I would love to see more of that (minus the killing part).
@visions_studios @Copwatch Sorry, I was referring to the Cpt Johnson situation.
@visions_studios @Copwatch You won't hear any argument here. Rapport between police and citizens can always be improved.
@visions_studios @Copwatch I'm not sure, I wasn't there. But it happens a lot.
@visions_studios @Copwatch Agreed, but it's really difficult to hear everyone in among all the "f*** the police!"
