Let's bring science out of the shadows. Public policy needs to be made with public data.
What's so stunningly disheartening here is that if you go back &amp; look @ President's memos he/the Admin demand this same transparency!
If you go back 10 yrs, our friends on the left demanded the same thing we're demanding now. #publicpolicypublicdata
We have the confirmation from the EPA itself that they are perfectly capable of blinding any details that are confidential. #secretscience
(Cont.) H.R. 4012 is part of that commitment to transparency. #secretscience
If ur going to make #publicpolicy, do it by #publicdata. Is there anyone, when running 4 office, who didn't commit 2 transparency?
