@thomaskaine5 I want control,if possible, over my reactions to everything. The only way to achieve that , I believe, is breath control in stressful situations.

@lmlTN @djrothkopf If you can’t find people around you to trust head to either coast, there are better chances of meeting people you can relate to better.I’ve traveled to so many places in my life, I’ve always found good people in the oddest of places, even in Muslim Countries. Most people = good.
@lmlTN @djrothkopf Got me thinking, yes in fact I have an old friend in Tennessee. Haven’t heard from her in years but she’s from there.
@lmlTN @djrothkopf I don’t blame you for you concern about the people around you. The South can a great place with great people, delicious food and pleasant parties. There are no doubt good people all around you. They are quiet in these divisive times, it doesn’t mean they aren’t there.

None of us that can move will long tolerate abuse, with out reaching out to other fellow Veterans to see what we can form. This is my belief as a Veteran. We are all smarter than the general public think
@lmlTN @djrothkopf There will also be a Veteran willing to teach if the time comes.
@lmlTN @djrothkopf Don’t worry about weapons. The Trump business oriented folks, are always thinking profit when things get tight. This one of the top gun toting nations of the world. There will always be a gun for purchase unless laws change. Plenty of ammo too.  Worry about learning how to shot.
