@Freeland56 also, everyone is trying to stop the flow of drugs in from the southern border. The Obama administration is doing that already
@Freeland56 trying to curb that is not xenophobic. Saying someone can't do his job do to his race is xenophobic
@Freeland56 the country. He has also made fun of someone with a disability and tweeted said stuff with major racist undertones
@Freeland56 he said a federal judge was incapable of doing his job because of his ethnicity, he wants to bar an entire religion from enterin
@Freeland56 Hollywood and show biz tends to be liberal. I don't think anyone will argue that. There are conservatives in that industry tho
@Freeland56 and the reason why the media is "painting" Trump out to be xenophobic this election cycle is because he IS xenophobic
@Freeland56 I understand your thoughts on that, but that spin doesn't come from the media
@Freeland56 the amount readers/viewers for right leaning outlets as a whole is just as large as the audience as left leaning
@Freeland56 others. There are outlets that lean left, and outlets that lean right. While by some objective measures, more outlets lean left
@Freeland56 except Fox, you know the most watched cable news network in the country. Every news organization has some bias, some more than
@Freeland56 getting the most clicks/viewers/readers is misleading
@Freeland56 and the media is not liberally biased. Every news outlet has their own bias, but to suggest the media has an agenda other than
@Freeland56 mistakes. They refuse to admit when they mess up and defend the indefensible. That drags out stories like the plagiarism one
@Freeland56 MSNBCs largest program is hosted by a Republican. CNN is sensationalist. The Trump campaign does not effectively deal with
@Freeland56 @MattJN29 huh? I really don't think you can make the case the media "belittling" the convention in any way
@MattJN29 our chaos is more fun. It's just political theater, not a global crisis (at least not yet)
I tried to watch the RNC all night, I really did. I just can't listen to any more gun control disillusionment
@MattJN29 The DNC isn't this week, so we don't know exactly how it will be covered. Might not totally dominate the news cycle like RNC has
The party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower for has now nominated a racist reality TV star for president
RT @MattOrtega: We pick up our live coverage from the Lincoln Memorial already in progress:	#GOPconvention https://t.co/5NyIpcsJI3

I wish that what I value would ultimately prevail in sports is because I want it to prevail somewhere, even if its not the real world

@kylebbader why would he get rid of a law if its fun?
@SCJH14 doesn't get any better than that
@SCJH14 I never said Purdue was good, I'm just saying they are capable of playing up to very high competition. Plus OSU didn't lose, it
@SCJH14 the same Purdue team ND struggled with. OSU did look pretty impressive the rest of the year though by not losing a game all year
@SCJH14 yeah because Notre Dame has looked so impressive tonight
Cavs game with the family
Is there a better way to bring in the new year than going over the fiscal cliff and completely decimating our economy?

@Kel_sea123 That is quite an honor
@Nick_Thomas47 eww?
@FakePatShurmur why aren't you campaigning more for buster skrine as a pro-bowler?
@IfYouSeekJennyy hmm
@IfYouSeekJennyy oops. What did he say?
@IfYouSeekJennyy I'm pretty sure it's from the sandlot. When they went over to James Earl Jones house
@IfYouSeekJennyy the sandlot?
@IfYouSeekJennyy I'm blanking. What is it?
Feels like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders
See the stone set in your eyes, see the thorn twist in your side
@kylebbader most their missiles probably are from terrorist like Hamas
@kylebbader yeah they treat their citizens awfully. I don't think they value our aid much though
@kylebbader I didn't know we gave aid to Palestinian territories
@kylebbader Well I don't think it was negative to say we would crush them militarily
@kylebbader Just being realistic haha
@kylebbader I wouldn't be so sure. A lot of the UN sides with Palestine, though the Israeli/US military could crush them if need be
@kylebbader @GlutenFriedman The US may not recognize Palestine, but they have no power to veto it.
@GlutenFriedman @kylebbader You're right Ryan. Palestine will now demand the territory they lost in 1967 (which includes east Jerusalem
@kylebbader The UN voted to make Palestine an official state. The old Palestinian territories are now an official country
The UN's vote for Palestinian statehood is more symbolic than anything. It is, however, a setback as far as peace is concerned
@madi_spector we lost
It's 4:51 and ohio state is still better than Michigan
12-0

Wow that was an awful game

@LValentine19 are you dressing up tommorow?
@Nick_Thomas47 nope i sound exactly like them
@Nick_Thomas47 did you just call the beatles "crappy music"? And yak isnt a word
Obama killed it tonight. It was 10 times better than the last debate #fourmoreyears
If Romney cares so much about all Americans, then why did he say 47% of Americans are moochers?
Romney calls them "illegals." He needs to realize that these people come here looking for a better life
You can tell a lot about someones view on immigration based on whether they say "illegal" or "undocumented"
@IfYouSeekJennyy where'd you hear that story at?

Joe Biden was awesome. It was refreshing to see someone call out the Romney/Ryan ticket on their misrepresentations of the facts.

@jamiegabrielle_  that is actually one of the cutest things I have ever seen
This game will only make it even more worth the wait when Cleveland finally wins it
With Lebron winning everyone wins. The NBA wins, ESPN wins, and bandwagon fans everywhere wins. The only losers are the Cleveland fans.
These refs need to show Fisher more respect. He deserves it. If anything, he should be getting all the calls, not Lebron
These Miami fans disgust me. There is not a city in the world that deserves a championship less
The way ESPN talks about Lebron is ridiculous. Their narcissism is getting old
