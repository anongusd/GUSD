@petermwaurajohn @CNN She most certainly did. She made a terrible mistake that she can never undo.
@CNN Yes I love our vets &amp; America. Did you read my whole tweet? I showed a little empathy to her as a 19 year old &amp; said it’s not up to me if she comes back or not.
@CNN For those trolling me over my comment. Explain to me why it’s perfectly okay for Trump to work with Dictators all over the world (very old &amp; knows better)but to even show 1 ounce of empathy to a girl who was an American citizen &amp;19 when she made the worst decision ever is wrong?
@CNN Some people are more naive, innocent,&amp; easily manipulated. I won’t judge her. As far as her coming back home obviously that’s not up to me. If they do decide to let her come home; She will need years of special counseling, deprograming, special housing, &amp; security (Etc.)

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump People need to realize that not every pregnancy goes according to plan. Absolutely nobody is getting late term abortions just because they changed their mind about having a baby. The laws are meant to protect the women &amp; drs.

@dawnsaffron @Induced_Karma @MoreWhit @lillyabbi @SenSanders I’m hoping modernization will be more beneficial in the end. Kind of like the windmills &amp; solar panels.

@Induced_Karma @dawnsaffron @MoreWhit @lillyabbi @SenSanders I think he meant our highway system was supposed to be like theirs and that not enough money has gone to the repairs of the roads/bridges etc. Alot of people would also love to see better train and public transit accessibility as well.

@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS The only way to keep America safe is to get rid of Trump and everyone else involved with his treasonous crimes. America says no to fascist ideology and propaganda! #NoWall #EndTheShutDown  #ImpeachTheMF #ImpeachTrump
@realDonaldTrump Do you really believe the crap that comes out of your own mouth, or do you just make it up as you go? Just another basic bait and switch routine. We say no to fascist ideology and propaganda. No wall. No holding America people and government hostage. #EndTheShutDown
@realDonaldTrump What are you going to do if you don’t get your way and get a wall? Silence us all? Lock us all up in cages? Kill us? We’ve said yes to better boarder security and technology but we don’t want a useless expensive wall. Get over it! #EndTheShutDown https://t.co/KLGkmN1xkb

@realDonaldTrump You showed no sympathy or concern for them when it happened. Your VP even claimed ISIS was destroyed the same day ISIS killed them.

@tedlieu @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a national security risk. Time and time again he has released sensitive information to the public. Why is nobody stopping him? Other government officials have been fired from their jobs for lesser offenses. He needs to resign or get impeached ASAP.
@PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You obviously don’t give a crap about America, our military, or our allies. Time and time again you purposely put America in danger by tweeting things that shouldn’t be known to the public. You are a spiteful evil little man. Stop using America as a pawn over a stupid wall!
