@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Is that better?
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon How the hell am I demonizing "trumpers" they don't like the truth. It's not demonizing lol. I'm not calling you guys a threat either. I'm calling you guys LIARS.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon So again exactly tell me how am I calling Republicans threats? Saying Trumpers don't like facts is calling Republicans a threat? I'm not following. All Republicans aren't trump's supporters. That's why I said "Trumpers don't like facts"
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Did I say Republicans are a threat? NO. I said YOU GUYS don't like the truth. You're obviously not comprehending anything.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Have a great night, hope you come to the realization, facts are facts.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon You should identify it by what it is, White Males are the threat. I understand Trumpers don't like facts.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon https://t.co/TSOhQeCHYL
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Yes, those shooting happen, they were in fact not committed by white males- but white males commite most of them. White men are the terror threats to America.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Are you ignorant or what? More WHITE MEN have committed more mass shooting than any other race. You naming these mass shooting is doing nothing but, in fact showing how blind you are to the situation.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon I'm a political analyst... I do my own research.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon It's not "demonizing" when it's facts. If you can't come to terms with the facts, then that's a personal problem. Facts are not "selective," the only thing that is selective is what you want to believe. Facts first.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon I'm white and I stand by my factual statement. White men are a big problem with terror/hate attacks, it's facts... not demonizing anyone or any race.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon How is point out facts- racism. Look at DJT that'll give you an idea of what racist is.

@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon White MALES are the biggest threat to America. Whether you believe it or not, that's a personal problem, facts don't lie and facts show White Males are the real problem and I just gave you ONE example.
@consulting_ckc @tvcpa @donlemon Maybe this will help you @consulting_ckc- again, Don Lemon isn't wrong. 	Not including the synagogue &amp; the cali bar that was shot up were also by WHITE MALES. https://t.co/bZHF0EJA44
