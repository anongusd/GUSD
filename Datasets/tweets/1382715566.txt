@alanfair12 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump You either want to dislike me and act like or you misread the entire point of my tweet.

@alanfair12 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump It choosers to pay more to cover for the expenditures of the other member nations who aren‚Äôt meeting their cut of the bill. Tanks and planes cost money even when just sitting in storage. Someone has to pay for it.
@Happych38907506 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Yeah no.
