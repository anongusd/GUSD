@realDonaldTrump Me: Opens up a tweet from Donald Trump	reads*	Me: checks to make sure it's not a parody account. Whispers "oh god, it's real"
the people of the United States and those beyond will see a dramatic change in our borders.
Once we protect the border through a well planned and modern method of security, bring aid to the countries (such as Honduras and Guatemala), and thoroughly revise the process to become a United States Citizen (making it easy and effective)...
The impact of a wall could be catastrophic for many who live on the border. We live in 2018 almost 2019. The United States is capable of enforcing a border protection system that centers around technology This technology is, in many ways, a much better system of security...
The United States has created a system, that for most immigrants, is hopeless. Crossing the border is the only chance many of these people have for a better life. The system needs to be quicker and more effective. We do need better border security so let's talk about this...
When we stop putting forth efforts to help these countries we fuel the terror that many of these people see as a justifiable cause for coming to the United States. People who have ties to the United States can wait over twenty years to Become a United States citizen...
If the United States cuts off ties to countries like Honduras and Guatemala the problem at our border will deepen. Many people from these countries illegally cross into the United States (a potentially deadly journey) to find freedom from violence and hunger...

Stand up for your beliefs and stand with those who will not tolerate Donald Trump. #resigntrump #TrumpResign
When the people of the United States condemn Trump we do not have anger out of Hate. We have anger for the hate that our president supports and condones and caues. We will not stand for hate. We will fight. To first love you must hate the sources of evil...
Americans scorn the German people for not seeing the wickedness of Adolf Hitler, yet many Americans see the hatred that Donald Trump is spreading and do nothing. He is blaming American problems on Hispanics just as Hitler blamed the jewish people for Germany‚Äôs problems...
POTUS has placed a massive ‚Äúevil‚Äù symbol on every Hispanic person. While these labels are not able to be touched, they are real. A label resembling The Star of David patched on the Jewish people...
The way many People treat those who are fleeing violence is beyond the word ‚Äúterrible‚Äù. Donald Trump has used the irrational fears of the average middle class American and used them to create a completely false and horrible picture of a Hispanic human...
Merry Christmas. Like fr you guys have and amazing holiday.

@daedwards99 @BernieSanders I do support local businesses, that's why I'm talking about this. Small businesses will die when they have to pay their employees more than double their normal salary. It's just the hard truth. Not everything is so black and white. btw hate McDonald's.
@j_judd81 @KamalaHarris https://t.co/TPDQxD1agf
@BernieSanders raise their prices. Once a small business increases their prices, people will go to places like McDonald's and other fast food restaurants instead. Small businesses will die! Most Democrats do not care about small businesses. That's the #Bostontea
@BernieSanders Yes, the minimum is not enough to support a household... but fr you would have to increase to $15 or more. You can't do that across the board. The average restaurant does not even last a year. Small businesses cannot pay their employees double. If they did they would have to...

@SenJohnKennedy you could make it to where a victim could sign up to be a part of the program that contacts them when the perpetrator is released. Many victims do not want to be reminded or have this topic come back into their life. It needs to be a choice

@stuartHWD68 @SenCoryGardner I am not agreeing or disagreeing with you but why is he ineffective. I'm not from CO. I would just like to know
@jbheyen1 @SenCoryGardner Just curious, why is he a failing leader. I'm not from CO so I don't know.

@rcarr57 @PattyMurray Blame congress and all those that won't compromise
@DLKrupicka @PattyMurray This is true, the Democrats don't want a wall. A wall will keep their future voters out. #bostontea
We must:	1.) Elect those who reflect the integrity we stand for as Amer. citizens	2.) Hold those leaders accountable (They work for us)	3.) Not only voice our opinion but take action in the fight. 		Lives are impacted daily. Politics is not a reality show; it has a real impact.
I am exhausted of D.C.'s political corruption. Sadly, corruption in Washington will always exist. As long as there are people in power, there will be corruption. It is our job as American citizens to diminish the corruption bubbling up from the swamp. #bostontea
