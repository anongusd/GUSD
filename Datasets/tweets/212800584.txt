@Aftermath8 @socialism_doer @josheidelson @Patrick_Fenelon Yeah, it's not necessarily a bad idea -- and I think the other thing to remember is that the UAW hasn't historically represented workers at companies who are "start-ups" where equity arrangements are more common.
@TroyWarr @OllieMcClellan @josheidelson UAW does have variable compensation schemes in contracts so workers can share in the company‚Äôs sucess, based on a negotiated contract and what works at that employer. Saying equity will go away if workers organize is disingenuous and a pretty clear-cut violation of labor law.
@Aftermath8 @socialism_doer @josheidelson @Patrick_Fenelon There are UAW contracts with different variable compensation schemes tied to employer performance (e.g. profit sharing, quality bonuses, etc.). There‚Äôs no reason, in principle, why stock options couldn‚Äôt be in the mix from the UAW point of view.

Not to mention that, procedurally, this is a non-starter. You need 3/4 of state legislatures (or special conventions) to ratify a constitutional amendment rescinding the second amendment. Inconceivable.
