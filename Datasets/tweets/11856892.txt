.@proflevin on the white nationalist movement: "Unfortunately, this movement is one that glorifies getting military people involved." #MTPDaily

.@WisenbergSol  on the wrap-up of the Mueller investigation: “I think you’ll get a lot of answers in Mueller’s report to the AG...it’s expected that he will actually file a report about what he found.” #MTPDaily
"I suspect that Mueller, while his report will be fulsome, he will write it in a way so that it can be released by Barr...in a way that does not disclose that much 6c'd [classified] information," @WisenbergSol says. #MTPDaily

“We have to go full on and we have to fight this out. It is a fundamental constitutional issue that goes to the heart of whether we have a democracy…or whether we have an imperial presidency.” —@RepGaramendi on opposition to the president’s national emergency declaration
What message would Congress with a vote to disapprove of Trump's emergency declaration?		@SykesCharlie: "It would be a rebuke of the president, it would be a substantial precedent and it would be the first time that a substantial number of Republicans have” pushed back on Trump."
.@SykesCharlie says that there is a “very real possibility” a vote to disapprove of the president’s national emergency declaration passes both the House and Senate because “it doesn’t take that many Republican votes” in the Senate #MTPDaily

.@carolelee says President Trump "takes little kernels of truth and exploits them” as he defends himself from criticism, which helps him convince people who are "not paying attention to every turn of events." #MTPDaily
.@pbump says he learned a valuable lesson during jury duty that helps explain President Trump's view of discrediting opponents:		“There are some people that you can’t convince with facts, only with emotions. That’s how Donald Trump operates every single day of his life.”
“The president is doing what he always does, especially when it comes to law enforcement and the Mueller investment. He is trying to muddy the waters so that way when the truth finally comes out, people are already sided one way.” —@DelPercioS on Trump's criticism of McCabe
.@KatyTurNBC: Should Americans be skeptical about former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe's claims because he's selling a book? 		@BarbMcQuade: “We are always wise to be skeptical...But based on what is publicly known, Andrew McCabe is not really revealing any new facts here."
WATCH: Is Andrew McCabe believable or is he just selling a book? #MTPDaily		@BarbMcQuade: "Andrew McCabe is promoting a book, but it lines up with other things that Jim Comey has said and other things that Rod Rosenstein has said." https://t.co/nSu73qnQZ8
@BarbMcQuade says that in his public interviews, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe “does a nice job of summarizing all the red flags that were there and prompted them to want to appoint a special counsel” related to the Russia investigation #MTPDaily

“It is an unusual moment in time: Now we are used to President Trump talking about being good buddies with Kim Jong Un, and wanting these conferences and face-to-face meetings that no president has ever given the North Korean leader before.” —@charlie_savage on #MTPDaily
WATCH: How big of a "red flag" would it be if President Trump actually said the things Andrew McCabe alleges in his new book? #MTPDaily		@charlie_savage: "There were a lot of people with their hair on fire about what was happening at the highest levels of the government." https://t.co/gLJYYIKamy
.@BarbMcQuade notes that in 2017, as former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe says he and others grew concerned about President Trump's conduct, McCabe may have known about "additional communications" not made public yet that influenced their thinking #MTPDaily
“It’s clear that at that particular moment, in May of 2017, there were a lot of people with their hair on fire about what was happening at the highest levels of U.S. government, Andy McCabe among them.” —@charlie_savage on #MTPDaily
.@selectedwisdom says former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe's comments should be taken with "high credibility mostly because it is consistent with so many other times that President Trump has taken the world of Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies.” #MTPDaily

FULL INTERVIEW: @AOC on the Democratic Party, Green New Deal, 2020 candidates #MTPDaily 		https://t.co/CETSVaKW9A https://t.co/ANGrRw2kdB
WATCH: What does @AOC make of Elizabeth Warren’s claims of Native-American ancestry?		“As a Puerto-Rican woman, my identity is the descendant of many different identities… doesn’t mean I’m black, that doesn’t mean I’m native, but I can tell the story of my ancestors.” #MTPDaily https://t.co/4AWZOlboFd
"The beauty of the Green New Deal…is that she is putting all the coalitions together under one," @MariaTeresa1 says about @AOC. #MTPDaily
"I think she doesn’t totally want to be under Pelosi’s control," @alexi says about @AOC's decision to not be on the select committee on studying climate change. #MTPDaily
"It's a broad scope and an outline to sort of move the chess pieces," @alexi says about @AOC's Green New Deal. #MTPDaily
"Part of the goal of the president's State of the Union address, bringing up the issue of socialism...it's about trying to frame the 2020 election about Republican conservatism against Democratic socialism," @costareports says. #MTPDaily
WATCH: Why is @AOC not on the Select Committee on Climate Change, despite being invited?		“I do want to be on it… The speaker was gracious enough to invite me on it… I would have to give up doing my job well and I don’t want to give that up.” #MTPDaily https://t.co/6pxlbJXCML
WATCH: @AOC talks independent voters on #MTPDaily:		“People have this mistaken idea that American politics is on this one linear line between left and right. 40% of the American public identify as Independents. That doesn’t mean were in the middle, that means we hate this thing.” https://t.co/SIQUr66sBP
"I hope we use this primary not as a horse race around personalities, but around our ideals," @AOC says about the 2020 presidential primary. #MTPDaily
"I love Senator Sanders, I think he's great. I think in terms of an endorsement, I joke and I say, 'Don't ask me until the day of the New York primary,'" says @AOC. #MTPDaily
Asked how moderates might respond to her wing of the party, @AOC says: "No matter how you feel about Bernie Sanders...he wins Independents." #MTPDaily
"I think we are 100% bought in on addressing climate," @AOC says about the Democratic Party.  #MTPDaily
WATCH: @AOC discusses the launch of the Green New Deal. #MTPDaily 		AOC: “We launched with over 60 cosponsors in the House. That’s pretty crazy… I think we may even get the majority of the Democratic caucus on board.” https://t.co/v53Md3rJU0
Asked why she was not placed on the select committee studying climate change solutions, @AOC responds "I do want to be on it." 		"The speaker was gracious enough to invite me on it," @AOC says but had to turn it down due to her other committee assignments. #MTPDaily
On how to fund the Green New Deal, @AOC says, "What we’re trying to do is release the investments from the federal government to mobilize those resources from across the country." #MTPDaily
WATCH: @AOC joins #MTPDaily --&gt;		AOC: “I don’t think young people and that the energy around climate change is… just a young people thing” Ocasio-Cortez adds, “But at the same time I also believe that, like all big movement-moments, young people are putting the gas in the tank.” https://t.co/VQrqeyOGuB
"When we work as a progressive movement here, it needs to be led by workers," @AOC says. #MTPDaily
"I think when it comes to making those compromises, it's all about the landscape when we get there," @AOC says negotiating policies in the Green New Deal. #MTPDaily
"I want a 2020 candidate that says we can do these things, we can be audacious," @AOC says on progressive issues such as Medicare-for-all. #MTPDaily
"We need commitments with teeth," @AOC says to 2020 contenders. "So I don't want to be placated as a progressive." #MTPDaily
"I don’t think that a 2020 nominee can afford to be bad on issues of race," says @AOC. "I don’t think they can afford to be bad on economic justice either." #MTPDaily
"I don't think I've created a political movement, I think I'm part of one," @AOC says. #MTPDaily
"I think all of these nominees have time," @AOC says about Elizabeth Warren and the 2020 Democrats. #MTPDaily
"I am a descendant of all sorts of folks. That doesn't mean I'm black. That doesn't mean I'm native. But that does mean I can tell the story of my ancestors," @AOC says. #MTPDaily
On Elizabeth Warren @AOC says: "I think there's still an opportunity to model what the correct way of navigating these waters looks like." #MTPDaily
"I believe that like all big movements in American history young people are putting the gas in the tank," says @AOC. #MTPDaily

.@peterbakernyt says that only two presidents in recent memory have come into their #SOTU with lower approval numbers: 		—President Reagan in 1983, during an economic recession	—President George W. Bush "when things were so bad with Iraq."		#MTPDaily

.@peterbakernyt says “there’s something comforting about the ritual” of having a #SOTU amid the divisions in Washington #MTPDaily
“We are a week plus away from another potential government shutdown, the Democratic Party could not be more interested in resistance and retribution than they are right now.” —@kasie on how this year's #SOTU prep resembles that of other years despite the turmoil in D.C. #MTPDaily

"The reality of Washington is that when people do dumb things it’s because it was dumb, not because of some vast conspiracy," @dpletka continues. #MTPDaily
"Donald Trump has to behave different vis a vis Russia but I think the notion that there is a vast Russia net controlling the Republican Party…is almost ridiculous," @dpletka says. #MTPDaily
"You don’t have the Republican voices that we should when it comes to this notion that the president might be compromised," @MariaTeresa1 says. "Are there other folks that are in the party that may be compromised that we are not aware of?" #MTPDaily
"President Trump has told us who he is from the very beginning, and he’s always had authoritarian tendencies," says @dpletka. #MTPDaily

Asked if Putin is treating Trump as an asset, @jmclaughlinSAIS responds, "I wouldn't put it quite that way. What Putin is doing is testing Trump. He's telling him a lie, and seeing if he buys it. And Trump buys it." #MTPDaily
@McFaul on Russian adoptions: "Any time you hear that word, they're actually talking about lifting of sanctions." #MTPDaily
