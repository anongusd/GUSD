Authorities investigating Butte County #campfire have identified a possible second origin of the fire near Concow. No additional details available.
The @ButteSheriff says there are 631 missing or unaccounted for people from the #campfire. It's a huge increase from the 300 earlier today based on review of 911 calls and other contact with authorities. Many could be out of contact with friends/family.

Several school districts across Bay Area have now announced cancelled classes Friday: SF, Oakland, Mt. Diablo, Alameda, Pittsburg. I'm guessing this is just the start of a pretty comprehensive closure list. The air is that bad out there in the Bay Area.
Add Alameda Unified to the list of closed schools Friday.
Looks like San Francisco and Oakland schools will not be open Friday because of air quality. We're checking now on whether other Bay Area districts will follow suit. Stay tuned.
Good morning. Just a quick update on the state superintendent race: @TonyThurmond still ahead of @MarshallTuck by about 75,000 votes. Still too close to call and likely several more nail-biting days of vote counting. There are more than 1 million ballots still uncounted.
