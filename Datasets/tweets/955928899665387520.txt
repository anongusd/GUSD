I always watch the principles in Summits for eye and facial reactions. Kim's was disgust and VICTORY!
No similar expression like Kim's for Trump can be remembered since Hitler for Chamberlain. It's true. Trump LOST in Hanoi! 9-0? Maybe more.
Kim's expression in his eyes and face said it all. He wondered, frankly, if Trump had lost his F'n mind? LOL Kim won in Hanoi! DumBper lost. Sad for the U.S. But, true.
.... or, are we doomed to like the preacher said, "Are we doomed to saying it, that our place, our Democratic Party, is going to shit?" I hope not! I don't think so. But, choose wisely the candidate vs Trump. OK? Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We are so lucky, FORTUNATE! BLESSED! that Twitter was created!!!!!!

Are we Dems just 'Rock Ridge'? or are we JFK 1960?!!!!! Strong!!!!! Eh????
TWITTER must be used as an AUDITORIUM of Trump mistakes! His Vietnam MISTAKE! And, so many others! He, Trump, is a MISTAKE! OK? LOL HE IS!!!
In the words of Harry (TRUMAN), I want Hell to rain down on Trump in 2019 and 2020! All the way to Nov 2020! Nothing else! Are you GIANTS! Ready to CRUSH MAGAts? Or, are we just fucking off? :(

CBS-Murrow, Cronkite, Rather, Severeid, etal! Wallace, and, more! Cronkite would vomit at Trump being president!
Another, which is good for Opinion pieces, mainly, is The New Yorker. And, another is Mother Jones, too. Be sure to verify the 'news' they report using other sources. Same for New York Post, a Murdoch News rag in the subways of NY.
The NY Times ("News that's Fit to Print"-masthead motto) is a reliable news source, recognized by professors universally for graduate student work.
NBC was first to report the gunning down of Dillinger by FBI at the movie theater.
David Sarnoff ("General" Sarnoff) set the standard in the 20's for NBC and you can rely on them for accuracy.
CNN, is middy, must be watched for International news as best TV source, as from 1979 and Iran Hostage Crisis. But, check what they say against other sources, okay?
I've FoxNews with numerous lies, near-truths, half-truths, dubious sources, etc. And, definitely SLANTED pro-Republican in everything they say and do.
There are others, such as Washington Post, ABC News, CNN, Foreign Policy Journal, and, local papers, such as Denver Post, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, Boulder Daily Camera (they were deep inside the Ramsey case before all others), and more. But, learn to question, ok?
5 sources for accurate news I would recomend:	1) Reuters News	2) NBC (including MSNBC)	3) NYTimes	4) Associated Press	5) CBS News (since the days of Murrow they've been so good!)

The good news: Not once, in 238 years, has there been an instance of a presidential vote being overturned by the electoral college when they vote.
Interesting fact: Electors are not technically bound to vote the way their states vote. The final Electoral vote OFTEN varies from what the 'final tally' by networks is on election night.

Polls are PEOPLE SPEAKING out! If you don't understand that RIGHT under OUR Constitution, then, kindly BUGGER OFF! Leave US alone!
I am 'so sorry' if our polls on here 'aren't accurate" or "sincere". WE ARE People! Many don't understand that or, the difference, either. Nor, do they care. Some are trolls! So be it! The polls will continue!!!
I read "Tale of Two Cities" every year. I still get something new from it every time. Sign of a fabulous, immortal work!

Despite the fact he hasn't yet declared, Joe Biden is a factor in the 2020 race. His decision, according to MOST political scientists, pollsters, and, others, will help determine the race for the nomination and Presidency in 2020.
@pinata1138 Nevertheless, he is a factor as an ex-Vice President!
In this case, I think age is important as a factor. Average life span is 78 for females, 76 for males, (gulp) , so is age a factor? Should it be?
I never imagined age would enter into this, but, Bernie Sanders in 2020 will be 79, Joe Biden 78, Donald Trump 76, and the rest of the contenders, 65 or below.
Ok. I just have to speak up. I feel our Democratic Party is in trouble NOW, unless we get UNITED behind a candidate. By united I don't mean opposing the nominee after it's chosen, like in 2016. Ehem, Sandersites! Ehem!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Measles vaccine scare is similar to the cranberry scare, whipped up by rumor-mongers with nothing serious on their minds, but, who want to whip up trouble out of nothing.
Growing up, our town required Measles shots, and, eradicated it completely w/i a year. And, no Autism!
There is NO EVIDENCE that a Measles vaccine shot causes Autism. But it does stop Measles.
Measles is highly contagious and those without immunization (vaccine shot) can get it just by being in same room with an infected person  (classroom for ex.)

2/3 vote of both Senate and House Plus	3/4 approval of all state legislatures Plus	Signature of president to Ratify any amendment	Ave 14 years per amendment	17 passed since 1791.
Because the Electoral College is in the Constitution, it will require a Constitutional Amendment to change or dismiss it.

The Challenge from History for DumBp...Do what Santa Ana couldn't do, seize TX land. Ok? He can't, and. LBJ and others helped protect that!
History, TEXAS HISTORY since Bowie, the Alamo and Santa Ana, says the Feds can't do it!!! Period! I am for the TX property owners at the border all the way!!! ALL THE WAY!!
Privately-owned , for decades, or a century, land, seized by the 	Feds? Over night? Impossible. Courts, suits, most won by property owners in TX, too.
"Gonna build the wall!" Oh really?	Texas border land is all privately-owned land. Lawsuits galore and court for a decade if he attempts it in TX. Ain't gonna happen or it would've long before DumBp!

The FACT that Whitaker was EVER in Trump's government shows volumes about our CROOK President.
Let me tell you: Nixon is not my favorite, but, when he told off Hiss he was great!
Trump thinks that a LOT of us aren't educated, and, remember Alger Hiss or the snot he leveled! There is such a thing as DECORUM before Congress! Whitaker showed none!! I say Contempt of Congress on the Bum!
@funder @KrisMydler And, oh yes! Alger Hiss too! He tried to run his own hearing like Whattheshit did this morning.
@funder @KrisMydler US vs Alger Hiss
@funder @KrisMydler Sickening and not much different than Whittaker Chambers either.
@RawStory He'll be found "In Contempt of Congress". Just watch. The split second he leaves the Justice Dept, they will charge him.

@funder @KrisMydler I have news for #realdonaldtrump. Whitaker is NO Roy E Cohen!
@funder @KrisMydler UM, Yah! He  smirked, cajoled, abused, used shock and awe (he thinks), and harassed the members of that committee ("Your 5 minutes is up now") among being a PIG, also!
@4YrsToday He proved to me that Colorado (especially) and NV have better attorneys than IA! :B
@4YrsToday He is small fish. Just a marionette MORON!
@4YrsToday Nadler's eyebrows were down! Not good for Whatthefucker.
@4YrsToday But, will be cited in Contempt of Congress for his conduct today! His snottiness! His rudeness! His interrupting Congresspeople when they were mid-sentence. Directing the hearing. "Your 5 minutes are up!" Not acceptable!

@4YrsToday When we built our wall in 1965 in Ft Collins (Co State U) we included President Morgan's house. He didn't object! He opposed Vietnam, too! Great Man!
Jack Kingston is the proof. LOL

@4YrsToday DumBf has no clue!
@4YrsToday Another Human Wall was built in Boulder at U of Colorado same year, 1965!!! Closed that school for 5 days!
@4YrsToday Yes! I sure do! In 1965 during the 'call up' by LBJ, we built a Human Wall that CLOSED the CoLORADO State U campus for 5 days! He is a crap hound!!

And, he is thinking about running again? C'mon, man! We hardly need goons deciding a whole party's fate or blocking again this time. Thank you!
Some Sanders delegates were 'lobbying' Hillary delegates with threats outside the hall, too, blocking access to restrooms, and, other tactics. Later, I found out some of the Sanders delegates were homeless brought or trucked in from local parks and streets here. Great 'selection'
I was a delegate to the NV State Dem Convention in 2016. I witnessed Sanders goons try to rough up Senator Boxer (D-CA) when she spoke, and use other tactics that were dubious. The Chair and her staff had to leave the stage at one point. Nice! Really nice! WTG, Bernballs! WTG!

@AnnCaito1 Yes! Cannibis Rights. And, adoptions too.
@AnnCaito1 Boehner tours as a speaker for Adoptions now. He's happy, I bet, to be away from the sewer of DC
@AnnCaito1 It was Boehner, right? He would have had his golf buddy, Obama, wanted it. Very good friends outside the Capitol.

@AnnCaito1 You  can  almost hear the branch creaking and cracking now.
Schultz wouldn't have to win any states to wreck things, just win a percentage of the vote to take away votes from the Democrat or Republican to wreck things.
The Authors of the Constitution envisioned a two party system, not multi-party one.
Jean Stern, em, Stein.
Under the apportionment system, in 2016, Jean whatserface would have won electoral votes. So would the Workers Party (Communist)
The Constitution was written for a Two Party government, and so was the Electoral College created, too.
If only the two major party candidates votes count in the tally for Electoral votes, then apportionment by popular vote might work, but, if all candidates running on a state's ballot for president count, then chaos.

@Helenhs @SarahBCalif the Hill's article is incorrect. It's under consideration by CO legislature. Nothing passed yet. - Source: Denver Post as of 2-1-2019
@Helenhs @SarahBCalif Only way is by Constitutional Amendment! PERIOD!
My point is: The Constitution is not TISSUE PAPER! Okay??		It is changed by whim or by current cause like an entire feature should be changed because one candidate ran a better race for president and had a better strategy.
Question: When was the 'latest' or 27th Amendment ratified?		Answer: 1992		Get crackin!!!!
Constitution Facts:	Only 17 amendments have been passed since December, 1791, when the Bill of Rights was Ratified (First Ten Amendments.)	An average of 13.4 years to pass an Amendment.	2/3 of both Houses of Congress+3/4 of legislatures of all states+Signature of President=ratify
RT @4YrsToday: Is anyone right 100% of the time?
BTW, many CO legislators have residences also in Denver since they serve districts far from Denver. It's a large state, area wise.
Since 1791, the Electoral College has been winner of popular vote in a state takes all Electoral votes IF the electors vote that way in December after the election. Just because Maine (Collins' state :/ ) decided to alter it doesn't mean all states should.
Note: This is an editorial from Today's Denver Post, as in Denver, COLORADO. It implies no action by either chamber of the CO Legislature has happened on this, yet. It is under consideration.
