@tomsherwood @kojoshow @wcp one last note: everyone should watch the Zero Weeks documentary, and try telling the people in it that they are politicizing the issue https://t.co/gbmBLRz71Q
@tomsherwood @kojoshow @wcp it would be great for happy life events to not be "political," but when you are an elected official in a country where women are forced to go back to work before their bodies recover from childbirth, and non-birth parents can't stay home to bond with their babies, it's political.
@tomsherwood @kojoshow @wcp this results in 1 in 4 working moms, and a full 95% of dads, going back to work within TWO WEEKS of having a baby. what if your baby is premature? then you are stuck at work while your baby is fighting to survive in the NICU. this is UNTHINKABLE everywhere else in the world.
@tomsherwood @kojoshow @wcp the U.S. is the ONLY industrialized nation that doesn't provide paid family leave, and only 15% of workers have access to paid family leave thru their employers. a full 40% of workers can't even access UNPAID job-protected leave

Small biz DON'T provide paid leave @JackEvansWard2 bc they can't afford it, that's why they need an insurance model

Employer mandate doesn't cover small biz - tax credit won't begin to cover costs of #PaidLeave4DC

Great to see @DaOrganizer on @fox5dc about how #PaidLeave4DC will make our city stronger
.@MayorBowser supported $15 min wage which benefits MD and VA residents - why won't she support #PaidLeave4DC? @fox5dc
No way to fund #PaidLeave4DC like in other jurisdictions because of the commuter tax ban @fox5dc
Parents and kids benefit in the long term from #PaidLeave4DC @fox5dc
.@DaOrganizer on @fox5dc: DC needs to support its families and working people, #PaidLeave4DC is step in right direction
#PaidLeave4DC policy is "generous" compared to rest of US but let's not forget how far behind rest of world we are @fox5dc

...but this year my lucky few $s are going to @btselem @Give_Directly @miriamskitchen @DCAbortionFund :-)
to recap: i wish i had all of the money to give to all of the nonprofits that are doing amazing work in our city, country, and world...
also this: https://t.co/naT9dBYS5m there is no way around it, abortion restrictions kill women, affordable &amp; safe abortions save lives
.@DCAbortionFund gives support to these women, honors their personal decisions, and lets them do what is bets for their families
as a @DCAbortionFund volunteer case manager, I talk to women making incredibly personal decisions about their lives &amp; their families
local funds like @DCAbortionFund allow women to make the healthcare choices that are best for themselves &amp; their families
Hyde has killed women since 1978, who are forced to turn to back-alley abortions bc they can't afford safe ones https://t.co/Ysows4rW1o
Hyde prohibits fed funding for abortions, which effectively limits the constitutional right to access an abortion to those who can afford it
but even before these attacks, women's health care services have been separated out &amp; stigmatized by the Hyde amendment
abortion has come under attack nationwide, especially recently, through federal, state, and local efforts to deny women access to abortion
Finally, my monthly donation to @DCAbortionFund, which provides low-income women in the DC region access to abortions
‚ÄúOur goal is that we never have to do this again‚Äù - @jesserbnwtz from @miriamskitchen @ vigil to end homelessness https://t.co/9zbQHhDSXT
.@miriamskitchen recently helped organize a vigil for the 41 lives that were lost from homelessness this year
BUT since it's @jesserbnwtz's birthday my $ is going to @miriamskitchen which does amazing anti-hunger &amp; other work for the homeless
#3: there are so many great nonprofits doing anti-hunger work in DC - @foodbankmetrodc @dcck @DCHunger @BreadfortheCity @SOME_DC etc etc
everything that I could say about @Give_Directly has been said by the brilliant writers at @voxdotcom https://t.co/0MY8kFpX73
.@Give_Directly gives people the flexibility to spend money on what they actually need, without displacing local industries
I donated to @Give_Directly because there is simply no better way to help those in poverty by giving them what they need most - cash
great recent op-ed in ha'aretz by @btselem executive director https://t.co/aj4PWJDgno
if you believe in ending the occupation, it's even more important to support @btselem now with how much it has been under attack
great piece on @btselem's important work by Amos Oz https://t.co/hM47M60a0V
.@btselem does incredible work documenting the occupation in Palestinian territories to bring justice to both Israelis and Palestinians
this year's holiday/end-of-the year donations: @btselem, @Give_Directly, and @miriamskitchen (plus my monthly donation to @DCAbortionFund)
