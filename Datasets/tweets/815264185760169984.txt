@Pollsterking1 @JMilesColeman What is this lol. https://t.co/8yZIQWxODi
@DemocraticLuntz @JMilesColeman It’s beacuse the media wants to misrepresent our party by acting like Democratic Socialists comprise the majority of our members of Congress.
As Colin Peterson is defeated Ryan gives Josh Harder the Chairmanship of the House Agricultural Committee
@Kittenman234 DEM 228	GOP 207	Vacancies 0		GOP has a net gain of 7 in 2020, despite Democrats making some gains.
@Kittenman234 I did give them some pickups, let me calculate it real quick.
117th House Alternate (2021-2023)	Speaker, Tim Ryan (OH)	Majority Leader, Jim Clyburn (SC)	Majority Whip, Hakeem Jeffries (NY)	Minority Leader, K. McCarthy (CA)	Minority Whip, S. Scalise (LA) https://t.co/CCvC5dc53h
Districts would take effect in 2022 election.
Last map for today, kind of an alternate history. Sean Duffy’s Seat gets made into a Tossup and he just retires.
2022 Delegation		1 (R+5) Bryan Steil (R)	2 (D+23) Mark Pocan (D)	3 (D+7) Ron Kind (D) (retiring to run for Senate)	4 (D+22) Gwen Moore (D)	5 (R+10) Duey Stroebel (R)	6 (R+5) Leah Vukmir (R)	7 (D+1) Sean Duffy (R) (retiring)	8 (R+1) Mike Gallagher (R)	@SenhorRaposa https://t.co/wn7ZiBzu7a
@icowrich @SenhorRaposa @Kittenman234 The guy who made the redistricting software I guess
@alexbaker19
@AlexBaker19		I fixed the PVIs
Fixed Utah Figures PVI	Difference/2		UT-1 (R+23)	UT-2 (R+32)	UT-3 (R+24)	UT-4 (R+3)
New Montana figures if you find the difference and divide by 2		MT-1 (R+5)	MT-2 (R+13)
@AlexBaker19 I’ll fix it rn
@AlexBaker19 Alright
@BroAJK @SenhorRaposa @Kittenman234 Yeah that map is realistic and would work well, I make realistic ones with DRA, but these are basically jokes.
@DemocraticLuntz @SenhorRaposa @Kittenman234 No, like I have access, I just don’t have my laptop with me right now lol
PVI Calculated by taking total district vote share and finding the difference.
Vote share was used from 2018 senate data.
These maps aren’t population proportional because I don’t have access to Daves’ Redistricting. But here are some fun hypothetical 2022 maps. @SenhorRaposa @Kittenman234 		MT-1 (R+10)	MT-2 (R+26)		UT-1 (R+46)	UT-2 (R+64)	UT-3 (R+48)	UT-4 (R+6) https://t.co/rQEjnfCoLy

@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman I mean if Pearce wasn’t an idiot he would’ve stayed in the House and probably won his district by 7% but he just had to run for statewide office and lose for the 3rd time.
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman Wow interesting, if he won it 53-46% and Torres-Small won 50.7-49.3% that’s a lot of voters who voted Heinrich/Pearce/Small
@SenhorRaposa @JMilesColeman Thanks.
