@Robafar thanks for the follow
#s188, or the #EGOAct, recently became law. It bans the use of federal funds on oil painted portraits of #politicians. We talk about some #ushistory and give our two cents on this new law.	https://t.co/AjTS7KW7k0
#hr2730 would end some #government #subsidies on #tobacco. Introduced by @RepRussell back in June 2017. We think it's a good idea. Wish this got more attention.	https://t.co/AkXdYbILyp
Good evening everyone. Due to some logistical difficulties our normal Friday morning episode will release late Friday/early Saturday. #thanksforlistening #symwyp
#sunshineprotectionact was signed into Florida law. But this #daylightsavings time law doesn't do anything unless #hr5279 is passed in federal #congress.	https://t.co/XrDMMKlmNX
#hr4909 would offer more grant money to more schools for security. Seems legit. Maybe it doesn't go far enough, but it's something.	https://t.co/1PeOyWn8Ec

@funlibertarian2 I think that mental health is the root of this problem. That doesn't mean I'm disagreeing with gun reform or regulation.		1) Funding for public schools to have a trained clinical psychologist. (Could be better than more armed security.)	2) Incentives for private schools to do (1)
#hr4996 would revoke the citizenship of an immigrant that commits a nonviolent drug offense. https://t.co/RLWmZXOpgr

@livefree523 I may disagree that television and internet content would cause or even increase the likelihood of gun violence, but, after reading through these replies, I'm glad that you're aiming for a discussion instead of spamming your opinion on Twitter.
@RubinReport Welcome to Florida, good sir. Hope you enjoy our citrus and alligators. That’s all we got really. Maybe some meth, depending on who you ask.
@SallyMayweather To be fair, the President doesn’t really control spending. That’s Congress. The President can spend less than whatever Congress appropriates but not more. So if spending has gone up, then that’s really more on Congress.
