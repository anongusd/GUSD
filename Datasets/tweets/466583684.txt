@RepJimBanks The world won't be here if you keep listening to Republican politics. Can't feed the world if it's destroyed.

@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @ChrisCuomo You're starting to lose me @ChrisCuomo . In your efforts to keep things right down the middle, you've been reaching right. Don't give them ammunition...they don't deserve it. The President is deliberately weakening our country and Putin is benefiting from it. Not only political!
