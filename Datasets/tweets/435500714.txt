#EqualPay for equal work is more than just basic fairness, it will also reduce the financial strain many families are currently facing.
American women make up 1/2 our labor force &amp; are the primary or co-breadwinners in 6 out of 10 households. #EqualPay cannot wait.
Working mothers in DE contribute, on avg, 42% of family income. They deserve #EqualPay to provide for their families.
Each week, a man w/a median salary in DE makes $865, while a woman of a median salary makes only $731. It’s time for #EqualPay
In 2012, it’s shocking that women still only make 77 cents to every $1 men make. We must continue to fight for #EqualPay
