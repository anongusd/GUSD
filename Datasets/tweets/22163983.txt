@PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs @TVietor08 @AlyssaMastro44 Has Jim Jordan ever worn a coat? Ever? Also, what's the most impactful thing that's come out of the testimony so far?
I'm pretty sure Chip Roy missed Valentine's Day with his wife this year, and it's still impacting him.
Mark Meadows' Adderall hasn't worn off.
Jim Jordan ate a live chicken during that break.
I'm really looking forward to the part where Democrats ask questions.
Pretty sure Jim Jordan hasn't worn a coat in his entire life
Mark Meadows has been politely waiting his turn by quietly crushing Adderall in the corner.
Glad the Republicans are getting to the heart of what this hearing is about: Michael Cohen’s personal finances.
Half of the followers on @WomenForCohen are men. Do your goddamn research, Jim Jordan.
To think, the Bills Mafia could've been an actual mafia.
Jim Jordan auditioning to be the Info Wars fill-in host
Mark Meadows ensuring we're off to a smooth, non-partisan start.
Matt Gaetz is what happens if the douchiest frat guy you ever met had a baby with the most obnoxious Twitter troll on the internet and they decided to feed it beer until it was old enough to vote.

Well done, @NYDailyNews. Well done. https://t.co/oi1qqzwhTh
@peanuttom Right, but the key is the leverage this can give Mueller over Cohen (since Cohen probably knows a lot about Russia situation).
It should be worth noting Stormy Daniels says she spanked Donald Trump. I get a feeling that's only a sprinkle of all the golden showers about to rain down. 10/That's all for now
c) Speaking of Trump and Russia, Bob Mueller can and may very well use this information against Trump or his lawyer, Michael Cohen as leverage into the collusion/obstruction/everything case. 9/A lot of things
b) It may provide an insight into the corruption and collusion between Trump and Russia. 8/A lot
a) His lawyer paying somebody off and exceeding campaign finance limits a few days before an election. 7/A lot
Why is this significant besides shining more light into why the POTUS is a complete bag of dicks? Several things... 6/A lot
The parking lot threat was in 2011. That's back when Trump was a reality star and professional douche bag -- not a presidential candidate. He was probably worried about Melania finding out. Whatever it was, he knew what he was doing and probably had done it before. 5/A lot
In the post-interview part on 60 Minutes, Anderson Cooper ends his interview saying he basically knows this tactic has been used before with Trump and victims. 4/A lot
Stormy Daniels being threatened in a parking lot may very well be the biggest takeaway of this interview. 3/A lot
Fake Stormy Daniels is being texted by Fake Vladimir Putin. 2/A lot https://t.co/Lbfl3qwK52
