"...And when the farmer stops farming who will suffer?  Ultimately those same local communities who no longer have an economic base.  Or the jobs they bring.  Or food to eat."  - Dr. Howard Hill, NPPC Past President
"For decades, as families left farming to pursue other economic opportunities, the U.S. has relied on right-to-farm laws to ensure farmers could farm without fear of litigation over the natural noises &amp; smells created by raising the livestock that feed our nation." -Dr. Hill
"One thing I‚Äôve seen is that farmers ‚Äì in North Carolina or in Iowa or anywhere ‚Äì have the same outlook &amp; dedication to the improvement of their farms &amp; the well-being of their rural communities. At the heart of this is a desire to be good and responsible neighbors." -Dr. Hill
"Pork producers have a long and proud history of working hard to improve their farms by addressing the concerns of neighbors and being among the most supportive of regulations, policies &amp; programs that both protect the environment..." -NPPC Past President, Dr. Howard Hill

@ruthreichl @TedGenoways ‚ÄúThe presidents of the 14 food boards signed a letter to Congress requesting the exemption.‚Äù NPPC is not checkoff.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways ‚ÄúFood-safety advocates are outraged‚Äù? Limited FOIA exemption has nothing to do with food safety.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Supreme Court case about checkoff funds used for promotion of commodities, which IS compelled by federal law.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Any communication between checkoff boards and USDA still would be subject to FOIA.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways FOIA exemption limited, not ‚Äúsweeping.‚Äù Most checkoff board activity covered; some internal communications exempt.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Limited FOIA exemption would have NO effect on identifying, preventing practices that could jeopardize food safety.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Issue doesn‚Äôt affect ‚Äútransparency about how food is produced.‚Äù Food makers aren‚Äôt now, never were subject to FOIA.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Issue nothing to do with ‚Äúpublic‚Äôs right to know how its tax dollars are being spent.‚Äù Checkoffs get no tax money.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Limited FOIA exemption is for checkoff boards, not for ‚Äúfood manufacturers,‚Äù which are private entities.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways House Ag Appropriations bill has report language on limited FOIA exemption; language doesn‚Äôt have force of law.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways Checkoff boards‚Äô funds aren‚Äôt ‚Äútax dollars.‚Äù They‚Äôre funds from farmers, for farmers to promote their products.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways It doesn‚Äôt receive ‚Äúfederal funding.‚Äù It gets money only from egg producers; money used to help those producers.
@ruthreichl @TedGenoways American Egg Board isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgovernment-funded group.‚Äù (Neither are other commodity checkoff boards.)

Each additional 1% of U.S. pork production that is exported, live hog prices increase by approximately $3 per hog #TPP
If we do turn our backs on that region, some other country will write the rules for global trade #TPP
We cannot afford either economically or geopolitically to walk away from the fastest growing region in the world #TPP

@sujitsuchindran But we do use antibiotics prophylactically in people -- before many types of surgeries.

@drshow Would have been a waste of time having to refute all the lies from Shapiro.
@dianerehmshow Putting 8 hens in a cage does NOT equate with cock fighting. Typical HSUS bait and switch argument.
@dianerehmshow Enough egg, sure. But at what price? That's the point. HSUS wants to drive up prices of eggs, meat so fewer can afford them.
@dianerehmshow HSUS, which spent millions to get N.J. gestation stall ban, wants to tell hog farmers how to raise and care for their pigs.
@dianerehmshow HSUS's Paul Shapiro not telling the truth about effects of eating meat.
@dianerehmshow California egg law had NOTHING to do with food safety. "Cage free" eggs, in fact, are more susceptible to Salmonella.
@dianerehmshow California egg prices are up significantly -- just what HSUS wants. Higher prices mean less consumption. That's the goal.
@dianerehmshow State AGs' suit against California egg law was dismissed because it wasn't "ripe" at the time. It is now.

The #TPP solution is simple: #Japan must be held to the same high standard as other U.S. FTA partners. The ball is in Japan‚Äôs court.
#TPP: The tail is wagging the dog in #Japan. A protectionist group of farmers is holding hostage a 12-nation regional trade negotiation.
The U.S. trade policy metric that has governed all past U.S. FTAs must continue to govern #TPP negotiations: elimination of tariffs. #Japan
#TPP: When the impact on all the ‚Äúsacred‚Äù ag products is added-both in Japan and in future FTAs-the loss of US exports &amp; jobs is staggering.
#TPP, as with other FTAs, should not be about whether to move to #freetrade in virtually all products but how &amp; when. http://t.co/VZdbwZq6WO
#TPP: Japanese farmers disregard global security implications of adding 3 billion people to the world in 30 yrs. http://t.co/VZdbwZq6WO
Agreeing to #Japan‚Äôs #TPP demands will signal the EU that the same US products can be exempt from full tariff liberalization in #TTIP.
#Pork never has been excluded from tariff elimination in a U.S. free trade agreement. http://t.co/VZdbwZq6WO #Japan #TPP
#TPP: Exemptions from tariff elimination demanded by #Japan would be more than all tariff line exemptions in the past 17 U.S. FTAs combined.
Agreeing to #Japan‚Äôs #TPP ag demands is a departure from past US trade policy - that FTAs must cover virtually all trade b/n parties.

#ProTip: if your members are flying into Washington for lobbying, it shouldn't be when Congress (and most staff) are out of town.
With a strategy of holding its annual lobbying day when Congress is in recess, it's no wonder HSUS‚Äôs attempts to pass the Egg Bill failed.
If lobbying during congressional recess is "pretty sophisticated politically," the rest of us must be pretty unsophisticated.
HSUS holds lobbying day ... when Congress is in recess.
