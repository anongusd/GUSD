As communities see the negative impact of ICE's expansion, efforts to strategically organize and mobilize voters offer key lessons on how cities and counties can provide a new pathway for progressive, pro-immigrant policies, such as the disentanglement of ICE-local policing.
In recent weeks, ICE has retaliated against communities in North Carolina who fought to end local cooperation with ICE. https://t.co/mvnMZYwT3E
But even with these local, progressive wins, much more work is still needed to combat ICE's continued efforts to retaliate against communities that have limited their cooperation in federal immigration enforcement.
As a result of the 2018 elections, we are seeing significant changes in how ICE operates in local communities - from ending participation in the 287(g) program to revisiting jail policies - which offers a new vision for immigration enforcement at the local level.
In California, LA County voters removed Sheriff Jim McDonnell and elected Alex Villanueva, who vowed to get rid of ICE's access to county jails. Villanueva became the first challenger in more than 100 years to unseat an incumbent sheriff in the county.
In Anne Arundel County, Maryland, Steuart Pittman upset the incumbent county executive who defended participation in the 287(g) program, which deputizes local law enforcement as federal immigration agents. Pittman ended 287(g) days after taking office. https://t.co/u6U6W1YZWo
In Hennepin County, Minnesota, longtime incumbent Sheriff Rich Stanek was defeated by Dave "Hutch" Hutchinson who vowed to end local cooperation with ICE. Sheriff Hutchinson plans to end jail practices that facilitate the transfer of immigrants to ICE. https://t.co/lG3Zkgp9yo
In North Carolina, voters elected candidates who opposed the use of local resources for federal immigration enforcement purposes. After 2018 elections, Mecklenburg &amp; Wake counties have ended 287(g) agreements &amp; Durham County no longer honors ICE detainers. https://t.co/PfRo3zHUeH

RT @pwolgin: NEW important read from @TomJawetz &amp; @scottshuchart: Language Access Has Life-or-Death Consequences for Migrants.		https://t.c‚Ä¶
Many migrants arriving on the southern border have already experienced extreme hardship. That suffering should not continue in the US due to language access issues. CBP must do better and DHS must be held accountable for the well-being of migrants. https://t.co/CkQJXMny44
Jakelin and Felipe should never have died. In order to prevent similar tragedies, CBP must: 		1‚É£proactively assess migrants‚Äô language needs &amp; not assume they speak Spanish 	2‚É£conduct medical screenings on all migrants	3‚É£increase translation capabilities for indigenous languages
Speakers of indigenous languages fared even worse according to the survey, as they reported receiving medical care in US custody at just 2/3 the already low rate of other migrants. Via @CMSnewyork
The lack of language access compounds the existing medical issues faced by migrants: according to a @CMSnewyork survey, more than 33% of recently deported migrants who requested medical care were denied. https://t.co/gEfyXIpM3o
This lack of adequate language access likely limited the ability of both children‚Äôs fathers to communicate about their needs and to understand what was happening. Their well-being was jeopardized by poor medical attention and linguistic support.
While many migrants crossing the southern border speak Spanish, a proportion speak only or predominantly indigenous languages. Jakelin and Felipe were both of Maya backgrounds ‚Äì Jakelin‚Äôs family speaks K‚Äôiche‚Äô, and Felipe‚Äôs family speaks Chuj #JusticeForJakelin #JusticeForFelipe
What is language access? Under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and subsequent executive orders, federal agencies must provide language support to non-English speakers. But CBP has struggled to do this, in particular for people who speak indigenous languages.
üö® NEW! üö®Last December Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe G√≥mez Alonzo, 8, died in @CBP custody. In a new @amprog report, @TomJawetz and @scottshuchart explain how CBP‚Äôs inadequate medical care + language access issues led to these tragedies. https://t.co/CkQJXMny44

For *decades* the US has provided #TPS to individuals unable to return to severely unsafe conditions. They've created lives in the US, started families and businesses, contributed to the local and national economy, and so much more.
Not only this, but about ‚Öì  of households with a #TPS beneficiary have a mortgage. Imagine the major impact housing markets would face should TPS holders be forced to leave, some defaulting on their mortgages.
TPS holders help our economy! 246K #TPS holders are working across the country ‚Äî the greatest numbers in building maintenance and construction occupations. Households w/ TPS contribute $2.3B in federal taxes and $1.3B in state and local taxes EVERY YEAR. https://t.co/fcOXWtMUvA
.@notgonnaleila and @NSvajlenka created a factsheet highlighting the harmful effects that ending #TPS could have on TPS holders‚Äô children specifically &amp; outlines 3 scenarios that could play out should the courts side with the Trump admin. More info here: https://t.co/tqxUL5SQcQ
Approx. 620K individuals live in a household with a family member that #TPS protects, including 448K US citizens, 279K of whom are US-citizen children under the age of 18.
#TPS holders live across the country. Salvadoran, Honduran, and Haitian TPS holders are deeply embedded community members. On average they‚Äôve lived in the United States for 22 years, 23 years, and 17 years, respectively. https://t.co/z0LDOoEUUx
The Trump admin has moved to end #TPS for 6/10 countries-nearly 98% of the nearly 318,000 individuals who currently have TPS. Fortunately, a CA district court issued a preliminary injunction, leaving the designations for Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador in place for now.
üö® Ahead of the #TPSPeoplesSummit tomorrow, @NSvajlenka‚Äôs newest column tells us what we need to know about #TPS holders as the Trump admin continues to try and dismantle the program. Via @amprog https://t.co/UHwzNDDUTy

Hateful posts towards the Myanmar Muslim community in 2017 lead to ‚Äúa textbook example of ethnic cleansing.‚Äù Misinformation spread on social media can negatively affect the perception of a specific group, leading to tensions and civil unrest.
Images and posts like these are the reasons why groups like ‚ÄúTijuana against the migrant caravan‚Äù popped up on Facebook, anti-immigrant rallies were organized, caravan members were called ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù, and violence broke out.
After the caravan arrived in Mexico a graphic image of a beaten police officer went viral along w/ the text,‚ÄúBrutally beaten by the members of the caravan in their attempt to force their entry into Mexico."But the photo was actually taken in 2012. https://t.co/hNAcaYd0pn

A new course is possible with a new Congress, and we are hopeful that congressional leaders will embrace a progressive approach and put an end to @POTUS‚Äô cruel and misguided immigration policies. Read more about @CAPimmigration's priorities here üëâ https://t.co/S2kqRidGXu
We can and should have a functioning immigration system that is fair and compassionate, that allows #KeepingFamiliesTogether, that meets industry needs while protecting workers' rights and promoting entrepreneurship and integration of new Americans.
While "all too often, the immigration debate is presented as a false choice btw the U.S. being either a nation of laws or a nation of immigrants, [these] ideals are not irreconcilable and are, in fact, mutually supportive of one another" argues @TomJawetz https://t.co/jHUhbxVLAW
In addition to exposing and fighting back against the abuses of the #Trump administration, the #116Congress will have an opportunity to lay a positive, progressive vision for #immigration policy that restores the rule of law in our immigration system.
As a majority of Americans agree, it is time for Congress to also enact permanent protections for #Dreamers and #TPS holders, ensuring that roughly one million people living and working lawfully are not opened to the possibility of detention and deportation.
Congress also must demand transparency and hold @DHSgov accountable over the tragic deaths of children like 7-year-old Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin &amp; 8-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gomez from Guatemala who died while in @CBP custody. #JusticeforFelipe #JusticeforJakelin
Congress must promptly investigate matters relating to family separation, the detention of record numbers of unaccompanied children for prolonged periods of time, the Muslim ban, the decision to end #TPS and #DACA, and the politicization of U.S. #immigration courts...
While the last Congress demonstrated no appetite for meaningful oversight, every committee and subcommittee in the new Congress can play the check-and-balance function, and put an end to @POTUS‚Äôs rampant abuse of the system.
As @HouseDemocrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in 8 years, they should:	‚úÖProvide much needed oversight	‚úÖPass legislation to protect vulnerable individuals	‚úÖLay the foundations for a progressive vision for immigration policy

In response to the most recent Central American caravan, Mexico announced plan, Estas en tu Casa (You are Home). According to Mexican authorities, more than 3,800 migrants have applied for asylum, while thousands more have chosen to seek asylum in the U.S.
Worsening conditions and violence in the Northern Triangle has led to an increase in asylum applications ‚Äì 14,596 people applied for asylum in Mexico in 2017, a 66% increase from 2016 ‚Äì placing a strain on the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance. https://t.co/GmPvsbQnqF
Because of this, non-profit organizations in Mexico picked up much of the slack, providing job training, mental health services, help obtaining identification documents and enrolling in mentoring programs.
Immigration enforcement in the U.S. has led to the deportation and return of almost a MILLION Mexican migrants. While Mexico has made efforts to ease the transition of return migrants, programs like Somos Mexicanos (We are Mexican) often fall short.

‚ÄúWe want to be successful citizens,‚Äù shares Luma, an Iraqi refugee. Recent arrivals engage in a variety of activities to improve their work and language skills and are eager to give back to a community they now call home.
Najah, a refugee from Ninevah, Iraq, notes that working was the most important activity she did when she first arrived. In fact, 67% of recent arrivals between 16 and 64 are in the labor force according to a survey of refugees.
‚ÄúWe started our lives here form zero,‚Äù recalls Mohammed, an Iraqi refugee. While resettling in a new place is challenging, once refugees resettle they adjust to different cultures and establish new lives, all while bringing cultural diversity to their communities.

This comes only a year after the Trump administration took only 22,500 refugees, HALF of the targeted 45,000 set for this year.

Vitiello: I'll get you those answers by the end of the day. 		How can the nominee to lead ICE not know basic questions on how many pregnant women are detained and the policy for their detainment? #VoteNoVitiello
.@SenKamalaHarris asks Vitiello, "Since ICE issued directive of last year how many pregnant women have been detained by ICE custody? How many pregnant women are currently detained? What's the break down by trimester and what's the policy for women in their third trimester?"
Advocates strongly recommend that the Senate rejects the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to head up @ICEgov. At @CBP, Vitiello was one of the chief architects behind separating safety-seeking families. He needs to be held accountable‚Äînot promoted. #VoteNoVitiello
.@SenGaryPeters presses Vitiello on the binary choice of #familyseparation and reminds him that the answer to family separation is NOT family detention. He follows up by asking how long he thinks children should be detained.
The new head of @ICEgov should be decent, unbiased, and fair. Not being able to answer this basic question about toning down the anit-immigrant rhetoric is troubling enough. Today, the Senate should unequivocally reject Vitiello‚Äôs nomination. #VoteNoVitiello
Vitiello's answer, "I will work with this committee." @SenDougJones is troubled by his response and tells him to work with the administration, not the committee.
.@SenDougJones is asking Vitiello a follow-up question to @SenKamalaHarris's question on the perception of immigration. He wants to know if Vitiello will help tone down the hateful rhetoric on immigrants in the US, and cites the recent shooting at a synagogue. #LoveTrumpHates
.@SenRonJohnson goes on to explain numbers on border crossings, but @SenatorHassan shuts him down by saying: "We do not need to separate or detain children in order to be secured." #StopFamilyDetention #StopFamilySeparation
.@SenatorHassan asked about ICE's targeting of immigrants at immigration hearings and is now asking about the American Academy of Pediatrics' report on the harms of detaining children. Vitiello's response: parents shouldn't cross the border with their children.

Rapid demographic shifts can unsettle rural communities, stoking xenophobic sentiments and polarizing dialogue around immigration and refugee resettlement. 		Places that learn to accept newcomers have benefited from growth, business development, and renewed vibrancy.
Lexington and Madison, two Nebraskan cities, led initiatives to successfully integrate students in local schools; the establishment of flourishing immigrant-owned businesses; and a sustained sense of community and tradition.
At a time when NE was going through economic and demographic stagnation, the arrival of immigrants from Latin America and refugees from Asian and African countries reversed some of the stagnation and led the way for cities to be more welcoming.

With the continued uncertainty around the #DACA program and the relentless attempts to end the program, Dreamers and allies should visit https://t.co/qrvd1FalMp to get info on how to renew their DACA and to donate for renewal funds!
The consequences of ending #DACA affect the whole country. The 10 plaintiff states stand to lose nearly $7.4 billion in annual GDP + $311 million in tax revenue. And the 40 remaining states would lose an estimated $35 billion in annual GDP. üí∞¬†https://t.co/DQYLYx6T9n
The consequences of ending #DACA are severe. Recipients would lose both protection from deportation and the ability to legally work. Their ability to enroll in higher ed classes could be impacted, and they might not be able to drive in many states. https://t.co/I9cvbpELYc
#DACA is a program that works and has allowed over 800,000 recipients to live their lives by being able to work, go to school, drive, etc. without the fear of being deported. For many, DACA opened the doors to opportunities they didn‚Äôt even know they had. https://t.co/dLvJS08lET
SCOTUS denied an earlier attempt by the Trump Administration to skip the appellate level and go straight to SCOTUS, yet here we are - AGAIN! Not to mention that three courts have already ruled on #DACA and have ordered the continuation of the program. üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
Prior to this announcement, we were waiting on the 9th Circuit Court to issue their ruling. By filing Cert, the DOJ is trying to bypass the 9th Circuit Court (and the courts in the other DACA cases) and asking #SCOTUS to take up the case as early as January 2019. üóìÔ∏è
üö® #DACA ALERT! üö® 		DOJ just filed Cert in the DACA case. This is yet another attempt by the Trump Administration to end DACA by any means necessary, and an effort to rip protections away from hundreds of thousands of Dreamers - this time on the eve of the #MidtermElections.

@DHSgov &amp; @HHSgov should immediately withdraw their proposed rule given the harms it would cause children, families, and LGBT individuals in detention, as well as the high costs associated with the rule.
In addition to the harms from the proposed rule, @amprog‚Äôs comment details the astronomically high costs associated with it. Using the government's own data, CAP estimates that over a decade, the rule could cost as much as $12.9 billion. üí∏¬†https://t.co/Dof3tcNG16
.@TomWongPhD also debunked the administration‚Äôs claims that family separation and family detention have effectively deterred families from coming. https://t.co/W0DNlfEsc3
The administration believes the prolonged detention of children in unlicensed, secure facilities--prohibited for years by the Flores settlement--will deter families from coming to request protection. But @TomWongPhD already debunked this claim. https://t.co/cYXNZoOW9X
The proposal also harms one of the most vulnerable populations in detention: #LGBT individuals. Using ICE‚Äôs own data, @LGBTProgress found that LGBT ppl in ICE custody are 97 times more likely to be sexually victimized than non-LGBT ppl in detention. https://t.co/YqHFhQPtq9

Young voters have the ability to represent the interests of Dreamers at the polls. Their turnout could help shape a progressive immigration agenda that could #ProtectDreamers once and for all.  https://t.co/0bXiTzzj2a
Young people, exercising their privilege to vote, can be powerful advocates for Dreamers at the polls. Among the top 10 states where young people can have a huge effect if they vote in solidarity with Dreamers are states like Nevada and Georgia. Look at the ratios here: https://t.co/icmFzTvBRz
Young voters can be the strongest supporters of the undocumented community in the midterm elections. And while they are often criticized for low turnout, young voters have a great ability to organize. Just look at the #BLM movement and @UNITEDWEDREAM's #HereToStay movement.
Young voters represent the demographic future of this country. We found that Millennials and Gen Z are more racially and ethnically diverse, hold more progressive views than older generations on LGBTQ rights, gun violence prevention, repro rights, and college affordability.
We partnered with @genprogress and found that 70 million young people - under the age of 36 - are potentially eligible to vote this year! That‚Äôs more eligible voters than any other generation.
In states across the country, young voters have the opportunity to represent #Dreamers at the polls and have a major impact on this year's midterm elections. https://t.co/0bXiTzzj2a

The harm to children and parents, the high cost of new jails and detention beds, and for what? Contrary to what the administration claims, neither family detention nor family separation deter people from coming. @TomWongPhD debunked this claim. https://t.co/cBwSqa0vX6
The cost of the administration‚Äôs proposed regulation is preposterous but what‚Äôs even more unjustifiable is the irreversible harm that detention - for any period of time - does to children‚Äôs mental and physical well-being. @CAPEarlyEd found the following. https://t.co/5f3ZSA8os9
Side note: these costs DON‚ÄôT include the high costs that would likely flow to @HHSgov‚Äôs Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with the care and custody of unaccompanied children. Here again, the administration made no effort at all to calculate these costs.
These high costs come from:	1‚É£ The significant number of add'l family detention beds DHS will need as it ramps up family incarceration (current bed capacity is 3,326 - for perspective)	2‚É£ Start-up costs to obtain add'l family residential centers in order to jail these families
Using the govt's own data, @amprog estimates that, over a decade, the proposed rule to indefinitely detain children and families would cost @dhsgov (through taxpayers) over $2 billion at the low end, and as much as $12.9 billion at the high end. #StopFamilyDetention
When @DHSgov published a proposed rule to allow the indefinite detention of children and families it ignored its *obligation* to calculate how much the rule would cost. @pwolgin at @amprog crunched the numbers for them and it is EXPENSIVE as it is harmful. https://t.co/5S1dHyKLkq

The proposed rule to change the Flores Settlement is awful in itself, but even more egregious given the evidence on the harms of family detention - not only for children but for parents as well. #StopFamilyDetention https://t.co/5f3ZSA8os9
This isn‚Äôt the first time @TomWongPhD has debunked a claim from this administration. Remember when they claimed that #familyseparation is a deterrent? An earlier analysis shows that it isn‚Äôt. https://t.co/W0DNlfEsc3
However, there is NO evidence to prove this. Interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) found that there is no statistically significant increase in apprehensions of families at the border after the ruling. https://t.co/obhSIjWDqB
This claim is one of the key rationales underlying the administration's attempt to dissolve the Flores settlement through regulations, and allow them to incarcerate children with their parents indefinitely.
In its proposed rule to dissolve the Flores Settlement Agreement, the administration has argued the 2015 court ruling-which confirmed the government could not hold children in unlicensed family detention facilities for &gt;20 days-increased the arrivals of families at the border.

Many professions in the US require a license to participate in their industry. After #DACA, several states extended some or all professional license to people who have work authorization, including DACA recipients. These jobs range from landscapers to stylists to lawyers.
#DACA has provided opportunities for recipients to pursue higher education. Tuition equity laws and policies vary across states so the termination of the program would affect DACA recipients differently depending on where they live.
Driver‚Äôs licenses and IDs allow recipients to identify themselves. Without a proper ID it will be difficult for them to open a bank account, pick up prescriptions, rent an apartment or even cash a check. An identification card allows recipients to carry out day-to-day activities.
A new survey showed that after receiving DACA nearly 78% of recipients got their *first* driver‚Äôs license - a life-changing moment for recipients. Yet only 12 states extend driving privileges to all of their residents regardless of immigration status. https://t.co/jHHZs6618V
States can and should do more to provide #DACA recipients, many of whom have lived nearly all of their lives in the US, access to basic rights until Congress passes a permanent solution that includes a pathway to citizenship.
Nevertheless, by acting now states can help DACA recipients retain access to driver‚Äôs licenses, affordable higher education, and professional and occupational licenses even if DACA were to be terminated in the future.
Losing #DACA would have significant consequences for current recipients who can now get driver‚Äôs licenses in all states and in-state tuition, state financial aid, and occupational licenses in a number of states.
DACA has not only given more than 800,000 young eligible people a temporary reprieve from deportation, it has also given them access to basic freedoms: work permits, driver‚Äôs licenses, higher education, and in certain states, professional licenses.
Although renewals continue to be processed, the fate of DACA is still unclear. DACA recipients stand to lose a great deal if DACA ends, but states still can ease the blow. Read the latest from @silvamathema via @amprog. #DefendDACA https://t.co/xnr1yw7ZBB

Despite an overwhelming majority of Americans supporting legal protections for #Dreamers, Congress has refused to act leaving the lives of the nearly 800,000 protected in limbo.
With #DACA 62% of respondents reported purchasing their first car, 14%  purchased their first home. These purchases mean increased job creation and new spending in local economies. #DACAWorks

One thing is clear!‚òùüèæ Successfully integrating immigrants into America‚Äôs rural communities can bring big dividends and rural places can show us the path forward on how best to overcome conflict around demographic change. https://t.co/BV53BTzY11
Integration policies in the US are often localized. Some communities have proactive plans in place to integrate newcomers that allow them to capture the full set of benefits that having a thriving, strong community brings while other communities initially struggle.
The report looks at 2,765 rural places and found that immigrants are leaving a positive mark in rural communities. Immigrants and their families often bring vitality to these places and provide an indispensable workforce to support local communities economies.
The report looks at 2,765 rural places and found that immigrants are often reversing or mitigating rural population decline. In 78% of places experiencing population decline, without immigrants, the population in these places would have contracted by 30%. üìâ
Often the narrative around immigration in rural communities is one of backlash and conflict, but the reality is that there are a significant number of rural communities across the country that have seen the positive outcomes of immigrants in their community. üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß

Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina, and West Virginia should reconsider the negative consequences of their efforts to terminate #DACA on their respective states and drop their challenge immediately. https://t.co/EwkTwHBY7m
Despite its unarguable success, and support for the program by the American public, the Trump administration and several states have made it abundantly clear that they will not stop until #DACA is terminated.
Research has consistently shown that #DACAworks! The latest DACA survey revealed that recipients are working, enrolled in school, civically engaged, and unfortunately, extremely worried about the future of the program. https://t.co/8rhWza3Zqf
If Texas gets its way and DACA were to end it would be a huge loss for *all 50 states*. Terminating DACA would reduce state and local revenues by almost $700 million across all 50 states. These 10 states are harming the rest of the country with their effort to terminate DACA.
The 10 plaintiff states stand to lose the following if they win their lawsuit:	‚ùå¬†$7.4 BILLION loss in annual GDP	‚ùå $311 MILLION loss in tax revenue		These type of losses can be catastrophic to states the relay on the funds DACA recipients bring in.

DACA remains under attack w/ Texas &amp; 9 other states leading a lawsuit to try &amp; end the program. Judge Hanen, same judge who prevented the expansion of DACA &amp; implementation of DAPA in `15, had a hearing on 8/8 where the plaintiff states argued that DACA was a drain to the state.

Despite going on the record and saying the family separation policy implemented by the Trump administration and officials was cruel and plain out wrong, all of the Republican committee members voted in favor of advancing Kraninger's nomination. Over 500 children remain separated.
All Republicans voted in favor of Kathy Kraninger's nomination to direct @CFPB while all Democrats voted against her nomination - 13 in favor, 12 opposed. The nominations will now go to the Senate floor.
Roll call vote for Kathy Kraninger to direct @CFPB for 5 years is underway.
.@SenSherrodBrown read quotes from colleagues on the committee regarding family separation. All quotes show that opposition to family separation is bipartisan. Senator Brown urges his colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Kathy Kraninger, who oversaw the implementation.

USCIS is currently still accepting #DACArenewals. Recipients are encouraged to submit their renewal application if they‚Äôre able to! More info on renewals can be found on @UnitedWeDream‚Äôs website and at https://t.co/0BnHYrrrFa.
The future of DACA is unknown, but what's known is that #DACAworks! Recipients contribute to their communities and to our nation's economy. Congress needs to pass permanent protections for Dreamers. https://t.co/XG5mlCzcsM
DACA has allowed individuals to access higher education. If the program were to end, it might be harder for individuals to enroll, attend, and pay for their higher education. https://t.co/FzGIlyaAcx
Although some states allow undocumented immigrants to apply for drivers‚Äô licenses, the majority don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs safe to assume that as an individual‚Äôs DACA expires, so might their license - denying them the ability to legally drive. https://t.co/R9e2nStXdE
Losing DACA doesn‚Äôt only affect recipients themselves. It affects the employers who employee DACAmented individuals, and the economy as a whole. A 2018 DACA survey shows that 89% of respondents are employed in workplaces across the country. https://t.co/XG5mlCzcsM
CAP estimates that the end of DACA could cause as many as 1,240 recipients could lose protections every day in 2019 and 732 could lose protection each day through July 2020. #ProtectDACA
If DACA were to end, current recipients with valid work authorizations would start to see their legal status expire. Expired status means not being able to work and even worse, they‚Äôd become a priority for deportation under the Trump administration‚Äôs policy.
There are 3 nationwide injunctions, possibly a 4th one coming out of Judge Hanen‚Äôs TX court in the next few days, and a likely race to the Supreme Court where Judge #Kavanaugh‚Äôs pending nomination could mean the end to the DACA program.
üö®¬†There is currently a lot of confusion on what‚Äôs happening with the #DACA program that has helped thousands of undocumented youth. @NSvajlenka via @amprog spells out what‚Äôs happening with the program and what would happen is DACA were to end. https://t.co/qHJuOBnUPj
If you, or someone you know, have questions about #DACArenewals visit https://t.co/0BnHYrrrFa and @UNITEDWEDREAM's website for information on requirements, FAQs, and financial info!
Ending DACA would be cruel and counterproductive. Recipients, their communities, and our nation have benefited from the program. Saving the program means saving the futures of the hundreds of thousands of individuals who put their trust in the government.  https://t.co/XG5mlCzcsM
And yet, despite all of the uncertainty, DACA recipients have shown high involvement in civic engagement. #WithDACA 49% of respondents reported they have become more politically active, and 64% said, ‚ÄúI am no longer afraid of my immigration status.‚Äù
The data show #DACA recipients have shown initiative by starting their own businesses and getting jobs that align with their career interests, but it also shows the uncertainty they live with on a daily basis. https://t.co/3DR2E68lzU
The uncertainty of #DACA is weighing heavily on recipients' minds. A majority of respondents reported that they think about being deported at least once a day. Among parents, 74% think about ‚Äúnot being able to see my children grow up because of deportation‚Äù at least once a day.
#WithDACA recipients‚Äô economic power continues to increase. After receiving DACA: 62% of respondents purchased their first car and 14% purchased their first home. These large purchases help state revenue since most states collect a percentage of the purchase price in sales tax.
The future of DACA is unclear, but what‚Äôs clear is how popular and effective the program is. A new survey by @TomWongPhD, @amprog, @UNITEDWEDREAM, and @nilc_org shows that although #DACAworks, recipients worry about their future if the program were to end.
Since 2012 #DACA has helped over 820,000 legally work and drive, enroll in higher education, and find safety from deportation. A new DACA survey shows that 96% of respondents are currently employed or enrolled in school. [THREAD] https://t.co/XG5mlCzcsM https://t.co/fF7Rj3nOdR

From incomplete answers when it comes to specific numbers, to poor explanations about process, what becomes clear about this Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is that the administration was poorly prepared to manage family reunifications. #FamiliesBelongTogether

Instead of these bills, Congress should take up bipartisan solutions such as the #DreamAct and the #USAact. And every member of Congress should push for a vote on the #KeepingFamiliesTogetherAct to ensure that the policy of family separation is ended for good.
Neither would #KeepFamiliesTogether and prevent children from being separated from their parents. Neither would fully protect #Dreamers. Both would slash vital protections for women and children seeking asylum.
The second, Speaker Ryan‚Äôs bill, is equally bad even if proponents have tried to call it a ‚Äúcompromise.‚Äù On top of making drastic cuts to future immigration, it'd fund $25B for an unnecessary wall &amp; create a complicated point system for #DACA recipients. https://t.co/2LLgr4vyMz

On the 6-year anniversary of #DACA let‚Äôs remember the contributions recipients have been able to make because of the program, and the need for Congress to pass permanent protections that will allow recipients to stay and thrive in the country they call home. #DACAanniversary
Recent partisan efforts killed an opportunity for Congress to consider bipartisan bills that would have helped #DACA recipients. Instead, 2 anti-immigrant bills will be voted on next week that will, in the long run, hurt DACA recipients, their families, and people seeking asylum.
The uncertainty of the program is confusing and chaotic and nobody understands this more than the nearly 815,000 #DACA recipients that continue to live their lives in limbo, waiting for Congress to pass permanent protections for them.
In fact, the Trump administration did end DACA in September of 2017, but recent court injunctions have allowed recipients to continue to renew their status. https://t.co/CSUemWhGNl
Even though #DACAworks, there have been countless efforts by states and the Trump administration to end the program.
And not all recipients work in the business sector. Nearly 20,000 #DACA recipients have dedicated their careers to becoming teachers and helping the next generation succeed. #DACAanniversary https://t.co/SNiE4djRiP

Many asylum seekers are from the Northern Triangle region of Central America - which continues to be plagued with violence and economic and political instability. Among those fleeing are women, children (some of which are unaccompanied) and LGBTQ folks.
The Trump administration wants to deter asylum seekers, but here are the FACTS about why people are fleeing. https://t.co/MyblktrNi5
Efforts by the administration to prevent asylum seekers from coming to the U.S. are out-of-touch with the reality that apprehensions at the southern border in FY 17 remain at a near 46-year LOW since FY 1972.

If public safety is indeed the main concern, local jurisdictions should think twice and consider the consequences of implementing 287(g) agreements. https://t.co/tJcwikAoxM
Localities and some law enforcement officials around the country are realizing that embracing, not targeting, undocumented immigrants is better for public safety. https://t.co/TcQsujbR7R
Immigrants living in 287(g) jurisdictions generate nearly $66 billion in spending power and contribute $24 billion in tax revenue annually. Immigrants in these communities are creating economic benefits that are necessary for these communities to thrive. https://t.co/DWJF15d0D6
The 287(g) program comes with high costs that burden localities. In fact, the startup and daily operating costs, coupled with maintenance fees, can easily reach into the millions of dollars. https://t.co/tJcwikAoxM
287(g) agreements divert public safety resources. Maricopa Co. used an enormous amount of resources to target immigrants. While focusing on immigration enforcement, deputies failed to investigate 400 sex crimes and accumulated 77,949 outstanding warrants. https://t.co/5HX18OW6MP
Rita called the police to report that her sister was the victim of domestic violence, but it was Rita who was detained. Agreements that turn local police into to federal immigration officers only make matters worse.
Entangling local law enforcement with ICE can have such damaging effects that some local law enforcement agencies have decided to end their 287(g) agreements because immigrants were TOO AFRAID to contact police. https://t.co/niA0LqU7UG
287(g) agreements have a chilling effect on immigrant communities. @TomWongPhD recently found that when undocumented immigrants knew their local law enforcement worked w/ ICE, they were 61% less likely to report crimes that they witnessed. https://t.co/BrjIhND9MZ

The decision about Honduras will affect tens of thousands of families, the communities in which they live, and the businesses and industries they support. The repercussions also will be felt in Honduras, a country that relies on financial contributions by Hondurans in the US.
This administration has already decided to end #TPS for nearly 260,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Nepal, and Sudan, and a similar protection for thousands of Liberians.
A number of states will be hit particularly hard by the termination of TPS for Honduras. Learn about the state impacts here. #SaveTPS https://t.co/i05rgl3aWn

Economists call the prime working ages between 25 and 54. This graphic shows that under this proposal, the prime working age women would drop by more than 110,000 PER YEAR. https://t.co/NsfBwAdNy9
With the cuts suggested by this legislation, nearly 200,000 fewer women would be allowed to immigrate annually. These women are parents, spouses, and siblings to U.S. citizens.
You read that right. 		Fewer women will be allowed in under the Trump-Grassley proposal.
New analysis finds that the Trump-Grassley legislation will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce opportunities for women to immigrate to the United States, and will disproportionately affect immigrants in their prime working age.
