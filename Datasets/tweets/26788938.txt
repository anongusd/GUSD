Tons of innovative food systems models info available here: https://t.co/d0SauFgejV MA`O included in webinar available here: https://t.co/6a0U65eML3`O
Guessing that much of the seed to grow the corn, to feed these cows, to produce the hamburgers comes from the 808 #sustainableagriculture ??? https://t.co/176bcSTXfJ
Recall that post contact history of Hawai`i ag is based on massive subsidization - by way of stolen/occupied land and water. Going forward new ag models must contend with this, + a million other issues. Perhaps our model holds some keys AND works to empower rural communities https://t.co/eXl3uLAZjN
Similarly there are many Foundations now offering impact funding to for-profits, including to farms https://t.co/cwgktywJZY https://t.co/5ijwUPhpUS https://t.co/tbaaTBEjY1
Not sure you understand our model. Perhaps if you outlined how you think we're "subsidized." You seem to be using the term loosely. If you just mean grant funded then there are a number of programs in @USDA that offer grants to for profit farms. https://t.co/pCMSNJYFvl https://t.co/tbaaTBEjY1
(6) By the way these heavily subsidized grants allowed our young leaders to start work at 5am today, finish at 6pm, to grow real food in a State fumbling around talking about ‚Äúsustainable agriculture models‚Äù https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn
(5) So we think this is real community based sustainable agriculture; and it could might well be the only real future we have for local food production in the State of Hawai‚Äôi https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn
(4) Yes the other 2/3 of our budget comes from competitive federal grants, collabaorative education oriented foundations, and again our own sweat equity. (aka "heavily subsidized" I guess). The back drop is our State is negligent in educating kanaka maoli kids‚Ä¶in our own home. https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn
(3) If scaled to 250 acres, we could produce enough $ from organic food production to fund the college education and stipend of over 500 kids, yet 7,000 acres of our valley is occupied by the US Navy https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn
(2) MA`O is self-sufficient on 24-acres and a small net margin supports a small portion of all our education programs. Farm produces as much food as any organic farm in HI, &gt;160K pounds/yr https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn
(1) MA`O's total annual budget is a little under $2 million; farm gross sales provide 1/3. Remember gross sales = the sweat equity of forty 16 ‚Äì 25 yr old local kids, marginalized by a crappy public education system and racism. https://t.co/zFCtcyJBzn

@richardha yet seems like majority of GMO seed produced in HI, corn or otherwise, is shipped off-island, is GMO corn grown on Big Isl ?
