In Puerto Rico, NAP provides significantly lower benefits, has a much lower poverty threshold for eligibility, &amp; leaves many families in need without the food security they would have living in the states.  Block grants don't work!  #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR #FoodFri
Amen! #EqualityforPR https://t.co/y7aIT8zIal
Did you know that food in Puerto Rico is more expensive, but NAP benefits are less than SNAP benefits? This means families in Puerto Rico have less money to spend on food than families in the continental US.  #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR #FoodFri
Puerto Rico deserves equality, especially when it comes to food security. Congress must act to provide Puerto Rico w/additional disaster NAP dollars so that the people of Puerto Rico can feed their families. #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR #FoodFri
NAP in Puerto Rico is a block grant &amp; benefits are disproportionately lower below SNAP benefits in the states.  Yet Puerto Rico experiences higher levels of food insecurity  #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR #FoodFri
Food for thought - nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico is not a hand-out, its a hand-up.  As the island continues to recovery from Hurricane Maria, we must take care of our most vulnerable citizens. #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR #FoodFri
Unless Congress takes action ASAP, 1.4 million Puerto Rican residents will experience deep cuts to their NAP benefits or be cut off from food assistance altogether. This is an emergency! Congress needs to take action NOW! #FoodFri #TakeAction4PR #Food4PR
