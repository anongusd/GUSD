As I see it, going around Congress to build this wall is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  I’m sure the courts will agree.
The President previously signed funding bills that didn't include funding for his wall and funded other priorities. Money cannot and should not be reallocated without the express approval of Congress and the Appropriations Committee.
The Constitution is very clear. Congress has the power of the purse, not the President. This #FAKENationalEmergency is going around Congress &amp; the @AppropsDems @SenateApprops to waste money building an unnecessary wall along the southern border.
The reality of the #FakeTrumpEmergency? It makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness &amp; quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively.
I stand with @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer to defend ourConstitution. This “national emergency” scam violates our system of checks &amp; balances, and undermines our Founders’ vision for our country. QT: https://t.co/GcZXe5bgxC
The president's insistence on building a wall dragged us through the longest shutdown in history. Now he wants to declare a #NationalEmergency that will reallocate resources from other places to fund it, including from #PuertoRico's aid funds. This is absurd and disgusting.
Many of my constituents in #TheBronx have benefited from their services, and as Chairman of the @AppropsDems CJS subcommittee, funding this agency is one of my top priorities.

Public Safety Will Be Undermined.  State and local law enforcement training programs will be stopped.  The Department of Justice’s civil litigation efforts against bad actors will halt.  Payments to crime victims will stop.

Failure to include funding for the border wall is the only thing keeping the President from approving &amp; signing the bipartisan CR legislation that the Senate passed, which the House is more than ready to pass. Wasn’t #Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?

.@FEMA is currently not offering #PuertoRico this much needed assistance. One more amendment to increase disaster relief funding that @HouseAppropsGOP votes against today.
To help displaced individuals in areas hit by hurricanes in 2017, I offered an amendment that sets aside $100 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to establish a Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP).
This amendment also expands those policies to other locations that we think are crucial in providing the services that all people residing in this country need for their health, safety, and welfare. Republicans unwisely rejected the amendment. @AppropsDems
Offered another amendment with @RepBarbaraLee to prevent funds for #ICE and #CBP from being used to conduct enforcement actions at existing sensitive locations (hospitals, schools, churches etc.).
Instead of increasing money for #ICE, we should invest in FEMA so that when a natural disaster hits again, our nation is ready to help all of its people. But @HouseAppropsGOP voted down.
I offered an amendment increasing @FEMA funding for more disaster response staff and training. FEMA has thousands less personnel than needed to respond to multiple disasters- a big reason for inadequate response in #PuertoRico after #HurricaneMaria.
The Stafford Act provides assistance for a total of 26 weeks, but due to the severity of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Congress should extend this assistance for an additional 26 weeks as it has done in the past. I thank my colleagues for agreeing to this important amendment.
My amendment with @RepBarbaraLee extends benefits under the Disaster Unemployment Assistance Program in both #PuertoRico and the #USVI for 52 weeks after the major disaster declaration date.

These problems have only gotten worse under the active encouragement of the Trump Administration. This is why I’m joining the call to abolish ICE. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/i0eAmNmiCO
Like the rest of our current immigration system, ICE is broken. For years, it has engaged in questionable behavior and has proven unable to oversee the dozens of contract detention centers they send individuals to on a daily basis.

One in five public school teachers have second jobs during the school year. We should be doing more to help them – not taking away tools that help them win a better future. #Janus
#Janus ignores 41 years of legal precedent in order to undermine the ability of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and all public service workers to negotiate for decent pay and fair workplaces.
@HouseGOP's have prevented an important debate on this issue by not making my amendment in order. #KeepFamiliesTogether
for less than 6 months work- total waste of money. @DeptofDefense lawyers are not trained in immigration law or asylum claims.  This is nothing more than another attempt to militarize the border
The @RulesReps didn’t allow me to offer my amendment to the FY2019 Defense Appropriations Bill to prevent the @DeptofDefense from using funds to send military lawyers to help @TheJusticeDept w/ immigration cases at the border. This would cost the taxpayer $3.3 million...

I co-sponsored the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act &amp; spoke against family separations today. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/QZFv4VF8um
.@realDonaldTrump‘s  Executive Order to stop family separations would still keep families (parents with their children) incarcerated at detention facilities. We must continue to fight against the inhumane treatment of #immigrants and asylum seekers.
I continue to speak out against the policy of separating children from their parents. Today I spoke at a markup of the State,Foreign operations Appropriations bill. This inhumane policy has to end. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/veAaqw0DoJ

Numbers have consequences. We need to acknowledge that the federal government’s neglect ended up costing American lives, ensure accountability, and do more to help the island recover &amp; prepare for a new hurricane season.
Joined @HispanicCaucus, @NydiaVelazquez, @RepDarrenSoto, @RubenGallego, @RepEspaillat, @amprog representatives &amp; others today to bring attention to the thousands of people that have died as a result of Hurricane Maria according to new Harvard study. https://t.co/Ctx8u0WqKo
When many continued to ask for a strong response to help Puerto Rico after Maria the President did not order a full response. Instead he downplayed how severe it was.The Harvard study estimates that 4,600 may have died. Worst catastrophe in history in a state or territory.
The tweets by Roseanne are just one example of the racism and bigotry that we must continue to fight in our country. ABC was right in taking action. But we can’t forget the tone set by the White House that is full of hate and lacks respect for others.

Farrell was special. A great legislator who respected everyone’s opinion and worked with all. From day one he was a leader respected by all. Those were difficult days for our state and Denny was part of finding solutions. My condolences to his family.  R.I.P my friend &amp; colleague
Denny Farrell and I were part of the 1975 NY Assembly freshmen class. We became friends and like other members of that large newly elected group he became a colleague I looked to for advice. He had been involved in government and politics longer than the rest of us.
Angelo Falcon made us aware of so many issues related to the Puerto Rican diaspora through his writings and analysis. His opinions on the issues in our community were respected by the media, elected officials and scholars. His fight for justice will be missed. R.I.P.

Instead, @EDgov should work with IHEs in Puerto Rico and USVI to help them access these funds and make the application process as streamlined as possible.

We need everyone in our country to participate in the Census to properly allocate federal funds to local communities nationwide, including #TheBronx. The inclusion of this question would have repercussions that last more than 10 years.
Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census is unnecessary, unsupported, &amp; a clear attack on communities already living in fear under @realDonaldTrump's Administration.

We are still in recess waiting for the senate to vote and send to us the funding bill. We may get it around 4:30am. I know we can do better than always waiting to the last minute. But when it comes to these bills timing is the least of my concerns.

As Ranking Democrat on @AppropsDems subcommittee overseeing @FBI budget. It is important to note that this past year @realdonaldtrump proposed CUTTING FBI budget, but Congress opposed- that is the true ‘support’ Trump has for FBI rank &amp; file. #MemoDay

Americans know Republicans own the #TrumpShutdown. Anyone claiming otherwise should double check who has control in Congress. https://t.co/QTLuhWB0bd
He told us he was the great deal maker. Well, with republican control of the White House, the senate and the House —what did he give us? The #TrumpShutdown in addition to hateful comments, tax breaks to the rich and an attitude that says it’s his way or no way.
A #GOPshutdown will slow even more @fema recovery efforts in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVirginIslands. It will delay approval &amp; distribution of already limited funding for long-term projects to rebuild the islands. @GOP is once again showing it doesn’t care about #PuertoRico.
#Republicans are afraid of their most extreme elements- putting partisanship and extremism ahead of common sense, compromise, and the needs of our country #GOPshutdown
Republicans control the House, Senate, &amp; White House.  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have refused to work with Democrats, and are now leaving town without a solution.  Can’t even get basics of government right #GOPshutdown
I also voted against the @GOP #ContinuingResolution because it does not address the needs of #PuertoRico &amp; the #USVirginIslands, where many homes are still without electricity &amp; disaster assistance badly needed.  American Citizen still suffering- and @GOP doesn’t care.
Last night I voted against the @GOP's inept attempt at running our country w/ another #ContinuingResolution. They refuse to address the over 800k #DACA recipients who are losing their legal status to work every day. We cannot continue to allow such uncertainty on model citizens.

#3	@dhsoig also gave general findings of report, including:	1. @customsborder was given no warning on issuance of the #muslimban or its scope. That meant they had no guidance and no idea how to implement it or answer basic questions about it- especially for LPRs.
2 @dhsoig had conducted a thorough review and written a report &amp; submitted to @dhsgov for comment on 10/6. Later told that agency was considering using 2 different types of privilege to limit report's release w/no timeline for a decision. So @dhsoig sent a letter to explain delay

I'm also concerned that the @uscensusbureau does not adequately fund the tools needed to plan, improve response rates, and lower costs.
This bill also targets agencies battling climate change. It cuts 19% of @NOAAResearch funds &amp; $217 million from @NASA Earth science program.
@LSCtweets is cut by $85 million, making it harder to obtain affordable legal help. The bill also eliminates the @COPSOffice hiring grants
I support the investments in the bill, but I'm gravely concerned about inadequate funding levels for important agencies and programs.
Our FY18 bill rejects Trump's proposed cuts to @NSF &amp; the Minority Business Development Agency while increasing funds for the @FBI &amp; @ATFHQ.
Today the FY18 #CJS  Approps bill is being marked up. I don't agree with everything in the bill, but there are some important investments.

If @SenateGOP really wanted to improve healthcare, their bill wouldn't spike premiums &amp; make millions lose coverage like failed House bill

I voted NO on #AHCA-  A bill that guts patient protections of pre-existing conditions, raids Medicare &amp; ends Medicaid expansion.
#AHCA would discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and establish an "age tax" on people over 50.
Dear @HouseGOP I find your lack of faith (in #Obamacare) disturbing. #maythe4th #ProtectOurCare
#AHCA would kick 14 million Americans off Medicaid – harming children, seniors &amp; people with disabilities. #NoAHCA #ProtectOurCare
NoAHCA #TheBronx and the U.S. cannot afford a 25-29% hike in premiums and to be discriminated against due to pre-existing conditions.

#TrumpCare is classic Republican politics – a massive transfer of wealth from the working to the already wealthy.

Glad @GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare got nowhere in the House. Let's work to improve access, not take it away. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/hRVpapUUAy
The @GOP will hurt the most vulnerable by taking away their healthcare. 5,000+ Seniors &amp; 18,000+ children will lose coverage in my district.
How can the @GOP approve of #TrumpCare when they know senior citizens will pay higher premiums, and lose Medicaid coverage? #PayMoreForLess
You know #TrumpCare is #NotAPlan when more than 18,000 children will lose healthcare coverage in my district if approved. I'm voting #NoAHCA
