@eric_on_wheels Eric, check the site out and we can talk Saturday. Got to help others in morning. Great dialog. God bless us all
@eric_on_wheels Its America you have that choice. I truly believe it's you who you seek. Ask God to use you in prayer then watch your life.
@eric_on_wheels Eric, I got a story bro @1Emiy unity is my goal. I lost everything and never looked back. No investment or loans.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews Thanks for the awesome dialog and solutions.
@eric_on_wheels Eric, im not divided in fact i am inspired to be involved with men like you. You are, we are the solution.
@eric_on_wheels "Man cannot stand alone in his Victory" You do not have to wait grab a few males and teach. Ill help you. You can do it
@eric_on_wheels If he did nothing he woke up young black males and females, and family in example. His team was diverse. What did blacks do?
@eric_on_wheels Mental Health is a huge problem. Suicide, Murder, Race, Self Hate, all carry guns. We got major issues from within. Sorry
Fatherhood is the cure to what else us. Not wars..
@eric_on_wheels I can't show you but you must know this is direct results of fatherless homes and hateful policies. War's self hate etc.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews Man has caused majority of poverty 1964 food stamp act. War on poverty the beginning of today's issues
@eric_on_wheels We can fix it as men and fathers. I've witnessed it.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews Imagine if you take all these fathers how many children fall into worse. I do get it. Solve it
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews There's this little thing called poverty that War's create. Look how many children are hungry.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews War from within is worse your troops are sick sir from hate and lies. We must fix us first.
@eric_on_wheels if that is your thoughts then don't stop there US has more than cop killings murder is rampant through out this country.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews War is not the answer &amp; if we are to fix this, all men must realize how many fatherless homes we have.
@eric_on_wheels violence is being fed down our throats from Tv to video games to small countries sir.
@realDomoldTrump @dserrone37 @cnsnews @POTUS According to what is being shown the world continues to be seen very violent from us to africa.
@gf5nov1605 @dserrone37 T i can't really give measurables sir but that was the intent sir. I'm afraid war is not the answer though.

@RichyWilson yes sir,
@RichyWilson Shidddd Money is a factor but skin ranks the most. All the kids and athletes know it. Swimmer 6month Blk FB player 60 yrs math
@RichyWilson No jobs, War on poverty and drugs resulted in major family destruction
@RichyWilson Racism will lock up who and what it wants.
@RichyWilson Not saying black cases dont get same.
@RichyWilson the real reason is selective prosecution. Here they will throw out cases or slide a case out of court for whites. I've seen it
@RichyWilson The black male is in prison or grave they are adapting to what they feel is no choice. Alot of men have had no father.
@RichyWilson Greed, Policies that breed failure, raping other countries, murdering, i could go own and yet they don't get it.
@RichyWilson We have been the most violent country for decades. Now the world watches us implode. We have sold out our country.
@RichyWilson my answer, wars, Hate, murder, lies, generational Reaping. As men we created most of the problems. What goes must come back
@RichyWilson The men are dying from suicide, homicide, prostate cancer, Heart failure, etc this includes male child.
@RichyWilson Guess what black females are now the fastest growing prison population. Right now. Crazy
@RichyWilson exactly the men are way more important than we know.  Black Males, Hispanic Males, White Males, All Males Are in trouble
@RichyWilson considering the pleas and the murders. Men must wake up hate is wiping us out. What 8-9 men majority Fathers. Smh
@RichyWilson What is this?
@RichyWilson Its bad when i was at gym today, i went back to 10yrs old and remember a all state player being killed on court then. 40yrs
Wow https://t.co/LJ4JcIxyOl
@RichyWilson They probably had no choice. Pleas are the way it goes in courts.
@RichyWilson no sir please don't i do not know all facts but it was huge.
@RichyWilson I know about white males too. That's why i say men are dying at alarming rates and not pating attention. Hate got them blind
@RichyWilson Its hard trusting that stuff because of all the corruption going on here I've not seen but one person go to jail.
@RichyWilson If not for @QuickenLoans owner we would be in trouble.
@RichyWilson In Detroit they just found a human parts factory, and they went silent. Morgs are full of dead bodies. Corruption
@RichyWilson Ok yes former governors, businesses, like the building of prisons and manipulating education.
@RichyWilson Let me ask you, if businesses in your area never helped but just took money what you feel?
@RichyWilson In Detroit I've not had comtact with them or any other movement that stops this, but alot of people gain off the 90%
@RichyWilson Honestly I started @1Emiy as a way to stop this. To answer many small groups are helping as much as they can.
@RichyWilson i agree just don't want them to repeat this.
@RichyWilson Hey one thing is sure I've met you my friend a well rounded leader.
@RichyWilson We can't hate is hidden and verbalized. Its automatic in the heart of people, look at us now. Its sad what our kids see.
Absolutely, you will. Imagine including the hate that comes with both parties. https://t.co/0zrE8Y6Csj

Step 6, Colorism is inside every race by using ignorant terms to describe each other. Stop your practicing HATE!
Step 5, We are America if we are in global move every child is very important to us. All children must be educated before kindergarten.
Ps. Its in history books of the murder courts go silent and looked the other way.
Step 4, America must eradicate all hate groups including the Terriost KKK any affiliations should be prosecuted. Kkk has killed with no jail
Step 3, All cops must tell on the bad cops just like you want community to tell on criminals. This helps families. Admit this is Good.
Step 2, the HOOD which is negative ro me. No longer have businesses who do not give back or help in community. Taking needs to end.
Since we are fixing things, here's one to work on have everyone look into your phone if your numbers don't have different races, reach out.

Good Morning broken souls, TIME TO REPAIR AMERICA!
However this is not the time to implode, war at home only says your reaping what you have sowed in a Christian country. We MUST FIX US
There is no one exempt from the benefits of slavery globally and especially the American economy. We did it, we must fix it. All of us.
From the mores to the madonna, to the courts and multiple wars we all fought together. War on poverty to war on drugs attacked.
Taking back our country implies only one culture. You can't take again what actually belongs to all. We are reaping what we done to others.
The real problem is the erasing of history and the lies history has told to all involved about our country. The truth is WE all built USA.
@JohnDePetroshow @GMA @ABC @POTUS no the ignorance of lies over hundreds of excuses and blatant murder did It's all our faught.

@DinduNuffinstuf i know these stats all to well however has no bearing on this case and video. A racist jury will free these murderers.
