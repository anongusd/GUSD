NEW: Ranking Member @RonWyden today demanded that the Trump administration improve access to reproductive health services for women who count on Medicaid. https://t.co/QWJ04CDIFl
.@RonWyden: Your profits are outsized compared to others in the industry, you receive a massive portion of your revenue from American taxpayers &amp; you bear none of the consequences of high drug prices. It‚Äôs past time to drop the excuses &amp; make prescription drugs affordable.
.@RonWyden: I was there when seven Big Tobacco CEOs testified in a committee room like this one, and they lied. The chairman and I expect better this morning.
.@RonWyden: This is a stark illustration of drugmakers‚Äô profiteering &amp; two-faced scheming. The argument that the committee will hear in response is that the fault is everybody else‚Äôs. The health plans are at fault. The PBMs are at fault. They always point the finger elsewhere.
.@RonWyden: @bmsnews: In 2017, the company spent roughly $11.5 billion on dividends, stock buybacks, marketing, sales and administrative costs. That‚Äôs roughly triple the amount it spent on R&amp;D.
.@RonWyden: @JNJCares, a record-setting flip-flop. This January 7th, at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, CEO Alex Gorsky said that the pharmaceutical industry needed to self-police on pricing. The company raised prices three days later.
.@RonWyden: @AstraZeneca, a lesson in saying the quiet part out loud. In an interview earlier this year, CEO Pascal Soriot complained that his $12 million salary made him, ‚Äúthe lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry.‚Äù He said it was, ‚Äúannoying to some extent.‚Äù
.@RonWyden: @sanofi, a company wringing more and more cash out of people with an incurable disease. In 2010, a vial of Sanofi insulin cost less than $100. In 2018 it cost nearly $300, and the company raised prices again in 2019.
.@RonWyden: @Merck gets second prize for emptiest gesture on pricing in 2018. It made sweet sounding promises after coming under criticism, but it cut prices for drugs that provide essentially no revenue to the company.
.@RonWyden: Once the president got his splashy headlines, his gaze turned elsewhere, and @Pfizer‚Äôs former CEO told investors it was back to ‚Äúbusiness as normal.‚Äù
.@RonWyden: @Pfizer gets first prize for emptiest gesture on pricing in 2018. After Trump tweets last year, Pfizer said it would temporarily freeze prices.
.@RonWyden: I also want to address troubling information the committee recently uncovered. @AbbVie‚Äôs proxy statement filed with the SEC shows that in 2017, a portion of CEO Richard Gonzalez‚Äôs multi-million dollar bonus was directly tied to sales of Humira.
.@RonWyden: AbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring. https://t.co/sWZt9YfQaG
.@RonWyden: @AbbVie manufactures the top-selling prescription drug in America, the arthritis medication Humira. Over six years, the company doubled the price of a 12-month supply from $19,000 to $38,000. Can patients opt for a less expensive alternative? No they cannot.
.@RonWyden: Drug makers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the customers they value above all else. Let‚Äôs look at concrete examples, starting with @AbbVie.
.@RonWyden: Pharma execs are here because the way you do business is unacceptable and unsustainable. Ten companies accounted for half of all profits in the health care sector last fall. NINE of those ten were drug manufacturers.
.@RonWyden: It is morally repugnant when ailing patients are forced to choose between filling that next prescription or putting food on the table, because they can‚Äôt afford both. It is morally repugnant when patients are forced to skip doses.
.@RonWyden: The brakes have come off pharmaceutical pricing &amp; American families are hurtling along in the passenger seat terrified of what comes next. Today the committee will hear uplifting stories about miracle cures but it is morally repugnant when patients can‚Äôt afford them.
.@RonWyden: Prescription drugs did not become outrageously expensive by accident. It‚Äôs not the result of a system too complicated for Americans to comprehend. Drug prices are astronomically high because that‚Äôs where pharmaceutical companies and their investors want them.

.@RonWyden: I believe Medicare ought to be able to use the collective bargaining power of 43 million seniors to get better deals for patients and taxpayers.
.@RonWyden: No shortage of evidence about what the problems are. Drugmakers have unchecked power to set prices on their own. Power often used to meet Wall Street‚Äôs expectations rather than meet demand in the market. The system prioritizes quarterly earnings over human lives.
.@RonWyden: It is grotesque that price-hiking drug makers have turned American patients into beggars.

.@RonWyden: Trump‚Äôs dark money policy reinforces that corruption in the system. It concentrates power in the hands of those special interests that can afford to cut a big check and buy the election results they want. It takes power away from individual people.
.@RonWyden: Colleagues, the dark money rule change feeds right into this system of malignant, secretive politics that Americans are sick of. And it gets to the heart of a larger problem. Across the country, our right to vote, our elections, and our democracy are under assault.
.@RonWyden: Colleagues, one thing is clear to me from my conversations with voters in Oregon this election season. What voters DO NOT want is more secret spending from more anonymous wealthy donors and foreigners leading to more political advertising.
.@RonWyden: If the dark money rule change is no big deal then why did the Trump admin work so hard to block the Congress from challenging it? They keep the rule change off the official books for as long as they could, presumably hoping to run out the clock on our oversight.
.@RonWyden: I take a back seat to nobody on the issue of privacy rights in America. But allowing foreigners and mega-wealthy corporations to buy elections in secrecy is not a matter of privacy -- it‚Äôs a position of anti-democracy.
.@RonWyden: Now, since this is a tax policy change, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, where we do a lot of work on issues dealing with tax exemptions. But let‚Äôs make one thing clear -- this change got no debate in the Finance Committee.
.@RonWyden: Even if the IRS and state tax authorities suspect a particular spending group is guilty of wrongdoing, they won‚Äôt know who provided its cash.
.@RonWyden: Shadowy political spending groups used to be required under tax laws to disclose the identities of their major donors. After this recent change they won‚Äôt have to disclose at all.
.@RonWyden: Hours after the majority of the public heard Butina‚Äôs name for the first time the Trump admin dropped its dark money bombshell, announcing a new policy that would allow even more untraceable dark money from foreigners &amp; special interests to infiltrate our elections.
.@RonWyden: She cultivated relationships with political insiders. She worked to organized ‚Äúback channel‚Äù lines of communication for the benefit of the Russian Federation. She set up a shell company in North Dakota with an NRA-connected operative.
.@RonWyden: July 16th, 2018. Monday morning. The American people wake up to news of the arrest of an accused Russian spy in Washington named Maria Butina. She came to the U.S. years earlier and set out infiltrating conservative organizations, principally the NRA.
.@RonWyden: But the rule change the Trump administration pushed through this summer is all about darkness. It‚Äôs all about secrecy. It‚Äôs all about giving the well-connected even MORE of a say in how our government works.
.@RonWyden: If you‚Äôre worried about anonymous political insiders with deep pockets tightening their grip on Washington, sunlight is the best disinfectant. And colleagues, sunlight should not be a partisan proposition.
.@RonWyden: I deeply believe when you‚Äôre facing down secret money shifting between shadowy groups who want to buy elections, sunlight is the best disinfectant.

.@RonWyden: I hope that was just his way of dodging the question. If not, then Muzinich is suggesting it‚Äôs A-OK for special interests and foreign actors to buy American elections if it makes the tax reporting easier.
.@RonWyden: With this new policy, Trump is blinding law enforcement and telling foreigners and dark money groups to keep the election cash flowing. I couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer. Mr. Muzinich told me, and I quote, ‚Äúthe intent was to further efficient tax administration.‚Äù
.@RonWyden: I‚Äôve also got serious concerns about the way Mr. Muzinich responded to my questions about the Trump administration‚Äôs policy opening the floodgates to more foreign dark money in our politics.
.@RonWyden: No matter what you call it, it just isn‚Äôt based in reality. The Trump tax handout will not pay for itself. Mr. Muzinich is still sticking to this false claim.
.@RonWyden: When Mr. Muzinich came before the Finance Committee for his nomination hearing...one question he did answer straight up was whether he agreed that the Trump tax handouts would, quote ‚Äúpay for themselves and reduce our deficit.‚Äù He gave a one word response: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
.@RonWyden: If a nominee says the Trump tax handouts will pay for themselves, I‚Äôm going to oppose them. Why? Because sticking by that debunked claim is the economic policy version of being a flat-earther. You‚Äôre either peddling an idea you know is untrue, or you can‚Äôt do math.

There's more work to be done in order to improve Medicare's guarantee for ALL seniors with chronic illnesses. Instead of threatening cuts to critical benefits that seniors rely on, lawmakers should be working hard to improve the system &amp; deliver better, more accessible care.

Americans are sick of watching corporations ship jobs overseas, abuse unfair loopholes, &amp; shift their profits to fake headquarters on zero-tax islands. Multinational corporations will get a big reward for doing business overseas - not job creation here in the US.
While corporations are celebrating a lavish holiday gift of trillions of dollars in tax cuts, middle class families will be hoping they‚Äôre lucky enough to avoid the #GOPTaxPlan‚Äôs unaffordable tax hike.
There‚Äôs a massive gap between the Republican rhetoric surrounding the bill &amp; the reality of what‚Äôs on paper. For millions in the middle class, the #GOPTaxPlan won‚Äôt be a tax cut at all ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tax increase.

@RonWyden What‚Äôs happening this afternoon isn‚Äôt a serious hearing -- it‚Äôs a talking point. -- @RonWyden on #GrahamCassidy
@RonWyden In #grahamcassidy, the attack on women‚Äôs health continues. Hundreds of thousands of women will lose the right to see doctor they choose
@RonWyden States building new health insurance systems will have to make Hunger Games choices, deciding who will get care &amp; which won't #grahamcassidy
@RonWyden The guaranteed protection that nobody will be gouged due to a catastrophic illness like cancer will be gone. #GrahamCassidy
@RonWyden The ironclad, loophole-free, guaranteed protection for those with pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act will be gone
@RonWyden The real flexibility created by this bill is the option for states to do worse -- so that Americans are forced to pay more $$ for less care.
@RonWyden The new strategy you see in #grahamcassidy is repeal by a thousand cuts. It‚Äôll be national repeal and state-by-state repeal.
@RonWyden The American people do not want this bill. In the last few days, the committee has received 27K+ comments from people who want it stopped.
@RonWyden #GrahamCassidy is a nightmare for tens of millions of Americans. It makes a mockery of Trump promises of better insurance for everybody

It ought to be clear by now that Republicans will be telling the public they‚Äôre fixing health care right up until the minute it‚Äôs taken away

#Trumpcare is an outright attack on the health care of women in America.
Republican health plan slashes #Medicaid, forcing states to cut benefits &amp; access to care &amp; women will be some of the hardest hit.
Women are more likely than men to have a disability. #Medicaid is key to helping millions live independent lives in their communities.
#Trumpcare plan to slash #Medicaid poses a particular threat to women in America.
The campaign against Planned Parenthood ignores the fact that millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood to get basic medical care.
#Trumpcare defunds Planned Parenthood meaning hundreds of thousands of women will lose the right to see the doctor they know &amp; trust.
Republicans say they‚Äôre focused on bringing costs down for everybody. Apparently ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù ‚â† mothers, whose costs could be going up.
#Trumpcare says that health insurance in America should be based on what men need, &amp; what women need should cost extra. -- @RonWyden

At a minimum, the GOP ought to bring this process out from behind closed doors. There should be hearings convened like during the ACA.
What‚Äôs the backup plan for vulnerable seniors in rural areas? #Trumpcare cuts could hit seniors in those areas especially hard.
The fact is, growing old in America is expensive. #Medicaid is the barrier that keeps millions of seniors from falling into destitution.
If states are forced to cut #Medicaid benefits &amp; access, how are seniors protected from living in squalor?
#Medicaid helps pay for 2 out of 3 nursing home beds in America.

Medicare is a guarantee of defined benefits - it‚Äôs past time to update this promise to give better care to patients with chronic conditions.
The committee‚Äôs bipartisan chronic care working group has been working hard to update the Medicare guarantee.
We‚Äôre going to hold GOP accountable because this country can‚Äôt go back to the days when health care worked only for the healthy and wealthy.
If my Republican colleagues continue down this road &amp; reject bipartisanship, my colleagues &amp; I will fight it every step of the way.
We can work together on injecting more competition into markets, reducing costs for families, and bringing prescription drug prices down.
My colleagues and I on this side would gladly take a seat at the table. I‚Äôve written bipartisan health bills in the past. It can be done.
Bottom line, you cannot revive an abusive health care system to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy &amp; expect Americans to be excited.

#Mnuchin would be in charge of spearheading Trump's tax plan. This plan would not clean out the rot at the heart of our tax system.

.@RonWyden: The bottom line is that it‚Äôs long past time for Congress to attack the corporate tax gap
$67 billion in owed taxes is unpaid by corporations every year, putting the programs everyday Americans use on the chopping block
.@RonWyden: 5 million Americans live in deep poverty. SNAP benefits are cut &amp; Medicare &amp; Medicaid are constantly threatened.
.@RonWyden: Over a decade, the corporate tax gap adds up to more than two-thirds of a trillion dollars in unpaid corporate taxes
The tax gap is the amount of taxes owed which go unpaid. Currently the corporate tax gap is $67 BILLION a year.
.@RonWyden: Some systems IRS uses are Kennedy-era. Upgrading IT can‚Äôt be done when a tight budget means you have one hand behind your back
.@RonWyden: Biggest ongoing challenge for IRS = providing best service to taxpayers even though IRS has increasingly limited resources
.@RonWyden: Strong trade deals &amp; strong trade enforcement go hand-in-hand
.@RonWyden: Trade enforcement package makes environmental issues a priority for our trade enforcers

.@RonWyden: If Congress does the right thing &amp; puts innovative ideas to work, we'd see $1 trillion invested in America's #infrastructure.
.@RonWyden: Example: Build America Bonds blew expectations out of the water- financing $180 billion in transportation projects across the US
Long game = getting private investment off the sidelines &amp; into America's #infrastructure - to the tune of $1 trillion.
.@RonWyden: Highway funding cannot become another stop-and-go issues like #SGR &amp; tax incentives. #infrastructure
The short &amp; long game in #infrastructure. Short = reauthorizing &amp; fixing the Highway Trust Fund.
China invests 8.5% of it's GDP in #infrastructure. The U.S. invests only 1.7%. That hurts America when we compete for investment.
.@RonWyden: The condition of America's roads, bridges, and ports affects our competitiveness in the global economy.
