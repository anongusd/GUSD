Additionally, Mason played a role in COFO‚Äôs massive black voter registration drive, the Freedom Summer of 1964. Also, he served as president of the Mississippi NAACP for thirty-three years. #LiberatorsoftheMagnolia
It was not decided until 1968 when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Mississippi beaches were public and had to be desegregated by federal law.
Mason filed the first school desegregation lawsuit in the history of Biloxi, which he also won.  A legal challenge to the segregation had been initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice in May 1960 but had been delayed in getting a court hearing.
Mason led a third wade-in protest at the beach in spring 1963, two weeks after the funeral for Medgar Evers. The protesters faced a much larger group of nearly 2000 white protesters, but this time the police prevented violence against them.
These resulted in a successful anti-discrimination lawsuit against the state of Mississippi, the first such case filed in U.S. history. They were attacked by groups of whites across the beaches as the Biloxi police stood by without taking action.
He led a nonviolent protest against the ‚Äúwhites only‚Äù section of a federally funded Gulf Coast beach.  Mason‚Äôs group was arrested.  Subsequent ‚Äúwade-ins‚Äù ignited some of the bloodiest white riotings in Mississippi history.
He is most notable for organizing and participating in Mississippi's first nonviolent civil disobedience action, known as the Biloxi wade-ins, which took place from 1959 to 1963.
Dr. Gilbert R. Mason, Sr. was a physician who was known as the ‚Äúwade-in‚Äù activist.  Mason started a family practice in Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1955. https://t.co/cffu0OvjEa

He was the first African- American to hold office since the Reconstruction Era.  Also, he remained the only African- American until 1976 and was repeated reelected until 2003. In 2004, he became the first African-American to have a Mississippi State building named after him.
Mr. Clark and the Freedom Democratic Party is responsible for having registered thousands of black voters for the first time after reconstruction.  Robert G. Clark was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1967.
In 1963, he began working to register and educate voters. He became a candidate in the Freedom Democratic Party in 1967 because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which prohibited racial discrimination in voting.
Clark received his bachelor‚Äôs degree from @JacksonStateU and his Masters in Administration and Education Services from Michigan State University.  His Ph.D. was almost completed before he decided to devote his time to pursue politics.
Robert G. Clark Jr. impacted the lives of many during his tenure as a teacher in Holmes County, MS. His family was trailblazers in economic development because they became landowners immediately following the American Civil War. https://t.co/kaOxF4jtEp

As mayor, she oversaw the construction of several sets of public housing, the first time that federal housing had been built in Issaquena County. Furthermore, she gained national attention by traveling across the country to promote the construction of low-income housing.
During her time participating in the Civil Rights Movement, she was jailed over 70 times because of her role in civil rights protests and other actions.	She was elected mayor of Mayersville, MS in 1976, making her the first female African-American mayor in Mississippi.
Later that year, she became a member of the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. In late August, she and 67 other elected Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention.
She first got involved in the Civil Rights Movement in June 1964, when two activists from SNCC came to Mayersville.  After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in the summer of 1964 and hearing her experiences in the Civil Rights Movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC.

As its president, she supervises an after-school tutorial/enhancement program where she spends her free time teaching and mentoring children at risk.
In a state that ranks 50th among the states in the percent of children who are poor, Ms. Slaughter-Harvey continues to direct her personal and professional efforts to assist minority and poor youth through the Slaughter Memorial Foundation.
She filed a desegregation suit against the highway patrol, which resulted in the hiring of African American highway patrolmen. Ms. Slaughter-Harvey‚Äôs dedication to civil rights did not end with the struggles of the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s.
Slaughter-Harvey was inspired by the brutal death of Medgar Evers, whom she met as a student at @TougalooCollege. After graduating from law school, she represented the families of the 2 students who were brutalized and killed by highway patrolmen in 1970 at @JacksonStateU.
