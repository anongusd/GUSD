Kudos to Fed Chair Powell for reminding Congress "very troubling" U.S. work force participation rate is low compared to other countries and that we need real ed. reform, smarter drug crisis response and gov't. programs that provide needed help but don’t discourage work.
Artificial intelligence will soon improve services in jaw-dropping ways that will leap-frog both politics and politicians, but that future must include the right for all of us to legally own and easily control our own data -- or else data autocrats will have way too much power.
Again returning from Silicon Valley reminded that: (1) technology will do more to transform health care, education and transportation than politicians; (2) strategic, legal immigration is vital to U.S. innovation; and (3) aggressive consumer data protection laws needed asap.
