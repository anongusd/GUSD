@RoseBud9979 I blame the writers more than the characters. I yell at the characters though too, lol. But I am not gonna hate on Jason to to make you happy. 	This is the direction the writers are taking at this point. It sucks majorly and I wish it were different.  Peace sister.
@RoseBud9979 I'm not sure how blaming writers is a copout, they write what the characters say and do. 	I can see this convo is getting no where so please enjoy your day.
@RoseBud9979 Baby girl, characters can't do what is not written. Right now the focus of Jason is Sam. Until the writers get their head out of their behinds we are stuck with a stupid Jason. That's all I'm saying. 	You can be mad at Jason all you want, I'm going to continue2 pound the writers.
@RoseBud9979 I'm gonna say that is your opinion. Jason has always let the mom have the lead, always. 	Typically Liz would have sought him out ... she went to the jail  but after that nada. She knows how he thinks. So again the writers dropping the ball.
@RoseBud9979 You're preaching to the choir. I'm saying the same thing .. the character can only do what is written, so the writing is uneven. I'm not trying to argue with you.
@RoseBud9979 IMO it is uneven for Liz. The only person she has any interaction with is Franco. 	Even he doesn't want her to see/speak to Jason. 	Even the writing for Jason isn't right.
