News: Trump lawyer John Dowd says claims Trump legal team is looking into pardon power are "nonsense" - legal team "cooperating" w Mueller
OJ Simpson is granted parole.
Awaiting decision on OJ parole. We will come back on for @NBCNews special report with decision.
OJ wipes away tears as Fromong says he would pick him up from prison if he got out tomorrow
"OJ is my friend" - Bruce Fromong, robbery victim
"I'm sorry" - OJ
"We just want him to come home.... I know that he is remorseful." - Arnelle Simpson
He's like my best friend and my rock - OJ's daughter Arnelle
Sure feels like parole board is headed toward letting OJ out. We shall see. Decision expected today.
"I've led a conflict free life" - OJ. (Cut to 911 calls of Nicole Brown Simpson pleading for help)
Some questionable judgment on OJ's part. An inch away from parole yet still litigating the crime. Antagonizing parole board?
"It was my property" says OJ - demonstrating misunderstanding the nature of crimes he is convicted of
"I had no weapon... I didn't threaten" says OJ, then says he is not making excuses
Not sure this recitation of the case is helping OJ.

"Release the tapes, I'm good with it" - Comey to Trump.
Former AG Lynch wanted Comey to call the HRC investigation a "matter" - which gave Comey a "queasy feeling" bc it tracked w HRC campaign
RT @NBCNews: JUST IN: Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's outside counsel, will deliver an on-camera statement following James Comey's testimo‚Ä¶
Serious question: why doesn't Congress just get the memos from Comey himself? He clearly has them in his possession.
@gramakre I'm relaying information - not saying what I personally believe
Comey doesn't give himself a pass for not standing up to POTUS immediately. Says he was at times "cowardly" and "not strong"
"Lordy I hope there are tapes" Comey says of his  conversations with Trump. Trump has hinted he has tapes.
Comey says he takes POTUS at his word that he was fired because of Russia investigation - referring to @LesterHoltNBC intvw with Trump
"I took it as direction" from POTUS to Comey to let Flynn matter go, even though Comey acknowledges Trump didn't use those words.
"What the president whispered in my ear was, 'I really look forward to working with you.'" - Comey on awkward hug meeting at WH
Why did Comey make memos of Trump interactions: "I thought he might lie" #ComeyHearing
KEY: Comey thought Trump "let it go" comments re Flynn were "disturbing" but not tantamount to a request to stop  Russia investigation
Did POTUS ask you to stop Russia investigation? Comey: No.
"The administration... chose to defame me" and said "those were lies" - #Comey

Roger Stone says the FBI hasn't contacted him in connection with the Russia collusion investigation.
When was last time Pres Trump spoke to Roger Stone? "Fairly recently" says Stone. WH claim that it had been months is not correct, he says.
Did Roger Stone tell @realDonaldTrump to fire Comey? His answer next on @TODAYshow @RogerJStoneJr
"Anything taking place hasn't changed," WH spox Huckabee Sanders indicates the Russia investigation into collusion keeps going @TODAYshow

@HDBtweets "gross negligence" IS (one of) the mens rea standards in 18 USC 793(f). CIVIL gross negligence is different - no mens rea there
@QuinHillyer mens rea is required in every criminal statute. In 793(f) two options for mens rea: intentional or gross negligence
@marlene_delisio that's ordinary negligence. Gross negligence is a higher bar
Comey doing Crim Law 101 here - "mens rea" etc
@JohnJHarwood yesssss good catch just corrected. But point remains - fine line between that and gross negligence required by statute?
Correction: "extreme carelessness" were Comey's exact words.  https://t.co/9IuCtB7W6U
@gneiss50 @WillieGeist not implying. Posing a Q. The potential "crime" (criminal statute) in question is 18 USC 793(f)
@GeorgetteMcClel willfulness (i.e. Intent to mishandle) not required for gross negligence
An interesting Q: why "extreme recklessness" (Comey's words) does not constitute "gross negligence" (statute) required for prosecution
Comey dismantles HRC oft-repeated statement that she never received/sent info "marked classified at the time." Argues she should've known.
@jmwhitlock in this case DOJ has announced it will accept FBI Recommendation. a little different here
