Today, @FCC adopted rules that will allow #consumers to choose how their ISP uses &amp; shares their personal data. #OpenMtgFCC
The bottom line of today’s privacy rulemaking is that it’s your data. How it’s used &amp; shared should be your choice.
At today’s #OpenMtgFCC, we took a significant step to safeguard consumer #privacy in this time of rapid technological change.
The industry-led Robocall Strike Force made some real progress but we are not there yet. Consumers expect results soon.
Consumer care deeply about stopping unwanted calls. I’m pleased the industry has taken real steps forward but we must keep pushing.
My analysis of the report from the industry-led Robocall Strike Force is now available here: https://t.co/1tRSa77Wsz
While I’m pleased with some of the progress made by the industry re robocalls &amp; spoofing, there’s much more that needs to be done.
I am grateful to all the Robocall Strike Force participants. We must continue this work until consumers see all the benefits they expect.
Looking forward to today’s reconvening of the industry-led Robocall Strike Force. Watch live at 1pm here: https://t.co/YbX13RDy3D

Today I wrote on @Medium re: impacts of #tech on accessibility, specifically for Americans w/ cognitive disabilities https://t.co/piPpFGLgmM
30 million Americans have cognitive disabilities, &amp; technology can help.
Accessibility needs to be baked into the development of consumer electronics &amp; services: https://t.co/DHIypcQqkc #a11y #AccessForAll @Medium

After all, it’s your data. Shouldn’t you have a say over how it’s used? https://t.co/IT3wLgbXHi
Rules wouldn’t prohibit ISPs from using/sharing customer information - they simply require ISPs to get customer permission.
In March, @FCC started proceeding to extend protections to info collected by ISPs. Our goal = consumer choice, transparency, security.
Proposed rules reflect extensive public comments &amp; align with other key privacy frameworks of FTC &amp; Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.
In today’s digital world, consumers deserve to have the tools to make informed choices about their online privacy: https://t.co/IT3wLgbXHi
Today I shared w/ my colleagues a proposal to give consumers meaningful choice &amp; keep data secure while encouraging innovation.
Yet there are no rules in place outlining how ISPs may use &amp; share their customers’ personal information. We need to close that gap.
Your ISP handles all your network traffic &amp; has a broad view of your online activity, including browsing history.
Today, I'm proud to announce the release of the @FCC’s very 1st White Paper on cognitive disabilities https://t.co/bQy8JC1bx0 #AccessForAll
If we don’t do everything possible to harness this #tech revolution to attack the challenges of individuals w/ disabilities then shame on us
.@Sen_JoeManchin – I look forward to it Senator. Thank you for being a leader on #rural connectivity issues. Excited to visit beautiful #WV.
Today, FCC extends streamlined foreign ownership procedures for common carriers to broadcast deals. #transparency #ProcessReform
Today, we moved to increase consumer access to diverse programming on pay-TV with new proposal. Thanks @MClyburnFCC for your leadership.
With these new WEA rules, we are taking action to make this life-saving service even more useful. #OpenMtgFCC
Enhanced WEA rules will help local public safety officials better meet the needs of their communities.
New Wireless Emergency Alerts will carry more info, be better targeted &amp; will soon be able to include embedded photo links.

By empowering consumers to access their content on their terms, watching TV &amp; video is about to get better &amp; cheaper. Let’s #unlockthebox.
Proposal ensures all copyright &amp; licensing agreements remain intact. Pay-TV providers will continue to oversee end-to-end content delivery.
These rules will open the door for innovation, spurring new apps and devices, giving consumers even more choice and user control.
One big consumer benefit will be integrated search, so you can search for pay-TV content alongside other sources of content.
Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to offer free apps that consumers can download to variety of devices to access content. 2/2
If proposal is adopted, consumers won’t have to rent set-top boxes month after month just to watch the programming they already pay for. 1/2
Today, I am sharing w/ FCC colleagues a plan to end the set-top box stranglehold &amp; monthly rental fees #unlockthebox https://t.co/MJ5LReZ47G

I expect the Robocall Strike Force to make real, significant progress on robocalls within the next couple months.
I’m pleased that phone companies are taking responsibility for meeting consumer needs re robocalls. We need results &amp; we need them soon.
We’ll kick off the Robocall Strike Force’s work later this morning. It’s  vital that carriers move quickly to offer robocall blocking tools.
Since the FCC took action, dozens of communities have taken steps to build their own bridges across the digital divide. (3/3)
.@FCC action highlighted the benefits of competition, need of communities to take their broadband futures in their own hands. (2/3)
Respecting the court’s decision, the fact remains forces against #competition try to keep local communities from competitive broadband (1/3)

.@iCanConnect1 provides #DeafBlind Americans with a vital connection to the world around them. And now the program isn’t going anywhere!
Our new hearing aid compatibility rules are an example of collaborative problem-solving to benefit consumers. #OpenMtgFCC
Making permanent a program as successful &amp; essential as @iCanConnect1 is a no-brainer &amp; I’m glad we completed that work today. #OpenMtgFCC
.@davidshepardson I’m not a betting man, but I’d say the odds are pretty good! #GoBucks #APTop100 @byersalex @AirWharton
We’re confident the full court would affirm FCC’s authority to enact #OpenInternet rules protecting consumers and innovation on the web.
It’s no surprise that the big dogs have challenged the court decision upholding @FCC’s strong #OpenInternet rules.

#Robocalls are currently the top consumer complaint to @FCC. #Consumers deserve meaningful control over the calls &amp; texts they receive
Individual phone companies have a responsibility to mitigate unwanted #robocalls for #consumers.
Last week, I wrote to carriers, calling on them to offer call-blocking services to their customers *now*: https://t.co/R5n9CgQ0qS
I applaud @ATT for committing to make robocall-blocking technology available to its customers, as I requested.

Next month, we’ll consider proposals to pave the way to 5G connectivity &amp; speed traditional phone service’s transition to better networks.
As #tech evolves, it’s @FCC’s job to support deployment of next-generation networks. At July Open Mtg, we’ll vote on proposals w/ that goal.
Thanks to @PressClubDC for hosting me to talk today about the nation's #5G future. My remarks: https://t.co/k4lBkS0RqZ
Industry is already gearing up to seize this opportunity. We must act today to pave the way the way to our #5G future.
If proposal is approved, US will be 1st to open high-band spectrum for #5G networks, opening door for US companies to be 1st out of gate.
Proposal is final piece of #5G spectrum puzzle to open up high-band airwaves, speed roll-out of next-gen networks &amp; redefine connectivity.
On Thursday, I’ll circulate proposed rules to identify &amp; open up vast amounts of spectrum for #5G applications. FCC will vote on July 14.
Fiber-fast wireless connectivity is key to long-sought goal of competitive high-speed internet access for consumers.  #5G
#5G will connect the Internet of Everything, with projections of hundreds of billions of microchip-enabled products.
As we’ve learned from the past, we can’t predict the innovation that can result from next-gen wireless networks. #5G
US leadership in #5G must be a national priority. Our technological future relies on low-latency, ultra-fast &amp; secure connectivity.
The next generation of wireless connectivity- the fifth generation or #5G -is essential to seizing the 21st century opportunities before us.

#Lifeline must evolve to meet today’s most pressing communications need: access to broadband.
Yesterday, we put forward a proposal to help close the #broadband affordability gap by modernizing the #Lifeline program.
#Affordability is still the largest single barrier to broadband adoption in low-income households. #Lifeline
Our #Lifeline proposal will mean more providers, new services &amp; more competitive choices for #consumers.
Read my joint blog w/ Commissioner @MClyburnFCC on closing the #broadband affordability gap by modernizing #Lifeline https://t.co/gMorHn18AQ
Today, @MClyburnFCC &amp; I proposed reducing barriers to #broadband adoption for low-income Americans https://t.co/UkKIwW8Gvi #LifelineReform
Thanks @MClyburnFCC for being a champion for Lifeline. Your efforts have helped low-income Americans afford #access to vital communications.
Our #LifelineReform plan both modernizes Lifeline to make #broadband affordable AND shuts the door on waste.

(3/3) #IncentiveAuction procedures proposal also enables broadcasters to harness economic potential of this high consumer demand.
(2/3) My proposed bidding procedures for #IncentiveAuction is balanced approach to help carriers meet growing demand for mobile bandwidth.
(1/3) #IncentiveAuction is highly complex and must meet multiple--and sometimes competing--objectives.
(4/4) This ensures all carriers have a shot at this critical resource, which is good news for consumers. http://t.co/Cr9lJC30Ws
(3/4) So, @FCC is taking an extraordinary step, reserving up to 30Mhz of high-quality spectrum for competitors in the #IncentiveAuction
(2/4) More competition in the wireless marketplace means lower prices, better service, and more innovation.
(1/4) Today, more than 70% of critical low-band spectrum is in the hands of just two providers
(3/3) New proposed reforms will ensure no one can game the system so bidding credits flow to small businesses and rural carriers
(2/3) Small businesses and rural carriers face barriers to accessing critical spectrum and need a boost to have opportunity to compete.
(1/3) I circulated a balanced proposal to modernize policies to increase small business participation in #FCCAuctions http://t.co/Cr9lJC30Ws
Today I shared auction-related proposals designed to promote competition in mobile marketplace. Details in my blog: http://t.co/Cr9lJC30Ws

RT @FCC: "It’s a red-letter day for consumers, innovators &amp; those who build and operate networks“ @TomWheelerFCC #FastFairOpen http://t.co/…
As technology continues to redefine marketplace, there will be something that did not exist yesterday - a referee on the field.#OpenInternet
Our dual responsibilities - to encourage investment and to protect consumers and innovation - can and will coexist. #NetNeutrality
We also have a responsibility to ensure broadband expands, gets faster &amp; more competitive. #FastFairOpen.
We won't micromanage or tell companies how to run their business, but it is our responsibility to throw the flag if there’s a foul.
We’ve said throughout the #NetNeutrality debate that we’re not as smart as the Internet &amp; we don’t want to get in the way of the Internet.
There have never been rules this extensive &amp; flexible. It’s a red-letter day for consumers, innovators &amp; those who build &amp; operate networks.
This is a big day. The @FCC's #OpenInternet rules, which have been long debated, are now live.
Our job isn’t done. We will continue to fight to ensure the Internet remains fast, fair and open for all Americans. #OpenInternet
Blocking, throttling, fast lanes &amp; other efforts to come between consumers and the Internet should now be things of the past. #OpenInternet
Today’s court decision means #OpenInternet rules will take effect Friday. It’s a good day for consumers and innovators! #netneutrality

Our modernization builds on and strengthens ongoing reforms, continuing to ensure Lifeline is effective, efficient, and a good value for all
Today, broadband is necessary for full participation in society. The current divide between digital "haves" and "have-nots" is unacceptable.
For 30 yrs Lifeline has ensured all Americans access to the opportunities that phone service brings. Today's opportunities require broadband
Today, I’m proposing that we reboot the @FCC Lifeline program to ensure all Americans can access the tremendous benefits of broadband.
Thank you to @MClyburnFCC for your tireless leadership. We are building on the foundation you laid to ensure all Americans have access.
My proposed consumer protection rulings are outlined in this fact sheet: https://t.co/nwFm3kiSfT
