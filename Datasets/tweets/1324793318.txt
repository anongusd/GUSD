@DottzGaming Hey about the PVP warden build is there an alternative to Necro? I have really bad motor control and keeping the pet up is sometimes a pain for me.
@TooFarGon @official_DNL Well if it cant be fixed y'all are more then welcome to make a home on the Glass Bottle Generator PvE servers :)
@realDonaldTrump What a load of junk.
@realDonaldTrump What a joke, if you didn't do shit wrong stop tweeting about it. Your just creating propaganda for your base.
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie, dems want fair borders,  less wealth inequalities, and better social programs.
@am77933250 @GOP @GOPChairwoman But...net nutraility was appealed. They can hide or remove or rank low what ever they want.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Lol! Your FCC got rid of net neutrality, they can do w.e they want.
@mike03car @snidgen @RepWalberg Honestly this is pretty true.
@RepJohnDuncanJr @CalThomas What a load of junk, especially considering Democratic socialism is very different to full blown socialism.

https://t.co/DFEbahkp6n	 Remember to always look up information you learn from any media source before you belive it. The link above is a great example of prapagand by the Sinclare Corporation.		Facts are still facts even if you regardless of your opinion.	@realDonaldTrump #trump
@eturner010 @Education4Libs @standswith45 I understand, it's reprehensible. Think about this the comments like these tweets, make it harder for these individual's to seek help which encourages an even more reprehensible act to occur. It's important for individuals who feel this to feel safe enough to seek treatment.
@Education4Libs @standswith45 So you really have no understanding on this issue. Pedophilia is a mental illness, and the therapies that we have for it actually work. It's one of the most researched therapy we have. Please go read about a topic before you post about it.
@charliekirk11 @KyleKashuv @TPUSA @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @JesseBWatters @nikkihaley @Scavino45 Wow look at all those white people
@RepKenBuck Your joking right? We don't produce enough food to feed America's population.
https://t.co/5rq4NKHQGq		@GOP #Congress #Trump 		Why?
@standswith45 just Learned something new! https://t.co/tJnOQKV6Ej		Now I know you don't like the source but I suppose you could look up information if you wanted.
@GOP This is lie, a few cent over the course of years does not count.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump What money did he give?
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Something else I just thought about it Obama used economic pressures to punish NK. Don't forget that.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I agree with you on that point, point but it's how he handles it and he appears that he does not listen to his advisors at all. That bothers people as well. We know he can do better but it just seem like he doesn't want too.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump The photo is about his own people, the meeting is about the world stage. There have been "secret" oils drop supplied by Russia and China according to what I have heard by buying over the black market. Also if I'm not mistaken this upticked after the meeting occurred.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump On the geopolitical stage this is how it works. Country's typically follow ques based on the policys of other country's. You wouldn't want to deal with a country that is a adversary of a power like the U.S unless the u.s was ok with it u less you wanted to be punishes by the U.S
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I'm not saying that's how it would play out, I'm saying that was the fear about how trumps handled the whole situation and why is was criticized for it.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump This also signals that it might be ok for other nations to deal with them legitimate way.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump This is a perception thing. According to previous American policy they did not recognize NK as a nation and refused to treat them as such, country's typically follow America's lead on this. Having a meeting like that with the U.S means they are now considered a nation state.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Your going to have to explain this a bit more.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I learned this lesson a long time ago in school. Ignore the name calling, the bullying all of it if your in the right. You will be exonerated at the end of the day. The investigation is not into Trump himself why do conservatives belive that? Because of 1 bad Apple?
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump If You know your not in the wrong then so be it! Let the fool's think your wrong and ignore them.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Countries think about him, I do care that he doesn't care about what his own country thinks about him. The current perception is what is important. He needs to change how American perceive him and he refuses. Be the bigger person ignore  the Stuff you think is BS and keep working
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I don't hate Donald himself, I hate his policys really dealing with social issues, I hate his behavior, I hate that he doesn't care how he is perceived, I can honestly say if he ran under a democratic platform I would have voted for him. I love that he doesn't care what other
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump It's more about prapagand for his people than anything else, he also got the join exersices to stop as well.  Don't forget that, those were considered by generals to be extremely important for cordnation purpas.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump This is not an enbarsement. This occurred all accross the world. Last year.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump You are aware that the British Intelligence community are the ones who told us about the elections interference and they have evidence that they also interfered in the brexit referendum right? This also occurred in countries that are just recently admitted to NATO.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Trump ignored all that advice and then not a weak later our Intellgenice Agency's reported that the nuclear program began to accelerate right after that and now NK is doing their own stuff again ignore the U.S.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump My biggest grumble about the NK thing is that he didn't get signed agreements, a solid time line, a binding agreement according to national law. It was believed by current and past experts that Kim just wanted the propaganda of having the American President sit down with him.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump We just disagree with this, I do believe the DNC cheated/ fixed the primary election for Hillary. But I don't not belive they tried to fix the actual national elections. Now every one expected Hillary to win sure, but Russia interfered to help Trump according to all intelligence
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Again he has already explained why he did what he did. Most Dems are mad that Trump won I won't deny that. But I'm be honest if it's a witch hunt the let it be, he will be cleared and his approvals will skyrocket. I'd  rather know 100% he is clear the leave it up to a maybe.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump Maybe he did think Hillary was going to win and she would take care of it, but Trump won. Which is fine but I know that the right would have jumped off a cliff claiming that dictator or usurper. I can't see any other way this could be handled without the fall out being worse.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump How else would you handle it? The shear amount of Bots that Twitter alone has found is in the millions alone, that excluded all other social media networks. This would have taken forever to sort out for Obama, and I am sure epically given what we know now.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump That's not what I'm talking about. If Obama has to put the elections on hold because of the interference in general. How would republicans have reacted?
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I agree, but she is never going to run again. I can almost guarantee that. No Democrat is going to vote for her cept for her die hard fans and their are not that many. What this comes down too is new federal laws on political parties are needed to limit their own power.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump What would you and every other Republican say? I can almost guarantee they would riot because no elections would have taken place until the investigation would have concluded. Which going off the current time table is atleast 2 years. Republicans would have a cow or two.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump So let me ask you this if Obama came out in the middle of the elections and said Russia is interfering in the elections as president I will take steps to stop the elections from being influenced as a result I have to put the elections on hold until we figure out how to.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I'm not saying your wrong, but NEC and DNC are not bound by and federal laws when it comes to choosing a candaite. They can pick whoever they want no matter what the primary outcome is atleast to my understanding. I'm not saying it's ethical.
@standswith45 @Laureen4Trump I'm not saying it's not worth looking at. I'm saying the whole reason it's a big deal is because she is unregistered. A reason it's a big deal is Trumps apparent weak spot for Punit compaired to our own allies or other adversaries.  What exactly do you want to find on Clition?
@Laureen4Trump @standswith45 This is stupid. The reason the current issue dealing with the undocumented spy is an issue is because she was undocumented not because she is a spy. You can be a "spy" in the U.S if you register as a forgin agent. You can even meet with Congressman and presidents if registered.
@WISD0MTREE @8_Bit_Bobby @Everytown @SenSchumer One day we will figure out this whole gun thing.
@WISD0MTREE @Everytown @SenSchumer Thanks for the info
@SenatorBurr Temporary jobs are useless. Jobs that offer living wage pay with benefits are the only thing that will lift Americans out of poverty.
@Everytown @SenSchumer What is a ghost gun blueprint?
@GOP This is not about left or right of politics. It's about ensuring every American has affordable access to health care. A bill for 70,000 for surgery to save your life condemns you to no life at all. You can not have life and liberty if you just drown dept in order to live.
Is there anyone who can site sources to these claims? I can't seem to find any. https://t.co/1skFyw0zEC
@mattduss Can someone sit sources and link to the claim? I can not seem to find any?
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/1J4Qxxv4rt		As Americans we must be wary of all propaganda. Please ensure that all information you consume is nonpartisan and can be verified by facts no matter your party, belifes or options. Facts are still facts regardless of your opinion.
@RepJackBergman So a few extra cents a day.. worthless.
@childsb @leslienward @bcrabbe03 @mike_pence @VoteMarsha Can y'all give me some examples just so people reading this understand? Also if y'all have any numbers that compares the U.S too your countrys current set up?
@childsb @bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha Here is my question for you, what exactly do you have to wait for? Be specific if you can.
@bcrabbe03 @childsb @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha The artical you posted is basicly saying how the ACA failed. I'm looking for a Canadian think tank that reviews their health care system
@bcrabbe03 @childsb @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha https://t.co/q6siT04pZt
@bcrabbe03 @childsb @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha Let me give you her biography. 		https://t.co/JZ0BZyN63A		Just a blurb she is a right of the Isle think tank director. 		I'm going to ask you site neutral references that only look at the data.
@MWZH1 @JohnRLottJr @KyleKashuv T	So we have two ways we can help fix the mass shooting problems in America limit guns and harden targets or harden targets and government provide free mental health care. These are the only two options. Now we know that most republicans in power will refuse both.
@bcrabbe03 @childsb @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha Well every other developed country begs to differ.
@SpeakerRyan He is actually not wrong for once.
@JohnRLottJr @iowaguns @KyleKashuv Didn't think about that, so the language needs to change is what your saying?
@seeyouseeme6 @RepAdamSchiff That's what I want to know?
@iowaguns @JohnRLottJr @KyleKashuv They said weapons of war that is a bit different. As a Liberal, Independent, Democratic person I could never agree to anything that band hunting weapons and hand guns.
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Now obviously not all business could do this of course because they sent a huge corporation's. But the majority of employees that make net profits in the billions could in fact do this without tax brakes.
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Go up the 5$ it needs to for every established employee and incoming employee to hit the 15.i7 according to MIT.
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats According to Forbes Wal-Mart tax bakes. Its us Tax pays 6.7 billion. Almost all of Wal-Mart employees are on food stamps which is another few billion. It just does not add up. None of the math does. Now I'm not saying wages won't go up but for people who need them to go wont
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Still 5$ bellow the living wage line for America and they still made 9 billion last year in profits. If they were to invest 1 billion of that info better health care and another billion into wages it would be a huge impact. In fact according to Forbes Wal-Mart tax brakes
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats If the economy was run by robots absolutely I would agree with this, but it's not. The majority of high earners do not want to let go of the wealth they have. Wal-mart for example has a net profit of 9 billion last year. They brought their minimum wage up to 10$.
@standswith45 @KayaJones Also I didn't know this but apparently his parents where imagrents it looks like that came to America became naturalized citizens.
@standswith45 @KayaJones https://t.co/NERtsy9GdE		This was the only site I found about it, there are allot of other sits that sat "Obama joking swipes at brirther believers with I am the first Kenyan president" so maybe it was a pun or maybe there are two videos not sure
@standswith45 Well honestly I don't pay attention to anything that doesn't affect the political landscape. Trumps actions in Charlotte are part of why these people are coming out of the wood work. Especially the white supremistis. I'm not saying he is, just he words seem to have led to it.
@standswith45 @KayaJones It's doctored audio, i don't have a link. You would have to Google it.		The elections office that runs the presdentatioal elections would have never allowed him to run if he was. Please have a bit more faith in the offices that normal people work in just to get paid and go home.
@standswith45 Nope, it's stupid Idc who he sleeps with if he does the job right.
@KayaJones @standswith45 This has been debunked many times.
@bcrabbe03 @childsb @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha May I have a link Please?
@JohnRLottJr @KyleKashuv One Dem does not mean all Dems want this. One bad apple does not mean all are bad apples.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha And that better way is when as a country we commit to every American being able to get health care without needing to sell a kidney to fix a heart.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha I as an American as a human being got a bill for $75,000 for say heart surgery I would have just told them to let me die because I would never actually live a life after that bill came in. That is the cost of a home of a second home of a business that I could buy
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha No the ACA was horrible but not because the original creators made it horrible because when it went to Congress it was greatly altered.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha That did not work before the ACA and it won't work now.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha On the internet and ask them how their Health Care system works see what they say not all of them can be lying
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha so in Canada Canadians choose which doctors they go to which they do not want medicines they can take they have the exact same rights if not more rights to their health care then we do you can Google on Wikipedia how their healthcare system works you can reach out to Canadians
@realDonaldTrump Just because there was Russian hacking does not mean you had to collude with them, and it doesn't make your Presidency any less vaild. 	Facts you disagree with are still facts regardless of your opinion.
@realDonaldTrump Facts you disagree with are still facts regardless of your opinion.
@AMike4761 @define521 Yep and we just lost 10 kids to a mass shooting in may and countless more before then. What's your point? Native born people or forgin people all have bad apples we are all humans.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha According to https://t.co/deU6IyPhaz we would spend 600 billion dollars less then we did in 2015 of we had it on 2015. I'm sorry but I have seen very little data that supports the claim that we can't afford it.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha If we put controls on pharmaceutical prices by allowing Univeral Care to negotiate for better prices someone the APA doesn't  allow. We will send less on care.	We currently spend 553 billion on Medicare and programs associated with it. So we already have half a trillion ready.
@bcrabbe03 @leslienward @mike_pence @VoteMarsha This makes no sense. According to https://t.co/dFdhFAqIUw U.S spent 3.3 trillion on healthcare. According to https://t.co/QYEmG13SMn we pay 9k per person vs. 4k in the UK. If we removed Medicare and all associated programs and replaced it with Univeral Care. Please see next tweet
@thingamadamit @RepValDemings Just how does that make sense  Exactly? Idk about other states but when I regesterd I had to proved my social, my drivers ID and proof that lived in the district. 		This whole idea that people who don't have a SSN can register is absurd and anyone allows it to happen goes to jail
@RepMcKinley 15k over 10 YEARS that like give a pore person a extra 5 cents a day...
@harold4vicki @DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin I agree!
@RealCandaceO @FBI Pretty sure people are not seeing the other tweet dealing with this.
@harold4vicki @DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin I will agree that the government should allow for policys that don't stiffle growth but protect envierments.
@harold4vicki @DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin Any major pallutin effects more then those in its immediate eniverment. It's a federal issue, the government's job is ensureing life &amp; liberty. People cant have life if those polultins cause death. You can't participate in liberty if you are to sick to do so.
@christylemon @joe_progressive @FaceTheNation @SenSanders @margbrennan This is ignorant. As a citizen you are actually angry that he voted his belifes and what he was elected for.
@harold4vicki @DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin So the Goverment has to apply the regulations to the whole industry. Atleast from my understanding.
@harold4vicki @DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin Your not wrong, and I agree with you. However how would that work out legally? I'm not sure it's legal to put a law into effect for 1 Specific plant or even a few. To my understanding corpations have the same rights as people and can't be unfairly targeted by the government.
@DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin Your not wrong but we can't control those things. We should try to control the things that we can to prevent negative effects caused by such enivermontal hazards.
@StuartPadiso @VP @POTUS I think you seem to misunderstand the point he is making. 		It's not really about the money it's about how this whole situation can be rectified by properly taking and spending our nations incomm. 		Why would you not more people with more money to spend more money?
@VP That does not help if wages cant meet a living wage criteria.		The government poverty line just measures when someone qualifies for benefits not a basic income required to afford basic things such as housing, food, power.ect		People can be employed but not make enough to live on.
@DisturbedMiles @SenatorDurbin Just because your area didn't have problems does not mean other did not. 		It's time for American citizens to stop just looking at their direct surrounding for why a response may have been warranted.
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Or financial protections. This would take us backwards not forwards. Allot of what Trump is doing is working but it's generally creating lower wage jobs that don't make the living wage criteria just the poverty line criteria.
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Tax cuts historically create short term low wage jobs. This is not inharnelty a bad thing but it needs to be culpled with a multilayered approach across the bord. Such as reducing regulations to streamline the process for business without remove enivermontal protections
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats The current poverty line which is the measure the U.S government uses to determine who get welfare programs and who does not is 15k a year rounded. 	The means that if a person on welfare could find a job they would make to little to support themselves  to get off the programs
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats This is not the failing of these programs it the failings of the current economic conditions. Even today we have a mire jobs then workers but those jobs do not pay a wage that supports a family. 		According to MIT the living wage for the U.S was 15.87$ a hour for 1 adult and kid
@TL38227608 @RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats Historically welfare programs do work. Most people who go on food stamps and welfare do get off of it within a year according to the data I last read. A problem we have faced in the last 15 years is people on these programs can't find jobs that bring them up to a living wage.
@godspatriot @PattyMurray Your stament is social or maybe even religious response. This has nothing to do policy.		 We could also prevent single mothers in general with proper birth control and education from an early age sex education.
@RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats This is ignorant. Historically both parties are at fault for compounding the problems marginalized community's have. Its no one person's fault or a party's fault. Its due to a broken system based on archaic notions of how crime works and factors that contribute to it. Data works.
@rockytopinfl @RepValDemings @HouseDemocrats But it should be. No one should have to work tell they are 70 or 80 and then struggle to live even more after that. It's absurd.
@RealCandaceO @FBI Finance rules. They could care less about the hush money.
@RealCandaceO @FBI I need to point out that the special counsel found this information during his current investigation and handed this information to local state officials. They are now handling that, I also like to point out that the only part of this event their investigating is for election
@SueLawr30382612 @realDonaldTrump There is still no proof that he is illegitimate.		He is sexist, and misogynist. 		It's important take facts into account.
@SueLawr30382612 @realDonaldTrump It's very important that we really look at everything Donald does with a lense of facts.		The fact is male's humans are biologically programmed to spread as much seed as they, and most American cheat at some point.		Paying for sex is also common around the world.
@Giacchino003 @GOP @realDonaldTrump These are the median wages for those jobs. 		This political posturing is really dividing people either because of lack of understanding the subject or  party politics.
@Giacchino003 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I agree, and I am not a expert either. However I am a proponent of clear non partisan data.		 In my opinion it should be illegal for Public servants and political parties to frame the data in anyway then what the data says. That means that we added x amount of jobs this quart and
@Giacchino003 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Also I agree 100% less is better then none at all. But as citizens we need to look at the data and see what it actually means. In this particular report 1000$ give or take a month is not enough to live on in any state.
@Giacchino003 @GOP @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/N99ywWmzTt		Took me a second to find it.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump There are more jobs but all of these jobs are of less quality. Meaning that these new jobs pay less and require people to work more then one to make basic needs. Economist can tell you this from the data.
@VP @POTUS @KristinFisher This isseueis the only issue i can agree with @VP on.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Undersired jobs like fast food cooks, field workers and such.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Yah the late 90s kids are a bit like that and I agree with that over all assement. But i still don't feel like it's an excuse to make bad policy descions when it comes to growth. If I may ask what field are you in? Most of the time I have worked with illegal immigrants was in
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Of the average human life expectancy.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I am 28 or 29 don't remember but I have never made more the 20k my whole life even with full time work. I am in school now to try and do something better as someone who has seen a bit of everything. I feel as though there are better ways than just barely scraping by for 1/4
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump My question is what age are these millennials you are talking about?
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Salaries for new jobs created you just can pay it off and live. 		Discloser I did not look up the exact number for student load dept average pretty sure this was the last number I heard. 		This is just 1 example however of bad policy across the board and we have no way to fix it.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Median wage of new jobs created is bettwen 15 - 25 thousand a year. That is far bellow or right at the poverty line. In order to fix that we went to school. I belive that the average student loan dept currently is something 45 thouands with 5% interests or so. With current jobs
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump That it was previous generations responsibility to ensure that I at the very least had a chance at a respectable life above the poverty line. Many of the policys put into place from all party's have hindered that. Student loan debt right now is absurd and the current average
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump The one thing I disagree with is this notion of nothing being given to us. This is something of a divide between millennials and older generation's. As a millennial myself I have never felt or known anyone of the same age that felt like I was owed anything I did however feel
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I was in school when the pledge was a thing, in my opinion you don't need the pledge to be American or even feel American. Vocational programs of value that lead to reduction in income disparity we have now need to be brought back.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump They are ready to obstructed  for many reasons Americans outside politics would. There are to many uncertainties to allow any nomnie of any party in on anything. Wish people would really understand that. If you knew someone might be a thief would you hire their friend for a job?
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I agree and I would think they would be doing more to get the populace motivated about voting as a whole honestly. But most people are only thinking about themselfs when it comes to policy which is the wrong way to do it in my opinion.
@marcorubio @USouthFlorida This is true. Anyone outside of the intelligence agency's and military would have never known nor asked the question.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I feel like the internetage has made us feel allot older then we are.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump It's alright I'm very new to this too. I still call the pound symbol the pound symbol. Oh god showing my age lol.
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Alright I understand what your saying. Then how would you prefer they protest? 		I would like to say the American flag means allot of different things to allot of different people and those meaning are not nesccarly exclusive to each other. 		Also thank you for enlightening
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I apologize I don't know that GMA is, may I ask what it is?
@standswith45 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump However burning the flag is an established way of protests and others have protested this way before the NFL. While I do understand you feelings behind your line of thought. Historically their is presadent.
@thebradfordfile @standswith45 @realDonaldTrump So why is this not considered free speech for Conservatives and Republicans?
@realDonaldTrump If I'm not mistaken it would be a violation of their right to freedom of speech if that was in the contract. I could be wrong however. 		NFL players are not the only people who have protested this way throughout history. I would encourage anyone to look into it.
@Paulthemodest @Kevmacd @KevinBa84595353 @realDonaldTrump I belive he did however this could also be strategy for negotiations with Russia. This line of thought makes sense because you still want them to have a dialog. However he has made mistakes in how he has represented that possible line of thought PR wise.
@RalpHenderson @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @realDonaldTrump Your not wrong but it is the responsibility of the citizen to ensure the facts and information they are getting are correct. Don't ever listen to one media outlet or ones that only say what you want to hear.  		Facts are still facts even if you disagree or don't like the facts.
@Kevmacd @KevinBa84595353 @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure that some of those box should be checked for either of them because Congress did them.
@realDonaldTrump Facts even if you dislike or disagree with them are still facts. 		Also just because Russia influenced the election does not make you a illegitimate President. Please stop thinking like that.
@cattinks @sen This is not necessarily incorrect. Jobs number are down, but the jobs that are open and avaible are would make the applcatnts overqualified and underpaid or not provide a large enough income to support themselves.
@marcorubio 	The Cosponsored bill for automatic sanctions needs to be enacted right away not if or when it happens again.
@HawkInOKC @realDonaldTrump Wait is that a really a thing? Trout fliping out like that?
@SenateGOP @bostonherald As an American  Citizen I ask for him to be respectful but vastly vetted.
@1mudpuppy1 @ABC That is correct.
@fresnobetty @ABC It is important as American citizens we that we recognise that all information can be engineered. As American citizens we must look for the information from multiple sources across the entire media spectrum. Facts are still fact even if you disagree with them. No matter the party
@SenSanders #congress 	It is time for Sanders and Congress  to start working on a bill for job training for the information age. Automation will kill these jobs in 5 -10 years.
@MarkWarner #Congress It is very clear Congress knows nothing of actual happenings in U.S policy. 		A law requiring Presidential discloser after privet meetings with forgin dignitaries so Congress can govern? Not sure if Congressional power is allowed to do that however.
Why is this ok? https://t.co/Ls1u6HzMno
According to The Guardin Time Line  the official announcement did not come to light until the 9th of November at 11:40am/4:40pm depending on time zone. Now this could be her being over excited or it could be something else entirely. https://t.co/Hk7kTmUqfN
Assuming this is correct for what reason is it ok for China to spy when Trump is in office but not when other Presidents are in office? Can someone please explain this to me in a non-Politics manner? https://t.co/f7EZPUrNCO
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS Power to get anything done, which was not his fault. This is also not Trumps fault but just like Obama he had to deal with the job. Respectively dealing with allies is not hard or to much to ask.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS They would a fresh out of school collage grad being given a the keys to the company. Allot of people would feel some kind of way. But inretrospect conservatives did the same thing to Obama all 8 years. Almost nothing of Obama's passed Congress, he had to extend the presidents
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS Honestly Trump has one thing that he lacks that even Arnold Schwarzenegger has more of then him, and that's experience. I do feel like that IF he ran for another position of government before president he would have less pushback then he does now. Allot of people view him like
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS Now here is one thing I want to point out. Most of thing people hate about Trump are his conduct, and the Republican party. The way republicans treat allot of social justice issues are absurd.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS I don't think traditionally any one Democrat hates Trump we just disagree on nearly every policy point he has. 		Environmental Policy	Social Rights	Social Goverment Programs	Climate Change	Banking Regulation	Energy Policy	Gun Laws	Abortion		The list just goes on.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS Honestly didn't know this actually happend and agree with you on that.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS If your talking about the summit Trump was a complete sub when it came to Punit according to his body language. I'm not saying he is or was but judging entirely from body language he seemed Sub.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS Who bowed to who? Are you talking about Iran and Obama?
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS China and Russia. That is just money in their pockets. This is no longer a world where one country can survive on its own any longer. The U.S cant produce all of the food it needs to feed itself. Most of our electronics basic building materials come from ore in China.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS The language he used needs to be different, it needs to be respectful. If that is the case we need to stop buying stuff from China it just gives them U.S dollars to spend. The same goes for oil for the middle East and Russia. A very large portion of the food produce come from
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS That is the exact time to do it. I want Punit to know unless you bow you get no help from us.
@VettingBernie @RepHastingsFL @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader Can I have a link regarding Bernie taking money from NRA please?
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS If that is the case he really need to let some people know so half or more of the country is not freaking out over what looks like our biggest fear of having a puppet in the presidency. I am not saying he is but this summit really made it look like that atleast too me.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS The other thing that really bothers me as a citizen is that he refuses to denounce Russia for the election campaign and during his first "correction" to the summit he actually crossed out anything dealing with that. Which I can't understand why other then a negoation tactic and
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS But it's not about the reset it's about how it being handled. It's about the language he uses. It's about how he just berated NATO allies about money. Yes they need to pay agreed terms however he could have done that in a way that was no so brillopad like.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Im just as pissed about that and it is absolutely something that needs to be illegal. However trumps elecrions director just announced that they will now longer require campaign donor information to be tracked. So now everything will be anonymous which is not great.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders If you mean can't be bought as in special interests using donations to influence what he does in office then I hope you have looked into who donated to his campaign. Then look at what he has done policy wise. I think their will be a Sharp contrast this occurs across the spectrum.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders @POTUS I mean I don't totally disagree with you, but the entire reason it started like it has recently is because of his statements at the joint conference with Putin and he has continually walked those statements back or made corrections.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders The original lead investigator was a bad apple however you can't ignore the recent news inditments that are in fact finding evidence of Russian influence within the election. The Special Council is solely for that purpose atleast last time I checked.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders I can't believe that the hundreds of people all working on the case can feel that way. On Top of that most FBI agents are traditionally conservative and Muller is a Republican through and through and has done many investigations of this type and scale before.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Oh I see I was wrong. Even if that is the case Mueller is a Republican and would have gone back over such things. I would hope!
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Not because they did effect the probe. Also if I remember correctly Mueller was the one who revealed the texts to the public. When the hearing took place last week I think Congress under oath could get nothing from the man. Before this as far as I know he had spotless integrity.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders If the people that where in charge of the investigation had the outstanding record that the Special Council has, I would question my friend. His was discharged from the investigation as soon as those texts came to Muellers attention. He was discharged to protect the probe
@BradleyWoolsey @BrianCox_gab_ai @JMachayo @SenSanders Sorry but as soon as I Google him "a conservative radio talk show host" he is not without bias. NPR as a whole especially the political podcasts shows have allot of different views on Trump and his policys.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders But honestly I'm not sure Congress has the power to do that to the President. Il have to google.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders I don't see why this is to much to ask. The investigation should be completed by spring of next year at the rate it's moving. If he is cleared great, if he is not damage to the country would me minimized at the very least.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders We can't impeach without evidence but Clition was removed from office for a Blow Job. Currently Trumps appearance of being guilty keeps going up. Honestly in my opinion should temparly bar him from interacting with Ruissa at a national level until the investigation is completed.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders It's fishy, also the smear campaign against the Special Councle investigation is fishy. If you have nothing to hide let them investigate when they find nothing your in the clear. But most of the conservative media and Trump himself keeps up the smear campaign.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders At this point I belive it is. Today information came out about the fact that apparently Trump knew about the Russia campaign two weeks before the election. If this is the case he should have made a statement. Made it public, but instead he keeps denying anything actually happend
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders This is a tweet i said to another person regarding Russia. "That does not mean you bow out to a dictator. It means you stand firm be respectful but give no ground on issues you disagree on, and make ground on those you do."
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Every president or former public representive that I have seen information on dealing with money they make from speeches has been assured amount. The Clintons are not the only one who do this.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Saying Russia is the big bad is a mistake. Russia could be a effective Ally, but the actions they take from an American values point of view do not align with the U.S but that doesn't mean we stop talking or make agreements that are completely against our vaules.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders I will not deny that. But given the shear amount of agency's involved with getting the deal approved I would find it hard to believe that Clition herself could get the entire deal approved by her self.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders The uranium itself are in mines in the ground in 2 states. The connection between the Clinton foundion donation and the uranium deal where handled by 2 different people. However it does look fishy however this entire deal had to be authorized by a multitude of different agency's
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders If I remember the last press conferences correctly or it maybe after he left office it was decided the next president should take up the problem. He didn't want it to look like he was meddling in the election. Convective media looked at him like a dictator from my perspective.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Years later while she was Secratery of State. Once the federal regulatory  agencies approved buying of up to 51% of the shares this is when shit it the fan in certain media circles. One key thing that was missed in most reporting was that Ruissa cant export Uranium out of the U.S
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Full Disclosure I dont like her either, I also know very little about this, so I had to read up on it. From my short reading it looks as though a Russian company bought shares of a U.S company, a few years before this, then attempted to take a bit over 51% of the shares.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Effective in what way? So far his reduction in regulations are his only real success at least that I have seen. What are you considering a successes for him?
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Thats true for some. Most I have spoken to dislike him because of his behavior. I dislike him, but some of his policys make sense atleast the general idea behind them. However how he achieves these goals is just as important as achieving them. The ends don't justify the means.
@kylerkinnear @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders What do you mean by independent media? Link?
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Something is just not right. I would love a great relationship with Russia as an American. But not the way he is doing it.
@standswith45 @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders The shear fact that he will not denounce Russia's for the campaign on U.S elections, when corrected his statement he crossed out anything dealing with saying Russia was at fault. When he was correcting his statement "it could be others" came out right after his correction.
@FireGoddessB @BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders Your not wrong about that.
@BradleyWoolsey @JMachayo @SenSanders If you read anything other then conservative media you would know why. Try NPR they are extremely neutral when it comes to their reporting.
@SenWarren I almost never get on here, but as a representative of America can you please apply pressure too your fellow colleagues. Trump must be stopped.
@SenSanders I almost never get on here, but Bernie as a representative of America can you please apply pressure too your fellow colleagues. Trump must be stopped.
@JFH23 @SenatorHeitkamp That does not mean you bow out to a dictator. It means you stand firm be respectful but give no ground on issues you disagree on, and make ground on those you do.
@GHalbgewachs @kpoulsen @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump Basicly they did not allow the FBI in directly. They hired a privet firm to investigate. The privet firm then turned over the info most likely at the direction of the DMV themselfs.
