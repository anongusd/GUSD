I recently identified six crises that we should be focusing on rather than on Trump’s faux crisis at the border. Herewith, at a reader’s urging, my attempt to offer sensible solutions to these pressing problems. My @PostOpinions column: https://t.co/3JcCVf3EM3
Many gun regulations have overwhelming support but haven’t passed because of the NRA’s stranglehold on the GOP. An assault-weapon ban is more controversial but also necessary; there is no excuse for civilians to possess weapons of war. My column: https://t.co/3JcCVf3EM3
Even with a carbon tax, the government will still need to subsidize the transition to green technologies. Sorry, Republicans: this means some version of the Green New Deal. Sorry, progressives: renewable energy isn’t enough. My @PostOpinions column: https://t.co/3JcCVf3EM3

Trump repeatedly honored the heroes of World War II, producing some of the night’s best moments. But his own foreign policy is named after the isolationist movement of the 1930s that opposed battling the Nazis. My @PostOpinions column: https://t.co/uNxI7W7toK
Trump’s SOTU was not a great speech—he can no more deliver a great speech than his bargain-basement aides can craft one—but it was greatly revealing. What it showed is how little his views have in common with what used to be known as conservatism. My take: https://t.co/uNxI7W7toK

Good advice! https://t.co/my33L8gFBv
Two things jump out: Trump’s sense of victimhood and entitlement. He literally said he’s entitled to good coverage from ⁦@nytimes⁩ because he’s from New York! https://t.co/SFZmicpv5v
It doesn’t undermine the collusion case against the campaign. I think the evidence of campaign collusion is strong and growing (eg Stone, Manafort filings). Issue has been whether you can prove Trump’s personal involvement. Phone call from Jr would have helped to do so. https://t.co/s10uOuuWA7
It undermines the case because phone records are hard evidence. If Trump Jr had a private conversation with Trump Sr, it would almost certainly require testimony from one of them to substantiate it--and that's unlikely. https://t.co/utRTPcNnAf
I'm fascinated by the anger about my tweet. I DIDN'T say that Trump had been exonerated of collusion much less obstruction. But we need to follow the facts and admit that sometimes--rarely--the evidence favors Trump. Follow the facts--don't succumb to conspiracy theories. https://t.co/7E7f2mKWPG

One of the common conclusions after the confrontation on the Mall involved the dangers of overreacting and getting caught up in a rush to judgment online. Yet the Twitter mob continues to rage on, because that is the nature of social media. My column: https://t.co/3R9j0xUMuJ

Very true. And having some US presence on the ground can help us to understand what’s going on rather than simply dropping bombs from afar. https://t.co/yTNbZ4NkxJ
We did have a substantial SOF presence before the government collapsed and the Houthis took over a lot of the country. https://t.co/bVuFy0Xn8h
Civilian casualties from air strikes typically go up when US troops are withdrawn because we don’t have our own troops with “eyes on” the target. https://t.co/fDkCeOUpq5
Part of the reason foreign terror attacks have been stopped is that US military and intel are forward deployed, disrupting terrorist sanctuaries. Much harder to be effective from “over the horizon,” esp since removal of US forces also means removal of most of the IC presence. https://t.co/vwzfHQ526I
There's a typo in your tweet. Think you meant to say "Russian airstrikes." https://t.co/dNbHIWwVgk
Ok, how many troops do you favor? We can debate numbers. But are you in favor of 100% pullout as Trump wants? That’s what I was arguing against. Hard to do CT if country is collapsing. Look at Yemen. https://t.co/lnIS4DPtIg

Uh, this rebuttal has nothing to do with the wars in Syria and Afghanistan, which is what the article was about. I cited the Indian Wars in one sentence simply to point out that guerrilla wars can be lengthy and seldom have clearcut resolution. But carry on being outraged. https://t.co/bEA81Kf1wG

US troops in Afghanistan and Syria aren’t carrying out war crimes. They are preventing them. ISIS and Taliban are among worst war criminals on earth. https://t.co/MUFkHq78E3

Yet again: It’s called an analogy. I wasn’t suggesting US troops fight with muskets or ride horses. Just as I wasn’t suggesting they commit war crimes.

I’ll grant it’s not an effective analogy since it does seem to be distracting, at least in some quarters, from my actual point, which is that the big-war mindset of seeking a quick victory and exit isn’t appropriate in a war against insurgents. https://t.co/dx8Bpbp3ZX

There are precious few countries in the world where a sitting leader can be investigated by law enforcement authorities on the principle that no person is above the law. We are lucky that the United States is one of them. My latest in @washingtonpost: https://t.co/1c3LeOLQt2
Why would the FBI have wanted to pursue a vendetta against Trump as he constantly charges? “The FBI is Trumpland,” one agent said in 2016. My latest in @PostOpinions: https://t.co/1c3LeOLQt2
If anything, the FBI waited too long to probe Trump personally. During the Obama administration, the bureau was bending over backward to avoid even in the appearance of political favoritism. My latest in @PostOpinions: https://t.co/1c3LeOLQt2
The FBI wasn’t—and isn’t—part of some (nonexistent) Deep State plot against Trump. Its willingness to investigate the president is a sign that the FBI is an admirable, indeed essential, safeguard of American democracy. My latest in @PostOpinions:	 https://t.co/1c3LeOLQt2

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a politician of immense gifts who can have an outsize impact — but only if she masters the intricacies of policy and curbs her fatal attraction to political celebrity and vacuous soundbites. My latest in @PostOpinions: https://t.co/bHmNmcyAD0
Ocasio-Cortez reminds me of Sarah Palin, another talented young communicator who made a big splash in national politics before having her lack of knowledge painfully exposed. This is a cautionary tale for Ocasio-Cortez. My latest in @PostOpinions: https://t.co/bHmNmcyAD0
AOC's initial response to her errors displayed a cavalier attitude toward the truth similar to Trump's. For both the far left and the far right, facts are an irksome “detail” of scant importance. What really matters is being “morally right.” My latest: https://t.co/bHmNmcyAD0
The real problem with Ocasio-Cortez is not how she dresses or where she comes from. It’s that she is an uber-progressive — a self-proclaimed “democratic socialist” — who cares more about ideological correctness than factual correctness. My latest: https://t.co/bHmNmcyAD0
