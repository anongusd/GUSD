It's why Facebook's well-intentioned efforts on fake news, and any other group's, are doomed to failure and disappointment. But we all keep seeking the holy grail.		But the truth we need to accept is we must be skeptical of all and know we will all get it wrong at least sometimes
And we ought to be cautious of those who claim to be the authority on truth, although they will naturally attract those seeking such an authority. There is no easy answer to truth, but we all desire it
@IlyaSomin Every organization and every human has its limits in truth, whether because of inability to know all or unwillingness to divulge some. And that stops short of suggesting the intentionally deceptive or malicious
