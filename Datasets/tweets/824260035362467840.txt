@DrBirdLady Just ordered the book!
@mkwfreeman @DrBirdLady A lot megafauna species went extinct soon after contact with Homo sapiens, including some pretty recently (within the last couple centuries) that had been in isolated areas, like Steller‚Äôs Sea Cow (giant manatee relative). Read The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert.
@DrBirdLady @FossilLocator I harassed my family with that knowledge on our road trip this summer! I was excited talking about Pleistocene, Anthropocene, the sixth mass extinction, and they‚Äôre like, sure, mom, whatever but they humored me.
@nickconfessore @DeadpoolResists Right. My signature (and handwriting in general) have changed significantly over 20 years. The joke about doctors‚Äô sloppy handwriting is entirely true!
@ClaraJeffery @darth .@cmclymer @TrueFactsStated @nycsouthpaw
This is good, but‚Äîmaybe we rely too much on signatures? My signature (and handwriting in general) has changed a lot over the last twenty years. I assume a forensic expert could analyze it, but a casual inspection might say it doesn‚Äôt match. https://t.co/xZlhnUHQPC

@tifotter Grrrr....
Please ensure that your constituents can continue to receive affordable healthcare despite #PreExistingConditions. #utpol 11/11
.@RepJohnCurtis @RepChrisStewart @RepMiaLove @OrrinHatch @SenMikeLee Your constituents are facing health problems on a daily basis: pneumonia, asthma, colon cancer, endometriosis, sinus infections, broken bones‚Äîall through no fault of their own. 10/
People here in Utah are generally pretty healthy when it comes to avoiding risky behaviors like nicotine, alcohol and illicit drugs. But illness or injury can strike anywhere, anytime. You can get lung cancer even if you‚Äôve never smoked a single cigarette in your life. 9/
As genetic testing becomes more common, this could be a real threat. I had a friend who had sickle cell anemia. Not her fault‚Äîshe was a paragon of healthy living. It was her African genetics. An insurance company could deny her coverage simply because of her genetics. 8/
Another animal example: Labrador retrievers are prone to rupturing their ACL ligaments in their knees, just like human runners and football players. Some insurance companies will deny any coverage for any ACL injuries in Labradors, based purely on the genetics. 7/
I treated a cat for an upper respiratory infection. Owner said her insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover because he had a URI as a kitten. 90% of kittens get a cold (just like preschool kids), but the insurance company uses that to deny coverage for ANY respiratory illness for LIFE. 6/
As a veterinarian, I see this from the other side: pet health insurance is where human health insurance was 20-30 yrs ago. There are no regulations &amp; no ACA for pets, so pet insurance companies will often deny coverage due to #PreExistingConditions or genetic predispositions. 5/
Back in the pre-ACA late 90‚Äôs, I had a concussion. The doc ordered a neck CT and head CT. Just the simple fact that they CT'd my neck, even though I had no symptoms and CT was normal, my insurance company notified me that it would not cover ANY neck conditions for two years. 4/
Insurance companies are in the business of making money. If they can save costs by denying coverage, they will. If they can increase your rates to $4000 per month because you are ‚Äúhigh risk,‚Äù they will. 3/
Say that you tweak your back shoveling snow. You go to urgent care, they rx muscle relaxants, and you‚Äôre back to normal in 2 days.  Then 10 yrs later you herniate a disc in your spine. The insurance co could deny you coverage, saying the back injury was #PreExistingCondition. 2/
Let‚Äôs talk about #PreExistingConditions. With that term, many people think of big bad things like cancer/diabetes. But EVERYTHING you have ever been treated for/had diagnosed/been tested for is a #PreExistingCondition. Have you ever gone to urgent care or ER for ANY reason? 1/

Dist 4 (purple: central) - vote for Ben McAdams https://t.co/rkTy88xodb. He's running against Mia Love, who despite being a WOC has only called out Trump ONCE, when he called Haiti a sh*thole--didn't care about pussy-grabbing, Mexicans are rapists, putting brown kids in cages.
District 3 (yellow: eastern half of the state) - vote for James Singer https://t.co/gCxc1W02FB. He's an LDS Navajo sociology professor who will work for *all* of Utah's people.
District 2 (blue: western half of the state) - vote for Shireen Ghorbani https://t.co/L8lBjMHGTK. She is running against Chris Stewart, who is actively *defending* Russia's interference in our democracy and is presumably compromised by Putin.
District 1 (green: top of the state to Vernal) - vote for Lee Castillo https://t.co/Ur3onwBMB5. He is running against Rob Bishop, who is a lump on a log. Seriously. Bishop doesn't interact with constituents and has no opinions on anything except exploiting Utah's public lands.
