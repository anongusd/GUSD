@BenWalke To be clear I mean spawning on or near the player you need to protect. 		Ideally near them. Itd be more fun, to up the intensity, AND speed of matches by eliminating a need to “find your team” every time you spawn. Matches are won and lost in that dead space.
@BenWalke “INSTANT ACTION” 		Is the best way I can describe how blast without a timer felt.		Some of the most fun the game has ever been. Spawning faster = players interacting more an in new ways.		Heroes v Villains outta use a similar frame. Faster spawns, obj-based spawn points	You rock!
