@ddssff @TomBevanRCP I trusted polls a long time ago. The polls were confusing when Romney ran suggesting he had more of a chance. The polls did not predict Trump would get the nomination and the polls were SURE Hillary would beat any republican opponent for the Presidency.
@TomBevanRCP I don't trust the polls any more. I'm  never sure who they are polling in the first place ... people with landlines? text? email? on the street?  Exit polls may work but many people vote in the mail
