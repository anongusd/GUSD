@cadenmgardner For what it‚Äôs worth I don‚Äôt think Andrew Garfield‚Äôs character voted.
@cadenmgardner I think it could make a lot of (speciality) money in the spring? Some friends in the audience got a lot more out of it than I did. Never saw SOUTHLAND TALES and to the credit of that comparison and I guess the movie itself I‚Äôm more curious to check it out now.
@zachheltzel @ericeidelstein is the twist the 35 SHOTS OF RUM poster in that one dude‚Äôs bedroom
@cadenmgardner Completely agree with the interloper angry white male angle on LA in intention - and frankly some of the execution - but I despise how much it tries to have its cake and it eat too. But would LOVE to read anything you might write on this movie
Between DESTROYER, GEMINI, and UNDER THE SILVER LAKE, it‚Äôs been a banner year for atrocious LA noir.

@BakerseeBakerdo It undercuts the integrity of American success by overstuffing the screen with an excess of gaudy costumes, wigs, and pastiche as a means to expose the fraud of its "fake it til you make it" ethos. Russell always plays dress up but this time it's tied to theme. Riotous ensemble.

Next time you hear someone call Jeff Flake a bipartisan hero, Bob Corker a voice of reason, or Susan Collins a moderating force in the party, remember that they‚Äôd rather line the pockets of rich donors than insure access to health care for poor children.

It‚Äôs not brave to reject a child molester for elected office, call out our unhinged president, or stand for institutional integrity. It‚Äôs brave to sacrifice your political career in order to protect the people you represent.
