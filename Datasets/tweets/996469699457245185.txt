@Adeola0503 Wetin be this now? Is this an art work? I don't get! But you can't be serious. Wait oh! Do such a place really exist in Nigeria? Abegi! This one no real at all. Even if it exist; I don't believe humans are there. But those cars, wait oh! E be like say I dey see shades of humans.
@renoomokri And above all the choices you made with or without your parents has nothing to do with the wisdom or follies of your parents. No choice without two ends. So don't come and preach follies. Enjoy your life while it last.
@renoomokri Note that being very informed is also a privilege from your parent; if you have been used into the lavatory like some of the unprivileged ones; you wouldn't have existed to claim wisdom from your parents.
@renoomokri Reno dis one no enter at all. E be like say dis election don really finish u oh! Sorry oh! If it hurts. Note dat u can't be wiser dan ur parents no. one; even if dey don't 've education. To be rich is not absolutely a product of wisdom but opportunities properly utilized.
@UgochiJaneTrump I absolutely believe
@fkeyamo Very pure election. A stream can be pure while there are dirt in the corners.
@DrJoeAbah They are all selfish perhaps empty, perhaps come out and display what they have been rehearsing to win minds. I support Doctor.
@DrJoeAbah This guy too much. Exactly! I rest my heart! But must everyone be president to create jobs?
@renoomokri @ProfOsinbajo @OfficialPDPNig @MBuhari This guy need better flogging. He wakes up and begin to imagine evil to dismantle Buhari and Osibanjo. The Devil is purer than Reno. Evil has never helped anyone and neither will it help u. I bet you will be ditched very soon.
@ben_olyz @MBuhari Even if Atiku didn't win? I think a lot of you PDP folks are sick in your heads.
@OKaodim @MBuhari He won! If you have problems with that, go to court to challenge his victory. Yeye dey smell.
@walekareem @jackric35586117 @MBuhari Very true! May God see us all through. Unnecessary hatred.
@MBuhari Greatest congratulations to the African Leader! PMB and to Sall!
@Vinxmichael @MBuhari Great Guy! I am impressed. One love brother!
@muftimenk @APCNigeria @MBuhari Is mufti a Buhari fan? Buhari must be really loved. Thanks Mufti
@UgochiJaneTrump Atiku don finish
@UgochiJaneTrump The Messiah of our time.
@renoomokri @MBuhari Guy! Go jump for well. We are happy and very pleased. We are not noise makers. We work with intelligence rather than sentiments. Yeye dey smell.
@viktorasiegbu @fkeyamo Go and sleep. He won the election. Sorry! Stop grieving. APC are not noise makers. We work with intelligence not sentiments.
@wiz_rhyno @fkeyamo @benmurraybruce @Sadeq_Alkali @dawisu @Its_bezmak @yinkanubi @AHayatu @N_Gosta @JackObinyan @fimiletoks These guys are good for nothing ranters.
@honneydrops_ @midefash711 @fkeyamo And it wasn't free and fair? Please educate us. Buhari defeated him. He got good votes from all parts of the country mostly from the north. Go through the results and you may stop grieving.
@honneydrops_ @fkeyamo Electoral fraud because Buhari won? I don't get it? Na by force to win? PDP and fans are the worst I have ever seen. Noise is not enough to win in an election. Hope you get that in your heads. Noise makers.
@gbemiro @fkeyamo You are of course not a Nigerian.
@renoomokri @MBuhari You are in a mourning mode not everyone. Keep mourning. My condolences to you and your people.
@cookielawyer @fkeyamo @MrSomoye Buba to me seems mentally deranged.
@fkeyamo That's very true. APC fans are like Man-U fans, while PDP fans are like Chelsea fans. Those who know, understand.
@MBuhari Wow! Very beautiful. Osho Baba and king Rotimi
@MBuhari Very very very true he deserves to be applauded and every of visible and invisible supporters.
@MBuhari Personally, I know you will make Nigeria a better place for all. Congratulations Your Excellences Sir!
@MBuhari Very true. You are truly God blessing to all who sincerely love Nigeria as country.
@UgochiJaneTrump No mind dat MDG guy. Peter for just contest on his own. But sometimes when I listen to these guys who claim to be very intelligent, I wonder what people called intelligence. As far as I'm concerned dey are empty barrels. Look at Saraki, look at Peter. What I see is empowered ego
@jamaiyiibieneye My guy you just injured some idiots.
@UgochiJaneTrump Well done Ugo. This is great.
@rapheal_olayode @Demurleigh Saraki is the new president of Dubai Agbekpos and Atiku is the next president of Ameri-Naija follow follow.
@damola_ade77 @Demurleigh @iam_Davido Evil presence.
@segalink Na you and your likes will suffer. God will take care of his own. I don't get; election nah do or die? This is how you people go about misleading people.
@renoomokri @eralle @atiku Witches hardly give until they are stoned to death. Yeye people. All the rantings turned woes. Reno or Nero or cero, dero, oh tero! No zero! No! No! No! No! Oh soro! Shut up there!
@blessingNkem17 @MBuhari You no dey tire?
@MBuhari I'm congratulate myself for being part of a winning team. I love u but God loves u more. I'm d happiest man on planet earth. God bless Ugochi, Ayo &amp; other team in Twitter bearing all manners of insult. God has won. All Nigerians born and unborn have won. Ur integrity is paid off.
@renoomokri Nero, I mean Reno, oh sorry, rhinoceros, has those buses still in the motor park?
@UgochiJaneTrump This one huge oh!
@VANTRA7 @UgochiJaneTrump Are you OK?
@UgochiJaneTrump @ChukaThaBoss @Onile050 @babaidris090 @I_Am_Ilemona @MrBanksOmishore I hope Baba is winning?
@princeyakub @kakra68 Really
@kakra68 Really?
@youthsummitng @ng_newsreact No one is commenting because it's PDP. If PDP wins this election God will leave Nigeria.
@dino_melaye You yeye shah!
@omohteee12 @GEJonathan @noirblvck_ That's Nigeria! Always full of complaints. If God decides to come in flesh to rule, we will never be satisfied. Jonathan was thrown out because some feels he doesn't deserve that seat. Precisely Saraki yet he still dines with them.
@Ausbones @gopcy @DrJoeAbah Safe trip brother.
@DrJoeAbah God knows better Doc! That's also a great service.
@ProfOsinbajo Carry go no shaking
@fomax112 @OsosaChris Baba don talk
@Pink_Chinasa @OsosaChris @kakra68 You know know say all the people supporting Atiku them be people wey nobody can really tell who dem be? All of them be thief.
@iamderinolar @OsosaChris Next level
@Revest4green @OsosaChris Which time Baba talk this one? Evil inventors
@Revest4green @OsosaChris Atiku no be Muslim? Yeye people.
@Andy_Onos @OsosaChris What's competent about Atiku? Do u mean when someone is rich from stolen funds is competent? I don't get. My bro u know more than this now! If u are disposed to Atiku's opportunities, I bet u will do 1zillion% more dan him. E be like say u know know why dem dey call am thief.
@tarpaline @OsosaChris Deep inside you, I can feel why you are supporting Atiku.
@dami_adebajo @OsosaChris @hadeytweet Old age is a blessing not a curse. It shows you have more to give to the upcoming.
@WhyteXclusive @OsosaChris @azeez_ibrahim11 Everyone knows what they are all after, money! Buhari killed no one.  Whatever judgment you give to a man so expect the same form above.
@IsraelAdeniyiA1 @OsosaChris @AdekunleLuq Really?
@ubedison @oladseyOOE @AdewaleSnd @OsosaChris @iyaboawokoya What's gbam about the photo? You funny shah!
@oladseyOOE @AdewaleSnd @OsosaChris @iyaboawokoya Wondering about what? They were once pals? Because what I can see is the PMB is greeting someone sitting and Atiku friendly conversation with someone standing.
@Remi61069647 @OsosaChris Money can buy anything in the world but can't shade reality. Who knew CJN is a thief? How did we know one can lobby in Trump's time? The same you said Buhari is bad to suspend the CJN. Common! Think before you write.
@Iamoko @OsosaChris To be killed is to go to the acclaimed heaven and to be robbed is to be deprived of life itself. Poverty is a virtue for the wise and affluence is a curse for the folly. Tell urself the truth, no man is born with anything but that spiritual poverty gave u the incline for wealth.
@OsosaChris There selfishness and deception utterly obvious. Their love for money has becloud their judgment.
@OsosaChris And our pastors will be held responsible because they are preaching evil without fear.
@OsosaChris And the worst is that 80%of our pastors also endorsed stealing. And it's very clear that stealing may not be a vice in the future of Nigeria. The poverty we fear today might lead us to doom tomorrow. But God still love us. If Atiku wins then stealing is auto-legalized.
Has anyone noticed that virtually 80% of pastors are against Buhari? Sincerely, Nigerian Pastors are more politically concerned than spiritually conscious of their duty. Can someone educate me?
PDP is known for selling national assets for their self aggrandizement, APC is known for fostering national assets. I think this known for any sane mind in Nigeria. I think this will help those who claimed they don't know the differences between APC and PDP.
@renoomokri @MBuhari When PDP is nailed finally today, I believe you will be doomed as ass.
@amachamp_4life @kingsley_okona @renoomokri @NNPCgroup Has APC sold any national property since inception in 2015? Just be careful so that PDP Will not sell you. Just an advice, no long thing.
@fitnesscityman @ogundamisi @thecableng @APCNigeria @OfficialPDPNig @atiku @PeterObi Self deception is a vice.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @inecnigeria Can someone tell this man to stop talking trash. Buhari has already told Nigerians to vote for their candidates of their choice. People of your kind are the ones peddling rumors and unnecessarily charging the political atmosphere negatively. You are More of evil than good.
@miss_ayomide Exactly! Most of them will say they are nonpartisan but deep down they are ashamed to be identified with a thief.
@ProfOsinbajo You will lead us until you are tired. I believe you have the SKATE to lead us alright. We love you. Thanks for your steadfastness and you genuine support for our president.
@renoomokri Are you born again now or just tricking us to see PDP as an option? No real Nigeria that truly want to vote that Will not find their way to their centre. Stop being nice. Vote buying strategy. An avenue to campaign and share money.
@dgebis @Johannxs @MrAbuSidiq @AHayatu @alouibrahim92 @trueNija @hdauda90 @BuhariCentre @zamzano @APCUKingdom @Mr_JAGs Superb Victory! Amen!
@JeSuisNaija I had a similar experience when an ass copied my picture and pasted it for people to view. Some people can be so stupid.
@renoomokri @atiku @MBuhari Is this Reno or Nero?
@cbngov_akin1 @AmandaBrynes1 @Ayourb @AliyuAbdullahA @APCUKingdom @Mr_JAGs @fkeyamo @yesmylo @ogundamisi @Equityoyo @AyooAkanji @SusanHenshaw50 What a heck!
@UNILAG_EFIWE I don't know why even in the first place Atiku was not arrested and jailed.
@AkinFasuyi @kakra68 You are 1m% correct. The pastors and Bishops are the enemies of the country.
@DrJoeAbah You have a point there. I think the INEC should be allowed to do their job except that the postponement was done wrongly. I'm very unhappy but what can I do?
@renoomokri @AsiwajuTinubu @MBuhari You yeye shah!
@MOHD_Ks Our pastors has lost a lot in tithing and that's a major concern. They can't survive without tithing. Is that fair. Buck of the stolen funds are channeled to the church. So don't be angry.
@O_ssai Tithing has dropped so drastically from stolen funds.
@wesprinz @hotplatenaija @MBuhari @Odunfa24 OK light and Darkness
@KelzTbg @wesprinz @MBuhari @Odunfa24 OK my ogah at the top. Thanks for the advice sir. I really appreciate it.
@wesprinz @MBuhari @Odunfa24 I will never say that again daddy!
@wesprinz @MBuhari @Odunfa24 Thank you sir!
@wesprinz @MBuhari @Odunfa24 May the peace of the Lord abide with you and your family. Amen! IJN.
@AfroMangical @MBuhari My brother don't worry! It's a blessing in disguise!
@wesprinz @MBuhari @Odunfa24 You are accepted by power and authority of holy ghost! In Jesus name! Amen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Manuels82206309 @MBuhari At least you have something to eat.
@ovieali @MBuhari You don't need all these. Go and cast your votes.
@MBuhari Well done sir!
@MBuhari Thank you sir! The postponement is blessing bcos my area wouldn't have gone out to vote; the just wipe one important person and that has created a lot of uproar. I hope it calms down before the next date.
@teguando1 @ng_newsreact @DrJoeAbah Guy Twitter no be wrestling ring oh! Atiku and Buhari nah brothers. CJN no dey feed you or Abah. All the people here are Nigerians with different opinions of what they feel is good or bad. But for me I abhor corruption. Any fight against it I'm in for it. That's why I'm for PMB.
@obiezeknwosu Obieze! No long thing. But I do hope you are not a day dreamer?
@onpointme30 @miss_ayomide Don't give your vote to AAC. That's a waste of time and opportunities. Give this to my Buhari. I beg you sincerely. Cheers brother.
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari Very OK. Stop saying things that are absolutely wrong because of politics. I'm very much aware of Buhari antecedents. I abhor liers.
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari Whatever judgment you pass to a man so you will receive in a greater measure.
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari It's not the look my brother but the content. Olodo.
@UgochiJaneTrump @akaebube Stop bothering yourself with fags. they are day dreamers. And this actually allowed.
@UgochiJaneTrump @AmBestmanBuka @akaebube That's it
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari You be olodo. A governor has immunity and above all it is the president duty to take him to court. Those who alleged him should do that OK. That's the law.
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari Have you ever supported him, I mean from 2015? My brother shot up there!
@MBuhari @CyntBells Next level
@obiezeknwosu @MBuhari And you think Atiku will give Nigerians what they want? You must be day dreaming
@MBuhari @CyntBells We are always here for you. Those who love this country will do their best to give you the support you need. You are my best president. And I believe millions out their feel the same. Everyone has varying choice but you remain my best.
@miss_ayomide @CyntBells Dat's 1 thing I see in PDP followers. I know all their tricks. Dey will tell you not to be partisan. Dey will always want u to change ur God giving intelligence to suit their inordinate intention. I am really fed up on d kind of mind dis criminals have. I'm tired of being wooed.
@ng_newsreact Why wouldn't they do that when their tithing return has diminished. Those who knows, knows better. All of them nah businessmen. It's painful to see that tithing has dropped and their god of magic can't do without govt stolen funds. Sorry if it hurts. Awon ole buruku.
@moses246 @UgochiJaneTrump Then you are not talking about restructuring rather you mean resource control.
@thecableng Your statistics are myths from your ass. We will vote Buhari and keep you criminal in abeyance.
@sf_adebayo @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow I don't think you watch NTA at all
@NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow You are always welcomed.
@DavidEzennia @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow You guys are just talking from your corners. Buhari has more people who love him more than you can ever imagined.
@Ralphdani @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow He is addressing Nigerian not enemies of Nigeria
@WOLOGUNDE @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow How often do you watch NTA?
@ogochukwuchari1 @Tola_Ogunleye @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow You will be disgraced as usual
@ogochukwuchari1 @Tola_Ogunleye @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow And you are a virus.
@Tola_Ogunleye @ogochukwuchari1 @NGRPresident @MBuhari @NTANewsNow Buhari is winning this election with clear marks. You guys never voted him before and those who voted him will go on Saturday to disgrace all enemies of Nigeria. You are too much my brother.
@moses246 @UgochiJaneTrump Restructuring is just a utopia. Believe it or not it will not add up to anything even if it is done. Let our governors do their jobs and the country will be a great place.
@moses246 @UgochiJaneTrump Anyone who cares to understand should know that Nigeria is already a structured society. We have president with immunity and a governors with immunity. So what else is the restructure. If our governors do nothing about their state who will. Restructuring will change nothing.
@miss_ayomide If Npower is improved I believe everyone will be engaged that is not yet engaged.
@miss_ayomide I only wish we love this country. I'm a full born Niaja. Since I begin my journey, dis is the only govt I have seen dat at least a person in a family get something without knowing anyone at d apex of govt. Outside NYSC, nothing u get without knowing someone. Npower!

@Sartaj_11 Everyone has forgotten all that now and they are striving to enthrone the worst of them all. But God pass them.
@thecableng Risk assessment is very crucial.
@GuardianNigeria This is could be true because we are a consuming nation.
@coolMuhman @DrJoeAbah Very correct. Democracy is just an ideal that all the elements it contains can't be absolutely be fulfilled.
@renoomokri @MBuhari When the results of their actions come you will say APC is bad and when such nonsense is done you applaud. The world is watching.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig @benmurraybruce @MobilePunch @channelstv Next level my friend. Day dreaming is allowed.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig @benmurraybruce @MobilePunch @channelstv This guy dey this country at all?
@DrJoeAbah This you defined is Buhari government except for the loathsome who want to be spoon-fed.
@macjayobyno @MBuhari So you will vote a man who endorsed corruption publicly? I pity you.
@Babypeng_ @MBuhari Did you vote for him before? Those who vote him will still vote him.ok
@MBuhari I'm with you for life.
@MBuhari I'm with 24/7
@Real_Ibedu @gbemmygbenga @fkeyamo Small boy don yeye you.
@ishaku160 @fkeyamo May be because the youth are not yet politically selfish.
@EmprezzChristo @EBRISIBE @fkeyamo I know know the one in Aba. Is there anyone really in Aba?
@ng_newsreact @MrGaji @fkeyamo After 2023
@barnaby04 @fkeyamo It's very crucial and I think I would have loved to see that Atiku's and Obasanjo's children in APC. We will never learn.
@DrJoeAbah Oh man! What a huge hammer on the fukking nail. Sorry if I sound naughty. Thanks. Knowledge is power!
@UgochiJaneTrump @i_am_Majesty_ Tell am! You dey for abroad no mean say you no be Nigeria. some dey Nigeria but only know Zworld actors. They don't even know their local government chairman name. Carry go! Ugo!
@lekanmadandola @UgochiJaneTrump But she is very correct.
@DrJoeAbah I need to try this out, may be with my second wife. I just hope she will not be angry with me; my first wife. Keep balling.
@Ytwaziri @miss_ayomide @raufaregbesola I mean Adams is not PDP
@Ytwaziri @miss_ayomide @raufaregbesola Not only Buhari. Tinubu is not PDP,  Adams is PDP and myriads of others. But you're right to an extent.
@miss_ayomide PDPs are just out 4 revenge. Whatever Buhari is doing is wat any sane govt will do. I think it is good that Buhari is teaching every generation born &amp; unborn to know how things work. He has proven this in Npower which i am beneficiary. Just apply, boom! U're there; if qualified
@Thaddeus_ody @ugoosings @NGRPresident @MBuhari Death of people has become point? You must be a demon to have even thought of it. You need better cele flogging.
@NGRPresident @MBuhari People love this man shah! Where there is light darkness disappear. May their soul rest in sacredness and pureness in peace above. Amen!
@MakinzSam @NGRPresident @MBuhari The man is truly loved. You may jump inside well for Atiku.
@DrJoeAbah I personally abhor corruption and anything related to evil with all my all. I'm a man of conscience that is what i believe and it is my compass to knowing God. Forgiveness may be divine but it is also a choice.
@DrJoeAbah I'm a proud Buharist. Wen i pitch my tent i remain no matter d hassle. Going through all my tweet i stand for buhari because he is the only light in the tunnel. I can give sundry reasons why i have picked Buhari against all odds. I will love him as much life permits me.
@AsoRock @MBuhari @NNPCgroup That is great a move. For those of who love,  love you for the future of this country. Carry go! Next level is not negotiable. Forward ever! Backward never. For the wailers, let them hug a life step-up transformer.
@ebuka_akara I will ask him why did he not probe all ex-presidents and perhaps jailed them for putting us in the mess that he himself has find himself.
@GovAyoFayose That is great! He still have my votes any time because he may forget dates and even names due to excitement but he does not forget the average Nigerian at the lowest rung of the ladder of life. Go and drink gutter water. Yeye dey smell.
@VictorkayceeN @UgochiJaneTrump @victorumesi My brother you are the funniest creature in human history. Did you listen when you talk? If you don't know the other side of life,  hide and enjoy or better still shut the hell you called a mouth. 10k is a very big deal for the less privilege. I have gone through that lane. Ok!
A quantum leap may just be what you need to succeed but sometimes you may be denied because you rely on a human but a small faith hinged on Godly providence could see you through.
Thank you for helping me reach 100 followers! I literally couldn’t have done it without you.
@AbbanoguTimes @DrJoeAbah @fkeyamo And what is wrong if he is qualified? I have not heard any corruption charges against him so far. You can educate the house.
@DrJoeAbah The judiciary is rotten,  i mean very putrified. Lawyers even teach their clients to lie. They are inevitable devils. Only God can help us. We should all understand that office is one that is very tempting and anyone in his position is not safe. May God help him out of this.
@Adeola0503 @dmightyangel The guy looks like PDP fag.
@miss_ayomide @amdegoodman @ProfOsinbajo He is demented.
@ProfOsinbajo @ogundamisi Nothing can happen to you. You and PMB is God chosen. I'm glad it never stopped you from moving ahesd. God is charge. Your good intent for Nigeria unborn generations will see you through. Love you!
@legendachad2 @ProfOsinbajo You mean PDP i guess? Because he is an APC
@UgochiJaneTrump Nothing dey stop a child of God.
@TrackaNG @benmurraybruce @4lowthemoney @luminategroup @UdemeNG @OSIWA1 @SERAPNigeria @babaidris090 @seunonigbinde @naijama @FordFoundation @renoomokri He use am pay his workers in silver bird. Haha
@UgochiJaneTrump Day dreaming is allowed
@rockrubber @UgochiJaneTrump Really? Ok oh! Thanks for the advice
@rockrubber @UgochiJaneTrump Old man how are you¿
@UgochiJaneTrump God is in charge
@UgochiJaneTrump Nothing dey happen
@rockrubber @UgochiJaneTrump You're a demon personified
@ojialo1 @1st_manuel @UgochiJaneTrump @MBuhari @APCNigeria @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Please explain gwandollar
@miss_ayomide Watch the #candidate Atiku publicly endorsed corruption. Our generation is doomed.
@UgochiJaneTrump They will statue forever.
@OsosaChris He is a sick devil because the real devil recognises Jesus perfection. Jesus claimed imperfection as a way of encouraging humanity to come to God. Atiku publicly endorsed corruption. Our upcoming generstion is doomed. I'm really scared what Nigeria will look like if he wins.
@1st_manuel @UgochiJaneTrump @MBuhari @APCNigeria @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Because you dey suffer d suffer you believe say you never before Buhari come you go con  endorse who openly endorsed corruption in the #candidate yesterday abhi? Anyone with a sane mind will understand that Atiku has nothing to offer us.
Thanks to @_amanjakhar for uploading this amazing photo to @pexels for free! 📸 https://t.co/ZliyjMOHIT
@UgochiJaneTrump He is not going anywhere. But Amen¡
@DrJoeAbah This guy fine sha! He won be like girl some how. Haha
@KennyyoungA @Morgstreme1 Nigerians dey gree?
@DrJoeAbah Greatness is not bought but earned. God is your strength.
@DrJoeAbah Fuck the bitches and the click they claim,  west side when we try to quick the game,  they claim to be players but you burst their asses. Haha!
@sidramatics I think he is. Nah God open his yash. PDP dey cry sha.
@Ademola38970946 @GovAyoFayose @ProfOsinbajo Amen!
@GovAyoFayose @ProfOsinbajo I know know say this Batman still dey this country. Mr. Ayo i wonder if it is u talking. Was the Judge you slapped had several bank accts undeclared? Please hide. He is only suspended not removed. And above all he admitted to his crime. At least he is more honorable.
@renoomokri @MBuhari Your are really the most hypocritical fag i have known. The mere thought of atiku is a course and an  unforgivable evil. This your tweet shows how wishy washy you are.
@UgochiJaneTrump You dey talk as if you don't know that is our way. Corruption is has a beautiful side in the dark. Just protect it from light and it can be graceful. Haha!
@renoomokri @MBuhari @GovUmarGanduje Let those who caught him on camera sue him. Sometimes i wonder whether you speak from anus when it comes to handling corruption issues.
@richiexodus @MAIBISHOP @SadiqsAdam2 @MBuhari Did you pass your WAEC? Olodo rabata.
@MBuhari Carry on Baba. I have 26 votes on my end for you. As my entire family is Buharized already.
@benmurraybruce @osygwe @MBuhari Buhari will win and your pale colour will turn serious albinism. His victory will need no election tribunal as you envisaged.
@bolajiayo @adinoyi123 @MBuhari The more you see the less you will understand. Buhari has done well. You will know when he leaves 2023 as usual for Nigerians. 💁
@DrJoeAbah @obyezeks Oby was never serious about the whole until i saw her in the debate. I once read she was declaring for Atiku even before the debate. Hearing her withdrawal never surprised me. So don't take her serious but the varying accusations now may be valid.
@DrJoeAbah @the_davidatta Don't have respect mostly on the virtual. Show me so that i can scrape his head to moromo.😂
@DrJoeAbah i have said it times without number that we Nigerians are the most confused people in the world. We complain too much and that is why we are where we are today. Nothing anyone does that we don't have a word for it.
@atiku Baba OBJ has said it all. He doesn't even know how to represent you. That is terrible. What do you do now?
@HectorBellerin Time heals
@DrJoeAbah Hahaha! You are too much. No mind us. Nah the only time money dey exchange hands.
@imez2380 Izu thank you! Every comment is an advice.
@fkeyamo America is an advanced nation. Lobbying company for that matter,  gay law,  marijuana acceptance. We should be ourselves. What we call immorality is means for them. Pornstars (ASHAWO). Anything is possible as far as it money. Nigeria should deal with their issues.
@atiku Really? Are you really ready now to answer all questions bothering the nation? I will send mine that day. I hope you will be able to answer it without your usual excuse of Buhari absence?
@DrJoeAbah Powerfully correct. Politics is not all about fancy talks. Those who win debates ends up falling in my WAEC days. Politics is a real deal with varying parameters.
@DrJoeAbah If Nigerians failed to damage OBJ by voting Buhari,  he OBJ will damage Nigerians by installing Atiku. May God help Nigeria.
@DrJoeAbah Obj will damage himself. This is a battle between a lion and a tiger. Buhari may not best but he and osibanjo are the best option for now. Sorry guys if it hurts.
@DrJoeAbah Non of ur comments corroborate what Dr is saying. And I don't think I can explain his lamentations. But one thing for sure is that Atiku messed up big time. He only see a contestant &amp; rest are nobody and for Buhari is absence is a little genuine cos he is engaged in rallies.
@_Dhoraa @MBuhari OK oh!
@UgochiJaneTrump @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @atiku Sorry for my typos. I mean I'm not trying to demean ladies. Point of correction for all readers. Thanks!
@UgochiJaneTrump @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @atiku I think Ugo has a beautiful spirit. You are too intelligent to be a girl. I'm trying to demean ladies but you are one in a million. Always remember me. Sai baba!
@baleba30 @MBuhari Don't generalize. There are ibos who love Baba. And I believe their votes will count this time. Ibos are great people and I believe they will do the needful.
@Yettypeak @MBuhari You don't need all that vote for any of those who came for the debate. I believe they are Nigerians.
@lherohakymelen1 @MBuhari My brother vote for Atiku. Stop complaining.
@the_apocalypto @lherohakymelen1 @MBuhari You really think like a turtle. Though turtles really don't find their way into Africa tales.
@dy_ade1 @Ayshahumairah_ @MBuhari @Ahmadudu__ You don't need all these my brother. Vote for any of those who came for the debate.
@dy_ade1 @Ayshahumairah_ @MBuhari @Ahmadudu__ Who past debates don't help?
@dy_ade1 @Ayshahumairah_ @MBuhari @Ahmadudu__ Please vote for those who came for the debate.
@matthewfaks @MBuhari @AsoRock Come and replace him my brother

@AkinadeAdedayo @KemesiM @MBuhari @AsoRock God bless you
@adegboyegataju1 @MBuhari We his true followings understand that Baba is busy with our nation wide rallies. Thanks
@Yettypeak @MBuhari I believe you are aware that APC national rallies are on-going.
@DonaldD95 @MBuhari The man is busy with national rallies I believe you this. He is human not a machine and he is not ubiquitous. I think this is more than enough. Sai baba!
@MaxwellTabak @MBuhari What has debates brought to Nigerians? Sai Baba!
@imez2380 @MBuhari What has past presidential debates bring to Nigerians. Go and sleep my friend.
@_Dhoraa @MBuhari What is the results of past debates of past presidents? Has it help us? You need a sleeping pill.
@MBuhari You are too much my Presido
@UgochiJaneTrump Atiku is confused.
@zulla87 Na so nah! May be e whon come fight Buhari. Those small children go rubbish am. He no know anything. Saraki carryam like house boy to US.
@UgochiJaneTrump He has won already. I learnt Atiku is back? This Waka sha! This Atiku nah another James Bond.
@MBuhari You have taken Delta already. Thank God.
@UgochiJaneTrump Buhari has captured Delta State. PDP is dead now. Everyone is happy and very ready to call PDP quit. Let there be continued mini-rally for Baba all over the federation. Atiku is a worm.
@UgochiJaneTrump Different office to rob us. Well he doesn't even have any to have such openings. Ole buruku!
@ogundamisi we will see who is who！
@Lollylarry1 you are right to a very a great extent.
what kind of restructuring do Nigerians need when we already have states and governors？i believe if our governors are up in their game, Nigeria will thrive.
@DrJoeAbah This is a clear electoral fraud. Only people in Lagos know this Durotayo. I don't even know this Dude. Bots at work. I play clash of kings and many other online games. Smart guys mostly the Chinese and some American fags engage in a lot bots to speed up their growth.
@UgochiJaneTrump @Wanina40Dan As an ordinary man,  I have checked the statistics of electioneering it is absolutely correct that Baba will win without any electoral magomago as presumed by the Atikulooted camp.
@UgochiJaneTrump Zillion times true
https://t.co/J78jUAOAGw
@DrJoeAbah I don't even know any of these people except for ezekwelisi who is the funniest amongst them.
@DrJoeAbah And above all, why did the CJN failed to declare assets  in the first place. Leaving politics aside and as I would guess, he is the custodian of the Nigerian law. If he failed to do so he is as good as an ordinary man on the streets. Just my thoughts.
@DrJoeAbah What baffles me in this issue is that  PDP is taking it personal and the other one is that why now; I believe this man has hold this position for quite some time now. It's either that the CJN is a mole for PDP or he could no longer be trusted if hinged on political grounds.
@DrJoeAbah @Govshina You are really an intelligent man. I'm not saying because you are neither here or there but because you just nailed the nail on the head. You are really apolitical.
@UgochiJaneTrump The two can't be compared despite the fact that Buhari is our president and some funny Nigerians who don't even know what's good for them. Atiku is the worst option any sane human would ever vote for. Ex-military and Ex-custom officer. Customs are people with shady character.
@OMOAKIN01 @hbgumi @SpokesManAtiku @atiku Abiooo!
@MBuhari God will never forgive me if I ever disapprove Buhari govt. God will never forgive me if I never speak good of Buhari govt. God will never forgive me if I don't tell my fellow Nigerians the truth. Next level is the option. Vote Buhari and Osibanjo for president.
@belanoflowa1 @adeshinak @Victoria_NGR @Buhari_Ghandi You hate for Buhari has clouded your judgement. Everything this administration has ever put into action worked well.
@Victoria_NGR May be YWIN would have worked if championed by this government but Surep was a total fraud. In short wuruwu in PDP never makes nothing work. Yes things are expensive in the present regime but all social programs work perfectly without knowing anyone in the system.
@UgochiJaneTrump I think Nigerians need to be fully educated because the way we think is very funny. They politicize everything. And the masses are being deceived with what they see not what will come. Atiku should not be considered as an option for the present. I know the APC has something good.
@MBuhari Dey're not only going out 4 fake news but dey are deliberately good at news dat condemns ur govt &amp; above all dey intentionally shun news dat carries ur good will &amp; commitment to d Nigeria Dream. D media is good at carrying I'll message about current govt. I think we to know dis.
@MBuhari I believe you gazillion times. Thank you! Stand strong. Democracy has become so expensive that what is needed for development is now strayed to campaign by former government. Stand strong. Those who love you still love for your personal and your working policies.
@UgochiJaneTrump Ugo I think we don't need to bother ourselves over their woes but how we can bring our people into the understanding of what we believe and know about our candidates.
It should be understood that every comment is an advice to reckon with or to be rebuffed. So when we see comments on our tweets these advice should be your guide.
When I meet people to tell me how do you evaluate political performance of any government they keep beating round the bush when I come out with mine they are always left with their jaws on their necks. The general public need to be schooled on what democracy is all about.
@Trader_Moni @AsoRock PDP can twist anything to fine-tune their hogwash campaign. Above all they are not happy that this is reaching out to the masses.
@GEJonathan Africa leadership is a mess and the consciousness of the people is messier and AU is messiest. Military leaders if not for tyranny they have done well compared to the hogwash democratic counterparts. Nigeria military did well more than their democratic contemporaries.
@GEJonathan Democracy is too expensive in Africa. Those billions spent on ballots and useless logistics should be channelled to infrastructures and manpower development. I'm not against democracy but I feel the cost expended on such is enough to build factories and social infrastructures.
@UgochiJaneTrump Very true
Dem no force you but you need to be enlightened because the so called Atikulooted will rob you and perhaps makes you worst. But the good thing is that there's no vacancy for now in ASO Rock for him to do that. May be in his next incarnation. https://t.co/MfhsiY7NhZ
But you don't look someone who is hungry. It's good we speak for ourselves because I personally I have been so blessed. https://t.co/7GBNEofzce
@UgochiJaneTrump I'm always with you
@DrJoeAbah You are really an educator. Please educate us more. I for one I'm happy to be in your followings.
@UgochiJaneTrump Very true!
@obyezeks @inecnigeria @MBuhari You better don't say anything afterwards you were just ranting for Atiku. You are the worst I have ever seen. Some persons have already decided to foster your ambition but you just threw it to a crook.
@UgochiJaneTrump I don't really get it! Law maker running away from the law enforcement agencies.
@SweetShantel @MBuhari Why did Donald Trump appoints his son in law in his cabinet. Backward thinking. If he or she is qualified and he or she is a Nigeria. Only a foolish will work with people who will work against him.
@MBuhari What matters most to me is dat anything u touch works properly; Railway construction going on perfectly,  TSA working perfectly,  Npower working excellently, Boko Haram on hiding,  Traders money superior,  Corruption brought to stand still, HND equals https://t.co/ZiMPJ8riSs. etc
@MBuhari Well done my excellence.
@legendachad2 @MBuhari D military are meant to war &amp; not as decorations in the barracks. Dey win some &amp; lose some. Where there is terrorism &amp;war don't expect dat d military will not loose a soul. Even in communal clashes people loose their lives 4d sake of their land. Boko Haram are not trees.
@DrJoeAbah Ikorodu is underdeveloped? As at when I left Lagos to Delta; in 2012 compared to this day of my most recent visit, 2017. I feel there's some level of growth but in all I feel more attention is needed in the hinterlands than the absolute concentration at the center.
@DrJoeAbah Very true
@DrJoeAbah You are really a prophet. 😂
@DrJoeAbah When we get there we will cross the road safely. We don't need to kill or lie but one thing for sure all work to the glory of God.
@DrJoeAbah And I will be your VP. I really love to pilot this country one day. Amen!
@UgochiJaneTrump @azeez_ibrahim11 You are really a blessing to APC hope baba will see this because every good work deserves a reward.
@UgochiJaneTrump @azeez_ibrahim11 Thanks for the info but I'm really tired of Atikulooted who is feeding Nigerians with what they love to hear oh!
@FBiobarakuma @GEJonathan Is the president almighty God? This is weirdest thing I have ever heard. You must be kidding? What a heck of a tweet!
@MBuhari Thanks a lot my very amiable president. God grant you the know how when all and sundry fails you. We love you not because we are selfish beneficiaries but because we know you are the hope of the next level of getting Nigeria working again.
@MBuhari I'm on my own little level letting people understand the consciousness your administration is trying to create both here and abroad and I can say it is not easy because we are people of what we see not what is coming.
@DrJoeAbah Very true. Thanks a lot for your selfless contributions to the lives of your followings.
@UgochiJaneTrump Atiku na person weh any sensible person go dey canvass vote for. I sometimes wonder why God make me come from this country wey people go dey applause renown evil minded people. Obasanjo really disappoint me. If there is anyone that I'm ashamed of is Baba. I use to like him a lot.
@GEJonathan Good job. Happy new year sir
Tell them oh! Corruption is evil in forms no matter the rationale. https://t.co/dx2Z4lfrsw
@GEJonathan I wish Buhari can slice the salaries of senators to N1m per month and see how every one them will react. Even his own will desert him. I will advise you stay away from politics. All those who ousted u out are d ones u are friends with now. Ur opponent is not ur  enemy.
@GEJonathan I agree with you. Nigeria has always been blessed with good leaders but they have no choice than to work with questionable characters. We all need to change the way we condemn ourselves and our leaders. Look at shagari. Military wouldn't have overthrown if not for bad reports.
You are right there but my love is from inside; he is doing great and that's why I could have something of sorts for him. My instincts don't fail me. No matter what I see or hear;  my only pilot in life is my inner guide and it has never failed me. https://t.co/nePAgPa8Xb

@Kempez2017 @MBuhari What do you expect them to do,  a dying cow will keep kicking until it realizes that it is no longer a cow but a meal.
@UgochiJaneTrump I don't even know why people even bother about this loose head of Senate Lad. He is more like a dying chicken.

@MBuhari Great job! May his soul rest in peace. And for those insulting the present president should go and read. First he didn't overthrown him and secondly it was not Buhari who declared their govt corrupt. We take every little opportunity to insult PMB. May God forgive your ignorance.
@renoomokri @MBuhari Go and burn.
@ProfOsinbajo Great
@Victoria_NGR If I tell you that there's a simple solution to all these people. Most of them are crying for their spilled milk.
@Victoria_NGR I don't really think they are problem but they a challenges the present government needs to take us to the next level. I personally love challenges, they give me numerous clues to getting there. I do more when I do nothing.

@DrJoeAbah I served in Ebonyi as a  NYS Corp member. And I loved them with passion. Hard working people and welcoming.
@DrJoeAbah When a governor synch with any president in power such state will blossom. A real governor should understand that he is the president of his state and he should work selflessly to see the his people enjoy the dividend of democracy.
You are great! https://t.co/M5Huqti5wH
He is one of the most beautiful at heart president Nigeria will ever produce. Baba has our interest at heart but how are we seeing him? Tyrant, dictator,  evil,  killer. May God help my beautiful country. https://t.co/JAgplvrzgs
That guy has nothing in there. The worst ever in Nigeria history. I have watched him several times conducting seatings. It has always been one mishaps and uproar. I don't just synch with that cab fag. https://t.co/z5KcbTjpM0
I can bet you! Atiku is major problem in the country. You will not understand this. And as for Buhari,  I do strongly believe that he is doing his best no matter what we are going true. Sincerely speaking, I still throw my weight on him. He is not even afraid to loss election . https://t.co/xFPrxqnZAu
@ImeAkan3 I don't get it. How is that Atiku is getting higher score? Well Nigerians are always fond of new things even if they pass integrity and safety test. And above all full of hoping on empty promises.
@DrJoeAbah I actually thought it was the driver that was killed until I read and realized that even his boss was also killed. He may not have been even be treated well by his boss. That's truly what life is all about. Only God can help us.
@ProfOsinbajo Happy+1 my president. I'm so pleased with you and your boss; may God grant you pair great intelligence to lead Nigerians to the next level.
@DrJoeAbah @muftimenk I follow, learn and educate others with the little I know. The overall is that I'm here to learn because in reality man only stop learning when leaves for the great beyond.
@IsmaeelAhmedB I have not met him but I take him as my mentor. I wished one day I will have a handshake from him. I just love him for him. Those calling him otherwise should go and eat grass.
@IsmaeelAhmedB Anyone criticizing Osibanjo is a cow and need green grass to be ok
@DrJoeAbah Fighting corruption in democracy is very impossible because the criminals are not necessarily our presidents but the senators,  governors and those who are supposed to represent the common man.
@DrJoeAbah Military should come and overhaul the country for a year or two. Civilians are the worst criminals ever. The money these our good for nothing blocked head senators earn doing nothing is too much.
@Bashola_Balogun @Hlimited @Nass We need one year of military rule to come and overhaul these civilian criminals.
@Victoria_NGR @Hlimited Yes! Bastard pen robbers. I'm very angry with PMB right now because these guys earn so much and do nothing. They should return all our money. The worst of it is that they are blocked heads.
@Hlimited Anyone who does not know that politician against Buhari is criminal he dead doomed to life. God will destroy them all. Above all what these guys earn is too enormous. So many of them are very stingy. That only extend stolen funds to their supporters. No stealing no giving.
@Ayourb He wants to be importing from China easily without being questioned. You should know that China is a house hold name for every fake minded business man. China this China that.
@miss_ayomide @Akinolaolanira1 Where did he get 13m children out of sch.? I don't get it. Many states offer free educatn. Do dey need 2 be horse whipped to go to sch. Some of us don't even 've opportunities dey 've now yet we strived 2 sch. ourselves. I really dislike wen pple fool others wit wishy-washy info
@miss_ayomide @Akinolaolanira1 Very true dear. Talked about contractors &amp; MDG which started in PDP era; and nothing was done. Sure P PDP it was very much of a scam. Nothing PMB &amp; Prof brings that doesn't work effectively. Those contractors are his close allies. I see some block head clapping  4 him.
He said nothing out of the ordinary and nothing is special about what he said. Personally,  he only talked about MDG and contractors. Is that the problem of Nigerians? 13million out of school! Where? https://t.co/0pgvhQEdjO
@renoomokri Great words!
@MrSmart92014543 Stop inviting trouble to the south. Are you aware that some BH are using twitter?
@SPNigeria Saraki is not worth representing Nigerians anywhere. Saraki shouldn't be allowed anywhere to represent this country.
@oluwasegunowa @PreshOgar @MBuhari @segalink @APCNigeria How do you evaluate political performance of an administration? Do you know how many people this man has given hope based on his signature to sundry important documents? NOUN law graduate can now be called to bar?
@uniqueifunaya @PreshOgar @MBuhari That's perfect truth to reckon with
@DrJoeAbah This is very very terrible! I do hope the cockroach did lick the 🍻 foam in your mustache? It must be have attracted to you because of your beer breathe. 😂
@DrJoeAbah Doctor what's going on here? Errxplain! I still don't gerrt it.
@UgochiJaneTrump At the end they blame PMB to fix everything in just four years. Well they believe his Mr. Fix it overnight. I think they very well correct because he fixed almost everything they find difficult to do in 16 years.
@DrJoeAbah @wizkidayo It is a star way of communication 😂
@ProfOsinbajo Some only need 1k to begin their journey in life. Anyone who do not sustain the good will of their leaders can't be a leader. We must always start somewhere in life. Who said traders money can't increase to a million tomorrow? We must always begin a journey with a step now.
In Nigeria politics everyone is leader and that is the cause of our poverty and deprivation. All over the world leaders are sustained for them to give the best. No matter who rules us if this is not corrected Nigerians will keep suffering.
The greatest challenge in Nigeria politics and democracy is that 99% of those privileged to hold one key position in any of the political strata drives desperately either to retain it or do whatever it takes to topple their immediate boss.
I don't hate Atiku but his desperation to be president. I bet you brother. If he thus win, I believe I will be here to see what the fit is going to achieve. Our problem in Nigeria is not leadership but purely the way we see life. Everyone wants to lead no one wants to follow. https://t.co/eNFkhSKLZS

@ProfOsinbajo This is the only government where all government machinery are working efficiently except that the usual free money is no longer their. I think it is a government that you have no option to than be creative to exist. I am glad that you guys are giving to depends in various forms
Do you know that some persons only need 1000 Naira quantum leap? Have you experienced poverty? Do you know as we speak some has nothing in their stomach except air, water and perhaps left overs from waste basket? Do you know N1k can help some kid pay school fees?

@renoomokri @PeterObi @atiku @officialEFCC We all know that Mbaka is a priest craft like any other Nigeria pastors.
@renoomokri @PeterObi @atiku @officialEFCC And for Obi, he said anyone above 71 years is not fit to be president when PMB and I believe Atiku is above 71 years?
@renoomokri @PeterObi @atiku @officialEFCC Peter Obi has no issues that has yet been known; I steal I'm not caught doesn't mean I am not a thief but Atiku has a bunch of it that is already waning down obi's person. Let Atiku travel to US to at least prove himself worthy to contest as a president.
@DrJoeAbah He has lost his spiritual touch.

@UgochiJaneTrump Buhari remains the best for Nigerians. No matter the number of books people write to be recognized.
@UgochiJaneTrump It's a 4 yr strategic management course. It's merely a plagiarized strategic management text book. Anyone can write anything. Write a book that can be read and comprehend by an average Nigerian. Most of d things he even wrote are things dis administration has already touched.
Has anyone read Atiku's text book, he called policy plan? I feel it a plagiarized strategic management text book Obi has downloaded from the internet and edited for Nigerians to peruse. It's more than a four years' university strategic management course. 😂

@the_davidatta I don't even know how these numbskulls become who the hell they become. This country needs people with the real intelligence and experience of leadership. Nepotism is really a frazzling economic and political anomalies. Useless!
@the_davidatta Watch all the clips of all Senate seatings he presides over it is all fucked! ducked! And crapped.
@the_davidatta You are even applauding a numskull bulshit. Saraki doesn't worth a Senate member let alone a president that he his in Buhari administration. He has no intelligence nor any shit carriage you talked about. I'm really embittered to see that people even considers him a person. Shit!
@UgochiJaneTrump @OfficialPDPNig Perfectly true. I don't understand what is wrong with us. I can't even imagine that Atiku could even have mosquito as its supporter. But it is really funny that victims of corruption are still following their abductor. Wise up my brothers and my sisters.
You are really beautiful at heart. Prof. has nothing loose. We stand with him strong. https://t.co/FKQL9dG7tO
Whoever that is benefiting from PMB social programs and still castigating him is an enemy of the country and a buffon.
@GEJonathan I love every leader because they all have one good thing they will be remembered for and a mistake they will be scolded for; for man is perfect in creation but still evolving to understand.
@GEJonathan Great piece there!
PDP introduced SURE-P and You-Win, you didn't benefit from any. APC initiated N-Power and other National Social Investment Programmes, you became a beneficiary without being a member of APC, yet you are joining to say PDP is better. If PDP was better, would you be at this level?
@UgochiJaneTrump To be used to corruption is the worst of a vice.
@UgochiJaneTrump I'm just too pleased with this administration has it separate the real from the unreal. Npower alone is a score for. Nothing this man touches that doesn't work. Working perfectly without dents of corruption. I've ten of my ally benefiting from this yet they don't like PMB.

@MBuhari @NCDCgov Thanks a lot Your Most Esteemed Excellence. We your fans love and cherish great work. May God help us to see our upcoming generations lead and better life.

@Amy_Siskind Is that even possible? I mean can he meet with Putin unnoticed? Trump is too big to swim on such shallow water unnoticed.
RT @olajadex: @TorToridb @abideenoludare @atiku @APCNigeria Probably there was no need to invite him.... We are OK with the one that was in…
@atiku So funny! You are looking for love or sympathy from electorates? Who can intimidate you? Have you join Dino Melaye Studio shoot? Atiku you are too big to be intimidated if at all there is any!
@atiku Go sleep Atiku! You have failed already. Nigeria is doing well without you. What a hilarious question or quote.
@IsmaeelAhmedB Npower is working wonders. Thanks Buhari and company!
@Victoria_NGR @martinsmartine1 @MBuhari Very lady there!
@martinsmartine1 @MBuhari Very very very true
Atiku going to plan in Dubai is an indication dat he is among those dat don't see anything good about a country he wants to preside over. Only criminals engage in such act. Nigeria is 2 big 4 d nonsense they are doing. Let him go &amp; contest in Dubai. Spending our stolen funds.
@UgochiJaneTrump I'm with you on this 24/7. Tell them because we Nigerians forget the past too easily.
@DrJoeAbah We are born noise makers coupled with our ego of showing off what we got.
@MBuhari The people who love you are more than these haters paid or ignorantly condemning you here. And your programs are working for the common man. Bring Uduaghan closer to your cabinet. He is such a great person you can use to give the best in democracy.
@MBuhari All what Nigerians are good at is to condemn that is why we are short of great people. If we keep condemning our leaders Nigeria will remain like this. Every leader is great at one thing or the other which is sure when we lost them we end up crying foul.
@MBuhari Carry go! God help you with strength and wisdom to continue in your wonderful works.
Granted bail and a known threat; that's madness. They gave Kanu bail and where is he right now? Trying to create a rift between Nigeria and Israel. Whatever we want we will see. You guys should not destroy the country because of democracy and excess freedom to misbehave. https://t.co/JJykGGga9p
@DefenceInfoNG We shouldn't be talking about this because I hate whoever break rules. Army will not just shoot for no reason mostly at a northerner. We all understand that you don't cross a military man let alone a vehicle pack of them. Any funny move is disrespect and you pay for it.
You are a very evil person. Go on research to know about shites. You better don't support evil that will consume you. https://t.co/BTQxlUIsoe
@fkeyamo Most people against Buhari knows nothing about democracy. They just follow and say what enemies of Buhari and democracy say. If people can say Uduaghan did nothing in delta State then what can I say again. Nigerians love living on others. Very funny. They support criminals.
@fkeyamo I will vote Buhari one billion years to come. He still stand tall to tell you to vote any candidate of your choice. Whether he wins or loses he remain steadfast. I think that alone is OK for me. Cheers!
https://t.co/RIEoNJd6ZN
@atiku Stop  making noise.
Buhari is more intelligent than you can imagine. Thanks! https://t.co/WlYc8ynhHg
Are you encouraging polygamy or what are you saying? https://t.co/E1sPbQZ6Cy
@MBuhari If they give unah chance, unah go kill  my president. When he leaves you people will begin to cry again. Me I know say Baba is doing great and I want say make e come back to continue his good works. God bless Nigeria.
@fkeyamo APC till 2023. All hail B&amp;A!
Nothing dey happen https://t.co/PsUHIOvWCe
APC is winning Delta State this time. Great Ogboru won't be robbed this time. https://t.co/l19z1l6GXv
That's why Delta State has remained as it were from the date of creation. https://t.co/akEq3PV67C
He is not creating jobs he is coming to steal jobs. https://t.co/DQHacIumqD
@MBuhari I think what Buhari need is to change all the old cronies in the polity to young chaps. We will help fast track your intentions for this country.
@MBuhari I will vote Buhari anytime any day without a job; If Atiku give me 1M dollars I will never vote him. Mark my words anytime any day. Atiku and Obasanjo has ruled this country for complete 8 years. That's enough for them
You will repeat this message if Atiku happens to come in. Buhari started Npower and it has been wonderful. Buhari has touched many poor people's lives. Ok https://t.co/weXmF7WzWr
@MBuhari Don't limit yourself to Abuja only. It's time for rugged movement around the whole Nigeria. And I also think communication with the people has been so poor. Communication is a great apparatus to let your subjects knows u care for them. Do more of communication to silent d demons.
@MBuhari God bless Nigeria! God bless our President Buhari!
@MBuhari You are the man
@MBuhari Very true! But do we have the right sight to see these things?
@MBuhari @Zahrahmusa They are servants of evil. You have reduced their offerings and Tithing. The stolen funds the politicians remit for spiritual assistance is no longer there. What do you expect. Jesus was killed by highly religious men. Religion has never been separated from politics.
@toluogunlesi @osita_chidoka Nigeria is not worth any good government. Let them vote Buhari out. Buhari meant well for the country but the demons will never make it see light. They hate him and they will cry. It is only in this government any program works without you having anyone big to push it for you.
The Demons in the country has risen against Buhari and our so called men of God can't decipher it. Well most of them are demons feeding on innocent lives.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @atiku OK oooh! Mr. Reno herdsmen
Time will tell who is mumu https://t.co/gitUXwcIS4
Really? https://t.co/cyTQBJwRXj
@MBuhari I love you Baba! Kick their asse before they kick you. Go for these bunch of criminal fast. A
@fkeyamo Don't bother yourself with what they are saying. Atiku is doomed to fail. I'm not yet in the helm of affairs in any of this country sector but one thing I know for sure is that I can tell what is true and what is lies. Buhari meant well for the country. I love him and follow.
@renoomokri This is useless. A million of Atiku and Peter Obi can't stand Buhari. Omkri stop deceiving yourself and your fans. Do you think Nigerians are foolish. PDP robbed us and Atiku is a known criminal. Restructure will create even worse pain for this country and division will set in.
@ahmed_rojas @atiku You are a great thinker and politician. You are absolutely correct but in reality he was doomed for failure. APC 2019!
@atiku Non of your promises will change your history and that your PDPs. We are only ready to see you spend your stolen wealth for the election. At least a lot of cash will exchange hands this season.
Every comment is a comment. Are you Atiku Mr. Useless comment. Stop being over useless. https://t.co/Onjni1mRkR
@atiku Nigeria is working Mr. Atiku. Naming cabinet very early is nothing because it will never put food on our table. Creating job is not a problem but the pay is most importantestically paramountical.
@atiku I love your manifesto but can I ask a question? Is it that you can't create jobs without being the president of the country?
Whatever he borrows for is self paid stuff. Some borrowing is worth it. He is not borrowing to live large but for the betterment of our great nation Nigeria. chikenah! https://t.co/g2BRCH33nu
@MBuhari May your life be beautiful and great. I just love this man and his Vice. May God enter the life of Nigerians to see the light God radiate through these duo for the country.
@MBuhari Even without money just with some security I will bring PDP to their knees. I bet you that. Democracy is not all about building structures; it's is a philosophy of hope and faith. When people have hope and faith they can live a better and happy life.
@MBuhari I wish I had money; I would spend it campaigning for Buhari.
Oyo https://t.co/nqYmvJAGqx
He has every right to blame PDP. 16 years is so much to let go of the looting and deception. Nigerians will never learn from experience. We forget so soon. https://t.co/audU0yJl6N
Educate him better https://t.co/CpQwXOTdi6
There was no rigging. It was all about knowing what to do at the right time and at the right place. It was PDP that even tried to right elections in those places. https://t.co/I0ExhaBzgk
Wow! But they said it was goodluck.  Stop sowing your seed on a wrong soil. Sentimental people end up sowing great seed in the wrong soil. Now they have thrown you out of presidential aspiration. https://t.co/5TE0R08GAm
@atiku @OfficialPDPNig I don't think you are anywhere near Buhari. It is my humble opinion. It is great to try. If you had come out in APC after Buhari undermining your age I will give you my vote but PDP is a catastrophe.
@renoomokri @MBuhari We don't hate you but I think on my own path you are a major distraction. Instead of contributing your quota of knowledge but stick to criticize Buhari. I always liked your inspiring message. You can check that out yourself.
@renoomokri @MBuhari I need just 500k to complete my office and I really don't need to borrow from banks right now. I'm truly in need of this money to accomplish some of the logistics to kick start properly. Can you help?
@NHGSFP It's working In Ekpan,  Delta State.

@topsyspecial1 @owoashiru @fkeyamo Very true.
This is a wonderful comment. Thanks! Tell them! https://t.co/iqe0234QtF
@MBuhari Tell them! they spend their creative time talking nonsense. Great Reply buddy.
Let me tell u 1 thing which I'm very sure of, my experience in life &amp; what I have seen &amp; wat I know about this country is dat dere's no time dat we 've ever appreciate our leaders. All we do is complain! I'm more sensitive dan u are but not foolish to see the writings on d wall. https://t.co/N5YQ6PbzCV
I understand all these. I have witnessed all that you can ever imagined. Tribal war,  ethnic clashes,  loss of loved ones, starvation and hardships whatever. I personally realized that all these happened because of intolerance and most times ego and at the other end politics. https://t.co/RynhMvkuJt
@aishambuhari beautiful! keep it up
@fkeyamo Whoever commit an obvious crime should not be protected. It's the person's fault not who removed him or her. More qualified persons are always there to replace vacancies. NYSC should come out and spill the real truth.
@fkeyamo Sometimes I wonder what kind of country is dis. People so selfish. See nothing good in their leadership. All we do is to condemn &amp; count their weaknesses. I think we should sustain our leaders &amp; air our needs intelligently. I'm not saying our leaders are great but they are humans
@fkeyamo Nigerians abuse everything. Take for example social media; it has now become a medium to insult and defame personalities.
@fkeyamo Nepotism is another evil bedevilling the country. Nigeria I can say with all authority is not matured for democracy. First it is too expensive and secondly, it has created more diversion and division in the country in varying front.
@fkeyamo Nigerians will never stop complaining about their leadership except we look inward to change the way we do things
@fkeyamo Some of us become somebody through varying vices. Hence to fight corruption will be a difficult one except if defined on a certain parameter.
@fkeyamo Poverty has been a major drive for Nigerians to commit all forms of crime.
@fkeyamo I think Baba has been too lenient with corruption. I'm his biggest fan. Looking at things from a bigger picture, most of us are culprit of one form of vice or the other. Birthday falsification, using a friend certificates   thus bearing his name and many others.
@AchilleusChud @fkeyamo Forgery is a big crime. Anyone caught in the act should be brought to book even after any form of apology. She should be removed. Her excuse is not genuine. Her case is clear. No matter how much I support APC. Kemi failed big time.
@oluwanonso_Esq @officialdrsif @Awwala @MBuhari 😂 but that's has brother
Mr. President give him the necessary assistance he needs to do more. But I hope they are not underpaid? https://t.co/ABYUFuRyVS

@MBuhari Great job my president. Please keep doing your best. No matter what you read from our tweets whether good or bad be motivated in your good works.
@ImohAnthony1 @MBuhari Really? That is a good one.
@XAnachuna @MBuhari Thanks for your reply.
Since my existence as a Nigerian all we do is complained about our leaders and have we really search ourselves if perhaps we the problem? I have never seen a country like Nigeria. In all our complains we still remain where we are. I personally suggest we sustain them.
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari That is very possible but people like you complained too often,  poisoned the weak minds and he was ousted out office. I did not vote. Because we prepared the voters as at then.
@HurricaneIkenna @femi_atere @rayshaisantus @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari OK oh! We shall see then!

@wezukwue @umunocha @tom2andy @basheerusman14 @SusanHenshaw50 @MBuhari Haha! You you are only wishing you and your family the fate you wish others OK. Taking Buhari out of the equation will it wipe Boko Haram and all that you complained about today? I don't blame you. You are still naive perhaps.
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari When Christ came to change the way the Pharisees and sadducees were doing things did he destroy, repeal,  annul anything? He only change the way things were done,  the way they see things and many hated him mostly d ones who have been using the process control people. Bros think.
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari Educate me! Does change mean stop, destroy, abandoned, repeal, annul? Bros I'm disappointed in you
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari And what is wrong with 3% interest rate for a thriving business. This is no political sentiment. It's true. I can prove that to you. Read other conditions associated with such loans.
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari Bros! Vote whoever you like. I'm not in a political debate with anyone.
@Ofonmbukituh @ruffturf @femi_atere @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari Whatever! Vote in whatever you like. We are in the same country together. No long thing!
@Gbrlk573 @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari then vote whoever you like. Vote in corruption.

@Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari That is my basic stance for PMB. Well structured programs. If there is fraud,  I can assure you that it is at minimum.
@Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari You right brother but this is different. I can assure you!
@Ofonmbukituh @femi_atere @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari I understand all that you can ever mentioned in terms of government responsibility. I'm enjoying all that where I resides right now except for the disturbance from PDP thugs in the state I'm resident right now.
@SunsatJ @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari @GEJonathan @AlikoDangote I never benefited from any GEJ program. They were hijacked by political criminals. That never happened in PMB Npower. My Dad is a farmer and he has enjoyed tremendously from loans from PMB projects. Transparency and integrity in all PMB processes.
@nwanneivy @femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari I don't get you! You mean you failed to see what he has done or what he has done has no effect to you? Because I'm enjoying everything he has instituted
@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari No interest in some cases with good feasible business proposal.

@femi_atere @Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari No need to discard good ideas and project. Wike is doing the same PH.
@Clinton207O @AbanisheSunday @APCUKingdom @ChunaFrank @FAAN_Official @OfficialAPCNg @apcghanachapter @ChibuikeAmaechi @hadisirika @abikedabiri @GarShehu @akandeoj Not true. You are suffering not every Nigeria. Say what you know . If you say things are expensive I will agree with you. Things are expensive does not absolutely indicate suffering. Go for what you need not what you want. And above all not everything is expensive.
@okafor_larry @AbanisheSunday @APCUKingdom @ChunaFrank @FAAN_Official @OfficialAPCNg @apcghanachapter @ChibuikeAmaechi @hadisirika @abikedabiri @GarShehu @akandeoj I disagree with you zillion times

@Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari Just 4 years in govt he has done more. There are many other projects he is going on which I believe he will execute for the good of Nigerians. And let me tell you my opinion, Nigeria need tough hands and integrity on corruption.
@Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari And many others!

@Ofonmbukituh @OIkpibako @DrHenry93426741 @MBuhari The slogan alone is a great threat to our evil leader. Let me tell you one good thing about this administration though created by GEJ, the TSA as implemented by PMB is wonderful. Another thing is that nothing under Buhari that is not effectively implemented, Npower is another.
@steveololo @MBuhari Political errand boy. Shut your toilet mouth.
@tom2andy @basheerusman14 @SusanHenshaw50 @MBuhari Buhari has not only provide arms, he has an effective arsenal to destroy terrorism and corruption.

@tinkizee2 What's all these! I can't leave without you my love. I'm very sorry even if it's beyond your breaking point. I love you so dearly my heart.
@BashirAhmaad God bless my President. God  will continue to disgrace all those who hates Nigeria and pretend to hate you. Anyone who do not wish this country well will face the wrath of God.
@Asiwaju_limited @BashirAhmaad You are people are the bad luck.
@ezekingx @BashirAhmaad stop killing yourselves and at the end tied it Buhari. We all understand the pranks the Saraki's and Atiku's are playing. You guys need to wake up and join heads and hands with Buhari to end all the nonsense in the country
@AlikoDangote RIP
@abrahamtaylour @AlikoDangote You are really funny!
@iko_2015 @APCUKingdom @uchediala @teekbrown @BuhariCentre @BashirAhmaad @Mr_JAGs exactly
@APCUKingdom @uchediala @teekbrown @BuhariCentre @BashirAhmaad @Mr_JAGs I need one
@amehlawosamuel @SPNigeria @MrStanleyNwabia @walegates Saraki body guard. What a shame!
@SPNigeria This is the right time to grab your share from stolen funds. Guys eat Saraki money without fear. Oloshi buruku!
@atiku I don't know why all Nigeria rich men must one way or the other be connected to government? All of them can't be rich or powerful except from funds from government. Where did Atiku get the money he used to create these acclaimed jobs? I can't applaud you.
@atiku Ibo people I dey advice unah nah oh!
@atiku una don start again oh! If Atiku lost oyo. Then una go Buhari bad. Una they see bad road and una insist to follow it. Nah unah sabi oh! A word is enough for the wise. Atiku go fail yakata!
@Abuche_o @atiku Really? Stop deceiving yourself.
@YouthsForAtiku @orji_law7g @Acctjujitsu @dhiwanna @atiku Done a lot! You are too blind to see because you are caused and corruption motivated
@YouthsForAtiku @dhiwanna @atiku Really? Atiku my bombom
@ifeanyispace @munie4u @SamuelRemiOlor @iamwhytestone @YouthsForAtiku @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Really! He is the greatest fraud.
@iamwhytestone @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Zombie
@UgwuapehNnenna @sultanibk @ebuka_de @atiku Emma Atiku is absolutely no choice. The only who stands tall above them all still remain Buhari. I think Buhari should be thinking of grooming a young chap that can take over from him. Saraki is dinning and winning with renowned political armed robbers
@UgwuapehNnenna @ebuka_de @atiku You can't be serious. This guy is confirmed thief.
@atiku You can create jobs without being a president. Above all you were once a president and I think that was enough for you to do great.
What the guy said is true. Must he be a president before he creates jobs. Stop being sentimental. Buhari has created a lot of jobs. Npower is one of them. A lot of recruitment has taken place that you are not aware of or you are not qualified for or you didn't just applied for. https://t.co/0dmwdR3fkT
You are very funny! But right! Saraki is nobody; why bother about a ranting dog. 😂 https://t.co/FkSyLVXA1G

You people have always wished him dead but he will always rise from the ashes like a phoenix. God will disgrace every self centered and egoistic person in this country. https://t.co/z9rgkdZAoH
@MrAbuSidiq He has political ambition to be president,  he could have let Buhari know now! At least he could have helped me instead of playing pranks with the baby senators and mentally degraded PDP followers. He should thread softly before he will end up in Lagos lagoon.
It's better to be on sick bed than running to the mentally and bodily sick for help. You guys will never get sense. Mentally retarded fellows. I will prefer to follow a sick righteous man than follow an evil healthy man. https://t.co/xj5iDzxUT8
@gloria_adagbon @MBuhari @Johannxs @akandeoj @MrAbuSidiq @Ayourb @AyooAkanji @APCUKingdom @MsTyma_ @BuhariMediaORG But why limited to three State. Kick start it every where if possible. Engage the right banks and advertising agents to make it known to everyone.
@gloria_adagbon @MBuhari @Johannxs @akandeoj @MrAbuSidiq @Ayourb @AyooAkanji @APCUKingdom @MsTyma_ @BuhariMediaORG I'm a Buharian and I think this is coming too late. Politicians will never be wise. I have seen that the follies of man makes him suffer from mental deprivation. I will vote Buhari with or without this late program. I have already benefited from Npower program at least.
I'm coming for you. https://t.co/OhNLXdDPkg
@APCUKingdom @Ayourb @Mofiobafemi @abikedabiri @GarShehu @akandeoj @femigbaja @trueNija All who defected to PDP are selfish and egoistic politicians. If we are all sincere and non partisan it is clear that Buhari is a good man hated by sinners who can't stand the sight of good.
Dino are you one of the street science student? Is like you don high again. This time nah life transformer naim you go hug oh! https://t.co/WrvHw4c6zb
OK ooo! Big liars https://t.co/WrvHw4c6zb
You guys in the Federal are just making Saraki popular. He is not even recognized as a good person in his home. He is called master of poverty. He is good for creating poverty. So be careful not to be entangled into his web of impoverishing the country.
@kakra68 That means Saraki is actually a dog?
@SPNigeria Bukola is just playing cards with his colleagues. What a show. He wants to become Nigeria president. What an ambition. We are waiting and watching your political master play. That's interesting. Don't forget that whatever you and Atiku is planning is the hands of the great.
Evil is always very conspicuous except you are also evil you can't see it or you pretend not to see it; and if this is the case don't blame God or Devil for your woes.
PMB has nothing close to evil. He is the only hope for the stability of the country for now. All of them are criminals. https://t.co/Ebmo7ujzWK
Very wrong brother. PDP are certified looters. No disagreement about it. So what do have to say now? You better 🏃. PDP is the same as Satan. https://t.co/0yH7cSDZwK

@APCUKingdom @OfficialAPCNg @apcghanachapter @apcyouthomoodua @fkeyamo @GarShehu @akandeoj @gebusites @hbgumi @abikedabiri APC is the best. If we miss it we will cry for ever. Nothing is as bad as loosing a good wife to an evil friend.
@Mr_JAGs @sanitukurPT I thought Daura is Buhari cousin that by the way. What matters is that you should appoint those that are in harmony with your vision as far as they qualified for the job.
@fkeyamo Saraki and all his defectors to PDP are the brains behind all the killings in the country. Those guys should be put to serious probing.
You are very intelligent. It was political gimmick. https://t.co/08BDiLPOrv
Lack of job? Job has never been a wow in Nigeria but shit! Are you blaming him for job? You missed it bro! Buhari is the best. Look for something doing brother until this man makes things right for us and our unborn generations. Thanks https://t.co/v4qjyovkDC
@Seuntemitayo4 @Nigerian___man @Rasollam @fkeyamo I can see that only mumu will call someone mumu
@Nigerian___man @Rasollam @fkeyamo You need your mind re-examined. What the heck are you talking about. You hate Nigerians. It's not just an opinion; you are really blind
@fkeyamo Only blinded idiot will not see that the political gamblers are at it again. Pen robbers can't survive without PDP. I am really ashamed of Saraki and Tanbuwal. Do these guys have kids,  wife; relations? What an absolute shame. Buhari is the best to stabilize this country.
@renoomokri Those defecting to PDP are political gamblers. We are all aware of that. The confused followers will always up along. I respect you because your blindness seems understood by your blinded friends. Oloshi!
@renoomokri PDP is an absolute evil. Omokri d waste bin. Armed robbers. U should b ashamed of urself. PDP are well known criminals. And even the ones you guys associates yourself with are known criminals. D ones coming out 4 president are confirmed pen robbers. U better go sleep 4 gutter
@HEDankwambo You will do great but I  insist work with Buhari. That's the only trusted man against corruption for now. He should finish the work he has started.
@HEDankwambo If you don't have anything with Sars while talk about them. Police has every right to search anyone whether you are clean or dirty. Sars do your job. Only rule breakers and criminals complain or argue with a police officers
If you don't have any business with Sars while bother yourself with it? I https://t.co/28xZcg8OeO

Corrupt people will never see anything good in good for our generation unborn. Thanks Mr. President. God will help you through your fight against corrupt Elites of this wonderful country.
What business do you have with Sara? I don't even know when I have issues with a police officer let alone Sars https://t.co/m9ZYHOJqGN
To sack people is democratic move? https://t.co/Pjiwwh3aSM
For what? https://t.co/EkfBE0Qy9G
@HEDankwambo Wait till PMB complete his tenure. I'm beginning to wonder why you guys will never allow this man to finish his great work for Nigeria. You guys will not make it this time.
@HEDankwambo I'm not against your ambition but it clear that anything from PDP is evil. You may actually be a good person but your premise of existence is sour and evil. Anyone bringing Atiku is an enemy of the country. Atiku has ruled this country with OBJ I think that is enough for him.
@HEDankwambo If you are that really great as par your words and as affirmed by others that is wonderful but I think it would have been better if you had contributed and aligned your knowledge with PMB. Dankwambo wait till Baba finish balancing the country.
@ShehuSani If shehu na APC then I think something they wrong. I mean he posts like opposition.
@ShehuSani This guy nah APC? I think say nah PDP.
Please we should love this country. PMB is great. https://t.co/1rdMf7dNj3
@NGRPresident Great job. This one nah perfect truth. A lot is ongoing in warri sea port. I know you can make Nigeria a great place. I pray for you guys every moment. The enemies of Nigeria are warming up seriously take power again. I believe all those who love you do that without penny.
@osxtus626 @lanreolukanni @yiamcj @NGRPresident GEJ was good but from my little understanding corruption was fully kitted up.
He is not really building more. They were not there before now and even they were they have degenerated to no use. He is working on warri seaport. Dredging and renovation has commenced. I live in warri. We should applaud and encourage leaders but your statement is on point. https://t.co/v4QOEVv41t
Every Nigerian is a politician in social media.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @officialEFCC @OfficialPDPNig @inecnigeria Let EFCC do their job Mr. America PDP. Oh are you scared perhaps we report your bad mouthing to EFCC. Fayose younger brother!
@dino_melaye Political ASHAWO! ASHAWO no be work oh!  Nah management oh!
@renoomokri Cross carpeting is pure sign of selfishness. It is called political whoredom. Saraki and Tanbuwal are political ASHAWO. Shameless.
@renoomokri Reno u are of no good to dis country. ur mind is in hibernation. u are more in a remote controlled state of existence. Stop tweeting poisons. We are dynamic generation dat can decipher truths from shambles. Living in America and photocopying people's writings 4 urs is no writing
@realwan @MBuhari @ChibuikeAmaechi @GarShehu @fkeyamo If God is love; love will triumph over evil.
@realwan @MBuhari @ChibuikeAmaechi @GarShehu @fkeyamo My prayer these days is that God help Nigeria. Because the evil ones will not rest to see that Buhari is dead or removed from power. All I pray God help Nigerians to understand. Because it is obvious that Nigerians are under spell. God is all I asked for help for my country.

@MrAbuSidiq Very true! But will Nigerians understand this. I do solemnly hope they see this and join hands in enduring the graveyard is walled up with spiritual inhibitors.
@MrAbuSidiq A man sees failure because he is an outright failure. At my level in life I see success even in the worst situation. I think only failures see failure.
@APCUKingdom @apcghanachapter @APCYouthUK @apcyouthomoodua @OfficialAPCNg @abikedabiri @GarShehu @akandeoj @Mr_JAGs @Busaayo This babe fine shah! I only APC can get this kind of beauty.
@renoomokri @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig Polished phoney empty message. Worst of it,  he has followers. What a pathetic nation. Only unintelligent men are afraid of nothing.
@renoomokri @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig Ajebutter as Senate President! What do you expect. These guys are just fortunate idiots. Let guys that went to school of hard knocks man this position. I wonder most times hoe matured intelligently shaped men will seat and be watching Bukola Saraki speaks in halo chamber. Yack!
@renoomokri @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig Why won't he cross carpet I mean
@renoomokri @OfficialAPCNg @OfficialPDPNig I won't he cross carpet? That's a very shallow prediction. He is a boy to Saraki. Saraki dictates the pace of Kwara politics. Except you are as naive as Bukola.
Bukola Saraki has good phoney as we call it but lacks the inner intelligence as a leader. The PDP saw it an capitalize on it. I think he made the greatest mistake leaving APC. To me is an ajebutter with political privileges. I won't call him a thug but a political mistake.
Most times when I watch Bukola Saraki talks in the Senate I wonder i how a primary one pupil conducted the assembly in my days in the village as the head boy. You know little children words can be very catchy though incoherent. But that was my first and my last till this day.
@GovAyoFayose Your talk talk make you lose election. You no dey shame self? Stop talking! Hide your face. Olodo rabatah.
@fkeyamo I wish I could flog all the useless senators defecting. They are vision less leaders. They complain about Goodluck now Buhari. These guys are psychically unstable.
@fkeyamo You are very correct. It is only dogs that eat their vomits.
@NGRPresident A child kept in a shelf for protection after wrong doings has exposed himself because of a mosquito buzz. Ortom. Let him face his corruption charges. Does it mean he can't manage all the ones he stole in the last political dispensation? No more opportunities to thief.
@NGRPresident Everything president Buhari! What has this great man did to you guys. Above all it is d best time to track Ortom. It is clear that he has been the one causing the problem in that state. Killing ur own people &amp; indicting herdsmen. Nigerians be wise. I hope EFCC will do their job
@MBuhari These herdsmen issues is painting your administration very badly. Evil politicians and their ignorant and corrupted souls are using it so badly in the streets to mal your personality.
@MBuhari These herdsmen issue should be arrested once and for all. You are denting your administration by not bringing it to a halt. I know you are a great leader but since the populace are calling you into the issue which on my part is the work of the security agents.
@NGRPresident @MBuhari For your information it not all Nigerians that are agitators. Only the political blinds and criminals of PDP and corruption infested people that are saying Buhari should leave. Selfish idiots. What killings are u talking about? Nigerians stop dis nonsense attitude b4 God smite us
@NGRPresident @MBuhari @PresidenceTg @GeorgeWeahOff Buhari my best!
@fkeyamo If we lost Buhari again we will cry till eternity. please everyone Buhari is a great leader to come by. This man is great leader. And above all we should strive to look at a man's good side rather than the evil decorations by his haters and haters of your good.
@renoomokri What is your business with APC affairs. If APC crumbles how does that affect you Mr. Busy body.
@MBuhari I need money to start up small business for survival oh! Please my president. I need it oh! Please!
@MBuhari The Abacha loot should be shared equally to everybody. I have not seen anyone come to my place of residence to take my details. I need it desperately to survive and become a better person oh!
@Chochaonyenku @GovAyoFayose What nonsense positive change?
@Otega62605728 @GovAyoFayose Who are you? Stop been politically sentimental. Fayose is a barking dog in a locked cage.
@RichpastorA @GovAyoFayose You are really funny! Fayose is an empty man. How can a governor compare himself with a bat. He must be nocturnal.
@GovAyoFayose Fayose is too mouthy. He caused his defeat. He fries garri with women and his popularly as claimed is only a weak dog backing in a cage. Fayemi won the election. No two ways about it.  I know Fayemi is going to win. Former governor is no joke in an election. His fans voted him in
@MBuhari Let Fayose go and learn how to talk as a governor. He talks trash a lot.
@ProfOsinbajo Wow I love this lines
@abikedabiri It is funny how some Nigerians support cyber crime. I had an experience with some matured men saying g-business is no crime as far as those involved are not reported by their victims. I felt very sad to hear this from a man I know to have more than two young male teens. Very bad!
@dino_melaye Dino stop behaving so so uncultured. You act more like a kid. Do you have God at all in your system? Stop playing politics with everything. You are mentor to some people so if this is what you are it is very unspeakable and preposterous.
@GovAyoFayose I think Fayose is doing every normal thing a criminal will do to avoid being caught after leaving the office.
@ProfOsinbajo What is really the issue with this present government accept that people are not get stolen funds from there political big brothers?
@dino_melaye There is nothing good about PDP and APC is falling today because the same good for nothing PDP who migrated to APC for shelter are the ones running out because the APC tenure of Buhari is almost at verge of ending and these criminals feels they are safe now to be themselves. Ole
@dino_melaye Really? That's madness. Nigeria self
@dino_melaye It's clear that Buhari is tough against corruption. They are not having the opportunity to steal. Awon ole buruku. Jangbajastic pen robber. We need to shine our eyes. This what happens when their bidding did not come through. Cross carpeting fags.
@bukolasaraki increase the capacity of Nigeria Police,  Give them sound training,  Recruit them with respect,  Give them their due entitlement,  Pay the least rank 250k. Deal with the ones that messes with the ordinary man on the streets and above all put measures in place to track cells. Etc
@KaySoyemiEsq @TunjiAndrews @bukolasaraki @PoliceNG Agree with you absolutely
@bukolasaraki Our governors are the problems of the country not the president. They're not creative. What is the need of state police when the money to fund them will end up coming from the FG. I'm not against State police for advanced states like Lagos,  Kaduna, oyo, Benin for now
@bukolasaraki State police will be a terrible move for a country whose governors are brought into power by thugs and hoodlums. Empower federal police to do their jobs. Pay these people well and above all how many states can fund any meaningful projects. This is nonsense!
@Donald_Duke Is that true with the enormous numbers of unemployed graduates?
@Donald_Duke Really?
@renoomokri @GEJonathan @elrufai Wahala dey this country oooh! All we know how to do is condemn government. I pray to be alive to your envisioned president when Buhari leaves.
@renoomokri This guy is not a pastor as some of you think. He is an inspirational talker and a political player
@renoomokri 😂
@abikedabiri Going true all these retweets it clear that we as Nigerians we don't know exactly what this government has done. I am sure when you guys are done sending APC out it will be done on u people that the evil one has visited ur minds. D only failing on dis govt is barn on importation.
@dino_melaye Nigerians should be very careful with those wanting Buhari out office because virtually all that are complaining have robust skeletons in their hidden wardrobes
@dino_melaye Really?
I don't know why every extremely rich Nigerians should not be probed. I mean both private and public servants. They destroy where they work and establish theirs.
@benmurraybruce You guys are the problems of this country. Where did get the money you used in establishing silverbird TV. I don't see why you shouldn't be proved.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon Nigeria can be great and loved if we stop playing politics but do politics. Politics is human. When we do politics we may not need to campaign to win. All those useless parties coming together to play politics will fail the people again. This is basically a converge of thieves.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon Corruption can only disappear when things are done properly. How much do an average police officer earn? How much do teachers earn? How much do we pay engineers? How much do we pay doctors? How much do you pay pharmacist? All these amounts to institutional corruption.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon If things are really good importation will stop without actually placing any barn on it. Produce quality items and the foreign ones will become useless. Our copper wire is patronize by all because it of better quality.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon I'm not very happy with the way this government is going. So much complains with proofs. Keeping the opposition politics aside APC need to appease the populace. Things are madly expensive. You can't lead hungry and and angry people effectively. Stop barn on importation.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon Anyone rearing animals do so at his expense not at other people's detriment. If they can't tame their herd which gives them money then they should call it a quit
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon I personally believe in him till date. But you should understand that I'm human and above all I understand how your people can be used to destroy your efforts. So he should be very careful about this herdsmen.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon I am very much aware that Buhari is a man of integrity but not bringing his people into serious check calls for his downfall. They destroying him and his generations. He has to take this herdsmen killing into serious consideration.
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon The killings ongoing has not spelt well for his administration. His people; his native people are destroying his administration. This is very bad for his person
@APCUKingdom @MBuhari @abikedabiri @apcyouthomoodua @APCYouthUK @apcghanachapter @DOlusegun @Mr_JAGs @MrAbuSidiq @Johannxs @hbgumi @gloria_adagbon Buhari meant well for Nigerians but I think he made a grave mistake by stopping importation. Nigeria manufacture nothing and even if we do they use western technology. Things very are expensive and Nigerians are suffering. People are complaining seriously about everything
@SaharaReporters Nigerians do not need a good man like you. They need criminals, liars and cheats. Anything you can do for the country for good do and ensure no money is left there to squander.
@SaharaReporters It should be shared equally to every living Nigerians. Every Nigerian is poor in one way or the other; including those in Government. So why only poor house old. As far as you are up to voting age. And above all do not save any money  bcos soon you leave it  will be stolen.
@TonyOElumelu That's the spirit of victory. I hope we do this with Argentina.
@mary_marysimon @MBuhari @APCUKingdom Buhari is the only patriotic leader. When he leaves all the enemies of Buhari mostly the ignorant ones will bite their lips. I truly know that Buhari is what Nigerians need.
@iam_TiwaSavage Wow Tiwa! Hmm! Unexpected friendship! Badass chick! I think I like that too. Unexpected every thing! Uh-huh!
@ProfOsinbajo Note: I'm not a businessman but I hate to see APC fall. Though it is a matter of choice.
@ProfOsinbajo People are complaining about this government because they are hungry no matter how much you are paid, it is useless at the market; things are fucking expensive. A hungry man is an angry man. This government would have been great if not for ban in importation.
@ProfOsinbajo Advice president to stop closing borders. Sanford can't provide this mighty country with what we need. Neither will rice production in few part of the country feed Nigerians. And above all it is not all Nigerians that can become farmers.
@ProfOsinbajo Great! Please you guys should stop closing bothers and preventing affordable items coming in. Nigerians are suffering because of this bad policy of border closure. I'm very much in support for combating corruption but border closure with we having put things right is evil.
@NGRPresident @ProfOsinbajo @kfayemi Na WA for all funao! Has APC really failed or it is you guys that can't grab opportunities available? I don't get it. I can see that non of you people have Nigeria at heart. If you guys wish to remain beggars I opt out. When Baba is out then you guys will cry.
@iam_TiwaSavage What is all about this wizzy thing! She has a husband I guess. So why Wizzy.
I wonder how I grew and my Dad only flogged me twice as much as I could remember;  I mean as an African father. Thanks a lot Dad! You are still bothered about well being and always so concerned about my two handsome happiness and above all my wife. Daddy I'm grateful. HFD!
Happy Father's Day Celebration!
@akin_adesina excellent
@akin_adesina great
@akin_adesina Nice one
@fkeyamo Superb! Real talk. I keep loving him even at the worst scene; even with obvious reasons to turn my back against him; even when I'm in the midst of dozens of haters.
@aishambuhari Let these units do their bids effectively. And Nigerians will be happy.
@aishambuhari What's all this restructuring in the first place? Within every state there's still hatred within its constituent unit. Nigeria as far as I could understand is already structured. We have governors,  we have senators, we have chairmen,  we have councillors. And each has functions.
@aishambuhari Great
@NGRPresident @MBuhari Happy Salah celebration
@akin_adesina @Lagarde @KGeorgieva I'm impressed!
@renoomokri @GarShehu Buhari never said all you quoted here. And above all why didn't GEJ work with the promises you claimed Buhari professed. I believe GEJ was still president when Buhari was campaigning.
@jeleelagboola @renoomokri @OnwardNG @GarShehu I think we need to see this
@Belluchii_NG @renoomokri @GarShehu Very correct
@mary_marysimon @renoomokri @GarShehu I love your tweet
@SavageRhythm_yx @renoomokri @TEHILLAH444 @martinsmartine1 @GEJonathan How? Tyrant is an awkward adjective and terribly evil to use such words on your president.
@OkpalanwaTim @ObochiSamuel @renoomokri @martinsmartine1 @GEJonathan Is He Buhari doing the killing
@Legbosh1 @renoomokri @martinsmartine1 @GEJonathan Really?
@NGRPresident @MBuhari My Great President more grace and life for your good work. Love you more!
@bukolasaraki That I guess is cleansing ritual. It's good to go for mental and spiritual purification. And I hope this will last for a year or more.
@NGRSenate @bukolasaraki @dino_melaye @SPNigeria @nassnigeria @realAndyUba @SenIsahMisau @rose__oko Great job
@renoomokri Yes! he is! As a father and president he doesn't need to flog a son who cares for his reputation.
@Aruscom @ShehuSani Exactly! Practical needs for the populace must be discussed and excited.
@ShehuSani To stop human trafficking our system must meet the world standards of living. If we can't pay the right wages and provide enabling environment for existence such call for a stop will just be temporary.
@ShehuSani The governor of such state should be called to order. He has the power to put a stop to such heinous crime.
I think we need to understand that our governors are the problems of our states. I believe a Governor is the power of state. We should stop condemning the president and focus on our governors
@nkemania @MBuhari @Goodgrief_IXI Great truth
@MBuhari Great job my president. God bless you
Those who condemn PMB should know that he has signed into law bills that are very scary for most past presidents. Bills are the voice of the people. And Nigerians should strive to read and understand bills to see if they fully represent their interests. Bill is your voice.

@AkinwunmiAmbode Bros where are the farms producing these rice?
@renoomokri @MBuhari You no pass the military men Abhi?
@Austin81530375 @renoomokri @MBuhari You must be a novice.
@renoomokri @bukolasaraki @ProfOsinbajo This is a different issue dude. This is thuggery and robbery.
@renoomokri @MBuhari When this man leave you guys will never ever find anyone as close as good as him. Let him lay the excellent foundation for this country. I pray God save Nigerians from people like Omkri.
@renoomokri @MBuhari May God help you Reno. How does that affect you. Leave this man alone.
@MBuhari Very correct your excellence. May God help Nigeria. Please don't keep Obasanjo aside because he is also my man. You guys should resolve your differences. He has also done well for this country. No matter how aggrieved he is don't be angry with him or anyone just do your best.
@MBuhari Buhari is doing this for second term. If you guys miss this man we finished. Let him correct all these wrongs in country. Please Your excellency do your best and leave the rest. I personally love you. God bless Nigerians. I will stand by you until you done. Thanks
@MBuhari Great work my president!  May the almighty God of creation bless and adorn with honours. Please scrapping HND is good but it should be expediently excellent to ensure that those of us with HND to return our certificate for B. Tech otherwise we may not have jobs.
@daily_trust You will not be able to do this alone and no time is usually enough. All you need to do is to set up proper machinery in place to checkmate it execution.
@NGRPresident @MBuhari God will help this country to know what is good for them. Just do your best my president and I am confident that when you leave this position they will cry and never find someone like you. And hopefully my children will not see dismay.
@GabrielOjiefoh @bukolasaraki Very much true. He is always in two forms.
@bukolasaraki He wants to impeach the president? 😂
@bukolasaraki I have not watch any of their movies. Very funny!
@benmurraybruce @innosonvehicles @NGSuperEagles Great job
@renoomokri Wonderful words of encouragement. Great job Dude
@MBuhari Understand that I'm not a businessman but an ordinary Nigerian who loves your fight against corruption. Note corruption is not an individual thing but institutional failure.
@MBuhari You are a great leader but the greatest mistakes in your administration was the ban on importation. And it's still a major cause of the rift in your administration. Things ought to be in place before the implementation. Address this issue and every Nigerian will smile.
@MBuhari Agreed but the cost of items in the market is madness. Please address this promptly. My desire for you is to win second term but I can tell you that Nigerians aren't happy at the cost of things in the market; I mean Nigerians are damn hungry.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote An angry man is a hungry man; Nigerians are angry because of hungry.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote Baba see to the prices of things if you wish to win the heart of Nigerians.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote I personally believe in the present administration fight against corruption but things are crazily expensive. Please you guys should see to this expediently.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote People are hungry. Food is a concern for the young and old.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote I think the core scourge in the country right now is the prices of things. Our little money can't sustain us. I bet you if this is addressed everyone may end up happy
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote I do hope you guys understand that there is wailing in the land. No matter the cash at hand it's really difficult with the prices of things in the market. Everything is trippled
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote I hope every Nigerian understand this. You are doing great because you have access to funds.
@NGRPresident @AlikoDangote Farmers making more money than people living in the city is ridiculous. There should be a balance as things are becoming very heavily expensive.
@iam_TiwaSavage Are talking about cucumber?
@renoomokri You could have suggested it rather than criticizing the government. Who said you can't advice your enemy? The Bible admonished us to pray for our enemy. Reno make your criticism in a positive way.
@renoomokri Yahoo business is evil. No one should encourage it directly or indirectly. Stop this yahoo symposium
@MBuhari @NGSuperEagles This is great commitment from presidency. Great job.
@renoomokri Power has improved so well Mr Reno! Sincerely speaking. Buhari has improved on other past government projects.
@renoomokri I enjoy steady power where I live.haha!
@renoomokri Buhari is good for the country for now. Let him complete his job. People dread this guy. He is stern. Buhari is fighting a dangerous battle that needs our assistance. Corruption is a deadly virus.
@renoomokri Buhari implements but Jonathan formulates
@renoomokri With TSA implementation Buhari has achieved a lot but I learnt GEJ started the project
@renoomokri From what Omkri mentioned, it is pathetic to know that for three years that is what Jonathan did. I think you are wrong. Jonathan did more than that. But I think Buhari has achieved a lot through his Npower program. Buhari is great in all aspects.
@daily_trust @ShehuSani @benmurraybruce @OfficialAPCNg @GovKaduna Decamp my brother. It is the best option for betrayals like you.
Obj should stop barking otherwise more sand will enter his eyes and mouth. I can't really understand him at.
A dog in a locked cage should never back because if does the strong will pour sand in his eyes.
@bukolasaraki @PLACNG @nassnigeria @HonAliAhmad @DrTedros @ToyinSaraki @nighealthwatch @babaidris090 @OnemolaOlu Blaming the president for everything is preposterous and it should stop. Well I'm very pleased with the move by Senate President. I believe their are persons delegated to handle the medicals. Hence they should do their jobs diligently.
@bukolasaraki @PLACNG @nassnigeria @HonAliAhmad @DrTedros @ToyinSaraki @nighealthwatch @babaidris090 @OnemolaOlu The problem in Nigeria is enormous. I think the disparities between professions should be stopped. No profession is superior to other. It is a matter of choice. A doctor is not superior to a pharmacist. Neither is a pharmacist more superior to a doctor.
@ShehuSani Evil sympathizers. We should stop talking too much and hyping issues. It will solve nothing. No issues without solutions. Many of the sympathies on social media are useless. Go to the bereaved and help out.
@TonyElumeluFDN @Zainabsauraniya @TonyOElumelu @EmmanuelMacron @UBAGroup I have heard of your great concerns and contributions to the lives of talented youths. I will need your help to cope with my newly incorporated company. Thanks
Uduaghan the former governor of Delta State can rule these country very effectively after Baba finish his tenure. I love Uduaghan. He is a leader whose impacts can be felt by anyone on the streets.
@ShehuSani @MBuhari Buhari is doing great. Former minister of finance, I believe she is written a book on the dangers of fighting corruption. People against Buhari have corruption tendency or may be ignorant of what happened before now.
@ShehuSani With the level of tribalism and religious hypocrisy it is  very clear we can't afford a good. So many evil is happening in these fronts. I'm so unhappy that I'm in country that we celebrate evil over light. My contemporaries are even the worst. The country is seriously in mess.
If life continues with the lies therein the world will destroy itself. Though the physical may be able to adapt to lies but the spirit man will end in perturbation and the end result is disaster.
@renoomokri Great talk
Running a good government is like running a good family. Naturally every element in a family has its role any short fall on one will affect the rest drastically.
Security challenges, poverty and many other evils that befalls us are as result of improper reasoning and plans for the morrow.
How would you agree to such a video even if it is true. Listening to the man's voice on the video it is clear that such a good voice of a man will ever made such blunders https://t.co/POsxoAfsrn
You should understand also that most appointments are politically influenced so this is not enough to define the president unintelligent. https://t.co/PZA36nf6aa
I'm very unpleased how people go to the extreme of politically maiming people. #IGP speech# is unbelievable. I don't know him but it quite obvious that a man with such a good voice will be struggling with words. We should stop all these dirty politics.
There is always an individual priority in life at one time or the other in ones life stay but one that I'm deprived of right now is freedom to be me and the freedom to act in the likeness of good without reprimand.
Feeling terribly bad as I watch nonsense happening at my workplace. I'm feeling uneasy as I see people who condemn persons in government doing the likes of what they complain. OMG!
Corruption is more of an institutional thing than an individually perceived evil.
