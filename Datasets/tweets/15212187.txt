Here's even more catalogued claims of Warren's racial fraud. 		https://t.co/pYcVNZRr2G
It is impossible to argue that Warren claimed to be a "person of color" so she could used the advantages in the system to advance her career with no evidence (to this day) that she is actually Native American.
Also, Warren was identified by Harvard Law as a ‚Äúwoman of color‚Äù on official documents and Harvard promoted Warren‚Äôs hire as expanding their campus diversity by hiring a woman with "minority background" onto their faculty.		Warren never publicly objected to this.
Also, after becoming a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Warren demanded the University change her faculty listed ethnicity from ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to ‚ÄúNative American.‚Äù
Also, Elizabeth Warren self-identified as a "Native American" in the The Association of American Law Schools Directory of law professors in every edition printed between 1986 -1995.
Also, this article about diversity in Ivy League Law Schools classified Elizabeth Warren as Harvard Law's "first woman of color.‚Äù		Fordham Law Review, 1997 https://t.co/ghEt7NCGml
Also, Elizabeth Warren used offensive, racially charged language to defend her claims of Native American heritage, declaring that her family had ‚Äúhigh cheekbones‚Äù like ‚Äúall the Indians do.‚Äù 		Here is video of that moment: https://t.co/coVdCTcczF
Also Elizabeth Warren submitted multiple recipes for the Indian cookbook ‚ÄúPow Wow Chow‚Äù and signed her name, ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren - Cherokee‚Äù https://t.co/lDq8BEGnhB
Elizabeth Warren in a recent speech:		‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a person of color.

There is the only *one* reason for the horrific death of this little girl: It is our open borders. 		Period.		They act as magnets for evil criminals to prey on poor, vulnerable migrants - like this little girl.		Her blood is on their hands.		Not our border patrol agents.
I just got off a call with DHS officials. 	This child was horrifically sick as she was brought into our country because of her horrific treatment by smugglers.	Our border agents did *everything* in their power to save her.	To somehow blame the US here is a sick, partisan tactic.

An American love story.		They are now together again.
"I wrote (illegible name) yesterday or the day before and, rather logically, I haven't heard from her but I'm sure she is going to let us come or go etc. I really am excited but scared to death, too. If you hear a big noise up there, don't worry it's just my knees knocking."
"my complete happiness should be to hear of my love for you."		Barbara replies that she is so excited to see Bush that her knees are "knocking."		"Dear Poppy-		I think it was perfectly swell of you to invite me to the dance and I would love to come or go or whatever you say."
"Even now, with a good while between us and the sea, I am thinking of getting back. This may sound melodramatic, but if it does it is only my inadequacy to say what I mean. Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of‚Äî"
"We have been working for a long time with a single purpose in mind, to be so equipped that we meet and defeat our enemy. I do want to go because it is my part. But now having present[ed] itself not as an adventure but as a job, which I hope, will be over before long..."
"For a long time I have anxiously looked forward to the day when we would go abroad and set to sea. It seemed that obtaining that goal would be all I could desire for some time, but, Bar, you have changed all that. I cannot say that I do not want to go‚Äîfor that would be a lie..."
"I love you, precious; with all my heart &amp; to know that you love me means my life. How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you‚Äî So the days go by, the time of our departure draws nearer"
The letters are beautiful.		"My Darling Bar,		This should be a fairly easy letter to write‚Äî words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy I was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement..."
In 2015 I asked the archivist at the George HW Bush library if they had any love letters from HW to Barb. To my surprise, weeks later, I was sent copies of Bush'e original love letters to Barbara after they met at a dance while he was serving as a pilot in the Navy.		(THREAD) https://t.co/3Bynv5I2zo

- Rick Scott filed lawsuits to force Bucher &amp; Snipes to comply with Florida election law.		- A judge ruled in favor of Scott in both cases, ordering the counties to submit their ballots for public review &amp; hand over voter information.		- Neither Bucher nor Snipes had complied
In the 2018 election, Snipes:		1. Opened ballots without canvassing boards approval as required by law	2. Mixed illegal ballots in with legal ones so they can‚Äôt be identified.	3. Oversaw Elections staff filling in blank ballots, according to lawsuit		https://t.co/u8g2P5Kn9g

- The two counties that have refused to follow this law are Democrat stronghold counties of Broward and Palm Beach		- Both of these counties are controlled by Dems 		- Susan Bucher and Brenda Snipes are the Elections Supervisors of these counties. Both are partisan Democrats

I don't care if you like it or not: The fact is that Obama "caged"children and separated them from their parents. 		This is just reality. Here, look at these photos from the Obama era: https://t.co/mReKCEWDmK
Looking through photos of Obama-era detention centers - I was stunned to find images from 2014-2016 that look nearly identical to the ones taken during the Trump era which caused such a rabid political firestorm earlier this year.		I wrote this:		https://t.co/TuznkV7M7B
This means that Obama also "ripped immigrant children from the arms of mothers at the border."		Obama's own DHS secretary, Jeh Johnson, admits this: https://t.co/rjMVvfjILB
Current U.S. immigration laws, when enforced, have the consequence of temporarily separating adults who arrive with children into separate detention facilities in order to prosecute the adults.		The policy was in place when Obama prosecuted half-a-million migrants.
President Obama used the same detention facilities &amp; separation tactics that Trump used. 		The Obama administration prosecuted approximately half a million adults for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border between Fiscal year 2010 and Fiscal year 2016.		https://t.co/Pd8aBlC5QO
Obama just said "there's nothing compassionate about ripping immigrant children from the arms of mothers at the border."		Kind of interesting thing to say since President Obama did just that to hundreds if not thousands of migrant children.		Don't believe me? 		(THREAD) https://t.co/TzGVcUkgyt

10. It is very difficult to argue that Warren did not commit racial fraud. She used the advantages in the system to advance her career with no evidence (to this day) that she is actually Native American. Democrats defending her behavior on this point is dubious - at best.
9. Warren's DNA report did not measure actual Native American DNA. The report actually measured Colombian, Mexican and Peruvian DNA. Of which Warren *may* have a tiny, tiny fraction - possibly. https://t.co/SK7LExbawl
8. Multiple members of Warren's direct family have disputed her claims of a "proud Native American heritage." They deny the Senator's Indian heritage stories fervently:		https://t.co/iF53pWxymP
7. Warren has now claimed that she *may* have 1/1024th Indian DNA. This is equally problematic since DNA science proves that the average white American has .18% Indian DNA, far more that Warren's .098% (lowest estimate according to study) https://t.co/tNwZcdIDeS
6. Warren used offensive, racially charged language to defend her claims of Native American heritage, declaring that her family had ‚Äúhigh cheekbones‚Äù like ‚Äúall the Indians do.‚Äù 		Here is video of that moment: https://t.co/DzU60yowHe
5. Warren submitted multiple recipes for the Indian cookbook ‚ÄúPow Wow Chow‚Äù and signed her name, ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren - Cherokee‚Äù https://t.co/Fr3ECGsUa2
Here is video of Warren telling this story: "My mom and dad were very much in love and they wanted to get married. My father's parents said 'Absolutely not because she's part Cherokee and Delaware.' After fighting it they eloped." https://t.co/3lGCf9xGmY
4. Warren claimed that her mother and father had to elope due to her mom‚Äôs obvious Indian heritage and the white bigotry of her father‚Äôs family. Here is a photo of Warren's mom: https://t.co/B2zSHdNkXL
3. Warren was identified by Harvard Law as a ‚Äúwoman of color.‚Äù Harvard promoted Warren‚Äôs hire as expanding their campus diversity by hiring a woman with "minority background" onto their faculty.
2. After becoming a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Warren demanded the University change her faculty listed ethnicity from ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to ‚ÄúNative American.‚Äù
Every Time Elizabeth Warren Has Lied About Her Native American Heritage:		(Thread)		1. Elizabeth Warren self-identified as a "Native American" in the The Association of American Law Schools Directory of law professors in every edition printed between 1986 -1995.

After all this racial fraud, Warren claims that being 1/1024th Native American somehow exonerates you from years of fake heritage hustling?		I am genuinely confused how Warren thinks this is a win.
Elizabeth Warren committed racial fraud:	- She changed ethnicity from white to ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù at UPenn	- Listed as a "woman of color" at Harvard	- Identified as "racial minority" in American Dir. Law Teachers 	- Signed recipes in an Indian cookbook ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren, Cherokee‚Äù https://t.co/WNcIQVvByk
They know people will just read the headline &amp; not ask questions.	Classic fake news.

Instead of making the overtly racist comment that her grandfather had "high cheekbones - like all the Indians do," Warren should have just said in this interview:		"Guys, I'm 1/512th Native American from 10 generations ago - maybe." 		That would have got 'em. https://t.co/PuTib2jreM
The report says there is a "POSSIBILITY" of her having a fraction of Native American blood. 		It's not even conclusive.

This may be why McConnell &amp; Co. gained such furious indignation about mid-week.		There was a distinctive mood change in the GOP messaging on this. It became much more personal against Dr. Ford, her lawyers &amp; Feinstein.		Perhaps Grassley - or the FBI - found something. 		Wow.
This is a stunning way to end a letter to Dr. Ford‚Äôs attorney. 		Chairman Grassley does not abide bluster &amp; empty threats. Especially against colleagues.		He has something &amp; wants them to know it. 		CALLING OUT Feinstein &amp; Hirono by name is absolutely massive here.
