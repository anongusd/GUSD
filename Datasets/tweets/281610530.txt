Stu's Take: “Clearly, there is a lot riding on the November vote: the future makeup of the #SupremeCourt, our relationship with our biggest trading partner, and yes, impeachment... These elections are perhaps more important than any other midterm in recent memory.” #Kavanaugh https://t.co/mfVoB109Ht
Stu's Take: "How often have we said, open your 401k and smile, well do it again, now. 55 million with a 401k, 30 million with an IRA, and millions more with other pension plans. Check those accounts now. You will have a very good day. Thank you @realDonaldTrump ."	#RecordBullRun https://t.co/GRJ77MoGkJ
Stu's Take:"Technology does indeed concentrate power and wealth, and as a society, we're going to have to come to terms with it. But you don't destroy it. You don't bring it down. Technology is now the base of America's robust economy. We don't want that to change."	#Tech #Amazon https://t.co/0uIDLIc4bR
STU'S TAKE: "The downside here, is the appalling spectacle the Kavanaugh nomination has been turned into and the possibility that the antics of the left will prevent a qualified jurist from sitting on the supreme court."	#BrettKavanaugh #Nomination #ChristineFord https://t.co/9a0PSI01pQ
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser are expected to testify before the senate judiciary committee next week. @KatiePavlich  joined Charles to discuss what could come out of it.	#BrettKavanaugh #ChristineBlaseyFord https://t.co/yCuhZEcWsy

@ReedTimmerAccu @breakingweather @accuweather Hello, may we have your permission to use this footage on our show today? We'd use a proper courtesy, of course. Thank you!
During our show we saw a shirtless man in the streets of Myrtle Beach carrying an American flag during Hurricane Florence. Kristina Partsinevelos got the chance to talk to the man. Take a look.	#HurricaneFlorence #MyrtleBeach #SouthCarolina #HurricaneCoverage https://t.co/k7Uaslt0cx
Stu's Take: "The media will say @realDonaldTrump is incompetent and obviously doesn't care. They will do and say anything that turns a hurricane into votes for democrats .... You want the real story on the storm? You come to us please." #HurricaneFlorence #WashingtonPost https://t.co/G4PNf1ZQrP
Stu's Take: "This million dollar bribe for @SenatorCollins vote is absolutely out of bounds. For the left, the writing is on the wall. They have dictated and dominated our culture for a generation. Well, time's up." #BrettKavanaugh #SusanCollins #bribe https://t.co/ZxHxPu2Q4o
Stu's Take: "At this point, @henrymcmaster of South Carolina, @RoyCooperNC of North Carolina, they've got it right. Florence is coming, and it will be a big one." #HurricaneFlorence #SouthCarolina #NorthCarolina #Virginia https://t.co/nXkcyai6RZ
Stu's Take: "Perhaps some voters want to return to Obama's economy, well @realDonaldTrump had a response for that one to. 4.2% growth, 3.9% unemployment, haven't seen that in 100 years." #Economy #Growth #Unemployment #PresidentTrump https://t.co/jKyVRz0D3F

STU'S TAKE: "I say it's a sad day when a clothing company sticks it to America. A sad day when athletes hurt their own sport, and a sad day when football is contaminated with protest politics. https://t.co/fpPYOiJFhs
Liz Peek, https://t.co/Tj0DdWNV79 Columnist, joined Stuart to tell us how women such as Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez are becoming the new faces of the democratic party and the far left. https://t.co/w1ersBWci0
Confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh began today and Brian Kilmeade was furious over the treatment of the Supreme Court nominee by Democrat senators... https://t.co/cZ6sThVYAA
Stu's Take: "In California and New York, profit is a dirty word even though both desperately need the money that business produces, and they have absolutely no time for Christianity. I ask you honestly, who are the real haters in America today." #Innout #California https://t.co/ok8kMgBmSH
Stu's Take: "All the pundits says the democrats win back the house in November. I'm not so sure about that. Do you really want to pick up the tab for these pie in the sky socialist dreamers?" https://t.co/Q18D5sYbjg
@BlakeBurman on @Varneyco : @realDonaldTrump wants zero tariffs with the #EU across all industries: agriculture, steel, aluminum, and medical equipment were specifically named. #breakingnews #tradetalks #MAGA https://t.co/FcLq5WomVi
Stu's Take: "So when the president says Google search is rigged, and Larry Kudlow says the administration will look into regulation, I agree. I'm a free market guy, but I'm tired of seeing our politics and our culture dominated by liberal billionaires. It's time to rein them in." https://t.co/CxEWrKVjlb
STU'S TAKE: "The economy is growing, the market rallying, there's less red tape, record low unemployment, trade deal discussed on camera, and what does the media feed you? Oh the awkward speaker phone, pathetic." https://t.co/R2YGfenf51
Stu's Take: "Tesla isn't quite up there with the giants just yet, but if Musk gets out of the way, who knows what Tesla could achieve?" https://t.co/8ebccC1TkF
Vivek Wadhwa, Harvard Law School Distinguished Fellow, wrote a piece stating "Dear Elon: Ask Apple or Google to Acquire Tesla". Wadhwa joined us on the show to make his case. https://t.co/VZSol7GMx7
Stu's Take: Will voters accept the impeachment of a president for allegedly paying off two women? Bill Clinton arguably did far worse and he survived. It was the republicans who paid the price when they went through with the impeachment charge. https://t.co/7ei6UtDeng
Stu's Take: For some time our headline has been, political turmoil, the market shrugs it off. Let's hope that shrugging off continues. https://t.co/qVWAztGsBU
Stu's Take: "Who knows what's inside the deep-state conspiracy to protect Hillary and undermine President Trump? The discover process applied to Mr. Brennan would open boxes the left does not want to open." https://t.co/1XHAczsjGC
Stu's Take: "Time's up. This long-running tragedy is almost over. Venezuela with the biggest oil reserves in the world is now a wheelbarrow economy. We should take a hard look at it to make sure we don't go down the pathetic, socialist road." https://t.co/9QGrYUtowt
Stu's Take: "Musk's state of mind-- his personal behavior-- that may be the biggest problem. The New York Times interview concludes that with the stock in turmoil and the company under intense investigation, Musk acknowledges he is 'fraying.' That's not good." https://t.co/0RHE50GWtc
Stu's Take: "Scientific facts don't matter. They don't count. In a San Francisco court room, it's emotion that counts. So here we go again. Monsanto faces 5,000 similar suits... Our sympathy should not be used as an excuse for lawyers trying to pervert our legal system." https://t.co/XpLey80UDB
Stu's Take: "We want to grow our audience and we do by reporting on the issues that directly affect your life...That's what we cover. That's why we are attracting a record number of viewers to this program. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate your discriminating taste." https://t.co/q2EEULj2rA

Stu's Take: Here's my conclusion. Fighting Trump, resisting him, isn't working very well for football or Chicago. Working with him, like Pastor Darrell Scott and his colleagues shows real progress. https://t.co/cYsoiKDiAZ
Stu's Take: "I think a lot of people claim emotional support status for their pets simply to avoid paying for them to fly in the cargo hold. Sure that may be tough on the animal but it's very tough on the flying public." https://t.co/Rm28M02bYa
Stu's Take: "A tweet storm throwing around huge dollar numbers concerning a cutting edge futuristic high tech company is bound to raise a lot of questions about the maturity and yes frankly the stability of its founder.” https://t.co/s8bbPtWgZj

Stu's Take: "Chuck Schumer is the consummate politician and a very intelligent guy... but he has been out-maneuvered...Forget that blue wave in the House. It's the red wave in the Senate that's really going to make the headlines come November." https://t.co/ax5rwIc5rZ

Stu's Take: "This is a new level of harassment. It is hatred raining down on conservatives when they appear in public. To say it's gone too far is a wild understatement. It shouldn't be happening at all!" https://t.co/nuBkfOKrYz
Stu's Take: "The Obama team used the machinery of government to beat up its political opponents. That's not the way this constitutional republic is supposed to operate." https://t.co/xth7SybFOx
Stu's Take: "Let's be clear what's going on here. The left and their media allies are whipping up hysteria. It's based on hate, hatred for our President. It's wrong and it's dangerous. It's a terrible thing for America." https://t.co/uqIkVnQiCJ
