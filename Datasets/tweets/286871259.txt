Strength, healing and much much love to my friend @LukePerryIII.
Listened 2 @POTUS from #Vietnam. 	Sounded pretty good until he said he believed the Dictator didn‚Äôt know what was happening w/ #Otto. 	And then called the tyrant ‚Äúgood.‚Äù	And then said they were friends.	And then acknowledge the gulags, then dismissed them.	#ValuelessLeadership
His statement regarding the hush money payoff &amp; the fraudulent-criminal scheme of hiding it‚Äôs true purpose is worthy of consideration 2 the extent that it may help give an overall picture.

This Republican Party is so far gone, on the wrong side of history that they are utterly trashing their own legacy. Their defense of Trump‚Äôs brazen illegality is grotesque &amp; now they‚Äôve given to posterity, video of their perfidy. #HumiliationGalore https://t.co/c8nUXUDGNh
How would that help to illuminate criminal behavior? https://t.co/3hPqrrvqVv
I don‚Äôt like that some legal pundits shrug it off as an illegal act that won‚Äôt get prosecuted. It was witness intimidation, 	game-set-match.		@maddow I don‚Äôt want people to see you making light of it yet.		You think he should be tried, right? https://t.co/eeTvWamhys
If you watch nothing else tonight:	This is professionalism writ large.	Michael Cohen will have a few years in prison to think about his crimes.

True &amp; False.	Convicted felon &amp; Liar.	But, what he knows (not opinions) may or may not have intrinsic ‚Äúcredit‚Äù or credibility. The Republican Party is blindly pursuing a political tac on this witness &amp; investigation. Not a sunrise. My party behaves this way too. This is bigger. https://t.co/J0spxBDW37
I must amend &amp; clarify. I have profound respect 4 many Republicans I know. Their patriotism &amp; the quality of their minds dwarf (Hobbit?) me.		I‚Äôm simply dismayed at their silence on this issue. 		Cohen is a dumpster-fire. But, condoning criminal intimidation? 	Absolute wrong! https://t.co/XvaiXlEwKL

Republicans have declared &amp; are waging a Cold Civil War.	The @gop is a sweeping &amp; categorical bad. Their agenda 2 discredit Cohen in order 2 protect Trump is a heinous &amp; unpatriotic abdication of their Constitutional oversight responsibility. #NotAboutCohen
You don‚Äôt know that. What other dangers does he face, perhaps unrelated to the concerns of the committee, but could be a threat to his family.

I wasn‚Äôt asserting that Reagan ‚Äúwon the Cold War.‚Äù I was saying  that some do &amp; that history may frame it that way 4 awhile.

@joeytwostops No. 		:-)))
@ConservativChem The Constitution provides for revisions, Trump is just ignoring it. Congress has the power of the purse. This emergency claim circumvents the express will of Congress. There is only a small portion of Republicans in Congress who agree with Trump that it's a legit emergency. #Bad
@InsaneMistress More than that, I think a whole mess of folks in the Maga-American community believe that actual civil war is happening. Dangerous.
@fresh_dookie Republicans are holding dreamers and others hostage. Both sides should be much more direct and open about the issue. Helpful is a strange concept little known all over the place.
@JFoughty3 Respect :-)))
Trump HATES my State of California. HATES us...not those who voted for him or his golf course, just the vast majority of us. Now he wants to steal away money from vital engineering projects here. He HATES us. And the Constitution is about to fail us. Shame. https://t.co/je4TkWkVID
@JFoughty3 As do I. And regarding my point?
@joeytwostops Thousands.
@RAVGallegos Offer a thought then, you unique Maga supporter. I made a point about Mexico calls being a joke. All politicians group people together, they have to...they are supposed to, based on how folks vote. This Maga Mexico rationale was controlling, own it or don‚Äôt.
@felinefine11 I agree. But how it gets paid for was lied about in a spectacular way. That means something.
@JFoughty3 Oh, I think the Maga people are more than happy to be referred to as a collective, when it suits them. Well, at least every one of them ever interviewed...we this and we that as though they own America and I don‚Äôt deserve to live here.
@JFoughty3 Also, my point....the Maga crowd‚Äôs actual feelings during those rally‚Äôs... They laughed after yelling  Mexico. The knew it was absurdist spectacle and were thrilled to play along for entertainment sake. It was raucous political theater at the expense of civility &amp; neighborliness.
@JFoughty3 I disagree. The fundamental operating mode of the MAGA people is to hate us. I don‚Äôt hate back and my rhetoric is not littered with such bile. My characterizing their speech isn‚Äôt hate, it‚Äôs fact. I don‚Äôt like it. If they don‚Äôt like being called out, they should stop it.
No one says this fact, Trump‚Äôs campaign call &amp; response ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going 2 pay 4 the wall? (crowd roars back) Mexico!‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a promise at all, it was a joke. They laughed. MAGA folks couldn‚Äôt care less who pays 4 the wall as long as they can hate on Democrats. #Disingenuous #Fakery

@amccrillis08 @BookCameo Awesome!!!! Give him a hug for me :-)))))
@Ashtopia1 @yoboss000 It‚Äôs an understandable criticism. But, if you look at the thousands of performers on the cameo platform, you may appreciate that this is a paid appearance of sorts. It‚Äôs too expensive for most people, but that‚Äôs ok, there are a lot of other ways to relate to us. It is a $ thing.

@nschornhorst GoFundMe DOES allow the creator 2 keep anything that has been taken in. But, because this was such a long shot, I pledged not 2 keep any money unless we reached our goal or I gave folks a chance 2 opt out of any course corrections. While I would love 2 use the 15k I promised not2
@jerryjamesstone This about carbon captures it
@zclew1s I'm going through a green rough course right now &amp; cultivating relationships with some of the heaviest hitters in the Carbon Capture &amp; Storage world. I will absolutely design an approach that I think we can fund and accomplish post haste. So, I mean it...have no fear!!!
@IvySerpentine NEVER!!!!! WE ALL HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO!!!!!!!
Bummer to report this. Thank you to all 500 people who jumped in to participate. And to the Designers who gave their time and talent. This Urban Canopy Project is just getting started. I consider this a growing pain. Much love to all...Stay tuned!!! https://t.co/55U1eNuVDj
I have many thoughts on this news day. But, I don‚Äôt have the  patience to read the nonsense that would follow were I to share them. This defeated sentiment might be a wake up call to those who‚Äôve followed me. Let it suffice to say, our Nation is serious trouble.

This turned into a pretty great discussion about, volunteerism, artists rights, the amount of work it takes to design web sites, charity, celebrity, college affordability, PR, etc...what got a little lost is the emergency situation we face with climate change. I want 2 re-focus.
@demIN240 Me too. But reading the comments, people were outraged by the idea. One problem with leading a ‚Äúcharity‚Äù effort is over-asking. I think people might not realize the impact of their disgust, but the theme was so strong, I had to step back and apologize.
Well, the idea of a web design competition, where the winning design would be donated 2 the eco-experiment went over like a lead balloon. I apologize 4 offending people. Of course, people‚Äôs work should be valued monitarily. I clearly underestimated what all would be involved.

How many movie titles &amp; characters do you think I could fit on a baseball?	I want to sell like a thousand of them for my charity. No idea what the right price is to ask people for. Suggestions?

@TurkanaDK Been thinking of a slogan...at least 4 the fundraiser. It feels right, but it might come off wrong in print. Since it's just us... I feel like standing in the street with my hat out, holding a sign that reads:		FOLKS, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME		Maybe I should hash tag it:		#ITSNOTABOUTME
@JFoughty3 Thought you'd never ask Jason. I'd say that my zealotry dampened the mood for some. But we've raised over $12,000 by nearly 400 people in 5 days. It's died down too much. Even after I put up, what I thought, were REWARDS people would really want. And, it's hot on this plane.
Awesome...I'm so glad you all chimed in. My zealotry on the environment was starting to alienate some of you. So, it's really hot on this plane...like route 66, put the top down and go on the cars ride again hot https://t.co/urM1W0i07Z

@eumateimufasa_ When I campaign like this, I absolutely flood the zone with TWEETS. I loose some followers who don't want my steady stream of promoting, which is perfectly fair. But a whole mess of my tweets have no likes. With 330k followers &amp; people digging what I'm doing, something is wrong.
@dudeink My whole campaign is predicated on rapid buy in for an environmental experiment...It's all about how quickly we can work together to help the big kids, Governments, Corporations and NGO's though independent low dollar contributions...SPEED is my object...waiting won't do...

@rangerwyld I C what u were getting at. The point of this project is 2B a pilot program-field test, so 2 speak, the ultimate value of which is 2 show people what it looks like-the process &amp; the product &amp; exactly how 2 get it done financially. It's about the planet. LA is not a "requirement"
@kbermond @GlobalCCS_Brad I'd welcome your perspective Kurt @kbermond. Thanks of the offer. Feel free to DM me...
@AGuyInOKC PRIORITY.......ain't that the word....	I keep repeating that I'm learning about countless projects across the spectrum that are underway. I wouldn't want to pull focus from any of them. But, the beauty is, small dollar donations can give fringe or early stage projects a jolt...
@patriot4fr33 in large part...the substance of each campaign finds it's own support audience...but...yeah...folks who have enjoyed my films &amp; tv shows...are incredibly generous and they place a lot of trust in me. #humbling #responsibility #gratitude #fulfilling small dollar donations are huge

@p51dfltln An intriguing obstacle...Because this is a pilot program, we will likely pic a place where one doesn't exist or where they are supportive. But, for the effort to work wide spread...there issues must be addressed...

I've started a new campaign, exploring interest!!!		Urban Canopy Project		Plan: 100 Private Urban Residences, install &amp; maintain for one year, a green space that satisfies the scientific standard of Urban Carbon Capture.		Goal: Establish a scalable model.	https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu
I want 2 assemble an Advisory Board of Carbon Capture Scientists &amp; Issue Experts for my Urban Canopy project. Can you all recommend some great people for this &amp;/or put me in touch with them. Use the hashtag #SeanAstinUrbanCanopy &amp; I'll Follow &amp; DM them. https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu
Why did I launch the Urban Canopy campaign?	1. I'm tired of knuckle heads distracting us.	2. There is an elegance to this idea, bringing a green "feature" into an urban setting, for no money &amp; hassle free. It's a gift to the 100.	3. Leadership by example.	https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu
I'm really excited to learn what kinds of green features will perform the carbon capture function...I'm wondering how much creativity there might be...	https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu https://t.co/cCSCQL6zXi
I set this as a Team Fundraiser. Who wants 2B a Team Leader? Five people 2 play the 5/500 game. Each team races to get 500 people on social media 2 donate $5 each 2 the Urban Canopy campaign. It's a fun "hustle" if u get into the swing of it https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu Interested?
Yep! I have noticed though, that our species operates like a school of fish-a genuine emergency--collective jerk to the left, generosity grows-money flows. I think we should all be willing &amp; eager to throw $5 bucks at a whole host of environmental ideas. https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu https://t.co/R9fdtDCh3S
I'm using the poster incentive to jumpstart the effort. But, it will only work in the end, if people pitch in $5 or whatever on the merits of the idea. Creating an Urban Canopy...how cool is that...I could knock out the autographs in a day-totally worth it https://t.co/I6HerGjpWu
Thought Los Angeles cuz it's where I live. But, if the project goes, we'll find a perfect urban setting(s) 2 achieve the mission: Demonstrate it is possible to implement a program like this on a large scale in a short time that meets scientific standards. https://t.co/S3fmCIh23o https://t.co/nIiopuiTao
It'll take government forever 2 do something like Urban Carbon Capture. If you can't force people 2 participate, perhaps they'd be willing if it was done for them. Could this happen on a massive scale? I don't know, let's try it on 100 Urban Homes &amp; see https://t.co/S3fmCIh23o https://t.co/98Q6O6ksrI
I've added an Autograph Reward. It's steep, but obviously for a good cause and I know I can do 5,000 of 'em... 		Check Out My Newest Campaign: 	Sean Astin Urban Greens -- This is my first stab at environmental activism!!!	https://t.co/xOQvi6i7K2 https://t.co/WFBQbxCGIX
I've started a new campaign, exploring interest!!!		Urban Gardens		Plan: 100 Private Urban Residences, install and maintain for one year, a green space that satisfies the scientific standard of Urban Carbon Capture.		Goal: Establish a scalable model.	https://t.co/xOQvi6i7K2 https://t.co/qcaHYmuPx6
Around the world millions of people are trying to help solve this problem. My effort is one very modest attempt at applying one idea. As with all of these efforts, we will have to rely on scientists. It may work. It may capture the imagination of a dubious public. Let‚Äôs try! https://t.co/3JxNptYJ6N
Ok. File this under money (&amp;time) where my mouth is.	Here is an actual trial ballon to test your interest-GoFundeMe Campaign (I'm good at them), called Sean Astin Urban Greens. *NOTE pay close attention to the $ section, it's designed 2 protect everyone.	https://t.co/xOQvi6i7K2
Does anyone have a photo of their unique urban greenery that I can use to help illustrate the potential merits of "urban carbon capture"???
How cool would it be to see a richly colored coffee table book of those 100 residences using greenery in unique and meaningful ways...in their urban setting...
Ok...how about 100 residences in an urban area...we raise the money...form the non-profit...do the due diligence and find/install and maintain green spaces for one year. Would you donate $25 bucks to fund that pilot program???
I disagree with your use of the word "but" in that sentence...but your substantive thinking on this stuff seems totally relevant... https://t.co/roi4ajar29
...and now for some fresh reminders from the front... https://t.co/hBH7S1p56p
Just to make sure we're on the same page...the priority with this hypothetical carbon capture adventure, would be to focus on urban areas...	Man, I wish there were millions of dollars dedicated to this kind of thing...I would totally get a non-profit &amp; a lobbying wing set up... https://t.co/klCrI7s3IK
How much would you personally donate or commit to raise, for a non-profit that sought to offer strategic greening (plants/grass etc) to private individuals or if feasible on a massive scale w/ Public buildings? Meaning...GIVING &amp; Maintaining Greenery citywide.
Crazy cool...I would love to go to a convention of these kinds of ideas/inventions...I bet there are tons... https://t.co/fTzzsXdnnx
Stuff like this stalls all the time because of the kind of practical doubt in your optimism...but...it can't be wrong to gear up a myriad of efforts...when disasters are obvious and the needs are clear...people step up...this kind of thing could be actionable on many levels... https://t.co/HIf8sLpS48
AWESOME!!!!!!		Looks pretty helpful/harmless...		Now we need that...green roof lobby funded a.s.a.p. https://t.co/u1kzmgz7d7
@216_Born that's factored in to my modest 100 million dollar gofundme goal
I don't think big companies would care if 20 million people in LA decided 2 try out their green thumbs. I bet it'd be good for lots of businesses.		Raise your hand, If I offered 2 come 2 ur house personally (or a clone of me) to set up some greenery and help you maintain it??? https://t.co/e6SibnToE3
I'm just sitting on this flight doing the math on a napkin...How much money would a non-profit have to raise, to offer "free" greenery to private owners...and /or work with public spaces in big enough numbers to matter? For a big city like LA, I'm thinking like a hundred million.
so....I'm not sure petitions and marches are enough to get things done...it seems like contributions to politicians and big lobbying firms move the needle...is greening up the place a "special interest" - Where is the money gonna come from...GoFundMe? Not kidding. Who wants it?
separately...most public schools in America have chain link fences &amp; a lot of asphalt...I wonder what it would take to green those areas up...plus, the kids wouldn't all be going to schools surrounded by chain link fences and a lot of asphalt. https://t.co/9x3jgtohtw
we could clump the equivalent amount of trees equaling one per space... around the perimeter or in a separate area...so birds don't crap on cars...but...LOVE IT...	not sure what to do about underground garages, except make the whole top area green... https://t.co/9x3jgtohtw
Someone mentioned to me that putting a certain amount of greenery on top of houses and buildings around the world would be a great way to do "carbon capture" -- We could do this..Governments could subsidize this...pronto...would it make a difference??? https://t.co/AFvIcINjK7
Can anyone make an emoji for #ClimateKnuckleHead	Then we can just stamp it as a response to their dreck and be constructive with our comments...

Democracy. Whew.
@JT_Antonini Iocane powder...I've developed a tolerance...	also...we are men of action...
@JT_Antonini We are at an impasse. I am all for fairness. Kentucky is a fantastic place and deserves to be represented fairly. Just for giggles, what would happen if CA had 1 more Senator and Puerto Rico had one. So, 52 Senators total. Does that just completely undermine the whole thing?
@UnleadedPetro The Constitution. Pretty fantastic document. One shouldn't disregard it's provisions which allow it to be amended or adjusted. In a civilized world, we should celebrate such a thing. Trump is a celebrity, your argument is not good.
@Baloobear76 Ken Burns baby....But the founding...yes!
@JT_Antonini You don't know me. You don't know my history. You don't know my political philosophy or ideology. You, mr. small state guy, are ignoring my point about the Constitution. We are talking about it tonight for obvious reasons. My thought is valid. Your dismissal is bullying.
@JT_Antonini Not complicated. It's simple. It's just not fair. I haven't proposed any specific remedy. I don't know what one would be yet. I'm just saying, we should start thinking about how to use the document the way it was intended, namely to be responsive. Now, that's not so complicated.
@JT_Antonini Mockery is the defense of the...i don't know...you...	If you have nothing else to say about this...yes....staggering disparity...I'll move along...		WY: 573,000	ND: 755,000	SD: 869,000	ID: 1,717,000	NE: 1,930,000		CA: 39,780,000
@Baloobear76 Not really. The sweep of our National life is compelling...I'm not that hot on the 1820-1840 period...but, maybe I'm just lazy...The Civil War and the turn of the 20th Century grab. WWII &amp; Viet Nam have always gripped me. Not that the lease of war is the only way to get at it all
@JT_Antonini Ever read the Norton Anthology of American Literature? Covers a lot of ground. Also, the thing about a lifetime of learning and experience. If you continue to be rude, I'll disengage from our wee chat.
@CRC1082 just for faux football...loved every second of it
@JT_Antonini A lot of it was. But, as an undergrad, I did not choose an area specialty. Also, I have also lived in this country for 47 years. I was simply drawing attention to a certain credential.
@JT_Antonini The number is staggering &amp; restating the cold mechanics of the 200+ year old system in a vacuum doesn't speak 2 the issue. I've sworn an oath to our Constitution twice. I remain devoted. The instrument proscribes how to address such an imbalance. Convention. No idea how to do it.

George, I HATE that the truth of your post won't get the coverage that it should.

Well, @CNN &amp; @MSNBC did pretty well tonight. After scanning, I learned a lot without feeling like the news directors were shoving a premature story down my throat. They both said, many times, that the massive early voter turnout was not predictive of high voter turnout tomorrow.

I am a proud Democrat. But, only a fool would fail to recognize that the system is broken. 		3rd party campaigns are worthy &amp; deserve respect.		But, this Tuesday night is an absurd time to make what amounts to a conscience driven protest vote. It is a willful non-choice. https://t.co/esR8pb3lou
I completely agree. Now, as for the stone cold truth of my statement...what will you do? https://t.co/dTyZtbFpdi
It will happen when you and your friends work hard over years to make your 3rd party viable. Earn backing from big donors. Find compelling candidates. Get great lawyers. Do the work.		But, don‚Äôt punish everyone, because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet.		Live in the reality of this moment. https://t.co/LJiiu9y9Wh
@BartlettKellogg Do you think what I said is wrong? Do you think another party will win control of the House on Tuesday night?		I believe in your right to write yourself in on the ballot. But, your protest vote will not have helped give Democrats the power to check &amp; balance Trump.
The arrogance &amp; folly of 3rd party voting on this particular Tuesday.		It is time 4 a change. The 2 Major Parties are damaged in a broken system.		But, on Tuesday Night, either The Democrats or The Republicans will control the House.		Get that. Please God. Get that.		It‚Äôs true.
Millions of Non-Voters	(registered but don‚Äôt) say		There is no-one I can put my faith in-get behind. I‚Äôm just not inspired.		Well, how would you feel if someone said that about You? About We the People?		It is on us now. We the Voters, 2 inspire them! 2 lead them!!!		#Vote #Lead

It was my first 2see if that sort of Statewide list would get a response for the Candidates. It wasn't the most successful of my tactics so far. And, you are right...it is political...when it comes to influencing the Government piece of the #Climate puzzle...that's the thing 2 do https://t.co/p14OdsawkO

Betsy, thank you for answering my question. It‚Äôs clear from reading your position that you would be a smart, strong leader on the environment &amp; energy.

To my fellow @sagaftra colleagues, 		I‚Äôm working my twitter account really hard in these final days leading up to the mid-term election.		If you are interested in hearing my strategy, I‚Äôll DM you with the time of a conference call I‚Äôm hosting.		Happy Campaigning!!!		Yours,	Sean
Thank you so much Jeannine for giving such a thorough response to my #Climate question. 		Let me know if I can help with your campaign! Indiana is my adopted or ‚ÄúIn-Law‚Äù State and I really care about its future. 		Good Luck in the #IN06 https://t.co/2hcDQxMGCP
I wonder if constituents ask about @HouseDemocrats Committee Assignments. Fellow marathon runner @SeanCasten could contribute to so many different ones.		I just looked up the map of #IL06.	The puzzle shape of the District boundaries is hard to describe.		https://t.co/aMiOsbL4Yg
@JulieBrethauer @DrZ4Congress @VoteCasten Thanks Julie. Are you living in the District? Wish I could be in lots of places at once. I‚Äôd love to go to a town hall in #IL06 and watch @SeanCasten live. A debate would be even more fun to watch. I‚Äôm fascinated by how @HouseDemocrats talk to constituents about #Climate.
Hey @Kevinstart3,		What a great positive statement of support 4  @SeanCasten 		Making themselves available 2 voters is the least folks in  #IL06 &amp; every District should expect from their Candidates.		Thanks 4 letting folks know that I'm following your local Campaign!		Yours,	Sean https://t.co/mKqrJZljXN
@AmesCW @DrZ4Congress Amy, 		Thank you!		Help us/me tweet with @DrZ4Congress supporters. I want to help amplify their voices. Just tweet/invite them to comment or ask me questions. Tag me. I'll retweet my responses to them. Be creative finding voters in #FL01 who might be curious about my thoughts.
I'd genuinely appreciate the opportunity to call in Wed  with @DrZ4Congress to talk environment &amp; energy  ideas. Sports metaphors should abound.	#FL01 voters have a lot 2 consider. #Climate is my #1 issue, eager 2 learn &amp; share why. https://t.co/WbXNntZ8iE
I had a great Twitter exchange with @VoteCasten 	&amp; was struck with his intellect &amp; laser focus. His approach to #Climate policy is aggressive!!!		I'd love to hear directly from his supporters in the #IL06 2 help amplify their enthusiasm. https://t.co/32cC9F7vvI
@DrZ4Congress Ugh. Q: Are Florida's @HouseDemocrats Candidates able to help each other? I genuinely don't know how it works within the State. Earlier today I tweeted the #FL group w/ handles. I'm sure fundraising is competitive. #themorevotersknow they might pitch in/volunteer/tweet etc...
I really wish I could sit in the back of this Tidal Town Hall. The fact that Candidate Jennifer Zimmerman @DrZ4Congress has prioritized this issue, in the last few days of her campaign, is a great great thing!!! https://t.co/HVMrJRsnEV
@StorieGrubb @gazelle510 @UNFCCC I'm trying to be positive &amp; keep the issue of #Climate policy on the minds of my followers &amp; theirs leading up 2 the election. Voters have a lot 2 consider, I'm hoping 2 keep the environment fresh in their consideration. Please ask the @HouseDemocrats in your district 2 tweet me.
@JazzyFlame @UNFCCC It's really important to try and understand how the system works. The reach of the U.S. Government is impossible to overstate. Single issue voting has been pretty corrosive in our politics, but it's been effective. Voters have so much to consider. I'm striking a cord for #Climate
It‚Äôs a Non-Partisan issue. But, the way Congress works, the Majority Party controls what legislation gets to the floor. Single issue voting has been used by Republicans for decades. I think #Climate is worth it. But, you‚Äôre right, elections do affect all issues. This is MY focus. https://t.co/MVhndQNft1
There are some many thoughts about how hard it is to get together to figure out a way forward. Our Government has massive reach. We see how hard it is for leaders to get together.		This #Climate #P4gsummit ‚Äúprivate/public‚Äù partnership mtg. seems cool. Keeping my eyes on it. https://t.co/z1V6ZBJk9q
If you follow my feed, you see I‚Äôm pushing 2 highlight the recent @UNFCCC report which presents an alarming view of #ClimateChange.		As voter &amp; citizen, it‚Äôs my #1 priority this mid-term election.		2 help, If you live in Florida, pls rt my question 2 the Candidate in ur District.
In politics, there are many ways 2 pursuade. Anger, fear &amp; hate are potent weapons. Some perfect the art of ‚Äúinspirational leadership.‚Äù 		Depending on the occasion or the moment, some leaders switch tactics. Getting ‚Äúrough‚Äù can work. 		Do the ends justify the means?	Who‚Äôs 2 say?
Voting in America isn‚Äôt compulsory. We‚Äôre free 2 not vote. I think it‚Äôs a shame that many citizens ignore or choose not 2 participate &amp; posted an angry tweet at my followers saying so. Roll Call &amp; Breitbart ran it. The response was mostly vile &amp; toxic. So, I‚Äôve deleted it. Onward

When it comes 2 the #Climate  conversation, I observe that the words FAITH, BELIEVE, SCIENCE &amp; even SCIENTIST have been weaponized, abused, misused &amp; depleted. 		Perhaps they should be reserved, relative 2 #Climate policy, until the actual meanings are more commonly understood. https://t.co/vHtuGFZYJ3

This article is why I'm making #ClimateChange MY #1 priority. It's a "wedge issue" so not a loud campaign subject. I believe that constituents today &amp; Legislators in January must be bold. The dissenting opinion is best served big. Leadership by example!!!	https://t.co/wBAea3rhfh
@ToyBinky @SeanCasten Ya got me. Who are they? And are they "top" because of a title within a committee or as designated by their peers? It's a great question. Athletes have trading cards. Maybe these scientists should too. I'd love to read their stats.
Many folks who reject the @UNFCCC scientific report  believe that it is a sort of socialism trojan horse that is meant to undermine American primacy. While I disagree, I think it's in the best interest of the planet to speak directly to this view. Visualizing the future is tricky
1st, love yer name. 2nd, two  of the many many things I‚Äôve learned about the Climate discussion these past few days of zealous advocacy, I have a very muchly lot 2 learn and people, groups &amp; companies all over the world have been hard at work developing/implementing great stuff! https://t.co/jdODRgtOkK

@praeriedikter @kerri_dayton @MatthewModine They are already being eliminated. As food. Managing animal populations is the new normal for  us all in this new anthropocene.

Thank you so much @kerri_dayton!!!		You keep posting relevant articles and information in direct response to the most interesting #Climate comments on my thread. I really appreciate it. 		@praeriedikter @MatthewModine https://t.co/KcuUpM48ht
@praeriedikter @MatthewModine How is that such an offense? Both industries have been identified by experts as damaging in some ways to the environment. I'm wondering aloud. I respect ranchers &amp; miners. This gets to the managing the "climate economy" discussion that seems inevitable.
@RivMoreira @MatthewModine I was doing the Find Your Carbon Footprint thing, and was intrigued by how it measured changes in moderation...car, home heating etc...and wondered the same thing about meat consumption...I like that you are looking for solutions...
Adam, Thank you so much for tweeting me directly. Your unequivocal statement about #climatechange is powerful. At the moment, managing the "Climate Economy" seems like an impossible mission. I hope &amp; pray that you win. I would love to see @RepAdamSchiff Chairing Committees!!! https://t.co/PBQYT8ZaRA
My friend @MatthewModine, Your decades of work in this area are impressive. Beyond one's moral/philosophical approach 2 Vegetarian/Vegan lifestyles, many are defensive on economic grounds. Feels like the beef industry is similar to the coal industry. Any book recommendations? s. https://t.co/Nq1K2yftoV
@MichaelEMann @DrZ4Congress Professor Mann, Your name kept coming up on "top #climatechange recommendations on twitter" lists. You've written several books...what should I start with??? 	@MichaelEMann
@DanFosterType Now THIS is the way 2 put me in my place. My snark did get gobs of attention, but the truth is that rebuking people isn't the best way lead. Voter apathy &amp; civic indifference are a thing. But, I stand/tweet corrected. Now, go @DanFosterType &amp; sail away with One-Eyed Willy.
Dr. Zimmerman,		I just scrolled through your twitter feed @DrZ4Congress, looked at your website &amp; watched 2 videos.

Thank you so much 4 taking a moment 2 share your passion about the #Climatecrisis!!!		I‚Äôve been reviewing the @EPA twitter feed &amp; I‚Äôm very concerned about what isn‚Äôt happening. 		Do you have a link 2 a speech, bill or position paper 2 help my audience learn more about your plan? https://t.co/OL1lUW8LUX

@SturmB @AmyMcGrathKY I'm hoping to get a direct tweet from @AmyMcGrathKY sharing a thought with me about her approach to the #ClimateCrisis
Dear @HouseDemocrats,		The #ClimateCrisis is my #1 issue. Many of our Candidates have tweeted me a thought on their approach 2 environmental policy. I'm committed to highlighting this problem down the stretch. 		Will you offer some guidance here?		Yours,	Sean
Dear @RepTedDeutch, 		As I study @HouseDemocrats in the final days before the election, I'm asking Candidates to share with me a thought about environmental policy. 		The #ClimateCrisis is my #1 issue. 		Would you please offer some insight as to your approach?		Yours,	Sean
Hello @TalleySergent,		The #ClimateCrisis is my #1 issue. Would you please share a thought with me about your approach to environmental policy?  		Thank you!		Yours,	Sean https://t.co/GhrBTchbjn
I would love to have @timkaine &amp; @flacc4congress tweet a thought about their approach to the #ClimateCrisis. So far, 12 @HouseDemocrats have shared their views directly. It's made the conversation with my twitter peeps really come alive!!! https://t.co/OjknPiyMNg
I am all ears 2 hear from Republicans!!! You are absolutely right, #ClimateCrisis is a Non-Partisan issue. The reason I‚Äôm focusing on @HouseDemocrats is because Dems clearly prioritize the issue &amp; the party that controls Congress moves legislation. But, their thoughts are welcome https://t.co/6mdNxv18R3
@s_man76a @BetoORourke @UNFCCC @HouseDemocrats Environment is a vital piece of the health care puzzle. If scientists are anywhere close to accurate, the impact on human health will be more catastrophic as time zips by.		All voters must weigh all of the issues that affect them. 		This is simply where I'm putting my attention.
@CrusaderColleen @HouseDemocrats I've been to town halls with the "peons" you describe. One vote. One twitter feed. One volunteer hour. One phone call or door knock. I really appreciate that a bunch of @HouseDemocrats have taken a moment to speak to my issue. Maybe folks would speak directly to you too. Try.
@joshua33 @tedlieu I've thought about this dynamic. I want to put together a "prioritized" or helpful reading list, books, reports, articles...maybe even documentaries... We hire reps to do the heavy mental lifting and to sift through science, politics, economics...and make good choices &amp; lead...
@justrelaxfornow @BetoORourke @UNFCCC @HouseDemocrats This is a non-partisan, national security issue...according to the Pentagon. My emphasis on the @HouseDemocrats is mostly because this/my party is clearly prioritizing the #ClimateCrises. The party in power, moves the legislation. So, flipping the house is job 1 for my #1 issue.
Dear @BetoORourke,		My #1 issue is the #ClimateCrisis. Would you please share with me here a thought about your approach 2 the environment. The @UNFCCC report unnerved my fam a bit. 		I'm using my social media platform 2 share @HouseDemocrats views on the subject.		Yours,	Sean
As I scan my timeline, looking for #Climate stories, I see this. I doubt that there are political or nefarious motives behind the telling of this story. I don't know if it is a direct/indirect or no consequence...but the #ClimateEconomy certainly has to take up stuff like this. https://t.co/hvcOP7SVfB
I don't vouch for the authenticity or voracity of this site or this post. But, it sure strikes me as one of many many many dynamics to consider in the #Climate discussion. https://t.co/pmq7xNgT8v
Go @Dodgers!!! I was working &amp; watching the game. All 5 1/2 hours of it. All 13 nail biting innings of it. I have more grey hair now than I did when it started.

When I watch Election returns on November 6th, I'm going 2 focus on the @HouseDemocrats who took the time 2 communicate with me here on twitter. I appreciate that they've spoken to my #1 issue, the #ClimateCrisis. Participating in the campaign process makes me feel really good.
Everyone following me on twitter knows that I've chosen to highlight the #ClimateCrisis down the stretch of this mid-term election. I would ask @VP to please address the conclusions that the @UNFCCC scientists reported last week. His answer here was in no way reassuring. https://t.co/V2NW2PMfLR
@niecy1102 @tedlieu I'd love to tweet about the rep in your district who is fighting for the environment. I'm hoping they'll tweet me directly with a thought about their approach!!!
Hey @RepAdamSchiff I've had great responses from @HouseDemocrats Candidates tweeting me directly with a thoughts regarding the #ClimateCrises. My family &amp; I were alarmed by the @UNFCCC. Would you do that as well? I know &amp; endorse your position, my goal is 2 share w/my audience!!!
Hello @BradSherman ,	I'm 1 of ur constituents #CA30 (&amp;#CA33 weirdly). I've chosen 2use my social media platform 2highlight the #ClimateCrisis down the stretch. Several @HouseDemocrats Candidates have personally tweeted me about their approach 2 climate. Would you? Thank You! sean

Is there a link that I can share with my twitter audience that lays out your approach to the #ClimateCrisis. The @UNFCCC really frightened my fam. https://t.co/csKP0lxRMb
Hello @tedlieu,	I'm 1 of ur constituents #CA33 (&amp;#CA30 weirdly). I've chosen 2use my social media platform 2 highlight the #ClimateCrisis down the stretch. Several @HouseDemocrats Candidates have personally tweeted me about their approach to climate. Would you? Thank You! sean
@mitch_anable @Alyssa_Milano @HouseDemocrats I have no idea if this would work, but since this is my personal twitter feed, I absolutely love it when people put creative ideas out there. It fires up the imagination. And...who knows...I'm gonna mention it to my wife tomorrow...
@shawnstewartKC @UNFCCC @sharicedavids ...well, I suppose one of us has a lot to learn. I hope you study the energy and environment platforms of whichever candidates are competing for your vote.		Thanks for the compliment!!!
Josef, (2b read when you wake up &amp; have time during your day)	Your Profile page includes this sentence, "just an idealist who thinks we can all get along." SO, I think maybe you aren't just a troll, but have a curious sense of humor. FYI--Over 39 million humans in #California https://t.co/lZC36gmSyi
I wish you much Good Luck on the race. It's obvious @JosephKopser that you are working incredibly hard to earn every vote. I will be watching very closely!!!		Thank you for this additional information about your Climate &amp; Energy policies. I'll study the link tonight. https://t.co/WiIOM42SpW
Thnx so much for sharing your climate views directly with me Sharice. I don't know anything about the #KS3 District, but I'm reassured that voters where you live have a candidate speaking to the issue. The Pentagon sees the @UNFCCC as a National Security threat. @sharicedavids https://t.co/E2r3A5sCBn
Thanks Dustin. I know that it's not for anyone living outside of anyone else's Congressional District to "tell" them how to vote or exert hidden influence. My politics and those of my District may vastly differ. But, this is a NATIONAL SECURITY issue and should be factored in.
@JosefMirna Josef,		Welcome to MY feed. I'd like to highlight your comments here as an example of the kind that generally prompt me to block a user, again from MY feed. The climate issue is valid &amp; I have chosen to invest my time &amp; social media capital on it.		Oh, #California rocks!
LTC @JosephKopser I just watched ur debate. You did a solid job of representing a world view that makes a lot of sense 2me. I was disappointed that there were no questions about the @UNFCCC climate report. I hope that the people of #TX21 also consider your position on this issue.
Yo Joey,		I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmass block‚Äù people. I did  blocked a lot of individuals. There‚Äôs no call 4 viciousness &amp; hate. If I see it on my feed, I block it.		You‚Äôll still find tons of disagreement &amp; jokes at my expense. But, there‚Äôs a line.		I do unblock people too, when asked nicely. https://t.co/IwFVb3hg5t
@ngalloway13 @Alyssa_Milano @HouseDemocrats I did think about this. It‚Äôs a hill worth dying on...get the Congressional metaphor?? 		If Candidates don‚Äôt believe in the cause they shouldn‚Äôt say they do. If they do believe, they should fight for it. 		Honesty between politicians &amp; the public is the only real way forward.
@KTBthe3rd @UNFCCC Vote for people who are committed to protecting the planet!
@skippyswife99 @ReneeHoagenson @sharicedavids I‚Äôm hoping @sharicedavids gives me a shout out &amp; shares her passion for dealing with the #ClimateCrisis
Hey Cort aka @cortvo 		Thank you so much 4 tweeting me with such a strong statement of support 4 #ClimateAction 		I‚Äôm excited 2 let my followers know that you are running hard in #MO-2 ‚Äî That‚Äôs Missouri right? This is a National (Global) issue, but I‚Äôm learning names &amp; places!!! https://t.co/VVvtkEuVdm
Looks like you all are seriously committed to finding solutions. I look forward to learning more!!! https://t.co/ISm4MFLYad
I‚Äôd love to get a tweet from Cort @cortvo sharing a thought about his approach to the #ClimateCrisis https://t.co/Xs6qNDSZHL

Hey @Alyssa_Milano,		I‚Äôve chosen the #ClimateCrises as my #1 ‚Äúissue‚Äù for the mid-terms.		Any @HouseDemocrats who want me 2 promote their campaigns with a retweet, should tag me in a  tweet with a comment about their approach 2 the environment.		I‚Äôm loving these conversations!!!
Over the past 25 years, since the film #Rudy premiered, it has found a place on movie lists. This one is too generous. On behalf of the filmmakers and dreamers &amp; doers everywhere, Thnx @USATODAY!!!		https://t.co/U9gYFtq8GW
@Tgdraw Well, for one thing, we lead every nation but like 1 or 2 into the most sweeping international climate agreement ever...a nice way of declaring intentions at least
Again @HouseDemocrats Candidates, I want 2promote campaigns with a retweet if u tweet me directly sharing a thought about your positive plans to help the environment. What you've done or want to do etc... 	At the moment I have over 330,000 followers #ClimateCrisis is my #1 issue.
Let us not be alarmists. Let us not panic. 		Alarmist (n) Someone considered 2b exaggerating a danger &amp; so causing needless worry or panic. 		Panic (n) Sudden uncontrollable fear or anxiety, often causing wildly unthinking behavior.		#ClimateCrisis requires calm determined action
@Knightkore I agree. Firetrucks have sirens for a reason.
Thanks so much! I've been promoting Candidates here on twitter who tweet at me with a thought about their approach to the #ClimateCrisis. So far, 6 @HouseDemocrats have taken me up on the offer!!! I hope I hear from your Candidate @LUnderwood630 in the #IL14 :-))) https://t.co/wcCfNfi01Y
If TV News embraced the #ClimateCrisis as the NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT EMERGENCY we are told it is from the Pentagon, maybe they'd increase coverage. "The media" (in general) is derelict in not reporting on this with much greater urgency. And, it is a terribly complex subject. https://t.co/Q3iXxGoF4N
Thank you so much Mr. Secretary. Your words of encouragement mean so much. @JohnKerry, your leadership on this issue has been an inspiration to me and millions of others around the planet. I see the #ClimateCrisis as THE whopper of an opportunity for the world to work together!!! https://t.co/SJpWZkjqEw
Regarding the @UNFCCC environment report , it's all hands on deck. This mid-term Congressional election is a major test of political will. I'm twitter engaging w/ many Candidates. While their oath is 2 the constituents of their District, it is a National issue. #VitalConversation
We both have 3 daughters!!!!!!	Thank you for the good words. 	&amp; I saw the demagorgons, but the stupid script said, "Bob stops running." 	But, I appreciate an Army vet having my back :-))) https://t.co/nsw3bRPofT
Most comments here r negative-blocked many. While they missed the mark &amp; proved my point (1,400 likes, 212 rt's &amp; 544 comments) responding 2 my snark tweet-people prefer controversy over conversation- chiding, mocking &amp; disdain taught me a lot. Follow my feed if ur curious how ü§†
I hope we meet at some point. Thank u 4 your service &amp; 4 taking my musings on faith &amp; the environment in the spirit I hoped u would.

So, u are an actual Rocket Scientist...just letting that sink in...	Thank u so much 4 sending me information about who u are &amp; sharing your commitment 2 clean energy. Your approach to the #ClimateCrisis seems extreme in its practicality. I'm so excited 2 introduce u 2 my feed (1) https://t.co/q0V5XygZqs
Such a strange sensation. The wind is howling in a beautiful way. But, in an instant it can become a deadly wave of fire. This has been my experience in Los Angeles for nearly 50 years. Now, it‚Äôs just...more... https://t.co/mFhcogSPsQ
@KerryCranberry @TheDemocrats @Kopser4Congress I hope I hear from him!!!		In a tweet I wrote but did not send, I mused that science was a gift from God. It‚Äôs probably best to separate the two, but I‚Äôm trying to find a way for Religion to get more on board with the sanctity of being good stewards of the natural world.
Approval Rating for #Congress: 19%	Man, people hate Congress. But, I've been watching these campaigns and I see hundreds of Candidates, thousands of staff &amp; countless supporters working their hearts out. Let's acknowledge that work. Cynicism aside 4 a sec.	https://t.co/rcOmkHqbQd
So far, 4 @HouseDemocrats Candidates have answered my invitation 2 promote their climate plans. While this tweet is from your official account, it seems you are well served by your supporters and staff (also women-on my feed). Your passion &amp; approach @LinseyFaganTX are fantastic! https://t.co/bkrZ7pSVek
Thank you @JulieForTX25 for getting back to me so quickly and sharing your vision for how government can help work on the #ClimateCrisis. I'm eager to pass your plan on to my followers!!! Good luck in the #TX25. https://t.co/PV0AILwceN
Hey @jessforcongress, Thank you so much for replying to my call for all @HouseDemocrats to share their Environmental approach. Your principled approach to this issue is admirable and I'm proud to pass your platform along to my followers and beyond. Good Luck to you in the #PA11. https://t.co/SqXNZPeJ9o
@kingxerocole @HouseDemocrats I think we have 2 manage a radical approach to a climate economy....I don't know what that means in practical terms-first we have to make the conversation positive so people can debate things rationally-was moved by @UNFCCC assertion that no government has done this kind of thing

@867539 @HouseDemocrats I am watching the @Dodger game!!! #GoBlue
Hey @HouseDemocrats, my Number 1 issue is the #ClimateCrisis. If any of our Candidates wish for me to promote their campaigns with a Retweet, have them tweet at me with a helpful comment about their position. What have they done? What will they do? What can we do to help?
I'm really enjoying interacting with, so far, exclusively @TheDemocrats Candidates, as they share their approaches to protecting the economy. Whoever the pro #ClimateAction Candidate is in your district, let them know I'm eager to promote their campaigns. National/Local Issue.
@ANihilisticles @UNFCCC sorry...all better now
@ButtercupPB @authorjhudson @UNFCCC Something. Hard working, dignified people shouldn't be made to suffer for generations of contributing to the life and growth of the Nation. Their situation is about to become like disaster victims. The nation should bail them out and set them up in other industries.
Well, this is just as terrifying as the @UNFCCC report, but it is easier to read. 	The kid from Growing Pains turns out to be one of the most important heroes of the 21st century. Thank you Leo. https://t.co/ULeULhCGty

@chrisphxaz42 never blacked out, but full question was did he ever drink enough such that he couldn't remember parts or all of anything that transpired. He let "no black out" &amp; "Neither do I" (have a drinking problem) stand. That is not the "WHOLE TRUTH" His inebriation history reveals evasion
@chrisphxaz42 &amp; the prevarication-obfuscation-lie-fudge, goes 2the heart of a he said/she said accusation/defense. In this me2 era, a Supreme Court justice should not waffle away from the issue. He "could" have been too drunk to remember, if not, his answer should be insightful, not evasive.
@chrisphxaz42 NEVER DRANK TO THE POINT OF BLACKING OUT. That categorical denial is challenged by so many pieces of evidence, including by his own writing and it's simply not credible. This mischaracterization seeks to deflect from Ford's accusation. True or not, his answers disqualify him. &amp;TY

@Rick_Barkley42 @NRA @CPAC @amazon Their speeches at @CPAC were a National Disgrace. Corporate America agrees.

@erinvalynn @Rachel_NoelW @ellyay @BisonOnline @NRA @CPAC @amazon I agree that they were not disciplined and that it undermined their message. I said as much about Cameron's one one comment. My support for the student movement is undiminished. I just hope they stay positive.
@BisonOnline @ellyay @NRA @CPAC @amazon Anyone yelling that should b ashamed of themselves. They sound just like the a-holes yelling "lock her up"  I didn't see any coverage of those taunts, but I'll take her at her word. That said, Two wrongs don't make a right.

@FloBunz @NRA @CPAC @amazon It's probably a good idea to make rational appeals to people who may not already agree with you. There isn't a snowball's chance in Hell they apologize for anything.

@cook63 @NRA @CPAC Kim, gun manufacturing companies are very profitable. They fund the NRA. Membership fees are only a portion of their budget. The NRA is paid to lobby Congress and tons of others to keep the commerce lines open. Clearly, they are sowing discord and inciting hate as a distraction.
@Heyberto @NRA @CPAC Right? I've been trying to calm myself all day. But, they have so much power and based on todays speeches, so little conscience that I physically shudder to think about how we'll achieve a peaceful society...which, by the way...is a worthy objective.
@RFSwitchArt @NRA @CPAC The @NRA speeches today would be a compelling exhibit. I keep telling myself that the gun owners, the members aren't being properly represented.
@CanOpal @NRA @CPAC See, that's not fair. Gun owners individually are pretty reasonable. This organization uses the most sophisticated psychological tactics to warp the conversation and pit people against each other. Their charter should be examined. They aren't operating in good faith.
@DutcherGlen @NRA @CPAC The @NRA put them forward to speak at this National Conference the day after a massive shift in the gun conversation. That they would speak this way is terrifying. It's a defensive, unvarnished airing of some pretty awful attitudes. Gun Owners deserve better representation.
The @NRA absolutely ruined my day. I watched their speeches @CPAC and I have been incredibly upset ever since. #WayneLaPierre &amp; Spokeswoman  Dana Loesch were disgusting. The organization should be ashamed. If I was a member, I would quit. They don't deserve a seat at the table.
@stempert s'all good...this issue is massive and I think gun owners deserve leadership that actually reflects their values instead of what I watched today...		big hug!
@stempert I'm pretty sure we could be friends.
@stempert I like this back and forth...generally using YOU in an argument is an ass thing to do but, for fun....		You are the elitist...you sit on your farm and think laws should be written for just yourself and your friends... don't dilute the argument		(ps I love farms with guns)
@Ty_TrueReview Aw. I'd like to thank the academy!!!!
@stempert stupid ass...I don't have armed body guards...well, certain events provide armed security...that's a good thing...I'm grateful...schools should also have armed guards...like museums and many other civil venues...but yer a jerk for saying that...I almost blocked ya :-)))
@MAFAtlanta He said 'elites' and I think he meant me...I twittered up
@StuffJudeSays I did.
@ARoomWithAPoo The profit motive of gun manufacturers is an important topic.
The Executive Director of the NRA, Wayne Lapierre spoke today. Watch for yourself. It is vile. You can't speak truths, then wrap them in toxic hatred and expect to be taken seriously. 2A will outlive this awful organization that can't dissolve soon enough.	https://t.co/O1yqS7oyEM

@erinvalynn Erin, yes...God Bless him and us all...	We are all trying...and that's a good...
@erinvalynn Eric, you are insane if you don't think he meant me. The guy was an absolute jerk for most of his speech. I think you are good to look for the right in what he's saying, and I thought he made some good points. But, he and the organization are haters. There is no room for that now
@GaleScheelar there were about 20 minutes late in the speech that I thought would have been useful in the "listening" session at the white house yesterday...genuinely...there may have been more good stuff in it, but I was taking my blood pressure through the 1st half...broke the darn thing
@FainMattheau ah... I'd venture to say that more than most conservatives, at least what I grew up understanding conservatives to be, are not sexist or racist. I think conservatives need to clarify for me who they are now. Watching Trump supporters doesn't reconcile...
@HeadShrinkInc ah...wit. I am very partisan and  a sentient human being.
@erinvalynn Well, he said I don't care about safety in America's schools and said I use tragedy as a political tactic. He said that to me, Sean Astin. He meant it personally and I think it was hateful. God Bless me too Erin.
@The_Imbroglio06 makes sense
@The_Imbroglio06 Reed, I'd say this comment is beneath you, but I don't know you. My Dad taught me that 2 wrongs don't make a right.
@SlimChaby well...I don't think they are keeping any of their feelings private...	I'm a gun advocate of sorts...a liberal, fairytale gun advocate...
@FainMattheau Which part Mattheau?
@weaverwarren1 I think Satan would be like, "bro, be cool. you shouldn't joke about shit like that"	This comment was humor, brought 2u by someone who just accused of not caring about American Schools, using tragedy to advance a political aim...oh and of being an anti-capitalist I guess marxist?
@NoLongerSilent6 @EntitledGreek hmm...I don't want to play out this scenario anymore so...we'll leave it at a horrifying concept and move on...
@SlimChaby My first draft was less politic and more entertaining. I just realized that the NRA as presented today by that dill-weed is eager to stoke my anger and pit me against my friends and neighbors. I just wish more Americans would force themselves to puke through it so we can move on.
@EntitledGreek He was clearly stoking the hatred that buttresses a civil war. I don't want to take people's lawful guns away. But, if the U.S. Government wanted to, it probably could, even if you and your friends had tanks and mortars and an aircraft carrier.
This was an offensive &amp; deranged rant peppered with useful ideas. It was the death moan of a dinosaur who‚Äôs ideology fell into a crevasse long ago. It was a divisive, ugly and hate fueled speech, which masked its important insights &amp; truths. I hope the student/activists watch it. https://t.co/gFlM2GaXcy

@ChrisRHood finally..I love you BUT is not a good sentence. I love you. Unconditionally. Even when you are wrong. What he is doing is fantastic. What he said hurt his cause. My comment helps Cameron. Yours does not.
@ChrisRHood More than that...did you watch the clip...he said maybe the NRA rep couldn't look herself in the mirror...the audience gasped at him...he was shocked at their reaction...he took the steam out of the thunderous response to his question. Did you even read what I wrote?
@ChrisRHood what are you talking about...I'm jumping up and down celebrating him...stop infantilizing him. The young man, old enough to fight in a war and purchase an AR legally is standing up...he NEEDs a little guidance...I'm offering some from the cheap seats. It's the right thing to do.
@globalgrrrl8 clever but wrong...I was trying to offer guidance...it was sound...you either didn't watch the clip or just being an
@TeeRavis_K the NRA has done a terrible job of explaining its values
@Fife24 i agree
@ken_fantry I want him to win...going blue will suck the oxygen out of the movement...it's warranted but deadly to the cause...of course he and they deserve all compassion and consideration...but the power of the movement comes from the immediacy...the learning curve is steep and fast...
@rrw315 Blame sucks...but yes...he is responsible for what he says and how he says it. Cameron learned in the moment that what he said was a turn off...He'll keep getting smarter, stronger and more effective...
@ShanklinCathy Yes they can and I do expect it of them...and of myself...and Kellyanne etc...	But, the spotlight is on the students now and if they want to hold it long enough to really bring the changes they seek to fruition...they will hold themselves to do better...they've started strong!!!

@RaeAnnEmerySAG Milita's in the late 1700's were bad ass. It could be cool to make certain kinds of weapons training compulsory for kids in States that still wish to be ready to stand against the Union.
@SmithWessonNme I believe Citizens should have the almost absolute right 2 defend themselves. Civilization (weapons technology, population growth, industry, mental health, transportation, communication) has outgrown 2A. Managing growth shouldn't threaten anyone. Legislate that spirit. 2/2
@SmithWessonNme School Safety is the issue right now. I hear a lot of ideas being thrown out there 2day. Raising age of AR's to 21 seems obvious. Bump stock ban seems easy. I don't think schools should have armory's, but armed guards and metal detectors now seems right. Assault Weapons "ban" 1/2
@MAFAtlanta bump stocks could be an important milestone for the gun advocacy community
@timalinger @wendster73 Either you support 2A or you don't? I call bs on this statement. My support is conditional.
@Angiepro4 well, when you put it like that...anxiety isn't helpful...learning ourselves and conquering our fears is powerful personal development...but this school violence issue comes at our society like a deadly bolt of lightening...good people will solve it...you will...I will...we will

@LynSouth I agree. But, I don't think u heard what he said after the massive roar 2 his blisteringly simple question about Rubio refusing NRA money. The cheering crowd boo'd Cameron! I think that's what I heard. I've been expecting little over confidence...good 2 learn &amp; on 2 Victory!
@vickskat hubris gets the best of us all...but...the power of this moment could consume all of it's fuel if the students don't get support and guidance as they march up the hill...
@IHTop10Guy I give him credit for walking into that predictable buzz-saw. But, his rationalizing taking money from "ANYONE" who believes in his agenda is horrifying if true and embarrassing for it's transparent icky-ness.
@LynSouth that snark is the death knell of this movement
@JennRoberts78 I know. Remember this, the average age of the combat vet in Viet Nam was 19. THE AVERAGE AGE...so, lots were younger. These students are amazing. They've been raised in school shooting media patterns and they are ready for this fight. But, the spotlight is searing &amp; gunning 4them
@JohnRHornbuckle @MolliMcRey @chad_flamm figuring out who's who is tricky...I think there should be an emergency effort to start the process and then a well funded formal transparent trusted government process...ie the CDC research on the issue...that decent people can understand...consistent with the constitution
@Pennywize992000 awesome
@natalieraymond @SovietViolet i know right...I'm the star of my own rambo movie too...it's human nature to want control. The heroism that would have your dad pull a kid out of a burning car is roiling under the surface of the gun debate. I like him. I bet I could convince him to take AR's out of non-mil use
This could be a law before my birthday. https://t.co/qBWESZj7RU
@Bongley72 while I wouldn't phrase it as Eric did, I think your statement is unfair and unhelpful.
@JimC146 Thank you for your service. I too have studied it. #2A's continuing efficacy is well worth addressing. I'd advocate for amending it again, to further clarify gun owners rights and to allow for the awesome differences in the world since it was written.
@JimC146 Ok. I deleted my last effort. The Bill of Rights is indeed a founding document. The framers were knowledgable and afraid that even our Government could become  overbearing. The 2nd Amendment sought to address this dynamic. I think that things have changed over time.
@JohnRHornbuckle @MolliMcRey @chad_flamm alas, they don't live in a vacuum and if their mothers can tell them not to play with dynamite in the barn, she can probably tell them not to sell automatic weapons to teenagers...grandpa's shot gun will do for protection and dad's rifle's good for hunting. Think bigger John.
@natalieraymond @SovietViolet that's why they want all members of their group to be armed...somehow together, they hope to fight off the mightiest military in history...the irony is that these high school kids may just prove that tectonic changes can be made without firing a shot.
@MIGlutenFreeGal I liked the 1st bit...but to call a frightened person a liar isn't helpful or what I think of as Christian.
@colonelpowpow Yes. As I said, it's a valid fear. The fabric of society is fraying in many disturbing ways. It's justified to sense a looming threat. The leap of faith we make as Americans is that we will work together in hard times. 300 million guns and a ubiquitous fear of kids safety is bad.
True story of the NRA is that they have tapped into a primal &amp; valid fear, not just of "the government," but of the total collapse of civil order. The unpatriotic thing is that they aren't planning on working together when that happens. They pull up the moral draw bridge &amp; fight.
@MKGenest they are pushing a rock up a steep hill....we all have to rush in behind them for support...
This is such a non-partisan thread. It's crushing to see what we are all forced to live with. If there was a dragon in our midst, we'd find a slayer. Today, an army of children are heading into battle for us. Incredible. https://t.co/dVO1qFqepD

@Jsaint9 This is an unfair knock. I'm relieved he gave the kids a forum &amp; he did seem 2 listen. He didn't take on anything that he disagreed with, but he did hear. Trump can read the tea leaves of this moment &amp; can take credit, I don't care who does, as long as school safety is enhanced.
@Charyoutree19 Fear gets crowded out by confidence. More mass shootings will happen. When they do, I'd like 2 think it's while we are in the process of trying to solve the problem rather than because we're sitting ducks. I'm open to taking all sorts of actions, most are being widely discussed.
@JardenWymond damn skippy
Lots r worried that the student led school safety protest will fail. They r part of the problem. There's a time 4 doubt. This is not it. If the ground swell keeps building leaders will have 2 act. NRA is Ozymandias-Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!	Nothing beside remains.
4 me, it's every single day. There's a lot 2b scared of-drunk drivers, earthquakes etc. But in the morning, whether I'm home or not, my heart literally physically pains at the thought of a school shooting with my kids-unholy mental cycle-figure the odds, gamble with their lives
When American parents drop their kids off at school, the thought &amp; fear that there could be a shooting that day crosses their minds, how often?

@sandmarv83 walking in a parade is AWESOME. Trump wants a show of force tanks...fighter jets, missiles...he'll back off and settle for less, but what he wants isn't truly about the troops...it's about Trump and his bs idea of negotiating leverage.

@sandmarv83 History and context. Let's throw a hundred ticker-tape parades. Trump wants tanks and missiles and armed looking troops. If you can't see that, given our Presidents statements on the world stage, combined with this charade, I don't know what to tell you. WWI, WWII no such parades

Well, in this case...the Poster is coveted...but, I think of autographs like a virtual hug or something...it's a moment...movies &amp; tv connect with people on a deep level (sometimes)...signing a name is powerful...contracts etc...I'm grateful that people like connecting that way. https://t.co/ElmmrcTX1R

WOW. That idea just trips me out. FUN!!! https://t.co/DjesfqFkj4
of course...I keep telling her how happy I am that as people discover her music...on its own terms...she will enjoy that autonomy. Red was just sad for some reason. Also, Ali is releasing her album herself. Dad is her primary PR strategy. It works. But, of course you are right! https://t.co/7SwNhRpome
too much Dad love...obsessing on my kids first album...hawking people to pre-order it...shilling for her merch..."using" my generous followers hip to boost her up???

Oh right. Yes. It took 45 minutes of scrolling through 16,000 names 2 FOLLOW 100. Finger flick up-names scroll up-finger click up-names scroll up.	Most of the selectees/winners is the wrong word, (no one who helped me is a loser) sent addresses. I'm thinking about doing it again. https://t.co/QnycT9kVXk
It's taking effort 2 reach out 2 everyone, get addresses, labels, envelopes, stamps. I'm just one man. The Autographs are the easy part :-)) I took a break &amp; bought a pillow of Ali. I said do merch. She said ehhh...I said do merch. Now I have a pillow. 		https://t.co/N8ILMgl1ls

I just Pre-Ordered the whole album. Amazon sent me an email confirmation. Remember @Ali_Astin_ doesn't officially release "Take 1" for 9 days, Christmas Eve. There are buttons on her website https://t.co/jRxyyawQc9 but they won't be "live" until tomorrow. Thanks 4 the heads up. https://t.co/vP60AWrnCy

I will beg. I will plead. I will cajole. I will grovel. I will get down on my belly like a reptile. She's self-publishing. If I can't help her get 10,000 followers on twitter, I'm a skunk. Lower than a skunk, I'm oil in the street. Please Follow @Ali_Astin_ #NoPrideButDadPride üò± https://t.co/sN80JL7GDC

Great question. No. Actually, I've had 2B incredibly patient as she has labored over the album 4 years. Now a junior at Harvard (proud again get used 2 it), Ali wants 2 promote her music. It's time. She'd probably take exception w/ some of my wording, but she's at college, tough! https://t.co/bzauzkZLAE
This Poloroid is of Ali in costume as Eleanor Gamgee, 1st child of Rosie Cotton &amp; Samwise Gamgee in Lord of the Rings. #LOTR She is 21 now &amp; a singer/songwriter about 2 drop her first album Christmas Eve. PLEASE RINGERS, Follow her new Twitter Account @Ali_Astin_ https://t.co/hDLt9yd4oW
By request, here is a photograph of Ali &amp; me. We were in my dressing room on set of The Lord of the Rings. #LOTR She played Eleanor. All grown up now. Pretty please, follow Ali on her brand new twitter account (1 tweet). Singer/Songwriter - Her 1st Album drops on Christmas Eve. https://t.co/aevTR6ctqH
An early adopter! In fact, if Ali @Ali_Astin_ gets to 10,000 followers by Christmas Eve and our FaceBook Live, the day her first album drops, I will pick 100 of her followers randomly, direct message them long enough to get a mailing address &amp; send each an autographed picture!!! https://t.co/A7k0WMdAjm
WAAAAAYYY too hard to choose. When I was training for the IM Triathlon in Kona, I didn't listen to music during training...even 7 hour bike rides. But, Ali's music was in my head and on my playlist. I would play &amp; sing them in my mind as a rode. LOVE "Young at Heart" @Ali_Astin_ https://t.co/Dk3WPIb7hL
You aint seen nothin yet. I'm a wiz and promoting internet campaigns....My oldest kid wrote, produced and sings her first album?

Working late but had 2 wonder aloud. I keep seeing these great memes in response 2 my tweets. I feel like the people in the memes actually agree with me. When I meet them in person, I just know I'm going to forget that they didn't actually respond 2 me.#NoNeedforAdditionalPraise
Your first tweet ever @Ali_Astin_ and it is blow away!!! I read it 15 times. 	Hey Everyone, this is my oldest daughter Ali. She's studying Drama &amp; English at @Harvard (proud much). Her 1st Album drops on Christmas Eve. Follow her now!!! https://t.co/6AurD0btVk
OMG I've never felt so invigorated on Twitter. I think my Mom just took over my body mind and spirit. Big issues. Much more nuance and time is required to truly unpack them. I have deep respect for my Pro-Life brothers and sisters. Let's find a forum to really discuss!
I consider it all the time. My party has totally ignored me in that regard. I'm not an independent, I'm just not.

Humility check. This gun violence conversation is really meaningful &amp; I have strong opinions, but just so u know, I know I don't know it all
@paulgmunger I think religion has let us all down...so far...the reach of the major religions could really help and the appeal of smaller ones can too...
@Crispitina30 if one shoots a clerk, one gets money...thats "a" reason...it's a question of empathy and self control...kind of enlightenment perhaps...
@paulgmunger ffunny, whenever I put "discuss" at the end of a tweet, no one comments,yet that's the talk, all about how we (the nation) need a discussion
@rocdomz ohh....I thought you were asking about my 2nd amendment conversation...my mandate on that show was civil discourse...Trump makes that tricky
So, gun violence is the raging topic today...I'm thinking back to the days of yore when athlete's knelt about the justice system. #Related
Some violence has to do with survival, i guess. There is pugilism in sport. But, I believe most human violence is perverse &amp; preventable. https://t.co/Nt6oBAbKKi

Why are you making a distinction? Clearly, a major factor in gun violence is inadequate mental health treatment. Intertwined man... https://t.co/oib7YZQJwm
Tougher to debate argument in favor of liberal gun laws, is that people are scared of what happens when civil society breaks down. Discuss.
If civilization survives, hundreds of years from now, they'll look upon 21st Century American gun deaths, the way we look at the middle ages

No joke, Trump is a genius.	He is impressed with the NFL Solidarity in a way that suggests he's responsible 4 it. Well, he is. Brilliant. üôÑ
AMERICA!!! Keep the pressure on...I can hear the pitter-pat of Trumps winning heart speeding up. He overreached this time and he knows it.

We need a National kneeling moment. Wherever you are, take a knee in solidarity with all fair minded, peace loving people. #TakeAKnee
Reminder: Kneeling is often associated with prayer, i.e.: pray for a stronger more inclusive America.
I bet people are kneeling in the stands.
I'd like to see every player, every coach, every person in every stadium take a knee together during our anthem. 	#UNITY	#GODBLESSAMERICA

Children in our country-South Korea-Japan &amp; others r terrified about the prospect of Nuclear War. Mr. President remember that when you talk.
The U.S. would certainly "win" any, all out armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula. The question is: At what cost?
I'm glued 2 Ken Burn's PBS documentary on Viet Nam this week. A North Korea nuclear exchange would demand a U.S. ground war in Asia. Folly.

@ericakossatkine He doesn't have the creativity dexterity or discipline-I discern a written voice that's reckless. I think he shudders at having 2defend them
P.S. Trump doesn't write his own tweets.
His compassion seems selective based on circumstance. His tweets aren't reassuring. It's not the golf club locker room-It's the world stage.
Do you know the mind and heart of our leader? Are you certain that his instincts knowledge and training will serve us well?
@RNFleming @MyTweetingName @realDonaldTrump People are listening. People who live in mortal danger who's lives are being affected. Was it for them? Sum up their suffering? Listening

Just got off a plane-Look at that, big symbolic action on the ground in #Baltimore. Community members cleaning up the mess together-Right on
.@ro_shanae I always take the idea seriously-But-pretty sure I'd b a novelty distraction-Someone(s) from the community has 2breakthrough
Repeat good ideas	Carefully follow those who articulate them best	Prioritize Peace 	Stick together 	Value expert advice	@JustinFreeves
Yep. &amp; when that behavior is rewarded &amp; a culture of intolerance 4 abuse flows through police ranks, it can improve @jonnyward21 @ro_shanae
Peace &amp; smart civil disobedience works wonders when people r on the right side of history, as they are here @kili4rili @KimberleeTaylor
Dang spell check-I can spell-I love Conservatives who's rhetoric elevates   discussion &amp; forces me 2 develop my opinions @CopTheTruth
What the place needs is huge, impossible to miss, peaceful, symbolic action. Directed spontaneity, nonviolent groundswell NOW @ro_shanae
My Father lives in Baltimore. I'm always happy when I visit him. There r plenty of voices in the city who can lead https://t.co/s0n5wKzEgt
Well, I appreciate your translation. I wasn't sure what was being said, just that it was burdensome &amp; distracting @Telinda28 @kili4rili
I like him. Just not including his viewpoint on this.	//@Ogre @KestrelArts
Which is why I've said so several times here. So, amen! 	/@kili4rili @KimberleeTaylor
I'm an expert in that skill. Bona fide &amp; time tested But I'm gonna zero in on advancing a cause 4 the moment Requires discretion @ro_shanae
No. On my Twitter feed I'm calling for leadership, peace, action. I do this after, during &amp; before listening... @kili4rili @KimberleeTaylor
@kili4rili I get 2say whatever I want Hey u person who's suffered in ways I cld never understand get ur foot off that guys throat.C? Said it
What point are you trying to make. My life of privilege obligated me to serve others. What are you doing? @KimberleeTaylor
Blockin u 4 awhile man. Your flame throwing nonsense does a disservice 2 concervatism.	::@AdamBaldwin
Fear is totally justified. The goal therefore should b unity common cause. A week ago, we were close... Let's get it back.	@lowerthanbilbo
The point is to attempt to understand our differences not tuck them in a corner safe from moral scrutiny @KimberleeTaylor
Left right center up down middle... hollow and mind numbing labels that crush discourse...@Corbinclark87 @benshapiro
Call them poets or generals...ur use of that phrase as a pejorative is hackneyed //@AdamBaldwin @ikepigott
Plenty of time. Let's do it 2nite. Stay on the sidewalks. Obey traffic signals. Takes 5 minutes on Twitter &amp;FB pass the word /@ikepigott
Yes! Offer some. I'll try too. 	50 million person candlelight march 4 peace &amp; compassionate community policing.	//@ikepigott @AdamBaldwin
.@PhickOTM just? just? Technology, tactics &amp; consciousness have certainly changed. Patterns of human suffering &amp; abuse, well, don't give up
That was my point. The groundswell of support 4 dealing with abuse is vaporizing as media capitalizes on this distraction @ikepigott
So let's plan. What shall we do? This hot moment will pass in 100 hours &amp; the community will have 2beg 4 attention until next vid@Telinda28
Interesting stat. And??? https://t.co/CY3XYvriOA
I honestly have no idea what political reality u r referring 2. This is happening now. New paradigms r possible @KestrelArts @AdamBaldwin

@ikepigott @AdamBaldwin fancy words, dehumanizing words... the people have the advantage hear? They are squandering it
.@Telinda28 Ghandi shut down the country with sit ins. The right kinds of disruption r critical tools. Real leaders articulate &amp; plan them
.@pikachupirate yes it is, always anyones place 2advocate 4 peace, which is what I was doing. I'm trying 2help not argue 4their mistakes
The Civil Rights movement has made progress w down payments of sacrifice. Riots r a smash &amp; grab robbery of its legacy. @djhahn13 @benfox3
.@kristenmchugh22 well, I agree w 1/2 of what u said. Media ain't helping. But, those kids &amp; whoever was stoking them were flat out wrong
We can try to understand anger, but their violence last night? Wrong.	/‚Äú@PhillipCMcGuire: @SeanAstin "Right" and "wrong" are subjective.‚Äù
.@amazonprincss millions of people marching, singing, chanting, voting‚Ä¶all quite dramatic
.@benfox3 I hate 2 admit, but there is a time 2 fight. This is not that time. Overwhelming support 4 better treatment is being drowned out
.@benfox3 defending lawlessness last night is waste of time. a tiny bit of leadership &amp;real commitment from the community, they will b heard
I notice when I'm right, not a lot of response on twitter. When I'm wrong, everyone speaks up. It's time to do the right thing. ADVOCATE!!!
.@vannyevenstar88 Yes. Focused anger. King said hopefully "THEY" oppressors make a mistake‚Ä¶yesterday the community collectively screwed up
.@benfox3 anyone who stands around when people assault police runs the risk of being caught in the violence. Civil Disobedience way smarter
Yes Ben what about them Their cause is badly injured 2day What r u going 2 do?	/‚Äú@BenFox3: what about innocent teenagers injured by police?‚Äù

I'll go back 2my neutral corner when I hear a leader break through media white noise &amp; say/do something that seems 2have a prayer of working
The stage is set 4 the status quo 2 win the day. Don't let it. 	All of the normal players r assuming all of the normal roles. Peace &amp; Action
Solutions Solutions Solutions.	Grab back the narrative.	Do something Righteous &amp; Epic immediately. Find things to agree on. 	Don't sit still
Community needs 2do something  symbolic 2 outshine violence CANDLELIGHT MARCHES. Every City 2nite 4 PEACE &amp; Compassionate Community Policing
Holding good thoughts for #Baltimore Police injured in the line of duty yesterday.
