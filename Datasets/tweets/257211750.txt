@AkronOhioMayor Specifically, ways to reduce speeding in the neighborhoods. Police enforcement isn't enough. Need more permanent solutions.
@AkronOhioMayor What is the city doing to beautify neighborhoods like Firestone Park? Need engineering solutions to make streets safer for families.
@senrobportman Weren't you one of the 13 white guys that drafted the first piece of garbage? You might be able to do better but I won't hold my breath.

At least Wallace knows what Election Day is.
Wallace can't stop from laughing.
Hillary just basically said Trump is paranoid. Which meds should he be on?
Why does he keep bringing up MacArthur and Patton? They are spinning in their graves because this tool keeps saying their names.
That's just horrifying. Pretty well sums it up.
Trump is so far off the rails with the claims of widespread voter fraud. Even state Republicans think this is batshit crazy.
Trump Foundation is a small foundation, just like my hands.
Oh the fuckin e-mails again.
Nobody has more respect for women than I do. You realize that saying something over and over does not make it true.
If we run this country like Donald runs his business we would be bankrupt several times over already.
Did Donald just shush Hillary?
Donald loves to ship jobs everywhere. It is nice to see the @steelworkers getting some love on the topic of Chinese steel.
Friends? I doubt the Donald has any real friends.
Even the conservative economists think your numbers are bullshit and you can't add. Do conservative economists use different numbers?
Hillary is getting pissed!! I like it.
Trump is literally a man baby.
Donald is doing math now. 550% That's YUUUGGGEE
The WikiLeaks strikes again.
Seriously. Is it bigly or big league? I still can't figure out what the hell he is even trying to say.
Hey ooohhhh. Hit Trump with the use of illegal immigrants on his buildings. He didn't even to try and deny it.
Oh? Going to do very much better, huh? Somebody is Hooked on Phonics.
Doesn't Trump realize that ICE didn't endorse him? It was their union. Crazy to think their union would endorse him.
Tonights debate is brought to you by Jack Daniel's. Because nothing else helps when shit is this bad.
@SenSherrodBrown proud he voted against DOMA even though it cost him politically. He knows he's on the right side of history.

@resqvol @kempsuper9 I think there is a severe case of short term memory loss when it comes to what public safety does and has done.
@resqvol @kempsuper9 Watching the city spend money on useless endeavors while they shirk pension obligations can get you a little irritated.
@kempsuper9 You ask me what I want like it matters. I advocate for the city to keep promises like I have. I know we disagree there.
@kempsuper9 If promises are not kept to current public safety there will be little reason to stay.
@kempsuper9 I suppose reasonable is subjective. I don't want to see that either but current obligations to all must be kept.
@kempsuper9 Yep unfortunate but oh well, huh? You have been beating this drum for several years now to pull the pension from under employees
@mffa1784 Sounds like @kempsuper9 has his mind made up and @LeeHarris4MTOWN might have an open mind about the pension issue.
@kempsuper9 No matter how many times you try to bend this issue to suit your wants and needs the city has notheld up its end of the bargain.
@kempsuper9 @LeeHarris4MTOWN Employees with less than 10 years service are all giving more not just new employees. Lets see how much SS cost

@FlinnShady @Mediaverse @mjtomek Really doesn't make it any easier to stomach.
@Mediaverse @mjtomek @FlinnShady This issue is not the first to start the erosion of the faith employees have in the city to keep promises.
@Mediaverse @mjtomek @FlinnShady Don't forget non vested employees started putting more money in the pension to help about 2 years ago.
@Mediaverse @mjtomek @FlinnShady It might be if it wasn't true. They see the erosion of staffing and benefits as a sign of things to come.
"@mjtomek: Although he preaches it like he practices it, @MayorACWharton's lack of transparency is almost comical"
@mjtomek @FlinnShady @Mediaverse There are plenty on the FD that are already looking elsewhere with these benefit changes being discussed.
@FlinnShady @Mediaverse That is a point that many cannot seem to grasp. The pension is certainly more cost effective if ran properly.
@Mediaverse @FlinnShady I hope the admin and your colleagues on the council see it as a scalpel issue as well.
@Mediaverse @FlinnShady I don't have the ability to reduce my contribution when I want to. The city shouldn't have the ability to do it.
@FlinnShady @Mediaverse This has been a known problem for years, nothing has been done. Now it can be used as an excuse to reduce benefits.
@Mediaverse Looking for this transition to be a real "transparent" process.
@FlinnShady @Mediaverse I thought the sustainability argument centered on the lack of funds contributed by the city. CAO left that out.
