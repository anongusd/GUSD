@_michaelbrooks Cornyn is way more popular than Cruz.  He will loose. When Abbot’s term is up and there is no incumbent he should run for Governor. No incumbency advantage.
@realDonaldTrump Lol this is the 15th time in the last year you’ve tweeted “trade progress with China”
@charliekirk11 Like 8 people say that. What everyone else says is that we should require stricter background checks so peoole who aren’t stable enough for 22st century technology can’t get their hands on guns.
@charliekirk11 Did you mention our toppling of toppling democratically elected regimes and supporting right-wing brutal dictators? And that the people reacted to these by electing socialist leaders? No? Okay I figured.
@charliekirk11 FACT: the fact that you said “plurality” of suburban woman means that a majority does not. We know from polling that only 40% of the overall public supports building a wall. Somebody needs to teach TPUSA how Math works.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump “According to the average in polls for Obama: 48%. According to one outlier poll on Trump: 50%.” The 538, Gallup and RCP average of Trump is around 42% - 6 points LESS than Obama.
You lost the house popular vote by 7% and 12m less votes in senate. Even without California you got 3m less votes (also how much less you got than Hillary).

@dpakman You are a proponent of modern monetary theory. While financing expansionary policy through deficits works well when there is still slack in the economy, when enacted when at full capacity does it risk inflation or higher rates due to fed tightening to counteract inflation?

@blakeromak @RoKhanna @AndrewYangVFA According to MIT and our state department, 40% of existing jobs will be gone by 2040. We automated away 4m manufacturing jobs. Most new jobs are low paying and part time. 1k /m is not enough to make people stay home. It will make this transition a whole lot easier.
@TheLizMac @TheDemocrats First of all - that’s fine if that is your argument, but they CERTAINLY were sold as a huge helping hand to ordinary people. Second - even under that definition we should still be prioritizing the people who need relief MORE.
@RoKhanna The big tech companies will be making massive profits as technology continues to evolve. Listen to @AndrewYangVFA - let’s add a VAT tax and fund universal basic income for all Americans!
@TheLizMac @TheDemocrats My point is before we help the people who are already doing well, we should help the people who really need it and on average got peanuts from this bill. Our priorities are backwards.
@TheLizMac @TheDemocrats Also, my point was cutting taxes for JUST the wealthy (see last tweet) doesn’t help the little guy who is the one who needs help. I’m happy you personally got a decent cut, but the average for the bottom 60% was peanuts, and some people got tax increases.
@TheLizMac @TheDemocrats If only the lower brackets are lowered, since we have a progressive tax system and we pay each eligible marginal tax rate, EVERYONE gets a tax cut. By also cutting the top brackets, that additional $ only goes to the wealthy. This caused our deficit to double.
RT @NeriZilber: Only 42% of Palestinians favored the Gaza “marches of return,” again varying by location: 50% in West Bank, *29% in Gaza*.…
Math 101: for Republicans who say they think it’s fair to cut taxes “for everyone” - you can do so by ONLY cutting the lower marginal rates, as since we have a progressive tax system everyone pays each eligible rate, thus cutting taxes for the wealthy too.
@TheLizMac @TheDemocrats I understand - my point was the bill disproportionately helps the wealthy. Our problem isn’t the wealthy not having enough money, it is a working &amp; middle class who don’t have enough. The TCJA did little to help the problem while giving massive breaks to the wealthy.
@TheDemocrats The bottom quintile of Americans saved $60/year. The top 0.1% saved over 100K/year. Let that sink in.

@NateSilver538 Love this analysis. So much competition on the left. Age shouldn’t matter but it will. We only know his performance against one unpopular establishment candidate. Less caucus states. I think he went from a front runner to an solid candidate, who’s candidacy could go either way.
@CNN Candidates talk about making it easier to pay off student debt - which is great (and Amy gave one of the better answers I’ve seen here)- however no one talks about how to lower tuition costs so we don’t need as large loans in the first place.
@NateSilver538 Agreed. Recognizing this isn’t an endorsement of one candidate over another. I happen to like Sanders and Warren. However the most fruitful conversations happen after we listen to our opponents and debate why our policy and record are better, not why WE are better.
@charliekirk11 Talk about a political hack. No one said capitalism is evil, or socialism is the answer. Most recognize the right answer is somewhere on the spectrum like we have now. Plenty of refugees running to European social democracies. Swap it to democracy and authoritarianism.

@mossywilly2 @charliekirk11 @AOC @AndrewYangVFA “My intuitions should not be challenged by facts.” 1) By adding a VAT we will capture money from industry increasingly paying less in taxes. 2) by having 325m people be given 12k/yr, there will be BILLIONS in additional spending in our economy
@FiveThirtyEight I’m shocked how despite everything it is that high. That’s what Fox News will do. A recent FDU study showed that Fox viewers have LESS KNOWLEDGE of the news than someone who watches NO NEWS, as the news they receive is propaganda.
@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 And you haven’t given me one example. You’ve only said “they want looser policies, which I am calling open borders, and therefore they want open borders”
@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 Again, some liberals want looser policies than you (they still want border security and most immigration bills in the senate have overwhelmingly dem support) but not one congressperson actual wants actual open borders. Neither by rhetoric or by policy.
@TomEAdams2 @charliekirk11 I looked up the numbers and they were correct. The way they were being presented was misleading. That is fantastic about the nonprofit through, good for you.
@charliekirk11 You’re going to regret this will Democrat’s declare gun violence a national emergency
@TomEAdams2 @charliekirk11 THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES TO HOMELESS PEOPLE! They aren’t giving each homeless person 33K a year. They are building shelters, paying employees of shelters and kitchens, other accommodation. The whole premise of the post was stupid. That’s my point.
@TomEAdams2 @charliekirk11 NY employees 15K fire fighters and paramedics. 2.04M budget. That is 136K per person. Compared to 33K per person for homeless (the number Charlie gave). The math is easy, although I can understand why a Republican wouldn’t be able to follow
@mitch_pool @charliekirk11 That’s disgusting
@charliekirk11 How many fire employees are there? There are probably way less than 61K so it comes out to way more than 33K per person. Meanwhile, if you don’t spend money on the homeless, especially being able to get them shelter during the winter they will die.

@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 Im denying that? I recognize that hacks like Charlie co-opted the definition to just mean “policies I don’t like” or “trying to change the electorate” to scare people. I’m saying, it looks idiotic to people with an education, and it is a less accurate way of saying something
@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 If you want to say someone isn’t strong on border security fine. But don’t pretend 1) a wall is the most effective way to spend X, and 2) any policy you don’t like is open borders, a concept that has a clearly defined definition. Don’t sacrifice accuracy for fear mongering
@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 No! There is a definition of open borders used among economists and acidemics. That definition is anyone in the world has the freedom to come and come and go. Taking down a wall that was proven to not effect El Paso’s crime rate is not “open borders.”
@mattybones8 @charliekirk11 No? I disagree with sanctuary cities but that’s different then allowing anyone to enter our country without restriction. It is a bad policy. Not “open borders”
@Oil_vampire @charliekirk11 I am for reducing illegal immigration. However, I don’t think they are the cause of all of our problems, and I don’t think a wall is the most effective version of border security. I would support wall funding as part of a comprehensive package however

@Skidog1111 @NPR Revenue needs to rise a certain % every year to keep up with increases spending (@GOP raises military budget by 80b, and google “inflation”). Revenues “increased” bc the economy is growing but not enough to cover costs due to tax bill. That’s why deficit DOUBLED.

@KyleKulinski It’s not about calling the interests out. @mattyglesias did a great job of that in his new piece. It is about calling them out responsibly in a way that doesn’t reference centuries-old anti-Semitic tropes. Even @_michaelbrooks  realizes that. Call them out responsibly.

@Bobhunicut @_michaelbrooks @IlhanMN I was referencing her first tweet (not the AIPAC tweet) where she implied $ was the only reason people support israel. Reasons: freest country in the region, surrounded by neighbors who want exterminate it, provides intelligence. $ is small reason of many.
@payton_mason3 Care to elaborate on why I’m lying?
@NBCNews This terrifies me. The progressive vote is so fractured that one strong establishment candidate could sweep through the early primaries.
@politico What I want to know is why someone “wouldn’t know” if they were the kind of person who would dress up in black face or like KKK. If you don’t know whether your character is strong enough to not do so, you are already flawed.
@AneelLakhani001 @cenkuygur @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Of course not. But 1) implying $ is the only reason one would support Israel, and 2) dancing dangerously close to conspiracies in an age of rising anti-semitism where our president is emboldening Nazis. Criticize, but criticize responsibly.
@cenkuygur @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump 100% agreed. With that said, what are your thoughts on her comments? Clearly irresponsible.
@realDonaldTrump “I will be in El Paso to repeat the lie from my #SOTU that their wall stopped crime, despite it being one of the safest cities of its size BEFORE the wall”
@Bobhunicut @_michaelbrooks @IlhanMN I respectfully disagree. She insinuated that the ONLY reason politicians support Israel is AIPAC. There are plenty of good reasons. Also, her tweets from 2012 talked about “hypnosis”. This, and the recent tweets reference classic anti-semetic tropes. Criticize responsibly.
@_michaelbrooks @_michaelbrooks I agree that her @IlhanMN’s comments probably weren’t anti-Semitic, however do you think her phrasing was responsible for an age of rising anti-semitism emboldened by our president?
@FiveThirtyEight I’m honestly astonished that 40% of the country support this man. This is why @TheDemocrats need to focus on voter turnout rather than trying to appeal to “moderates” who would consider voting for this man.
@micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight In recent decades Governors have favored better than Senators despite their lack of foreign policy experience. With that said, we can all agree the you need to at least upgrade from to HOR to the adults-table Senate before you stand a chance (with a few exceptions, Lincoln etc)
@RWPUSA Agreed. J-street proves that people, even Jews can be openly critical towards Israel. However @IlhanMN’s language is irresponsible in an age of rising anti-Semitism where Nazis are emboldened by @realDonaldTrump
@burgessev @politico @marianne_levine I’m not convinced Republicans are doing this to hurt her. I don’t think she stands a chance. While she is popular among her constituents and wonks like myself, most Americans don’t know who she is
@NateSilver538 While I actually disagree with the premise (I think politicians who support popular policies like Medicare for all and free college will fair better), I think Biden is an exemption as he appeals to the two-time Obama turned Trump voters.
@mattyglesias No she didn’t (although she should). In an age of rising anti-semitism where nazis are emboldened by our president, we should be speaking more carefully. We can discuss Israel and AIPAC without using buzzwords for anti-semetic tropes.
@JessicaV_CIS @NumbersUSA If you count merely crossing the border as a crime, then you are correct. However it is not a crime, rather a misdemeanor like a speeding ticket. You can argue your point (stricter immigration enforcement) without being disingenuous.

@CNN Great idea - the many Trump voters who had their “jobs taken by immigrants” can take jobs as scarecrows on the border. They pay minimum wage since that is apparently enough to live on!
@charliekirk11 Okay a right wing political hack would not understand the difference between climate and weather
Even if @IlhanMN’s tweet wasn’t anti-Semitic it was irresponsible. To imply that money is the only reason people support Israel is just wrong. At a time when anti-semetic violence is on the rise and nazis are emboldened by our president, we should be careful with our language.
@amyklobuchar Professional suggestion: even if your staff is tweeting don’t speak in third person! It comes across kinda weird!

@charliekirk11 Wasn’t the opportunity to get this done when your party controlled congress? Dems have no reason to give in. Also, by your logic Trump can declare a national emergency and build the wall anytime over the next two years, do this is not the “only time” he can get it done.

@CNN @realDonaldTrump’s little hands couldn’t have gotten any smaller in the cold!
@thehill I’m all for a crowded democratic field as I think debate is good for the party, but Pete is running just for notoriety to eventually run for IN governor
@realDonaldTrump Cue example 473837 of a Republican not understanding the difference climate and weather
@adviseagainstit I made my Twitter two days ago dude chill.
@CNN EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES A NEW SCANDAL JESUS. He is really taking a page from @realDonaldTrump’s playbook
@nucciAnnalisa @JoeNBC @GOP They wanted a tax bill that saves them millions every year and they got it. Buying politicians was a great return in investment
@thehill It’s probably exhausting trying to tweet headlines on @foxandfriends really fast before they change
@thehill @TheHillOpinion I’m all for politicians having guts and not acting like robots, but the younger generation must repudiate the toxicity of @realDonaldTrump
I don’t mind @BetoORourke, but I don’t think there is any room in the crowded field for him. Establishment voters will support someone with more experience who didn’t just loose an election, and progressives will already have a selection of better candidates to choose from.
@TroyMOwens2 @AP @realDonaldTrump Think about it, if it was one of the safest cities in the country with higher levels of border crossings before the wall, it will probably remain safe when crossings are WAY lower even if there is still no wall
@TroyMOwens2 @AP @realDonaldTrump That is a very good question. The number of border crossings today are the lowest in decades, so I think that El Passo’s crime rate would have stayed low if there had been no wall, as the problem was stopping all by itself.
@diana1dlz @SassyODaisy Couldn’t agree more!
@thehill Good for @SenWarren. @TheDemocrats need their 2020 candidate to be able to fight back against @realDonaldTrump and not just take it like @HillaryClinton did.
RT @bungarsargon: 85% of British Jews think @jeremycorbyn is anti-Semitic. When 85% of any other minority says someone is racist, we believ…
@bungarsargon @brianbeutler @jeremycorbyn The sad reality of anti-semitism today. Both the US and UK have seen staggering year over year increases in anti-semetic attacks. Leaders in both countries (Trump and Corbyn) are emboldening them.
@TroyMOwens2 @AP @realDonaldTrump Before the fence put in in 2008 as authorized by the Secure Fence Act if 2006..... nothing. Still one of the safest cities in the country before the wall, thr opposite of what Trump claimed.
@JoeNBC Bad investment for the @GOP. The Billionaires got exactly what they wanted.
@SassyODaisy @amyklobuchar As someone with a 50 year old secretary I couldn’t agree more. I’m just saying the Klobuchar situation is more more complicated than being a little rude or angry with a subordinate.
@realDonaldTrump “I work so hard watching Fox News, tweeting, spending time at my hotels, and golfing more than any other President”
@Slate This is exactly what I thought would happen. Rather than repealing Roe, the Roberts court will kill access to abortion by a thousand cuts, by opting to not hear cases regarding states restricting abortion laws.
@NPR While I hope we do withdraw US troops from Syria (and Afghanistan too for that matter), I really hope we continue in some way to support the Kurds, who have been so integral to the defeat of ISIS.
@AP Not only do many in Texas say that, but in 2008, BEFORE THE WALL WAS BUILT, El Paso was already one of the safest cities of its size in the US. Per usual, @realDonaldTrump LIED
@SassyODaisy @amyklobuchar I honestly do like Amy, she has been an awesome senator. It is certainly more complicated than getting angry for someone doing their job poorly. And yes, I and others found it funny.
@thehill Even if you believe that, we should at least stick with Medicare for all before negotiations start. Better than Obama caving on a public option before the debate even started in congress (I know that was more complicated but hey this is Twitter)
@amyklobuchar *taken immediately before she splashed the hot coffee in one of her staffers for misspelling a word on a memo*
@thehill “It is the Democrats fault they won’t give me the wall funding I couldn’t even get when my party had complete control over congress”
@CNN I think VA just surpassed FL on the list of “what the fuck is going on” and surpassed NJ in the list of “wow everyone we elect is corrupt or has skeletons in their closet”
@washingtonpost “Representative whose entire career is based on her father’s political success insults a self-made colleague who rose to popularity because of her intelligence and benevolence towards others”
@thumps3343 @charliekirk11 I can’t think of one person who argues that ALL of our problems are because of Trump. Most argue that he is a symptom of larger problems we are facing, and that there are some problems that stem directly from having someone so erratic and uninformed in the White House.
@NateSilver538 On the one hand l like @amyklobuchar, but on another hand my TV isn’t wide enough to show all 50 presidential candidates in the debate stage. I’ll be okay however this one works out.
@charliekirk11 I can’t take a political commentator seriously when he thinks one person out of 535 in one of three branches of government will have equal impact than the president of the United States
@_michaelbrooks @SamSeder No, I’m totally not checking your channel every five minutes to see your response to @SamHarrisOrg’s appearance on @joerogan or anything...
@Glennon1961 So he joined office, the recession worsened, more people got a food stamps, and since then people have gradually been getting off food stamps. It hasn’t reached the level of his first year YET, but it is still declining from the peak
@mattyglesias After reading @ezraklein’s many pieces identity I’m pessimistic over whether people will be able to ignore the provocations.
@DantonGeri Fascinating thought. My only counter is: South Korea is allied with the US (and the West) not just because of North Korea, but also because of our economic ties. If the Koreas merge the West will remain an ally because of all the existing commerce.
@HuffPost Talk about a media hack who missed the entire point of the deal: aspiration goals we should strive for. Clearly we aren’t supposed to generate real policy from a 14 page non-binding resolution #GreenNewDeal
@StateStreetETFs @InsideETFs These can be traded commission free on TD Ameritrade’s platform 😍
@CNN Although I’m am initially outraged by CNNs establishment bias, take this counter: a candidate who holds massively popular positions (medicare for all, living wage, free college, end the wars, all supported by 60%+) will fair way better than someone who doesn’t.
@Glennon1961 Because of the worst recession since the Great Depression. It spiked initially and then declined his last few years in office.
@commonsense258 @Glennon1961 I wasn’t saying them in sequential order.... good catch I’m glad great minds is twitter can name the last 3 presidents
@Glennon1961 The unemployment rate dropped from 8.5% to 4.5% under Obama. It rose from 4% to 8.5% under Bush. I offer math tutoring for Republicans, DM if interested
@thehill The sad thing is that @SenWarren’s cringe-worthy DNA test will probably hurt her more that any of @realDonaldTrump’s nasty racist tweets will ever hurt him
@washingtonpost @ChristineEmba The right is saying “she is pushing people away from the left.” This is hogwash. No likely Democratic voter is going to vote for a Republican because of her. However, @AOC is exactly what the left needs to energize and then out their base.
@sir_studboy @HenriNullset0 @voxdotcom @AOC Why do I want to marginalize poor people?
@thehill I can’t stand @realDonaldTrump but this was brilliant strategy. At the #SOTU most of the Democrats stood and clapped when he said we “will never be a socialist country.” This will further divide the caucus when they need to stay together to win in 2020
@thenation It’s almost like we don’t want the world we inherit to be ravaged by climate change
@cenkuygur @HowardSchultz @DrJillStein @CNN Every time CNN’s Chris Cillizza puts out a new 2020 list that has Kamala Harris in the top and doesn’t mention Bernie Sanders (he was doing this before anyone announced) I get furious
@washingtonpost *tried to stay relevant while he determines whether he will run for President*
@washingtonpost I mean they become one of the largest companies in the world while he had a mistress so clearly they will be fine now that he is only juggling one woman
@realDonaldTrump “I couldn’t get the wall when my party controlled congress, I’m totally going to get it now while @TheDemocrats control the house.”
@sir_studboy @HenriNullset0 @voxdotcom @AOC I agree that the goals collectively are not attainable, however many of the goals individually are attainable, and we can also start making progress on most of the areas addressed. You have 100s of pragmatic bills. This one is a vision.
@thehill Okay, and @TheDemocrats never voted to take away people’s healthcare 50+ times and to cut social services. So....
@voxdotcom To everyone attacking @AOC and #GreenNewDeal, you are missing the point. A 14 page non-binding resolution is clearly not meant to be LITERALLY passed into law. Rather, it outlines goals we should strive for (renewables, clean infrastructure, jobs programs, reducing CO2, etc)
@thenation Getting rid of the electoral college would require a constitutional amendment which will never happen. What we can do is pass a law saying we will divide each states’ electoral votes proportionally, which will closely resemble the popular vote.
@JohnPow87242433 @ewarren Great answer to my question
@cenkuygur @SenWarren All of this outrage about her ancestry makes me furious. How did any of us know our ancestry before DNA tests? By what our parents told us! Clearly releasing the results was bad optics but I believe she thought she was Native American!
@ewarren You’re my #1 choice so far! My only question is: if someone is worth over 50m and their business is the near entirety of their net worth, will they be forced to sell off part of their business to pay the wealth tax? Will there be some sort of exemption for non-liquid assets?
@thenation @SenatorCollins I thought he was supposed to uphold Roe? It’s almost as if we could predict this by looking at his record
@dpakman @realDonaldTrump By making them have to really work to get food and not rely on the government, they will be so motivated by their starvation they will grow their economy! It’s so clear @dpakman
@voxdotcom She is my #1 choice as of now. My only question is: would the wealth tax require individuals who have most of their net worth tied up in their business to sell bits and prices each year to pay the tax? Idk how I feel about that
@thenation HoW aRe We goInG To AfOrd SinGle PaYeR HeAlTh InsUraNCe??
@politico “Is America ready for a president with long toenails?”
@marklevinshow Okay so clearly I am pro Israel (see profile picture), however a bill that says states can not give contracts to someone based on their political beliefs CLEARLY violates free speech. States should be make their decisions on an individual basis, not based on broad categories.
@Slate Say what you want about Nancy Pelosi, but watching her emasculate Trump during the shutdown was the best possible way to start 2019
@benshapiro I mean we could base the documentaries off of candidates from the party who lost the house popular vote by 7% and got 12m less votes in the Senate, but history is written about the winners 👌
@thenation @SenatorCollins Escuse me, don’t you mean “it is more likely than not” that Bret Kavanaugh is attacking abortion rights 😁
@voxdotcom While I hate the fact that people don’t understand the difference between their tax liability and their tax refund, I relish watching Trump voters freak out over the @GOP tax bill screwing them 😂
@realDonaldTrump Wow the world def ended in 2012 and I’m in some twisted afterlife cause there is no way the president of the United States just said that about Kim Jong Un
@HuffPost One better reason everyone is hating billionaires: after watching all the economic gains go to the top .1% working people want a slice of the gains.
@thenation @realDonaldTrump is preying on the racial anxiety of white Americans. Studies have shown when presented evidence of a diversifying America the politics of white Americans shift right. A really messed up strategy to boost 2020 turnout...
@thehill “Trump must not serve a second term. I will now do everything in my power to help him do so”
@thenation It’s legitimately scary to think that @realDonaldTrump could rally the nation into re-electing him by initiating a regime-change war in Venezuela that is supported by the the establishment in both political parties
@RubinReport please debate @dpakman or @SamSeder. Why the hypocrisy on the importance of the “battle of ideas?”
@RalstonReports @daveweigel Establishment bias?
@RichardRubinDC @WSJ Who would have thought people would feel weary about doling their taxes after the longest government shutdown in record, with the possibility of another one looming
@lynnterra7 @CNN How has the court swung left? Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are both rated far to the right ideologically. Meanwhile the former swing, Kennedy, was more to the left than Roberts. Roberts has swing votes but was more reliably to the right than OConnor or Kennedy.
@NewYorker It’s sad that despite this, states with stronger gun control have less gun crime in average
@jaketapper @kaitlancollins @TheLeadCNN His definition of wall has devolved from a physical barrier from sea to sea to strategically placed steal slats. He will accept any deal with some funding after being emasculated by @SpeakerPelosi during the shutdown.
@CNN It’s sad that while we once considered Sandra Day OConnor to be a swing judge, the court has swung so far right that John Roberts is now a swing judge
@politico According to the @TaxPolicyCenter 90% of Americans are paying less in taxes. However the @USTreasury lowered withholding so much that most people are getting less of a refund. Tax burden does not = refund!!
@TVietor08 @brianbeutler I’m glad we are investigating ties with Russia, but how are we not looking into how how our president contradicted our intelligence agencies and at every opportunity seemed sympathetic to the Saudis to not ruin an arms deal
@tedlieu @KSAmofaEN @AdelAljubeir @realDonaldTrump This tweet codifies Ted as one of the most badass members of Congress
@NBCNews $10 says this was typed up by Trump like his last check two years ago
@mattyglesias While yes proportionally regressive, the removal of the SALT deduction still hurts many ordinary families in high-tax states. Maybe increase the cap from 10K to 35K but keep it capped @mattyglesias?
@Slate You know what they say - the best policy comes from non-binding 14 page resolutions! #GreenNewDeal
@JerryDunleavy @benshapiro He clearly meant he only holds CANS of beer in his left hand guys, common. Everyone knows when it comes to glasses @GovernorVA is a right hand man.

@TheStalwart Are you telling me that if your base your political ideology in something meaningless and try to enact it by cutting programs people love people will stop supporting you??
RT @TheStalwart: It has to be demoralizing being a deficit hawk since not only have they failed on their own terms (the debt has exploded)…
@thehill On the one hand I like @amyklobuchar. However on another hand my TV isn’t wide enough to fit all 50 presidential candidates on the debate stage. I’ll be alright however way this one works out
@BobbyTBD @landonacomet He never said he was going to investigate @HillaryClinton before he locked her up! What? Do you think @Jim_Jordan respects due process?? Please...
@ProudResister @landonacomet @JacksonLeeTX18 : “Sir, please answer me. I only have five  minutes.”  Whitaker: “Um... I... I mean... can you repeat the question?” #WhitakerTestimony
@thehill If @realDonaldTrump couldn’t get a wall funding when his party controlled congress, I don’t know why he thinks Democrats will just bend and give him the wall
@Derrick_Andrace @thehill @BretBaier @TuckerCarlson Thanks for having my back man, almost forgot one 😂
@NatashaBertrand @TheAtlantic @SenSherrodBrown I support opening Medicare as a public option, however there is a case to be made (that @mattyglesias makes well) that focusing on lowering eligibility of Medicare to 55 can be a better electoral and political strategy in the short term. Thoughts?
@washingtonpost Let me get this straight: the Governor, Secretary of State, and leader of the Virginia GOP all wore blackface, and the LT Governor has two sexual assault allegations? Watch VA turning red be the reason @realDonaldTrump wins again in #2020
@mattyglesias You know what they say, all good policy comes from non-binding 14-page resolutions! #GreenNewDeal
@lisastark351 “Have you ever been interviewed by a congressional committee before?” “Well...uh..I mean...can you repeat the question?”
@washingtonpost Wait, you’re telling me that if #Democrats stick to their guns and don’t just quiver to #Republican demands they can get things done?? I don’t believe it...
@mattyglesias If by quality you mean “support medicare for all, free public college, ending the wars, takes no PAC money and doesn’t bundle large donations, and argues like they have some balls” then yes I agree
@CNN The guy who resigned from UKIP once Brexit passed, is now starting ANOTHER party to push along Brexit. In five years: “@Nigel_Farage is starting a 7th party, as he is not satisfied with Brexit” #Brexit
@voxdotcom “Despite having aged two years, been under immense stress, and being significantly overweight, Donald Trump is the healthiest President to ever exist”
@defdee @thehill Yea no, had Hitler not tried to expand German territory Germany and all its Jews would have been totally fine...😒
@seedsofevil @thehill Compared to Trump she still is 😂😂
@mattyglesias @davidpakmanshow On the one hand I am bothered by people confusing overall tax burdens with their tax refunds. On another hand I really enjoy watching Trump voters realize the #TaxCuts weren’t that great for working people 🤷‍♂️

@fortismind @thehill Watching @JacksonLeeTX18 try to get yes or no answers from Whitaker was like asking a five-year-old if they took a cookie from the cookie jar #WhitakerHearing
@thehill I swear, @BretBaier and Chris Wallace are the only people at Fox News willing to criticize the Trump administration (besides @TuckerCarlson that one time between rants about immigrants)
