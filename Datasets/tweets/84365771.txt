NOT BREAKING NEWS: Jeff Flake to vote for Kavanaugh nomination. He told us that when he made his statement to Kavanaugh #KanavaughHearings
My bet: The GOP will meet tonight and decide to move on with this Committee vote tomorrow. They will spend the weekend trying to woo Senator Susan Collins before the floor vote on Tuesday. Don’t just get mad...take notes on who stood where, and build a strategy. #KavanaughHearing
@MrLegacyJones Well and that even supposes that Feinstein mishandled Ford’s request for anonymity.
Here’s my conclusion...after seeing how Kavanaugh handled this pressure moment, I see nothing remarkable or different as a nominee. Why not another nominee? Oh that’s right, his opinions on whether a sitting President can be tried were appealing to Trump. #KavanaughHearing
@MrLegacyJones @TheTallMJT Oh yeah...the devil’s triangle is a sexual term.

Good question. Did the GOP Senators just dismiss #RachelMitchell from asking questions to Kavanaugh? This is not a good look. #KavanaughHearing #KavanaughFord https://t.co/PE0OJhXXHB
Notice how remarkably different Kavanaugh’s disposition is amongst his two hearings. The first one was him trying to uphold a good boy image, and now this Kavanaugh is very petty and combative. This is the #SCOTUSNominee... #KavanaughHearing
A question that people ought to ask is why Jeff Flake towed the line in allowing #RachelMitchell to ask his questions for him. He’s leaving office at the end of this term...if he really wanted to know what happened, he could have interrogated them himself. #KavanaughHearing
Boy the privilege that is coming from Brett Kavanaugh is strong! I think he hopes Trump is watching and will back him...because Trump surely gave himself an out in yesterday’s bizarre press conference. #KanavaughHearing #KavanaughFord
Brett Kavanaugh is having a melt down at the top this round of questioning. Where is his legal counsel to pull him down and reset?!?! Yikes!!! #KavanaughFord #KavanaghHearings
Brett Kavanaugh lost the crowd when he referred to this nomination and allegations proceedings as a “national disgrace”. The fact that he cannot see the importance of going through all of the facts should be of concern. #KavanaughHearing
So, you probably shouldn’t refer to movies like ‘Animal House’ and ‘Caddy Shack’ to explain your yearbook entries as a argument of dissuasion. It shows how tone deaf you are to the issue and the times, and further explains the Country’s unease with your nom. #KavanaghHearing
Interesting indeed 🤔 https://t.co/9A1LeSFB3m
If his opening remarks continue in this manner, Brett Kavanaugh should just withdraw his nomination. He keeps referring to this system of privilege that has propagated, supported, and in cases covered for people that look like him and share the same gender. #KavanaghHearing
Brett Kavanaugh must have heard Donald Trump’s critique of him, because he decided to come out in attack/defense mode. We’ll see how this plays with the court of public opinion. I can tell you that some POC hear/see white male privilege  on full display. #KavanaghHearing
@Frederc10 Needed this article! Thanks for the resource as always @Frederc10
This is why the GOP put #RachelMitchell up. It’s like trying to put a band-aid on a gaping festering wound that demands surgery. Diversity and Inclusion should be the name of the game for them, but most likely it will be willfully ignored. https://t.co/4mwjcflNqH
If this #KavanaughFord hearing doesn’t again expose the lack of true Diversity and Inclusion in the GOP when it comes to Women and people of color...at this point it is clear that they are aware but don’t care. #KavanaghHearing #Diversity #Inclusion
At this point two things are very clear: (1) Brett Kavanaugh better bring it because 👀😳...(2) GOP should strongly consider whether this fight and timeline is worth it. #KavanaughHearing #KavanaughFordHearing #IBelieveDrFord
"This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault." Dr. Christine Ford. #KavanaghHearing #KavanaughFord #IBelieveDrFord

So, can we all agree that Grassley should just expand the time limit that each Senator is given? Yes, Senate hearings are political theater, but this limitation won’t play well for GOP if they are hoping to come across as empathetic. #KavanaughHearing
@Dinibobini That’s exactly the problem. In these allegations, there is strictly one victim until the full story is heard. Grassley clumped their post revelation experiences together saying “they’ve received death threats...etc”. (Referring to both Ford and Kavanaugh). This is intentional.
By having #RachelMitchell ask questions for these GOP Senators it uncovers a few things: (1) Their glaring lack of adequate diversity in gender, race, and ethnicity. (2) The reality that they are so steeped in politics that they can’t do their job alone. #KavanaughHearing
From Sen. Grassley’s opening statement, it suggests that there are two victims here in these allegations 😳.  #KavanaughHearings

@realDonaldTrump calls for waving judicial process for “these ppl invading” (as if they are armed). And at least 17k agree with him.😳 White privilege allows him to use the term invasion while forgetting that ppl looking like him invaded this nation pre America’s inception. https://t.co/25J14gZLG7

@alexgudich It’s not about who was “here first” but who truly understands policy and it’s implementation. We have the receipts to prove AG Sessions is against reform PERIOD, and his policies are bringing us back to increasing prison pop. Again implementation is key. Last time addressing this
@alexgudich No need to go private. I’ll leave it to turning your attention to reading the full SRCA bill. It is not perfect, but it is by NO MEANS worse than this PR bill. Part of the disconnect is that people haven’t taken time to actually read all the language and consider implementation.
@alexgudich I mistakenly left out “w/o” #accountability. This bill does not provide accountability...and we’ve seen how fluid this Admin has been on that hence the recklessness cited in the account of Mark Inch.  Also SRCA has a chance to be improved on the floor, as opposed to this bill.

Change must begin in our hearts and minds, influence our conduct in communities, and then charge our government officials to be better. #GrandStrategy Pt. 2
This #grandstrategy sounds idealistic and detached from reality. Yet all it requires is for all of us to get over ourselves and reevaluate these issues from a more inclusive and inspired mindset.
A #grandstrategy calls for a fundamental shift in thinking from ALL OF US on what is real, possible, and required. It calls for empowering the voiceless and then playing second fiddle to let them lead the way. Know your onramps and offramps as a mentor.
Additionally politicians must be willing to forsake “drive through mentalities”. Every public policy issue is attached to actual human lives with actual consequences. This means deliberation does matter. Be willing to work thru weekends to ensure robust dialogue towards solutions
It requires politicians to always consider what is not just “politically possible”, but also morally mandatory. Don’t get so comfortable scratching backs that you mute your voice or lose your vision. After all, politicians are still advocates. #grandstrategy
It requires speaking in a unified voice to Congress. Vague language often provide loopholes and ways of shrugging off responsibility and implementation. Be unified, clear, concise, and direct. Never let these politicians feel like their job isn’t on the line #grandstrategy
It requires voters to discard “my 4 and no more” viewpoints and truly vote to protect the interests of others as well, especially when you or someone you know won’t always be directly benefitted. #grandstrategy
It requires voters to grow from being single issue voters to thinking like governors. Governors have to produce effective solutions, taking into account the broad array of issues that must simultaneously be addressed. #grandstrategy
It calls for us advocates to be completely ok with not getting any credit, name recognition, or visibility as long as the issue is fixed for the voiceless and marginalized whom we represent. #grandstrategy
From social justice warriors and advocates it means embracing intersectionality and plotting an issue map that distinguished which issues deserve the lion share of our policy, media, mobilization efforts...and it must be across all the orgs in the soc just space. #grandstrategy
Such a #grandstrategy calls for social justice groups, advocates, and individual voters to come to the table and figure out a set list of priorities to change this world. And it calls for sacrifice from each of the sectors at the table. #solutions
What we need in this country is a grand strategy, not amongst the politicians, but against the populous. Such a grand strategy calls for activists, advocates, influencers, and policy pushers working together. Otherwise these separate works look like grandstanding #grandstrategy
Given that lawmakers are beholden to the people, when they say something is not politically expedient or they draw a line, what they mean is this isn’t “comfortable” (whether for them or an ally)...it never means it’s impossible. Don’t settle, push them to do what’s right.

@mrvtherecruiter @KevinARing @alexgudich @BrennanCenter While both include exclusions, to which I am personally opposed, the SRCA has both sentencing reform and prison reform components, which matter (prison reform can’t happen with unmanageable populations). 3/4 of Senators publicly endorse SRCA. House should follow.

@alexgudich @BrennanCenter I’m saying all advocates must ensure that their motives are right constantly when engaging in this work. If you find that the shoe fits in needing to revamp your motives (as all must do at some point no matter how long they’re in the game) then you should probably do so.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter No, is that what you are saying? I’m not referring to Members of Congress at all. As advocates it is our job to make sure our motives are right when we engage in this work, not the politicians.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter I won’t name specific individuals. In reference to the Senate question, the SRCA can absolutely be strengthened, it has to be called to floor. Sen. Grassley has jumped through all the hoops presented by McConnell and the WH, and they have yet to call his bill up.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter I never said the SRCA exclusions were better, but am noting the fact that these exclusions are attached to a bill that has 3/4 support amongst senators (who represent whole states) and has Sentencing reform attached to it, instead of a questionable PR bill in the house.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter This work is always tough like every other issue. There will never be perfect legislation, and concessions will always have to be made. However, motives matter in this work, and ensuring that the deliverables happen, while giving room to build further.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Given that politics is about desire to move, yes it could be feasible. It is not, because we don’t push back against it. Congress can always do what it wants...but my main point is, if it is not feasible, and if this bill’s future is uncertain, then why also lose messaging?
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Many of the dems who voted for this bill on the committee were probably hoping to be able to have their colleagues help improve it on the floor. Given that it is being brought under suspension removes that possibility.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Yes the SRCA has a list of exclusions, of which I and others have been opposed to, however the lists of exclusions are very different in the House bill. Additionally, again the SRCA has the ability to be improved on the floor.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Where do you get the number 100,000?
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Again, awaiting the proof on the inaccuracies posed by @BrennanCenter and the Durbin letter. If there are no receipts that prove their claims false then acknowledge that, but don’t malign them as misguided unless it is indeed so.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Again “all who are applicable” which means when added with that list of exclusions it makes it null and void. And to your earlier point, the correct answer is no exclusions whatsoever. Why are we promoting “deserving vs. undeserving” narratives?
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Your assumption of what is politically possible is based solely on the House side, and not accounting for the Senate side. This is why understanding how this gov works is important. People settled for the House narrative when there is still a viable alive option in the Senate.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Which brings us back to the issue. The something that is better than nothing is the SRCA, which includes prison reform, and can be amended on the floor to include other helpful prison reform measures.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter That report was more than 10 years old and based on certain other factors that are not in place currently. They need to provide an updated report, which they have readily expressed does not exist.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter This is why understanding the details of policy and how government works matters. Otherwise you unwittingly waste the capital of your clients by sending them down the wrong path, or associating w/ policies that don’t deliver for them. They need results not rhetoric.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter And for those who argue that “if it only gets one person free then that is fine” consider this: That is something Trump has at his discretion. Ask him, not Congress for this. We don’t call on Congress to change laws b/c of one shooting, but rather the larger aggregate... (cont’d)
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter I strongly encourage that people read the long list of exclusions of good time credits for these programmatic pieces in the First Step Act. Additionally, FBOP should be encouraged to provide updated numbers of how many people “could be released” given that the 4000 is from 10+ yr
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter The Jeffries letter and many proponents claim this bill is being mischaracterized by lies and innacuracies...produce the receipts that prove that this is so.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Something is better than nothing, when it is actually something. This notion that good time credits are open for all inmates is misleading. While everyone can participate, it won’t count for all inmates. Thus this serves as an undue barrier for participation.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter Even if we were to agree that Sentencing Reform is not possible in this Congress, this bill is still not a good prison reform bill. And given that it is due to be passed under suspension (meaning w/o amendments) these inadequacies will remain.
@alexgudich @BrennanCenter If @BrennanCenter is inaccurate, explain where in bill language the retroactivity accounts for the FBOP halfway houses closed, and the staff shortages amidst an upcoming decreased FBOP budget? Don’t just claim inaccuracies without providing direct evidence.
This is true. Even with the retroactive provisions, this bill lacks the mandate to actually find spaces for those who would be let out, as this administration has shown that it doesn’t adhere to laws. Not to mention that the “4000 released”	is not accurate. https://t.co/4cZ0pTWJHp

@Jmariandfriend1 @4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump She couldn’t really provide scriptural underpinnings, and when she attempted to her references weren’t in context. I disengaged in dialogue once I saw she was just after a fight...but have at it if you would like.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump Again you’re confused and looking for a fight, not trying to actually engage in meaningful dialogue. Be blessed.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump You should be less concerned about the vessel, and consider if she might have a godly point. And if her rock hadn’t hit somewhat accurately, you wouldn’t be offended in the first place. Come on sis, we all need to humble ourselves.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump Whether she is trying to lead ppl to repentance or not is missing the point. Should the church repent? Yes! Can God use any vessel to point that out? Yes! God has used animals, creation, and even sinners to get God’s people back on track.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump I’ll leave you right here with a strong encouragement to get to actually know scripture before you use it publicly. You should seek to be credible when you speak because it is a reflection before men of the God you serve. Be blessed
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump Ma’am don’t use scripture unless you know the proper context...because your recklessness (and pettiness) not only prove Tara’s pint on hypocrisy, but it also makes it harder on the rest of your Christian brothers and sisters. Be credible
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump For example, “If my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways (repentance)...which means repentance is a part of prayer. You should actually be supportive of Tara calling for a more specific form of prayer
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump Secondly, true Christians should stop simply throwing the method of prayer out there irresponsibly without connecting it to God’s heart and desired outcome. Prayer is not meant to be a political tool or Pharisaic measure to prove a point.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump First, Tara’s point was the hypocrisy of these evangelicals who want to pick and choose their righteous indignation moments, and then use the posture of prayer as a way to smooth over their own complicity with the immoral actions of this President.
@4RealWomen_ @TaraSetmayer @realDonaldTrump What are you talking about? Provide more context for your comments? Furthermore do you know what I’m talking about?
@TaraSetmayer “Maybe today should have been a National day of repentance”...talking abt White Evangelicals overlooking @realDonaldTrump moral character. Just be honest and say you wanted to keep power, but keep God’s name out of it please #pettypolitics #NationalDayofPrayer2018

Never forget: Congress can do whatever it wants. The WH can suggest all manner of proposals, but Congress has the power of the purse, and the ability to declare war. Your 2 senators and 1 Congressional Member deserve the same trolling scrutiny that you reserve for Donald Trump.
The question is not whether the Senate can get the 60 votes necessary to carry out Trump’s desired wall funding, but rather will the American people be able to keep our eyes on the appropriations ball to ensure that our Members of Congress don’t support this endeavor?
C)The FY00 Def Budg was $290.5 billion and this year’s request is just under $700 billion, with future defense spending ceilings to be virtually non-existent, we can expect more $$ to go to defense budgets for a wall w/o any 💵 being taken from other natl security line items.
B.) Politicians understand this, including Senate centrist dems in red leaning states (who may or may not be back after 2018) and may have to decide between the false premised optics of “failing to support the troops” or condoning the building of this unpopular wall.
A) Most American voters don’t understand Congressional procedures, and even less understand the Appropriations process (which is confusing on a great day).

I hope the American people are reading between the lines and the lies of this #SOTU speech...b/c your freedom depends on it. 🤷🏿‍♂️ IJS
Let’s be clear about this SOTU speech. Trump is painting a narrative of a “new America” that looks a lot like an old America under Jim Crow laws, and social and class constructs that imprison non-whites. And his slander of the immigrant community is deplorable. #SOTU #speakout
False premise by Trump that appeals to his willfully ignorant base     “It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system -- one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.”
Trump claims: “In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is "in God we trust.” —- Could @POTUS and the 81% of his white evangelical constituents please stop dragging God’s name in y’alls mess?
Ironic how Trump touts low unemployment rates for African Americans, and this mostly white August body is cheering wildly. To be clear...low unemployment by African Americans and Trump “policies” (or lack thereof) not directly correlated. #falsepremise
POTUS touts the death of the ACA individual mandate. And how shall healthcare be paid for? 🤔

Is upholding idols of a failed past worth obstructing a future of potential success? Diversity enriches our shared culture as Americans
Now that we have more diverse voices at the table, we should determine what actions bring unity to the nation overall...
Original decision to enshrine confederacy was made w/o vote or consent of major populations of country, particularly minorities in South...
Removing Confederate statues won't change history, but erasing the statues doesn't erase heritages or historical facts either...
If Confederate statutes come down, there will still be history books that allow ppl to reflect on the past.
Throwing down Confederate idols won't change characters and ♥️ but the defense of these idols indicate a heart position re: national unity.
I get that people consider Confederate statues as a sign of heritage...but please show me any other instance where we idolize losing side.

#Charlotesville events should be investigated as a hate crime and act of domestic terrrorism by white nationalists.
Jeff Sessions and Trump's "hatred on all sides" comments are very lacking yet not surprising.
Trump's statement on Charlottesville lacked the same direct approach of the White Supremacists had who chanted "Heil Trump" with MAGA hats.

Was there applause at the end of Trump's press conference? Really?
@rickhasen That's what I'm going with smh
@POTUS just suggested a Committee chairmanship should have been taken away b/c of HCare vote. Was this towards McCain or Murkowski?
Given @POTUS threatened NK w/ "Fire and Fury" it might be safe to assume he watched this week's GOT episode. Khaleesi inspired his verbiage.

@MarkHarrisNYC @MarkHarrisNYC for the win! 😂
If regular order produces similarly irresponsible bills, McCain may support it.
3) John McCain's vote tonight was not a support of the ACA, but rather his commitment to Senate procedures and regular order.
In fact, regular order allows GOP to draft bills that target the 10 centrist moderate Democrats up for reelection in states Trump won.
Hearings and committee votes can still produce similar bills that seek to overthrow the ACA.
2) Regular order is the way to go, but doesn't guarantee GOP will work to do the right thing...strengthen the ACA.
1) The architects of these bad GOP bills still remain in power. People like to call it #Trumpcare, but these bills were birthed in Congress.
Tonight's vote on "skinny repeal" does not mean that the fight is over. Let me remind everyone of the following:

@Rudy_Hammond my prediction is he leaves Rice as UN Amb, nominates Kerry.
@Rudy_Hammond He would because other than Kerry, no 1 knows fa better than Lugar, and Republicans would be hard pressed to fight his moves.
@___SPUD__ I was thinking the same thing bruh
@aaronlinzy yes it was. I enjoyed it.
@Rudy_Hammond He might. Pres. Obama has a history of being bipartisan in his cabinet pics (Sec. Gates). Lugar is well qualified.
@Rudy_Hammond true, It is worth restating that Rice was not responsible for Benghazi's unfurling.
@Rudy_Hammond that is a good assessment. I wonder if Obama wouldn't throw in a wild card and nominated Dick Lugar.
Pres. Obama will soon nominate a new Secretary of State. Who would you suggest, and why? #TDIpoll
Does the current economic situation in America suggest absolute poverty, inequality, or both? Your thoughts???

Some of the surface, polished questions that politicians ask do nothing more than waste time #stopyourselves
Lip service is nothing to God, but our life speaks volumes to Him...what are our lives telling Him?

@jeramymusic2009 pretty good song, liked the transition between the two main parts, and the message was positive. Cool...
Worship is not a slow song marked by much weeping, it's when you get in that place with God where you say and mean "I surrender".
Today we pray for God's restoration to the nation of Haiti, not only physical...but also the true peace of God that brings hope and life.
Good morning folks...let's make this a prosperous day in God...Keep your head up, your labor is not in vain.

@nikkiboo926 1) the day is blessed thanks. 2) Who still uses the term igging? Is that a noun, adjective, preposition?
@nikkiboo926 Hey...how is the day going?
Life is full of decisions, now it's time to pray that God shows me the right one to make.

MEMO: God is not shocked by the mistakes you make. He just requires that you come to Him and repent so that you don't continue in sin.
People who dwell on the past usually do this because they don't truly realize that they have a future.
