@weirdoveganimal @politico @ninaturner @CarmenYulinCruz @OurRevolution He's said these slight of hand comments so many times, most of us can see right through the apologies. We know propaganda when we hear it. We've been receiving this for years from the Republican Party. We don't want it from our nominee.
@weirdoveganimal @politico @ninaturner @CarmenYulinCruz @OurRevolution "they think that all that we need is people who are candidates who are black or white, who are black or Latino or woman or gay, regardless of what they stand for, that the end result is diversity." No candidate has ever said this, yet Bernie says this about his opponents.
@weirdoveganimal @politico @ninaturner @CarmenYulinCruz He used race as an issue against his primary opponents. 		https://t.co/OiSCKrEcHM
@weirdoveganimal @politico @ninaturner @CarmenYulinCruz It's fairly clear the way he uses language. He did it throughout the 2016 primary, and he's already doing it during this campaign.
2) Republicans can't run on a booming rural economy, so let's dust off more identity politics issues for the 2020 election.	Instead of informing voters of the truth, it's far easier to run on the politics of fear and anxiety, anger and outrage. #GaitherForiL
1) Should a 11-year old rape victim have forced c-section because old white men want to force women &amp; girls to do what they want?	It's no surprise @GOP run on demonizing women &amp; healthcare by targeting laws that protect women &amp; children. #GaitherForIL		https://t.co/d0peKF3yOf
@weirdoveganimal @politico I did watch the entire clip, as well as his Town Hall. He’s not going to broaden his message nor reach out to people who have different experiences &amp; opinions from his own. He’ll dodge ?s in ways that demonize his opponents as he did in ‘16.

@cinncitatus @RepKevinBrady @HouseGOP Yes, tax cuts are expenditures when you’re in the red, which we were before the @realDonaldTrump &amp; @GOP tax-cuts. Now, we’re borrowing money at record rates due to these failed Republican economic policies.
@politico Bernie doesn’t want to learn from past mistakes and certainly not from strong women with a record of achieving results for others. Can’t say I’m surprised.
@RepKevinBrady @HouseGOP You must forget that the vast majority of the debt accrued under President Obama was due to the Bush tax cuts &amp; 2 unfunded wars. It’s good of you to admit that your tax cuts cost over $1.5 trillion. Do you call it good fiscal policy not paying the bills? #GaitherForIL

4) Considering massive amounts of drugs our military interdicts with those efforts, robbing these funds is counterproductive to the objectives President Trump predicated his national emergency. When will Republicans stop endangering our troops and our homeland? #GaitherForIL

9) Yet, @GOP continue to enable willful ignorance &amp; now what has become open hostility for our military &amp; national security.	Enough is enough. The Republican Party no longer supports our military, our national security, border security or fiscal responsibility. #GaitherForIL
8) Trump's highlighting drugs flowing across the southern border further highlights his willful ignorance of what he's not tackling, reality. #ElChapo funneled drugs through border checkpoints, by sea, by air and through tunnels under border walls. #GaitherForIL
7) Sending the military to the border was supposed to be a deterrent. It was actually a failed midterm campaign ploy where @realDonaldTrump used American troops as props. #GaitherForIL
6) @PressSec highlighted humanitarian crisis at border today. This was a crisis of Trump's own making. His zero tolerance policies were supposed to dissuade people fleeing dangerous regimes. Instead, more caravans took off on the long and dangerous track northward. #GaitherForIL
5) And, now, he will rob our military in order to pay for construction of a wall that is not necessary to secure the border. Republicans will likely sit by while he sets a precedent that they will whine and cry about down the road under future Democratic presidents. #GaitherForIL

5) After Lampert scavenged company, employees are left w/o jobs &amp; executive class are left with $25 million to parachute into 2019 in comfort &amp; style. We have to address these excesses from failures as the market will never do so. #GaitherForIL		https://t.co/YOMXcFd0f8
4) But wait, Lampert's payouts don't end there. He sold Sears real estate to a holding company, which he owns nearly 45%. That means Sears has been paying that holding company rent, insurance, taxes and utilities and turning this around for 11% profit. #GaitherForIL
3) CEO of Sears, Eddie Lampert, was one of Sears major creditors. After bankruptcy, Lampert's holding company will likely gain ownership of all defunct Sears properties, since he's a secured lender unlike the other creditors that Sears owes. This is unacceptable. #GaitherForiL
2) Much like big bailouts during Great Recession gave big bonuses to those who created financial collapse, these golden parachutes are as disgusting as they are counterproductive. We have to address these excesses from failures as the market will never do so. #GaitherForIL
1) This is what's wrong with American capitalism. A business is ran into the ground while those who oversaw the demise of the company are allowed to run off with Big Bonuses while workers &amp; the company's creditors are left with nothing. #GaitherForIL		https://t.co/BlXf6DyoRZ

@CourtneyDana1 @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump This isn't about taxes. It's about wasting taxpayer $ on Wall that won't get job done of border security. There already is a remittance tax. Consequences of increasing are problematic, as $ sent to families actually helps decrease illegal immigration here. #GaitherForIL
@CourtneyDana1 @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Israel's wall is 440 miles. They spent about $1 billion 15 yrs ago &amp; $9 million/yr in maintenance. U.S-Mexico border is 2,000 miles.

@RepShimkus funds his campaign with 88% PAC funds amounting to over $1.5 million. We're a grassroots funded campaign. It's amazing what dedicated people can do when they work together! Join us today as we reach the finish line!		https://t.co/9PLt3Md945

2. @RepShimkus wants to cut #SocialSecurity &amp; #Medicare to pay his corporate &amp; wealthy donors. With out of touch career politicians that don't engage with their constituents daily, of course they don't know better. Time for a new direction! #Gaither15IL 		https://t.co/eP89qzCrTS
1. It's 'Pass the Buck' time in Congress as we approach #ElectionDay. There's no surprise that the @GOP tax cuts with no guarantees for American workers &amp; investment would lead to whopping deficits &amp; rising national debt. #Gaither15IL		https://t.co/0KBFq08YzQ

@realDonaldTrump You don't care.
@dianesummers6 We’re making progress everywhere. @RepShimkus has been spending money in many places he hasn’t in a decade. He’s concerned.
@GOP, @RepShimkus have increased deficits/debt, made tax cuts 4 wealthiest Americans &amp; biggest corps perm instead of 4 Middle Class&amp;small businesses. You can buy what they're selling, but the the GOP agenda is a race to the bottom. #Gaither15IL 		https://t.co/eP89qzCrTS

@cathymcmorris Why have y'all held up #FarmBill, especially with farmers getting slammed with tariffs and basement prices? We need action, not words.@RepShimkus sat on the conference committee that failed to do their job. Our farmers are doing theirs. You do yours. #Gaither15IL
2. I'm thrilled to be on the ballot with great candidates in every corner of the 15th Dist. that are dedicated Americans that want to do what's right for their constituents when elected. That's why we're in this fight. To make real progress. #Gaither15IL	https://t.co/eP89qzCrTS

Rural America has been ignored by both parties.

@FoxNews You could say this would go under The Wall, correct?
2. @GOP let #FarmBill expire while farmers &amp; workers get hit by tariffs, and all @RepShimkus can do is continue to not show up. This is the Republican business model. 'Don't show up. Get re-elected. Do more damage. Line your pockets.' #Gaither15IL	https://t.co/eP89qzkQvi

@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump You realize the lowering of tariffs on car imports were already underway before he took office, right? The amazing thing is that China decided to continue with that approach. There's no word that all of the tariffs on Middle America will be halted.

@Helflower @drhonor I follow what I say. It’s called running for office with values and principles. The sanctimony is grouping Trump voters into one nasty block. You’re helping get him re-elected.
@Helflower @drhonor Your profile says ‘cherish others’ ... apparently not all others. Understanding, compassion, and patience go the distance when applied liberally.
@Helflower @drhonor Try talking with Democratic &amp; independent Trump voters. Chastising them, demeaning them doesn’t actually help. Having face to face conversations is helpful in understanding we have a great deal in common. Making generalizations only gathers those who agree with you.
@Helflower @drhonor Did you watch the second episode where she defended her grandson’s right to wear a skirt to school? If you want to rely on polling from 2016, we’d have a different Prez. 15th voted by over 46 points for Trump, median income is $46k. Polling can be used for any agenda.
@drhonor @Helflower Watch the show. It’s not about conservative politics. It’s about the marginalized economy throughout much of rural America. It’s real and needs to be addressed by both parties. Which is why I’m running for Congress. #Gaither15IL

Considering the trillions in no guarantee tax breaks for corporations and the elite, you'd think the highest productivity workers in the world would be receiving a lot more than chump change.
@GOP Yet y'all call it fake news when it doesn't match your propaganda. Curious.
@RepShimkus And,in our district? What about the 15th?
Accidental shooting in Alabama school. And, some want more guns in schools, in a gun manufacturing lobby bought for paid for proposal that won’t protect our children. 		In 30 days she would have turned 18. Another teenage boy was also shot. #Gaither15IL 		https://t.co/yScR4r7x2v

@KeithRothfus @RepShimkus @HouseCommerce @repgregwalden We have coal ash pits sitting in a flood plain on the Vermilion River, seeping into the ground water supply. Slapping the word “SENSE” on something usually means it’s nonsense.

@RepShimkus Shouldn’t we apply science and facts to other appropriations? 1 in 50 jobs created in America in 2016 were solar. Why aren’t we focusing on emerging industries that will grow jobs in our district?

@RepShimkus How about we increase women’s healthcare throughout the 15th so they have prenatal care. How about we make sure children and families struggling to make ends meet have enough food to put on the table. How about we use our faith to bring people together instead of tear us apart.
@LynnEllen70 @RepShimkus And, that hits predominantly women and young people more than anyone else.

@SpeakerRyan @RepShimkus A $2/hr increase would have resulted in over $4,000 more earned income in the pockets of individuals and families. That has real sustaining power. The CEO of Walmart makes over $2,500/hr, and that's if he worked every hr of the entire year. Workers deserve better.

@dogtagcrusch @FoxNews Let’s just watch our communities die, continue with the status quo, eh? Sorry. Unacceptable. Corporations just got 14% tax cut with no guarantees for workers. Meanwhile, Walmart is closing stores across the country. And, CEO gets an additional 10% for the year. #doublestandards.
@dogtagcrusch @FoxNews Also, you're making a lot of assumptions about the education, skills, and experience of those workers. That anyone thinks someone deserves $2,511 an hour is ridiculous. And, that's if the CEO was working every single hour of the year.
@dogtagcrusch @FoxNews What's funny or disturbing is that you don't see the disparity staring you right in the face.
https://t.co/eP89qzCrTS
Under this economy, in 2017 wages grew 60 cents an hour. Some companies can certainly afford a great deal more. Walmart profits were nearly $4 billion last year. 		I think the numbers speak for themselves, don’t you?		 #Gaither15IL (4/4)
This is the structural problem in our broken economy. Those at the top always give themselves pay raises and bonuses every single year. Hardworking Americans? Significant wage growth hasn’t happened in ages. #Gaither15IL (3/4)
Let’s compare that to Walmart’s CEO who got salary bump of 10+% last year, making over $22 million. Are employees getting any sort of similar pay raise? Hell no. They actually need their pay raise. They would actually spend their pay raise in their communities. #Gaither15IL (2/4)
Getting a $1000 bonus is amazing. Getting that bonus one time? Not so much. 		If Walmart employees were given a $2 raise, they’d earn $4160 a year. Now, that actually can make a significant difference in local economies. #Gaither15IL (1/4)		https://t.co/YCFJ64ABIP
@FoxNews Yeah, a $1000 is great. One time, not so much. If Walmart gave employees a $2 raise, they'd made $4160 more a year. The CEO got a salary bump of over 10% last year, making well over $22 million. The employees? Nope. This is the problem in our broken economy. #Gaither15IL

@FoxNews And yet, corporations still needed welfare from taxpayers, seniors, veterans, etc. We’re not rebuilding our country’s crumbling infrastructure. We added trillions to deficits &amp; debt without guarantees for creating jobs, increasing wages, and keeping jobs &amp; capital in America

@RepShimkus @RepKevinBrady Not to mention the increases in premiums and deductibles for healthcare. The cost in deficits and debt is substantial for no gains for workers' wages and good paying jobs.
@RepShimkus @RepKevinBrady It's unfortunate that the top rate was decreased, the corporate rate was dropped by 14 points permanently, and that many of the lowest income earners will get a tax hike under your tax reform bill.
Finally, adding $1.5 trillion to the debt without fixing our infrastructure, without raising wages, and without creating jobs is simply not fiscally responsible. 		We should expect more from our elected officials. (6/6)
Despite any benefits working families and small businesses may see from the limited and short term tax relief they receive from this bill, the increases in healthcare premiums and deductibles will offset that significantly. (5/6)
Further, the negotiated GOP-Shimkus tax plan drops the top rate substantially while many of the lowest income Americans could see a tax hike. This provides the least amount of the benefits for the Middle Class and those who need every dollar they earn. (4/6)
Believing that corporations will magically start producing jobs and increasing wages after years of ever increasing record stock prices and record profits is hoping for a White Christmas during a 50 degree winter. (3/6)
What makes the GOP-Shimkus tax plan such an unfortunate bill of goods for the 15th District is that the tax cuts for workers and small businesses are extremely short term while the tax cuts for corporations are permanent. (2/6)
Tax reform is necessary. All tax reform is not equal. 		We must deliver significant tax reduction to working families and real relief to small businesses, not corporate welfare, as the Trump-Shimkus plan delivers. (1/6)

@realDonaldTrump Permanent corporate taxcuts when stocks and profits are at record highs will only increase deficits and debts, not increase wages and jobs, and not fix the infrastructure. Meanwhile, rural voters starve and premiums and deductibles increase. Where does the Buck Stop?
@RepShimkus @EPAScottPruitt It’s too bad you support big energy companies over the small ones that are in the 15th. Those smaller companies care about their communities and the environment and are being squashed out of the market by your policies.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Amazing how over the last few years this was all Fake News under @BarackObama. Just to be clear . . . in rural America, the reality is grim. Wages are stagnant. There's no relief in sight, especially with the @RepShimkus-GOP reform bill that will hurt small businesses.
@RepShimkus These graphics are numbers are meant to confuse the reality. Medical deductions are out in the House bill. Tuition waivers are taxed. Property tax deductions are out. Small businesses are going to be hurt in the 15th in favor of big corporations making record profits.
To offset the over trillion dollars in debt and deficits, the GOP will next be looking to trim Medicare, Social Security, and other programs. This is simply unacceptable to me, as it should be to anyone who ages or has a disability. (4/4)
The offsets in the standard deduction won't come close to matching that medical expense deduction either.	This is yet another example of how this tax reform bill is bad for the residents of the 15th District and bad for America. (3/4)
Long term care is expensive and eats up the deductible for health insurance. It also can eat up an individual’s tax liability as well. Removing that deduction will hurt people significantly. (2/4)
The medical expense deduction will be removed if the tax bill Rep. John Shimkus passed becomes law. Considering over 5% of filers use this deduction, this is fairly significant. The negotiations in the conference committee will be crucial. (1/4)	https://t.co/DDJFGi5go3

@RepShimkus Can you not be tempted to payback your big money donors and instead focus on the needs of your constituents?
@RepShimkus Yeah. People will be working three or four jobs to make ends meet. Not the right plan for the 15th. We need a tax reform plan that isn’t a permanent corporate welfare giveaway at the expense of your constituents. Come on, man

@RepShimkus Dropping the corporate tax rate will increase the number of corporations that don't pay, increase our deficits and debt, and won't produce wage growth or jobs. (2/3)

@alwaysbaseball9 We've already discussed this. If the owner files the report, they're not negligent and they're being responsible. There are no storage reqs
@alwaysbaseball9 Not legislating storage requirements. It's requiring firearm owners to be accountable. Govt isn't in the home. Where does the buck stop?
@alwaysbaseball9 I'm sick and tired of kids showing up at school with a gun. It's not a minor child's responsibility. So, who is responsible?
@alwaysbaseball9 There has to be consequences for negligence when it comes to firearms. If you don't report, you're part of the crime.
@alwaysbaseball9 That's a concern. Getting shot with a stolen gun is also a concern. Both of these concerns can be dealt with. One can be mitigated.
@LauraFlowers @TheDemCoalition People vote for Party over Policy or Morals all the time. Mainly, because they believe policy and morals are in the Party they're voting for
@alwaysbaseball9 We don't have laws because violence doesn't happen. We have laws to protect people and to give law enforcement and the court system options
@alwaysbaseball9 It might be redundant, but it happens. Stiffer penalties on bulk purchasers will increase accountability. Only used when violence occurs.
@alwaysbaseball9 That's what I'm suggesting. Knowingly supplying a gun and negligently securing your firearm are two different things, but both dangerous
@alwaysbaseball9 ZERO criminalization of legal purchase of firearms in proposal. This creates civil &amp;/or criminal penalties when firearms used in violence.
@alwaysbaseball9 140 character policy is impossible. If reported stolen, of course not liable. Gun owners should be accountable if they're negligent.
@alwaysbaseball9 Enforce current law, increase civil/criminal penalties on owners that have firearms used in violence. Higher penalties for bulk purchasers.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP There are quite a few people on the far left that don't care for my common ground positions. I'm straightforward. That's what people deserve

@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP We may not see eye to eye on everything, but I will always listen, always keep an open mind, and can find common ground nearly everywhere.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP We're on the same page. Many lawmakers don't understand on a guttural level how their decisions impact the lives of families and individuals
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP These counterproductive decisions don't even make sense. They hurt veterans who have served, damage their bottom-lines, and hurt communities
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP With jobs &amp; wages, there's more resources leading to clinics, hospitals. Better education pipelines lead to better doctors, nurses, support
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP I agree completely. There is a real issue with the pipeline of quality doctors and support staff, in the VA and across rural America.

@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP I want to bring those opportunities to the 15th. We've not had someone fighting for jobs and wages here in decades. Time for a Change
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP These issues are life and death. Whenever bureaucrats talk about cuts in services, people often get lost in the shuffle. Details matter
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP We need more administrative law judges to work through backlogs. We need more resources for veterans in rural areas. You deserve choices
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP I'm with you there, Adam. We have to do better. Much better. The backlog in disability claims leads to death, let alone higher costs.
@TimBorchardt @GOP @BillClinton Oh, I get it. We were on our way to paying off our debt in the 90s. The GOP ended balanced budgets with tax cuts, wars, and runaway spending
@TimBorchardt @GOP @BillClinton The revenues vs expenses were balanced prior to the Bush Tax Cuts. What part of that equation don't you understand?
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP You're acting as if you do. Your profile says you have the finest opinion. It's life &amp; death for people in my district. I'll fight for them.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP You fell right into it. Called it a drop in the bucket, but now you split hairs. Funny how cavalier you are about people's healthcare.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP A cut to Medicare is a cut in Medicare. We should allow the govt to negotiate $$$ for Prescription Drugs. Not with the GOP.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP You don't know what's going on in DC or the 15th, or you would have known. You say you have the finest opinion. Just not the best facts.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP I'd support Medicaid, Medicare instead of cutting &amp; gutting. No photo-ops. Cut taxes completely for low wage vets. You serve, you deserve.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP 450 BILLION is not so much a drop in the bucket, now is it?
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP It's a BILLION cut.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP They want to gut Medicaid. 15% of adults in the 15th get their healthcare through Medicaid. 36% of children receive it through Medicaid/CHIP
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP No, Medicare.
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus @GOP I'll tell you who it hurts. Seniors, veterans, children, the disabled, the chronically ill, and working families.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Working families can't afford it. In the 15th, wages have been stagnant, property taxes are too high, and most communities struggle
@alwaysbaseball9 @RepShimkus How does it help people? We increased defense spending. @GOP wants to gut Medicaid, cut Medicare by half a billion. Who does that hurt?
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP That's confirmation that you think lower income earners should pay more. I don't think they should to give the wealthiest a big tax cut.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Data, as anyone knows, can be manipulated. Saying the top pay 80% of the taxes, for instance. They own 90% of the wealth. It leaves that out
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Working families haven't had significant increases in anything but their bills in decades. They spend where they live. They deserve a break
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Yeah, that's just fabricated. Anyone who lives in reality knows the Middle Class aren't wealthy. They're losing every day
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Never said that. This is the art of the deal . . . just make stuff up that no one has ever said
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Many companies and the wealthiest pay an effective tax rate of 0 or minimal. That's not only not right, it's bankrupting the Middle Class.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Taxes on Congressional salary is about $60k. I'm fine with that. Congressional pay is too high for the number of days they actually work.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP The Tax Foundation's Board is comprised of exec's from Eli Lilly, lobbying and law firms, vineyards, Pepsi Co, and accounting firms. #Biased
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Because the large portion of the bottom 90% haven't had a pay increase in decades.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP And, the bottom 50% spend the vast majority of their earnings every year just to make ends meet. They can't afford to pay more.
@alwaysbaseball9 @afrazhaque @Anthony90069 @GOP Yeah, Of course they did. They hold 38% of the wealth, more than the bottom 90%, who also own 73% of the debt. Who gets the raises? the Top.
@TimBorchardt @GOP @BillClinton Tax cuts are to blame. The Bush tax cuts gutted the budget and sent our deficits through the roof.
@TimBorchardt @GOP @BillClinton No, not free stuff. Wars, and meds for seniors.
@TimBorchardt @GOP @BillClinton No. What happened was GOP-led Congress,GOP Pres. took balanced budget, cut taxes, didn’t fund two wars, didn’t fund Rx Medicare.
@TimBorchardt @GOP Under @BillClinton, we had balanced budget, were paying down debt. Under the GOP and W Bush, they cut taxes and exploded deficits and debt.
@TimBorchardt @GOP You just said it right there. We spend more than we take in . . . So, you support taking in LESS? Like I said, you’re not serious.
@TimBorchardt @Anthony90069 @GOP The debt exploded ➡️ unfunded Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Wars, the GOP created Great Recession, the Bush tax cuts, and no infrastructure plan.
@TimBorchardt @GOP You can’t be serious. Do you know how budgets and deficits work? Less revenue increases red ink. It’s simple business economics.

@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid You've not actually posted any actual evidence. Emails are correspondence. That always happens between campaigns, the DNC, and the media.
@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid What are the specific talking points?
@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid BTW, the daily wire is a conservatively biased news source. So, props for spreading conservative propaganda
@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid 5 hacked emails. Some were negative stories about Hillary Clinton. That anyone believes that the media was slanted for her is ludicrous.
@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid You're going to believe Assange &amp; Russia? You'll believe anything &amp; nothing. It just depends on what mental leaps are required. No principle
@Selendrile @bourgeoisalien @JoyAnnReid It's not proof of any of those things. It's literally an email wanting a letter Sanders sent to the DNC. You're making shit up.

May peace come to Charlottesville &amp; our nation find a way forward through these turbulent times. Violence is not the answer.

@_GreatBike_ @pixleyamelia @RepShimkus Oftentimes, the loudest voices don't represent the majority. The majority are too busy to be hostile and indignant on social media.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ Good luck with your attitude.
@_GreatBike_ @pixleyamelia Not sure how you jump to that conclusion. You're one of 750,000 in a district. A representative represents everyone. @RepShimkus doesn't.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ Yeah. How much taxes? Who pays what when and how? People are strapped the way it is in the 15th.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ I'm more focused on expanding Medicare, decreasing Rx costs, increasing protections against insurance deductibles and premiums.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ And, throughout the other 30 counties of the 15th? I have nothing against single payer. It failed in VT. How to pay for it? Plans matter.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ Many more than that over last 2 decades. I enjoy listening to voters, their concerns, learning about their lives. They have the answers.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus @DNC Where's proof of interference? You mean by specially selected Russian-hacked emails designed to divide the party? No Bernie emails released.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ National polling on any issue has about zero to do with a rural district race. Knock on 10,000 doors and get back to me on that one.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus @DNC There's a 100,000 vote deficit in 15th. Can't make that up by swinging far left. You answer the voters needs, what will improve their lives.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus @DNC Democrats have failed at messaging in rural areas for decades. Listening to the People would be a good start. Talking points are cheap.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus @DNC 2008 primary, Barack Obama played to win. He was in Indiana in February with offices. Bernie didn't play to win. He played to crowds.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus @DNC Bernie didn't have name recognition? It's a primary. Each had advantages and disadvantages. Winning is the goal, not complaining about it.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ I'm certainly not running a far left message that can't win in the 15th and can't pass Congress. Americans need immediate relief.
@pixleyamelia @_GreatBike_ I agree. She ran a horrible campaign. Didn't run in states she needed to win.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus Doesn't mean it wouldn't have helped people, but if the message isn't a winning message, you have to alter the message.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus The message you deliver door2door matters more than the $$ or who knocks on the door. Bernie's message didn't resonate with enough voters.
@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus They also didn't win the primary for him. He lost by 3.7 million votes. Money and rallies don't win elections, votes do.

@_GreatBike_ @DickDurbin @NaperGals @RepShimkus It must be connected to actions and with context. Some are connected to dirty $$$. The attacks on @HillaryClinton were conspiracy.
