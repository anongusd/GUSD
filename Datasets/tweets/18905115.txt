RT @marcorubio: Excited to have former Congressman @ZachWamp leading our efforts for #TeamMarcoTN. Join us at http://t.co/8lY08eWhXx
Please follow my strong son @westonwamp, who is running for Congress in TN-3. He is the kind of innovative, young leader we need more of!
As my son Weston said today, God spoke to us this morning with a White Christmas in the Tennessee Valley. Emmanuel, God is with us.
Please support Kerry Roberts for State Senate. Diane Black was strong and Kerry will serve our state well. Conservative from Biblical view !
Hamilton County doing very well. Claude Ramsey goes to Nash to help Gov Haslam. Judge Mike Carter is best choice to replace Ramsey as Mayor.
Claude Ramsey-great choice by Gov-elect Haslam. Set high standard. I will not pursue office of o Mayor. Returning to private sector Jan 3.
Reading the tea leaves, there is a good chance that taxes will go up for some job creators Jan 1 further chilling economic recovery.
I will be on Chris Matthews today at 530est talking about the new GOP majority, leadership races, the Class of 94 and more. Rusty but ready.
Congrats to John Elkington today. The Beale Street developer joins the "Walk of Fame". Tennessee loves Elk !!
Watch Tennessee fan David Keith in Lone Star Mon night at 9est on Fox.
The hundreds of Tennesseans who have written or called remind us that there are many things more important than politics. God bless you all.
No way I would have anymore love +support had we won. People are so wonderful. Life is good. God is great.
Thanks from the Wamp family. We were honored to be the choice of 209K Tennesseans for Governor.
Could not be more encouraged today. People of Tennessee are so good to my family. Peace in my heart.
Conservatives in Tenn must unite tomorrow. Ramsey+Wamp both meet test. Ramsey can't win. Please don't throw your vote away.
Wamp team will not be "flying around state" in corporate jets today. We will stay w/ the people on the ground in our used RV.
Giants have stepped in to help and speak truth into my life as I prepare to be Governor. We thank God for them.
What a day we have had !!  Momentum building all over Tennessee. We are so grateful the undecided are joining our winning team.
As a UT parent + big supporter of Univ of Tn, I believe Bruce Pearl has no business endorsing candidates for state office.
Tennessee republicans join the Wamp team this week to choose the best candidate for Governor, some things money just can't buy !
Big week for future of Tennessee. Vision,strength+results. Please vote Thursday for conservative choice Zach Wamp.
Ham Co-3 early voting sites, Knox-9 early voting sites. need to change that but Ham Co- get out+elect 1st Governor in 105 yrs from SE Tn-8/5
Just finished 4 days across Tn. Incredible response from hard working middle class people just trying to make it who want conservative Gov !
The arrogance of the rich and powerful will not be honored. We need humble leaders to follow Gods direction.
Have not seen this much late momentum in a campaign in many years. Thank you Tennessee GOP !!
Last day of early voting. Decision time in 5 days. Final verdict is weak+wrong vs right+strong. I stand strong on taxes,sovereignty+vision
Shelby Co really strong now ! Turnout high in our areas. Rural west strong. Haslam falling- ruthlessly negative. People want honest advertis
Great event 2nite at Henpeck w/ Jeff Allen,TG Sheppard,MW Smith,Two Foot Fred+120 good folk. Back 2 Shelby now. Full day as we win the west.
When talk gets "right" in a campaign, good things happen. We are now there. Thanks Tennesseans for your support !
Said"civility+right temperament",then runs most negative campaign. Mailers,radio,TV all total negative. Bill Haslam-biggest hypocrite in Tn
Our momentum has now triggered the most ruthless and ugly campaign mailings by the Haslams. Reject this nastiness.
Absurd how much Pilot Oil money Haslam is spending to blatantly mislead voters about my record. Don't let him buy this election w/ untruths.
Voted to fund our troops today. Back in E Tn ready to finish strong. Hal Hill show Wed morn. People can reject false advertising by Haslam !
Haslam and Ramsey now flatly and intentionally misleading people in their ads. We must be doing very well in early voting !!!
Stops in 7 Eden counties today. Sure seems like we are winning. Momentum is w/us.
Momentum equals intensity and turnout. Asking all supporters to turn it on for 10 days and we will win !!!

Amazed at how much support we have gained since the debate. Tonight in Sevier and Knox clear evidence folks don't want Haslams to buy it !
Just signed the discharge petition H.R. 4972 to repeal Healthcare bill on House floor.
To have two great Tennesseans like Jack Faris and Jim Bryson step out to endorse me means so much as free people choose their next Governor.
