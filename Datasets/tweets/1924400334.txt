Arpaio refused to comply with the judge's orders and was convicted of contempt of court. He was voted out of office in 2016 by the people of Maricopa County at the same time they voted for President Trump. An embarrassing end to an embarrassing career. 9/9
And of course in 2013, a federal judge (appointed by George W. Bush) found that Arpaio had violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by racially profiling Latino motorists and ordered him to stop.  https://t.co/H7hYF8HIhJ 8/9
Arpaio and his chief deputy pursued criminal investigations into his political enemies, his office misspent $99.5 million in taxpayer funds which it blamed on a "computer glitch", and his 2008 campaign violated campaign finance law. 	https://t.co/dPzHEvQznx 7/9
Despite his "tough on crime" reputation, Arpaio failed to investigate hundreds of sex crimes, many of which involved children. https://t.co/S8qWiGPAPK 6/9

@_SteveDavey_ @FritzCarltonSTL @jrosenbaum @achambersgop @anewmissouri @nick_ayers I support extending the revolving door law we already passed. Again, my focus is on redistricting. Show me how that part isn't a partisan scheme to get more Ds in the legislature. Show me how it won't create crazy shaped districts to make them competitive.
@_SteveDavey_ @FritzCarltonSTL @jrosenbaum @achambersgop @anewmissouri @nick_ayers Clean MO doesn't stop dark money. And it doesn't ban lobbyist gifts, it puts a ceiling of $5 per lobbyist "per occurrence". But those aren't my main objections, it's the redistricting scheme. That part is equally awful for rural and urban communities.

@classysportsfan @search4swag @mollyrosestl Go back &amp; look at what I was doing/saying on April 7, the day the #WalterScott video came out.
@mollyrosestl @kentuckyviews @tchopstl At the end of the day, I'm not denying it COULD be racism. But the article didn't make that case.
@mollyrosestl @kentuckyviews @tchopstl Wel Residents said they didn't need 6 officers for 700 ppl, so maybe they saw writing on the wall.
@kentuckyviews @mollyrosestl @tchopstl Also not surprising that when incumbent loses, city workers would quit instead of being fired.
@kentuckyviews @mollyrosestl @tchopstl What if some of the cops who quit were black? Sounded like the dept was just too big for a tiny town.
@mollyrosestl @tchopstl Why assume racism? Article doesn't give race of officers or motive. Mayor's win itself complicates that narrative.
