Cuomo on using executive power: 'I run the government' http://t.co/NAP5OqEPOL
@LisaMaret and by the way, thank you for reading the story. It is appreciated.
@LisaMaret certainly we are watching the filings, tho he is (as he's said himself)a special case b/c of his wealth and self-funded campaign.
@LisaMaret many things about the candidate are notable; being able to borrow that much money is simply one of them.
@LisaMaret disclosure of debt is required along with that of assets. We reported both sides of the ledger. Standard practice.

.@77WABCradio caller Jose tells @CurtisSliwa that @MMViverito is reacting to #Papigate this way because she secretly wants him. Hoo, boy.
.@77WABCradio caller says he called a woman "mamita" and she hung up on him; after he "kept stalking" her, they married &amp; he's her "papi."
.@CurtisSliwa says he's going to call @LorraineCortesV in DC about her saying he's sexist and racist in #Papigate
.@CurtisSliwa on @NYDailyNews front re #Papigate: He gets criticism from @chriscquinn. Doesn't get attack from @LorraineCortesV
.@CurtisSliwa back to talking about his "impotency." Also part of a product endorsement on @77WABCradio
"Smart, successful, powerful women" @CurtisSliwa notes he has loved: Exes @LisaEvers, @MelindaKatz, and his rarely mentioned first wife
Ron Kuby to Curtis Sliwa: "There's no demonstrations against us, yet." Sliwa: I love smart, successful powerful women.
.@CurtisSliwa says when he saw @MMViverito in red, he thought, "She's hot to trot." This seems to be spiraling.
