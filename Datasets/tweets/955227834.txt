@ted__logan @WWO2005 I'm not here to be original. Sorry if slavery is inconvenient for you.
@ted__logan @WWO2005 Well strictly speaking you said post cold war, which would include today and the Obama presidency, but Reagan. 		If you want to switch it to include leading up to the end if the cold war okay.
@ted__logan @WWO2005 Who was president during ww2?
@ted__logan @WWO2005 It's obvious that slavery is pretty not great true.
@WWO2005 @ted__logan Okay so slavery was great?  That's the era you want to return to?		So you differ with Ted on this. 		He doesn't think America was great until the Berlin wall fell.
@WWO2005 @ted__logan Okay. Maybe, but Ted is "educating" me about "when America was great", but it turns out he doesn't know when the cold war ended.		So 80's/90's now? That's when America was great?

@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 @HuffPostImpact What exactly did I twist?		You said race is a factor in things like behavior and intelligence.		That's racist. That idea is what racism is. Period.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 @HuffPostImpact You did strongly assert that African Americans are inferior when you confirmed that your claim was that they have an innate propensity for crime.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 You're so ignorant of what racism even is that you've made claims that could be used to argue for profiling and even eugenics in defense of your "non-racist" outlook.		Seriously. Wake up.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 @HuffPostImpact Yes, I do believe that attributing things to people and making assumptions about them based on race rather than individual merit is precisely a text book definition of racism.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 Dude you need to stop kidding yourself.		If every race in this country was held to the same standard and had the same opportunities there wouldn't be a problem.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 @HuffPostImpact Oh I saw it.  It's the one where you confess to being a racist.		And in your off time you're on here working to maintain the status quo of racial prejudice and inequality in America.		How admirable!		https://t.co/VVZnC9pKUR
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 Oh okay gotcha.		So you don't believe in racial equality.		You believe certain races are innately superior and inferior to others in certain ways.		Well, I think we've arrived at the crux of issue.

Am I correct in concluding that you claim is that a propensity for crime is an inherently African American characteristic?		If not please explain.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 @HuffPostImpact Very open minded of you.
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 If the criminal justice system is fair and racially unbiased than what explains the disproportionate number of African Americans criminally convicted and incarcerated?
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 White privilege is just the flip side of non white racism.  It doesn't mean you get a new car or anything.		You say you're "open-minded".

@Squall1322 @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 Great.  Thank you for acknowledging that people who rightfully protest racism against themselves and others are patriots with a completely legitimate cause and that it is facile and out of sync with our values for you to tell them to leave for exercising their freedom of speech.
@Squall1322 @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 Racism exists in America.		The country was founded on the right to dissent.		Freedom of speech is one of our most dearly held principles.		Critique is done out of love of the country and the duty to make it its best, fairest and most free.		I am the USA. I'm not leaving.
@ted__logan @RISE_UPsoccer @WWO2005 @MichaelScottQue @Squall1322 @charliekirk11 The only one? 		When was that?
@Squall1322 @MichaelScottQue @RISE_UPsoccer @charliekirk11 Just because you are uncomfortable discussing racism doeant mean it shuts down debates or that it doesn't exist. 		No one is stirring race into anything. This isn't a fucking cooking class.		It is your white privelege to be oblivious of racism.

@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I understand and I think that's terrible.  Do you not reciprocate my sentiment to me?		I really hope that someone fixes our healthcare system and makes it the best it can be, but in what tangible way has Trump done that?		How has your situation changed?
@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump My mother is also 72. 		It's very important to me that you and your family have access to good healthcare and never have to suffer or die from a treatable ailment you can't afford to treat.

@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump What have we tried for 20 years?
@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So we agree that the best solution makes healthcare accessible to your family, mine and the millions of Americans who face a scenario like the one I described?

@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Do you have those things now?		We can agree that what we want is the best system for our country right?
@JamesBi29008186 @Cleo_LaPeter @Luke59068981 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Maybe you're right that government shouldn't be involved, but what you said doesn't explain how it is better.		In what tangible way is it better?		Please address my second question.

@marcorubio The Senator, partially through implications, seems to come to the rescue of the administration's human rights abuses of the undocumented by suggesting that the only alternative is the absurdly permissive policy of granting amnesty to all undocumented people with children. Untrue!
@marcorubio Let's better understand the type of rhetorical cheating the Senator is engaging in.		Fallacies are errors in reasoning that can be very effective at undermining the logic of an opponent's argument, if you don't get caught.		What we have here is the False Dilemma Fallacy

@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 If Trump says he hates the separations and wants them stopped though, why do you defend it?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 And me too!  I want those things.  Of course
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 The tent cities are costing $775 dollars per night per persons.		We can't afford this problem ethically or monetarily.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I'm still not advocating for charity.		I mean can you imagine how much these facilities were housing these kids in separately in are costing?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I'm not opposed to law enforcement and my argument has not been for allowing people amnesty.		I want us to keep the families whole so the kids experience as little trauma as possible while their here, and nobody gets sent home without their kid.		That's it.  Reasonable.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I agree they should.		But can you see how from my perspective I don't want America to flirt with human rights abuse.		I want us to deal with this issue in an effective way that doesn't buck our principles.  That's all.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Those countries don't have human rights problems?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Trump doesn't support the separations right?  He ended that today through executive order.		How do you feel about that?

@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Those are countries with rampant human rights problems.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 What if I told you maybe the welfare system is too generous, would you be less skeptical of my appeal to human rights.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 So we shouldn't continue to champion human rights?  You lost me there.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I'm regular person weeg.		You think I am not regular or that I want you to be abused?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I'm much more okay with a wall than I am human rights abuse weeg.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 You mean the illegals that were deported?		You mean like a country where they don't have respect for human rights?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Red or Blue, most Americans are fairly moderate.		We need to be more trustful of each over and more skeptical of the cartoon cut-out cliches were encouraged to perceive each other as.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I think that we can ethically accommodate the special circumstances immigrants in transit face that are currently causing so many of their children to end up alone in state custody and still control our borders and address our other domestic problems.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I agree with you.	But it's not required or cost saving to separate the kids.	If even 1 toddler can be spared an experience from which it might come away with psychological symptoms similar to abused kids shouldn't we spare that toddler that?	Still hold the families, Still deport.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 You're totally right that we should enforce the laws and that people should respect them!		The constitution though is the highest law in the land and human rights are central to it.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 For everyone Weeg.		Human rights are what define our constitutional freedoms.		We led the world in championing them and they are the pride of our nation.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Weeg, people like you and me need to do a lot more talking and a lot more trying to trust each others motives here.  		I don't have insidious motives. Promise.		I'm not advocating for amnesty, just that no one be exempt from human rights.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Sure weeg.  Something like that might work.		That's very different than what you were defending before.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Weeg, it's not a double standard, it's being cognoscente of the fact that the same techniques don't produce the same results in different scenarios.		Families in transit have no where for the kids to go, so a massive percentage of them end up wards of state, even infants.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 What if it costs more to separate the families than detain them together in family detention centers?  Do you still want to do it?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 It's patriotic to have reverence for the values that define our country and make it great.		Championing human rights is what makes the US, the US.		It's the backbone of our society.		It's what makes it great.  I'm not advocating for amnesty, only human rights.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 No.  That's what I'm suggesting at all.		Is it really one or the other?  Do we really only have two choices, either to take their children or to let them go?
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 2.7 million is the number of kids in America who have an incarcerated parent, and 2% percent is the number of them that must be wards of the state because they can't be placed with family.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 It'd actually be more like 48K.  		Due to their parents being incarcerated. Yup.
@weeglmanz It's really too bad that isn't true.		The whole problem that we're having is that a huge percentage of them are ending up in state care, even toddlers.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 I don't think they should be exempt.		I think their unique situation should be accommodated so as not to create a human rights problem.		Human rights are a pillar of American society and central to our constitution.
@weeglmanz It's not true.  Only 2 percent of people incarcerated in America require state custody for child care.  The children are with the other parent for the most part or grandparents and aunts and uncles?		https://t.co/frI6tS1nha
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 In Florida a type 2 misdemeanor comes with a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail, but the majority of people without priors are getting a fine and maybe some probation.		If they can post bail the max they're away from family is overnight.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 You want honesty and common sense right?		She says the consequence is the same for trespass and unauthorized entry, but they're not.		The children of trespassers will almost never spend time in state custody, and frankly usually nether will the parent.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 it's 2 percent of 2.7 million.  That's how may kids have parents that are incarcerated.

@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 She is entirely right that it is a similar offense, but completely wrong that it has the same consequences for families, and we're talking before these people are even convicted of anything too.
@weeglmanz @MamaReg2 Her arguments only appears true due to a misleading omission of facts.		2% of incarcerated parents in US depend on state custody or foster care for their children.		Trespassers almost never, if ever, have children in state custody for 60+ days, and are never deported w/out them.
We must always be vigilant and self critical of our motivations		The rhythms and habits of thinking produced by hundreds of years of hatred and persecution are still pummeled throughout our psyches.		Simply wishing to act without prejudice is not enough	https://t.co/Q3Urkr1xyb

@MamaReg2 Racists are endorsing and celebrating it though, so that's got to make you wonder.		https://t.co/Xno7nRNEC0
@dmaxter1200 @MamaReg2 @Logic_Pls @hrtablaze Why do you continue to deflect by asking me to be a mouth piece for these people and explain their decisions to you/!		I don't know, and I don't need to know that to know what's happening at the border is a violation of their Human Rights and our precious American principles!
@MamaReg2 How DHS &amp; HHS do their job is matter of public interest to all Americans 		We have a right to be outraged and make ourselves heard when their action contradict our morals		You stop publicizing a false narrative about what going on here and let me exercise my damn 1st amnd. rights
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 It’s actually quite vile and insidious.		So there you have it.  I hope it was worth the wait! It’s been my pleasure to clear that situation up for you and I’m glad you asked!
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 and to leverage the pain and suffering of immigrant families in order to bend the will of democrats in congress and the American citizens they represent by forcing them to cry uncle and comply with immigration reform measures they don’t agree with.	https://t.co/P16ZSKbMyM
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 When we are insensitive to these important differences we create a humanitarian crisis like the one we have now.		What’s worse is that at this time we’re doing so deliberately in order to try to deter future immigrants
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 We know how to accommodate these circumstances already and have previously made use of family detention centers where whole family units can be housed intact awaiting a hearing and either deported or granted asylum as a unit.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 So even though unauthorized entry and trespassing are considered similar offenses by the law, the consequences for children and families are completely different due to the unique circumstances faced by immigrant families in transit that are not shared by most US Citizens.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Even if they get the book thrown at them and serve time, the parent and child will have the privilege of knowing where each other are the whole time and the right to phone calls and visitations.  Most children will be comfy at home with their families during this time
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 In the majority of misdemeanor cases, the least serious category of criminal charges (unauthorized entry too), the arrested parent will be eligible to await their court hearing out on bail and will only be away from the family overnight or for a couple of days at the most.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 If any of those things were happening it would certainly constitute a crisis that would get the attention of the national media and which we would be remiss in our moral obligations not to address.		But that’s not where the differences end!
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Parents arrested for trespassing are never given a sheet with an ICE tip-line number on it instead of a real one to find their child, and no one is ever forcibly deported to another country while their child remains in the US in state custody.	https://t.co/6CM2DGOUng
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 This is further evidenced by the fact that we are not forced to construct a vast infrastructure in which to detain the children of millions of inmates for the duration of their sentence or until the children are 18.	https://t.co/kQfmy8hEJM
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 https://t.co/frI6tS1nha	https://t.co/lDtG2kzffF https://t.co/ariyx3o23M
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 It is only in rare instances that the children end up in state custody long term, which is evidenced by the fact that only 2% of incarcerated fathers and 11% of mothers (women are 6.9% of inmates) in America are forced to make use of state custody for child care.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 And when they are accompanied by children, the vast majority of the time the child’s going to be promptly return to the family, either the other parent, grandparents or aunts and uncles, and will spend a minimum of time with any agency.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 First of all, by being at home rather than in transit potentially a 1000 miles from home, US citizens arrested for trespassing won’t necessarily be accompanied by their children, so in that case children never have contact with law enforcement.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Due to a special set of circumstances faced by migrants in transit that most US citizens don’t face, and the mandates of the AG’s Zero Tolerance Policy, arrests of parents for Unauthorized Entry and arrests for Trespassing have very different consequences for families
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 I completely agree that unauthorized entry and trespassing are similar offenses and that they SHOULD have similar outcomes, but the fact is that they don’t, and that’s really the crux of the problem.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 So your claim is that US citizens trespassing are treated the same way that unauthorized entrants are and that I am a hypocrite for believing one is a human rights disaster and not the other?		Okay, so let’s take a closer look at that claim! First of 17		https://t.co/sPfTfZeHpG

@OregonBroker @ChuckCallesto Have you had a change of heart?		Because in your previous tweets you've furnished anecdotes meant to excuse and explain away criticism of indiscriminately separating children and families of unauthorized entrants at the our border
@dmaxter1200 @MamaReg2 @Logic_Pls @hrtablaze 2. Then you suggest that the US government is justified in wide-scale and indiscriminate separation of children and families at the boarder based on the possibility that the children might be trafficked without any burden of proof before doing so.

@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 @LearnLiberty But if that's not good enough for ya, just go back to the constitution. It's forbidden there in by those people's human rights, because the founding fathers knew about integrity even if you don't.
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 @LearnLiberty No one is responsible for our actions but ourselves.	How much integrity one has is determined by how often they make the moral choice.	A person of high integrity always makes the moral choice and would never blame another person for their own immoral action.
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 @LearnLiberty As for your claim that concern about someone stealing our stuff gives us a free pass to treat them immorally by violating their human rights, well that's not something I ever thought I'd hear another well intentioned american say, and I don't think I have now.
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 But don't take my word for it!		I think you should google it and take some time to really educate yourself anout it.		But If you're having trouble getting started you can look right here ⬇️		The Constitutional Rights of Noncitizens https://t.co/tcuSAR4OUX via @LearnLiberty
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 Well anyway, If that is your argument it's a pretty easy one to dismiss! Aliens, illegal and otherwise, are protected by the US Constitution, and especially where human rights are concerned they have all the same rights as a US citizen		It's well known and easily verifiable fact!
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 I'm trying to understand your premise. 	Here's what I think you're saying, 		"Aliens aren't protected by the US constitution and therefore it's okay to violate their human rights, and it's totally okay and humane because they want to take our stuff."		Is that it?
@JBurtonXP So what's you point?  Is it that now you guys are no different than the liberals you criticize for being morally bankrupt hypocrites?		I totally agree.  That is what this means.
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 It actually would be more grammatically correct to say that constitutional rights represent the values that are fundamental and sacrosanct to America, and you'll find human rights certainly are central to the constitution.
@Impossibilus @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 Are they?	https://t.co/3y8h68UyVK
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The former First Lady disagrees with you.		https://t.co/3y8h68UyVK
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I'm beginning to think you just want to see these people and their children terrorized to send a message to others, no matter what, wrong or right.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino No! You know what I'm suggesting.  I've explained it at length.  Let's not go around in circles.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Robert this is just a rehash of a question I've previously addressed.		I think we've come up with some very good, ethical solutions to this problem that accomplish the same goal.		Why are you so committed to this terribly policy?		Why is this your cause?
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The history of our country is all about the perfection of the law and there have been many terrible ones!	Prohibition was once the law of the land not just of alcohol but voting for women and Afro-Americans too	Jim Crow as a whole bunch of laws	Gulf Of Tonkin Resolution was a law
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino If the mere existence of a law justified its immoral outcome than there would be no changes to existing law, no supreme court rulings, no amendments, and probably very few new laws
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Robert the whole reason we live in a republic with a congress and a supreme court is so that the law can continue to evolve and be ever more perfected with our input to address the country's needs while upholding our morals and values.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I am totally sympathetic to and mostly in agreement with this statement	so long as those consequences don't betray some of our most deeply held principles as Americans such as championing fairness, ethics and human rights.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino If you're advocating for a law such as that you could accomplish the same goal, and you wouldn't have to be on here taking up the cause of persecuting families and traumatizing children.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino That may or may not really be the case, but if it is, it sounds like something that could be addressed by a law.		That law sounds like something worthy of advocating for that would get the job done without resulting in human rights abuses.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Robert from talking to you it seems pretty clear that you know that it is a human rights abuse or it wouldn't trouble you so much		You're a good person and you really really want for it not to be, but you know that it is		You'll probably never admit it to me, but you know.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino So Robert, if tomorrow someone cuts you off in traffic and when you pull up to them at the next light you get out of your car and beat the pulp out of them, will you blame your inappropriately sever and immoral response on the other driver.		After all he was driving recklessly.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The tweet below is moot because it entertains an hypothetical situation that is no longer possible to act out.		And I'm still not advocating for allowing them to say, just treating them ethically in our custody.		https://t.co/ylVDg5VcOa
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino It's not like our jails aren't already overcrowded.  The parents still take up space there.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Again with the straw man argument!		I like it because it solves the humanitarian problem!		We're already going to have to build facilities to house the kids separately, even improvised tent cities.		That same infrastructure could be used to house the families intact.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino However in spite of being moot it does betray your willingness to see aliens face cruel and unusual consequences for their offenses.		Which would explain why you don't consider traumatizing little children on a mass scale a Human Rights abuse.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Robert that's a moot point.  They're here.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I think you're a good person and that there is a part of you that it is just as imperative for you to convince as it is me.		I'm not going to get sucked into a debate about the eligibility of abjectly poor Mexican people for the naturalization process.		Google that if you want.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Oh really? Wah? Robert! Come now.  The children are also being punished in that scenario.  		Are you a father? Do you have children?		How about we compromise and  detain all them in the family detention centers until they can have a hearing?
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Well that certainly sounds cruel and unusual.  They should definitely be allowed to go home.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 That might work if you're Danish.	How do citizens of high immigration countries like Mexico accomplish that?		Also you've officially used a straw-man argument to misrepresent my claims and change to a different topic		I don't think they should be allowed to stay.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Also, I'm not advocating that they be allowed to stay.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Now you're attacking a claim I never made.  	It's not immoral to enforce our borders or our immigration laws.
@Ronald05891320 Other people are responsible for how we treat these people now? Again?		Why is this the sword you wanna fall on anyway?		Why is this your cause?		We can apprehend and deport them without separating the families by going through immigration court.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 1. Needlessly causing children to be harmed on a large scale constitutes a human rights abuse no matter what you say.		2.  Describe to me the process by which "they do it legally and reap the rewards."
@Ronald05891320 Yes!  It's very important!		It doesn't require 100% of unauthorized entrant families to be split up.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Again with the straw-man argument, attributing claims to me that I didn't even make.		I never said we should allow them to stay.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 I haven't deviated from the topic at all.  You're deflecting by bringing up legal immigration, which is a moot point since they're already here and most were never eligible to come legally.		None of that changes our moral obligation not to traumatize innocent children.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino You're so concerned with the "criminality" of people who are either seeking asylum or committing a misdemeanor in order to flee destitution and seek a better life for their family.  Yet the deeply traumatizing and unnecessary act of separating families doesn't bother you at all
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I already told you that legally we can process the vast majority of them through immigration court and achieve the same outcome, deportation, without having to separate the families.
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 You're so concerned with the "criminality" of people who are either seeking asylum or committing a misdemeanor in order to flee destitution and seek a better life for their family.  Yet the deeply traumatizing and unnecessary act of separating families doesn't bother you at all
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 So in this tweet you concede that a terrible thing is happening on a large scale to innocent children, a humanitarian crisis, but you blame the parents.		Are you in the habit of blaming other people for terrible things that you do or endorse?
@miknotroh @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Alright.  Sorry.  You're question seemed like one of those leading, straw man argument type questions attacking me for a claim I didn't make.		Let's be civil.  I'm into that.		What does your friend say?
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino You say I don't have argument, but I do.  Immoral consequences of our policies are our obligation to address.		The center piece of your argument is blaming others for capriciously cruel things you do or endorse, which is not something I think one should make a habit of out of.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Prosecuting 100% of them criminally, which requires family separation, when for the vast majority of them it has the same consequence as processing them through immigration court, deportation, is unnecessary and since it also creates a humanitarian crisis, immoral.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Keeping the family intact in the family detention centers that already exist and processing them through immigration court which has the same result as prosecuting them criminally, deportation, isn't good enough for you?
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Furthermore soon they Walmarts will be overrun and many children will be in improvised tent cities that don't require any of the kind of professional you mentioned.	how much more of this is in our future?	https://t.co/wbhmru3Il3
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Of course not!  They need to be kept with their parents.		No amount of niceties, not even video games and a bedroll with a space blanket in a cage heals the trauma of being taken from the parents especially for the very young children.
@Logic_Pls @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 That's still not what I said.		I'm going to help you with!		the important detail here is the humanitarian crisis part 😉
@miknotroh @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 I'm not.		Are you curious about how people legally immigrate here from Mexico and other high volume immigration countries?		I think you should look into and get back to me 😉
@Logic_Pls @hrtablaze @MamaReg2 Showed me the old Wal-Marts filed with the children of inmates.
@Logic_Pls @MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 Sir or madam! You're attributing claims to me that I did not make.  Please read my tweet again.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino You're use of quotes around the words Human Rights is troubling Robert.	Have we arrived at the crux of the issue?  	Does their alien status make them less human in your mind?		Is that why you believe our right to prosecute them supersedes our obligation to do so morally?
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The same result can be had through the immigration courts, and the families are housed intact in family detention centers until their hearings.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The prosecutions are bogus Robert.  The people are charged with misdemeanor unauthorized entry, plead guilty, are sentenced to time served and deported.		It's a technicality done for the sole purpose of separating the families.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Furthermore, no amount niceties like video games and a bedroll with a space blanket in a cage heal the trauma caused by separation from the family especially for the very young kids.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino The fact is that you're not really that sure about the conditions in which they're being kept.  That's a matter that a lot people are curious about including US Senators.		How much more of this kind of thing is in our future?		https://t.co/wbhmru3Il3
@dpace30 Yeah you're just a child.  I might talk to you when you grow up.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Oh here we go again.  They're responsible for our immoral behavior.  		All I hear are excuses Robert.  It sounds like you're trying really hard to justify this to me and yourself.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Maybe you're just a tyranical despotism kind of guy.  To each his own, but it didn't work out too well for Draco and has a pretty bad track record historically.		Here in America where Humans Rights are one of our most cherished principles, it's just incongruent with our values
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I think it's pretty cowardly and of very low integrity to insist the parents are to blame for our immoral actions.		We always have the ability to make a moral choice no matter what the circumstances are, and people of high integrity always do because that is what integrity is.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Also the reference to driving specifically isn't important.  It's an analogy meant to illustrate the immoral and inappropriate severity of the consequence.
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino Were the pilgrims selfish when they risked their children's safety to escape persecution and seek for a better life in a foreign land?
@HRMRobertBruce @dbongino I guess if we made the consequence for speeding having your children taken, you'd have zero chance of having them taken by not speeding.		Still wouldn't make it right though.		Nope, Immoral Draconian Cruelty doesn't seem that rational to me.
@realDonaldTrump Under current law are illegal immigrants eligible for Welfare?
@MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 Human rights are a fundamental, sacrosanct American value, which means that the abuse of the collection of laws that amount to our immigration policy by the Trump administration to produce this humanitarian crisis is not just immoral, it's unAmerican.
@MarkHainzl @hrtablaze @7tt_Kathy @MamaReg2 It's of very little integrity to make excuses for the immoral outcome of bad policy.		We live in a republic where we have the privilege of participating in the process of ever perfecting our laws and it is our responsibility to ensure that those laws reflect our morals and values
@TomMcGowan777 @hrtablaze @CaliDeplorable @MamaReg2 People have been protesting this issue for a long time.  It was wrong then, it's wrong now.		If Trump really hates taking the children then he should direct the AG to stop his zero tolerance policy that expands this practice to 100% undocumented immigrants.
@hrtablaze @MamaReg2 No!  Making a bunch of condescending faces does not amount to destruction.		Making excuses for immoral behavior however does destroy ones integrity.		This is cruel and unusual.  It's totally unnecessary to separate them and outrageous to do it as deterrent. 		It's indefensible!
It’s Illegal to Block Asylum Seekers From U.S. Ports of Entry. Border Ag... https://t.co/GjARPrz6AS via @YouTube
@Ronald05891320 Sir!  With all due respect!		It is as at least as important to me as it is to you that our border security keep us safe from violent criminals and terrorists.		Separating children and families however, is an immoral human rights abuse that does nothing to further that goal.
@Ronald05891320 I oppose the human rights abuses at our border.  You should too.  		The families should be kept intake.	Cruelty is neither an acceptable punishment nor deterrent.	It's immoral and UnAmerican.

@maggieb84505956 @jmert_58 @DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN The kids are states away sometimes too.  Parents in Texas, Kid in California, both in state custody at detention centers where they could be housed intact were it not for the stipulations of the law Trump is having everyone including asylum seekers prosecuted in order to abuse.
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @WattersWorld Speaking of integrity.  Advocating for something immoral and then making an excuse for it is of very little integrity.		Perhaps none.
@jmert_58 @DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN It's true that the kids must be handed over to Health and Human Services within two days.		Most do not end up in foster care or with relatives.  That's not factual.		I'm sure you're a good person, maybe this is wishful thinking.		Why must they be separated at all?
@DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @jmert_58 @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN Previously most people were processed by the immigration courts which allowed families to stay intact while a decision is reached whether to deport them.

@jmert_58 @DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN Keeping the family intact allows for the families to be detained until awaiting a decision whether they'll be deported without creating a humanitarian crisis.
@jmert_58 @DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN Unlike the kids in this scenario, the immigrant kids aren't likely to be picked up by grandma, and they have to have a hearing just like their parents.	until recently it was policy to keep families intact.

@DavidFrost95 @LLacrimae @jmert_58 @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN Respectfully David, I am sympathetic to your concerns.

@SecretRage1 @fate5675309 @mitchellvii I would just like to see us take greater interest in understanding each other in the US, to be less skeptical of our opposition's intentions and more ready to try and at least understand why people differ with us rather than see them as cartoony, dehumanized villians.
@SecretRage1 @fate5675309 @mitchellvii That's admirable. I admire your commitment to arriving at your own position based on research.		Truly.		I apologize for my initial rudeness.

@jmert_58 @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @DavidFrost95 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN This is really childish. 		It was wrong under Obama too.  That's irrefutable.		Whether or not it's more wrong under Trump since it's been expanded so greatly is debatable and likely.		What's most important right now though is that we stop it immediately.
@JackJones2855 @mik67966277 @jmert_58 @maggieb84505956 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @DavidFrost95 @FoxNews @johnlegend @CNN Ah yes! A human rights disaster on our border is just what we need to make America great.
@jmert_58 @Vinnie1715 @beelzeebub666 @DavidFrost95 @FoxNews @johnlegend The law that allows for it existed.		Its visibility has increased drastically because the Trump administration has directed the DOJ to reinterpret the law in order to greatly expand its application.		What's most important now is that we stop it ASAP, because it's immoral.
@PaulRickpaul2 @FoxNews @johnlegend People of high integrity don't make excuses for immoral behavior.		We always have the ability to make the moral choice and people of high integrity always do, because that's what integrity is.

@johngehres The Bible condemns mistreatment of others and specifically immigrants.  		It does not leave a shred of doubt that human rights are sacrosanct in the christian religion.
@johngehres Like the AG said the Bible teaches respect for the law, but it also teaches that God is love and that to abide in love is to abide in God.  It instructs us to speak for the unheard and defend the rights of the destitute.
@johngehres The number of Americans without health insurance has increased by over 3 million since Trump took office.
@johngehres Furthermore the trump tax overhaul is projected to devastated charities by disincentivizing donations from individuals.
@johngehres Trump's first budget proposal as president called for 2.2 billion in cuts to global health.		His proposal for 2019 allocates 2.5 billion less for humanitarian aid than was spent in 2017 at a time when the U.N. projects humanitarian need will rise by 5%.
@johngehres Under current law, the CBO projects a deficit of over a trillion dollars per year for all years Trump is president and beyond.	There is actually less to give, and the Trump administration is not charitable.
@johngehres "Strong" conservative leadership does not guarantee more to give.	During his presidency Obama transformed our economy from famine to feast and brought about the most bullish market in our country's history while reducing the annual deficit from 1.2 trillion to 438 billion.
@SenateMajLdr @SteveScalise We must address the human rights abuses at our border! https://t.co/AhEZuPqty2
@SenThomTillis This is great work Senator! Please help us address human rights abuses right here at home. https://t.co/1ZVCPrQZqM
@SenJohnKennedy Human rights are being violated by trump administration.		https://t.co/teHAOlulYF
@SenHydeSmith @amerambassoc Can't allow human rights abuses on our border!	https://t.co/SQ1gJtulUS
@SenJohnHoeven This is a human rights crisis.	https://t.co/Vu0SFYiQCT

@JuddLegum @SenSasse Yeah @SenSasse ! Get on board with this bill.  Families are suffering at the hands of the US government! We need you!
@JuddLegum I've already been bugging @marcorubio about this. 		But hey! Let's do it some more!		Yo @marcorubio and @SenBillNelson too, just in case, do this Feinstein bill to end the separation of  immigrant families.		It's your moral obligation.
@johngehres Are they going to convince me that Jesus was a nationalist, or that he would support our brutal policy of separating families at the border?
@JacobAWohl @fromsuncity That's a dishonest headline.  Those figures are from Michelle Wolf's show
@johngehres Are you hoping some of your followers will verbally abuse me for believing you're hypocrite?
@fromsuncity You feel heard now? Did you get out some of that frustration?		Really, I hope so.		Seriously, bless you.  I hope that you find joy and peace.
@fromsuncity @johngehres @Livibassy @Stump_for_USA @USAloveGOD @JohnJamesMI @SandyPensler @realDonaldTrump Oh ouch!  		That's an irrelevent ad hominem attack.		Try again.😘
@johngehres I stand by what I said. Donald Trump nor his policies are Christian.
@AndrewWuest @JackPosobiec Pizzagate is real bro!
@southside2 @RepRooney @AnaCabrera The inhumane treatment of those people is unconstitutional and unChristian. 		The president is wrong.
@701SKUHLsoyoAKQ @JackPosobiec You're funny.
@candemountain @JackPosobiec Glad you agree what's happening at our border is wrong.
@charliemenghett @JackPosobiec So you apose our policies at the border then I assume.		Which is good. We all should.
@JackPosobiec So uou're also against immoral behaviour at the border then. 		Good.		We all should be.
@SecretRage1 @fate5675309 @mitchellvii I don't doubt you believe them whole heartedly. I just dont think people form credible opinions when they refuse to try and understand or even hear their opposition.
@Cassiel_Angelos @lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Ooooh so you're cool with treating these people inhumanely as a deterrent?		Is that what you're trying to say.		You want it to be like "don't mess with the USA Mexicans, we'll take your children!!"		Well anyway, that would be unconstitutional and evil.
@johngehres @Livibassy @Stump_for_USA @USAloveGOD @JohnJamesMI @SandyPensler @realDonaldTrump My opinion is that he's making a fool and hypocrite out of you because his actions both in policy making and his personal life are immoral and unchristian.
@Joshua_Roberts_ @Stump_for_USA @Stump_for_Trump @JohnJamesMI @SandyPensler @realDonaldTrump Tell them to support @SenFeinstein 's Legislation to Halt Separation of Immigrant Families!		That'll get it done.		Thanks!		https://t.co/TeE9bjGvh1
@Joshua_Roberts_ @Stump_for_USA @Stump_for_Trump @JohnJamesMI @SandyPensler @realDonaldTrump Looks like we've got a really excited conversation ahead of us. I promise to make time to address all your concerns.  		I can't talk now, but in the mean time please take a minute to call your Senators and tell them to help the president end the human rights crisis at our border

You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.”

@THE_TRUE_GOP @MJH67516909 @fucknamesyo @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats If you really don't agree with it and want to see it stopped, you can call both your US Senators today and ask them to support Senator Feinstein's Legislation to Halt Separation of Immigrant Families.		https://t.co/TeE9bjGvh1
@THE_TRUE_GOP @MJH67516909 @fucknamesyo @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats It is not illegal to seek asylum.		It is not immoral for people in violent and destitute circumstances to seek a better life for themselves and their families.		The Pilgrims did it and their journey was DANGEROUS!		Finally, even if it was immoral, that doesn't justify cruelty.
@THE_TRUE_GOP @MJH67516909 @fucknamesyo @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats If you think this is wrong, then you should be demanding Donald Trump either stop it through executive order or direct the DOJ to interpret the law differently because he has the power to do both!
@THE_TRUE_GOP @MJH67516909 @fucknamesyo @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats This is wrong and it must stop.		Shouldn't be partisan.		The president is not powerless to stop it.		He has directed the DOJ to interpret the law this way.		He is responsible for this.
@HBC1022 @TalbertSwan @PervasiveTruth @realDonaldTrump And you suck!
@HBC1022 @TalbertSwan @PervasiveTruth @realDonaldTrump You're racists too.

@Cassiel_Angelos @lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump The voyage on the Mayflower was dangerous.  There was a good possibility all the families would die on the way or once they arrived.		Just like these new immigrants, those immigrants braved terrifying odds in hope of a better life.		Sound familiar?		Was that child abuse?
@Cassiel_Angelos @lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Practice gratitude. Gratitude will give you the humility to empathize with those less fortunate than yourself.		Rather than condemning their desperate acts you can experience greatfulness for being sparred circumstances depraved enough to drive a person to such extreme acts.
@Cassiel_Angelos @lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Sir, nothing the parents or that coyotes do excuses immoral behaviour on behalf of our government.
@lpboggs @Cassiel_Angelos @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump How does this justify the immoral cruelty by our government?		Because they've made themselves vulnerable to cruel treatment we're no longer responsible for treating them morally?
@lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Would Jesus support the government doing this?
@lpboggs @smiliano913 @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Lorraine, I'm sure we differ on a lot of things, but this shouldn't be a partisan issue.		I mean you love family don't you? 	Are you sure this is your cause? 	This is your fight?	Needless cruelty to parents and grandparents? Hurting children?		That's who you are?	Really?
@lpboggs @smiliano913 @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump The children of incarcerated Americans typically live with their other parent or family.		They don't live in an old Wal-Mart ignorant of when they'll ever see their family again.
@lpboggs @smiliano913 @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Asylum seekers aren't breaking the law.
@lpboggs @smiliano913 @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump People who might come here to hurt us doesn't justify cruelty at our borders.		Nor does the cruelty help keep us safe. It is just inhumane, unChristian, and unnecessary.
@Jemcosker @lpboggs @smiliano913 @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump Or detain them together!
@lpboggs @jmbler @DebbieRhoden57 @realDonaldTrump If you saw a distracted parent at a park would you kidnap their child?		And then would you blame your immoral behaviour on the paren'ts negligence?		No.		We're responsible for acting morally.	Nothing anyone else does changes that.

@RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Your tweet gave me terrible gas.
@Jo_Yaffe @tkuhn24 @kmkelsoeee @RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Yes. He's made a complete round about. 		He dolling out section 8 housing for newly arrived MS13 gang members in trump tower like they're going out of style.		He's paying for them all to go to Mary Mount Manhattan and study musical theatre in the fall.		It's sweet.
@toasterstruby @tkuhn24 @kmkelsoeee @RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Is this satire?
@tkuhn24 @kmkelsoeee @RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton I mean or you could be trying to weaponize the word "emotional", so you can use it to attack those who object when you behave immorally.
@tkuhn24 @kmkelsoeee @RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Travis everybody wants to change the rules to best suit them and feeling emotional sometimes is just human.
@RandyLeBlanc24 @ryrysven @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Check this out! Take the populations of AK, MT, WY, ND &amp; SD, ID and NE and you still haven't quite got the population of NYC, and barely a fifth of CA's pop.		Nope, don't drop the mic just yet. It's just more skullduggary from you tricky conservative skallywags.
@scottwwsawyer @brrite @Chamilton515 @HillaryClinton Your sentence is pretty beat up.

@roten_corey Not just regular treason, but "Treason at the highest level"! Hmmmmm
@SaltySith @toffeeblitz @bobdiz2 @washingtonpost It's "in regard". Regards means greetings.		Okay. That's a baseless claim that there is no need to defend against. 		Youre the one making preposterous statements. 		Prove it! Let me see those receipts!		Fondest regards!
@EQueen730 Oh wait... Were not doing facts anymore? Cool! 😎
@mitchellvii Keep saying that always lose stuff. I like that.		You conssrvatives relax on election day. There's a red tide coming. Stay home. Don't worry😉
@fate5675309 @SecretRage1 @mitchellvii So you're just really self indulgent when it comes to satisfying your confirmation bias.
@stldebbie2011 @EWErickson So that means you're definitely against the kid snatching right. 		Since you're pro-life? Presumably pro-family?
@LindaMcCorkle @EWErickson Also, many of these people are asylum seekers running for their lives and aren't breaking the law. Those that are "illegal" are only guilty of a misdemeanor.
@LindaMcCorkle @EWErickson Omg that's so calluos! 😬		Whether it went on during the Obama administration or not, it's wrong and it should be stopped immediately.
@dean_bratcher @EWErickson Yes he was saying the government and its laws are ordained by God, so that means abortion is ordained by God. Romans 13 😉
@EWErickson So I believe that fetal tissue does not constitute an individual but a part of a woman's body and that guaranteeing women the right to determine what their bodies do is a civil right integral to womens' equality in our democracy.
@mtcaptnron @grizz_meister Actually it's not the difference between anything. Its a lie constructed with cherry picked pictures. Trump bowed too. Get over it.
@FLgirl69sjg @grizz_meister @hickorymtnman And a homophobe too! How resplendently small minded 😉
@EricMoo91919605 @neesernokc1 @KeypollApp @grizz_meister No he was not.  What a bunch of petty bullshit.		Alright, enough of this obtuse skullduggary.		Enjoy spreading lies about irrelevent crap
@neesernokc1 @KeypollApp @grizz_meister @EricMoo91919605 That necklace was right before the pearl one.
@grizz_meister Is it opposite day or something?	Seriously you're going to dig on Obama for bowing when culturally appropriate,	But Trump literally just saluted a NK general and thats America's proudest moment.		WTF is that? Yeah right.
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Michael!  Why shouldn't Mexicans have the same opportunity to come here legally that your so proud of your ancestors for taking advantage of.		Obviously you're thrilled they did, so how can you blame Mexicans for wanting the same thing, and why do they deserve it less?
@LauraClubb1 @SenFeinstein I can call Marco Rubio @SenRubioPress @marcorubio 	@SenBillNelson is on board?		Rubio do this!		I know, I know.  I hafta call ya.  Don't worry I will. I know how you love hearing from me.
@joelpollak Dude they could be at the fucking Ritz Carlton.		They've been kidnapped from their parents.
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter C'mon man!  This is the fundamental question!		I'm waiting.
@mschlapp Is it an opinion that he lied?  		Cause if he lied verifiably 19 times then that's just a fact, and the details are of great interest to the public.
@mike_pence A true Christian would never legitimize a brutal, tyrannical regime or endorse a policy that rips apart families.
@mike_pence Don't lecture me about Faith!		The Democrats are acting correctly and justly by obstructing your evil agenda.		It is impossible for me to imagine how warped your mind must be to think that you live your life following Jesus's example.
@TrashyChic @mike_pence @FaithandFreedom I'm stealing this!
@WilliamCuttin72 @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Of course it never does.  Obviously.		The parents might be desperate, irresponsible, terrible people, scandalous dressers 😉, who knows, but it doesn't matter.		Doesn't make a shred of difference!		None of that excuses treating them cruel and unusually, abusing them.
@WilliamCuttin72 @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Michael didn't say anything profound.  		This is just run-of-the-mill victim blaming.  We've seen this before.		 Rape survivors have dealt with this for decades.		"Well, maybe if she didn't dress so provocatively" the say as if it justifies the perpetrator's actions.		Eye! Roll!
@spitzerC4C @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter What we're doing is immoral.  Nothing changes that, not the parents, not the Mexican government, nothing.		At no point does responsibility for cruel, inhumane and unChristian treatment of these people transfer from us to anyone else. 		We always have the ability to act morally.
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Why did your ancestors deserve an opportunity to come here legally that these people don't have?
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter This is what your argument is like. 		It's like If you saw a mother who was distracted, not watching her child at the park, so you kipnap the kid. But when the cops arrest you you say "why are you arresting me? I never would have taken little Timmy if his mom had paid attention!"
@spitzerC4C @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter You'd do it to their kids though. You do. It's done in your name and you support it.		How do the parents actions relieve us from responsibility for ours?
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Mexico has a long and complicated problem with poverty and curroption, but I'm not a Mexican and I don't have a say in what the Mexican government does.		I do, however, have a say in what I do, and what my government does in my name, and THIS IS WRONG!
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Where is your humility and gratitude that you were spared a desperate situation in a poor "shithole" country by the mere accident of birth?
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Dude. Just I like I said before, we are responsible for what we do. Nothing about Mexico will ever change that or relieve us from any responsibility for how we treat those people.
@EvHBrown @bau_poe @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter OMG we all have to pay taxes not just you.		I work so hard for the money I pay in taxes and people keep trying to win arguments by saying "whine whine whine my taxes!" 		Get over yourself. 		You're not a martyr cause you pay taxes!
@ChrisRubio22 @Diane_mommyof6 @MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Dude, in the circumstances you're describing every effort is made to keep the kid with the family
@MikeQuestionsIt @Esme_Dickenson @AnnCoulter Naw dude. Cowardly. 		Pass the buck huh? 		Wash your hands?		We're responsibly for what we do always in all things.  The parents actions don't change anything.  Our actions are cruel and unacceptable regardless.
@finman1966 @Lrihendry @davidhogg111 Lets talk Chicago! I was a Chicagoan for 6 years?		How familiar are you with nuanced history of organized crime in Chicago, and the gun regulations that accompanied it?
@finman1966 @Lrihendry @davidhogg111 Also, what is your critique of David? Is it that more people are harmed by guns every week than he could ever organize a demonstration to represent?		Isn't that because the gun reforms he advocates for is so badly needed?
@finman1966 @Lrihendry @davidhogg111 The difference between a mass shooting and isolated shootings over the course of a weekend in a city of 3 million is not clear to you?
@wbrockler @TalbertSwan You should.
@REMCJR @jennymaz1 @foxandfriends @jasoninthehouse I mean step up your game.  Freedom of speech is just the tip of the iceberg.  Where's your disdain for civil rights?

@REMCJR @jennymaz1 @foxandfriends @jasoninthehouse Ya see Bob it doesn't surprise me one bit that you embrace selective amnesia while expressing disdain for Freedom of Speech.

@TuckerCarlson Yo dude! Unless they tampered with witnesses to their obstruction of justice charges naw! 		Furthermore, thank god all those desperate families just hoping to bootstrap their way to a better life are locked and their kids taken from them. I feel so much safer!
@AFreeBlackMan Because @KimKardashian told him to.  In the meantime he continues to tear apart families, hoist healthcare from the grasp of poor people, validate brutal dictators, and express disdain for American values like freedom of the press, civil rights, and checks to executive power.

@NotSpear @CarlosV64910815 @shannonlshipley @drw1018 @cspan @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi The law is only being interpreted and enforced in this way because the administration has directed the DOJ to do so. Even if this wasn't the case the separation of families at the border could be stopped via executive order anytime. @realDonaldTrump bears full responsibility.
@realDonaldTrump You continue to try to incriminate others to deflect from your own obstruction of justice.		You are a criminal and a liar.  		History will not pardon you.
@4aclearview @AnnCoulter Once this new subhuman category, "illegals", has been established one is free to deny "illegals" human rights.		We're no longer obliged to hold them responsible only for their own actions, or treat them humanely and ethically or feel any empathy for them when they're not.
@4aclearview @AnnCoulter If you accept the premise that people are only responsible for their own actions and cannot be condemned for the actions of others, then you must concede that you've embraced a special, nonperson standard for so-called "illegals".
@4aclearview @AnnCoulter The hatred that you're motivated by ignorant fear to feel for them is so much more palatable to your conscience when you think of them this way. 		Once they're dehumanized we're no longer obligated not to hold the entire group responsible for the actions of individuals.
@4aclearview @AnnCoulter What you really mean by "illegals" is "other", "not like us and less than us, less worthy of human rights."		You like using that word because it dehumanizes the people your refer to.		It degrades their humanity and reduces to them to an action, thing, or status.
@4aclearview @AnnCoulter Show me the receipts.
@realDonaldTrump Uh oh. 		Looks like the real criminals are your employees. #ManafortGoingtoJail 		No bail.
@TrumpsLiterally @CCOLBYJL @BillOReilly @DailyHillary You seem to feel that pro choice people have a greater burden to prove their claims than you.		Anyone who says a fetus isn't alive is confused though.  A fetus is a living part of the mother's body just like her arms and legs.
@TrumpsLiterally @CCOLBYJL @BillOReilly @DailyHillary I am the subject of your criticism only because you feel that I oppose you politically.		The tweet I'm responding to is exempt from your critique despite doing the same thing because you believe the writer to be politically aligned with you.
@TrumpsLiterally @CCOLBYJL @BillOReilly @DailyHillary So I need to provide evidence that Hillary Clinton is not a murderer who no one prosecutes because they fear she'll have them knocked off?		Or		That unfounded and divisive rhetoric like that is unhelpful to the democratic process and our health as a nation?
@CCOLBYJL @BillOReilly @DailyHillary This isn't helping anything you know.		First of all, your claims are completely false.		Furthermore, 65.9 million Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, so this type of bogus rhetoric is definitely not how we come together as a nation and forge a way forward.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Mediaite YOU are gonna condescend to ME about privilege doughy rich boy?		Give me a fucking break.

@winterbrezzy101 @DJBurn77 @SparksLissa @WiredSources What DJBurn said is true. 		Why were your immigrant family members more entitled to come here than people are today?

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You're a lying juvenile tool. 		Just a wind bag cheerleader for the president.
@realDonaldTrump You're a liar. The crime is real. You're a criminal.		You claim to care about our country and to support an agenda that puts America first, but you don't value freedom of the press, democracy, checks and balances, equality, civil rights or the rule of law.		You are anti-American.

@josephm829 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You're swamp a moose!		I wrote a children's book about you called "when you give a swamp moose a muffin".		I'm sorry to say your portrayal in the book is unflattering and the story is a precautionary one.
@realDonaldTrump You're ugly.
@tlj7295 @jbrouder85 @MassengillSusan @1032jarhead @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump That is a verifiably false claim. You are crediting Trump with an economy he inherited from Obama.		Obama created the prosperity we now enjoy.  He hoisted the economy out of the gutter like a power lifter squating 1,000 lbs.		He's a hero.
@MassengillSusan @1032jarhead @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The economy that Trump enjoys he inherited from Obama. 		Obama inherited a complete mess created by  Republican policies of lax oversight of financial institutions.		Thankfully the upward economic trends started by Obama have continued under Trump.
@MassengillSusan @1032jarhead @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Those figures are false.
@BillOReilly It's patriotic to want the best for our country.
@catman44485 @dbongino @Americanpie48 Bush would not do talks with N. Korea, Iran or Venezuela. 		Shutting out enemies like that was standard procedure for the Bush administration and a foreign policy hallmark of the era.

@YouTubeHowToDIY @BangCityGifs @Blueheron0721 @Maggiemay2110 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @g7 I admire your passion, but that's not what we're arguing about.		That might be true. It might not.	Either way, you show me how Trump did something besides have a tantrum over that, and point to some real accomplishments, then we might be talking about the samething.
@YouTubeHowToDIY @BangCityGifs @Blueheron0721 @Maggiemay2110 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @g7 Your premise: G7 countries are unfairly benefiting from the US and Trump made a stride toward correcting that at the G7.		 That's not true though.		He just alienated them and made the possibility of better deals in the future less likely.		It was completely counterproductive.
@6bird4 @OneAboveTwo @GovMikeHuckabee Faulty premise. The other leaders are saying what's on their mind too and with more clarity. 		Trump doesnt like what they have to say. 		He responds with bullying and rudeness. Then people call his lack of diplomacy and professionalism speaking his mind. 		Well that's bullshit.
@mrstraug1 @i_mnottellin @GovMikeHuckabee Excellent point. You must be outraged then that this type of "hating" comes from our president all the time.
@GovMikeHuckabee Lesser nations? So were refering to our allies Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and UK as lesser nations now? 		Okay, wow.
@YouTubeHowToDIY @BangCityGifs @Blueheron0721 @Maggiemay2110 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @g7 Ha ha ha! He did us a service by alienating our closest and oldest allies. I think not.		No, you're mistaken. We're all only human though, no worries.
@BangCityGifs @unikornporn @Blueheron0721 @Maggiemay2110 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @g7 You just literally farted with your mind right there brodangle.

@BangCityGifs @Blueheron0721 @Maggiemay2110 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @g7 Trump is like a really dry biscuit, and you have no butter or gravy or even water, and the biscuit is made out of dog shit, and someone is standing over you making you eat the biscuit.  		That's what having Trump as your president is like.		So don't tell me it isn't bad.
@DailyCaller That's great. Hope he does it.

@LarryRamzey @NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump I don't lie. Truth and justice are values integral to my life and my beliefs, personal and political.		I'm interested to see you answer my previous questions.
@LarryRamzey @NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump How is this tribalism helpful? How can this ever produce a way forward for our country?
@LarryRamzey @NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump You believe all liberals are liars? You don't entertain the idea that with intentions just as pure I suppose yours are they see things differently than you. You chose to believe they're all liars?
@LarryRamzey @NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump But why really do you see them as so different from you? Why are they not American and the enemy?

@Ken81586143 @SenBillNelson Not sure what you're talking about in terms of coexisting.		As for hatred. Ken, I think you're mixed up, but I love you, and I wish you best. 		Seriously. Be well brother.
@Ken81586143 @SenBillNelson No, I'm just talking about hypocrisy. 		Look at my tweet. It expresses a simple truism: what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson And regardless of the outcome my comments on the role of congress are true, and your criticism unfounded. 		In fact, dissenting and skeptical voices within our congress, even when they are in the minority are valuable and integral to our democracy.
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson I spent 6 years of my life living in Chicago. It's a great city, and Illinois is a great state.		I'm here in Florida currently, and I'm a 7th generation Floridian. We're a solid swing state. It could go either way.
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson There are 209 comments at the time of this tweet.		I find it hard to believe your statistic is accurate.
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson You think that I am in the minority in my view of congress's role in government, that I am not entitled to representation in congress or both?
@RepBillJohnson 100% of summits you don't attempt are unproductive.
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson Floridians with views differing from yours also deserve representation in congress.		That's what the US is all about, so why dont you try supporting America
@ChuckJordan4 @SenBillNelson He is supporting his country. 		Congress functions to check the power of the executive office, and this kind of oversight and criticism is just that.
@Ken81586143 @SenBillNelson Also unless you were outrage at congressional attacks on Obama you need to go back to bed confused, doube-standard loving hypocrite.
@Ken81586143 @SenBillNelson You're confused. The role of Congress is to uphold democracy, the constitution and the interests of the American people, and that's exactly what he's doing.

Enjoy your embarrassing "white people are discriminated against" thing.
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews No racial prejudice is good and none justifies any other.
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews I agree with that definition of racism. If you look at my comments you'll see that I never say all whites want the upper hand or that they feel ill will toward black people.
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews Because white people are the overwhelming racial majority in the US they typically represent the numerical majority in most statistics including number of people incarcerated and benificiaries of entitlement programs like welfare.
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews Whites make up roughly 62% of the population and blacks 13%. Consequently more whites are shot every year by police.		About 1/2 of people shot by police each year are white and 1/4 are black, which makes a black person roughly 3 times more likely to be shot by police.
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews What is your premise exactly? 		Is it that racism doesn't exist anymore?		Here's my takeaway from your comments: "Racism is dead in the US.  A handful of holidays, and programs meant to counteract racism and some achievements by successful  black people proves it."		Is that it?
@michele_royston @gborh1 @renren1176 @CharlieDogma @FoxNews Exactly and that's all very important and great but none of it refutes the fact that white privilege exists. 		Those things have occurred inspite of white privelege, but a powerful and destructive bias toward whiteness is still prevalent in our culture.

What about the ones who die in car crashes even when they were 30 miles over the speed limit.		Don't we call tragic?
@LovingG39333698 @WitchCandee @stocksproperty @realDonaldTrump You think that and you don't what punctuation is :/		And yeah, that's an ad hominen attack, but you prolly dunno what that is or that I misspelled words in my reply to you.		Sorry.  I'm tricky!
@realMikeLindell @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @seanhannity Neither fox nor republicans really represent Christian values.		This is almost as big a sham con job pulled on well intentioned people as the crusades were.		The party of every man for himself, not the party of Christ.
@ThatGirl1965 @K_SmittySmith @B1_H5_M5 I love what you said.  I am liberal, but Marco Rubio is "okay" in my book.  He is my senator as a Floridian.		All this demonization of the opposition that both sides engage in including and especially the president is tearing our country apart.  It is hateful to America.
@edwardes_matt @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle I don't think bullies are unworthy of sympathy.		After all they're often children who are the victims of violence and mistreatment at home		That's where they learn what they act out on their vulnerable peers to try feel in control.
@edwardes_matt @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle I didn't say teens, including autistic ones, aren't bullied into suicide.		I said the Parkland kids didn't bully Nik Cruz into mass murder.
@edwardes_matt @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Of course! And that's a tragedy!		You've point out the victims of bullying are sometimes perpetrators of violence against themselves. They rarely are of anyone else.		Do I believe Nik Cruz was bullied into mass murder?		No!		He was the bully!
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Bullies however, usually face an adult abuser in their life and bad conditions at home, like Nik Cruz did.		They often act out the violence learned from adults in their lives against their peers to try to regain control over something, anything, including a vulnerable peer.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle While we're talking about bullying it is important to point out that the bullied should not be further victimized by facing the stigma of becoming the next school shooter.		The bullied are actually unlikely to become perpetrators of violence against anyone beside themselves.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle The three ingredients that teachers, and school administrators are trained by to use to identify bullying and distinguish it from other non bullying incidents are:		Abuse,	Unfair Match and	Repetition.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle So what is Bullying?		Easy!		Bullying is defined by an aggressive abuse of power where an unfair match exists, and it's not an isolated event.  It repeats over and over regularly leaving the victim, often an inexperienced adolescent believing there is no hope or end in sight ever
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Ms. Gonzalez is justified and accurate in saying that those who call her non association with Cruz bullying "don't know".		In their accusations they demonstrate an incomplete understanding of bullying while, ironically, sometimes practicing bullying &lt;pause&gt; against her.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Refusing to asscoiate with someone who is "creepy" because they are violent and antisocial is not bullying.		It is something that most people are faced with at some point in their life regardless of how much empathy and compassion they might have for the antisocial person.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Ms. Gonzalez, in her youth, chooses poorly to describe this as "ostracizing", but what she is referring to is non association, which in absence of harassment is not bullying.		Again, choosing not to associated with someone is a right and is not bullying.		Bullying is not passive.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle First of all let's talk about what bullying is not.  		This is what the commenter most clearly misunderstands.		Every student, just like every person, has the right to choose their friends.		Choosing not to associate, unless there is also harassment, is not bullying.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle Before I begin, you may be asking yourself what credentials I have to define bullying.  		That's reasonable and I respect that.		I am a high school teacher in Florida.		I've received numerous trainings on understanding, identifying and dealing with bullying.
@joker40324 @AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle What is bullying? 		It's important that we recognize bullying as it is a destructive and  traumatizing force in our society that victimizes and tortures the most vulnerable members of it. 		You've demonstrated an incomplete understanding of bullying. 		I will define it for you.
@perfectsliders We kicking their kids out of public school next?
@TomiLahren Guns and coal don't go with god in 2018 you fucking troglodyte!
@AWindowLiquor @FgtTheOligarchy @IngrahamAngle He bullied Nik Cruz? You got proof of that? Hogg is indirectly responsible for the shooting cause he drove Cruz to the edge with harassment? Seriously? https://t.co/dgkTBnKiXv
@dbongino Too small a sample size. This is not an indicator that a majority of people on the left feel this way		This is an obvious and well known logical fallacy Dan is deliberating using to manipulate. You can't take some statement like this and attribute it to an entire group of people.
@TomiLahren Did FaithWire coin that phrase, "scourge of the homeless", and attribute it to Jesus Christ?

@TomiLahren So condescending!		 Undergraduates been bitching out Jerry Brown since the 70's. 		Dead Kennedys famously portayed him as a totalitarian on their legendary debut album back then. 		I don't think he can hear you. Man's got thick skin. 		Try harder
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS You're a complete ass!
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS The children he boasted about the economy to?
@TomiLahren It warrants no response from him as a resident of that town. 		Pride events occur all over the nation to promote love, peace and acceptance, and to encourage a historically persecuted group to take pride in their identity despite hatred and opposition
@RED_HOOD1991 @TomiLahren There does not need to be a straight pride parade. 		Straight people have not been beaten, murdered, denied or fired from jobs, shamed, condemned or treated like pedos or mentally ill because of their sexuality. 		Vicious persecution of homosexuals is ancient and on going.
@TomiLahren Illegal immigrants are not voting. 		This statement is way to broadly applied even if there are people to whom it applies from every part in government.		Very immature generalization and not true.

@tomjasser820 @FoxNews Well, what exactly is being enforced and how easy is it to get around? That's a good place to start.		Then we could ponder what regulations, had they been in place, would have prevented Omar Mateen and Nikolas Cruz from acquiring their weapons.
@tomjasser820 @FoxNews I love shooting skeet! I have a loaded 9mm in my night stand 3 feet from me right now. 		I also support and do not feel threatened by sensible, responsible gun regulation.

@TomiLahren #StrawmanArgument
@ik238 @AdvocacyReader @IngrahamAngle It doesn't matter the political affiliation of the people he killed, and I'd be cautious of speaking for the dead. 		What matters is that we did not decide how to treat all people "like him" based on what he did. He was one man responsible for his own actions.
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren @JeffLee2020 blocked me. I was perfectly civil. All I did, debately, is win an argument, and he couldn't handle that. These are the people who call us Snowflakes! #Hypocrisy #Resistance
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren Furthermore I do not buy into the bizarre and counterintuitive narrative that Trump, the rich, cloistered, privileged individual that he is, is an agent of opposition to the mainstream or part of some movement that offers opportunity or any sort of benefit to the common man.
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren While I'm not entirely opposed to remaining open to ideas that depart radically from the main stream narrative I believe it is necessary to do so with extreme caution and skepticism.
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren If number of followers is your criterion for expertise or leadership I suggest you defer to @selenagomez
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren You've countered my ad hominen attack with one your own and layered another logically fallacy into the mix for good measure, your followers as cosigners of your tweets. My status on twitter is irrelevent. Number of followers does not determine validity of statements.
@JeffLee2020 @craig04505 @TomiLahren What about his lies to the American people where this issue is concerned. If we concede that the affairs took place than we must deal with the fact that president has lied repeatedly about them and can't be trusted.
@JeffLee2020 @TomiLahren Hey Jeff! I think you sound like a sore loser and a nastalgic, out of touch old man. I hope you're not also a wacko conspiracy theorist,  but your tweet leads me to believe otherwise. I imagine your intentions are good, but you rhetoric is not patriotic, or wise.
@craig04505 @AlexandraAnne72 @TomiLahren @BarackObama Black Americans may rightfully have had a justifiable distrust of law enforcement all along, since it is debatable, and unlikely that law enforcement has ever had their best interests at heart.

@mitchellvii Truth,  justice and decency will prevail
@TomiLahren They're not putting it above "everything else". It's not an either / or situation. That's a false narrative and a logical fallacy.
@TomiLahren And you're a terrorist too Toni, creating false narratives, turning Americans against each other.
@FrankBr36368514 @SenFeinstein You commonly refer to people who have commited a civic infraction or a misdemeanor as criminal?
@WILDWAYNE45 @LoganSeymore @SenFeinstein The penalties are severe. The population in question is risk averse and has very little to gain from taking the risk. Your statement suggests paranoia and simply defies common sense. Undocumented people do not vote.
@WILDWAYNE45 @SenFeinstein Undocumented people who rarely seek help even from the police when they're victims of violent crime due to fear of deportation do not risk the same and jail time in order to cast one vote. You can worry about something else.
@WILDWAYNE45 @SenFeinstein Not true. We're fed up with this false rhetoric about lack of respect for the law from people who only have selective respect for the law themselves and are mainly interested in persecuting people they've dehumanized and made scapegoats
@georgenagel @Rockdog97 @Almondjoyisgood @IngrahamAngle People who rarely even seek the help of police when they're victims of violent crime due to fear of deportation riskng the same and even jail time just to vote. It just doesn't make any sense.
@Terpsicore333 @RealMAGASteve @LibbySchaaf @ICEgov @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Your characterization of undocumented people is paranoid and inaccurate. Like American Dreamers of the past they've come here from a place of desperation looking for the opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their families.
@JTMann05 @realDonaldTrump You suck.
@Blackintel1 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends @POTUS Bullshit. Not true. Extreme, crazy mischaracterization. Misinformation campaign. More it's true cause I say so, believe me BS.

@Travispsyd @TomiLahren @foxandfriends For real!
@CarolMa85968144 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends So you're not supporter of states rights?
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Another strawman arguement from #MissRepresentation   Opposing the administration's position on immigration is not putting immigrants before Americans.
@realDonaldTrump Sham tweet. Sham president.
@ReleaseTheTexts @FreckledShelley @TomiLahren @seanhannity Attemptng to imply guilt-by-association? That's pretty funny and blind too when the sitting president advocates sexual assault while asserting that he is above the law and common decency because he is a celebrity, pretty much defending Weinstein's behavior.
@VoiceMeetReason @6035rotciv @BGelbard @TomiLahren Ha ha ha! Best come back! Re-velopmentallyDisabled though. Please!
@chekursix @conservmillen So you're joking about killing your fellow Americans in a civil war. You hate them simply because you don't approve and wish to limit their freedoms. You probably call yourself a patriot too.
@conservmillen Yes they do if they were born female. Gender is not biological, it's a social construction.
@airbornelayer88 @emberkjohnson @4colesJami @conservmillen @JackPosobiec You're making a false comparison between beastiality and being transgendered. Therefore this is a straw man argument in which you've distracted from the real conversation by attacking a view not held by your opposition.
@ikrenke04 In this case there isn't a differentiation! :) besides illegal presence is civil offense, and you'd do the same. You never had to choose between your family's prosperity and being an unauthorized occupant somewhere. It's easy to talk.
@ikrenke04 @ericgoesboating @TomiLahren Making sacrifices to give your family a better life is noble. You'd do the same, but are priveleged not to have to. Criminal.

@charliekirk11 Identifying undocumented votes is easy and people are looking. Undocumented persons would be required to register in their own name to vote ubless they could impersonated another registered voter. Lists of registered voters can be and are compared to lists of non-citizens.
@charliekirk11 Penalties for non-citizens voting are severe. Federally they can fined up to $100k and imprisoned for up to 3 years. Many states have their own even harsher laws. A permenant resident of Texas was sentenced to 8 years in prison for voting.
@charliekirk11 The undocumented population is so afraid of deportation that they are unlikely to seek police help when they're victims of violent crime or medical help when they're ill. It is bizzare to suppose they would risk the same or worse for the privelege of voting.
@charliekirk11 Dems aren't concerned that wide spread voter fraud by undocumented people is influencing our elections because they don't need to be, because it's not happening. This is provable. More 👇

@johnmcqueen56 @RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Like seriously! For real dude? How can you justify punishing even one person for the actions of another person?
@johnmcqueen56 @RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Soooo, by "them" you must mean some subhuman thing, who live as a hive or a colony and take credit for each others actions? Right? You must mean that! How else can you support punishing an entire group people for the actions of one or even a gathering of people like "them".
@RussianSpyJenny @johnmcqueen56 @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Don't you know nothing in this world is free?
@RussianSpyJenny @focusmm64 @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Affirmative action only short circuits bias toward whites. If white priveledge did not exist there would be no need for affirmative action.
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter History does not remember fondly those who punish innocents based on the actions of people "like them".
@SPECialTREfoil @RussianSpyJenny White people are great! Holy crap we have a rich ethnic heritage! White privilege exists too, and White people don't have get mad or feel guilty about it! In fact they shouldn't. Acknowledging it doesn't even make it go away! And white people are still awesome!
@jthvac04 @LarryOConnor @NRA Don't tell me what to do.
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter I see Mexicans building things all the time! They might have even put a new roof on a hospital or school your family built, maybe even resurfaced a road your family originally paved!
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter My family were Irish. Below is how we were depicted when we first arrived. 		What's your family's immigration story? https://t.co/KoXZPfrcZg
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Hatred of new arrivals by less recent arrivals is old fashion, even predictable in AmericA! There are always reasons. Each brick in this cartoon from 1882 is a reason to exclude Chinese immigrants. https://t.co/RPHxE0eaon
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter So your story is that being an immigrant is easy because you insidiously and sneakily work the system to steal from the American people, and contribute nothing in return but are essentially a leech?		What's your family's immigration story?
@IWOffendU @seanhannity Besides, I'm not now nor have I have ever  advacated for open boarders. You and I probably disagree a lot less than you imagine on that.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity My grandparents were Irish. I don't believe the here or now can be well or wisely understood by ignoring history. Look and see the monkey like carciture of my grandparents. It illustrates well how they were received regardless of the law. https://t.co/fxK4pW0CGz
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter What is your family's immigration story?
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Your story is that immigrants have it easy because we support them through programs?
@IWOffendU @seanhannity I'm not "the left", I'm a person.		Flagging support: The justice department says people can be fired for being gay https://t.co/i7zCHVgbTF via @TheEconomist
@IWOffendU @seanhannity What's your family's immigration story?
@IWOffendU @seanhannity A new American is what my great grandparents were 100 years ago, but they still exist.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity I didnt say they didn't. But since it's important to you, as it Should be, Jeff Sessions has advised his DOJ to reinterpret the law so LGTBQ+ people can be fired from their jobs based on their sexual orientation.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity Liberty and justice and civil rights for all Americans, for Native Americans, for New Americans, for Muslims, for Atheists, for the LGBTQ+++ community, for all Americans of every faith, and every creed, every orientation and every race. No one left out! Freedom! Acceptance! Love!
@IWOffendU @seanhannity God is not under assualt by the left. Freedom to practice whatever religion you believe with dignity and respect is sacrasanct.
@RussianSpyJenny @HLMullaney @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Diversity is our strength. Your family has an immigration story too.
@RussianSpyJenny @HLMullaney @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter That's not a valid comparison. Where you grow up is who you are. These kids don't deserve banishment to a foreign country.
@RussianSpyJenny @charlen93326871 @AnnCoulter Even according to US law a child under 11 is not liable for a crime.  Even a teen shouldn't be consider criminal simply for accompanying their family. How can you rasonably call a child a criminal for accompanying their family. #absurd
@AnnCoulter We don't punish innocent people based on the actions of another regardless of similarities they may have.
@RudeKanaka @LethalLoganX @DLoesch You got a problem with Trannies?
@LarryOConnor @NRA I own a gun. It's overrated.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity Thank you for you service! I wish you the best! God bless you!
@LindseyGrahamSC @GreenvilleNews Stigmatizing mental illness is wrong.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity Your comparison is vague, frivolous, and inaccurate. There is no valid comparison between the 3rd Reich and any mainstream American party. Your opposition is no less human, American or well intentioned than you.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity No one is trying to tear anything down. Half the country isn't against the country. By refusing to deny each others' humanity, and by trying to understand each others' intentions we can be whole and move forward through compromise.
@IWOffendU @seanhannity The country you live in is made up of people. The people are the country. They have differing views, and their views are American too. It's the division you buy into that is destroying us. Hesitate before you demonize your opposition. Their intentions are no less pure than yours.
@seanhannity Who else do we arm? Churches are popular soft targets! Should we arm ministers? Should we arm the parishners? Maybe we should arm musicians, concert attendees, college students. Should everyone have a gun?
@seanhannity Would you carry a fire arm to the office, on air? Would you accept being shot to death as an occupational hazard? Would you accept "a little extra" for the privilege of risking, and possibly losing, your life to subdue an active shooter situation at you job site?
@NRA Oh, and if what I said before wasn't clear enough, FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU FOREVER! Enjoy Boeing the nation's pariah club!
@NRA I'm a gun owner and have enjoyed responisbley using my 2nd amendment rights, but they are not unlimited and you're becoming a cult and an extremist group.
@HMuery @Frialish @TomiLahren She is divisive. She mischaractorizes her opponent in order to belittle their view, demonize their intentions and call them names. Its not even news or debate it's highly biased entertainment for a specific audience, and It's incongruent with the claims she makes above
@TomiLahren You frequently mischaractorize your opposition in order to belittle their views and intentions. At best it's rhetorical cheating and at worst it's a devisive and destructive waste of the influence your wide audience affords.
@TomiLahren You would have more integrity as a journalist Our country would be better off if you actually used the attention you enjoy to advocate for that goal rather than continuing to spew divisive propaganda that presents a stilted, demonizing view of the left.
@realDonaldTrump Hell No!
@seanhannity Oh fuck you!
@realDonaldTrump Sadly you're the prez!  If you have any interest in Dreamers besides exploiting them as political pawns than do something. Dems didn't  put them in this horrendous, shameful situation. You did.
@kdreetz @Funnyyjustin @realDonaldTrump Youre cliche rhetoric about leaving if we don't like it is laughable! Our right to desent and speak out is gaurenteed by the constitution and more American than apple pie. We need a leader who can unite this country and forge a path forward we can all live with.
@kdreetz @Funnyyjustin @realDonaldTrump You want to blah blah blah about Kate's wall against the wishs of her surviving family, but how about Kate's Handgun Ban! After all it's the prevalence of guns in our country that led to some fool, immigrant or not, just finding one stashed in public and mishandling it.
@kdreetz @Funnyyjustin @realDonaldTrump Kathryn Steinle's family don't support your narrative about immigrant killers or your disgusting exploitation of their daughter's passing. #disgusting
@realDonaldTrump Reading your bullshit https://t.co/cP81u1ch4U

@HuevosDeChivo @realDonaldTrump Great. Ban those too!
@realDonaldTrump You would ask these teachers to confront an armed attacker and face the hazard of losing their own life in the process and compensate them nothing? A "little extra", a "bonus"? Teachers our some of the most underpaid and unappreciated public servants. This is an insult to injury.
@JamesSchmittJr1 @Laighe @JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump It's about race.  You're white privelege makes you blind to it.

@nhobbs2 @BronxKing3 @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump Rediculous. All your tweets evidence is that you know nothing about Obama's economy or how to have debate.

@realDonaldTrump You are constantly encouraging division.  You are the divider in chef.  It is obviously a goal of yours to pit Americans against each other. You believe it gives you an advantage.
@realDonaldTrump The lady protests too much
@TomiLahren Why does anyone give a fuck What you say?
@TomiLahren Why shouldn't it be?  I don't believe in God and I think disenfranchising people like me should be controversial. I think treating something like it's universal when it's not should be controversial. You are the sniffling voice of the priveleged denied a biscoff cookie.
@TomiLahren You suck!
@TomiLahren Where was your sympathy for Seth Rich's grieving family or for Kate Steinle's?
@thomashowl @TonyBruin @reddaug17 @mmurphy0907 @TomiLahren Let's have no laws then.
@TomiLahren You're politizing this to push your agenda too and using the families by falsely framing your partisan attack as a defense of grieving families.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Whose Joy Behar?
@TomiLahren You're nothing but a bully and a carpet bagger hustling a pack of divisive lies designed to tear our country apart. Go home charlatan.

@ST66899053 @TierraExtranjer @blonde815 @GWorkman52 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Okay, so you would have told civil rights activists and women's suffaragists "the law is the law", and to stop being childish just for wanting fair and ethical treatment. The mere existence of a law doesn't justify its unethical consequence. Morality is not childish or emotional.
@DaysLeft4Trump Way toooo long!
@ST66899053 @TierraExtranjer @blonde815 @GWorkman52 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Also, I dont think Mr. Destino was claiming anyone's "ancestors" are alive today. Mine sure as hell aren't.  The fact is every American family has an immigration story. Except the indigenous people the land was viciously stolen from.
@ST66899053 @TierraExtranjer @blonde815 @GWorkman52 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Late 1800's cartoon depicting an Irish servent as a violent monkey-like subhuman, as was common then. Appearantly the laws you allege existed were insufficient to keep them out, and The US seems to have endured just fine to spite that fact. https://t.co/MyLwv0GGxq
@ST66899053 @TierraExtranjer @blonde815 @GWorkman52 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Segregation was the law of the land in this country once.  Would you have had the same attitude toward protesters staging a sit in at a whites only lunch counter. They broke the law. Would you have lectured them about the rule of law?
@ST66899053 @TierraExtranjer @blonde815 @GWorkman52 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Our government was brilliantly designed to allow us to continue to perfect the law and guarantee that its outcomes are ethical and in the spirit of the law.
@realDonaldTrump You need to be less partisan. You need to show respect for people you don't agree with rather than insult and antagonize Americans. We deserve a president whose leadership unites us, not your vain, childish bullshit.  You have no dignity.
@gman_lean You claim to be so reverent of the law. So about the fact that the main purpose of the law is to protect the innocent from harm!
@gman_lean Allowing DACA kids to stay isn't a free pass. They don't require a pass. They did nothing wrong. It's about doing the right thing.
@gman_lean @marcorubio Clearly you dehumanize these innocent people. Otherwise participating in an act of tremendous cruelty against them would be a massive problem of conscience.
@gman_lean @marcorubio They grew up here and assimilated the culture. Some of them came so young they have no memory of their birth country. They have a stake in our country. It's their country too in every way except on paper. The should be entitled to stay.
@gman_lean @marcorubio Dreamers aren't criminals. U.S. state and federal law, which you claim to be reverent of, rightly forbid considering most of them liable for unauthorized entry or any other crime due to their age at the time of entry. Unauthorized presence isn't even crime, it's a civil offense.
@gman_lean @marcorubio Your obviously exaggerated inability to conduct yourself in public without speaking Spanish is an entirely moot point where our abligation  to treat Dreamers ethically is concerned, and betrays the fact that your opinion is fueled by prejudice rather than reverence for the law.
@gman_lean @marcorubio Didn't we just have tax law reform? If you still feel that your tax burden is harmful to you and unethical then you are free to vote and advocate for further tax cuts as I'm sure many people will.
@gman_lean @marcorubio You enjoy the right not to be prosecuted or pubished for any act you cannot be considered criminally liable. Why shouldn't they?
@gman_lean @marcorubio We are a nation of laws, and even more admirabley fair and reasonable laws. It is a proud fact that any person within our borders can be expect to be treated fairly, and surely that includes exclusion from punishment for infractions they cannot reasonable be held responsible for.
@gman_lean @marcorubio What you're proposing is exiling a group of innocent people away from their homes to what are essential foreign countries to them.  That is an oversight not an intended consequence of our immigration law. We must reform the law to accomadate this situation and reflect our ethics.
@gman_lean @marcorubio Deporting them now would be punishment. They're not responsible for being brought here, growing up here, or assimilating the culture. Some of them don't even speak the language of their birth country. Others don't speak it well.
@PressSec #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown #TrumpShutDown
@gman_lean @marcorubio Overstaying a visa is a civil offense and unauthorized entry a misdeamonor. We don't usually assign the moniker criminal to these types of offenders and banishment from the land where you grew up, internalized the culture and are at home is a hell of a penalty for a misdemeanor
@gman_lean @marcorubio They aren't criminals. A 5 year old is not old enough to be considered criminalmy liable for anything according to US law, especially not for accompanying their parents.
@pshio @marcorubio I am also a Rubio constituent. I second this and I'll be voting and driving voters to the polls. DACA NOW!
@marcorubio Do it now! 6 weeks is nothing on capital hill and you know it. DACA is an emergency.
@sp1r1tharambe @DonGookin @calvinstowell @realDonaldTrump Not supporting a bill because of what it ommits is not the same as opposing what it already contains. This is a ridiculous over simplification.
@sp1r1tharambe @calvinstowell @realDonaldTrump Not an either/or sitution. That's a divisive misrepresentation and a logical fallacy. It is not a zero sum game. We need and can have both.

@DCGoheen @ixochitl @DonnaMartinNeth @EshetChayil2011 @PressSec 43% of undocumented people entered through official channels and overstayed visas. That's only a civil offense. Unauthorized entry  is only a misdeamonor. Banishment from the country where you grew up and assimilated the culture is a hell of a punishment for a misdeamonor.
@DCGoheen @ixochitl @DonnaMartinNeth @EshetChayil2011 @PressSec Minimum age of criminal liability federally is 11. It's 14 in Texas and California, and 15 in New Mexico.
@DCGoheen @ixochitl @DonnaMartinNeth @EshetChayil2011 @PressSec They aren't all illegal immigrants either. It's not a crime to be brought somewhere by your parents when you're below the age of criminal liability.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Allowing Dreamers to stay is not about refusing to punish criminals. It's about refusing to punish innocent people like they're criminals.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Dreamers are a special group who arrived as children and spent a portion of their formative years in the US. They broke no laws by being brought here or by being raised here and consequently becoming Americans in everyway except on paper.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren See here you're equatting amnesty for all illegal aliens with allowing Dreamers to stay. Might seem like a clever rhetorical device but it's actually a logical fallacy. At this point we're not even discussing the same thing.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren You keep reiteratting this hollow argument about the law, but you provide no rationale for the law's righteousness or neccessity. Furthermore these people committed no crime. Their illegal status is no fault of their own, which is precisly why their status should not be illegal.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren It's ironic that you call me childish and emotional when you are so angry and in debted to name calling and belittlement for the substance of your tweets.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren You rely solely on cliches. Rather than really addressing my arguments you belittle the voices of people who stand to have their lives up-ended, their careers, loved one of everything they've worked for torn away from them.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Dude. You're the one whose emotional. Your reacting out of hatred and fear. You're still trying cowardly to hide your bigotry behind reverence for policy.  I never said you were a Nazi, but I did say and sustain that you have that in common with them.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren My greater reverence for the human consequence of law than the policy itself is a sentiment shared by the likes of MLK and Gandhi.  Blind complience with policy or "orders" regardless of their moral outcome however, was a common defense at Nuremberg.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren There is a long history of bad laws in this land and a proud and equally long history of great, heroic Americans who fought, and demonstrated and changed them.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren No, no, no, weak sauce bro. The issues here is morality. What matters is the consequence of the law.  That's why our government was designed specifically to give us the power to change and perfect the laws to better serve our society.
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Their present age doesn't even matter, but there are plenty in their late teens and early twenties too, and I know this for a fact because I've meet them! How many of these young Americans have you meet? Who are you to judge their character, worthiness or anything else?
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Fuck out of where? You're really flaunting your ignorance now. Many didn't even know their status until high school, and its not legally possible to apply for citizenship while in the country illegally, and they shouldn't have to anyway. They shouldn't be illegal to begin with!
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren A law that would exile young Americans I know back to Mexico when they haven't been there since they were six months old and don't speak Spanish is immoral and monstrous and if you think it shouldn't be changed SO ARE YOU!
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren You're a bigot hiding behind a cruel, immoral law. We have the power to change the law! This country is founded on the right to protest and to disagree with the status quo, and to change bad fucking laws!
@RobertMordica @AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren The laws are up to us and that is a bad one. Dreamers are Americans. Meet them, and then you'll know. They have no business going anywhere but here.
@AmericanFreedo2 @kalerob22 @TomiLahren Fake news is fake news! Dreamers are Americans! Exiling them to a strange land is inhumane and unAmerican! You are a MONSTER!
@realDonaldTrump So called "Religious Freedom" just protects a person's right to deny another person their rights.
@TomiLahren Morality cheerleading! Tomi, the right's vulgarity and name calling is an embarrassment for them, but it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.
@marcorubio I am Florida resident and a Rubio constituent. My great grandparents immigrated here from a "shithole", and I'm voting against anyone who supports Trump! BTW Miami, BTW Marco Rubio, I'm sure cuba is a Shithole to Trump!
@BeverlyTravis14 @IggyRN80 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Our veterans should have the absolute best care possible. Your erroneous account of the care immigrants supposedly get is not relevent.  The fact that immigrants don't get access to the care they need either doesn't change anything for your husband.
@BeverlyTravis14 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews This isn't true. In reality many illegals go without badly needed medical care because they are afraid to go.
@ClaraLouiseBro1 @barbiesewandsew @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Change the law so they aren't Illegal.  Stop hiding behind cruel, fear-based policy to justify you cruel, fear-based agenda. What are you afraid of?
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews That's not a real problem. Illegal immigrants are not impacting our elections. This is bullshit.
@BreitbartNews But Breitbart is fracturing the GOP and turning it in on itself. So Bravo!
@BreitbartNews Breitbart made up Deep State.  John McCain is an American hero.
@kathystone1221 @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump How un-American to think this country is only for people who think a certain way. Try actually saying something rather than using a cliche as a short cut to thinking.
@TomiLahren You dont hurt my feelings Toni!  I fight you and what you represent because it is rooted in hatred and evil and is poisonous to humankind. My feelings are not hurt!  You can call me names and talk sassy to a camera all day. I'm good! I oppose you cause your wrong!
@TomiLahren Your world view that protesters and demonstrators and anyone using their 1st amendments rights to express views counter to yours does so because they have hurt feelngs or something is so fucked and juvenile!
@TomiLahren Right! Just like you offend historically marginalized people to inspire white supramacists.

@VinnyC00693123 @GeoffGaebe @acholla527 @TomMillze @AnnoyinglyYours @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren Clearly knowledge and the truth of very little importance to you too.
@GeoffGaebe @VinnyC00693123 @acholla527 @TomMillze @AnnoyinglyYours @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren Who care who believes him! He is clearly a low information loud mouth with a myopic world view shaped by hearsay and rumor. Tune out!!
@VinnyC00693123 @GeoffGaebe @acholla527 @TomMillze @AnnoyinglyYours @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren Oh!! Your family in Brooklyn makes you an authority on how the 2 million residents there speak!? Perfect example of your logic!!

@VinnyC00693123 @TomMillze @GeoffGaebe @acholla527 @AnnoyinglyYours @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren So your counter arguement is a racial micro aggression? Wish I was surprised!
@VinnyC00693123 @TomMillze @GeoffGaebe @acholla527 @AnnoyinglyYours @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren And what does Trumpcare cost in lives? TBD.
@TomiLahren She won, the popular vote, and Trump can't even win the support of his own party.
@VinnyC00693123 @GeoffGaebe @acholla527 @AnnoyinglyYours @TomMillze @TopRopeTravis @TomiLahren Then you definitely can't afford Trumpcare.

@realDonaldTrump You hate freedom. You claim to love our flag and our anthem, but you despise the liberties they stand for.
@realDonaldTrump So far you've supported plans that take away healthcare for many and increase costs for all. Calling something great alone won't make it so.
@realDonaldTrump A great Healthcare bill will be great if it covers more Americans, reduces costs, and results in better health across the nation.

@lakechristar73 @mattredmond22 @TomiLahren The right think that racism is over, claim it is, deny the existence of racial inequality. That's one of the most racist things you can do.

@TomiLahren He does not just speak poorly, but demonstrates his unfitness for office by flaunting his ignorance of history, diplomacy and the law!
@TomiLahren He supports healthcare reform that hoists HC entirely from millions of Americans and makes it harder to afford for millions more.
@TomiLahren His policies threatened to stagnate the distribution of wealth further in our country and end our tradition of upward mobility
@TomiLahren If only his lack of eloquence was where it ended! Trump is dividing our country against itself, and escalating tensions with our adversaries
@TomiLahren Denying the existence of inequality based on race or sex in this country?
@TomiLahren What does the GOP stand for? Helping wealthy elites while the rest of us become wage slaves? Destroying any prospects of upward mobility?

@realDonaldTrump You're unworthy of the presidency!  You shouldn't be president!  You're a stain on our history! You bring shame on our nation!
@realDonaldTrump You wanted to make healthcare great by insuring fewer people at higher premiums!!  Your idea of a great bill or America is questionable AF!

@BoucheTimothy Mmhmm, I suppose you're right about that, and you know I'm sure that you valid reason that are very important to you for disagreeing with me
@BoucheTimothy Furthermore, the very fact that this guy got this stuff means we need more strenuous laws. If he were the only no, but he isn't.
@BoucheTimothy He passed his background check for the weapons sure. I didn't say he didn't. I was talking about bullets.
@BoucheTimothy Seriously dude, its entirely unnecessary, and unproductive to be a dick.
@BoucheTimothy Are you nasty to everyone or just people on the internet?
@BoucheTimothy See you at the gathering of the juggalos.
@BoucheTimothy This is mean spirited, intellectually lazy rhetorical masturbation that changes no minds and means nothing.
@BoucheTimothy I'm simply a compasioned, concerned person who loves my country.  There is no need to be nasty.
@BoucheTimothy What's your goal here? What does deliberately quoting me out of context accomplish?
@DonnyFerguson You're all about moving forward through conflict resolution and mutual respect!
@DonnyFerguson Donny, you exude charity and kindness! Maybe you could be Chris's wise cracking SS side kick!
@Colonel_Ice84 @_thymes @MotherJones Yes, 5.56 and .223 not high powered. I misspoke! Got it! Agreed.
@smarmyEOD @hboulware Surely we can reduce it though! I like what you said below. Throwing up our hands and saying nothing can be done surely isn't the answer.
@smarmyEOD @hboulware You make a really enlightening point! Honestly, nicely said. Love it!
@smarmyEOD @hboulware I can get behind this a 100%
@rodgers_jeff @hboulware And I think you should continue enjoying your guns.
@ogdezntz @RubgyFan @MotherJones You over simplify everything in your life to this degree?	Sounds pretty simple. Black and white are the only colors you need.
@TheRealMcKeever @_thymes @MotherJones Wow, that must be really expensive!
@Roadboy1989_Alt @MotherJones Right right, this is a fresh and expansive point you make. I am enlightened by this new and eye opening comparison.
@TheStrokingGun @MotherJones Thanks for your support.
@TheRealMcKeever @hboulware I also have an issue with gun supporters defending the status quo.
@TheRealMcKeever @hboulware You don't have to convince me they're used for other things! I enjoy target shooting, skeet and long distance.
@KesaraRiku @hboulware I mean I do think Honduras is probably the standard we should measure ourselves against.
@Trunthepaige @MotherJones Yeah,unfortunately it looks as if the family's grief was exploited. Shop did no wrong. How do we redress the issue of this kind of violence?
@TheRealMcKeever @themanfronUNCLE @_thymes @MotherJones Clearly there is some debate over my nomenclature, and I don't mind conceding that more devasting ammo exists!
@hboulware You're right and you're wrong. We have an epidemic of murder facilatated by the ease with which people aquire level force, aka guns!
@hboulware You accuse me of intellectual laziness and that the best you can do? Be more creative!
@hboulware What can we do to make sure they are all used that way?
@hboulware Why do you defend the status quo when gun violence kills so many? Do you not care?
@hboulware I misspoke. They aren't high powered. One should need a BGC because they are used to kill people.
@DonnyFerguson What a mean spirited response! Having a credible opinion is tougher when you dismiss opposing views without consideration.
@DonnyFerguson I did speak in error in such a way that allowed people like you to dismiss me based simply on my previous ignorance of AR-15 specs.
@DonnyFerguson Some of the conversations Ive had on that thread have expanded my perspective. Your attempt to publically humilate me has not.
@DonnyFerguson Donny, I think its very unfair of you to call me a lunatic.
@eamelhorn @MotherJones A lot of people on here have made great points and my opinion continues to evolve. However the adhommid attacks are gross/ counterproductive
@eamelhorn @MotherJones Agreed!  I was reacting to so many fools expressing righteous indignation at the grief of a woman who lost her daughter.
@LSATgunner I enjoyed that! Really well said!
@g22dude11 @radical1979 @MotherJones That's a childish adhominid attack that makes a lot of assumptions and isn't really what's being discussed. You want to just call names now?
@MichaelaJoann @MotherJones That's a lucid, intelligent respectful answer! Thank you. I can get on board with that.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones If the deaths aren't acceptable to you, then why aren't you?
@g22dude11 @MotherJones Probably would be a good idea.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones I do not have to furnish a solution in order to point out a problem, and if you dont think we need a solution how can you claim to care?
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones Okay, so the violence is acceptable to you. You're unmoved and don't care if it goes on.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones No no, I am argueing that as a nation we need to work to find a solution. I am stating there is a problem to those defending the status-quo
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones You're denying that mass shootings are taking place?  The FBI is conspiring to create the appearance that these attacks are epidemic?
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones I believe you, and that is really troubling, because its not just James Holmes.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones Exactly, clearly more needs to be done. How will we curb the epidemic of mass shootings?
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones Clearly more needs to be done.  You wouldnt tolerate being inconvenienced if it meant saving lives?
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones I like to shoot. I'm a good marksman abd that's something I'm proud of. Several hundred rounds is all I can do or afford in a weekend.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones Clearly the existing laws don't keep weapons from crazy people. And I don't think this woman is wrong that more should have been done.
@Kaitain_FL @radical1979 @MotherJones I'm glad to hear that. Also, clearly I misspoke about the rounds power. I never said he used a machine gun.
@radical1979 @MotherJones It's thousands of dollars worth of hi powered rounds. Unless you're taking your machine gun to the range every weekend. Wow!
@radical1979 @MotherJones The gun shop should have records, even if he bought them over a period of time they'd by aware.
@radical1979 @MotherJones A background check helps, and should be required.
@_thymes @MotherJones I even went back and checked. Retailer sold 4k+ hi powered rounds without doing a background check with impunity.
@_thymes @MotherJones You want to elaborate on what I missed?
@MotherJones People with guns kill people, lots and lots of people. A gun is designed to quickly and efficiently end lives.
@MotherJones Gun retailers should not be able to dispense they're product to crazy people with impunity.
@MotherJones If a business can sell this kind of product to anyone in any quantity without establishing they're of sound mind, the law shoud be changed.
@MotherJones It was negligent and dangerous to sell those ammunitions in that number to anyone without a background check.

@TomiLahren Right, when it means GOP, is wrong. It is immoral and unChristian.  I believe that the GOP agenda is violent in nature, and evil.

@cmurray862 "Filthy people", I see now who I've wasted my time engaging. Sir I hope that one day compassion replaces your judgement &amp; hostility.
@cmurray862 One serious medical set back could easily cost 2 or 3 times what I earn in a year. Long term care, who knows. Should I die if I can't pay?
@cmurray862 @nicoleaelizalde @wallaberries @arXiv6174 It's ironic based on your chief complaints about the ACA that you so overestimate the altruism of others.
@cmurray862 @wallaberries @arXiv6174 Lots of hardworking people still require assistance and our society can't function without their work.

@realDonaldTrump When was the U.S. great?  When was it not great?  was the America that elected its first black president not great?
@realDonaldTrump Apparently from your own rhetoric you were elected to make America (not the U.S.) great again.  So when was it great?
Religious rights=the right to hate
So called Religious rights is a red herring issue that's really about enacted Jim-Crow-era-like discrimination against gay people.
So called "Religious rights" are just about Americans who want the federal government to let them violate other Americans' civil rights.
@realDonaldTrump denying Trangender youth their civil rights is how we make America great?
