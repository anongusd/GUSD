In announcing the end of the exercises, U.S. officials said a new, smaller operation will begin today. But they stressed the new exercise isn't a replacement, even though it looks like it. 		Why? They must thread the needle between reassuring Seoul and avoiding a political fight.

@MENA_Conflict Was there a monocle? Please tell me there was a monocle.
Checking back w/ sources after publication of that piece last month, I was told everything in it was accurate. But that doesn't mean this Times story is wrong, either. 		Did the more modest 3K withdrawal get scuttled? Did Trump stick with his original idea? Both good questions.
Military adviser convinced Trump a slower withdrawal made more sense now -- and then discussion of those talks went dark as negotiations with the Taliban continued.
That plan would have had a few thousand withdrawing this year -- but way less than 7K, as Trump directed in December and the Times now reports the Pentagon is doing. 		https://t.co/NL35yptj5T
Few details have emerged since about troop number discussions, while @US4AfghanPeace negotiates a potential peace deal with the Taliban. But multiple officials told me, @jdawsey1 and @agearan in January that the military was drawing up a more modest withdrawal.
First, it goes back to what was reported in December: That Trump wanted plans drawn up to withdraw about half of all forces. That directive came in the same meeting when he called for a withdrawal from Syria, prompting Mattis's resignation.

Former Green Beret soldier Matt Golsteyn on whether Trump could pardon him on a murder charge:		“We are playing for a court-martial. It would be pretty dangerous to be playing for a pardon, and then there is no pardon and we have to go to  court-martial.”		https://t.co/Eo6nCsnmBi
Matt Golsteyn planned to join the CIA and go to Iraq. Instead he faces a murder charge for a decision he made in Afghanistan nine years ago this month.		Here's my story after interviewing him.		https://t.co/Eo6nCsnmBi
I interviewed Matt Golsteyn, the former Green Beret whose murder case has captured the attention of President Trump. Here's what he was willing to say, and what he wasn't.		https://t.co/67rpYgLGna
I asked Golsteyn about that. He said he would be grateful for a pardon, but can't expect one is coming.		“We are playing for a court-martial," he said. "It would be pretty dangerous to be playing for a pardon, and then there is no pardon and we have to go to  court-martial.”
Because of @realDonaldTrump's expressed interest, there also is the question of what he does. Does he let this play out? Take over the case as commander in chief? Pardon Golsteyn if he disagrees with the outcome?
We also still haven't heard what Golsteyn said in his CIA job interview in 2010. Does it square with how the Army has characterized his actions? I've requested transcripts of both the job interview and the Board of Inquiry hearing Golsteyn faced. Neither have been released.
It's hard to say where this goes next.  The Army has alluded to having new evidence, but it has not clarified. Did someone in the unit start talking, after all these years? If so, are they credible?
More Golsteyn: "If it had been me, this guy’s ass would have beaten feet in a completely different direction.”
“If [he goes] any other direction of the 360 that you have available to you but mine, and he doesn’t meet me,” Golsteyn said. “He had been released, and are you going to go back to what you were doing? Or are you going to go somewhere else?"
Golsteyn still isn't shy of saying he killed the man in question. He described setting up an ambush position, but also was careful in answering some questions about it.
Here is that story.		https://t.co/mx8xheFsgK
That takes us to here. This week, I sat down on the record with Matt Golsteyn for about two hours in his work office near the White House. We talked about the deployment, the case, his family, and what he said during that CIA job interview. https://t.co/tnOcAaXOiU
Since then, supporters of Golsteyn, including his wife @GolsteynJulie and lawyer @pstackhouse have taken to the airwaves. They're angry. In a surprise, President Trump pledged on Twitter in December to review the case. Could a pardon happen? Hard to say.		https://t.co/lDRJgtyl8q
The case has stayed open ever since. And in December the Army did what it opted not to previously: It preferred a charge of murder against Golsteyn.		https://t.co/EMW9BQSlLu
Then, a decision: Golsteyn went on @FoxNews with @BretBaier and discussed the case as part of a story on rules of engagement. He acknowledged again killing a bombmaker. The Army re-opened its criminal investigation afterward.		https://t.co/bzSUTnIJBi
Golsteyn took what is known as "excess leave," preparing to leave the Army. He moved to Northern Virginia and took a job a few blocks away from the White House at @IAFFNewsDesk, a firefighters union.
The situation allowed Golsteyn to leave the Army with his benefits, in theory. 		https://t.co/t6AHlqi1bS
After days of arguments, a panel of three officers determined that the Army did not substantiate that Golsteyn violated the law of armed conflict. But it did find that he demonstrated conduct unbecoming of an officer. Split the difference, perhaps.		https://t.co/t6AHlqi1bS
Back to the case: After the Army sought to push Golsteyn out, he brought them to an administrative board known as a Board of Inquiry. @AmandaMOAA, then with @fayobserver, was there for much of the proceedings.		https://t.co/HKu6OUCzX0
Considering both the interest and the strangeness in the case, we also posted all of the investigative documents I obtained. They're posted here, along with excerpts.		https://t.co/OdqBldwwVg
The @washingtonpost put my story on Page 1 -- one of my first as a WaPo reporter. It's published here.		https://t.co/YmsPaHPew8
Shortly afterward, a surprise: The Army was releasing to me hundreds of pages of investigative documents about the case. Bottom line up front: They wanted to charge Golsteyn with murder, but didn't have the evidence. Soldiers refused to testify, even when offered immunity.
In May of that year, @theintercept dropped a surprise story about the case with a loud headline: “Documents: Green Beret Who Sought Job at CIA Confessed to Murder.”		The origin of those docs @jeremyscahill and Co. obtained is still unclear.		https://t.co/RKAwU8vfLQ
Meanwhile, I put in a FOIA request for documents related to Golsteyn. The system is notoriously difficult to work with. But I figured it certainly didn’t hurt to ask. Maybe I’d get lucky and be able to share a fuller understanding of the case.
Already, this sounds like something out of a movie. And then there was additional weirdness: @thedailybeast published a story saying Army CID agents had combed through the trash of Swenson, a Medal of Honor recipient. The target: Golsteyn.		https://t.co/SeeATxFYNX
Two days later, I determined the source of the investigation: In a job interview with the CIA ,Golsteyn had said something that triggered concerns and a report back to the Army. 		https://t.co/lUnu0dOWwk
Within a day or so of that initial story on Feb. 4, 2015, the Army moved "chapter" Golsteyn out of the military, effectively forcing him out. But its criminal investigation was still closed.
Read between the lines back then, and it was clear: This was likely a war-crimes investigation. The Army didn’t find enough evidence to bring charges, so it closed the investigation. Then it punished Golsteyn administratively instead.
Details were mysterious. But officials at least confirmed the investigation focused on a potential violation of the military’s oft-maligned rules of engagement in the death of a suspected insurgent.
Things quieted down publicly until 2015, when @Rep_Hunter disclosed that the Army decided that Golsteyn deserved neither the Silver Star nor the Distinguished Service Cross -- a very rare move. The Army confirmed it was true, citing an investigation.		 https://t.co/BZVLLWJyO3
Golsteyn was promoted to major, and he appeared at the White House in October 2013 as an old colleague, Will Swenson, received the Medal of Honor. Here's a photo from that day, released to me some time ago. https://t.co/glBo6XtmxL
That means that for a time, the Army recognized Golsteyn as one of the biggest heroes in the largest battle in the entire U.S. war in Afghanistan.
The story, like many large ones, has come out in waves. In 2011, he was awarded the Silver Star for valor in that battle in Afghanistan on Feb. 20, 2010. The Army later moved to upgrade it to a Distinguished Service Cross, one step down from the Medal of Honor.
For several years, I’ve been writing about the murder investigation of Matt Golsteyn, a former Special Forces officer who led both his own team and U.S. Marines during the hellscape that was the Battle of Marja in 2010.
It’s Saturday. It’s cold across much of the country. It seems like a good time to lay out reporting on a case involving Army Special Forces, U.S. Marines, the CIA and a war-crimes investigation that dates back years. There will be news.	 	 A thread:

We're 30 minutes into today's hearing. No one yet has said out loud that the deployment of active-duty troops to the border occurred just days before the midterm elections.
"It is the active-duty troops that caught the attention of this committee," @RepAdamSmith says. Says a hearing wouldn't have been called absent that.
What is the metric to determine that sending active-duty troops works? 		Gilday focuses on laying concertina wire and says it made it easier for CBP to dispatch its manpower more efficiently. "The fact that we hardened those ports of entry" is what he would point to, he said.
There are presently just over 2,300 active-duty troops at the border, Rood says.		Rep. Smith drills down on that, questions why it was necessary to send active-duty troops.

@Mel_Ankoly @fawfulfan That is what the reporting in this story says, too.

@lesley_stover @mikepinkshoes @KurtSchlichter Again, in context: If I as a journalist request records for public release from the Vietnam era from DOD, I get sent to National Archives (which is indeed shut down) and told to FOIA. The rest of this is irrelevant &amp; unrelated. That was my point, and it is my point. Good night.
@RIred61 @KurtSchlichter Sigh. I'm not arguing that at all. Try again.
@DROCNCPF_Guy @JackJolis And yet: I mean it each time and it's not getting through.
@RadioFreeTom She's not wrong.
@lesley_stover @mikepinkshoes @KurtSchlichter Bottom line: Kurt was trying to call out journalists for not already having a DD 214. I factually explained why they wouldn't immediately be available to a journalist. I appreciated hearing how the rules are different in your capacity. But they are certainly different.
@willsigner74 @lesley_stover Getting someone else's DD 214 without their consent as a journalist -- which is what we I originally was talking about -- requires knowing their full name, birthdate and at least a partial social security number. It's doable, but it takes time.
@mikepinkshoes @lesley_stover @KurtSchlichter In context: I explained how these requests work for media, based on years of seeking these sorts of records for public release. Can point to numerous examples. Lesley replied with how they work in her case, which is a different situation. It isn't the same.
@HillbillyFamily Stands to reason. He is a limited-purpose public figure in this case.
@Ronnie_D_Lynch @KurtSchlichter Good to know. Also not how a FOIA request by media gets handled.
@mikepinkshoes @lesley_stover @KurtSchlichter No. It's not.
@WalterOnstad @lesley_stover She was not aware of the system of rules through which journalists work.
@Burghgirl69 Glad to hear it. Media requests from that era get referred to National Archives.
@JackJolis Glad to hear it. My point was and is: DOD refers media requests like this to National Archives.
These wings taste extra salty. https://t.co/VkFQ6qzEGt
@Guerrilla_Magoo Can't tell you how often that has jammed me up. Most records affected appear to be Army.
@JerrySisco A journalist will be referred back to National Archives.
@Guerrilla_Magoo Overseen by National Archives. Yes.
@lesley_stover For the record, I'm explaining how media requests are handled. Been doing this for a while and thought it important to make the point that you can't just call DOD as a journalist and get decades-old docs in a hot minute. I would assume @KurtSchlichter hasn't seen that process.
@abbyohlheiser Hoy boy.
@lesley_stover If that's the case, I'm interested in the varying rules and release authorities. Media requests for old records get referred from DOD to National Archives routinely.
@Moltronic The Personnel Records Center in St. Louis is overseen by the National Archives, which takes the requests. These are the facts. I've put in dozens of requests like these with success.
@nerowolfegames As I said: National Archives is currently closed by the shutdown.
@Moltronic DOD retains records for a period of time. Then they are transferred to National Archives. I could point you to several stories where docs were released that way.
@KurtSchlichter Also: Perhaps it's time for you to acknowledge getting a DD-214 takes time and thus won't be plastered anywhere now. You know. In good faith.
@dogstar7tweets My job is to focus on facts with objectivity. That's often uncomfortable.
@KHShan Simply explaining process here dispassionately and accurately.
Getting back to the National Archives piece of this, here is their website right now. https://t.co/LPQouE4B0X
3) There are things in stories that raised an eyebrow. But there are times where that is less the fault of an interview subject and more the fault of a reporter who misunderstood.		4) I've done my fair share of stories about stolen valor allegations. Caution always wise.  2/2
Points of order on Nathan Phillips and his military history:		1) DOD won't have his records. He served too many years ago. Thus, it will likely take time and a FOIA request to see his DD-214 docs.		2) National Archives should have those docs. They're closed by the shutdown.  1/ https://t.co/eim836ON9h

The discussions continue after one of the largest advocates of a significant, enduring presence in Afghanistan -- Jim Mattis -- has resigned. Trump has sought recently to tie the military stalemate in Afghanistan to Mattis, rather than assigning blame to himself.
The military has been incredibly quiet about all of this over the last few weeks. Ask a drawdown question, and you almost invariably get referred to the White House.
. @jdawsey1 and I have the story, with help from @agearan and @missy_ryan.		Last month, the president sought plans to cut the number of troops roughly in half from about 14,000. Now it's looking like the number coming home won't be up to 7,000, but about half that.

@twoknifehands Thanks. In karaoke, I'm a Bon Jovi enthusiast. My theory is you go where your vocal range takes you.
Here's hoping the sleuths chasing this mariachi performance keep that in mind. 		I, of course, also performed before the night was over. Barry White. 		It was not one of my better showings, and there were a few cameras running.		All these years later, guess that's ok, too.  9/9
I wish I had video. But you know. Off the record. 		Later, I asked for permission to move Kent's performance in a profile as he retired. "Sure!" he said with a grin. "I wanted to show that it's ok for Marines to have fun."		8/
The first one to the microphone? One Carlton Kent. He sang "My Girl," then "Chicken Fried" with his staff, "Team 16."  17/
They took a risk... a gusty one, considering Gen. McChrystal had been fired not that long before. 		There was beer.		And eventually, karaoke.  6/
At night, we stayed at a nice hotel in Tbilisi, and the Marines made plans to go out to some Irish pub along with some of the Marines stationed nearby. Of course, there's a question: What do you do with the damn reporter?  5/
Seeing the countryside in Georgia was an eye-opener. Three years after Russians had invaded part of the country, I was struck by beaten down everything looked.  4/
It was a challenging time for the Corps. Marines were fighting and dying in Helmand, and so were the Georgians, who had battlespace in the northern part of the province. 3/
Back in 2011, I was with @Marinetimes and traveling with the 16th sergeant major of the Marine Corps, Carlton Kent. Multi-stop trip in Germany, Spain and the Republic of Georgia.  2/

Here's today's Syria story via @karoun. Hard to assess how much different the administration's message will look in a month, week, day or a few hours. 		https://t.co/ctIyA3MwTK
@Jinxy_Minxy If true -- that detail was based on one source, so more reporting needed there -- it is not a surprise that an administration would force out a departing defense secretary's chief of staff if he wanted to stay. 		A new secretary almost always brings in his own chief of staff.
Kevin Sweeney's departure from the Pentagon is neither a surprise nor particularly noteworthy. He was Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's chief of staff, not Acting Pentagon chief Pat Shanahan's. It's normal for someone in Sweeney's position to leave, too.
Sounds about right. https://t.co/Fj0MaUQvch

@maggieNYT It wasn't "fake news." Confirmed, as far as we're concerned. More likely, either Trump or Webb moved on from the idea.
Trump says Jim Webb won't be Pentagon chief, and the admin says he could keep Pat Shanahan as acting SECDEF indefinitely.		Is that legal? The answer appears to be yes... but with caveats.		@missy_ryan and I here, with help from @jdawsey1 &amp; @John_Hudson.		https://t.co/JK2S0ApiGj

The Gibson job -- chief management officer -- is held on a temp. basis by Lisa Hershman. However, she didn't have to go through a confirmation before. So Norquist hops up to take the "performing as" role of the No. 2, and she keeps the "performing as" role of the No. 3.  7/
The No. 1 job right now is held on an acting basis by Shanahan. With Shanahan moving up, the No. 2 job role is carried out by David Norquist, the comptroller.		That's because the Pentagon's No. 3, John "Jay" Gibson, was removed from his job last fall.  6/

Unsolicited, administration officials just sent an anonymous statement in which they sought to give President Trump credit for the Coast Guard finding money to pay its people this month amid the #shutdown.

@mkgillman @USAA Yes, absolutely.
Not only were most of these Coast Guard family members willing to talk, they were eager to do so. They wanted this story spread far and wide. https://t.co/yKVsauxrbY
@andykravetz It did not.
Among those I talked to for this story: 		- A family with a child who has a heart defect in Texas		- A family with four kids trying to pay rent in San Diego		- a family still paying for expenses after typhoons in Guam. https://t.co/yKVsauxrbY
@7bestoftimes I hear you. But an enlisted Coastie turning a wrench on a ship also is exactly that, without returning home every night. Different circumstances, all tough.
Among the friction points with Coast Guard families right now when it comes to the shutdown is a change in the loans that @USAA offers those affected. A company spokesman says they have "redesigned" what is available to make it more flexible... but now it requires interest.
The Coast Guard just announced that will pay its service members through this week. But talk to families involved, and you'll still hear worry and frustration. 		Their question: Why is the service being treated differently than the rest of the military?		https://t.co/izfecaCjo1

Thornburg just showed up at Holly's house with his TV cameras and is totally about to blow up McClane's spot. Somebody really needs to punch him in the face.
The power is out at Nakatomi.		The FBI "has the universal terrorist playbook, and they're running it," so the safe just opened. 		The terrorists/thieves are wishing each other Merry Christmas, despite people who are wrong saying this is not a Christmas movie.
"Only John can drive somebody that crazy."  -- Holly Gennaro		Also, McClane's feet, man.
I'm counting rounds coming out of the automatic rifle that McClane commandeered. Way more than 30. Plot hole!

Takagi's brains just got sprayed all over a glass wall. RIP.		McClane is hoping that Argyle heard the shots, but nah.
Why do terrorists want $640 million in bonds? Better yet, why is there all that loot in a vault here at Nakatomi?
Takagi is a goner. We all know it. Matter of time.
McClane is armed and free, but barefoot. Made it up to the floors still under construction. Meanwhile, Gruber is pontificating to party guests about the Nakatomi Corp.'s "legacy of greed."
McClane is making "fists with his toes" in the carpet, still clueless. But the phone lines just got cut during another conversation with Argyle, and now there is automatic weapon fire. Send help!
"I love Alan Rickman," is the general consensus in this room. But I think that's because of Love Actually or Harry Potter, so all bets are off.
Hans Gruber and his crew are rolling up and the security guard at the front counter just bought the farm. It's all downhill from here.
John just entered the Christmas Party at Nakatomi Plaza. "You throw quite a party," John tells Holly's boss. "I didn't know they celebrated Christmas in Japan."

@fanofwalt @KatrinaPierson Sure. And the tweet isn't.
Dunford still anticipates completing his full term as chairman, scheduled to end about Oct. 1. Mattis's resignation letter alluded to the chairman staying on for stability, but that's obviously not his call.  		Ryder referred additional questions to the White House.  3/3
A spokesman, Air Col. Patrick Ryder, declined to comment on how the chairman first learned the news. Dunford's office, of course, has long sought to avoid politicization of the military, so I wouldn't read too much into that.  2/

@trc6111 Definitely were some imedia in Syria -- some did extremely courageous work without U.S. embed. Aside from battlefield circulations with generals, U.S. military access there was/is nearly non-existent, even on static bases set up months/years ago. Opportunities missed.
@trc6111 Those journalists who were executed were not embedded when kidnapped. They were on their own.		There always has been a risk of injury or fatality while embedded. All of us who do so grapple with it, and do our own calculus on what makes sense. Doesn't change my argument above.
@PhilDavis_CG Amen.

@G_Trowbridge Point taken, and that seems like a reasonable argument to make in 2014. Host-nation issues remained a concern afterward, but it also stands to reason the U.S. held more cards when it came to shaping the landscape. 		Also, media embed with SOF. There are just more restrictions.
There are many nuances to the discussion of what the U.S. should do in Syria, and how far into that effort the nation is. But there's also this: When access is restricted, so is coverage and awareness. That can be a convenient thing. But it also has consequences. 3/3
Now U.S. defense and foreign-policy officials find themselves scrambling to explain why Trump's decision to withdraw the majority, and perhaps all, troops from Syria is a bad idea.  2/
For years dating back to the Obama era, the Pentagon has limited embedded media access in Syria and Iraq -- something it provided during an earlier war to make its case to the American people that what it was doing was important and, on the whole, well done.  1/

At sea, the Coast Guard and the Navy are both examining how they may need to tweak their Arctic strategies to account for changes in the climate. Less ice means ships not ruggedized for ice can travel farther north more often. 10/
As we go into in this story, the Pentagon is adding more fighter jets elsewhere in Alaska. Ground forces also increasingly are looking to use the state’s massive, frosty training ranges, where you have to think about how to store your rifle so it doesn’t freeze up. 9/
Unalaska is one of the most interesting places I have visited in the United States. It has eye-popping cliffs, hundreds of bald eagles and a fishing culture that dominates everything. Also has sights like this – a World War II-era machine-gun emplacement out front of a hotel. 8/ https://t.co/ZMftc3DKM0

The Battle of Dutch Harbor occurred in June 1942. Today, that same harbor has stunning scenery, a designated parking space for the Coast Guard and the most commercial fishing by volume of any U.S. port. It looks like this. 5/ https://t.co/058P3LU1VZ
Alaska has long been seen as a strategically important area. During World War II, Unalaska was bombed by the Japanese, becoming the only U.S. location aside from Pearl Harbor with that distinction. The U.S. knew an attack was likely for months. Just didn’t know when. 4/
That’s especially interesting in a place like Unalaska, Alaska, where Russian fur trappers encountered native Alaskans many years ago. The town, some 800 miles southwest of Anchorage, includes lots of Russian culture like this historicOrthodox church. 3/ https://t.co/iLYu74sJWg

Here's a video I recorded Sunday, just to give you a flavor of the Army's work on the Rio Grande. This occurred in Brownsville. https://t.co/ZQYXmu4kI9
Meanwhile, @mayaaverbuch sent in dispatches from Mexico. Most of the migrants she met in the caravan are escaping violence in Honduras and say they're planning to apply formally for asylum at a port of entry -- the legal way to do it, for the record.  8/
One good-natured soldier told me that he didn't really know whether to call his assignment a deployment or not. He's just there doing his job.		"This will kind of be like my deployment here, if you call it that,” he said.  7/

There's also the news that the initial migrant caravan has decided to head toward Tijuana, a very long way from South Texas. Those migrants won't be crossing the border here.  7/
The Army advertises that this operation will continue through Dec. 15. But I think it's a very open question whether 1,000 soldiers stay in South Texas that entire time. Some are still awaiting missions. A couple hundred, from what I could tell today.  6/
Soldiers also still laying concertina wire in some areas, and when I arrived at the airport the other night in Harlingen, I followed on the highway a convoy of about 20 trucks carrying Jersey barriers east, probably to a logistics hub the Army set up in the town of Westlaco.  5/
There are hundreds of soldiers staying on the camp in Donna, and about a 1,000 across South Texas. Some are busy. Today they were running bulldozers as they begin to build a temporary fuel farm to refuel vehicles, with a big rubber bladder eventually holding fuel.  4/
As can/should be expected, active-duty soldiers are staying away from talking about the politics of the operation. Most very concerned about saying the "wrong" thing, as also can be expected.  3/
Life is austere. No heat in most tents. Hot meals service began today, twice per day. Mud everywhere today, and with no gravel on the camp, it's messy.  2/

Gen. O'Shaughnessy, chief of @Norad_Northcom, was asked today at Pentagon to put the current active-duty military operation, Faithful Patriot, at the border in context.		"I don't want to comment on relative to the size and this size relative to historical precedent," he said. https://t.co/jMUQbjnrr1
@EdAlbanoski The National Guard sent members forward to Iraq, Afghanistan and other war zones. Some of the fought, bled and died. They're all military, and they all fall under DOD.
As explored here and in other places, all of this in "Operation Faithful Patriot" thrusts the military that much further into politics in the era of Trump -- something that both Mattis and Dunford have sought to avoid.  (End thread)		https://t.co/MgV1Fi2Xwi
With 15 minutes heads up, Gen. O'Shaughnessy of @Norad_Northcom spent about 15 minutes on the record with media today. Basic takeaway: While he said 5,200 active-duty troops will deploy yesterday, he added today that the number could still go up. No top end number provided.  7/
Troops also will have access to non-lethal weapons. What exactly isn't defined in the doc I saw. But assumedly, whatever MP units have could be part of it. DOD also is providing 500 "riot gear" sets to CBP officers.  6/
Key point: Troops at the border will be authorized to use lethal force. But that's in the event that they or someone else -- migrant or DHS both possible -- are in imminent danger. Still, it will be allowed, doc says.  5/
At this point, the military isn't expected to be screening migrants as they arrive. But that isn't 100 percent ruled out, either.  4/
Helicopters will mostly come from assault battalions affiliated with the 82nd Airborne Division, according to Pentagon doc. Also, "Role 2" medical units -- those that provide basic medical care -- are going. They will be on standby to treat law enforcement personnel.  3/
Deployments disclosed so far have mostly been Army, but they won't remain that way. According to a doc obtained, Marine Corps military police and a special-purpose task force headquarters, all from Camp Pendleton in San Diego, are deploying. 2/		https://t.co/MgV1Fi2Xwi

@soledadobrien I'm disappointed to see this from you @soledadobrien. You were a journalist, and hopefully know news when you see it. You know we can't ignore the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops. We can and have included the context.
@montanamajik @NickMiroff @washingtonpost It's the largest deployment of U.S. troops to the southern border in probably 100 years. It already began. We can and will include the context, but ignoring that sort of thing simply isn't an option or service to readers.
@USCAlumnus1 @bethreinhard @mattdpearce @NickMiroff You missed the answer right in her tweet: National Guard.
Paul's point is salient. Also notable that under Title 32, some governors could have/would have said no.

@Lkatzenberg I like to picture a Yankees fan laying out the page.
Eight days before the midterm elections, DHS and DOD officials are expected to announce more details about troop deployments to the southern border this afternoon.
A U.S. official with familiarity with discussions of military deployments to the border said that "thousands" of active-duty troops are expected to go. Asked about the @nancyayoussef report today saying about 5,000, the official said that it could be somewhat less -- or more.
All of this indicates a lack of inter-agency coordination -- and perhaps DHS wanting something large that the Pentagon is not in favor of providing. https://t.co/m4vvRw2M2p
