@Take5_OilChange another manager called me and said the GM was in the hospital. They are supposed to be trying to come by tomorrow now. This is an extreme inconvenience and I‚Äôve never had anything like this happen.
@Take5_OilChange fixed the problem. They claim they did not do anything with my transmission fluid although my receipt says otherwise. They then said they would send their GM to my house this morning to look at it and file a claim. Their GM did not come this morning. Instead,
@Take5_OilChange Clearly my transmission is toast. I went back to the Take 5 shortly before they closed since I could barely make it back on 35mph. They first would not admit any fault. In fact, the manager on duty said he could turn the Check Engine Soon light off to see if that
@Take5_OilChange within 45 minutes of my oil change, my ‚Äúservice engine soon‚Äù light came on. Within an hour after the oil change, my car was no longer drivable on the highway. I could not go over 40mph without the transmission slipping out of gear.
@Take5_OilChange  The attendant mentioned they had issues with some of the employees messing things up in the past but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Shortly after my oil change, I noticed my RPMs getting high but not high enough to cause a problem...

@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders I can only assume you must now be holding wal mart stock. Because when the discussion was about Mazzio‚Äôs you were all for it
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders In fact you said if companies couldn‚Äôt afford to pay 15$ then they shouldn‚Äôt be in business
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders Me personally yes I would be thrilled with JUST 4 billion in profits, but fine again a slight increase in goods is to be expected if done smartly the consumer would hardly notice it nor would they mind it. You were for this not to long ago
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders Sure they are but automation, and a global economy where rich corporations do everything they can to keep a stock price low have left very few options to people coming from impoverished communities.
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders No grocery buying, very few if any monthly bills.
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders With no family and no rent
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders Near zero. Again you want people off welfare you need to back a living wage for those on it. Otherwise don‚Äôt complain.
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders 15% off a 90 plus stock is not a benefit to the impoverished worker. I think advocates of a 15$ wage expect a REASONABLE increase in prices. We took the inflation to tacos and poor people can still afford those. What‚Äôs the percentage the minimum wage worker contributes to the 401
@dustylmarsh @hvactechcomm @SenSanders Who said decrease those benefits? And you bitch about people being on welfare but yet contest doing what needs to be done to get them off. No floor worker can afford a 90$ stock price nice try though.
@hvactechcomm @dustylmarsh @SenSanders Key phrase was a fraction of a percent, only rich people benefit from the stock price. 4 bil isn‚Äôt enough, 10-12$ an hour isn‚Äôt enough someone somewhere is going to have to give up something or keep them all on welfare.
@dustylmarsh @SenSanders 4 billion in profits is not enough? Fine how many products do they sell? Would a modest fraction of a percent markup spread across every product they sell not cover the wage increase while having little effect on the consumer and zero effect on profit margin?

@Bobby23266616 @MycaLynn @seanhannity Obama was  one of 6 presidents to win over 50% of the popular vote...did that twice.
@Bobby23266616 @MycaLynn @seanhannity Yeah Obama won by an electorate landslide. Got over 400.
@Bobby23266616 @MycaLynn @seanhannity preface that with "by the rights standards." He was the worst. But by the rights standards trump is the best, aka zero standards.
@MycaLynn @Bobby23266616 @seanhannity You two must have been in a coma the last eight years. Obama was treated like s$&amp;@ by the right.

@Busteranderso13 @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump That should've said 8 closing records in Dec 2013, 7 closing records in Nov 2013, and reached 15000 for the first time ever in 2013.
@Busteranderso13 @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump Ummmm ok. THE DOW HIT A RECORD HIGH IN MAY 2015. It hit 8 closing records in 2013 and set a record for points gained in a single year.
@myredcar @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump Now have a good night in fantasy land I got things to do on a Friday night besides discuss reality with a trump supporter.
@myredcar @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump You're ignorant of the subject. The Dow did its best under Bill Clinton. 2nd was Obama.
@myredcar @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump I'm not going to argue the point was her 401 k should've done well under Obama if it didn't blame whoever manages it.
@myredcar @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump No I didn't the Dow hit record highs under Obama
@myredcar @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump Smh...seriously? You just proved my point in your sentence.
@Yahtje @rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump It has everything to do with your 401k

@rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @MoffetMonnane @MazerAtta @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump You trump supporters continually prove to be ignorant, and continually prove you had problems with Obama simply because he was black.
@rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @MoffetMonnane @MazerAtta @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump We had a constructive debate. You put out false statements about your 401k. There is a lot of information saying trump is not a billionaire
@rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @MoffetMonnane @MazerAtta @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump He's not I'm glad you're finally admitting it.
@USAneedsTRUMP @MoffetMonnane @rzRollTide @MazerAtta @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump As if he knows how it's done üôÑ
@USAneedsTRUMP @MoffetMonnane @rzRollTide @MazerAtta @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump Yes the unemployment number was fake up until trump took office. Then it was a real number.
@rzRollTide @USAneedsTRUMP @jesse_hotovcin @realDonaldTrump It was just under 8k when Obama took office and 20k when he left so you should thank him for getting your shit back that the repubs stole.
