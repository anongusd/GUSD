@qariwa Thanks for the PS. The problem, Daniel, is that we need to point out the pernicious effect of lobbyist money in all cases, even when Israel's involved.		Not all mention of money and Israel comes from antisemitism. Money is used to influence policy; Israel's no different that way.

@JoshuaHol @noboa No argument here.
@JoshuaHol @noboa But, again, the left doesn't make a fetish of civility. That's my main point.
@JoshuaHol @noboa All kidding aside (I WAS kidding) the issue for me is the weaponization of civility by one corner of the Democratic space, which can itself act uncivil when challenged.		And, no, I'm not saying it's everyone in that space. But the "civility" crowd rarely calls out one of its own.
@JoshuaHol @noboa I have never claimed to be civil. You should know that, Josh! It's possible that I have mastered the art of disagreeing while being disagreeable.
@JoshuaHol I didn't erase that chunk. I just didn't assign this woman to it. Why? Because her overall behavior, as described, fit a familiar pattern.		Could the story have been misreported? Sure. Could my interpretation be flawed? Theoretically possible.😉 But that's how it looks to me.
@noboa @JoshuaHol Perhaps, but that's missing my initial point. Maybe "both sides do it," but one of those sides claims it's more civil than the other. 		The artificiality of that claim, and its strategic use, is noteworthy -- not the least, because it has worked so well in the media.
@JoshuaHol I find some of Tom Frank's writing instructive on so-called "centrism" as a blend of ideology, self-interest, and culture. That's a close to my definition as I can offer on the twitter medium.		I still believe, however, the slapper was a "centrist" by both our definitions.
@JoshuaHol Perhaps. But I'm talking about "centrism" as a culture, at least as much as I'm talking about it as an ideology.		It is a culture that takes deep offense at being questioned, no matter its ideology of the moment.
@JoshuaHol I don't think she slapped Bernie for racist reasons. That doesn't mean I think liberals can't be racist. On the contrary. That's why we have the phrase, "Some of my best friends are .." 		As for "centrist," I usually put it in quotes because the real center is more to the left!
@JoshuaHol Got a better one? 		I think that statistic tells us more about the weakness of certain polling data than anything else.
@JoshuaHol Disagree. But perhaps our disagreement comes from differing definitions of the word "centrist."		In any case, I don't think a liberal Dem would slap somebody for supporting Jesse Jackson.
The big banks' lousy online payment systems are a symptom of what, exactly?		Wells Fargo's system is terrible. Chase, where my mother banked, is even worse.(I handled her finances.) 		Why? Banks should be competing on their ability to handle digital transactions. But they're not.

In that sense, they're not as hypocritical as they might seem. They're reflecting an anthropological phenomenon; reinforcement of group rules and taboos.		Don't know if that makes them easier to tolerate or harder. Depends on your preference, I suppose.
The reason centrists can behave so badly and still complain of left "incivility" may simply be because, to them, there is nothing more uncivil than challenging the idea that they and their ideas are at the center of the political universe.

@nicolesandler We need to break the medical device monopoly and pass an expanded Medicare For All bill.		Musicianship aside, it's kind of hard to do our jobs without being able to hear.
@JSCCounterPunch Causality? Interesting question. Can't say it never happened, because it did -- once.
PS: About those medieval treatments: ENT docs today are amazed to hear some of the things they did -- like blowing a gas up through my sinuses under high pressure to force my eardrums back into position. I would belch green smoke afterwards.		It was not pleasant.
@vandiveerhayes Thanks. I know you know.
Our healthcare system needs work -- lots of work. And it's not just a matter of expanding coverage to include hearing care. We also need to break the monopolies that produce health goods -- or, better yet, produce them ourselves.		Oh, and ageism is real.		**end**
The result? Another $1100, to pay for a pair that allow me to be a musician. If my mother had not died and left a small amount of money, I doubt I could have afforded them.
Long story short: My coverage doesn't include hearing aids anymore. I went without them for as long as I could, but the idea of brain degeneration was too frightening. So I paid for this pair out-of-pocket. Music didn't sound right, though, so I tested them with my instrument.
It seemed as if some doctors took my hearing loss less seriously when my hair turned gray -- as in, "Older people don't hear. It's not important." But it is important. It's a human sense, and there are only five of them!
Since I watched my mother die a long, terrible death from dementia -- a process that mercifully ended for her last year -- this is a very personal issue for me. And, I'm still a musician, even if I don't gig much anymore.
The brain suffers when people can't hear properly. I'm not expressing this precisely, but it gradually loses the ability to process language. There is also research that suggests this may lead to other neurological problems, including dementia.
Why are they expensive? Because it's a monopoly-dominated industry with inordinate political influence, much like ... well, a lot of markets, but the closest parallel is probably Big Pharma. The cost of hearing aids isn't just an inconvenience. It's a medical tragedy.
At first, my employer-sponsored insurance handled my hearing loss like any other medical condition or disability. They paid for treatment, and even for hearing aids -- which, for anyone who doesn't know, are extremely expensive.
Then I gave up jazz training and played in loud rock bands for about ten years. Also not good for hearing. It first became clear I was hearing-impaired about 20 years ago.
ENT docs today are amazed to hear some of the things they did -- like blowing a   gas up through my sinuses under high pressure to force my eardrums back into position. I would belch green smoke afterwards.

Oops. i forgot to thread that story and have to restart. Sorry about that.

@JoshuaHol There's an important caution in these polls, sure. But the problem with polling an election issue before the campaign starts is that you're scoring a game that hasn't been played yet.
@JoshuaHol Of course people will make those arguments. I say that in the piece. But a poll that gives slanted info w/no room for debate or back and forth - for the political process - presupposes the outcome without allowing the process to occur. Dems would be foolish to take it seriously.
This opinion piece is important and spot-on. It's also exactly what I was talking about five years ago when I wrote in Salon that corporations like Facebook are "acquiring powers totalitarian governments of the past could only dream about." https://t.co/ICXwB6L4Uj
@1nicholedejesus @bearsandgiants 100 percent agree.
@marcorubio @staceyabrams There's an app for that.
@susanfoertsch Could be. I explore that possibility in the article.
@bearsandgiants Agreed. And doctors need to be freed from student debt so they're not under financial pressure to go into high-reimbursement specialties and are more capable of treating underserved populations.
@BMillRep True. How could I forget Geithner?
@libbycwatson Yeah, you're definitely right in that sense. 		You're also right that the public option isn't an alternative. There's a viral nature to private insurance -- given any opening, it will always seek to undermine the public sector.
Some Democrats are backing off #MedicareForAll because of a badly designed poll that skewed the outcome.		I explain why here. https://t.co/dCZcwegmnQ

@nickbatz I hear Axelrod's a nice guy, but re making videos w/Rove: Yeah, it's cynical. Rove is dirty and unethical.
@matthewstoller @MattBruenig Parachute any one of us into any neighborhood in the United States and let us make that case one-on-one. We'd prevail.		The problem is the intermediaries who are tasked with presenting this to the voters -- politicians as well as media.
Why is anyone surprised that Bill Burton signed on to be Smithers to Howard Schultz's Mr. Burns? Plouffe went to Uber, Messina helped the UK austerity conservatives, and Axelrod's doing videos with Karl Rove.		The Obama team was filled with cynics and opportunists.

@EaleyGregory @aaronjmate If you hate scenes like that as much as I do, help us reach as many voters as we can in 2020. If you’d rather indulge stereotypes or marinate in the judgement of others than fight for every vote — black, brown, and white — please reconsider.
Honest question for people who love stereotyping and condemning Republican voters:		Do you want to beat Trump, or “enjoy” another four years of him? Because if you want to beat him, that sure ain’t the way to do it.
@EaleyGregory @aaronjmate Trump’s voters include some members of minority groups. Here’s one citation, for Hispanics, but he had other voters of color as well: https://t.co/ng41Phs9qF		They weren’t all racist white folks. Which pretty much proves my point.

This is an ugly smear against Sanders voters. Nothing in this “evidence” suggests voters backed him because he was white or male.

I am, however, getting a kick out of seeing people who condemned Bernie supporters for backing a white man running against a woman deciding that it would not be all that bad if the next nominee were ... a white man running against a black woman, a black man, and two white women.

@nickbatz @reveal My point's pretty simple: He didn't choose to leave over the many matters of principle he could have (and should have) taken a stand on. He's leaving over a small troop withdrawal instead. That's no reason to celebrate his "ethics"; he's not an ethical person.
@nickbatz @reveal We need intense diplomacy in that region if we are to save the Kurds. Mattis didn't recommend that, and he should have.		We're not going to get that diplomacy from Trump, of course -- but 2,000 soldiers won't change that.
@reveal And, in the end, why did Mad Dog leave? Not over the Muslim ban, the  incarcerated children, or even using troops for border theater. He wanted to keep 2,000 troops in harm's way with no exit plan.		"Can't serve both Trump and America"? Mattis did neither. https://t.co/X23EqZEV3I
For all the liberals pining for the loss of Mad Dog Mattis: His military advice was lousy, he never met a war he didn't like, and (as a @reveal piece pointed out) he may well have committed war crimes.	https://t.co/rZMCsRT6ri

@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis Reminds me of the time a Fedex person in the Midwest insisted I fill out a customs form for a package I was sending ... to Puerto Rico.
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis I agree 100 percent about overusing the label, but I don’t see that here.		Of course, .@aravosis could apologize and retract and this would all be moot. But if he doesn’t, I will remain convinced that he is a bigot — or something worse.
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis Also, I don’t think hate is a necessary prerequisite for racism. Distortion of a people’s identity for political purposes is also racism, regardless of sentiment.
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis Honest question, Larisa: what do you call it when a person refuses to acknowledge that history after it is brought to his attention — in this case, for political reasons?
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis I agree that ignorance of history is not racism. But a refusal to be educated crosses the line for me, and that is what I see here.		The added fact that it’s being done to score partisan political points makes it even worse. We’ve been in this place before.
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis I should add: I wrote this because Arsvosis doubled down on his comment, rather than back off, when challenged.		The first tweet isn’t necessarily anti-Semitic, but the subsequent refusal to acknowledge Jewish history is.
@larisa_a @davidsirota @aravosis I consider it anti-Semitic to deny the reality of the pogroms - the rapes, the mirders, the torching of villages. It’s denialism — denying the reality of the Jewish people.		If Aravosis acknowledges this and apologizes, I’ll write it off as stupidity.  If not, it’s anti-Semitic.
Everything old becomes new again. https://t.co/GpXFryo19B
@davidsirota I thought nothing could surprise me anymore, but .@aravosis ‘s refusal to acknowledge that Jews fled pogroms and weren’t considered Russian is openly anti-Semitic.		I remember my grandmother’s horror stories all too well, but apparently that means nothing to people like him.

Don't like "fake news," Trump, racism, voter suppression, religious/anti-gay bigotry, endless war, anti-immigrant hate, or 48% of the electorate not voting? 		Me neither. So stop saying that what this country needs is more "bipartisanship" with the architects of this reality.
Voters can sense when leaders don't take their needs and concerns as seriously as they do each others'.		Our political reality's been shaped by many factors. One of the biggest is disaffection with the elite consensus that has brought us endless war, inequality, and injustice.
Sentimental remembrances of Bush 41, especially from Dems and the press, reflect the moral vacuum at the heart of our governing elites -- where in-group civility means everything and the human consequences of one's deeds mean nothing. 		Ethics? Don't even think about it.
To anybody in politics or media who eulogizes Bush 41 as "a good man," or "decent," or "the kind of leader we need again in Washington":		Thanks for Trump.

Schumer &amp; Clinton voted for a 2006 fence bill that created 650 miles of "enormous steel bars embedded in concrete ... reach a height of 18ft (an) loom over the landscape, forming teeth-like slats that split farmland, slice through backyards, and sever parks and nature preserves."
Did every mainstream Democrat suddenly decide it's time to offer a "kinder, gentler" anti-immigration message? And do they think that "fences" are more humane than walls? They must, since so many voted for border fencing in 2006.		No fences. No walls. Support all asylum seekers. https://t.co/UgywNtEUsM
@PoliticsScale Complete nonsense.
@jasonvmiller @Laroarmay @nataliesurely @elonmusk @SpaceX I don't hate anybody! I do think Musk's a showman with less to him than meets the eye. But I've met him, and we had a perfectly pleasant conversation.		I support space exploration but don't agree with his approach, and I think these decisions should be made by society.
@jasonvmiller @Laroarmay @nataliesurely @elonmusk @SpaceX You ask the right question, but we differ on the answer. Musk has siphoned public money for his own gain and has not provided commensurate value for the billions received. He's not funding this work. We are - directly, through NASA, and indirectly through tax and other policies.
@GunnelsWarren Right. And nearly 4 out 5 new FDA approvals are for drugs that duplicate what other meds already do. Even Big Pharma's R&amp;D is focused on ways to maximize profits, rather than on curing conditions that are untreated today.		https://t.co/R4ZxBkF3Qu
@spaceflightdan @cstross @1aprildaniels @nataliesurely SpaceX was rescued from bankruptcy by a last-minute government contract for $1.6 billion. It's received some $5.5 billion in government contracts. It's now valued at $21 billion. You can't separate its contracted work from its current financial status.		https://t.co/pDFKeOYTMe
@Laroarmay @nataliesurely Thanks for an interesting thread. I think you make some good points. But I also think we need to separate the idea of publicly-funded space development from what's broken about military procurement, which is massive. There	have also been well-funded, well-managed public projects.
@Skibadaa @nataliesurely I love it when I encounter genuine mind readers. The real ones are so few and far between.
@WinningWordsPro Thanks, Jill!
@cstross @1aprildaniels @nataliesurely Happy to hear more, Charlie.
@Laroarmay @nataliesurely Still blows my mind that people don't understand basic economics: Starve govt w/tax cuts &amp; other policies that promote inequality &amp; monopolies, even as govt tech creates billionaires. Then fund billionaires' space playthings, which gives them control over our tech future - again.
I'd almost forgotten the sycophantic devotion Elon Musk inspires in some online folks.		Free your mind; your tl will follow.

2/2 (typo fixed) By linking "cultural Marxism" with identity politics, Brooks also reveals an ignorance of real left/liberal divides - esp. between those who believe class &amp; identity politics are in conflict and the (probably larger) group that sees them as complementary.
1/2 By using the phrase "cultural Marxism," David Brooks has adopted a trope that literally began with the Nazis (do a search for "Kulturbolschewismus") and has deep antisemitic roots. I doubt he knows that -- but that raises its own concerns, doesn't it?

@nataliesurely Musk fans take note:		(1/2) We were already exploring space in the 1950s and 1960s, until our economy was redirected toward downsizing government and spawning a new billionaire class. The fact that THEY'RE now exploring space tells us more about society than it does about them.

@iZhivko I completely agree.
10/10 You have to really hate the idea of cancelling student debt if you're willing to sacrifice 1,000,000+ jobs and economic growth for all on whatever principle makes you oppose it. It's working people who will suffer if you succeed, not the people you consider undeserving.
9/10 A Levy Institute study shows that cancelling all student debt would create more than a million jobs per year for several years, and would grow the entire economy. Which means:
8/n  Going forward we need tuition-free higher education for all (I'd add support for living and other expenses). Retrospectively, we need to make it right for 44 million who took on this debt individually because we didn't want to do it as a nation &amp; deceived them in the process
7/n This was done so that federal &amp; state govts could de-invest in higher education, leaving students holding the bag. 		The fair thing to do is to recognize that student debt holders believed us, followed the rules, and got trapped in debt. We need to make that right.
6/n For more on the fact that college debt doesn't pay for itself, see this Roosevelt Institute report from .@EconMarshall and Julie Morgan Margetta. https://t.co/xB28Pu7r4j 		Society abdicated its responsibility to educate and placed the burden on the young. And it deceived them
5/n Worse, means testing ignores the moral injustice behind today's student debt. People accumulated student debt on a massive societal lie. College degrees aren't the road to wealth people have been told they they are. This is part of a intergenerational con job.
4/n Really rich families didn't take out student debt, so debt cancellattion doesn't help the ultra-rich. Some people did well after getting their degrees, but the only way to exclude them is through means-testing, as Leonhardt suggests. But means-testing is a rabbit hole.
3/n Many people with student debt never graduated, so they aren't reaping the supposed financial benefits of an education. This is especially true in communities of color, which were targets for predatory for-profit colleges.
2/n Leonhardt says that student debt cancellation would primarily benefit the white &amp; wealthy, but communities of color are especially hard-hit by student debt. Overall, student debt is more severe for African Americans and for lower-income people from all groups.
1/n) Some thoughts on David Leonhardt's criticism of student debt cancellation, which is well-intentioned but I believe is wrong. It can be found here: https://t.co/LVd0DS3s2a

@Econ_Marshall @JonButter2 @vicfromqueens @SeanMcElwee Good point. After all, it's worked out so well so far.
@JonButter2 @Econ_Marshall @vicfromqueens @SeanMcElwee What's especially striking is the way a thin veneer of objectivity is so often applied to such wildly assumptive and biased language -- in this case, about "the kids" etc. etc.		Surely they could do just a little bit better than that.
@DukeGreene @willmenaker @davidsirota 3/3) If someone has to take 8 hours off - to take a bus to a distant polling place and then wait 5-6 hours to vote - politicians better give 'em a damn good reason to vote.		These barriers also target voters of color. It's hard to raise a kid, work, and still cast your ballot.
@DukeGreene @willmenaker @davidsirota 2) In addition, there was a notable drop-off in turnout among voters of color between 2012 and 2016. But that can't be taken in isolation, either. Even voters still on the rolls have to face race-based (as well as class-based) barriers to voting.
@DukeGreene @willmenaker @davidsirota 1) For sure. Voters of color have faced massive, organized systematic disenfranchisement, with very little outcry from white elites. 		Their silence -- especially from people who talk about "civility" and "norms" all the time -- has been deafening.
@willmenaker @davidsirota There is also an unspoken racial dimension to this critique. While people usually name and shame Jill Stein voters, it also implicitly condemns the voters of color who stayed home in 2016 and might have changed some swing state outcomes.
@willmenaker @davidsirota Nor should anyone countenance scolding from people who insisted that the most unpopular Democratic candidate in history was the only electable one.		This tactic exists to 1) to blame the powerless, rather than the powerful; and 2) to avoid taking personal responsibility.

@soapboxdiatribe You had the right idea.
@MattBruenig @yeselson I read the misread of Medicare For All as willful, but I could be wrong. It may just be the perpetual vanity of someone who  only sees his own reflection in any pane of glass.
@yeselson AOC doesn't challenge PK's sense of entitlement, or his sense that he knows who the right people are to run the country.

After great wins for @Ocasio2018 &amp; others, it's time for her, @DemSocialists, @OurRevolution, and everyone else to double down and work twice as hard going forward.
But I solved it: I DID use the credit card, to avoid the penalty. I spent $1 to buy Mike Davis' new book on Marx in ebook form from Verso, the left-wing publisher. Now it goes back on the shelf.
I haven't used my Sears credit card for a while. They threatened to lower my credit limit if I didn't use it by today, which would hurt my credit rating and make my cost of borrowing go up. That's how they trap you.

@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas We've been organizing around that issue. It's likely to be devastating.
@PJA9 I suggest you look at the stats before rendering your judgement. Also, I never said "mostly poor folks."
@PJA9 No, it isn't means-tested. And, as I've explained, it mostly helps lower- and middle-income folks. It's like Social Security, which everyone who's paid into it receives regardless of income. If you don't want the rich to receive a free ride from govt programs, raise their taxes.
@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas I can only give you my answer to that: by building alternative media sources that are truthful and morally grounded, like my program. I call it "the media revolution we need so the political revolution can succeed." (Forgive the internal rhyme; I get carried away sometimes!)
@PJA9 Lots of new ideas have triggered the idea that people would "laugh." Means-testing social programs is expensive and cumbersome, and rarely saves as much as it costs. Social Security, Medicare, public education, clean water, etc. -- not means-tested.
@SusanofTexas @ICEKweenKamala I couldn't agree more. Don't follow candidates; build movements. We don't need another hero, as Tina Turner once wisely noted. We need a movement of them.
Clear thread on trade war w/China from .@matthewstoller. https://t.co/Ha6VygTQ03
@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas True. Good point.
@SusanofTexas @ICEKweenKamala I'm a persuader by nature and vocation, Susan. I've never known a movement in history that persuaded people by blaming them. And I've known too many good people who've been lied to and manipulated. I'd rather convert them than judge them. But maybe that's just how I'm wired ...
@PJA9 African-American communities carry the heaviest burden of student debt. Working-class people are more likely to borrow for college than the wealthy, and the percentage of high-income student debt holders is quite small.
@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas When I say it's "not as true as it sounds," I mean that there are circumstances where a vigilant population can avert dictatorship. I appreciate Staples' call for vigilance. But it's rarely as clear-cut as that statement makes it sound.
@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas When you're denied access to information, democracy is denied. When you're given the choice of two candidates, and neither supports a non-oligarchical democracy or policies that help working people, democracy is denied -- and the seeds of dictatorship are planted.
@ICEKweenKamala @SusanofTexas It's an ahistorical viewpoint. Dictators have seized power by hijacking the military, and/or the media, and/or the economy. There's a little "blaming the victim" mentality going on here.
@JSCCounterPunch We're not disagreeing. I'm talking about the people who insisted on running an historically unpopular and anti-left candidate against Trump, and who now blame everyone but themselves for Trump's election -- especially the left.

I should know better, but I'm still surprised when smart people on social media are quick to say "You're stupid!" when challenged, rather than "Perhaps I didn't make myself clear" -- or even, "Let's discuss it."
@DrTomD_OG @davidrkadler True, it's a weak measure. But I suspect that the problem isn't that extremists self-identify as  moderate, at least in the US. Self-described centrists could be more invested in preserving the status quo from democratically-driven change. But the matter needs further study.

@jayrosen_nyu I lived through it &amp; studied it too. Again, perhaps your meaning is not clear to me &amp; we're talking past each other. But if you're arguing that the secrecy, violation of law &amp; norms, and chaos are without precedent, I'd say the first 2 began in '72 and chaos descended circa '74.
@jayrosen_nyu Not if I understand you correctly, but perhaps your meaning wasn't clear (at least to me). If you're saying the term "White House" no longer reflects a coherent whole -- an administration, or the Executive Branch -- that whole didn't exist while Watergate was underway either.

On reflection, I could have said all this more succinctly if I'd said: The only think wrong with Philip Roth's best work is Philip Roth.
My answer is, No, it isn't. There's a frequency of hope that you can't hear. I can't hear it either, any more than I can hear a dog whistle. But the other dogs hear it, and I trust them.		Goodbye, Philip.
Roth reflected that endlessly disaffected side of the 20th century American spirit that Lieber and Stoller captured so well when they asked, and Peggy Lee sang, "Is that all there is?"
It felt like a low-decibel whine as I read him, just under hearing range. It would slowly increase as I kept reading until it became noticeable, and then painful. 		It's a personal thing I can't explain or defend. But it never went away.
Sure, I can point to some obvious things -- misogyny, and unwarranted bitterness, and unquenchable ambition, to name three -- but there also was something about his ... his mental frequency, for lack of a better description, that didn't mesh with mine.
Whenever I spent time in Roth's head I became depressed. There were often headaches. 		I can't say why, exactly.

@whca The @whca doesn't appear to understand that "civility" is one of the ways DC culture suppresses free speech in US journalism. It's considered "uncivil" to criticize war policy, political corruption, or conflicts of interest among media talking heads -- to name just 3 examples.

It makes me sad when people I've met and liked do things they've rightly condemned their political opponents for doing, like smear people with whom they disagree.  I'm not a "both sides do it" type, but it's not confined to either party. It's why I prefer values-driven movements.

@fowerli @mmurraypolitics Essentially unknowable, and other factors are also prolonging the animosity, but the suggestion that the email disclosures triggered "Sanders/Clinton tension" is clearly incorrect.
@mmurraypolitics The Sanders/Clinton tension and left-base hostility to DNC chair were already there. I know; I worked on the primary campaign. The email releases exacerbated those emotions, but they did not change the trajectory of the primary -- or, arguably, its long-term consequences.

@jamenta @WalkerBragman I don't think Boomers gavw millennials a raw deal: economic forces and power elites did that. But we didn't stop them, and we only have a few years to make it right.
@jamenta @WalkerBragman I'm in the same place. Maybe I've got 20 years of full-time work ahead of me -- if I'm lucky. The next 20 years will determine whether climate change &amp; inequality create mass suffering on a many-times greater scale. Then there's the killing of black kids, the risk of war ... etc.
@Anarchy_Dog How do we lift up this abuse of power and fight to end it?
@jamenta @WalkerBragman Right. And you know who used to talk about that all the time? Liberals.
@JSCCounterPunch It's almost as if these selective attacks are ... what're the words I'm looking for here? Oh, yeah: "self-seeking" and "ideological."
@JSCCounterPunch I think Justin said some over-the-top insulting things about me a while back, but I can't really remember -- and I don't especially care. He makes an excellent point here.
@jamenta @WalkerBragman re those mob leaders: A) It's often "a conspiracy of shared values," to use words once attributed to Disraeli (it's more likely Gore Vidal); B) and, in some cases: follow the money.
@jamenta @WalkerBragman Dopamine is the real currency of the internet.
@jamenta @WalkerBragman My sense is that people are willing to be manipulated by the military/securitycomplex and are heedless of the consequences of their actions -- sometimes for money, but, more often, just because it makes them feel good.
@jamenta @WalkerBragman We certainly should.
Lastly: "Fake news" includes any claims that aren't supported by currently-established facts. It is antithetical to my personal values, no matter who spreads it.
And when their harshest comments are directed at what they call "the left," it makes me doubt their hearts, their agenda ... and, in some cases, their funding.
My opinion, for what it's worth: When people who call themselves progressive speak with vitriol of their fellow humans, they are not my kind of progressive.

@DavidOAtkins And I know everyone's tl is different, but I honestly don't see leftists "defending Russia." I do see a lot of non-leftists saying that they do, for what seem to me to be ideological reasons.
@DavidOAtkins There's a growing body of evidence on Russian actions, but it's getting ahead of the evidence to say Russia was the factor that "gave Trump the election." It was multifactorial, but so far the evidence says the biggest factor was Dem candidate and platform.

@CarolynMcC @ringoffireradio @TZHRJ Come back sometime! It was great to have you on the program.
@lydiadepillis @WHands80 @StephanieKelton Bottom line: Student debt cancellation would create 1 million-plus jobs and economic growth. The real question is: Under what circumstances is it fair to deny people those jobs and that growth?
@lydiadepillis @WHands80 @StephanieKelton The first generation to enjoy public high school enjoyed a benefit earlier generations did not have. Same with Social Security or Medicare. Sweeping new policies can right injustices, but not all injustices at all times and in all circumstances. That's not a reason to avoid them.
@lydiadepillis @WHands80 @StephanieKelton It's not a moral hazard if we have tuition-free public higher education going forward, which means future students have another option besides punishing student debt.

My contrarian take of the day: I don't care if Donald Trump knows the words to the National Anthem or not.
@JSCCounterPunch I wonder what they'd say if the corporation said hiring them was against its religion.
It seems a little ironic that the moronic sexist engineer who got his 15 minutes of fame is suing Google for discriminating against "conservative white men," since conservative white men think corporations can discriminate against anyone they want.
Republicans are thinking big and remaking society, with a historical sweep. Democrats aren't. An excerpt from my latest: https://t.co/s99ifIDrYx https://t.co/ayzM67Cb2u
@sscharf12 Agree. It was a terrible slogan
My first piece of the year  looks beyond crazy Trump to the GOP's war on civil society and the Dems' lack of an alternative, in a centuries-long perspective -- westward expansion, Progressive Era, etc. https://t.co/s99ifIDrYx
And, to repeat: My despair isn't about Oprah. It's about us. Religion isn't the opiate of the masses anymore; politics is. Because our new faith is the creed of celebrity, hallowed be their famous names. It may not be an agenda for change, but it's sure clickable content.
It was just, "Oh, good, we've got our next leader -- someone who can make me feel good." Meanwhile, the planet suffers more damage on a daily basis, the drones keep flying, hunger and jails etc etc etc.
Nobody asked what she'd do about mass incarceration, or endless wars and the espionage/industrial complex, or addiction, or healthcare for all, or the dismantlement of the middle class and the oppression of the poor.
Parts of her speech -- "a new day is on the horizon," etc. -- and even its structure, seemed designed to evoke that reaction. And it worked all too easily.
She seems brilliant, and good-hearted, and I think she's helped a lot of people. My reaction isn't really about Oprah. It's about the insatiable hunger for the next savior displacing the call for real change.
For reasons that will take some thought to sort out, the liberal reaction to Oprah's speech and calls for her to run filled me with genuine despair.

@harveyjkaye Interesting thought, although I'd say that the generation preceding it was the most progressive, instituting the New Deal while the Greatest Generation was in high school. In any case, I don't tend to assign praise or blame based on birth cohort but point taken!

@SallyAlbright Here. I did the research you should have done before spreading GOP misinformation. https://t.co/LcO2P2hsb2
@SallyAlbright Yes, he did misquote. Sanders has been very critical of the GOP tax bill, repeatedly calling it a giveaway to the rich. You could've researched Sanders' comments about the bill rather than accepting a Republican's lie. But it served your purpose, so you repeated the lie.
@SallyAlbright That's the kind of thing people rightfully criticize Republicans for doing. When Democrats are no better -- when they repeat the very same false insinuations, in this case -- it's bad for (among other things) the party's image.
@SallyAlbright No link or citation so that readers can judge for themselves -- just insinuation.
@SallyAlbright Very simple: A NC Republican misquotes Bernie. You repeat the misquote as if it were fact in order to mount an attack. What's so hard to understand?
The moral truth here is obvious: Centrist Dems who quote Republican lies for their own political purposes are as amoral as the Republicans themselves. After all, they're doing the same thing. https://t.co/yr4h62aXF8

@PattyArquette @isi_kbreen @heimaeyus ... but my point is, Hillary never apologized for her abusive supporters the way Bernie did. And yet, I never blamed Hillary for the racism and antisemitism of her supporters, despite her failure to apologize.
@PattyArquette @isi_kbreen @heimaeyus Of course. Bernie's said so, too. In this case the situation is unclear because the source of the flyers isn't known. It's odd, because most Bernie supporters know that young African Americans voted overwhelmingly for Bernie.
@PattyArquette @isi_kbreen @heimaeyus When I wrote about my biracial godkids during the 2008 primary I got multiple racist emails from Hillary supporters. One said "fuck your godkids." Has she ever apologized for that racism, or for antisemitism in the 2016 race?

@OwenJones84 Because it involves just the right combination of pomposity, self-interest, and cynicism. The "center" cannot hold, but it can scold.
Many of the politicians chastising Trump long for the days when they were only associated with more structural, less overt forms of racism.
@ActionJustin It is used to imply that there is a large, active racist contingent on the left. No such thing. It's used to silenc leftists.
Centrist anti-left Dems are hastily deleting their 'alt-left' slurs. That's a start. Now they should apologize for the insults and slurs.

@GWP810 @matthewstoller @mcuban @danielmarans Because it worked out so well with credit cards?
@mcuban New paradigms are great, but people are dying so, in the meantime, I'll take the best paradigm we've got. That happens to be single-payer.
@matthewstoller @mcuban @danielmarans I also mentioned certification issues, which to my knowledge Dean doesn't discuss. I'd add in needless barriers posed by medical training.
@matthewstoller @mcuban @danielmarans Matt, reread my comment. I didn't say it was in the article. I added it as my own point, because I agree with Dean.
@mcuban I disagree. They're hard to beat on narrow issues the public doesn't understand. Easier to defeat them with a clear goal &amp; principles.
@daveanthony @KenBurns @Scaramucci  https://t.co/kRM8U01jNj
@RJSCity @mcuban @danielmarans @matthewstoller I prefer "universal care" to "universal coverage." Avg family w/"good coverage" pays $11,000+ per year and often goes without needed care.
@mcuban @matthewstoller @danielmarans Sadly, the lobbyists will be fierce in their defense of both subsidies. IMO we need a clear goal people can rally around: universal care.
@mcuban @RJSCity @danielmarans @matthewstoller How so?
@matthewstoller @mcuban @danielmarans Agreed. We also keep costs artificially high by limiting access to foreign doctors and through patent policy on medications and devices.
@smoothcaramel @mcuban Especially since in many cases those drugs were developed at US government expense, then given to pharma companies under exclusive pate4nt.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban We'd need a very careful transition plan to ensure fiscal stability for hospitals -- and continued provider access, too. But that's doable.
@mcuban The problem is that private health care is part of a larger dysfunctional system, too. AMA, hospitals, insurers -- all have lobbyists.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban I agree that cost of care is central problem. But private insurers are too fractionated to address it. A single-payer program could do it.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban "Largely driven" seems like an overstatement, but I agree it is an overly complicated hybrid system at this point.
@RJSCity @mcuban @danielmarans @matthewstoller That's my position too. Always willing to hear new ideas, but we already have a working model -- in every other developed country.
@mcuban We can keep debating numbers, but I'm also curious: Numbers aside, what exactly are you proposing? I'm genuinely interested.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban Shoddy scholarship from a far-right ideologue who got mixed up in a tobacco industry cash-for-comments scandal. I'm citing source data.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban I've given you data sources. You've given me your opinion. I work from data.
@PrestonLewis8 @mcuban 15% is profit. Your data isn't correct. Private insurance admin costs are much higher. Read Medicare report and any insurers 10k's.
@mcuban Medicare with problems works better than private sector without.
@mcuban Mark, again: It's about the numbers. Medicare operates much more efficiently than private insurance, with much lower overhead.
@mcuban 2) In fact, I think it's the other way around: you made MY point!@
@mcuban 1) Sorry, Mark, but that didn't seem to be your point when you started. You were knocking single-payer, which we'd have if not for lobbying.
@mcuban Politics.
@danielmarans @mcuban @matthewstoller That's a given.T here is a political economy hazard.  But the current system has already failed, while gov ins has succeeded worldwide.
@mcuban 3) the program by trimming some profit-driven fat and other inefficiencies from care delivery, but private sector health ins has failed
@mcuban 2) to ensure that hospital benefits can still be paid in full. The fund for dr. care is just fine, thanks. It's true that we could improve
@mcuban 1) It's not. The surplus in the trust fund for Medicare hospital care will be gone, but there will still be revenue. There are multiple ways
@mcuban According to the data, the government is significantly more efficient - lower overhead. Plus, no marketing costs and no need for ROI/profit.
