6. So that females have the confidence to not believe that the only element society cares about is their body! So they can know hair, outfit, make-up, weight.... that’s not all of who they are. Interviewers, politicians, and everyday people will use that as a basis to judge!
5. Women often vote based on who their spouse will tell them to vote for. Displaying women in the media who will inspire women to think for themselves will change politics and encourage women to run for office!
4. 30% of young girls aspire to become president one day. That drops significantly once they reach high school age. Empowering girls to pursue their dreams relentlessly will change the fact that the U.S. is ranked 90th in the world in terms of female representation!
3. So they can see that the stereotype that women are “catty” and jealous towards one another isn’t accurate. There are so many positive lessons and meaningful things that can come out of supporting one another!
2. So girls can grow up knowing that their appearance isn’t what will define their success. Brains over beauty! Smart is beautiful!
1. So they can see past the media’s portrayal of successful women as bossy, heartless, and uncommitted to family.
Why we need to empower women and girls, a thread:
