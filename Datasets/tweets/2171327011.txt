@RepMikeRogersAL @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with you. We just need SKILLS matched to NEEDS, perhaps on a state-by-state basis. Ag workers for CA and SC, computer scientists for WA. Low value-workers free up Americans for higher productivity roles - which raises GDP.
@RoyBlunt This is a ridiculous assertion about Utilities. Profit is regulated. The American taxpayer has taken out a $1.5T loan, some of which is handed to Utilities as a tax cut. Their "excess profit" must be returned to taxpayers. It's just "in-one-door-and-out-the-other".

@WillHouston11 @realDailyWire @benshapiro 65% are less than 25 years old. That's a kid in my book.
@z56po @davidfaber @HalftimeReport No, I would have preferred that they direct the money directly to the middle class, rather than trickling down a small fraction, with &gt;90% going to shareholders.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro No	Big Loser: DACA Kids	There are no winners
@RepMattGaetz @cnsnews Anti-Trump bias also infects the US (58% to be precise)	So what?
@SenateGOP @Apple Apple added 30,000 jobs the last 5 years, so this actually represents a slow-down in hiring

@SpeakerRyan This is a ridiculous assertion. The profit of public utilities is regulated. The American taxpayer has taken out a $1.5T loan, some of which is handed to Utilities as a tax cut. Their "excess profit" must be returned to taxpayers. It's just "in-one-door-and-out-the-other".

@BillOReilly Bill - I am shocked by the sexist comments about OW's "inexperience"	Journalist, entrepreneur, media-empire builder, CEO, producer, school-founder and philanthropist, donated &gt;$500M	Though starting in poverty, overcame obstacles to build a $2.8B net worth. 	That's "inexperience"?
@HuffPostPol Ridiculous and sexist claim	OW is a journalist, entrepreneur, media-empire builder, CEO, producer, school-founder and (real) philanthropist, having donated &gt;$500M	Though starting in poverty, overcame obstacles to build a $2.6B net worth. 	That's "inexperience"?

@SpeakerRyan Now this is just about the most ridiculous claim I've heard GOP make.	Profits of utilities are regulated. 	The American public is taking out a loan, some of which goes to tax cuts for utilities. Any "excess profit" just goes back to the taxpayer in the form of a rate cut.

@kdeleon 	Kevin - Re your CNN. The most impactful argument re SALT is that, even w/ large SALT deductions, CA/NY/NJ etc are still NET SENDERS of revenue to D.C.
