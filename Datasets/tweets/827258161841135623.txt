I don't want the Park experience to be the same as it is on the 405. We have to shore up public land assets around parks to spread visitors
Our front line is too thin-that's folks in refuges &amp; parks-and we are too heavy at the top and middle management. Gotta push assets down.
If you're an energy developer &amp; you're going to operate on public land, you have to do it right &amp; the gov has to be a responsible partner
It's not just about funding, it's about structural and how we do it. We absolutely have to streamline permitting for #water #infrastructure
