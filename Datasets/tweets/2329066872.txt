There is a precedent in American history for this weird situation, in which there is evidence that a leader has acted against the interests of the U.S., yet a large percentage of Americans don’t believe it or simply aren’t interested, writes James Risen. https://t.co/rCXl1Q0Ukt
Trump came to power thanks to some of the same factors that fueled the rise of Jefferson Davis. Millions voted for Trump because they believed that he would protect white power and fight against the rising tide of diversity in America, writes James Risen. https://t.co/YlGTiccoQ6

Since 1967, the year that the Israeli military took control of the West Bank, there has been an 85 percent overall decrease in mention of the term “occupation” in headlines about Israel, according to a new study by 416Labs. https://t.co/V2ofH6k3pn
Since its founding in the early 20th century, the Border Patrol has operated with near-complete impunity, arguably serving as the most politicized and abusive branch of federal law enforcement. https://t.co/U0jGABTipH
The patrol wasn’t a large agency at first — just a few hundred men during its early years — and its reach along a 2,000-mile line was limited. But over the years, its reported brutality grew. Border agents beat, shot, and hung migrants with regularity. https://t.co/6xgM0HtnNm
