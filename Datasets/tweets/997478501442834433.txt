@EdKrassen What a stretch
@RealJamesWoods Crazy!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump What a Christian thing to say...pretty sure Jesus never said ‚Äúthou shalt torture‚Äù
@mike_pence @HawleyMO @braun4indiana @JimRenacci @realDonaldTrump Sad!
@tedlieu @NRA What are you going to propose tough guy?
@SenTedCruz Maybe if you started worrying about what‚Äôs going on at home instead of what‚Äôs going on in Israel we could start solving real issues that affect real Americans
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters @THEHermanCain @WattersWorld Hey tough guy @JesseBWatters why‚Äôd you vote for Obama in 08??
@KamalaHarris Just announce your candidacy for POTUS already
@BetoORourke None of this would‚Äôve helped prevent this type of tragedy
@marklevinshow Still trying to figure out how this is an American problem?
@marklevinshow üôÑ
@marklevinshow Still trying to figure out how this is an American problem?
@marklevinshow Please stay there...it‚Äôs your favorite country anyway
@SenatorBurr @MarkWarner And yet you pushed for Haspel‚Äôs nomination...you‚Äôre an idiot
@timkaine Lmao said the ultimate sellout!
@timkaine Where was this during the previous admin???
@sendavidperdue @POTUS @jennybethm Nice talking point
@sendavidperdue Yeah, torture and war is cool!
@SenTomCotton Yeah, torture and war is cool!
@LindseyGrahamSC We spend more on defense than the next 18 countries COMBINED!!! You are an idiot. Maybe just maybe we should spend those defense dollars more wisely...just a thought
@LindseyGrahamSC Yeah, torture and war is cool!
@tedlieu @SpeakerRyan And what type of legislation would that be? Another law against the type of explosives used too??
@EdKrassen Common sense? What about the explosives? He used his dads guns...which would be legal under those models. Just another talking point and no solution.
@EdKrassen And what about the explosives?? We have laws against that too

@EdKrassen So did the Clintons...
@SenGillibrand @NYDailyNews Then why do you keep voting against female nominees to lead federal departments??

In the meantime, we need to protect our schools like we do banks, airports and courthouses until we heal our societal ills  #SantaFeStrong
These are all cultural issues that need to be addressed. It‚Äôs not a gun issue. https://t.co/EHEVPtn8gP
4. And probably the most important issue that no one seems to be talking about is we have dehumanized life in general throughout our society. Abortion, wars and the things we watch in the movies and  on tv all stimulate the dehumanization effect of the loss of life.
3. Broken families and parenting. The tough question here is how did a parent not know about the child concocting these explosives?
2. Social media - as much as social media can help us connect to one another it also helps fuel cyber bullying. School used to end at the last bell for the day. Now, with social media school never ends. And for kids who are bullied at school, the bullying never ends.
Why?		1. Constant coverage of these shootings only gives in to the attention these mentally unstable people so desperately craze. https://t.co/A1mNNRa7Fr
This time the child concocted explosives and brought it to the school - so regulation obviously doesn‚Äôt work and confiscating guns isn‚Äôt the solution.
In response to the horrific event that took place yesterday, we as a society need to ask the tough questions. 		Why does this keep happening and how do we solve it?
