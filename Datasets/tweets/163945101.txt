Nearly one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime.
Hope is just a step away.
There is hope. Reach out.
Abusers use fear, guilt, shame, and intimidation to wear you down and keep you under his or her thumb.
Domestic violence doesn't only happen to adults. 40% of girls 14 - 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a bf.
Words can be just as powerful as actions.
Love doesn't hurt. Someone who TRULY loves you will never harm you emotionally, physically or mentally.
