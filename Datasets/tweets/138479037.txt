Sen Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the DSCC, out quick against Kavanaugh, a constituent. "People in Maryland and across the country need and deserve a Supreme Court justice who will stand up for liberty and justice for all — not someone pre-selected by right-wing groups ..."
Blanket ban on Kavanaugh statements from House members. (Senate snobbery.)
Sen Schumer: "I will oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same."
Sen McConnell has gone from privately suggesting Pres Trump not pick Brett Kavanaugh to calling him a "a superb choice" and "impressive nominee" in his public statement.
Interesting that President Trump ignored Sen McConnell's advice on Kavanaugh.  We will see how that works out.
Looks like Tom Carper of Delaware is the only current Democratic member of the Senate who voted for Kavanaugh in 2006. Ten current members against on a 57-36 vote.

Looks like Sen McConnell/GOP decided its more fun to bash Dems for blocking refugee bill than voting on some gotcha amendments.
No votes on amendments = no Senate votes at all on Syrian refugee bill. Where have we seen this movie before?

Pres Obama lecturing Republicans on ISIS, says they don't threaten our national existence or that the fight amounts to WWIII.
