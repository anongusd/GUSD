@dankefoss That‚Äôs incorrect.  The cavity is the result of warm water getting underneath the glacier, and that happens year round.
@Bulldozzer61 No, this has not been going on for millions of years.
@grumpahager Your ice formed this winter. The Antarctic ice formed many thousands of years ago.
@BotNumber323231 The cavity is not the result of a small amount of warming because more sunshine reaches the top surface of the glacier, but of ocean water getting underneath the glacier, and that doesn‚Äôt just happen in the summer.

@firebug327polar @NASA While the losses sustained over the past ~40 years very slightly change the salinity of the immediate surface layers of the ocean for a time, it only pertains to a small portion of the overall surface of the ocean and it only lasts for a short period of time. (2/5)
@firebug327polar @NASA Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms. (1/5)

@ScottSneller @NASAInSight 8 hours and about 8 seconds is how long it takes light to travel from Mars on landing day. It all depends where Mars is in relation to Earth at the time.
@JohnRicks @lcagee @NASAInSight That's right!	It‚Äôs actually extremely similar to Phoenix, the spacecraft we landed in 2008.

@RyanCantin @NASA Images at thermal wavelengths tell us about the physical properties and with multispectral images the mineralogy. Radar data tells us about surface roughness, subsurface layering and reflectivity (important for the lander radar system).
@RyanCantin @NASA We use a variety of remote sensing data to evaluate landing sites. In addition to visible images at a variety of scales we also use thermal, multispectral and radar data.

@myBusynest That's an idea that dates back to the early 19th century, but modern science understands that's likely not the answer. It's more likely that massive Jupiter kept planets from forming out of material accreting in the region of asteroid belt.

@apod00 @NASA @NASA_Dawn 25,700 mph... and it's a big bugger.  The spacecraft is the length of a pitchers mound to home plate!
@acwiebusch Yes, this very well could be an avalanche. In the pictures on https://t.co/gr8bBM4vtv there are other images that show similar things. Gravity on Ceres is an important force, and may be pulling material down these crater walls.
@masanorimusic @NASA_Dawn The solar system is tremendously diverse.  These are pieces of the puzzle.  NASA sends missions to bodies large and small.	If you wanted to know about humankind you'd want to learn about all kinds of people.
@jdrodriguezTCD Yes, our sensors gave us definitive measurements. We've found sodium carbonates in other places in the solar system, such as Saturn's moon Enceladus, but we haven't found them on smaller asteroids. Ceres is a dwarf planet -- and fascinating!
@SPACETVnet @NASA @NASA_Dawn The big mystery is the liquid water within #Ceres.

Saturn's rings are made mostly of particles of water ice that range in size from smaller than a grain of sand to as large as mountains. The ring system extends up to 175K miles from the planet, but  are razor-thin, about 30 feet  thick in most places.

@SOFIADN1200 @NASA @reddit_AMA Main belt asteroids tend to stay in the asteroid belt (especially the big ones). Gravitational forces, collisions or the Yarkovsky Effect can change their trajectories, but it's important to note that no known asteroids pose a threat to Earth.
@DarrelMenthe @NASA @reddit_AMA That would be a negative.  The closest approach was October 14, 2017 and now Oumuamua is on its way out.
@KaissarNassar @NASA @reddit_AMA The velocity of 'Oumuamua when it passed closest to the Sun was almost 90 km/s. Now it's going away from the Sun at about 30 km/s. It is progressively slowing down, but will still leave the Solar System with a velocity of about 26 km/s.
@SOFIADN1200 @NASA @reddit_AMA The difference between the two is an active surface. Comets have an active surface from outgassing!

@kirchu People are welcome. Drop-offs suggested but it will involve walking up the hill to our entrance.
@OmoNsasi Please do arrive very early. By 8:30 a.m. today there were traffic jams. Make it a breakfast tailgate and bring patience.
@jeremytweet We suggest doing those first as lines for them will get longer. Do outdoor exhibits after.
@jeremytweet Depending on gate you came in, we suggest #14/#15/#16 (spacecraft assembly and machine shop) or #5 (mission control)
