I couldn’t agree more: @realDonaldTrump “It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we will stop it.” #SOTU
.@realDonaldTrump “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.” #SOTU
