@LilEsBella Think about it "unpresidented", his supporters they will claim its about Oboma, to every one else its like a subliminal message
@LilEsBella i dont think it was a mistake
@SovietSergey there is obviously something very wrong here

@r3ckt4all725 going to work on it, Im pretty positive more evidence will come to light in the coming months as well. Yea its just a theory
@r3ckt4all725 Iraq kurds and Turkish aggression
@r3ckt4all725 Another good example is Syria, Exxon mobile could get deals once the kurds and ISIS is out
@r3ckt4all725 For starters the Ukraine, Russia has much business intersts there and controlling the territory would be in that best interest
I just came to a scary realization, what if The Trump team intends to help Russia wage war for oil and gas interests?
@AviationAgency the facebook page has been removed?
