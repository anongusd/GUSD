If we can make just one other person, outside of our family circle, happy each day, make them smile or laugh, then our day has been a truly good one.
No matter how cold someone may seem towards us, or how many times we are rebuffed, always keep the hand of friendship extended and keep it stretched out, regardless what happens

It's hard to do at times, but we all have to somehow learn to let our anger go. Never hold a grudge, or worse still, set out to seek revenge, as all they ultimately achieve, is pain for ourselves

Heavy is the head that bears the crown 👑 They talk smack about you because if they talked about themselves, no one would listen. Boom!
Keep focused to your success. People will talk as long as they have tongues in their mouths. Let their hate not slow you down. For your true definition is in the mouth of God.
Toxic people will always have something to say. They will try to pull you down when they see you doing good in  life. Let them talk just be positive and press on.
"It’s good to keep quiet and hold back and let things be, but sometimes, if you are strong enough, you can decide to fight for yourself."
You're the only one who understands your scars. In your eyes they're beautiful coz they've made you whom you are.
The best revenge is to move on, get over it, and continue to succeed. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer.
If your sultan is Satan all your struggle ends in suffering, but if your strength is in the living God, you`ll always be victorious.

True Faith In Him	Learn God's tolerance, forgiveness and love of all, away from hate.
Your inner light has the power to light up the world.
Be like stars; instead of cursing the darkness, shine.
Persevere like a seed; even when people try to bury you, flourish.
No one can stop you from shinning if you are standing in your own light.
Raise your love so high that anger cannot reach it.

Counting each day’s blessings helps you overcome each week’s troubles.
Today’s tears and sweats water tomorrow’s gardens.
You can dance through any storm if thunder is music to your ears.

Our earnest prayer is that God will graciously vouchsafe prosperity, happiness, and peace to all our neighbors, and like blessings to all the peoples and powers of the earth
Every burden is a blessing.
The proud man counts his newspaper clippings, the humble man his blessings.
RT @nerie_manicio: #ALDUB164thWeeksary It is a blessing in disguise
he great blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach; but we shut our eyes, and, like people in the dark, we fall foul upon the very thing-we search for, without finding it.
Men are slower to recognize blessings than evils.
Blessed is the man who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed" was the ninth beatitude
Blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds, and though a late, a sure reward succeeds
There's no disaster that can't become a blessing, and no blessing that can't become a disaster
No man is entitled to the blessings of freedom unless he be vigilant in its preservation
No blessing lasts forever
We should certainly count our blessings, but we should also make our blessings count.
Not in rewards, but in the strength to strive, the blessing lies.
Our prayers should be for blessings in general, for God knows best what is good for us.
Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has plenty; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.
When we lose one blessing, another is often, most unexpectedly, given in its place.
Change, like sunshine, can be a friend or a foe, a blessing or a curse, a dawn or a dusk.
One of the blessings of being rich is the blessing to be charitable
Not what we say about our blessings, but how we use them, is the true measure of our thanksgiving.
Reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has many - not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some
There is this difference between the two temporal blessings - health and money; money is the most envied, but the least enjoyed; health is the most enjoyed, but the least envied; and this superiority of the latter is still more obvious when we reflec
May your days be many and your troubles be few. May all God's blessings descend upon you. May peace be within you may your heart be strong. May you find what you're seeking wherever you roam.
The secret to a rich life is to have more beginnings than endings.
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.
Making the beginning is one third of the work.
The world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be the beginning.
The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.
