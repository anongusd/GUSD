Smith‚Äôs arguments, in general, are basically that they give Superintendent Steve Webb far too much authority, and that VAESP members aren‚Äôt here to do ‚Äúirreversible harm‚Äù to kids.
Smith is a teacher in Evergreen and pretty active in the Evergreen Education Association.
Wendy Smith asks that the items be considered separately. She‚Äôs gonna do her thing where she speaks out against all these resolutions.
‚ÄúWe have confidence that the bargaining process will lead to an agreement,‚Äù Webb says, and he‚Äôs hopeful that happens today.
Some resolutions may only be necessary if the strike goes on for an extended length of time, he says.
Superintendent Steve Webb is speaking. Calls today‚Äôs resolutions contingency plans only.

"the strong support our members have shown to VAESP lead us to the conclusion that the significant majority of our members will choose not to cross the picket lines," Wilson said.
Another 7 percent worry about the safety of their students if school opens, particularly special ed teachers who have a large number of paraeducators in their classrooms. "If they're not there, I can't provide for their safety," executive director Rick Wilson said he's been told.
Ain't no scabs in the Vancouver Education Association. About 47 percent of members are encouraging district leadership to tell its members not to cross picket lines if VAESP goes on strike. Another 23 percent want leadership to tell members to use their individual conscious.

There's a lot of measles out there in this the year of our lord 2019. Vaccinate your kids and all that. https://t.co/90sJqBB79M
@IdaMayFerrin @robwdavis But that's why herd immunity is so important. Those who cannot receive vaccines for valid reasons have to be protected by the rest of us being adequately vaccinated.
@IdaMayFerrin @robwdavis Yes! Certain childhood cancers or autoimmune disorders can prevent you from receiving a medical exemption. I have a dear friend with an egg allergy who missed vaccines as a function of that. It's a small percent of kids affected by medical exemptions -- less than 1 percent in CC.
@robwdavis 5.3 percent of kids up here specifically have MMR exemptions.
@robwdavis Just to be clear, 7.5 percent are exempt from receiving vaccines. You're right, 22.4 percent of kids don't have all their immunizations. So they may have some but not all of them. 5.9 percent have personal exemptions. Those are the ones you gotta watch out for.

It's a good thing to add to your rounds when you're backgrounding your politicians or your Tinder dates.		Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
...You can always give it a smell test by checking out information about their property on the Property Information Center. You can also check out things like the construction quality of a home, the sale history, inspections and permits.
Anyway, did you know all property taxes are a public record? In Clark County, you can look up an individual's property tax bill by plugging their address in https://t.co/DpYTOVwJqw. So when a politician -- or anyone really -- is complaining about their property taxes...
His house is also valued at $441,974, up from $335,685 in 2015. And that's assessed value, not market value. Median home prices in Clark County hit $350,000 last June.
In 2018, he paid $490.14, $667.23 and $19.09, respectively, to those three funds. That's a total increase of less than $100 between three funds. Now, his property tax bill is a lot higher than than -- library fees, school fees, fire and rescue, etc.
I was also curious to see how Mielke's property taxes have changed in the last few years. Clark County, I believe, votes on the general fund levy, the road fund levy and Conservation Futures. In 2015, Mielke paid $452.32, $612.43 and $17.95, respectively, to those three funds.
He was also tardy on paying his own property taxes a couple times. https://t.co/DNRe4iA3sd
I never got the sense that Tom Mielke really understood property taxes when I was covering Clark County. At one particularly memorable meeting, he appeared to be surprised that Vancouver residents, for example, pay property taxes to Clark County. https://t.co/LVIM2F37if
Especially given the city‚Äôs growing diversity and continued lip service for serving areas like the Fourth Plain corridor, which has a significant Latino/a population.
Really surprised that, after two appointment processes with several highly qualified candidates of color, we still have an all white Vancouver city council.
Meeting adjourned!
Nickels votes in favor of the Maple Grove conversion. Motion passes 4-1. Effective next school year, Maple Grove will be a K-4 school and its middle school students will go elsewhere.
Anderson moves to approve the boundary line changes to convert Maple Grove into a K-4. "I think it's pretty reflective of the vote we just had how difficult a decision this is," board President Troy McCoy says.
Gonna vote on the southern shift. Troy McCoy votes it down. He's the third vote so this will die. Mavis Nickels voted in favor of the southern shift.
Says he's not in favor of the K-8 shift. Tina Lambert calls the K-4 conversion more equitable.
Monty Anderson, speaking about Maple Grove under NCLB: "The recommendation was to try a new system to see how it would work. I believe that system has worked well for the period of time that we‚Äôve had."
"From a systems standpoint, I favor the K-4 conversion," Ross says.
Ross advocating for the K-4 conversion. "We have an opportunity to right the system," he says, again in reference to the school being converted to a K-8 campus during NCLB.
Ken Root moves to approve the southern shift boundary change. Details on what that means is here. https://t.co/V85fwB99cY
idk sometimes I think we don't give kids credit. they're generally pretty resilient and manage change better than we think they do.
There's some concern about keeping kids from families at the same campuses but one of the student reps just said it's better to get kids away from their families earlier and he is my favorite.
Apparently River HomeLink students use some of Maple Grove's facilities. Also some questions about where a high needs special ed program would go.
*stark.
Apparently Glenwood only has the capacity for its kindergarten and first grade classes. The rest of students are in portables. I knew that in terms of the numbers but that's a really start way to put it.
Maple Grove's been a K-8 for seven years, a couple folks in the audience just said. There's the clarification.
Here's a story in The Reflector from 2012 about that. So I suppose theoretically there could be kids at that campus before it was converted. https://t.co/mQ9se8EDrx
Nickels says converting Maple Grove to a K-4 school would be the second major upheaval for that campus in a short period of time. I assume she's referring consolidation of that campus into one school under No Child Left Behind. That was before my time.
"This is one of the most difficult decisions we‚Äôve been asked to make in some time," says board member Mavis Nickels.
On to conversation about the boundary redrawing. The board eliminates the plan that would have redrawn most district boundaries right off the bat. That's not surprising -- it would have affected the most kids.
there's kids here talking about building a math team.

Which to be fair is every day, but this day in particular was bad. The story ended up with three corrections on it. I was miserable. https://t.co/CylTOolmgr

Landlord told me he was raising our rent (albeit a reasonable amount). I asked him why. He decided not to raise our rent. Apparently that‚Äôs a thing you can do.

So please continue supporting our role in this awesome community. https://t.co/KRbIsdigrz
The work we do is valuable. Some stories keep major institutions in check. Some help you know what events are happening in our city. Some may be silly but bring a smile to your face. We can't do this work for free.
I'm proud of the work I've done this year, and of the work my coworkers have done. But I'll leave you with this. Reporting takes time. It takes resources. It takes money. It's impossible without our subscribers, and now more than ever, we need people like you to keep us alive.
My latest project, though, I think is my favorite. After months of scheming, @DahliaBazzaz and I at last finished our series on teacher diversity, and why it matters. 		State level story: https://t.co/RfxNN9mHJC ‚Ä¶		Local level story: https://t.co/tFmG6tmSY9
And in my most ambitious effort, I reported on how missed or ignored red flags kept predatory educators in schools in the Evergreen school district. The story was reported, almost entirely, using more than a thousand pages of public records. https://t.co/2qmJlPxwWq
Later in the year, I covered the costs related to a new ‚Äúgovernance model‚Äù adopted by Evergreen Public Schools, which included expensive meals out and stays in upscale hotels. https://t.co/uRwuec4208
I also reported on how Vancouver Public Schools identified elevated radon, a cancer-causing gas, at six of its schools this year, but only told families at two of those schools. https://t.co/en1HuXnxJp
Here's a few examples of why access to public records matters so much. I reported this year on ongoing lead contamination and outdated roofs at some Evergreen campuses. The bond passed, so safety concerns should be allayed. https://t.co/b1SeeGeJBM
Months after the strikes ended, I wrote a story about a rabbit infestation in the Ogden Neighborhood. Honestly if I could spend every day wandering around looking for bunnies that would be fine. https://t.co/hhSM4oYTWr

And oh boy, who can forget about teacher strikes? Remember that 15 school districts went on strike this year, seven of which were in SW Washington. @A_Littman continued to come in clutch as a partner as we rocked coverage for weeks. Highlights to follow:
Aug. 4 was a big day. You may know it for the Patriot Prayer rally in PDX that, for some, started in Vancouver. I covered that, but you know what was better? Going to the fair that afternoon and getting a ‚ÄúHustle &amp; Flow‚Äù reference in the paper. https://t.co/FmiQGZYYeK
After years of simply reporting where summer lunch sites are located, I took a different take this year: where aren‚Äôt they located? Turns out, there‚Äôs quite a few places, some of them within the poorest neighborhoods of Clark County.		https://t.co/YNH0DxfHcz
I love love loved our graduation package this year, where @a_littman and I profiled six students whose experiences have historically been underrepresented in traditional graduation stories. https://t.co/Xre5o6rC2Z

After Battle Ground Public School failed to pass its bond in February, I took a look at the geographical divisions in the district. This was a big data year for me, and this was one of my first examples of using public data to really dive into a story. https://t.co/NlGPPoucEw

*warning, not earning.
So VAESP is not currently on strike. But they‚Äôre essentially earning the district that they‚Äôre willing to if a deal isn‚Äôt made in a month and a half.
If a deal is not reached by Feb. 1, 2019, the VAESP will hold a strike vote. It was unanimous support of that motion tonight.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care how many cookies I eat,‚Äù a tiny child just said, taking a cookie. ‚ÄúBecause these will keep me awake.‚Äù		I feel SEEN.
In any case we‚Äôll find out soon. They‚Äôre tryna keep this meeting tight because people have kids and other jobs.
And, what VEA member wants to be a scab and cross the picket line if their VAESP union brothers and sisters are striking? Awkward. My wild speculation is that, if a strike happens, schools will close. That‚Äôs TOTAL speculation though.
There‚Äôs also policies on the number of adults who have to be in the classroom in special education classrooms. It‚Äôs codified in the VEA contract. Not to mention all the clerks, secretaries, folks on the playground, etc.
I haven‚Äôt gotten a satisfactory answer on what happens to the district if they do go on strike.Something to bear in mind is that there are special education kids who receive 1 on 1 support from paraeducators. If their paras aren‚Äôt at work,I‚Äôd imagine those kids won‚Äôt be at school
There are 716 members in the VAESP. Davidson says there‚Äôs nothing in the bylaws mandating that a certain number show to take a strike vote. They also only need a majority plus one to go on strike.
I‚Äôve been shunted to the day care area, where there‚Äôs a handful of kids playing on their tablets. Lynn Davidson with WEA-Riverside says there‚Äôs likely to be a ‚Äújob action vote‚Äù tonight. ‚ÄúSo like a strike vote?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she says.

@ms_reba @thecolumbian Heritage.
Her description of the lockdown doesn‚Äôt jibe with what students told us, however. Spolar said in a modified lockdown, class is still ongoing. The girls we spoke to said they were on the ground, against the wall and texting their parents during the lockdown.
They wouldn‚Äôt confirm whether it was a student, an individual just in the area or anything else. District spokesman Gail Spolar says everything went as it should have during this modified lockdown. ‚ÄúThe kids knew what to do. The staff knew what to do.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a few families pulling up to campus here. I asked Spolar to confirm that this incident involved a firearm and she referred me to the Clark County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.
A couple of distressed women just drove by, asking myself and the @KOINNews crew out here what‚Äôs going on. Both said they have relatives that attend the school. Based on what we heard over the scanner there were no injuries but I can‚Äôt imagine how frightening this must be.

Anyway that all passed unanimously. So voters will decide on that one way or the other in February.
That‚Äôs still a lot less than the $3.21 the M&amp;O levy was. District board members and staff reiterate that, once Part Two of the McCleary Fix goes into effect, property taxes are slated to drop for taxpayers.
The combined total of these levies would be $1.87 per thousand in assessed value, or $467.50 for a $250,000 home.
But the maintenance and operations levy is üíÄ under the new McCleary legislation. So now the district has to run a separate tech levy.
Evergreen has never run a tech levy before. They‚Äôve paid for technology improvements, including giving every kid a Chromebook, out of the maintenance and operations levy.

No action is being taken tonight. The school board is going to have some work sessions between now and Jan. 20, the day kindergarten enrollment opens, and community forums to talk next steps. Holy crap, you guys, it's November. January is in two months.
FYI here's the garbage bag: https://t.co/NlGPPoucEw
Also says the district needs to advocate locally for increased impact fees, state-wide to overturn the 60 percent supermajority requirement for approving bonds.
Also this: "The members of the committee overwhelmingly support running a bond," Waters said.
Waters explains the fourth option: All Maple Grove students would be removed from that campus, sent to Daybreak and Tukes, and then a very crowded section of the district at the southeast end would go to Maple Grove.
Of course, none of this fixes the fact that there's a literal garbage bag taped to the ceiling in Laurin Middle School to collect water that's leaking through the ceiling but, that's none of my business. https://t.co/9YM5gITYXX
Actually just the primary and middle schools, not the high schools. The point still stands.
Leave it to schools to throw an acronym on something just for the hell of it. One of the options is called the "N.E.W. Option," which would split the district into north, east and west sectors. They'd redraw all school boundaries, is the non-jargon way to say that.
"We recognize that boundary changes are hard," Water said. "We believe given the circumstances, however, changes need to be made."
Portillo gives glowing review of the Overcrowding Committee's work. "What we did, we could not have done if we had people who were not dedicated," she says.
"It's been six weeks of great, hard, fun, scary work," Portillo says of the overcrowding meetings.
Hearing from Deputy Superintendent Denny Waters and independent consultant Frances Portillo tonight on the options.

@FFZilla .@solomonout says 28.3% this time in 2014. Overall turnout in the 2014 midterm was 50.64 percent.
Part of the reason this is such a big deal is because Clark County historically has had abysmal turnout. General consensus from my years covering this area is that because so many people commute to Portland, they're less inclined to be politically engaged here in Clark County. https://t.co/56JIVrUJCc

I just talked to a WSU Vancouver student who said both her classes are canceled tomorrow, and a Clark College student whose classes were canceled today. Both have differing views on the issues but are frustrated by classes being shut down.
Here‚Äôs the crowd yelling at each other before this group heads down to the overpass to demonstrate. https://t.co/RaushpNdyC
And now there‚Äôs a woman and a guy shouting at each other about abortions.
Chants of USA! USA! And someone‚Äôs yelling ‚ÄúFuck Trump!‚Äù And someone has an iPad on a selfie stick, a new one for me.
There‚Äôs a woman shouting at Gibson, asking ‚Äúwhy are you so associated with violence,‚Äù she says.

Hey, #ewaTEACH18 peeps: here are the absenteeism data tips from Alex. https://t.co/yxt8L6RqiO
"data on its own can be quite dumb." More relatable wisdom from Alex Harwin of @educationweek .
Alex Harwin points out in a session about teacher absenteeism that, if a data set shows a lot of instances aren't reporting data or the data is bad and gross, see if there's a trend to that. What kinds of organizations aren't reporting data? Good data tip in general. #ewateach18

@BryceHuffman313 Eh, you're an education reporter. It's teaching adjacent. :) You're not teaching a roomful of kids. You're teaching your community and bringing the black male experience to your listeners. There's not enough of that in journalism either.
We're telling kids that "the only genius is white," he said. "It reinforces white supremacy for white children." #ewaTEACH18
.@selmekki is üî•üî•üî•. In summary, it's not just good enough to put teachers of color in front of students of color. You need a whole diverse teaching body so all students see diverse view points in their classroom, read literature by diverse authors, etc.
@rachelwalexande What's stunning to me about my experience is that I went to eight schools -- three elementary schools, one primary school, an intermediate school, a middle school and two high schools. So my experience in Washington's education system is broader than most -- and still white AF.
.@SarojaWarner says it cannot be the states alone leading the charge of getting more teachers of color in education. The responsibility falls to the collective power of districts, teacher prep programs, community groups, etc.
I had several Asian women as teachers but my male teachers were exclusively white, and I never had an African American teacher, man or woman. #ewaTEACH18

There's a storage unit facility in Clark County that brands itself as being very much FOR MEN, complete with a lot of boob pictures on its website for some inexplicable reason. Can you imagine your masculinity being so fragile even your damn storage unit has to be gendered?
@nealtmorton And I'm talking to Evergreen about enrollment next week. I haven't had an adequate conversation with anyone about this but when I throw out the idea that people just aren't having kids that kind of gets poo-pooed.
@nealtmorton Battle Ground has suggested that the strike had something to do with declining enrollment this year, but that's a claim I am HEAVILY VETTING. I'm not a parent but I just can't imagine moving your kid to a different district because of a strike.

@CummingsCRHS What's interesting, although unsurprising, is the kids most likely to be in that no-score category A) receive special education services, B) are students of color, C) are low income or D) English language learners.
@CummingsCRHS The largest group to opt out of the English test were the 15.3 percent of students registered as "limited English" at Evergreen High School. Again, that was only 4 out of 26 kids.
@CummingsCRHS Here are some interesting random data points for you: 28.5 percent of black sophomores at Evergreen High School opted out of taking the math test. That's only 4 kids. There's only 14 kids eligible to take those tests, apparently.
@VoteMcDevitt let people enjoy things
@CummingsCRHS Now, OSPI does not specify WHY students didn't receive a score. I think it'd be a safe bet to assume most of those are opt outs. Now, the percentage of kids who opt out totally varies by test, subgroup and campus.
@CummingsCRHS OK, I have an answer to your question. Yes, those numbers do include kids who, for whatever reason, did not receive a score. So the numerator is the number of kids who score a 3 or 4, and the denominator is the total number of kids, scored or otherwise.

@CummingsCRHS No, I absolutely understand. And frankly, this is a story I hate doing every year because I know it's just a blip in an overwhelming amount of action and data that's happening in local schools.

Root just read a letter to the Battle Ground community."In education we are fortunate to have the passionate and driven teachers and staff who care for the well being and education for our children," Root reads."What better lesson can we teach than how work toward a common goal?"
Board unanimously approves calendar adjustments. They include ending winter break three days early and starting spring break three days late.
The board votes unanimously to rescind the legal action resolution approved last week.
The board votes 3 to 1 to approve the contract. Monty Anderson was the nay vote. Root recused himself.
Allen says average salary is around $76,000 now. "We used all of the McCleary money and more," she says.
Mavis Nickels moves to approve the contract. Troy McCoy requests a roll call vote. Monty Anderson asks a question: Are we sending more than McCleary sent down for certificated staff? Allen: Yes we are.
There were also changes to caseloads for some special employees. Psychologists, for example, will see case load increases from 1 to 642 increased to 1 to 950.
Linda Allen, assistant superintendent for human resources, said @BattleGroundPS teachers ended up with an average salary increase of 14.9 percent.

Anyway, the meeting is going to be closed to the public, the doors closed. Lots of whoops and cheers here in the lobby, and some pretty intense high fives. People are SO DONE with this strike, the longest in this rough bargaining year.

Battle Ground‚Äôs strike band is filling the high school gym and lobby with music. I‚Äôm pretty sure they called themselves the Fair Contract and the Benefits, which is just... the best.
I‚Äôm at Battle Ground High School, where teachers will soon be hearing the details of the tentative agreement and voting on a new contract.
I heard from Linda Peterson, BGEA president. She gave me no more details on the contract but said ‚ÄúWe spent every single McCleary penny.‚Äù

BREAKING: @BattleGroundPS ' teachers vote by a rate of 89 percent to continue their strike in defiance of Judge Scott Collier's order this morning.
The teachers have voted on what to do next, Marina Heinz, VP of the union, just told me. Counting votes and waiting on an update.
As I type this, teachers in the Battle Ground school district are meeting in an ‚Äúundisclosed location‚Äù ‚Äî I‚Äôm serious ‚Äî to discuss next steps after today‚Äôs court ruling. ‚ÄúPretty serious discussion and decision,‚Äù WEA spokesman Rich Wood said when I pressed him about the location.
Personal news: I took a three hour nap on getting home after this insane week and holy crap what it must be like to get eight hours of sleep every day.
RT @nealtmorton: A notable turn from WEA's previous line that all districts won, full stop: ‚ÄúThe Washington Education Association agreed to‚Ä¶
Marina Heinz says there‚Äôs a general membership meeting this evening to discuss next steps.
The union could decide to defy that order.
Teachers are supposed to return to work on Monday.
Collier schedules a check in at 9 a.m. next Friday.
Collier will sign the injunction but said they need to talk through what form that takes.
Collier is being very clear that he‚Äôs not speaking to the merits of the negotiations, or whether one side or another is correct.
‚ÄúThe answer to that is yes there is,‚Äù Collier says.
The third prong of this case is will it result in actual and substantial injury, Collier says.
‚ÄúThis is supported by multiple court rulings, by attorney general opinions,‚Äù he says.
Collier says public employees are not allowed to strike. Says the law is pretty clear on that.
Back in session.
Onto a ten minute recess while Collier considers his decision.
Olney says it‚Äôs not clear whether strikes are illegal in Washington or not. On to some rebuttal.
Bill Coats is the district‚Äôs attorney. Margaret Olney, the union‚Äôs attorney, is up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not obviously saying the strike isn‚Äôt disruptive,‚Äù she says. The question is whether it actually causes true substantial harm to students.
Attorney says it‚Äôs becoming critical that teachers go back to work. The district and union remain far apart in their offers and the end of this strike does not seem imminent.
Also lists off some of the issues detailed in the filing: the number of kids who receive free and reduced price meals, special education, declines in enrollment, etc.
The attorney says there is a ‚Äúsocial fabric, a relationship in the district‚Äù that is being damaged as this strike continues.
I deleted a tweet saying Mark Ross wasn‚Äôt here. I‚Äôm literally staring at the back of his head and didn‚Äôt recognize it. Sorry, guys.
The district‚Äôs argument is pretty straight forward: ‚ÄúPublic employee strikes are unlawful,‚Äù the attorney, whose name I missed, says.
We‚Äôre in session.

@ParticleMan10 @withawhyy TBH I seriously considered it a couple years back. I swear too much, I‚Äôd be an awful teacher.
This is worse. Because in Clark County at the crux of most issues were rich people who wanted to develop land or get cuts for opening strip malls. Here, it‚Äôs kids at the heart of the issue.
When I covered Clark County, there were times I left those crazy board meetings and I just felt sad. Just a deep, deep sadness. It‚Äôs hard to sit through that much anger and frustration without feeling it.
I‚Äôm heading back to the office.
Here‚Äôs the resolution the board approved today. https://t.co/tBxFilKWk4
Ross says an injunction could come as soon as tomorrow. It depends on when a judge is available, he says.
Superintendent Mark Ross is giving a press conference. I‚Äôve never seen this before.
One clap from the back. The meeting is now closed.
The board votes 4 to 0 to approve this resolution.
Anderson says he hopes the union works with the district in the coming "fact finding" process.
"I think we're all sad that it's come to this," he continues.
"My concern is for the kids who are hurt by the strike," says board member Troy McCoy. "And I hope you understand that."
Translated: it would allow the district to file an injunction to stop the strike.
The resolution on the table would give Superintendent Mark Ross the authority to hire an attorney to take legal action against any individual employee or union in order to stop the strike.
There‚Äôs a large crowd here. Many are carrying poster boards that are some iteration of this. https://t.co/dczY3zMACd
We‚Äôre missing Ken Root tonight. Looks like Monty Anderson will be conducting the meeting.
Then a posse of teachers went up to the table where the board sits and again, were instructed to ‚Äúget back behind the line.‚Äù Which they did.
The security situation here is a little tight. I tried to walk back to my laptop toward the front of the room and was told to get back behind a line. I told them I was the paper and they let me go.

The Battle Ground Public Schools board is considering a resolution that could authorize legal action against the teachers union. https://t.co/IqBvpoObqB
ATTN: Send beer money, it's 6:30 p.m. and I have two stories to write.
@boisedaisyford And what‚Äôs apparently happening on the ground is paras are being removed from classrooms. I just spoke to a woman who is a paraeducator in a class with 26 kids. They used to have two teachers and six paras. Now they have four paras.
@boisedaisyford So, if a kid needs 1-1 support, it would be very specifically outlined in their special education program, their IEP. That‚Äôs a legal classification, not just a general need.
Wilson tells me it could be a couple weeks before we get a copy of that, as they‚Äôre finishing contract language.
The other frustration I‚Äôm hearing, consistently, is that the actual contract language hasn‚Äôt been made available. This board just unanimously approved the VEA contract adoption, but the literal contract isn‚Äôt on the district website. Just bullet points.
Norris says he hasn‚Äôt received consistent information from the district about what happens next to his job. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kind of hanging out,‚Äù Norris says. ‚ÄúIt was out of the blue.‚Äù
Last Thursday, Norris was told by the district that he was losing his placement ‚Äî which involved doing a lot of job training activities with students on the autism spectrum ‚Äî and is now waiting for new placement.
District spokeswoman Pat Nuzzo told me no para educators have lost their jobs. But I just spoke to a man, Jesse Norris, who was ‚Äúexcised.‚Äù Norris was a program paraeducator at Columbia River High School.
What I‚Äôm hearing from special education teachers, all of whom are afraid to speak to me on the record lest they face retaliation, is this effectively means they are losing paraeducators.
He also said program paraeducators will be receiving another half hour of time a day.
As a result, Wilson explained, they set paraeducator assignments back to pre-2016 levels: 16 kids, one teacher, two program paraeducators for up to nine students. If a kid needs a 1:1 paraeducator, another para will be added to the classroom for the purpose of serving that kid.
Rick Wilson of VEA tells me VAESP,the para union,told them they had no right to negotiate that issue in the first place. "We were basically threatened with legal action if we didn't change that," Wilson said. "We were told it wasn't appropriate for us to bargain that. We agreed.‚Äù
For the last three years, SCC classrooms have had a maximum of 18 kids in them with a teacher and 2 paraeducators for every 7 to 9 students. If a kid in the classroom needed a 1:1 paraeducator, the first program paraeducator would be assigned a 1:1 for that child.
Paraeducators have high responsibilities in special education classrooms. Helping work one-on-one with kids, cleaning up children who have soiled themselves, and countless other things. They're important folk.
There has been a lot of concern and frustration about how paraeducators -- classroom assistants -- will be assigned to classrooms following the ratification of the teachers contract.
So, time to tweet about some rumors I've been hearing in the last couple weeks since VEA ratified its contract. I think I know enough at this point to share with y'all.
@JaymeKFraser SYNERGY!
"How is culturally responsive teaching connected to this data?" Rosemary Fryer asks.		It's connected in that parents probably don't know what the hell any of it means.		Jargon makes me so mad and I am so sleep deprived.
The phrase "thought leaders" was used and I wanted to throw something.
And boy, do I wish more people came to school board meetings. The jargon is NUTS.
So, once you cut through the jargon and actually look at the numbers, Vancouver Public Schools students trend behind the passing rate of the state at large.
It's good for maps, quick hits and a couple other types of data visualizations but oy vey.
Also, it looks like OSPI moved to Tableau for its report card data, which, I'm the biggest proselytizer on Tableau but just clicking around in it I am not convinced parents are going to find this super easy to navigate.

The board is considering a resolution that would stop paying teacher salaries effective Sept. 17. Battle Ground, meanwhile, will front the cost of health insurance benefits and start taking it out of paychecks when teachers get back, is my understanding.

This from Evergreen Public Schools Facebook page with details on what to expect in the coming days. https://t.co/pEISwfpmgI https://t.co/rAA1pCeqBi
In the first year, teachers will start at $51,000, capping out at $98,729. In year two, that goes up to $53,000 to $100,661. That makes Evergreen teachers on those goal posts the top paid teachers in Clark County.
Evergreen Education Association President Bill Beville just gave me rough numbers before running in ‚Äî I‚Äôll get the exact numbers after the meeting.
It feels less crowded this time around but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just my imagination or not. The check in situation is a little different. As far as I know no one knows details of the contract.
Teachers are signing in to go and vote. https://t.co/gUonnmPaBG

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired of doing red laundry,‚Äù I just heard someone say, which answers a question I‚Äôve had THIS WHOLE TIME.
The district is already letting families know school is on tomorrow, and a text to EEA members let them know they can recycle their signs here. Quite the bookend to my last trip here when teachers were making signs before the votes were counted.
I‚Äôm at Evergreen High School where teachers are slated to vote to end their week-and-a-half long strike and ratify a tentatively agreed on contract.

Linda Peterson clarified too. They were taking a break, now they're getting dinner and they're headed back to the district tonight.
Bill Beville clarified. Said they gave the district their latest proposal and they're waiting on a response. The mediator's gone home for the day though, so I'm skeptical we'll see an agreement from Evergreen tonight without a mediator's support.
Beville said they gave the district their latest proposal and are waiting on a counter from the district.
All the union bargainers got t-shirts because of course they did, it‚Äôs a teacher event. #freetshirtsfordays
Linda Peterson takes the podium. ‚ÄúBattle Ground is friggin‚Äô unbelievable,‚Äù she says, fist in the air.
I‚Äôm uh... not sure why they‚Äôre here. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre done bargaining for the day or if they‚Äôre just down here on break.
Becky Broyles of the Battle Ground union is up. ‚ÄúI know they are tired, but they are not giving up.‚Äù Also calls members of that union‚Äôs bargaining team up.
‚ÄúWe will not stop until we are successful,‚Äù he says.
Beville calls the Evergreen bargaining team to the stage.
Bill Beville from the Evergreen Education Associaion is up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to be a fifth grade teacher,‚Äù he says to raucous applause.
‚ÄúWe were the first in the state to go on strike because we wanted money from the McCleary funds. My people have been on the lines for two weeks and two days. Do you know what that means? It‚Äôs solidarity,‚Äù she says.
Lynn Nelson of the Longview school district is here. ‚ÄúEvery one of you deserves a fair contract,‚Äù she says. Longview‚Äôs district filed an injunction against the teachers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù she says of that.
Also heading from other unions, like the ones that represent office workers,  paraeducators, etc.
The presidents and representatives of various teacher unions are taking the stage.		No La Center, though. WHERE IS LA CENTER.
Aaaand on that note, Bethany Rivard says she‚Äôs planning to run for school board next year. That‚Äôs the earliest campaign announcement for a school board seat I‚Äôve ever heard.
‚ÄúWe need more of us elected,‚Äù she says.
Smith talking about next year‚Äôs school board. ‚ÄúI know you are out there, right here in the crowd, our future school board directors.‚Äù		Yeah I think we‚Äôre gonna see a lot of teachers running for public office after all this.
Smith is a teacher in the Evergreen school district. Says it‚Äôs time for more people who understand education to run for office.
Wendy Smith of the Vancouver Public Schools board is here. ‚ÄúWe need more of you!‚Äù Someone yells.
Bethany Rivard, a strike captain and teacher at Fort Vancouver High School teacher is up.
Says her family has been surrounded by counselors, therapists and other supports from school. ‚ÄúI have watched my son change from a terrified little boy to a little social justice activist who wanted to be here so badly today to tell you he supports you,‚Äù she says.
Anna Slocum, a parent in the Evergreen school district, is the next speaker. Her child attends Home Choice Academy. He‚Äôs a high-functioning autistic child, she says. ‚ÄúThere are a number of issues he needs support with,‚Äù she says.
Walker calls on Evergreen Superintendent John Steach to start building a relationship with labor councils.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of you that we are a great county to raise our children,‚Äù she says.
Shannon Walker of the Southwest Washington Labor Council is here. ‚ÄúThis is amazing. It‚Äôs sad, but it‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù
Mentions Tumwater‚Äôs injunction filed against the teacher‚Äôs union. Boos from the crowd.
The president of the Federal Way Education Association is also here. ‚ÄúIf our district can find the money, your districts can find the money,‚Äù she said

I asked BGEA President Linda Peterson the same earlier today. Said the way the district is doing its salary grid is "confusing and inconsistent." "We are hoping that we are talking apples to apples üçé very soon," she said. Before you ask, yes, with the apple emoji.
"I'm hesitant to say because we've been getting reports of rumors that have sprung raised hopes that are premature," he said. "I can share that both sides take the third week of closed schools very seriously."

I mean, I've never been in a union before and I'm not a teacher, so I don't exactly know how this is supposed to work, but my take is that it seems bizarre that the actual contract language isn't available following the vote.
Here's the paperwork attached to that agenda item: https://t.co/cXxDFuKaV9		https://t.co/BwvyTfX5MX
Also, I still haven't actually seen the Vancouver Education Association contract? Teachers I've spoken to say they haven't been given copies, the union told me it would take a couple weeks to get it to me and the school board agenda approving the contract has v little info.
One of the criticisms I heard of Battle Ground's proposal about a week ago is that it took 25 years to get to the top of the pay scale. It's more compact now, topping out after 16 years.
Here's their latest proposal as of 11 p.m. last night (after press time so today's story is outdated): starting salary starts at $50.019 in 2018-2019. It caps out at $94,629. By 2020-2021, it goes up to $52,735 and caps out at $99,767.

As for @evergreenps, they're not negotiating today. The mediator is in Centralia. EEA President Bill Beville said the union isn't even on site. They've been meeting at ESD offices.
Remember, Vancouver was unique in that it was negotiating the entire contract, not just salaries.
OK, just in case this got buried: Vancouver Public Schools will now have every Monday as an early release day for teacher meetings after school. I don't know what time kids get out early yet, but I called the district and am waiting on an update.
@MrsClowLibrary Just yell at me if you do. I spoke to some teachers out there but would love to get your perspective as well. You guys are what this was about!
RT @AmandaCowan10: BREAKING: The Vancouver Education Association ratified the contract by 92.4 percent. School starts tomorrow. @newsladyka‚Ä¶
@MrsClowLibrary Is that something you‚Äôd be willing to talk about for a story?
Also, and actually maybe most notable, every Monday for VPS becomes an early release day, effective immediately. VEA Executive Director Rick Wilson says that will give teachers time to collaborate and plan those afternoons.
After that teachers will get inflationary raises that reflect cost of living ‚Äî roughly 2 percent, though the state sets those numbers.
Salaries for a first year teacher will be $50,413. That includes pay for four extra days worked. They top out for a teacher with a master‚Äôs degree and 90 credits of continuing education at $95,019.
There was 92.4 percent approval from the Vancouver Education Association today. Kids will go back to school tomorrow. Raises the first year average 12.5 percent.
Ack! My phone died right as the announcement got made. Details to follow.
Teachers are posting to their social media feeds that the contract has been ratified. Not sure why we haven‚Äôt gotten official word yet.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back to school!‚Äù A woman with a bullhorn says. ‚ÄúIs that the official announcement?‚Äù A reporter asks. ‚ÄúUh, no.‚Äù Any minute now we should be getting the official vote.
‚ÄúWhoo! Back to school!‚Äù A woman says, clapping and cheering as she leaves.
I‚Äôd call reactions leveled optimism here today. Apparently the bargaining team was in fairly high spirits.
Again, teachers are hesitant to chat with us following the vote. There‚Äôs a lot of people hanging out in the parking lot.

The principal here just told me we (the press) can be on campus grounds but not inside the school. Apparently that‚Äôs direction from the district office.
The end of the line seems to be snaking its way into the building. The meeting was supposed to start at 9:30, not sure if they‚Äôre rocking and rolling in there or not
At this point, teachers know about as much about the tentative agreement as we do. Which is to say, nothing.
Mark Shellenberger, who teaches at the Gateway to Adult Transition Education program, is ready to be done. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre all just really happy to get back in the classroom. We‚Äôve been ready to go.‚Äù
‚ÄúI need to lay down and I need tequila,‚Äù I just heard someone say.		Honestly same.
The line heads all the way down and onto 139th Street. https://t.co/6Ihg6O3uEn
As far as I recall it was a similar story a couple years ago when Evergreen finally voted on its contract. People were real tight lipped until after the meeting.
Four people have declined to talk to me this morning. One woman said they‚Äôre not supposed to talk to the media.

@MrsClowLibrary Hmmm... it‚Äôs not super clearly written. Because the district news release pegs that shortfall at $9.1 million. https://t.co/EenOAUhlqy
On average, grades 4-12 class size increase would be 3 students, according to the district.		I reached out to Rick Wilson for comment, but if they negotiated for 22 hours he‚Äôs probably asleep.
The district claims they‚Äôd have to cut 92.4 teaching positions, 55.6 admins and 130.2 classified positions to cover the cost of the proposal.

Rosemary Fryer called for a motion to move the meeting into another location. Michelle Giovannozzi made the motion. Teachers voted 3 to 1 to move the meeting, essentially closing it to the public. The press was allowed, I stayed behind to chat with parents/teachers.
Ok, that was chaos. Here‚Äôs what went down: the board began considering a series of contingency resolutions to respond in the event of a strike. Wendy Smith kept voting them down. There were cheers, screams, booing, etc.

Here's another fun bit of school strike trivia: The last teacher strike in Clark County, according to PERC, was in 1981, when Evergreen teachers were on strike for 12 days. At the time, only 350 teachers were involved. Today, 1,800.

@Wilsoncriscione Hey, quick clarification. Are teachers voting tonight whether to strike up there?
@SupplyChainBrew Well, keep in mind teachers are spread out. They're all at their home campuses.
In the 78 teacher strikes in Washington state since 1976, strikes typically last about seven days. It'd be out of the ordinary for this strike to extend until Sept. 17, the cut off date for health care premiums.
Here's the specific resolution: "In the event employees do not return to work by Sept. 10, 2018, compensation will be suspended. In the event employees do not return to work by Sept. 17, health benefits premium payments will be suspended." https://t.co/itoZb7HHYo

@EWAEmily the fact I deleted that tweet and tweeted it again because I screwed up the thread is also a perfect Evergreen Education Journalist thing to happen.
The point is, the numbers we're reporting are accurate. We're not making any specific comment on those numbers by reporting them, we're just reporting them. That's what journalism is. Do with that information what you will. I'm out.
@nealtmorton I'm so, so tired, Neal.
We're not talking average income in the Portland-metro area here, which would have a range of zero to millions of dollars. Our goal posts aren't so wide here that an average is a sketchy measure.
In Battle Ground, for example, the district has proposed a salary range of $46,599 to $90,154. The average salary would be $72,760 -- not quite right in the middle there, but pretty close to it.
Now, for you nerds ready to decry "But averages can be skewed!" I know that, thanks. I'm pretty OK at numbers. That's why we're also reporting the proposed ranges of teacher salaries, which generally align with what average salaries are.
Here is more information documenting how teacher salaries and benefits break down. There appears to be at least one error here -- McCleary teachers for sure are not making an average salary of $10K. That'd be insane and illegal. https://t.co/GBee9iNrK4
There is, in Washington state, a very, VERY broad range of average teacher salaries. The Dixie School District, a rural district northeast of Walla Walla, has an average teacher salary of $46,690. In Everett, average teacher salary is $88,568.
Here's the deal: In Clark County, average teacher salaries range between about $59,000 at the low end -- Green Mountain -- to $76,000 at the high end -- Camas. Now, that does include time, responsibility and incentive pay in addition to base pay. It doesn't include benefits.
We've been getting a lot of questions about the average salary numbers that we've been reporting, claiming we're taking the numbers the district is feeding us, saying there's no way teachers average salaries of $71,000 a year or whatever.
I'ma do a thread. Get ready, education nerds.		This is about... average teacher salary.

That resolution is approved unanimously. Steach is gonna talk to the board for a bit.
Sports will still happen even if there's a strike because coaches are under a different contract. Co-curricular activities like band, orchestra, robotics, other clubs will not.
That includes restricting who can go on district property, closing facilities, hiring substitutes, etc.

And you have to pay reporters, too. Starting wage at my newspaper is $30somethingK a year. When you try to dilute our work by copying and pasting it, refusing to pay for it or bypassing the paywall, you're stealing from people making well under the median wage in Clark County.

Anyway meeting adjourned.
There's a bit of drama happening. A woman tried to speak and was told she couldn't because her name had been called, she missed her turn and now people are yelling. "This is terrible," a woman says.
A couple of people just spoke in support of the FLASH curriculum, particularly its lessons about consent and abuse.
@nerdliness I don't even have whiskey at home.
New student representatives were sworn in today and they both look totally shell shocked.
A woman whose name I missed speaking in support: "There‚Äôs a lot of fear, there‚Äôs a lot of hatred, a lot of misunderstanding around this curriculum. That shows we need more education."
@nerdliness It‚Äôs all the same people.
@MorelandPrint Yeah I was very confused too.
A woman, Cathleen Palmer, is up. Sounds like she's in tears as she talks about how this curriculum "is not appropriate for this community."
Doug Sheddy, who was the guy who spoke outside, said he's very concerned about any curriculum approved by Planned Parenthood, King County or the transgender agenda.
@MorelandPrint I was wrong! It's CSE. Comprehensive sex ed.
Dick Rylander is here. Apparently the school board is limited public comments to three people on any given subject and Rylander's not happy about that.
KGW showed up.
"If we continue to clap, we're going to close this meeting," Ken Root says to the audience.
Back inside. There's some public comment on this happening.
A woman stands up and says kids shouldn‚Äôt be exposed to ‚Äúseverely X-rated material.‚Äù
