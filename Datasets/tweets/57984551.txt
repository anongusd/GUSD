@MarkAmodeiNV2 @lvchamber Would love to see something like this in Reno, and open to public! You work for all@of us, right?
@Nozrati @kylegriffin1 Well, I am part of society. And as I see it, voting is personal, I am casting my ballot for what most represents my values. I would say most of the time what I value aligns with society.
@Nozrati @kylegriffin1 I will vote for the Democratic candidate regardless of who that candidate may be. And, if a valid Republican candidate decides to primary 45, then I will weigh all options and decide which is best for me. As for expectations...I am looking at it realistically.
@Nozrati @kylegriffin1 I would be all for that, but he is not ever going to own his lies? The way I see it, we just dig in and do whatever we can to put anyone else in the WH in 2020, but we are pretty much stuck with him. We resist, we protest, we pick our battles. But I can’t expect him to not lie?
@betsarms Oh he does! He just is a grumpy old man trapped in a dog suit....
@betsarms They love YOU!!!!
@kylegriffin1 Why stop his fantasy. If he is happy and his base is happy and no wall ever gets built why can’t we all just live in the same cuckoo clock?
@SenJackyRosen @W4WNV Thank you Senator Rosen! This has great potential! Can’t wait to read it! I will be in DC next week, and would love to thank you in person!
@bubbagump324 My source of joy and love!!! Hope the rest are doing as well!!!! Any new pix of Heart?
@tonyposnanski Who pays anyone with a check?

@BacksweetBranch @bubbagump324 Pretty sure both dog and human mom are pretty tired!!! Dog mom had 10 puppies, which is a large litter by normal dog standards, and any sort of bulldog standard it is insane! But they are also the cutest things on twitter! And it is #LoveYourPetsDay!

@nethornk @GeoWilliams68 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump Pence and Schumer can tag team in! 😂😂😂😂😂
@nethornk @GeoWilliams68 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump That is a joke, by the way. To demonstrate I have not stopped smiling throughout this!
@nethornk @GeoWilliams68 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump Just saying, a cage match between Speaker Pelosi and POTUS would make for a rather fun pay-per-view event, and all the proceeds would go to border security 😂😂😂 my money is on Pelosi all the way!
@LeslieGodbe @mrsktj @MarkAmodeiNV2 I live here, now. But I did spend nearly 30 years of my existence as a California born and raised native!
@nethornk @GeoWilliams68 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump I concur! Thank you both! But especially GeoWilliams68! I didn’t see anyone getting personal, rude, or threatening! At the end of the day, I think we all want what is best for Nevada and our nation.
@GeoWilliams68 @nethornk @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump I don’t think Bloomberg is as liberal as you may. But, hey, opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and most of them stink (my own included!) I can produce more... if you are inclined. And I would happily read anything you post.
@mrsktj @LeslieGodbe @MarkAmodeiNV2 Thank you!!!! There are many out of state donors, and I have made plenty of donations to candidates in other states. At the end of the day, national elections matter to our entire nation!
@GeoWilliams68 @nethornk @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump Shutting the government down should never even be an option. The people who are effected the most by these actions could probably care less about if or if not a wall exists. I vaguely remember a time when politics was about compromise and discussion. Not so much anymore...
@GeoWilliams68 @nethornk @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump And a report from Bloomberg:	https://t.co/r1AxzV7U0V

@GeoWilliams68 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @SteveSisolak We will see.... I really don’t mind paying more in taxes, if this means better education, better actual national security, and clean water and air. It is part of our civic duty.
@GeoWilliams68 @nethornk @MarkAmodeiNV2 @realDonaldTrump Well, a little research will show that a wall will not stop the drugs from coming.

@PhotoCassidy @MarkAmodeiNV2 Very nice to meet you! Always happy to “meet” a shipmate! Nevada deserves so much better than Mark Amodei!
@LeslieGodbe @MarkAmodeiNV2 Yay!!!!! I am ready for Nevada to be entirely blue!!!!
@MarkAmodeiNV2 I pretty much ignored you over the past couple of years while I worked hard to help Jacky Rosen get elected... now that task is done I can focus on you! Expect phone calls, tweets, letters...I will hold you accountable for representing ALL Nevadans.
@MarkAmodeiNV2 You are wrong sir, tonight’s vote was a vote showing the will of the people. Both senate and House have proposed budget spending plans, and yet the petulant child that sits in the WH refuses. Pick a side Mark, we, the people are watching!
@MarkAmodeiNV2 So, you are saying it is more responsible to shut the government down over funding for an ineffective wall, that the majority of Americans (and Nevadans) don’t want? How about you listen to your constituents...

@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Possibly... what is the desired outcome of a conversation?
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller We will have to disagree about the perception of who collapsed what. As a woman of color, I don’t really feel helped right now... if anything, DT has emboldened a swath of Americans that are hypocritical, misinformed, and dangerous. Blame should be placed on Reagan and Bush Sr.
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller I can keep going....
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Dean Heller is not interested in what the majority of Nevadans want or their voice. He has had many opportunities to perform his responsibilities as outlined in the constitution. And he has failed.
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Dean thinks he works for Trump and McConnell, he doesn’t. Dean was part of the senate when Merrick Garland was not even given a hearing. That is his job, he failed to do so.
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Dean voted for the shabby attempt at repeal and replace after Sandoval implored him not@to, and after he said he wouldn’t. Heller accepts money from NRA, and has done nothing in the aftermath of the Vegas shooting but offer thoughts and prayers.
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Right now, as I see things, Rs are looking to keep holding on to the notion that aging white men know what is best for the nation. Spoiler alert: they don’t.
@KelleySimon19 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller Your meme has little to no bearing on today’s partisan climate. But, here is the thing. My perfect Congress is full of equal representation.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I really wish I could understand why you are the way you are. Were you abused as a child? Did you get bullied exhaustively? Did the girl of your dreams reject you? Did you get hazed in college? Something is seriously wrong with you.
@HamillHimself Probably because he doesn't really understand how Twitter works at a most basic level.
@tedcruz Maybe, instead of insulting Beto (and "Hollywood liberals") you should try listening to what he said, because from where I am sitting, no one has said it better.
@EdKrassen Every single word he utters at this point is laughable, and every minute the GOP stands by and does nothing (or worse, pushes his agenda) is a joke. The fact that there are still people who think he "deserves a chance" is infuriating. I am simply baffled at this point.

@DeanHeller I really could go on and on and on, but what really is the point... when you lose in November, you can spend your retirement analyzing why you lost. But it may be because you don’t have Nevada’s interests in mind, and care solely about lining your own pockets.
@DeanHeller Are you willing to argue that ALL documents regarding Kavanaugh be made available to all senators? Are you willing to stand up against Trump when he insults your colleauges? Are you able to say you have never lied to Nevadans?
@DeanHeller Here is how you can possibly win my vote: if admit that you are complicit in the current political atmosphere in our nation right now. How did YOU handle Merrick Garland? Did you ignore your constitutional responsibility, or did you give him a FAIR hearing?
@GOP @GOPChairwoman So, should I expect @DeanHeller @SenDeanHeller to knock on my door? I hope so, since he won’t hold an in person town hall, I may finally be able to get answers! Good luck with this “movement”, because collectively you don’t have much else going for you!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman This is hilarious! So what she is saying is that they are going to follow the democrat play book for campaigning?? I don’t think it will do much good when you are running nazis and white supremacists, but sure I would happily open my door for a nazi!
@RosenforNevada Stay close with Senator Masto, hopefully, the Dems in senate can, in the very least sue for the unreleased documents, and by then, it will be your vote to cast against Kavanaugh!
@GenMhayden Thank you! And much gratitude to all who signed! You all served honorably and courageously, and still continue to do so! There are not enough words to convey how sincerely proud I am of THIS America! Great leaders standing up and together for what is just and right!

@SenCortezMasto You are right! How do we stop taking giant leaps backward? I know you and Jacky will work to bring positive change to Nevada, but there are still children in concentration camps, the midterms are vulnerable, and I am tired of the lies from the WH, with little to no consequences.
@DeanHeller I think the only hope you have of winning in Nov. is if you register as Dem, vote against Kavanaugh, reunite all the children, solve racism, immigration, &amp; health care, &amp; stop #45 from lying, all before Election Day, and even then I still think Jacky would make a better Senator!

@SenDeanHeller @KRNV When you retire in November, how will you spend your free time? I think you should write a memoir about how you decided to repeatedly side with party, as opposed to what your constituents want. A how-to-lose-your-precarious Senate seat.
@JeffFlake But here is where your outrage ends. A simple tweet, then it is business as usual. At least, try to act consistently and as a hypocrite.
@BillOReilly You just tweeted about her, so I guess that makes you part of the problem.
@senorrinhatch Merrick Garland- you and your ilk have the memory of a toddler. You all act so incredulous when the Dems are doing exactly what you allndid. Don’t like it? Then stop doing it.

@SenateMajLdr You are a disgrace to the American government. You single handedly wrote the book on obstructionism, and failed to do your constitutional  responsibilities on several occasions. Consequences may not happen soon, but they will, and you will be held accountable for your acts.
@BillOReilly It is really simple: State your opinion without being an asshole. If one cannot do that, it is not their opinions that need to be evaluated.
@LindseyGrahamSC You really should be hanging your head in shame, quietly resigning, and going away for a long time. You didn’t just put party over country, you put Trump over party and country. You mention McCain throughout, and where are you when your president says disparaging comments?
@perlmutations You never fail to illicit a smile. Thank you for your words in these dark times... I look forward to your tweets and "Perls" of Wisdom.

@IvankaTrump Boom! Racism solved... thanks Ivanka, this tweet has solved all of the divisiveness, racism, bigotry. 	OR 	How about instead, YOU march into the presidents office and demand that he either resigns, or, stops his attacks on diversity!
@RosenforNevada Please hold them accountable! For the life of me I cannot understand why there are aero consequences for the actions of the WH. The constant lies, the overt and covert racism, the reckless rhetoric, conflicts of interest, the list is endless....
@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada Bwahahahahahahahaha look at you trying to smear Jacky Rosen? Too late Dean, we see right through all of it. You actions speak louder than any disparaging words for Jacky. Want to talk about health care?
@Jobu4Real @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada And the same conservative talking points. So, here we are... so, you asked, I answered, you argued, I am not sure how to get past this point. So, I will vote my conscience, you will yours and “democracy” should work.
@Jobu4Real @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada Background checks, wait period, limits on assault weapons, bans on bump stocks and modifications, required range time, funding for research and education, there are many avenues that could be explored and at least given due dilligence. Our status quo is not working.
@MSNBC Why is this even news? Of course it was a lie. He is incapable of telling the truth about anything. Ever!
@betsarms @SimonMaloy Exactly, it’s all about ratings and money. This is the same WH that signed off on Omarosa going on Celebrity Big Brother with 24/7 cameras on two minutes after leaving her “job”.

@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada Or maybe she is working with Nevadans to come to a consensus for common sense gun reform legislation.
@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada She is probably working to help reunite the families that you are oddly MIA. Deadlines for this administration to reunite families came and went and where were you?
@SenDeanHeller No, you will not always... you will only do so for photo ops and campaigning. Your actions speak much louder than your words, and there are not enough words to make up for your dedication to a failing political party over the needs of Nevadans and Americans!

@DeanHeller 153 veterans represent the 300,000 Nevada veterans?!?!?!?! So, as I read it, either the remaining 299,847 veterans are not for Dean, or he grossly misrepresented the views and values of Nevada veterans. I, as a proud navy veteran in no way shape or form would ever support Dean.

@SenateMajLdr Instead of blaming others for your shortcomings, why don't you start taking ownership of YOUR decisions. No one put a gun to your head and told you to obstruct and ignore the constitution. Think about the legacy you could create if you would stop being an asshole.
@ashleyn1cole I think it is unfair blaming the MSM. Here is the thing, he is POTUS. And in any other situation everything POTUS does is news. It may not be immediate, but ALL of his actions, decisions, utterances affect us all. They are doing their job, they are not to blame here, he is.

@RandPaul I watched you in both Fox and CNN. And clearly your priorities are not with the United States. Did you not take an oath to support and defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. Pesky little thing like the constitution to try to hold you to standards. Resign.
RT @rolandscahill: At this point, no one should refer to Trump as either a ‘President’ or even an ‘American’
Terrifying.... https://t.co/ghzGVSswkD
@aravosis @wolfblitzer @RandPaul I am so disgusted.

@LindseyGrahamSC Who is going to fix it? You? @SenateMajLdr? @VP? John Kelly, Mattis, Pompeo, Ryan, Nielsen, SHS, who?? There is so much wrong with the US today, that it is going to take decades to fix. The first step is your resignation.
@CoryBooker I am guessing every American who can read is outraged. I am guessing every American who has a conscience and soul is outraged. I am guessing that the only people who are not outraged are either Russian or completely okay with the POTUS' behavior and actions. Do something!!!
@SenateMajLdr No tweet about what your president did today? No, you will remain silent while our nation is crumbling. The senate is your responsibility, so, if Obama is to blame, you as leader of an equal branch, are equally to blame. Resign.
@SenDeanHeller @nevadaappeal Today, you hopefully at least watched your president stand on a global stage and state for everyone to hear: I believe Putin over US intelligence gathered, analyzed, and actionable evidence. You watched that, and your silence, equates to complicity. #countrybeforeparty
@David_Leavitt @realDonaldTrump Every day would be a great day for him to resign.
@DanaBashCNN @SenJohnMcCain They will tweet today, they will say that this is awful, but tomorrow there will be a new shiny object, Kavanaugh will be confirmed, and our nation will continue to erode under the ruse that is the president.
@SenJohnMcCain Senator, I do hope you are doing well. That being said, I have the utmost respect for you. I don't always agree with your viewpoints, but your longstanding service to America makes you a hero on many levels. Now, that being said, do more than a statement, do what you can. Please!

@JeffFlake You, and some other Republican Senators, have tweeted opposition to today's events. But nothing today is a surprise to anyone. What is most depressing, is that tomorrow you will forget this happened, and the next "distraction" will distract us, and our nation remains vulnerable.
@marcorubio You, and some other Republican Senators, have tweeted opposition to today's events. But nothing today is a surprise to anyone. What is most depressing, is that tomorrow you will forget this happened, and the next "distraction" will distract us, and our nation remains vulnerable.
@BetteMidler Maybe she put it on one of her 33,000 missing emails on the missing server. There are so many people in our country right now that are incapable of seeing this or hearing this. It is so tragic and the worst is that they are destroying our nation over partisan passion. Wake up US!
@davidaxelrod And god knows what was said behind closed doors.... it was more than "collusion" it was out and out treason. The second he said he believe Putin over US intelligence agencies, he sold our nation. GOP doesn't care about America or patriotism, they are complicit with their silence.
@LindseyGrahamSC "Missed Opportunity" you make it sound like there was a sale on garden gnomes. Your president just sided with Russia over US intelligence agencies. Think about that and let that sink in. I assume you know this, but just don't care #ComplicitGOP
@jaketapper But, they won't come out and say so publicly. I am so frustrated and infuriated with a nation that I am proud to have served. We are building concentration camps, banning religions, and besties with dictators, and so many lies that facts no longer have meaning.
@JeffFlake Senator, it is shameful, but what is worse, I fear, is that it is not surprising. And yet, you will tweet, and may go on CNN or Fox and say it is shameful, you will do nothing more to put a stop to this dangerous and optically treasonous behavior.

@SenFeinstein Ma'am, almost everything the Trump administration does is horrific. Please fight like hell to make things right. We desperately need you and your colleagues (regardless of party) to realize the threat he poses and do whatever in your constitutional granted powers to stop him!
@BetteMidler This would be much cheaper and much less of a burden to our military - let's just get a bunch of "crisis actors" to dress up like the Royal British Guard....
@SenCortezMasto Yes, yes we do. Now we have clear evidence to begin to make sure that this doesn't happen in November, or 2020, or anywhere or anytime else. We, the people, are looking to you, the elected officials, to protect us from all enemies both foreign and domestic.
@DeanHeller Political Fact: You have no spine, and no fortitude to stand up and do what is right for Nevadans. You care only about your self interests, party, and whatever you can do to stay in the good graces of the embarrassment that is the current POTUS. #NovemberIsComing
@ChaseMit @vox I agree, they can fuck off. No one forces these people to these interviews, if they are gullible enough, and the thing is, they do it to themselves. And I have to see the show, but I bet Cohen is non-partisan, and goes after those willing to say or do anything for an audience.
@LindseyGrahamSC Words you will rarely hear me say: you are right, Senator Graham. Mostly because Obama didn't really make many mistakes. Sure, there was the whole beige suit, and saluting with coffee in his hands. Here is the thing, karma is coming, and hopefully around Tuesday, November 6.
Wow.... just wow!!! https://t.co/tXX29l9vin
@marcorubio Either do what your oath of office says, or shut the hell up and resign. Our nation is under attack from both foreign and domestic agents looking to secure power and wealth at the expense of our democracy. You are just as guilty as the rest of your so-called party.
@marcorubio But, the media, HRC, you, the FBI, and Obama are NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Trump has a responsibility to protect us from all enemies, both foreign and domestic. Instead, he kisses Putin's ass, and disgraces our allies. (5/3)
@marcorubio And here is the tricky thing about the MSM. They have to report on this stuff. At the time, they didn't know, and even if they did know, and reported it, pretty sure the state run media Fox News would have blamed Obama and HRC. (4/3)
@marcorubio And then to make it all even sweeter, you say nothing to the administration about canceling the "summit" and instead send a lengthy tweet saying absolutely nothing we didn't know? Have you no shame? Have you no pride in the country you serve? (3/3)
@marcorubio Then, on top of that, you really choose to ignore Manafort, Papadopapaless, Flynn? And all of the other indictments and evidence linking the Trump campaign to Russia? And you accuse the "left" of ignoring facts? (2/3)
@marcorubio I don't even know where to start with this. So, you have known all along that Putin was was behind the meddling in the election, yet, you do nothing to put in motion any sort of way of preventing it again? (1/3)

@jonathanweisman I so wanted him to point back at the GOP and say "What about the bias you are all displaying in this hearing?" As opposed to it being a fact finding investigative look at what happened it was a circus of grandstanding and trying to poke holes in Strzok's credibility.

@Sara_in_Reno @SenDeanHeller Is that a rhetorical question? No, he has no decency.

He will have all the time in the world to find decency after November. #gojackygo
@SenDeanHeller Good morning Deano - good to see you are doing your constitutional duty of ass kissing to the president.

@ShirlsAdams @PressSec @POTUS @POTUS44 @MichelleObama Are you saying SHS lies? I am betting that you doctored these images. That is actually Jordan Peele with the Queen? Or maybe Tim Meadows? Or maybe that is not really the queen, but a Kenyan prince giving Obama his rightful place on the throne.
@PressSec I don't believe anything you say. I also read that you may be soon out the door. I hope that you don't ever find employment again. Hard to say you are an honest broker, when you have done nothing but lie for the past year. Your soul hates you as much as America does.
@SenateMajLdr @Enquirer Hi, not sure if you have heard of him, Merrick Garland? He sat around and waited for YOU to do your constitutional responsbility and give him a hearing. You didn't have to approve him, no one expected that, but we did expect you to do your job. Sad that there are no consequences. https://t.co/lZxuh3qtWU

Exactly how can any of this end well for the majority of Americans? I don't understand how so many people are okay with internment of anyone, let alone the separation of children from their families. In the next few years, I suspect it will get even worse. Till then, I day drink! https://t.co/gQFEKzGxou

@RepKihuen @realDonaldTrump @CBSPolitics As I recall, Judge Roy Moore was impeached and removed from office for failing to follow an order from a federal court... Can we start to impeach 45 for failing to meet the court ordered deadline?
@DeanHeller You have some gall. What about your thoughts on the constitution when Merrick Garland was waiting? You are clearly not qualified to be a US Senator if you think you can pick and choose when the constitution is convenient for you. RESIGN! #novemberiscoming
@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada But JUST TODAY you voted against limiting the president's power regarding tarriffs. What does that do? It certainly sends a message to your constituents that the presidents feelings matter more than their economy, and the founding fathers for equal and balanced power. #resign
@DeanHeller @SenDeanHeller - would you kindly resign. You are hurting your constituents, you are hurting the nation, and you have disgraced us enough. @RosenforNevada @RepJackyRosen will be a vast improvement to your spineless maneuvering and failure to do your actual job! https://t.co/zKWgZV1EC1

@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Trust me, I am on your side... but the president lies. So, anything he says, on record, in a tweet or standing on AF1, is a lie. He will take the position of Pence and his evangelicals, and if not, they will probably cut him loose. This is why they voted for him. He knows this.

@BillOReilly I don't know what kind of stupid you are, but find me ONE single sitting Democrat in Congress that wants "open borders". STOP LYING! Your disinformation campaign is going to end up in tragedy.
@kylegriffin1 I have said this every Monday since November 9, 2016.
@DeanHeller And my take is simple logic: Nevadans, if you are tired of obstruction, then you need to vote against Dean Heller. After all, he was part of the original obstructionists when he failed to do his constitutional responsibility and even grant Merrick Garland a hearing.

@DeanHeller QUESTION: will you admit you are a liar and a hypocrite? How many times have you voted on party lines, as opposed to what is best for your state? ANSWER: No! And healthcare, when you went against Governor Sandoval’s recommendation. And what? Sided with party over state.
@RepJackyRosen Thanks Jacky! I honestly and genuinely feel you have veteran’s interests at the forefront of your decisions. Proud to be a Nevadan, and proud to get to vote for you in the fall!

@DeanHeller While there may be very few who speak out here on Twitter, I know I am not alone. Either acknowledge the hypocrisy and your inability to adhere to your constitutional responsibilities with Garland, or be the leader you claim and do what is right and wait till after the midterm.
@DeanHeller The republicans refused to even uphold their constitutional obligation. That set the tone, it was a gamble that McConnell was willing to stake. And now less than a hiccup later, your own actions have set the tone. Do not cast blame, just own up to the hypocrisy.
@DeanHeller I do not actually expect you to answer, but as a voter, your integrity is something I look for in a candidate. And this self-serving disregard for what is just and fair by your very own standards WRT Merrick Garland and your stance now, is very telling of your character.
@DeanHeller Can you please give me a valid argument why this is your stance now, and not when Justice Scalia died? Please explain the reversal? Please explain how you can in one breath defend the constitution and seemingly yesterday say that the constitution was wrong?
@QuancyClayborne Now is not the time for in-party hostility. What is done is done, and now we must all come together and unite for the fight of our lives.

@realDonaldTrump I really don’t care, do u?
@SenDeanHeller So to sum up my thoughts.... you don’t deserve to be a senator, and I suspect you will be looking at early retirement in November. Maybe give you time to reflect on the value of your word and the consequences of your actions.
@SenDeanHeller You rewrote the constitution with Merrick Garland and your inability to even do the simplest of tasks in your job description.

@AynRandPaulRyan Yes!!!! And one that delegitimizes the president and all he has done over the past 18 months is reversed, to include Gorsuch. And he implicates Pence, Ryan, and McConnell. Sure, I could also win the lottery, and Idris Elba could fall in love with me.
@RosenforNevada Representative Rosen, you have everything I can give!!! Where do I volunteer? How can I do more than give (and I have given!) but I want to do more than dollars! You can have my heart, soul, blood and tears! I will fight to the death for what is fundamentally right and just!
@RosenforNevada The future of our diverse amazing population is at stake. We are interning immigrants from Mexico and Central America, we are banning a large swath of Muslim from even traveling here, clinics can lie to patients, and racial gerrymandering stands... what is next? FIGHT FOR US!!!!
"The fight of our our lives is here"... for many, the fight has been for their entire existence, and for many more that fight has been for the past 3 years or so. And people have died in this fight. I don't see much hope, but I am trying! https://t.co/3slXjqZuV7

@SenateMajLdr Your memory is slipping, perhaps it is time for you to retire before dementia really ruins our nation. Oh, wait... You need to go away.... our founding fathers would cringe and despise what you are doing to our constitution and nation.
@SenDeanHeller @DeanHeller @CatherineForNV @RepJackyRosen Dear Nevada Senators, in 2016 when @SenateMajLdr essentially refused to do his job and at least grant Merrick Garland a hearing.

@mkraju You mean giving McConnell another pick.
@DeanHeller The more that I think about this tweet, the more angry I am. I was willing to give my life for this country. And you are willing to put party over country, time and time again. I hope every vet in NV realizes you are pond scum and a selfish jerk. #jackyrosenfornvsenate

@DanaBashCNN And "they" are dancing in the streets celebrating, and "we" are left stunned, wondering what the heck is wrong with our country and almost half of the people in it, and how will we recover or even IF we will recover, and what do we do in the meantime. Oh, be civil.

We know that what Cheetoh is going to sign will keep families together, but keep them together in detention facilities. Family detention centers. While this is an improvement, it is still ABSOLUTELY inhumane to intern any person because they are seeking asylum or a better life.

@NBCPolitics @SenDeanHeller @MarkAmodeiNV2 Where are your names here? What are you doing to protect American values? Why are you allowing this to happen in our country? Are you so dim and feckless that you are willing to rip families apart and intern children? S.3036!
@Scaramucci @MichaelAvenatti @TheDemocrats @POTUS Anthony, can we do more than "hope"  - Hope is not a plan. How about you call your people. How about we get the voices of Americans who can understand how evil and wrong this is and start screaming for it stop! NOW! Use your 'celebrity' - use your influence - use your connections
@thehill @SenDeanHeller @GovSandoval @MarkAmodeiNV2 @RepJackyRosen @repdinatitus @RepKihuen  Join Colorado. Stop this. Do anything and everything you can within your power as elected officials. There is NOTHING okay about any of this.... Stop the cruelty!
@RuPaul #Rupaul2020 You can heal us!
We should be so lucky to one day have a President Rupaul! Heed these words!!!!! I will also include @SenDeanHeller and @MarkAmodeiNV2 as being shameless cowards. Every minute children remain interned in camps our leaders have failed to protect our nation and values. https://t.co/pLjfg2ZbgJ

@RepJackyRosen I get that this is important, but there is nothing more paramount than stopping the practice of separating families and interning children as pawns for a wall.
@AngrierWHStaff @SenDeanHeller @MarkAmodeiNV2 DO SOMETHING!!!! I will stop tagging you in all of these tweets and let you continue your ridiculous form of party politics if you just stop interning children and separating families. This is not us. This is disgusting and beyond evil!
@amnestyusa @DeanHeller @MarkAmodeiNV2 THIS. IS. UNACCEPTABLE. Your silence is part of what is destroying our country. You have to know that this is disgusting and abhorrent. Children are not tools to be used as pawns for building a stupid wall.

@SenDeanHeller EVERY democrat senator is co-sponsoring S.3036. Now, step up and be the first GOP Senator to do the right thing. I promise others will follow.

@betsarms Why does it seem like there is not a lot of outrage at all? To me, interning any group of people for any reasons is akin to Nazi germany. Or when we interned Japanese in WWII, or slavery. At the very least why not put them in family housing? Keep them together? 😡🤬😡🤬😡
@RWPUSA @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump I wish I could vote for you!!!! And yes, we are fed up with all of them!!!

Be a leader, not a follower. https://t.co/7aNgWqcEKi

@Lesdoggg It would be nice to get away from giving him any kind of attention. But he certainly seems to go out of his way to give comedians so much fodder. I think it is important that we have a comedic side to the terrors and horrors of our reality.

@BillOReilly You are incompetent and unmoored if you honestly think this was a success. We gave up military exercises, got a pie crust promise from a lying tyrannical despot, and gave NK mountains of propaganda, to include a well produced ridiculous movie trailer. Not seething, terrified!
@GeorgeTakei I think they need hypocrisy to thrive. Like it is water. They relish it, and almost take pride over how low they can sink in a quagmire of lies and hypocritical rhetoric. It is a game to them, and sadly, humanity is at stake.
@realDonaldTrump Considering we lied with the Iran deal, and NK lies all the same, can you please clarify what “good faith” means?
@realDonaldTrump You realize this contradicts your push for the biggest budget increase to the military. So, what do you propose USFK does with all this saved money? A pizza party?
@PressSec Biggest and quite possibly stupidest publicity stunt. Meanwhile, can you explain the $82 million in income reported by the daughter-wife?
@Acosta Stay strong!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hypocrite!!!! I just want you to call a spade a spade, literally - you chastised Obama and his actions because he was black. I can't think of any other reason. It is vile, and god willing you will not be in a position to degrade real American values much longer. Go to pasture...
@HouseGOP You are a disgrace to our country, the founding fathers, and pretty much anyone with a pulse. How about you start standing up and preserving our democracy, full transparency, and less cronyism and partisan politics to push your racist agendas. #bluewave

@SenCoryGardner We just sent a message to the entire world. All you need to do is be a tyrannical dictator and say "I am a changed man" and then all is forgiven??? It seems like the entire government has lost their minds. But, I guess 70 years of historical precedence means nothing.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS Or not, but we will scale back our troops and stop the "provocative exercises" thus weakening our defense of the peninsula. Who stands to gain the most?? Top three: DPRK, China, and Russia... I am counting the days till you are gone.
@PressSec @POTUS While this tweet is probably true, the bottom line is that your credibility is so shot that I actually had to look up when KJU departed. Why? Because all you do is lie. You are a liar, and complicit doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. I hope you go to jail https://t.co/XWLHMhuc52
@realDonaldTrump I am praying to all of the gods that he doesn't even clear the primaries, BUT, if he does, you can bet every stolen dollar you have taken since being elected that I will do whatever I can to stop @AdamLaxalt from being the next governor of Nevada. He is corrupt and just not good.
@tedcruz You desperately want to be a “cool guy”. But, in reality, you are a sad man who lies to Americans and are complicit in the undermining of our democracy. Please resign!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Because he is the only sitting president who has never read the constitution? Or is it how he grabs pussies? Or maybe how he is alienating our allies. There is ZERO comparison to Reagan.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This quip is about as dumb as the First Daughter-Wife quoting a Chinese proverb. So, if you make fake peace with another habitual liar, but go to war with our allies, where is the courage really? Seriously asking, would love a response.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump 100% agree. I feel like we got played by DPRK, China, and to a lesser extent Russia. Why? Because the fragile ego of our own dictator needs a Nobel Peace Prize just to stay on par with Obama. Our nation has sunk to new lows that I didn’t think possible. Keep resisting!
@marcorubio @NickKristof And how many people will be effected by this suspended belief that KJU is a changed man? But, it’s good that we weaken our defenses on the peninsula, because China and Russia certainly didn’t want that to happen 🙄
@GOP If Kim Jong Un can say “I am a changed man.” And we go running into his arms with enough propaganda footage to last a century, if HRC says that she is a changed woman will you embrace her?
@GOP And what did we commit to? Don’t want to tell the whole story? Worried about too many words confusing your ardent supporters?
@RealDonad_Trump twitter is tricky! https://t.co/bsFwHjLGW1

@DonaldJTrumpJr And you are an asshole. Funny thing though... she has done more in the last year than you have as a productive member of society. Why do you insist on bullying her? Don’t your have interests to have conflicts over?

@marcorubio You are right. And why do you think DPRK is excited to sit down with @realDonaldTrump?? Not for peace talks and negotiation... but you are all smart enough to figure that out!
@DeanHeller Or “I support the president unequivocally, even when actual facts indicate that he lacks morals and intelligence to make informed decisions about our nation.”
@DeanHeller Or “freedom of religion only applies to Christianity.” Or “I obstructed Obama for four years because I was a puppet for McConnel. Now I will complain about Dems obstructing Trump.”
@DeanHeller Or “less regulations means more money for me and my donors, at the expense of clean air and water.” Or “in spite of increases in mass shooting, I will not support any education or research to prevent future shootings.”
@DeanHeller Let’s really hear how you stand on the issues. Can you just stop BS’ing us and come out say “As a legislator I know what is best for women’s reproductive health.” Or “I will support the agenda of the NRA above the health and welfare of Nevadans.”
@DeanHeller How about health care? Immigration/dreamers? Gun reform? Education? Women’s rights? Environment/renewable energy? You know if you stop pandering to lobbyists, and actually listen to your constituents, you may find compromise and understanding are powerful tools!

@SenDeanHeller @NVHemophilia Can you explain how Bleeding Disorders warrant a tweet, but you remain silent on Women’s month and international women’s day? Um, aren’t some of your constituents women? Were you not born from a woman? Did you not marry a woman? Priorities seem a little out whack! 1/2

@GOP LIAR!!!!!!!!!! The Dems didn’t do this, you did! If your children respond the way you do to taking responsibility I expect they are undisciplined monsters! Just like I view you!
@realDonaldTrump You are single handedly destroying our nation. I don’t like to hate anyone or anything, but I cannot do anything but hate you. There is a special place in hell for you and your WH sell-outs and colleagues.
@SenDeanHeller How many Nevadans does JP Morgan employ?? How does this help Nevadans? Oh, that’s right, it doesn’t!
@RWPUSA Will want? Already do want! Run for office! You are amazing!
@SenDeanHeller Stop lying to us and yourself.
@PressSec When you realize what you have done for this dream job of yours and that no amount of repenting will save you from hell, please post a selfie. You are disgusting and you are responsible for ruining our nation!
@PressSec You are pathetic. Stop pandering, and literally lying to American people. This is not true! No one is in the dark in the military, no one is being deprived of anything! How do I know? I proudly served this nation’s navy, in Afghanistan, twice.
@CoryBooker You know, I am a huge fan, and I am not saying that you didn’t make the right decision, but, every single member of Congress in both senate and house owns a piece of this. Quit casting blame and get ish done!
Why? https://t.co/fvhFXKAivf
@HouseGOP Or how about this fact: you are using children as bargaining CHIPs... not sure if you get it, but we (voting Americans) do! November needs to get here soon!
@unevadareno yet, you still employ, and give a scholarship to an individual involved with Charlottesville. Take a lesson from University of Alabama. It is never too late to do the right thing! https://t.co/WVjXHDLFJe
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems Dean, you have to lay awake at night and wonder what the consequences will be for this year! It won’t be good... not if you want to keep your job. Maybe you can personally pay for CHIP, or maybe you can personally guarantee Nevada Dreamers status? Your days are numbered!
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems How about DACA and CHIP? What about them? The troops will be fine. I know this because I was a troop in the last shut down. Have you ever been a troop?
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems Dean, that is not how this works, and you know it. Troops will be paid, and emergency personnel will work. But if you want to stop a shut down how about you grow a spine and walk across the aisle and see what helps all of Nevada, not just old white people.
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems This is a complete lie! Do not spread fallacies to push a veiled agenda that hurts Nevadans!
@PressSec @POTUS You will never get your soul back. Enjoy the personal hell you are creating for yourself. You made the decision to lie to millions of people daily. You made the decision to put your own personal goals ahead of our nation. Karmic debt will be huge on this...
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems Fuck you! Do not try to blame the Dems for this!!!!! This is all on you for all of your shady politics to stay in favor with the lowest rated POTUS in history. Keep that up and see how November fares for you. Do right by the people of Nevada, stop party politics!
@SenateMajLdr No, not the Dems.... they are trying to create legislation for all the people not just paid time till elections. You have single handedly disgraced our nation, weakened our congressional processes, and are directly responsible for creating the divide that exists now.

@SenDeanHeller you have a choice. The choice is simple: you either support or condemn the words, actions, and patterned behavior of @RealDonad_Trump. Support and, you also get to be labeled a racist pig, condemn, and you risk your precious base. Do you represent all of Nevada?
@marcorubio (Continued) and just like anyone representing the people of the United States, consequences exist for this behavior, and I fully support impeachment!——- there you go, a free gift! I will wait for your next tweet.
@marcorubio So what exactly is this point of this thread? If you are condemning 45’s words, then just say that! Seems simple enough, let me help you, copy and paste: I am outraged and disgusted by the ongoing pattern of behavior of abject racism by POTUS. (1/2)

@GOP I hear $1,000 goes a long way in shithole countries.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The lowest bar is the one your father has set as president. Seriously, the guy pisses and wants the news to report it, then complains that he is not getting fair coverage. And you, the spawn of Satan?
@KellyannePolls Is this supposed to some kind of burn poem? You all talk about HRC more than CNN! Here is some wood, build a bridge and get over it! You are insufferable and maybe slightly insane.
@PressSec No, that is not true. Wait, the reality will sink in, you will look in the mirror and realize you sold your soul for your 15 minutes, and all you will be left with is the enormity of the lies you have been telling the country and more sadly yourself.
@seanspicer @FoxNews @seanhannity Why? Are you still somehow relevant? Go away!
@seanspicer Do you have a purpose? Or just bored?
@realDonaldTrump Wait, are you the same person who said peaceful protesters in the NFL fed up with racial injustice and systemic oppression should be fired? Look inward, and then resign.

This is what hypocrisy looks like! @KellyannePolls and all others complicit in this current debacle of a WH, you sold your soul for 15 minutes! Hope you got a good price, because karma trumps all! https://t.co/jiScUQFkhz
@PressSec @tedlieu Oh, the irony? Telling someone to stop tweeting and do their job?????? How about you give that advice to your boss. And, since you tweeted, maybe you should stop and do your job! Which is report the facts, not lie! But you have no soul.
@PressSec And when our government completely collapses keep trying to sell this BS. You are a horrible human!
@AprilDRyan Boom! There you go, all we need to sleep safe at night knowing our administration is working for a fair judicial process. Not! Mnuchin holds as much weight in matter of truth as 45. All of them need to go!
And the road to fire Mueller continues. @realDonaldTrump, if you do in fact try to fire Mueller, I suspect nothing would happen. Because @GOP is a bunch of spineless henchmen that care more about the 1% than “we, the people”. If Alabama can elect a dem you should be afraid! 2018! https://t.co/pBe2tRs5cB

@tedcruz @HammillHimself I really have no words for you Ted Cruz. But if you believe that we, the people, believe that ending net neutrality is not a HUGE boon for ISPs, then you are more delusional than an aging and regretful Annakin Skywalker.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I think you need to stay out of political commentary. If you want the cloud of conflicts of interest to stop, it may help to stop involving yourself in these matters. It just really makes you look guilty. I also think you are a few fries short of a happy meal.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Another lie. I feel a lot less safe with the race war @realDonaldTrump is fueling with vitriol and hate. And with the insane tweets directed at NK. Not too mention the domestic terrorism threat from people who have amassed huge weapon caches. Waiting for next mass shooting!
@GOP get your boy in order. How many times did the left hear “move on” after the 2016 general election? Now would be a great time to demonstrate that you are not a bunch of hypocrites. Hold the tax bill and seat Jones. Be magnanimous! It may go a long way! https://t.co/WjoNi59rc6

@GOP Instead of prayers... how about you send some rational legislation. Oh, none of you are rational!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Tell that to PR, POC, victims of Vegas, and anyone else caught in the line of fire of your father
@EricTrump @VP You need to go to jail
@VP @POTUS And for the record I don’t think it is too much to ask the WH to respect the office of the presidency
@VP @POTUS When are you both going to realize that you are assholes
@VP @POTUS You can’t decide what Americans you like better than others, not when you are a Russian investigation away from the presidency
@VP @POTUS And what about LGBTQ Americans that your DOJ basically shit on with his order about religious freedom!
@VP @POTUS Or what about the Americans that your white supremacist friends want to march against
@VP @POTUS Oh... can of worms! If this is the game you want to play... how about we talk about your bosses words and treatment of Americans in PR?
@seanspicer @ChrisMurphyCT @thehill Be careful... you don’t get to condemn anything from Dems with your president grabbing pussies
@GOP @realDonaldTrump No, not at all.
@SpeakerRyan If it passes... my guess is that it won’t.
@PressSec @POTUS Why isn’t this considered terrorism?
@SenCortezMasto Glad to see you playing politics
@SenCortezMasto Sure looks like this is playing politics. I am a dem and disgusted with you right now... I expect asshattery from Heller, not you.
@SenCortezMasto @JasonFrierson Wow... nice choice of words. And I disagree NOW (with pending legislation in silencers) is the time to do your job politically speaking.
@SenDeanHeller @POTUS https://t.co/Md5Dy2opcP you are complicit! Stop taking money from NRA an start working on legislation for stricter gun control
@SenDeanHeller @POTUS Prayers won’t stop another tragedy... https://t.co/FLvFp8uQ7e
@angela_rye Why does anyone need, um, more than one or two?
@realDonaldTrump so exactly when is the right time? https://t.co/sUe7BQ5ZMb
@GovMattBevin No, our current president is a clear example: read his tweets over the weekend concerning PR
@CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump @PressSec  you certainly jump to conclusions in every other situation, why shouldn’t we take your lead?
@billoreilly No... I am offended by you even trying to make this a controversy.
@realDonaldTrump How about some gun control instead of condolences... oh, wait, that would be DOING something instead of golfing.
@PressSec No, you are not... you are relishing the fact that you won’t be harassed with silly questions about NFL and PR.
@realDonaldTrump Okay, so nicknames it is. Cheetoh, you are going to fail. Simple. I predict China will win.
RT @washingtonpost: Mayor of San Juan, who has criticized the Trump administration, is now a voice for Puerto Rico's stranded https://t.co/…
@realDonaldTrump And you never complain... get over yourself. Your job is NOT about you. Your JOB is to to put ALL Americans needs above your own.
@tedcruz And for the record, you should probably do some soul searching about your priorities... cause I bet PR thinks they are a little distorted.
@tedcruz what happens with the first Qur’an verse shows up? Do you know what religious liberty looks like? Tell me how persecuted you are? All ears!
@realDonaldTrump tell me again how this helps the middle class. Seriously, quit! https://t.co/FWk7rdFKTk
Let that sink in.... but then 45 thinks firing people is an accomplishment! #WHapprentice     https://t.co/BSqZlBAKLO
@HouseDemocrats @SecPriceMD Concur, but let’s just start with @realDonaldTrump, how about those Chinese trademarks, and how about those golf outings!?
@SpeakerRyan Simple logic... our constitution should probably happen B4, let’s just get rid of the whole thing. You are a moron, try educating yourself
@realDonaldTrump if that is an “incredible job” I weep for our future... rather I will weep more. https://t.co/xhEm00VkaH
@chefjoseandres Thank you! PR deserves your culinary delights more than ever! ❤️ what you are doing! Bought a cookbook to say thanks!!!
@newtgingrich This is‘nt about dems and repubs, It SHOULD be about people paying proportional amounts. The rich need a tax cut like 45 needs a controversy
@betsarms I doubt there will even be a replacement...still waiting on Sec of DHS?!?!?
@KellyannePolls @POTUS Do you cry a lot alone in public bathrooms? You should.
@GOP As opposed to the senator you all just elected who was removed from office twice? Check your hypocrisy, it is not as quaint as you think!
@tedcruz @FLOTUS You really are quite unintelligent.....
@tedcruz So, should Americans just die instead? Makes sense...
@GOP Maybe we should take that $7.00 and donate to PR relief, since it seems no one else cares.
@marcorubio Shall we discuss separation of church and state? Or are you exercising your freedom of speech, it would be nice if that freedom was equal!
@realDonaldTrump Quit, and then you and your inbred clan should all move to Puerto Rico.
@realDonaldTrump So, that means N.O., Florida, Texas, Sandy victims, and any other location hit by natural disaster better pray they don’t ever get hit 2X
@SecretaryZinke @INDEPENDENCENHP How did you get there? And who paid for it?
@SecretaryZinke so, as I understand, you used tax payer money to pay yourself and cronies? Guess you earned a bonus! #disgrace #quit
@realDonaldTrump seems like the NFL is just as right now as they were then... bitter much? Your hatred of Obama and black people is vile! https://t.co/VJMWSIsdq7
@derek_mafs That is exactly what I do!!!
@PressSec @ricardorossello @POTUS How do you live with yourself? Is a job really worth selling out your soul? You own a piece of this debacle... a big piece.
@realDonaldTrump It is MY national anthem also, and I say let them kneel...
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you are not commissioner of the NFL, you are POTUS. Read the constitution.
@realDonaldTrump I am an American, veteran, and I don’t feel OUR flag or OUR country is disrespected by taking a need. YOU are the disgrace.
@realDonaldTrump Tell me, who exactly is the “our” you are referring to?
@BarackObama @JoeBiden And Vice President Biden is right... we DO miss the memes! But we miss competency more!
@BarackObama @JoeBiden Thank you both! You are missed and we need you....
@realDonaldTrump Are you proposing a regulation? Cause I thought you opposed regulations, and regulations were job killers?
@realDonaldTrump Because you plan to starve and kill his people... you fire people well, why not go and fire some more people? Start with Kushner.
@realDonaldTrump Seems lime a great legacy to strive for...
@newtgingrich Historically embarrassing!
@RWPUSA Can we have an "alternative president"?
Sure hope the party donors are happy about this... at least it is not tax payer dollars... oh wait! https://t.co/IX5wOpvJTB
@PressSec @BarackObama How many times did the Obama administration lambaste the Bush or other previous administrations. Stop!
@realDonaldTrump Wow! Great excuse for diplomacy! I imagine it was like this: https://t.co/tVzdRSqjPf
@realDonaldTrump You tell lies!
@seanspicer @DailyCaller Oh Spicey "IF" you didn't sell your soul to work @ WH, you'd be employable. Try coal, I hear they are hiring!

@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Señor, muchas gracias!
@SenKamalaHarris Thank you for all you do! Please never stop!
@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Senator McCain. I know this is not the best time for you personally, but, we need real leadership to end this, soon! Please?

@DrWesBellamy Thank you! I just watched you on CNN, and thank you! There really is not enough gratitude! You are my new hero!
@realDonaldTrump For dinner tonight I had hummus and tapenade on toast. It was so good! I have just enough for breakfast tomorrow, will add an emoji egg 🍳
@realDonaldTrump This is an experiment, bear with me.
@derek_mafs You should write a rap to it!

@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Thank you and please do not stop!
@realDonaldTrump Do you really think we trust you?
@AprilDRyan - thank you! You are so gracious, poised, and professional! I hope everyone follows your lead!
@smerconish the GOP health care plan sought to make rich people richer.
@RandyRainbow you need to put Amy Schumer in there as well
@prmolly any bets on ratings comparison tweets?
@SenGillibrand my 💡: dems need a front runner/leader that we can stand behind and to organize our efforts for 2018 and 2020. Be that person!
@realDonaldTrump have you seen this?	https://t.co/OOcQ61UUq4
@tedcruz it is really sad how you put party over country! Do your job, find the truth, stop pointing to the past, live in present!
@bidenfoundation can you start with DJT? And miss you! And how can I help!?
@BBCocoBear I started following you while watching BBOTT &amp; now you're emerging as one of my favorites re: our nations demise ❤️ your insight
@BarackObama @MichelleObama thank you! For demonstrating leadership, compassion, and love!
@realDonaldTrump when you discuss matters in the open, that usually happens! And what happened to transparency?
@LastWeekTonight @HBO this should be your last "vacation" we need you and have needed you!
@realDonaldTrump I would not throw stones from your glass house. No one lies more than you!
@SenDeanHeller as a new resident of NV, I am saddened that your loyalty is to a party and not the children of NV! #VoteanyonebutHeller2018
@SenWarren @SenateDems thank you for listening to your voters! It means more than I can express in a tweet!
@SenateMajLdr @JoeLieberman @SenatorSessions and Coretta Scott King had a few thoughts on the matter. Can a zebra change his stripes?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS perhaps you should have done your job and at least held hearings for Merrick Garland. Sucks, doesn't it!
@RandyRainbow you are the silver lining to this hellish cloud!!!! Thank you!!!!
@realDonaldTrump he says it so much better than me! https://t.co/jDzEVtUjQ8
@realDonaldTrump it will be a glorious day when you get off twitter
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes by my account NYT has told fewer lies in the history of the publication than you said since Jan 20!
@realDonaldTrump sure you do, and I am a mermaid!
@realDonaldTrump according to you, the only thing that is not fake news is your tweets.
@JoeBiden this is why you are so incredible! Thank you!!!! We need you!
@SenDeanHeller as a new resident, I am a new vote up for grabs! I am looking at character and bravery, do you have either?
@SenDeanHeller please do not vote for Betsy DeVos. There is too much at stake to vote party lines. This literally in the future! Please!
@SenWarren you are amazing! And although I don't live in Massachusetts you have my support and appreciation!
@realDonaldTrump this is a horrible and weak attempt to manipulate people and turn them against Australia. You can do better! Maybe not!
@JoeBiden agree! What can I do to help?
@bidenfoundation @JoeBiden and will you give us more memes? We all love you!!!!
@bidenfoundation I am here and ready to support you and Jill... thank you for this! We need all the hope we can get!
@realDonaldTrump you do know that this could be evidence in a trial of the bans legality.
@realDonaldTrump everyone thinks you are an imbecile and douche. Resign and take your white enclave with you!
@realDonaldTrump that certainly didn't take long. You know that no one likes you!
@realDonaldTrump you are creating a monarchy with no checks and balances, waiting for the statues that we have to salute and hunger games!
@realDonaldTrump I am unfollowing you, at first it was hilarious, then it gave way to scary, now you are just an ass! Way to ruin America!
@realDonaldTrump the precedent was set by your party. Is this a shining example of how you will unify us?
@SallyQYates wow!! You are so brave and courageous! Thank you!!!! Inspiring hardly sums up how I feel about you!
@realDonaldTrump what did you say about SCOTUS Justice replacement: delay delay delay! Sucks, doesn't it! And kudos to Sally!
@realDonaldTrump your campaign was nothing but instilling fear and hate!
@realDonaldTrump no, it is YOU determined to isolate us from the rest of the world
@POTUS now what did you sign????
@realDonaldTrump wake up! You are a patsy for the establishment. They are using you, and you will take the fall. https://t.co/GTvhJghp5A
@GovPenceIN @realDonaldTrump have you considered the fact that those experienced people around you are letting you look like an ass???
@POTUS you left off a few dozen things. That is okay, we are keeping a tally.
@realDonaldTrump you should spend some quality time reading @Trump_Regrets - gain some perspective on the citizens of our nation!
@realDonaldTrump the ban on muslims is disgusting! Read the constitution! Stop tweeting, and stop demanding attention!
@realDonaldTrump - no you are the one spewing lies! And starting to create a divide between us and the world! Pay attention to your job!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @washingtonpost - DJT I don't think you understand how journalism works! FAKE NEWS is what Breitbart puts out!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes - yay NYT! NOT FAKE NEWS! DJT you are a narcissist and trying to get Americans to not trust media! Stop!
@iamjohnoliver @YouTube can we do something to hasten this?
@iamjohnoliver America needs you more than ever. Seriously, you complete us!
@LastWeekTonight when do you come back to us???? We need you!
@realDonaldTrump are you @MikePenceVP's lap dog	https://t.co/qGjF9jKRII
@realDonaldTrump your bullying tactics won't work. Are you going to annex California?
@realDonaldTrump considering Mexico has NEVER been willing to pay for it curious what your move is here.
@realDonaldTrump thought this was apt (knowing you are a fan) https://t.co/8RUBwRGzfT
@realDonaldTrump you have done such a great job with including EVERYBODY so far or you mean every white male body? https://t.co/gUpPaTiTu3
@realDonaldTrump I will go ahead and bet that it will be a white man
@realDonaldTrump are you saying you don't have proof yet? Way to spread FAKE NEWS! There may be some smart people around you, listen to them
@realDonaldTrump sure you will! This honestly seems like the best idea you have had. You will still lose the popular vote.
@realDonaldTrump hope the killers read your tweets!
@realDonaldTrump it is a figurative wall and not a literal wall! I am sure the millions who thought you meant literal will be understanding!
@realDonaldTrump want to talk about the gag order at EPA and dept. of agriculture? Or would you rather your fact suppression go unnoticed?
@realDonaldTrump stop already! Every time you tweet about the inauguration or vote, I wonder what I am missing...
@realDonaldTrump have you seen this? It is tremendous! It is fantastic!	https://t.co/kvFEDmD0yV
@realDonaldTrump they did vote! Remember you lost the popular vote, you only won because of gerrymandering

@realDonaldTrump  seriously just a little reminder of the man you are: https://t.co/VZe1JdRIcY
@realDonaldTrump have you seen POTUS approval ratjngs👍🏽 and your ratings are in the sewer. Good luck!
@realDonaldTrump wait, isn't NBC home to Celebrity Apprentice? Are you discrediting the network that helped you rise to fame?
@realDonaldTrump so, Fox News is good all others are bad?
what if we (the citizens) always referred to you as "Totally inept @realDonaldTrump" every time you do something?
@realDonaldTrump I don't think you know what FAKE NEWS is. Google it, and while you are there Google "how to be president"
@realDonaldTrump todays tweet brought to you by GM and Walmart! Stop promoting businesses! You're about to be president of the US not QVC
@realDonaldTrump I appeared to have caught a cold, any tips or tricks to get better?
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews  how about this credible article instead?	https://t.co/r2Hoavwi0A
@realDonaldTrump gee, no conflict there? Isn't this your chief strategists' publication. You make it so hard to like you
@realDonaldTrump can you explain this? https://t.co/r2Hoavwi0A
@realDonaldTrump what say you? https://t.co/r2Hoavwi0A
@realDonaldTrump why? Because of your efforts to unite us? How about you start by not using twitter to communicate, then you stop be an ass!
@realDonaldTrump I hope you are planning your tweet to honor MLK on Monday. If you need help, just say the opposite of your instinct
@CoryBooker @repjohnlewis @BarackObama I just want to reach out and thank you for your civil service! Stay strong for all of us! Booker2020
@realDonaldTrump I am curious, why so much disdain and hate for POTUS? You literally have been against him 8 years. Why?
@realDonaldTrump I can find no verifiable information of this. We have less than a week to go before this shit gets real real!
@realDonaldTrump I still find it entertaining that you don't have as many followers as POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN no PEOTUS, you are the one in a total meltdown. As a citizen, I implore you to consider the ramifications of Twitter
@realDonaldTrump you had to know you would be subjected to a great deal of criticism and questioning- didn't you question POTUS for years?
@realDonaldTrump you are about to be the fucking President of the United States, you need to stop all of this.
@realDonaldTrump you tweeting about anything related to national security is "So serious!" You think the Russians don't read your tweets?
@realDonaldTrump so, the intel is all wrong and you are right? That is good, make the populous distrust media and government.
@realDonaldTrump you are joking, right?
@realDonaldTrump I hope you read this and know this sums up the popular vote that wanted someone else: https://t.co/HTpJBIqD0z
@realDonaldTrump I very, very, very , very much want you to stop tweeting!????
@realDonaldTrump I am very, very, very , very surprised that you don't edit yourself, let alone use twitter for rambling repetitive messages
@realDonaldTrump if you have to continue- twitter is not the right platform- put your phone down
@realDonaldTrump - I have zero respect for you! Zero!!!!!!! I respect the office, but you bring new meaning to vile!
@realDonaldTrump - this TRUMPS all tweets! Seriously WTF is wrong with you. You just won, and you have to be ugly?
@realDonaldTrump actually why not ban the media, jail all who speak out against you, and maybe erect a.bunch of statues for us to worship
@realDonaldTrump -why not wait for official findings before fueling fears!?!?
@realDonaldTrump please stop with the parenthetical digs.... grow up!!!! Now that is official can we stop with the BS?
@realDonaldTrump and you know you can never be on the apprentice again, unless you quit PEOTUS right NOW!
@realDonaldTrump I am, like, smart. Can I be president of your company if I get enough people to endorse this? No need for training, smart!
@realDonaldTrump you know you are President Elect of the United States, right?
@realDonaldTrump &amp; I think some of the names your supporters are using in spite of the victory should also be addressed (read: racial slurs)
@realDonaldTrump mature attitude- when the go low we go even lower? Or is it more of a "I know you are but what am I?" Sort of retort?
@realDonaldTrump I guess SNL finally nailed it! No comments about how not funny and sad it is!
@realDonaldTrump - I am curious about how many non-white Americans attend these rallies? Keep on keeping us divided!
@realDonaldTrump ??? An early Christmas present? I am sure the have reverse engineered it already.
@realDonaldTrump - I am going right to the source instead of believing the news- is this true??  https://t.co/784nQwz7kR
@realDonaldTrump I don't think it is official yet... don't count your 🐔 just yet! 😃
@realDonaldTrump yes... don't you think there was a reason to not have Bernie win?
@realDonaldTrump you just don't get it!!
@realDonaldTrump it is not that hard... really you do it all on your own!
@realDonaldTrump @VanityFair - this sort of rhetoric has to stop!!!! If you are going to unite our nation start by not creating discord!!
@realDonaldTrump - you do know they also named Hitler and Stalin? I am not so sure you read the article that went with the title!
@realDonaldTrump - AAUUUAGAHHAGHUA THIS IS NOT A TV SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump - who is paying for this?
@realDonaldTrump who is paying for the thank you tour?
@realDonaldTrump do your powers of manipulation only work on uneducated and gullible? Maybe that is chapter 1 of art of the deal?
@realDonaldTrump - you are perpetuating the divide instead of uniting us. You are creating distrust and discord. Fix it!
@realDonaldTrump- I don't know what is worse, if you are aware of the impact of your tweets, or if you are blindly stupid to it?
@realDonaldTrump I didn't vote for you, I think you are laughable, but the job is yours, so do it! Stop the nonsense, the rhetoric!!!
@realDonaldTrump good job! Way to continue to weaken our country! How about you forego the thank you your costing millions? And do your job!
@realDonaldTrump not true. Educate yourself
@realDonaldTrump and for the record, there is no "card" there is evidence, do your job, attend a briefing, and LEARN!
@realDonaldTrump - so you are saying there is a "we" and "them" is this acknowledgment of the divide YOU created? A lesson in pronouns?
@realDonaldTrump you do know that 50+ million people trust you and what you are spewing. It is a huge burden and you must understand!
@realDonaldTrump and instead of creating distrust, maybe you should be focused on YOUR responsibilities and not what other people say
@realDonaldTrump can you please read the constitution and maybe have a long talk with a Supreme Court justice?
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNightlyNews @CNN  - I am not sure you understand how this works. You don't even seem to know how to identify a fact!
@realDonaldTrump this is great news! What happens if EVERYONE removes themselves of consideration? Or is that planned already? Ivanka?
@realDonaldTrump good for you!!! As a Navy vet I am looking forward to a favorable outcome (again)
@realDonaldTrump it is so hard to keep up with DJT Twitter rules! Maybe send ten to twelve in a row about how to interpret!
@realDonaldTrump I thought all of the news was corrupt and dishonest? So, news you like is good and news you don't is fake! Got it!
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls is the one that said it, is she telling blatant lies?
@realDonaldTrump any thoughts or quippy tweets about this? https://t.co/ofWwhJQHXe
@realDonaldTrump lovely Fayetteville! Shouldn't you be attending intel briefs and working? Time for tours after your term!
@realDonaldTrump - um, do you not realize the jobs this will create?
@realDonaldTrump - this seems like a very good use for twitter! On that note, any diet dog food recommendations? My vet said my dog was fat!
@NBCNews @realDonaldTrump this is what you are... this is what you are doing... find a new outlet! Leave twitter to the trolls and celebs
@realDonaldTrump maybe you should find a network that will give you 10-15 minutes of air time!
@realDonaldTrump if you don't want to be trolled, then you should figure out a better medium to be heard?
@realDonaldTrump but you seem to take people mocking you personally, maybe you should not have opted to run for such a public office!
@realDonaldTrump and you really need to accept the fact as PEOTUS you will never please everyone, outlets like SNL are not personal!
@realDonaldTrump - the problem is not the press, and if your tweets were not so personal and provocative, no worries- but egging on China?
@realDonaldTrump so please please please please stop tweeting! Seriously! Stop!!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump you scare me
@realDonaldTrump WHAT ARE YOU DOING???????????? STOP TWEETING NOW!
@realDonaldTrump well I guess he is suddenly qualified! Fastest education and training I have ever seen!
@realDonaldTrump pretty please stop tweeting
@realDonaldTrump please stop tweeting
@realDonaldTrump stop tweeting
@realDonaldTrump so we can't trust CNN but we can trust TMZ? Your logic seems a little flawed! Please stop tweeting!
@realDonaldTrump - there are some that say you are just scamming to raise money. Please stop tweeting!
@realDonaldTrump I wish you would learn to laugh at yourself.
@realDonaldTrump that is exciting!!! Have you heard the song call me maybe?
@realDonaldTrump ooooh a game! Leaving my duties as president!
@mvfr1248 Do I need to panic????
@realDonaldTrump so where do you recommend I get my news?

@realDonaldTrump don't you fall! Beautiful colors, PSLs, and sweaters!
@realDonaldTrump - who do you suppose thought to boil the first artichoke?
@realDonaldTrump- this is interesting- do you even know who you are retweeting and quoting?
@realDonaldTrump you certainly are making this hard! I don't think you want to draw attention to the votes unless you want a recount!
@realDonaldTrump my friends and I were wondering if all of those illegal votes would. It be a really good reason for a recount? We think yes
@realDonaldTrump - that is exciting! Glad to see you could still take time to tweet about it!
@realDonaldTrump - what is your favorite color? Mine is a tie between pink and yellow! Cheerful and bright! Like me! Maybe yours is orange?
@realDonaldTrump I think you need a copy editor for your tweets, this is not very well written!
@realDonaldTrump - binge watching Search Party. It is pretty good so far.
@realDonaldTrump 😳 all of the Kardashians rank above you. And so does Obama. 😭 https://t.co/9BkgGTE67C
@realDonaldTrump what is really going on??? I mean every weekend you take@to@twitter like a drug addict needing a fix!
@realDonaldTrump - you are president, no states should be forgotten....
@realDonaldTrump is this a fill in the blank??? 3 or 4 ice cream shoppes! Oh no, that is where Joe Biden would be.
@realDonaldTrump if you can't laugh at yourself you can't laugh at anyone else! This made me audibly giggle! https://t.co/fXcDreKWNM
@realDonaldTrump - have you considered using Snapchat? That is really the new and better means of communicating! And the filters!!!
@realDonaldTrump - my least favorite chore is laundry, it never ends!
@realDonaldTrump I don't think anything is as appalling as mocking a person with a disability, but you do you!
@realDonaldTrump TBH some of the things you did say were pretty awful. Maybe you should say nice things now and try to redeem yourself!
@realDonaldTrump - maybe HRC wants to demonstrate that tenacity you once heralded?
@realDonaldTrump maybe you should consider a differ forum, 144 characters doesn't seem to be enough to voice your opinions.
@realDonaldTrump i just a delicious dinner of roasted broccoli and poached eggs. How is your evening?
@realDonaldTrump did you hit up the Black Friday sales? Great way to stimulate the economy and connect with populous!
@realDonaldTrump happy thanksgiving! Did you brine your turkey?
@realDonaldTrump Good Morning! 😃 😞😫😤😚😎😩😒 what are your thoughts about emoji? I ❤️ them so much!
@realDonaldTrump just curious Donald, do you read the replies?
@realDonaldTrump good luck with your meetings. Hope it is a safe place for all!
@realDonaldTrump - hi again, hoping you can give me some advice on how to pick a good Christmas tree!
@realDonaldTrump - I am not so worried about what you did before (although it is a little worrisome) but mostly concerned with after!
@realDonaldTrump- Good morning President Elect, was wondering if you had any thanksgiving recipes you want to share?
