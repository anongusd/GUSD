@seriouslyroli @RealJack @toby_dorena Let's agree that the Democrats should have made a counter offer that addressed your concerns. What would you want me to tell my Democrat Reps to do for DACA? My concern is the Open Borders only benefit the rich elites on Wall Street. Dems are with them now, not with the workers.
@seriouslyroli @RealJack @toby_dorena I am not here to fight with you. I pray that our Representatives do their jobs so that the problem is solved and DACA kids are able to stay and achieve the American Dream.
@seriouslyroli @RealJack @toby_dorena There is no current DACA program. That is a real crisis. It expired on President Obama's schedule. Why? Congress must fix it. President Trump offered a plan. Dems didn't offer a counter plan, they REJECTED the only plan that included DACA. We must seek truth &amp; unite on solutions.
@seriouslyroli @RealJack @toby_dorena Congress must fix it. Let's both agree to hold them all accountable to fix it. President Trump is trying to build a good path for us all. Choose Greatness. We need RESULTS from our Representatives, not RESIST. Choose world peace &amp; prosperity for all.
@seriouslyroli @RealJack @toby_dorena President Trump &amp; GOP leaders offered a path to citizenship for DACA kids as part of the border security funding deal.

@TedHallerMN @cullen_art @washingtonpost I actually really like Tom Lyden. I was a big fan until last night. I still hope he will take the feedback &amp; do better next time. How about telling the story of the recent immigrant who lost his first home because he couldn‚Äôt afford the mortgage when ACA doubled his HC ins costs?
@TedHallerMN @cullen_art @washingtonpost Do you care about all of the journalists here in the USA who have been deplatformed and silenced by MSM &amp; Social Media? Do the ends really justify the means? Are you oh-so okay with tipping the scales of justice against conservative journalists? Does it make you feel powerful?
@TedHallerMN @cullen_art @washingtonpost Art and Tom had a beautiful and important story to tell about wonderful immigrants who are successfully achieving the American Dream. Inspire viewers to ask themselves ‚ÄúHow can I help?‚Äù Instead, the story was poisoned with ‚ÄúHate Trump‚Äù rhetoric. Calling neighbors racists. Why?
@cullen_art @FOX9 @SteveKing Tom also falsely accused President Trump of saying that "journalists are the enemy of the people". He NEVER said that. Trump said #FakeNews is the enemy of the people - huge difference. Your integrity, your most valuable possession, is lost when you spin news. Don't be #FakeNews.
@cullen_art @FOX9 @SteveKing Tom Lyden was terribly dishonest in this report. It is very harmful &amp; hurtful to immigrants when Democrats &amp; far left MSM imply that President Trump &amp; "white people" are anti-immigrant. Nobody is anti-immigration. Americans, including legal immigrants are pro-LEGAL immigration.
