Giuliani also said that talks with Special Counsel Robert Mueller have come to a standstill because of request to turn over memo on mandate to fed judge:"They are basically tied up trying to answer Judge Ellis for the last week who has said do you or don't you have the authority"
Giuliani also said there's no way that Trump could sit down with Mueller before NoKo summit: "I don't see how in any way he could sit down with Mueller. We couldn't prepare him for it. he wouldn't have the time to do it."
Giuliani told me that the President didn't ask the Justice Departmen to block the AT&amp;T Time Warner merger, but "had every right and power to do." Adding, "other Presidents have done it in anti-trust cases."
