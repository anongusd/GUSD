Interesting night! Real news effecting most everyone in MN. and going right down to the wire. 12 minutes to air time
It sounds like the GOP has written a budget bill and now asking for a special session. What will Dayton say? Hopefully some clarity at 10 pm
@ryanspublicfeed Indeed, I think most people can see both sides of the budget battle but adding 34K to the ranks of the unemployed is brutal
@ryanspublicfeed It may be a case of how much risk to you want to take. Hopefully, we don't get to that point and its not an issue. 2 days
@ryanspublicfeed  Yes, the law won't change but there is thought that new priorities in shutdown mode means MnPass lane won't get attention.
@AliShops  Everything good comes from 'the Amelia collection'

@periwinkle_mimi  A beautiful and uplifting celebration of his life. Pastor Youngdahl was such a special man. I learned from him.
