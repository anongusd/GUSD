@NewEngJP @ChrisjHowerton @ijbailey @Iron_Jingleen @quelinda1983 Most other infants are wanted by their mothers. So there’s no need for special protections. This is about infants born to mothers who tried to abort them and failed. Should they be allowed to achieve the same result by denying their infant needed medical care?
One reason is that local media treated the case as a crime story magnified by Smollett’s celebrity. National media treated it as a story about Trump and his supporters.  https://t.co/WWn6gAF5gG
@ijbailey @NewEngJP @Iron_Jingleen @quelinda1983 Your arguments here reflect your refusal to recognize the moral implications of permitting abortions up to and past the moment of viability — even to the point of allowing infants born alive to die for lack of medical care. That’s not exactly infanticide but it’s close.
@ijbailey @NewEngJP @Iron_Jingleen @quelinda1983 Then what, exactly, was Ralph Northam talking about?
@NewEngJP @Iron_Jingleen @ijbailey @quelinda1983 But not the right to health care, which Democrats claim should be a universal right.
@ijbailey @NewEngJP @quelinda1983 It’s not about what kind of care. It’s about whether a living infant should be left to die for lack of care.
@NewEngJP @quelinda1983 @ijbailey Of course it’s not about abortion. It’s about prohibiting doctors from allowing an infant born alive despite an abortion attempt to die for lack of medical care.
@ijbailey There is no law requiring that infants who survive an abortion who need medical care to survive receive that care. And you accuse me of lying. Please.
@NewEngJP @quelinda1983 @ijbailey It does not exist in current law, which makes it illegal to kill a living infant. It does not make it illegal to deny such an infant the medical care needed to keep it from dying.
This story is based largely on anecdotal information, but it’s troubling because it indicate North Korea’s economy is not being much harmed by US-led sanctions. If that’s true, then what does Kim have to gain from denuclearization?   https://t.co/9WJ00D8usl
@ijbailey Sir, you do not understand the bill. It is not about infanticide, as such. It is about the denial of health care to a baby who is born alive despite an abortion attempt and who needs health care to survive. You accuse me of lying. Show where I have lied.
Senate Democrats’ vote against the born-alive protection bill means that they now believe health care is a right for all, except infants who survive an abortion, the most vulnerable creatures imaginable.

Not exactly. Sometimes an infant is born alive despite the attempt to abort him/her. Such babies often need medical attention to survive. NARAL would prefer the mother and the abortionist to have the option of letting the infant die. The Sasse bill would require the baby get care https://t.co/lXWhHod32E

If Gov. Northam does step down, it’s not clear that either Lt. Gov. Fairfax, who’s next in line, or AG Herring, could succeed him because or their own problems. Next in line would be House Speaker Kirk Cox, who’s GOP. So Dem calls for Northam to quit seem likely to subside.

@CSBence @dleos91745 There was not an ounce of corroboration for the Blasey-Ford allegations. She couldn’t say exactly where it happened or exactly when or how she got there or got home. The Fairfax accuser knows exactly where and when and he admits it happened, but claims it was consensual.
@dleos91745 There wasn’t for Kavanaugh either, was there? But the Bookers of the world said women who make such accusations should be believed. Much different response when it’s a Democrat being accused.

It will be interesting to see how Northam’s denial of the yearbook blackface photo plays out, since it was coupled with an acknowledgement that he was in blackface in a separate instance that same year.
Northam, having admitted yesterday that he was in the racist yearbook photo, is now denying he was in the picture. He admits a different blackface incident in a Michael Jackson skit. He asks forgiveness and says he’ll work to earn it. “We will continue to lead,” he says.

@MaxBoot Where did I say anything in this exchange about a wall? I simply called you out on your false claim that certain right wing talking head invented the “crisis.” I pointed you to a story in the Post that called it just that, and you’ve been trying to change the subject ever since.
@MaxBoot Sorry Max. Non-responsive.
@DelWilber @MaxBoot I think it was a Federalist piece about the fact-checking done by the Post and other outlets after Trump’s speech in which they took him to task for use of the word “crisis.” Striking, in light of the Post’s own earlier reporting, which was quite an exception.

@JathonWSJ @RPBradley1 Even if that were true, the liberal press more than makes up for it.
@RPBradley1 Right. It’s kind of blindingly obvious that he has character issues. So did Bill Clinton, the difference being that Clinton was a much more polished liar, and much more talented politician.
I disagree with Jill Abramson on many things, but not on this.  https://t.co/Shz3G61c3E
@JerylBier @ReaganBattalion The context here is Romney’s recent Senate campaign in which he had received trump’s endorsement and happily accepted it.
@gtconway3d Maybe so. But remember what Romney said about Trump in the early going in ‘16. Strikingly similar to what he’s saying now.
@RPBradley1 Not sure how “profound” those criticisms have been. As for character, what does it say about Romney that he sought and got Trump’s endorsement in 2012, trashed him in early stages of 2016, then fell silent on Trump’s character after the election, and now is back to trashing him.
@RPBradley1 I very much admire those that have taken jobs and done their best. I don’t think all the good ones are gone but those that have left have largely refrained from issuing broadsides against Trump’s character and fitness to serve. Good for them. Nikki Haley is a good example.
@ReaganBattalion Thanks! And happy new year.
@ReaganBattalion You don’t need power or a mandate to say what you truly think. You may need courage however.
@ReaganBattalion Those were disagreements with Trump on individual matters, not attacks on Trump’s character and fitness to hold the office. I think Romney has doubted that about Trump all along. He just muted it when it was useful to do so.
@dlb100b I think it is too. But I don’t think Romney has just lately come to that view of Trump. I think he’s kept it to himself when it was useful to him to do so, expressed it when that seemed useful.
@ReaganBattalion @MittRomney Well why didn’t he repudiate it and let the voters in on his view of Trump. I know why and so do you. It’s the same reason he was happy to be considered as Trump’s Secretary of State.

@coopeydoop What, that Trump is a man of poor character? That’s been obvious since he first ran. I have thought so all along, but Romney seems to think that only part of the time.
@dlb100b If he didn’t need the support, he certainly managed to appear grateful to have it. And then there was that famous dinner and his willingness to be considered for Trump’s cabinet. I think Trump is a man of poor character too, but Romney seems to think that only part of the time.
@bobbyhemi @RPBradley1 Trump was president when he supported Romney’s Senate campaign. Did you not know that?
@RPBradley1 You would think so, but where was Romney’s distaste when he happily accepted Trump’s support for his Senate campaign, and when he earlier was being considered for Trump’s cabinet. He didn’t seem to be filled with distaste at that dinner, did he?

@WaydeDay @guypbenson But he also belittles the charity of the poor as not “of any volume,” as if the dollar amounts matter more than the moral code that motivates people to give. Where does he think that comes from? Where do you?

@Stephen_Agnew @guypbenson Of course he is, and that’s the problem. He thinks our wealth is the reason behind our generosity in the world. But that’s only part of it. It would mean little were it not for the values that motivate us to be generous. And where do that values come from? You figure it out.
@JW_Duvall @guypbenson What nonsense. Where do you think the values and principles that our country was built on come from? You can find considerable fault with many churches and many church people. But that’s not the same thing as the beliefs themselves.

@modmikey @MichaelDKarras Do they not want the government funded?
@rolandsmartin @VP @realDonaldTrump Yes that did happen and it was bad faith Trump’s part. But we are where we are his previous bad faith does not change the fact of the Dems’ bad faith now.
@jjrrugg The previous offer was just days ago. What’s changed since then?
@attorneygsb @BradMossEsq @BDOH The way deals work is that both sides get some of what they want. How is his giving up on the wall a deal?
@RonWechsler @attorneygsb @BradMossEsq @BDOH Of course it’s not an auction. It is a negotiation. The way they work is that each side gives a little, and keeps doing that until they can agree. So Trump is sweetening his position and Dems are doing the opposite.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Because moving the goal posts when he’s sweetening his offer is not a way to get the government open. It may, however, be a way to keep the government closed believing that a: he’ll get the blame and b: end up with nothing. Might work, but it’s not good-faith negotiating.
Trump has made many blunders re: wall, incl. his claim that Mexico would pay, his rejection of the Dems offer of DACA fix for wall $$ &amp; his saying he’d take blame for shutdown. Now, though, he’s cut his funding demand in half &amp; Dems countered with less than their previous offer.
@rolandsmartin @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What on earth does that offer, which Trump should have accepted, have to do with the current negotiations, in which Trump is proposing 10% of that dollar number and Democrats have responded by offering less than they did only days ago?
@Tarver8595 @spencer_josh @BradMossEsq @BDOH Nothing.
@steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump I have said nothing about the merits of a wall. I’m talking here about which side is negotiating in good faith over funding it, in a deal to get the government open.  Both sides have agreed to some taxpayer wall funding. Trump has lowered his demand. Dems have raised theirs.
@saletan Saying Mexico will pay for it is not a demand for wall funding by Congress. And he’s certainly abandoned that. But we are where we are and Dems are pretending to negotiate in good faith to get the gov’t open. Trump has cut his demand in half. Dems respond by reducing their offer.
@steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump Give it up. The Trump offer is not “preposterous.” You may not like the idea of a wall but both sides have accepted the idea of funding it. This is a negotiation over the price. Dems were ok with $1.6 billion just days ago, now they’re down to less than that. That’s not serious.
@steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump So Trump asking for 10% of what the Dems were willing to give him in exchange for policy changes is “preposterous” without those changes. Please.
@attorneygsb @BradMossEsq @BDOH Really, he’s cut his funding demand in half. That’s substantial.
@steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump That’s an argument against the idea of a wall. But we are talking here about two parties both of whom have previously accepted funding one, so it’s silly to claim that Trump’s reduced funding request is “preposterous.”
@steve_vladeck How is $5 billion, let alone$2.5 billion, a “preposterous demand” when Democrats not so long ago were willing to go as high as $25 billion?
@spencer_josh @BradMossEsq @BDOH Because both sides are needed to end the shutdown.
@BradMossEsq @BDOH All that may be true, but what the Dems are doing is not a serious effort to end the partial shutdown.

@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer True. It will be interesting to see if Trump can convince the public that the reason the shutdown drags on is that Dems won’t agree even to the relative pittance he’s seeking. The only time I’ve ever seen the Dems lose a shutdown was when Schumer clearly triggered it.
They’re not just trying to get the better end of a deal. They are going for an outright win, in which Trump is utterly humiliated. He helped them by announcing his ownership of the shutdown. The tape of that lives on, despite his now trying to blame them. https://t.co/dJeiAhsub6

@BuckSexton Buck, surely you don’t mean to argue that we should only send troops to places where there is no danger they’d have to fight.
@austinruse I knew someone would say what you just did. To keep the peace is why the troops are there. There was the threat of war in Europe for decades and there remains that threat on the Korean peninsula. Surely you don’t mean there should only be troops where there’s no threat.
Stationing American troops in foreign lands is not a policy of “endless war,” as our experience for decades in Europe and South Korea attest. It is often a way to support and protect allies and deter enemies. It can be costly and risky but it’s sloppy to call it “endless war.”

@the_real_Lord @mgorenflo Then why was Flynn only charged with a crime that took place after their investigation started.
@mgorenflo So they weren’t gunning for criminals after all, since it was not then a criminal investigation.
@acco1st Thank you sir.
@joshscampbell That statement by the judge is false, and he later acknowledge that an apologized. Did you miss that?
@mgorenflo Ridiculous tweet. The crime that he pleaded to did not occur until they were pursuing him. So they pursue potential criminals?

@PattyArquette @LSUHeatFins_Fan Please show me where he was charged with treason, since you say he was “busted” as a “traitor.”
@ccollinsjr @PattyArquette Show me where Flynn was charged with treason. He was charged with lying to the FBI, and was clearly guilty of that.
@PattyArquette @LSUHeatFins_Fan He was national security adviser. He was not a spy.
@PattyArquette @LSUHeatFins_Fan That article in no way supports your reckless claim. Did you even read it?
@PattyArquette @LSUHeatFins_Fan And you know that how? First of all, he wasn’t a US agent at all. His intelligence career had ended. Are you in the habit of making such reckless claims?

@JackLamb1957 Thank you sir.
@tommyxtopher Thanks for at least conceding the legitimacy of the underlying issue. The rest of your tweet is just opinion.
@tommyxtopher “Privileged...racist intent....the made it an issue because Horton was black... “ You can argue those things, but that doesn’t establish they are true. And you keep ducking the question of whether the prison furlough program was a legit issue.
@tommyxtopher Those are all mere opinions. You’re certainly entitled to them, but they don’t even begin to establish the validity of your argument.
@tommyxtopher I don’t concede that it was either. Neither the prison furlough ad nor the Bush comment noted his race. So it comes down to this: was Dukakis legitimately critcized for a prison furlough program that permitted a convict to slip away and commit a hideous crime?
@tommyxtopher Why was it racist? You could argue that it was racial, but that’s not the same thing.
@tommyxtopher What generated the criticism of the ad was the picture of Horton, which revealed his race. Neither Bush’s debate comment nor the prison furlough ad noted his race. What’s more, the Dukakis prison furlough program was an utterly legitimate campaign isssue.

@RadioFreeTom @BenHowe Once again, you ignore his record on the bench. Anything in those 300 plus opinions suggesting he harbors and acts on partisan sentiments? Anything at all?
@RadioFreeTom His record on the court is not as a “perfectly adequate” judge but as a distinguished judge whose reasoning has several times been adopted by the Supreme Court. And the reason we hold hearings is to explore that record, not to gauge temperament in face of unsubstantiated slurs.
@RadioFreeTom And your comment about “longevity” is empty sleight of hand. Longevity is hardly the issue. What matters is the record compiled during his time as an actual judge, something about which you seemingly have nothing to say.
@RadioFreeTom And what, exactly, do you know about any Kavanaugh role in the Whelan fiasco?
@RadioFreeTom Your focus on Kavanaugh’s reaction to the charges as proof of a lack of judicial temperament is weak. It ignores his record in 12 years on the bench, which should hold far more weight than his angry response to utterly uncorroborated alllegations.
@RadioFreeTom Your tweet rebuts nothing in the article, and utterly glosses over the points made in Collins’ speech. Weak and sloppy.

@AshaRangappa_ @ByronYork You were talking about an adversarial hearing, as if that was what I was talking about. I was not. Are you saying there is never a reason for a FISA judge to hold hearing to ask questions of the government?

@renato_mariotti @ByronYork Where exactly did you find the word “shock,” which you put in quotes in either Byron’s tweets or mine? What makes the handling of this FISA warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen &amp; presidential campaign aide remarkable is that it was treated as routine.

@awzurcher @instapundit “Nothing important?” To a number of those present the Magnitsky Act was very important indeed. A subject does not need to be about the guilt of Trump &amp; Co. to be important. Some in our trade are having trouble seeing this.
@awzurcher @instapundit Well, they were actually there. And so were numerous others interviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, who say essentially the same thing. Are their accounts not entitled to more credence than they speculations of those who were not present?
As the saying goes, there is none so blind as they who will not see.  https://t.co/JXgzXHtHc7
@QuinHillyer Quin, I suggest you read the interviews with numerous participants in the meeting by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The transcripts are online. I think they hold more weight than the speculations of those not present.
@JohnJHarwood Oh, I don’t know John. Perhaps because their testimony remains basically uncontradicted by anyone who was there. I’d tend to give it more weight than speculation from those not present.
It was a criminal conspiracy of which he was a major architect and participant. He did time for obstruction of justice &amp; was disbarred.He testified to save his ass. Was also a major planner of the coverup of  the ITT scandal, a story I broke. That coverup unraveled post-Watergate https://t.co/xAaSgJf56I
This is ridiculous. https://t.co/Qvu2IfcJBr
@FdelaRiva89 @JonathanLanday Have you read the transcripts of the Senate Judiciary Committee interviews with several of the participants in that meeting? The all say essentially the same thing and are the best evidence available of what happened. They’re available online.
@bmchanen @renato_mariotti It’s not just Don jr. It’s the word of numerous other participants in the meeting who were interviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The transcripts are online. I suggest you read them.
He was a very effective witness, but he was also convicted of obstruction of justice and did time in jail. He was disbarred. In addition to helping to mastermind the Watergate coverup, he was also an architect of the ITT scandal coverup, which preceded Watergate, uraveled later. https://t.co/hAg9GNPWvb
@renato_mariotti You are very far afield from my original point, which was that Trump team’s acknowledgement that Don Jr was after dirt on Hillary does not contradict their statement that the meeting ended up being about something else.
@JonathanLanday Another example of exactly what I was talking about. Trump Jr was hoping to get dirt on Hillary. Numerous accounts of the meeting say essentially the same thing: Instead, he got lobbied about the Magnitsky Act and the resulting ban on Russian adoptions.
@JohnJHarwood John, please read the transcripts of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s interviews of several of the participants in the meeting. They are the best evidence we have of what happened at the meeting. They are available online.
@renato_mariotti As a factual matter going to a meeting for one purpose is not the same as the meeting actually being for that purpose. Don Jr. was conned.
@BradMossEsq That in no way refutes my point. Attending a meeting for one purpose is not the same as the meeting turning out to be for that purpose.
And by this standard, no apparent way to get one. https://t.co/NaQt2ASj7R

@EricColumbus @Jamie_Weinstein I can’t account for that. I’m just skeptical that it was to cover up collaboration with the Putin government in the 2016 campaign. What’s your theory as to why some journalists are trying to pass off Trump’s saying it was to get dirt as news?
@Jamie_Weinstein Jamie, this has been obvious for over a year. Don Jr., no genius, took the meeting thinking he’d get dirt on Hillary. He didn’t. He got lobbied on the Magnitisky Act, to which Putin had retaliated by halting U.S. adoptions of Russian children.

The reason most billionaires, civic-minded or not, are still billionaires is that they don’t invest in dying businesses  and then spend more money to make them run the way they once did, thereby losing more money. Bezos may be seen as an exception, but WaPo is profitable. https://t.co/YDry6VwijP

Trump, finally asked whom he believes on Russia interference, gives a vague and rambling non-answer, with renewed complaints about Hillary’s server. Says he trusts US intel but made clear he takes Putin’s denials seriously. Lame response, to say the least.
@AmbHeffern @wish @FoxNews @POTUS Dear Sir, Fox News is a big place with a lot of voices. Your tweet suggests you don’t watch the channel or you would know that many views and many sides are heard from daily.
Putin would be smart to knock off the election interference right now. It had negligible effect on the outcome in ‘16 and would therefore cost Putin little. It would be a cheap concession. Of course Putin denies any interference but US intel would quickly know if it stopped.
In his post-meeting prepared statement, Trump says he discussed election interference at length with Putin, but says only that Putin has strong views about it and that Putin offered what Trump called an interesting idea about it. So far, no Trump view of Putin denials.
Putin continued to deny interfering in US election. It will be interesting to what Trump will say when he’s asked if he buys that.

It is one thing for Strzok, or any investigator, to have political preferences or even to strongly dislike a particular candidate. But the deep animus to Trump expressed in Strzok’s texts to Page go far beyond that and make it impossible to believe he acted without bias.

@QuinHillyer David Frum, George Will, Mike Gerson, Max Boot and Jen Rubin to name several. Will rooted for a Hillary landslide and Rubin wrote a column suggesting how she could beat Trump. Bret Stephens said he didn’t like either, but she was “survivable,” unlike Trump. There were others.
“Surrendering the executive branch” is an interesting way for this chap to describe an election in which he was a candidate, of sorts. https://t.co/Do0hzwr0WX

And even if there were it’s nothing but a statistic, like hits in a baseball game or yards gained in a football game. It is not how the  contest is scored. https://t.co/Ocy5VwewY1
@redsteeze Point taken, but McConnell’s hardball would have come to naught if HRC had won.
@Timodc That misses the point. We’re talking here about conservatives so mesmerized by Trump’s words that they preferred Hillary. Lots can happen obviously but that view not looking wise at the moment.
@PJHubbell @12ichard12 @RedMissGuy And which branch of government has been sticking up for first amendment rights these days? Why the Supreme Court, with Gorsuch voting in the majority.
@TexasEyelidDoc @DavidAFrench @krauthammer Krauthammer a poor example. Once DJT was nominated, he was fair to him and made clear he wanted him to succeed.
@DavidAFrench But many did support her, including George Will, Michael Gerson, David Frum and Max Boot, with Will rooting for a Hillary landslide. Bret Stephens said he wasn’t supporting either, but said Hillary would be “survivable,” which he couldn’t say about Trump. Just a few examples.
@RedMissGuy That’s an odd reason to support Hillary, which a number of “conservative” opinion leaders did.
@gabrielmalor But in the end, it came down to Donald vs. Hillary and a significant corps of conservative opinion leaders openly supported her. David Frum, Max Boot, Michael Gerson, George Will, even Bret Stephens all preferred her to him. Will rooted for a Hillary landslide.
@ishapiro Do the names George Will, Max Boot, David Frum and Michael Gerson, to same just some, ring any bells? They all favored HRC and Will openly rooted for a Hillary landslide.

The Gorsuch appointment, the string of 5-4 SCOTUS decisions with him in the majority, and the Kennedy vacancy has left the never-Trump right standing on a shrinking sliver of ground. After all, they thought HRC would have been preferable.

@jmartNYT @JamesPindell And by the time Garland was nominated, there were 9 months left in Barack Obama’s 96-month presidency.
@yesnicksearcy More accurate would have been: “Democrats interrupt Jordan as he interrupts Rosenstein.”
@ThePlumLineGS That’s an almost comically tendentious response. But in a way it makes my point. Rosenstein’s troubles illustrate no split in the Republican party, which was my point.

I have misgivings about Trump''s so-called "travel ban" as policy, but the Supreme Court was absolutely correct in its ruling. Presidential authority here is clearly established in law and precedent. It is depressing that numerous judges and 4 justices refused to see that.

@Jamie_Weinstein Jamie, it is only about people who came across the border illegally with children, which under catch-and-released meant they had a get-out-of-jail free card. That, in turn, meant they could melt away into the country and never be heard from again.
@Jamie_Weinstein The Flores settlement lies at the heart of this whole case and may well mean the Trump EO will not stand.
@LegendaryPask @Keller_A_Teal A misdemeanor IS a crime.
@Keller_A_Teal They have if they don't cross at a legal port of entry.
People who cross the border illegally whether  for asylum or any other purpose require no criminalization. They’ve already committed a crime. Trump’s order today does nothing to change that. Trump is simply refusing to go back to the old practice of catch and release. https://t.co/t7LFyVppXg

@Whey_standard @RobTornoe Quoting an official statement is not the same as checking its veracity. This can’t be this hard.
@rmccarthy201 @washingtonpost My point was that the White House claimed they left before the actual meeting started. Key point. Did they leave or did they stay fo the classified briefing? Quoting the WH claim is not enough. Easy to check its veracity. They should have.
@BradMossEsq I disagree. The use of the word “insisted” connotes that there is doubt about it. The whole basis of the story is that their presence in this classified briefing “roiled” lawmakers. If they weren’t actually there, the story largely collapses
@Whey_standard @RobTornoe Quoting the White House statement is not checking.
@BradMossEsq No it’s not The White House claim is quoted, but there’s no effort to determine if it’s true.
@ryannicholos No it’s not. The White House claim is in the article, but there’s no reporting on whether that claim is true.
@DougieBrah @kenashgrammy If they didn’t attend the actual briefing, what, exactly, is the problem?
@DevlinBarrett Quoting the White House is no substitute for finding out of the WH claim is true. You would think four reporters might have bothered to fact-check the claim.
@RobTornoe How could their “presence” be credibly considered a problem if they were not present for the actual briefing? The Post story falls apart if they did not attend the briefing. Could that by why the four reporters didn’t bother to check?

@RadioFreeTom Trump has said some sappy stuff about Kim, for sure. But that’s just words. If this were Obama, he’d have gone to the summit, agreed to lift the sanctions, sent palettes of cash in exhange for an agreement to merely delay NK’s nuclear plans.
@RadioFreeTom No Tom, they obviously didn’t. They got some meetings but not with Trump. And no summit. And they remain an outlaw regime under heavy sanctions with the U.S. military in their face. Legitimacy? Really?

You’re absolutely right. How could I have missed it? Those coins will allow North Korea to have everything it can’t get because of the sanctions. Jeez. https://t.co/bpG9thvEAt

@ThePlumLineGS @AaronBlake If they contacted the campaign for the purpose of warning about possible Russian efforts to influence it, sure. We know that was considered, but was not done.

@MaxBoot Max, stop the histrionics. The special counsel if part of DOJ and thus answerable to him. It is not an assault on the rule of law for him to request an investigation amid evidence of wrongdoing, including wrongdoing in a probe involving him. And there is certainly such evidence.
Oh Max, where to begin. The FBI has already shown in the cases of McCabe, Strzok, Page et al that its conduct is quite worthy of investigation. That such a probe may tend to help POTUS does not change that. Trump is worth investigating and so are some of his investigators. https://t.co/zybUm7wfh2

@QuinHillyer Quin, your links are to source stories from a month after the SC probe started The actual Mueller appointment letter mentions no crime, though the SC probe is a criminal investigation. It cites only the previously existing counter terrorism investigation. https://t.co/J4YuseFe1J
@QuinHillyer That's a plausible theory, but it's not established fact that "obstruction of justice concerns" were the basis. Justice Dept. regulations require a "specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated." In other words, what crime. Where is such a statement?
@QuinHillyer @davidfrum No Quin, there are regulations governing the opening of such probes as well as starting a special counsel inv. Not at all clear they were followed. And the FISA warrants? Nothing wrong there? Please.
@QuinHillyer @davidfrum Quin, the fact that there was basis for investigating the Russian meddling does not mean that the investigation was properly undertaken or that what was done in furtherance of it was proper either.
This, from a former attorney general, gets to the question of whether there was a proper basis for the Mueller investigation to even start.  https://t.co/TOpQyXKf6a

@gabrielmalor I can think of all kinds of additional facts that could put either man in jeopardy. I think it’s wiser to stick to the known facts.
@gabrielmalor So now we’re down to an unreported $130K campaign donation. Really?
@gabrielmalor The reimbursement would suggest that if it was a campaign contribution, it was by Trump himself who, if I’m not mistaken, can spend whatever he wants on his own campaign.
@gabrielmalor You’d first have to establish that money paid by a law firm on behalf of client is actually a campaign contribution.
Rudy Giuliani tells @seanhannity POTUS reimbursed the $130,000 lawyer Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels, which would mean it was not an illegal campaign contributions by Cohen.
