@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @PressSec You do realize that the wealthy pay far less of a % of their income on taxes than everyone else, right? Because income taxes are just one of many taxes that people pay. And the rich pay a lower % of their income on payroll, property, and sales taxes.
@AOGCLOTHINGCO13 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Oh, so the 1% are victims now, huh? Yeah, they've been doing awful lately seeing their share of the nation's wealth skyrocket. Must be so hard for them.
