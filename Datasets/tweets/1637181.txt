One thing I'm increasingly noticing these days is that many of us who went into institutions solely to reform them are now on the hook for defending them, warts and all, from ill-meaning insurrectionists
Institutionalists and insurrectionists can and do collaborate, often through social bonds. Friends on the outside and friends on the inside might be working toward the same goals in very different ways. #g0vSummit
@EthanZ So should you be an insurrectionist, or an institutionalist? Choose what works for you. The important thing is achieving efficacy - the feeling that you can change the world. @EthanZ #g0vsummit
@EthanZ Us social changers have a habit of expecting everyone to become Gandhi. If we want to succeed at scale and over time, we need to invite people to take action in lightweight ways, too, like changing their profile pictures to support equal marriage. #g0vsummit
@EthanZ In his framework, @EthanZ identifies the "radical institutionalist" who takes radical action within existing institutions to bring them back to their original missions, like Adam Foss https://t.co/Iujr7wWvOT #g0vsummit
@EthanZ Institutionalists believe we make progress through our existing institutions, whereas insurrectionists look at those structures and deem them broken, and feel it's not in their interest to work within them @EthanZ #g0vsummit https://t.co/mP7LBksUo0
We often think of dutiful voters as good citizens but @ethanz sees the rabblerouser in the street as equally important. "We need both kinds of citizens: those supporting the institutions, and the people working to tell us when the institutions aren't working anymore." #g0vSummit
Ethan's asking what it means to be a good citizen in democracy, and tracing the ideal of the well-informed voter back to only the 1920s #g0vSummit

State legislatures decide whose votes for congressional representative matter in 34 states. Are these state legislators ready to be in the spotlight, instead of eliminating the meaning of our votes behind the scenes?
The only hope I can think of, short of our country's legal checks suddenly being enforced, and/or the overwhelming wave of disgust with this administration boiling over its pre-determined containers in the upcoming elections, is to direct our attention to the state level.
And to cement this mangled distortion of American democracy with a similarly poisoned high court. Tell me how our representative democracy and balance of powers is supposed to work in this context.
If the official Republican party strategy is to break the practice of equal representation, the very foundation of our government's legitimacy of power, rather than seek to represent more people. As manifested through gerrymandering and the stated mission of voter suppression.
Help me, Twitter. I know everything is on fire right now, but this fire is structural. It will require more effort on our part than blaming the DNC or Hillary to correct the fact that the will of the people is not being translated into power.
Meanwhile, the Republican president is working to corrupt the 2020 Census, mandated by our Constitution, to inform the next decade of gerrymandered district maps.
The legal challenges to this plainly illegal map-making took 7-8 years to make their way through the courts, while Republicans enjoyed pre-determined and often insurmountable advantages in key battleground states.
The Republican's REDMAP gerrymandering strategy secured them power decoupled from popularity for the majority of this decade.
Despite clear evidence of lopsided gerrymandering to disenfranchise voters in WI and NC, the court, with its ill-begotten tie-breaking vote, has taken the action of deafening inaction.
So, despite the fact that nearly all the population growth in Texas came from minorities, they will not be represented in their government.
Help me wrap my head around this, Twitter. 		The Supreme Court, itself the illegal manifestation of denying President Obama his constitutional right to selecting a Justice, has a new weekly tradition of upholding Republican gerrymandering.

In my humble opinion, that new generation must include civil society groups receiving support to study these issues, and they must work to drive research outcomes as practitioner-researchers, ie before election days.
"Venerable Democratic institutions have experience fighting voter suppression in the courts and at the polls. Cambridge Analytica may be gone, but we need a new generation to fight against those who will seek to build on its digital legacy." @JessLivMo
In 2016, the perpetrators of the microtarget-to-suppress tactic included the Republican party, as well as their new allies (and this still shocks and saddens me to witness), networked white nationalists from all around the globe. They'll be back at it for the 2018 US election.
@jesslivmo raises the important distinction that the tactic of microtargeting, in the hands of the Obama campaign, "was used to connect people locally, all with the goal of getting their friends to vote."
"Trump‚Äôs win didn‚Äôt come because his campaign expanded the Republican voter base: It came because they depressed Clinton‚Äôs." 	@JessLivMo

Responding to an audience question, @jonathanfox707 says that defining 'civic tech' has to be contextual depending on who's using tech, for what, rather than assuming there's something inherent in a given tool that's 'civic'
