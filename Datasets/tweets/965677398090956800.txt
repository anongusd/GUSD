@peter_joffrion 	Dear Peter,		I would like to share why Dr. Tran CA-39 used TruckSide Advertising.		Their campaign manager realized Trucks Advertising can stretch their campaign dollars from a 30-second radio or TV ad to 10 hours per day, 5 days per week during peak traffic.		1/2 https://t.co/eVE6fUY93s
@HaganforHouse 		It keeps on working week after week right up to election day.		More Viewings = More Contributions = Better Recognition = More Votes.		Our basic media ad cost is $2,775.00 per Truck per mo (2 Truck minimum /1-month minimum prepaid contract), includes production. https://t.co/2v9L1i6fZu
