@edalexport @RealKiraDavis And you prove  my point that he was defending others there who were protesting taking down the statue and not a part of the hate group.
@edalexport @RealKiraDavis Yes he did call the mob that. QUOTE from Trump: “Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,”

@JustinRobbins15 The evolution theory wasn’t even a belief until the 19th century. Kind of hard for the Church to comment on something non existent. In my lifetime is has taught evolution is not inconsistent with Christianity.

@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews What scripture are you referring to?
@DNakatoi @guypbenson @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews I suggest going to another parish and thinking more about Christ than a Priest.
@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews Sorry. You are just wrong. My Church has been wrong over an over in history (the core of the faith has not been though) , but Christ and the Gospel never has been. It is holy and I stand by every word.
@DNakatoi @guypbenson @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews Your Priest is 100 percent wrong and you should tell him so. https://t.co/i5CK5ynEGH
@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews I reject that too. And God didn’t do any of that.
@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews Jesus was about one thing, and one thing only. It wasn’t social justice. It was about salvation. Slave or free. Woman or man. Poor or rich. That’s it. Salvation. Full stop. And he was 💯 consistent on that. The Gospel was 💯 on that.
@DNakatoi @guypbenson @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews No. Not true. Being gay is not a mortal or venial sin. Sexual acts, straight or gay can be sinful. But being gay is not.
@guypbenson @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews The Church is against being “jailed for being gay and even executed for homosexual activity,” though.
@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews Thus the word “today.” If you know anything about Christianity then you know Christ warned of evil within it.
@PumpknSpiceSoul @JamesMartinSJ @NBCNews Umm... yes it was. Are you familiar with Jesus?
@bynermack2k @emzanotti Trump is a unicorn. No one on your side seems to understand this.

@RobGeorge I want to add this. I think it’s become almost impossible to have a national discussion on race. Not because any young blacks are “overly sensitive,” but because white adult liberals have boxed so many in the “white supremacy” box that the convo can’t even start.

@RobGeorge I remember a sorority sister wrote an op ed that the Bible forbid interracial relationships. I flipped out. Called her out. Wrote my own Op Ed. Yet, even then the flag was even on the radar of being racist. It was southern pride and not looked at as racist.

It goes without saying that if this was a GOP it world be the end of his career. I wish that saying, “The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired” would be the end of his career.
@dcaven123 It was. And he was older. Past college. But still. I feel the same.
I don’t care what you did 30 years that was stupid. I care about what decisions you are making as a leader that affect all of us today.
I will not pile on something that happened when a politician (or anyone) was young. I didn’t with Obama or Beto. I won’t do it just because it makes a Democrat look bad or because Dems do it to us. We all make mistakes, some worse than others.

@Neoavatara @_Drew_McCoy_ @davereaboi I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s real. Early 80’s was a crazy time in that way. Not many really understood how wrong that was. Just a big joke. I’m surprised we haven’t discovered more.

@jaredbro25 @poeticdinosaur @RonColeman @justinamash @RealAlisonPoole @POTUS I believe that citizenship should be an easier path (for all) but a guest worker program (much like Canada) is separate from that. It allows workers to provide for family in Mexico or Central America legally. Not about citizenship, which makes it more politically viable.
@jaredbro25 @poeticdinosaur @RonColeman @justinamash @RealAlisonPoole @POTUS I’m not arguing that point. But it’s not true that sexual abuse and trafficking is done through ports of entry.
@adamnpeck @JeremyMcLellan It’s so absurd that you actually believe conservatives believe this.

@jaredbro25 @poeticdinosaur @RonColeman @justinamash @RealAlisonPoole @POTUS 70% of women migrants being sexually abused is an emergency. The sex trafficking, the coyotes, and the mules ARE an emergency. We must fix it. For them if not for us.
@jaredbro25 @poeticdinosaur @RonColeman @justinamash @RealAlisonPoole @POTUS Let me fix that. I don’t believe hard workers are ever damaging. Immigrants are woven into the fabric of Texas. But illegal immigration is damaging &amp; unfair to those that come legally &amp; to those abused crossing. I want a guest worker program.

@Dwight_Dale It’s worse than I imagined.
@CumberlandAstro Yes, that’s why I referred to “millennials that care about things that don’t matter.” Not all of them! All my 4 are millennials!
This was lib vs lib, but it could be anyone. “KEY quote-&gt;”If you have someone who’s a white supremacist in your community, people should be aware of it...If you have someone who’s spewing hate speech, they should be aware of it”	Who decides? They do &amp; you will be destroyed. https://t.co/AP2ULT8s1a
The documentaries on The Fyre Festival on Netflix and Hulu encapsulates the vanity &amp; ridiculousness of “influencers” and millennials that care about things that, in the end, don’t matter. Have we lost a generation?
@NathanWurtzel Pretty sure they aren’t being taught that either.
@NathanWurtzel I just can’t believe that number is so high for millennials. Aren’t public schools teaching this history?
@JustinRobbins15 Hey, you guys were the ones who gave us the first sexual predator as Pres. Then nominated his enabler. I never voted for either. Did you?
@JustinRobbins15 @obianuju This has zero to do with politics. Our faith teaches that killing an unborn child or advocating for it is a grave moral sin. Anyone who does excommunicates themselves. Doing so publicly is necessary only when they influence others while claiming Catholicism.

@jasoncomix @SandraDuffy123 @slack2thefuture @EWErickson There are terrible people on both sides. Writers with blue checks said these kids should die. They advocated punching them in the face. Doxxed them. I grew up around racism. Calling people who you really have no idea about, diminishes fighting racism.
@SopanDeb Comparing “he may have had a history of trouble” to “I just want these people to die. Simple as that. Every single one of them. And their parents.” 		Come on.
@jasoncomix @SandraDuffy123 @slack2thefuture @EWErickson I’m interested in two things. Freedom and not refusing to try and understand the other side. I was a lot like you for many years (but on the opposite side) &amp; I changed. I’m not perfect, but we have to stop demonizing each other.
@jasoncomix @SandraDuffy123 @slack2thefuture @EWErickson I grew up in Jackson Ms in the 60’s &amp; was part of the 1st wave of integration in public schools. I’m very aware of symbols too. If you imagine most people wear the hat to promote racism, I can’t help you.
@SopanDeb You are really comparing things like @benshapiro joking about the clock kid being knighted to things like “the kid should be locked in their school and then the school burnt down” or offering BJs to punch the kid in the face. Really? Really?

There is a lot of troubling news out there, and social media amplifies it to a disturbing degree. If you feel anxiety on Twitter. (Or other social media) Get off it and go for a walk. Know that things aren’t as apocalyptic as they are made out to be. 5/ END.
That’s what is disturbing. When we can’t differentiate evil from simply someone disagreeing with us. And I think the constant outrage and news badly affects some people’s mental health. Think before you tweet 4/
As I read in another essay, “When I was younger, I was under the impression that knowledgeable people knew who the bad guys were and how to deal with them. Now, I sometimes don’t even know anymore what is evil, what is stupidity, and what is simply a difference in opinion.” 3/
It’s outrage after outrage. Some shake their head, some mock, but some despair. Don’t get me wrong, there are many things in the world that are truly horrifying, but when people are comparing something like a tweet or Trump to slavery, we have a problem. 2/
I recently read in an essay, “do you ever wonder what you would have been doing during slavery to speak out? You’re doing it now.” They were serious. And what we don’t think about are those who read all the bad on twitter who are so affected by it. 1/
