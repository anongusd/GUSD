RT @JTlol "Ted Kennedy voted for Medicare. He's eligible for Medicare. When he got cancer, he didn't use Medicare." http://tr.im/pN59
Where's the outrage at the extravagance on the taxpayer's dime for the luau 2night? Shrimp, ribs, clams, tempura - doesn't sound cheap 2 me.
Didn't BHO say any company taking taxpayer dollars can't be having extravagant parties. What would you call this? http://twitpic.com/8ddka
@markknoller http://twitpic.com/8ddka - How could the Obama administration allow this extravagant party to happen on the taxpayer dime?  ...
@jaketapper Ahhh, finally a journalist who cares about proper grammar - how refreshing!
@johnculberson Going to the luau tonight?
@markknoller I thought the Pres said we ALL needed to cut back? Shouldn't that include extravagant parties for the "upper mgmt" in gov't???
@markknoller I agree that he should b asked about his habit.Why weren't assoc health risks mentioned pre-election?Just mention of McC's age?
@markknoller Wow, that is just groundbreaking reporting...I know I was on the edge of my seat wondering what they all had!
I make time for making by making time for me. I set aside time to craft as it makes my life less stressful. #turningturning.com
Good riddance to bad rubbish though. Unfortunately, PA hasn't been represented by a true conservative since Santorum was voted out.
What a jerk Specter is.This is the thanks he gives to those in the GOP who have gone out of their way to support him?
@gopconference  - Why should we say yes when 38% of the House GOPers didn't?
RT @tweetmeme Bruno Movie: Bruno Movie Trailer http://bit.ly/3z2MuZ - can't wait to see this one
@McCainBlogette Please do us a favor & rejoin the Dems.We voted for your Dad but don't need you to destroy our party because he lost.
@KarlRove Is anyone going to call out Steph about his morning meetings with Rahmbo?He's doing the WH's bidding from an MSM seat.
@livedesk I get tired of our country's response to things like this. He didn't evade prison, he served his sentence. What else is he to do?
@livedesk Heck yes as long as he wins.Why shouldn't he play?He served his time, paid the price - literally. Isn't the point of prison rehab?
I can't believe the budget mess. Watching Karl & his whiteboard last night was interesting. BO is digging a hole we may never fill.
@livedesk Why should we be surprised?U mean because candidate Obama promised us tax cuts not spending?48% us didn't believe it then either.
@johnculberson Thanks for calling out my rep - Chris Carney - on the floor of the house. His constituents needed to see & hear that. Thanks!
How did Schmuck ever worm his way into the Senate. He makes my skin crawl.
@dotpat45 " turncoat Specter is out in 2010" From your lips to God's ears...
@petehoekstra Any chance the "Blue Dogs" will flip on this and vote with House Republicans?
@Michael_Steele I'd love to see some updates from our Chairman and the RNC during this pivotal time.
@the_real_steele Boy you're funny.Is this the change I can believe in? Nice to see you are post-partisan and saving your racism for GOPers.
Shaking my head at my jerk of a congressman - think he'll actually read the bill? http://tinyurl.com/cabqru
@johnculberson One only needs to see the pork amendment Reid got in for NV to see why they want it passed before it is read. Keep fighting!
So happy right now! Our Reps found their spines and did what was necessary - no on the stimulus! Make the Dems own their pork!
Huzzah! NO REPUBS voted for the non-stimulus! http://tinyurl.com/bkovnn - Take that Madame Speaker!
@livedesk Why won't GOP Sens & Reps stick to their conservative principles and vote no on the stimulus? Or no on Holder?
@livedesk Should he?No.Will he?Probably.Some of them will sell us (their constituents) out in order to "work together"- to bury us in debt.
@petehoekstra Exactly!Which is why we needn't get tingles when Pres comes looking for "bipartisanship". Just say no to the un-stimulus bill!
@johnculberson Right on with the tax cuts. Like them or not, and we know the Dems don't, they work. Stick to your guns, we appreciate it.
@johnculberson Meaningless, definitely. Noble? Not so much. He wants you all on board, so if it fails, the Dems don't go down alone.
@petehoekstra Sounds like Rep. Hoekstra got a tingle up his leg during the meeting. Makes me sick to my stomach. Just say no to the bailout.
@livedesk Everyone has a dream...
@livedesk I think the Pres' stimulus plan is no stimulus, just pork for those that helped get him elected.Tax cuts for workers are needed.
BO has no intention of accepting anything the Repbs have to say on this bill.Let the Dems go down in flames with this.
These reps need to stop letting BHO "engage" them. They need to stick to fiscal conservative beliefs and vote "no".
Sounds like Representative Hoekstra got a tingle up his leg during the meeting. Makes me sick to my stomach. Just say no to the bailout.
Trying to cool down here in PA where Al Gore's Global Warming has brought us such hot temps.It's downright hot here when the mercury hits 8.
@johnculberson You guys need 2 hit the airwaves on these exclusions early & often.Most Americans won't go for continued exclusion of 1 party
Hanging my head in shame over the spinelessness of my party & their utter disinterest in doing what is right with secs of treasury & state.
Nice MaineMom - hope you don't teach your kids to be so disrespectful!
Obama was eloquent? Did you not hear the uhs, ums, uhuhuhs???
john totally got obama off his game. he looked like a child, raising his hand because "the bully is picking on me"!
Obama did well? Uh, uh, uh, I didn't hear what you said?
Hackett needs to step up the attacks. Time is short and Carney will only debate once (coward!). If Carney wins this year, he's in for life.
Anyone else following the Carney/Hackett race in PA's 10th Congressional District? As a resident, I have a huge interest. Thoughts?
Enjoying reading the *Main Room* threads at www.hillaryclintonforum.net. Quite interesting reading for Repubs.These folks may help us win.
still sitting in awe of what I have heard over the last 2 nights
Great article about what I see as modern-day McCarthyism in Hollywood. http://tinyurl.com/5ay2w8 . Can't wait to see this movie.
Same old from Pelosi. http://tinyurl.com/5v2urr. Come up with new attacks and maybe start doing your job.
@johnculberson Will you be on the floor on Monday? Of course my rep (carney - didn't vote for him) won't be there, he cowtows to the Speaker
Watching some Fox News coverage of the session after speaker Pelosi shut down the Congress. Go Tom Price.
Wishing the American people would open their eyes and see that the Dem leadership is holding our country hostage until they win Presidency.
Watching video of some members of my party doing the right thing. John Mccain needs to stand up with the "rebel republicans".
@KRyanJames - they needed to have more reps and john mccain needed to go to the mattresses with them.
@johnculberson great to see some repubs standing up for those they represent. Keep fighting the good fight!
Sitting at work, daydreaming about my vacation next week!
Wondering what twitter is all about, if it is worth the space on my Touch.
watching the golden girls. Getting ready for bed cause I have to work Thursday.
