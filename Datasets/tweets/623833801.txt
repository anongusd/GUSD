Till we get an IGP that can sack a cop for taking money from a driver, the public will not have trust in the Police.
If a Policeman can take 2GH from a driver without a license and let him go, then he can also take 20GH from a thief n leave him

We need that breed of Police that won't sit down and wait for victims to bring their own evidence but will rather go and get it.
For the military to plead that the CDS allow military Police carry out its own investigation tells you that no one trust GHPolice
The IGP must focus on restoring the integrity our Police Service once had. That's a prerequisite to stopping mob justice.
Is there any University in Ghana where a "thief" was caught and wasn't lynched?
Maybe the CJ should get a week off, get all data of sentenced people, follow up and see how many of them are still in prison.
To end mob justice, we need  re-orient ourselves. We need to take a second look at our educational curricula. Let's add MORALITY
The level of impunity is so high that a trained policeman wouldn't mind taking 20cedis just to let go a criminal.
How will mob justice end when some Policemen are seen drunk in their uniforms !!
In the olden days, people used to revered the police because they were so discipline and commanded respect. What do we see now?
Unfortunately,just the few corrupt policemen have made it seem all Police men are corrupt. The good ones have been so quiet
How can mob justice stop when you catch a thief today, send him to the police station and the next day you see him walking freely

@ebennesta394 oh yea im fine by grace
Thantophobia, the fear of losing someone you love.
Limerence is the technical term for having a crush on a person.
A woman donated a kidney to her boss, who then fired her when she took too long to recover from the operation.
Misophonia is a condition in which you are easily annoyed or angered by little things. Such as a person who eats or breathes too loudly.
People often pretend to be happy because smiling tends to be easier than explaining to others why they're upset.
Your height is usually determined by your father. Intelligence, emotional strength and body shape is determined by the mother.
Respect blind people. Why? Because they judge others by their personality, not by their looks
Being sarcastic on a regular basis can add up to 3 yrs to your life. Sarcasm is extremely healthy for the mind.
Atychiphobia describes a person who fears that they aren't good enough to be in a relationship with a specific person.
Alexithymia describes a person who has a difficult time expressing their feelings to others.
Watermelon and cucumbers are loaded with water, so naturally, eating them keeps you and your skin hydrated.
Lemon juice with a pinch of salt (warm) every morning lowers cholesterol levels and brings down your weight.
Remaining silent is one of the most effective ways to get information out of someone.
When waking up, jump up quickly and the rapid movement will help rebalance any pooled blood and quicken blood flow to your brain and heart.
Good things come to those who believe, better things come to those who wait, and the best things come to those who don't give up.
Don’t think too much. You’ll create a problem that wasn’t even there in the first place.
People come and go in your life, but the right ones will always stay.
When you fall in love with someone, their flaws turn into perfections..
When you fall for someone's personality, everything about them becomes beautiful.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of an unlived life.
I fear to give up prematurely more than to die. Oh Lord, let me not end dis because Iv suffered to come this far.
