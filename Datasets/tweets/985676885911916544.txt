@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump You assumed that because he is black we had to put the MAGA hat on him. If that is not what you assumed, please explain. When you say "I think you just find black people and throw a MAGA hat on them" it seems like you are saying black people cannot support Trump.
@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump I dont care about who you work with, I care about the racist and rude comments you made about my good friend Stanley.
@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump No because you assumed from the very beginning that we "find black people and throw maga hats on them" as if black people cant support Trump all on their own.

@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump Which is fine. I just think you owe Stanley an apology for so rudely using him in your attempt to attack the Republican party. "Resist" all you want, but you have to admit, it's pretty rude to assume that we "just threw a maga hat" on him.
@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump It was his hat, did you want me to confiscate it? Tell him he couldn't wear it? Get a grip, there are people of color who support our president. Learn to accept it, and stop belittling others for their veiws.
@b24fowler @CodyPorterME @realDonaldTrump This is a small clip of his full interview. Stanley is an amazing guy, with a bright mind and wonderful ideas! The fact that you are belittling him by calling him "kid" and assuming he is not capable of holding and sharing his own views is actually pretty racist.
