Insert any names here; any party/ideology. That this is even asked reveals media‚Äôs role in devolving, un-civil society: ‚Äú________ rejected the idea that _____‚Äôs divisive rhetoric could have played a role in...confrontation...arguing that blame lies solely on...alleged assailant.‚Äù https://t.co/9hvOjyclZD
Interesting analysis here, but almost glaring in its omission of @HowardSchultz ... https://t.co/kRmpxt4AeX
Sexual assault, harassment and general good ol‚Äô-boys-club culture: these are things neither party exclusively owns. It‚Äôs a byproduct of unchecked male leadership drunk with its own power, in every corner of the public and private sector. Hopeful we are living in times of change.

@nprpolitics Also, not a fact check. It‚Äôs like someone over @nprpolitics is trying to simultaneously work two handles and accidentally Ctrl+v here instead of @DNC
@nprpolitics The more I think about this, the more upsetting it is. If this is the standard for @nprpolitics ‚Äòfact-checks‚Äô, then they might as well fact-check @POTUS for recognizing WWII veterans because technically he wasn‚Äôt the president responsible for winning that war either. #SOTU2019
@nprpolitics @POTUS stated a fact that is 100% true. He did not misstate or overstate or take out of context or claim to be the party to which all of the women belong (although there are ALSO increasing Republican women each Congress). This is why trust in MSM is st all-time low. #SOTU2019
Am I the only one who thinks the out-of-focus setup behind @staceyabrams looks a little strange? Or like maybe they‚Äôre about to burst out in chorus? #SOTU2019
Every #SOTU speech should have more WWII vets. Puddle of mush over here.
Ok, now I‚Äôm absolutely convinced there was a lil sumthin‚Äô extra in everyone‚Äôs pre- #SOTU2019 punch...

Every major municipality should be sending letters from city leaders demanding @GovernorVA resign. How about it @AlexandriaVAGov ? #NorthamMustResign
Serious q: What does it take for a guy who doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô he is in a picture, after explicitly apologizing for being in the picture, to then ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô he has lost ability to be effective and step down - the only option @GovernorVA left open for resignation? #NorthamMustResign

@ktumulty ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@GovernorVA Says won‚Äôt resign until he ‚Äòfeels‚Äô he‚Äôs no longer effective. That he ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô he is not in the photo. At what point do feelings and beliefs of majority of Virginians matter - who feel and believe he is a distraction and no longer fit to serve? #NorthamMustResign
@GovernorVA Bravo for recognizing a need for personal reflection and healing hurts you have inflicted. You can do that much better once you leave the governor‚Äôs mansion. Now you are simply a distraction; refusing to resign is a disservice to all Virginians. #NorthamShouldResign

@AlexandriaVAGov We ‚ù§Ô∏è ALX but daily consider if makes sense to stay longterm. Poor schools mean pvt school expense on top of prop. taxes that mysteriously go up despite stagnant home sale values. Ppl move here bc of enviro created by King Street. Keep overtaxing &amp; run off biz, res will follow.
@AlexandriaVAGov And clearly there is interest in figuring that one out.... May not be a local biz owner but as a local family not rep‚Äôd on the survey let me share that we - like many others- DO feel impacts of local biz success/failure and owners we‚Äôve talked to have cited taxes as a reason.
@AlexandriaVAGov Also, it‚Äôs a sad state of affairs that whopping 65% of parents surveyed do not have their kids in public schools - and feel they can‚Äôt because schools rank so low. Talk about where you want tax dollar value to show up: https://t.co/YviGsccZHG
@AlexandriaVAGov I was referring to the actual reports - forgive me, there‚Äôs a glancing, buried tax mention as part of ‚Äòvalue of services‚Äô. But odd the reports give so little attention to this BIG issue affecting our local economy while acknowledging participants *continue* to prioritize.
