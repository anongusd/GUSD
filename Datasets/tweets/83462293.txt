And also as a reminder: VA Gov. Northam is the guy who is currently resisting calls for his resignation after he apologized for a racist photo in his yearbook and then later claimed it wasn't him. https://t.co/26GMiPUGvJ
Northam's comments on this were sloppy and very easy to take out of context. But that's what is going on with the bill. Again, see that Vox piece.
Among other things, the bill would reduce the number of doctors needed to approve of a 3rd trimester abortion from 3 to 1. it does not, as Trump implied, legalize infanticide.
RT @pdmcleod: "America will never be a socialist country," says Trump, ending months of speculation.
Putting aside Northam's other problems (which are serious) for a moment, this is about an abortion bill in Virginia. Vox has a really good explanation of this very complicated back-and-forth here:  https://t.co/QJW69jkAx5
Trump says that VA Gov. Ralph Northam said "he would execute a baby after birth." That's not what happened.	As he spox put it: Northam was talking about "the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.‚Äù

Correction: The *vast* majority of Interior would shut down. A very small part of it was funded in a bill passed earlier this year (the Bureau of Reclamation &amp; the Central Utah Project). I inadvertently put it on both of these lists.

@EBOlady @Cenphx @djlavoie @RealFacelessMan @cspan This isn't a cloture vote. 51 votes needed.

Congress has already funded these departments, which would stay open: 	Defense	Health and Human Services	Labor	Education	Energy	Interior	Army Corps of Engineers	Legislative Branch	Capitol Police	GAO	Library of Congress	Veterans Affairs
This doesn't mean all of those departments will completely cease to function. They'll still be able to provide "essential" services and "essential" employees will be working.

Basically, a senator who opposes Kavanaugh could vote yes on cloture to say, I want to give all of you the opportunity to try to confirm this guy even though I can't personally vote yes.
It's unlikely ‚Äî but possible ‚Äî that a senator could vote yes on cloture and still vote no on Kavanaugh's confirmation tomorrow. That sounds insane but it does happen. McCain did something very similar on Obamacare https://t.co/oTbmhYrDoI

Sen. Murkowski, who is undecided on Kavanaugh, says it's important that all senators get time to read this 100 page FBI report before they vote, per @LissandraVilla https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29
Ok, now we're learning that the report is 100 pages. It's only in print &amp; senators have to go in person to a room to read it. The first vote is tomorrow. https://t.co/6u0WDJso0H
I‚Äôm getting a lot of questions for colleagues on this so presumably others want to know as well:	We have no idea when the first vote on Kavanaugh will be tomorrow. We should find out tonight.
GOP Sen. Tillis says he's been briefed on the report and says he'll read it later today. I don't know if this language in his statement is intentional, but it struck me: "There is still no contemporaneous evidence that corroborates these allegations." https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29
Another important note: It's not clear that any senator has read the whole FBI report yet. They all got briefings on it from staffers &amp; that's where a lot of their statements are coming from. https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29
Which isn't to say it won't leak! But seems unlikely.
Oh yeah, here's the thing about this: https://t.co/OzCU4gYL3e	It's on paper! Crazy, I know! But right now it's a classified document that's only on paper. So leaking would be a pain (so much scanning) but also a federal crime.
So you have Grassley: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing in it that we didn‚Äôt already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh."		And Schumer: ‚ÄúI disagree with Senator Grassley‚Äôs statement that there was no hint of misconduct."
In the meantime, the report is either totally exculpatory or, you know, not depending on the letter next to the name of the senator you're asking. https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29
Several senators, including Republicans, have said this week they'd like the FBI report or a summary to be public. We'll see if that happens.  https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29
So basically Republicans say the FBI report totally clears Kavanaugh, Democrats say the FBI didn't interview key witness (including Kavanaugh &amp; Ford) so this in incomplete. 		We can't know for ourselves because the report is classified https://t.co/Uw4dpeQv29

Senators will start being able to view the results of the FBI investigation tomorrow morning apparently. Those results will be on paper(!) and can only be viewed in a confidential setting. We‚Äôll see how that shakes out tomorrow
@KDbyProxy For sure. Super rare. But possible! I am preparing for panic in any direction
To be super clear: Once cloture has passed the train is out of the station. The vote is happening. So even a member who opposes the nomination could vote yes to move forward to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs vote now instead of voting tomorrow‚Äù or at 1am or whatever.
@JaneEyre1967 To be super clear it‚Äôll go forward anyway. It‚Äôs just cutting short how long it will take. So ‚Äúlet‚Äôs vote now instead of voting tomorrow‚Äù or at 1am or whatever
@JaneEyre1967 It‚Äôs basically just saying ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs vote now‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúI approve this.‚Äù So ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready... to shoot this down‚Äù
@joshuajfriedman Essentially yes. Slightly different procedure because that was technically a budget bill and the Senate‚Äôs rules are insane. But in effect, yes.
McCain did something similar on the Obamacare repeal, for example, voting to let it move forward before voting no on the bill itself. It happens but not very often on big bites.
An important aside for vote-watchers: It‚Äôs ~possible~ a senator could vote yes for cloture (basically saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs end debate and vote‚Äù) and still vote no on the final vote. But that‚Äôs very hypothetical
If Kavanaugh makes it through the cloture vote on Friday, there will be a final vote this weekend (likely Saturday). They‚Äôll still need 50 votes + Pence. Republicans have 51, so they can lose one.
Here are the big undecided votes on Kavanaugh at this point: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) who was a yes but called for the FBI investigation so who knows.
Ok, here‚Äôs where we are: McConnell has set an initial vote on Kavanaugh for (sometime) Friday. That still needs 50 votes + Mike Pence to pass. If it fails that‚Äôs a BIG DEAL and could be ‚Äî but may not be ‚Äî the end.

TL;DR: An investigator says that the physical abuse allegation against Rep. Keith Ellison is "unsubstantiated" *because* Monahan said there was video and wouldn't share it. Now it's going to law enforcement to see if further investigation is needed https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
/6 Monahan's attorney questions why Dems believe Christine Blasey Ford and not his client. ‚ÄúThe Democrats are not applying the same standard here,‚Äù Parker said. https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
/5 Monahan's lawyer argues investigators don't need the video, she has friends who corroborated her account (which the investigator acknowledges). https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
Karen Monahan's lawyer told @LissandraVilla he also has not seen the video she has alleged she has of Ellison pulling her off the bed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel I need to see the video‚Äù until she‚Äôs ready to show it, he said. https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
/3 The Minnesota Democratic (DLF) party has confirmed to BuzzFeed News that they're sending this report to law enforcement for investigation. The Minneapolis City Atty is passing it to someone else, though, b/c Ellisons' son is on the city council  https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
/2 That investigator wrote a report saying she couldn't substantiate the claim against Ellison because Monahan has said she had video of the incident, but wouldn't provide it. (Monahan has given varying reasons on why she hasn't released the tape) https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o
So, the Keith Ellison investigation is complicated. The MN Dem party hired an attorney to investigate Karen Monahan's claim that Ellison pulled her off of a bed in 2016 &amp; yelled at her (not other emotional abuse she alleges) https://t.co/KkBg3Yoy3o via @LissandraVilla

Graham: ‚ÄúIf his nomination were to fall short, I would encourage President Trump to re-nominate Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. It would ‚Äì in effect ‚Äì be appealing the Senate‚Äôs verdict directly to the American people."
Quite a statement from Sen. Lindsey Graham. He says if the Kavanaugh nomination fails, Trump should re-nominate him so Americans can elect a more Republican Senate in November &amp; confirm him then.

Also: Guess who is in charge of the current ethics complaints against Kavanaugh on the DC Circuit? That's right, it is MERRICK GARLAND. https://t.co/sjUHx9JkB8
On top of that, Kavanaugh is already facing at least two ethics complaints on his current court &amp; there's no precedent for what would happen to those if he does go to SCOTUS.

This McCarthy bill argues, "federal law prohibits non-citizens from voting in elections for Federal office" (not what SF is doing) and that, generally, "allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens"
Supporters of the non-citizen voting initiative in San Francisco argue, essentially, that these are parents with children in school &amp; they should be involved in choices around their education.
More background on that here, but basically SF is letting parents who have children under 19 y.o. to vote for members of the Board of Education. Not for anything else. https://t.co/BQF33SYJex
Still, you might ask, why? Why now? Well the bill, which is very short, specifically cites San Francisco's decision to let non-citizens vote in school board elections.
The bill (which, again, is not law, it's more like a statement) is sponsored by Kevin McCarthy who you know, wants to be speaker and maintain a good relationship with Trump.
So the House is going to vote tomorrow on a non-binding bill that basically just says it's the sense of the House "that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens."

@steinalicious No he is a child! But, then again, most of them are.		I honestly haven't even finished Becca's season because I got so bored. But I am very ready for this one because of the above.
@stephemcneal Yes! Had totally forgotten about this. I do think ABC was easier on him than on other contestants. The fact that Colton is a virgin was a huge plot point for no reason this season and they played comedic music behind it! (Same with Ashley I, etc, etc)
@steinalicious Yes! Thank you Andrew! I had totally forgotten about that
Basically this is going to be a complete shit show and not for the reasons ABC thinks it will. /end, probably.
I'm extremely interested to see how ABC handles this, given that they've not been great with virgin contestants in the past (where that's generally used as a laugh-line) and, again, just to emphasize, are terrible at handling the concept of sex.
And now ABC has chosen (I'm 98% certain) the first-ever virgin bachelor(ette). They've had virgins on the show before ‚Äî but never had as the star. So what happens, exactly, when a legit *major* facet of the show is fucking three people and then choosing 2 of them?
This is I think a week before the star gets engaged to one of these people. So, yeah, makes sense you'd want to have sex with that person first. But also we can't call it "sex" because fucking 3 different people 3 nights in a row is too icky for TV  ‚Äî so again, "fantasy suites"
So The Bachelor(ette) is a franchise that likes to pretend that sex doesn't exist because... network TV I guess? Instead they have "fantasy suites" where for 3 consecutive nights, their star "stays over" with a different dude(tte) and totally doesn't bang. But definitely does.

Whitehouse says Kavanaugh's really explicit proposed questions in the Lewinsky case "Were kinda amateurish and showboating ‚Ä¶ certainly inconsistent with his later views on the presidency‚Äù - that POTUS should be free from questioning or ‚Äúany kind of legal accountability.‚Äù #am2dm
Whitehouse is meeting with SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh: "This is part of the standard process of review." Asked if this is a bit of a ruse, given that Dems will largely oppose Kavanaugh: "I wouldn't want to prejudge my colleauges and i haven't" announced yet.
Sen. Whitehouse, can you never be president because your surname is White House? 	Whitehouse: Chuckles quietly. "That is not on the program." #am2dm

Boswell retired from Congress in 2013, after 16 years in the House. He was a veteran who served in Vietnam and, obviously, just a complete badass. He died on Friday.
At the time this story came out, I was working for The Hotline, which loves a funny headline. So for the week I was writing about Boswell updates, I inserted his name into Chuck Norris memes. My fav: 	Leonard Boswell Doesn't Sleep, He Waits.
Ok, the intruder is gone. Everyone is safe. Boswell has two broken ribs from fighting this guy. Does he miss work? Nope. He's back in Congress a few days later like nothing happened.
At this point, the grandson runs into the room now armed with a shotgun. He cocks it.	Click click.	The intruder makes a run for it and rushes out the front door. Grandson chases him outside and fires two warning shots in the air ‚Äî yeah, bitch, this thing's loaded.
Now the intruder has forgotten about two really important things here: 	1. Leonard Boswell does not fuck around.	2. His grandson isn't the room anymore. Lesson: Never miscount the men.
Now what does Dody, a true unsung hero of this story, do? She reaches up and puts her hand on the intruder's cheek as he's holding a gun to her head and tells him he doesn't want to do this. So he lets her go.
At this point, Boswell's wife Dody wakes up. I can't recall her age, but she is pretty frail and has arthritis. The intruder grabs her, holds the gun to her head now and again demands money
They get up and Boswell keeps hitting him over and over, the guy is going blow-for-blow with ‚Äî once more with feeling A 77-YEAR-OLD MAN. His grandson at this point snaps-to and sneaks into the other room going for a gun, while Boswell keeps fighting the intruder
Boswell later told WaPo: ‚ÄúMy instinct was: ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre going to shoot, shoot me. And I‚Äôm comin‚Äô after you.‚Äô I wanted to get my hands on him.‚Äù So he grabs the guy and now they're falling down the stairs punching each other. The guy hits Boswell so hard with the pistol he's bleeding
The guy is asking for money and says he's going to kill Boswell's daughter. Now, Leonard Boswell who was again 77(!!) doesn't take shit from anyone. So he just starts running at the guy.
Ok Leonard Boswell story time. And get ready because this should be an action movie. So, back in 2011 the congressman (who was 77!) woke up in the middle of the night to an intruder in his home. The guy had grabbed his daughter and was holding a gun to her head.

Reporter: "People who criticize the president publicly on TV ... are they at greater risk of losing their security clearances than people who stay silent?"		Sanders: "This is looked at on a case by case basis and we will do an individual review and make that determination."
On the list of potential security clearance revocations: Bruce Ohr, who still works for DOJ. Asked why POTUS doesn't just fire him, Sanders: "I don't have any personnel announcements on that front."
Sanders does not answer when @MajorCBS asks repeatedly whether the admin has "any reason to believe or evidence to suggest Brennan has misused classified information or monetized his access to it."
Brennan, along with the others Trump is considering revoking security clearances for, has been highly critical of Trump's presidency. Brennan wrote in June: "I will speak out until integrity returns to the White House" https://t.co/2lRNugO5u1
Sanders, quoting Trump: "Mr. Brennan has recently leveraged his status as a former high-ranking official with access to highly sensitive information to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations, wild outbursts on the internet and television about this administration."
Sanders, quoting Trump, says that while former CIA directors (and others) typically keep their security clearance to advise their successors, Brennan's potential advise is "outweighed by the risks posed by his erratic conduct and behavior."
Sarah Huckabee Sanders announces Trump is revoking ex-CIA Dir. John Brennan's security clearance. Trump is also considering revoking clearances for: James Clapper, James Comey, Michael Hayden, Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr
