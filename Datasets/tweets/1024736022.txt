It doesn’t matter how #recovery starts, as long as you recover. Find a network to support you. I am ready to be more public about this part of my life because people are stronger when we work together and share experiences. #RecoveryCommunity #StrongerTogether #Addiction #sober
I am thankful my journey in recovery didn’t begin with a rock-bottom story, but it could have gone differently. Unchecked addiction is dangerous.
When I decided to cut alcohol out of my diet to be more healthy, it was much harder than I expected. Addiction isn’t always apparent, but that doesn’t make it any less real or less dangerous. Recognizing when you struggle to be in control of your own mind and behaviors is key.

@RODGERLUCAS4 @espositorpedo What is up with the follow limits on twitter?  I don’t see the point... 5000 isn’t that many when you follow public figures and have a lot of niche interests. I’m slowly unfollowing public figures but it takes a lot of time.

Anyone can become an addict. Addiction and drugs are not limited to any community, and the impact of addiction ripples in all directs.
A final note related to the topic: even suburban white mom’s can become violent crack-heads. Part of why one teacher dismissed my request for help was that my story didn’t match her preconceived ideas of what was possible for a white, honors student. Obviously, this is wrong.
This thread is the most personal story I’ve ever shared publicly. 💙🙏🏼		If you suspect a child is in danger, do the right thing and report it.  It’s just a phone call, and it could save a life. https://t.co/uowlmNooeW
Please. If you suspect or know that someone is in danger, do the right thing. You might help improve or save a life. Thank you. 🙏🏼
Today, 15 years later in a Walmart, I made sure to tell my high school history teacher that he failed at his job. He consciously neglected his responsibility to report child abuse.		It felt good to have that moment.
My mother is not dead, but she is now a literal homeless junkie. Maybe things could have turned out differently if a teacher had cared. Maybe she could have recovered.  Maybe an excellent student would have recovered. Maybe things would be better if someone had done their job.
I told two of my high school teachers what was going on. This one simply gave me a blank stare and then completely disregarded me.  He went back to writing my discipline referral. The other accused me of lying and called me a “spoiled, little bitch” for “disrespecting” my mother.
Some nights I would have to run from the house. I slept on playground equipment near my bus-stop several nights. This was before cell phones were common. It was lonely and terrifying.
I was afraid to sleep at home because my mother was just starting to use crack, and she was becoming violent at night. I’d woken up to her punching or choking me several times so I would stay awake all night until she was passed out. That was usually early in the morning.
Today, I ran into the only teacher who ever punished me in school. I told him he neglected his job my not calling DCF for me. I‘d been falling asleep in class for weeks so he would make me stand in the back. When I fell asleep standing, I was written up for disturbing the class.

@midnightslacker @securitybrew @malanalysis And I always end up getting a new Chromebooks because I love them... even though I use a Mac for my work.
@midnightslacker @securitybrew @malanalysis Definitely look at Chromebooks if you want “feel of a Mac” without spending more than $300. They have insanely good battery life because the operating system is so light. I’ve had 3 over the last few years. I’ve given them away to someone who needed a computer each time...
@midnightslacker @securitybrew @malanalysis I agree about getting a Chrome.  They are cheap totally worth it.  I use one for everyday things because it was only $200 and I don’t have to worry about my toddler causing an expensive disaster.

@Trigger_Treats It definitely works well for tying someone up... and can be removed easily and doesn’t hurt. To bring it back to the point... it’s super creepy that he would mention blue tape in regards to human trafficking.  I wonder how much tape they kept on the “Lolita express”.
@Trigger_Treats At least it’s not a bunch of matchbox cars taped to craft sticks... not sure what that’s about ... and tape around every table leg.  A few nights ago he taped my legs together so I was “trapped”... kids are silly.
@Trigger_Treats I was thinking the same when I posted it. 😂 Now I cant look at the tape and not think Trump orange. I got a few sample rolls of it and my young son has been obsessed with taping things lately. So there’s random 🍊 tape all over the place.

@ChalbaudOscar @DonJulesVerne @ewarren @maddow @MSNBC Fair enough, I will listen to and give consideration to each candidate.  However, I’ve been hoping Warren would run for years, and I don’t think anyone can top her when it comes down to sharp details and debate.  It’s still early. 🤓 #Warren2020
@realnikhove @The_Acumen I mean @realnikhove’s answer was solid... I wasn’t preemptively praising my own comment. 🤓
@realnikhove @The_Acumen This is a solid answer.  There’s 20million people here and a lot of rural areas that don’t get the attention/public services/education they should. Too many well off transplants who are against public services for poor. Massive wealth disparity. Lot of Pill-mills and other drugs.

@Voter_2018 @tweetmommybop No.  She sounds humble and nervous for the future of humanity.  Her voice shakes but she moves through it.  I admire that a lot.  I’ve also watched her grow from “wtf am I doing” to “I accept my purpose here”.

@tweetmommybop I can’t nap, so I strategically stayed in bed until noon.  🤷‍♂️. happy new year!
@tweetmommybop and she never wanted to be a Senator or President.  She’s just good at it and she accepted her civic duty to step up. She is ONLY running because Trump has created such a mess.  She was integral in cleaning up Bush economics and she is best qualified to focus on the big picture.
@Marg2057 @tweetmommybop Preach. 👏🏼. Happy new year to all.  I have high hope for Elizabeth Warren and I will support her all the way.  However, I would vote for a chair or a piece of bacon over Trump.

@tweetmommybop Hillary wasn’t very inspiring.  She was smug and unrelatable.  She also *wanted* to be president so much it was toxic.  Elizabeth Warren fires people up the way Bernie did, but she has the benefit of not being Bernie and having an epic record of fighting for people.  🖖🏼💙🤓

@DavernSw @djrothkopf ...but I firmly do not believe Louis CK is a monster.  He acknowledged his misconduct, he apologized, and he spoke strongly in support of women in me-too. His openness about his behavior should be a segue for discussions on sexual coercion and consent, not a reason to attack him.
@DavernSw @djrothkopf That's how I took it.  His comedy has always been like that.  In his style, I would expect him to round out the "joke" and say it's his generation's fault that these kids have so many messes to clean up and live in such a hostile environment.  Of course I'm speculating...
@maydaymindy9 Instead of burring him at the stake, @louisck and his ownership of his behavior is a great segue to discuss problem behaviors and help other to identify patterns of sexual coercion and a greater understanding of consent.  🖖
@maydaymindy9 It was sexual misconduct. He abused his power and was a creep, but he didn't force anyone to do anything or touch anyone without permission. He acknowledged his behavior, apologized, and committed to being better. He was apologetic and supportive of women in #metoo.
@ChaseWright85 Wow. If I'd reported every time someone at work asked me out or creeped me out... well... maybe I would have gotten my own office.  Open work spaces are obnoxious.  Sorry you had to fire this guy... that's a terrible call from the home office.

@williamlegate He said I couldn’t even have known about the accident protection because it wasn’t sold until April 2017... I made him look up my purchase date of the warranty... April 2017.  On the way out of the store I shouted “don’t by Apple, they screw you on repairs! Get a chromebook!” 😂
@williamlegate I broke up with Apple on Wednesday.  I went to get the screen of my MacBook Pro. Was told $300 on phone. At the store, I’m told it’s going to be $680, and the genius called me a liar about being sold a warranty with accident protection.

@SippinMyCoffee @vermontgmg @Fahrenthold I didn’t take him seriously as a candidate.  I foolishly thought he would never get elected.  I don’t think he would have been elected if Comey hadn’t deterred people in the fence about Hillary.  (I respect Comey a lot... but he should NOT have interfered when he did.)
@Spawn_of_Santa @onesarcastic_b @QuancyClayborne Oh true.  On this note, I’ve never liked the term/classification of “minority”... such elitist crap.
@txmedic37 @lisastark351 Good for your dad!  Smoking around kids is so messed up.  I’m glad that smoking culture is so different now.  (But even when I went to college, I was shocked to see a smoking section in an Alabama McDonalds... that wasn’t that long ago.)
@txmedic37 @lisastark351 I grew up with a mother who smoked with the windows rolled up... so yeah.. crappy lungs. I definitely had horrible hot flashes on top of a fever.  Sweat for days.  Yuck.  		I know my kid is sick when he actually wants to cuddle and sleep.  😂
@onesarcastic_b @QuancyClayborne @QuancyClayborne I’d love to hear what you have to say about this. 😊
@onesarcastic_b @QuancyClayborne I use brown a lot... I’m sure it’s offensive to some because what isn’t... but my intentions are good.  I’m autistic and facial recognition is 	 hard for me. Unless someone has overtly black features, I usually can’t tell race just by looking at people. Brown is more inclusive.🤷‍♂️
@lisastark351 @txmedic37 Glad you’re feeling better.  My 3yo and I were miserable for over a week around Thanksgiving.  I finally had to break down and go to urgent care for  antibiotics and steroids. I hate taking meds, but I felt better than I have in a year after a round of prednisone. Good stuff. 👍🏼

@NyotaimoriNurse @SassBaller Why bring him up?  These crimes are not comparable.  Did you read/hear her own words?  The rape kit violated and traumatized her more than Brock Turner ever did.  She wasn’t raped.  They were both drunk adults fondling each each other behind a dumpster.

@SassBaller This is wrong.  This is also mental health and/or drugs.   Prescription drugs cause this too.   This is just sad.  I know the girl targeted was protected... but that doesn’t make any of it ok.   Maybe If someone talked calmly to the woman who sunglasses in the morning?

@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace I’m going to assume food was intentionally cut of and millions were starved, Yemen style. Oh shoot, too soon. Yeah, we’re all doomed.
@kylegriffin1 Even my 77yo GOP grandad thinks he should will be impeached.
@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace Right. But capitalism isn’t sustainable either. We’re in the end game now.
@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace Calling them Nazis is throwing angry shade.  They are becoming authoritarian by blatantly undermining democracy.  The leap isn’t huge.  But yes, it’s hyperbole.  They only keep a few Central Americans in concentration camps... I mean detention centers.
@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace But there’s a big difference between “oh shoot that whole village died because our distribution methods suck” and “let’s systematically round up and exterminate ethnic groups”...
@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace Communism is easily exploited by fascism and authoritarianism.  That kills people.  And bread shortages.  There’s that, too.  But starvation should NOT be an issue anywhere on the planet at this point.  We have the resources to care for everyone if we just try to get along.  🤷‍♂️
@AFC_Harry34 @Cost2kill @RJohnHayes1 @Imamofpeace Nazism is based on eugenics and ethnic cleansing. Communism is an economic system that believes everyone is equal and works for equal shares. They are NOT the same. Even if communism has failed and been corrupted many times over, at its core, it’s not supposed to be evil. 🤗

@Free_Media_Hub @realDonaldTrump It’s been happening to years and our representatives are too weak to do anything.  They only care about keeping their jobs and not about doing what is morally right.  Their power comes from American ignorance, and I can’t take it anymore.  I want to share everything I have!

@AlieBear @davidjanchondo @HindHassanNews @realDonaldTrump It’s not a problem. I just thought it sounded unlikely that anything in English would be chanted at a French protest... turns out the video was London. So, moot point. It’s all good.

@Whitedonte1 @freddavelynn @iowahawkblog I was going to make a joke like, did you have only the black kids in capture the flag jail... then it might be a problem... but it’s not even funny. Jail is a real consequence of society.  Kids don’t need censorship from that. Hell, when I was in grade school my mom went to jail.

@freddavelynn @iowahawkblog I hadn’t thought of this in years.  These were great times.  My asthma got better from running, a lot of us shed some extra weight.

@freddavelynn @iowahawkblog And the teams would self organize with different kids having different strengths but always including everyone. Even being put in “jail” was a bonding experience, a place to cheer on your team, and someone got to be the hero when they freed teammates from jail.

@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution I’ve been suspicious of the Clintons since It became known that Bill was palling around with Jeff Epstein... the billionaire pedophile.  Sure, maybe it was nothing.  But this guy is sick and he didn’t even hide his behavior.  Makes me question the Clintons. (Not pizzagate. Lol.)
RT @dcpoll: @toshea66 @3L3V3NTH @Kris_Sacrebleu Donald Trump Jr was committing treason... over email... over EMAIL, ya'll!		OVER EMAIL 😂😂🤣😎…
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution Yup.  And lots of people didn’t vote because so many didn’t take Trump seriously as a candidate and assumed Clinton had it. She didn’t really excite a lot of people.  If I knew then... 🤷‍♂️
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution I’m not there, so I don’t really know.  But it feels very familiar.  People problems are universal.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution I think people wanted an answer to many problems, and Brexist seemed like a victory... something that would work for them. But it was a false prophet and the EU was a scapegoat. It’s sad so much energy has been spent trying to accomplish this task and not addressing the issues.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution I understand why Brexit happened.  There are enough domestic problems with the “little people”... ya’ll want your own problems addressed first... before Greece and everything else that’s been going to sh*t in Europe.  Makes total sense.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution Bill was a good president. Hillary would have been better than trump, but I wasn’t excited about her. She has never really shown that she understands real people and struggle. I don’t have anything substantial against them. But I’ve always had a weird feeling about them.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution I blame farm subsidies from the 70s for a lot of America’s domestic problems.  But that’s the hill I chose to die on a long time ago.  🤷‍♂️
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution 2) The large areas and groups that voted for him are actually the people who now NEED the types for programs that they were resentful of propping up for so long. It’s ironic, and sad. I think the same thing is going on in the UK. People like Trump are using this to divide people.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution 1) It breaks down pretty simply. Those who voted for him liked that he was anti tax, and even that he seemed to avoid paying them. The same people felt like they had been paying too much to support programs they didn’t need. Trump used this, and riled up these feelings of blame.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution He never stops talking. But he doesn’t actually say anything.		And he is officially charged with 2 felonies.  He just hasn’t been indicted.  It’s coming.  He’s a bad criminal.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution That’s fair.  I can see that looking good if you only hear clips of what he says. He banks on the right clip getting to the right audience.   Problem is that he says all sorts of things, most of which lies, or contradict something else he said.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution Even George W Bush is looking saintly these days.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution The Obamas aren’t saints.  They’re just cool AF.  Obama did a lot that I didn’t like.  He didn’t do things I thought he should have.  And he wasn’t aggressive with the power of his office.  But he wasn’t a sleazy criminal.  I guess NOW, they look like saints.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution Maybe this time last year I would agree, but not anymore.  He is asking for it by not resigning.  He has repeatedly brought incredible shame to the US.  He has tainted the office and damaged democracy.  He also is a hate monger who has made life less safe. I feel it daily.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution For the record I do look at both sides.  One straight up propaganda, and its easy to check facts.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution This tweet from the official Whitehouse Twitter is a blatant lie.  It’s painfully blantant propaganda.  This administration DID implement that policy.  That is a fact.  And no amount of tweeting can undo reality.
@TonySocks2005 @WhiteHouse @KEK_Revolution Alrighty alright.  Let’s chill. Sorry if I didn’t get your joke... but maybe I was too harsh.  If someone is only looking at one side, it’s not fair for me to say their hopeless.  But they should definitely look up and see what is clear and evident beyond the smoke screen.

@davidorlo @dinahaddie Aww thanks.  You nailed it.  That’s the one i read that tested me up.  At age 3 my favorite movie was Grimlins (mom wasn’t the brightest), and I had to pretend to my wonderful grandmother for a decade not to break her hearts. (*grimlins has an epic monologue about Santa)
@dinahaddie On other Santa news, have you watched the Kurt Russel Santa Movie on Netflix?  😅👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

@BrewingAle @h8Wankmaggot45 @LibAthe80 @GOP I didn’t say I needed a live in nanny.  I said childcare.  An occasional babysitter.  And yes, child supervision is one of those non negotiables.
I would share everything I have to help a family get on their feet and familiar in a new place.  It would help me to have other people, and mutual support around for small stuff.  And of course I’d pay for any work outside of shared responsibilities.  That’s not racist!  😤
Being a parent is to be a housekeeper and nanny.  Mutually benefiting by sharing responsibilities, like feeding and supervising kids, is just being a good neighbor.  I wasn’t saying I want indentured servants to come live under my stairs.  🤨
I got called a racist for saying that I’d share my home with a refugee family. A family’s basic needs are universal and we can live symbiotically and help each other. I wasn’t calling for a nanny and housekeeper... and that jerk clearly doesn’t have kids.
Wait, am I not allowed to say “fuck you” on Twitter?  Well damn.  I guess I’ll have to use this platform for civil discourse with complete assholes.  Why do I bother with humans?  🤮🤬🤷‍♂️😒🧿🧩

@YNB And that post was offensive to so many other groups that they called “vaccine damaged” (which is bullshit).  But her choice comparison was horrible and absurd.  Antivaxers are willfully ignorant and make selfish decisions about who lives and dies. More like the racists and nazis.
@YNB You don’t have to have a kid to have an option here.  It’s science versus mom-blogs.  Vaccines are great, but 95% of the population has to have them to prevent outbreaks.  When this stuff gets trendy it puts babies, old people, and sick people in danger. Vaccines are amazing!

@APLMom Girls/women not wanting to report on guys to their (often) males allies in positions of power...?  I believe that’s the connotation of patriarchy in this context...
@APLMom @Anti_PC_2018 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI I hope people do not experience this behavior with the same frequency, but I know that cruel intentions adapt to their environments.
@APLMom @Anti_PC_2018 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI Same, completely. Shame cycles perpetuate a culture silent victims. And fear of repercussion for willingly drinking or being at the party prevents victims from telling their own advocates. Predators prey on these vulnerabilities.
@ShereeSwanson @MichaelAvenatti @Casselberry_PD And now I am genuinely afraid for having said so publicly.  Fear is a very real motivator for silence.  I appreciate the women who are speaking out about known unknowns. (I am also glad they have arranged security before doing so. The worst can absolutely happen.)
