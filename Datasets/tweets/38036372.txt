Several Members of Congress from both parties also weighed in on the report, BTW. The prevailing theme: More must be done to rebalance our trade relationship with China. You can check out their thoughts here: https://t.co/S0RGuOZfS1
"Millions of hard-working Americans have been sidelined by China's unfair trade practices, and also by our government's unwillingness to respond," @ScottPaulAAM said. https://t.co/S0RGuOZfS1
The team at @EconomicPolicy put together a LOT of insightful data, and it's worth a deeper dive if you have the time. https://t.co/wYXv7pxYLk But as our own @ScottPaulAAM noted, one of the main takeaways of this report is that China trade as real-life consequences.
And California saw 562,500 jobs lost during this period, the most total jobs lost of any state and the third most if you break the data down as a share of total state employment.
This data might conjure up images of rundown midwest factories, but it actually was the high-tech computer and electronic parts industry that saw the most job loss — 1.2 million jobs between 2001 to 2017, driven by Silicon Valley's love of outsourcing.
Workers directly impacted by job loss from 2001 to 2011 alone saw their incomes dwindle by $37B per year. But the wages of all non-college grads dropped by $180B a year. Jobs were sent overseas, and company profits shifted to the top of the income ladder.
"...This slowdown in manufacturing job generation also is contributing to stagnating wages and incomes of typical workers and widening inequality."

That's a wrap from today's event. Thanks for following along! We'll have a wrap-up on the blog later today.
.@ScottPaulAAM says @SenSherrodBrown "should be the North Star for Democrats on trade policy."
Ultimately, the thing that will drive the USMCA debate is how the votes come together to pass it; Members of Congress right now are staying fairly quiet. "A lot of this you don't know until the clock starts ticking, and it gets real," @ScottPaulAAM adds.
.@ScottPaulAAM notes that Democrats would be wise to bargain during USMCA negotiations to get other policy priorities passed that will benefit workers, like infrastructure investment.
Cathy Feingold says that while Democrats are more open to free trade, there needs to be a discussion with Democrats that there's a need for "a very different model" of trade agreements where labor rules are enforceable (which hasn't happened in the past).
Trade and the USMCA aren't likely to be big election issues in the upcoming midterms, @ScottPaulAAM says. But what's interesting is how the outcome of the midterms might play into whether Congress ultimately votes to pass the USMCA.
Thea Lee from @EconomicPolicy notes that polling over the years has shown people generally favor trade, but also want it to be fair (and it often isn't). So public opinion is more complicated than is often presented in the media.
Cathy Feingold (@AFLCIOGlobal) says "if you don't fix" the unfair things happening in Mexico, you can't fix what's happening in the U.S. or Canada. This isn't an us-versus-them situation — workers are all in this together.
When it comes to politics, @ScottPaulAAM says that Democrats and progressives would be wise to remind folks that they have been working on trade issues like NAFTA for 25 years, long before President Trump got involved.
A majority of likely voters also said they either support the China tariffs or want to give them more time to work. "If you dig into it, there's a lot of public support" for tougher trade action, @ScottPaulAAM adds. https://t.co/O8I6npdoPc https://t.co/a3vKgOwh9S
.@ScottPaulAAM says "there's strong agreement" that we need to get tougher on countries like China who cheat on trade (indeed, 81% of poll respondents agreed). More on that here: https://t.co/O8I6npdoPc
Our own @ScottPaulAAM is now up! Scott notes that the Mellman Group/Public Opinion Strategies poll found that while people hear President Trump talking about manufacturing, they think Congress across the board is "doing a lousy job."
Anyway, back to Molyneux, who notes that Americans "overwhelming favor ending tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs."
We'll note that a recent Mellman Group/Public Opinion Strategies poll found that Republicans are indeed more skeptical of trade (and in favor of tariffs) versus Democrats, but all voters still want to get tough on China: https://t.co/O8I6npdoPc
This suggests that President Trump is having a major effect on public opinion on trade, as Democrats were once more skeptical of trade.
Guy Molyneux from @HartSurveys says that while support for free trade fell during the 2016 election, it's now growing again. But if you break it down by party, Republican support has dipped dramatically. Democrats have been becoming more supportive free trade.
But NAFTA also allowed corporations to undermine workers, the environment and more in ways that couldn't be checked by the courts. That led to a huge uptick in advocacy and political activism, @BuildSolidarity says.
Tamara Kay (aka @BuildSolidarity) says NAFTA unexpectedly created ties between Canadian, American &amp; Mexican workers — even though it wasn't intended to do so at all.

Most Americans are willing to give the tariffs a chance, @ScottPaulAAM says, including people who otherwise dislike Trump. Voters (and workers) know the price of doing nothing and are willing to try something new.

... as 81 percent of poll respondents agreed with the statement, "We must be willing to get tough with trade restrictions on countries like China who cheat in international trade."
.... 59 percent of Hispanic voters and 58 percent of African-American voters also agreed. There's even more support for getting tough on countries like China who practice unfair trade...
... while 47 percent of those who said they would support the Democratic candidate want to keep the tariffs or give them more time to work. Meanwhile, 67 percent of white working-class votes said we should at least give the tariffs more time, while...
... 78% of poll respondents who said they plan to vote for the Republican candidate want to keep the tariffs or give them more time to work. Meanwhile, 76 percent of undecided voters agreed...

.@ScottPaulAAM says it's not appropriate to place tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada; hopefully #NAFTA negotiations will be restarted after Mexico's elections and will help quickly resolve steel &amp; aluminum issues with Canada and Mexico.
.@ScottPaulAAM says that while there will be price swings, the price of steel &amp; aluminum will eventually settle. It's important to ensure that companies don't play games in the meantime.
Meanwhile, we should invest in our infrastructure and strengthen workforce training to further strengthen American manufacturing. But doing so without also enforcing our trade laws will make those efforts less effective.
The economy is strong, and these tariffs are very limited in terms of how big our economy is, so they can be an effective tool in protecting our critical steel &amp; aluminum industry and ensuring we can supply our military and critical infrastructure.
The Section 232 action has had positive results thus far. Two blast furnaces are coming back online in Granite City, Ill., for example, and plants are coming back online across America. Meanwhile, manufacturing job growth remains very strong.
Keep in mind that China has effectively gotten around targeted dumping orders by shipping its steel through countries like Vietnam, @ScottPaulAAM notes. That's why enforcement measures must now go beyond China.
Unfortunately, years of dialogue with China have been largely ineffective. (Note: Check out this @steelworkers report for more on that: https://t.co/FflWlMSmw0.) That is why relief is now critical.
Now we are facing a situation where we need to defend our steel &amp; aluminum to ensure we can build things like aircraft carriers, submarines &amp; more (along with infrastructure). Steel &amp; aluminum are threatened by China's massive overcapacity, which it dumps all over the world.
Our current trade enforcement tools are weak and expensive. The burden is placed on workers and companies to react; the current set of tools are not proactive at all. It's an uphill battle to fight unfair trade practices.
Scott notes that the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 did three things: It gave the president broad authority to pursue trade expansion; included trade adjustment assistance for workers who are laid off b/c of trade; &amp; created trade enforcement, which is where Section 232 comes in.
Our President @ScottPaulAAM is taking part in a discussion organized by the Global Business Dialogue on all things tariffs, national security and the World Trade Organization. You can watch on #CSPAN2 or follow along here.

ICYMI, here's Scott's appearance on CNBC: https://t.co/Ow3N302AIT
There are jobs out there, @ScottPaulAAM says -- but what's missing right now is good-paying, family-supporting middle class jobs. Manufacturing growth can play a big role in helping close that gap.
The fact that #Foxconn is building this factory, and Tesla is building its massive gigafactory in Nevada, shows that there is a future for large scale manufacturing in the United States, @ScottPaulAAM says. Now need the right policy to support it.

Final thought from @ScottPaulAAM: "We need a smart and strategic approach going forward... there needs to be this disruption, b/c there has been this imbalance." Trump is wrong that trade wars are "easy to win," but tariffs can be effective in helping to rebalance trade.
Back to steel (again)! Remember: China is at the heart of the global problem. China's steel industry is subsidized by its govt., makes far too much steel and floods the global marketplace, with the aim of putting makers across the globe out of business, @ScottPaulAAM says.
.@ScottPaulAAM points out he's wearing a Brooks Brothers tie that's #MadeinNY. Trump is hypocritical by not bringing his own manufacturing, or at least part of it, back to the United States, he adds.
On #NAFTA: It's going to take time for the three countries to work on some tough issues, @ScottPaulAAM says. But it's important that we get a new deal done, he adds, and one that is more beneficial to workers than what we have now.
China is a state-led industry that doesn't abide by a free market, @ScottPaulAAM says. That's had a massive effect on the global marketplace &amp; requires action on trade beyond simple negotiations.
It would be a mistake to mandate that the president get approval from Congress to implement Section 232 tariffs, @ScottPaulAAM says. He shared his thoughts on this topic earlier this week: https://t.co/8lTf7hmc18
Back to steel! @ScottPaulAAM notes there are legitimate national security concerns about steel and aluminum. There's just one U.S. manufacturer who can make the high purity aluminum needed for fighter jets, for example.
There is a legitimate concern about the amount of pharmaceutical manufacturing happening in China, @ScottPaulAAM says. (Rosemary Gibson just put out a book on this topic, btw: https://t.co/s04xjijeFj)
.@ScottPaulAAM says he disagrees with the approach President Trump has taken with our traditional allies on some of his recent trade actions, but notes an overall realignment in the global steel industry is a long time coming.
And it's important to note that when a domestic manufacturer needs to import steel because it's not manufactured here in the United States, there are exemptions to the tariffs, @ScottPaulAAM says.
Average consumers are unlikely to see much of any impact from the steel and aluminum tariffs, @ScottPaulAAM says. But what they have done is help secure domestic industry (and bring back jobs).
"I don't expect much," @ScottPaulAAM says of the #G7Summit. But one thing all parties should agree on is the need to confront China. "I don't know if they are going to be able to pivot," he notes, given the current rhetoric.

"An aggressive trade posture can work. It has to be smart and it can't be permanent, but it has to be part of the arsenal," @ScottPaulAAM says.
"I think we have to take a really aggressive stand with them," Neil Hare says of China, particularly on IP theft and related issues. "Why are we letting China dictate to us?"
Manufacturing jobs held steady and held with business cycles through the late '90s. They dropped off when China entered WTO in 2001, @ScottPaulAAM says. "We can manage automation," he says. "But we have to get the [trade] rules right."
China's state-owned steel companies are completely distorting the global market, @ScottPaulAAM says. It's unsustainable, and we can no longer stand back and let China call the shots like this.
The United States has done a good job expanding trade but a terrible job of enforcing its trade laws, says @ScottPaulAAM. That's why there is current pushback against trade in general.
China has been breaking the rules for years, notes Neil Hare. It's a problem we no longer can ignore.

That's a wrap from today's hearing. We'll have a wrap-up over on the blog later today.
.@RepJasonSmith notes that China has placed 19,000 tariffs on American products. "We want to be good trade partners and good neighbors but we want to be treated fairly," he says, adding: "Let's look at the Chinese."
Paul adds that China desperately wants to be treated as a market economy — but is clearly NOT a market economy. It shouldn't be treated as such, and we should stop taking China at its word when it promises to do things like open its market.
.@ScottPaulAAM notes that China has made a number of promises on things like intellectual property theft and market access. China has repeatedly broken those promises, and there need to be consequences.
AK Steel's Roger Newport notes his company is the last American maker of the specialty steel needed to build the power grid. If we lose that ability, that's a national security risk, since foreign producers might not be able to supply the grid in a major crisis.
The boats coming in from China are much heavier than those going out, Paul adds. We need to implement policies that help create more balance.
Small businesses can benefit from exports, @ScottPaulAAM says. "I'd like to see it grow even further," he says, adding that we should ensure we have a level playing field &amp; increased market access in China.
"None of us want Beijing calling the shots in the American economy," @ScottPaulAAM adds.
Manufacturing still plays an out sized role in the economy, @ScottPaulAAM says. There's a 13% pay premium — and a factory provides a major boost to a local economy, creating more jobs &amp; supporting local businesses.
It is American workers who have suffered by China's failure to fix its overcapacity problem, Paul adds. Tens of thousands have faced layoffs &amp; dozens of plants have closed.
.@ScottPaulAAM says the global forum on steel overcapacity has been helpful in putting focus on issues at stake. But the process has been slow. The "greater issue" is China has admitted it makes too much steel &amp; promised to address it. China has broken those promises, repeatedly.
Roger Newport of AK Steel notes the U.S. undertook targeted action on specific steel products, often from China, for many years. But China found a way around that approach. Hence, a more comprehensive solution is now necessary.
.@ScottPaulAAM tells @repjohnlewis it is "critical" the U.S. works w/ allies to address global trade issues like steel overcapacity. The recent agreement w/ South Korea is an example of where we are making progress in re-balancing a trade relationship &amp; addressing overcapacity.
Levin adds that it's difficult to reach an effective global solution on unfair trade issues like these without the threat of tariffs. "We've been engaging for years" with allies &amp; the Chinese without any results, he points out. Tougher action now needed.
.@repsandylevin notes after China entered the WTO in 2001, it didn't open its market but instead doubled-down on its government intervention policies. The U.S. failed to properly respond, and now "these chickens have come home to roost."
.@ScottPaulAAM says that China's market distorting behavior impacts the entire global market. We need our trade partners to step up and essentially "quarantine" China when it comes to unfair trade practices. "It's going to take a dramatic effort," Paul adds.
But it's vital that the U.S. "shouldn’t be afraid to enforce trade laws," Paul says. "We have the leverage to do so. If China won’t play by the rules, it should lose some of its access to our market," he adds.
The way Trump "is delivering tariffs is far from perfect," Paul says. The administration waited too long to conclude Section 232 process. Steel imports soared over 15% in 2017; mixed signals on timing, scope, and applicability put more emphasis on tactics than on strategy.
Manufacturing "contributed a whopping 21 percent of all private sector job growth last month when the tariffs kicked in, and employment in metals-consuming industries rose substantially," Paul says.
Paul continues: "If a negotiated solution with specific disciplines and automatic enforcement provisions can be agreed to, then, and only then, should we look at lifting tariffs. Otherwise, we would be abandoning the best leverage we’ve had in years."
"Withdrawing the threat of tariffs without achieving results would be tantamount to waving the white flag of trade surrender – signaling to China and other trade cheats that there will be no consequences for predatory trade behaviors," Paul says.
.@ScottPaulAAM is now up, telling committee members that "there's no disagreement that China cheats" which is why tariffs are on the table.
"No industry is immune" from China's trade cheating, Newport adds. "We must fight back to make American manufacturers stronger."
"Reality is, China has been fighting to take out the American steel industry for years," Newport says.
Roger Newport, CEO of AK Steel, says the domestic steel industry has been fighting unfair trade by countries like China through targeted, individual trade cases for years, but the overall overcapacity crisis continued. That's why broader action is now needed.
Committee ranking member @RepRichardNeal says steel &amp; aluminum industries "have been seriously hurt" by global overcapacity. "It's no secret" that China is behind this crisis, he adds.
"The world, not just the U.S., must stand up to China's unfair trade practices," Brady says, later adding that "it is in everyone's best interest to find a path forward when it comes to fair trade."
Committee Chairman @RepKevinBrady isn't fond of tariffs, to put it lightly. But he notes in his opening remarks that trade enforcement is important — and so is taking on China's continued "unfair trade practices."

That's a wrap from this year's #steelcaucus briefing. We'll have a full wrap-up on the blog later today. Up next on Capitol Hill: @USTradeRep Robert Lighthizer will testify before the House Ways and Means Committee at 10 am ET. You can watch here: https://t.co/pBODC6LnEb
China is shutting down capacity of steel mills that can't meet market needs BUT are opening up new mills, John Ferriola says. "So we're actually losing ground," he adds.
It's hard to do PR about the good things going on in the American steel industry when so many companies "are so focused on survival because of the cheating that's taking place, " John Ferriola of @NucorCorp adds.
"If we have a level playing field we can beat anybody, but we can't beat cheaters," Gerard of the @steelworkers adds. Trade enforcement is vital.
America's steel industry met the Kyoto Protocol years ago (China's steel industry still hasn't done it), Leo Gerard adds.
Leo Gerard of @steelworkers says calling the industrial heartland the "Rust Belt" is an insult. America's steel mills are high-tech and the most efficient in the world. "This is an industry that's scientifically designed," he says. "It's more than sparks and flash and fire."
.@RepMarcyKaptur, a longtime advocate for steel, notes the tech industry has an image, agriculture has an image, and that helps them succeed. But the steel industry "has to fight for its life every time an issue comes up." She also criticizes media coverage of the 232 action.
John Ferriola of @NucorCorp tells the #steelcaucus that the steel industry doesn't just employ its workers directly. It supports economic growth in entire communities -- restaurants, shops, hotels. Loss of industry can be devastating, but industry growth is hugely uplifting.

Brig. Gen. John Adams says it's vital that the U.S. takes a broader view of what national security is -- it includes things like the electrical grid. It also includes research &amp; development of key materials like steel.
Worth noting: One of the Members of Congress attending today's #steelcaucus is new Rep. @ConorLambPA. He supported the steel action during his recent campaign.
Brig. Gen. John Adams argues that China is being very strategic when it comes to steel -- it looks at what we need for our national security and says, "let's take it down." That's why the United States must act to defend strategic industries like steel.
RT @aisisteel: A call for bipartisanship from @RepRickCrawford on protecting our national security interests and domestic steel industry sa…
.@RepRickCrawford stresses the importance of steel to our national security, dismissing opponents who say that maintaining domestic production isn't necessary. He says steel is critical to our national interest and must be maintained.
Roger Newport of AK Steel notes that while individual trade cases on specific products can help for a brief period, ultimately the larger global crisis remains unaddressed. Leo Gerard of @steelworkers adds that "remedies are short-lived." It's like playing whack-a-mole.
RT @aisisteel: All speakers have given their testimony and Q&amp;A is beginning. 		If you missed any testimony, you can read all speakers state…
Onto questions. Todd Young of @U_S_Steel tells the caucus that the company made the decision to restart operations in Granite City as a direct result of the 232 action.
Once we lose our core steel making capabilities, it will be gone, Adams notes. We simply cannot let that happen.
"It's a myth" that American-made steel will always be available for key defense needs like this, Adams says. It's vital the domestic industry remain strong so it will be there in another crisis, he adds.
During his service in the Iraq war, Adams saw how important steel was to the safety of his troops when American steel producers dropped everything to supply the steel needed for armored plate. Do we want to hand this capability over to China or Russia?
The final speaker today is Brig. Gen. John Adams (U.S. Army-Ret.), who calls the domestic steel industry "vital" to America's national security. "We can never mortgage this capacity, especially to our strategic competitors," he says.
Young points out the national security importance of steel: In a crisis, the United States needs to know that it can immediately source its steel here at home, not be waiting on it to cross an open ocean.
It's not just those 500 jobs, either, Young adds. The entire community in Granite City will see economic growth, from restaurants to the local shoe store.
Young adds that @U_S_Steel mines, melts and makes its products in the United States. Imports hurt its operations, leading to layoffs &amp; plant closures. But the company fought through and is now reopening its blast furnace in Granite City. About 500 workers will be rehired.
Todd Young from @U_S_Steel says "the American steel industry is beginning to see a level playing field" because of President Trump's action on steel imports. "National security is only as strong as American steel," he adds.
Now up: Tony Frabotta, the vice chairman of the Committee of Pipe and Tube Imports. He highlights problem of imports from South Korea, which has no domestic market for these products. South Korea's industry exists solely to send its (dumped) products to the United States.
RT @aisisteel: "As a result of the Section 232 action, @ArcelorMittalUS will be looking for opportunities to maximize our steel production…
...@ArcelorMittalUS is committed to investment and increasing its productivity. That's part of its mission. But it's impossible to compete against years of unfair trade... and that's when job losses happen. It's unfair trade, not automation or productivity, that leads to layoffs.

Millett notes that several trade actions were taken to address dumping of specific steel products from China. Unfortunately, that didn't solve the larger overcapacity problem -- which is why more comprehensive action is now necessary.
Mark Millett of Steel Dynamics, Inc., is now up. "We're optimistic that the 232 remedy will provide a level playing field for U.S. producers," he says. "We look forward to the measures going into effect for a period of sufficient duration."   #steelcaucus

For too long, America's defense industrial base has suffered because of unfair trade, Gerard adds. "Our union is not looking for special treatment. What we're looking for is a level playing field," he adds. #steelcaucus
While China is the top offender, many countries are contributing to global overcapacity, Gerard notes. #steelcaucus
"These aren't just numbers. These are in fact real people, these are people whose lives are being improved," Gerard of the @steelworkers adds. #SteelCaucus
.@Steelworkers President Leo Gerard is now up. He notes almost 3,000 new jobs have been announced since President Trump's action on steel/aluminum imports, adds more investments &amp; job announcements are expected.
This loophole is a threat to national security, because this steel is a key component of the electrical grid, Newport notes. #SteelCaucus
Next up: Roger Newport from AK Steel, who tells the caucus "there's an unintended loophole" in the 232 steel action -- electrical steel, specifically its use in transformer industry and supply chain. AK Steel is the only producer of this steel in the US.

Along with advocating for trade enforcement, Ferriola also calls for significant infrastructure investment with strong Buy America provisions, which will further spur economic growth and create new jobs.
Ferriola notes Nucor has invested heavily in its U.S. operations and is creating new jobs. "The president's action will allow us to realize a return in our investments &amp; will help our industry get back on a sustainable path."
John Ferriola from @NucorCorp says "the president got it right" on steel tariffs, notes that global overcapacity caused a surge of imports into U.S. market, &amp; @CommerceGov "rightly concluded" these imports pose threat to national defense.
Among those testifying at the #SteelCaucus hearing: @steelworkers President Leo Gerard; John Ferriola; Chairman, President &amp; CEO, @NucorCorp; David Burritt; President and CEO, @U_S_Steel; Roger Newport; CEO, AK Steel Corporation; &amp; John Brett; President and CEO, @ArcelorMittalUS.
