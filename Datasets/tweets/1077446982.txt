Since 1997, Congress has failed to do its job to maintain a fiscally responsible budget. Time and time again, we have relied on raising the debt ceiling, and just recently, our national debt hit a record $22 TRILLION.

I fully support @POTUS‚Äô efforts to secure the border - including using an emergency declaration - following the clear intentions of the Democrats to simply kick the can down the road and play politics with the safety of Americans.
While there are concerns about money being taken away from much needed barrack renovations at @forthood, Acting Defense Sec Shanahan‚Äôs recent comments that military housing will not be touched is an important step &amp; I‚Äôll continue to push the issue to make sure this is the case.
As I have said many times, the need for an emergency declaration is the result of Congress failing to pass legislation that adequately secures our border.

The threats to our nation are real, and I will continue to oppose legislation that does not provide for more border agents, technology, and where necessary a physical barrier along our southern border.
It is time for Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer to finally negotiate in good faith, and stop holding federal workers hostage with their partisan agenda.
Democrats offered the American people a better way, but their first month in office has demonstrated nothing more than an unwillingness to work across the aisle.
Continuing resolutions are simply a stopgap - kicking the can on critical issues like the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.
Predictably, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer allowed their hatred for President Trump to supersede their responsibility to protect our sovereignty.

From his time serving in World War II, to serving his local community in #TX25, he was a true patriot through and through. I am humbled to introduce the House resolution that will honor the incredible life of Richard Overton and his service to the United States.
Richard Overton embodied everything that is wonderful about America; integrity, courage and hard work. He was a dear friend who I had the privilege of knowing for the past six years and I miss him dearly.		https://t.co/pMChnfmY1c https://t.co/vVE9uT8MM0

@RobWentland Recently? Enough to pass the House in December before the shutdown
@JohnHug18009845 Thanks for your support!
@Barbara_Ann_M Very true!
@RobWentland @HouseGOP @POTUS The Senate needed 60 votes to pass and there are not 60 Republicans in the Senate.
@4TheCommonMen @HouseGOP @POTUS As I've said many times before, the Senate needed 60 votes to pass this. Unfortunately, there were not 60 Republicans in the Senate. They needed a few Democrats on board to pass
@clydebennett @HouseGOP @POTUS Yes, I remember hearing about it in 2013, under Obama, when 54 Senate Democrats voted for $40 BILLION in border security to double the length of a new border fence with Mexico
.@HouseGOP is committed to ending the humanitarian &amp; security crisis at the border while Nancy Pelosi refuses to negotiate. Dems have supported &amp; voted in favor of #bordersecurity in the past but are now putting politics before good policy because they refuse to work with @POTUS
@tmartatx @HouseGOP The Senate needed 60 votes to pass and they didn't have 60 Republicans seated in the Senate.
Thinking of all the brave men and women who wake up every day to selflessly protect this great nation. Each of you is vital to the safety of American citizens, and I thank you for your hard work and dedication. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay https://t.co/kPqBQxZcLn
@junebug3122 Great question - I'd like to know the reason as well.
@tmartatx @HouseGOP While the House kept our promise, the Senate needed 60 votes total to pass this vote. They did not and do not have 60 Republicans to pass it alone
@kevwprice @HouseGOP While the House voted to fund the wall, the Senate needed at least 10 Democrats on board for it to pass (60 votes total)
As long as Nancy and Chuck are recklessly leading the left it appears they'll continue prioritizing illegal immigrants over US citizens. @HouseGOP is committed to re-opening the govt while also securing our border ‚Äì it's past time for our friends across the aisle to get on board.
The crisis at the border has gone unchecked for far too long &amp; @POTUS sent a clear message that he won't stop fighting for the safety of Americans. He is asking Congress to uphold the Oath of Office we took last week &amp; to do what we promised by serving &amp; protecting this nation.
RT @GOPLeader: There is a humanitarian crisis happening along our Southern border. It‚Äôs long past time we do something about it.
@TommieM99313448 @PARISDENNARD @POTUS Even when Republicans had majority in the House and Senate, there were not enough Republicans in the Senate to pass it. We would've needed at least 10 Democrats on board
@jayphoward @POTUS Currently, under this President, they have no interest in keeping the country safe and would rather put American lives in danger than vote for anything that supports @POTUS' agenda
In 2013, under Obama, 54 Senate D's voted to:		- Spend $40B on border security	- Double the length of a new border fence	- Double the number of border agents		What changed...? Dems are blatantly opposing anything @POTUS supports, including measures they've supported in the past.
@jayphoward It's apparent time and time again that the left is choosing to prioritize illegal immigrants over the safety of American families
By advocating for legislation that doesn't include the funding we need for appropriate #bordersecurity, Democrats have made it clear that they have no interest in ending this shutdown or keeping the country safe.

Earlier this week, @HouseDemocrats showed their true colors &amp; refused to stand up for American nat'l security.  I have &amp; always will support the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives for this nation, which is why I voted to support @ICEgov 		https://t.co/gQugeqVqLZ
Baseball took center stage during pivotal time in our country's history, which is why I am proud to introduce the Integration of Baseball Commemorative Coin Act with @RepRichmond in the House and @SenatorTimScott in the Senate.		https://t.co/6oVxsUbMTW https://t.co/DcSNTiy1bQ
At a time when integration was considered ambitious and unachievable, baseball led the way by bringing together Americans from all different backgrounds ‚Äì celebrating their love of the game.
Baseball's impact on our country is best exemplified by Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson. In 1947, he changed this game forever when he stepped out on Ebbets Field to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Baseball has always been America‚Äôs game. Growing up as a baseball player has shaped who I am as a person on and off the field ‚Äì I know it takes hard work and perseverance to achieve anything worthwhile.

@fannishcandish We need to encourage those seeking asylum to go through the legal ports of entry
America is a compassionate nation, and those wishing to have a piece of the American Dream should be willing to start by following our laws. It‚Äôs time to finally pass legislation that makes our country safer and stronger, and that starts with securing our borders.

@kenshetter @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats I wish it was as simple as that. However, just take a look at when the government shutdown earlier this year. We couldn't get the Dems on board and we didn't have enough votes. . Even with a majority, we cannot pass everything alone.
@dpbullseye DOJ is enforcing the laws that are in place right now. My colleagues and I desperately want to change the immigration system but we cannot do it without Democrats on board
@kenshetter @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn I don't like children being separated from their parents anymore than you do, Mayor. @HouseGOP has tried to pass immigration reforms that @HouseDemocrats keep voting against. We can't change how the border is run without new legislation.
@joolytron @JulieForTX25 By definition, illegal immigrants are criminals. @HHSGov is working hard to find a parent, relative or foster home to care for these children. @HouseDemocrats have repeatedly shot down immigration reform attempts that would fix the separation of children from their parents
@drnunesSEU @HouseDemocrats Additionally,  @HHSGov provides medical care &amp; edu services to these children. They are provided a temporary shelter and HHS works hard to find a parent, relative, or foster home to care for these children. If @HouseDemocrats would work with us, we could pass new immigration laws
@drnunesSEU .@HouseDemocrats repeatedly vote against commonsense fixes to our immigration system that would fix this the separation of families. The currently legislation is not good. We need to pass immigration laws that keep Americans safe.

After three days of a senseless government shutdown, the Democrats gained nothing but the disappointment of the American people. This reckless stunt was an act of political grandstanding from the left at the expense of our servicemen and women		https://t.co/yKmFJY7opN https://t.co/j2Tshsvj5s

@hedgecock_laura To a child who has a deployed parent, they are already going through enough at a young age. For some, recreational activities may be their only chance to focus on them and not everything happening in the world that makes life difficult
Commissaries/exchanges on base for families are closed/operating w/ limited hrs. For those w/ a fixed income, the commissaries &amp; exchanges are a critically important. While the uncertainty of their next paycheck looms, these families shouldn't have these resources shuttered
Prepaid activities for military children have been canceled. A military parent should not have to explain to their children that their recreational activities on the base have been cancelled, because the Federal Government closed their gymnasium
Military personnel continue to work with no pay &amp; no guarantee of retroactive pay. Their families make enormous sacrifices each &amp; every day; they should not face further uncertainty over whether their next paycheck will arrive, or if the resources they rely upon will be available

All this was great, but has likely been forgotten/replaced. While it‚Äôs important to remember our past, it‚Äôs crucial to improve our future
Lastly, President Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in to law
The Mets won the World Series
The world‚Äôs first disposable camera was invented
The Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots
Top Gun was the highest grossing film of the year with $8mil - the highest grossing film now is Beauty &amp; the Beast, which made $504,017,165
The average cost of a new home in the U.S. was $104,100 - it is now $361,800
Pixar Animation Studios launched, and has since created 18 films
Mike Tyson won his first ever boxing title and became the youngest heavyweight champion in the world
The Oprah Winfrey Show aired for the first time
Let‚Äôs take a look back to remind ourselves why we should not be living with a tax plan that was created at the same time as the following:
Unfortunately, #taxreform didn't keep up w/ the times. It's outdated &amp; our current plan is holding the US back from economic growth
It‚Äôs hard to believe 1986 was already 31 years ago. Some great things happened that year, but we‚Äôve made some real progress since then‚Ä¶
It was humbling to watch these heroes be recognized for their bravery. Zack and I will forever be grateful for their valor on June 14, 2017

#JumpstartAmerica is smart and bold, and offers an authentic business perspective, which is exactly what this economy needs.
Full &amp; Immediate Expensing: capital investment encourages economic growth &amp; creates more jobs with higher wages
Inheritance Tax: the federal government should not punish those who pass their family business, or life savings onto their loved ones
Alternative Minimum Tax: repeal the AMT. This makes our current tax code even more complicated
The US must be a model for creating a competitive free market system ‚Äì free of a tax code that discourages growth
Corporate Tax Rate: lowered to 20%. Lower taxes encourage economic growth &amp; create good-paying jobs
Focus needs to be on relief for the lower and middle class, and creating economic opportunities for their future
Personal Tax Brackets: We need to simplify the code by reducing to three tax brackets
We need to jumpstart this economy. Here‚Äôs my plan ‚Üí a business perspective on true #taxreform called, #JumpstartAmerica
It‚Äôs way past time for real change in Washington, and we need to give the American people real #taxreform

Instead, we are increasing the debt ceiling which is yet another Washington ploy that favors personal gain &amp; ignores the needs of our nation
We were each sent up to Washington to make smart, fiscally-conservative change that benefits all Americans.
Raising the debt ceiling is nothing but a diversion that provides a temporary fix to an undeniable problem.
As history shows us, having the attitude of, ‚Äòwe‚Äôll deal with it later,‚Äô does not work.
I hope every Member considers the lasting implications of what happens when we increase the annual debt ceiling w/o reducing fed spending
We shouldn't continue to ignore the fed govt‚Äôs senseless spending habits that leave our future generations to deal with ancestral debt.
My House &amp; Senate colleagues can do better than hitching separate issues to one another in order to further their own political agenda.
Texans and the American people deserve better than this.
My colleagues from both sides are willing to hold emergency aid funding hostage to the impending debt ceiling increase as well as a CR.
I strongly support the need for immediate disaster relief and am disappointed by Congress that this will not be a "clean" bill
With less than 30 days left in the FY, there is a sense of urgency in Congress to provide proper aid to those affected by Hurricane Harvey

Without a reliable monetary policy strategy, productivity will continue to fall short of potential
The economy simply isn't working for tens of millions of working Americans
Working families are living with the consequences of top-down policies from DC, which have contributed to the weakest of economic recoveries
The method in which the Fed manages interest rate policy has left households/businesses in a policy fog
Even if Fed remittances represented real revenue/followed conventional monetary policy, they do little to address growing debt obligations
The Fed continues to finance its outsized balance sheet by paying above-market interest to the world‚Äôs largest banks
The Fed‚Äôs monetary policy allowed the Obama Administration to mask budget spending reforms and compromise the Fed‚Äôs independence
(2/2) and how it can facilitate an orderly return to a conventional balance sheet.

Obama, Clinton and now Secretary Kerry have duped the American people while the international community just sits back and laughs
For 7 years and study after study, the Obama Administration has failed to offer any evidence to support their opposition to #KeystoneXL
Ironically, this small group of far left environmentalists are opposed to the safest and most secure means of transporting oil #KeystoneXL
Instead of focusing on jobcreation &amp; energy indep. for the good of our nation, Obama is pandering to smallgroup of farleft environmentalists
Oil is cheapest &amp; most reliable form of energy. It will be bought &amp; used whether or not the WH wants to take a fabricated moral high ground
I'll join @lynnwoolley at 10:34am CT/ 11:34AM ET to discuss Speaker Paul Ryan and the Budget Deal. You can tune in https://t.co/4xzsa2CbdP
Together, we will mourn this day, and together, we will honor the memories of those brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice
