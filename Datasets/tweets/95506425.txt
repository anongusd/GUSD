And why might this be a wave election? Indicators such as Trump‚Äôs low approval rating and Democratic candidates‚Äô "unprecedented" fundraising numbers suggest Democrats could win much more than the 218 needed for majority control. https://t.co/1Sdc9eO9YP
Could the Senate flip? That‚Äôs a steeper challenge for Democrats. To win control, they‚Äôd need to retain almost all of their current seats that are being contested.
How strong a chance do Democrats have? They‚Äôre better-positioned to win control of the House than the Senate. Many expect they will win enough seats to regain control of the House.
How big an advantage are Republicans defending? At the moment, they hold a 235-to-193 majority in the House (where seven seats are vacant) and a 51-to-49 edge in the Senate.
When will we know the results? It depends on how quickly votes are counted and how close the races are. Some key Senate races are in western states, so results may take until Wednesday, while close races could require recounts. https://t.co/mnTcEt7KoK
