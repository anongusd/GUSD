Both @SGottliebFDA and I have said many times that e-cigs/ vaping may (under right circumstances) serve as harm reduction for   currently smoking adults, but can’t be declared harmless for never smokers, and definitely present a real risk for our kids.  #noEcigs4kids
Study authors (Respiratory Society of Europe) conclude: The long-term effects of ECIG use are unknown, and there is therefore no evidence that ECIGs are safer than tobacco in the long term. Based on current knowledge, negative health effects cannot be ruled out.”
Interesting article frm Europe (which leans more ecig/ vape friendly than US). “There is not enough scientific evidence to support Ecigs as an aid to smoking cessation due to a lack of controlled trials, including those that compare ECIGs with licenced stop-smoking treatments.” https://t.co/OjeGTK61Fd
@acmtilim “According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.”	https://t.co/9uST2thggJ
Lots of passion on this issue, so let’s hit the reset button. As a parent, I hope we can all agree we should strive to limit non medical youth use of and fetal exposure to marijuana products. I think we should prioritize doing no harm to most vulnerable. That’s my top concern.
@sham_ON_you It was truly my pleasure- you are an amazing person and advocate.  Tell your mother I said hi! 👋🏽
@GaryAGibson Hi Gary!  Thanks for being such an amazing #sicklecell advocate!
DYK: Despite what many think, most people (&gt;9/10 across US) believe in vaccinations and get their kids vaccinated?

Study acknowledges variation in product risk, but reinforces concerns over any nicotine exposure during pregnancy - even from e-cigarettes. If you are a smoker who is pregnant or thinking about it, talk to your doctor about how to best protect your baby! #noEcigs4babies 👶🏿👶🏻👶🏽
IMPT POINT: Study assessed reasons for use, &amp; about 40% said they used around pregnancy because they thought it might help them quit, BUT exclusive e-cigarette use did not change during period, suggesting no transition from combustibles to e-cigarettes among these women.
ICYMI: ⁦@CDCgov⁩ ⁦⁦@CDCMMWR⁩ from yesterday’s ecigs &amp; vaping during pregnancy.  Science shows a link between nicotine exposure and fetal toxicity, so experts encourage avoiding all nicotine exposure during periods of developmental vulnerability. https://t.co/xGagAbJ9R9

@SLandP @AOBempah @renee_m_johnson @LeoBeletsky @NORML @JulieKJohnson @PaculaRosalie @DrugPolicyOrg Mr. Berman, the belief that legalization may lead to lower arrests for some (again must caution against hyperbole) doesn’t mean it is the only or best way to get to social justice for most/ all, and definitely doesn’t mean there won’t be unintended health/ societal consequences.

@BradRodu @CDCTobaccoFree My interpretation of your graph is many different variables affect initiation, and youth seeing Celebs smoke in movies is just one. Fortunately there have been other variables driving ⬇️ smoking over the years, but maybe we’d be at even lower rates if not for movies highlighting.
@BradRodu @CDCTobaccoFree Dr Rodu, so are you suggesting movie/ product placement doesn’t work at all?  Or that somehow cigarettes are fundamentally different than all other products companies pay millions to have promoted in movies?
5/5 Reality Check, which has made confronting on-screen tobacco promotion a part of its public health mission since 2003, is joining groups around the country using the #HelpOscarQuit hashtag to ask big media companies to keep smoking out of the movies kids see most.
4/5 "Even biographical movies are packed with exaggerated smoking. Extras smoking and fictional characters added to these films outnumber the actual, historical smokers by 5 to 1 this year. That's not authentic, and exploits young and pushes kids toward the tobacco industry."
3/5 "Even the US Surgeon General has said movies with smoking cause kids to smoke in real life," said Skyler Camp, 14, from Morrisville. "Also state attorneys general have told the movie studios that every time they release a movie with smoking, they knowingly harm children.”
2/5 Together, this year's crop of Oscar-nominated movies have delivered 7.5 billion tobacco exposures to domestic moviegoers, according to researchers at UCSF, with billions more to come when the films debut on the nation's on-demand and streaming services. 😲
1/5 Its #Oscars time, so this Sunday Spotlight is all about the movies 🎥 	-&gt; Congress took cigarette commercials off tv 50 years ago but tobacco is still a presence in movies. During awards season studios go all out to promote some of the smokiest movies. https://t.co/fjVeqVEM4h
@BeeCeeGeez @NORML @samhsagov Meaning the youth use data. Crime data is available on state law enforcement websites.
@BeeCeeGeez @NORML Publicly available on @samhsagov website.  2018 NSDUH data.
@NORML Number of arrests 2-3x the pre-legalization numbers in DC and other places. So from a social justice point of view, there are scores  more people of color being arrested than ever before. But because some of them are getting lighter sentences you consider that a net win? 🤷🏾‍♂️
@SputnikMonroe2 @SecAzar @POTUS @HHS_ASH @samhsagov Nate, I agree, facts ARE important. So here’s a VERY important point -&gt; NSDUH data clearly shows underage use increased in states that legalized marijuana, both for medical and adult use. Wr can’t ignore youth trends.
@RawDawg0409 @SecAzar @POTUS @HHS_ASH @samhsagov What folks don’t realize is this ain’t the marijuana you and your friends smoked in college. Today’s marijuana has much higher THC to CBD ratio (ie more of the bad stuff and less of the potentially good), and is likely therefore much more dangerous. 🍎 vs 🍊
@valor_club @SecAzar @POTUS @HHS_ASH @samhsagov We have already done it.  There’s a surgeon generals warning label on the side of many bottles.  And NOT or, when it comes to addressing all types of substance misuse in kids and pregnant women.
@NORML DYK that in most states that have legalized adult use of marijuana, arrests of people of color have actually increased?  Social justice is important to address, but also important we evaluate actual outcomes and not assume legalization automatically = social justice.

@DanBoon63784314 Dan, I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Let me be clear- I would NEVER advocate for people’s pain to not be treated.  The truth is, opioids are best choice for some, but generally, people (and society) actually fare better when providers practice opioid sparing regimens.
@HilaryKimMorden @tcoylecanoe Sorry but that’s a false choice (ie give me opioids or ignore my pain). We can treat your pain as well or in many cases BETTER with an opioid sparing regimen. Better pain control AND fewer opioids floating around?  Now that’s truly a choice we can all live with, &amp; should support.

7/7 A comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic must consider all of the settings in which these drugs are overused. For many patients, the most important setting is after (or before) they have an operation.
6/7 The good news is that reducing surgical opioid use need not compromise patients’ quality of care.  Patients and surgeons have many tools to choose from, and the time for such discussions is before an operation.
5/7 This reservoir of opioids creates challenges, including difficulties around safe storage, disposal and potential diversion to family and friends. Note-&gt; To locate a drug take back site near you, go to https://t.co/IvEvc5rrrF
4/7 It would be one thing if such patients fared well, and if the scientific evidence supported such use. But in fact, there is scant evidence for the safety or effectiveness of opioid use for chronic post-operative pain.
3/7  By early 2000s clinical teaching suggested the risks of addiction or misuse from opioids had been overblown. The best case for enthusiastic use of opioids was often surgery. Clinicians were eager to take away the “organic” pain they had just created in the operating room.
2/7 With as many as 10 percent of patients still using opioids a year after surgery, chronic opioid use has become one of the most common and serious long-term risks of undergoing an operation. @ASALifeline @AmerMedicalAssn @AmCollSurgeons
1/7 Sunday Spotlight: Important read before surgery-&gt; No one goes into an operation hoping to be on opioids a year later. But too often, opioids are excessively prescribed. Up to 75% of patients, if not more, after surgery have leftover painkillers. https://t.co/Wc37TH9Dvs
@politiwars Interestingly enough for that “US spends more than any other country on healthcare” stat- if you add in social and community supports, other countries spend as much as US - but get better outcomes because they are prioritizing and funding prevention as well as treatment.
Many healthcare organizations, and some really innovative companies/ employers are seeing the ROI of addressing the upstream “social determinants” (ie where we live learn work and play) as well as providing  better, more convenient care, w less burdens.
Dr. Bauchner rightly points out the benefits of going after administrative burdens, but approach must be AND not OR, and we must better balance our focus and resources between the 10% downstream and the 90% upstream.
This will also help address provider burnout, because fewer sick and repeat patients with preventable/ avoidable visits means more time to spend with the ones who really need it, and better outcomes and patient (and provider) satisfaction.
I laid out the argument at 2018 @AmerMedicalAssn annual meeting (see on YouTube), but 10% of health is healthcare, 90% is “upstream” eg environment &amp; behavior modification.  Best way to ⬇️ healthcare (ie “sick care”) costs is to turn off upstream spigot w wellness. @PublicHealth

@jbkrell @POTUS @NIAIDNews @HRSAgov @IHSgov @VP @gregggonsalves @fcraw4d Thank you for your thoughts James.  I appreciate your passion (though not your verbiage).

@jbkrell @POTUS @NIAIDNews @HRSAgov @IHSgov @VP @gregggonsalves @fcraw4d But I ❤️ how so many people who have never been to Scott County or tried to implement public health interventions in rural communities- much less ones involving stigmatized diseases, unheard of outbreaks, &amp; controversial interventions, weigh in so definitively on the response.
@jbkrell @POTUS @NIAIDNews @HRSAgov @IHSgov @VP @gregggonsalves @fcraw4d It’s important that people understand HIV diagnosis and treatment in rural areas very different than in urban. Stigma and other factors play a big role. I am fighting to ensure rural  (as well as urban) America is represented in our current policies and actions.
@jbkrell @POTUS @NIAIDNews @HRSAgov @IHSgov @VP @gregggonsalves @fcraw4d James, respectfully, that is categorically untrue.  1) Unprecedented situation 2) Public health experts know case tracking/ confirmation takes time- esp in rural areas. 3) CDC research shows many/ most spread actually/ already  occurred before initial case diagnosed.
To anyone who doubts we can achieve our goal of ⬇️ #HIV infections by 75% in 5 years and 90% in 10 years, I say work with us- combined with @SecAzar commitment to ⬇️ drug prices, you couldn’t ask for a more prepared/ committed team for the task.
.@POTUS has a lifelong #HIV researcher as CDCgov head, an @NIAIDNews Director who is world renowned for his commitment to HIV/AIDS, a Surgeon General who helped lead response to largest modern day HIV outbreak, and @HRSAgov and @IHSgov clinics with &gt;90% viral suppression rates.

Frequent use (more than 20 days in the past 30 days) of e-cigarettes increased from 20% in 2017 to 27.7% in 2018 among current high school e-cigarette users, but no significant change in frequent use was observed for other tobacco products.
Differences in tobacco product use exist across population groups and products. E-cigarette use is highest among boys, whites, and high school students.
Among current tobacco product users, about 2 in 5 (1.68 million) high school students and 1 in 3 (270,000) middle school students used two or more tobacco products in 2018.
This increase—driven by a surge in e-cigarette use (1.5 million more e-cigarette users)—erased past progress in reducing youth tobacco product use. No change occurred in use of other tobacco products, including cigarettes, during the past year.
New CDC MMWR: About 4.9 million middle and high school students were current users (used in the past 30 days) of some type of tobacco product in 2018, including e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, and pipes. This was an increase from 3.6 million in 2017. https://t.co/j2rtpWset2

@ThatDamnedNinja @2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA I agree with this.  Vape shops as a category seem to be doing much better than retail establishments at limiting youth sales. Obviously bad apples and more work to be done all around though.  I hope this is something everyone can agree on.
@Vapingit And “not included” meant not included on the chart I posted from the fda sub analysis of major retail sites.  It doesn’t mean no vape shops were inspected or that there weren’t any violators or that the violation frequency wasn’t equal or greater to the worst retail offenders.
@Vapingit And to be even more clear since either I didn’t explain it well enough or you are determined to misinterpret/ take out of context, “equally high violation rate” means a multiple offender, who received a monetary penalty or a cease sales order (as seen on FDA website)
@Vapingit It’s easy to cut and paste snippets from Twitter and make them fit a narrative.  1) there are all sorts of people selling e cigs to kids, including some vape shops (and the evidence supports that statement) 2) We all have a role to play to ensure #noEcigs4kids Do you disagree?
@2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA The best way to protect vaping as an option for adults, and to protect the many upstanding independent vape shops, is to come together to ensure #noEcigs4kids
@2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA Appreciate your engagement. Many are so dug in, they don’t really want to address the problem so much as they want to try and dismiss/ discredit “the opposition.”   Again I believe ecigs can ⬇️ harm in some adult smokers, but I also know kids are initiating at epidemic rates.

@ChuckWilder85 Also as article says, kids aren’t consuming caffeine all day long to the point of not being able to go a few hours without it.  Nicotine IS addictive, and new devices allow kids to become dependent very quickly.  User, environment, and delivery mode all important when comparing.
@ChuckWilder85 Chuck- it’s NOT safer to vape if like a number of current smokers, you are a non transitioning dual user. Many dual users are actually consuming MORE toxins by adding vaping on top of current smoking than when they just smoked.  Only safer IF transition off cigarettes occurs.
5/5 Sunday Spotlight: In a study last year, Goniewicz found higher levels of cotinine -a breakdown product of nicotine -in the urine of adolescent vapers than reported in prior research of teenage cigarette smokers. 		Ecigs in adults NOT the same as in youth!  #noEcigs4kids
4/5 Sunday Spotlight: "These new generation electronic cigarettes, actually deliver a really high dose of nicotine, probably even higher than tobacco cigarettes," said Maciej Goniewicz, associate professor of oncology and pharmacology at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.

@grimelliottini @2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA Let me say this one more time so everyone hears/ understands. Vape shops overall are neither a) the worst offenders or b) completely blameless  in terms of selling to youth.  We all have a role to play to ensure #noEcigs4kids - hoping the good vape shops can share best practices
@Tigershark94 But I agree with the sentiment that when it’s the actual owner at the counter most of the time vs some detached chain store employee, there is likely to be more scrutiny of the buyer. Need more folks to share best practices for ⬇️ youth sale and access (esp to “straw” buyers).
@Tigershark94 This data set is pulled from “retail chains.”  Vape shops as a whole seem to do a better job than retail chains, but if you go to the fda database, there are still quite a number of serial violations by vape shops.  Work to do all around... https://t.co/POybrIxCEq…
@2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA It’s also work looking that database for those who a) say youth sales aren’t at retail settings but over internet (clearly a LOT is retail) or b) that @US_FDA isn’t enforcing (there are a LOT of violations logged), or c) that some Vape Shops aren’t part of problem.
@2Vaping @Vapingit @US_FDA I have doubts that you really want this information, but if you actually search the @US_FDA public database you mentioned for those given a civil money penalty or no tobacco sale order (ie serial offenders), you will find several vape shops listed. https://t.co/KmtDsCJlKv

@livapelyfe @Vapingit I know I said I wasn’t going to comment but in the interest of correcting misunderstandings, this looked at retail chains.

@Tigershark94 @CADCA @ASAMorg Is a person dying from an exploding e cig, any better or Worse than lung cancer, or a heroin OD? That’s not for me to say.  But it is worth helping young people who are using e cigs and think they can’t become dependent, know they are getting very high doses of nicotine.
@Tigershark94 @CADCA @ASAMorg Fair question.  I don’t think it furthers the conversation to suggest to someone their suffering is less than someone else’s. I do think that with kids telling us they think e cigs are just water vapor, it helps to give them a “dependence potential” frame of reference.

@CADCA @ASAMorg And if you need help with an addiction of any kind, @samhsagov helpline is good place to start. https://t.co/UgOuW8xMOa
@CADCA @ASAMorg So I hope we all can can agree, no matter how you define addiction, e cigs can cause dependence and addiction, and we should all support the idea of #noEcigs4kids.
@CADCA @ASAMorg The e cigarette epidemic among US youth is in fact creating harm- putting aside concerns about learning, attention, and memory, newly nicotine dependent (ie addicted) youth are significantly impairing the school / learning environment in communities across our country.
@CADCA @ASAMorg But again in terms of dependence, I think it is important that all people, especially young people, realize nicotine in both cigarettes and newer e-cigarettes can create rapid dependence, which can lead to harm.
@CADCA @ASAMorg People also question the relative harm of nicotine to other substances. I don’t think it’s a good idea to compare harm. Someone’s loved on dying of smoking or their kid unable to focus in school because of e cig dependence, or their loved one overdosing are all “harm” to someone.
@CADCA @ASAMorg When people speak of the addictive properties of nicotine, much of the focus is on dependence- and a large number of addiction experts feel and consistently state nicotine is one of if not the most dependence creating substance.
@CADCA Many folks focus on “harm” as a defining component of addiction, but addiction in not only about harm.  Here is @ASAMorg definition. 	https://t.co/0ssZmX68tu
@CADCA Lots of good comments/ questions on this tweet- so let’s discuss. “Addiction” is dependent on the person, the environment, the substance/delivery &amp;other factors.  Most experts feel it includes varying degrees of dependence, intoxication, tolerance, withdrawal, and reinforcement.
@regordane @CADCA The fact that ecigs deliver nicotine to an equal or greater extent than even combustible cigarettes (so says industry research), is leading to ⬆️ dependence (a component of addiction) and in the opinion of communities, is causing significant harm (another component of addiction)
@regordane @CADCA Ma’am, my statement &amp; tweet were from a discussion with youth about vaping, for which there IS evidence of addiction, including harm. Biochemical pros and cons aside, the learning environment across our country is being compromised by kids addicted to ecigs. #noEcigs4kids

Hey @NFL - I’m all for enjoying in moderation, but next year can we maybe get 1 health promoting #Superbowl commercial for every 5 (I’d even take 10) beer/ junk food/ soft drink commercials?  The best commercials are actually the health/ positive ones!  Anyone else agree???
As Surgeon General I have to remind you, don’t drink and drive, don’t drink while pregnant, and enjoy beverages in moderation. #SuperBowl
How about @amazon Alexa Flushot???  Or MMR???  A health provider would show up at your door...🤔🤔🤔		You heard it here first...
My kids showed me the 🔥 emoji!!!
@deepssquared Didn’t have the spare $2 million.  My tweets are the best I can do!

There was more offense in that last commercial than in the #Superbowl first half.  But a great offense starts with defense, and a great parenting defense is getting your loved ones vaccinated!  #Protectyourkids

@PeterHotez @CDCDirector @SGottliebFDA @HHS_ASH @HHSGov I pledge to keep fighting but can’t be everywhere, &amp; also don’t carry the same weight with your local legislators that YOU do. So when you wonder why so many states have opt opts, also ask yourself when was last time you / colleagues spoke w your local legislators on vaccines.
@PeterHotez @CDCDirector @SGottliebFDA @HHS_ASH @HHSGov As a former state health officer I can tell you most politicians believe in vaccinations, but also respond to constituents. When scores of people against vaccines call / visit legislators descend on the Statehouse, and few to none show up to defend vaccines, this is what you get.
@PeterHotez @CDCDirector Dr. Redfield and I, along with @SGottliebFDA @HHS_ASH and all of @HHSGov educate about vaccine safety and efficacy whenever we can. But most of opposition / opt out discussions are at local/ state levels, not national . We ALL must do our part to educate. #VaccinesWork

@cyncab @JUULvapor We should tailor and target outreach/interventions, but this is a universal problem that requires income and color blind outreach. #noEcigs4kids means ALL kids. I hope you agree.
@cyncab @JUULvapor Disparities exist in use among kids (evidence suggests youth use is more likely among higher SES populations) but important to remember use is still very high among everyone – kids are selling single hits of JUUL on school grounds, so the cost issue isn’t necessarily prohibitive.

No child should use #marijuana/ products non medically. Not safe for the developing brain &amp; affects learning and memory. Possible short-term effects are: slower reaction times, anxiety, fear, distrust, and a faster heart rate. Over time, it can ⬆️ risk for addiction. #NDAFW
MYTH: Marijuana is a safe &amp; effective medicine.  FACT: Some individual components of marijuana, like cannabidiol (or CBD) have therapeutic benefits. However, the whole plant is not an approved medicine, &amp; @US_FDA -approved CBD based medicines can only be prescribed by a doctor.

@Blue and @Colts (and if you look closely a few other Indy fans of note) telling people to get their #flushot and follow the 3 C’s - Clean, Cover, and Contain

As of 2016, cancer death rate for men and women had fallen 27% from its peak in 1991. This decline translates to more than 2.6 million deaths avoided between 1991 and 2016.		The drop is mostly due to steady reductions in smoking and advances in early detection and treatment.
Just at our tobacco Steering Committee, discussing “Cancer Statistics, 2019” The death rate from cancer in the US has declined steadily over the past 25 years, according to annual statistics reporting from the ⁦@AmericanCancer⁩ Society  https://t.co/2mO78Lusi2

@CharlieRivkin Thanks Ambassador!  I want to be you when I grow up!  😉 I also love to find creative ways to deliver health messages. Health can and should be fun!
@lucymsullivan Agree Lucy! I was in Illinois @IDPH last fall for the release of their historic maternal mortality report, and spoke at @HRSAgov maternal mortality conference earlier in the year.  Definitely committed to turning the tide on this unfortunate trend.
@Cyn_LA1 Very much agree. Addressing diabetes and risk factors is important to healthy communities and a healthy military.  Definitely something I talk about whenever I have chance.
@DrHowardLiu @AACAP @AmerAcadPeds @afspnational @cmoutierMD @Active_Minds @APA @APAPsychiatric Agree Dr. Liu.  Much overlap between ⬆️ suicides, and military health/ national security (20 current/ former soldiers die by suicide EVERY DAY!), opioid epidemic, and overall community health.  Let’s all take on this problem TOGETHER!  Better partnerships =&gt; better health.
@rupalPT Completely agree!  I’m looking forward to speaking at the @APTAtweets annual leadership meeting later this month.
@Sunkissed1986 It’s also considered an epidemic by the Surgeon General 😉. In 2019 we really need to address the rise in youth use of all tobacco and nicotine delivery products.  #noEcigs4kids
@DanBoon63784314 @AmerMedicalAssn Working on all those Dan!  @AmerMedicalAssn has been a great partner in this regard.  We can and must lower overdoses while also protecting and supporting those who are in pain. AND- not OR!
@statesdj @HHS_ASH and I are 💯% committed to strengthening and promoting the #USPHS Commissioned Corps.  A strong Corps = a healthier and safer Nation and world!
@abbyjoyg 70% of 18-25 year olds are ineligible for military service, mainly traceable to poor physical and mental health. And all branches having trouble retaining soldiers and having them ready to fight due to obesity &amp; other health problems A less healthy USA is a less safe USA.
@Nowheezes @GovHolcomb ⬇️ Smoking has always been and remains part of SG work. Critical/ connected to all my priorities, including opioids/ addiction, e-cigs, oral health &amp; cancer, national security (~ 1/4 military enlisted smoke), and community health! And my warning is still on the cigarette box!
@DoctorSharonAO Health equity is embedded into all of my priorities and everything I do, and @MinorityHealth is a great partner!  We work well and closely together. Whenever anyone anywhere suffers from health inequity, we ALL pay the price!
Oral Health is value added, not an add-on. This is why I commissioned a new report on #OralHealth and why we announced a webinar on 1/10/2019 and are calling for public comment by 1/25/2019 https://t.co/y8cv8DapKw.
@SlingshotDC Agree- must use the public’s attention to emphasize that all addiction is a problem, and get at upstream risk and protective factors. Many opioid misusers misuse other substances, and also have mental health diagnoses!
Surgeon General’s 2019 Goals👨🏽‍⚕️	1) ⬇️opioid overdoses 	2) ⬇️youth e-cigarette use 	3) ⬆️oral health for all	4) ⬆️awareness of link between national security &amp; health 	5)Promote community health as a means to economic prosperity		Better partnerships=&gt;better health!

@PatrickDoyle_35 @alexhkral Also CLEARLY said more work needs to be done by all (including feds) and that we can’t spend our way out of the opioid epidemic, but more money allocated by this administration to it than any other- which also is verifiably true and supported by many.
@PatrickDoyle_35 @alexhkral Patrick- never said solutions can’t come from (or be facilitated/ lifted up by) feds.  Said we aren’t going to solve the opioid crisis from DC.

First, the meeting validated my belief that law enforcement all across the nation are already doing incredible work to help combat the opioid epidemic. Here in Boston, officers are helping connect individuals with substance abuse disorders to care.
During that trip, I met with former Boston Police Commissioner William Evans to learn about how officers in the city were addressing the opioid epidemic. That meeting had a big impact on my first year for a couple reasons.
One of my first trips in 2018 was to Boston, so it is only fitting that I am here in December to talk to speak at the second annual National Law Enforcement Summit. #PaariSummit2018
Law enforcement is crucial to fighting the opioid epidemic. #PAARISummit2018

C. Everett Koop fought HIV/AIDS stigma &amp; ignorance 30 years ago with a pamphlet. Today I’m fighting opioid misuse stigma &amp; ignorance with a digital postcard. On #WorldAIDSDay let’s embrace all who suffer from these treatable maladies. https://t.co/TrC45U1P6P via @slate
I mourn for his family, but celebrate the life of President H.W. Bush - he showed his great love for our country through a lifetime of service.  #RIPGeorgeHWBush #thankyouHW https://t.co/JE8C2j2TDL
New @CDCgov data shows US life expectancy has dropped for the second time in the past three years, due to increase in suicide and overdose death rates. We need come together as a nation to address community health and wellness for the sake of our future.
@MikeStobbe Yes, you are right.  We are tweeting now.
Smoking during pregnancy in US is declining but efforts are needed to further reduce the number of young women who initiate smoking—study and commentary in #PublicHealthReports https://t.co/XIWXEk09cm
It also starts with educating all individuals about steps they can take to raise awareness, prevent addiction and stop overdose deaths.  I want every individual to receive my digital postcard. Please go to https://t.co/EPBhAoImtF to read, share, the postcard. https://t.co/SyHfXIFVFH
As the Surgeon General, I am focused on educating the public about the severity of the opioid crisis.  That starts w/putting Naloxone – a medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose- in the hands of police officers, paramedics, AND community members. #SaveALife
@ThomasRGolden @CDCgov Tom- check out https://t.co/EPBhAoImtF to learn about my CHEP initiative to promote investments in community health. We ALL have a role to play. #lifeexpectencydeclines
Shocking news for me as a father- unless we get serious about building healthy communities, new @CDCgov data suggests America’s children may not live as long of a life as their parents. 🙁 https://t.co/tXgeHMiVf7
We need come together as a nation to address community health and wellness for the sake of our future. Everyone has a role to play when it comes to health. #lifeexpectencydeclines
Started the morning with Shay and Shyne at @Hot103Jamz in KC.  We were flossing and hyping and talking about the opioid epidemic.  Told KC to check out my digital postcard on opioids at https://t.co/DEkaVrCK32 https://t.co/78ecOhGfsL
By investing in community health, and some of the upstream determinants of health, we can improve the health of the population. I want to applaud @KCMedSociety   for lifting up both healthcare and health in Kansas City community. #KCMS
I’d also like to mention that Wesley is an amazing athlete who can climb a rope while in his wheelchair!! #KCMS
At the @KCMedSociety Annual Meeting in #KansasCity and met Wesley and Jenna — who are two incredible individuals — who shared their inspiring stories about overcoming health challenges. You both are truly inspirational. https://t.co/lnwxxhGDL1
Dr. Lieberman just told #AMSUS2018 crowd that @DeptVetAffairs has achieved nearly 100% screening of all at risk Veterans for Hepatitis C, and are approaching complete eradication of HepC among diagnosed- proving it CAN be done!  👏 #knowmorehepC @AMSUS @cdchep
Just heard @DeptVetAffairs is placing narcan with all of their external cardiac defibrillators!  Kudos to VA for maximizing life saving opportunities!   #narcansaves #AMSUS2018
Learning about @DeptVetAffairs VA medical foster home program- a family takes a dependent Veteran into their home as an alternative to a nursing home. What an innovative way to support those who’ve served our country. That’s better health through partnerships! @AMSUS #AMSUS2018
I want to increase awareness of the connection between community health and business health. We need to invest community health and that’s why I’m working on a Surgeon General’s report. #AMSUS2018
“In addition to the opioid crisis, we know that poor health beyond substance misuse is hampering our success both as individuals and as a nation. That’s why I launched my Community Health and Economic Prosperity Initiative.”
I want every individual to receive the Surgeon General’s digital postcard. It provides tangible actions you can take to raise awareness, prevent addiction and prevent overdose deaths. Visit my website to download it. #AMSUS2018 https://t.co/Esb3Lp4VIm
Right now, one of the greatest health threats to Americans is the opioid crisis, which is why I have dedicated a significant amount of my time as Surgeon General to raising awareness about what each and every one can do to play their part in addressing this epidemic.
“As Surgeon General, I am committed to ending health disparities and working to give every American the opportunity to live a healthy and prosperous life.” #AMSUS2018
“#USPHS officers are trained &amp; called upon to respond to national emergencies, natural disasters &amp; other public health crises. Currently we have officers deployed to help w/the California wildfires, Typhoon Yutu &amp; help w/recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.” #AMSUS2018 https://t.co/ZshfwgyHwU

95% of Army recruits needed dental work, over 50% can’t be deployed due to dental issues.  Our Nation’s poor health- especially oral health- is affecting our National security. @USArmy @LTGWest @AmerDentalAssn @CDCgov @NIDCR https://t.co/PWoCBsFKkG
6 million unfilled jobs in US.  Many who could fill them have checked out of workforce due to health issues, and no where is this more apparent than in area of oral health. Who will take these jobs &amp; continue to spur our economy? #healthiswealth @AmerDentalAssn @NIDCR @CDCgov https://t.co/cUc7RCShFb
Great conversation on oral health today. Has improved for youth and older adults over past decade, but NO change for working age adults.  This is costing individuals, businesses, and communities.  Health is wealth and oral health = overall health. #SGoralhealthreport @NIH @CDCgov https://t.co/be8vZMckf9
Special thanks to all the participants at today’s Oral Health listening session. It is important that we continue this critical dialogue. #oralhealth
Partnerships are critical in meeting oral health needs across the lifespan.  They can improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations, ↓ hospitalizations, and ↓ overall health care costs. #bhbp #oralhealth
Right this way to better oral health!  Excited to discuss pathways to promoting oral health and oral health equity with @NIDCR @NIH @CDCgov @HRSAgov @AmerDentalAssn @SpecialOlympics and many other partners! https://t.co/tCafZLpXaS

@ddiamond FYI Dan- @CDCgov put out an MMWR on gun violence just over a week ago. Maybe not enough for some but definitely not 🤐 https://t.co/0PuLFkFoVi
@KaminskiMed @CDCgov FYI Naftali- I spoke on this issue publicly twice in the past week, and issued and MMWR on the topic Nov 9. We need less finger pointing and more willingness to engage all sides (including gun owners) in conversation.  That’s the way forward.  https://t.co/0PuLFkFoVi
@whole_patients @SGottliebFDA I agree Margaret!  We need to make kids and adults aware of the addicting properties of ecigs.  Ideally, cigarettes wouldn’t be any more available to kids than e-cigs, but still must provide a viable “off- ramp.”
@carlvphillips Hi Carl- the picture caption describes Mr Potato Head “retiring” the pipe from his set (which had previously given kids the impression that smoking was okay). This was an important acknowledgment that we give children subtle clues about what is and is not ok/ safe.
@jaimepearce03 Thanks for sharing Jaime!  I have relatives with both type 1 and type 2- it’s important that we all better understand the challenges individuals with diabetes face, and maximize opportunities for health for all! #NationalDiabetesMonth
@DrMcCance_Katz Thanks Dr. McCance-Katz!  @samhsagov and the office are Surgeon General are partnering to promote naloxone awareness and availability- we need communities to across America to also partner to save lives, and connect people to recovery!

@Dan__Kelsey @ngadc @SecondLady That’s a cruel choice Dan!  I pick going down the @TCMIndy Yuletide slide and ending up in the National Gallery- We just need to install a teleporter at the end of the slide! 🤣The Adams family misses Indy- especially during the holidays! 🎄
So glad my kids had fun at the National Gallery of Art. @ngadc has a great audio family tour that engages the kids, and I explained to them that for Van Gogh and many others, art can be therapeutic/ good for your health!  I know @SecondLady agrees! https://t.co/xV8YFgwivw
Pic of my one of my most famous predecessors 31 years ago! We’ve come a long way in terms of marketing combustible tobacco to kids. Now mustn’t repeat the same mistakes with e-cigs and vaping. Stay the course @SGottliebFDA- No child should EVER use or think e-cigs are harmless! https://t.co/XrmR1rKIcs

@Gail_G_Scott @drmanejwala @HamidGhanadan @PamBelluck Gail, health policy is difficult- there isn’t always clarity.  By definition a public health problem affects a population.  If your “population” is rural community that hunts for food and has zero homicides/ suicides, guns aren’t a problem- they are food and family time.
Simply put, no youth should EVER use e-cigarettes.
These numbers highlight the urgent need for immediate action to stop the flood of youth initiation. See what @SGottliebFDA is proposing to do to protect youth: https://t.co/xtPrYmJLHR
Though we’ve made tremendous progress since the first Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health in 1964, the new data from @FDATobacco and @CDCTobaccoFree in the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey on youth e-cigarette use are alarming:  https://t.co/xRZqq29xcS

@joshpetepeters And ALL safety is my priority.  There is no win in saying “x” is my top priority.  Would you have me demote opioids?  Tobacco?  Let’s stop with the rhetoric and ranking and have a real conversation about common upstream causes.
@joshpetepeters Sorry you feel that way Josha I just tried to answer the questions honestly. You can’t promote gun safety without gun owners and you can’t engage gun owners with language that demonizes them.  Is it a “dodge” to ask both sides to stop with the good vs evil rhetoric and just talk?

“We need to ensure that the dialogue on health equity also includes intellectual disability, which has traditionally not been the case. Special Olympics has the tools to support your inclusive health journey.”

We need to do more &amp; we CAN do more. I recently released a 21st century advisory to educate all individuals about the opioid crisis. The digital postcard provides steps anyone can take to raise awareness, prevent addiction and prevent overdose deaths. @PublicHealth https://t.co/zuOWENn6kO
"It is important we recognize that addiction is a chronic disease, but effective treatment is available, and people recover every day." @PublicHealth @APHAAnnualMtg
“ I have often said that stigma is one of our biggest killers, and unless individuals feel comfortable seeking help for their addiction, we will not be able to reach those who need help the most.” @PublicHealth  @APHAAnnualMtg
“As the statistics demonstrate, it is likely that many, if not most of us here today have been touched by the opioid crisis; and like you, for me the opioid crisis is not just pressing, but personal” Speaking @APHAAnnualMtg https://t.co/EArcXDvRsP
Spoke earlier at Heron Therapeutics, Inc about ways to tackle the opioid epidemic and forging new partnerships. Encouraged individuals to visit https://t.co/WZXhLswtQB to learn about steps they can take to prevent opioid misuse. https://t.co/l4rTaZS8Cw
Physical activity helps manage more chronic health conditions.  Here are the top 10 things  to know from the #PAGuidelines https://t.co/uf5LPrp5L4
There are more long-term benefits from physical activity, including improved brain health, reduced risk of eight types of cancer (previously two), reduced risk for fall-related injuries in older adults, and reduced risk of excessive weight gain.
The #PAGuidelines state: There are immediate health benefits, attainable from a single bout of activity, including reduced anxiety and blood pressure, improved quality of sleep, and improved insulin sensitivity.
Great to see @HHS_ASH talking about the #PAGuidelines for Americans, 2nd Edition this morning: https://t.co/XhIzM6e0a5.  These Guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations to help all Americans improve their health through increased physical activity.
Thanks for the opportunity APHA. Please don’t ever doubt my passion for public health. My goal is to better engage ALL audiences not by downplaying or pitting against their priorities, but by showing them how healthy communities address all other priorities. #BHBP https://t.co/OKEOSy07aj
@MaryFrancis8218 @Interact4Health @PublicHealth Great to meet you today.  I could sense and loved your passion!  ❤️❤️❤️
@midwifeana Also, I don’t judge others paths or tactics- I was just speaking from my life experiences and that of those I admire (again like MLK). We all must find our balance between passion and pragmatism, and seek to find the path that best advances our goals.  Best of luck to you.
@midwifeana Sorry you feel that way.  So you feel MLK was wrong and harmful about only love (and not hate) being able to drive out hate?  Because I believe too many people don’t realize that you can acknowledge and hate the wrong but still try to engage (and love) those you oppose. #WWMLKD

My heart goes out to the Troxell family. As a parent myself, I cannot understand the pain you are feeling right now. But I want you to know that we are doing everything we can to help the nation understand that addiction is a not a moral failing. It is a chronic disease.

I’ve often said, stigma is one of our biggest killers and a significant barrier to solving our public health problems. We need to get to a place where we can truly, as a nation, say that addiction is a chronic disease.

@isongei @Walgreens @CDCFlu @cvspharmacy @Safeway @GiantFood @Walmart @Target Many pharmacies and others locations (including many jobs) provide flu shots.  The easier we can make it for people (from both an access and a cost POV), the more community immunity there is.  Remember, the #flushot doesn’t just protect you- it protects those around you!
@Kidfears99 @Walgreens @CDCFlu Great question! Sorry to hear about your experience thus far. No shortages of flu shot reported so far this year. Since it’s early in the season, it sometimes takes a bit for pharmacies to get all their seasonal stock in. Please keep trying though. Any other advice, @CDCFlu?
@AllaKovch @Walgreens @CDCFlu Alla, please check out flu facts and FAQs at @CDCFlu website. Fact: some people experience mild reactions after flu shots, but they go away quickly and the rare symptoms people may have are still MUCH less severe than symptoms of the actual flu. https://t.co/xcI6DeY231

@QuinnNystrom Quinn- I would love to and plan to do that. It was never my intent to upset anyone and I hope we all can use this as an opportunity to talk about stigma, and to help empower everyone with a chronic disease- especially those who struggle with type 1 diabetes.
Thanks to all who pointed out how my tweet could have been misinterpreted and actually contributed to stigma. I don’t want anyone with any disease to feel stigmatized- and my remarks illustrate why we must always be cognizant of what we say and how we say it.
Many different diseases can be caused or exacerbated by behavior and environment.  But we should NEVER prejudge anyone’s worthiness to receive medical treatment - whether type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or someone with opioid use disorder.
Because my remarks were to a medical crowd, I assumed people would understand my example referred to hyperglycemia specifically caused or exacerbated by diet.  However many people develop diabetes and/or exacerbations unrelated to diet.
Yesterday I tweeted about remarks I made to a group of doctors regarding opioids and stigma, and I unfortunately and regrettably upset some in the diabetes community.  I apologize.

@LilysPlaceWV provides medical care to infants suffering from NAS and provides non-judgmental support, education and counseling services to families and caregivers.
The work at @LilysPlaceWV underscores the importance of @FLOTUS initiative #BeBest by focusing on supporting adults &amp; children affected by the opioid epidemic w/a special attention to neonatal abstinence syndrome. I’m touring the center to meet w/ppl impacted by the epidemic. https://t.co/lPUynnsutw
#BeBest also works to promote the people, organizations, and programs that are helping children overcome the issues they face growing up. @FLOTUS
#BeBest combats the issues facing children today by championing the many successful well-being programs that teach children tools and skills for emotional, social, and physical well-being.
Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a group of physiologic and neurobehavioral signs of withdrawal that may occur in a newborn who was exposed to opioids in utero.
What makes the opioid epidemic so difficult is that every individual is unique. There is no one-size-fits all solution. And we see this with pregnant women and babies being born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.

We all have a role to play to end this public health epidemic.  Thank you @RepHultgren for hosting this important conversation and for bringing together leaders who can make a difference.
If you or someone you know is at risk for an overdose, carry &amp; know how to use Naloxone. We need to do all we can to give every overdose victim the chance to live. No mother should ever bury her child, &amp; esp not when there is a life-saving intervention that anyone can access.
We have to educate law enforcement and work with first responders to implement best practices, such as working with peer-to-peer recovery support services at the point of admission to a hospital.
We know that the best way to get individuals into treatment is to have the support systems in place that enable a transition to care.
I commend @RepHultgren and all of the other leaders in the room who have made the decision to face this epidemic head on. Now the state of Illinois and the 14th district have already adopted some best practices.
Opioid addiction impacts every community.  That is why I issued the first ever Surgeon General’s Advisory on Naloxone, an overdose-reversing drug, in more than 10 years. https://t.co/ScHELNcBF0
We lose someone from an opioid overdoes every 12.5 minutes, with more than half dying at home. This impacts every community in America. https://t.co/idTNP1xI73

As the Surgeon General, I am focused on preventing addiction before it starts, working with our communities to destigmatize addiction, and putting naloxone, which is a lifesaving medication that serves as a #bridgetocare, in the hands of first responders and community members.
Unfortunately the state of TN is no stranger to the opioid epidemic. I’ve heard firsthand from @DrPhilRoe about how the epidemic has impacted the communities in the Volunteer State. As Surgeon General, my role is to educate the public about the severity of this epidemic.
Today in America, addiction is a public health crisis. An estimated 2.1 million people in the U.S. struggle with an opioid use disorder and only 1 in 5 receives any treatment at all. #BHBP @DrMannyHT

As Surgeon General, I want to find areas of alignment with all sectors so we can improve the health of our nation. I want us to break out of our silos and work with non traditional partners. @RWJF #bhbp https://t.co/GbFH0E4Xgn
We need to create a culture of health in all sectors. Businesses can play an important role in lifting up the health of their communities. By doing so, they can see better health, better productivity and better return on investments. #bhbp

Discussing prevention approaches to the #opioidcrisis with @US_FDA Commissioner, @SGottliebFDA, and @CDCgov Acting Director, Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat. We need to work across sectors and bring in faith leaders, law enforcement, and community members.
It’s also important that we understand the role of trauma in physical and behavioral health conditions. Studies show half of all U.S. kids have experienced at least one potentially traumatic Adverse Childhood Experience. #opioidcrisis
As we work to end the #opioidcrisis, we need to focus on prevention. It is important that we look upstream. We have a lot of work to do to help the public understand that this crisis touches everyone.

Thank you @TJMShow for the opportunity to speak with you and your listeners about the #OpioidEpidemic.  Although we face tremendous challenges as a nation in battling the #OpioidEpidemic , there is hope. People can and do recover.
"I want people to know that prevention works, treatment is effective  and people recover every day. Together, we can tackle the #OpioidEpidemic" @TJMShow
"We must all be vigilant and ensure that prevention messaging is reaching our young people.  Communities also need to know that effective, evidence-based treatments are available to treat opioid use disorder." @TJMShow
" And in 2016, Black &amp; African American youth 12-17 were more likely than whites to have used opioids in the past year. This data shows that we are moving in the wrong direction, &amp; may be a precursor to even more opioid overdose fatalities in the black community in coming years."
"The #OpioidEpidemic does not discriminate- people of all colors are dying.  Studies show that there were disproportionally large increases in drug deaths among racial and ethnic minority groups in the last year." @TJMShow
"Addiction is also personal to me. My brother has struggled w/addiction for years &amp; like many others in his predicament, his addiction is a key factor in his history of incarcerations.  Addiction is a chronic disease &amp; it must be treated w/skill, compassion, &amp; urgency"@TJMShow
"Science tells us that addiction impacts every community in America. An estimated 2.1 million people in the U.S. struggle with an #opioid use disorder, but unfortunately only 1 in 5 receives any form of treatment. This is unacceptable. We need to do more." @TJMShow

.@BlueZones and @CDCgov tell us, the most cost effective way to lower healthcare costs is through local policy and supports, &amp; built environment
Guevara in Costa Rica spends 1/15 of what US spends on healthcare, has HALF the cardiovascular mortality.  Best way to lower healthcare costs isn't by focusing only on healthcare innovation, but rather on environment &amp; community innovation.
Starting my Friday with a briefing on @bluezones from Dan Buettner, in hopes we can better show policy makers and employers how to build healthy AND prosperous communities. #healthmeanswealth @USChamber @amazon @jpmorgan @WarrenBuffett https://t.co/ZeyHoCye60
Most importantly, remember that your best defense is getting the #flu vaccine. Getting vaccinated prevents spread to others, and reduces the duration and severity of illness. For more information, visit https://t.co/jHSZeaEKSy
#flu symptoms include sore throat, cough, fever, chills, aches, and tiredness.  	If you feel sick contact your health care provider sooner rather than later.
It's important to protect yourself during the #flu season: Remember the three c's: Clean, Cover and Contain. Clean your hands frequently. Cover your cough and sneeze. Contain your germs.
As @SecAzar mentioned, given the severity of this year’s flu season – we are working closing with public health experts – including @CDCgov – to monitor the situation &amp; share information on the steps you can take to protect yourself &amp; your families from the spread of the #flu .

As a gun owner myself, I know most of us agree on several common sense solutions.  But real change starts with a local conversation. Police, gun owners, gun retailers, and health advocates must come together as a community to address this
We must let the police investigate fully, but we can and must do better as a country to address the factors which lead to gun related violence. The status quo is not an option.

Thank you @thehill and @BobCusack for hosting an important conversation on America's #OpioidEpidemic: Supporting Recovery.  By working together, we can help turn the tide. https://t.co/KmqPOrjp9a
I have witnessed the value of support in communities I have visited all over the country, most recently at the Anchor Recovery Center where peer recovery support specialists play an integral role in facilitating &amp; supporting the recovery process for their peers #Support4Recovery
Mutual aid and recovery support services are a key part of the system of continuing care for substance use disorders in the United States.  As part of this array, Recovery Coaches play a vital role.  #Support4Recovery
It is critical that while we are in the midst of this #OpioidEpidemic  that patients w/opioid use disorder get individualized treatment plans &amp; have access to FDA-approved medications together w/a full array of effective behavioral treatments &amp; supports. #Support4Recovery
Recovery is personal.  Each person's recovery journey is unique.  People will choose their pathway based on their cultural values, their socioeconomic status, their psychological and behavioral needs, and the nature of their substance use disorder. #Support4Recovery
We now know that recovery goes beyond the remission of symptoms to include a positive change in the whole person. In this regard, “abstinence,” though often necessary, is not always sufficient to define recovery. #support4recovery
@BeldenInc is an example of how businesses are working to connect people to care.  Belden has developed a program to help job applicants that have failed a drug test get connected to treatment and care. #Support4Recovery
As Surgeon General, I’m focused on prevention and educating the American people about the severity of the #opioid epidemic.#support4recovery
Addiction touches all of us. I personally know because my family has been touched by the #opioid epidemic. #Support4Recovery

@LTGWest and I are working together with the other uniformed services to improve the health of our service members and the communities they live in.
Following the footsteps of leaders like Dr. Augusta—we have trailblazers like General Nadja West @LTGWest who continue the tradition of excellence by military physicians. @LTGWest is the first Black @USArmy Surgeon General—and an example of what can be achieved thru perseverance.
In light of this year’s #BHM theme, I'd like us to remember the work and perseverance of Dr. Alexander T. Augusta—the @USArmy’s first African American Physician and the first black professor of medicine in the US, working at the newly formed @HowardU in #WashingtonDC
The first time I ever interacted with a black physician I was in college &amp; met @SecretaryCarson.To see a black man making important contributions in the medical field—lit a fire in me, a belief that I could do the same. Thank you @SecretaryCarson for inspiring me &amp; so many others
I have the privilege of leading the #USPHS #CommissionedCorps—a uniformed service of more than 6,500 officers who are dedicated to protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety of the nation.
This years theme for Black History Month is African Americans in the #Military. I come from a long linage of service-my uncles, aunt&amp; grandfather supported/served in the armed forces. Service to our country runs deep in my family’s blood &amp; it runs deep in the black community #BHM
Thank you, @POTUS, and @FLOTUS, for inviting me to honor the history of Black Americans in our country. It is an honor to celebrate Black History Month with you, my family and with an audience of black leaders. #BHM

Naloxone is a critical first step to connecting people to care. We can all help save a life.  #SPHDSS18
There are actionable steps we all can take to help tackle the #opioidcrisis. Share your story. Addiction touches all of us. #SPHDSS18
So, today I leave asking for your help. We need to commit to working with partners, especially non-traditional partners. Alone we can make an impact, but together we can shift our nation’s health for the better. #SPHDSS18
As the Surgeon General, I am focused on putting naloxone in the hands of first responders and community members, educating the public about the severity of the epidemic, destigmatizing addiction, and preventing addiction before it starts. #SPHDSS18
Addiction is a chronic disease that requires a coordinated effort.  We have developed a robust response to the opioids crisis, but sadly, based on current evidence, overdoses and infectious disease are continuing.
The role of the Surgeon General is to communicate the science around health to the American people. Recognizing the role of wellness in our country’s safety, security, and prosperity is the reason I will focus my term on “Better Health through Better Partnerships.” https://t.co/CwSu5ATQuG

Thank you @VoicesHSPH for hosting and facilitating this important discussion on the #OpioidEpidemic We all have a role to play to help turn the tide.
Naloxone, a medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, is a critical first step to connecting people to care. It is important that we put naloxone in the hands of first res ponders and community members. #OpioidEpidemic
Addiction impacts all of us.  As Surgeon General, I am focused on educating the public about the severity of the #OpioidEpidemic, and working with our communities to destigmatize addiction. It is a chronic illness.
During my tenure, I will focus on our country’s growing opioid epidemic, health and national security, and the correlation between health and economic prosperity.

Epidemics like #addiction threaten all communities. The pursuit of health should be a cause that unites us, not divides us. #CSISLive

Loneliness is associated w/ increased risk of premature death. And the effect on mortality is comparable to impact of smoking or obesity. https://t.co/BZndeKkG8g
#ScienceAlert: Social isolation is widespread in the U.S. Since the 1980s, loneliness among adults increased from 20% to 40%.
The support we offer can make the difference between relapse	&amp; recovery.
Compassion is our most powerful weapon in the fight to end	addiction.
Addressing #addiction requires community driven leadership.	Mayors play a key role in #TurningTheTide.
While states are the laboratories of democracy, cities and towns are the engines of innovation.  Lasting change starts locally.

To all of you who are here today I want to offer my sincere appreciation for your commitment and courage.
As strong as our policies may be, our nation cannot heal fully without compassion.
I believe to truly solve #mentalhealth challenges we have to embrace a fundamental American value: that we are responsible for each other.
To improve the #mentalhealth of America we have to focus on improving emotional well-being.
Changing perception of mental illness requires changing culture.
There are more efforts underway. @HHSgov is supporting pilots to use telehealth to expand access to #mentalhealth services in rural areas
ACA invested billions in expanding community health centers--essential for providing mental health service in underserved communities.

Happy b-day to #USPHS sister service @NOAA Commissioned Corps. Thank you for all you do to understand our environment &amp; protect our nation.
Our journey to a more just &amp; prosperous America ends when health is not the privilege of the few but the birthright of all ppl. #PHASummit
We face serious challenges when it comes to making our nation healthy but I firmly believe that we can overcome them. #PHASummit
Emotional well-being is a powerful but largely unrecognized resource that has the potential to improve health &amp; transform lives. #PHASummit
Third, we have to create a foundation for prevention in America that recognizes we must focus on the body, mind &amp; spirit. #PHASummit
Second, we can’t change health behaviors in a sustainable way until we change the environment in which we live. #PHASummit
How do we make prevention our way of life? First, we must create a culture where healthy is equated w/ happiness &amp; what ppl want. #PHASummit
Health is more than a set of lab values. Health is the key to opportunity. It’s what allows people to pursue their dreams. #PHASummit
I'm convinced that if we really want to safeguard the health of our nation, we have to create a culture of prevention in America. #PHASummit

Clinicians &amp; #PublicHealth leaders have the power to #TurnTheTide on the opioid epidemic. #FSMB2016
How can we solve the opioid crisis? We need all parts of society working together from healthcare to law enforcement to faith orgs #FSMB2016
Since 1999, #opioid prescriptions and opioid overdose deaths have dramatically increased. #FSMB2016
Since 1999, the quantity of #opioids prescribed has quadrupled without a significant change in pain reported by Americans. #FSMB2016
In the past, doctors were urged to treat pain aggressively but w/o being given much training in how to do so safely &amp; effectively. #FSMB2016
I hear about #opioids everywhere I go and I have seen the crisis up front as a physician. #FSMB2016
To safeguard health &amp; opportunity for everyone in our country, we must create a culture of prevention in America. #FSMB2016
We have made great advances in recent years to improve health and expand opportunity. But we know we still have more work to do. #FSMB2016
