A 20-cent increase in the gas tax would make Minnesotans safer and ensure nothing like the I-35W bridge collapse happens again.  In Oct 2018, the American Society of Civil Engineers graded Minnesota‚Äôs roads a ‚ÄòD+‚Äô, bridges a ‚ÄòC‚Äô and transit a ‚ÄòC-‚Äò. Minnesotans deserve better.‚Äù
Minnesota‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure is putting our safety at risk. A recent report found that there are over 1,000 Minnesota bridges and 100s of miles of roads that are in poor condition. This costs the average Minnesotan more than $1,000 a year in gas, lost time, &amp; car repairs.

The government is currently going through its longest shutdown in history, with no end in sight. And Trump‚Äôs to blame. He said it himself, ‚ÄúI will be the one to shut it down.‚Äù #EndTheShutdown
Trump‚Äôs only significant legislative accomplishment gave massive tax breaks to the rich and big corporations, while doing nothing to benefit workers. #failure
the White House is separately prepping a draft of a national emergency proclamation for the border and has found more than $7 billion to fund the wall. Trump could declare a national emergency and direct the Defense Department to build a wall without needing Congress' blessing.
Trump vowed to protect Medicare and Social Security, but has proposed drastic cuts to both programs. He repeatedly promised that he would lower the costs of prescription drugs within weeks, but that hasn‚Äôt happened. #TrumpLies
