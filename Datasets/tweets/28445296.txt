@canya_DIG_it ok, then it is Potentially reputable
@canya_DIG_it earlier in september, and whats the margin of error and the poll magnitude, they aren't all huge
@LyydMc @olivia_madara although all the time i text her her reply is "box, box, :) box, box, ;)"
@canya_DIG_it look at the national polls, where they poll like 10m people, those give a much more accurate reading
@canya_DIG_it and they state that the margin of eror is +/-4.0 % just out of those 1000
@canya_DIG_it they only polled 1006 people... if i found 1006 libertarians and asked them, he would have 100% approval...
@canya_DIG_it MSNBC has him at &lt;1%
@canya_DIG_it well, its a 3 hour debate, which is alot of air time to give up, and cancel regular shows.and he is polling at less than 1%...
@canya_DIG_it but thats not how it works, if they had to pay, he should have to to, its only fair to the other two, they worked to get there
@canya_DIG_it they are just paying the tv network to air the debate, and to rent the space, thats all, we would do the same to hold an event
@canya_DIG_it the other candidates had to do that too, its just easy for them because they are popular
@canya_DIG_it he can, assuming he meets all the requirements of the debate: poll a certain %, pay a huge entry fee... if he does, he can
@canya_DIG_it thats 258621291 votes, you have to realize thats not realistic from an outside party...
@canya_DIG_it they wont have a shot anyway, considering the setup of the electorate, stats say libertarians would need 83% of the pop vote
