@andyfurillo yes, that is Ford's old seat. There's always been a moderate in that seat, but Amash did not come to it with a moderate's reputation. (He defeated a Democrat I covered for years) In fact, he's very conservative. Which makes his independence that much more impressive.

@andyfurillo Justin Amash has definitely proven himself to be fairly independent as Trump goes. He voted for the House resolution to rescind Trump’s emergency order. 		He’s from Betsy DeVos’s home turf, so is likely facing searing heat from her Dutch Mafia minions there.

@Stevemorrisjr1 @JenGranholm @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 @POTUS Convicted of lying on behalf of your MAGA chief. You should be indebted to Cohen. And now that he’s revealing the truth, you can follow in suit: own up to the truth and realize Trump is the true liar. I mean, it’s rich (hypocritical) that a Trump supporter is so offended by lies.
@CPD1962 @JenGranholm @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 Wait. Cohen only lied to Congress to protect Trump. Are you arguing he should’ve told the truth in his first go-around and implicated Trump then? He took one for the MAGA team! I think you must really mean you’re upset with Cohen for turning on Trump with the truth. Right?

Michael Cohen’s opening statement for Wednesday’s Oversight &amp; Reform Committee hearing rings true w/all we know &amp; will land like a bomb in Trumpworld. Trump &amp; his minions had no problem w/Cohen lying to protect Trump. Now, they’re desperate to silence him. https://t.co/GRurlxLEcW

@AnnCoulter Ann Coulter exposes the continuing fraud of the right wing: using this spectacle as a means to shut down or discredit all credible grievances of the disenfranchised, minority, poor, etc. She’s trying to create more space for hate, just as @realDonaldTrump has.
The lamest part of the US Justice Dept’s rule that a sitting president can’t be indicted is the notion that a president should not be taken away from his important duties to defend a criminal prosecution. W/Trump, an indictment would merely cut into his executive time &amp; tweets.
@CalbuzzBlog But also that he is a threat to our democracy, he has lied and obstructed his way thru his term, and if he wins will show us what a true American autocrat is. We can’t let him off the hook just because the concept may be so far out that some may discount his treachery.

@chucktodd @SenatorDurbin ‘These leaders’ are not in quotations, so the phrase is your construct. So, you could’ve said “these dictators” or “these strongmen” or “these authoritarian leaders”. These are choices you make that soften the reality of Trump’s authoritarian inclinations.

@JillWineBanks @cocktailsat51 @lauferlaw Can someone lay out an argument for indicting a president, taking into consideration the Justice department ‘s advisory/rule prohibiting an indictment? Is it just that the Constitution is silent?
@KenDilanianNBC Obama was working from a (now obsolete) sense of political propriety. If he wanted to exploit the scandal, he could’ve gone public. But, he worried about the perception of tilting the scales. I think he should’ve  put his thumb on scales, but his actions were hardly ‘shameful.”
It just gets more &amp; more salacious/bizarre.

@GOPChairwoman @cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump you misspelled "another strong racist".
@ktumulty Yes. It means we have an incoherent, mush-brained, low IQ, unschooled, incurious, lazy, arrogant, overblown, sloth-like orangutan for a president.
@debbieduncan @RedHourBen @maddow I'm just starting it up -- tho, i started with Episode 6 last night, and went back to the start tonight. Great untold history being unearthed, so relevant today.
@Mimirocah1 I go straight to obstruction of justice on this one.
@hankschulman @LJSearles @javachik sorry. Was thinking of this one, by RoadToPower: https://t.co/kMjP0vFUeR	Which wasn't as bad as the one Johnson helped pay for: https://t.co/BrYbbXINI7
@scottst @hankschulman @SFGiants being as though you describe yourself as a moderate fascist, this makes sense.
@LJSearles @javachik @hankschulman yes, he'd made another contribution to a Republican admaker, who put out a racist robocall in the Abrams for Gov (Ga) race.
@hankschulman two hours before the polls close? I'm sure his money and his wife's money (nearly $11,000) did enough damage. And, are we going to see the report that shows Hyde-Smith does return the money?
@realDonaldTrump If it's a "phony" witch hunt, what are you worried about?
@JeremyBWhite @katieporteroc @KatieHill4CA @HarleyRouda @MikeLevinCA @GilCisnerosCA @joshua_harder @NancyPelosi Right. That's why i @joshua_harder. He needs to hear this (in case his handlers haven't figured it out).
@JeremyBWhite @katieporteroc @KatieHill4CA @HarleyRouda @MikeLevinCA @GilCisnerosCA @joshua_harder Why would @Joshua_Harder worry about being tied to @NancyPelosi ? He won in an anti-Trump wave, and will win in 2020 on another anti-Trump wave. Pelosi will not be on the ticket in '20. Try as they might to make Pelosi the issue, Reeps won't be able to steer the glare from Trump.

Media calls for Dems who flipped seats this year to walk on eggshells are getting it wrong. Those same Dems who took Reep seats will be riding another anti-Trump wave in 2020. No need for Dems to be scared of own shadow.
@johnmyers Dems elected to flip seats in 2018 need only to remain anti-Trump in 2020. No need for Dems to tiptoe around Trump. None.
@AdamSchiff @chucktodd , hope you're paying attention. Also, to add to your point board, in which you had Ds &amp; Rs tied (and denied that a Blue Wave happened), Dems flipped 7 gov'ships and hundreds of state legislative seats. Hence, yes, a Blue Wave.
@ClareDevereaux @hankschulman Hank has been straight down the middle on this.
@astros "who'll" be missed, not "that" will be missed. "That" is for objects. "Who" is for people. thank you very much.
@hankschulman I don't know about the candidate making "no such statement." Her "public hanging" comment is conceivably blatantly racist, if you delve into the historic meaning of the casual use of the language. It's so steeped in Mississippi's culture that she didn't know how offensive it is.
@atrupar @chucktodd @chucktodd also both-sided the Blue Wave, only crediting Dems for 38-40 House seats &amp; winning Ntl House popular vote (2), giving Reeps points for adding 2 Sen seats &amp; winning Fla/Ga govships (2). A tie! No mention of 7 new Gov wins for Dems or 100s of legisl seats that went blue.

@matthewjdowd The most likely factor will be Trump himself, just as the midterms were a rebuke to him.
@KwikWarren Does he do race? That would be your answer.
@elainaplott And only five newly elected members (out of 37)  from a group that says the Dems' new majority came on the shoulders of candidates who won by calling for change.
@rickhasen @late @CharlesPPierce A perfectly reasonable case. Cool the rhetoric, seek change. I don't think this equates to "wait your turn." I think it's to ensure that legitimate cries of voter suppression are not intermingled with Trumpian charges that "the fix is in."
@CNN Comedy is dead.
@KevinLiao_ This is such a wrong and myopic take. I didn't say it's "bad" that Dems won. i said we should acknowledge the bipartisan spirit that Baker brought. If you can't tip your cap to a quality foe, then you may need to examine your partisan purity.

@EJames342 @hankschulman Analytics has suffused the way managers do their job. Everyone has their eye on pitch count, third time around the lineup, etc. So, at the faint suggestion to "watch me," Roberts jumped. Hill said later he still felt strong. Miscommunication + analytics = blunder.

@LowellCohn Yeah, she's not being literal. She was basically talking abt who would gain from the blue wave. Hey, a little disagreement like this ain't no problem btwn us. Now, if you were to say you're a Trumper, I'd still love you but would be deeply saddened &amp; would wonder what went wrong.
@LowellCohn Ok. I did. And as I suspected, an AP Fact Check (i tweeted to you) shows Kemp took her comments out of context. She was listing a litany of marginalized groups who would be part of a blue wave &amp; included undocumented. But she wasn't saying literally she wanted to have them vote.

@LowellCohn Even if I'm wrong, i believe her instinct is for enfranchisement. Kemp's fundamental betrayal to voters of Georgia is his longstanding campaign to disenfranchise people. You may not like her but if you're for Kemp you are for voter suppression.
@ExamineBaseball The fire story was poignant. He spoke of actually going AWOL with a Mets teammate -- angered over something management had done. Told us of how reverent he was toward Ted Williams, who'd take batting practice til his hands bled, and who took Pumpsie under his wing as a rookie.
@LowellCohn I don't think she advocated allowing people to vote illegally. I think she advocates registering everyone who would legally be able to vote.

@hooverwhalen Graham is indeed leading Reeps  at these hearings-- right over the cliff.
Prosecutor Mitchell's questioning -- focusing on Reeps' unhealthy obsession with conspiracy rather than Kavanaugh's actions -- is increasingly cringeworthy.
Wow. Lindsey Graham is going forward w/his full crazy. After all that Ford has said, all the emotions she brought out in her testimony, and the credibility she built, he still thinks Kavanaugh should be confirmed. He's unmoved. Hoping other Reeps are actually listening to Ford.

@hankschulman Paper boy? Do those exist any more? (I was one for the Berkeley Gazette, 1971; and Oakland Tribune, 1974).
3) So, even as the accusations pile up, with an undeniable consistency that paints a dark picture of their nominee, Reeps have backed selves into a corner. Question is: what finally breaks the dam? Or, will we really go forward w/the most tarnished Supreme Court pick in history?
2) And Reeps can't get past the gaps in these women's stories, even tho it's reasonable that you'd recall a shocking incident but not necessarily remember how you got there or whose house it was. They've become blinded, instead, by seeing this as a purely political war.
1) Reeps r convinced these sexual misconduct charges vs Kavanaugh are a conspiracy to kill his nomination. Why? Because there are so many and details are so shocking. And bc they're coming out so late. But GOP aren't getting it that it's classic that victims of abuse r reticent.
@CillizzaCNN In a rambling, incoherent display that had millions Googling the 25th Amendment, President Donald Trump used his first press conference in 700 days to bash George Washington, women, the New York Times and others while defending a man who's been accused of sexual misconduct.

@carmenkiew Hunter Pence's passion for the game was great for SF. But, his numbers tell a story of mediocrity: He came to SF as a .290 hitter (943 for 3,254). As a Giant, he has hit .268 (755 for 2,812). B4 SF, his Slg %: .481; after: .433. Out of 7 yrs, got 2 good years from him ('13-'14).
@carmenkiew Ok, so throw out his 10-for-58 (.172) start in first 17 games, playing while his thumb was hurt. He's still just a .250 hitter since (40-for-161). Ok, so he was getting infrequent starts. Last year, he hit .260 as a regular w/13 HR, 67 RBI. Love Pence, but he's past his prime.

@kasie Did your editors let you know you went over the line on this post? Hey, i am all for more interpretive journalism in this day of Trump, but not by injecting your own religious beliefs. P.S. Try using Dem sources for your insider takes. Tiresome to see only Reep takes from you.

@KeyesBill I think the Giants would have acquired Yelich if they'd ever had the opportunity. They knew what kind of star he'd be. He was not missed out on. He just couldn't be gotten, at least with anything the Giants ever had to offer.
@JohnJHarwood the fruits of distraction.
@KeyesBill The two are not related. Of course the Giants would have loved to obtain Yelich. But, the Marlins had their eye on what the Brewers had to offer: 4 prospects. It has to do with the relative strength of their farm systems. SF just didn't have what Fla wanted.

@PavlovicNBCS Bochy's reply is weak. Why was his top priority to get the bullpen into the game? Did he not see what was going on before him? Suarez was in a groove. A CG was to be had. Why not let Suarez try to clear this high bar in a low-stress game so that later, it's not foreign territory?
We could only wish. Alas, Trump/Reeps are far too scorched earth to make this kind of sense. https://t.co/YzjUmJz52R
@PavlovicNBCS Weird move by Bochy to take Suarez out. What was his explanation?
Maybe I don't know the capacity for hubris that Kavanaugh has, but I'm betting we will not have that Senate Judiciary hearing on Monday. Republicans will take a pass on a shameful spectacle and Kavanaugh withdraws his nomination before Monday.
@hankschulman Way to inject drama into an inning.
@hankschulman Why not let Suarez try for a CG? Only 87 pitches thru 7 2/3. Don't get Bochy's mindset other than he is sadly typical when it comes to over-relying on relief pitchers. Think Matt Moore vs. Cubs, playoffs 2016.
@hankschulman Hey, quilters can be scary. Don't take this threat lightly. 😜
@Mimirocah1 What i told @DomenicoNPR.
Christine Blasey Ford emerges to tell her story, which appears legitimate. Kavanaugh had 65 women from his high school years at the ready to stand by him: an admission he knew this was coming. His Supreme Court nomination should be in grave doubt.  https://t.co/C71PhJyGC3
@baseballmarty Throw out 1 bad start vs. Stl &amp; today's Colo starter Senzatela has a 3.18 ERA over his last 6 starts. His 5.01 overall ERA is misleading. And SF has a way of making mid-level pitchers look Cy Youngish. Rodriguez may finally falter, so, I'm predicting a 5-3 Colo win. Rockies K 7x.

@DomenicoNPR Republicans would put up a false narrative that media feels forced to report, even if logically it has no credibility. GOP is great at exploiting media's desire to be fair and "objective" (even at the expense of truth).
@DomenicoNPR Were these women at the site of the alleged Kavanaugh sexual misconduct? No? So, what relevance are they to this case?
@DMWeintraub I'm thinking @realDonaldTrump will be dropping his pardon plans now that Manafort has signed onto cooperation duties with Mueller.
@KenDilanianNBC Manafort must not have believed he'd be pardoned. Or Manafort values dropped charges on hung-jury counts &amp; guilty plea to others  in exchange for not having to endure another costly trial. This shows the power and strength of Mueller's case, boding dark days for @realDonaldTrump.

@mindyfinn It would hurt, if that was truly what they elected him for. But, I'd say the reason it doesn't hurt is they elected him 'cause he mostly channeled their racist hatreds/biases, which he continues to deliver. They also like his disregard for truths that they themselves don't like.

It's almost as if all those in @realDonaldTrump 's orbit -- Michael Cohen, Omarosa, Packer, Weisselberg &amp; others -- knew the law would catch up with them so became experts at archiving incriminating evidence on Trump's criminal enterprises to insulate themselves from charges.
If @realDonaldTrump gets impeached 	A) Everybody would be poor	B) the American people would revolt	C) Putin would weep	D) Pence would dance his first jig	E) Giuliani would run for the hills 	F) Fox News would explode	F) Our Long National Nightmare would be over
@MalcolmNance Now, Trump is going halfway around the world, and dipping deep into nutso racist conspiracy theories, to whip up his white nationalist supporters into a frothy frenzy.
Giuliani is playing with fire.  Almost as if he is partnering with Trump in tearing down our institutions, trampling on our Constitution and paving the way for authoritarian rule. What's Trump/Putin got on Giuliani? https://t.co/9nDFnZ0bU3
@KO_Crowley Marichal's No. 1 spot is safe.
And these are extraordinary times. Why should we abide by Justice Department guidelines -- no more than accepted norms -- when dealing with a President who has done nothing but shatter all our cherished norms? https://t.co/YwugGkCHOP
@wendythurm what happened?
@KO_Crowley Belt ar 2b could've been as intriguing as Huff at 2b. Tho, I'm confident Belt would cover the bag on a DP ground ball.
@PavlovicNBCS @hankschulman Sad. He has become one of my favorites. Such a professional. Hope fans who look at his batting average understand he leads the NL in At'em Balls. His RF defense was brilliant at times, always steady. I imagine he was a leader in the clubhouse-- the younger guys looked up to him.
@washingtonpost @MaxBoot Now?
Consistent with his refusal to be interviewed by Mueller lest he fall into a perjury trap. He telegraphs his guilt every day. https://t.co/j0mYCuRu1g

@MiekeEoyang @Reuters it's almost as if some in the press try to goad Trump for the sake of a good story.
@JohnJHarwood it did.
@realDonaldTrump Is there a meme on this yet? "I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious &amp; unpleasant consequences to obstructing justice &amp; ordering your Fixer to cover up sexual affairs. If there were no serious consequences, our country would be overrun by fraudsters &amp; demagogues.
@tamarakeithNPR a fitting metaphor.
@realDonaldTrump's rally tonight might be must-see TV. If you're into watching live meltdowns.
@PoloGrounds483 it's a lefty NY Mets P and a day off for Buster.
Parallel/merging universes in world of crime &amp; punishment? The CA Legislature is debating bail reform on same day that ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is convicted on 8 counts of various frauds and Trump "fixer" Michael Cohen pleads guilty to 8 counts of various frauds.
@CalbuzzBlog He also has an upcoming trial in DC.

@LowellCohn On a scale of 1-10, a five. He can't hit for the offense or pitch, but the team seems lethargic, a reflection on him.
@LowellCohn Question is: what's their value? What can they get in return?
@KO_Crowley Which means Bumgarner needs to hit a HR to support his shutout.
@chucktodd Does Trump deliberately project?
@baseballmarty @KO_Crowley @Boomskie @Bruce_Jenkins1 Was fhat the Ivie grand slam game? What a thrill. Giants were pretty damn good that year, many dramatic moments.
All we need is for the president to resign, and the set is complete! https://t.co/WbuQIcdu0x
@LowellCohn Yet, the Giants will sign Bumgarner to a huge Matt Cain-style contract to reward him for his past accomplishments. And lose out on what that money could've been used for in player development.
@KO_Crowley Maybe Bochy should consider that this lineup is what it has shown to be all season: ineffectual.
@ChrisMegerian Kinda like waiting on CA budget negotiations pre-Prop. 25 (simple majority vote, 2010).
@baseballmarty Hamilton steals more bases than the Giants score runs.
@hankschulman Well, I guess that somewhat mitigates SFs loss of mini-Pudge.
Retired Navy admiral William McRaven told Trump to revoke his ntl security clearance so he could add his name to the list of men &amp; women who've spoken up against his presidency. Trump "sadly mistaken" if he thinks "McCarthy-era tactics" will silence critics. https://t.co/xPeTM9e9Au

@hankschulman for now.
@hankschulman talk about being boxed in.
@JohnnyBateman7 Spahn, in his later years, but who's counting? Why was Tony Cloninger so tough to hit (6-for-54)?

@LowellCohn 1. Yes (tho, how much would they get in return?).	2. No. Giants should cut ties to their World Series legacy. It's dragging them down. 	3. Add Bumgarner to the offload list.
@PavlovicNBCS Could've used Joey Bart last night in the 8th inning with bases loaded. Let's get that Bart era going! (And please, no lectures on "there's a big difference between rookie ball &amp; MLB.")
@KO_Crowley Start with Bumgarner. He might yield the most in prospects because there's always a team willing to overpay for an established starter. Can't afford to pay him Big Bucks when he is unlikely to regain his form. No more Matt Cain/Barry Zito signings.

@LowellCohn Thank you, Lowell. I missed the Bonds years (in MI '92-'06) so had a detached view of Bonds &amp; others cheating their way into history. When i got back, was stunned to find SF fans so blinded by loyalty to BB. I guess to accept it would be to erase all the emotions spent on Bonds.

MLB All Stars taking selfies during pregame intros was bad enough. But carrying their iPhones onto the field to take photos during play? Then, interviewing hitters as they approached the plate and fielders during the game? Baseball has seriously lost its way.

@karstenerzinger wow. Two. Ok. You've got 3,872 to go.
@karstenerzinger @washingtonpost Amazing that you can remember the one Obama "lie" but probably have forgotten the 3,874 lies of @realDonaldTrump .
@JoeDJustin The point that most are missing, tho, is that Trump couldn't "appear strong" (criticize Putin) because he and Putin both know that Russians conspired with Trump for the W. If the 2 were smart they'd have set up a mock slap down to allay suspicions. Too much ego for that, tho.

@andyfurillo @fredamoon Sorry, I'm not buying this reporter's standards for approval. Pretentious B.S. meant for hipster faddies.
will that really work? Do Michiganians really want a Trumpster as gov? Or are Schuette/GOP so captive of Right Wing forces in primary they have no choice? I mean, Trump barely won MI in '16, &amp; blue wave is poised to wipe out GOP gains. Schuette/GOP will rue this by the fall. https://t.co/Nzs5DPVfFt

@BNightengale mcdowell is not a hall of famer.
@hankschulman First series vs Dodgers that i can recall where the Giants didn't face Kershaw.
@clarkspencer You meant to say: Dodgers played Maybin to hit the other way. Instead, he pulls the ball to the left field corner. The "other way" is always the opposite field, which is to right field for right handers and left field for lefthanders. Baseball language is not to be trifled with.
@manbearwolf A Nationals hitter, Sierra, caught glimpse of a curve ball that Posey was calling in tonight's game. Posey caught the cheating glimpse, changed call to a fastball and Sierra went down looking.
@hankschulman Everything else notwithstanding, he doesn't seem to like to hit in SF. He got AT&amp;Td last night and could be seen looking on in disbelief. And he's hitting about .176 there.
@hankschulman So, the Giants will score 0.6 runs today. Or 12.
@hankschulman Though my first instinct is to say I wish my reporting days were editor-less, I have to admit copy editors earned their paycheck from time to time reading my stuff.
@DavidShuster Wow. You have fallen. Once, a fairly respected journalist. Now, parroting right wing nonsense.
@LowellCohn He ain't.
@hankschulman @KeithOlbermann The question is, did Belt aim at anyone in particular in the stands? Now, that would've been impressive, especially if he could've located a hater or two.

@PavlovicNBCS i.e., we'd rather keep pouring good many after bad w/Pence than give Williamson the break he's earned. He'll probably go the way of A. Duvall, sent to another team to flourish because Bochy &amp; mgmt fail at projecting players into future and are over reliant on a player's history.
@hankschulman @keithlaw With team carrying so many pitchers, it's time to expand rosters to 26 or 27 so we don't get into these predicaments that give an unmatural feel to the game.
@hankschulman That's why it's critical to get it right in real time. Ump actually started to call him safe before switching mid-call. Check it out on your DVR.

@RayWoodson925 That HR to Bailey was the only earned run Regan gave up in all 14 of his wins.
@RayWoodson925 Checking retrosheet. First six wins, didn't allow a run. Seventh win, he did give up a game tying HR (Bob Bailey). 8th win was classic: Koufax goes 11, Ks 16, leaves w/1-1 tie. Vulture pitches one IP, LA scores, he wins.
@RayWoodson925 I wonder how many Ws Regan got after giving up game tying HR?
@MarcosBreton Strickland gets lazy, complacent w/his fastball. He reverts to thinking his stuff is great. Maybe believed the stats (Goldschmidt was hitting a paltry .115), but Goldschmidt is too good to take for granted. This is why Strickland will never be a closer @baseballmarty @LowellCohn

Bochy totally lucked out on that double steal for #SFGiants 4-3 lead. Sending runners on 3-2 count from 1st &amp; 2nd w/1 out risked a SO DP, especially w/Posey as trail runner. Was Bochy that confident Longoria would make contact? Did he know Avila would misfire on throw to 2nd?
@pescami How many pitchers threw 90 mph then, never mind 95-97 mph? How often did Joe D have to face fresh relievers throwing said MPHs in the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th innings? Gotta take into account so many variables to compare stats from differing eras.
@EricBoehlert Just as Putin has something on Trump, Trump has something on Dershowitz.
@hankschulman His ungodly curveball, apparently.
@baseballmarty They also combined to play 46 of 50 players on their active rosters (LA 24, SF 21).
@KO_Crowley Ok. Good to know. So many bad ideas floating around to change this game.
@hankschulman @sfchronicle More teams are running out of bench players earlier than ever because of these 13-man pitching staffs. It's time to expand rosters to 26 or 27. Managers are making more pitching moves, so the game should accommodate this trend.
@KO_Crowley Why introduce this thinking? It's just more tearing the game down, questioning norms. Leave the game alone. In retrospect, would you prefer a tie over a dramatic game-winning home run? Just let the game settle itself without having to tweak each "boring" moment.
@hankschulman These are people who learned the game on Nintendo.
@Yogi47951368 @hankschulman Hope so. But my point was that an American who'd put up Beltre's numbers would have had a much longer love affair with the media than Beltre has.
@hankschulman Shouldn't even be a question. National media is responsible for his relatively low profile.
@KO_Crowley He sure hit pretty dang well despite the injury. Remember, he finished the season hitting about .333 over last two months.
@Buster_ESPN If opponents would just throw a righty against the Giants once in a while, SF could put Pablo in.
@LowellCohn I didn't see your original remarks but I wholeheartedly agree that the overanalysis, hyper data fixation ruins the viewing. Much more enjoyable to listen to the flow of conversation that reflects the joys and pains of a game than to know somebody's damn launch angle.
@toreyvanoot @G_Russo1 wait. does free lancing mean being able to drink on the job? 😏
@hankschulman I love it when your followers trip up over their derisive comments with misspellings AND a total misunderstanding of how you do your job. Great theater.
@acktown916 @premierleague @NBCSN @NBCSportsSoccer @ManCity As a Native Californian, staying up til 1:30 am in the nation's capitol listening to the Giants beat LA 1-0 for a second straight game was worth it.
@Buster_ESPN Panik knew it was out. He just didn't think it would be fair.
@PoloGrounds483 Fleming to start the top of 7th.
@KO_Crowley He'll have to wait another game. Might be waiting until the day he dies.
@PavlovicNBCS Perfect pitch in a perfect game.
@richardjustice @MLB Joe Panik's HR off of baseball's best, Clayton Kershaw, for a 1-0 Giants win over rival Dodgers ain't nothin' to sneeze at. And Opening Day fill in Ty Blach's five shutout innings, followed by four more goose eggs by a revamped bullpen certainly is worth a mention.
@Buster_ESPN A followup tweet would be that Panik cheated on an inside pitch very nicely, indeed.
@LowellCohn After one minute, i turned down sound, listened to Miller and Kuiper on radio.
@ChrisMegerian Is irony featured in this post? Hoping.
@baseballmarty Who knows how long a pitcher can sustain good performances?  		Remember, Moore had great games, even great stretches within games that often included 1-inning blowups to undermine good work. 		Holland is coming off a worse year than Moore. So, I'd say, patience, @baseballmarty.

Haven't heard from @realDonaldTrump in two days as Mueller's noose tightened this week. Awaiting a stream of invective tweets to distract from Gates plea deal and Manafort indictments.
@amjoyshow @sarahkendzior Eye opening analysis on the gates/manafort &amp; kushner segments. Truly stunning that Kushner appears to profile out as a White House mole -- that he would use his access, i.e., pass along vital secrets -- to profit so he can clear a multimillion dollar debt on his NY property
@MichaelWolffNYC @Aiannucci @Waterstones Loving the hell out of yr book, @MichaelWolffNYC Critics miss the fact that your book's central aim was to capture the essence of Trump, the pure incompetence, the  B-team blunders, the compilation of backstabbing, small minded fools, hangers on &amp; folks in way over their heads.
@leftcoastbabe Republican response: ok, we're hypocrites. Our m.o. is all about power. Get over it.
what an ass. @realDonaldTrump has no idea how anyone would respond to a military kill zone. I am confident Donnie would have cowered in a corner. https://t.co/gTnbTo6s1D
@debbieduncan of course they have to cover him as president. He's the most layered character we've had in the White House, with So. Much. Promise. for readable copy. You just don't have to air his speeches from wire to wire on TV.
@JeremyBWhite BS. Ridiculous comparison. I didn't say don't cover Trump. You don't have to air live the speech in its entirety to cover the news.
@JeremyBWhite That'd be a good first step. But, c'mon. They covered his campaign speeches the same. You can cover high or low lights with discretion, report the newsworthy, but don't just given him an open platform. This is no ordinary president. He openly lies, etc.
@leftcoastbabe @realDonaldTrump would've cowered behind the stairwells just the same.
And yet it was covered wire to wire by the cables. Why do news orgs give him time of day? https://t.co/7BxmaPAF45
@hankschulman not only a piece of garbage but an extremist nut job. Pretty soon, he'll be caught up in the Mueller investigation for laundering millions in Russian $$.

#SFGiants Hunter Pence embarks on 8-game road trip with @RiverCats teammates to Las Vegas &amp; Albuquerque. Has gone 1-for-8 in rehab stint.
Leave it to Juan Perez, who gets game-winning RBI double to LF to plate Ehire Adrianza for 5-4 #RiverCats win. Hunter Pence left on deck.
@adlerben yep. And Ishikawa caps off the #SFGiants contribution with a K, stranding runners at 1st and third.
Hunter Pence pops out with runners at first and third, failing to bring home tying run. Up to Ishikawa. #SFGiants
Hunter Pence, after walking, scores from first for 2nd time in row, this time on rehabbing Travis Ishikawa's double. #SFGiants
#SFGiants Hunter Pence gets 1st hit in rehab stint, sharp 1b to LF, then scores on Adam Duvall 2b to LF corner. Pence now 1-for-7 in Sac.
Early #Sacramento Rivercats start and #SFGiants Hunter Pence already has an AB: ground out to third. He's now 0-for-6 in his rehab stint.
And w/ 2 outs in bottom of 17th, Rivercats have no one to go to but P Clay Rapada, who... gets a base hit to center field to keep it alive!
The guy who'd gone 0-for-7 hits the go-ahead HR in top of 17th off Rivercats P Clay Rapada, who hadn't yielded a run all year. Go figure.
P Blach &amp; OF Jarrett Parker keep switching between LF &amp; RF, depending on lefty/righty hitter. So far, it hasn't backfired. Onto bottom 15th.
In 15th inn, #Sacramento Rivercats P Ty Blach comes in to play LF; OF Juan Perez moves to 3b. Let's see if their defense comes into play.
RiverCats pitcher Steven Okert hits for self; bigger ? is which pitcher comes in to play a position. Unless Pence or Ishikawa volunteer.
And now w/Triunfel just tossed from game, RiverCats can't afford going to 15th inning.
River Cats heading to 14th inning, w/only Ishikawa &amp; Pence on bench w/pitcher's spot due, but mgr Mariano has avoided using them to this pt.
#SFGiants Hunter Pence gets the day off today, which might be news to the capacity crowd at Raley Field. Day game after night game on rehab.
@debbieduncan Pence is going to need some time. He really is trying to catch a speeding train from a standing start.
Late Hunter Pence roundup: 0-for-3. Flies out, reaches on E6 (later thrown out at plate on close play) and K's after nice 8-pitch battle).
@AlexPavlovic @RiverCats he looked pretty good tonight. Two runs in five IP, showed 91-92 on fastball, good control. Lots of promise.
#SFGIANTS Hunter Pence, on 3-2 count, strikes out into double play. Swung &amp; missed at 3 sliders. That's what this rehab stint is all about.
@debbieduncan he's third up this inning. Stay tuned!
Meanwhile, in Hunter Pence's shadow, Adam Duvall hits 9th HR (2nd in PCL) to give @RiverCats a 3-0 lead over Albuquerque in 5th.
#SFGiants Hunter Pence update from #Sacramento: 0-for-1 w/sac fly &amp; RBI. One nice running catch. Several ovations. Maybe 1 more AB left.

@debbieduncan Yes, Duffy is a gem. But he's not a long-term solution for 3b.
@Bruce_Jenkins1 @extrabaggs Adam Duvall has looked very good @ 3b and has hit a ton in Sacramento. Clutch HRs, oppo field power. He's ready.

#Sacramento Rivercats' Adam Duvall continues to make case for spot on #SFGiants: HRs for 3rd straight game (7 overall) to tie it in 9th.
Well, maybe Kevin Correia won't be replacing #SFgiants P Ryan Vogelsong any time soon. On his 1st pitch at AAA #Sacramento, he gives up HR.
Adam Duvall ends 1-for-14 skid with mammoth HR (#5 on the yr) to give #Sacramento Rivercats 3-1 lead. He's now hitting .370. #SFGiants
Jarrett Parker, whose nickname is "Inside The" after hitting an inside the parker 2 games ago, is now hitting .328 (21 for 64). #SFGiants
#Sacramento Rivercats' OF Jarrett Parker continues onslaught: went 3 for 5 w/3 RBI last nite (including game-winning hit), is 8 for last 10.
Any room in #SFGiants OF? #Sacramento Rivercats' Jarrett Parker 2 more hits &amp; RBI. Is 6 for last 7 w/6 RBI. Now hitting .311 w/6 HR 19 RBI.
Ex-Rivercat, Cal product John @manbearwolf Baker makes return to Sac as a Tacoma Rainier w/ex-bat boy as teammate. https://t.co/ZNtzQUw9xM
W/#SFGiants idle, #Sacramento Rivercats fill the void w/6-2 win over Tacoma. End 6-game skid behind Jarrett Parker (4-for4, 2 HR, 4 RBI).
Thru 6, Ty Blach held Tacoma to 1 run, 3 hits. ERA down to more respectable 4.56. Rivercats lead, 6-1, try to stop 6-game skid. #SFGiants
Jarrett Parker hits 2nd HR of day (6th of yr), an inside-the-park blast that hits top of CF wall and bounces 50 feet back to infield.
OF Jarrett Parker hits a 3-run HR, his team-leading 5th of '15. Remember, he was called up to SFGiants for 1 day last yr, never got to play.
LHP Ty Blach gets nod for Rivercats. Top #SFGiants prospect has gotten off to slow start: 0-2 w/5.60 ERA. Zero BBs but 26 H in 17.2 IP.
If #SFGiants fans are looking for starting pitching help, it's not coming soon from #Sacramento Rivercats. Starters' combined ERA: 6.43.
Susac shows why he's #SFGiants top prospect w/HR. But he wasn't the best hitter in #Sacramento. @aduvall123 is. Hitting .424 thru 16 games.
@timkawakami man, you are prickly. One comment and you block? A little defensive. Good riddance.
@timkawakami praise? Of course not! Just love the fickleness of fans and observers alike.
@timkawakami hmm. This string got pretty quiet and short.
Rubby is pitching to Tuffy against the #SFGiants tonight. Duffy is on bench for SF. Pretty sure that's advantage Giants.
@debbieduncan Perry puts you @ ease w/his droll humor &amp; great stories. He does 2/3 events w/#SFGiants but would love more of a role.
Had the privilege of talking to venerable #SFGiants HOFer Gaylord Perry tonite at Raley Field in #Sacramento. http://t.co/aSoLMysvqV
@debbieduncan Not so bad down here overall, tho. Rivercats are 4-2 on the year and have taken a 4-3 lead in 6th.
RT @thehill: Low-wage workers nationwide push for $15 an hour: http://t.co/nATUwn3IaN #FightFor15 #TaxDay http://t.co/DKrCdXRSmz
I jinxed 'em. Duvall, hitting .478 w/team leading 6 RBI thru six games, grounds into 1-2-3 double play and @Rivercats come up empty in 1st.
The #SFGiants could use some of this: @Rivercats have loaded bases on hits by Adrianza, Susac &amp; Bowker. Adam Duval is up...
And Susac shows immediately that his finger is fine: he guns out runner trying to steal third in 1st inning. @RiverCats #SFGiants
Susac is bac(k)! After missing three games with a finger injury, #SFGiants catching prospect returns to the @RiverCats lineup today.

#SFGiants AAA club, Sac Rivercats take three of four from Salt Lake with 7-2 win, after 18-inning marathon 6-5 win last night (Parker slam).
@debbieduncan thanks, Debbie. Perez is now 0-for-19. Maybe one or two hard hit balls among mostly desultory ABs.
#SFGiants fans hoping to see Juan Perez back up soon: ain't happening. He's 0-for-his-1st-17 for Sac Rivercats. Tho, defense still sparkles.
Scary moment for #SFGiants fans in Sac: catcher Andrew Susac leaves game after taking a foul ball off throwing hand. Waiting for results.
“Tell it good-bye." Lon Simmons, Giants PBP great, dies at 91. Sad to hear. I developed lifelong passion w/baseball listening to Lon.
@AlexPavlovic making a case for his old job. Has Bochy indicated he is open to Romo's return as closer?
@hankschulman I wonder if it's a move he wanted to make; allows him to avoid politically incorrect move of DFA'ing Ishi. For now. Buys time.

Can't believe they didn't go to Marshawn Lynch. A 1/2 yard away &amp; you pass? Too clever by half. What a game, what an ending. What a #SBXLIX.
Such a pleasure to have Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth calling #SuperBowlXLIX as opposed to the bombastic Buck/Aikman duo.
Chris "Hardball" Mathews: Has there ever been a player to have such an impact on a #SuperBowl w/out a single catch previously in his career?
@ssharmon yes, i intentionally overlooked the sponsor and simply enjoyed the voice and sentiment.
It's been 25 years now since I covered my only Super Bowl, XXIV. I can say that New Orleans should be the only place the SB shud be played.
