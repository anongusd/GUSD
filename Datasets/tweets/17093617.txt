@AdobeExpCloud A8. Give your customers a reason to shop with you. 		What makes you different? What is your value? Tell your brand's story! You need the foot traffic or the web traffic to drive sales. It's time to get people through the door üôå #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A7. Predictive analytics will help retail buyers bring in the right amount of stock. Personalization will allow for brands to target groups of people with marketing that is relevant and interesting to them üëç #AdobeChat
@BarrettAll @GooseIsland That was so fun to follow online. Such a great idea on their part. We would've made the field goal though üòâ #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A6. Having the right location is a key factor. If you're not accessible to your target audience and the foot traffic isn't there, you're likely going to struggle. Offering an exceptional customer experience is another thing you can do, as a brick and mortar brand. #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A5. There's a very good chance that your target audience has a mobile phone. If you can directly engage them without them being in your brick and mortar store, that sounds pretty good to us! Take advantage and build mobile campaigns to reach your audience #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A4. Your customers are the people you want to keep happy if you want to stay in business. Give them a reason to come back. Make their experience with your brand so exceptional that they want to tell their friends about it! #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A3. Competing with online brands must be one. There are so many options for consumers to buy from online - how can you make your brand stand out from the rest? #AdobeChat
@AdobeExpCloud A2. In regards to retail experiences consumers expect to find information about the products they want to purchase. They'll look for forums, ask friends and families, post to social about it. Consumers want to be informed before they buy. Social media makes that easier #AdobeChat
@KathleenOcon105 Congrats, Kathleen! *High Five*
@AdobeExpCloud A1. Instagram and Pinterest are two things that come to mind. Social shopping is coming in hot! #AdobeChat

@blythecwilson @ClkContrl That's a really great point! We wonder what are some ways to make that happen #HootChat
Q7. What would you like to see more of from holiday campaigns? #HootChat https://t.co/wltZEPsVw7
@wearelittletzu That's a good point. It's a nice idea to have a holiday campaign that doesn't tie back to sales (or something along those lines) but most of the time it isn't realistic #HootChat
@imaginativegrp For sure. It doesn't necessarily what emotion you make someone feel as long as you do make them FEEL something #HootChat
Q6. What should the main objective of your holiday social media campaign be? #HootChat https://t.co/PST8AiseZ9
Q5. Which emotions do you think drive the most interest from a campaign? #HootChat https://t.co/G5swq27icS
@JenniferBakerCo Yep! Definitely don't want to sound desperate. Nobody likes that #HootChat
@TheDrawShop Oh boy, thanks for the warning! #HootChat
Q4. What is it that makes that campaign stand out from the rest? #HootChat https://t.co/dU9VkbSIM3
@TheDrawShop We'll have to look that one up! #HootChat
@JenniferBakerCo @WestJet Oooh, great choice. Those ones really pull at the heart strings! #HootChat
Q3. What is the best holiday campaign you've seen? #HootChat https://t.co/5HttVXBXDw
@TheDrawShop @bluespinweb We definitely agree. Driving sales is a key part of the holiday campaign season BUT if your campaign can help you generate customers for life because you show that you care? That's much more valuable than a single purchase. #HootChat
@JenniferBakerCo Well said. Personalize your campaign to the audience that you are targeting üëç #HootChat
@wearelittletzu Get that money! #HootChat
@BV_DigitalBuzz Very cool! That definitely would have been a fun day #HootChat
