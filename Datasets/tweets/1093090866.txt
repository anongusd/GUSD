I am confident that we can serve our men and women in uniform and our veterans as well as they have served this country. ‚ÄîThe First Lady
If you‚Äôre a woman veteran, I want to ask you to stand tall and share your story. ‚ÄîThe First Lady #WomenVets
If you‚Äôre a healthcare provider, make sure every veteran gets the care they‚Äôre entitled to. ‚ÄîThe First Lady #WomenVets
If you‚Äôre a CEO, a hiring manager, raise the bar and commit to employing more women veterans. ‚ÄîThe First Lady #WomenVets
If you‚Äôre a member of Congress, work with us to ensure that all of our veterans get the support they deserve. ‚ÄîThe First Lady #WomenVets
Today, I want to challenge everyone ‚Äì to take action on behalf of our women veterans. ‚ÄîThe First Lady on supporting our #WomenVets.
We all have a role to play in supporting our #WomenVets. Every single one of us needs to step up and do our part. ‚ÄîThe First Lady
We set up a Women Veterans Call Center ‚Äì staffed entirely by women ‚Äì to answer questions for women veterans. ‚ÄîThe First Lady #WomenVets
Over the past seven years, we‚Äôve trained 2,400 veteran healthcare providers in women‚Äôs health. ‚ÄîThe First Lady honoring #WomenVets
Women have sacrificed so much ‚Äî they should never have to hide their accomplishments. ‚ÄîThe First Lady on telling the story of our #WomenVets
One striking reality is that many women veterans don‚Äôt even self-identify as veterans. ‚ÄîThe First Lady honoring #WomenVets
