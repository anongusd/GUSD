We’re barreling toward a Trump shutdown in hours. Yet Rules Committee Republicans literally used emergency procedures to bring up a bill today... on cheese. They don’t have time to discuss keeping the lights on, but cheese ranks as a national emergency. Are you kidding me? https://t.co/tbHmfposii
“How about we try to walk and eat cheese at the same time? Maybe we can do this ridiculous bill, and at the same time pass the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously.”- @RepMcGovern just now in the Rules Committee https://t.co/RXgNMF6BdX
“That’s right. Homeland Security personnel will have to go to work, without being paid. And the GOP is holding an emergency meeting… literally on cheese curds.”  - @RepMcGovern just now in the Rules Committee https://t.co/QUi69aERgO
“I’ve seen some surreal things around this place, but this is really something. Vital parts of our government are about to shut down in just a few hours, and the Republicans have called an emergency meeting… On cheese.” -@RepMcGovern just now in the Rules Committee https://t.co/eZBnRWGpsU
Something smells in this Congress, and it’s the @HouseGOP calling an emergency meeting of the Rules Committee just 8 hours away from a #TrumpShutdown…. On CHEESE. https://t.co/5qjLohGlQW

“It would repeal the Johnson Amendment prohibiting houses of worship from endorsing or opposing a political candidate. It would add another $100 billion to the national debt. And it doesn’t even help working Americans!” @RepMcGovern just now in the Rules Committee

Today @RepMcGovern called for a return to regular order and a more accommodating process. https://t.co/or07WhraQA
Today, instead of working to avert another government shutdown @HouseGOP made a last-ditch effort to ram through a partisan tax bill that doubles down on the abysmal process Republicans used to draft their first #TaxScam. Naturally @RepMcGovern had a thing or two to say about it. https://t.co/LErSZBTZO2
“We have more important things to do. It’s long past time the Majority stopped their obsession with tax cuts for their wealthy corporate friends. Let’s finally get our priorities in order.”  -@RepMcGovern just now
“President Trump continues to threaten to hold the nation hostage to his immoral and expensive border wall. I remember when he promised Mexico was going to pay for it! But now, if taxpayers aren’t put on the hook, we’re facing another Republican shutdown.” -@RepMcGovern just now
“We are 6 legislative days away from a possible government shutdown. Six! There are seven appropriations bills left to sign into law. Why is the Majority spending what little legislative time we have left on a bill like this instead of trying to keep the lights on?” -@RepMcGovern
“The third time isn’t a charm, Mr. Chairman. It’s an outrage. This 300-page giveaway to the wealthy was drafted in the middle of the night and behind closed doors. Democrats weren’t consulted. There’s no CBO score. There wasn’t even a hearing or a markup.” @RepMcGovern just now
“We are considering yet another bill that doubles down on the abysmal Republican tax scam that showered benefits on the rich. A plan that added nearly $2 trillion to the deficit &amp; endangered the future of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.” -@RepMcGovern just now at Rules
A majority of voters agree that increased wall funding isn’t worth a shutdown. The president should listen &amp; instead work to build bipartisan consensus on immigration, including on border security.
The GOP’s reckless 2013 government shutdown cost our economy 120,000 jobs and $24 billion. We can’t afford a repeat all because of President Trump’s immoral, expensive, and ineffective border wall.
Thanks to @HouseGOP’s failure to govern, Congress now has less than two weeks to finish funding the government and avert another Republican shutdown. But @POTUS has sabotaged multiple opportunities to reach a consensus holding our government hostage to his border wall boondoggle.

101 Dalmatians may be cute, but shutting down debate 101 times is not.

“This is bad policy. And it’s going to hit the middle class the hardest while the wealthy get a windfall. I think the voters are going to see through this second tax scam just like they have with the first.” @RepMcgovern now in the Rules Committee on @HouseGOP's Tax 2.0
“Mitch McConnell proclaimed nine months ago...“If we can’t sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work.” Well with polling like what we’re seeing, many members of the Majority are afraid they’ll be forced to do exactly what Mitch McConnel suggested”
"Your tax law is wildly unpopular. A poll commissioned by the RNC of all groups showed that 61 percent of respondents thought the GOP tax scam benefited, quote 'large corporations and rich Americans over middle class families.'" @RepMcGovern now in the Rules Committee
"The first Republican tax scam temporarily limited the State and Local Tax Deduction. 2.0 would make that permanent undermining funding for priorities like schools, firefighters, and police officers." @RepMcGovern now in the Rules Committee
"After Republicans exploded the deficit, President Trump's chief economic advisor is now calling for new cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Are you kidding me?" @RepMcGovern now in the Rules Committee
"CBO found recently that Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have blown a $900 billion hole in the federal budget. The deficit will increase by nearly 32 percent this year. A main reason for that is your horrible tax bill." @RepMcGovern just now in Rules
“Your first tax scam added $2.3 trillion to the national debt to give the wealthy and big corporations huge tax cuts. 2.0 would add another $3 trillion to the debt to again reward the wealthy and the well-connected.” @RepMcgovern just now in the Rules Committee
The Rules Committee will meet at today at 3pm on H.R. 6756, H.R. 6757 H.R. 6760. Taken together these bills form the Republicans’ Tax 2.0 package that would add another $3.2 trillion to the deficit. Tune in LIVE:	https://t.co/3mjZaskjzq

“Why don’t we instead do something of real substance for a change? Like lowering healthcare costs, or dealing with the high cost of prescription drugs, increasing wages, or rebuilding our infrastructure, or at the very least keeping the government open?” @RepMcGovern just now
“The House is in session for just 11 days before funding for the government expires, and not a single appropriations bill has been signed into law. We have a lot of work to do in a short period of time.” @RepMcGovern just now in the Rules Committee

Only 11 legislative days before our government runs out of money. But instead of working to avert another #GovernmentShutdown, @HouseGOP is wasting precious time prioritizing small-scale bills like HR4505 and HR1655. The Rules Committee will meet on these bills tonight at 5pm.

@RepMcGovern: Ask beneficiaries if they’d prefer the $1.40 per meal that SNAP provides or a good job that with a living wage. “I can guarantee you that they would resoundingly say they would prefer to work in well-paying jobs.”
@RepMcGovern: “Those who participate in SNAP for longer periods are children, seniors, or are disabled.”
@RepMcGovern: “Nearly three-quarters of adults who participate in #SNAP in a typical month work in either that month or within a year of participation in the program.”
@RepMcGovern: “Let me state this as clearly and as plainly as I can: the majority of people on #SNAP who are expected to work, do work.
@RepMcGovern in the Rules Committee now on the #GOPFarmBill “when I was growing up it was school bullies that went after kids’ lunch money, it wasn’t the United States Congress. This is shameful.”
The Rules Committee will be meeting at 5pm today. We will consider a number of bills that run from bipartisan to extremely partisan. In the case of the #GOPFarmBill, it's downright cruel.
The @HouseGOP's unacceptable #2018FarmBill attacks our country's most vulnerable by cutting #SNAP benefits by over $23 billion. This will result in millions of kids, working families, older Americans, and more getting their benefits slashed. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/287wI1BhDr
