A wonderful college preparatory school.
@CathyAtria @LllKaise @laura_hagen @brchastain @C_Stroop We sent our kids (now adults) to private schools to get away from those kind of parents, to get away from religion. I wanted for them what I didn’t get. An education focused on critical thinking, intellect, challenging oneself to be best.

@Oris_Hickok @lovemyusmc_vet @my_shenanigons @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Nothing has passed yet. Meanwhile the changes in what is and isn’t deductible will affect some people ie SALT. The deficit increase of 1.8 T is problematic.

@LTCShop @mattbc @LOLGOP I’m going to ask the details and will get back to you. I think ?? more residents are are Medicaid then self pay. Since it is a Non Profit I’m sure they receive donations and fund raise. We donate small amt $ and buy residents socks, clothes etc when we can
@LTCShop @mattbc @LOLGOP All rooms are the same. There is no distinguishing between Medicaid residents and self pay. All private rooms private bathrooms. In 4 years I have seen minimal staff turn over. Cafe, free for staff, gift shop.
@edwardharris251 @JenniferJJacobs There are none.
@LTCShop @mattbc @LOLGOP I will ask. All I know is it is an amazing nursing home, my mom is self pay..A Hebrew Home but most residents are not Jewish. Classes like chair Tai Cha, ceramics,Piano lessons, music performances,There is an auditorium and Chapel, Art and sculpture displays
@LTCShop @mattbc @LOLGOP Each person needs to come up with their own unique plans for golden years.  State laws differ  - we don’t plan to need Medicaid so on a personal level this is a moot conversation. But for my fellow Americans that will need Medicaid it should be there.
@LTCShop @mattbc @LOLGOP Completely untrue. Check out River Garden, Jacksonville, FL.  Only 5 star Nursing home in the state several years in a row. An amazingly wonderful place.

@jefftiedrich @Skamama01 I’m in my 60s too and my Dad was a small town doctor ( only game in town) and he never cared if patients had insurance. He brought home potatoes, tomatoes etc as payment and sometimes nothing! We lived in a 1300sq ft house w 5 kids, dogs. Simple life values

@HitchcockDebera I don’t know where the hush money came from. I would assume T knew or supplied the money somehow. Isn’t that what’s at issue in part?   T believes he’s above the law so anything and everything is possible.

@JenConley7 @Billright50 @realDonaldTrump @SFCA4Trump @NoRinosNoDems Thanks I think a RINO is more like a Republican that leans towards Democratic ideas. A ‘pretend’ Republican in a conservatives view. The republicans serving now are not RINOs.

@AtomicShock2012 @RepBarbaraLee I agree you shouldn’t have to choose between dental work,glasses/and Insurance premium. That’s why I think we need single payer or Medicare for all. The way it is now isn’t working.
@AtomicShock2012 @RepBarbaraLee There are lots of things that we pay for as tax payers that don’t benefit us directly or we may disagree with. I see it as part of being patriotic to my country and citizens. It’s for our wellbeing as a whole nation.
@AtomicShock2012 @RepBarbaraLee I wish our premium were $500 each. We pay way way more. ACA has allowed us to find the plan that meets our needs with out getting turned away for pre-existing condition
@AtomicShock2012 @RepBarbaraLee Sorry you don’t want it but something unforeseen could happen and you would need it. We have been healthy and paid insurance co thousands and never used it. Last year out of nowhere hubby diagnosed w cancer.

@krassenstein @Meowwch I remember before the election Trump belittled the stock market. He said real estate was the best investment. He probably doesn’t give a shit about anyone’s savings, 401k,college fund. It’s about his real estate, his brand, his frail ego.

@resist_r @CathyMaiRu @kylegriffin1 It’s my understanding that Medicare A pays 100% for 20 days in a rehab center after a 3 night stay in the hospital. It then falls to 80%-20% with The supplement, part F or G picking up the rest. Medicare Advantage plans may be different.

@SenatorCollins what the hell is wrong with you? You were considered thoughtful at one time. Now, you’ve gone off your sensible Maine rocker. Lost respect for you...

@EricBoehlert Pam Bondi is an asshole. She and Rick Scott are both corrupt as far as I am concerned.
@WomanMDsGuide This is ridiculous and an outrage.  As long as Trump is president along with his cabinet and this congress I fear it will get worse. Any person that thinks should find this very disturbing. I am appalled.This reminds me of the movie Fahrenheit 451-oppressive
@RWPUSA This is unacceptable. Freedom of speech issue? Censorship? Totally    Unprofessional for CDC not to use the correct terms. Another authoritarian thumb squashing America. One more issue we need to fight back on. All people should condemn this

@YoungDems4Trump Come on guys....
@Juliethewarrior @AdyBarkan @rachael_scar So awesome you’re doing well. Since my sister was diagnosed in 1992 therapies have really advanced. Sisters are wonderful! Her stubbornness/anger stopped her from getting state of the art care. It was a sad frustrating situation. Stay warm!!
@infowars He lost by more then 1%. Recount can only occur if Moore pays for it
@brandongroeny @YoungDems4Trump 🔥Boom🔥 Doug Jones wins

@Juliethewarrior @AdyBarkan @rachael_scar I hope you take good care of yourself. I used the site Inspire for support and information. It’s a wonderful tool. I suggest you go on even if it’s to read what others post.
@Juliethewarrior @AdyBarkan @rachael_scar She was diagnosed in the early 1990s- since then there have been great strides. She was a patient of Dr Metzger then had no tx for 15 years. Finally we got her to go to Hopkins. She is an example of how attitude makes a difference. She was self destructive
@Juliethewarrior @AdyBarkan @rachael_scar She was an amazing artist and intellectual. Her Raynauds destroyed her hands and her anger was palpable. She had pretty healthy lungs, heart, kidneys her nemesis was her skin involvement, and GI system.
@Juliethewarrior @AdyBarkan @rachael_scar Unfortunately she died 2/18/14 but her death was premature. She did not take care of herself and resisted treatment. She had bad reflux and actually aspirated her breakfast. She was an Art Historian specializing in Rock art prof at U of Wisconsin.
@kurteichenwald Unfortunately so many Americans don’t understand these things. I don’t thing many politicians do either. Until it hurts ordinary Americans directly they’ll buy into the bullshit.  Tax Bill = The Great Tax Lie
@DearAuntCrabby Don’t vote because of a poll. Vote because it’s your right and duty as a citizen! Roy Moore wants to take that right away and Republicans are making it more difficult. Vote Doug Jones for equality and having the moral and ethical high ground
