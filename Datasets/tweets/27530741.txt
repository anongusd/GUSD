@austingrelle @ShellenbergerMD would also suspect there are national security considerations inherent to generation being so highly centralized, though again, that’s not a specific dig on nuclear, just the status quo
@austingrelle @ShellenbergerMD don’t get me wrong: I’ve never felt unsafe living by one — but even safe disposal has costs to it, and if we could somehow solve the scale and reliability constraints of renewables, that would seem to be “ideal” because it wouldn’t have input or output costs
@PeteButtigieg the average American spends more of their annual income on housing than any other expense category, and yet federal policy in recent decades has been largely limited to tax code subsidies for mortgages — how would your admin be different in attempting to control these costs?

@ShellenbergerMD @austingrelle that said, we can’t pretend its waste issues and security risks don’t make it less than ideal — the real hope still has to be storage and transmission advances that allow renewables to serve around the clock

@davidcrespo it is not that dissimilar from, say, database access that requires a specific IAM policy or token, other than that there’s a scheme wherein no singular central authority can arbitrarily assign insert privileges

@galenthethird it does often seem like a richer share when there’s good video content to accompany the track		without ads (and with in-background playback) YouTube Red starting to look a little more justifiable
@hvasquez @Spotify there are already some standards around album/track metadata, but I’m more thinking about how stricter structure or common formatting could somehow facilitate better handoffs and/or pre-play content transparency/previewing for users of unlike systems
@hvasquez @Spotify well, I’m about to... recommend any?
after 7yrs as a subscriber, I have no plans to drop @Spotify in the near future, but would be intrigued to see an offering in the category truly lean into interoperability as a product priority
as expected, Apple Music’s sharing workflow seems more intuitive and refined than Spotify and Tidal on iOS, but (perhaps by design) still makes it tedious to share with subscribers of competing services — in many cases, it’s easier to just send plain names
music streaming services make discovery and consumption easier in a bunch of different ways, but sharing tracks and albums still seems overly cumbersome, especially across platforms/providers

My Twitter timeline is thick with snark right now, but while its far from perfect, Rubio is killing it with his target audience right now.
When I organized for Obama in Osage (Mitchell County), we were done hours before Iowa City and Des Moines, even with protracted realignment.
Not the same pacing as primaries, where suburbs are in first. Rural precincts in IA are smaller, do less reg on-site, far easier to conduct.
Still too early to tell imo, but Bernie hanging close in the early returns is interesting. Rural (and more pro-HRC) precincts come in first.
The #IAcaucus is as much about distribution of support as it is the volume of support. Bernie's coalition probably too densely located.
It pains me, but I'm going to go on record predicting a Clinton victory tonight. Perhaps by as much as 5% of precincts.

@funkatron If I had wanted a Galaxy S-whatever, I would've purchased one awhile ago. iP6 even has that Samsung-esque cheap construction.
@funkatron I don't like having to cradle or reach for upper-left interactions. The home key double-tap adjustment seems hackish.
@funkatron I do. And I like the aspect ratio for the way some things are laid out. But on the whole, the bigger device is just unwieldy.
@funkatron I miss the 5/5S form. The iP6 is too large. I thought I would be used to it by now...
