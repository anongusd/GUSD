Dollar votes matter, and the more you focus on this, the more what you buy every day will help shape the world you want to live in. https://t.co/p3i9eDh2AP
If you are upset about the quality of the food supply, buy organic. If you want to promote climate action and green energy, buy a tesla or a solar panel. If you are angry about Amazon taking over the world, walk downtown and shop in your downtown area.
If we want to see real change in our world we not only have to pressure our govt to give us better choices, but we need to be actively voting with our dollars in places we see as more aligned with a better country.
Maybe you shop at Walmart and are upset about how China stole all manufacturing jobs, for example. We all drive to work, have prime memberships, and love our 2 day shipping.
This might sound like common sense, but being aware of our behavior on a daily basis takes an extra amount of effort. If you take the time to think about how you spend your money, you will probably realize that there are things you are spending on, that you don't agree with...
Everyday each of us spends money. If we want to see real change in the world, we not only need to vote in a booth, we need to vote with our wallets. This is the crux of capitalism. Businesses that make more money are successful, those that don't, aren't.
Everyone has opinions about how the world should be different, climate change is a problem, Amazon doesn't pay enough taxes, manufacturing jobs all left for China, etc.
I want to introduce a term I like to call "Dollar Votes"(I've seen other use this too) to the group, and I hope everyone takes this to heart as a (maybe)new political tool. If you have the time, please take a moment..
@SenMarkey Ed, if that really was all the #GreenNewDeal was about you would have more colleagues supporting it.

@HottenMoog @Leahgreenb I remember the day it was passed. There were months and months of hearings yes, but Pelosi pulled some crazy procedural shit off to actually pass it(I'll try and dig up info). I don't think they could have gotten a more idealistic bill through.
@Leahgreenb @HottenMoog Doing so ruined any chance Obama had at getting anything else done. I really wanted Climate action during those 2 years, but that wasn't prioritized. 2 years later we got our ass kicked because we rammed it through and also because of TARP.
@Leahgreenb @HottenMoog Agree with the worse policy, disagree that there was some sort of better alternative that was politically feasible. The day that bill passed people knew it wasn't great, but it was the way it was passed that upset the gop. Pelosi and Obama rammed it through, just to get it done.
@Leahgreenb 8 years later Trump got elected amd your group came into existence. Tell me again about changing lives. 		The GOP was more upset about how it was passed and also the $750bn Obama gave to banks. Obamacare became a symbol and an easy talking point about government overreach.

@JarretSchu November, technical details...
@JarretSchu Now don't get me wrong, I know how difficult this is in practice. But I think a good place to start is to remember we are all on the same team, and we all are shooting at the same goal. Let's not demonize the other side, let's find common ground first.
@JarretSchu This is exactly the point, we all want the same thing. Let's figure out how we can work together to solve these problems. My kids desperately wanted to fix the plane their way. But when I told them they had to cooperate, they figured out that by working together the could do it.

Also, if you're reading this and thinking No Way! The other side is crazy! They are doing XYZ... they don't share my values, etc. Realize the people on the other side are thinking the same thing about you. Again, we are in this together, forever.
We are Americans. We can achieve the impossible. But first we need to recognize that we need to work together as a team. Like I told my kids, you are in this together with each other, forever.		Teamwork. Teamwork. Teamwork. Forever...
They stopped, and did exactly that, and they both realized that they were much more effective fixing the plane with 4 hands working together, instead of 2 hands struggling to rip the plane from the other.
But if we keep fighting and arguing, trying to grab the plane out of the other's hand, we will definitely not fix the plane, and actually we will probably break it worse. So like any parent would, I told my kids to stop fighting and that they needed to work as a team.
Yesterday I was playing with my kids, and they were arguing over how to fix a toy plane. Today I realized this is a great analogy for our country. We all want for the same thing, a better life. Often we disagree on how to achieve that goal.

@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ Tbh I don't know a lot about it. But I think a system outside of our normal banking system will reduce liquidity in credit and hurt normal customers at the margin. Our system operates based on the assumption savers will keep their $ in a bank, and removing $ can cause a bank run.
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ The idea is that banks are supposed to lend this money out at a higher rate, but often times that doesn't happen due to their credit standards. There have been some attempts to make them lend more, but it is hard to do this in practice.
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ Facts
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ The government doesn't necessarily need to be the one getting it back. A lot of the money taken out of the economy goes to banks with higher interest rayes, which probably isn't the best way to combat it...
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ Correct, we are actually trying to get it up lol
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ @RepJoshG Twitter isn't a great platform to fully expand the ideas. Sorry if I sound like an ass.
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ Is the idea when you get a raise to hike your taxes? Billionaires don't cause real inflation and taxing them won't reduce inflation in the real economy. Billionaires cause yacht, and art inflation, not milk and bread.
@matthewshook525 @LisaMcCormickNJ Matt I'm not an authority, but I do have an econ degree and have worked in finance on both the sell side and buy side for 15 years. There is both cost pull and wage push inflation, neither of which can be mitigated with taxes effectively.

@FightForFJG @LisaMcCormickNJ The Federal Reserve has the sole responsibility in America to regulate both inflation and employment. They have a dual mandate. If inflation rises, they raise interest rates, hence interest on debt controls inflation.

I firmly believe that if it wasn't for Obamacare, my Mom and I, and the terrific care we were able to get my brother he wouldn't be with us today. Nobody should need to the lengths we did to ensure the best care for a family member. This is why I will fight for #MedicareForAll
My mom immediately went in to superwoman mode and knew everything there was to know about insurance. I became a junior oncologist and made sure I agreed with everything the doctors were doing throughout the whole ordeal. Dr. Vaughan and staff at @UofPenn were amazing.
My own experience saw my brother grow a tumor in his abdomen the size of a cantaloupe because he didn't have any insurance or healthcare provider.

@rgunns @NovelloAmanda I also think you guys were trying to put in something to the effect of transitioning coal miners and oil drillers to clean renewable jobs, I think we should make that more explicit somehow.
@rgunns @NovelloAmanda Also I did that really quickly, but I think the point will come across. Make it something that everyone HAS to support.  I also think adding something in about carbon capture is necessary because we will be using gas for a while we build out renewables.
@rgunns @NovelloAmanda Sent to team @ sunrise movement. Again don't get it twisted, the stuff you included about front line communities is super important, but they shouldn't be part of the GND. We can address these things in other initiatives, like a clean water for Flint act etc.

We can't afford to wait to negotiate in 2020, we risk losing the presidency to the GOP. I'm telling you, if we are serious we should be talking to Joe Manchin about what is passable.
@GreenNewPenguin @rgunns @AOC Ask yourself why it only has 1/3 house dems supporting it. And yes I think we can get gop support in 2020. Convince Joe Manchin and its a good deal. Focus 100% on climate and renewables.
Reminder: Dollars don't decide elections, voters and their votes do.

Do people need better jobs, yes, have people been hurt by fossil fuels, yes, but tying reparations to the GND was bad
@GreenNewPenguin @saikatc @JohnDelaney We would need to wait until 2024 at least to start using the left only. The Senate just can't change quick enough. If we get rid of the filibuster we would lose the house in 2022.		This is a multi decade effort, we need to all be working together.
@GreenNewPenguin @saikatc @JohnDelaney Penguin we can't do this alone. If we give the GOP some concessions like carbon capturing their shale gas, or private corporations being given grants they must use to help green homes and build renewables they will come on board. Unfortunately that's the only chance.
If progressives really want to get something big done on Climate Change, they would listen to critiques instead of name calling and throwing their head in the sand.
@saikatc @JohnDelaney I agree with his step backwards statement, completely disagree with his carbon tax. You will make no progress pushing this as a far left policy. You need 60 votes and the whole country behind you. This resolution does more to reelect trump then save the planet.

@sunrisemvmt @JohnDelaney @AOC @SpeakerPelosi You may think cow farts is ridiculous, and to that I would say, Trump is president. Yes, most people are concerned about climate change, but that doesn't mean most people agree with your resolution. 		If you really want to save the üåé, you will reframe this proposal.
@sunrisemvmt @JohnDelaney @AOC @SpeakerPelosi Do we need a green new deal? Absolutely. Lets think, how can we get the entire congress to back this bill? Make it something they can't criticize. HR1 is a great example of bills we should be putting forward.
@sunrisemvmt @JohnDelaney @AOC Trump did you guys a huge favor by declaring this "emergency", you were about to increase his odds of winning in 2020. Dream big, but think pragmatically and understand where the country is politically. If @SpeakerPelosi calls your bill a green dream, maybe you should reevaluate.
@sunrisemvmt @JohnDelaney John is expressing a sentiment a lot of us feel. Your goals aren't unrealistic or too ambitious, but its not realistic to think the GOP is going to support a bill @AOC rolled out. You need 60 votes, and you have 0 chance of getting there with this proposal.

@TXsharon @VarshPrakash @billmckibben @sunrisemvmt @NaomiAKlein @AOC Actually, the shale gas boom has slowed climate change. Previously we were burning oil and coal. Please see what the UK has done.

@FrankPallone We need to ensure Carbon Capture and Sequestration is a primary component of any legislation. We also need to look at not just doing it at major points of emissions, but also employing DAC (Direct-air-Capture). There is no path to Net zero emissions without it.

@garcoak @neeratanden @_waleedshahid Ok, Ill agree with that. Would a single public insurance company be able to crack down on these practices? Drs definitely overprescrive medication and procedures to bill insurance just to help their bottom line. In your opinion how do we remove that motive?
@garcoak @neeratanden @_waleedshahid Your laughter doesn't help further the conversation. If you disagree say why.
@Dist_5 @GOPChairwoman It works in every other country because one large insurance provider can dictate lower prices.

@FiveThirtyEight Can you do Harris/Biden? I think that's more likely..
@garcoak @neeratanden @_waleedshahid Drs are bound by the hypocratic oath to do what is right, and thus I am for paying drs so that we continue to have the best care in the world. Insurance executives took no such oath and often make their decisions based on their companies bottom line, not their patient's needs.
@RoKhanna The interpretation of the 14th amendment says corporations are people. Maybe change the corporate personhood structure, and then all of a sudden Citizens United goes away.
@tomwatson @_waleedshahid Unless I am reading something wrong CAP's plan is basically single payer but also allows for private insurance and employer funding to continue.
@tito_antony @jcburley @erikfinman @williamlegate @CarbFix Wrong again. As the planet warms due to greenhouse gases, so do the oceans. Just like all matter on earth, when something warms up it expands. The oceans are actually rising for 2 reasons...		1) Ice melt	2) Molecular expansion

@MakeOurEscape And sadly the character limit doesn't really allow me to fully expand on the ideas. Are you going to the Indivisible meeting this morning? Would be happy to discuss this more in person where we can really talk.
@MakeOurEscape Unfortunately not, I read more news and not enough books. I'll give it a try though lol... which one should I start with?
@MakeOurEscape 100% agree that the playing field is super uneven, in both opportunities and racism and we need to address both. Education is the foundation to fix that. Ensuring everyone has equal access to quality education would go a long way.
@MakeOurEscape I am not denying systemic racism, it is a problem around the country and world. But my story is not one of white privilege. All people should be afforded the same opportunities. Is there any policy idea behind this? Or just I wish things were different?
@MakeOurEscape And you are making yourself sound ignorant saying that I am successful because I am white. I am successful because I have made good decisions the whole way and had help from government assistance programs.
@MakeOurEscape I work in one of the most diverse companies in America, based in Newark. I didn't get hired there because I am white, I got hired by a wonderful black woman in spite of being a white male. The VP of my department was a black man. You don't know me, or my story.
@MakeOurEscape If you think Americans have the skills to compete in a global economy, you aren't paying attention. https://t.co/OMHguOTjPw
@MakeOurEscape Also, I pay plenty of attention.
@MakeOurEscape Its both. Education and capitalism are both broken.
@MakeOurEscape More than 1/2 of my tech team are Indians. That's not because they are cheaper, it is because they are more skilled than American counterparts. Globalization is causing significant disruptions, and we need to build a workforce that can compete.
@MakeOurEscape I am not worried about global competition for my job because I know that nobody in the world.can do it better than me. India and china have figured that out, and trains their workers in technology so they are better skilled for the jobs of the future.
@MakeOurEscape building the skills of our workers at home so they can compete with immigrants but also ensuring that immigrants aren't benefitting from a broken system that rewards them for working under the table.
@MakeOurEscape The jobs you are referring to where people can't make a living wage are often undercut by immigrants willing to work under the table, this is why the gop doesn't want immigration. We need to ensure all workers are on a level playing field. This requires...
@MakeOurEscape We need to build a workforce that is the best in the world, so when companies make hiring decisions they hire in America. Some companies have started doing this too. Financial Corps that used to outsource work to India are hiring in places like Delaware and Utah.
@MakeOurEscape Our workers our expensive compared to global labor. At my company specifically we have hired a few dozen people in Ireland to do work that Americans should be doing. This happens because Ireland's corporate tax structure and workers are cheaper than ours.
@MakeOurEscape This is also a 2 sided equation. The problem is wages have been stagnant due to increased global competition and bills keep going up every year. If your job isn't providing annual raises(and sometimes even when it does), you keep falling behind. Education in key to address this.
@MakeOurEscape Agreed, but I can't tell you how many people have told me they wish high school taught them more about real life. I grew up lower middle class. Took out loans to go to school and worked my way up, making good decisions along the way. 		https://t.co/oO5kprbSKy

The government helped us get our foot onto the ladder. Without government subsidized student loans I graduate with twice the debt.		Without the FHA's 3.5% down loan and the first time home buyer credit, we never could have afforded the down payment.
Into a 15 year mortgage with a 2.625% rate. We are now 5 years into that loan and we will pay off our mortgage just as our kids go to college. So... who cares and why am I telling you all of this? Because none of it could have happened without the federal government's help.
After working on it every weekend for a year, we were finally able to move in. Because we did so much work we were then able to refinance the house, take out 15 grand for our wedding and honeymoon to Hawaii and still have 80% loan-to-value ratio. A few years later we refi'd again
I was out of school 3 years when my  fiance and I bought our first house, which was bank owned and condemned. We were lucky and highly selective. We took out an FHA 203k mortgage with 3.5% down, and also received $8k for first time home buyers.
I graduated with something like 30 grand worth of debt and it took me 10 years to pay it off. Kids now graduate with loans 5 times that. This is immoral and destructive to our economy. We want the paychecks these graduates make going into the economy, not a bank loan.
Being a homeowner was the American dream. Now, too often, kids are graduating college with student loan debt the size of a mortgage. We need to do a better job of making college affordable again and educating kids on how to better plan their future. Financial planning is key. https://t.co/MzWBJqTAWG

@billmckibben and @350 will tell you we currently need to reduce our CO2 ppm by about 60 ppm. If we look to create renewables, that will only slow the rise of already high levels of CO2. We must reduce our future emissions AND start actively scrubbing the air immediately.

@jdcmedlock @ewarren Reality is most of the wealth in the world is held at custodial accounts and is invested in fixed income securities. Every day those accounts are making transactions. Tax the transactions and you tax the wealth. This method could also tax  brokers(GS, JPM, etc.) at the same time.
@jdcmedlock @ewarren We dont need to pass a law to have him pay property taxes. I think you are missing my point. Rich people hold assets, not just loads of cash.

@ewarren In theory I agree with @ewarren #UltraMillionaireTax but there are plenty of ways for this tax to be avoided. Adding fees onto financial transactions would work better and is much easier to enforce. When anybody sells a stock the SEC takes a small fee. That framework is better.

@CCplusfour @GovMurphy I will check it out. We absolutely need an all in approach immediately but as of now I believe nat gas(nuclear too) is part of that comprehensive solution. It is abundant and cheap in America and I don't think it is going anywhere for a few decades yet.
@CCplusfour @GovMurphy I agree, but is it better than oil, which is the current alternative. As a practical matter it is both cheaper for families and less harmful on the environment. Currently trucks are delivering oil to houses. Pipeline is efficient and delivering a cleanER fuel. https://t.co/k1J8hMPayk

@CCplusfour @GovMurphy Currently there really isn't a green alternative to heating homes that is better or cheaper than natural gas. I support a #GreenNewDeal to invest in technologies that in the future could replace fossil fuels, but those are years in the making.
@CCplusfour @GovMurphy Christine, I very much appreciate the follow and your activism, but I would suggest this pipeline is necessary. Many households in the NE are converting from oil to nat gas and this pipeline will carry that extra supply. Nat gas is cleaner than oil and doesn't spill like crude.

This doesn't mean the corporation and its workers would be fired, but instead a governmental entity would take over the company and all its ceo and board would be disbanded and reformed. This would provide a strong disincentive for bad corporate behavior.
We can have a better future, but we need to break the grip of corporate interests on our lives. Corporations only care about making money, and that is what we need to change. Corporations should face a death penalty if they are found guilty of egregious behavior.

Marijuana is specifically kept illegal by corporate interests who don't want competition. This year the marijuana industry wanted to buy a #SuperBowl ad. They were denied. But you better believe you will see beer ads in the dozens.
Marijuana should be legalized for recreational use. If you want to grow marijuana you can grow. If you want to sell, you need a license, just like beer. We have a real drug/addiction problem in this country and it has nothing to do with marijuana.
Another thing that I won't compromise on is #legalization 		Marijuana is currently classified as a schedule 1 drug because it shows no medical use. That's just preposterous. Guys with cancer use marijuana. Kids with epilepsy use marijuana. Mothers with MS use marijuana.
We saw how well bipartisan compromise worked with #Obamacare 		Dems wanted single payer(#MedicareForAll).	Reps wanted privitization.		Combine the two and get a flawed system that nobody liked the second it was passed. 		Dem ideas are good ideas. We don't need to compromise.

We need to ensure that in our fight to save the planet we are being pragmatic, not dogmatic. Otherwise we risk losing the support of a majority of Americans. I would ask any of you, if I should not be using natural gas to heat my home, what should I be using?

@OCONNELLAFCFAN @nytimes Yes, I also want to see governments utilize more nuclear. I believe China is building a fusion reactor, what is the US doing?
@HytekOrganix @nytimes No country wants to slow its development to combat climate change. They are working to continue growing, but in a more responsible way. We were the problem for a much longer time frame, which is what they argue at conferences like the #ParisAgreement
@rollcall üëé
@OCONNELLAFCFAN @nytimes Specifically we need to invest more in direct-air-capture, green hydrogen generation, and efficient production of methanol made from the two.
@OCONNELLAFCFAN @nytimes You don't pick winners in a market, that strategy won't work. People will find a way around it. Instead the price of renewable energy needs to come down in line with gasoline lets say. If we invest more in technology, clean energy will sell itself. Taxes are not popular.
@FusionAstro @nytimes I'm a democrat. I want to fix the problem, and not with carbon taxes, but by investing in technology to lower the costs of renewable energy.
@OCONNELLAFCFAN @nytimes You were 100% right. Opinions are changing however as evidenced by this article and 2018 election results.
@HytekOrganix @nytimes China invests more money that any other country in green tech. They won't be the problem.

@debradagrant1 @Jon37351955 @akhi4justice @abigbluefan @Jdhyani42 @AOC @CBSNews Cbs is who we are talking about. The point is there are ALOT of american perspectives. Trying to get all of them into one news team is hard. Especially when you also need to hire the most qualified people for a job. Are any of the reporters lgbtq, Or Jewish, Etc.
@soledadobrien @bridget_joy_ @AOC @HotlineJosh		Made this point last night. Joe Biden will be running and a significant portion of American voters are retirees. Where is all the outrage at cbs not having a septuagenarian on their staff? Also who should have been fired so we can have a black perspective?

@Jon37351955 @akhi4justice @abigbluefan @Jdhyani42 @AOC @CBSNews Lets fire Adam! He probably didn't deserve the job, he is just a white guy who most likely got it do to his lack of qualifications and chalky looks.

@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews @Lynda_Tran Can we agree that if campaigns are disproportionate with any perspective that is a problem? My point is any time you are singling out any one race or sex that's wrong.
@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews @Lynda_Tran What she meant was old white men are a problem and that in and of itself is racist and derogatory. You can say out of touch views, you can say we need a more diverse perspective. To single out the race, sex, and age of the members is counter to the values she stands for.
@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews @Lynda_Tran Again white male voices are stale and to be avoided. i.e.  I want to avoid the perception the house caucus is getting too black because I think that will hurt the party in 2020. Am I racist...? (Yes) You can say I want a diverse party without saying old white males are a problem.
This is painful for me... has the man never watched the state of the union? https://t.co/bAzo5ZeXoV
@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews @Lynda_Tran While I agree diversity is necessary, referring to white male voices as stale isn't asking for diversity. It is deriding two view points as old and unnecessary.
@CBSNews @Lynda_Tran This is racist and derogatory.

@MapleLeafLawyer @NBCNews It says in your screen grab that the military men believed they were in possession of child pornography.
@MapleLeafLawyer @NBCNews They say the inmates posed as women, and then older men or police would catch them. Women isn't right imo, these inmates were posing as teenage girls.

@RepJoshG I support the rules changes, because politically its a smart move. You should have  never tied your vote for Nancy to the rules, and your caucus means nothing unless you get Senators on board as well. We'll see how the spring goes...
@LeoDiCaprio Focus on CO2 levels. Warming is one problem, ocean acidification is another.
@UponASpyglass People are and this is all true but it doesnt come close to meeting the required amount of co2 absorption required to limit the severe changed we will see. We need to reduce dependence, plant trees, direct air capture, and recycle carbon into methanol efficiently.
@drexrawson @benshapiro @WSJopinion The whole climate report was framed poorly. Sure there are economic costs to climate change and they are real and will be huge, but the more important factor is the destruction of the relative homeostasis we had. CO2 is going to warm the planet and raise and acidify our oceans.
@kasie Both have merit

@DailyCaller It already has killed people. How many are missing from the #CampFireParadise ? Global warming is real. Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus, but Venus is much hotter. Why? 900 ppm CO2 that's why. Earth ~ 408 ppm and steadily climbing. Who wants Earth to be Venus? Not me...

@Couchdoorsman @Ntombi @CaitJGibson Until she got broken so badly after she had just turned the momentum. And that is when it all went south...
@Couchdoorsman @Ntombi @CaitJGibson To me it was obvious coaching when Serena was losing. The chair was probably just trying to call it tight because it was a final. It was just a warning for something the coach admitted he did and she got all indignant with him about him calling her a cheater, and it was OVER.
@Ntombi @Couchdoorsman @CaitJGibson She lost a grand slam because she slammed a racket and talked to an ump. Anybody who thought they could win would shut their mouth and play, which is exactly what she did the game she broke Naomi, but when Naomi broke her right back that was it she blew up and got a game taken.
@Ntombi @Couchdoorsman @CaitJGibson Imo this would have been a blip in the article about her 24th win. Instead Naomi broke her back, Serena knew she was gonna get beat, and she made all of this bs up to get us to talk about it and her instead of Naomi. Go back and watch it. These were my views in real time today.

Then you barely break her serve after the 3rd deuce(first in 23 games) and she breaks you back at 30. Is that the headline you want?

@Benioff @serenawilliams She is a sore loser and you should be talking about how she got her ass kicked by @Naomi_Osaka_

@regarro75 @NaveedAJamali To me, once she knew she was losing her mind went to her ad deals. It was hard to watch, but she got whooped.
@naimeiyao @washingtonpost Imo the original call was bad, but it was over and serena purposely rehashed it once she knew she was losing(racket break). Her coach even admitted to coaching her.
@washingtonpost Wrong. Naomi kicked serena's ass and Serena is trying to change the narrative. Sore loser.
@regarro75 @NaveedAJamali This is all taking away attention from the fact that she got her ass kicked. Which is exactly what she wants.
@regarro75 @NaveedAJamali Her coach admitted to coaching. Its an odd call, but he did it. She broke her racket, also against the rules. Then she verbally assaulted the chair umpire. How is any of this acceptable behavior for my 5 year old?
@shondarhimes The whole coaching issue was squashed until Naomi broke her back in the second set. Then she broke a racket and threw a tantrum. Sore loser.
@mariajsheehan @NaveedAJamali It was super racist too. Had nothing to do with her coach coaching. Her breaking a racket. And her calling the official a thief. She is a role model! Lol have a good night.
@mariajsheehan @NaveedAJamali Your right, it was sexist. The judge was thinking I want get back at Serena for years of her being a woman, and hand the match to.... another WOMAN!!!!
@mariajsheehan @NaveedAJamali Just go into my likes. She is a sore loser. This was awful to watch.
@ASE Everything was over until Naomi broke her back in the 2nd set. Then she broke a racket and accused the official of stealing. Sore loser.
@NaveedAJamali Class would have been not reacting the way she did during the match. The coaching call was bs, but Serena lost the match after Naomi broke back in tje 2nd set and then broker her racket and called the ump a thief. Looked like a spoiled little kid.

@Susan_Hennessey This is treason. If someone did this to Obama, it would be treason. The man should not be potus, and blame that on the gop house or his cabinet or whatever, but as long as he is, he is in charge and anybody in his staff undermining his government is treasonous.

@sonyamcgee @ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @EdenECherry Again, I voted for her.  But after that loss, I think she needs to bow out gracefully and do good work like she has always done outside of american politics. Go all Al Gore on us. It is an eerily similar scenario.
@sonyamcgee @ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @EdenECherry I was out canvassing this past November and ran into an older couple and we started talking. They wanted to talk to me about the uranium one thing, and I was floored. What was clear to me was how Fox has corrupted gullible people, and it happens in a million ways over 30 years.
@sonyamcgee @ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @EdenECherry Its a confluence of things, but imo being a woman is a small part. I honestly think she has just been around forever and there are a million things dating back to the 90s people could not like her for. 1/2
@XxJustChaunxX Fwiw You have a lot of water heading your way. If you live close to the river or know anybody who does tell them to move their stuff up, and rent a hotel this weekend in Pittsburg.
@ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @sonyamcgee @EdenECherry You are talking yourself into circles based on your abject love of Hillary. Explain the Obamas poll numbers compared to Hillary's using your gender race logic. Maybe we're just not that into her.
@SuzanneMLamber1 @ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @sonyamcgee @EdenECherry But the Michele popularity shows how America can like a black woman. Sure there are whites that don't want a black to be pres or men that don't want a woman. But by and large I think we judge people on policies and character(or at least how both are perceived by us)
@SuzanneMLamber1 @ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @sonyamcgee @EdenECherry Tbh, I don't think the country knew how racist they were until a black man became president. I  also think it took seeing that racism manifest itself in Trump for people to realize that isn't such a good look. (People = swing voters, you'll never speak to 25% of America...)

@ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @sonyamcgee @EdenECherry Just not as high as a black man.		Can we stop all of this bs and just elect Michele? Then you'd see it has nothing to do with race or gender.
@sandyknauer @ReginaA1981 Sandy, she lost to a 1 term senator in 08 and then competed against a non existent primary field in 16.  When given the option between her and trump, America didn't overwhelmingly choose her. We need to move on. She already has.

@ReginaA1981 @gagadelbae @SuzanneMLamber1 @sonyamcgee @EdenECherry Gop leaders/donors/pacs attack Hillary because they don't want her in office because of her policies. They attacked Bill the same way.  People are sheep and believe the bs, so why not spew it?  benghazi ü§£
@ReginaA1981 @BMurrayWilliams She can, but she would be hurting her party which is why she is choosing not to and why I am saying she shouldn't. Hillary and I agree, its time for someone new. I'm hoping Nancy comes to the same realization.
@ReginaA1981 @BMurrayWilliams Not gonna act like I know all the happenings of that time, but if a candidate lost a presidential election after losing a primary and there were other people in the party with similar views who were capable of leading the country I would tell that person to sit down, be humble.

@EdenECherry @KravMata @sonyamcgee @ReginaA1981 To me Trump seemed way more real and Hillary the more polished politician(I voted for HRC). I think that polish turned a lot off. People wanted someone that related to them, and Hillary wasn't it. Trump wasn't either, but at least came off that way because he "told it like it is"

@ReginaA1981 @LorryLorryltm My misogyny is so ingrained I voted for Hillary lmao. You don't know me. Hillary got beat by trump, enough said. I want a strong field of NEW democratic voices, and for you to stop talking about Hillary ffs. 	[Insert clever name calling here.]
@LorryLorryltm @ReginaA1981 She shouldn't have won in 08? She did win 08? She beat a really strong field of democratic challengers? She didn't almost lose to Bernie? She beat Trump? She is a great candidate?		Yes, total fiction in all ways. You're right.
@BMurrayWilliams @ReginaA1981 I don't consider them equal. Hillary got to the show and lost. If Biden wants to try his luck in a dem primary have at it. Bottom line is we need a competition, not this Hillary is the nominee bs like in 16.

@eaudie @ReginaA1981 Enjoy your Labor day
@eaudie @ReginaA1981 If you say so, but I think you can read the words you replied to. Maybe your point is you think all white people are bad people, and some may just disagree with you. Also could probably use a look in the mirror.
@eaudie @ReginaA1981 Lol, you might want to go look up racism. I think you mean oppression.
@eaudie @ReginaA1981 Racism is just racism, there is no reverse. Even the concept of reverse racism is racist. Indians can be racist against Chinese, and blacks can be racist against whites.
@eaudie @ReginaA1981 My point is Fn trump beat Hillary. Stop acting like she is good candidate, she lost to trump. She also got beat by an upstart senator from illinois before that.
@ReginaA1981 @eaudie You seem really racist. You've mentioned how much you don't like white people about 8 times in this convo. Maybe go look in the mirror. Believe it or not, there were people who voted for trump who were actually BLACK!!! Lol
@ReginaA1981 @eaudie Never underestimate how uninformed the american people are.
@ReginaA1981 @eaudie You're wrong. Not everyone knew who he was(I did, you did). Also, people have changed their opinions about him.		https://t.co/4kB63FeZTy
@eaudie @ReginaA1981 People are idiots. I knew he was racist, you knew he was racist, some people just don't watch the news. There was some normal people who were just blind.

@eaudie @ReginaA1981 All true, he still is our President... why? Because he ran against Hillary.
@PFan62 @ReginaA1981 Also, this has nothing to do with Bernie weirdo
@PFan62 @ReginaA1981 This is just wrong. There was a field of 3... why? Gop I think had 17...
@ReginaA1981 @eaudie I don't disagree. There were other trump voters who saw him as an outside candidate and successful business man and didn't want to vote for "the system". Bottom line people voted for Trump and not Hillary. The fact that it was even close is why Hillary needs to go away forever.
Tweet at me then block me lmao let me know if you need anything else explained.		@Ldonahuehjelle
@PFan62 @ReginaA1981 I'm saying there would have been a lot more people in the field. Bernie was independent and almost beat hear. Why didn't Warren run? Hillary was anointed as the nominee and still couldn't close the deal.
@ReginaA1981 Those people are dumber than trump voters. At least he won, and has a chance to be President in 2020.
@davebabler @ReginaA1981 Pennsylvania and Ohio are the middle of the country. Go look at their 2016 vs 2012 numbers. Clinton won big in California, woo hoo! https://t.co/4Jhmnj2OXE

@PFan62 @ReginaA1981 Can you read? Had it been a level playing field she wouldn't have been the democratic nominee.
@ReginaA1981 You're right, Clinton 2020. Go start a pac.
@ReginaA1981 Fact is there were (a lot of) Obama voters that voted for Trump. They aren't racist, they don't like Hillary.
@PFan62 @ReginaA1981 And yet is sitting at home this morning...ü§î
@ReginaA1981 Obama is a white male supremacist?		She should have won in 08, she didn't. If she had run against any kind of real democratic primary field in 16 she would have lost. Bernie almost beat her. Fact is she lost to Trump!!!!! She isn't a good candidate...
@ReginaA1981 She lost in '08 and in '16. The country doesn't want her.

@jaenova251 @MalcolmNance Lol I was hoping for Biden Obama
@jaenova251 @MalcolmNance Hillary is clearly more legit than trump by several measures. That said I thought Obamacare was a really good idea in 09 too. We have political will on our side and that will continue until we overplay our hand. Trying to put Hillary in office, would be overplaying.
@jaenova251 @MalcolmNance Imho this was their chance to actually do what the college was designed to do and they blew it. If they didn't realize Trump was the exact candidate the college was made for it deserves to be dissolved and we should move to popular vote winning.

@rok_chick @StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate @washingtonpost It was Hillary, some guy name Martin who nobody had ever heard of (I kid of course @MartinOMalley ) and Bernie. And Bernie matched up best against trump.
@rok_chick @StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate @washingtonpost Lol, this is the exact opposite of what happened. The lefts problem from the beginning was our top candidates all didn't run because it was Hillary's turn. We "owed" it to her because of Obama winning in 08. Bernie was independent so he wasn't subject to the same unwritten rules.
@rok_chick @StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate @washingtonpost He would have walked over trump. Instead we all were forcefed #GetWoke and now Republicans will never hold a branch of government ever again. Short term pain for long term gain.

@rok_chick @StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate @washingtonpost That was news, they aren't fake, they reported it. Listen I wasn't happy about it...		This actually brings us back to the original point. If dems voted for who had the best chance to beat trump Bernie would have been nominee and currently president. He out polled hillary by 8 pts
@rok_chick @StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate @washingtonpost Lots of reasons why he won, one big one was Jim Comey making the story about Hillary the week before the election.
@StevensForHouse @williamlegate Umm really? Healthcare. Trump wants to dismantle obamacare, progressives want it expanded. This should be framed as:		Trump is taking away coverage for preexisting conditions. As a candidate I will fight to ensure these protections remain.
@StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate Grabbed this from an old @washingtonpost article. It makes the point. If voters have a strong dislike number it makes sense to center the election around that person. In '16, both were strongly disliked, but trump succeeded in making the election about Hillary, not himself. https://t.co/mV9calLX1B
@StevensForHouse @Danceindadugout @williamlegate If a person votes thinking "man I really hate trump" he isn't going to care who you are when he pulls the lever for a dem. But if they walk into the booth thinking about how dems are pushing socialism the odds they pull the trump lever go way up. Keep the focus on trump

@Danceindadugout @williamlegate In '16 the reason trump won was bc when people went into the voting booth they were thinking Hillary's emails not trump and access hollywood. This is true today. Make 2016 about trump: tariffs, healthcare, crimes. Talk about your policies, but frame them as a contrast to his.

@GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP 		Attention required: 		Tomorrow is the LAST DAY in which you can turn on Trump. Draft Articles of Impeachment. Press interviews should indicate legal trouble for the president.		Anything short of this will cause you lost elections and legal jeopardy.
@KarenCisMe @williamlegate Yes, this is the strategy. In primaries as well(if there are even any leftü§î). Whomever has the best chance of winning a general election. We made that mistake in 2016. Lets not repeat it.
@williamlegate O and then vote!
@williamlegate Agreed, but if they could keep a small national presence that would benefit everybody. We should all do nothing from here until to November except mention healthcare and trump.

@EunuchTrump @Urenator @_SemaHernandez_ @BlackSocialists So maybe just maybe some attack ads had something to do with the fact that exactly the right number in exactly the right states just happened to vote the other way?
