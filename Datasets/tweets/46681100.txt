;) https://t.co/vTpjVKtPwc
Comey was able to draft Hillary exoneration prior to her interview because “if you’ve been investigating for a year and you don’t know where it’s going you’re doing something wrong” not verbatim.  So what about Russia, he still can’t draw conclusions, but President is unfit.
Comey - Why no grand jury for HRC? Because an informal interview gave us more flexibility.
RT @HowardKurtz: Comey's answer pretty lame on leaking to NYT thru a friend: Otherwise he'd disappoint all the other reporters
When would Comey’s memos have been “leaked” if he’d not been fired?
Comey says he did not want to be political, yet so far every decision appears based on the assumption that he expected her to win. Why was that assumption a factor in anything?
I have always admired Barbara Bush, she’s in our prayers.  She and 41 are a shining example of love.  Gracious, but fierce. Steadfast, but fun. Devoted.
