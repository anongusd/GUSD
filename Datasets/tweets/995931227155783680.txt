@Sheilalal5 @celldude @staceyabrams @WhiteHouse ....right. That's the point. But thanks for reminding me.
@TheDemCoalition Just wondering, filing the petition as private citizens, does the House have any obligation to respond to the complaint?
@celldude @staceyabrams @WhiteHouse Luckily lots of us are from elsewhere and we try to very actively keep our home state voter registration. Its often more of a true vote anyways bc no DC representation and DC always votes reliably Democratic. But it doesnt beat #DCstatehood .
@AlyssaSamuels81 @staceyabrams Yeah for some people it like, really just is that simple
@staceyabrams So glad to see #DCStatehood finally becoming a talked about issue and even happier to hear about it from the one and only Stacey Abrams.
@JackPosobiec @AOC Everytime this guy appears on my Twitter feed I consider just deleting this forsaken place
@JackPosobiec Good god are you a narcissistic creep
@oneunderscore__ Wow. He really only cares about people knowing who he is. He would rather people know him from seeing criticism.. that he wrote.. than not be known at all. This is just sad.

@ALightThroughT1 @Rouleur321 @mmm_kantaloupe @bluskabucknut @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics The Greenhouse effect is a proven physical phenomenon. Not a political talking point. You should learn climatology from better sources if  you think it is.
@Rouleur321 @mmm_kantaloupe @bluskabucknut @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics Sure. It's not up to non-experts to determine the existence of reliably proven conditions that create feelings of gender dysphoria. My or your opinion on the gender binary is largely irrelevant.
@CalWest12 @Rouleur321 @mmm_kantaloupe @bluskabucknut @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics You're saying.. if scientists get paid for their work... that means it can't be trusted? Do you hear yourself? Most scientists do not rely on government grants. Most scientists are not American. There is no such thing as a "climate change-positive" grant.
@OwenHenahan @walterowensgrpa Congrats on your grandpa ,, wow!
@CostanzaaGeorge @shaunking @BernieSanders She most definitely has a platform. You can look it up.
@LoriSums @TVietor08 @RiseUpAbove @CNNPolitics Those are political *commentators*. They are introduced as people here to give their opinion. The person they hired is overseeing how the network covers the 2020 election and will decide what and how to give the news. That's not what Van Jones does.
@Rouleur321 @mmm_kantaloupe @bluskabucknut @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics A different point of view is acceptable if she was deciding what pizza toppings to get for the office but a non-scientist who chooses what facts to believe in order to promote an agenda does not count as "a different view".
@bluskabucknut @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics Objectivity does not come from people whose job is to deflect criticism and use selective info to make an appeal for an ideology, particularly one that promotes homophobia and racism.
@Brian_Coons @TVietor08 @CNNPolitics "An alternate viewpoint" is a very kind way of describing someone who's made a career out of selective truth telling and wordsmithing in order to make specific people in the GOP look better and avoid scandal while deflecting criticism.
@DylanByers @BernieSanders Literally what the fuck is going on. This doesn't even fit his messaging of "socialism bad" and "democratic party is too narrow to fit my platform so I'll run as an independent"
@Neale_Print @SenGillibrand Your inability to notice sexism does not mean it doesnt exist
@BernieSanders I'm not coming along for another ego trip so we can take what could be a true progressive policy campaign into one about the past and "DNC rigged" primaries with a Trumpian cult of personality.
@Capitalist_Man @shaunking @BernieSanders By all projections, running as an independent will ONLY take away votes from Democrats and ensures a Trump victory by taking about 4 percent in states where that number is crucial for a Dem win. Any independent candidate only hurts Dems. He shouldn't run period.
@shaunking @BernieSanders Really? In what ways? By turning what could be an issue driven campaign into a Trump-like personality cult, adding anti-Democratic, "DNC RiGgEd" supporters that will distract from the issues the democratic party could have been about? No. He tried. I voted for him. Not this time.
@Susan_Hennessey Yes. To all of it.

@nlyonne Thank you for making Russian Doll. I think it changed my life. I hope you and everyone who worked on it got as much from it as I did.
@passantino It's more accurate to say they're pro-Russian policy than anti-US. They're spouting Russian talking points word for word but they're only anti-US in that they're critical of policy.. and positing themselves as a legitimate journalistic outfit
@BenjaminNorton All of those outlets are clearly labeled as being partially funded by governments. Even if they arent it's a much easier guess to find out that the British Broadcasting Co. is re to Britain whereas "In the Now" does not show their viewers anything to suggest Russian backing
@BenjaminNorton And which of those listed countries planned &amp; executed an attack on US democratic institutions in order to cause chaos in elections and sow discord among citizens? Wasnt it just Russia?
@BenjaminNorton @AnissaNow **Because the US Government doesnt want foreign propaganda to be unlabeled, unmarked and positioned as a genuine journalistic outlet
@AnissaNow @CNN @IntheNow_tweet @facebook Your pages are a coordinated attack on the hearts and minds of the American electorate

@drboycewatkins1 Should've gone through your own Twitter before putting out such an awful take that your own words from a year ago say the opposite.
@drboycewatkins1 Oh my god. Do you think that pointing out that a sitting US Senator from the most populous state in the country who's running for president *might* be ambitious is a point worth making? You'll have a hard time finding a non-ambitious candidate, but idfk why that's a negative
@BlackPride29 @george_curnow @drboycewatkins1 So.. no candidate? Work for incremental change or if you really think a candidate is going to adopt your one issue voting issue, then lobby them. But I suspect you know a small local circle &amp; twitter issue isnt gonna be in a debate moderated by CNN anytime soon
@drboycewatkins1 Or it could be that you're just wrong &amp; the world disagrees with you. Why on earth would Russian bots be supporting Kamala Harris? It's also very clear that you're being ratioed to hell by individual, genuine accounts. If you dont think so, you can run bot tests. Do it.

@412VIC @drboycewatkins1 This is completely predicated on your assuming a woman cannot be the stronghold of identity and ideology in a relationship. That the woman always submits to their husband in ideology. Your point is literally based on women being weak &amp; intellectually inferior.
@drboycewatkins1 Isnt one example in politics specifically that disproves this thesis... Barack Obama? A two term president whom a black woman married? I mean, if you want to use presidential candidates as a bar, your premise falls apart.

@ForeignPolicy I'm cancelling my subscription to #ForeignPolicy because I truly cannot take seriously a publication willing to grant a murderous autocrat such as MBS the title of #FPGlobalThinkers. So disappointing.
@ForeignPolicy @jordanbpeterson This is deeply concerning.
@jonbecker_ You think the Marlins are set to sign one of Harper or Machado? I havent seen alot of baseball writers connecting them to the Marlins as a team still in the mix

@RelentlessYapp @AbrasiveObelisk It's an issue in 2019 because press are going back through her life to find things to confirm their thesis, not that she "keeps doing this".

@Newsweek Thank you Newsweek for giving us the hard hitting journalism with the headline that checks the facts and doesnt just present a professional spin doctors words exactly as they said it.
@AndrewFeinberg 3rd) Isnt this the kind of consequence one should understand before going to work for Trump? He has said lots of things that have made even his own chief of staff worry he was a racist. You can't defend him and then run bc now everyone thinks you worked for a racist.
@AndrewFeinberg 2) I thought he barely did any work for the Trump campaign. POTUS should probably conspire with another witness before Stone goes off saying "I'm too connected to Trump, cant try me" and Trump says "I'm not connected to Stone at all, cant try me for what hes done"
@AndrewFeinberg 1st) Hes entitled to a jury of his peers. Not his fans. 	Maybe the reason an overcooked Republican operative is out there committing crimes is because none of his fans ever checked him as long as he was helping their guys get elected.

@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc This is where I bring up Kyrsten Sinema &amp; Jackie Rosen who both flipped Republican held Senate seats, one in a seat by all accounts is a red state &amp; following your list:  Rep Governor, All but one state office, both Senate, maj of US House, &amp; majorities in both chambers of leg.
@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh geez, I don't know. I mean having worked at a district office to the Senatorial campaign to the US Senate you'd think I might, but your condescension has me shook
@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc That was actually an example of legislatures NOT telling us alot.
@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc If we went by who has supermajorities in state houses then Illinois, for one, wouldnt have elected Rauner in 2014 and Kirk wouldn't have been a Senator until 2 years ago. Dems have had a monopoly on state leg throughout.
@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc It's true that MS is looking less appealing to Dem presidential campaigns but in the Senate and according to Ballotpedia, CNN, Vox, 538, et. al, Missouri was very much a battleground state in 2018 where we outfundraised GOP. The DCCC very much continues to operate that way in MS
@SenhorRaposa @dicey__ @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc By that logic, quite a big number of newly elected Congress members should have lost in their "red states".
@SenhorRaposa @Jyoungerman28 @clairecmc It's a purple battleground state. And she used to be that states senator. She won once. So saying it's a red state doesnt excuse her loss.
@clairecmc You tried this and lost your Senate seat. I'm sorry if I don't borrow your strategy.
@Clarknova1 @TheHyblidFramer Your point still stands even though he hasn't been deported.. so why lie about how deportation works and spread misinformation on twitter?
@Clarknova1 @TheHyblidFramer No. He has not been deported yet. As all articles explain, hes been put in removal proceedings, not literally sent on a plane to the UK in less than 24 hours. "ICE will now await the outcome of his case before a federal immigration judge to determine future actions."
@EireannDolan It's not very often that I say "As a gay baseball fan", but that's how Ill answer this.

@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump That's a question that was posed in, idk, day 1 of every climatologists research. Asked and answered. Your failing to know that fact does not make you right.

@realDonaldTrump Other government officials, from both parties: "Take Shelter. Be safe. Here are warming houses open to keep you from dying in -40¬∞ weather."		Trump: "LOL @ globalwarming, I bet the libs who are freezing to death right now wish it was real"
This point from @PodSaveAmerica team is 100% right. If you dont think the #Dems hold your voice within their platform, then join the platform.

@realDonaldTrump I listened to your whole speech. The prepared remarks came close to creating an alternate reality wherein you didnt lose this fight and cant build a wall no one wants, but not quite there. Your problem isnt no one listened. Problem is we did listen and now we know #TrumpCaved
@WhiteHouse Think about the cruelty involved in rebranding anti-immigrant policy as a humanitarian crisis. They sat down and thought to use a term contextualized by real human suffering when they realized just saying "Let's build a wall to keep brown people out" wasnt working. #TrumpCaved
Goddamn, even Nixons ghost is distancing themselves from #RogerStone for potentially VOLUNTEERING for Nixon, while the Trump White House, whose campaign he did high level work for says "Look, he consulted for lots of Republican campaigns.

@AOC So why did you vote against reopening the government?
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC My family going back three generations have been self employed CPA's. I've had to listen to hours of conversations about the ins and outs of doing individual and corporate returns. There are lots of variables &amp; looking at trends gives a better picture than any individuals return.
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC The amount you personally pay isnt relevant when looking at the overall trend of effective tax rates. Taxes are much more than your tax bracket. Its about the hundreds of tax credits, deductions and benefits that makes for a regressive system that benefits the wealthy.
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC The risks you may have taken are rewarded by the fact that you now get to join the top income bracket and be wealthy. Why do you think taking risks &amp; employing people while being wealthy means the government should reward you with less taxes?
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC I'm the federal worker not getting a paycheck, and even when I do, I'm making less than if I did working full time at Starbucks, who knows if I can struggle to survive on &lt;$30k, someone who makes &gt;$500k will be just fine paying EQUITABLE taxes.
@YoucantfoolmeA @AOC I dont know why you think even if you were a brilliant debater who deserves to debate a sitting congresswoman that you're entitled to an appearance to try and combat your superior political maneuvering or even a response. This is just a weird hill to die on
@YoucantfoolmeA @AOC My excuse for what? I already did debate. I did high school. Now I work in politics. You should slow down on twitter if this is your first day and ive already got 8 replies
@YoucantfoolmeA @AOC Are you her constituent? You can try and call their office. I promise that will turn into an awkward call. You're not the first person to be obsessed with a member who has some wild demands &amp; expectations. I talk to probably 5 a week.
@YoucantfoolmeA @AOC Yeah. 1) You're bad at reading sarcasm. 2) You have a giant ego. 3) You, nor one Democratic congresswoman, are going to change the minds of voters wherever you live. 4) Your twitter account is DEFINITELY not going to do that.
Are these things normal perks for congressional staff? Cuz I am missing out https://t.co/225K16mbSZ
@YoucantfoolmeA @AOC You gravely misread the situation, I promise you. The fact that shes smart and principled makes her vote all the more disappointing. Your fan account has a weird vibe to it

@AOC I'm so disappointed you voted no on funding the government. I think you should know that defunding ICE is not likely to happen in emergency funding for the government at previous levels. This is the wrong time to take a stand on this.
@AOC @LindseyGrahamSC So why the hell did you vote against funding the government?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump That's funny, I thought "A New Low for American Politics" was your campaign slogan?
I've been saying this for years. Ohhh god. Why do people think that campaigning on the fact that they don't think their job should exist or should have less power makes them at all qualified? Not very many communists running hedge funds either. https://t.co/5P3dSwV0VA
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC That is not how effective tax rates work. My numbers are effective tax rates, like I said. Those brackets are also based only on the new federal income tax.  https://t.co/u5ZfZ5a7lD

@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC Wealthy tax payers do not get credit for employing the poor. If it was true that all of the extremely wealthy were donating large sums of money, causes would be well funded. Instead, the opposite is true; people who make less donate MORE of their income than the ultra rich do.
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC The highest, &gt;$10mm pay less tax than those making &gt;$2&lt;$5mm. $10mm &amp; above - only 25.9%. $2-$5mm pays 29.3%. That is no success penalty. People making money in the 8 digits already are paying fewer taxes than the wealthy making fewer millions.
@SDeplorable2018 @woman_west @AOC I can't find a stat that supports your exact numbers, but I mean, yeah. Of course the small group of people who hold wealth that is equal to the 90% pooled together pay the most. They have the most money. Their effective tax rates are the issue. 29% of $300mm is hardly a burden.

@GaLiberal @LandonHall @davidaxelrod @ktumulty @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr Trump himself doesnt even care about a wall. Its literally just ego, stubbornness and because he thinks "his base" wants him to have this fight.

@OrinKerr Thank you for the reply! I was searching the quote and not getting the results.

@CaliDeplorable @Alyssa_Milano @POTUS I dont think you really even believe that most Americans even approve of the President, let alone are Trump Supporters. If you think that's anything close to reality, your bubble must be really tiny and misinformed.
@brettachapman @SenWarren Shes a United States senator who has a media team governing her tweets. Shes running for president. I dont think she spends all day scrolling through Twitter. So you're mad that it took her.. less than a day?
@knifechief13 @Alyssa_Milano Can you point to where Alyssa Milano is selling NFL branded clothing or anything using native imagery? Honestly would want to know
@Majordawgsfan @Andrelton That's a shame. During which Congress? Did they not pass the CR with added solution guaranteeing back pay? I dont know when that didnt happened.
@rotolady @mk9577 @Mar_e_o17 @Andrelton @realDonaldTrump The GOP Senate already voted on a bill to fund the government, with ~$2 billion in border security 100-0. Every elected official in Congress would vote to reopen the government. Trump is objectively the only one making that impossible, saying $5 billion or nothing.
@amandawgolden @PressSec I have literally no idea what or who specifically shes referring to.. and I work in the Senate.
@Cubbymemes Who are "they"? ... yikes dude
@LususNaturae0 @TastyBaldEagle @JordanUhl @AOC We're operating on the same definition. It seems like you are underestimating the objective reality that all House members are "in control of the process" of lawmaking which includes financial priorities. Leadership is about operations &amp; managing - AOC &amp; Pelosi have equal votes
@LususNaturae0 @TastyBaldEagle @JordanUhl @AOC The group of 435 as a whole is in charge of future fiscal planning for the United States. By virtue of being one of those 435 out of 300 million Americans, she is responsible. I don't know why you insist on trying to make this point.
@LususNaturae0 @TastyBaldEagle @JordanUhl @AOC I have no idea what your standard for in charge is if a federal lawmaker elected to represent the largest city in the county does not make the cut
@Ryan_Deitsch This is.. just not how campaigns work. There's not a limited amount of press that gets taken up by candidates beginning exploratory committees. There are probably candidates you haven't heard of yet bc the press hasn't reported. 		You can have two things.
@SarahKSilverman Every time I felt really awful about politics, I would watch #ILoveYouAmerica and feel better. After the trauma that was the Kavanaugh hearings, I was upset until I saw the show. Something about genuine, open discussion of things when they are shitty is really healing.
@mngop @RepAngieCraig @RepDeanPhillips @IlhanMN @collinpeterson @RashidaTlaib The same old Dems? Can you point to other current examples of Democrats in official capacity cursing and using poor language? Cuz all the examples I can think of are the GOP President.
@ERyanL1 @LauraMaeLee @MarkHertling @stavridisj Choosing to take a job in the Trump administration has fairly obvious implications. It's not like Trump didn't tell us who he was and they had no idea until they got there what he wanted to do. "When someone tells you the first time who they are, believe them."
@sfroms @USMCBRAT2 @hogangidley45 @POTUS That's simply not true. I definitely have at least two photos of marine outside west wing at night. The President works at night. So does the protection detail. I dont know where you heard that, but it's certainly not true.

I can promise you this tweet is not harming her ability to work with other members. It's not a problem, dont try &amp; backpedal into making it one
@TinaLandTravels @Thearetical @Ocasio2018 Twitter is not a political conversation. She is not at work when shes on Twitter. Literally every politician uses a different voice on the internet than when working with colleagues. Except most have a comms director, at least this is actually her voice.
@SulomeAnderson I think this is a insider problem that readers really don't share. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't work in journalism saying something like "This piece on tragedy just doesn't catch me." This perspective would be really good for journalism.
@PardesSeleh This is the consequence to free speech. Free speech doesn't give you the right to say and do anything with impunity. It means people can rightly choose not to hang out or associate with you because of the shit you say. Get used to it or be a better person
@PerdieXAmerica @Hello__Brain @PardesSeleh This isn't a DC problem. Have you seen your guys numbers? Not liking Trump is just about an everywhere problem. I'd get used to it if he's really the hill you want to die on.
@PerdieXAmerica @Hello__Brain @PardesSeleh Some biases are justified. You KNOW its reasonable to try and avoid living with someone who is fundamentally opposed to your beliefs. Believing you should detain children at the border, ban Muslim entry to the US &amp; transgender troops doesn't make you a protected class of citizen
@Matt2h @thehill Hahaha I love the fake punditry featuring the famous "they're about to learn how __ really works". House vs Senate culture is different because of the work they do - not in the elected officials. How many senators came from the house? They don't become new people.
@EmpathicSurgeon @NateSilver538 I'm not sure that either of those is true. Democratic voters hold very diverse opinions. So do those elected with a D next to their name.
@lbf_tweet @angelsfabulous1 @NateSilver538 I'm a Democratic Congressional staffer who grew up in the Midwest &amp; getting to hear from my fellow constituents has given me a more advanced understanding of how diverse opinion is, especially from places I grew up thinking were 100% conservative. Working in Sen showed me its not
@KMacinNWI @DredMoses @Ocasio2018 Dude. I am congressional staff. I had to watch days of ethics training. Just read for yourself if you dont believe me, its lifted directly from the ethics handbook https://t.co/6phCxDTjNW
@NicodemusVI @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews @johnpodesta @HillaryClinton 12 Russian agents were arrested in July literally for the hack on the DNC. The US government proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a grand jury and federal judge that these 12 agents were responsible &amp; acted in order to undermine the election &amp; sow discord in the Democratic Party
@NicodemusVI @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews @johnpodesta @HillaryClinton I'm not a Republican. I work for a Democratic senator. Why would a Republican go around saying the Democratic party didn't break the law? You can't simultaneously claim you're literate in facts on this issue and claim there is no evidence Russia hacked the DNC or Podestas emails.
@DredMoses @KMacinNWI @Ocasio2018 Members of congress are prohibited from working &amp; being paid for work from all but practicing medicine or teaching, which requires prior approval. There are massive restrictions on publishing. I dont know how she would be any wealthier than the $174,000 we know she'll be making.
@deapthoughts @jimmyconnelly @dkjr12 @Ocasio2018 I really love the work. Nothing better than getting to go to work in the Capitol every day. Most people get burned out by 30. Basically the only person older than 30 at least in my office is the COS. &amp; I live with 4 roommates in a 2 bedroom apt.
@jimmyconnelly @dkjr12 @Ocasio2018 COS get paid decent, everyone else in the office makes often less than a full time minimum wage job. I'm a Senate staffer who makes less than $30k a year and I'm not the lowest of the pay scale either
@jimmyconnelly @Ocasio2018 I make ~$25k as a Senate staff assistant. Even if I or most staff had any power to stop the government from shutting down, I'd still make better money working at Starbucks.
@KMacinNWI @Ocasio2018 Math tells us that she'll be wealthier after making a larger salary. So I mean, yeah, cool fuckin point, Kevin
@KMacinNWI @Ocasio2018 So your point is.. hypothetically, she leaves Congress (why, does she quit? Lose? When?) and has a net worth greater than that of a community organizer/bartender.. she hasnt fulfilled championing working people? Math tells us that she'll be wealthier after making a larger salary.
@Ocasio2018 It's almost like... being a Congressperson is a job? Where they provide the service of managing government and in exchange are paid? If our elected representatives arent treating running the government as their job, you know we have a problem.
@NicodemusVI @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews @johnpodesta @HillaryClinton John Podestas emails were also stolen by Russian intelligence for the purpose of damaging Clinton to help Trump. You think maybe those same people would not have made up a conspiracy narrative about him?
@NicodemusVI @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews @johnpodesta @HillaryClinton Omg use google. If you want to be a conspiracy theorist dont expect the rest of us to give you the info you should've had already. This was published in the GOP lead Congressional Investigative Report. Delegates are not very powerful people. They're not susceptible to conspiracy.
@thehill You know this is why people complain about pundits and DC media, right?
@Dan_Aalbers @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews You can because you can look at how many people who voted for Stein believed the lines the Russians created. The populations who believe things like 'Hillary stole the nomination" are the people who sat out rather than voting for Clinton.
@NicodemusVI @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews The rigged convention line came directly from Russian trolls. Directly.
@Wolf61010 @TAPSTRIMEDIA @GarryBerger @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews You're saying of the people who chose the presidency, the people who made no choice at all are more relevant than the people who died up to a ballot box &amp; picked none of the above knowing their candidate couldn't win? Im gonna put this with the people who actually made the choice
@GarryBerger @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews The math is based on solid predictions. If your #1 issue is the environment, you choose Dems over Republicans every time. They are objectively, mathmatically closer to the Green party on the environment. If ranked voting were instituted, Clinton is 2nd for Stein voters.
@charles_rot @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews I dont think you read the tweet. Its precisely that the author cares about. Because Jill Stein voters gave the election to Trump, knowing she couldn't win and choosing to give them your vote anyways means you didn't participate.
@WatchdogsBook @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews They arent legitimate votes. You, third party candidates, and third parties all know they arent playing to win. If you expect to be able to give your vote to anyone (you could write in anyone) you dont understand how our democracy works. We all voted for nominees. Jill wasnt it.
@Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews Environmentalism is one of the absolute most important issues to me. Voting Green Party is a wasted vote. Fight me
@Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews We live in a social democracy where our society votes for nominees. You can't expect to be able to caste your vote for your best friend all the time. Participating in democracy is not saying "I dont really like the two candidates, so Ill give my support to one I know wont win."
@GOOHWTBS @Ali_H_Soufan @AndyRichter @NBCNews We live in a social democracy. You dont always get to vote for your best friend. Thinking you deserve to is an unrealistic and immature vision of what voting really is. Sometimes it just is the lesser of two evils. You will never participate in democracy if you dont see that.
@Kevin_Goldstein Nelson Cruz, tossed me a ball from the outfield. I saw him play a lot of single A.
@philgrogers This makes you sound even more cold and manipulative than the Cubs. Even they don't mention their advanced stats with him in the lineup in their press conferences when they diminish his abusive behavior.
@Letterbomber Or it's possible that real people are hurt when their favorite teams brush away violence and put a player on the field who's a horrible person? People who've been abused, their families - things like this cause real pain. You're annoyed by people pointing this out?
@JamoHillier @JulieDiCaro Why is it that abusers and violent offenders who happen to play sports or are high profile people get the benefit of treatment being considered a viable way to fundamentally change them, when regular citizens would end up incarcerated?
@realaxelfoley Just now starting to have second thoughts? This tweet wouldve fit better in like, 2015. Or 2009. My second thoughts boiled into opting the fuck out a long time ago
@jonallendc This seems like an outgoing House GOP is trying to prevent their 2020 nominee from being attached to a deficit they caused by just.. never giving him a budget to veto.
@Acosta @PressSec You should honestly ask her this exact question.
@senorrinhatch Did your office... cut out one of the actual founding fathers present at the genesis of our constitution and paste your head onto them?
@VyKershner @TamaraPiety @CNNPolitics The tweet said there were no women and only white guys. I said there are, so your point is .. what about the rest? We already established they're all old white dudes. Everyone's tired of old white politicians, my point is that there are non-men polling really really well
@rdavis4693 @imwithher61 @CNNPolitics Beto had unparralled gains in first time voters, 8% of voters in Texas switched party or split a ticket to vote for him, he won independents, he raised $70 million dollars, and he lost by less than 2%. In TEXAS. GOP has 4 voters to every 3 Dems. He wins w/ those #'s nationwide.
@rdavis4693 @imwithher61 @CNNPolitics Appealing to working class white voters is not about having old white men. That's not how politics works in this century. Obama won PA, MI, OH, WI, IO twice and IN once.
@peter_j_finaldi @CNNPolitics I think theres like, 4 out of 40. Did you read the poll or look at the photo..?
@redsunrising99 @TamaraPiety @CNNPolitics Hahahahahaha
@TamaraPiety @CNNPolitics There are women.. and non white people.. in the photo right there. The poll had, among others, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Eric Holder. Booker, Harris &amp; Warren were just behind Biden &amp; Beto.
@JunkScience @politico https://t.co/yph7nyPqYv
@brianschatz Trumps entire self image is based on the optics of everything and what everyone thinks of him. If anyone ever actually asked him tough questions that the president should be able to answer, we would read headlines about how he left the interview &amp; sulked around the White House.
@brianschatz This is the best idea. Journalists seem to have forgotten that debates used to have complex policy discussions where they demanded candidates give detailed explanations of their proposals. Now since we know Trump just makes it all up, they literally just never ask.
Oh my god, right? Remember when the President was someone who spoke to the American people and explained concepts and their own political priorities? Imagine if Obama never explained how an insurance marketplace would work and just keep saying "OBAMACARE OR SHUTDOWN" https://t.co/w8vSM0WKB3
@ShesAllWrite @rachelEfish Scott Walker's an idiot and was a horrible governor but saying anyone who would vote for him is stupid is how you get people thinking the left is elitist and obnoxious.
@burdmen441 @JeffYoung @MEPFuller I agree with you about how absurd this judges ruling is, but I think it's bad for journalists to write stories that take all nuance out of the issue and can lead to people being objectively misinformed. Especially since saying "ACA thrown out" is a very attention grabbing line
@burdmen441 @JeffYoung @MEPFuller Sure. But at this level, with a sweeping declaration based on existing federal government policy, will absolutely be appealed to the circuit court. This judge also just didn't
@politico I sincerely hope @politico remembers their job isn't to amplify politician's press releases on their stationary. Who wants to tell them?
@politico Did his advisors already leave before they could remind him to stay on message with the GOP line? "Immigrants are scary &amp; dangerous"? I thought we had to stop travel &amp; all entry because terrorists were embedded among all groups of people, like the ones hiding in Latina migrants?
@politico Wow. This sounds like The Onion. This is at best in extremely poor taste and worst gives his speakership just a dash of racism. To encourage extra travel from foreign nationals while his party has demonized immigrants &amp; sought to stop all travel by a religious group, why?
@Imani_Barbarin @Mad_Jamaican @JeffYoung Other protections impact people who already have insurance. It's not useless, that's just ridiculous. The judge didn't DECIDE anything, he made a declaratory judgment not an injunction. It doesn't change the law and can't change the governments policies. The ACA is still law.
@trekbek @JeffYoung @ashleyfeinberg Yes you will. This wasnt an injunction: it doesn't and can't stop anything. All the same ACA functions exist as before and will as the case goes through higher courts, and no legal scholar seems to think the 5th circuit would ever agree.
@JeffYoung @MEPFuller This is alarmist and not even true. The judge made a declaratory judgment, not an injunction. So the government from federal to state can and will continue as before with ACA. One judge at his level can't bind the wholegovernment. I'm surprised this made it past editors.
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill .... The Hill is not a blog. It's a paper. You're pretty impossible to try and interact with since you just say everything is fake and biased. Enjoy that world üëã
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill Here. Here it is from The Hill. The source we're literally on right now.	 https://t.co/OefAqKWDLi
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill If you think the country can survive with the government shut down for 2 years, you clearly dont understand what a shutdown actually means.
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill NPR is a nationally funded journalistic outlet. Its paid for by the Republican federal government. I can give you like, 3 separate independent polls that have the same results. Or you could just accept that you have a position, and most Americans disagree. That's fine.
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill You are in the minority here. Your view is not in line with most of America's. Neither is the Presidents.
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill NPR poll data from yesterday - 74% dont support shutting government down for a wall. More than two thirds of Americans dont think building a wall is a priority and more than 50% dont think it should be even considered.
@GentemanC @thehill Does your boss at your government affairs/policy org know your thoughts on the merits of using developmental disabilities as a way to p0wn some libs? Is that part of your strategy in advancing veterans issues?
@WaffMom @thehill That's objective false. I'm guessing you're counting all the people who voted for Trump in 2016. Opinions change. Maybe some never liked the wall idea. America is 300 million people and an overwhelming majority of us dont at all support building a wall.
@smith_barnara @thehill You seem to think America is only for people who agree with you. I know it's easier to rationalize disliking people with a different opinion, but socialists, Democrats, people who dont want to spend $30 billion on a fake solution, they are American 100%. This IS America.
@forthepatrie @Spacemancpu @thehill I mean... you dont really believe that at this point... right? Did you used to say Mexico will pay for it? Even if a wall did anything to stop illegal immigration it's not like America gets a check for each person who doesn't cross the border.
@GentemanC @thehill I'm guessing you think of yourself as a good person in real life, so do better. It's really easy, Craig.
@GentemanC @thehill You can be a giant asshole on the internet AND not use an incurable disorder as an insult
@IsaLeshko @averykayla @TopherSpiro @TVietor08 @sethmoulton But you should let them know you didn't get any notification when you should have on one of his publicly available meetings &amp; that you'd like them to double check.
@IsaLeshko @averykayla @TopherSpiro @TVietor08 @sethmoulton They can't and wouldnt take constituents off of official mailing lists for expressing any kind of opposition. No one's office has the staff to do all that.. or the interest
@PhilipRucker Quote of the year, 2018.
@Ocasio2018 This isn't really a policy conversation, it's more a statement of values and on the job of the Senate. The letter is urging bipartisan investigation of the President. I truly can't see where business would define or demand that position from them as former senators.
@themainepain @ShaneGoldmacher Source on death from keystone xl or directly because of Mary Landrieus decisions?
@atrupar This is an argument intended to make people think Trumps crimes are no big deal. Notice, because they will keep changing the argument. It's no longer that "The President did nothing wrong", now the argument is "We have more important stuff to do so just move on." #Impeachment
@MayThewords @politico The government funds Planned Parenthood precisely because no one can provide high quality women's health care any cheaper.

@jack With your immense wealth, why take advantage of a free meditation center? Why not donate to @unhcr or @amnestyusa while the #Rohingya people are being driven out &amp; murdered in Myanmar? This is in such bad taste especially bc your company's platform contribites to that violence.
@jack Social media company's excuse for not stopping the spread of violent propaganda that is contributing directly to genocide has been that you cant translate Burmese. Why take your time in Myanmar to meditate instead of using any amount of time to try &amp; solve your company's problem?
@jack How do you feel comfortable promoting tourism in #Myanmar while an international humanitarian crisis is ongoing instead of using your platform to speak about it? Where Twitter &amp; Facebook users are using the platform to incite direct violence by posting families names &amp; locations?
@jack I'm glad you're willing to read replies, because I have questions. How are you able to go on a meditative vacation to a country that is currently engaged in genocide, the violence of which has been exacerabated &amp; often created by social media companies- Twitter &amp; Facebook?
@CNNPolitics Is this even a saying? I mean maybe I'm just out of the loop but are dogs known for.. choking?
@PhilipRucker @mviser Oh my god, @PhilipRucker you re-wrote the same article that's been floating around from omnipotent DC reporters about Elizabeth Warren? This is getting ridiculous.

@tjvol49 @NBCNews I know you've been whipped up into believing this is a far left issue but a clear majority of Americans want things like background checks &amp; limits on purchasing. Sorry.
@NBCNews Democrats need to use messaging to make sure they outline that issues like gun control ARE bipartisan in reality - remember it's only among congressional Republicans where background checks are far left of center. They need to make it clear the GOP is out of touch w what ppl want

@RogueChocolate @ScottHech But if this was a court enforced treatment program, I sure hope MAT is available - i read just recently that it was decided that methadone treatment is medically necessary &amp; jails must provide it. So I wonder if same rules apply in this situation
@RogueChocolate @ScottHech Medication assistance isn't best for every opioid dependent person. Some have bad responses to naloxone, Suboxone or Methadone - they are very different chemicals that can lead to more difficult withdrawal. So some may choose to simply undergo medically supervised withdrawal
@ScottHech 2 YEARS of inpatient drug treatment?? That's an incredible amount of time to spend institutionalized. Even the smallest neurological changes that take the longest for a dependent brain to return from are done after a few months. What can you possibly do 2 years in?

@washingtonpost Why on earth is this your headline, @washingtonpost? To take part of testimony that makes the murder of an innocent person like not such a big deal without even mentioning that James Field killed someone while marching with neo-Nazis? Do better.
@u4eahh @curaffairs Not a Joe Biden fan, just disappointed that I can't distinguish between the tweets of a researched, journalistic publication and some "take downs" from just anyone on Twitter
@Ameistraei @cogita_semper @curaffairs I like their deep dives, and it's probably because they're so well researched that I think it's a bit off brand to make your POV so outwardly known &amp; expressed through not particularly well thought out or written jokes
@rdsathene @curaffairs I'm not a particular fan of Joe Biden at all. My problem with this among lots of other tweets is that its NOT substantive. I dont expect everything to be serious in tone but I do expect to see a different feed from a journalistic agency than political randoms on Twitter.
@PeterAlexander "President picks up baby for picture" qualifies as a headline now?
@ananavarro üôÑ when does this "presidents are perfect after they die" talk from reporters end?
Oh my god, YES. This is why I can't buy into government conspiracies, because people who work in government are generally not much smarter and don't usually stay past 5 anyways. Not much time to cook up successful plots to run the world https://t.co/oevUZExcml
@curaffairs Your account doesn't speak anything like a journalistic outlet with any sense of impartiality or reporting as a first priority. I followed because I read some good writing, I'm unfollowing because I thought this was journalism not just mediocre hot takes
I think most people would be surprised to hear how few in Congress pay their interns. I can count on one hand who does.

@HuffPost Foreign politics doesn't check approval ratings about a decision made unilaterally by a president. They don't take it with caution, they take it as concrete policy. They act on these. They choose who to include in working from these decisions. These decisions are important. #G20
@pbump I mean we know Trump had nothing to do with writing a condolence letter to the nation. That's where the (closest thing to) reasonable advisors have to come in and do his job for him. They operate with less of his nonsensical outrage w/ everyone. He has nothing to say, like McCain
@andrewc38968132 @Coqui37664746 @seanhannity Actually they factually just.. are not. Some low income pay no federal income tax. Do you have any data about OcasioCortez' finances or that she wouldnt show taxes bc I searched &amp; cant find anything. She couldve not even qualified for taxes w tips. You know her take home pay?
@NRATV @OliverLNorth So @OliverLNorth, who's most notable contribution to public life is that he helped sell weapons to Iran, under sanction I might add, is now presiding over the most notorious weapons advocate in the U.S.. Poetic almost. And embarrassing for the NRA, not that they're self aware.
@Coqui37664746 @seanhannity The way you add your credentials that you're Puerto Rican and from the Bronx to try and add credence to your point is ridiculous. Or do you just choose to like identity politics when it suits you?
@Coqui37664746 @seanhannity You can't possibly think that cash tips from a bartending job is even comparable to the taxes from someone who runs a billion dollar real estate company. Unless you want to admit that Trumps not really a billionaire?

@Possumism @RVAwonk @CNN Wow, you learned to pivot and change the subject just like Trump does. Throw the problem at someone else whose not involved, right?
@RVAwonk @CNN This is the perfect example of something uniquely dangerous about Trump as President - he gives vague demands to staff who have their own strong agendas, and they use the shell of the idea from Trump to write extreme policy knowing he won't be double checking it. #GM
@thehill This isn't even a switch in their modus operandi. Etiquette, decorum; these words come from the Trump admin only for political expediency. How many Trump tweets has Huckabee downplayed by saying "take a joke", reporters banned for tough questions. "Act as I say, not as I do."
@nytimes The political timing of this isn't lost on me. This was part of their agenda immediately after Parkland (remember written instructions given to Trump during the meeting with grieving families; "I hear you") Went back to no mention in midterms. They lose, #bumpstocks come back.

@ABC First brazen lie I'll point out: All of her emails are NOT on the White House server. All emails she sent &amp; received from her personal family email were stored on Microsofts servers. As was reported when story first broke via @jdawsey1 @CarolLeonnig.  #IvankasEmails #IvankaTrump
@Col_Reb_Sez @TeamHydeSmith @cindyhydesmith @GanucheauAdam @LamarWhiteJr @ashtonpittman @thisislarrison @VaughnHillyard @samrhall @MarshallRamsey 1)Her campaign says fake news as a strategy to get people to believe it was all vile lies from the media. This is the goal, which you gave them. 2) Using her own words on video &amp; reporting it isnt lying or mistreatment. 3)If her words were ok, donors wouldnt take back their money

@PennyRoo @TsunamiDaisy @summer_brii @Joey_Bats_4th @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv @PennyRoo So I know you blocked me and apparently I'm a bot but in case you missed it here's me pointing out legal reasons for seeking asylum (which is a separate legal concept from refuge), here it is again https://t.co/vejOS8Ueuh
@Joey_Bats_4th @PennyRoo @TsunamiDaisy @summer_brii @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv Jose, apparently I got blocked by @PennyRoo for.. I dont know what. Did they say I'm a bot? üòÇ There would have to be some pretty specific bot technology to write out replies to very specific questions and use their wording in their reply. I've never been called a bot. Cool.
@thehill 2nd time today I've had to say this about one of your headlines: this needs to have a fact check IN the title. It is objectively based on fact and your headline needs to report that.
@MFOLGeorgia @DLoesch @NRA It was a drill, but I think everyone there who doesn't know that would appreciate the sentiment.
Wow. This piece of writing is worth taking all the time you need to read it. It has lessons, information &amp; value to absolutely everyone. https://t.co/j6tv204rep
@Tweet0Fairy @TomArnold @katiet121 @ChrisLoesch @NRA @Everytown @MomsDemand A lock does not keep people safe when what it's supposed to contain is out and doing the only thing it's made to do; shoot &amp; kill. It does not check to see how many people use that lock. It doesn't check to make sure its secure. Maybe a gun has inherent dangers.
@ScottHech I'm sorry you're having to endure ridiculous online harassment for literally doing the venerable work that's enshrined in the constitution and made famous by every police procedural drama in history. They should know by now.
@LarrySabato I don't think it'd be accurate to say MS is too far for Democrats to reach &amp; gain enough support to win based on election results alone, there's too many variables (turnout, voter suppression, gerrymandering) to say whether or not a plurality of a state would want Dems in office.
@realDonaldTrump If you want examples of how Trump's "joke" tweets have an impact, look at the replies here - many of whom show people who didn't know of Snipes before but now think there was concrete wrongdoing in the FLA election. He's planted the seed "Brendas a criminal" w joking deniability.
@shin_inouye @ABC Word is that new security contractor "Google Translate" is set to take over all international intelligence work
@NathanJRobinson In a weird way, Trump would have to pivot to attack him since he has spent so much time feigning outrage at "how he was treated" and how the nomination was stolen from him, which in Trump terms is basically a favorable rating
@RozzaKat13 @Liz_UNfair @KyleKashuv @Ryan_Deitsch @delaneytarr Look at the adult sticking up for a child trying to put down the unprecedented work he and his classmates have accomplished while feigning outrage at someone pointing this out! Selective morality!
@Ryan_Deitsch @delaneytarr I, as a fellow young person, am eternally grateful. Knowing that you have peers willing to show up and take on one of the challenges of our lifetime is so powerful. Seeing you &amp; all at @AMarch4OurLives reminds me that fighting nets it's own rewards. Thank you.
Imagine having the personality that would allow you to just lie constantly for convenience without guilt or the hesitation most of us feel speaking about an issue when we arent an expert. And the gall to do it to professional fact checkers every day. https://t.co/JzIob50AM7
@daveweigel Sorry, as a former GW student I can confirm that's what most questions always end up being and is essentially every conversation among freshman poli sci students, most of whom in class say their career plan is to be president. Quite a place, GW is.
@PennyRoo @TsunamiDaisy @summer_brii @Joey_Bats_4th @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv A few reasons: robbery often ending in shooting, kidnapping squads, murder being the leading cause of death for boys 10-19 &amp; a total murder rate of 90.5:100k, 41 of 50 cities w highest crime in Latin America, stores have no food to sell, terrorism from drugs trafficked to the US.
@PennyRoo @TsunamiDaisy @summer_brii @Joey_Bats_4th @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv Every family has different reasons for seeking asylum- a right given by int'l law. The¬†Refugee Convention of 1951¬†and the¬†Refugee Protocol of 1967. Those establish the right of people whose life is under threat in their countries to seek shelter in a country that they deem safe.
@PennyRoo @TsunamiDaisy @summer_brii @Joey_Bats_4th @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv You proved yourself wrong by saying migrants come here for "nothing!" &amp; then proceeding to give a reason for seeking refuge.
And it speaks to the misguided criticism of Pelosi, who is a much more progressive leader than Schumer, who himself is very pro-Wall Street, big business capitalism and is hardly a progressive voice https://t.co/jOoHJ7n2fa
@TipsForYouDaily @dannygonzalez this is rife for parody
@thehill Your headline needs to include a disclaimer that it is very much based on facts, checked over and over by multiple sources from federal agencies to independent science
@CuomoPrimeTime @CBP_McAleenan Well I'm sure @ChrisCuomo agrees, I mean tear gas isn't that bad at all, right Chris? That's what you said?
This is so crucially true. The portraiture of Trump voters, terms like "the Heartland", depicting rural &amp; southern voters as all in the same - this is damaging. It hurts how we think of our fellow citizens &amp; the diversity of opinion the media ignores in favor of simplicity. https://t.co/p9tMDpTKFK
@davidodiba @amnestyusa @realDonaldTrump if a group of 5000 asylum seekers came twice a year and we let every single one of them in it would take roughly 325 years for them to make up 1% of the american population. 		so maybe stop calling it a mass migration that poses us danger. No evidence of terrorists in these group
@tonyagdallas @amnestyusa @drmlb @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Do you know what the process of entering the US is for asylum seekers fleeing violence and terrorism? To present yourself at a border crossing and wait for US courts to assess your claim. The president closed the border crossing &amp; stopped accepting asylum applications.
@MarianViado @emmamurphyitv What do you think the legal way to apply for asylum is? To present yourself at a border crossing. They closed the border crossing. They stopped accepting applications for asylum. There is now no legal way for anyone fleeing terrorism or violence to immigrate.
@MMassalas @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv That isn't even an option for people seeking asylum. Even for people seeking normal immigration in the US, they need to have a very specific, legally defined relationship to be allowed to "sponsor" an immigrant. There is virtually no legal way to immigrate for regular citizens.
@TonyOhms @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv The right way for asylum seekers, those fleeing terrorism &amp; violence, is to present at a port of entry into the US as such. Then, wait in the US until courts decide whether they would be granted asylum. They can't because US closed border crossing and stopped all asylum claims.
@summer_brii @Joey_Bats_4th @PennyRoo @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv The procedures you're referring to are being violated by the President. The procedures have been that those who arrive at a legal port of entry, which military closed, can apply for asylum. They closed border crossings, forced to stay in Mexico &amp; have stopped all asylum procedure
@PennyRoo @justjori @bobbytaruc @emmamurphyitv Do you know why they're rushing the border? Because they closed the border crossing where they could have walked through and voluntarily surrendered to authorities until they're asylum claim was processed. This has been law for decades. Trump reversed this &amp; made these conditions
@geoff_bernz @_SheXy_ @emmamurphyitv Even if a group of 5000 asylum seekers came twice a year and we let every single one of them in it would take roughly 325 years for them to make up 1% of the American population. 		Your faux outrage at someone's humanity is political. Your disdain toward immigrants is political.
@vonnie301 @Invisiblegun1 @ComedianJoel @emmamurphyitv Were Jews fleeing the Holocaust expecting the world to "take care of them" or were they simply running from a country where their lives were at risk? By your logic, they should have had a job lined up with a house to rent and a bag full of money and food.
@vonnie301 @Invisiblegun1 @ComedianJoel @emmamurphyitv How on earth could someone come somewhere WITH a house and food? With a job lined up in a country they are fleeing to? They are at most asking for the opportunity to apply for jobs and seek housing just like everyone. At very least, to be homeless in the US so they don't die.
@emilynussbaum Shen Yun bills itself as simply about Chinese History but it's actually put on by members of Fa Lun Gong to fund and propagandize their religion which is very, very weird.
@ScottHech What you do is so important. It probably is really easy to lose track when you're day in day out with the stress of everyday work, but its inspiring - serving underrepresented peoples with full effort legal help fulfills the promise of the constitution.
This is important to point out. Even though it's probably not news to most people living with a disability. Urban planning (#WMATA included here) needs to do better. Even the Senate Floor is only accessible through one door &amp; in the office buildings, a freight elevator. https://t.co/sEqLI8X2v2
@JasonVoelker1 @Ocasio2018 Where did the debt come from? That's why I'm saying it's kind of a separate issue. Most of the budget is defense spending. Roads arent making the issue or exacerbating it. Most urban planning is about trying to maintain &amp; repair existing infrastructure. Idk of any big new ideas
@washingtonpost Wait, did ANYONE think he was a champion of human rights? Thatd be news in itself. That seems kind of off brand. #AmericaFirst , right?
@Ex_Twins_News I mean, if you can do it for cheaper, I'm sure they'd love to take you on. Local governments hate headlines like this, that's why they try really hard to do things for less cash especially since they dont have much discretionary spending for this kind of thing.
This is almost word-for-word his campaign rhetoric when he was the unabashedly far right "running for the hell of it" candidate - "Calling for a complete &amp; total shutdown of Muslims [&amp; immigration] entering the U.S. until our govt can figure out what the hell is going on." https://t.co/0l2RFmqGzn
@JasonVoelker1 @Ocasio2018 I brought up roads because you originally talked about potholes in your town that elected officials can't fix but fund bombs uinstead. My first reply was local elected officials from a town arent the ones doing that. It's not that they cant figure out how to fix roads, just no $
@JasonVoelker1 @DichotomusPrime @Ocasio2018 Separate point, but your definitely right about that. Unfortunately most of that is not going to our teachers, city planners, health specialists, road repairers, public safety, etc. I think your biggest beef might be with massive defense spending. Which, i mean, same here.
@JasonVoelker1 @Ocasio2018 Yeah. That's why I didn't really understand your point. Most elected officials at nat'l level don't either. They can set budgets overall &amp; advocate for special funding on some things but its delegated to agencies. Who all don't have much money. Federal staff mostly make $25-50k
@adammariucci @Ocasio2018 Your still making the same point as before. If you takek 50% of $1mil, human still survives. If you take 50% of $30k, not so well. That's why its proportionality that's important. Low income may not pay federal tax, but theyre still paying equal sales taxes to wealthiest in $ &amp; %
@JasonVoelker1 @DichotomusPrime @Ocasio2018 Most results go unnoticed. It's also not most elected officials jobs to fix potholes. That would be incredibly inefficient. That's why we have divided work forces &amp; agency's that are generally great at their job. They want to fix potholes but don't have the money to do it all.
@JasonVoelker1 @DichotomusPrime @Ocasio2018 There are tons of proven results from Gov led projects. Problems doesn't mean "let's scrap everything." Im not sure why you're stuck on pot holes, but despite infrastructure problems, we have a nation of interconnected highways, we have schools, we have museums &amp; public transpo.
@JasonVoelker1 @Ocasio2018 People in your TOWN are building bombs and using them in overseas warfare? And they're doing it under the guise of fixing potholes? Thatd be illegal if they're raiding discretionary funding approved for road work to build weapons. Especially if your municipal govt is doing that.
@HillaryGuess @Ocasio2018 @noreallyhowcome Pelosi wrote and pushed for the original Obamacare bills that were public option. What became the ACA and got passed isn't because it's what the speaker wanted, it's because that's what other congressmembers demanded before they would vote for it.
@DMD60 @Ocasio2018 @tripgabriel That's the point of taxing ultra wealthy businesses &amp; individuals - more equity in taxation. As of now, they are one example of a group that pays an inequitable share of taxes.
@adammariucci @Ocasio2018 ..right. The number of who's paying more in dollars isn't the question, it's a matter of proportionate taxation. Most people wont pay more than people working on Wall St but most people also wont make more in their whole life than what they make in a year.
@guerrillacrypto @Ocasio2018 LOL hopefully your bank account isn't riding on that plan
@clarb3 @Ocasio2018 What you described is trickle down economics. We tried that. It turns out when corporate leadership gets more money and higher bonuses they tend not to just give it back to their workers.
@JasonVoelker1 @Ocasio2018 That's literally the basic principle of government and taxation. If you asked for voluntary donations to build roads and fund schools you wouldn't get far. That's why literally every government is set up this way. &amp; I think taking the idea back to DC was the idea.
@EffLieHub @Ocasio2018 You really owned the libs with this one
@dross144 @scifilovinhomo @Honu_23 @pamwallace @Ocasio2018 I can guarantee you were expecting if you used big words and specifics you would just win the argument. Btw, the proper way to address "Ms." Ocasio is Congresswoman or Representative.
@Ocasio2018 When your cousin's a Congresswoman talking politics at Thanksgiving really becomes a whole new thing
THIS is what every elected official needs to ask themselves every day. Our elected officials are spending half of their term in office focused on winning their next. They're spending all of their time making decisions based on what wont lose them voters instead of what they need. https://t.co/Dn6vbDTI7Y
@KTLA @samswey Yep, this is what happens when you plan a giant city based on the immortal automobile
@JohnQAdams16 @NBCNews Yeah uh his name is on the legal briefings and in the article you're commenting on. If you need to SEE him you'll probably have to call his office. Might have a hard time.
@cynthiathomas53 @NBCNews We as a society, via constant court challenges from every state in the union going up to the Supreme Court, over decades, have already found that a fetus is not guaranteed rights like the woman carrying it. It's also been found by the medical &amp; legal world to not be murder.
@sentientdreamer @AP I have no idea what point you're trying to make about pipes and Lowes. But I do know that the manufacturing, marketing and selling of firearms is objectively an industry. Just like every other market good in the world. I've never even heard anyone try and make your point.
@wes_eastridge @AP As people have had to point out for idk, decades now, Chicago the city (where I'm from) is not walled off from the world. Loose gun laws exist in suburbs and in Indiana which is about 25 minutes away. Concealed carry is allowed. By far not strictest laws. https://t.co/lZOVQk6ep3
@wes_eastridge @AP 1) Your argument is wrong &amp; has been made by like a million times. This is not a new point your bringing. 2) Its fucked up to use breaking news from 4 people including an ER doctor and a cop to try &amp; very sarcastically "own some libs on gun control".
@shaunking This is why politically engaged people from across the country need to support @espyforsenate with the same enthusiasm as they did Beto - this should be a winnable race. #EspyforSenate #MSSen
@AP This is horrifying and upsetting. Every time I read news after a mass shooting and feel awful I genuinely wonder how people who work for the gun industry and the people in power ignore thesd tragedies because of lobbying and money.
@ErieWahoo @Indians B) If it's a symbol of pride, what is it supposed to be proud of? It's not a respectful showing of pride to make a mascot out of a race of people- you're putting a cartoon of them on uniforms along with bears, animals and socks. It's not your heritage to take pride in.
@ErieWahoo @Indians Its racist because it's a cartoon drawing meant to represent "Indians" and it has exaggerated stereotyped features. It's literally colored bright red. A) It doesn't really matter if it doesn't offend you, you arent part of the group of people its caricaturing
@Charann443 @delaneytarr Literally no idea where you got the "fix it" in quotes from or where there was anything related to a stereotype or you being stereotyped in my reply or the original tweet
@politicallost2 @delaneytarr LOL I'm trying to imagine actually thinking this was true.
@Charann443 @delaneytarr Hi, as a Male, I'm gonna go ahead and let you know this is not male bashing. I appreciate you taking up the cause of being offended on behalf of all men but you can stop now, thanks
@ErieWahoo @Indians What I see when I see this: üëá		What I think when I see someone with a Twitter identity based on a racist cartoon: why are you like this https://t.co/Bz6iHFC7wE
@MarkyBillson @Indians I'm a huge baseball fan. I even had a hat with the Chief logo with I was a kid. But after understanding the context of racial caricatures it comes from &amp; just.. growing up I realized for the better of the game &amp; cultural progress it needs to go, like minstrel shows &amp; blackface https://t.co/EMJdefEDDr
@MarkyBillson @Indians No, it most definitely exists. I don't doubt that you &amp; other fans THINK your good intentions outweigh the racism, but they don't. I literally studied this logo in college both in cultural anthro &amp; art history as an academic example of racist imagery along w cartoons from '20's.
@CleOptiRealist @Indians @ChiefWahoo47 when they inevitably get rid of the logo surely you guys will come out of this looking GREAT https://t.co/Zmpfe6cKp3
@Indians Maybe you should consider not being named after an outdated way of referring to an ethnicity with your mascot being a literal caricature of that ethnic group. Just a thought
@Umbliago @CREWcrew @MichaelAaron64 Its already resulted in Kellyanne Conway being found to have violated the hatch act at least once. They've probably accomplished more but I found that out just from reading their press release on this particular complaint
@NeKap @CREWcrew I know the OSC found Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act in response to the work of @CREWcrew at least once. Unfortunately it's still up to people who are ultimately employed by the president to decide disciplinary actions.
@blabbercrumb @politico The problem is that theres no substance because theres no substance to what the president is saying. But by virtue of him being the president, it has an impact so they report it. It's kind of a lose-lose for literally everyone involved, including us who have to read it.
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats So your point is, even while campaigning for months/years, debating, being elected, she should have just shut up and said "I don't have any experience so I have no valid opinion" until shes served in Congress for.. how long? What's the rules your proposing? When can she talk?
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats I'm sure neither you nor the conservative pundits feigning disbelief at that really believe she doesn't understand how the government is structured. Btw the way you wrote that quote is incorrect, so that kind of shows me how invested you are in your outrage in this.
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi Either you have some tangible evidence of damage done by her existing within the hundreds of democratic reps or are hearing some serious insider speak from Democrats on the hill that neither I nor the press has, or you're taking fake outrage to mean shes actually damaged Dems.
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi Participating in protests in spare time isn't sowing disunity in the democratic party. She still has participated in all orientation &amp; new member events, meetings &amp; informal caucusing. That's Pelosi's job as speaker, NOT as individual rep. Different. AOC isn't vying for speaker.
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats Why would her constituents, the people who voted for her, want to damage her/the party? All that's happened is negative coverage by conservative media. Earning her place is what she did by being elected. There is no book you get once you're sworn in called "How to Govern".
@CorazonDeKarina @Mimzzet @nickconfessore @TheDemocrats Not sure what you mean by learn "how to be a congresswoman". She won. Not having political experience isn't something you can hold over someone's head anymore. Also, many esp. in the house didn't "know how" before they were successful reps. Can you show how she hurts dems?..
@Duke_Auerstaedt @nickconfessore **IS a congresswoman.
@ashtonpittman @KristenClarkeJD This is a race that doesnt get such massive media coverage like Beto but should be supported. @espyforsenate is a great candidate in a runoff &amp; theres still time for donations &amp; time to make an impact. Remember the long shot that was winning the Alabama Senate? Doug Jones won.
As incredible as Beto's campaign was, this is just one reason why supporting @espyforsenate is really important and just might make a real difference. Already in a runoff election vs. a candidate doing a really bad job not drawing attention to her racist/questionable behavior https://t.co/sbNS7tbkhN
@JoeWilesInFla @politico You don't actually believe that, right?
@JamesMc86141084 @politico It's news because it's a public statement made by the president of the United states. It feels like TMZ because that's how Trump speaks. His comments would be relegated to TMZ if he wasnt president, just as they were when he spoke the same way as a reality TV character
@blabbercrumb @politico In the sense that it's a statement made by the president of the United states wherein he attacks a sitting congressman who's investigating him &amp; while he's calling for decorum in WH interactions... yes. Its tiring to read about bc it's ridiculous but thats Trumps fault, not press
@pjanram @politico Do you not consider public statements made by the President of the United States on high ranking elected officials worth reporting on? While there's a Court case vs. Trump himself wherein judge said he violated press's 1st &amp; 5th ammendment rights &amp; he demands "decorum" in WH?
@politico I can already hear Sarah Huckabee saying "If you want to report on every tweet out there, go ahead but we're focused on the issues that matter to the American people. These ridiculous questions are why we need rules to get the press to act with decorum."
@IllinoisASA @ILschoolboards If people&gt;products, then why was a resolution brought to a vote to arm teachers? Not only is this message completely antithetical to the resolution, it's dangerous and makes me question the legislative bodies integrity and ability. #ILJAC18
@mark_rising @ipsd204 @ILschoolboards The fact that there was ever such an insane, fringe resolution proposed and brought to a vote at @ILschoolboards is horrifying. It completely erodes my trust in it as an institution that this kind of ideological extremism festers there and is mainstream enough for a vote.

@KwikWarren People forget for some reason that leadership means you will interact with likely every member of Congress, so maybe opposition to Nancy Pelosi is coming from the people for whom was their boss who was making them work on things they hated. Democratic policies.
@elisabobisa917 @jaystebbins @KwikWarren You do when you're likely going to be leading all of the house - who does have to find bipartisanship because that's what congressional leadership does. It seems people think bipartisanship means making concessions or accepting horrible policies. It doesn't.

@washingtonpost This video was analyzed by people much more talented than I and they all concluded the same thing - the video was altered to make it seem like he did something he didn't. There's a reason why this only became an issue after they banned him. Why was nothing said right away?

@dscc @SheldonforRI I'm a huge fan of #SheldonWhitehouse. Always puts in sincere effort on a range of issues beyond those that are publicized and spoken about in the news - a hard working senator who deserves his job. #ElectionDay
@PeterRoskam came to my 4th grade class to speak sanctimoniously about civics and ethics in government. Since working in Gov, I knew he simply was lying when it came to comparing his words to his behavior. No more absentee reps. No more false claims of ethical leadership.
No longer will @PeterRoskam's office deflect calls asking why he refuses to be available to his constituency or explain away far right votes. He will have plenty of time to be in the district now that he's a private citizen. #ElectionDay #PeterRoskam #IL06

3) Im male &amp; work in politics, I DON'T feel threatened in the way Trump described. I feel threatened by the GOP's embrace of degrading trauma victims the way elected leaders have this past week. Bc I am a survivor of assault. I feel threatened by them, not accusations.#Kavanaugh
2) I'm a male victim of sexual assault. The process, hearings &amp; comments on #Kavanaugh have made me feel sick. Worse than hearing Dr. Ford has been the unprecedented way the GOP has decided to force thru just to stick it to Democrats at the cost of integrity &amp; human decency.
I started working in the #Senate in 2016. So many days I've left exasperated or angry, sure that nothing could get worse after Sessions, Gorsuch, immigration, AHCA. But today, I literally feel sick to my stomach. Today I truly don't think it can get worse after #Kavanaugh.

@AShettle @rikkipoynter Also I think my points stand, what I was referring to isn't that race determines whether or not one deaf individual would be helped but also if a larger community of friends &amp; neighbors offering help would be listened to or seen as more potential arrests or impediments to police.
@AShettle @rikkipoynter I think you're attributing alot to what I wasnt able to say in 3 tweets, which dont exactly allow me enough space to expand on thr nuance of an issue beyond yes or no when it's obviously more complicated. You're giving added points I agree with but didn't specifically write out.
@rikkipoynter @AShettle I certainly didn't say interacting w/ police was easy or not an issue for deaf white people. What I did say is that there's clear racial dynamics at play in this case where the police are deciding to pursue &amp; apprehend him &amp; continue despite neighbors offering their help.
@rikkipoynter @AShettle Thanks. Of course deaf &amp; disabled people in general face a much higher risk of becoming victims of bad police. My point was more that risk is obviously greater for POC in an already over-policed area like Paterson vs. white neighbors telling police they've got him &amp; that it's ok.

@townhallproject @davidhogg111 @PeterRoskam He hasnt bothered to meet his constituents in, according to my last conversation with his staff, "I don't know how long." I work for a Senators office.

@davidhogg111 @PeterRoskam This is my home district. He came to my 4th grade class to teach us about civics &amp; integrity in government. Now after working in the Senate and hearing his office give BS excuses about why he hasnt held a town hall in years, I know hes full of shit. #Roskam #IL #SeanCasten
3) And to be clear - I'm white, and it took me about ten seconds to picture this interaction if a deaf white man was surrounded by his neighbors speaking to the police. There would be no tension that they were about to witness a shooting. I can hear it, see it. #JusticeForPike
2) Would there be a street sign warning that a Deaf person lived there? Yes. Would the cops act with sympathy for a disabled person struggling to understand instead of see them as a potential threat needing to be removed? I have no doubt. #JusticeForPike
This is a perfect example of the benefit of the doubt that white people get in our country. Would the cops listen to the neighbors saying he's deaf? Yes. Would they even continue pursuing him if neighbors came out and said "Relax, we've got him"? No. #JusticeForPike https://t.co/7kkGTlxmKY

@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam The notion of due process would be following established procedure and precedent by using the agencies capable of investigating the veracity of this kind of claim to do so as opposed to deciding its not worth the time (last FBI investigation of abuse against J. Thomas was 3 days)
@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam That's why the Bar Association as well as a plurality of judiciary members have asked for an investigation after info was revealed to look into these claims specifically, since the original scope wouldn't have covered it. They can only ask for one though. POTUS' decision
@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam That's kind of the point though, they couldn't have known to investigate these specific allegations. This wasn't info known by one party, once Dr. Ford authorized release it was shared with whole judiciary and another letter sent to maj. chair. Grassley.
@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam The 6 background checks refer to over decades of his career - these aren't the same as investigating the veracity of specific claims, it's looking into a job candidates general background. No info was hidden - only 2 members had info and it was explicitly anonymous until revoked
RT @NolanDMcCaskill: AP says Kavanaugh was never legally able to drink while he was in high school: "The legal age in that state was raised‚Ä¶
@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam A Senator does not have the authority, constitutional or otherwise, to demand the FBI do anything. Senators do not have the resources to properly investigate claims like these. That's why it's been done by the FBI and ordered by the executive in every past nomination.
@thomaspublius @VoteCasten @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam As someone already explained, the source that blew her anonymity already confirmed no one from Feinsteins office disclosed the info.

@JacobAWohl @JacobAWohl You know putting a photo of the White House you didn't take as your cover photo doesn't automatically make you a political commentator, right? You're writing for Orange County &amp; your website has been suspended. Maybe Disneyland or a parking lot fits better
@MatthewACherry My samsung from 2 years ago does that and I didn't even know my phone was special
@tmurphy355 @FOX4 Well maybe because when a COP kills a CITIZEN that's a completely different story than when a criminal does something criminal.  Police should be held to higher standards than, I don't know, random criminals.

@aboutreed @shaunking And I think you're saying alot more than they aren't heroes; you're saying their complicit in a police industry narrative and that they have done a bad thing by coopting Kap's protest without facing the same consequence. If it was truly accepted why would Kap still be kept out?
@aboutreed @shaunking You say you're not saying they stop. So what do you actually want? What do you want players in the NFL to literally do? You clearly think the protest is useless or even harmful. Should they stand? They have a platform. What. Do. You. Want. Them. To. Do?
@aboutreed @shaunking Did you read the article I posted? the league outright created a rule that all persons on the field HAVE to stand. Any players doing it now are violating the written rules of their employer. Also, the public is very involved - see Nike ad you commented on the first place.
@_SmithCommaJohn @theneedledrop Well yeah, that's how all of life works. I wasn't aware of the going blind part of The Hustle‚Ñ¢ tho that seems new
@aboutreed @shaunking Yeah dude that was from over a year ago. The official rule banning kneeling on the field written by the league was from less than 4 months ago. AKA two seperate NFL seasons. Are you going to respond to the substantive points of my replies or just the last one, that one was easy
@_SmithCommaJohn @theneedledrop https://t.co/2EDu5VdtjH
@theneedledrop No one wants to hear about your time at Band Camp, Melon
@aboutreed @Caribehope @shaunking Also who was it SPECIFICALLY that didn't join Kap when it mattered and are now coopting his movement? Names? You also can't blame players who play across the country for not getting with what was at the time not a well defined protest. There was no call to action memo to all NFL
@aboutreed @shaunking Whether or not kneeling translates statistically to any change AT THIS TIME isn't relevant - you're suggesting they stop because 1) It hasn't yet caused measurable change 2)The first to kneel lost his job and 3)Its accepted by the league when it's literally prohibited. üíÅüèª
@aboutreed @shaunking I don't know who told you the owners are kneeling or accept it. The NFL issued a rule this year prohibiting all staff and players from not standing on the field during the anthem. Rule says they have to stay in the locker room. You're off on this on. Sorry https://t.co/TDXPMkQOHv
@aboutreed @shaunking You're not making a very salient point. They are incredibly rich but they ARE professional athletes, you're choosing to criticize their activism based on your opinion of their profession. Dont belittle their impact just bc they play a game. Their actions reach the President. #NFL

@DLoesch Dana, you are not an an advocate. You are not a leader. You are a subsidiary of weapons manufacturers. You use your voice to clean up the PR after mass shootings on behalf of assault weaponry. You do image maintenance for the AR15. Don't pretend to be a voice for anything else.
@IvankaTrump Maybe you should use your "moderating influence" to advocate for some sensible gun control.
@Sasquatch011 @LMRicketts @Cubs and it's precisely because he's not the only one on the team that it really sucks that he is. Because I've loved the Cubs since I was a kid and I'm not going to apologize for not paying money into an org who thinks "Oh dear" is an acceptable answer to us fans in the gay community
@Sasquatch011 @LMRicketts @Cubs Where do you think I said he's the only player on the Cubs? I felt just as uncomfortable watching Aroldis Chapman, a domestic abuser, pitch. One difference here is people like you feel the need to show your support for a multimillionaire to use his status to spout antigay speech.
@RizzoSober @robotlemur @LMRicketts You realize you're here in support of free will by criticizing independent people's choice to not support a franchise that can't support them? What on earth IS your point?
@LMRicketts @Cubs Im not going to be there. Sorry. You made a louder statement by trading for and defending Daniel Murphy. I've been a lifelong Cubs fan and literally had 4 tickets in my cart that I will no longer be buying. Im uncomfortable being asked to root for a player who wouldnt support  me
@OskeeAaron @natalieebush @LMRicketts @Cubs If you choose to live a heterosexual lifestyle, do you agree that you COULD begin living a homosexual lifestyle tomorrow? Or is it possible that you're heterosexual by nature and you can't change that any more than my being gay?
@skagman_john @triciawallin @LMRicketts @CarrieMuskat No, see, an opinion is something like "Pepperoni is the only acceptable pizza topping." Pretending being gay is a choice, aka "lifestyle", is the line used to add deniability to homophobia. I'm a gay man w/ brown hair. Yet no one's ever given me their opinion on my hair color.
@LMRicketts Hey Laura? This is the same premise behind "They have a black friend: they can't be racist." More importantly, the gay community is not s monolith. Billy Bean may not be concerned about #DanielMurphy 's affect on the MLB, but others are. I am. This response was.. nothing.
@GreytBeyond I find it equally uncomfortable watching Aroldis Chapman or Roberto Osuna pitch because of their history of domestic violence &amp; abuse - Players are not monoliths, they exist as people and as pro sports players.
@GreytBeyond No, there isnt. But why would you expect that I and all others need to simply accept his role in the MLB and national conversation because he's good? He's a good player AND I don't really want to root for a player who has over years said patently offensive things about who I am.
@JuliePettie @kellyawallace @WhitneyM02 You know to everyone in this debate proclaiming your love for me despite my being gay *(You accidentally keep calling that a lifestyle), I really am not feeling the love.
@onesentforth @kellyawallace @WhitneyM02 You can't disagree with a fact of who I and millions of others are. Your opinion has no bearing on whether or not I have Brown eyes or am gay. You are attributing moral character to things that are not elements of one's character. You don't get an opinion here. Sorry.
I understand why the #Cubs want a good 2B in Murphy. I also am fundamentally disappointed in #DanielMurphy. I DO feel alienated being told to cheer for a player who I know has only put me and those in my community down. Who I am =/= "agree to disagree." @Cubs @billybeanball https://t.co/lcSO6dYnAX
@JuliePettie @kellyawallace @WhitneyM02 You can't love me and others in the LGBT community and tell me that a fundamental, unchangeable part of who I am is *wrong*. You can't disagree with the fact that I have brown eyes. You can't disagree with the fact that I'm gay. Opinion is not a possibility. So say what you mean.
@Cubs I was literally just about to buy 4 tickets to the upcoming series against the Brewers but I honestly don't want to watch a player who I know has continually said disparaging things about myself and my own community. I hope the trade is worth alleviating fans. #DanielMurphy
And to be clear, taking responsibility doesn't mean changing his opinions, but he was unable to acknowledge that his comments might actually hurt fans &amp; LGBT players in all levels of sports. The response "Oh. Well dont." when asked if fans may feel unwelcome is unacceptable.#Cubs
@GreytBeyond I'm guessing you must feel similarly that NFL players who express views on the outside of playing the sport should be free from scrutiny too, right? Or is the same crowd supporting #DanielMurphy the same one up in arms when NFL players make a statement on police brutality, etc?
@JakeElman You can't be against equal rights for the gay community and be fine with the LGBT community. That's ridiculous. And thats all what he was WILLING to say to the press. Generally, highly chosen words won't express someone's feelings they have in private. #DanielMurphy #Cubs
#DanielMurphy Again avoided taking responsibility for what are clearly anti-gay convictions. He avoided the question of how his comments may make fans feel uncomfortable. As a gay fan, I am uncomfortable. Why would I be okay with someone who said he "disagrees" w/ being gay?#Cubs
@GreytBeyond It has nothing to do with literally not wanting him on the team, for me. He's good at baseball. But because of what he's very publicly said more than once, and again in official interviews after joining the Cubs, Im not a fan. It DOES matter, to fans, players, and to the game.
@whatwouldDOOdo As a fan, I feel better about the condition of the #MLB knowing that #SeanDoolittle is one of the RARE players willing to stand up and say homophobia and racism have no place in baseball. And he's been saying this long before the recent storm of exposed tweets. üëè https://t.co/DzpNxXNLdt
@BillOReilly @trumps_feed How is admitting guilt when guilty the betrayal and not the actual illegal behavior what makes you scream "Betrayal!" into the wind of your giant empty house?

@hulu_support I don't remember seeing any prompts or options about changing my commercial plan when I used the mobile app to add TV- didn't think it'd change. My plan shows limited commercials. Not sure if that's what I had before, but I never had commercial interruptions before adding Live TV https://t.co/XgDTlabPJT
@hulu_support Of course - so far both 30 Rock and Broad City (all seasons/episodes) have 4 full ad breaks. Confused because I watch both of these shows frequently and have never seen commercials until I added live TV to my plan.
@hulu_support Thats what im confused about - I had no commercials before adding live TV, but now when watching non-live shows from the Hulu library I get 4 ad breaks at 114 seconds. On the Manage Profile screen it looks like now I'd need to change my plan w/ a charge to return to 0 commercials
@hulu_support Why is it that when I started a week trial with live TV that on streaming non-live programs I have commercials now? I've never had to watch commercials before and it seems that somehow I'd have to add a significant charge to get rid of the ads.

@intheglare @mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal And just FYI so you don't keep looking like an ass in the future; According to¬†Nevada state law¬†, an "act of terrorism" is described as follows: "Any act that involves the use of violence intended to cause great bodily harm or death to the general population."
@intheglare @mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal They have already had a forum to argue if they think lawsuits from victims are frivolous and you certainly don't have the info or knowledge to say unless you work on the case. They haven't been getting the result they want so now they're shopping for a new judge in federal court.
@intheglare @mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal A) I would call the deadliest mass shooting perpetrated by an extreme ideologist terroristic but okay. B) No, you're wrong; the defendents listed in their lawsuit seeking declaratory relief are literally hundreds of victims.

@NapsAndSarcasm @mike_issac @reviewjournal Feel free to clarify your point if you think my summary isn't accurate but
@NapsAndSarcasm So, you support MGM bc it is.. fighting litigiousness? In spite of NOT being the defendant in any lawsuits alleging liability, is being very litigious (the thing you said you don't like) by definition. They're litigating to prevent hypothetical litigation that may never happen.ü§î https://t.co/ltftLGD6Jx
@Jamesgore25 @mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal Jam, Jame, Jamey. It costs $0.00 to not be like this. Try it for free today, frendo https://t.co/gYB44jX7DN
@NapsAndSarcasm @mike_issac @reviewjournal ..corporations &amp; individuals seek preemptive judgments to precede any kind of legal action their legal team can THINK of, not when they're attempting to battle a case already brought against them. If youre gonna go for the unapologetic corporatist argument at least be consistent
@NapsAndSarcasm @mike_issac @reviewjournal I'm confident enough in the premise of the argument that I can still call you an asshole and the point still stands. Your point is, "Everyone's emotional and incapable of being objective except for me", mine is seeking a preemptive ruling to prevent victims bringing suit is badü§î
@NapsAndSarcasm @mike_issac @reviewjournal And B) You're equating the victims of a terrorist attack who HAVEN'T sought damages from MGM with emotional, frivolous litigators and implying because they were shot at they must simply be distraught. Youre not ~telling it like it is~, you're being a giant asshole. Like, for real
@NapsAndSarcasm @mike_issac @reviewjournal A) Read about the hot coffee lawsuit, it's a more than proven case, which is why McDonald's lost and stopped serving coffee that was not boiling
@mike_issac @scorkren @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal Hey Mike, I know you've dug yourself into a really deep hole here, but you dont have to keep doing this. As others have pointed out, this isn't MGM defending themselves from anything- theyre seeking a declaratory ruling to absolve them of any future liability IN CASE victims sue.
@scorkren @mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal This isn't about ANY lawsuit ongoing against MGM. They're seeking a PREEMPTIVE decision to absolve them of any potential responsibility just in case any of the hundreds of people who were shot at on their property decided to sue one day. What's your stance here frendo..? ü§î
@mike_issac @BarbaraLandes4 @reviewjournal Again, we understand. I don't think it's necessary for you to explain objective things like "They could lose" to people. I think most humans understand that's one of the two outcomes. The point is #MGM is actively instigating a lawsuit against victims of a terrorist attack.
@mike_issac @reviewjournal .. Right. We understand. That's the problem. #MGM is dragging victims through litigation for a hypothetical drain on a multibillion dollar companies finances that may have never arisen to begin with. MGM is just fine, the victims of the attack have more than money to deal with.
@MGMResortsIntl @MandalayBay Did you not ask yourselves how suing the victims of a terrorist attack to prevent a multibillion dollar company being potentially liable might destroy your reputation? I will never patronize any establishment associated with #MGM. Shame. #BoycottMGM https://t.co/4klmGo3XiK

@RedClops123 @PeterDavid_PAD @realDonaldTrump So the point youre trying to make, responding to someone saying what Trump is doing is awful foreign policy, is to say ~but what about this~?

@WMALDC @replouiegohmert @TheDCVince @MaryWalterRadio The Chair of @GOPoversight, one of the most partisan chairmen in one of the most partisan hearings I've seen had to remind you that your JOB is to ask questions seeking a response in good faith, not attack.

@crazylazydayz @SoCalValleyGal Eligibility=/=use of or given benefits. YOU are eligible for social welfare if you become disabled or destitute, that doesn't mean you ARE recieving benefits. But despite paying more taxes on average, they are largely intelligible for assistance &amp; use programs less than US born.
@crazylazydayz @SoCalValleyGal What state/federal subsidies are you talking about specifically? 1) I have no idea who "You" illegals are, like lmfao who do you think you're talking to? 2) A majority of children of non-citizens are American. Period. 3)ALL non-citizens pay taxes, into social safety net.
@SoCalValleyGal but have you ever thought about the fact that non-residents are inelligible for any kind of social services and that maybe the reason we still have a homeless problem is because we never fixed it in the first place? If you think we have an adequate social services system then bye
