noteworthy line re: airstrikes, POTUS says:"This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven"
thoughts on POTUS speech?
airstikes in Syria may be on the way....President Obama says: "we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are"
Obama: "Our objective is clear: we will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy"
Obama: "While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies"
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obama to send 475 additional troops to Iraq, joining more than 1,000 forces already there.
Obama "ISIL is certainly not a state"
Obama: "ISIL is not ‚ÄúIslamic.‚Äù No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL‚Äôs victims have been Muslim."
should US be doing more to stop ISIS? 76% say yes, 15% say no (@foxnewspoll)

new @foxnewspoll: 44% say USA worse off under Obamacare, 29% say better off, 24% say no difference
good detail from @MikeEmanuelFox : 80-90 officials at WH/Pentagon/State got heads up about #Bergdahl swap, but key members of Congress didnt
colleague @JustinFishelFNC confirms: #Bergdahl doesn't want to be addressed as Sgt, says didnt earn that rank (was PFC when he disappeared)
at least 57k patients have been waiting 90+ days for initial appointments at VA hospitals+clinics (per @AP)
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Audit: Over 57,000 new patients awaiting appointments at VA hospitals, clinics.
now #Bergdahl (in Germany) is "conversing with medical staff and becoming more engaged in his treatment care plan"...Docs say he's improving
Pres Obama's job performance: 40% approve, 54% disapprove (@foxnewspoll)
Big scoop: #Bergdahl declared jihad in 2010... @JamesRosenFNC story here http://t.co/gAF6CeLfgo
it's been a year since 1st #Snowden leak. he says "I am humbled by our collective successes so far." more here:  https://t.co/NoTHv2XiGB
@KatzRKool77 thanks, Elizabeth!
split: 45% approve, 47% disapprove US releasing 5 taliban prisoners in exchange for 1 US soldier (@foxnewspoll)
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials: Congress not told of swap because Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if it leaked
just got word from the Pentagon: #Bergdahl still hasn't talked to his parents
Pres Obama on #Bergdahl backlash: "I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington. That's par for the course"
now a taliban commander says the #Bergdahl deal makes it more appealing to capture other US Soldiers http://t.co/PUdPywfAju
a majority---57%---are concerned talks w/ terrorists will lead to more US soldier hostages in new @foxnewspoll
some senators have more questions than answers after seeing admin evidence supporting #Bergdahl swap. i'll report @foxnews in 5mins
so #Bergdahl walked off base before he was captured, too. in 2010, Army investigators talked to fellow soldiers. said Bowe was bored
been watching the #Bergdahl video all AM, about to break it down frame by frame @foxnews w/ @BillHemmer &amp; @marthamaccallum
took 1min for Navy SEALs to: land, shake hands w/Taliban, pat down #Bergdahl, walk him to chopper, pat him down more throughly, and take off
SEC HAGEL: "I do not know of specific circumstances or details of US soldiers dying as a result of efforts to find and rescue Sgt #Bergdahl"
the '10 Army investigation of #Bergdahl disappearance concluded he willfully walked off base; can't say BB is a deserter w/o knowing intent
in captivity #Bergdahl was automatically promoted PFC to Sgt...upcoming promotion to SSgt not automatic bc not missing, per @Martin_Dempsey
parents of Lt Darryn Andrews, killed in Afghanistan in 09, found out their son died looking for Bergdahl--on facebook http://t.co/Xty0ZzKnjt
this AM @Martin_Dempsey posted on Facebook: "Our Army‚Äôs leaders will not look away from misconduct if it occurred," about Sgt Bowe #Bergdahl
Obama: WH consulted w/Congress for "quite some time" re: "possibility that we might need to execute a prisoner exchange" to save #Bergdahl
Sgt Bowe Bergdahl still hasn't met with his family since being freed, President Obama said in Poland
POTUS: "whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, we still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity. Period" #Bergdahl
did Sgt #Bergdahl desert? POTUS: "we obviously have not been interrogating Sgt Bergdahl...he's having to undergo a whole battery of tests"
@Morgan_Cody_1 nice---thanks, Morgan!
Carney was just asked why Susan Rice said #Bergdahl "served the United States with honor and distinction" on ABC Sun. He referred Q to DOD

Last night's @SpecialReport piece: ObamaCare regulation causing a stir for some restaurants http://t.co/nAZlUyJiY4
crashed the kitchen at Domino's in Old Town Alexandria, VA today http://t.co/S7Pmwy7AZy
Tonight, I'll explain how the Affordable Care Act will soon impact the way you dine out...@SpecialReport w/@BretBaier. My report will be 2nd
Like it or not, calorie counts coming to a menu near you...it's part of the Affordable Care Act. My write up: http://t.co/OUHpqI5wC1
@twzeigler on both sides of the counter
@dunnerkeil haha
What do you think: should Feds force restaurants with 20+ locations to list calories next to all menu items? #ACA #Obamacare
Recent research by Drexel U School of Public Health: 80% of diners notice calorie labels, 26% of them change orders. Result: 151 fewer cals
So far, the FDA has not answered my questions about when these regulations kick in, or what happens if a business can't afford to comply
Sanchez: "I want people to know...what they're eating...but I don't want to do it at the expense of...those small businesses"
Rep Sanchez backs legislation to permit some businesses, like Domino's, to post calorie counts online or on Apps
Rep Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) tells us she supports displaying nutritional information, but that these FDA regulations are an "overreach"
Domino's spokeswoman: "To re-do the menu boards every time something changes...would cost (franchisees) several thousand dollars a year"
For 13yrs, Domino's has offered nutritional info online, where their customers see it, and they urge FDA to accept that as compliance
Domino's says FDA has suggested they make new menus w/ calorie RANGES for pies instead but execs say 90% of customers never even enter store
Now imagine walking into Domino's &amp; seeing menu board w/calorie info for all 34 mil possibilities. A regulation in ACA soon requires that
Amazing: Domino's says they offer 34 million different combinations of pizza. That's based on algorithm factoring toppings, crusts, etc

now we know http://t.co/VdbblWKIK5 supported 83k concurrent users 12/23, the day deadline to enroll by 1/1 was extended bc of heavy traffic
more from HHS: "enrollment nearly doubled in the days before the January 1 coverage deadline compared to the first few weeks of the month"
"December enrollment so far is over 7 times that of October and November" at http://t.co/VdbblWKIK5 per HHS

basically: if u can't access http://t.co/g5Mst1L504 by tonight's deadline, as long as u are in "queue" you have til tomorrow night to enroll
CMS says: "This is similar concept as Election Day: if you are in line when the polls close, you still get to vote."
high demand + consumers enrolling from multiple time zones are primary reasons for admin extending deadline from 12/23 to 12/24

enrollment breakdown through 2 months: fed exchange 137,204. state exchanges: 227,478. TOTAL: 364,682
HHS: "Enrollment in the federal Marketplace in November was four times greater than October's reported federal enrollment number"
Sebelius: "It's important to remember that this open enrollment period is six months long and continues to March 31, 2014."
