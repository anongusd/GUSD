3 months of no income tax, what would you do? MAKE MONEY, right? makes sense to me. That would grow the economy. #tcot

ahhh NASCAR humor...everything can be said with #'s
@LPGeorgia hmmm, then he must have had a #77 on the side, since we know he can't drive worth a poo ;-)
@MollyNichelson true, both have great defenses, TN has a scary offense to go with, where Pitt's O is less than spooky, not quite scary
@MollyNichelson that, and Vincent Jackson is a local boy! He has talent!
