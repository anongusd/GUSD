Gov. Laura Kelly: "If we put partisanship aside and Kansas families first, then we can truly live up to our motto, Ad Astra Per Aspera. And the story we write together will be one of cooperation and prosperity. Now, let’s get to work." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly: "Kansans are no stranger to hardship or hard work. We don’t want things handed to us. We don’t expect life to be easy. That raw grit - our fierce determination – is part of our history. It makes us	who we are. " #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly: "I’ll promise you this: I will do everything in my power to set the right tone. I will listen every day to leaders from both parties and to the people of this state. We’ll take the best ideas no matter where they come from – and we’ll work together." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly: "Kansans want us to work together to make our state better. That means cooperation, compromise, and bipartisanship.	No one person – not even the governor – can act alone to achieve consensus. That’s the whole point -- working together." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly said she would have an open-door policy: "Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve worked with all of you. As governor, that will continue. My door will be open. I will listen. But, I was elected to rebuild our state." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly pledges to keep a campaign promise: ",I’m proud to honor my promise to balance the budget without raising taxes. As many of you have already said, we must show restraint. Because ultimately, we do not know what lies ahead." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly, on other issues commanding attention: "There are so many things we haven’t discussed. Our crumbling roads and bridges. Public	safety. Higher education. Mental health. Meeting the demands of our rapidly changing economy. I could go on and on." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly, building to close of speech, touches again on key priorities. She said: "We must restore funding to Kansas schools and end the cycle of litigation. We must expand Medicaid so we can create jobs, keep our tax dollars in Kansas, save our rural communities." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly, also on child issues: "My budget includes funding to hire more, qualified social workers and reduce their caseloads. We	will restore funding cuts to our prized Children’s Initiatives Fund, where we know our investments have the greatest impact." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly, on foster care woes: "This is an emergency. These are our children in our communities facing abuse, neglect and worse. Let’s remember Evan Brewer, Jayla Haag, Mekhi Boone. And many more who needed our help. I refuse to forget them." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly, on Kansas foster care system: "Nothing has made me more angry than the callous disregard some agency leaders demonstrated towards our vulnerable children and their families." She also pointed to "incompetence and lack of transparency." #ksleg
Gov. Laura Kelly said she would appoint a bipartisan working group to finalize a path forward on Medicaid expansion. The plan will be submitted to the Legislature by the end of January, she said. #ksleg
