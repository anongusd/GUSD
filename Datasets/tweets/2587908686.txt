@actelion_com One challenge for #pulmonaryhypertension patient(s) is a patient who may only see a medical professional every 3 or 4 months and they (might) really need care on a weekly to every two-week basis. #RareDiseaseDayChat
@actelion_com Along with ensuring a #pulmonaryhypertension patient is seen at an expert PH center, one might consider palliative care… as part of their treatment goals - utilizing social workers or psychologists, and/or mental health providers. #RareDiseaseDayChat

We've heard countless stories from patients &amp; caregivers from all over the globe. Patients need to listen to their bodies &amp; advocate for themselves even if it takes multiple doctors/experts to ultimately diagnose you and get the proper tests/treatments. #PHAwarenessChat #phaware https://t.co/tFf82rK8mK
Proper and early diagnosis is crucial for patient care, and it begins with awareness. Awareness within the medical community, for the general public, for health and policy makers as well. #PHAwarenessChat #phaware 💜💙💚🧡❤️ https://t.co/tFf82rK8mK
PH patients spend an average of 2 to 3 years seeking an accurate diagnosis. 75% of patients will have advanced PH by the time they are diagnosed. #PHAwarenessChat #phaware 💜💙💚🧡❤️ https://t.co/tFf82rK8mK
