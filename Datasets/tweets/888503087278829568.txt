This article is a perfect explanation of my relationship with country music and new found love of Kacey Musgraves. 	Golden Hour on repeat ALL DAY. 	Cc: @caseykatims @Chris_E_Russell
"And that‚Äôs why Musgraves plays such an unusual and necessary role as an entry point and advocate for the kinds of people who have often felt unwelcome in country fandom, differently from anyone who came before her."
"The genre needs explicitly queer-affirming artists because it has been explicitly anti-queer in the recent past, and much of it continues to be anti-queer today. "
