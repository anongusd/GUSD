It's amazing to me that my joke about the conflict in India and Pakistan trended more than the story of the actual conflict itself. Sometimes it seems like people are more offended by the jokes comedians make about an issue than the issue itself.
Actually if you watch my stand up you'll see that I did make jokes after my mother was shot in the head. As a comedian I use comedy to process pain and discomfort in my world but I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that's not what I was trying to do. https://t.co/OuVnkHyIfG

I'm joining @pestononsunday on itv  now. If you're reading this tweet and it's not a Sunday then just ignore this message.
In a previous tweet I said Mike Pence supports electrocuting gay people which is not true, he supports torturing them. My apologies.
And your friend Mike Pence supports torturing Gay people to make them straight. https://t.co/rnsPgQShDJ
@Jonathan_Witt you're right. I should have said torturing.
@Jeff_ZN0203 dope🙌🏽
@Jonathan_Witt does he not support torturing gay people until they become straight?
@YTM1staWu1fy @youngblackcon @Jonathan_Witt I'm not making this up. Read 4th circuit court ruling on North Carolina voter id laws.
@YTM1staWu1fy @youngblackcon is not the requirement that's racist. It's the blocking of access to getting an id that's racist.
@Jonathan_Witt @youngblackcon our voter id laws are not aimed at disenfranchisement of poor people. It's super easy to get an id in Sa.
I had a wonderful evening with everyone who joined tonight's #guardianlive event in London. Thank you all for making my night.
@youngblackcon I hear you. But I argue smart politicians know how to obscure- few support "racism" but many support monster voter id law.

@SaidaRunThis @sartu_ahmed @Kaepernick7 flawed definitely but we cannot deny that some (tiny) progress has been made. Now we go backwards
@sartu_ahmed @SaidaRunThis Kaepernick said he didn't vote because it was all the same. That's what I was referring to in my tweet to him.
@sartu_ahmed @SaidaRunThis @Kaepernick7 Muslims, Immigrants people of colour- we're all in for an even tougher time than usual. 🌎 💔
@sartu_ahmed @SaidaRunThis @Kaepernick7 it's easy to undervalue the importance of a vote when you've never had it taken away.
@sartu_ahmed @SaidaRunThis  when some people throw projectiles at the police, the police now have the justification to shut it down.

@kbheld @Chi_Humanities thank you for joining. Our compassion is going to be put to the test like never before.

@JessicaPritzker thank you so much for joining. I feel like we all know nothing but we can learn everything together.
@MeWeFree Not knocking the good he's done but ppl are already trying everything to suppress the black vote, this thinking only helps them
@MeWeFree the wrong President can harm so many more people than one person can help. It's not one or the other- a vote is also a protest.
