@kommando_kody So smirking is bad, but attacking the right is okay? https://t.co/I0qBLOWucu
@jack Have you heard of the 1st Amendment? You should check it out!
RT @MarkDice: Buzzfeed just admitted that their bombshell from this morning about Trump supposedly telling Michael Cohen to lie to Congress‚Ä¶
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump What about Hillary, huh? Did she lie? Was she the one who colluded with Russia? Yes and yes.
RT @KamVTV: Buzzfeed : Trump told Michael Cohen to lie		Also Buzzfeed : We have no proof though
@uwezo3 @realDonaldTrump I haven‚Äôt heard about illegal Canadians... let alone murdering thousands of people. Have you?
@lissie_w @MikeKellyPA @realDonaldTrump @lissie_w Care to explain?
@MarkDice @facebook Everyone go to https://t.co/l59Qc10YAR and sign up. 	@getongab is like Twitter &amp; Facebook, but actually DOESN‚ÄôT censor people!
@znvalentine @DHammarberg @MarkDice @facebook Oh god, with the way things are going in this country, I sure wouldn‚Äôt want to be locked up for my free speech.
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/iWNSBS8aOC
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi I got this data from here: https://t.co/WKHDNlFO5H
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi If a cop feels threatened by someone making believe to pull out a gun, they would shoot for self defense, NOT because of their skin color.
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi 25% of all police victims are black. Here is that data: https://t.co/MINGzh8tgw
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi Just to give you a comparison, blacks make up about 12% of the US population. A LOT more whites are being killed by cops than black people.
@lissie_w @SpeakerPelosi Okay. Out of ALL murders in the US, 52.6% were African Americans. 54.5% of ALL robberies in the US were committed by African Americans...
@johnpalmay @realDonaldTrump Trump's claim of 93 percent support refers only to his support among loyal Republicans.
@antonnewcombe @realDonaldTrump He isn‚Äôt worried. He doesn‚Äôt want his final two years of his term wasted on impeachment trials when we can continue to keep America great again.
@MarkDice What source?? If so that will be so funny.
@BoldCrumbs @WORLDSTAR Well I ordered over three weeks ago and I still haven‚Äôt got our simple order.
@karblemarbles @realDonaldTrump Hillary had collusion with Russia, NOT Trump.
@WutsTucci Now talk about Bob Menendez!

@BBSlayers What about the time they blacked out on Danielle to tell her she was doing it wrong??
@corrineburnsfab I love this so much! Except Morgan did cry one time to her sister about being the only have not at the beginning.
@wizard101_fan1 It is very suspicious, and    production probably told her the right answers for all we know
@wizard101_fan1 It really is. Not to mention the CP and nominee votes, but production blacked out on Danielle and told her wrong way
#BB18 YES NICOLE I AM SCREAMING AND CRYING NOW THAT YOU WON!!!! LOVE YOU!!
