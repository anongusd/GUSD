TO DEMOCRATS ...For every million dollars raised by your campaign,there will	be a million Patriots out to see to it you lose the elections.
We seek, by protesting, to let R reps know that we R not in favor of these crippling expenditures & we R labeled un-American, "racist" "mob"
OBAMA Americans heard you say that you intended to visit all 57 states.	We all know that Islam not America has 57 states.	YES, "We noticed."
Again-... Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. 	Depression is when you lose your job.	Recovery is when Obama loses his job.

Welcome to the new capitalism. Where politicians rule, irresponsible behavior is rewarded, and theft is legal.
The Next American Revolution is now upon us.You have one last,	desperate chance to turn this nation back from the brink of	annihilation VOTE
"If ye love wealth better than liberty,Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you,may posterity forget that ye	were our countrymen!"
You've ignored your Oaths, you've ignored not only the founding	documents, but even principles upon which those	documents are founded.
You,the	corrupt and dishonorable denizens of both political parties, have	inflamed the masses beyond forbearance.You insult them continually
In America whatever the political party or ideology there are certain	lines in the sand that Shall. Not. Be. Crossed  www.patriotfreedom.org
I think the political class in America has over-reached	and has grossly under-estimated the American people
If you do expect perfect submission to political authority in America, you prove that you know nothing of the Spirit that is America,
The American people have awakened, and they want their country back

If a conservative doesn’t like guns, he doesn`t buy one.	    * If a liberal doesn't like guns, he feels that no one should have one.
War is an ugly thing  BUT The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse
If a conservative is a vegetarian, he doesn`t eat meat.	    * If a liberal is, he wants to ban all meat products for everyone.
If a conservative is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation.	    * A liberal wonders who is going to take care of him.
If a conservative doesn’t like a talk show host, he switches channels.	    * Liberals demand that those they don’t like be shut down.
If a conservative is a non-believer, he doesn’t go to church.	     A liberal non-believer wants any mention of God or religion silenced.

What do Obama and God have in common? Neither has a birth certificate. How do they differ? God does not think he's Obama.
"On a more serious front, I sincerely hope that when the president goes in for his annual check-up,doctors at Bethesda will do a brain scan.
Of the 56 signers: 17 lost their fortunes,12 had their homes destroyed,9 fought & died,5 were arrested as traitors,& 2 lost sons in the War
REMEMBER- Never interrupt an enemy when he is making a mistake- Napoleon LET THE DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS HANG THEMSELVES NEXT VOTING CYCLE
Confuse a Liberal! use logic and facts
I will say this one again -People must repudiate the one-headed, two party system,& learn 2 think for themselves see www.patriotfreedom.org
Obama administration upset at torturing terrorists,however its ok to accept abortion and euthanasia .To me that's psychotic any way you look
DEMOCRATS STILL STANDING WITH THE 2,074 PAGE HEALTH DOCUMENT THAT WILL HELP DESTROY THE 17 PAGE DOCUMENT THAT SUPPORTS OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY
From Audacity of Hope: 'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.' Obama-from his book AUDACITY
We need STATESMEN, NOT Lawyers, PATRIOTS, Not Politicians, Men & Woman who know the code of right & wrong within them. PATRIOT FREEDOM
The Declaration of Independence is our Nation's birth certificate and our Constitutions cornerstone  WHERE IS OBAMAS
How do you tell a Communist Well, it's one who reads Marx&Lenin how do U tell anti-Communist It's someone who understands Marx Lenin. Reagan
Why did the founders of R nation give us the Bill of Rights? Answer is easy They knew Congress could not be trusted with R God-given rights
Remember PATRIOTS,the spirit that built the United States IS STILL ALIVE & KICKING. look at the web sites,blogs,tea parties,scared democrats
AGAIN- For the love of God, there are people in comas that are more aware of world affairs than OBAMA!!!!!!!!!!
"The status quo simply is not where America is." --Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid This guy is an a-1 walking Tyrant turncoat
Dont despair-Consider the odds Washington faced in the winter of 1776,when the fate of the patriot cause hung by a thread."R cause is just"
We cannot do everything at once,but we can do something at once Become part of uniting our voices at www.patriotfreedom.org Country needs U
"Let Wall Street have a nightmare and the whole country has to help get them back in bed again."
Human beings are endowed with our rights by our Creator. Our Founders recognized that principle.Barack Obama believes R rights come from him
Study Founding Fathers And the Constitution and Declaration of Independence Know where and what to say to those deliberately usurping them
100 Senators, 435 Congressmen, 1 President, and 9 Supreme Court justices responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.
Those 545 people, and they alone, are responsible. They, and they alone, have the power. They, and they alone, should be held accountable
When you fully grasp the truth that 545 people exercise the power of theFed Gov. it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist.
By the way, NEVER BACK DOWN or THEY WIN.. fear= False Evidence Appearing Real....know the facts and they cant deceive you
OBAMA WONT LISTEN,So for me “To argue with a person who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to the dead”.

Few spectacles so clearly show the politicization of life...silly award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama.

The vast bulk of the decisions that affect people's lives are made by administrative agencies, which are nominally executive actors.

Every grant of power is a grant to a specific institution of the federal government.

"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are natural rights "endowed by our Creator," not government
John Adams wrote, "A Constitution of Government once changed from Freedom, can never be restored. Liberty, once lost, is lost forever."

LAWS-Their meaning is not to be sought for in metaphysical subtleties which may make anything mean everything or nothing at pleasure.” TOM J
“Laws are made for men of ordinary understanding and should, therefore, be construed by the ordinary rules of common sense. Jefferson
Current circumstances, it would seem our reason must be checked in order to follow the un-Constitutional orders of an ineligible government.
"We are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” Jefferson
Very few of these czars have been confirmed by the United States Senate despite the Constitution’s requirements for Senate confirmation.
