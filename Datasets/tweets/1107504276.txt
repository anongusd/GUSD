@SenGillibrand Be a true States person and negotiate a deal with the Republicans to open up the Government. Prove you are worthy to be President
@SenGillibrand Why did you Support Kathleen Rice, who supported a bill that threatened to eviscerate the Americans With Disabilities Act?
@SenGillibrand I am a Democrat. Why did you run for the Senate, knowing you wanted to be President?
@SenGillibrand Words are cheap. Prove your statesmanship and negotiate opening of Federal Government.

@RepScottPeters Let him give us real facts. Respond to my question please.
@RepScottPeters How many alleged extortion demands have occurred in your district in the past five years under the ADA? Specifically, please answer.
@NYCBarPolicy @ICEgov That is great!! Do you support access to your facility and restrooms as well as the Courts‚Äô to people with disabilities?
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor Jim, Take a few Republican senators to breakfast, lunch or dinner and don‚Äôt let them go to bed to the bathroom If you need help raising the funds to do this, contact me and I will help, gladly
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor That‚Äôs what this bill represents
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor Take a Senator our for a meal; wine and dine the Senator and then tell him the bathroom is not available and he cannot get to a restroom for three hours
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor Still fighting the city for proper curb cuts, still do not have equal access to public transportation and can never assume public accommodations comply with the law
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor Almost 28 years after the Americans with disabilities act was enacted we still do not have compliance with the law in New York City.
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor All that the disabled want Is the right that everyone else seems to have is full access to the world
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor Those who voted for this are totally disingenuous. Anyone who is familiar with Litigation knows that a lawyer always tries to get a matter resolved before going to court and this bill is ludicrous
@JimLangevin @HouseFloor We are 4th class citizens. Everyone is before us, yet everyone forgets we do not discriminate against anyone.
@realDonaldTrump A President should not care about the Media or popularity polls, but he should care about doing the Best for the country.
@nysbapresident Oh, do not forget bar associations and law firms, even major names
@nysbapresident I hope it does not take as long as making courts accessible to people with disabilities. If yes, they will still be waiting forever, like us.
