There's no disagreement,we must address China‚Äôs predatory industrial policies, but our producers can‚Äôt be expected to bear the brunt of this trade war. We must find proactive trade deals that recognize the benefits of free &amp; open trade while penalizing bad actors that abuse it.
Farmers and ranchers are already facing decade low incomes. Now more than ever this Administration and Congress should be focused on opening new markets for U.S. products, rather than taking unilateral actions that cause more harm than good.

I will continue to work hard on behalf of all cooperatives to open access to new markets and expand trade opportunities. It is crucial that coops are allowed to move grain into new markets and deliver a profit to the farmers.
Met with the folks at the Pawnee County Coop. Cooperatives allow our farmers and ranchers¬†to access to the resources they need to keep their farms and ranches running. Coop members often work behind the scene but are no less important to keeping farming alive and well in Kansas.
I toured the @ONEOK facility in Bushton,Kansas. Employees shared the company's current expansion projects one being the construction of a new pipeline. These initiatives will bring investment dollars, more jobs to the district, and increase product delivery!

Please everyone be safe this New Years Eve! #HappyNewYear
Unemployment in Kansas is at an all time low. In Oct. 2016 unemployment in Kansas was at 4.3 percent, it is estimated that unemployment is now down to 3.5 percent. Wow! Still, we have 20,000 open jobs &amp; need to focus in on our skilled labor force.
It is truly an honor to serve the first district. I am proud of our accomplishments in 2017, but ready for an even better 2018! #HappyNewYear2018 https://t.co/m0Qxy2quwZ
