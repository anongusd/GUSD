Even though the bill allows expansion to the poverty line, a lot of the details of what Georgia will ask the Trump administration to approve are not specified. The Kemp administration plans to hire a consultant to develop options before a plan is submitted.
The bill would not let GA fully expand as directed by the Affordable Care Act, but there‚Äôs renewed movement by Republican-led states to provide Medicaid to people who can‚Äôt get subsidized private insurance. Some also still want Obamacare $ for covering fewer people (Georgia TBD)

Lots to keep an eye on here, including where groups get their $. @ProjectFairness, which bankrolled expansion ballot campaigns in other states, hasn‚Äôt committed to Florida but continues to examine 2020 targets.
Why a Florida effort is more complicated than other states: it‚Äôs super expensive; to get enacted, 60% of voters have to approve the initiative; and the GOP-controlled legislature could try to get a competing initiative on the ballot to block it.
Groups involved include SEIU, Florida Voices for Health, Indivisible, Organize Florida and others. Many of them declined to comment publicly about their work ‚Äì which so far has included holding events around the state to secure 100K signatures by the end of the month.
Obamacare supporters are quietly mounting an effort to get Medicaid expansion on the Florida ballot in 2020, in what is likely to be the biggest test to see if the controversial program takes root over the objections of GOP lawmakers. https://t.co/tobSjYjbp0

CMS move to only exempt members of federally-recognized tribes has larger implications for other states ‚Äì it could pave the way for states to require some American Indians to have a job in order to keep their Medicaid benefits.

This demonstrates potential limits of the Trump administration's authority to pare back ACA Medicaid expansion coverage even if they don't agree with it. Obama's HHS already told many red states that it did not believe so-called "partial" expansions of Medicaid were legal.
