To @IvankaTrump, I say thank you and #yougogirl! You are such an inspiration to so many.
the media and press won‚Äôt report on her accomplishments because she is the daughter or POTUS. But that doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt accomplishing a great things. She is...and it isn‚Äôt just her, but this admin has done a lot to advance and empower women.
The real story is that this is just one more thing that she has done to empower women and lift them up. She doesn‚Äôt seek the spotlight or accolades, but continues to work tirelessly for us.
Then today, the Women‚Äôs Global Development and prosperity Initiative was launched by @ivankatrump to empower 50 million women around the world.		Ivanka works tirelessly for women day in and day out.
o   In July 2017, President Trump appointed Sarah Huckabee Sanders as the White House Press Secretary.  She is the first mother‚Äîand only the third woman‚Äîto hold that position.
The Trump Administration marked the first time that women have served concurrently as the lead spokesperson for the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Justice Department, which, according to CNN, are ‚Äúthe most high-profile roles in an administration.‚Äù
o   President Trump‚Äôs selection of Gina Haspel as CIA Director marked the first time in history a woman had been appointed to the position.
The President has appointed women to 6 Cabinet-level positions, including Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Homeland Security, Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), &amp; Ambassador to the UN.
President Trump has called on Congress to pass a National paid family leave program for all new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents.		o   President Trump‚Äôs FY 2018 and FY 2019 budget proposals both included a National paid family leave program.
¬∑In October 2017, President Trump signed the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, which promotes women‚Äôs participation in conflict prevention and peace negotiations overseas.
In April 2017, President Trump signed H.J.Res. 43, which blocked an Obama-era regulation that restricted States‚Äô control over their Title X family planning funds and would have coerced them to give funds abortion providers.
In March 2017, President Trump signed H.J.Res. 57 and H.J.Res. 58, which stopped Obama-era regulations that would have forced local schools to comply with new Federal standards
o   H.R. 321 directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to encourage women and girls to pursue STEM educations and careers in the aerospace industry.
In Feb 2017, POTUS signed 2 bills that promote increased opportunities for women in business &amp; science, technology, engineering, &amp; mathematics (STEM) fields:		o   H.R. 255 authorized the National Science Foundation to enhance recruitment of &amp; support for women entrepreneurs.
President Trump helped launch the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.		o   This initiative supports women‚Äôs professional advancement and the establishment of woman-owned businesses.
The United States Agency for International Development has launched the ‚ÄúWomenConnect Challenge,‚Äù a global call for solutions to close the gender digital divide.
In 2017, the Small Business Administration lent approximately $128 million more than the prior year in capital to women-owned businesses.
Child Tax Credit: Ivanka was responsible for helping to DOUBLE the Child Tax Credit.		The #taxcutsandjobsact  increases the Child Tax Credit, including the refundable portion, and makes the credit available to more families, giving America‚Äôs moms and dads needed relief.
This admin established the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative #WeFi.		Championed by #Ivanka the United States, G-20 partners, &amp; World Bank established the #WeFi to support women entrepreneurs. This effort could leverage in excess of $1 billion to support Women.
The women‚Äôs unemployment rate is 3.6%, the lowest it has been in 65 years.		o   Since January 2017, 2,214,000 new jobs have been filled by women.		o   Since January 2017, 1,400,000 American women have joined the labor force.
We weren‚Äôt asked about POTUS, but about Ivanka.  But since he went there, let‚Äôs set the record straight.		First, as a woman, I can speak on authority and I completely disagree with him.		This administration has done more for women than most administrations.
Robert was so focused on his hatred of our President, that he couldn‚Äôt even talk about the great things Ivanka is doing in this administration. 		He claims this admin has set women back generations and I couldn‚Äôt even respond because he kept talking over me.
I joined @marthamaccallum tonight to discuss @IvankaTrump‚Äôs #WGDP initiative that aims to empower 50 Million women around the globe over the nxt 6 years. #empoweringwomen		When I tried to answer Martha‚Äôs question, I was interrupted repeatedly by a man who does not respect women. https://t.co/G2UQdv8HA5

The real reason the #womensmarch happened was bcuz all of those women in DC on Jan 21, 2017 had bought their airline tickets &amp; booked their hotels bcuz they thought they would be attending #HRC‚Äôs inauguration.		By the grace of God, Women across the US rose up &amp; rejected Hillary!
As a matter of fact, the only thing Donald Trump took from them was Hillary‚Äôs opportunity to be president.		The women on the left have benefited from @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs policies just like conservative women. 		But they will never admit it.
The #WomensMarch2019 claims to be for #womenempowerment but that‚Äôs only if you agree with them.		They are good at 3 things...	1. Having a nonstop temper tantrum because Hillary lost		2. Hating @realDonaldTrump 		3. Tearing down and attacking conservative women

Walls &amp; physical barriers are proven to significantly boost border security &amp; deter illegal immigration.		In each of four CBP sectors where physical barriers have been improved or expanded -- El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego -- illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90%.
Technology	o   $675 million to provide Non-Intrusive Inspection technology at U.S. Southwest Border Land Ports of Entry.		*Will allow CBP to deter and detect narcotics, weapons, and other materials that pose a threat to the United States.
Humanitarian Needs	o   $4.2 billion - support 52K detention beds to address recent surge in illegal immigration	o   $800 million - fund enhanced medical support, transportation, consumable supplies, &amp; addl temp facilities necessary 2 ensure well-being of those taken into custody
Law Enforcement Personnel	o   $571 million for 2,000 additional ICE personnel to enforce immigration laws, combat gang violence, &amp; stop drug smugglers and human traffickers.		o   $211 million to hire 750 additional Border Patrol agents in order to keep our borders safe &amp;  secure.
Immigration Judges	o   At least $563 million for 75 additional immigration judges and support staff to reduce the backlog of pending immigration cases.		*President Trump will work with Congress to facilitate an expansion of in-country processing of asylum claims.
Border Barrier	o   $5.7 Billion for construction of a steel barrier on the Southwest border to fund 234 miles of new physical barrier.		*Will fully fund the top 10 priorities in CBP‚Äôs Border Security Improvement Plan.
According to the White House, the following appropriations must be included in the package to ensure a secure border and enforce our immigration laws:
This standoff between Dems &amp; GOP is not just about a wall.		This is about national security. 		The President has made it clear ‚Äì he will not move forward unless there is funding for border security, including a barrier for the border, in a government funding package.
To the haters, you can hate our President &amp; the GOP all you want, but #opioids &amp; #humantraffickers don‚Äôt choose victims based upon party affiliation. 		You need to wake up b4 your family member or loved one is a victim. 		This impacts all Americans. Border state not required.
