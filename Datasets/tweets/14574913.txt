Duly noted @webbleyou. I'll bring that up at tonight's design meeting.
@saratara -- Have you been on the site recently? The homepage was re-designed and it now a lot more user-friendly. What's your user name?
New update on whereIstand: users can 'follow' public figures, contacts, other users and issues important to them
@webbleyou, the 'I' is capitalized in whereIstand to emphasize that it's fundamentally about the individual user expressing opinions.
@bmtrnavsky Did you ever end up registering your blog? If so, what's your user name? Mine's 'gethro'. Hope to see you on the site.
