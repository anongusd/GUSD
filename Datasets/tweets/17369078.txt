Ohlhausen says all the data and information we have now is a benefit, because people didn't always have this level of access to information, but on the other hand, we didn't have the same problems with access #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Richardson of @CenDemTech says a federal privacy law is needed ASAP; it's the only way we'll be able to really protect people's data and how it's used #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
The benefit of APIs is that there is accessibility now, @sarafischer says #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
RT @USTelecom: Thanks for a great convo on the data privacy landscape, use of APIs, and how we move forward w/ protections that keep the be‚Ä¶
Coffey says part of the problem for news is that publishers use Google for ads, and so we're all playing by someone else's rules and relying on someone else's data; that's a problem with the ecosystem we have currently #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@newsalliance's Coffey says news is trusted with data because we have a long-term relationship with our audience #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@sarafischer says news is good at explaining data use: "news is good at saying here's an ad in exchange for news and information" #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
The Link Is the Message: It‚Äôs Time to Reverse the Polarity of the Internet for News  https://t.co/0sEuDSNg3v
The notion that a single federal law will be enough to protect us across all manners of data use is possibly too ambitious, @johnverdi says #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@johnverdi says federal lawmakers need to look at the California law that passed when they think about how a national statute might work #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@sarafischer points out that when it comes to privacy legislation, it can be difficult for a company to adhere to a multitude of diverse state policies. This could explain why big players are now more willing to discuss a national policy #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
"We're moving toward an always-on society" Richardson says; it's no longer voluntary if we're connected, it's now without our control. We need to stop talking about what can we do and start focusing on what we expect from companies #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Advertising based on data collection is something that can really impact people's lives, based on what ads they see for, say, mortgage rates or education opportunities says @CenDemTech's Richardson #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
How does data collection &amp; privacy impact competition? @bakerbotts Ohlhausen says that those who can afford the costly regulatory requirements are benefited, while those without deep pockets are hurt #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@newsalliance's Coffey says that news publishers are often considered third-parties when it comes to data access because of how news is shared through web platforms, so news gets very little access to essential data in current ecosystem #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
"Data is a currency" says @sarafischer #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
"Transparency is key," says @NAI's LeDuc #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
LeDuc says that many consumers know they've opted in to share their data when they use these connected services/apps/devices, but they don't always realize that data will be used for advertising purposes #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum

RT @attdcforum: Danielle Coffey, SVP, Strategic Initiatives and Counsel, News Media Alliance @newsalliance discusses what API means for com‚Ä¶
Privacy policies need to be more in line with what consumers expect, @johnverdi says; people want connected devices, but don't want their data shared for reasons unrelated to the use and enhancement of the services provided by those devices #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
People are sharing more and more data through connected devices because they see value in the service being provided through those products; but that doesn't always mean people want to share all their data to get those services #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@johnverdi of @futureofprivacy says people want enhanced privacy protections, but they don't always know how to ask for them, as he learned after seeing responses to ballot initiatives for privacy in California #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@sarafischer says the average American household has ~13 internet-connected devices #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Richardson says people are sick of being asked for consent re: data sharing, and are tired of being asked "can we do this with your data?" They want fair treatment, and they want purpose limitations #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Michelle Richardson of @CenDemTech says media is doing a much better job of explaining how data is being used, so people are more informed, but they're still not taking action #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@sarafischer says there's not a lot of consumer demand -- at least via action -- for some of the protections we're trying to give them; people weren't calling their lawmakers after the Equifax incident, for example #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Ohlhausen says that consumers are sick of notifications and consent for data collection -- they largely ignore them -- so we need to find better ways to protect consumer data without burdening them with so much of this #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Maureen Ohlhausen of @bakerbotts notes that while there is no national data privacy act in the US, there are a number of sector-specific regulations that are designed to protect consumers. Question today is "Is that enough?" #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@NAI has a series of practices that they utilize to make sure they're only collecting data they need; anonymizing data is also helpful to allow advertisers to collect data without violating user privacy  #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
LeDuc of @NAI says that one of the benefits of APIs is the ability to target ads to users, which benefits companies, but also consumers who are now seeing more ads that are actually relevant to them #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
News publishers don't have the access to this data that the platforms, like Facebook and Google, have, which prevents content creators from having the same opportunities to know their audience, Coffey says #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
What does the use of APIs mean for competition and creating a healthy news environment? Danielle Coffey says that news audience is "through the roof," but that misuse of consumer data is what is keeping news publishers from benefiting #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
.@sarafischer notes that the US doesn't have a national privacy legislation #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Up next: @sarafischer will be hosting a panel with Danielle Coffey of @NewsAlliance, David LeDuc of @NAI, Maureen K. Ohlhausen of @bakerbotts , Michelle Richardson of @CenDemTech, John Verdi of @futureofprivacy #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
All APIs are not created equal; we need to do more thinking about when data can be collected and what purpose that serves, for companies and consumers #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
There are certainly companies that think about their customers' data privacy and are concerned, while others are not; a good way to think about API is through the #GDPR lens, so you're thinking about the implications for users #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
McClatchy buyouts could claim chain‚Äôs full-time Guantanamo reporter @carolrosenberg  https://t.co/8YMGCYt9Lz
APIs that don't share data are not necessarily maintaining your privacy for privacy's sake, but rather for convenience's sake #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
An example of this is Unroll (dot) me, which promised to help people unsubscribe from emails they no longer wanted, but then used that access to their inboxes to mine their email for data and sold it to other data brokers #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Many people are not aware that logging into an account via a third-party app gives that app access to all of your data. They assume data is being collected, but don't realize who/how many companies are accessing it #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Incognito mode doesn't really protect you from API tracking. Browser extensions instead are better at blocking APIs, but they also mean that some website features may not work because you're blocking the signal to the API #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
You can download the report about APIs and privacy here: https://t.co/1TFFy2nL3N #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
#APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum https://t.co/OcYCVMTjA1
"There is no escaping APIs," so the use of them requires much more scrutiny #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Companies are now service providers, data aggregators, profilers of users, and data brokers #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
APIs play a central role in tracking users online, from website to website, app to app, and website to app and back #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
APIs are essential for the integration of online services. At the same time, APIs can be used to collect lots of person data about you, and can be used by third-parties to gather even more about you without you realizing it #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
#APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum https://t.co/2X1xdJaeIA
External monetization of APIs can be found in things such as premium ad-free content options (like paying for Spotify to avoid ads), as well as on Amazon (which is free for shoppers but chargers sellers for using the platform) #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Monetization APIs help platforms generate and share revenue by tracking content usage, such as how YouTube shares revenue with content creators  #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Benefits of APIs: showing interesting products (targeted ads), and reducing costs while increasing conversion rates #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
APIs are popular because they can help generate revenue by telling companies who their audiences are and what they're doing #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Some sites don't have any public APIs, like Netflix, likely because they want to keep their content to themselves #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Similarly, if, during tax season, you connect your Venmo or bank account to your tax-filing account, they will have access to all the info in your account, in many instances #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Important to know re: unofficial APIs: if you use one to sign in to your account, it's given full access to your account. This does not happen with all APIs #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Tinder has unofficial APIs, such as tinderbot, which will automatically swipe right for you. These unofficial APIs can easily be discovered and cataloged -- and utilized -- by third parties. #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
An example of an API most of us encounter is when websites integrate Google Search into their sites to allow you to search their site through Google; if you're logged into Google at the time, then Google knows what you've searched for, as does the site you're on
Basically, @floschaub says, APIs are like when we address an envelope to send mail through the postal service -- we're giving them information to help them do what we're asking, which is send the letter #APIPrivacy #ATTPolicyForum @attdcforum
Not sure what an API is? @floschaub makes it simple: It's how two interconnected web services communicate with each other #APIPrivacy  #ATTPolicyForum  @attdcforum
