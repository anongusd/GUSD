@RightWingJewess @prokaski It was THE Broward County.  The plan included locked doors to the room where ballots arrived from the post office, and the ballots arrived in the public room already opened.  It was clearly a nefarious corrupt plan.
@RightWingJewess @prokaski I have taken advantage of early voting myself.  I have also seen how it allows for massive fraud.  I worked in Broward County in 2016 and discovered 150,000 mail in ballots had been opened in secret in violation of #FL law.  Here's part of that story:  https://t.co/WI5abEDUfO

@RightWingJewess @prokaski That is the point of loosening the rules.  So many things that "leaders" sell as "beneficial" are self-serving.  From motor voter to early voting to mail in voting the "reforms" all provide opportunities to mess with the integrity of the vote.

Thinking about elections. There should be a single day when citizens participate in an act of community, and if you can't vote that day, you should provide a reason.  Voting is a privilege of citizenship, it doesn't have to be "convenient".
Wondering how people get elected on platforms of 4th trimester abortions, sanctuary for criminal immigrants, open borders, confiscatory taxation and banning airplanes. Then it dawns, early voting, mail in voting and no voter ID. They have done away with elections.

@jjauthor The whole movement to early and mail in voting and opposition to voter ID provides the answer.  There is no way that there could possibly be a voting majority for sanctuary cities, 4th trimester abortions, abolishing ICE and open borders. The election machinery is compromised.

@ThyConsigliori @BreitbartNews We talked last night of the Wall's value, it's practical impact on employment, wages, respect for law and enforcement.  The impact as policy is far reaching. It's symbolic impact as a statement of respect for the country and our laws is of equal import.
@ThyConsigliori @BreitbartNews No I haven't Pat.  Our discussion last night may inspire that, but as you know I typically write about legally related matters.

@pppatticake Easy answer to that question: There is no evidence against him.  Without a date, time or place and with Dr. Ford's only "witnesses' denying her claims, there is not even probable cause to open a case.
Thinking aloud, the Senate rejects Judge #Kavanaugh on Saturday.  Nov. 6, Heitkamp, Manchin, Bill Nelson, McCaskill and Tester are tossed and Flake is gone  Republicans now control Senate 56-44. What does @POTUS do? He sends Kavanaugh back for the confirmation he deserves.
