@Stephallyn @Gladwell @RickRubin it made me want to go out and buy a convertible and just drive around 16 hours a day blasting this record (yeah, even in winter -- that's how good it is)
I listened to @Gladwell and @RickRubin Broken Record podcast about Tom Petty's album Wildflowers (highly recommended) and decided to listen to the record start to finish. Wow. What a record. I forgot what a coherent Rock Album sounded like.
Not all screen time is bad. Heavily using Screen Time controls, I set up an old iPhone for my son that only allows apps where he is creating, not consuming. Since then he's produced a growing library of stop-motion videos and it's awesome, using this app: https://t.co/b5NUjy13ju
5/ So thank you @NCDavidMenconi for giving a kid from down east the opportunity to work with a real rock-and-roll writer. And for everyone else, buy some of David's books so we can encourage him to write some more https://t.co/oTeHnMBGhP
4/ When I hear about newsrooms being trimmed, it makes me sad for friends like David and the state of journalism but also coverage of the arts &amp; music &amp; books &amp; everything beyond money &amp; power that makes life worth living. I'm glad I got to see some of the magical times then.
3/ We decided to collaborate on a music guide to the Triangle (since lost to history) that we called the "Tri-guide" or something like that. David provided content &amp; I did HTML. Pretty sure no one read it, but it was fun &amp; one of the experiences that got me excited about the web.
2/ when I joined the N&amp;O, I was a 21-year-old kid from Greenville who felt like a big shot just for living in Raleigh and working at the capital city paper I had been reading my whole life. I remember approaching @NCDavidMenconi and telling him I liked his writing.
1/ best wishes to my old friend @NCDavidMenconi, formerly the music critic of @newsobserver where I had my first job in '93 (!) David took a buyout so yesterday was his last day after 28 yrs. I was a fan of his work when I joined &amp; it was exciting to work with someone I admired.

@danielaperdomo @fredwilson It's a complex topic. I definitely rode that roller coaster myself. Also comes up in my coaching practice a fair amount.
@fredwilson Definitely true. That said, there's nearly always something to learn from the negative reviews. I think employees should be broadly encouraged to post reviews (makes sentiment more representative of reality), just not *positive* reviews specifically.

@samat I wanted everyone to be able to subscribe/unsubscribe. Bcc doesn’t allow that. Some providers also are more likely to mark as spam (as they should!) Everyone on my list has to double opt-in (sign up w/email and then click on a link in their email)
@twalling Thanks. I did look at tinyletter and can’t remember why i didn’t use it. Also forgot to mention that I had some prior experience with Mailchimp and another public newsletter using it. I’ll take another look! One of my points is that switching providers is very easy.

The interesting bit from the IDG story to me is that the company was set to be *majority-owned* by employees via the ESOP over time. I know that most/all tech cos. have options, RSUs, etc so there is employee ownership but don’t know of others with majority ownership as goal.
Any other ESOP stories/data out there? That one’s from 1995!
I worked for a company (IDG) that was private and had an ESOP to transfer ownership to employees over time. “Under a profit sharing program, IDG annually gives its 7,200 employees stock equal to 10% to 15% of salaries, diluting the chairman's stake.” https://t.co/NF0qJ7u19T
...not that ESOP in particular is mutually exclusive with being VC-backed or bootstrapped.
Most of the twitter chatter I read is about bootstrapping vs taking VC money. I’d love to hear more about what people are doing with other ownership models like ESOPs and co-ops. Interesting data in this piece.       https://t.co/6cR5nb5IBs

@wilreynolds Thanks for sharing those experiences. I was definitely aware of my white privilege throughout but deep down knew that as a native white Southerner, I could "pass" when needed. Still had some discomfort. My son is Korean &amp; we definitely got a few stare-downs from that difference.
A few observations from driving vs. flying: the concept of "flyover country" doesn't exist and this is good -- just one big sea of "us" on this huge land mass. Everything changes gradually, mile by mile. More diverse group of people than you experience flying. Albums &gt; songs.

14/ Once you’re a certified foster parent, you’re not obligated to say “yes.” You can be certified and never take in a foster child if circumstances aren’t right. But you’re ready to help when called. And it’s help that is desperately needed where you live today. /end
13/ I’m not certified yet but I’m 95% there. There will be a morning or afternoon when a call comes in and my family will have to make a choice to say “yes” or “no” to bringing a kid into our home in a matter hours, for an indefinite period.
12/ In some cases, foster parents adopt their foster children but usually only after reunification becomes untenable for some reason and birth parents legally terminate their parental rights.
11/ The goal of most foster child cases is to reunite the child with their families. To achieve that, the foster parent works w/ the agency to make sure the child has appropriate and positive contact with their birth family through visits, typically at the agency.
10/ Your home becomes their refuge and you become the child’s full-time parent immediately. You take them to school, make sure they are fed and clothed, offer appropriate guidance and discipline, and give them your full love and support.
9/ In training we learned that foster kids can show up with a single plastic grocery bag of their belongings. Some go to school in the morning thinking they are going home that night only to be taken from school to your home by the authorities.
8/ Being a foster parent forces you to grapple with issues of grief, race, gender identity, incarceration, poverty, privilege, ethnicity, abuse, mental illness, and addiction. Sometimes all at once.
7/ Foster programs are run on a state-by-state basis. My experience is all based on New York but if you Google “how to become a foster parent in [your state]” there is lots of information available online.
6/ You have to get fingerprinted for criminal background check, yr home is inspected, provide financial info, get written character references &amp; provide personal details to a social worker along w/ your views on religion, discipline, values, &amp; other deeply personal topics.
5/ The process of becoming a foster parent takes months of time and effort. These are the base requirements in New York, which includes 30 hours of training (I just completed this over the last five Saturdays)		https://t.co/oB5U0TzqaV
4/ Being a foster parent is a *huge* commitment not to be taken lightly. It’s not a decision to be made in a knee-jerk emotional way. By definition, the children needing care are in a very tough situation.
3/ On any given day, there are nearly 428,000 children in foster care in the United States. Kids need stable homes every single day in every community. Median age is 7.8 years. More data: https://t.co/RkVyEDVZf1
2/ The immediate need for Spanish-speaking foster parents in NYC right now inspired this thread: https://t.co/qpCB9ibdNx

4/ The play already received rave reviews in its London run. If you’d like to support this ambitious and important production, buy tickets on July 25 or reach out to me if you’d like to offer more significant financial support. DMs are open.
3/ “The cast’s diverse background means that the production will have to go to extra lengths to get its performers to New York, in part because of travel bans instituted by the Trump administration.”
2/ “the cast will include actors from Afghanistan, Lebanon, Morocco, Sudan and Syria; several former refugees from the Calais Jungle will perform, including the drummer and singer Mohamed Sarrar.”
1/ This is an incredibly timely and important production from @stannswarehouse (where i am on the board). Art can play an important role in driving social change by inspiring us and giving us the strength to act in difficult times. https://t.co/dLrGf4ltqE

@BlairReeves All Greenville this trip
11/ So when I fly into that little Pitt-Greenville airport in NC this afternoon, it’ll be cooler than all the times I’ve flown into London or Paris — the first time I’ve seen the place I was born from the air. And I’m flying in from NEW YORK CITY. Hot damn, kid! /end
10/ To those kids: I see you (and a life hint from someone who was like you - no one knows what they are doing in NYC, SF, Paris, London, or anywhere. Don't be fooled or intimidated.)
9/ I try to never be the jaded business traveler. I don’t scoff at the first-time travelers who may not “know what they’re doing.” That was me, a kid who wanted to go places but didn’t know much of anything about getting there.
8/ My life has been a dream in so many ways. Worked with incredible people, built an amazing career in SF/NYC, rung the bell at NASDAQ, had a real working meeting with a US President, testified in Congress, built a beautiful life and loving family in NYC. I've been really lucky.
7/ Flying became normal for me and I’ve flown well over a million miles since then. But I think about the privilege of getting on a plane every single time. Every. Single. Time. It’s a privilege.
6/ 2nd flight in my life was first biz trip at age 23 (1995). Tried to be a nonchalant “experienced biz traveler.” Gee whiz inside / cool outside. Had expensive company laptop with me. Left it in trunk of taxi. Cool traveler cover blown. Terrifying. (Got it back - whew)
5/ I went “away” for school to Duke (100 miles away). Majored in English w/ focus on Shakespeare. Graduated with honors. But the only air travel was in my mind. Didn’t have the $$ to fly anywhere. (Duke was expensive!)
4/ That grandfather was an illiterate farmer. I read his birthday cards to him at 5 bc he couldn’t read them. Not being able to read made his world very small which really shaped how I think about the world. My whole family lived in about 100-mile radius. 100 miles was “far.”
3/ My first flight ever was when I was 18. I found myself in Texas on an ill-advised summer road trip (oh, New Orleans!) My maternal grandfather died while I was on the road, so I flew back to Raleigh for the funeral. I remember marveling from above at baseball diamonds lit up
2/ If you think everyone flies, think again. Majority of Americans don’t fly in any given 12-month period and an additional ~25% fly once or twice a year.	https://t.co/FE3rosxsSt
1/ Today, I’m flying in to the airport in my hometown of Greenville, NC for the first time in my life. I’m 45 and was born there, went to K-12, left when I was 18. It got me thinking about life and the insane privilege of air travel.

The fact that gun stocks are up today is a crystal-clear demonstration that focusing only on "shareholder value" in business is morally bankrupt.

9/ Two kids. daughter went to top school in NYC and learned four languages; son is serving the country in the Navy in an elite unit
8/ fast forward 17 years and he said he has “made it.” Green card. Great job, beautiful home, happy family. Justifiably proud.
7/ he also got a night shift job to make ends meet, sleeping just a few hours a day. And he worked and saved.
6/ he got up and found a job the next day for low pay, carrying heavy cast iron pipes up 16 flights via fire escape (elevator was broken)
5/ Had no mattress for his new room so he found one on the street and slept on it until he could buy one.
4/ Landed at JFK, got an apartment, had $0 in his pocket after initial rent &amp; deposit.
3/ came to NYC in 2000 w/ $800 in his pocket. Knew almost no English and only one person from his hometown.
2/ today, a man who came here from Ukraine was at my apartment doing some work &amp; he told me his life story
1/ We tend to talk about “immigration” in abstract political terms. One of the blessings of NYC is I interact with immigrants regularly.

12/They say that as a parent you see world through yr child’s eyes. I’m grateful that my son helped me see it so much more simply &amp; clearly.
11/ It’s about a little boy who wants to have a cooking show or a girl who sees Wonder Woman &amp; sees herself as strong and powerful.
10/ It pains me that discussions about identity become so politicized when they should be humanized.This is not “identity politics” or “PC"
9/ After this, we talked about how *he* could be that guy. It seemed immediately more real, like he could do it. Representation matters!
8/ My son always talks about doing his own cooking show. He saw a version of himself on TV, a chef who looked like him. His eyes twinkled.
7/ We were watching a cooking show this weekend &amp; an Asian chef appeared. My son flashed a huge smile and said: “He’s Korean — like ME!”
6/ We watch TV together, in particular cooking shows.
5/ Illuminating bc I'm learning abt race on a visceral level. Heartbreaking bc for the 1st time, I've begun to understand impact of race.
4/ It’s both heartbreaking &amp; illuminating.
3/ My amazing 5yo son (who is adopted) is Korean-American. At 5, he’s starting to understand &amp; verbalize that he’s Korean &amp; we're white.
2/ I always understood the importance of representation in an intellectual way. But I really felt it deep in my heart this time.
