@thehill Pretty dangerous thing to say‚ÄîCohen taped people.
@RepThomasMassie @KennedyNation You already knew about all those crimes trump committed? 		Why haven‚Äôt you done anything about it yet?
@DerekCressman It‚Äôs remarkable. He sat there and watched cohen‚Äôs life come down in ruins, heard cohen‚Äôs warnings, and proceeded full steam ahead defending the criminal president. #enabler
@PhillipJ1975 @NBCNews @MariannaNBCNews It will be. Lying to Congress is a crime.
@MarkMazzettiNYT @maggieNYT @nytmike @adamgoldmanNYT @anniekarni ...and yet, he continued to work for Mr. Trump. 		I hope everyone in this administration could picture themselves in #cohen‚Äôs seat yesterday.
@thehill @CongressmanHice @krystalball @BuckSexton @HillTVLive Accusing the president under oath of like 10 felonies, many occurring in office, and supporting the accusations with documentary evidence is a nothing burger to you?
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Glad you guys take ‚Äúprocess crimes‚Äù so seriously! Get him, gym!
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie You think Cohen came to congress yesterday voluntarily, and committed a crime by lying to congress, in order to avoid more indictments. 		Incredible.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Cohen voluntarily came to congress yesterday. He wasn‚Äôt forced to. 		So you‚Äôre saying, cohen voluntarily came to congress yesterday and then lied to avoid further indictments (risking more prison time)?  		Is that what you really believe? Quit enabling a criminal.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Incredible. 		Quit enabling criminals.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Huh? He openly described his criminal wrongdoings‚Äîand in doing so‚Äîhe lied to avoid more indictments?		Your argument would at least hint at making sense if he told the truth to avoid further indictments, but that wouldn‚Äôt help your support for trump, of course. 		You‚Äôre an enabler
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Obama did not commit a felony.  If he did, prove it (including saying what crime he committed). 		Trump committed many, a few of which were proven with documentary and testimonial evidence yesterday. Quit enabling a criminal.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie This is an incredible refusal to see what is plainly in front of your face, and why people think you trumpophiles are fringe. 		I know you don‚Äôt like it, but it isn‚Äôt fake news. Quit enabling a criminal.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie And weakens case that it was election related? It happened a decade before the election and the payments occurred October 2016.  Want to explain that one away with some mental gymnastics?
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie This is like talking to a three year old. Obama was not at yesterday‚Äôs hearing, and had nothing to do with it. Neither was Hillary or bill or soros or bezos. Quit enabling a liar, a cheat, and a criminal.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie You‚Äôre on a sinking ship. Trump is a conman, liar, fraud, and criminal. It‚Äôs been proven, and more shows will continue to drop. Quit enabling him.
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie And Rudy guliani and Sean hanmity don‚Äôt count lol
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Oh ya, buying life rights is fine. But not when it is a hidden campaign expense. 		And who are these ‚Äúmany‚Äù legal professionals you speak of?  Provide a citation..jeez
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Yes. If he is using this testimony to help reduce his sentence, he has to tell the truth. If he lies, it will be way worse. So again, what is his motivation to lie? (Not just to come to congress and testify, what is the motivation to lie?)
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie And further, as to the accusations that don‚Äôt require his testimony (I.e. hush money payments that he provided trump‚Äôs signed receipts to):		what consequences should the president suffer for those felonies?
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just confused as to what exactly you are saying. Can you answer this question fully:		What motivation did Cohen have to voluntarily go to congress (no subpoena or threat of one) and lie yesterday?
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie He will lie because of what also? He had no reason to lie up there. 		And FYI:  Known liars are witnesses all the time‚Äîthey flip and tell the truth, or risk severe consequences if they continue to lie. I know because I‚Äôm a prosecutor.
@GOP No, he accused Donald trump of communicating with a campaign official who was in contact with Wikileaks. 		And this was in the hearing that was specifically NOT supposed to be about Russia. 		Republicans think that collusion is the only thing trump is being investigated for ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@RepBost Remind me, why is Gorsuch on the bench? Could he defeat the filibuster?
@colgraphics @jeroneanderson @onegarion @AngryWolfe @RepThomasMassie Exactly. Which is why it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to voluntarily come to congress and spew more lies and risk getting more prison time.

@TheEld2 @thehill I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to non-trump voters, which includes me. 		I guess my question is more, does she really have a base within the Democratic Party to make any impact in the primary? She didn‚Äôt come in with a huge following and thus far, her campaign has been awful.

@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi Enjoyed the chat; back to work for me.
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi Ya, so maybe incumbent on McConnell as leader of senate and pelosi. Nevertheless, there was a unanimously passed cr in the senate that trump refused b/c there was no ‚Äúwall‚Äù $. Ok, if that‚Äôs the case, then trump needs to tell us what a wall is.
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi Again, that‚Äôs where I would suggest that if the gop is going to refuse to reopen the government without a ‚Äúwall‚Äù, then have answers to these questions. Otherwise take the $ for border security and reopen the government.
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi I suppose, but to me it is seems incumbent on trump to put the plan forward since it his his political promise.  If he wants a wall, tell us exactly what it is, what it costs, and what it will do. The ‚Äúwall‚Äù has morphed into a million diff things that nobody knows what it even is
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi But for now, it is a political catchphrase that I can‚Äôt see as a legitimate justification to keep the government shut down over. Dems offered $$ for border security. He should take that deal.
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi If trump can actually put forth a plan with estimates and projects and a firm idea of what a ‚Äúwall‚Äù actually is (w/o the idea changing every 12 hours), and what it would do for border security, maybe dems would be interested in talking. 2/
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi Ya, I appreciate you giving your honest opinion, but I think my point is more that there is complete uncertainty on all of these questions, which seem critical to me before funding is allocated. 1/
@DespicableFool @cspan @NancyPelosi Does wall funding mean a wall, fence, steel slats, improvements to existing fence lines, or is it just a metaphor for border security? What areas of the border will it cover? What impact do non-partisan experts say it will have?
@JohnFugelsang I feel like the standards of the @gop have fallen so far, that the mere fact that @MittRomney is a legitimately nice guy is a pretty stark alternative to the current gop.

I simply don‚Äôt know if that is true or not‚Äîindeed, it may be true‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not taking Jordan at face value. Is there non partisan support for this theory?

@gary_mies @FoxNews @POTUS Well you made the assertion that Beto is paying the caravan. The burden is on you, my friend. Prove it with a non-partisan source.
@pogmothoin68 @FoxNews @POTUS They want to, but if they are met with  the marines before they can file an application for asylum, they need to get an injunction
@gary_mies @FoxNews @POTUS They are more than 1000 miles away. And Beto is not giving them his money. He legally donated to a charity that has nothing to do with a caravan. Sorry that bothers you.
@pogmothoin68 @FoxNews @POTUS And I never said they are allowed. They will go through a process to see if they are allowed under asylum laws. But You said they can‚Äôt sue‚ÄîI said they can. They have a right to legally seek asylum, which is what they are doing and they can sue for it if needed.
@pogmothoin68 @FoxNews @POTUS Because people seeking asylum have a legal interest in asylum. They have due process rights to seek it. You do know you don‚Äôt have to be a citizen to have standing right?
@gary_mies @FoxNews @POTUS They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre  asylum seekers legally asking for help.  Sad to see how the entire gop is unwilling to help because they think the country is being invaded.

@RepThomasMassie @RMConservative I mean, Supreme Court has ruled on this. It is settled. Legislation to the contrary would be illegal on its face.
@utvolfl @JBLILI2016 @FoxNews @AndrewCMcCarthy @IngrahamAngle Read the case I posted earlier (and read the actual case, not Fox News or info wars summarizing it). You might find it educational.

@utvolfl @JBLILI2016 @FoxNews @AndrewCMcCarthy @IngrahamAngle The writers of the 2nd amendment never meant to include today‚Äôs guns. EO can change that under your line of thought
@JBLILI2016 @utvolfl @FoxNews @AndrewCMcCarthy @IngrahamAngle There‚Äôs a Supreme Court case that has already resolved that issue.

@associatesguild @thehill What do you think happens when a person without legal status gets charged with a crime? Do they get off free because they aren‚Äôt subject to the jurisdiction of the US?		ü§î
@associatesguild @thehill Lol so you don‚Äôt really care about America. It‚Äôs really always just been about trump for you.  You are disingenuous. You are the problem.
@associatesguild @thehill That‚Äôs not all it says. You can do it!	#bornornaturalized
@associatesguild @thehill So you‚Äôve resorted to just saying inapt words now? You‚Äôre like a trump robot who fell in the water and short circuited.
@associatesguild @thehill I see trump has put you in an awkward position. Here is a reminder, from the 14th amendment:		Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.
@associatesguild @thehill The constitution needed to be fixed because of dreamers?		The president doesn‚Äôt get to decide that. If it is necessary to fix the constitution, it can be amended. There is a process for that and it involves more than trump signing a piece of paper.
@associatesguild @thehill Or how about this question: is the constitution superior to presidential executive orders, in your view?
@associatesguild @thehill I‚Äôm talking about the first line of the 14th amendment, not your random vitriol about immigration. 		Do you not see trump‚Äôs proposed EO as inconsistent with the 14th? And how do?
@associatesguild @thehill What are you talking about?
@associatesguild @thehill Read the first line of the 14th amendment. There is nothing to revise. You‚Äôre either for trump or for the constitution on this one. Can‚Äôt have both.
@thehill Well I‚Äôm sure all you ‚Äúconstitutional conservatives‚Äù are just appalled that trump and his lackey graham are trying to circumvent the plain text of the constitution.

No.		Either (a) you didn‚Äôt actually go to law school or (b) you couldn‚Äôt find a job after law school so you drew up this half-baked plan in your basement.

@MuhPrivateCo @RWLSquad @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan No, it isn‚Äôt what I was talking about. 	You need to read...do you think the 13th amendment is going to help your little homemade law? https://t.co/QrXdgG4hQW
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan https://t.co/QqKnMvBi4X		This may help your redrafting effort. See section A.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan Glad you now understand your proposal‚Äôs shortfalls. 		Good luck redrafting.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan Your smaca idea would be dead on arrival, except it will never arrive to any serious forum because it is factually unconstitutional, as I explained to you and your other profile several times already. 		But people on 4chan will love it. Go rile up the base!
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan They can allow or not allow whatever they want on their platform. For the government to tell them otherwise is censorship. As for your inapt comparisons to mandating that businesses serve minorities, that took a constitutional amendment, just like this would.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan On the grounds that 1A protects speech of individuals against govt and a corporation, like it or not, is an individual per a lengthy line of jurisprudence. 		Speech includes the right to not say something. The govt can‚Äôt take that right per our constitution.
@MuhPrivateCo @RWLSquad @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan Let me ask you this: what legislator is on the record endorsing this so-called smaca proposal that you created?	 Post link please.
@MuhPrivateCo @RWLSquad @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan @4chan I don‚Äôt think you grasp free speech. 		It includes both saying things and the right to not say things. Twitter is free to say what it wants, and also free to not allow things that it doesn‚Äôt want on its platform. It would be different if this was a government site. It is not.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Idk, maybe because it is not the government. But I guess you could always rewrite the constitution to fit your politics. Need a medium to spew vitriol? @4chan is always there for you, but Twitter has its right to free speech too.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôve discussed this with your other account already. Thanks.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Solid analysis.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Yes, that is what we have been talking about.
@RWLSquad @MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Reread the first amendment, and maybe even take a look at the case law rather than shooting from the hip bc you agree with the politics. 		It‚Äôs not even a close call.
@MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Sure, Jan. Statutorily supplementing the first amendment‚Äîby restricting rights of corporations, which are viewed as individuals‚Äîsounds super legal. 		Go ahead‚Äîcall me a shill and a dolt and tell me about how you are a leading expert and lawyer. None of it makes you right.
@MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan Wrong, once again. But enjoy your website. The government cannot silence you no matter how ridiculous it is. Your web design skills are admirable.
@MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan By leading expert, you mean you bought a domain name ending in .us and created a fake seal on photoshop, written and vetted a proposal by yourself, and blasted it in 4chan and reddit?Good luck, but you‚Äôll need a constitutional amendment to make this constitutional. Get a job dude
@jax_joint @MuhPrivateCo @Jim_Jordan Ya he was spewing the same nonsense on another thread too, then claiming to be a constitutional lawyer while also calling everyone else names.
@MuhPrivateCo @jax_joint @Jim_Jordan This dude keeps running his mouth about some smaca bs, and links to a 2bit website. In short, he thinks freedom includes forcing private companies to include unwanted speech on its medium, and if you disagree, he‚Äôll call you a dolt or soviet.  		And he claims to be a lawyer! üòÇ
@stixie1234 @MuhPrivateCo @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan I think we‚Äôre in agreement, perhaps just saying it different ways.
@stixie1234 @MuhPrivateCo @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan I agree, but I think we‚Äôre getting lost between hate speech and inciting violence. 	Yes, hate speech is protected but subject to time place and manner restrictions. 	Courts can decide if speech invites violence, and that is not protected.
@MuhPrivateCo @stixie1234 @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan Do you feel like name calling strengthens your point?		You cited a proposal as an example of a law where congress can forbid private censorship. Are you a hack atty or still a law school student? 		Either way, if that is your idea of authority, you shouldn‚Äôt be charging clients.
@stixie1234 @MuhPrivateCo @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan Shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äîit‚Äôs how our government works.
@stixie1234 @MuhPrivateCo @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan I mean, speech meant to incite violence.
@stixie1234 @MuhPrivateCo @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan The courts decide if it‚Äôs hate speech.
@MuhPrivateCo @stixie1234 @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan Lol and this smaca bs you cite to is merely a legislative proposal, not a law that has been vetted by the courts. You‚Äôre lost dude. Congress can pass all the laws they want, but the law will be struck down if its unconstitutional, as smaca appears to be on its face.
@MuhPrivateCo @stixie1234 @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan So, since this entire thread related to 1A challenges, not some law congress may enact in the future, am I not obtuse anymore, kiddo?
@stixie1234 @bbuckley58 @Jim_Jordan Not if it is meant to incite violence. Regardless, google isn‚Äôt government or a utility. They can do what they want. It‚Äôs called freedom, and it applies to more than guns.

@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS I agree.  I‚Äôm not a fan of cnn or msnbc either. They both have agendas, as does fox. I think there is still good journalism in print media, and thus, I prefer to read major and local newspapers.
@MrBillCollier @terrinjosh35 @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS Ok, thanks for your input bill.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS I agree, party affiliation is not a reason to go after someone. Bad apples exist everywhere (I‚Äôve been called a fake veteran for supporting democrats). Hopefully you get judged by character and not party. Sorry if it hasn‚Äôt happened.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS Fox News perpetuates false narratives begun by Trump that lack evidentiary backing. No other news source, to my knowledge, is as quasi-state media as fox. That is scary when considering how many people it reaches.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS I don‚Äôt assume someone is racist until they demonstrate racist behavior. It happens to be, in my experience, many trump supporters turn out racist. But I wouldn‚Äôt presume it, just as I don‚Äôt presume you are racist.
@MrBillCollier @terrinjosh35 @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS He had a super majority. He didn‚Äôt try to take your rights. You may have thought that because of Fox News, but that is not the Democrats intent or plan. That‚Äôs propaganda.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS The first amendment has never ever been held to be an absolute right. There are time, place, and manner restrictions and always have been. And it only applies against govt. so what exactly was the 1st amendment violation you are referring to?
@CREWcrew What happened with the first one?
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS Why are you yelling? Calm down. I‚Äôm sorry you have been treated that way. In my experience, many people who voted for trump are racist. I don‚Äôt know you and don‚Äôt know anything about you. Hopefully you are judged by your character and not party affiliation.
@MrBillCollier @terrinjosh35 @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS You seem blind to the misdeeds of your own party.
@MrBillCollier @terrinjosh35 @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS Your rights survives 8 years under Obama, so I‚Äôm not sure what you are referring to. Nobody wants to take your rights. That‚Äôs trump propaganda.  Try turning off cable news.
@MrBillCollier @terrinjosh35 @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS I disagree.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS And to answer your question, the respect we by out the window with trump. His insults, name calling, and lack of decorum is disgraceful. Don‚Äôt make false equivalencies.
@terrinjosh35 @MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS That‚Äôs not it. The left stands for healthcare, job growth, human rights (ie, not putting kids in cages), civil rights, access to voting. Remind me, what does the right stand for other than white nationalism and enrichment of the wealthy?
@MrBillCollier @ShannonDEngland @marcorubio @POTUS Hitler was a nationalist. So was Mussolini. In fact, I can‚Äôt think of any good nationalist. Can you?

@FaithBarchyshyn @hellzfuryus @GOPLeader @BrianKolfage @facebook Because it seems like trump is just saying stuff to rile up his base before midterms rather than presenting evidence of something
@FaithBarchyshyn @hellzfuryus @GOPLeader @BrianKolfage @facebook My point is, if it is anything other than unabashed speculation about these people (fear mongering), why the uncertainty about ‚Äúunknown middle eastern‚Äù?

@FaithBarchyshyn @hellzfuryus @GOPLeader @BrianKolfage @facebook So faith, you seem reasonable enough to have a debate with. My question for you is, if these are ‚Äúunknown‚Äù middle eastern men, as trump claims, how do we know they are middle eastern or from isis? Wouldn‚Äôt that make them known?

@brend_man @FoxNews We're going in circles.  		Do you even believe your own arguments or are you just sticking your fingers in your ears and your tongue out?  		In any event, that's all the twitter for me for right now, have a lovely day.
@brend_man @FoxNews That.  Is.  Her.  Statement.  She signed it.  She acknowledged that the statement was hers.  Your "legal" arguments are extremely misguided.
@brend_man @FoxNews The rules used to be common-law rules, before they were codified in 1975.  This is 1L stuff buddy.
@brend_man @FoxNews I disagree both that you can't get an affidavit into evidence and that you understand the hearsay exceptions.Regardless, the affidavit is unnecessary: she will just testify to the substance of the affidavit.  	This is truly not a controversial argument.  It is black and white.
@brend_man @FoxNews First, Ford's statement is not about what she heard, it's about what she perceived.  That is not hearsay.  Second, yes there is an evidence code, whether you choose to believe it or not.
@brend_man @FoxNews Omg.  This is splitting hairs to no end.  From Wiki:  "First adopted in 1975, the Federal Rules of Evidence codify the evidence law that applies in United States federal courts."
@brend_man @FoxNews smh.  Yes, you can, if she deviates from a prior statement.  It's called an exception to the rule of hearsay.  There's a bunch of them.  But that's assuming she deviates.  She would likely just take the stand and say what is in the statement because she has first-hand knowledge.
@brend_man @FoxNews Again, elaborate on that rather than just name calling.  It is more persuasive when you elaborate.
@brend_man @FoxNews Oh boy.  Let's start with there is no evidence code: https://t.co/WuvawlhhX8.		Second, hearsay? No. Call her to the stand, have her testify to what is in the statement, and if she even slightly deviates, introduce the written statement as a prior inconsistent statement (Rule 613)
@brend_man @FoxNews HAHA! Please, do share with me your experience with the evidence code!	Or at least substantiate your claim:  What rule of evidence would keep the statements out (assuming of course that we are in a court room, which we are not)?
@brend_man @FoxNews Don't ignore the corroborating statements, multiple accusations, and weak (non)response from BK as part of my position.Also, don't forget the standard of proof I am employing is different than that in a crim. ct. where prison is the penalty. But I do think the evidence is damning
@brend_man @FoxNews Why do you keep resorting to the "I'm rubber and you're glue" defense? That is twice now.  Make an effort to understand the other side's position and maybe your frustration will dissipate.
@brend_man @FoxNews None of this is substantive.  You're just ranting now.
@brend_man @FoxNews Great, I agree.  More than what @ChuckGrassley is willing to do, as he wants to limit any evidence coming in to that of one of the accusers.  This will help @gop lackeys claim "there is no evidence!" when in reality they are simply ignoring evidence.  Much like #trumprussia
@brend_man @FoxNews And before you split hairs, I should have said, "thinly-veiled name calling is unnecessary."
@brend_man @FoxNews Name calling is unnecessary. You're confusing the standard to be convicted with that to be arrested,which is also different from that of being charged (which is akin to the standard to be convicted). But none of this matters vis-a-vis the hearings, which is not criminal in nature
@brend_man @FoxNews It actually is how it works.  Take for instance a statement made by @LindseyGrahamSC, one of BK's biggest supporters:	https://t.co/BMf3j6ezzY
@brend_man @FoxNews I remind you that only in a criminal court, where jail is the penalty, is a person innocent until proven guilty.  Virtually everywhere else we use the preponderance of the evidence standard.  If BK is arrested, which he very well may, then he'll get his presumption.
@brend_man @FoxNews I'm a juror in the court of public opinion.  I've read the affidavit, listened to the accusations, heard the corroborating statements from people like BK's freshman roommate and Mark judge, heard BK's response, and the accusation appear to withstand scrutiny, to me.
@TopherSpiro @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/noBF7GMjkU

@LindseyGrahamSC You've devolved to the @TuckerCarlson theory.  You're now at the level of people like tucker, @seanhannity, and @alexjonesshows.
@brend_man @FoxNews But why the derogatory term for trump‚Äôs lover‚Äôs lawyer?
@brend_man @mitchellreports @MichaelAvenatti Prove that you wouldn‚Äôt want a rapist on the Court? I thought that was a given, but you‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt know you. I can‚Äôt prove your beliefs. 		I personally don‚Äôt want a rapist on the court.

@thehill When your politics are racist....you support trump.
@sherry50waldie @wvmtnma @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY But who am I kidding. You like trump more than the üá∫üá∏. Nothing is going to change that‚Äîbye.
@sherry50waldie @wvmtnma @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Just because Trump says something self-serving doesn‚Äôt make it true. And your party argued the exact opposite for 8 years. Also, do you not see the fallacy in your argument? We should be nice to putin bc he has nukes, but no prez has been tougher than trump? Wtf are you arguing?
@sherry50waldie @wvmtnma @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY What does cnn have to do with anything we are talking about? You keep mentioning cnn, but I haven‚Äôt brought that up and we are on a Fox News website. Cnn has nothing to do with our conversation. Why do you keep mentioning it?
@sherry50waldie @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY We all watched it sherry.
@wvmtnma @sherry50waldie @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Yes. Adopting the position of Putin‚Äîour attacker‚Äîover those of our own intelligence agencies on a global platform is betrayal. Call my cynical, but the double negative walk back excuse is not believable.
@sherry50waldie @foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY But the betrayal doesn‚Äôt drive you crazy? This is getting absurd.
@cathymcmorris @SpeakerRyan This would‚Äôve been a middle of the road qtr under obama. You may not know that because he didn‚Äôt sit around and brag about it.

@clarence_bowe @GardeniaCoast @AmbSamBrownback @FoxNews If you weren‚Äôt there, and there are numerous people coming forward, do you think they are all conspiring to get Jim Jordan, despite saying that they still like Jordan?  Seems like the more plausible answer is that Jordan covered up sexual abuse. Sorry if it‚Äôs inconvenient.
@_nickdenny3 @FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Or could it be that there is no good reason to impeach?  Maybe...just maybe...@RepMarkMeadows and @Jim_Jordan aren't honest brokers
@thehill The same @Jim_Jordan who ignores sexual abuse?
@ScottyinCA @FoxNews @Jim_Jordan Rosenstein was a trump appointee.
@Athletics @Athletics remember like 3 hours ago??!!
@Athletics I feel like you can‚Äôt have ‚Äúa‚Äù hero when you come back from a 10-2 deficit in the 9th. Pretty much the entire roster has to be heroic.
@SteveScalise The fix is to drop the racism, sexism, and classism from the @gop platform.
@IResistAsWell @jaketapper @SenBobCorker I‚Äôll go with publicity stunt until he shows action with votes.
@thehill https://t.co/tjnqtA24wG
@thehill Which is notable because trump is notorious for using an unsecured cel phone.
@souther53857261 @FoxNews @seanhannity Totally fake!
@dkol87 @FoxNews @SenBobCorker Ooook. I guess I‚Äôm a skeptic for needing a little more than a ‚Äúbelieve me‚Äù from a pathological liar.
@2604FILL @FoxNews @SenBobCorker @POTUS Which is not unreasonable in light of trump‚Äôs conduct in office.
@Lindah77777 @FoxNews @SenBobCorker Quite the opposite. He is voicing dissent to welfare for farmers based on necessary tax hike. That is quite a conservative principle.
@dkol87 @FoxNews @SenBobCorker Same people paying for trump‚Äôs unnecessary tariffs: us.
@archiebs @FoxNews @SenBobCorker Do you support welfare for farmers?
@plerr6 @FoxNews @SenBobCorker But involuntarily putting farmers on welfare isn‚Äôt annoying? It‚Äôs cool if you‚Äôre into socialism, but seems like a waste to pay for unnecessary tariffs with taxpayer money.
@souther53857261 @FoxNews @seanhannity I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt get Fox News.
@FoxNews @seanhannity SPOILER: a bunch of conservatives sit around and pretend to be victims for the public‚Äôs response to their behavior.
@RepMikeRogersAL @realDonaldTrump FYI farmers of Alabama: you are being put on welfare. Don‚Äôt like it? Vote for someone else.
@RepMikeRogersAL @realDonaldTrump Wait are you saying trump promised to impose tariffs and give farmers payin for those tariffs welfare?
@jerialknight @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse I think that‚Äôs the case in a lot of the instances, but the master has deemed some of the docs privileged. Regardless, this idea that atty-client priv is dead is asinine. It‚Äôs just another weak attempt by trumpists to play the victim card.
@thehill Can we pin Giuliani to this statement‚Äîi.e., next week when Trump admits he was talking about paying cash, that means Trump is an idiot?
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse It‚Äôs being upheld by the special-master. Are you not reading anything being reported?
@RepJeffDuncan This is just rich coming from the @gop.
@SpeakerRyan So why don‚Äôt you do something about trump then?
@FoxNews @kevincorke And here‚Äôs why the @gop has no credibility.
@FoxNews He did the ‚Äúlock her up chant.‚Äù  That‚Äôs what he did. In no way did he effectively convey an important message. He pandered to a mob. Good work AG.
@politico Kinda like the North Korea one? ‚ÄúNegotiate‚Äù like a child and come out embarrassed.
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight Haha yes he influenced the election, although I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôll agree on who he helped. :)		As for Russians, the jury is still out on that. I‚Äôll wait for invstgtn to conclude. It seems to me like it was a massive attack that I would struggle to say had no effect on the outcome.
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight I do stand corrected‚Äîpence used a private email account containing sensitive info rather than a private server (I believe ivanka and Jared had the server tho), but I think my point remains in tact.
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight And the investigations into her have concluded, along with the ig investigation into the investigation
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight I hate to do the ‚Äúwhat about‚Äù game, but if it was a principle, isn‚Äôt the use of private servers by pence, ivanka, and kushner equally wrong? Or the lying on the sf86 forms? I do see attacks on Hrc as personal, and that is ok if theres a crime, but nobody has proven a crime
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight But just going out on a limb, I think her name is more useful as a boogeyman to rally conservatives. She is irrelevant sue. Nobody has turned up any pc against her and the investigations have concluded. Get over it.
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight Idk, I follow a lot of news outlets and while she has made a few public appearances, generally her appearance in the news is by Fox News. Regardless, who cares?prosecute her all you want if there is actually a case; I support justice. I just don‚Äôt see a case against her.
@thehill So trumps tantrum raised the price of numerous goods unnecessarily, causing losses to the producers of those goods, and he‚Äôs forcing taxpayers to cover those losses? Is that right? Isn‚Äôt that the definition of a #rino?
@SueCFlorida @GOPoversight Wow. Why are people so obsessed with Hillary? She‚Äôs a private citizen. If there is pc that she committed a crime, surely the gop led doj will prosecute. But every investigation and investigation into investigations concludes there was nothing. Move on?
@Jim_Jordan  https://t.co/CCF0DFCIeD
@SenToddYoung Merrick garland bro. It doesn‚Äôt matter who it is, we will oppose you for stealing a seat.
@thehill So when Paul qualifies his statement that he is ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù undecided, should we distinguish that from times where he doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù?
@politico I was under the impression that security clearances were obsolete with this administration.
@FoxNews Fox is obsessed with her

@DavidCayJ @GOP @marthamaccallum @FoxNews This idea that there is no bias or no goal in an investigation to prove a charge and we‚Äôll just ‚Äúfollow the facts‚Äù is a fiction.  The question is whether the investigator did something nefarious in trying to reach that outcome, not whether they had a goal.

@Mothyballs @Hashstros @FoxNews @guypbenson @AmericaNewsroom @GOP @SenMikeLee I can agree with you in large part. Like I said from the outset, I just wish our leadership would protect us from hostile foreign powers. Surely, that is not controversial is it?
@Mothyballs @Hashstros @FoxNews @guypbenson @AmericaNewsroom @GOP So you think the sanctions already in place were sufficient‚Äîso that is a different from @SenMikeLee‚Äôs position. Regardless, that is a position in the extreme minority, but one that trump holds as well. That is worrisome to me given trump‚Äôs significant personal interests in Russia
@Mothyballs @Hashstros @FoxNews @guypbenson @AmericaNewsroom @GOP Not trying to be a grammar nazi. I just have no idea what you are trying to say, or what the significance of that link is to the argument you are trying to make.

@Mothyballs @Hashstros @FoxNews @guypbenson @AmericaNewsroom I like to sanction countries that attack us so as to protect our autonomy and freedom. Apparently that is too much to ask for from @gop leadership.
@Mothyballs @Hashstros @FoxNews @guypbenson @AmericaNewsroom It seems like republicans do. They love Russia.

@Lightwielder70 @SenTedCruz @tedcruz Ive already answered yours. Remind me then, if you have answered, we‚Äôre you a yes or a no? I heard a life story of yours, but didn‚Äôt understand your answer.
@Lightwielder70 @SenTedCruz @tedcruz But you did not answer my question. You rambled. Yes or no?
@Lightwielder70 @SenTedCruz @tedcruz 1) I would hope a clean bill would pass both chambers forbidding separating families. 	2) regardless, I think your q misses the mark bc a legislative solution is not necessary: this is an executive policy that trump can unilaterally fix (both sides agree on that)
@brushbackbob @The1TrueCraig @jen_andreae @godzilla8ny @JakeSherman @ddale8 K. Your silence is pretty astounding. It seems quite hopeless for two sides to come together when we can‚Äôt even agree on something as basic as this.

@Lightwielder70 @SenTedCruz @tedcruz Or trump could just fix the policy he started himself. Surely you agree that separating asylum seeking families is i humane?
@SenTedCruz This isn‚Äôt a legislative issue. It‚Äôs a an executive policy that needs to be fixed by trump. Sorry, but nobody trusts the @gop congress to do the right thing.
@MarcTheTrumpFan @FoxNews @POTUS Seems like you don‚Äôt understand how our government functions.

@ShaunKing @NFL I do think he could be a serviceable backup in the league, and he should be. But I don‚Äôt know about much more than that. He was benched as a starter before the protest began. His play was steadily getting worse from a strong first two years.
@ShaunKing @NFL Does anyone know what he was asking for in contract negotiations? For example, he talked w/ sea, and they came out of negotiations saying, ‚Äúwe already have a starter.‚Äù  I find it hard to draw conclusions without knowing what his contract demands were.

@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews  https://t.co/B5uh3iueeH
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Right.  Good talk.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews I don't think you do get it.  I'm not broadening anything, in fact, I didn't even create this definition.  This is half(!) of https://t.co/XkyM7kWehW's definition.  I'm sorry you feel threatened by the majority of the country's rejection of your views.  		https://t.co/7wS0KgMxd7
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews I didn't say we were.  Reread the definition.  There are multiple components to the policy proposals you asked about.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews OK.  We started by asking for policy specifics.  You seem mad now that you have heard them.  I feel like your question was answered thoroughly.  Bye.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews I've already explained it to you.  I am not overreaching, the polls speak for themselves.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Seems like your understanding of guns is pretty weak.  What part of a bolt action hunting rifle is semi-auto?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews those are bolt action.  not semi-auto.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews My definition does not include "only those weapons used in mass shootings."
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews buddy, read the NRA's literature on it: it even claims it was modeled from the M14.  Why do you think it is called a "mini 14?"
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews NRA even says it was modeled after the M-14.  Do you know that the military used the M14 before the M16?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews See my definition.  It is modeled after the M-14.  It uses medium-high powered cartridge.  Semi-auto.  Designed for individual use.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews I thought we'd go here.  Burst fire is not used except for in suppression fire, which is irrelevant to mass shooters.  The action for the M-4, as it is used in the military, is identical to the AR15.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Here's the deal: you are in the minority.  Go join the military if you love your assault rifles.  It's fun, I promise.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews You seem to lose focus of your argument.  You were asking for a definition, now you are inputting your political opinion.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Yes.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Yea it is.  There is one irrelevant difference.  Want to talk about it?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews They do know.  It's obtuse hardheads like you who just want to play with assault weapons and hide behind the 2A.  Want to play with Assault rifles?  join the Marine Corps.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Again, any of various automatic and semiautomatic military firearms utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge, designed for individual use.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews It's like saying what's the difference between the M9 and the Berretta 92.  One goes to civilians, one goes to military.  Same weapon.  Distinction without a difference.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews It's a copycat of the M-4, which I'm intimately familiar with.  Want to go down your next rabbit hole re: the action levers?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Again, see the definition I wrote earlier.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews See the definition I wrote earlier.  Do you just respond without reading?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews @benshapiro Nobody asking to ban the 2A.  See policy proposals you asked about earlier.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews Oh sorry, you changed what I said.  I said "assault rifle".  You said "semi-auto."  		Yea, I agree, most people don't want to ban semi-autos.  They want to ban assault weapons, like I said the first time.
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews https://t.co/HKagiwyBaE	67% is a majority
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews But back to the question you asked, are you now aware of what they are "specifically" asking for such that you don't need to continue spreading a @benshapiro false narrative?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews See #3.  Here's some literature: https://t.co/PL2tpv4uLA
@Shenanigunzzz @lemme1sec @CBSNews To form policy.  Are you this obtuse outside of the internet too?
@Shenanigunzzz @CBSNews 1) You asked what they are asking for, and this is it.  Sorry you disagree.  This is *specifically* what they (and most of the country want)	2) See above.	3)  See above.
@Shenanigunzzz @NBCNews 1) Assault weapon ban (we could use this def: "any of various automatic and semiautomatic military firearms utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge, designed for individual use."	2) Mandatory 2-week waiting periods to buy guns	3) Universal background checks

@alcamus @skrbelly1 @TravisAllen02 S Dev: Think of Twitter like the NFL--even though the NFL got pressure from Trump to cut players for kneeling, it wouldn't be a 1A violation to make the cuts.  Likewise, Twitter can ban its users for conduct it doesn't like, even w/ gov't pressure.  Twitter is not government.

@carolmoson @FoxNews @KamalaHarris During the assault weapons ban in the 90‚Äôs, these shootings were drastically less frequent.  Other countries aren‚Äôt experiencing this epidemic. Maybe laws do work.
@carolmoson @FoxNews @KamalaHarris You sure? Cops said this gun was bought legally. Same with Las Vegas. Same with Orlando. Same with San Bernardino. Seems like law abiding gun owners are only following the law until they aren‚Äôt.  Maybe we could just not let them have assault weapons?
@bimmerella @NRA The Russians are winning
@jwmoler @jonmoore @FoxNews And one more thing before you mention DC and Chicago, keep in mind that you can legally buy anything 15 minutes outside of the city. It‚Äôs a BS argument.
@jwmoler @jonmoore @FoxNews No it‚Äôs definitely the gun laws. No other country experiences this kind of carnage. It is uniquely an American problem. And it is here where you can buy virtually any gun you want. These guys buy their guns legally bc the laws suck. Not a coincidence.

@USA_First_2016 @LAKashmer @WilDonnelly @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo You have not. Google standard of proof so you know what it is, then answer the question. It‚Äôs a simple question.
@USA_First_2016 @LAKashmer @WilDonnelly @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Again, what is your standard of proof? Why can‚Äôt you just answer the question?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo What is your standard of proof?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Your rant is falling on deaf ears. What is your standard of proof?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Answer the question I asked you.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Just answer the question I keep asking you.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Again, what is your standard of proof? Beyond all shadows of a doubt? Beyond a rx doubt? Preponderance? Clear and convincing?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Look at the evidence I‚Äôve listed for you as a whole.  Having an office there isn‚Äôt a smoking gun. But it adds credibility to her statement.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Your turn to answer my question: what is your standard of proof?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo You‚Äôre in denial. Again, her statement is sufficient evidence. In light of the other evidence I‚Äôve listed, it‚Äôs a preponderance of evidence
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 6/ Moore‚Äôs colleagues statements that he was into teenage girls when he was in his 30‚Äôs
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 4/ Moore‚Äôs presence there 	5/ her ex bf‚Äôs statement that he has heard these allegations circa 2009
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 1/ her allegations. 	2/ her story being the same 6 times 	3/ her story being consistent w/ court records at the time (custody hearing) ...
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo What is your standard of proof? I‚Äôve seen a preponderance if evidence.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo Let‚Äôs even say you are right that that was wapo‚Äôs goal. So what? Moore has been revealed to be a pedophile. Who would you vote for?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 7/ so the question is, do you vote for someone w/ credible allegations of pedophilia against him? I would tend to err on the side of no.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 6/ there is no proof beyond a rx doubt standard here‚ÄîMoore isn‚Äôt facing jail time. This is in the court of public opinion.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 5/ her ex bf‚Äôs statements. In other words, a prima favor case is made with credible evidence.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 4/ more to the point, there is evidence against Moore. Her statements are evidence. Placing Moore at the scene is evidence. Corroborators.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 3/ even if it did, there are a million hearsay exceptions. Ever heard of ‚Äúeffect on listener‚Äù?
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 2/ it has nothing to do with a newspaper article.
@USA_First_2016 @WilDonnelly @LAKashmer @BlytheS4Cats @ChrisCuomo 1/ hearsay is for court proceedings. It is an out of court statement used for the truth of the matter asserted.

@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Like every other amendment in the const., 2a has to have reasonable limits to protect citizens
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Imo, civilians don't need assault weapons, high capacity magazines, or auto converted kits. Can't think of good civilian purpose for those
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman I just think there are basic laws that could be emplaced that would help prevent some (not all) of this carnage
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Perhaps, but even so, Nevada allows the full auto conversion kits. (See below e.g) https://t.co/50yUZZUYRd

@UnSocialMe @FoxNews @brookefoxnews Conservatives: we care about life. Until you are born.
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Which is why many advocate for stricter gun laws.
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Well obviously this guy is a little off. I think the concern is that he shouldn't legally be allowed to, assuming he got the guns legally
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Yes. As well as legal research on Nevada gun laws (admittedly researched in light of this).
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Including ammo (except armor piercing). No magazine capacity restrictions (drums legal), no req to register either.
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman It is a big deal so I'm sure it'll be reported. Post 1986 mg's are illegal in Nevada. Pretty much everything else is legal ...
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman So he may have acquired them illegally, but I don't think we should presume that in light of how easy it is to get that arsenal in Nevada
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman As far as 19 guns, again, that can be done legally in Nevada.
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Ammo drums are legal in Nevada. That's why I'm curious about your source
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Also, he had more than 10 guns. https://t.co/Jnona1zZvq
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Source? Not disagreeing but I just read on abc that no info has yet been released on the weapons or ammo.
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman ^*older machine guns are legal in Nevada
@Crypto_Flip @AriBerman Are you sure the guns used were illegal? Older machine guns are legal, and I haven't heard what this shooter used. Just curious either way

@Jarhead461 @Faiz_Bham @FoxNews I wasn't. But if he had a plan that could fix the problem, what was it?
@Faiz_Bham @normagenie @FoxNews Obama passed Aca by laying the framework for congress and letting congress run with it from there.
@Faiz_Bham @normagenie @FoxNews Imo, trump should have had a plan ready. Any GOP prez could've signed a bill. They needed leadership in crafting it and got none.

@thinkinglatina @AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Ok, I disagree.
@thinkinglatina @AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson And while people have worked hard and risen out of poverty, I think there are societal factors that tip the scales against those in poverty
@thinkinglatina @AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson No. I'm not assuming anything. I'm stating that poverty isn't a state of mind, it's an income level
@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Fair enough!
@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson I completely agree. But I think it's far more than a state of mind.
@WMattucks @AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Really? Always? Like, dropping out to work to support their family? I guess that's a choice

@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Again, I don't doubt your story.  But to say that a persons income is generally state of mind ignores reality.
@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Which is pretty insulting to people working as hard as they can with the hand they've been dealt
@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson Certainly not saying people haven't risen out of poverty. But to say it's a state of mind implies that people don't want to leave poverty
@AlexanderKane11 @FoxNews @SecretaryCarson I mean, there's an objectively clear poverty line based on income. You either are above or below that line. How is that a state of mind?

@FaithFlaherty3 @ColtSTaylor @RogueCPI @seanhannity @FoxNews @mmfa Not to split hairs, but this is 100% not a free speech issue because there is no government intrusion or threat of intrusion by govt.

@ROTTENCORPSE @FoxNews @THEHermanCain @POTUS Because it was committed by a terrorist born in the U.K., educated in the U.K., and was committed in the U.K.  Vetting has zero relevance
@ROTTENCORPSE @FoxNews @THEHermanCain @POTUS I think the problem is that liberals like myself can't understand why you think vetting would solve a problem like yesterday's attack

It's funny bc conservatives cry about liberals calling them racist, and then they say something like this https://t.co/6cO4lAOAub
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Perhaps you can see why that is prejudicial, and where the two get conflated, especially by Fox News.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Sorry, just not a fan of using domestic attacks to drive a narrative about why we should impose vetting (aka Muslim bans).
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Where? https://t.co/hnWN2uobBb
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Last time: vetting has no role in this thread, which is about the U.K. terrorist, from the U.K.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain In a nutshell, the attack yesterday had nothing to do with immigration, vetting, etc. To imply it does, as you have, is highly suspect.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain So why are we bringing up the issue of vetting if we solved the problem?
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain So are churches.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Why? It is remarkably rare (like maybe one, or maybe none since 9/11) that foreign born terror strikes here. Not worth resources.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain And how to do you suggest we monitor mosques? In America, there's constitutional rights that forbid general warrants. Not sure about U.K.
@OliviaVivianne @AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain Again, what does vetting have to do with anything? Why is it a piece?
@AhnaKey21 @FoxNews @THEHermanCain @POTUS But this guy was born in the U.K.  And he struck in the U.K.  What does vetting/refugees/etc have to do with anything?
@FoxNews @THEHermanCain @POTUS A U.K. born terrorist struck in the U.K.  What does vetting have to do with that?

@Jacie249 @jobar91468 @nebro @IamInvicta @FoxNews So you don't think the students had legitimate reasons to protest devos?
@MartinHeinrich @SecretaryZinke I would support a full government shutdown until we can be assured the president is not compromised. Sorry #bearsears...I don't care today
@AdirondackGypsy @AjadeanPiper @FOIAsaxa @fryan @GovMikeHuckabee Lol...shots fired
@Merked8 @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews Bernard? Bueller? Bernard? I need to know how I should protest so as to avoid offending you...help please!!
@katzkab11 @piddler1 @FoxNews Employees fired by Trump:	Sally Yates	Preet Bharara	James Comey		Employees investigating Trump:	Sally Yates	Preet Bharara	James Comey
@katzkab11 @piddler1 @FoxNews And you mention constitution first in bio, so I assume you understand that president is not above the law, and can be investigated for crime
@katzkab11 @piddler1 @FoxNews This termination should sound the alarm for you, regardless of your ideology, if you support the rule of law.
@katzkab11 @piddler1 @FoxNews Comey, as the director, was in charge of the FBI. He acted on behalf of FBI. For all intents and purposes, comey (did) equate to FBI
@jobar91468 @nebro @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews I have no clue. Do you?
@DavidCornDC Impeachment will happen once dems have majority of house. The offenses have been committed. Removal...that's a whole diff. story
@RetireInReutte @FoxNews A lot of it is unclassified.
@piddler1 @FoxNews I mean, I didn't like comey either, but you can't fire the person investigating you and expect people to believe you had pure motives
@Merked8 @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews So protests, in your view, have no justifications, under any circumstances?
@Merked8 @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews Quite conclusory, Bernard.
@Merked8 @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews That's non responsive, Bernard.
@IamInvicta @Merked8 @Jacie249 @FoxNews If I was student that earned a degree that day, I'd speak up too. If the faculty didn't listen, I'd make my voice heard.
@IamInvicta @Merked8 @Jacie249 @FoxNews In my view, the difference bt that and this is that devos essentially insulted the concept of hbc's. Then got invited to speak at one.
@Merked8 @IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews Are you aware of her misstatements regarding historically black colleges earlier in the year?
@WyattOnlineNow @subrochick @FoxNews I agree with Wendy. Guess I'm a troll too.
@IamInvicta @Jacie249 @FoxNews My only guess is that the school showed no respect for the students--on their graduation day--in bringing in devos.

@MichaelAWoodJr But other goals need more attn in our system, like victim restoration (which may include punishment), rehabilitation, and comm. safety
@MichaelAWoodJr Thus, I believe some punishment should be factored into the concept of criminal justice, though much less so than is currently 4/
@MichaelAWoodJr But unless something puts teeth into the fear of getting caught--I.e., some punishment--then fear of getting caught is no deterrent 3/
@MichaelAWoodJr For example, you may argue (and I'd agree) that deterrence is more founded in the fear of getting caught than in lengthy sentences. 2/
@MichaelAWoodJr Again, I think you are too strong here. I largely agree, but there is some value to deterrence. 1/
@MichaelAWoodJr I also think there it has value in deterrence and more value in victim restoration.
@MichaelAWoodJr I disagree on that point. I do believe it's too strong of a focal point in sentencing (perhaps way too strong), but (1/2)
@MichaelAWoodJr So I'm clear, generally speaking, do you argue justice can never be punishment, or that we defer too much to punishment pursuing justice?

@Sylvia61 @RepKevinYoder @SteveScalise I only ask since most of the GOP didn't read the bill before voting
@NoMoreRomney @thehill No it doesn't. You can believe it does, but you're wrong. 1A protects against government infringing on speech. CNN is not government.
@NoMoreRomney @thehill You may have a different claim here, but it has nothing to do w/ 1st amendment
@NoMoreRomney @thehill But this isn't a 1st amend issue. The 1st protects private citizens from govt, not the other way around.
@jlnja @thehill Absolutely. Free speech--1st amend--protects private citizens from government, not the other way around.

@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Anyways, enjoyed the discussion. Back to work for me!
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I get the gridlock. Both parties are to blame. But I feel like we the people will be the collateral damage in this instance
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I just wish the plan wasn't half baked before passing. They had a long time to come up with something, and threw this together last minute
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews But the bottom line is that if this passes senate, we will find out how this plan stacks up with real consequences.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I mean repeal and replace simultaneously is fine, just make the replacement better. This plan is not even in the ballpark
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Bc we don't believe you'll actually replace. there has not been real plan floated by GOP in the last 7 years
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews The replacement part is the hard part, and outside of freedom caucus, nobody wants repeal only.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Dems are interested in a viable replacement, but this is a joke. What have they been doing for past 7 years besides focusing on repeal?
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews No, repeal has been mandate (evidenced by numerous bills sent to obama by GOP congress to repeal only)
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I'm open to honest discussion, but be fair at least
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews That is literally what GOP did to obama (in healthcare and otherwise)
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Again, we needed to fix the system but it had a ton of benefits (I can speak personally on many). Repeal outright was pure politics
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews That's why so many. Numerous amendments to Aca during the 13 months it was debated/heard
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Well you need a new cbo after each amendment to see the financial impact of amendment. Wish that happened here
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews High risk pools are one of the hallmarks of ahca. I agree, it's the same as exclusion. Aca didn't allow that due to ind. mandate
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I assume you mean cbo? They aren't perfect but they're pretty good. We had the benefit of several cbo's for Obamacare. Not so here.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews High risk pools (i.e. Can't exclude) are going to make healthcare for many cost prohibitive. My fingers are crossed that this bill fails sen
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews According to the last cbo they would immediately but those gains would be short lived. As to this bill, we have no clue
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews As far as deductibles, those are expected to go up per last cbo. No clue on what amendments will do to that, but I'm not optimistic
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I totally understand your concern. And we need to fix that. My issue is that acha appears to make premiums just as high but reduce coverage.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Although admittedly I doubt my state will, as we are traditionally blue.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews But yes states can opt to exclude, that I learned from reading the amendments to the bill-not from Nancy or trump.
@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews Lol...I don't put much faith in anything pelosi, schumer, trump, or price say. I'd encourage you not to as well.

@AZ2016Dude @17b7d325be1d454 @FoxNews I don't pretend the Aca was perfect. It needed work. This bill on the other hand, seems diminish care and increase costs.

@techsneakers @thehill What's my argument? I made an observation.
@techsneakers @thehill Trump is the president right now. Truman bombed a lot of people too. So did Johnson and Nixon and many more.
@Doodelay @thehill This bombing, to me, signals a sharp diversion from that policy. But maybe @realDonaldTrump was just bored today.

@janetking123 we differ in perspective there, but that's a whole different issue. Enjoy your day!
@janetking123 @TravisCoSheriff and they don't.
@janetking123 @TravisCoSheriff ICE can still detain and deport. That isn't the issue. The issue is whether local LE has to comply w/ ICE
@janetking123 read the 10A, and get informed on the anti-commandeering clause Janet, then let's talk.
@janetking123 I'm not saying this from a partisan perspective, although I am a liberal. This is really cut and dry stuff
@janetking123 quintessential commandeering, and has consistently been found unconstitutional.
@janetking123 otherwise it's "commandeering", which violates 10A. The threat of withholding money to comply w/ ice instructions is 2/
@janetking123 thats not what's happening. ICE can do what they want in those cities, but ICE cannot tell local law enforcement what to do.
@TeaPainUSA Yates should just do a cbs special, take an oath, and get interviewed by @RepAdamSchiff
@RepJasonSmith any response Jason? You went to law school. Explain to your constituents why you don't like the constitution.
@KenCalvert that's commandeering. It's unconstitutional.
@TomColeOK04 cross the aisle and improve the #ACA. Enough with the rhetoric. Swallow your pride and get results.
@sethmichaelward @RepJasonSmith ya it's actually unconstitutional too. https://t.co/HCjOT1jYNJ
@RepJasonSmith and that would be unconstitutional commandeering. Ready to get your bill struck down?
@BasedHickory @NPR if you're saying that CA couldn't deal wo fed subsidies, but CA pays more to Feds than it gets in subsidies, that matters
@BasedHickory @NPR I guess we'll stop having a real discussion then.
@BasedHickory @NPR where does federal money come from? We're a donor state.
@BasedHickory @NPR 1) it's unconstitutional commandeering (10th amend). 2) we're not in a drought anymore
@RepDianeBlack how is this not commandeering?
@LaVaudreuil @NPR and oh, btw, the Feds can't even do this: https://t.co/HCjOT1jYNJ

@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill anyways, enjoyed talking to you. I have to go. Enjoy your evening!
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman I'd love to see trump bring the sides together. His agenda is not geared towards that though
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman so if Aca fails on his watch, that's a GOP failing.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman and I like Aca. I only fear now that trump will sabotage it. For example, his first exec order as prez
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill they own it.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill so they accepted status quo.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill they could've improved, but didn't.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill look, I have one point in this convo--GOP now owns aca. They could've repealed, but didn't.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman or come get hep from dems
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman so fix it then
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman 60 senators passed it
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill another option would be to cross the aisle, but @SpeakerRyan made no effort to do that
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill they were good at obstruction over past 8 years...not so much at governing.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill vote dem next election. Governing is hard, but that's gop's job now. They're failing.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill bc GOP now owns it, again, since they didn't repeal or improve.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill dems, like me, like Aca. It's odd that trump just wants to see it fail. That would sabotage GOP.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill you can't blame previous admin when GOP had absolute power to undo it
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill so fix it. They had the majority. They did nothing. #thanksgop
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill could've repealed, could've improved, but GOP did nothing
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill why are you criticizing the Aca? It's yours now
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman either make it better, get rid of it, or own any failings on your watch
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman so this argument that, if Aca fails in future, blame the dems is completely ludicrous.
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman and he promised replace bc Americans (and half GOP) want healthcare. GOP is at civil war yet trying to govern.
@ckriley67 @Rambler946 @arubabeachman if they aren't gonna repeal, or improve, then they own it.

@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill They could've caved to freedom caucus.  Why didn't they?  Hint: GOP now owns the current state of ACA
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill not my point.  Why didn't they gut obamacare rather than do AHCA?
@Rambler946 @GOP wanted that improved.  So my point is, any future failings belong to the party in power (GOP)
@Rambler946 @GOP Right--but they could've completely gutted O'care, but then would've lost the other half of the party who actually 1/
@DavidTDicks2 @arubabeachman @thehill If obamacare is so bad, why didn't they cave to Freedom Caucus's needs?
@Rambler946 @arubabeachman @GOP Exactly.  They got caught playing politics (and trying to serve superpacs)
@Rambler946 @GOP When GOP'ers say that future problems are owned by dems, that's ridiculous.  If it is truly so bad, they could've repealed
@Rambler946 @GOP 100% agree.
@Rambler946 @arubabeachman And that failure to do something better, while they have majorities, means they own the future problems
@Rambler946 @arubabeachman My point is that even the @gop saw the value of much of ACA, such that straight repeal was not an option
@Rambler946 @arubabeachman So then why didn't they just repeal?
@arubabeachman @thehill why didn't the republicans repeal it?
@ConstanceQueen8 @scottymac777 if Obamacare is so bad, why didn't you guys repeal it? After all, you have the majorities...
@jbillinson @kharyp I played 36 today. "But I'm the president and you're not." Wait, I have that backwards
@trumpsajerk @HillaryClinton the competing factions in GOP simply won't agree on a plan

@jadedfool722 @ThopterGo @gayle_ann2 but i do think we should encourage immigration.  it's good for the country.

@ThopterGo @gayle_ann2 @fontaine_keith @FoxNews My feelings are hurt. I'm going to my safe space..lol (which is fox news to troll lol)
@GW571012 @FoxNews And yes, illegals commit lots of crimes.  Proportionate to the rest of the population. So why is this news?
@GW571012 @FoxNews My point is that this is not news--it is propaganda based on a single case study to fire up a blind following
@BruceHaws @FoxNews Every single illegal obtains these docs before working? Are they still illegal immigrants then?
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @SpeakerRyan "get em next time, slugger"
@GW571012 @FoxNews It seems like more of just an appeal to mob justice (aka propaganda)
@GW571012 @FoxNews Perhaps the partisanship has hidden my argument-i'm wondering why this is news since crimes like this happen all the time
@GW571012 @FoxNews This is a very very serious crime, and the guy should be prosecuted, and if guilty, locked up, then deported.
@BruceHaws @FoxNews you've lost me on this one...not being snarky--please explain your argument

@cbigpic1 @FoxNews @POTUS that much is clear.  very little focus.  glad we can agree ;)

@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow no, trump signed the EO.
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow but don't ignore the contributions of refugees and immigrants--they've paid for themselves several times over
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow Lots of things cost $:the wall, trumps future drug policies, care for veterans, and, in a way, tax cuts to 1%
@thehill lol...let's try this again
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow and your OSU attacker grew up in Pakistan (born in Somalia) but Pakistan isn't banned. Catch what I'm saying?
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow over 2k we're killed in 9/11, but that wasn't enough to include Saudi Arabians in the EO. Why Somalis?
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow one gazillion. Bro, 13 people injured, in my view, doesn't suffice to ban muslims from 7 countries.
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow in the spirit of false equivalences, I look at this as banning immigrants bc some of them may have a cold
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow especially when we haven't had a DEADLY attack on our soil originating from those countries.
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow idk. let's have a real conversation and debate about it. A blanket EO banning all falls short of that.
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow but let's not forget the refugee &amp; immigrant contributions to the country. 1 example is the tech industry.
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow security is how trump justifies the EO
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow we'd both be speculating as to how much $.  That's a different topic tho-we r discussing security concerns
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow and while we're at it, let's make healthcare a right for all Americans. Glad we can agree-Compassion is right
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow I agree, let's focus on those. How does banning muslims help those problems?
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow and numerous are by non Muslim. The seven nations banned is a blip on the radar of real world problems for us
@808to818 @FoxNews @JaySekulow while I prioritize many other threats above 'terrorism,' almost all the attacks on US soil are homegrown
