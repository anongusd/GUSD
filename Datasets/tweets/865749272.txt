@05NMa1 @TheSykoDude @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Proved you don't know what you're talking about. 	Christian's believe Jesus is the son of God. 	Allah is literally the Arabic word for God. 	Just like pƒÅp…ôr is the Arabic word for paper.
@05NMa1 @TheSykoDude @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Do we want to act like any of the Christian Bibles dont also include some seriously twisted things as well? Especially the mainly used King James version. Which has been proved to be vastly different than the Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; history taught us King James order it for politics.
@richme4life1 @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes The first 5 books of the Tora is a good place to start. (The Tora is the Old Testament.)
@MaverickSammy @ChunkyStewpot @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Dude, you're continuing to show you dont know what you're speaking on. You cant be Christian and focus on the old testament. That's not being Christian. That's half of Judaism.
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Exactly! Which is why church and state are supposed to be separat! Glad you get the point of why this is all so wrong.
@Kevindogluver @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes No, that would be the incorrect statement. All 3 of the above mentioned religions worship the same God. They have different biblical material while using some of the same old testament books. They have different views of Jesus. This information is easily available
@RichardChode @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes No, it isn't.
@ChunkyStewpot @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes I obviously just answered your question before you even asked. I now understand why you're feelings are as what they are. It's apparently a basic comprehension problem.
@SJW6887 @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Yes, they all 3 have some of the same texts. I have read all 3. Multiple versions as well. The information is very easily available.
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes This is a quote from God to Abraham. Amazing how many Christians do not know even the first book of their religion.
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes That's cute. Yes it does. I stayed on topic. Not my fault you keep changing it when you dont like the answer. Maybe you should start with Genius again. Since the answer you seek is very clear in chapter 17.
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Just like I also know what the Bible says about Islam. 	From The Tora &amp; Bible	Gen 17:20 ‚ÄúAs for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.‚Äù
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes Along with others too. 		I am a Christian.	I am married into a Jewish family. 	I have family members who practice Islam. 	I have each version of the Bible, Tanakh, &amp; Qur'an.	I know the similarities. Especially between Christianity &amp; Islam.
@ChunkyStewpot @MaverickSammy @j_carsonlittle @chrislhayes 'Your Bible'--I have never written a Bible. If I had, I would know it cover to cover obviously. 	I have read The King James Bible (which was written for political reasons) multiple times. My family &amp; church insisted.	I've also read the Bishop's Bible, Great Bible, Geneva Bible.

@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich Um, no. Most companies start at minimum wage. Which federally is only $7.?? Here in Illinois it's $8.25, with a $1.75 yearly raise until $15 . When you consider no where else around here besides Amazon has entry leve positions at $15 that's decent.

@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich I'm with you @Classics275 	There are ways to get yourself out of the lower income bracket. I have been there &amp; seen the majority of people make the choice to live that way. Anybody I know from that life has the same options I did of free education, enrichment programs, &amp; so on.
@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich Sure, except that's not why people start corporations. There's all that pesky free enterprise jazz. We could instead ask why don't min wage workers aim higher? Until they do their circumstances won't change in the majority of cases. I know first hand. I was one.
@Classics275 @MaryRWilliams4 @itsJeffTiedrich As I have stated. I start at $15/hr. Rarely I'll start someone at $10/hr. In my case those are the guys who legitimately don't have a clue what their doing, don't have a single tool of the trade, &amp; they're the ones that need a ride. They don't stay that low by any means though.
@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich No it isn't. I stated.....Nobody is going to start out in a ENTRY LEVEL position, with a corporate pay. $15/hr is a decent pay for someone with no education, training, or skills. Which is where most warehouse workers begin. I know I have definitely not forgotten those early days.
@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich I virtually never start someone out making over $15/hrs either. That doesn't mean I don't have guys that I pay $50+ a hour at the same time. Nobody is going to start in a entry level position with a corporate pay. That's not how businesses works.
@MaryRWilliams4 @Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich I think hes doing a whole lot more than virtually every other company out there. In all honesty $15/he for warehouse work, in this area, is pretty decent. This is this midwest though. When I lived in LA there would have been no way.
@Classics275 @itsJeffTiedrich I live in the St. Louis area &amp; all of the Amazon buildings around here have paid $15/hr since they opened. That's almost double what minimum wage is.

@realDonaldTrump No wall means no security? You're showing how uninformed you are again. Legit, you're the President. You should know this stuff better than the rest of us.
@Prufrockery @emlafudd @HughdeKretser @GuardianAus Thank you for the info! All the fake media nonsense we deal with here makes really hard to know what is and isn't reliable.
@bluejoni @zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @ACLU @realDonaldTrump I do care about all children. Deeply. I was the unwanted, uncared for, highly neglected child once. I am fully aware this is nonsense is so much worse. I would gladly take everyone of they would let me to we find mamas and daddies!
@Prufrockery @emlafudd @HughdeKretser Why didn't they go to New Zealand? They would have been better off than the social climate we have going on right now.
@Prufrockery @emlafudd @HughdeKretser I need to find a couple news companies to keep up with that cover Australia better. I was completely unaware till recently. I'm always reading current events from multiple sources too.
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump But I do remember my grandfather making sure I understood why he enlisted before America joined WW2, why he kept going back, and most importantly he made sure I understood how important it is to notice the small changes towards it again. Those families now. Ours tomorrow
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump No, nobody would ever believe that the oldest, strongest, most diverse, based on immigration democracy that just so happens to carry the name United States of America. USA has always stood for morality before badass. I'm educated live here don't understand this happening.
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 8. we all loose all of our rights. (The Bill of Rights is an  Amendment to the Constitution)		I don't know what you're going through that has you so angy. Not my business. I will be praying for your inner peace &amp; balance. üôè
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 7. accountable. Its unAmerican &amp; illegal to pick and choose which parts of the Constitution apply to whom. Constitution very clearly states all of this and much more. You can download the Constitution from .gov websites for free. If we knowingly allow 1 part to be violated then
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 6 Obviously by your photo you're not a Native American. Immigration is the only reason you &amp; I are here. Do you honestly believe that you're above another person? Those are all rhetorical. for reflection.	We're constitutionally obligated to ask questions &amp; hold Government
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 5. Not just the ones you deem worthy. 	If you've ever raised a child please think how bad home would have to be before you picked up your family, left even sentimental things, &amp; choose to walk 2,000 3,000 miles with them? How bad would your child future have to be?
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 4. another place? A different color than you? When that life actually needs defended, protecting, &amp; cared for? Or would you prefer first breath?  You can not be pro life while not being pro life. That's not pro life, that's pro fetus. Being pro life means you are pro every life.
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 3. assault, psychologically damaging, &amp; medical abuse, living children. That we're not aborted. Like you also want. Beyond twisted reasoning. Advocating laws to defend, protect, &amp; care for lives. I dig this! But...You're all for killing that life when exactly? When it's born in
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 2. Pro life &amp; pro Government unconstitutionally violating federal &amp; international laws by commit crimes against humanity by stealing children that are forced to live in a setting strongly related to concentration camps just to then "loose" them, negligent till death, starve,
@zuzucase @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump 1. Whoah lady! That is some hateful anti-American pretentious dictatored hypocrisy in 1 seriously twisted tweet. Pretty pretentious to factually state what I stand for without asking, let alone having a fact to back it with.
@TheSeveth @dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump Tomorrow I am starting with making calls &amp; going from there. When future grandkids ask what I did to help I want to answer with the same moral substance my grandpa did telling me everything he experienced in WW2.
@kaysuza @Prufrockery @emlafudd @HughdeKretser Yes! Parents &amp; the entire family is safe!
@Prufrockery @emlafudd @HughdeKretser I have spent hours trying to be told or read that they're safe. Cant even get that. Its silence.
@gladiat05153807 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS Honestly I do not know exactly where I stand on these wars. War is always bad. Then again hostile foreign nations that are super ticked off are bad whole lot of the time too. I'm just not educated enough on war. I can't be. I would be a puddle of tears constantly.
@theluebrecht @gladiat05153807 @hipstersawyer @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS You can keep your presumptions. However if you must know, I was all for Trump becoming President. Until he actually announced it. History has taught us time and time again what comes from the hate filled preachs of bigotry &amp; politics of fear used for manipulation.
@theluebrecht @gladiat05153807 @hipstersawyer @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS Not even close. I dislike the blatant disrespect Trump has for The Constitution. The crimes against humanity! The disregard for the office he holds. The lacking care for the citizens he is supposed to answer to. I don't like having to worry my kids are next!
@dizit @RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump I bet there's way more than just these people. There's members of Congress who've went &amp; seen. Meanwhile a wall is the emergency. I don't see how they can look their own kids in the eyes. 		This should count as crimes against humanity as t least.
@RebelliousVal @bluejoni @ACLU @realDonaldTrump Does anybody know if the children from #KidsOffNauru are safe? Australia says their parents came with. US previously said parents are national security risk. I've looked for hours. Nothing confirms they got on a plane even.
@KMR31871 @ACLU @sarahkendzior Parents crossing with their kids has been being call human trafficking by Trump &amp; Co. 	Never defined his version of sex trafficking though.....	This is beyond scary. I can't wrap my head around how these families feel.
@ACLU I stopped paying attention for 2-3 years. 	The things I've discovered that quietly happened/happening in 6 months....WoW! üò¢Big tears at what we became. What the world has became. Smh
@MichaelOfDesert @ACLU There a handful of students that....Are obviously not the mainstream christian. I've seen first hand this has drastically reduced these kids getting picked on, thus improving their education
@MichaelOfDesert @ACLU My kids spend a week on each religion in a public high school. At least to get a basic understanding. I don't want church &amp; state to even consider mixing. However, this has been a good thing. We have several vastly different faiths here.
@browndotflop @ACLU Because it's not a violation of law sadly. 	These issues are for Congress. And now is the best time we've seen so for to stand a chance! Make calls, send letters, go to them, don't be silenced. 	When it's a law and being violated, then here's where to go.
@ACLU Please do! We don't want this. It will lead no where good. We all know why church &amp; state has to stay separate. The constitution can not be changed. If so it's all trash. Birthright will be next if this happens. We can take our children to church ourselves.
@myknittingwool @HughdeKretser Nope. Not a word I have been actively looking. They have not been mentioned here. If they have been mentioned, he was very quietly &amp; the rest of our media ignored it. Yet that's highly unlikely.
@emlafudd @HughdeKretser @Prufrockery I'm American &amp; feel the same. You &amp; I are not the only ones either. This was foolish. Trump's administration has "lost" thousands of children &amp; didn't keep track of them...Nobody is this gullible. Praying kids everywhere.
@D19540305MR72 @RepDarrenSoto @TSA They just get in their emotions and argue because of it. That's not governing. Just adding to problems
@D19540305MR72 @RepDarrenSoto @TSA Just like with the troops hurt and killed in Syria	Just like with the parents who have killed themselves after being told they're children are lost &amp; never coming back. 	Just like the kids that have died in custody.	Government has gone to hell.
@D19540305MR72 @RepDarrenSoto @TSA How do you not see that virtually every member of Government aided this tragedy? He was TSA-lowest paid feds-high stress job-no pay for over a month. I'm not say the Government is entirely responsible, but there blood on hands.
@gladiat05153807 @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS Again, it's all radio available on the .gov website 		Also, before bragging about Trumps booming economy....Look how much he spends on trips. It's crazy high! 		Also, I have a very good understanding of taxes and the laws. Thank you tho. Lovely character you have there. Smh
@gladiat05153807 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS It's all the wars we are in. They're expensive.
@gladiat05153807 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS There's a difference between deficit and debt. 	It's all very easily accessible on the online. They even have pictures. Lmao
@1Bandel Nope. Not at all. I know my truth. I'm happy with my life &amp; my position in the world. As I said, I'm praying for you. üôè

@DrJillStein We don't. Trump made it clear enough to us &amp; Venezuela. 	2/2/19....The day when the ready for war Venezuelan government decided they'd rather try to talk like adults instead of having to speak with the American President. Smh
@hipstersawyer @Christo27879108 @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDude, you're online. Look it up! Intragovernmental debt collectively is less than 30% of the national debt as of last month. That's like 225+ agencies owed. Social Security is 50% of the intragovernmental debt. Also by law SS does not effect the national debt.
@Christo27879108 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS Economy is growing. Debt is quickly climbing. If something slows down. The effects could easily be awful to say the least. This year it'll hit about $1 trillion. 	We should have had a serious depression 10 years ago. We got lucky. If the dollar wasn't world wide we'd done.
@Christo27879108 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS It also has to do with the decreasing quality in education. Not investing in education has left us thinking we understand things better than we really do half the time. 	American started with $75 million in debt that was combined from states after the revolution.
@Christo27879108 @hipstersawyer @theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS I had a ridiculously long tweet typed out explaining this. Then my effing phone died. Smh W. Bush, Obama, &amp; now Trump have definitely been big time spenders with taxpayer money. It's not entirely their faults either. Wars are ridiculously expensive on lives &amp; to fund.
@1Bandel 14 I'm not trying to be presumptuous, but if you are going through something and would like help finding resources that are available to you I would gladly do everything in my power to help you find what you're looking for. üíñ
@1Bandel 13 private reasons. I will say, not even one who can have children should have children. Grandparents rights do not exist in Illinois. My parents know they would never be granted alone time with on of mine or my brothers kids. 		I truly hope the rest of your weekend is amazing.
@1Bandel 12 creatures suffering.They know, they can accomplish anything. When they start going off to college in 2 years I'm going to fall apart. My children are not only my world, they're my entire life. 		My parents.....They're not a topic for discussion based on many deeply personal &amp;
@1Bandel 11 My kids. No need to fear. Just imagine I'm this decent towards you...My kids I'm way better to. They are rockstars. It's incredible getting to be their mother. They have bright minds &amp; work hard at everything they do. Atheyd do anything for another person. They hate living
@1Bandel 10 important it is to be respectful &amp; respectable. You'd be aware that the more negativity you put out, the more you take in. Same with positivity. Go giving people compliments, cheering them on, doing good deed, evaluating the programming watched, music listened to, etc in

@3rdWGamer @ShakesMcQueen @marcorubio Yes I do. Thank you very much for your assumption.
@ShakesMcQueen @marcorubio I'm glad I'm not the only one noticing this. It's been made clear this isn't about the people of Venezuela. It's been part of the plan from the beginning to take over Venezuela, Cuba, &amp; Nicaragua because of how much oil there is between all 3. Exploitation at its finest.

@Pixeltoy @mandala_resist @CalNBC @Lawrence @TheLastWord The rest of the world thinks Trump is a joke &amp; a lot  have been saying he's a war criminal since shortly after taking office. These's a lot of reliable world news sources. I usually find things out through them 1-2 weeks before anything is even being hinted at here through them.
@Commonsenseb0t @Michael_Duignan @MichaelAvenatti The school would have had someone approve of the book because it has their name on it.
@mcvillaseca @ECMcLaughlin @ACLU @krisgoodfellow @SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump The scariest part is....We're all hoping for just psychological damage at this point.
@bajabug @ECMcLaughlin @MeloniaSherban @ACLU @krisgoodfellow Given Jared Kushner's grandparents escaped Nazis &amp; that Trump has Jewish grandchildren he should definitely know better. And he does. It takes a lot of planning to hide thousands of kids. Just a few can make noise for miles. Yet we don't hear thousands.
@LynnRoundtree6 @dobradors @maddenmichelle2 @ECMcLaughlin @ACLU @krisgoodfellow I said this, husband said I was crazy. He's apologized every day since-he knows better. He wanted to have faith in America-his life since day 1 had been military. 4 of ours wanted to enlist. They've said there's no way they're defending crimes against humanity.
@maddenmichelle2 @ECMcLaughlin @ACLU @krisgoodfellow Trump Jr said he met with Russia about adopting Russian children. If these kids were here, with people, or a not yet corrupt agency somebody would be speaking up. My teenage daughter's biggest fear is a mass grave being discovered. That's how much faith even kids have in Trump.
@Sue_ALC @angecastaldi @ACLU Told my parents if they didn't care about 'those people' then there's no way I'll trust them alone with mine ever again. I told my dad my grandfather proudly sign up to fight Nazis just to be damaged from the trauma &amp; wounds. He did it so this wasn't repeated. But here we are.
@Nina_Chanell @juliabroadbooks @angecastaldi @ACLU One of the scariest parts of this. Trump promised there would be a humanitarian crisis at the border. He literally created one. If anyone of us couldn't explanain a lost child, we would already be locked up &amp; prevented from doing more damage. But this is American Justic now? Smh
@RAICESTEXAS I have cried over these poor babies. My kids have cried for them. If they were with their parents, sponsors, or fosters, or anywhere we would hear it. Someone would sayi	 where's mom &amp; dad? Somebody would say here's 1 at least. Meanwhile.......Silence is what we hear.
@LiberalMo @ACLU @SecNielsen Everyone involved should be tried for crimes against humanity! This is exactly why that ridiculous wall, or whatever Trump is calling it today, is nothing more tha  the ultimate symbol of hate &amp; racism.
@theluebrecht @DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS Largest deficit in history-means it only applies to this one. 	President with the highest demographic of untrust by the American people &amp; the world in history due to obvious lies &amp; fictional facts. 	1st in history literally be laughed during UN speech for lies. 	That's a start.
@BeingKimmieToo Pediatric neurology &amp; a army medic.....Smh I can't imagine being one of their mothers right now. We trust our doctors. Especially the specialist. Days ago I made a comment 'nobody in pediatrics can be racist its love of babies life.' And what about the school? They condoned. ü§¨
@Seneco @momobc @TerryMcAuliffe @jaketapper They do go hand in hand though. People are held accountable and then forgiven (in some sense, by some people) typically.
@momobc @TerryMcAuliffe @jaketapper You can hold someone accountable for their actions &amp; forgive them. That's American justice in a nutshell. Do we let the criminal go free for apologizing? No we don't. Are crimes forgivable? Most definitely. It's the same principles.
@momobc @TerryMcAuliffe @jaketapper No, he needs accountability. We can not condone making a mockery of civil rights for 1 &amp; not for another. That's hypocrisy &amp; another form of racism. 25 specializing in pediatric neurology while army medic means knowledge of Medical ethnics-clear violationS.
@NTRL_WMN @MrMikeBlake Again, accountability. Excuses &amp; acceptance is still excuses &amp; acceptance no matter how you try to spin it under the pretense of its for the greater good. Just because someone  does something else on a larger scale does not make the smaller scale less evil.
@NTRL_WMN @MrMikeBlake 25 specializing pediatric neurology, army medic, would have obviously been aware of medical ethnics-clear violation. Letting this slip through the cracks is very dangerous. If it's okay him, it's okay for the next. And the cost of whom? Those who accept racism are racist.
@NTRL_WMN @MrMikeBlake Accountability. Nobody can support this behavior in our government while also not supporting this behavior in the White House, or anywhere else for that matter. That's hypocrisy. Part of what makes a leader able to lead is their ability to rise above to be an example for all.
@Michael_Duignan @MichaelAvenatti I have been saying the exact same thing! ETHICS! Smh
@JillEdmondson @MichaelAvenatti For pediatric neurology at that. He knew about ethics by then. His college yearbook, before med school, listed nicknames as Goose &amp; Coonman. I can't help but wonder how parents of the kids &amp; fellow Army men he treated are feeling right now. My heart goes out to them. üôè
@NTRL_WMN @MrMikeBlake I know my first thought was wondering if he truly put in the same effort for patients of color. I know my dad is a senior living in Va the last 34 years. I would like to know that the leader of his state is for the people. Not only the ones he feels are the right color.
@MrMikeBlake He was 25, not some kid. Had servedthe military &amp; med school for pediatric neurology. By med school knew about ethics. My dad lives in Va I don't want him as gov. Not when my first thought was wondering if he truly took care of children of color.

@dancnluc @ginarwilkerson @karenalicia @ledg1218 @StephGrisham45 @FLOTUS @ninaburleigh If she truly loved her husband, she would get through to him about the lies he tells at least. Part of marriage is careing so deeply about your spouse. Every way imaginable. You want the world to see your person how you do. Except in this case, the world is literally watching.
@DrEricStrong @WhiteHouse @POTUS It speaks volumes when we can't trust our President saying these things. I love how he didn't bother to mention this is all at the cost of the highest deficit in history as well. Smh

But, this need to be vital. Now! Tomorrow's MLK day, everybody's so full of hate. This is what leadership looks like. üíñüá∫üá∏‚úå
@JanetMafGalea @JosephMarsilio1 @moonwatcher1 @Great_Jill @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Stop acting as though Trump has been found guilty already.  	If hes so great theres no need to be practicing. It's like you have zero faith in him. Can't imagine why. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@JanetMafGalea @JosephMarsilio1 @moonwatcher1 @Great_Jill @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You're rushing for a verdict &amp; disgracing democracy. What happened to innocent till proven guilty? I mean if he's really innocent then the FBI will protect The Leader. Like they did the last year while building a case that very probably saved Trump's life &amp; others.
@Cavinaar @garyd552 @IMCisneros @LeighClark16 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump You really should learn why sentence structure is important when communicating via text. That's how you're conveying thoughts, making your voice heard, setting a tone, affecting context, aiding in successful communication, &amp; more. Writing is powerful when used correctly.
@JanetMafGalea @moonwatcher1 @JosephMarsilio1 @Great_Jill @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Well duh! Of course you're gonna wait. We all are! Muller's still investigating. I can't understand why The Great Leader doesn't want this investigation. So many convictions. He promised not to tell the biggest &amp; greatest lies. He promised you wouldn't need independent thoughts.
@moonwatcher1 @JanetMafGalea @JosephMarsilio1 @Great_Jill @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I was thrilled with it! Just like now! Corruption is always bad. All the time. 		The more you know!
@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump I know, not PC.. I couldn't help noticing...You look like you can also be camouflaged with skim milk...	What percentage of Native American do we need for acceptance?	How many generations before we're American enough?	Just for understanding, what are your stats?
@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump Sets the stage for a major immigration deal?	I'm white, not native American.	I'm here thanks to immigrants.
@galencwatson @VP @POTUS GOP still has me confused...Are people coming in by the tens of thousands a day for decades, committing vast numbers of murders, rapes, getting kids on drugs, &amp; just plain evil? 		Or are they taking our jobs? 		WTF do these people do for a living? 	WTF drugs warped their minds?
@VP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Didn't you just brag about your Christian faith the other day? Did you miss the memo about living your faith? God doesn't like liars very much my dude. You're in luck tho! God's way more forgiving than Muller &amp; history will be.
@realDonaldTrump Ummmm.....You're meeting with him because Kim Jong-Un hasn't been living up to his end of the deal to denuclearize. You should really get hip to the announcements that are made. Gotta find a system to keep track of the things you say and Tweet previously.
@realDonaldTrump Even when money isn't available......You'd think your have learned why this is a terrible plan after so many bankruptcies.

@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr Anyway I did some digging &amp; I contacted some people just to see if it was true. 	Apparently it is.	I thought for sure it was a conspiracy theory.
@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr I flip between all the news channels since they all lean this way or that way.	I saw these hideouts mentioned on 2 stations.	I know one show was Last Word with whatever dudes name is. I believe hes on MSN... I'm overloaded w/ info.	So much is happening in the world.
@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr I do not know yet if the House is granted one. 	I do not know if the House members who went looking for McConnell had knowledge of these hideouts.	I did not start learning about them until the day McConnell went MIA.
@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr They're supposed to be virtually silent inside. Their purpose is so they can hide to work on legislation or read legislation without distractions. I have been told a couple wild stories in regards to things that go on behind those doors.
@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr Every Senator is granted one. The doors are not marked. The only way they find one is through invitation of that Senator. The public has never seen one. Previous Senators &amp; people who've worked for them have said some are closets while some a very luxurious.
@moarlatte @vicki123 @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @senatemajldr McConnell was probably in his 2nd office/hideout inside the Capital building when he went MIA.

@realDonaldTrump This is not how you negotiate. None of this is. Did you act like this with Russia? Is that why your deal fell through? If you wanted the chaos to stop you'd get transparent with the people. You could instantly change the worlds opinion of you if you weren't hiding something.
@realDonaldTrump Weather is not climate. They have very different definitions. Learning that is the 1st baby step in attempting to understand global warming. It's a big scary topic for sure. Never to old to learn something new. Or for a  dictionary &amp; tutor!
@paulaptlb @datprettygrl @RonDeckard @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi He can't because of the visa she got. I don't remember the details about it. But it was intended for someone super smart basically. Maybe she is too. But if so she doesn't let it be known. I cant help but thinking if she was she'd have a lot to say right now.
@RonDeckard @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi Illegal immigrants can not receive benefits.
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi @RepEscobar After you all handle the leadership crisis can you PLEASE address the emerging education crisis?
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi Thats basic economics anyone who's ever been responsible for a bill should already know.	The spirit of this country is literally to stand up against the government and injustice. Have you picked up a history book to see how America came to be? They were fleeing the British rule!
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi Our economy has taken a huge hit of about 6 billion dollars during this shutdown because people aren't being paid. No pay means no spending. No spending means no money going into economy. No money going into economy means lower economy.
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi There's families with 2 parents who are both gov workers and zero income
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi They're contracts dont allow it.	Working families are being separated. They can't afford childcare with no pay and are having to send their babies across country to stay with family so they can hopefully keep going to work till the gov opens
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi They cant afford to go to work anymore they get fired. They fired they loose their pension.	Our government is spending money that's not budgeted.	They will get back pay. If they've been working. 	None of them can get another job. Doesn't matter if they're working still or not.
@SuperiSonika @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi This makes zero sense &amp; has zero facts. 	Fact, a million people are without pay.	Half have been working a month anyway. 	Some are now homeless. 	They're have to use food banks.	They're overwhelmed due to call offs
@splashpoint50 @RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi The president isn't supposed to be making deals!
@vicki123 @kylegriffin1 If McConnell will shut up or go MIA again the Senate can vote &amp; approve. Trump has no choice but to sign or he will never be taken seriously by anyone that matters again.	If he doesn't sign Congress will pull it back, revote, &amp; then law without Trumps signature needed.

@maheshengineer @washingtonpost I can attest to the massive grab bag assortment of emotions ot is. Before passing judgment on others think about what you would put up with. What you would put your family through. Some people do not want to change. Some people do not want to be loved or to give love. (10)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost I'm thankful that you have obviously never experienced this side of life. I wish this nonsense on nobody! It is truly a life long breaking heartache like you can not imagine. And when they die you know you never stand a chance of ever being wanted, let alone loved. (9)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost It wasn't my fault I cried. They were both pissed because I lived through their attempted self induced late term abortion. I was born not breathing &amp; in the hospital for a long time. (8)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost No matter who the abuser is. No matter how much the long for their abuser. No matter how much they love that abuser. As the judge said in my parents divorce as they argued since neither wanted me...It wasn't my fault I was born. It wasn't my fault I was a girl. (7)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost I have zero responsibility to her. I am her child, not mother. Her mother was AMAZING! It is my biological obligation to show my children healthy relationships. It is my duty as a woman &amp; mother to show not only my son, but also my daughters they can walk away from abuse. (6)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost She in return kicked my sleeping kids out at 1:30 am last January. We live 45 minutes away &amp; had to get them from the police station. I'm so thankful they were able to get to them before one of the creepers in that bad neighborhood. We still pay her phone bill every month. (5)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost When she started getting in bad health we tried to take care of her. My husband worked a 102 hour week to buy her wheelchair. (4)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost When she lived with me completely for free, including all of her spending money, she poured soda in my gas tank to ruin my engine. I was the only one working. Then she went onto tell people I was on heroin. I would never touch it! (3)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost My mother beat the hell out of me so badly I have scars all over my body &amp; I have not seen correctly out of my left eye since I was 3 years old because of her horrific abuse. I spent 32 years begging that woman. She went onto abuse my kids. (2)
@maheshengineer @washingtonpost Excuse me? No. No where near. Try being a child begging your parents to love you. To want you. To see you. To spend time with you. My father never hugged me, told me he loved me, or anything. He sure did drive me into the ground &amp; kick me out for a chick at 16. (1)
@washingtonpost I have contact with 1 family member, 900 miles away. Aside from my children &amp; my husband. Our lives are alot better. They were abusive. The changes I've seen in my kids since finally removing my mother also have been incredible. I wish I would have done it so much sooner.

@KamalaHarris This is already a crisis &amp; it is only going to blow up into a serious humanitarian crisis. Congress needs to make  serious and real moves to fix this! We are being shown we don't matter. Put Trump &amp; McConnell on a plane to Russia permanently tonight! We don't want any of this!
@SenFeinstein President Trump's wall does NOT fix the MULTIPLE crises that him, &amp; our entire government are causing. How long before we can declare a national emergency against this wall &amp; insanity of a presidency? There's nothing else to call all of this.

@RepAdamSchiff None of you in Congress are taking serious actions to fix this situation regarding the Presidency &amp; government. Not either party or either house of Congress. Therefore you have lost my faith in our system. Congratulations!
@RepAdamSchiff So Congressman Schiff, I will be giving my money to the children my government is currently &amp; will be making go hungry. The family's working to make your lives better. Which appears to be modern slavery at the hands of the government I might add.
@RepAdamSchiff As for me, I personally feel my family has sacrificed enough for our country that is betraying us in the name of temper tantrums, party lines, and a irresponsible &amp; ineffective wall!
@RepAdamSchiff Almost everyone in our country knows at least 1 family that depends on a #FedWorker pay, food stamps, WIC, HUD, &amp; so on.
@RepAdamSchiff As a result I have to plan accordingly. Like so many of the other millions upon millions in my situation, my family in some way depend on our government. A government that's showing all of us it's party before the constitution, oaths, &amp; constitution.
@RepAdamSchiff My family's #GovernmentShutdown has became a war to defend the D/R next to your names as our leaders at like toddlers fighting over a toy.
@RepAdamSchiff I appreciate the beginning of the email I received about how bad things are for #FedWorkers &amp; #OpenOURGovernment. However the money you also request I can not afford to give. Unlike you &amp; the rest of congress I am not a millionaire.

@lwatts414 The GOP controlled both houses for 2 years till 10 days ago. Trump claims he needed 10 votes. Check the sources, its another lie. The right were already backing away from Trump. He needed more than the 10. He worked his ass off to get Republican senators. He could have for votes.
@lwatts414 It's Trumps job to check Congres too. In a costly, evil, twisted way he is too. He's showing us who will take a stand to defend the oaths they took to serve this country first. While the ones willing to quickly concede are getting spotlights on them.
@lwatts414 But since you mentioned it. He did AFTER going to extreme measures. It clearly states in the constitution that Congres' job to check &amp; balance things. Thanks to a unstable president they're now forced into extreme as well.
@lwatts414 Check your reading comprehension. I never said he hasn't taken proposals.
@realDonaldTrump So your wall will not be a 1 time cost that pays for itself in a month then like you've been claiming. That's what this really says. Nice backpedaling. Or are you going to keep the military's checks hostage too? That way you can hurt more of the government works who count on you.

@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Yeah in PR where Trump has failed horribly! Amazing, nobody spoke out then against Trump using fed money to extort officials into publicly praising him to aid an American territory after one of the worst &amp; deadliest disasters in American history.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Not anti Trump either. Hes our president. I want nothing but good things for him. That includes morals, values, good sense, and realizing his ALL of his duties as president after really having to work to get elected. He's really done the unthinkable. Even if it's not in a good.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Please don't. I live a very nice life. ‚úå
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Just like Trump has done with almost every business hes had.		Funny how when you actually pay attention to whats going on you see the pattern behaviors that go on as well. I wonder of that's what peoples impressions of others &amp; their own legacies come from? 		The more ya know! üí•
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Meanwhile nobody else wanted to speak out against Trump then. His cult like following was still backing him. What did Trumo do? Let that power play go to his head. Now hes doing the exact same thing again with the whole government.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine The 'mess' they made was not praising Trump enough for his liking. Which is basically extortion. Extortion is illegal. Using federal monies to get people to give him his way isn't very presidential now is it. Definitely not a good leadership skill for sure.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Again, wrong. The entire territory was destroyed. Even Trumps own administration has had to own their screw up as his worst till now. That's why Trump was avoiding saying Puerto Rico during the interview and trying to talk over the FORMER judge saying it twice.

@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump I was team Trump. Hoped he'd way before announced. Then he got nastier, more hateful, unethical, immoral, &amp; his lacking impulse control virtually vanished. 		Take your made up, convincing nobody, self on &amp; alearn something. Like manners, basic decency, &amp; respectability.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump If you had a law degree &amp; education about history &amp; government then you'd also be noticing all these things that make anyone with half a brain go hmmmm ü§î all add up to some serious fishy things going on with this presidency.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump You'd know Trump busted his ass to rally for a Republican Senate to cover his ass if house impeaches so the Senate will acquitte him.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump He knew it. They knew it. We all knew it. GOP members have publicly announced backing away from Trump as they do. You'd know this wall isn't going to happen.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Then you would know how much of this is complete ridiculous. Again, common sense. If Trump wanted the votes he could have gotten them. He chose not to. He needed more than 10 w/ GOP backing away from him.
@plsmith57 @CMYKICKASSPAGE @LaylaAlisha11 The boarder is 2,000 miles long. The most fencing there has ever been is 700 miles. That's not a lot even during the max fencing time.
@american_kuya @Pstthomas @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine You need to take your own advice.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Don't be ignorant. Don't be a sheep. Learn your history. Learn how the government is supposed work. Get up to date on current events. With modern technology it's not hard and not hard to be sure you're learning from reputable sources either.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Throughout history America has treated PR very unAmerican. If those 3-4 million people lived mainland &amp; this would have happened reaction would be very different.
@american_kuya @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Again, you're wrong. Congress controls all of PRs powers. Trump is their president. They are American citizens. At least 250,000 people moved mainland. They al have the exact same rights, liberties, freedoms, &amp; protections all the rest of us do.
@karenripplinger @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine You're right about that. Everything was destroyed in PR in the 2 storms. There were no roads. People outside the capitol were in the worst situations. People died due to lack of food, drinking water, electricity, medical supplies, &amp; infrastructure. Its not completely fixed yet.
@CherylH95005477 @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine It sure is a good thing you busted this explosive news of a good time too!		After all...		Who could have guested lobbyists wine, dine, entertain, &amp; more w/ congress to persuade the lawmakers into what they're seeking?		The public would have known without you investigating üòÇ
@CherylH95005477 @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine I'm sure they had fun &amp; made great memories among the 30 Dems &amp; 109 lobbyists that flew together, saw Hamilton together, &amp; attended 3 parties together. Including 1 with the shows cast, crew, and guests who have all been speaking out about how eager they are to lobby for Pr.
@american_kuya @karenripplinger @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Yeah....Ummm...I hate to tell ya but there's literally only like 2 or 3% of truckers that are unionized. Before starting a construction company I owed a trucking company. That's the only reason I know this. It was literally part of my job to know.
@nicsicilian @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Thats all according to FEMA &amp; Trump administration too.		 So Mr. Genius...Why is it okay that Trump failed, &amp; continue to fai,l American citizens causing an added 20-25% mortality rate, in a territory America obtained 121 years ago, while Congress determines ALL of their powers?
@nicsicilian @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine He should've declared national emergency. FEMA was under staffed, staff they had weren't qualified for jobs they were preforming, &amp; there were several different states or territories hit by storms back to back within days to weeks of one another.
@nicsicilian @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Knowing everyone in PR was granted American citizenship over 100 years ago means he should have been giving the same aid and assistance (if not more since EVERYTHING was whipped out in PR by 2 massive hurricanes) as in Huston which was hit by 1 horrible hurricane a week earlier.
@nicsicilian @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine The¬†President of the United States¬†is the head of the executive branch &amp; responsible for it's operations. Therefore he's supposed to work for American citizens while taking care of America &amp; its territories.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Im not a liberal or socialist. Thank you; your assumptions weren't needed. It was already obvious you're bored, are not paying attention to what's really going on, &amp; have not been educated on how our government is supposed to work vs Trumps government. Your lack has been obvious.
@MrShiney88 @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Trumps pathetic 'relief' turned a horrible doubled natural disaster into an event that is already well documented as 1 of 	the deadliest natural disasters	the worst power outages	And one of the worst handlings of a national emergency 	In American history.
@MrShiney88 @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine Trump is their president. It is literally his job description to take care of PR as well. Everyone in PR is an American citizen.
@karenripplinger @scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine More times than I can count over the last 19 years. I have several in laws who live on Culebra. I am well aware how bad things are currently, &amp; have been since Maria hit the islands. Just like I'm well aware of Trumps remarks and actions since as well.
@scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine That PR IS an American territory. Isn't was a typo.
@scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine others loudly lobby these Democrats now that Trump is threatening their disaster money &amp; CAs to curb his temper tantrum.
@scottevanjenk @JudgeJeanine We're not supposed to know PR isn't an American territory. We were supposed to forget the people there are suffering after a major natural disaster because our president tries to ignore them. We won't mention how important tourism is for PR either. How dare members of Hamilton &amp;
@DeiSmith @TCDriller99 @tyhit4hr @varttikk @BsayGames @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump A wall and bars will stop cartels? Since when can cartels not afford other accesses? Since when do cartels only cross the southern border? And only illegally on top of that? Studies have shown for years now the majority of illegal immigrants come in in legal visas &amp; stay.
@krassenstein They'll just look up what Trumps latest changed story is and regurgitate it. That's if they're capable of more than call all Democrats snowflakes &amp; claiming fake news.
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi apologized to Mrs. Pelosi for lying. She should have apologized to every member of congress that went to Puerto Rico this weekend for how she misled her viewers. That's the beginning difference between journalism &amp; propaganda.
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi Hamilton, she also made it sound like this trip was all fun and games. This is her trying to protect her ratings since she's one of Fox's top shows by saying she made a tweet to recant. Never mind that only a small portion of the viewers will see this. She should have....
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi pointing out the obvious reasons they went. It was already known who was going well before she went on air. Trump tried to make it sound like the dems are off on vacation together living it up instead of working. While the FORMER judge did say where they went &amp; to see....
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi his pals saying. These are all things any FORMER judge knows to look for when someone pleading their case. Which clearly shows this isn't integrity. That's half assed getting in front of the backlash come tomorrow when the Democrats that are/were in Puerto Rico are back &amp;.....
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi &amp; white in front of them. Why lie to yourself about what the FORMER judge said? Nowhere in that tweet did she apologize. She deflected responsibility instead of owning that lie, or any of the other lies/misleading/out of context things she said last night or stood by Trump &amp;.....
@DeeDraper1 @barryhinson @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerPelosi That wasn't his opinion. That was him pointing out facts that are clearly in front of you. Which is exactly what is wrong with our country. People have forgotten words have meanings. People take what is said &amp; change/lie about what is said. Even when whats said is in black.....
@JudgeJeanine Thank you for owning 1 of the lies/taking out of context to intentionally be misleading things you said during your show last night.
@_Jedi_Night @EdKrassen No way. Trump said yesterday Cohen was just his lawyer &amp; there's that pesky attorney client privilege protecting anything that was said or done between them. And Trump is always honest. I know because he said so. üòÇüòÇ		Total sarcasm
@plsmith57 @CMYKICKASSPAGE @LaylaAlisha11 Then why does BPA &amp; DHS (Boarder Patrol &amp; Homeland Security) both steady producw documentation that illegal immigration is at a 20 year low? Why have all their reports over the years shown the decline? Why does over 90% of boarder towns have lower crime rates?
@CMYKICKASSPAGE @krassenstein @EdKrassen supposed to meet with a foreign leader &amp; then tries to hide the meeting or what what said. Even Trump has acknowledged doing it for the most part. Trump is not harrassed. The nation is trying to hold him accountable. That's how democracy works.
@CMYKICKASSPAGE @krassenstein @EdKrassen anything he has done to be tough on Russia. Well, maybe the Russian people who he probably said on TV last night love him &amp; know he's been hard on their government. And maybe that's true. Ya know, since they have government controlled media for the most part. No president is...
@CMYKICKASSPAGE @krassenstein @EdKrassen Obviously you have not paid attention. Trump himself has publicly documented a whole of his dealings in/with Russia over the years before running for office. Including on here. He says he is the hardest president ever on Russia. Meanwhile nobody, including himself can name....

@krassenstein Virtually everything Jeanine Pirro &amp; Donald Trump said was  misleading, taken out of context, or a flat out lie. Meanwhile neither one of them could have gotten this far in life being as stupid as they're pretending they are.

Instead of buying into foolish propaganda.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump White House website even. All 3 of Trumps are considerably more voyage than anyone before him. Why is that? Oh! Probably because of the 136 additional powers they give him to use &amp; abuse like he does so many others on a daily basis. Yet this is the man running our country.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Yes Obama did. I never said that Obama didn't. Since you wanna go there though.....Why don't you read the executive orders Obama, &amp; several presidents before him, sgined declaring nation emergencies vs the ones Teumo has done. They're very readily &amp; easily available on the.....
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Trump has already declared 3 other emergencies, but now wants to act like hes to nice for that? Meanwhile tonight he goes on TV via phone call just to ramble &amp; tell blatant lies. As Tumo said tonight, the Russian people love him. Meanwhile zero mention of his own constituents.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump jerk who vetoes the bill just to have Congress take the bill back to the floor to veto Trump's veto on the bill. Especially after doing all this since. Trump has said on here today even this is a campaign promise and there's consequences to elections, not that this is a crisis.
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump and spoke not only against Trump but against the Senate not doing their jobs and living up to their oaths of office. Now it is Mullers job to let the Senate vote &amp; he won't at Trump's request because they know the bill will be passed by the Senate. Trumo doesn't want to be the
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump No, you're the one who needs a refresher. Different branches of Gov are to check and balance each other. Trump refused to start the bill that would've passed the house because he knew he would need more than 10 votes because he is wrong! His own party has taken the Senate floor..

@Romony1 @catherinemccoin We are simply asking what organizations you aid. If you really did you would be proud of those organizations, wanting to gain them more support. Instead you're hiding behind you're troll account.
@Romony1 @catherinemccoin No ma'am. You twisted the original tweet was about a Afghan man being illegally held &amp; possibly deported. You expressed that the people donating &amp; volunteering should be aiding the homeless here instead of trying to save the life of a family who aided our government.
@Romony1 @catherinemccoin You're silly. Maybe if you would have stayed on topic from your original comment on the original tweet the conversation wouldn't have changed to your lack of doing while only complaining.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld 2 minutes in and Jeanine Pirro has been nothing but misleading and has flat out lied more than once. Anybody who been paying attention will obviously not be fooled by this nonsense.
@realDonaldTrump Just because you say it on here doesn't make it true. A tweet can not change the actions you have taken that show us all the exact opposite.
@Romony1 @catherinemccoin So in other words you actively do nothing &amp; I was 100% correct in saying you're one of them who just sits around complaining instead of doing. Gotcha!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Build a wall and then discuss immigration reform..Because that makes sense, said no one ever. Let's do something ignorant &amp; worry about consequences later. Sounds like a criminals logic!
@VP @WhiteHouse @CBP One way or another......And that's coming from our Vice President. Yet you wonder why the majority of our country dislikes &amp; wants this administration gone.
@VP @WhiteHouse Why don't you add the context of Obama's statement? Ya know, like the truth. Obama's speech was that the crisis was not being able to accommodate those legally seeking asylum at the border. Not just Mexico used the southern border!
@krassenstein Considering how they lost it when Mr. Obama wore a tan suit.....
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Obviously you have not been paying attention.
@NancyLoukKress @HouseGOP @LisaMei62 Try telling that to someone else. I lived 7 miles from the border for a good chunk of my life. I've also lived in other border states as well &amp; have seen it's not any different than here in the midwest.
@Romony1 @1Dladyspeaks @RAICESTEXAS @Alyssa_Milano @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepAlGreen @RepLloydDoggett @JoaquinCastrotx @CBP This immigrant helped our military. Thats how you get a SIV visa. Him, and his family, will be killed in Afghanistan for aiding our country. ICE is still holding him! Why are you not outraged that this is happening? This is NOT what America is supposed to be. This is NOT justice.
@catherinemccoin @Romony1 No DMC what you mean to say is you do not understand why others are willing to get out &amp; active to help others when you'd rather sit around and complain about them instead of trying fix what you see as injustice. Self reflection will make you understand.
@realDonaldTrump Oh!!! So it's not a humanitarian crisis after all. You just don't want to be called a liar over your ridiculous promise. It's okay Donny, the world already knows you're a habitual liar.
@realDonaldTrump Trump blames Democrats when shutdown started Dec 21 &amp; they didn't take office till Jan 3. 'Fixed' Wallstreet &amp; taxes for upper 1% w/GOP in control but didn't try for a wall then. Even when offered 25 billion for DACA. Smh
@StarnesDouglas @BreeMoore333 @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump Not a lie. That's a fact. 2 years the GOP had the controlling vote and they did nothing!
@tyhit4hr @DeiSmith @varttikk @BsayGames @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Actually there's proof that immigration helps the economy and there has been for a long time. This is not a new fact. A wall is not a 1 time cost. There's maintenance, inspections, and other libal issues. A wall will not eliminate illegal immigration so those numbers are wrong.
@realDonaldTrump That's the medias job! If you understood your job you would know this like every president before you has!
@DeiSmith @varttikk @BsayGames @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Yes! All because Trump knew the wall wouldn't be paid for my Mexico or America. Trade monies are paid by corporations, not countries. There were 0 trade deals signed in those 2 years also. 5.7 billion for less than 200 miles is insane! 57 billion total!
@realDonaldTrump Once again you prove you don't understand your job and love your lies. Congress hasn't approved of the trade deal. Meaning you haven't signed it. Trade money will not go to a wall. That's not how it works.
@NancyLoukKress @HouseGOP @LisaMei62 Not just illegal immigrants run from accidents. Smh
