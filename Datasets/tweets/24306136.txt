Without a hand shake, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump end the final of three 2016 presidential debates. #debatenight
Trump: "Such a nasty woman," speaking of Social Security payroll contributions. #debatenight
Clinton: I am not going to let anyone in this country who are not vetted, but that does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS.
Trump: Syrian refugee influx is the great Trojan horse. #debatenight
Trump: "Aleppo is a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen from any stand point...we don't know who the rebels are." #debatenight
Trump: We're eventually going to take back Mosul and Iran should write us a thank you letter. #debatenight
Clinton: I am encouraged that there is an effort by the Iraqi army to defeat ISIS, but will not put American troops there. #debatenight
Trump: Clinton should not be allowed to run for presidency based on what she did." #debatenight
Trump: "if you don't like what I did, you should have changed the law." #debatenight
An audible laugh in the audience after Trump said: "No body has more respect for women than I do." #debatenight
Clinton: "Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger." #debatenight
Trump: The sexual harassment stories all have been debunked. They either want fame or Clinton's campaign did it. #debatenight

Clinton: "I will not add a penny to the debt." #debatenight
Clinton: I want to make college free for lower-income families. #debatenight
Clinton: I will work with our allies in Asia and the Middle East. #debatenight
Trump: Putin has outsmarted Clinton in every way, like in Syria. #debatenight

Recent WikiLeaks makes it to the debate stage about open borders. #debatenight
Clinton: Deport any violent persons...we are nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws. #debatenight
Trump: We have a lot of bad hombres (men in Spanish) in this country and we're gonna get them out." #debatenight
Trump: ICE endorsed me, first time endorsing any candidate...we have to get drugs out of our country. #debatenight
Trump: "if you go with what Hillary is saying in the 9th month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of her mother." #debatenight
Clinton: "I will defend Planned Parenthood and women's rights to make their own decisions." #debatenight
Clinton: We need comprehensive background checks and close online loopholes that are not conflicting with the 2nd amendment. #debatenight
Trump: "We need a Supreme Court that is going to uphold the 2nd amnt..the justices I will appoint will have conservative bent." #debatenight
Clinton: "We need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights and of LGBT people." #debatenight
First question: Where do you want to see the Supreme court take the country?
We will be bringing you live coverage of the last of face-offs between Trump and Clinton. #debatenight https://t.co/3HLtPh7fCQ
