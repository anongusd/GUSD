@LaurieBriggs11 @Koheeba2 @bravoloverfan @mitchellvii Apple, Fedex, General Motors and list goes on and on. All stating that the economy is slowing. That The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 only blow the National Debt up to a TRILLION dollars for 2028.  https://t.co/F3JBwmW72r  Who going to pay all this debt??????

@phillyant @TrooperEcho @Warwick31 @mitchellvii The taxpayers didn't pull of out the financial crisis of 2008.  The Federal Reserve and the Central Banks of the world with 0 interest rates.  Fox Business, Bloomberg and CNBC daily educating everyone to why the stock market is in a free fall.
@Koheeba2 @bravoloverfan @mitchellvii Recent action by the Federal Reserve is putting a stop to it. Take note of the recent stock market free fall. Take note of the slow down of the Global Economy, Federal Reserve is reducing the balance sheet, raising interest rates. Cutting debt, WOW
@Koheeba2 @bravoloverfan @mitchellvii You maybe right because all the tax cut is borrow money that have to be paid back by our children, grandchildren, greatgrandchildren   23 Trillion dollars and with the 	economy slowing and a 300 billion dollar trade defict. Just check the numbers?
@hockeyfanct10 @mitchellvii Take a second look at the American Farmer and oil prices. Chairman Powell raise rates one quarter of a percentage point. What do that have to do with the rest of the Global Economy, car sales or the excessive federal debt/consumer debt?
@hockeyfanct10 @mitchellvii Global Economy is slowing so is the US. GM not laying off workers, home sale is slow, and the American consumer isn't really saving, just taking on excessive debt. Chairman Powell was correct to raise rates because we're looking at another 2008 financial
@megamagapatriot @mitchellvii 23 Trillion Dollars in debt. Republican or Democrat its a problem that our	children, grandchildren shouldn't have to bare. Going in debt billions of dollars a day. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell have it right. Reduce the balance sheet. Why keep debting
@Darlachic @JasInDaHoosegow @mitchellvii Sorry, millions of Americans when the economy was at its jobs were save because of TARP. If you look at the defict for 2019 and the 300 billion dollar trade defict, you're understand why our children will never be able to pay off 23 trillion dollar federal debt
@grandpoobah13 @mitchellvii Study your history.  What is Welfare to Work?  You are right. Work to welfare helped millions of single mons become independent, sent their children to college, purchase homes and become taxpayers
@hockeyfanct10 @mitchellvii Millions of families every week go over their budget. Cut a little ,  bit everwhere, save and invest.  Freeze the budget, prorated 2 or 3 percent.  FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN POWELL IS ALREADY DOING IT WITH RAISING INTEREST AND TAKING DOWN THE BALANCE SHEET.

It would be better to pay down the 23 trillion dollar debt we owe, do infrasturce and invest in education.  https://t.co/ifGHhoGPCF.  A wall maybe a good idea but	it will not help our children pay the interest less more the debt we.

If we cut out entitlements, we will stop being the land of free and land of education and work. Ends illegals?
@meyers_andi @madmamma4 @mitchellvii Okay, let's stop spending money on illegals. How does an illegal go to a government office and apply for aid? A wall will cost over a trillion dollars. That right over a trillion dollars. Also, it will not work. Our borders are unsecure.
@meyers_andi @madmamma4 @mitchellvii How much do we spend on food stamps? President Clinton work to welfare was a great program. Entitlements is the largest share of our budget.

@meyers_andi @madmamma4 @mitchellvii Will building the wall do away with the 135 Billion dollars we spend. I would prefer to spend my tax dollars on bridges, roads, updated public schools buildings, scholarships. All of these investments will have an 	impact on our economy.
Think you. I hope everyone look up what residual income can do for then and their family. https://t.co/ifGHhoGPCF. It's an awesome thing to have income coming in continuously from different sources based on your life work.
