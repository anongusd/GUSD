FACT: The reason the presidents ‚Äúfixer‚Äù is testifying before Congress today concerns allegations that he worked as a conduit for the PRESIDENT to pay hush money to PORN STARS.		Evangelicals supporting Trump, you are complete hypocrites.
Imagine if the Founding Fathers knew that Congress was hearing testimony from the President‚Äôs ‚Äúfixer‚Äù, who has implicated him in federal crimes.		And the R party hasn‚Äôt asked a single question about the allegations.		The Founding Fathers would find this deeply shameful.

@Michell90013145 And by "destroying the R party" I mean everyone from both the left and the center loudly calling the R party what it is: fraudulent, dangerous, and actively trying to harm the working class and vulnerable people. Ie, please devote effort to undermining Rs.
@Michell90013145 I see where you're coming from, and I completely agree about 2020. But I hope that if the Dems do end up with a progressive candidate (eg Bernie), your movement won't discourage people from voting for them just because theyre a democrat.
@Michell90013145 Is the dem party really the one you want to replace? 	What about an alternative: drive the stake into the R party, and the Dems become the new party on the right, with a people‚Äôs party on the left?
@Michell90013145 Meanwhile, the republican party reveals the extent of its criminal foundations with each passing day, and is increasingly weak and schizophrenic. Not to mention dangerous.
@Michell90013145 Thanks for elaborating- I agree the Dem party has largely been bought buy corporate. But it remains 	1)at least superficially sympathetic to progressive ideas	2)vulnerable to insurgent movements from the left (eg green new deal)	3)the only thing stopping Rs from taking control.
