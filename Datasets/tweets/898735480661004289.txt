@PreetBharara In theory, could the act of discussing a pardon between @POTUS and a subject under investigation be considered obstruction of justice? It would seem like the subjects would be less/unlikely to cooperate if they didn't fear penalty.
It's really unfortunate that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct vote is tomorrow. There should have been #taxdebate and maybe a better alternative would have arrived: https://t.co/GV67dDA40G
@billyez2 your former boss @RandPaul should really see this alternative tax plan: https://t.co/GV67dDA40G

@MasaccioEW Yes, there's no way for it to happen based on our current system. We have another approach that might make it possible.
Filing #taxes on a postcard could be an actual thing but needs real #TaxReform to happen first. There's no way this would happen with anything that looks like our current tax code.		https://t.co/GV67dDA40G
@speakerryan, If you want to fit a tax return on a postcard, this is how you build a #taxplan that can!	https://t.co/i5eBDchV07
There is a better way to save $80B between now and 2027... Shrink the IRS by simplifying the tax code via #TaxReform. Here's another approach		https://t.co/pr55pK5yTU
We think we have a better #taxplan than what the government is working on. Take a look and let us know what you think		https://t.co/GV67dDA40G
