You know it’s love when you have been saying good bye for the last half hour and you are still not ready to leave them. https://t.co/sYFl7ocCZU
No fancy words, long explanations or romantic sayings to describe it. I just simply love you. https://t.co/3JP2ZidPYv
In true love, there is no mountain too high to climb. No river too wide to cross. And most of all in true love there is no ends.
True love is when you don’t need to care about how you look anymore. https://t.co/lBIzopO8NB
Falling in love with you was never my intention. but it became my ADDICTION. https://t.co/pV20Mo4NxN
