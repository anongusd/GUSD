@_kayleighconway And anyway, you changed your narrative.. i asked why you didn‚Äôt want her to wear more exposing clothes out in public
@_kayleighconway The point isn‚Äôt that she wants attention. Why is it that when boys post pictures with their shirts off it‚Äôs okay but when girls post pictures in bikinis or less clothing she wants attention?
@_kayleighconway Not necessarily, but it means you think she LOOKS sexy in what she‚Äôs wearing. What reason would you have for not letting her wear what she wants?
@guhraze Don‚Äôt worry he‚Äôll get is sister to try to argue with you for him
@_kayleighconway My point is that a father should not be able to think his daughter looks sexy in ANY outfits she‚Äôs wearing. Clearly by limiting what she wears he is trying to desexualize her, which requires him to first believe she looks sexy in an outfit

@FirstClass_X But that‚Äôs not what your reply insinuated you were hyperbolizing. That‚Äôs my point, and you can ignore that if you want, but I have to study  so I‚Äôm not keep this up when you clearly aren‚Äôt actually listening
@FirstClass_X You really aren‚Äôt understanding what I‚Äôm saying
@FirstClass_X You‚Äôre overlooking the facts which clearly show that you bringing up the use of a hyperbole was AFTER Cameron referred to your incorrect comparison of how long we‚Äôve known Cameron. Why bring up the hyperbole if you‚Äôre referring to the amount of knowledge you have of Cameron? https://t.co/HfJgxjtvXS
@FirstClass_X your argument would make sense if cameron challenged your knowledge of her.
@FirstClass_X sure, this thread is in reply to cameron saying "how old do you think dana is?", thus leading us here. you bringing up the use of hyperbole in your original tweet in response to cameron saying "...based on your logic dana is five years old"
@FirstClass_X your logic is still off. if you were hyperbolizing the knowledge of cameron's inattention to detail, sure. but this argument is derived from the amount of time you have known cameron, in which you clearly didn't use a hyperbole.
@shady_cam @FirstClass_X @Conrtheirishman X, if anything you should have used an understatement in the original reply because your intention was to indicate how little time you‚Äôve known Cameron for compared to me, so using a hyperbole when stating how much time you‚Äôve known her contradicts your argument
I‚Äôve dropped hints for months on what Cameron should get me for my birthday. Now that it‚Äôs coming up she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù Girl!

As for the Parkland shooting, not only was the weapon used literally designed to kill efficiently (AR-15), but according to the NYT, in FL, it‚Äôs easier to obtain an AR-15 than a handgun. There‚Äôs no wait period. You just need to pass a short background check. Seriously?
The longer we wait to take action on this issue, the more lives are lost due to gun violence and mass shootings.
Side note: stricter gun laws won‚Äôt take away your guns calm down
The right needs to stop with the logic that stricter gun control laws helped every country, but can‚Äôt work in ours. At this point, if you don‚Äôt support stricter gun laws, you‚Äôre pathetic and selfish.
