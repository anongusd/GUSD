@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 still knew every word...timeless...and gave me great comfort! Thanks man
@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 After not listening to your music in the last 8 years, I played everything I had this past weekend...
@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 I began collecting everything I could.
@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 As a die hard Pearl Jam fan...I didnt even like your type of music...but I started that day
@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 Saw you guys in Seattle...one of your last shows together.
@Brooksbuford @OldEnglishD313 It's true...you and them "hillbillies" made some wicked music, cuz you could! Wish you would again.
