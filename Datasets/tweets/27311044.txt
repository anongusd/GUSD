This is the point in the hearings when you realize you wouldn‚Äôt have made it in law school.
@StewSays Yes. WHY wouldn‚Äôt the senators just want to get this hearing behind them and move on
This hearing is useful in learning how Senators see their role in lawmaking - they want the court to handle all of these issues to their satisfaction, but that‚Äôs not how it works (as @SenSasse said yesterday)
Tip from NYC trainer John Offreda for anyone covering the Kavanaugh hearing  1) be conscious of your posture (sit upright, lumbar back arched, shoulders/scapula retracted back) 2) get up &amp; walk around whenever you can (for hip flexors) and 3) drink lots of H2O üëçüèª

So I got up the courage to wake him. He wasn‚Äôt mad. But when he saw the state of the üì∫ he was not pleased. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù There are four remotes. I don‚Äôt know! https://t.co/GRs4KPQBXP
Up to watch wedding. Peter (British, couldn‚Äôt care less about the wedding) is still sleeping. I can‚Äôt figure out the remotes. To wake or not to wake? That is the question.
