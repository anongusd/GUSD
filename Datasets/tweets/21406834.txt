63% of those polled in a new NBC/WSJ poll said Republican positions on climate are outside of the mainstream. Americans want climate action. That’s what Democrats want &amp; that’s what the #GreenNewDeal is all about.		Republicans are extremists on climate change &amp; Americans know it. https://t.co/VbcJgZpAyG
Since @RepAOC and I introduced the #GreenNewDeal a few weeks ago, Americans have been talking about climate change on a scale that I haven’t seen in more than a decade. We’ve ignited a national debate on climate change, and we must keep pushing!	https://t.co/ZasQ185wbO

The sun is setting on the dirty energy of the past. The #GreenNewDeal calls for an historic 10-year mobilization.		We have the technology to do it. We have the moral obligation. We have the economic imperative. We just need the political will. (5/5)
In 2008, there were only 2,580 electric vehicles on the road in the United States. 		Ten years later, there are more than 1 million. (4/5)
In 2008, there were around 80,000 solar jobs.		In 2018, there were 242,343 solar jobs. 		We created almost as many solar jobs in the U.S. in 2016 alone as exist in the entire coal mining industry today. (3/5)
In 2008, we had only 25,065 megawatts of total wind capacity installed. 		In 2018, we had 98,000 megawatts of wind capacity installed. (2/5)

Republicans are resorting to spreading misinformation about what is in the #GreenNewDeal. They don’t want a real debate because they know they’re wrong. Let’s take a look at what actually IS in the resolution and the commonsense solutions Republicans are desperate to defeat: https://t.co/4tz8yBRjpr
North Korea’s blatant human rights abuses are egregious and must be addressed. Instead, Trump shamefully peddled Kim Jong Un’s version of North Korea’s brutal murder of Otto Warmbier, disrespecting his memory and the entire Warmbier family. https://t.co/HIXJMYlpV1

The lack of working-level talks in the lead up to the #HanoiSummit undermined the chances of reaching a successful deal. I urge both sides to immediately continue their engagement so that we can reach an agreement that halts and rolls back North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs.
These communities will also be the most affected and least able to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal represents an opportunity to lift up all workers and all communities.
The #GreenNewDeal mobilization will be an opportunity to repair the historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities, which have borne the worst burdens of pollution from our fossil fuel economy.
Over the past two years, super-charged natural disasters have cost the U.S. $400 billion in damage. We are going to spend trillions by the end of the century.		For those who say we can’t afford to act to address the climate crisis, I say that we can’t afford not to. #GreenNewDeal

The Hanoi summit will be a failure if President Trump offers significant U.S. concessions for mere promises of future North Korean actions. If and only when Kim takes credible, verifiable, and significant denuclearization steps, should President Trump make additional concessions.

Another important factor: Many utilities already are reducing carbon emissions significantly, and through detailed plans that do not result in a price hike for electricity consumers. https://t.co/C2Ewrq1jAv https://t.co/zm8SrUggDJ

Declaring a fake national emergency and spending unappropriated funds on a wall unconstitutionally usurps Congress’s power of the purse and is just the latest example of this President’s excessive overreach and misuse of executive power.
The real national emergency is the political emergency President Trump created with his campaign promise to build a southern border wall. Declarations of national emergencies are for true national emergencies, like 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, not for political cover.
We cannot trust William Barr to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. The fate of our democracy is on the line. It’s unacceptable that an Attorney General would place the interests of the president above those of the country. That’s why I voted NO on his nomination.

The White House budget proposal, due today but delayed by Trump’s shutdown, likely will cut critical international funding. Doing so shows Trump is willing to give up U.S. global leadership in areas where it matters most, especially Asia.

President Trump should not be congratulating Bolsonaro, he should be pushing the President-elect to commit to Brazil’s democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights.
Jair Bolsonaro openly admires Brazil’s former brutal military dictatorship.

Jamal #Khashoggi will help reveal Mohammed bin Salman for who he really is: an authoritarian, not a reformer. His death, the latest and most brazen in a well-documented history of the Saudis violently repressing dissent, must be a turning point in our relationship.

Good to see the companies acting, but Facebook alone can’t safeguard our elections. The Trump administration must take the threat of election meddling seriously and work with Congress to secure our democracy.	https://t.co/fXoBkS0Dxh
'Quiet Skies' is the very definition of ‘Big Brother’. Innocent Americans should not be subject to this kind of violation of their rights. I’m demanding answers from TSA about this questionable program, including if it actually prevented terrible events.	https://t.co/7YJUDaMaoP
Trump seems to understand that there is something dangerous about giving everyone, including criminals, unlimited access to untraceable, undetectable guns. But his subservience to the NRA is 30 million times stronger than his intuition. #StopDownloadableGuns
Remember when Trump said we should raise the age limit for an assault weapon to 21 but then backed down because the NRA spent $30 million for an easily controlled President? Seems like it's about to happen again with 3D-printed guns. https://t.co/KXivW3h8O6

At midnight tonight, Defense Distributed will post blueprints for 3D-printable guns that anyone can download. Trump could stop this right now.

Brett #Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on this case, and his record and judicial philosophy inspire no confidence that he will protect the basic right to health care. His nomination could be the Trump admin’s most harmful health care sabotage effort. We must #StopKavanaugh.
It won’t matter whether you have private or public insurance, conditions like cancer, diabetes, a substance use disorder, or Alzheimer’s. It could mean you are denied coverage or charged unaffordable premiums.
Texas &amp; 19 other states are arguing in the courts that the entire ACA must be ruled invalid. The Trump admin refuses to defend it. If the TX judge sides with these states, it means all of the ACA could be struck down, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
If #Kavanaugh is confirmed, he may be the deciding vote on key legal threats to health care protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

The freedom that blesses our land today all began with a spark of revolution in Massachusetts 243 years ago. Today, let’s celebrate the liberty that allows each of us to be a revolutionary in our own way. Happy #IndependenceDay.
SOON: I’ll be on @CNN discussing my recent trip to the border and ICE facilities, #SCOTUS and more. Tune in!
One thing became crystal clear after my conversations with those being detained at ICE’s Port Isabel facility: the Trump admin still has literally NO plan or procedures in place for reunifying families. The agencies are as much in the dark as the separated parents themselves.
At the ICE facility I visited, I met a woman from Mexico who has lived here for 18 years. She called 911 after her husband brutally beat her. They turned her over to immigration authorities. She now fears deportation. She has 3 kids.		There should be no agency with this mission.
RT @BosPublicRadio: .@SenMarkey joins us to discuss his trip over the weekend to the US border: https://t.co/7nJ1ZcJz8P
ICE's activities have become inhumane and brutal. It has turned into a massive deportation army that is experiencing the worst kind of mission creep and strikes fear in the hearts of immigrants who are simply working for a better life. We need to dismantle ICE.

LIVE: As much as I am heartbroken by what I saw at the border during my trip this weekend, I am enraged. I'm in Boston to share what I saw while visiting ICE facilities in TX and what I learned after hearing the stories of the people being detained there: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/BDsZw6vbDq
Yesterday, I visited ICE’s Port Isabel Detention Center near the border where mothers and fathers who still haven’t been reunited with their children are being detained. This administration tore these families apart and now it must put them back together. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/9xtCvnOdJu
Secretary Azar claims to be able to find any migrant child in seconds, so this should be easy. Ending the family separation policy was just the beginning of righting this historic injustice. Now the administration must quickly reunify the families.	https://t.co/GL1rzGXGda
We're back to Spiro Agnew, George Wallace and Richard Nixon - back to people who didn’t want to make America great again. They wanted to make America HATE again. I hold nothing back in my conversation with @BarbaraBoxer on #FightBack podcast: https://t.co/a2UKhZbbZd https://t.co/eM9gmNlpSt

Overturning #RoevWade would not end abortion, it would just end safe abortion.
A new #SCOTUS justice will shape the law on issues that impact every American for generations. The Senate should not consider ANY Supreme Court nominee until after the midterm elections.
#RoevWade is the law of the land and must remain the law of the land. Supreme Court vacancy or not.
We are now 132 days away from the 2018 election. When Republicans committed to stealing Merrick Garland’s #SCOTUS seat, we were 269 away.
Trump got a weaker deal with fewer commitments than any of his predecessors, and it is no surprise #NorthKorea is already taking advantage of its ambiguity. Congress is ready to step in to tighten the screws even if the President is not. https://t.co/QYsKIo8JZN

You can't begin a negotiation with NK by advocating for the worst conclusion for its leader &amp; expect that negotiation to succeed. President Trump did little to disavow this declaration from his advisors &amp; has approached this summit from the outset with naivete and inconsistency.
When @VP Pence and John Bolton declared that Libya was a model for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, they confirmed Kim Jong Un’s deep-seated fears that the upcoming negotiations would be nothing more than a tactic to invade &amp; disarm his country.
I urge President Trump not to continue with the kind of threatening rhetoric that he used today in his letter, as it only serves to enflame and destabilize the region. While the challenges to a lasting agreement with North Korea are great, we should not abandon diplomacy.

Simply put, my CRA resolution will put #NetNeutrality back on the books because in 2018, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a RIGHT.		#OneMoreVote
Third, the CRA will prevent ISPs from setting up internet fast and slow lanes. ISPs won’t be able to charge large websites for access to an internet fast lane while websites that can’t afford the internet EZ pass will load at a bumper to bumper pace.
Second, the CRA will ensure ISPs cannot throttle, or slow down, a website of their choosing, especially a competitor.
First, the CRA will protect websites from being entirely blocked by ISPs (internet service providers). That means an ISP cannot block a video chat service, just so you’ll use their own service. And it will prevent ISPs from blocking a website with a contrary political viewpoint.
Next week’s vote on my resolution to *fully* restore #NetNeutrality will be the most important vote for the internet in the history of the United States Senate. 		Here's what the CRA resolution means for you:

Pompeo has said that he might bring back waterboarding. A man who has said those who have carried out such actions were “not torturers, they are patriots” won't be able to credibly convey to gov'ts with histories of human rights abuses that these actions are reprehensible.
Pompeo has suggested homosexuality is a “perversion.” At the CIA, he cancelled a Pride Month event that featured an appearance by the parents of a young man beaten, tortured, and left to die on account of his sexual orientation. He cannot credibly represent LGBTQ Americans.

Our greatest weapon in fighting this #WebofDeceit is sunlight. The sunlight of truth and the sunlight that is fueling the solar revolution. It’s a clean energy revolution that is fueling job creation and our economy. It's happening all across this country and around the globe.
The Koch brothers aren’t doing this alone. They have found their most ardent ally in their campaign to attack climate science in @realDonaldTrump. Throughout the Trump admin, there is a concerted effort to deny and defund the science of climate change in an unprecedented way.
The first year of the Trump administration has been a Koch brothers’ wish list – and they are popping their champagne bottles all the way to the bank.
Just last week, the Koch brothers bragged to donors in a report that they were responsible for @realDonaldTrump’s policies: repealing the Clean Power Plan, attacking public lands, leaving the Paris Climate Accord and tax giveaways to #BigOil.
We must open our eyes to the insidious #WebofDeceit that the Koch brothers, in alliance with the Trump administration, are weaving to promote an anti-science, anti-consumer, and anti-renewable energy agenda.

Gun dealers who turn a blind eye to middle-men buying hundreds of weapons to sell on the streets use PLCAA to avoid legal liability. No one should be able to profit from gun deaths. Repeal PLCAA now.
Bars can be liable for accidents when they negligently sell alcohol to people they have reason to think will drive drunk. But under PLCAA, gun makers and dealers can escape accountability for similarly negligent conduct. The gun industry does not deserve special privileges.

John Bolton supports proactively bombing Iran and conducting a first strike on North Korea without provocation. Appointing him to be Nat Sec Advisor is a grave danger to the American people and a clear message from @realDonaldTrump that he is gearing up for military conflict.
With the appointments of Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, @realDonaldTrump is successfully lining up his war cabinet. Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War. We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict.
In his @Recode interview w/ @KaraSwisher, Zuckerberg doesn't accept that the buck stops with him on the #CambridgeAnalytica scandal. He is accountable for FB’s role in this breach. That means he has the obligation to testify before Congress, not another company lawyer or staffer. https://t.co/zp1L3xY6mz

Today, I joined my colleagues in passing SESTA-FOSTA, a bill to clarify that websites like Backpage can and should be held accountable for participating in sex trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children. 		Victims deserve justice. Perpetrators deserve consequences.
In 2016, the First Circuit dismissed a lawsuit against Backpage, brought by 3 women trafficked for sexual services on the website as minors. The First Circuit said that the solution to holding websites like Backpage accountable was “through legislation, not through litigation."

We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say—unequivocally—that we did everything in our power without resorting to armed conflict.
Today marks the 15th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Although the current situation we face with NK is not identical to the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003, the NK situation is, in fact, worse. 		We must learn the appropriate lessons regarding the use of military force.
But we must be clear. There is no military solution to the #NorthKorea crisis.
I am concerned that if these talks do not go well, @realDonaldTrump will be able to claim that we tried economic pressure and we tried diplomacy, but neither has worked. He will be left with the conclusion that the only approach remaining is military force.
Despite his recent announcement that he would accept a meeting with Kim Jong Un, @realDonaldTrump has systematically undermined the effectiveness of the very agency – the U.S. Department of State – that he will need to make talks successful.

Let’s return the United States of America to the forefront of statecraft, allowing our diplomats to advance our interests without risking a frivolous loss of life.
Talks are not synonymous with concessions. Talks backed by targeted pressure and stronger alliances is the path pursued by countries that are strong, confident, and wise. While the drumbeat of war, on the other hand, is the sound of fear and insecurity.
Congress must demand that the Trump administration exhaust all diplomatic and economic options in #NorthKorea short of war. Our pressure on North Korea must be combined with simultaneous and direct engagement with the regime.
We should be open to talks with #NorthKorea. But the State Department is already alarmingly under-staffed to handle the threats from the regime. And we still don’t have a U.S. ambassador to South Korea – more than a year into @realDonaldTrump's administration.
We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say that we did everything in our power to curb #NorthKorea’s dangerous behavior without resorting to armed conflict.  		Instead, I fear that the Trump administration is beating the drums of war.

These are sensible steps that most Americans support. I hope that this movement of young people standing up and saying “enough is enough” will push Republican leaders to once and for all take meaningful action on gun violence. #GunReformNow
Let’s repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act — or P.L.C.A.A. and take away the gun manufacturers’ immunity from civil liability.
Let’s close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns.
Let’s close the gun show loophole, as well as the one that allows someone on the terrorist watch list to purchase a weapon.
Let’s pass legislation that ensures there is a background check on ALL gun purchases.
Let’s ban these military-style assault weapons like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are weapons that belong in combat, not in our communities.
Let’s end the research ban on the @CDCgov so our scientists can study the causes and prevention of gun violence. It is time we treat gun violence like the public-health emergency it is.
.@realDonaldTrump, his Republican allies and the @NRA want us to think there is not much that can be done to prevent mass shootings like #Parkland. #WeCallBS. Here are some reasonable, commonsense actions we can and must take to achieve #GunReformNow:

I believe that in the 21st century, our national security would be better served by funding education, not annihilation. If you agree, share how you think we could better spend this money.
So far, $1.8 billion in contracts has already been awarded to build this weapon. With that money, we could double the budgets of the National Endowment for the Arts AND the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The Pentagon also thinks it will cost $6 billion to operate and sustain the missile fleet over its expected life. With $6 billion, we could build an opioid treatment facility in EVERY COUNTY in America.
The Pentagon projects the cost to acquire the new missile fleet at about $11 billion. With $11 billion, we could hire 190,000 new teachers, enroll 1 million new children into Head Start, or provide nearly 5 billion additional free or reduced lunches for disadvantaged students.
THREAD: This is a nuclear-tipped cruise missile. Defense contractors are developing a new one called the LRSO (Long Range Stand Off weapon). We have sunk BILLIONS into it. Billions more will be spent unless we cancel it. I have some ideas on how we could better spend that money: https://t.co/peu8yVjsFR

America is a nation of immigrants built and fueled by communities coming to our shores to create better lives. We take in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. Our country is enriched by diversity &amp; we believe that the American Dream is not determined by where you were born.
Right here, right now we could pass a bill to protect these young immigrants. But instead, the Republicans decided to use #Dreamers as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations. This is shameful. It is immoral. It is a national tragedy.
#Dreamers are young people like Estefany, who study, who serve, who work, and who live next-door to us every single day. They are our friends, our neighbors, and our loved ones. They are not “too lazy”. They are not “bad hombres”. They are some of our best and our brightest.
As Estefany put it, “After so many tears and sleepless nights, it felt like all my hard work was being thrown away.” But Estefany is a fighter and she is not giving up on her college education or a career. I know she will succeed if she is just given the chance.
Estefany is now attending UMass Boston, where she is pursuing a degree in International Relations and a minor in public policy. So, it sounds like a happy ending. But sadly, it is not. On Estefany’s first day as a freshman at UMass Boston, @realDonaldTrump repealed #DACA.
Her work ethic and desire to deserve her family’s sacrifices were what motivated Estefany and got her through the many hardships that come with being undocumented – fear, uncertainty, anxiety.
Estefany was overjoyed to be reunited with her mother, who had come to the United States a few years before the rest of the family. Estefany was grateful for the opportunity. she was given and did not want to squander it.
She came to the United States at nine years old to escape violence in El Salvador. She was brought here by her grandmother along with her two sisters and a baby cousin.
I would like take a moment to speak about one of these Massachusetts #Dreamers who benefited from #DACA. Her name is Estefany.
#DACA created security and opportunity for hundreds of thousands of young #Dreamers, allowing them to live and work in our great nation without the threat of deportation. So what DACA really stands for is Deserving A Chance in America.
#Dreamers know no other home than the United States. And many of them have spent their lives in limbo, identifying as Americans but lacking legal status and under the constant threat of being sent back to countries that are completely foreign to them.
LIVE: In every way but their immigration status, #Dreamers are Americans and they deserve a chance in America. I’m on the @DSenFloor fighting for a #DreamActNow and asking my colleagues to do the same. WATCH HERE: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/Px7SaVqgdl

The risk of miscalculation and war is far too high and @realDonaldTrump’s tweets have made things worse. We need to focus more on getting back to the negotiating table and less on reckless rhetoric.
A false alarm can lead to war. If the world’s most advanced nuclear power can make a mistake like this, imagine the susceptibility of North Korea’s warning system to potentially deadly errors. 	https://t.co/xSl702Z4At
Remember: “low-yield” nuclear weapons are what leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We should put a full stop to this low-yield plan because @realDonaldTrump should have fewer, not more, nuclear weapons.

@DSenFloor "#Dreamers are our best and brightest and are making the most of the opportunities that the United States has always provided immigrant communities." #DreamActNow
@DSenFloor "We should not punish these young people who have no other home than the United States of America. We should not go back on the word we gave when we told these young people to come out of the shadows." #DreamActNow
