@AmericanAir No, giving a first-class passenger what she wanted at the expense of the rest of the passengers was the priority. Or is an empty, working coach seat on American less safe than a broken first seat? If so, I think the @FAANews has some questions for you.

.@DanteAtkins &amp; how would u know that the list wasn't segmented to ppl who were active on the list more recently? Did u send the email?
.@DanteAtkins &amp; u didn't get a big file. U got 2-5 numbers. The damage a few bad ppl could do is limited vs. 1000s of ppl making +calls.
.@DanteAtkins The small group of ppl who r on there just 2 follow the campaign or 4 opposition research purposes prob won't make the calls
.@DanteAtkins 97%-99% of the ppl getting the emails r opted-in &amp; excited about getting ppl to call 4 GOTV.
.@DanteAtkins No matter what you do, segmentation isn't going to be perfect. I'm sure u &amp; some reporters r on the list w/ aliases

Congrats to Oregon on beating the crap out of USC.
USC's defense is really sucking tonight.
@comcastcares Thanks.
@comcastcares but with how USC's defense is playing, it might be better that I can't see this in HD
@comcastcares  I said Comcast/ESPN in my last Tweet.  As the cable provider, I assume you can work w/ ESPN to fix issue.
The only thing more pathetic right now than Comcast/ESPNs ESPN2 HD issues is USC's defense
The only ting more pathetic than Comcast/ESPN's f up of the ESPN2 HD broadcast is USC
@comcastcares I accept your apologiy if it is an ESPN issue, but you guys really should just fire everyone in NOVA
@comcastcares and when i tried to call this issue into your wonderful call center they hung up on me. You guys really are a joke in NOVA
@comcastcares  Well, all I am getting is a blank screen and from what I see on Twitter this is happening to Comcast uses around the country
@comcastcares  ETA as to when this will be fixed. This is a MASSIVE failure on your guys part.
@comcastcares  what is the issue? Seems like Comcast is fing this up all over the country.
This is ridiculous, Comcast blacks out the USC  Oregon game on ESPN2 HD. Unreal. God I hate Comcast

@flightblogger Yikes, that is rough even without snow. Happy that I got out of BOS last night direct to DCA. Good luck and godspeed.
@flightblogger Depends on where you are flying to. If you are flying into DCA, I would say chances are pretty good. IAD, BWI, PHL maybe not

Wondering why the Obama campaign isn't out here with coffee and donuts.
Anyone know what the tag for election problems or long lines is?

@comcastcares, if they just replace the box without fixing the signal issue, will I continue to have problems?
@comcastcares All the previous techs said the signal is low to the building. They fiddle with some cables in my apt and/or swamp the box
@comcastcares What does it take for Comcast to actually send a crew out to increase the signal strength to an apartment complex?
@comcastcares Could it be a signal issue? I've had 2-3 techs out here to fix other problems such as channels not coming in at all.
@comcastcares Sound goes out on HD channels every 4-5 seconds. Also happens when I try to watch shows off the DVR

I was right. The only thing more boring than John McCain was tonight's debate format. McCain really tried to out bore the debate format tho.
