Update: I've been advised these factoids are in error. Rather, the percentage of farmers attending #Classic19 is the highest in 4 years and trade show exhibits covered 12 acres, not 14. Apologies.
This is a good thread. https://t.co/ngWsxpeTpX
Wesley Spurlock reports that  #Classic19 had the highest-ever % of farmers attending in the event's history: 49% of the total attendance of 9,182 - which itself was the 2nd highest attendance number ever. Total square footage of exhibit space exceeded 14 acres. @NationalCorn https://t.co/fbYuRrx8Xg

I first read this as "...also suggests to me that he may not survive the next few days..." 		Sigh. https://t.co/dJI5L9t1c5
@MNFarmGirl2 Agree. It's a useless conversation without substance.
Talk of sustainable agriculture is not new, it‚Äôs no longer a	fad and it‚Äôs not going away. We need to be able to talk about it ‚Äì amongst ourselves and also to those outside the agricultural community. We think this definition is a good starting place for that conversation.
Will there be disagreements about the meanings of these	elements? Sure. But by providing a definition, we now have a framework of	reference that at least allows for a conversation to take place.
If you think of those 3 elements as intersecting circles in	a Venn Diagram, the sweet spot where all three intersect is where sustainable agriculture	lies. https://t.co/ik1YLLZjnm
Profit: Sustainability in agriculture means providing a fair	margin of profit for farmers while delivering equitably priced goods for all.
Planet: Sustainable agricultural practices 1) responsibly	manage and replenish finite resources critical to agricultural success and 2)	protect and enhance the environment impacted by farming.
People: Sustainability in agriculture means strengthening	farms and rural communities while enabling a safe and healthy quality of life	for all Minnesotans.
One definition of sustainability is from @MNCorn and it‚Äôs made	up of 3 equally important elements: People, Planet &amp; Profit (to be clear,	the base 3P model isn‚Äôt unique to MN Corn).
Rather than just stop using the term sustainability, why not	define it in a way that DOES have meaning and allows us to talk to others about	what it means. (thread) https://t.co/yg1tYBzus1
