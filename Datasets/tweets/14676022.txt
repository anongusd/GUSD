Washington Republicans @McCaulforTexas, @chiproytx, @PeteOlson, @WillHurd, @MarchantforTX24, and @JudgeJohnCarter could use all the help they can get.		These Rs raised taxes + health care costs on middle-class families -- NOT a winning strategy. Texas voters are paying attention.
Don‚Äôt believe the hype? Rest assured, here‚Äôs more:		‚û°Ô∏è Rs failed to flip a single TX district in '18.	‚û°Ô∏è Ted Cruz did not win in a single Dem district in '18.	‚û°Ô∏è O‚ÄôRourke beat Cruz in battlegrounds #TX10, #TX23, &amp; #TX24.		It's a gloomy forecast for vulnerable TX GOPers in 2020.
Our momentum in Texas is the real deal. In 2016, TX Republican candidates beat Democratic candidates by an avg. of 14.1 percentage points. In 2018? The percentage shrank to 7.3 points.		We have the wind in our sails and the plan to expand our House Majority goes right through TX!
Vulnerable Rs in #TX10, #TX21, #TX22, #TX23, #TX24, and #TX31 are well aware of the challenges they face going into 2020 -- not a single Republican envies being in their shoes and these scared GOPers are PLEADING to the @NRCC for help. Don't be alarmed if some even retire early.
Texas is on our mind! And spoiler alert: it's bad news for the @NRCC.		As Washington Republicans grow more and more out of touch with TX voters, it's no surprise that the Lone Star State is trending blue.		But did you know the political climate is changing in 6 (!!) TX districts?

No one made a bigger bet on CA than we did, setting up an office in Orange County for operatives back in April 2017. ‚ÄúWe made a strategic decision to elevate the West,‚Äù @danrsena.	https://t.co/Eri1pS8AcB
By hiring field staff 4 days after the Women‚Äôs March, we built bridges with grassroots activists and built tools to help them organize, which helped expand the battlefield. In 2018, we invested in over 80 districts!	https://t.co/CSLkKaVHOb
.@TJCoxCongress and all Democrats won over voters across the political spectrum by focusing on health care and jobs.	 	Every CA House GOP member voted for Paul Ryan‚Äôs health care bill. ALL. OF. THEM. Half of them lost their seats.
We ran compelling hybrid ads with candidates, allowing their money to go further. Some of these ads were in Spanish, too! Take a look at one of them below. https://t.co/vSQitQyJTO
We helped candidates build campaign infrastructure to fundraise a historic amount!	https://t.co/ktjdqETRBV
Not only did we flip seats all across CA ‚Äî including all 4 GOP-held Orange County districts ‚Äî we flipped 22 of the 25 districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.
While CA is not the only state with a top-two primary, the challenges were unique. Check out this article on how DCCC Chair Ben Ray Luj√°n and @danrsena flipped 7 CA seats!	https://t.co/GyxScRUw3B

So now we have the majority. Our next challenge is to keep our growing for cycles to come. We must find new ways to evolve and prepare for the unique challenges 2020 will bring.		But never forget that you shook the halls of Congress, and together, we made history. https://t.co/Dh6xjtgQSC

Ahead of Election Day, we launched our first-ever multi-state Spanish-language GOTV ad on Univision, Telemundo, and other stations across 8 media markets.	https://t.co/fdjiZTzWbE
We talked to voters on radio, online, in newspapers, everywhere. It worked!		African American early &amp; absentee vote surged by 157% in our #RedtoBlue districts.	Latino early &amp; absentee vote turnout surged by 174% compared to 2014.	https://t.co/SjJUfFowHL
We made a $30M investment in reaching and turning out voters of color and young voters.	https://t.co/OZcxelmn3a
Within days of the Women‚Äôs March, we had staffers in 21 Republican districts, putting our March into '18 program in motion. (Of those 21, we won 17!)	https://t.co/CSLkKaVHOb
18 of the races we won were within 3%. Fewer than 100,000 votes decided the majority! We knew races would be decided by slim margins, so we:		‚úÖMade field investments in 75 districts	‚úÖOpened 51 "battle stations"	‚úÖLaunched 30 voter reg programs	‚úÖHad over 2,500 field staffers
In addition to raising $42.9M directly for candidates, we helped campaigns build operations to seize on fundraising opportunities!	https://t.co/ktjdqETRBV
Flipping the House took lots of money, but you made it possible. We raised:		$272M overall	$106.3M online	$54.5M by mail	$42.9M directly for candidates		The average online donation was just $19!	https://t.co/bWhUzsbmEk
With a large battlefield and the right candidates, we also had to win the messaging battle. On health care. On taxes. On jobs.		Throughout the election, Democrats controlled the narrative. And the GOP knew it!	https://t.co/SU7eQxJDmx
We opened an office in Orange County. We spent over $7M to ensure Democrats didn't get locked out of November elections. We're proud to have built partnerships with over 200 local groups in California.	 	Because of our work, we turned OC blue &amp; made gains across the entire state!
Because of CA's top-two primary, we were in real danger of getting boxed out in at least three core battlefield districts. Insiders and pundits wrote us off.	 	We navigated primaries expertly, ensuring that voters had the strongest candidate on the ballot.
We had a crop of history-making candidates ready to break ceiling after ceiling. With your help, they did!	https://t.co/e45dJZPNda
Forcing early retirements was key to our success, so we released our own retirement watch list. In #CA39, we:	 	Saw a competitive district	Opened a West Coast HQ	Mobilized constituents	Launched digital and radio ads.	 	Ed Royce felt the heat and retired, then @GilCisnerosCA won!
We also built a cutting-edge IE, and it started with our IE Director. In 2018, @jessicamackler served as the first woman director of the IE.	https://t.co/IZVa9pEoTK
We revamped our entire digital program, top to bottom. We expanded the digital team to do things we‚Äôve never done before. cc: @juliaager @b_krebs	https://t.co/av46KQLm1p
Diversity matters. This year, 38% of total staff are diverse and 52% of senior staffers ‚Äì people who make spending decisions ‚Äì are diverse. We also worked with our field teams to create resume banks which yielded diverse field staff across the country.
We made historically large investments across the battlefield, including:	‚úÖ$63M on female candidates	‚úÖ$39M on non-white candidates	‚úÖ$25.6M on veterans and intel officers	‚úÖ$9.2M on LGBTQ candidates	 	This gave us multiple paths to the majority ‚Äì including many Trump districts.
We built a battlefield of 111 seats ‚Äì the largest in over a decade. Our final #RedtoBlue program included:	4Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ women	2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ people under 40	2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ diverse candidates 	1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ veterans and intelligence officers https://t.co/kkUAHsb1po
As the first elected Chair, Ben Ray Luj√°n pounded the pavement the entire cycle, traveling over 52,000 miles through 27 cities and 17 states. He held events or meetings with 93 separate candidates for a total of 151 candidate meetings and events on the road.
Because of you and hard-working candidates, Democrats retook the House with the largest popular vote margin of any party ever, no less!		Here's how we flipped the most Democratic seats since Watergate! (39 and counting)
Democrats' margin of victory just reached the largest vote lead ever recorded in midterm history.		To every student, immigrant, asylum seeker, Medicare recipient, LGBTQ community member, and middle-class family harmed by the GOP: This one's for you. https://t.co/KBrubSQpaX

The kinetic approach we undertook in CA‚Äôs top-two primary, falls in sharp contrast to that taken by the @NRCC and @CLF, who failed to back up their rhetoric with action and shut-out Democrats in key races.
As Republicans admitted, our devastatingly effective and disciplined approach to defining the tax scam relied heavily on tying it to cuts to Social Security and Medicare.	https://t.co/SU7eQxJDmx
We hammered GOP incumbents for their votes to undermine affordable health care and their plans to gut Social Security and Medicare. In May 2017, we ran radio ads in Southern CA hitting 5 GOP House members for their votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
It was no accident candidates outraised incumbents. Our team began working with candidates at the beginning of the cycle to ensure that campaigns had the fundraising infrastructure in place to compete ‚Äì and win ‚Äì in the exorbitantly expensive CA television markets.
We launched our first ever Spanish-language GOTV television ad campaign to get out the Hispanic vote. Between our efforts on the ground and through paid media, these base voters heard from Democrats more than 100 times in the final 60 days. https://t.co/fdjiZTzWbE
We were on air with district-specific Spanish-language television ads across the county, and invested in robust and highly personalized digital ads, mail, African American &amp; Hispanic radio, African American newspapers, text message and traditional field programs.
Our first ever Training Department held workshops in Anaheim, San Diego, and Los Angeles in addition to extensive online trainings. We conducted extensive focus groups with voters of color and millennials in targeted districts across the country, since 2017.
We built a pipeline of diverse, local field directors and organizers from the districts who look like their district and understand their communities. In California, we invested in 11 organizers dedicated to turning out Latino voters.
In 2017, we launched an unprecedented, long-term $30M investment to turn out diverse voters, women, and millennials. We were on the ground organizing in competitive congressional districts, especially in districts with notable Hispanic and AfAm populations, for more than a year.
This was not an accident ‚Äì we spent $30 million to turn out our base in this election. How?
In CA, congressional campaigns in targeted districts registered nearly 20K NEW voters and knocked and dialed voters nearly 6 million times. Latino share of the vote in targeted races closely mirrored the 2016 vote share, even in a midterm!	https://t.co/CQdOSS5XWb
2 weeks after Donald Trump was inaugurated, we invested in local organizers earlier in the cycle than ever before across California.	https://t.co/CSLkKaVHOb

And about that ‚Äúgreen wave?‚Äù We share all the DCCC‚Äôs best practices with our campaigns through regional digital directors. 	 	We‚Äôre helping all our amazing Democratic campaigns rake in MASSIVE amounts online -- so they can get their messages out to voters.
We made early, aggressive investments that have paid off massively.	 	‚úÖA week after Trump won, we made a $2.5M investment to find new donors in the Trump era	‚úÖThose new folks have donated $11M and counting (!!!)	‚úÖTotal, we‚Äôve raised $25.6M from our paid program
...	‚úÖ$460K during the tax scam	‚úÖ$200K during the govt shutdown	‚úÖ$614K when Rs' rescission bill threatened Medicare	‚úÖ$887K during the Kavanaugh hearings		Bottom line: Every time Rs display unacceptable leadership, we ARE making them pay for it by raising money to DEFEAT them.
Our digital shop operates like a newsroom, capitalizing on breaking moments.	 	Online we raised:	 	‚úÖ$1.16M during Trump‚Äôs inauguration &amp; the Women‚Äôs March	‚úÖ$720K during ‚Äúshe persisted‚Äù	‚úÖ$300K when Senate Rs FAILED to repeal Obamacare	‚úÖ$351K when House Rs repealed Obamacare...
‚úÖOur average gift is just $19	‚úÖWe‚Äôve had 495K new online donors	‚úÖThis is RECORD-BREAKING -- at this point in 2016, we had raised $67M
BREAKING: For the first time in DCCC history, we officially reached $100 MILLION raised online.	 	Every single cent from this historic haul by our grassroots powerhouse is being put to use right now to elect a Democratic House that will change our country. https://t.co/QyldimZ9Ww

Between our efforts on the ground and through paid media, base voters will have heard from Democrats more than 100 times in the final 60 days.
Not only have we run Spanish-language television ads in key districts, we‚Äôve activated millennials and people of color with digital ads, mail, radio, print ads, text messages, and traditional field programs.
We conducted extensive focus groups with voters of color and millennials in targeted districts across the country to learn about issues that motivate voters to go to the polls.
We built a pipeline of diverse, local field operatives who understood their communities. Local faith leaders and trusted members of college communities are urging their neighbors to vote.
In 2017, the DCCC launched an unprecedented, long-term $30 million investment to turn out people of color, women, and millennials.
This unprecedented TV ad builds on two years of local work to connect with and turn out Hispanic voters.		We‚Äôre already seeing that Hispanic voters are motivated, voting early, and will prove essential in flipping the House. https://t.co/G9xFLNnWNF

These are REAL people with REAL concerns about the direction things are headed. People who want a change. And they are fueling our most expansive program EVER.		‚úÖ This caters to millennials and people of color -- who will be key to a Democratic victory in 22 days.
Garcelle is a teacher. She's had to watch too many of her students' dreams of going to college disappear -- simply because they couldn't afford it.		She's voting for her students and their future. https://t.co/7pKdbvbBgN
Shannon put her life savings into her trailer. Now, the park is getting torn down. All the money she has saved for retirement will be gone. She‚Äôs voting for a Congress that‚Äôll listen to people like her. https://t.co/UvsKQL9yc1
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just surviving. I have asthma. I might have to choose between health insurance and school.‚Äù		Michael shares a one-bedroom apartment with his brother. He works full time, takes classes at night, and is doing everything possible to scrape by. https://t.co/9Supqm9jXM
Maria sacrificed, working three jobs at times, so her son Uriel could be the first in his family to go to college. She never wants Uriel to have to suffer the same fate. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre voting to change Congress. https://t.co/v8fCZZRm30
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going broke teaching children‚Äù		Gina's a teacher with multiple degrees. But her school's underfunded and she‚Äôs constantly buying classroom supplies.

Luna, Carol‚Äôs toddler, has special needs. Carol is at the doctor‚Äôs a lot with her.		‚ÄúI feel that everything the new administration says goes against us. They‚Äôre not thinking about us. They should come out and spend a day with a kid like Luna.‚Äù https://t.co/52WyCvBuq4
Victoria‚Äôs parents are truck drivers. She even lived in a truck for two years growing up when money was tight. Now, she‚Äôs working to become a nurse, but it‚Äôs not easy to pay the bills. She‚Äôs voting to make life better for her parents and herself. https://t.co/WaNgzqJJMa
Julieta moved to America to make a better life for her kids. Her 27-year-old daughter, Evelyn, has a good job but still can‚Äôt afford to live alone. They‚Äôre voting for a change. https://t.co/1bbos8DSD2
Cecilia is a single mom who works two minimum-wage jobs. But her daughter‚Äôs pre-school and routine checkups put her in debt. So she is voting for a change in Congress. 		We‚Äôre sharing her story across a wide range of digital platforms. Take a look at her :15 cut: https://t.co/1P1tQJcUZe
To win the House and make history on November 6, we knew we needed to mobilize, engage, and activate key African American, Hispanic, and young voters.

#BrownvBoard reminds us that quality education for all of our children regardless of their zip code, race, or ability, is on the ballot in November.	#Brownat64 #FlipTheHouse #TakeItBack
#BrownvBoard highlights how Congressional Republicans simply pay lip service to civil rights while the Trump Administration and Betsy DeVos undo important protections in the classroom.
The hard-fought progress we have made in education and civil rights is a reminder that our institutions alone do not cure our country‚Äôs systemic ills. We have to fight in the courtroom AND the ballot box to preserve our progress and work towards even greater equality. #Brownat64
While the full hope and promise of #BrownvBoard unfortunately remain unfulfilled, we must never cease striving for equal opportunities for all our children. Because when children learn and play together they will grow and thrive together.
In the words of Justice Thurgood Marshall, "None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody bent down and helped us pick up our boots." #Brownat64
#BrownvBoard reaffirmed the true meaning of our nation‚Äôs creed: that all are created equal. It struck down legal school segregation, affirmed that education must be made available to all equally, and demanded that America‚Äôs promise exclude no one based on the color of their skin.
#BrownvBoard marks a turning point in America‚Äôs journey toward a more perfect Union: outlawing racial segregation in our nation‚Äôs schools. In this ruling, the Supreme Court did more than cast ‚Äòseparate but equal‚Äô onto the ash heap of history. https://t.co/bQIKAI7y4n

‚ÄúYou have Democrats who are willing to put their money where their mouth is, and they‚Äôre coming after us,‚Äù said former Rep. Tom Davis, who chaired the @NRCC.
"By the end of Q4, some 230 Democratic candidates in at least 115 Republican-held-seats had raised at least $100K. That will keep growing as fundraising continues and as Democrats make a final recruiting push."
DCCC Executive Director @DanRSena: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to force them to have to figure out where they‚Äôre going to defend and who they‚Äôre going to go down with. It doesn‚Äôt allow their dark money to be able to taint as many races.‚Äù
"A massive battlefield has been a central component of the @DCCC's comeback strategy. Increasing the number of competitive races could overextend the @NRCC and outside groups‚Äîwhich outspend their Democratic counterparts‚Äîas they work to prop up incumbents."
‚ÄúAt least 43 GOP incumbents were outraised by a Democratic challenger in the last three months of 2017. And in at least 14 districts, a Democratic candidate had more cash on hand than the Republican incumbent.‚Äù
‚ÄúAbout 180 Democratic candidates in nearly 100 Republican-held districts entered 2018 with $100K or more in the bank. In 2006, only about 40 Democratic candidates in 38 GOP-held districts reached that mark by the start of the election year.‚Äù

Can you even imagine being a parent of a sick child and watching Rs recess for the holidays, smug with their disgusting tax scam "victory" and unconcerned with your terror of the looming end to your child‚Äôs health care? No parent should ever have to endure this kind of fear.
We are truly horrified by how Rs blatantly cast aside 9M kids. Instead of reauthorizing CHIP, Rs prioritized their #GOPTaxScam and exposed their twisted priorities:		Moreüí≤for millionaires and billionaires	Moreüí≤for wealthy corporations	Moreüí≤for their rich donors

#TX32 GOP Rep Sessions SAYS we should improve DACA, but voted to END it in '16 &amp; against the DREAM Act in '10! Shameful political posturing.
#TX23 GOP Rep Hurd CLAIMS to want relief for over 800k DREAMers, but voted for more deportations in '15. #DefendDREAMers, don't deport them.
#TX07 GOP Rep Culberson SAYS we should #DefendDREAMers contributing to our society &amp; military. The DREAM Act DOES THAT! Why'd he oppose it?
#PA07 GOP Rep Meehan SAYS he wants to #DefendDREAMers, but he voted with #IA01 Rep King to deport DREAMers. Actions speak louder than words!
#NY27 GOP Rep Collins thinks that kicking the can down the road for five years is adequate. We need a REAL fix. It's called the DREAM Act!
#NY23 GOP Rep Reed CLAIMS to #DefendDREAMers, but you guessed it: He voted against the DREAM Act. Enough of your empty words &amp; no action!

#NJ02 GOP Rep LoBiondo said he "again" supports DREAMers living &amp; working here. AGAIN? He voted against the DREAM Act in '10! Fake sympathy.
#MN03 GOP Rep Paulsen wants a law to allow DREAMers to work &amp; live in the only country they know, but he voted against the DREAM Act! Shame!
#MI06 GOP Rep Upton claims he supports a compassionate DACA fix, yet voted against the DREAM Act. He wants credit for ‚Äúcompassion"? NO WAY!

If #KS03 GOP Rep Yoder wants to improve our immigration system why‚Äôd he support deporting DREAMers in 2010? Inhumane! Let's #DefendDREAMers.
#IL12 GOP Rep. Bost NOW claims to want a "just &amp; reasonable fix"‚Ä¶ after voting to end DACA &amp; restart deportations. His words ring hollow.
#CO06 GOP Rep Coffman is now kicking the can down the road by sponsoring the weak Bridge Act ‚Äì a short-term fix. DREAMers need a real fix!
#CO06 GOP Rep Coffman CLAIMS he wants action now to #DefendDREAMers. So why‚Äôd he vote against the DREAM Act? (Hint: He puts politics first.)
