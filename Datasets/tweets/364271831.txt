New stadium holds 41k people. CSU has not had to deal with so many people in the heart of campus before. Lots to consider
CSU hoping to get all vehicles out of parking lots within an hour after end of game
Most parking will be accessed from Shields. Traffic there will be most challenging to deal with on game days.
CSU says it's common practice @ universities with on-campus stadiums to repark students on game days
Students with parking permits will be asked to repark further away on Friday nights before game days to accommodate game ticket holders
CSU parking changes coming: higher season ticket donation = closer parking spots. Audience laughed at that https://t.co/LEU7LZhDIH
