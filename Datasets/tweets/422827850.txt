ObamaCare 2.0 or HillaryCare 2.0. Either way we lose. http://t.co/hsUeO7TIvI http://t.co/IfKsL439Y1

Federal regulations cost taxpayers nearly $750B between 2007-2014, but a change in policy may help cut that down: http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
Can we please start regulating some of these out-of-control Washington regulators?? http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6 http://t.co/Ywd8zwZKse
Implementing cost-benefit analysis is a step towards weeding out biased, costly regulations. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
Requiring cost-benefit analysis might stop regulators from unleashing more flawed regulations over the next 15 mos. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
Washington regulators should implement existing laws, not make new ones. Here’s how they’re out of control: http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
Say what? 35% of major regulations issued by independent regulatory agencies included exactly ZERO cost analysis. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
American families &amp; businesses can win when policymakers require independent regulatory agencies to conduct CBA. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
It’s time to rein in Washington regulators who issue rules without conducting cost-benefit analysis. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
If you think regulators issuing rules w/o cost-benefit analysis could lead to bad public policy, you’re not alone: http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
Legislation that @senrobportman sponsors could help rein in out-of-control Washington regulators. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
ZERO: The number of regs from independent regulatory agencies in FY12 that had a complete cost-benefit analysis. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6
These Washington regulators need regulating before things get too out of hand. http://t.co/tbnaR4j1i6

The more Clinton panders, the more obvious it is the environment is too important to be left to liberal activists. http://t.co/GM9npLQ9yt
#KeystoneXL will emit less methane than U.S. cows. Speaking of hot air, here comes Hillary’s take on the pipeline: http://t.co/GM9npLQ9yt

Guaranteeing that American children get the education they deserve shouldn't be so difficult… http://t.co/JLf2j8E4y2
Nearly 600K students were on wait lists for open slots in a charter school. But liberal courts shutting their doors? http://t.co/JLf2j8E4y2

Meet a modern feminist, @AprilPonnuru. Subject of a recent @IWF profile: http://t.co/Hriv2bTobq
Misleading data may cloud decisions #highered applicants make. The gov’t should connect its data to help students. http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU
The quest for best job-placement metrics leads law schools to use questionable data. http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU
Here’s just one of the reasons conservatives have been fighting for more transparency in #highered: http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU
When law schools juke job-placement stats à la HBO’s #TheWire, students lose. http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU
Connecting existing data for #highered is a simple first step in empowering consumers with better information. http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU
When law schools take a page from the police department’s top brass on HBO’s #TheWire, we might be in trouble. http://t.co/frU8YwFCAU

Liberals should stop standing in the way of #RegulatoryReform that would lower costs &amp; encourage economic growth. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
It's time Washington finally reined in overregulation. #REINSAct	http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
Our elected representatives should approve regulations. Unelected bureaucrats should not impose them unilaterally. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
With liberal opposition to reform, conservatives should pursue an agency-by-agency approach to regulatory oversight. http://t.co/5TfIxwFrLI
The #REINSAct is pretty important. Read our take on it:	http://t.co/5TfIxwFrLI
It’s time to put an end to overly burdensome regulations that raise costs for families and depress growth &amp; wages. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
The average cost of regulatory compliance is $9,991 per employee. Think of the job growth we’re missing out on. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
As the regulatory state grows more out of control, Democrats in Congress hold up reform efforts like the #REINSAct. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
The top reasons to support an incremental approach to the #REINSAct: http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
64% of Americans support having lawmakers, not unelected bureaucrats, approve $100+ million regulations. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
Americans spend ~518 million hours on paperwork thanks to regulations. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8

Federal regs cost American consumers &amp; business an estimated $1.88 trillion in 2014, according to @ceidotorg. http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8

Check out our practical plan for advancing #RegulatoryReform	http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8
Nearly every conservative economic plan includes a proposal to restrain runaway regulations, and for good reasons.	http://t.co/5TfIxwnQn8

No more education policy by bureaucratic fiat in Washington. It’s time to finish the overhaul of #NCLB. http://t.co/Kf0DJa2Bek
Let’s put an end to the loan-sharking approach of the Department of Education. http://t.co/Kf0DJa2Bek
The message from Washington education bureaucrats to states is obtuse. #NCLB http://t.co/Kf0DJa2Bek
Let’s overhaul #NCLB. The Department of Education is supposed to implement laws Congress passes, not create its own. http://t.co/Kf0DJa2Bek

Clinton wants $350B for a #highered plan that fails to address the skyrocketing price of #highered. http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT
.@HillaryClinton’s $350B #highered plan “is likely to make the problem even worse.” - @ocregister Editorial Board http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT
.@HillaryCilnton’s $350B #highered plan is “a huge step backwards.” - Alan Collinge in @thehill http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT
In contrast to Clinton’s $350B spending binge, @AndrewPKelly proposes a new take on #highered in #RoomToGrow: http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT
Clinton’s plan would “ramp up the federal subsidies that have...driven up the cost of a #highered.” - @WSJ_Opinion http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT
The reviews are in, and they aren't good for @HillaryClinton's $350-billion #highered plan. http://t.co/qsB8FMIbyT

In #RoomToGrow, @JimPethokoukis outlines regulatory reforms to provide entrepreneurs a better shot at success. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
.@JimPethokoukis already has ideas on how to help risk-takers and entrepreneurs in his #RoomToGrow book. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
Dodd-Frank continues to hurt local banks, which spells trouble for women entrepreneurs trying to start a business. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
Small businesses create two out of every three jobs. Why threaten job growth with overreaching regulations? http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
Women will account for the next billion entrepreneurs but will face substantial regulatory barriers. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
Regulations are gender-blind &amp; will continue to hamstring the businesses of women entrepreneurs. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp
Even with other barriers giving way, women entrepreneurs will still feel the burden of expansive government regs. http://t.co/bE8fG1L0Kp

A little sunlight would go a long way for the EPA http://t.co/CxjExnAO54 http://t.co/txgf6DQGQ7
The EPA's structure causes chronic problems. But CRN has a solution http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
No more back-room rulemaking. It's time for some sunshine at the EPA http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
The EPA's organizational structure is wrought with opaqueness and lacks accountability http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
The EPA's proposed CO2 regulations could cost $366 billion. http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
Who's going to foot the bill for the EPA's costly #CPP regulation? The consumer, of course. http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
EPA's #CPP regulation is another wet blanket on America's stunted economic growth http://t.co/CxjExnAO54
The #EPA’s excessive regulations make it harder for American families to light &amp; cool their homes. Take action: http://t.co/NkSq7GEfea #CPP
Let’s bring debate, transparency, and accountability to the #EPA:	http://t.co/NkSq7GEfea #CPP
Here’s how reforming the #EPA will help families &amp; improve the economy: http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP
In 2014, the #EPA’s compliance costs totaled $23.1 BILLION. It’s time to reform this overreaching agency: http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP
#EPA's excessive regulations drive up the cost of electricity, food &amp; air conditioning for American families. http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP
The #EPA imposes billion-dollar rules w/o debate, transparency, or any real accountability. It’s time for reform http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP
Bipartisan, 5-member commissions govern most regulatory agencies. But not the #EPA! Let’s change that: http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP
The #EPA’s #CleanPowerPlan is an example of regulations that will hurt American families. Let's reform the EPA. http://t.co/NkSq7GVQ5I #CPP

The government already has data that parents &amp; students could use. Why isn't that info public?	http://t.co/O09BItWfYF
The Know Before You Go Act is a fair, reasonable, conservative way to improve the marketplace for higher education: http://t.co/O09BItWfYF
The gov't should connect the data it already has so that parents &amp; students can make informed decisions about college http://t.co/O09BItWfYF

Parents &amp; students must have the full picture before making a decision on where to go to college http://t.co/lUqub5n3gZ
The Know Before You Go Act allows parents &amp; students to make more informed decisions about where to attend college: http://t.co/lUqub5n3gZ

The Know Before You Go Act provides data on college debt &amp; employment rates to protect students from being defrauded http://t.co/lUqub5n3gZ
Parents &amp; students should have as much info as possible when making their college decision http://t.co/lUqub5n3gZ
What are you trying to hide? The gov’t-collected data on college’s post-grad employment rates shouldn’t be a secret: http://t.co/lUqub5n3gZ

Discrimination against pregnant workers is a real problem. But bigger gov't may not make things better for women. http://t.co/d0N9Du1Qd7
We can reform K-12 education to give the next generation a better chance to thrive http://t.co/jzjDJmxste http://t.co/MtE1VgmNcM
The good news: there's legislation in Congress that will help protect pregnant workers. http://t.co/d0N9Du1Qd7
Here are three keys to improving existing laws to protect pregnant workers http://t.co/d0N9Du1Qd7
Pregnant workers face discrimination in the workplace, but more mandates aren’t the answer. @carrielukas explains. http://t.co/d0N9Du1Qd7
Sad but true: pregnant workers continue to face discrimination in the workplace http://t.co/d0N9Du1Qd7
Women play a major role in America’s workforce; they should never be discriminated against because they are pregnant http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
We can make sure every student has a full shot at the American Dream. Here's how: http://t.co/jzjDJmxste http://t.co/zEBoqLBiwl
RT @RepWalberg: Read @ReformNetwork about my legislation to modernize the workplace to strengthen protections for pregnant women: http://t.…
The Pregnancy Discrimination Amdt makes it clear: A woman should never be discriminated against b/c she is pregnant http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
Let’s end the confusion. The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act must be amended: http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
There should be no ambiguity: The Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment Act ensures protections for pregnant workers http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
There seems to still be confusion about pregnancy discrimination:	http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr Let’s clear that up. http://t.co/zFWTBYNL29
2 out of 3 1st-time moms work thru their pregnancy. Don’t they need protection from discrimination in the workplace? http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
4.7% of women who were pregnant with their first child were fired between '06-08; only 1.4% of all workers http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
While the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act provides a good start, it’s in desperate need of an update: http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
Let’s be clear, a woman should never be discriminated against because she is pregnant http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr
From ’96-'08 the firing rate nearly doubled for pregnant women. http://t.co/WuOYhdibcr Do our pregnancy discrimination laws need an update?

Congress, we can learn from this. Nevada’s @GovSandoval introduces markets to K-12 education http://t.co/Q23ayOw5vw #NCLB
Policymakers should keep an eye on meaningful education reforms at the state &amp; local levels. Look at Nevada http://t.co/Q23ayOw5vw #NCLB

In NV, parents have a say in where state education funds go http://t.co/Q23ayOw5vw #NCLB http://t.co/kyZH6EmKOy
House conservatives must choose: Continue to let the administration rewrite education law or pass a bill of their own http://t.co/FDWgRcHYiI
Did you know the A-PLUS Act FAILS to block-grant funds? Here’s a brief recap to get you caught up: http://t.co/FDWgRcHYiI #APLUS #NCLB
The A-PLUS Act doesn’t make the grade. Here’s why	http://t.co/FDWgRcHYiI #APLUS #StudentSuccessAct #NCLB

Conservatives have an answer to replace Obama’s education takeover. Here’s a brief recap:  http://t.co/FDWgRcHYiI #StudentSuccessAct
Nevada, we’re looking at you. America can learn from @GovSandoval’s example in education reform http://t.co/Q23ayOeuDY #NCLB
Imagine a place where federal educational funds weren’t distributed by a 50-y/o bureaucratic formula. Oh hey, Nevada! http://t.co/Q23ayOw5vw
Empowering state &amp; local officials is an important start to education reform, but it’s only the beginning http://t.co/hQyEbs17nT
Our children’s chances at a better tomorrow require moving beyond this critical reform http://t.co/hQyEbs17nT

Full business expensing could grow workers’ wages by about 4%. Why wouldn’t we do this? http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
Full business expensing will promote business investment and contribute to increased economic growth. Let’s do this.  http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
When IRS regulations depreciate the value of biz investment, is it any wonder our economy has seen less investment? http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
How can a business increase productivity if its investment in new equipment won’t be fully deductible for ~ 20 years? http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
When the gov’t discourages business investment, the American economy suffers	http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
Let’s allow businesses to deduct the full amount of their investments in the 1st year, not 20 years later 	http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
Full business expensing: this simple tax change could raise wages by around 4%. Boom. http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
Why should a business face the cost of investment immediately but have to wait years to deduct the expense fully? http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ
If we know business investment promotes economic growth, why does the government discourage it? http://t.co/H5bCrMXLBJ

Outdated bureaucratic formulas &lt; Access to the best education possible for U.S. children http://t.co/p9yiZXvcmS
Federal aid for K-12 students should go where their parents think it will do them the most good. http://t.co/CuCLI9BlMw
Students matter most, not the convenience of an education bureaucracy. http://t.co/CuCLI9BlMw
Parents know more about their child’s educational needs than the state ever could. Let’s let them make the decisions: http://t.co/CuCLI9BlMw
Let’s let federal education dollars follow the student. http://t.co/CuCLI9BlMw
Federal educational aid should be based on the needs of students more than those of school administrators. http://t.co/CuCLI9BlMw
