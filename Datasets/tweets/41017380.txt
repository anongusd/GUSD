When I served, I woke up every morning knowing 700,000 people were counting on me to provide solutions.
Removing Trump isn’t a political calculation, it’s a moral decision.
There should be as many votes for impeachment as there were to kill ACA.
My opponent says that the vote for impeachment was “premature”. That is so weak. We don’t need Mueller to tell us Trump acted criminally, we have seen it with our own eyes.
We can secure our elections by using law enforcement and by doing something about a President who is acting as a Russian asset. That’s why I will draft articles of impeachment as soon as I am elected.
I voted for the DREAM Act. My opponent voted against it.	In my time in congress we worked on solutions.
I’m talking about #Medicare4All 	My opponent is talking about more marketing for Obamacare.
No more lip service, no more airy fairy ideas. #MedicareForAll
Cutting Social Security is a priority for the GOP. My opponent has stated that he is open minded to cuts to Social Security. 		Seniors deserve a raise, we shouldn’t be borrowing from Peter to pay Peter.
The things that make us different, make us special. That is what education should be about, to be all that you can be.
The War is Making You Poor Act will reduce taxes on Americans and would cut wasteful spending.
The solution to affordable housing according to my opponent is to build “tiny houses” rather than use the tools of the federal government to reduce the housing cost burden on families.
My opponent can’t deny that he was holding fundraisers as Hurricanes Maria and Irma hit.
“Most effective member of congress” isn’t something that gets handed out to liberal Democrats.

Trump’s Syria policy isn’t “locked and loaded”; it’s more like “blocked and bloated.”  ‘Blocked’ because, as we found out yesterday, Trump isn’t really willing (or able?) to do anything against Syria’s Big Daddy, Russia.
Because otherwise, as Albert Einstein pointed out, doing the same thing over and over again, and hoping for a different result, is the definition of insanity.
Look, if we’re going to spend half a billion dollars to blow up three empty buildings, could we have some skein of thought, some concatenation of syllables, some rationalization at least, that this “strategy” might conceivably accomplish its reputed goal?

Full interview here on #Syria with @AriRabinHavt (show is @AgendaSXM) https://t.co/LDFg5MDi5V
It seems the administration is only putting out info that would lead one to believe the Syrian gov't deliberately used chemical weapons.
One thing that is perfectly clear to me is that there is no desire on the part of the American people to be the world's policeman.
If the Syrian government wanted to terrorize its own population into submission, it would say it's using gas.
RT @Zaannnn: @AlanGrayson thank you for consistently sobering the discussion with truth.
There's no particular benefit to the Syrian government in killing these specific 200 victims.
When you actually delve into the evidence of deliberate chemical weapons use by the Syrian government, the evidence is genuinely ambiguous.
Can't we finish our wars? Why do we have to start new ones before we finish the old ones?
There's no vital national security involved even if the Syrian gov't is proved to have deliberately used chemical weapons, which is a big if
