@FoxyDeme Thank you Ma'am!! Have a lovely day in Canada!
@1SupremeGoddess Evil cannot rule our lives but we can nullify it and ultimately destroy it.
My mission today was to ensure that our friendship remain super glued for life!
I ask that you forgive, I ask not that you forget!
@1SupremeGoddess Don't be enslaved by their actions. Forgiveness will set you free.
RT @mya177: RT @ZillaBravoZulu	  	Friends are the family that we choose for ourselves.
Thanks for sharing, see you……
Friends are the family that we choose for ourselves.
No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up. Yield. Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift.
Get outside every day. 	Miracles are waiting everywhere..
All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.
Your children get only one childhood.
Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now.
God loves you because of who God is, not because of  anything you did or didn't do.
Believe in miracles.
Time heals almost everything. Give time, time.
Forgive everyone everything.
Always choose life.
No one is in charge of your happiness 	but you.
Frame every so-called disaster with these words ''In five years, will this matter?".
Be eccentric now. 	Don't wait for old age to wear purple.
Over prepare, then go with the flow.
When it comes to going after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer.
It's never too late to have a happy childhood. But the second one is up to you and no one else.
Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger.
Get rid of anything that isn't useful, beautiful or joyful.
Take a deep breath. 	It calms the mind.
Everything can change in the blink of an eye. But don't worry; God never blinks.
Don't compare your life to others. 	You have no idea what their journey is all about.
It's OK to let your children see you cry.
It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it.
Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone.
Life is too short to waste time hating anyone.
Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift.
Envy is a waste of time. 	You already have all you need.
If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's, we'd grab ours back.
32.Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.
However good or bad a situation is, it will change.
What other people think of you is none of your business...
Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present
Life isn't fair, but it's still good

Socialism/communism does work for the American people, so mr. bo I suggest you try another tactic to win the hearts of all Americans!
The dems are definitely leftist socialist liberals, what they don't know is, that there's a fine line between socialism and Communism.
There should be a presidential limit as to how many czars the president can hire and they need to be vetted by congress as a minimum.
Every government has some corruption, however, the obama administration's level of corruption is truly unprecedented, i.e. phony job czars!
