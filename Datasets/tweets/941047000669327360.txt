Can someone read the Nunes memo to me? It just looks like a page full of pointless squiggles. Maybe that's what it is. #ReleaseTheMemo #NunesHoax

Sometimes when my person eats treats he gets very friendly. They smell funny, but he says they make him baked. I like baked things. And baked people. Why do you hate my person Jeff Sessions? https://t.co/kjgFamDRML

@People4Bernie Look at all the good doggos here for a heckin' revolution!
Ball? BALL! Happy new year! May 2018 bring good fortune to all puppers #NewYearsEve2018 #NewYears2018 #balldrop https://t.co/ym9mheywx0
I am endorsing this progressive campaign. For too long, vacuum manufacturers have exploited the ears of vulnerable woofers. #vacuum #dog https://t.co/WKoCeOh1oZ
A solemn bork for Erica Garner. You gave many good pets. Always sad when a good hooman who fought for justice is lost. #EricaGarner
Thanks for the follow @charliekirk11 . Some older doggos wear diapers too, but I firmly believe they have earned their heckin' dignity. Even some famous woofers have worn diapers, like Laika, the Soviet space pup!
No doggo should have to worry about having enough treats for their puppers. @SpeakerRyan #Foodstamps #PaulRyan https://t.co/PSB85po6Va
"Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered" Proverbs 21:13. Merry Christmas everyone!		P.S. Happy birthday Isaac Newton. Without gravity fetch wouldn't be the same.
Most police woofers are good woofers, but any police brutality is unacceptable. These woofers need strong training and oversight. https://t.co/SrOpuarfXl
I'm eating your tiny shoes tonight. #TaxScam #Tinyhands https://t.co/RX4s3hWJCK
Working woofers deserve a raise. They need money for treats and squeaky toys and floofy beds. Only when all doggos are ensured a heckin' living wage will this nation give every doggo a reason to bork with joy. #FightFor15
Veteranarians give doggos lots of attention. Vets are good hoomans. All doggos should be able to see a vet when they need one.  This is a moral imperative and also the vet gives me tummy rubs #MedicareForAll
This tax bill is worse than stealing treats. It's a heckin' disgrace. Stop stealing from honest, hardworking floofers, @SenBobCorker. #TaxScam #TaxBillScam #CorkerKickback https://t.co/iQoQQOkkYE
All doggos are good doggos	https://t.co/UyKciYCelg https://t.co/Qkzlu2sFqo
The woofers at the CDC need these terms to bork accurately and effectively. Banning borks will not help keep woofers safe and healthy. #CDC7words #CDCForbiddenWords #CDC #cdcbannedwords https://t.co/7JoGwGS9HX
Why do you hate little puppers Ann? @marcorubio isn't a good boy but at least he gives us scritches sometimes. https://t.co/Br4nREeroA
Net neutrality lets everyone see the good doggos equally. Let's all tell @AjitPaiFCC if we can't see the puppers, neither can you https://t.co/Etrw5d94PP
When I dream, my legs do little flutter kicks in the air. They are very good dreams. Everyone deserves to be able to dream, and that includes foreign puppers who grew up here too. They make our country cute AND great. #DreamAct #DreamActNow
@CNN Even doggos know not to touch little puppers like you did @RoyMooreSenator . When we lose races we don't pout. We keep on zoomin. But you shouldn't get to zoom. You were a very bad boy.
@SenDeanHeller Bo borked at me that you were very mean to his owner and wouldn't confirm any good boys and girls as judges until he left. New guy doesn't even have a friend to bork with me. Don't be so mean Dean.
Oh heck, this doggo isn't having a good time. Would much rather be zooming in a national park, sniffing all the pointy red things and crunchy green things. Retweet to let the woofer have a walk. #BearsEars #grandstaircase #Resist https://t.co/l8J6Tp2uR0
When a momma dog has puppers, she shouldn't have to worry about going back to work right after just to afford treats. America is one of the few developed nations that doesn't ensure paid parental leave. This must change. #feminism #paidleave
When all dogs stand together, white doggos, brown doggos, black doggos, big doggos, small doggos, good boys, good girls, doggos with pups, bomb sniffing doggos, and good old woofers, we win. Do not let hoomans divide us up #solidarity #dog #doggo #woofer #ourrevolution
We must bork for those who cannot bork for themselves. Only when pups and hoomans stand and sit together will things get better for all. #berniesanders #ourrevolution #doggo #dog
