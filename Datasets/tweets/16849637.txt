@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales I also now look forward to using Notion to assess its suitability for my purposes and providing relevant feedback.		What I am also really interested in is the short, medium and long term roadmap for Notion and your system of handling, saving and protecting user data.		Thank you.
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales Just letting you know that I have just responded to an email from Lillie on some of my concerns. Other concerns expressed in later tweets have not all been answered in the email. I thank you for your responses to date.
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales The Notion Help link opens in Chrome on my Android phone by default even when I have another browser set as default AND even when I have signed in with a non Google email account and a temporary password. That's simply not acceptable!
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales And should I be able to open the Help guides on my Android phone in a mobile browser of choice rather than it opening in Chrome by default?
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales Thank you.
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales So on the Android Notion app which I signed into with Google I don't have a default browser set (by choice) but when I click on a Notion link Chrome opens by default. I  don't like that and I don't want it. All the more reason I want a password option that I control!

@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales By the way, is not signing out more secure than staying signed in across browsing sessions? Only I then have to deal with a temporary password EVERY time I login in! And what if I want to sign in on a public computer? PLENTY of sites provide secure sign in using passwords!
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales Further, I object to being forced to sign in using another service, i.e. Google, one that has a less than stellar record regarding user privacy.		So, possibly regretably, although that remains to be seen, I'll not be returning to Notion under the present arrangements.
Is that password link you included in your reply part of a help or support document/page on your website? Or are you only sending out helpful links if users ask? https://t.co/u54zRM4B4d
@NotionHQ @FrancescoD_Ales Sorry, but I don't regard just being able to sign in using Google as being necessarily more secure. Further, may I suggest putting up an FAQ. I'm sure there are plenty of questions you have been asked that other users could benefit from.
