Every time I see some white person posting on Twitter that Bernie isn’t a Democrat, I am more attracted to the VT senator. https://t.co/QkCK8gMZHS
I want to say one more thing: Hillary didn’t help in bringing progressive policies, and, instead, decried them, scoffed at them and went full centrist.  And that’s why she lost. It’s why I will fully support Bernie for his 2020 Presidential bid.
... since, Gallup recently found that Democrats now view socialism more favorably than they do capitalism. However, given Republicans' low positive ratings of socialism, Americans overall remain negative in their views of socialism.”
Also from the Gallup study, Bernie’s given credit for the advancement in progressive ideas flourishing into mainstream Democratic campaigns: “After Sanders' advocacy of progressive views on the campaign trail and in the two years...
When digging further into Bernie’s strong support, you’ll find that he has a favorability rate among the age groups 18-34 and 35-54 that’s about 59%ish. Gallup makes sure to make readers aware that his favorability rate is mixed when looking beyond said two age groups.
But next,  let me start challenging the centrist idea that Bernie supporters are mostly white and men. Take this Gallup survey, for example. 		(Link for the screenshot:https://t.co/hBGpCU7Buj) https://t.co/MPPlo4XrAQ
I am mixed with Native Mexican and Spanish blood. Possibly, I could as have some other European blood aside from Spanish.
Want to clarify one thing about myself: On my bio for this social media platform, I wrote that I am “Hispanic”. That’s true. But for further inquiry into what exactly is my ethnicity, I am Mexican-American, and proudly so. 		Specifically, I am Mesitzo, which means that...
My group of ten friends does not fit that description. 6 in of 10 us are persons of color, are not men, and do support women’s rights. 		Make mention of Hillary Clinton and yawns, criticism, and laughter are easily evokes at our table.
First off, I keep hearing Hillary supporters cry that Bernie supporters are mostly white and are men. 		Let me start with an anecdote: My group of ten friends do not fit that description. 6 in to of us are persons of color, are not men, and do support women’s rights.
Going to rant about two things: Bernie’s popularity with nonwhites and his boost of progressive policies.

@ajbandyk @Stizmaster @laurelcanyon @jbarro I mean Bernie was the chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee and is currently the Ranking member of Senate Budget Committee, has voted for Schumer to lead Senate Dems.

I voted only because of Bernie. He is why I am a Democrat — that and the GOP sucks, and, really, constantly tries to get rid of my Latino people.
I know this feeling. 		When Bernie beseeched us to to vote for Hillary — who I detest — I did. As did other Bernie supporters. Also, I voted Democrat in the ‘18 November midterms (though I had really hoped the progressive candidates had won their primaries). https://t.co/hIrY4kFeCX

Truly is saddening that most of my millennial friends disdain politics or reference to it. Sad. I need some more exciting friends.
@MalcolmNance @charliekirk11 I’m usually dismissive of articles pertaining to mention of Kirk. He’s not relevant to me, to my fellow millennial friends. So it’s best you not try to know him — you’ll just be scratching your head if you do.
I'm making my stance on the 2020 Presidential Election unambiguous.  I support Bernie, though if he's not the top candidate for the Democratic nomination for President, I will vote for who wins it. All I want is Trump out of office, which a lot of people want as well.

About nearly two decades in high ranks in Congress is enough to me. Time for a new fresh crew of Dem leadership. Especially with Chuck Schumer. And new progressive senators for VT. (Fucking love Bernie, so don't bash me) .

My message for those who feel that they vote is wasted, is that it's not. What it takes to make something happen is action, people, dedication,  optimism -- that means no bewailing that your vote is hopeless.  		Each and every vote is salubrious, no matter who you vote for.
I woke up early today. I got on the bus. I went to the government center in the County of Kings, CA. Finally, I voted at the election office.		This is more than a vote. This is my voice. The one that'll tell Trump's enablers in Congress that they work for the American people. https://t.co/qDiPiouwZn
I recommend this game to all new Nintendo Switch users who love an adventure, surprises, action, sad stories, dark history, and a good ol' fight with some anomalistic creatures. (Notation: I'm still not done. Could take me a while to get through the whole game.)
(2) Another thing that I find to enjoy in this game is that it has mythologies interwoven in its storyline though fictitious. 		(3) It teaches how to utilize anything and everything, ranging from seemingly useless tools found on ground to the most powerful of weapons.
(1) The graphics in the Switch game supersedes my disdain for 3ds versions.
This is an apolitical post. It is an analysis of a game. Opinion is mine.		I've been playing The Legend Of Zelda Breath of The Wild for the past few days. Admittedly, it's my first-ever Zelda game and hunting/survival genre. I'm not going to lie, it's beyond my expectations:

I pain for my mother. The agonies that she endures because of the woes bestowed unto her by my father and little brother. 😭😭😭🙁		No person should go through this. Nobody at all.
How can I be related to someone whose personality is to automatically pin blame on our mother, when she does everything he requests of her? My little brother disappoints me in ways unimaginable, and, honestly,  I hate to say that of him. It's why there's discord between us two.
Love this riposte. https://t.co/esSZz8KJAs
Also, almost no media outlet assumed the shooter's political affiliation until after the shooter was  shot dead by police. That's a grave falsity that you're perpetuating on your own. And I as a sensible person will not stand for it.

Just a word of advice, Megyn: Have more cognizance of your history.  Then, it won't make you look as dumbfounded and nonsensical on live TV.
... segregation laws in force between the end of Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement — derives from an 1832 blackface minstrel number by Thomas D. Rice."
To quote @voxdotcom, 		"Beyond that, blackface and systematic social and political repression are so inextricably linked that, according to C. Vann Woodward's history The Strange Career of Jim Crow, the very term "Jim Crow" — usually used as shorthand for rigid anti-black...
The purpose for this was to image plantation slaves and free blacks, doing so, demonstrably, on stage and on television.  		And answering the third question: The historical context of blackface has to do with the many social and political challenges that African Americans had.
Answering the first question: Well it's black paint put on person's face for a costume. 		Answering the second question: Back in the early 19th century,  white actors put on black grease paint on their faces to make themselves appear as though they were a black person.
All that would need to be done is an easy typing-in of the word itself on the web. I did so.
Megyn Kelly seems not understand the history behind blackface. Clearly that's evidenced in her discussion  (basically in this video that I am sharung) for today.		So just what is blackface? Why is it offensive? And what historical context does it have?
Going to do a little thread about the topic "blackface". https://t.co/VwYl6OkGxe
