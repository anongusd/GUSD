Thank you. Thank you. It was truly a highlight of these few wild days. Much love 💗
I also saw self depreciation or apologizing for being “ugly” or pointing out specific things they didn’t like about their face. What the heck!!! That type of ownership is yours to wade but just know: you are beautiful - never apologize for it.
I loved seeing all your expressions. Moody or smiling or coy or fierce or whatever is YOU. What an incredible collection of folks owning themselves (I see you #validbisexual !!) where they are, how they are.
However! Scrolling through and seeing your faces brought so much emotion. Thank you for sharing yourselves with me. Thank you for your kind words; I’m happy you feel supported by me too.
It’s not an intention of mine for any fan to do anything for me - I’m not a cult leader. I’m living my life and if you’re into it, cool. If not, that’s cool too.
I want to talk about #selfiesforbrie -the hashtag I didn’t know I needed.

@filthykuffar @Orangwutang @ZMoneyBC @AndyYork8 But I'm not outraged. I'm just explaining what it's like to be a woman on a daily basis. We are objectified.
@ZMoneyBC @AndyYork8 Me? Why is this on me?
@JCAlvarado1 @CarolinaFresh94 @Femme_Mal @AndyYork8 @jenna_pr I'm gonna let you dudes chill with all the info I gave you and wish you the best of luck.
@RileyStarship Ok I look forward to your contributions to female empowerment! 👋 nice speaking with you
Exactly. https://t.co/zxvuBHSziV
@_caitlynmt This is why we must bond and create a network that cannot be stopped.
@RileyStarship I hope you take the time to learn more about the experiences of women. It's real + scary sometimes and people like you can make it better
@LouciferIII @nogillz Why do I need to be dragged?
@nogillz We are not playing a game of whos life is harder. We are discussing every day, casual harassment that invades our lives.
@RileyStarship You do realize you're blaming me for a situation I did not ask to be in? A situation that made me uncomfortable?
@RileyStarship Um. Yeah.
@taywiggs13 I'm sorry that happened to you.
@Mike2TheNyc Nope. He's working. He's at his job. Think of me as a customer at his job. It's inappropriate.
@marvelfan_est96 @spideyyobrien It is not your fault. I'm sorry that happened to you. I believe you.
@stephenmolella Thanks for taking the time to learn!
@VicDamone87 Thanks for looking twice. Maybe look through the comments too? Lots of women are speaking up about their experience.
@DBillz ?
@Saintt_Po I appreciate your willingness to grow.
Fourth: social media can broaden your world view. It can bring us together to learn. Don't miss this opportunity to grow in unexpected ways
Third: speak from a place of love. Remember that we are (hopefully) just trying to make the world a safer place for all.
Second: ask questions. If you don't understand, believe in us enough to learn more. This can be challenging if our perspectives differ.
First step: listen. I don't need you explain why my experience is invalid. I need you to listen because I am not a liar and I have a soul.
My recent tweets were an invitation to hear my experience as a woman. Are you up to learning something that may challenge your current view?
@Missy314 @MrHooiserDaddy I'm talking about a man who works in security. I was walking through security. It's inappropriate.
@venomlace Thank you for that!
@JCAlvarado1 @AndyYork8 I am being fair.
@CosmicAmericana It's ok! I'm sorry to hear about the hardships in your life. We both want the same thing. To feel safe in the world. To feel understood.
@CosmicAmericana Its important for us as a planet to discuss these moments that make us feel uncomfortable so we may work to make the world safer for all.
@CosmicAmericana Small moments of harassment that are left without reprimand lead to bigger moments.
@CosmicAmericana I'm sorry that happened to you and your family. It's not your fault.
@pablovr81 Yes. When I'm a person going through security, and the other is an employee of said security. It's inappropriate.
@annetdonahue Thank you for sharing your experience. It takes bravery.
@CosmicAmericana Go for it
@AndyYork8 What you are saying is "I was asking for it"  - a phrase that has disregarded a females experience for....the whole time.
@CosmicAmericana You have much to learn if you think you know it all already.
@JEllenScott That makes me so sad. You deserve to hike as you please safely!
@CosmicAmericana I'm inviting you to listen to my experience as a woman. Are you up to learning something that may challenge your current view?
This. https://t.co/DRwtaB3yZr
As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you.
I merely smiled at a TSA agent and he asked for my phone number. To live life as a woman is to live life on the defense.
