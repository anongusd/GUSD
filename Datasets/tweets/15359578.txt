When CNBC reported on the RNC paying Trump Tower rent and Pence's nephew's salary last year, the RNC quietly stopped paying them. But the money to Schiller never stopped. 		If it continues for Trump's 1st term, Schiller stands to make $585,000 in GOP donors' money.
@ndejde @VP yep, same one.
33 days after Schiller went on the RNC's payroll, he told House Intel that he/Trump  "declined" the offer of prostitutes in Moscow in 2013, and that he didn't recall any contact btwn the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016. 		In that 33 days, RNC paid him $30,000.
Schiller's payment is the last remaining contract left from 3 unusual expenses the RNC started paying in fall of 2017. One was rent at Trump Tower, one was Mike Pence's nephew's salary, and the 3rd was $15,000 a month to Trump's former bodyguard.
Last year, the RNC told CNBC that Schiller had been hired to consult on a site for the 2020 GOP convention. That process ended in July, but Schiller is still making $15,000 from the RNC.

Two things jump out here: 		1. Sanders will not affirm that Trump supports House's action against King. (It would've been easier for her to just say 'yes.')		2. Sanders implies that Rep. Tlaib's use of a curse word is somehow comparable to King's defense of white supremacy. https://t.co/P5AU0WLt3s
Q: Does Trump support the condemnation of Steve King? 		@PressSec: "Steve King’s comments were abhorrent and the GOP leadership, unlike Democrats, have actually taken action when their members have said outrageous and inappropriate things."		Hmmmm.

It’s 277 pages, but the most relevant section, the court’s opinion of Wilbur Ross’ motives and actions, begins on page 207.

Unclear to me how senators objecting to Trump’s plan to ease sanctions on 3 Russian behemoths linked to Putin ally Oleg Deripaska is a vote “for the Kremlin.” The Kremlin desperately wants these sanctions lifted. https://t.co/Hiv72oXFDW
Treasury Sec @stevenmnuchin1 heads to Capitol Hill for GOP Senate lunch today. He’ll tell senators that a vote to disapprove of Trump’s plan to ease sanctions on 3 Russian companies linked to oligarch Oleg Deripaska is a "vote for the Kremlin, China and Iran,” via @playbookplus.

.@SteveEder’s reporting adds a new layer to the story of Trump’s complex relationship w the military. 		After campaigning as a champion of vets and soldiers, Trump has ignored the counsel of his generals, let his friends secretly run the VA, and avoided visiting a war zone. https://t.co/Dz3w3JQBSP
Great work by @SteveEder.
What the podiatrist got in return for diagnosing Donald Trump w bone spurs “was access to Fred Trump,” his daughter said. “If there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and Trump would take care of it immediately.” https://t.co/Dz3w3JQBSP

My favorite Mattis story: Christmas Day 1998. Brigadier General Mattis learned that a young Marine on watch duty that day had a wife and little kids. So Mattis volunteered to take his place, and spent the day manning a guard gate at Quantico so the Marine could be w his family.

@spdustin You're not crazy. Thanks for the note.
@spdustin @TrumpsAlert Yes, it's startling to see such patently false information on the president's feed. The falsehood was  widely reported on yesterday, but so far the WH has not answered questions about it. Without more information, there's little more to say. It's false, and yet it's still there.
@spdustin @TrumpsAlert I don't know the answer to that. My educated guess would that it's their own photo. WH staff usually take a lot of pictures at events. And given the intense scrutiny of his Twitter account, I think a lifted, copyrighted image would be pretty quickly identified by the press corps.
Tonight's crowd in Indiana was much more to Trump's liking than last week's crowd in West Va. 		So much so, in fact, that Trump just made a photo from tonight's rally the banner on his personal twitter account. h/t: @TrumpsAlert https://t.co/jKK9QtGMHo

Noteworthy: These arrests were for the crime of spying on the MEK, an extremist group U.S. listed as foreign terrorist org until 2012.

Sarah Sanders says efforts to call Trump's translator to testify before Congress "would have to go through the States Department." 		That's a surprisingly squishy answer.  Sanders could have shut that question down quickly by saying this would never happen. She didn't.

That Trump’s best meeting all week was with Vladimir Putin is precisely the way it is being reported. https://t.co/Yn0dLMrGnw
@sam_patten The closest we can come to hearing what really happened is to hear what Trump says to a friendly interviewer like Hannity, whom he feels is a sympathetic audience. Trump thought he was defensing himself here, not necessarily revealing anything.
For Putin to tell Trump that his inability to "make a deal" (Trump's ultimate measure of success) in Helsinki was because the Mueller probe tied Trump's hands managed to 1) Exploit Trump's fear of failure 2) feed his grievance about Mueller and 3) absolve Trump of responsibility. https://t.co/Phzf71DToS
Negotiating 101: Make your opponent think you empathize with them, then suggest that whatever it is you want them to do (e.g., end the Mueller probe) is the only thing standing between them and success.
Trump describes here how Putin fed his sense of injustice over the Mueller probe, suggesting to him that they might have been able to accomplish something at this summit, were it not for this pesky investigation. Telling, I think. https://t.co/Phzf71DToS
Trump: Putin said to me, "'What a shame.' He felt it was very hard for me to make a deal because you know, all of this nonsense [with the special counsel]. You have many other people, you look at Flynn, it's a shame... Paul Manafort, who clearly is a nice man..." via @seanhannity
Trump to Hannity: "I know president Obama has said that global warming is our biggest problem, and I would say that no, nuclear warming is our biggest problem by a factor of about 5 million."
