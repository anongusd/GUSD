Planned Parenthood is proud to serve 41% of the 4 million people who rely on Title X health centers. We will always be here for our patients. We will fight this rule with everything we have.
The Trump-Pence administration knows what it’s doing. In a country where racism and discrimination have caused rampant inequities and disparities, an attack on Title X – a program for patients with low incomes – is an attack on poor women and people of color.
Title X is the only national grant program dedicated to providing family planning for low-income women and families. It helps people get testing for STDs, helps prevents cancer, and empowers people to make the best health choices for themselves.
I took an oath to do everything I can to help my patients, and I must be able to speak freely and honestly with them. Silencing doctors’ abilities to speak with our patients compromises our ethical obligation. Politicians have no place in the exam room.
Abortion care is standard medical health care. 1 in 4 American women will have an abortion in their lifetimes. It is part of the full spectrum of reproductive health care, which is health care.
This “gag rule” will prohibit providers from referring women for legal, evidence-based reproductive health choices.

It’s about two things: 1) We have to provide care and services to people where they are. 2) We have to fight to provide access to that care.		Those two parts go hand in hand, because we need to stand up for how reproductive healthcare is part of the full spectrum of healthcare.
There are so many people who are restricting access to care. In the last 7 years, there have been more than over 400 laws passed that directly restrict abortion access. #AM2DM

That’s exciting. And it in no way means we are backing down from fighting for abortion access or from the important political work our advocacy organizations do.
Tomorrow I kick off a tour of 20 affiliate in five months where I plan to highlight the ways Planned Parenthood is already doing this in communities across the country, and look for ways we can expand even further.
For many of our patients, we are their primary source of health care. That’s why we will continue to look for ways of expanding what we offer them, so we can treat the whole patient.
Our advocacy work is crucial to delivering on our mission. The 2018 midterms, including the record number of women and the historic pro-reproductive health majority elected to House, prove that Planned Parenthood continues to be a powerful political force across the country.
There have been more than 400 abortion restrictions included in the states since 2011. Serving our patients MUST include fighting those restrictions in legislatures and at the ballot box.
First, our core mission is providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care. We will never back down from that fight - it’s a fundamental human right and women’s lives are at stake.

For more than 100 years, Planned Parenthood has revolutionized health care with passion and tenacity. Now, we are unleashing that determination on improving fair workplace policies and cultures for the people that deliver our care. https://t.co/Jk6SbXFOOa
@PPFA All people deserve emotional and material security for themselves and their families, no matter where they work. So @PPFA is stepping up. We will continue to work with partners to fight for laws to establish paid family leave and provide workers with the support they need.
@PPFA We are launching a major new initiative to review and revamp our parental leave policies. From policy solutions to structural ones, we will invite experts to participate in a solutions-driven process. We’ll use those results to find pathways for expanding leave benefits.
@PPFA But @PPFA has always been about striving to do better. And that is why, going forward, I believe we must do better than we are now—for our staff, for their families, and for our patients.
@PPFA As both a former patient and the new leader of @PPFA, I am well aware of the exemplary work of our 55 affiliates around the country. Our skilled, dedicated staff deliver quality health care every day to thousands of American families under extremely difficult conditions.
@PPFA Daily political attacks have created widespread financial uncertainty, but we strive to meet the needs of our staff who must be supported as they provide expert health care and education to patients who depend on Planned Parenthood health centers every day.
@PPFA I’m a new mother to a one-year old boy, and I know how challenging pregnancy and returning to work can be — and how essential it is that employers and all sectors of society support pregnant people and new parents.
@PPFA At @PPFA, we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. When we learn about accusations that violate our policies and high standards, we move immediately to investigate and address them, as we are doing in this instance.
Reproductive health equity must include the right to become a parent and raise a family free from fear and discrimination. At @PPFA, we’re committed to doing better to support our pregnant and parenting staff. https://t.co/7g4gr1R697

Healthcare is a human right, and no person should have to choose between getting the healthcare they need and staying with their family.
If this rule goes into effect, nearly one million immigrants in the U.S. would be harmed. That's one million people whose health and safety would be put in jeopardy.		As a public health expert,	as an immigrant,	as a person,		I strongly condemn this rule. #ProtectFamilies
But I can tell you: had we been forced to choose between that care and our future in the U.S., we would’ve chosen the latter. It's unconscionable families may soon be forced to make that choice because of the “public charge” rule. #ProtectFamilies	https://t.co/TMKQNal6Wg

1 in 7 people who have HIV don’t know it – which means that they are unable to get treatment and take preventive measures. Among people ages 13-24 with HIV, an estimated 51% didn’t know their status. #WorldAIDSDay
#WorldAIDSDay is the opportunity to show solidarity with millions of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS in the US and around the world. This year’s #WorldsAIDSDay theme is #KnowYourStatus. Here’s why it’s important:

Thank you to @NewDEALLeaders for being my partners &amp; fellow warriors as we fight for health, social justice &amp; the future of our country. The arc of the moral universe bends towards justice, but it doesn’t get there on its own. We have to fight with everything we have #NewDEALers
An attack on one aspect of women’s health influences every aspect of women’s health. Overwhelmingly, people of all political persuasions say that they do not want politicians to be in the exam room, making personal medical decisions for patients. #ThisIsHealthcare @NewDEALLeaders https://t.co/OhfOH7SaVu
@PPFA health centers serve over 40% of patients who receive care through Title X. And for many of our patients, we are their only source of healthcare. #ThisIsHealthcare @NewDEALLeaders #NewDEALers
There is no greater threat facing #publichealth than the threat to women’s health. There are 15 cases involving abortion that are one step away from the Supreme Court. 25 million women could be living in states where abortion is outlawed &amp; criminalized @NewDEALLeaders #NewDEALers
Watching the midterm election results come in, as an immigrant, a woman &amp; a mother, and seeing race after race called for immigrants, women, moms, people of color, young people, &amp; LGBTQ people... it’s hard to describe how I felt.

Public health’s voice, advocacy &amp; fight — it’s more important now than ever. We will win because standing up for public health - for the public’s health - means that we are on the right side of history. It’s the role of public health to lead the way. #BloombergHealthSummit
Ensuring that everyone has quality, affordable healthcare as a right, and not a privilege, shouldn’t be political. But if others have made healthcare political, #publichealth needs to fight back with everything we have. #ThisisHealthcare #BloombergHealthSummit
#publichealth can convene all sectors and set a North Star. In #Baltimore, @BmoreforBabies reduced infant mortality citywide by nearly 40% &amp; cut the disparity btwn black &amp; white infant mortality by over 50% #BloombergHealthSummit

That's it! Follow these simple practices and you'll be well on your way to a happy, healthy holiday. Wishing you a relaxing and restorative day.
Finally, keep hot food hot and cold food cold. When in doubt, just throw it out.
If you are transporting food, keep uncooked meats in tightly sealed bags or containers, with plenty of ice and separate from other foods.
Second, keep raw food separate from cooked food. Don’t use the same plate and utensils for cooked food that were used for raw food and always check the inside of food to make sure it’s done.
First, remember to keep it clean. Clean your hands before preparing or touching food and make sure the surface that you are using is clean.

Three: Expand our services, care, and impact. As an emergency physician, I saw firsthand what happens when health centers shut down, when people must choose between paying for blood tests or electric bills. These are decisions no one should be forced to make.
Two: Protect access to that care. Last week, voters sent a strong message: reproductive health care and women’s health care are MAINSTREAM health care. And health care is a human right. We aren’t going to stop fighting until that’s a reality for every last one of us.
My vision for Planned Parenthood is simple. One: continue to provide expert health care and education to ALL people. That means everyone  –people of color, young people, people with low incomes, the LGBTQ community, the undocumented and immigrants.

We need your help - spread the word to go to your pharmacy and get #Naloxone to carry.
I issued a blanket prescription to every resident in our city. You can go to any pharmacy in the city, and say “I would like #Naloxone.” https://t.co/LOaWp4athV
If you don’t need your medications, dispose of them. https://t.co/Mk4IjT9ZV8

The problem is that every kit that we buy is $75. That’s the discounted price. If we were to buy #Narcan for every resident it would cost about $47 million. https://t.co/NhpgyNb9y3
All of the kits that we give out have 2 doses of #Naloxone because of the strength of fentanyl. https://t.co/vwDkm0KgeG
Now you know how easy it is and why we strongly believe that every resident in our city needs to carry #Naloxone. Every day residents in Baltimore have saved the lives of more than 2,600 residents. https://t.co/ok9qYDWCRt

Glad to be with @ASlavitt and many others to talk about the willful sabotage of the #ACA by Trump. We have to protect the #ACA and access to affordable, quality health insurance #TrumpSabotage @BMore_Healthy
We strongly believe that is a fundamental human right. The action by the Trump Administration to undermine the #ACA and to willfully increase the number of uninsured people is bad for health, it’s bad for the economy, and it’s immoral and unlawful #TrumpSabotage
For us in #Baltimore, we will never waver in our commitment to provide care to our most vulnerable residents #TrumpSabotage #ACA
Let’s consider infectious diseases — TB, HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, the flu. All of these rates could climb if the number of uninsured increases and people stop receiving timely, affordable care #TrumpSabotage #ACA
What sense does it make to take away people’s ability to get treatment for the disease of #addiction in the middle of a #publichealth emergency? #TrumpSabotage
We are in the midst of an epidemic of #opioid deaths. The number of people dying from #fentanyl in #Baltimore has climbed from 12 in 2013 to 573 in 2017 — a 5000% increase in 4 years. We see this same trend across the US #TrumpSabotage
We are talking about people’s health and economic futures. We’re talking about the community’s health @BMore_Healthy #TrumpSabotage
I’ve treated a 32-year old construction worker who waited a week before having a leg wound looked at. What could’ve been cured with oral antibiotics resulted in a leg amputation, and the end of his livelihood #TrumpSabotage
Instead, my patient died soon after I saw her, leaving behind three children #TrumpSabotage
I’ve treated a 48-year old teacher’s aide who waited a year before having her breast lump examined. Her cancer could’ve been detected earlier, and even prevented, if she had insurance #TrumpSabotage #ACA
Then there’s the human cost. I’m an ER physician, and I have seen what happens when people delay care because they simply can’t afford it @BMore_Healthy #TrumpSabotage #ACA
An increase in the uninsured rate will impose burdens on each of these programs, and require more city funding #TrumpSabotage #ACA
.@BMore_Healthy also assists w/ a Men’s Health Center, and runs programs for pregnant women and children #TrumpSabotage #ACA
This includes a visiting nurse program w/ house calls for patients w/ chronic medical conditions, and programs focused on reducing #asthma and childhood lead poisoning #TrumpSabotage
.@BMore_Healthy also provides and subsidizes other health services for our uninsured &amp; underinsured patients #TrumpSabotage
Do we cut #HIV/#AIDS treatment? Dental and oral care? Hypertension detection? Cancer screenings? @BMore_Healthy #TrumpSabotage
Do we cut #opioid addiction treatment — in the middle of a #publichealth emergency? #TrumpSabotage
But what services do we cut? Reproductive healthcare — which is already being threatened as a result of the Trump Administration’s proposed Title X changes? #TrumpSabotage
It will make us either incur additional costs, or force us to reduce our ability to care for the most vulnerable @BMore_Healthy #TrumpSabotage
.@BMore_Healthy already operates on a shoestring budget, and further increases in the uninsured rate will place an even greater burden on programs already short on resources  #TrumpSabotage #ACA
Destabilizing the #ACA directly affects the demand on @BMore_Healthy’s services. We operate clinics that are a safety net for uninsured &amp; underinsured #Baltimoreans #TrumpSabotage
Here in #Baltimore City, over 10K of our residents are enrolled in plans purchased through the health insurance marketplace. Destabilizing the #ACA could mean that 10K people will become uninsured #TrumpSabotage
I am joining our colleagues across the country to express my deep concern about the consequences of sabotaging the #ACA #TrumpSabotage
“The #ACA was working for millions and millions of Americans, and insurance rates were stable for the most part. The uninsured rate had dropped nearly in half — 20 mil more people have been covered. But Trump has taken steps to destabilize the market” — @ASlavitt #TrumpSabotage

This makes no sense to me, as doctor and public health leader. If the goal is to reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce abortions, why would you take away funding for family planning/evidence-based contraception? #TitleX https://t.co/hO4dhOVlbJ
The gains in health outcomes that we have worked so hard to achieve could be rolled back overnight. Many safety clinics will be forced to close their doors, just because they are associated with orgs that provide abortions #TitleX
#TitleX funding has also supported clinics to provide vital services like cervical cancer testing, mental health screenings, HIV counseling, &amp; specialist referrals that many residents otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford https://t.co/r9W6EfUFcV

I am pleased that under @MayorPugh50’s leadership, we have brought the Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors #TIPS to #Baltimore City
National data indicates that #TIPS participants in other sites have reduced their ER visits and hospitalizations by 35%. @BMore_Healthy hopes to replicate these results here in #Baltimore
The Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors helps @BMore_Healthy catch potential life-threatening developments early on. The goal is to keep seniors out of ERs and to stay healthy and live active lifestyles at home #TIPS https://t.co/HGfLOKoaLD
Chronic conditions like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes are the leading causes of hospitalization and death in #Baltimore and across the country #TIPS
The Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors is a simple program, but it makes a big difference #TIPS
Since the launch of the Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors in mid-April, nearly 100 people come to Zeta Center every week to check up on their health and stay out of hospitals @BMore_Healthy #TIPS https://t.co/ZS4vTMWDpn
We follow-up with individuals to see if they are making progress, and importantly, we track their health indicators to make sure their health is improving #TIPS
We can provide education on diet for heart disease and diabetes, for example. If a participant needs help w/ accessing social services and benefits, we help link them up to those services and assist w/ completing eligibility forms #TIPS https://t.co/Ib9FKzyKJ4
Depending on the results, we may link people to a healthcare provider, or we may provide health education on how to manage their chronic conditions @BMore_Healthy #TIPS
The clinical staff from @MedStarHealth provides remote nurse monitoring to check vital signs like blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. This info is monitored, tracked, and uploaded to the hospital’s system #TIPS https://t.co/EzYdJBuiRG
How #TIPS works: We meet people where they are, where they feel at home, like the Zeta Center @BMore_Healthy
As @MayorPugh50 mentioned, #TIPS is a high tech, high touch program that uses wireless technology to monitor vital signs for low-income older adults w/ high health risks @BMore_Healthy https://t.co/wzA4gA0Psc

I want to thank @BMore_Healthy’s partners who made #TIPS possible, incl our host site, the Zeta Center for Healthy and Active Living and our first TIPS site in #Baltimore
Second, the Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors (#TIPS) also focuses on prevention: Not waiting until someone needs to be hospitalized or use the ER, but treating illnesses early and preventing them in the first place @BMore_Healthy https://t.co/T0iZn8ZtN7
The Telehealth Intervention Program for Seniors (#TIPS) exemplifies two core principles of public health: First, TIPS goes to where people are, bringing healthcare out of hospitals &amp; into our communities https://t.co/4O3qidGzw8

This must be our mantra and the first thing we keep in mind — we cannot wait. We cannot wait for others to deliver for us. We have to be the people who step up first @WeAreUnidosUS #unidosus18 https://t.co/h2sSa1Yv9t
Our most recent data show that everyday residents have used #naloxone to save 2,375 of their fellow residents — family, friends, fellow human beings #UnidosUS18 @WeAreUnidosUS
We began #naloxone trainings in markets, churches, street corners. We mapped out where overdoses were occurring to do outreach in real time. We’ve started a #stabilizationcenter, a 24/7 ER for #addiction and mental health @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/t9cgvxObfd
We quickly discovered, though, that changing policy is necessary but not sufficient, unless we provide services to meet people where they are @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/nrqEQxiEar
In #Baltimore, we got legislation passed such that in Oct 2015, I issued a standing order — a blanket prescription — for the #opioid antidote naloxone to all 620K residents @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18
There are injustices and inequities everywhere we look — but as advocates and activists, we cannot accept the status quo. Inaction is not an option @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/ykIh8W6kXj
There is shame, fear, and stigma surrounding addiction and mental illness @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/GDMsqHP9lO
Science is unequivocal that #addiction is a disease and treatment exists. Yet, nationwide, only 1 in 10 people with addiction get the help that they need. For what other disease would we find this acceptable? @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/2cGs0qWCGU
#Baltimore is also in the middle of an #opioid epidemic. Last year, over 700 people died from overdose. #Addiction affects every aspect of our community @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/G1X98x6NLL
I’m the @BMore_Healthy Commissioner — in #Baltimore, there can be as much as a 20 year difference in life expectancy from neighborhood to neighborhood @WeAreUnidosUS #UnidosUS18 https://t.co/BjUD6UVyPW

RT @BMore_Healthy: “In Baltimore, teen birth rates have declined 61% between 2000 and 2016.” #TitleX @DrLeanaWen @MiddayWYPR

Speaking the truth is hard. Doing what’s right is hard. @OSIBaltimore does not shy away from doing these hard things #BoldThinker #OSI20th
We must speak the truth that there are entire generations of black and brown people to whom we owe an apology. We must speak the truth that just as poverty &amp; violence are #publichealth issues, racism is a public health issue @OSIBaltimore #OSI20th #BoldThinker https://t.co/RkbzhXgMCT
We cannot begin addressing this issue unless we are honest and speak the truth about the structural racism and the deep-seated inequities that got us to where we are @OSIBaltimore #OSI20th #BoldThinker
Now that #addiction affects white, affluent communities, it’s called a disease. We need for more treatment for this disease — and this understanding is long overdue @OSIBaltimore #BoldThinker #OSI20th
Even as we’ve made great strides, we have a lot more work to do. When #addiction affected poor minorities in inner cities, it was seen as a choice, a moral failing. If they ended up incarcerated or dead, it was their fault @OSIBaltimore #BoldThinker #OSI20th https://t.co/TFip0ZpW4J

2.5 years ago, when I issued the blanket prescription for #naloxone, I got comments like, “wouldn’t that just make people use more drugs?” We would never say that to someone who has an allergic reaction — “sorry, no Epi-Pen because it’ll make you eat more peanuts” @OSIBaltimore https://t.co/e69iY9PY1Y

But there is no room in public health for pessimists. There is no room in public health for passive observers @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/LoUdbngajJ
Despite many requests, we received no explanation for the cut — though you might hazard your best guess. Our staff were outraged, shocked, and discouraged @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018
The cut to our teen pregnancy prevention program was a $3.5 million reduction that would elim evidence-based, science-based repro health edu curriculum for 20K middle and high school students @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018
Last July, #Baltimore City rec’d notice that our 5-year grant from HHS for teen pregnancy prevention would be cut two years short @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/YdTFfvanpD
You need to be the motivator. You need to make the necessary work of health visible. But you will face setbacks along the way @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/PSNxrCYF2G
You have to put the face on public health. It would be nice if good research and running great programs is enough to convince policymakers — it’s not. As @SenatorBarb says, “Data validate, they don’t motivate” @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018
You need to be the constant voice that talks about how eliminating preparedness means uncontrolled outbreaks. How cutting #Medicaid has devastating impacts for women, children, and generations yet to come @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/9rU4XB5iPl
It’s been said that #publichealth works best when we’re invisible — but if we are invisible, nobody else will make the case for us. Then what happens? When it comes to decide the budget, public health will be the first item on the chopping block @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/6VP8z2TNpI
What about going further upstream? 2 years ago, @BMore_Healthy launched a program to provide vision screenings for every child in #Baltimore. For all kids who need them, we get them free glasses right in their schools. We meet them where they are @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/tSUQkNetRc
They are not seeing the science that violence spreads like a contagious disease; that interventions like @SafeStreetsBalt work to mediate thousands of conflicts that otherwise would’ve resulted in shootings @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/DPZphYDM0o
Nowadays, there are those who tell us that doctors shouldn’t be involved in violence prevention. Really? They haven’t treated patients in the ER to see how gun violence is undeniably a health issue @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/pjDOLR5Jvl
How many millions of lives are saved because doctors, scientists, and advocates took on those industries and refused to be silenced? @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/DClanFyd2b
There are those who told our predecessors that they shouldn’t dare take on the tobacco industry or that public health has no role in auto safety or environ regulation @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/okBMHUL3UD
My second piece of advice: Dont let others tell you what doctors can or cannot do @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/mpcr8knqg6
Be the person who steps up first. Find what you can do and do it now @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018
We have to start somewhere, because there will be something we can do right now. Don’t wait until you have the perfect job or the ideal title— don’t just study the problem. We have admired them for long enough @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/SStWTkOLnH
But while we wait for societal change, how many more people will die in front of us? We have to save lives today for there to be a chance for a better tomorrow. In public health, the problems we face are overwhelming @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/3mvHH6KDem
We have to do much more to address the social determinants that fuel ill health and despair, like poverty, unemployment, and homelessness @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/Otrr2tRD6x
.@BMore_Healthy is working towards long-term solutions by starting a stabilization center (a 24/7 “ER” for addiction and behavioral health issues) and changing our crim justice system to treat rather than incarcerate @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/r5dZSp1O0M
There are some who have criticized my #naloxone program by saying that it’s only a short-term fix to the complex problem of addiction. They are right — we need to work towards long-term solutions @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018
My first piece of advice is Don’t Wait — don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/pCt7PUAvyM
In 2.5 years, @BMore_Healthy has conducted over 36K trainings. Our most recent data show that everyday residents have saved 2,072 lives @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/2juvnHKo6S
.@BMore_Healthy began #naloxone training in markets, churches, street corners. We mapped ODs occurring to do outreach in real time. We hired people in recovery themselves @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/u4cAVzOzMx
We quickly discovered though that changing policy is necessary but not sufficient, unless we provide services to meet people where they are @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/Xc7rolNbDS
In #Baltimore, we got legislation passed such that in Oct 2015, I issued a standing order — a blanket prescription — for the #opioid antidote, naloxone, to all 620K city residents @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/IdVvDJEdKM
There are injustices and inequities everywhere we look. But as doctors and future doctors, we don’t just accept the stake quo. For docs and advocates, inaction is never an option @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/TyIN5veJzm
Nationwide, only 1 in 10 people with addiction get the help that they need. For what other disease would we find this acceptable? Would we say, sorry you have cancer, but only 1 in 10 get chemo? @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/NiKgF0CQMX
Last year in #Baltimore, over 700 people died of overdose. Addiction affects every aspect of our community. Science is unequivocal that #addiction is a disease, treatment exists, and recovery is possible @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/nRWM6xr44n
.@RepCummings often says that we can’t just talk about the cost of an intervention, but also the cost of doing nothing @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/urkAQFJEZF
While there were attacks on #Medicaid and the #ACA during my pregnancy, all I could think about were women who were less fortunate and had to face trade-offs btw getting pre-natal care and paying for rent/food @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/Rm7DFZj0FI
These are challenging times that we live in — we face a lot of assaults on our values. We’ve seen the work @Drsforamerica did to make the #ACA a reality. Now there are threats to the #ACA #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/fuRW323gWo
Right here in #Baltimore, we see 20 year differences in life expectancies btw diff neighborhoods @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/pQjKBTQdeQ
We can’t be satisfied with the status quo. Addressing individual medical need is insufficient when we want to be “society’s doctor” @Drsforamerica #DFANLC2018 https://t.co/BJesurqKQ4

A couple of weeks ago @RepCummings &amp; @SenWarren introduced the CARE Act - this would provide local jurisdictions like ours the resources to effectively combat the #opioid crisis. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Since 2000, the teen birth rate in #BaltimoreCity has been reduced by 61% We cannot afford to roll back the gains we have made. For us, this is about protecting our youth. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
The judge ruled in our favor in our teen pregnancy prevention lawsuit. We will continue to fight because this is about 20,000 students who otherwise wouldn't have access to important evidence-based education. #Healthwatch	@MiddayWYPR
Please do not use synthetic marijuana. If you or someone you know has used it and shows symptoms including bleeding, go to the ER or call 911. If you know of a store selling synthetic marijuana, call 311. #Healthwatch	@MiddayWYPR
Synthetic marijuana is not marijuana at all.  These are chemicals manufactured in labs and sprayed on plants. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
It doesn't make sense that we have a life-saving medication available by the pennies in other countries, but we are having to ration it here because of the price. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Every day residents in our City have saved the lives of 2,000 individuals with #naloxone in the past two and half years. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Every #naloxone kits costs us $75. To get #naloxone to every resident would cost us $47 million. That is more than the City spends on the Health Department budget. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Locally we are rationing #naloxone every day. We count how many units we have left, and have to decide who goes without. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
All of the front line providers, we want to do the right thing but we need the resources to be able to do it. If we don't have resources at the hospital, what are we supposed to do when someone is seeking treatment for addiction? #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
I want to commend our hospitals for taking this step and their commitment to addressing addiction care. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Our hospitals are known nationwide for the care they provide. Nearly all 11 ERs offer Buprenorphine medication assisted treatment on demand. Nearly all offer peer recovery specialists.  #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR #LevelsofCare
.@MayorPugh50 and I brought together the leadership from all 11 of our hospitals, who have signed onto a voluntary certification for how they are approaching the #opioid crisis. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Addiction is a disease that needs to be seen the same as any other illness. Can you imagine a patient showing up to a hospital and them saying 'We don't treat diabetes here?' #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR

Physical inactivity also leads to other issues that are risks for heart disease - high blood pressure, etc.  #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR #HeartHealth
Tip 3: Watch what it is we are putting into our bodies.  #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Tip 2: Know your numbers and know your body. Go for regular checkups. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
Tip one to avoid heart disease. If you are smoking, stop. It's the #1 preventable contributor to heart disease. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
It's important for all of us to know the symptoms and to know our own bodies. If you know that you or a loved one feels like something isn't right, don't hesistate to ask for assistance &amp; call for help. #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR
A heart attack is when there are blockages in arteries in the heart, &amp; the muscle isn't functioning. Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops, which is one possible symptom of a heart attack.  #Healthwatch @MiddayWYPR

What’s more, not every baby gets the best possible start in life. In #Baltimore and across the country, African-American babies face a greater risk of being born prematurely or never making it to their first birthday @MarchofDimes #MarchForBabies https://t.co/CLdwSzvyRJ
Today, we are here to fight for babies. In this country and in our state, 1 in 10 babies are born prematurely #MarchForBabies @MarchofDimes @MarchForBabies https://t.co/KCc1J1z44x

The narrative that a lack of personal responsibility is to blame for negative outcomes in communities is related to an empathy gap in our country. We have a social responsibility to invest in our communities so that everyone can thrive. @NickKristof @CERCH_UMB #fairersociety
One of the reasons our policy interventions in attempting to break cycles of poverty were ineffective is that we often started too late. We used to think that children were endlessly resilient. We now know that’s not the case. @NickKristof @CERCH_UMB #fairersociety
Grateful for my friend @NickKristof and the work he is doing to build a just, healthy, and equitable society. At @BMore_Healthy we remain committed to working to achieve the same. @CERCH_UMB #fairersociety
The great Nelson Mandela said that there can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way it treats its children. We must do everything we can to protect our children, which includes ensuring safe housing, education and health. @NickKristof @CERCH_UMB #fairersociety
@BmoreforBabies has done and continues to do such important work. Since 2009, through our collective efforts, we have reduced infant mortality in Baltimore by nearly 40%. @CERCH_UMB @NickKristof #fairersociety https://t.co/IdqLfbJigr

Thank you to @MayorPugh50 and all of our hospitals #LevelsOfCare initiative @BMore_Healthy https://t.co/KvtTjZe4zr
Together, let’s build upon the work that’s already been done and make #Baltimore City a national model for treating #addiction alongside every other disease #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/dQS7Ocx4Sm
We will read every piece of feedback and finalize the #LevelsOfCare with our hospital partners this summer
We invite everyone to take a look at our proposed #LevelsOfCare and weigh in through our website: https://t.co/PugyCxXlh4
Today, we open up our proposed #LevelsOfCare to public comment. We want to hear from the public — from #addiction treatment providers, community groups, and from patients and families themselves https://t.co/gLAuhVCqUt
These #LevelsOfCare are being developed with active input from and in partnership w/ our hospitals
There are 3 #LevelsOfCare — the higher the level, the more comprehensive a hospital’s response, with Level 1 being the highest, then Levels 2 and 3
We will also be helping patients at risk for overdose get naloxone, and make sure that their doctors are prescribing #opioids judiciously so that we can end the cycle of #addiction &amp; overdose deaths #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/pm1n9S5y5e
The #LevelsOfCare articulate evidence-based best practices for treating #addiction and preventing #overdose, such as: Screening every hospital patient for addiction, offering treatment on-demand for those who screen positive
The #LevelsOfCare initiative is based on a similar initiative in Rhode Island, which is one of the few places where overdose deaths went down last year
Today we announce an initiative that builds on these achievements — the Levels of Care for #Baltimore City Hospitals Responding to the #Opioid Epidemic #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/dwq9gG35vO
Make no mistake that these are extraordinary achievements — we applaud our hospitals and celebrate them for stepping up and being such great partners #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/VEZEXna19N
To ensure that no patient slips through the cracks, our hospitals are screening each patient for substance use, providing any patient who screens positive w/ brief intervention and linkage to treatment #LevelsOfCare
These ERs also employ peer recovery specialists — people themselves in recovery from #addiction — to help patients navigate the resources they need #LevelsOfCare
Nearly all of our 11 EDs now offer Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) on demand for patients w #opioid addiction — that’s true of no other major city in America #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/sxe6a47qFl
Through @BMore_Healthy’s convenings, with the dedicated leadership of hospitals, and the expertise of the Mosaic Group, our City’s hospitals are changing the culture of medicine #LevelsOfCare
.@MayorPugh50 and I are proud that #Baltimore is leading the nation to provide evidence-based treatment for the disease of #addiction #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/Nq5YdYxU2C
We cannot stand by in the middle of an emergency, when we know that treatments work, and our only limitation is our ability to make treatment available #LevelsOfCare
Overdose is the leading cause of death among Americans under 50 — “we don’t do addiction treatment here” cannot be an option #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/q4LLc0lxtS
Despite this, in hospitals across America, the response to someone who needs addiction treatment is: “We don’t do that here” #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/QBTsBCvqyo
Third, we change the way we talk about #addiction — we fight stigma w/ science. As @MayorPugh50 states, we know that addiction is a disease, for which treatment exists, and recovery is possible #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/74eRY9ecHU

One of the culprits is #fentanyl, a synthetic #opioid 50-100x stronger than heroin #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/II68DSi3lB
As @MayorPugh50 said, we are in the midst of the deadliest drug epidemic in US history. In 2011, there were 167 OD deaths in #Baltimore — by 2016, the number have more than quadrupled to nearly 700 #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/rdH2JieCYf
Thank you Crista Taylor (@BHSBaltimore), @BMore_Healthy partner in every effort. And of course the hospital docs, nurses, social workers, and other staff for carrying out this work on the frontlines #LevelsOfCare
Thank you to the State’s Behavioral Health Administration; the @GroupMosaic led by Marla Osnos, a nationally-renowned expert whom #Baltimore is lucky to call our own #LevelsOfCare
Finally, we owe our thanks to several groups for helping to make possible the important work that hospitals have already done to respond to the opioid epidemic #LevelsOfCare https://t.co/pkfItRWEE7

I am so glad to be here to celebrate you, honor you, and applaud you for the work that you do each and every day for all of our children in #Baltimore #ArtOfCaring @CASAofBaltimore
The work that all of you do every day is testament to what kind of society we are. It’s the society that I am proud to live in, that I am proud to raise my son in #ArtOfCaring @CASAofBaltimore
The late Nelson Mandela said that there can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children #ArtOfCaring @CASAofBaltimore
You help provide the support, the foundation, the connections, in their time of great need. In their time of great need, you show them that you are there for them #ArtOfCaring @CASAOfBaltimore
You help them attend to their medical needs—not only their physical health but also their mental health needs, which is so important given the trauma that so many of our children go through. You help them with social services #ArtOfCaring @CASAofBaltimore https://t.co/YaEMFpJawg
You are the ones who protect, guide, and support your assigned child’s needs. You help them with their education #ArtOfCaring @CASAofBaltimore

Great questions about @BMore_Healthy from some bright kids! Thanks for coming along with your siblings, parents, and grandparents for Take Your Child to Work Day. https://t.co/ORQQHPIfN3
Happy Bring Your Child to Work Day at @BMore_Healthy! Spending the morning with some future public health heroes! https://t.co/CX0D4ti6K9
I look forward to continuing to fulfill our responsibility of protecting the health and ensuring the well-being of our youth #TeenHealth #TPPP https://t.co/kSPCIkGlmH
This ruling is ultimately about our children and their children. I hope that the value of science and evidence will continue to be recognized #TPPP #TeenHealth https://t.co/pQW29sgJsj
The ruling means that #Baltimore City’s Youth Advisory Council, which is made up of teens who serve as peer health advocates, will no longer be in jeopardy https://t.co/r1f9FFgFDk #TeenHealth #TPPP
The ruling means that we will continue to be able to build our capacity for teachers who are specifically trained to teach physiology, STD &amp; HIV prevention, and holistic curricula to empower teens to make the best choices for themselves #TPPP #TeenHealth https://t.co/hAiFw1TTJX
The funding is not guaranteed. The ruling means that HHS violated the law in their decision to cut our grant, and they have to remake their decision consistent with federal law (in a time period that will not result in interruption to services) #TPPP #TeenHealth
#Baltimore City has made tremendous gains in reducing teen birth rates—it fell 61% from 2000 to 2016—and this ruling means that we don’t have to roll back the gains that we’ve made #TeenHealth #TPPP
Yesterday’s ruling means that students in #Baltimore will continue to receive evidence-based, science-based teen pregnancy prevention education #TPPP #TeenHealth
The funding cut would have left 20,000 students with a critical gap in health education—and no reason was provided then or since for the cut #TeenHealth #TPPP
Last July, @BMore_Healthy received notice from HHS that our 5-year grant for teen pregnancy prevention would be cut to 3 years, at a loss of $3.5 million dollars #TeenHealth #TPPP
This ruling is a victory for the youth of Baltimore City, and it’s a victory for the use of science and evidence in education and health #TeenHealth #TPPP
I'm so glad to be joining @ChrisVanHollen, City Solicitor Davis, @DemocracyFwd, and our partners #TPPP #TeenHealth
"This [ruling] was a resounding victory. This was a victory not just for evidenced-based progress when it comes preventing teenage pregnancy, but also a victory for the rule of law" -- City Solicitor Andre Davis #TPPP #TeenHealth
"Successful programs that have been authorized by the U.S. Congress cannot be terminated for ideological reasons" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TPPP #TeenHealth
"The cut to Baltimore's teen pregnancy prevention program was arbitrary and capricious. The funds were appropriated for the program, and agreements and contracts were entered into. It's an evidence-based, successful program" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TPPP #TeenHealth

Q&amp;A time at @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/c3IjNweRxB
How will history judge us? We know what works to address the #opioidcrisis, we just need the will to get there @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/6v3mbccwX0
We need sustained, direct funding to combat the epidemic — a “Ryan White” for the opioid epidemic #OpioidCrisisSymposium @modrnhealthcr https://t.co/CsMWoXnGUl
We must be mindful about our language — for example, we shouldn’t refer to people with the disease of addiction as “addicts.” They are people wth substance use disorder @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/Y0G4xxvkw5
For decades, we’ve seen addiction as a moral defect. Now that addiction has impacted white families and other communities not historically impacted, we are discussing it as a disease. We have to be honest with how we got here @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/dKkvVEf1aV
The medical profession also needs to step up — if we played a role in causing the crisis, what can we do now to address it? @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/mRu3Y14uIx
We’ve partnered with law enforcement for our Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Program, which refers people caught with small amounts of drugs to treatment, instead of incarceration @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/z5bEFbLKSr
Our “pill for every pain” culture has contributed to the #opioidcrisis @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/X6csuhweRv
Third, we are working to prevent addiction and fight stigma #OpioidCrisisSymposium @modrnhealthcr https://t.co/gePMQccCUb

There are continuing challenges — for example, @BMore_Healthy has to ration #naloxone #OpioidCrisisSymposium @modrnhealthcr https://t.co/rv4JboMM16
When we see a spike in overdoses, we send out our @BMore_Healthy team to respond @modrnhealthcr #OpioidCrisisSymposium https://t.co/QG2RysjhBG
In Oct 2015, I issued a standing order for #naloxone. Since then, everyday #Baltimoreans have saved the lives of over 1800 of their fellow residents #OpioidCrisisSymposium @modrnhealthcr https://t.co/JxhzeSIuyZ

The funding cut also jeopardizes @BMore_Healthy's Youth Advisory Council, which is made of teens who act as peer health advocates and share info about repro health @WYPR881FM @MiddayWYPR #Healthwatch https://t.co/sgATTlTWCT
This funding cut means that 20,000 students in #Baltimore will no longer have evidence-based pregnancy curricula. The funding cut is shocking and unprecedented #Healthwatch @WYPR881FM @MiddayWYPR https://t.co/sgATTlTWCT

Great to launch our Falls Prevention Strategy this morning! Thank you to our partners! #seniorfalls https://t.co/6FD2bsZN9a
Many of my older patients are terrified of falling and not getting help immediately. We have to be able prevent falls, but also to respond as quickly as possible #seniorfalls https://t.co/nZEu7r67Gc
#PublicHealth is all about meeting people where they are. Thank you to our partners for joining us to help prevent #seniorfalls. Those of us in #Baltimore have never taken a back seat to public health! https://t.co/An6WUr1guH
Thank you to Chief Ford (@BaltimoreFire) and to the rest of our frontline responders in responding to falls #seniorfalls https://t.co/cNYghZ1wlI

Under the stewardship of CEO Carmel Rocques, Keswick has been a partner in bringing interventions to the community, gathering partners to inform this work, and now helping @BMore_Healthy launch this campaign #SeniorFalls https://t.co/w1ZqhwEUCY
Together, under @MayorPugh50’s leadership, we can accomplish our goals and continue to make #Baltimore City the best place to age #seniorfalls https://t.co/to2xTF28hc
Our estimate for a reduction in medical costs for hospitalizations is up to $14 mil per year, not to mention the lives saved and the human impact on seniors and families #seniorfalls https://t.co/vuWflQ4uTG
Our goal is to reduce the rate of falls in #Baltimore City by 20% over the next 10 years. That’s a reduction in nearly 1000 falls annually #seniorfalls https://t.co/5C4Bzz7bsW
The work is being done by many, but now we are using data to inform and drive hat work, in near real-time #seniorfalls
Here in #Baltimore City, our core team of city agencies and over 20 local orgs are working hard to incorporate evidence and data to enhance our existing collaborations #seniorfalls https://t.co/0k5411U7zH
The #seniorfalls campaign will include posters in 100 senior buildings, door hangers to be placed in senior residences, and flyers given out where older adults are https://t.co/z6FAWZZmtH
Third, we will be launching a public education campaign. We are working with partners at Hopkins’ Center  for Communication Programs to identify messaging and test them w/ older adults in #Baltimore #seniorfalls
Exercise programs can further improve health and prevent injury. With our data tool, we can then evaluate these interventions and see whether they are effective #seniorfalls https://t.co/tWeQEpPWKv
Simple solutions such as glasses, moving down a light fixture or using an assisted device to stand up and walk can make the difference to prevent people from suffering brain bleeds &amp; broken bones #seniorfalls https://t.co/rH4fs5LAag
There are hazards in everyday things like area rugs and unsafe footware. We work with community partners to figure out what is the cause of the talks &amp; which solutions can be implemented #seniorfalls https://t.co/EBgvJmL1xp
Second, we target interventions at these hotspots. There are multiple reasons for falls, incl medication interactions, vision problems, and structural barriers like clutter/unstable railings #seniorfalls https://t.co/FE2fX53sIl
We can identify “hotspots,” investigate reasons for falls, and then immediately use the information to advise community partners on where to locate interventions #seniorfalls https://t.co/w5MUqrJ5SE
Through B’FRIEND, we obtain data from hospitals about where it is that our older adults are falling. That means we receive near real-time info on falls at all ERs in #Baltimore #seniorfalls
Last year @BMore_Healthy initiated the #Baltimore Falls Reduction Initiative Engaging Neighborhoods and Data — B’FRIEND #seniorfalls https://t.co/MabWbp0z0C
Today, we are glad to announce the 3 pillars of this citywide falls reduction strategy — First, we find out where it is that falls are occurring #seniorfalls https://t.co/aCTvuX0W8z
That’s why, under @MayorPugh50’s leadership, we are taking an innovative, science-based approach to reducing falls #seniorfalls https://t.co/vVZA48E4mK
Falls can lead to physical health issues, mental health concerns, and social isolation #seniorfalls https://t.co/lSijPBRDVv
Many may have been caregivers to spouses, grandkids, and parents. Now they need others to care for them #seniorfalls
It’s not just about cost — it’s about health. 25% of seniors who fall and break their hips will die within a year. Many of those who survive may no longer be able to care for themselves #seniorfalls https://t.co/2uwol1UQJU
Each fall leads to an avg hospitalization cost of $39K — if we extrapolate, that means the cost of falls in #Baltimore City (for just medical costs alone) is $60 milllion #seniorfalls https://t.co/pTS1Y7N0zW
In #Baltimore City, that’s nearly 5K seniors who fall #seniorfalls https://t.co/OPgaMq0Aej
#SeniorFalls among older adults is a growing public health concern — over 3 million older Americans visit the ER each year for falls https://t.co/gFze9fkxJg
I would also like to acknowledge Keswick and it’s CEO Carmel Rocques for your continued partnership in bringing important community interventions for our residents #SeniorFalls https://t.co/A5i4wCQAlQ

We need a #RyanWhite for the #OpioidEpidemic. Criminal penalties have not been shown to reduce drug use. We can't just focus on the supply of drugs. We also have to focus on demand @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
We need specific, sustained commitment to funding to combat the #OpioidEpidemic @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Many bills in Congress are aimed to address the #opioidcrisis. But many of the bills are tinkering around the edges -- they might get at a couple of policies that do some good, but we need to recog that we have a national epidemic @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
We need everyone's help to talk about addiction as a disease. We need to save people's lives when they overdose, but also get them into long-term, evidence-based treatment @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
There's huge stigma &amp; misunderstanding around Medication-Assisted Treatment. Some people believe that MAT is “replacing one drug with another.” That’s not true @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
We need to make sure all three forms of MAT are available for those who need it @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Every major medical organization and dozens of studies show us that MAT (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) is the gold standard for #opioid addiction treatment, combined w/ wraparound services and psychosocial counselling @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Since I issued a blanket prescription for #Naloxone in Oct 2015, everyday residents have saved the lives of over 1,700 of their fellow residents in #Baltimore City @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Someone who is overdosing from #opioids and would otherwise be dead is walking and talking within minutes after being given #Naloxone @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
There are very few complete antidotes in modern medicine -- #Naloxone is one of them @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
#Baltimore City is 1/3 of all overdose deaths in the State of Maryland. Funding for services like peer recovery specialists should be targeted to areas that are the hardest hit @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
Now that addiction is affecting white, rural communities (and other places that are relatively newer to the #opioidepidemic), we have to recognize the racism &amp; structural inequities that got us to where we are @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
When it was black and brown people, poor minority communities dying from crack/heroin epidemics, it was seen as a moral defect or a choice @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
We should recognize that the disease of addiction causes biological changes, like other diseases do @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
We have to recognize addiction as a disease, like heart disease or diabetes @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
#Opioids bind to brain receptors that then trigger euphoria (the “high”). Studies have also shown chronic changes in the brain to those who become addicted @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
#Opioids derive from opium. These are some of the most addictive substances that exist on earth @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
If people can access treatment when they need it (not weeks or months from now), then there is a path to recovery. Millions around the country are in long-term recovery @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) is the gold-standard for treatment, combined with psychosocial counselling and other wraparound services, like housing @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
In the same way that when someone has a heart attack, that person’s life needs to be saved at the moment they’re having a heart attack. But then they need long-term treatment @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Addiction becomes a chronic brain disease. People enter a spiral — losing the trust and confidence of their loved ones, losing custody of their children, losing their homes and jobs @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW
I’ve treated children who’ve gotten into their parents’ medicine cabinets and accidentally overdosed. I’ve treated seniors with addiction @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Addiction is something that doesn't discriminate. There isn't a face of addiction; there isn't a certain type of person who has addiction @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance
Treatment exists and recovery is possible. The work that peer recovery specialists do every day contributes to that @WYPR881FM #LifeInTheBalance https://t.co/JM8mNscDaW

People w/ addiction come to the ER knowing they need help; yet, the ER is not always the best place to help them. They need behavioral support and social/wraparound services #StabilizationCenter https://t.co/hJq9HXfjHo
I’m an ER physician, and I’ve treated thousands of patients w addiction who come to the ER #StabilizationCenter

We have a “pill for every pain culture.” In one year in the US, doctors issued 230 million prescriptions for #opioids #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/tM1V81OcOA
When addiction was something that impacted minorities and the poor, we didn’t treat it as a disease. We have to acknowledge that racism is a public health issue #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/D0rTgt93jX
We need additional funding to address the #opioidcrisis. We should direct resources to areas that are hardest hit — incl #Baltimore City @MdMercyBalt #SocialWorkMonth https://t.co/isz4kZIez6
Let’s remember who we’re fighting for &amp; what we’re fighting for — that it’s about our children, and in the words of @RepCummings, “the generations of children yet unborn” @MdMercyBalt #SocialWorkMonth https://t.co/DAYCbACTcP
Together, let’s take the minutes that we have. Let’s fight for health, equity, &amp; justice. Let’s lead w/ urgency, compassion, &amp; action #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt
To my fellow leaders, advocates, &amp; champions: you may be unsung heroes in your daily work, but today, we sing for you &amp; celebrate you @MdMercyBalt #SocialWorkMonth https://t.co/qUjrRcaLVN
Benjamin Hays, civil rights activist &amp; scholar, once said: “I only have a minute — 60 sec in it. Forced upon me I didn’t choose it, but I know that I must use it. Suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it. Only a tiny min, but eternity is in it” #SocialWorkMonth https://t.co/z2aCfXohcH

Racism, mental health, and trauma all impact people’s well-being. Often, it’s hurt people who hurt people #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt
“Public health saved your life today...you just didn’t know it.” Maybe it’s time to let people know. We should tell the stories of what we see #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/unFsGl3BBC
Second, we must speak up about what we know #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/35ZWN8iIqZ
What is the moral and ethical cost of doing nothing? What is the economic cost? #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt
Our @BmoreforBabies initiative has decr the infant mortality rate in #Baltimore City by nearly 40% in 7 years @MdMercyBalt #SocialWorkMonth
First, we should talk about what’s working and flip the narrative #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/sZXFAMh09i
It’s an uncertain time — sometimes we ask ourselves “what can I do now?” In the ED, we never say an issue is “too complicated” @MdMercyBalt #SocialWorkMonth
At @BMore_Healthy, we’re focused on saving lives and increasing access to treatment #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/Lnb0f4UUEw
Only 1 in 10 people who need treatment are able to get it. This wouldn’t be acceptable for any other disease #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/ulIUl7YafL

A major driver of the #opioidcrisis is #Fentanyl #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/C1didMnX7G
Last year, over 700 people died of an overdose in #Baltimore City. That’s around 2/day #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt
We can’t talk about the state of health w/o discussing #addiction #SocialWorkMonth @MdMercyBalt https://t.co/MZTmjwYEum

I am proud of the impact the #Baltimarket #VirtualSupermarket has made for our seniors, and I look forward to its success here at #RuscombeGardens
Accessing healthy food can be an everyday challenge #VirtualSupermarket
Our #RuscombeGardens #VirtualSupermarket is our newest and 14th Virtual Supermarket
Our #VirtualSupermarket program makes the healthy choice the easy choice https://t.co/cKY4LJhjdT
Since the #VirtualSupermarket program launched in 2010, there have been nearly $600K worth of groceries sold w/ 43% of customers buying more fruits &amp; veg https://t.co/6nRv1EFELX
Our #VirtualSupermarket program was the first in the country to allow shoppers to pay w/ #SNAP benefits at time of delivery
The #VirtualSupermarket provides easy access to groceries through the ongoing partnership w/ ShopRite of Howard Park in a way other programs can’t
There is no simple solution to the problem of food access, but we in #Baltimore have never taken a back seat to public health #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/wtTxPWzkoQ
It’s heartbreaking that many illnesses are caused by the environment we’re in — and when we know that a simple change in diet can improve health #VirtualSupermarket
Food insecure seniors not only suffer from greater rates of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure — they are also 5x more likely to suffer from depression #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/G9d1ks1Az6
Disparities in access to healthy food are driving disparities in health #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/qWYPSjT6Ey
This is especially true for seniors in #Baltimore City, where nearly 18K seniors live in Healthy Food Priority Areas #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/EfSxBfJubO
There are also profound disparities in access to food. 1 in 12 white residents in #Baltimore live in a Healthy Food Priority Area, compared to 1 in 3 of our Afr-Am residents #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/xMy2Y5pIGC
Many of our fellow citizens have to rely on family/friends for rides or opt for expensive travel options to get to locations to purchase healthy fruits, veggies, lean meats #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/ZA3p4iM4Sy
Many of our fellow citizens have little to no access to healthy food options #VirtualSupermarket
In #Baltimore City, 1 in 4 residents live in an area identified as a food desert — now referred to as a Healthy Food Priority Area #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/4tJ8uLDl38
As a doctor, I can talk to patients about the importance of eating healthy foods — but how can our patients eat well when they live in food deserts? #VirtualSupermarket https://t.co/7Wr2OC8dDd

We also need to be honest about our history — there are generations of incarcerated black &amp; brown people to whom we owe an apology. Racism is a public health issue #BrownMemorial https://t.co/XYW5CPccLK
We also know that it’s hurt people who hurt people — we need upstream interventions. Violence and trauma occur cyclically #BrownMemorial https://t.co/ktKRbyCog7
Fourth, speak the truth — Rev David Ware (Church of the Redeemer) says that the #opioid epidemic is a “spiritual disease manifesting as a medical disease” #BrownMemorial https://t.co/kYW7uuUFKe
Third, go beyond rhetoric — we know what works, we just need the resources to get there #BrownMemorial https://t.co/uaq8kK7MNY
Second, help spread the message that treatment exists and recovery is possible. Promote the need for Medication-Assisted Treatment — the “gold standard” for addiction treatment #BrownMemorial https://t.co/qNb11T2HHA
We must treat #addiction as the disease that it is #BrownMemorial https://t.co/W9wI5nJ6Hk
.@BMore_Healthy’s Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Program refers people caught with small amts of drugs to treatment instead of incarceration #BrownMemorial
How can faith communities help address the #opioidcrisis? First, learn how to use #naloxone. Many of @BMore_Healthy church partners have saved lives #BrownMemorial https://t.co/veZLfGJb7B
Third pillar — Fight stigma w/ science. Treating addiction as a crime is inhumane &amp; ineffective #BrownMemorial https://t.co/fJDXaNuSrS
Treatment works — We need all three forms of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) available to people #BrownMemorial
.@BMore_Healthy is opening up a Stablization Center soon — a 24/7 “ER” for addiction and behavioral health issues #BrownMemorial
For #addiction treatment and behavioral health services, call: 410-433-5175 #BrownMemorial https://t.co/39gG8nXiIj
Second pillar — Incr access to treatment, esp treatment on demand #BrownMemorial
Stigma is also a challenge — some believe that providing #naloxone will encourage people to use more drugs. This is not true #BrownMemorial https://t.co/djx1KMlBqo
There are many continuing challenges, including funding — we are rationing a life-saving drug during a #publichealth crisis #BrownMemorial
Learn how to administer #Naloxone! #BrownMemorial https://t.co/FRHEEsqgnF
My blanket prescription (standing order) for #Naloxone has saved over 1,625 lives #BrownMemorial

Learn how to identify an #opioid overdose #BrownMemorial https://t.co/xLzbbg15Rg
At @BMore_Healthy, we have a three-pillar approach to addressing the #opioidcrisis #BrownMemorial https://t.co/syfTRhesCL
We cannot address supply by itself; we must also address demand for #opioids. Only 1 in 10 people who need treatment can get it #BrownMemorial
Another culprit of the #opioidcrisis, #Fentanyl, is 50x stronger than morphine, up to 100x stronger than heroin #BrownMemorial https://t.co/YDJjNHBm7q
We are 5% of the world’s population, but we account for 80% of the world’s #opioid prescriptions #BrownMemorial
In one year, doctors wrote 230 mil prescriptions for #opioids. That’s enough for every adult American to have their own bottle #BrownMemorial https://t.co/GFCnvYFdVR

Yes. The paper is based on a flawed assumption--that naloxone laws equate to naloxone distribution &amp; access. In Baltimore, naloxone has saved 1,600+ lives.

On @FOXBaltimore at 845am to discuss the impact of federal gov cuts to evidence-based teen pregnancy education in #Baltimore &amp; why we are filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration @BMore_Healthy
Universities step up gun violence research even as federal government shies away. This is about science and obtaining data to save lives! https://t.co/K6fjUyKYiW

"We have to keep supporting evidence-based approaches to avoiding teen pregnancy. We've made progress. Now is not the time to stop and reverse that progress" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TeenHealth
.@BMore_Healthy found out about this grant termination in July 2017; we rec'd a routine grant letter w/ news of the cut buried within the letter. We never rec'd justification for the cut, or a response from HHS despite numerous inquiries #TeenHealth
"Teaching youth a range of ways to avoid teen pregnancy is what works. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. We should all have the goal of reducing teen pregnancy" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TeenHealth
RT @BMore_Healthy: “Baltimore has reduced teen birth rates by 61 percent between 2000 and 2016.” @DrLeanaWen #TeenHealth https://t.co/e6t8e…

We must ensure that we don't roll back the gains we've already made #TeenHealth
As @RepCummings says: “The cost of doing nothing isn’t nothing.” We know what works. #TeenHealth
We see the impact of funding cuts on #Baltimore City #TeenHealth
We see the effect in their futures and on their children’s futures #TeenHealth
We see the faces of the 20K teens who will not receive pregnancy prevention education #TeenHealth
If we have a strategy that will improve health outcomes for our women &amp; children, then the last thing we should do is to cut funding and hurt generations to come #TeenHealth
My baby is 6 mos old. Us moms and dad’s want nothing more than to have a healthy child #TeenHealth
There are also health consequences for the moms themselves; I speak not just as a doctor but also as a new mother #TeenHealth
Teen moms have higher rates of giving birth to pre-teen, low birthweight babies, who are more likely to have worse health outcomes #TeenHealth
3rd, cuts to our Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program will adversely affect health outcomes for our most vulnerable mothers &amp; children #TeenHealth
We should be doing everything we can to empower our youth to succeed &amp; to thrive #TeenHealth
In 2010, teen pregnancy &amp; childbirth accounted for nearly $10B in costs nationwide #TeenHealth
Numerous studies show us that reducing teen births incr the ability of girls to graduate from HS &amp; to have econ stability for themselves &amp; their families #TeenHealth
2nd, funding cuts to teen pregnancy prevention initiatives will incr costs for #Baltimore City and for our country #TeenHealth
I am deeply concerned about 3 major areas if this funding is curtailed. 1st, this will slash edu attainment &amp; econ opportunities for our youth #TeenHealth
As a doctor &amp; public health official, I’ve seen how much the HHS grant for our Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program has helped us in #Baltimore #TeenHealth
I spoke to our Youth Advisory Council recently. One member said, “without this education, I’d likely would’ve been a teen mom &amp; my future would’ve been very diff” #TeenHealth
Participants in the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program have said that this teaching is far more than reproductive health edu #TeenHealth
The funding cut also jeopardizes our #YouthAdvisoryCouncil (#YAC) made up of #Baltimore City teens who act as peer health advocates to share info about repro health #TeenHealth
These facilitators ensured that 12K #Baltimore City teens rec’d teen pregnancy prevention education during 2016-2017 academic year alone #TeenHealth
Last year, we trained 115 teachers to deliver evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs #TeenHealth
In addition to cutting evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention curricula that incl edu on physiology &amp; STD/HIV prevention, the funding cut also removes support to train teachers &amp; build capacity for health edu #TeenHealth
"HHS has decided to unilaterally end @BMore_Healthy's grant. We need to continue funding and supporting #Baltimore's successful teen pregnancy prevention program" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TeenHealth
"We've seen dramatic drops in teen pregnancy in #Baltimore. We've also seen a decline around the country (41% since 2010)" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TeenHealth
"We should all want young people to succeed -- we need to do everything we can to help them make the right decisions" -- @ChrisVanHollen #TeenHealth
On this call, I am joined by @ChrisVanHollen, who has been a tremendous advocate for #Baltimore City, for MD, &amp; for evidence-based health &amp; education #TeenHealth
