@CuomoPrimeTime Tells a story and then have supporters just as yourself go out and fight to protect it because he has an R in front of his name?
@CuomoPrimeTime I will stand by her and support her but will not go out and continue to make her look like a fool and my self by supporting her lie publicly. This is a savvy intelligent business man he knows what he is doing and doing it purposefully.
@CuomoPrimeTime I like you Matt and the President but do not have your affinity or sense of loyalty guide you into making poor decisions. I love my sister but if she blatantly lies I will not stand up publicly and say she is telling the truth.
@ChrisCuomo Why have’nt you gotten after it for names of Congress men and women who have settled sexual harassment cases w/taxpayers$. That to me is more of a crime than paying to keep an infidelity relationship between 2 willing participant with their own money. Bigger mistrust is congress
@mschlapp Matt I sometime support the president and I like the direction but let’s be real and call it like it is he lies straight up. And don’t tell me about how Obama did or Bush or Clinton did. Yeah they may have. But that still does not mean President Trump isn’t. He does!
@brianstelter  yeah Brian why? https://t.co/ivx7W5eyWe
@WritersRite @JoeBiden @CynthiaNixon Spot on well said.
@CynthiaNixon @JoeBiden @DrBiden Does not mean that I wish them harm or ill will and does not mean I do no think their choices are an abomination against God for one and nature
@CynthiaNixon @JoeBiden @DrBiden But i do not just view them as a homosexual. They are people some Mets fans like I am some like the same music I do. So they are human as anyone else and I have many conversation with them and we are pretty cool.
@CynthiaNixon @JoeBiden @DrBiden I am also against homosexuality I actually have people I associate with and I am very friendly respectful or cordial with and I disagree with their life choices strongly.
@JoeBiden @CynthiaNixon You just caved to pressure from doing what is right. Is that the kind of leader you desire to be. Once someone calls you out you cave for the fear of pressure of not being accepted
@CountryFirst84 @SpeakerPelosi How about we are all on a team called USA
@cabernetfanc REally, where did you go to school? The pizza sucked where I went.
@julieroginsky Okay solid point but because you one has not worked at the Gap or a restaurant does not mean they are out of touch or do not know the value of work or taking pride in it. Especially if they are able to take what is given and grow it to more than what it was.
@KatTimpf Sounds like you have something to get off your chest? LOL
@KatTimpf LOL!
@TulsiGabbard @TuckerCarlson like Venezuela Syria and other places the UN should step up. That way when the UN speaks it is the WORLD SPEAKING OUT NOT JUST ONE OR TWO NATIONS! Tired of the USA getting involved in every conflict out there.
@TulsiGabbard @TuckerCarlson some beacon for the rest of the world. We are in many ways but the answer is not to run in and topple a regime. First the people of that nation should have skin in the game. Secondly THIS IS THE VERY REASON THE UN WAS CREATED so that instances
@TulsiGabbard @TuckerCarlson atorcities we reflect back on that time in history and want to right this wrong of what ever dictator is committing these acts. 2 it also comes from this benevolent moral high ground we as a nation so enjoy positioning ourselves as
@TulsiGabbard I just watched you on @TuckerCarlson And I agree with you. This issue of regime change stems from two things in my view. 1 being end of the WW2 the world said NEVER AGAIN &amp; Gave birth to the UN and also us USA as a SUPER POWER! So when we see these dictators &amp;
@CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @KennedyNation @TaraSetmayer &amp; we cannot even get the overseers to get themselves in line. &amp; NOW I AM SUPPOSE TO BE MAD ABOUT COHEN &amp; TRUMP? SMH! The one check that we as a society have on the over seer (CONGRESS) is the media. #RELEASETHENAMES!
@CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @KennedyNation @TaraSetmayer I find that to be an even MORE EGREGIOUS ACT! I did not donate to the Trump campaign but if I did it would be voluntary if they used campaign fund but my TAX $$ is not voluntary!
@CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @KennedyNation @TaraSetmayer and WE HAVE NOT SEEN ONE HEARING ON THIS OR EVEN THE NAMES RELEASED! Or the media (You Chis) or after this like do dog to a bone. But the Cohen situation has been sought after just that way.
@CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @KennedyNation @TaraSetmayer Among all the coverage of this Cohen political show yesterday 1 matter that was focused on was payment to Stormy w/his own money or not but FUNNY that in recent time CONGRESS has taken TAXPAYER$ to settle sexual harassment cases
@ChrisCuomo Lets get after it! Chis? And go after this story, investigate! We should know who EXACTLY TOOK TAX PAYERS $$ &amp; SETTLED CASE! It is the HIGHEST FORM OF BREACHING TRUST! Wouldn't you agree?
@ChrisCuomo  if I did it would be voluntary if they used campaign fund but my TAX $$ is not voluntary! &amp; we cannot even get the overseers to get themselves in line.  NOW I'M SUPPOSE TO BE MAD ABOUT COHEN&amp;TRUMP? SMH! The 1 check on the overseers is the media&amp;I'm not hearing enough
@ChrisCuomo  ON THIS OR EVEN THE NAMES RELEASED! Or the media (You Chis) or after this like do dog to a bone. But the Cohen situation has been sought after just that way. I find that to be an even MORE EGREGIOUS ACT! I did not donate to the Trump campaign but

@CountryFirst84 @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SpeakerPelosi @ReElectCummings which I did not even donate to. But the govt. takes my money before I get it myself &amp; settles cases of wrong doing &amp; THEY DO NOT EVEN HOLD A HEARING ON THIS! #RELEASETHENAMES!
@HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SpeakerPelosi @ReElectCummings but that is the SAME CONGRESS who more than likely has member who settled sexual harassment cases w/TAX PAYER $$.  I am suppose to be mad at the president or his people for spending their own money or campaign money
@CountryFirst84 @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SpeakerPelosi @ReElectCummings Did anyone find it IRONIC that congress grilled Cohen about payments made to Stormy w/money of his own or not
@brianstelter @CarolC Powerful statement BS but all theater, NOTHING OF MEANINGFUL SUBSTANCE or ANYTHING NEW! Nothing he has said has been corroborated. STILL WAITING!
@TaraSetmayer @RepLynch There is a lot of truth to it but SO FAR NO FACTS AS OF YET! I MEAN SUBSTANTIVE FACTS OR DISCOVERY RATHER! Nothing meaning full that we did not know already. JUST MORE POLITICAL THEATER AS WE HAD W/ HC on Benghazi that will YIELD NOTHING!!!
@TiffanyDCross Yeah we do and I know you do not like what we have but HELL NO! Not looking to go back to that either. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW &amp; WHAT WE HAD BEFORE HIM!
@Yamiche Maybe so, maybe not.
@Yamiche Comes across convincing but I have a lot of questions. For 1 the checks he got how do we know they are specifically for repayment?
@Yamiche happily willingly gained, &amp; did so much that had nothing to do with the president. Also I wonder if he would have this wake up moment he has today had he not been caught. So is he genuine about what has been done or is he remorseful now that he is facing the consequence.
@Yamiche While this is true many of what Cohen said comes off as believable and absolutely fits the narrative of what is out there about the president in the main stream. But also he did himself no service by lambasting the president for so much wrong while he stood in service to him &amp;
@amandacarpenter TRUE! VERY TRUE!
@ECHOtheCALL 100000000000000000000000000000% True SPOT ON! I have been arguing this with someone for the longest. Once a subpoena is submitted THAT MEANS FREEZE! Do not destroy, alter, damage affect remove said evidence. Actually you are suppose to turn it over RIGHT AWAY! Took her 3wks! SMH!
Does anyone find it IRONIC Debbie Wasserman Schultz is questioning Cohen. How is she even still a congress woman? STUNNING!

@thehill @AnnCoulter I think AC is the idiot in her decision making to make these remarks! Because you do not get your way or what you want. Lets see how you do, RUN FOR OFFICE! Apparently you think the President is so Bad &amp; constantly giving advice or criticism so lets see how you'd do?
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Then they wonder how the likes of Bernie, Trump, Cortez are rising in popularity! Congress is THE MOST POWERFUL BRANCH OF GOVT. YET THEY ARE FECKLESS! WOEFUL DERELICT, &amp; CORRUPTED! SMH
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Not a coincidence
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS AMEN! SPOT ON! We have so many laws that are so vague to anyone can be charged. It's said that everyday each of us break about 3felony laws a day That sounds like TYRANNY TO ME! When you have a saying that it is so easy you can indict a ham sandwich THAT's SAD, NO LAUGHING MATTER
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS making some progress going into 2020. I am frustrated with the Pres. because the opposition is not going to lay down &amp; roll over &amp; for someone that knows how to cut a deal or negotiate he is handling all these moves so bad.
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I think he should have taken the $25Billion and tweaked it on which Daca recipients get to stay and who doesn't set by some guidelines which is what will ultimately needed to be done if &amp; once we do immigration reform. So with that By now we would have some wall being put up and
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS but we can vote them out. McConnell has been there since mid 80s Feinstein as well and others. IT IS RIDICULOUS!
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS BIG PART OF THAT PROBLEM IS WE THE PEOPLE! WE THE PEOPLE fall for this &amp; do not stay informed enough which admittedly is like a full time job in itself (ie the spending budget that will last about 6 to 9 month till the next deadline &amp;it is 1100 pages bigger the the freakin bible)
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS We still do not have a solution to Healthcare issue after 6yrs of them telling us they were going to fix it. I do not trust the Dems especially with what many in that party is espousing. What the hell are we going?
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I am unable to argue PRECEDENT to him or the courts against that ticket. SMH! We have to get this back on the right track. I think we need to build the wall. I also think the Reps need to get their heads out of their ass an organize &amp; do things in a more methodically manner.
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Also I agree with the standard but lets get it straight just because one side gets away w/doing something wrong does not mean it is an excuse for the other side to do so. Everyone in law &amp; politics uses PRECEDENT, but some how if the cop pulls me over for a speeding
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I agree Pres. Trump is taking this on and I AM GLAD! Forcing congress to do something but he should have done better when Reps. had the majority. Good luck getting the Dems to do much on this. EVEN WHEN THEY WERE IN SUPPORT OF MUCH OF WHAT IS BEING REQUESTED NOW A FEW YRS AGO.
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS They play this thing right down to the wire for dramatic in this BAD REALITY SHOW CALLED USA POLITICS! SMH If Jefferson, Adams, Franklin can see us now, what would they say?
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS HOW HE TRY TO GET ME &amp; THE NATION TO THE GOAL WAS HORRIBLE! Also congress Has been kicking this can &amp; play political football on this issue since the Regan ERA probably before that but that is roughly 30yrs and NOTHING! Also Reps. was against a wall at one point.
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS I know a lot of support of the president wants to support him but MUST CALL IT THE WAY IT IS! DACA he could have negotiate a bit more to determine how you screen them &amp; decide on the process of who stays &amp; who does not! HE LOST ON THIS! I like his direction but
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS That is usurping the constitution far as I know at the moment. I want the wall built. Pres. Trump HANDLED THIS VERY POORLY! He had a very good deal on the table that he could of possibly tweaked a bit&amp;had already gotten this on the way w/$25Billion rather than $1.2 or $1.3Billion
@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS True but there is hypocrisy on both sides and it is all about WINNING &amp; SCORING POLITICAL POINTS RATHER THAN DOING WHAT IS RIGHT OR EVEN BEING PRINCIPAL on the issues. As for me I DO NOT LIKE THE TAKING OF FUNDS AFTER CONGRESS HAS APPROPRIATED IT!

@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly Oh also I wonder if @JoyVBehar will be loosing her job like MK for actually committing the type of offense the MK was simply commenting on? IRONY is a strange thing!
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly Where is @Alyssa_Milano &amp; the MEETOO movement on this? Where is the protest in VA. Just asking question of this troubling new standard that has been set &amp; NOW TURNED ON THE CREATORS OF IT?
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly Also willing to extend the presumption of innocence tell proven otherwise but according to the left in recent history, ALL WOMEN ARE TO BE BELIEVED &amp; this man should be REMOVED IMMEDIATELY because of the mere accusation that was alleged against him.
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly According to the standard of the left it appears not. Now the lieutenant Gov. of VA has been accused of sexual allegations which I myself am having trouble buying into the story thus far.
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly his explanation I can give it some ear play to say it is understandable. Halloween party dressed up as rappers when he was supposedly in his late teens. So he has shown contrition is he not worthy of understanding, compassion &amp; forgiveness?
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly However the left have not &amp; does not extend this it appears, at least it appears to be selective or partial. The AG of VA has been found to be guilty of the same offense not to the degree as what the Gov. has done but same particular offense &amp;
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly Now for me I would ask since then to now as a person has her changed. Because all of us are guilty of something in our past &amp; hopefully have learned from it. So he is worthy of the same compassion.
@CountryFirst84 @megynkelly the Left has set a standard or status quo &amp; wonder if they are willing to live up to that? The Gov. of VA has been found to be wearing a mask or polished black face or in a white hood in a picture that is racially insensitive.
@CountryFirst84 Funny how @megynkelly supposedly lost her job for honest commentary on wearing black mask, which is what has be the battle cry on racial issues that there needs to be a conversation &amp; she gave that &amp; she lost her job but now the tables has turned &amp;

Not thanks I want FULL CONTROL OF MY LIFE that includes my healthcare decisions. I am an adult not 6yrs old I DO NOT NEED SUPERVISION!
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter These are just a few things I would like to see and hear discussed besides just the wall.
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter which ever the decision is by the courts. Also employers employing illegal immigrants not cool, should be fined BIG FINES, also many of those on public assistance well they can take these jobs &amp; if not then loose their public assistance privileges.
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter That is a BIG PROBLEM! Also catch and release WHAT IS THAT? Should not be releasing them at all. Also 3yr back log of getting these people to court for a hearing that need to change the laws need to change to speed that up to weeks &amp; send them back or allow them to stay
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter if the number is 11mil or 22 mil dreamers are here then not all of them stay but many of them do and we get something for something. ONLY IT WORKS UNLESS IT IS A DICTATORSHIP! Also I am MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE COMING OVER BY PLANE OR BOAT &amp; OVER STAYING THEIR VISA!
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter Or considering others that are on line that we may not know how reliable the vetting info on those who are on line. Yes it is a bit of rewarding bad behavior but remember these children had no say in the matter. I would have work or at least try to work something like that so
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter going to our schools and are part of our system or country all be it illegally. So vetting them is a lot easier &amp; information is a lot more reliable than from many of the countries they come from if they had to go back &amp; get on line.
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter have committed no crimes other than being brought here by there parents to stay 6yrs of work papers or visa &amp; they can go get citizenship. Raise the cost to become a citizen. Also this is more advantageous because we know who many of these people are because they have been
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter He had a deal for 25Bil should of taken that or reworked it a bit and gone with that instead of now fighting for 5Bil. I am not for blanket amnesty or just anyone staying here but I am for allowing those who are 16 and older who have been her 10yrs or longer &amp;
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter Yes they will get retro pay but if it played out then that would not work. Now state of emergency well he can do that &amp; may not totally be successful depending on how is arguing the case on either end when that gets to a court &amp; who the judges are. So how do you purpose he get it
@kevinnicks4pain @AnnCoulter Yes but our system the House controls the purse so if they do not give the money lets say he does not sign or veto then stale mate. Then perhaps you I know me I would not want this to play out for 2months or more where people are not getting paid as they are working.
@Veldpark @AnnCoulter EXACTLY! She is doing what politicians do, PLAYING Politics! She knows how our system works but yet she's criticizing. I see right through it. It's all to bolster her public persona&amp;perhaps sell a few more book&amp;get more followers. SMH! Since she feels so strongly She should run
@AnnCoulter You also had the HUBRIS to say you will rally people against him or something of that nature. Thinking a bit much of yourself &amp; if you truly feel that way WHY NOT YOU RUN FOR OFFICE &amp; DO THE THING YOU WANT TO SEE HAVE DONE? Then talk. SMH!
@AnnCoulter Well depending on the view that argument can be made but the reason behind which you do so is the problem. I am seriously starting to wonder if you know at all how our system works?
@AnnCoulter You do much of what the Politicians in Wash DC does! PLAY POLITICS! You talk a good one but that is about it, well no sell a few books as well &amp;try to bolster your public persona. You call the Pres. a lunatic &amp; incompetent  &amp;lazy.
@berniewins2016 @ngraysmith @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule OR BETTER YET NOT GET ANYTHING AT ALL &amp; STILL NOT ONLY PAY BUT WILLING TO PAY MORE! Baffling that anyone would be in support of that. SMH!
@berniewins2016 @ngraysmith @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule going to go to school we want more of it to waste it. SMH For the life of me how do you NOT SEE THIS CONCEPT! &amp; MORE SO would ever put your faith in them is beyond me! I mean ANYTHING ELSE you would fire the person you would not pay for something GET HORRIBLE SERVICE OR PRODUCT
@berniewins2016 @ngraysmith @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule we have been scammed. Same thing they are doing with this free college idea now. They already take tax dollars to make the schools affordable then over the year they run the cost up &amp; then we get shocked and made and they tell us now we want more of your money even if you are not
Yes but none of those things Govt does well. You want to see how well Govt ran or influenced healthcare is going to look then take a look at Social Security THAT IS BANKRUPT! It is the same PONZI SCHEME they are going to run on us and like Madoff &amp; SS we will find out year later https://t.co/v30Jad5PEa
@berniewins2016 @ngraysmith @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule Oh I forgot the irony you put community college which is a big part of what we are discussing&amp;the nation as well free college because it has become unaffordable but you put it here as something that the govt. is doing right.

@berniewins2016 @daveijames @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule so they throw up their hands and sell us this NOAHS ARK solution as if it is one at all. IT IS NOT AND WILL NOT BE SOLVED THIS WAY. Solution is to make it more affordable so a person making 25K a year can get at least two examines a year, their regular dental visits and

@berniewins2016 @daveijames @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule till it got to the point now the problem becomes a difficult one to solve (like many other issues then they come in late to the party to be the hero when they were guilty of being asleep at a time they should have been awake ie subprime, car emissions, and one that is not big now
@berniewins2016 @daveijames @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule All I know is GREAT MEN AND WOMEN BUILT THIS COUNTRY so they can determine their own destiny and make decisions for themselves. WE AS A NATION HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM THAT, partially to blame greed on that &amp; our govt. standing on the sidelines watching it happen
@berniewins2016 @daveijames @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule Private sector beats Govt. 7 to 8 times out of 10, not saying private sector does not have its down falls or draw backs but at least with private sector I will have options w/I do not have options.

Govt that is made up of over 600 people and staff that puts the number in the thousands &amp; they come down to the wire EVERYTIME ON THE BUDGET! It is like some BAD REALITY TV SHOW HAVING US ALL WAIT IN SUSPENSE! Then they all wonder how Bernie &amp; Trump got this support
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris &amp; WE GIVE IT AWAY SO WILLINGLY! SMH
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris I PROMISE YOU TAXING WALLSTREET WILL NOT BAIL OUT THE MIDDLECLASS ESPECIALLY WITH THE GOVT IN CHARGE OF THE MONEY! I am a grown adult I do not need govt in ever facet of my life. Nation was birth because of this few took up arms against the many and mighty to have these FREEDOMS
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris Well if you are talking about a bail out for the middle class then I would want to see that look like something of creating more jobs and training programs to get people working and helping themselves rather than just taxing them.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris THEY WERE TAKING IN THE BEGINNING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE BUT DID NOT! SMH! SCAM!
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris How much creativity does it take to say hey free this or free that. Doesn't really take much. We the AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE MORE THAN THIS! Also college is not for everyone, we all get to choose our path in life. If govt. is going to take MORE TAX$$ now to pay for what
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris So the way to do that is make it affordable not just run a scam and say it is free because Politician do not want to take on the tough problems and find real solution. Rather they scam us with this free business&amp;people drink it up and they walk off looking like they did something
@TheMoldyFilters @ekgoldberg @KamalaHarris Not to punish one or the other but to ensure that there is fair opportunity for all &amp; no one is block opportunities for others that choose to seek it.
@TheMoldyFilters @ekgoldberg @KamalaHarris because of how much they have. Their parents do what every parent looks to do provided better for the next generation give them more than we had. I believe lets look to how we make it more affordable by looking at the rule &amp; regulations and loop holes.
@TheMoldyFilters @ekgoldberg @KamalaHarris So because he or she decided to make sacrifices went through hardships in life&amp;worked on a goal and made it rich they should not be forced to pay more? No matter if I or you shared in the pain of getting there. Or because he or she was born into it that means they should pay more
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris I hope so as well but again the solution. I never had that burden.
@William84734915 @RealSaavedra So you state that gun companies labeled them as assault riffles as if I would now change my position or now it is right because they did? All guns are not labeled assault guns so why one and not the other when they all do the same thing in the wrong hands. They all shoot bullets
@TheMoldyFilters @ekgoldberg @KamalaHarris It is unacceptable I agree but the solution he has is STILL THE WRONG ONE!
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris I agree Or certain directive in place to ensure that we all prosper.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris as well along w/sports stadiums built w/tax dollars. By the way not a battle just a debate on the solution on how to solve the problem.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris If that is the case then we should not say FREE HOUSING FOR EVERYONE &amp; 3Square meals a day but that is not the case we all have choice and paths we choose some good some bad. ALL FREE WILL! As for public funds such as the recent Amazon facility in NYC I am against that
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris See I am not against our Children going to college if they choose to I am just not agreeing with the solution.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris Now that is an effective argument! But it WAS NOT RIGHT TO GIVE THEM A BAILOUT, So if it was not right then it is not right doing so now. Play the tit for tat game &amp; IT NEVER ENDS!
@William84734915 @RealSaavedra I never argued about that I was making a point about assault refiles THEN ALL GUNS SHOULD BE CALLED ASSAULT GUNS &amp; perhaps some cars should be called assault cars because they can go too fast.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris Why should you raise even a cent! Until the Govt can show me they can balance the budget &amp; manage the money I am not for raising taxes ON ANYONE! See it's easy for you to say yes lets do it for this one or that 1&amp;justify it w/the moral factor but when it is you it maybe different
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris College is elective not a must. If we all pay for it then we should make it mandatory that we go to college to get an associates or BA
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris I agree with you and I am mad my tax dollars are being used to subsidized businesses period! Also bailouts and oil companies. See you made the statement probably thinking you knew all my views because I am against my tax$ being used in a scam coated in morality.
@berniewins2016 @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule I promise you the cost is not going down because we now make it one basket system.
@berniewins2016 @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule So solution is not HEY FREE Healthcare  or Universal Health care. That is the EASIEST way and human nature dictates we gravitate to which is easiest. Politician peddle this all for votes KNOWN IT WILL NEVER LAST! Lets figure out HOW TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE!
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris Sorry cannot help you, that is how they sell you on it. State funded schools, community colleges yeah it will be affordable Now it isn't and they want more money. If I give you $100 and you piss it away why would I give you $1000 you just showed me you cannot manage $100
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris You do not get it &amp; It is not okay but you are free to do so.
@msbeekie @KamalaHarris SMH! That is what they are doing already. None of theses colleges are under Fed. reg. or directive IT IS RAN BY STATES &amp; the state already collect tax $ for them or uses Tax$ on them to make them affordable &amp; they are not doing so but we should be okay w/giving more$ SMH
@RealSaavedra Is a hammer an assault hammer? Is a pen an assault pen? They are all blunt objects that amounts to a paper weight but effectively used they all can be a weapon.
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris Don't understand cannot help you. Sorry!
@berniewins2016 @RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule So lets take a look at that and Govt. being the Refs. should look at the rule to make it fair. No more no less. Call the fouls when they happen but MY DESTINY IS MY OWN!! Not the Govt. to decide!
@TheMoldyFilters @KamalaHarris That is my point public school is mandatory up to 12th grade after that you are on your own, it's up to you if you want to go to college or not. Just like a parent mandatory they are responsible for the child up to 18 after that it is elective if they want to keep caring for them
@KamalaHarris I WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO GIVE THAT PLUMBER MY MONEY, but what you are advocating is that very thing just keep giving Govt. money to do something that it is not doing in the first place. SMH!
@KamalaHarris But you KamalaH wants to lay a tax on all of us for something the is elective. That you are already taking my money for &amp; not doing what you said you were going to do with it. If a plumber came to my house to do some work and did a HORRIBLE JOB I or not do the job I paid him for
@KamalaHarris Last I check we all pay taxes no matter if we have children or not for schools BECAUSE SCHOOL IS MANDATORY from K to 12th grade. If a child does show up to school &amp; is not being home schooled the state will show up at the parents door to find out why.
@KamalaHarris Last I checked many of this nations state universities are state funded so tax dollars are already going towards it to make it more affordable but Govt. has done a bad job at it so now they want to say FREE college which isn't free at all because they want ALL of us to pay for it
@RebeccaBuck @FNC_Ladies_Rule Yeah cus Govt, is that much better right. LOOK AT THE VA if you want to see what Govt ran healthcare is going to look like. SMH! Why anyone even entertains this is beyond me. Why would you want to hand over the supervision of your HEALTH TO THE GOVT! SMH!
@SebGorka Well I tell people who advocate for this sort of stuff JUST LOOK AT THE VA, if that is how our Vets are treated after fighting for our FREEDOM, JUST IMAGINE HOW THE REST OF US WILL BE TREATED! No thanks I can find my own way. Don't need Govt making decisions for me
@amandacarpenter While we are at it how about picture of aborted babies.
@AnnCoulter Answer this if every elected official dug in they way you are &amp; did not budge a bit on everything they promised to do how much do you think we as a nation would get done or accomplished.
@AnnCoulter because there is a great diversity in opinions &amp; solutions &amp; ideas among the Rep. vs the Dems who tend to walk&amp; operate in lockstep. (Caps are not me yelling but rather emphasis on what is being expressed)
@AnnCoulter So there has to be a compromise! Yes do not want to give a blanket amnesty or in your case ANY AMNESTY but to get a little you have to get a little. Even if we have 70% in both houses I still think we will not get the no amnesty as you see it and the wall
@AnnCoulter Think your latest criticism of @realDonaldTrump is DUMB &amp; Redundant! You very well know how our system of Govt. works so unless there is a 60+ Rep. majority or 67+ you will not get everything you want. Over Govt. system was SPECIFICALLY SET UP THIS WAY!
@JesseWooten18 @AnnCoulter @anntensity It is how the founding father framed our government/system. That both sides MUST COME TO THE MIDDLE, HAD TO BE DONE TO BIRTH THE NATION, but seems you do not want ANY OF IT!
@JesseWooten18 @AnnCoulter @anntensity There is something called Checks and Balances I am sure you are familiar with it so what you are suggesting is not that easy or even possible. If he even starts it will be met with resistance and it will go to court. The way out of this is COMPROMISE on BOTH PARTS!
@RepDMP @HouseDemocrats @POTUS Shut down seems to be the en vogue topic at the moment but with 600+ members in the house &amp; senate are there any other issues being solved? Opioid abbuse, infrastructure, more job creation, gun problem in the country, Chicago, and much more!

@julieroginsky Do not often agree w/your view point but do miss you&amp;wish to see you back on TV because it is important to have opposing view because it often challenges our own view&amp;cause to question them which helps either solidify them or see the weakness in them&amp;or change them
@donlemon have not watched you as of lately, but I do remember your continuous coverage of BillCosby and his assault, would like to see the same on R. Kelly.

@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump HE DOES NOT WALK ON WATER YOU KNOW.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump BUT LETS BE REAL! He is human and he does make mistakes! It is evident in his business dealings that is why is has had so many successes because he has failed &amp; learned from them. So why so many including you at time get so worked up when someone criticize this President. SMH
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump So Laura you point this out but she was also criticize by the President. And you and many on TV do as if he is SO BEYOND REPROACH &amp;ABOVE ANY CRITICISM! I get it you do not want the criticism because any would just legitimize what in many views a tear down of this Pres.
@MandaLemke @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I can for someone who believes in a different religion or political view or different sports team or different policy at my job. SO WHY CAN'T I HERE?
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys publicly ostracized. I think we can all disagree passionately without it being or even rising to hate.
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I am sure what I hear is not either. I do not hate I just do not agree, do not wish ill on anyone, but the new standard as it seems is if you do not agree then it is label HATE to perhaps somehow push the person with that view into acceptance for fear of being labeled or
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys That can only happen with a man &amp; woman. You need the seed from a man &amp; egg from a woman. X&amp;Y. That is just an AXIOM. I can go on and on but I will leave it at that because I have a feeling I am not going to sway any minds &amp; much of what I may say is nothing new just as
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Also when you break it down to the very granular level we are all here to procreate. Yes I know there are many of us that never do but overwhelming majority generally speaking of the human race we have that need &amp; instinct to procreate like any other species.
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Well to make this short it in my opinion it goes against the laws of nature. Mankind is the only species (When I say only I am sure you or someone else reading this will give me some anomaly of something else contrary)that will go with the same sex.
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I am not for silencing hate speech I want it voice loudly so I can see and recognize it&amp;who advocates for it. I am for more speech so when confronted with hate speech We speak up and engage with it. NOT RUN &amp; FLEE FROM IT OR SILENCE IT.
@SkylerSlywchuk @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys If it's not on the table why are you responding or even discussing it w/me. We are all here in the twitterverse having a debate on many views. You have yours&amp;I have mine&amp;we each get a say. That is all I have been saying. I do not agree and I am expressing so just as anyone else.
@Tronsfrmr @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I agree that one should not be force to subscribe to one religion or another. God gave us all FREE WILL!
@brit326 @MandaLemke @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Same as my race religion and many other things. I do not agree or believe in the Muslim religion but I can still respect someone who is Muslim &amp; their choice and get along with them just fine, because there are much more to the person. Hope this illustrate my point.
@brit326 @MandaLemke @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Simple we are different and not going to like things about one another but we all have many parts to us that makes up the sum total. I am more of a person than just what I do for a living  but my living make up a great part of who I am,
@firefighter5511 @CurtisFlex7130 @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys You are more than welcome to that opinion and expressing it. I feel differently. But respect your choice to have it and express it.
@DoniaLilly @CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Great point!
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys people in life they will come across with and not like the choice that person make it still okay as long as you respect them as a human being and the right to make that choice and I am asking is the not tolerant as well.
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I was simply saying you say that the point you were making not allowing or tolerating the idea of differences and and yet those people are good people is wrong so I am asking you if that teaching that dislike something or viewing it as wrong and teach children that there are many
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Great I am glad you feel that way. So does the person that hold opposing views. They do not feel they have to change.
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Debate me on it or pass me by.
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I do not like or care for &amp; many time I just keep on going. We all get that choice but to say just SHUT UP because you disapprove (which according to your definition is judgement and you should not because you do not have the right to) of my opinions well NOT A STRONG ARGUMENT.
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys You do not know that for one also Aren't we all or don't we all have hang ups from one degree to another. Like I said it is the public square so we all get to say a peace. I threw my two cents in tonight because I felt like it. There is so much that come across here that
@jeffhuit @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Okay but no 1 is even advocating such. Just expressing like or dislikes. We do this all day long in all that we do. It is part of being human. So I do not think anyone at least not I was advocating ill treatment of others. Just the right to speak 1s mind&amp;say they dislike or like
@SusanAsplund @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I am asking based upon the standard that I am seeing being set. I know what I am. To like or dislike something is that judgement? If so then I guess we all are judging CONSTANTLY EACH DAY ABOUT EVERYTHING!
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys where all points of views can be allowed and respected or the right to have the view.
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I do not believe in what the parade did and I am against it. As far as scaring I would not go that far but continuous display of it I feel is no good but that is me if you approve then fine. Watch I was totally unaware of it but just  wanted the conversation
@jeffhuit @desertrat10 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I do not think any of us here have the exact science down on what is right or wrong for children and at what age. We have seen it done many ways and turned out right and turn out wrong so who am I to tell another person what is right or wrong for their child.
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys So to not allow your children to see this or teach them that it is wrong but we all do things that are wrong so you respect &amp; love your fellow man even if you happen to disagree or dislike their actions. That is intolerant?
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys So because they are not in the popular opinion or have gotten on board with everyone else I guess they should not express themselves or if they do they should know that they are wrong and should change? Seems they are saying the same to you that you should change.
@russwolf @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys So me saying I disapprove is being disrespectful?  Or I do not like it is being disrespectful?
@desertrat10 @jeffhuit @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys But that is my view. If there are those who want to see it I guess I am against it in a parade. Modern family i do not watch do not care for the show but there are those who like and want it so, so be it I just find something else to watch.
@desertrat10 @jeffhuit @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I knew they loved each other and that was what it is and how it should be. But that is my view. Watching the Cosby's growing up or Family Matters or Growing Pains or Family Ties you saw that &amp; it played a role. But for two men or women kissing I am against or doing so in a parade
@desertrat10 @jeffhuit @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I do not agree with the first part of what you said but the part about the kissing I agree with to a degree. But as a kid I saw my mom and dad kissing many times and thought it was disgusting as a very young boy but as I grow I got use to it and welcomed it because
@AltCheeto @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Absolutely but my response was to encourage debate rather than just you are a bigot or immoral because you happen to see it differently. That is all, We all have the right to the public square so debating rather than shouting someone down or as 1 person put it YOU SHOULD SHUT UP
@ixxiebelle @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Great point!
@MahaReincess @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Of course you can and have debate on it but some comment such as bigot or others or the fact that the person should not have expressed it at all to begin with rather than just debate on the foundation of the subject is what I was getting at.
@jeffhuit @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys SO it is your place to be for it but if you are against it then YOU SHOULD JUST SHUT UP! Expressing disapproval is judgement? If so then expressing approval is judgement as well and then so should we all SHUT UP as you say. Not much logic with this. Sorry
@KateDey3 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys And this I disapprove of as well.
@KateDey3 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I AM UPSET ABOUT THAT! ABOUT PEOPLE LOOSING THEIR HOME IN CA PEOPLE FLEEING CENTRAL AMERICA, PEOPLE SUFFERING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN ASIA, IN MIDDLE EAST, IN AFRICA, PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY, PEOPLE SUFFERING IN SYRIA, IN YEMEN! MANY THINGS I AM OUTRAGED ABOUT!
@KateDey3 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I can begin to untangle. If it was many of the world problem would have been solved already. I am not speaking because of the man in office to be honest these types of issues have fallen to many before him both with a D &amp; R attached to them. So with that said AGAIN OF COURSE
@KateDey3 @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Well I AM AGAINST someone getting murdered and doing arms deals for oil and this is not to excuse anything at all but just being honest the murders and arms deals and solving those issues are not that simple &amp; they are problem that are such a complex web that neither you nor
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys So you are for silencing speech?
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys So would you classify it as hate speech if I was to say I disagree with homosexuality and do not think it is right?
@NickKnack__ @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Okay I am with you on this but if you are expressing displeasure about something seem that it is fair play to like or dislike something and say so.
@JaqTweedie @Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I am against two women or men kissing but that is just me. I can respect their right to make that choice and live and let live but do not say I am not human because I do not agree or think the same as you. Seem to me it is unhuman  to give the freedom of choice to do&amp;think freely
@Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys but I respect them they respect me.
@Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Well I did not see the original tweet. But if you simply do not agree with homosexuality you should be able to make that choice and express it freely. I know homosexuals &amp; when we talk it is hardly ever the topic even though they know I am not for it and I know they are
@4everNeverTrump @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Great quesiton
@CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys BUT I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WILL NOT ACCEPT HOMOSEXUALITY AS A GOOD THING OR RIGHT! That aside I can respect a person for the choice they make and their right to live as they choice but do not force me to do the same.
@CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys but accepting of that life choice as okay or a good thing I do not. But I do not look at a homosexual person through a single lens. There is more to a person that just their sexuality. It makes up a big part of a person but it is not all there is to a person.
@CaraModisett @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys That is your view on it and that is fine you are welcome to it but also the other view is not wrong either. Why is it wrong to be not accepting of homosexuality? I do not accept is though I know many that are &amp; I have no problem w/them I get along just fine w/them mutual respect
@JessNeedsADrink @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys If someone chooses to be homosexual fine have at it, and it is their right but should it be the right for the rest of us to accept it or not or believe it is right or wrong?
@JessNeedsADrink @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Why is it closed minded if you do not believe in homosexuality? It is now SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN IT OR ACCEPT IT! Just as how many advocate for telling people who they can&amp;cannot love then SHOULD IT BE THE SAME ON HOW TO VIEW IT?
@TheTruthBox82 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I would not let my children watch this or watch the President on TV.
@DrumpfOfTweet @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys How about being offended by all the above. how about that? Just asking?
@russwolf @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Seems fair to me that both sides express themselves in respectful manor
@russwolf @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys Why is one perspective right and the other wrong? I get it that is your opinion and I respect the right to share it and disagree with opposing opinion but just as how you say that the other side is wrong they are saying yours is as well.
@SusanAsplund @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys so question if I do not like it, does that make me a bigot?
@TrumpWontWork @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys But we all get to raise our children as we see fit. &amp; we all get a choice on how to view something and because you do not like it does not make you a bad person.
@TrumpWontWork @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys to come up with ad campaigns. Not sure of or if there was even an agenda here. I personally did not even watch or see or even know this happened until I saw this tweet but I will say I would not want my child watching this or seeing it or myself for that matter.
@TrumpWontWork @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys It is all about perception and what gets thought or feed to the subconscious so while innocent enough now more &amp; more of it can normalize something whether you are for it or against it good or bad it could be feed into the brain. Many people in marketing study this type of stuff
@VintageKnits @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys That is how you view it and you are welcome to that voice and thanks for expressing it.
@KShee1993 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys SO you just express your thought and it is one that says it is healthy and okay for two women to kiss and THAT IS FINE! YOU ARE FREE TO HAVE THAT OPINION! But if someone has an opinion contrary to yours then some how they are not okay and not allowed to speak.
@Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys to go against the trend then something is wrong. Just an observation.
@Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys I do not like it either so when many of these types of things come up on my TV majority of the time I just change the channel or find something else to watch. That is my choice. Twitter is the public square for all who choose to voice an opinion but it seems like if you happen
@Trilluxx @niknakkin69 @ForAmerica @nbc @Macys But here is the think what is wrong if someone does not like it and expresses his or her dislike. That seems to be frowned upon because we are all suppose to be for it? I thought this is America and if it is you can like or dislike something for what ever reason you so choose.

@LouDobbs I agree CJ JohnR should not interject himself in politics but also how Pres. Trump crafted his words and what he said was poor as well. It seems like Pres. Trump can say WHATEVER HOWEVER &amp; THE REST OF US SHOULD JUST SHUT UP AND DEAL WITH IT!
@LouDobbs Lou you just seem like what ever Pres. Trump does or say YOU ARE GOOD WITH IT &amp; HE PRETTY MUCH WALKS ON WATER AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED. That is the impression you give. SMH! The way the question are framed sometime is a bit much.

@DebReyn85125570 @NBCNews @WillieGeist without even giving that person the benefit of the doubt. He said he should not be in the courts. He also put it out in the public square for judgement which is fickle VERY FICKLE .
@DebReyn85125570 @NBCNews @WillieGeist Not yelling you are interpreting it wrong. Placing emphasis on the words. So if you bring it up is to make what point exactly because all I am discussing is here are two people accused of something &amp; the 2nd person was part of the crowd that was calling for the removal of 1st
@DebReyn85125570 @NBCNews @WillieGeist Still that does not mean his is innocent or guilty ALSO THE RESPONSIBILITY DOES NOT FALL UPON HIM TO CALL FOR AN INVESTIGATION even if he did not does not mean he is guilty. YOU ARE STILL ASSUMED INNOCENT TILL GUILT IS PROVEN!
@DillyDi52812672 @NBCNews @WillieGeist You can but it is not up to the accused to call for an investigation! THe owness is not on the accused it is on the accuser &amp; whether or not they are calling for one they are still innocent till proven guilty. You standing behind Avenati IS FINE I HAVE NOT PROBLEM W/THAT!
@ssgsteveh @NBCNews @WillieGeist So if going by that principal should the same go for this instance and I am say NO no matter if left or right or how something appears INNOCENT TILL PROVEN GUILTY! Everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt.
@ssgsteveh @NBCNews @WillieGeist I get that, that is not what I am directly speaking to my friend, I was speaking the contrast of how both of these situations are being treat in the court of public opinion. With BK they assumed he was guilty &amp; wanted him to recuse himself MANY DID NOT WANT HIM ON THE COURT!
@ssgsteveh @NBCNews @WillieGeist Yes but same principals APPLY! It is a tenet not only of our judicial system but fabric, foundation of our society as USA
@NBCNews @WillieGeist Okay I take him at his word but not the same person here that we saw when the shoe was on the other foot with BK! Innocent till proven guilty! Said it then saying it now. BUT THE IRONY OF IT ALL! IT IS GLARING!
@KamalaHarris AMEN! SPOT ON! But it is funny how POLITICIANS (you included) PLAY IDENTITY POLITICS! CLASSIFY EVERYTHING! ESPECIALLY AROUND ELECTION TIME! SMH!
@Johnny_Joey @Acosta @CNN @AlyssaMilano01 Also CNN has others they can send to the WH press room if they want. JAcosta has made it about him and it is NOT or should not be! I do not like the way the President handled this but he is on solid ground &amp; I do not feel sorry for JAcosta or any of the press.
@Johnny_Joey @Acosta @CNN @AlyssaMilano01 THAT GETS TO BE THERE EVERYDAY ALL DAY. CNN does not have a monopoly on the press or rights to the WH press room MANY OTHERS DO NOT GET A DAILY OR WHAT IS CALLED A HARD PASS to the WH but we do not see them pitching a storm.
@Johnny_Joey @Acosta @CNN @AlyssaMilano01 using your logic if freedom of speech is being threaten because JAcosta is not allowed in the WH then I guess all the other news outlets&amp; media that do not get in should file a lawsuit.

@SenGillibrand I agree with all you said just a few points missing and this is not a bash but hopefully constructive criticism or food for thought. When listening to your constituents that means all of them not just the 1s that voted for you, because the 1s that did not are in the minority &amp;

@freedom7930 @thinkprogress Not going to get into a debate with you on it. If you want to characterize it that way fine be my guess I happen to differ &amp; this is not to say I take it lightly or down play what took place.
@freedom7930 @thinkprogress I said if she characterize it that way SURE I WOULD NOT FAULT HER. But we can all use adjective that mean the same thing but some of them have more of an affect than others. I called it harassment you look up the word terrorize you will see they are synonyms.

@Satiricali @SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 I would love very much if many of them would just say I came I served for a time &amp; now I am moving on. MMcConnell, CSchumer, NPelosi, DFeinstein all have been there longer then a decade heck some 2 and 3times over.
@Satiricali @SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 Also they cannot stay there forever at some point the will leave. We cannot live forever so someone will HAVE TO STEP IN! Also if that is the case then why should we have term limit on the PRESIDENT?
@Satiricali @SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 They are not the only ones with the answer if so we would perish. Just as our found father could have stayed but many left &amp; those who replaced them did fine. Now sure we will have some that will not perform well but that is a give just like with anything else.
@Satiricali @SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 Well from what we have we can see that that very manipulation by lobbyist is in FULL AFFECT ON ALL SIDES! Also it is the power they hold &amp; influence that goes with it. You serve for a time &amp; then let someone else take the reigns!
@thinkprogress WRITING THIS IN THE WAY YOU DID IS THROWING SALT IN THE WOUND! JUST AS DESPICABLE!
@thinkprogress I do not agree with your view but I certainly would not want to seek out your address to INTIMIDATE, HARASS, OR CONFRONT YOU! Because that is your home &amp; no matter how much you disagree or detest a persons view or A PERSONS HOME IS OFF LIMITS!
@thinkprogress where he is spreading what in your view is xenophobia. BUT YOU WENT TO A MANS HOME WHERE HIS CHILDREN ARE &amp; WIFE IS AND SHOUTED WE KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP! THAT IS A THREAT! I DO NOT KNOW BUT HOPE YOU&amp;YOUR GROUP UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF WHAT YOU DID!
@thinkprogress THIS WAS IN NO WAY A PROTEST BUT RATHER INTIMIDATION&amp;HARASSMENT! What you did was not in any way innocent! If you felt this way even though I do not agree w/your view&amp;characterization of TC the more APPROPRIATE &amp; AFFECT WAY would be to protest his place of business
@thinkprogress First of all the way you characterize all of this to make it seem very innocent, IS NOT!! ABSOLUTELY NOT! You went to a mans home where his children &amp; wife are. The occupants do not know you &amp; you began to chant we know where you sleep.
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 The monarchy type system, they did not want this govt. to look anything like that. But we have many in congress SERVING WELL OVER A DECADE! #SICKENING GOD HELP US!
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 So it is more about self preservation than COUNTRY! Founding father could have stayed in govt. till their dying day &amp; many choose not to because of what they fought against.
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 &amp;They are suppose to be the best among us. The consensus is Well if I cave or give in a little then my constituent (heck you politician do not even say that anymore you now say followers) will not vote for me.
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 All the while singing the same song SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE! Give a little Get a little. HECK JUST THE VERY CONSTRUCTION OF OUR CONSTITUTION WAS BIRTHED THIS WAY! But our elected officials CANNOT FIGURE THIS OUT!
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 SO IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HARD TO GO FAR RIGHT OR FAR LEFT! COMMON GROUND, THE MIDDLE! But her you are &amp;Not just you but ALL OF CONGRESS LEFT RIGHT &amp; CENTER CONSTANTLY GETTING FURTHER AWAY FROM EACH OTHER!
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 then I applaud you but I would not be surprise if there are many that appose such cause. That is where we are WHEN WE CANNOT FIND MIDDLE GROUND! Funny the FOUNDING FATHER PURPOSELY SET UP OUR GOVT THIS WAY!
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 As for the politics of it well I wonder if you have ever been lobbied for one cause or another &amp; if so did you go along because you felt it was the right thing to do based on the issue itself &amp; not self serving
@SenGillibrand @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @CountryFirst84 You make this about the NRA! YOU USE THEM AS A SCAPEGOAT! STOP IT!!!! You are an elected official part of a body that makes the laws in this country IT IS YOUR JOB TO MAKE LAWS NOT THE NRA!

@John_Kass But I do feel to permanently take away his press pass is no good especially for this infractions. 2-3 weeks is good to me. JAcosta needs to realize it is not about him, when the story becomes about you YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG! &amp;that is not just this instance it has been on going

@Acosta Not saying he is an angel but you still go at it with him far to many time &amp; I feel majority of it is purposely. I could be wrong but that is just my view. Also not feeling sorry for you, THE MEDIA HAS BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER for a LONGGGGG TIME NOW!
@Acosta I think it is a good thing you got your press card pulled but NOT PERMANENTLY! A week or two maybe three is good. You are a reporter SHOULD NEVER BECOME THE STORY &amp; Far too much you have been &amp; I view you purposely got at it with the President!
@Yamiche @TiffanyDCross @BernieSanders who still perceive it that way BUT YOU DID NOT DESERVE THAT TREATMENT.
@Yamiche @TiffanyDCross @BernieSanders I do not feel you were racist yesterday or day before. YOU WERE ASKING A FAIR QUESTION! It is perceived by many is what you were asking. I will say the President did give his definition of what it means to be a NATIONALIST so there is the frustration perhaps by him of those

@reb102173 @albanyconserv @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 This is true but one can argue the recent bombs (or call them fake bomb if you would like but people getting them sure did not feel that way)mailed out or shooting at a house or worship all had right leaning beliefs but it is not because of THE RIGHT THEY DID WHAT THEY DID!
@CarlosQban @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I would not quiet put this in the same basket, you see a video &amp; you jump out the window calling them Communist with out any background on who they are or what they are about or reasoning for what they are doing? A lot more is unknown that what is being told in a 30sec video
@rn_vet @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 @CNN @MSNBC It would be nice, THAT WE ALL DO NOT JUST THE LEFT BUT RIGHT LEFT AND CENTER! As Americans WE ALL SAY NO THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! I do not need to hear it but I WOULD BE NICE! I do not agree with the left on most things BUT THEY ARE STILL AMERICANS SO THEY ARE MY BROTHERS&amp;SISTERS
@nadafilipovich @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Spot on! THere is good and bad in everything. Doctors, a few bad one but not all same for lawyers, cops, contractors POLITICIANS, Journalist, and many more.
@JGirl130 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I am with you on teaching some history again! Calling them communist, I won't go that far.
@AlaricCDX @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 A lot easier to change your number or block a number than pick up and move your whole life somewhere else because of what can be perceived as a threat.
@AlaricCDX @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I VENTURE TO SAY YOU WOULD NOT VIEW IT AS PROTEST! It is Harassment &amp; Intimidation! Also how do you know it is a one time thing? Also I am NOT DEFENDING GIVING OUT A CELL PHONE NUMBER THAT IS WRONG but I would not put it in the same basket.
@AlaricCDX @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 First this WAS NOT AND IS NOT A PROTEST, IT IS HARASSMENT! Wonder if you would call if a protest if a bunch of people on twitter found your address and came to your house and started shouting we know where you are. Because of comment you mad on twitter,
@nomorelies_x @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 &amp; there are some that feel the same about those on the right. I do not agree with MUCH OF WHAT THE LEFT HAS TO OFFER I do however understand reasoning behind some of it.
@4Libertyinlaw @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I would agree with that, that the standard is not equitable across the board.
@dclaytonbarnes2 @mmadoglover @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Sorry for the misunderstanding then
@Bsand13 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I have family &amp; friends that are LEFT &amp;though I disagree with them VEHEMENTLY! I do not regard them nor are they violent or even nasty or mean! Also I would defend the innocent on the right as well.
@Bsand13 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Understood, but so we are clear I am not defending violent protester. I am however defending the innocent on the left that HAS NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS! So for many that just paint the WHOLE LEFT as this they are wrong because
@albanyconserv @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Also yes I know he was a democrat I do not follow him so do not know what political affiliations he has but I know many in media try to make it seem as if he is Rep. Right wing &amp; that is the point I was trying to convey.
@albanyconserv @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 NOR DOES IT MAKE THE WHOLE RIGHT RACIST!
@albanyconserv @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I used a well know name to make a point I can use MANY OTHERS but do not have the time so I went with what I felt would be the easiest to make my point. The point was if David Duke likes something someone on the right said that does not make the person that said it a racist
@BobbyeDowda @catsnexttime @Breaking911 But you are right if that is the standard the all things being fair someone should come out &amp; say something.
@BobbyeDowda @catsnexttime @Breaking911 right&amp;that when something happens it is not a representation of one side or the other. But the political leaders &amp; media play that game for us &amp; we buy in so now if someone does not say something we all have a fit.
@BobbyeDowda @catsnexttime @Breaking911 well i do not need someone to denounce every time some nut job does something. I am not a grade schooler in class needing the teacher to stand up &amp; say something everytime someone does something wrong! I am an adult and I can think for myself and am fully aware or what is wrong &amp;
@dclaytonbarnes2 @mmadoglover @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I also did not say majority in this tweet
@dclaytonbarnes2 @mmadoglover @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Read my statements again! I said it SEEMS LIKE because I do not know those people that were there, NOT SURE IF YOU DO! Now as for their actions well it is right in line with much of what you see from the LEFT so to look at that and hold that train of thought is not a crazy one.
@6687minni @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I am in contact with many of democrats, liberals &amp; they are NOTHING LIKE THIS so I would say many. BUT I CANNOT PUT A NUMBER ON IT

@Society_Liver @cocky327 @Breaking911 Watch the video when the person commenting on TC commentary and dissecting it.
@Society_Liver @cocky327 @Breaking911 I would find EVEN MORE FAULT WITH THEIR IGNORANCE THAN THEM BEING RACIST BECAUSE YOU STAND AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF CURING THE RACISM ONCE YOU TREAT THE IGNORANCE.
@Society_Liver @cocky327 @Breaking911 but even w/that we all should take a pause &amp; be cautious about hurling such an accusation but today it does not seem that way. If I wanted to now I can make a SOLID ARGUMENT FOR THE LEFT BEING RACIST! Also if that idiot is a racist because they do not understand something
@Society_Liver @cocky327 @Breaking911 He does spin as well. Not as much as other do in my opinion but he does. NOW NOTHING I HAVE SEEN OR HEARD I CAN REMEMBER BEING RACIST I would like to think I would remember if he was at any pt but again we all have different back ground&amp;life experiences that influence our view pt
@FetchingFeline @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 for themselves. If someone said jump off a bridge I am not going to do it and I would like to think many of these NUT JOB WOULD NOT DO IT EITHER But because what was said they use it as motivation &amp; an excuse to do what they wanted too do any way
@FetchingFeline @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I DO NOT FEEL THEY MEANT LITERALLY GO OUT AND BE VIOLENT SAME AS WHEN PRES. TRUMP SAID TAKE THEM OUT&amp;OTHER REMARKS. But when HC, Holder MWaters said what they did it gave NUT JOBS LICENSE TO GO OUT&amp;DO SOME CRAZY STUFF! Also these are adults so they are to also be held accountable
@AlaricCDX @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Sounds like you are saying that you did not like what JWatters did or what Pres. Trump did so why would you advocate for what these people are doing now. Giving out some1 private cell phone number IS WRONG ABSOLUTELY WRONG! Not the same as going to some1 house but STILL WRONG!
@davidaspence @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I would absolutely agree with that statement.
@Kathlee94595215 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Same as I would not say ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THUGS, UNTRAINED &amp; VIOLENT because you see some that are that way but you do have people that have that view. NOT RIGHT! SO THE SAME IS OF THE LEFT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME THAT DO STUPID THINGS DOES NOT MAKE THEM ALL THE SAME!
@Kathlee94595215 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 I do not have to do anything if you want to continue being they way you are fine. It is America we are FREE! I will not say ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST BECAUSE 1 OR 2 DID SOMETHING RACIST. But there are many that feel that way NOT RIGHT!
@Bsand13 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Stop with the tribalism! LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS! It is coming from the left in my opinion but is this a representation of ALL THE LEFT? NO!
@Bsand13 @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 See this is what I'm talking about. YOU DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT POLITICAL PARTY I BELONG TOO OR IF I HOLD ANY FIDELITY TO A PARTY But you say my leaders. Well aren't they all of our leaders even if we did not elect them. Pres. Trump is our President whether you voted for him or not
@albanyconserv @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 Or if David Duke happens to like something someone on the right says THAT MAKES EVERYONE ON THE RIGHT JUST LIKE HIM?
@albanyconserv @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 First if you are using YOU as to refer to me as a Democrat you are being VERY PRESUMPTUOUS! Because I am not but I call it like I see it. So I guess next time some NUT JOB on the right goes out &amp; does something STUPID then that should make ALL OF THE RIGHT Just like them.
@NathenRegister @CoreyParadise2 @Breaking911 YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT, LETS BRING IT DOWN A NOTCH!

But I will tell you I watch JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT &amp; HE IS NOT BY FAR! But I can make an argument for ANYTHING TODAY! This guy is doing what all of the media does spin &amp; twist.
@SmellySluts @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 They are Americans so are Americans NUT BAGS! No we are not but certainly we have some that are. We should not paint with such a broad brush!
@SmellySluts @reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 See we are all getting into this team play type of blame game. This is not a representation of all of the left &amp; the church shootings is not a representation of all of the right. &amp; No matter what side there will always be NUT BAGS OUT THERE.
@catsnexttime @Breaking911 @TuckerCarlson @donlemon Terrorist is going a bit far just like when many on the left use the word racist for any reason. This is a good representation of many on the left &amp; @RepMaxineWaters comments gives license to this behavior WHICH IS NOT COOL AT ALL!
@catsnexttime @Breaking911 I am not happy or a democrat supporter or member but I do not feel this is a representation of the whole democratic party. Is it a large portion of them YES but not all of them.
@cocky327 @Society_Liver @Breaking911 It is getting so numbing now that the word is so diluted that when I hear the word racist half the time I do not even pay attention anymore.
@reb102173 @LindaSu41679497 @Breaking911 This seems very much like the left no doubt but is it a representation of the WHOLE LEFT! NO it is not. Just like there are some on the right that do stupid stuff &amp; they are not a representation of the whole right same goes for the middle &amp; everything else.
@wuxeter @Breaking911 that is a bit far with booby traps but cameras and lights yes.
@Jydemanworld @Breaking911 Well the left has warped everything so no longer boys are boys and girls girls and boys use the boys rooms and girls use the girls rooms heck you no longer have to be what you are born so you can not choose what you are a boy or girl so NOTHING IS AS WHAT IT SEEMS TO THEM!
@Chgo1945 @Breaking911 I wont go as far as jail right out the gate but perhaps 1500 hours of community service &amp; fines so they understand &amp; then if they don't jail.

@TaraSetmayer Both Dems &amp; Reps are getting away with this. THEY HOPE you do this and pick off voters from the other side as if this is a sporting event. Had we had a third major party we could finally shake things up.
@TaraSetmayer but in analyzing your tweet you are unhappy with the Trump supporters or enablers as you call in the GOP party so you could have gone to a third option your choice from a strategy perspective was a poor one.
@TaraSetmayer I think that was a poor choice there was another option a third party candidate or a write in. That is if you are saying you wanted your vote to be a protest unless you really felt the Dems are the solution or have the answer. I regard you as intelligent

RT @cspanwj: Should U.S. End Birthright Citizenship? 		Join the conversation here: https://t.co/HzIWSFUJbr
@cspanwj @cspan then should the child be one as well? That is a legitimate question. Now the convulsion w/this is we all are children of immigrants. Well majority of us are. I feel the process should be looked at but how it is decided I'm just not sure on the resolution.
@cspanwj @cspan So there is a process. Well the same should be if a non USA citizen comes here&amp;has a child. The parent has no fidelity to the USA. The child is subject to the parent teaching&amp;upbringing. That is universal that a child is subject to the parents care&amp;the parent are not USA citizen
@cspanwj @cspan Here is the thing valid arguments on both sides. I am undecided at this point. If a USA citizen goes abroad that child is a USA citizen so as long as the parents go and obtain a USA passport for the child.

@CountryFirst84 @SenSchumer @CNN I think all media report the news but just do so with A LOT OF SPIN! @FoxNews does it as well. Or sometimes onesided and only give you one side of the story.
@CountryFirst84 But I get it if he pulls this off which I do not think it will happen he will grandfather everyone with the status I hope &amp; moving forward you do not get to become a citizen here because you were born here of foreign parents.
@CountryFirst84 Now on the other hand if Pres. Trump ends birthright citizenship then it could very well mean HE HIMSELF IS NOT A CITIZEN BUT HIS WIFE IS! The Irony, Also his son depending on the time he was born in 2006 before or after his mom became a citizen he may not be a citizen.
@CountryFirst84 then same should apply if you give birth to a child in the USA then you should have to apply for a USA passport for that child &amp; go through a process(what that process looks like I do not know)or that child is a citizen of the country its parents are from.
@CountryFirst84 but then that is considered treason. Also if you are a USA citizen and give birth abroad your child is a USA citizen you just have to make sure that they get a USA passport. So if this is the case then it cannot be both ways. If born to USA parents abroad you are a USA citizen
@CountryFirst84 Well a person that is not a citizen here does not hold any allegiance here either&amp;raising the child here they do not have to raise the child to hold allegiance to the nation&amp;I get it even if you are born here of American parents you can still raise a child not to hold allegiance
@CountryFirst84 I have been reading and looking at this there is an argument to be made. Subject to the jurisdiction of. If a diplomat gives birth to a child here the child is not a citizen because the parents hold no allegiance to USA they are foreign officials.

@ChrisCuomo @megynkelly NOTHING COMES FROM SILENCE EXPECT PENT UP FEELINGS WHICH CAN TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORST&amp;RESENTMENT! I will also add I feel it was more about the ratings than her comments why is is gone but the comments was just a way out for NBC to get rid of her. Which is horrible
@ChrisCuomo @megynkelly perhaps turn it around if that is how you view it. If anything her comments should be a teaching moment for us as a country where we seize upon it for that much need conversation &amp; perhaps grow from it. NO MATTER HOW YOU VIEW IT! ONLY GOOD CAN COME FROM MORE TALK.
@ChrisCuomo @megynkelly We all constantly say there needs to be conversation &amp; if so then her comments are part of that conversation because what can be viewed as ignorant comments needs to be brought to the fore front so not only we see it but now perhaps we can engage with it &amp;
@ChrisCuomo @megynkelly I do not take issue with those who disagree with her comments I understand it VERY WELL! But also looking at it, IT WAS HONEST &amp;REAL COMMENTARY, that I feel was not coming from a place with nefarious or malice intent. So with that should she loose her job?
@ChrisCuomo which many stations &amp; shows are guilty of or calling a person names if you do not approve of what they are saying which is what takes place. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THE NEEDLE IS MOVED FORWARD. Look @megynkelly lost her job for what many say and understandably so a stupid comment.
@ChrisCuomo I HOPE YOU DO. YOU HAVE A GOOD THING GOING PLEASE OPEN IT UP A BIT MORE FOR UNDERSTANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE &amp; LETS TALK NO MATTER HOW UNPLEASANT OR UGLY IT MAY BE BUT LETS TALK! By that I mean not cut the person off at the first thing they say that you do not like
@ChrisCuomo same goes for IF YOU DO NOT LIKE PRES. TRUMP! WHAT RUSSIA DID IN THE ELECTION OF 2016 THE ARE SEEING THE FRUITS OF THEIR WORK! A DIVIDED USA which is the start of a collapse of a nation. We are not too far gone to bring this back on the rails. YOU CHRIS CAN HELP WITH THAT &amp;
@ChrisCuomo If you like Pres. Trump THAT IS FINE NO PROBLEM you should not be ostracized for it but rather understood for the reason one does. You do not have to agree but respected for the choice &amp;understood which are many reasons from person to person &amp;
@ChrisCuomo WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THIS DIVIDE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING FOR A LONG TIME &amp; NOW FINALLY BUBBLING OVER A BIT! I watch your show &amp; for the most part you are objective but as of late you have been one sided NOT DISHONEST BUT JUST ONE SIDED&amp;THAT TOO CONTRIBUTES TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY.
@ChrisCuomo For you a JOURNALIST &amp; MEDIA FIGURE YOUR ENERGY WOULD BE BETTER SERVED AS TO ASK HOW DO WE GET TO THE MIDDLE GROUND &amp; BRING BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM TOGETHER AGAIN AS 1 USA. WHAT MANY IN MEDIA(which you are a part of) DO IS FINGER POINT TO THE OTHER SIDE AT THIS OR THAT
@ChrisCuomo &amp; CERTAINLY GOING BACK TO THE STATUS QUO IS NOT THE WAY EITHER! USA on both sides are FED UP with the status quo that is why Bernie had such a large support and why President Trump did as well. NOW CRITICIZING HIM I AM ALL FOR THAT, THAT IS FAIR GAME!
@ChrisCuomo I get it you do not want to accept this BUT YOU SHOULD in the sense that this is OUR PRESIDENT &amp; THIS IS WHO HE IS! Now if you do not approve that is another matter but to keep asking the question or balking at his presidency is not doing you any good OR THE NATION ANY GOOD!
@ChrisCuomo TO THE OVAL OFFICE! In that sense HE IS THE MOST HONEST PRESIDENT EVER! He has not changed who he is or what he has presented to us from the campaign to the oval office. BUT YET YOU &amp; MEDIA FIGURES alike keep asking WHY or HOW or WHEN, which it will never happen.
@ChrisCuomo Here is the thing ALL THE MEDIA LOVES IT! You included Chris. You may not approve of his action but CERTAINLY he give you all something talk about. WHY EVEN ASK THESE QUESTION OF HIM OR ABOUT HIM! He is exactly who he told us he is &amp;going to be. From Primaries to General

@Eugene_Scott @megynkelly Well MK comments is part of that conversation. I did not witness it live but I did go &amp; view it. To me it did not come from a place of malicious or bad intent at the worse perhaps ignorance &amp; unaware of how it is perceived offensive.
@Eugene_Scott @megynkelly ABSOLUTE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT JOY REID DID NOT GET FIRED FOR HER COMMENTS!!!!! Here is the thing WE AS A NATION ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE LEFT. Keep saying there needs to be a conversation when it comes to race &amp; race relations in this country&amp;how it is hard.

@3catsmeow @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @ChrisCuomo So media has nothing to do with this, the politicians on both sided has not contributed to this?
@my_hall3 @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @SteveScalise SPOT ON!
@som3thingwicked @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @ChrisCuomo SPOT ON!
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo You should do the same and not make this a finger pointing match and say that we are all to blame EVEN YOU NOW DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING CASTING BLAME when it is on all sides. WE ALL NEED TO DIAL IT BACK! THE PRES. THE MEDIA, CONGRESS, &amp; PUNDITS!
@IngrahamAngle I do not agree with this ladies policies but to paint it the way you did for her is wrong. She made a mistake harmless at an early part in her life &amp; should not be paying for it the rest of her life.
@IngrahamAngle On your angle on the candidate for Gov. of AL on her flag burning though I disagree w/what she did SHE WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE! It is a time you are learning figuring out you play in the world WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON morally&amp;otherwise&amp;will do some stupid things.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @trish_regan @PhilippeReines I have seen only parts of the show but I do like and will try to watch more just hard when you are at the same time as @TuckerCarlson
@ChrisCuomo You were one sided tonight
@ChrisCuomo today's event had nothing to do with politics. SO YES Pres. share much of the blame but he is CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONE and with as much time or energy you use to point it out how he is flawed you should do just the same to point it out for congress &amp; MEDIA  alike.
@ChrisCuomo Also you have today in the media TOO MANY PUNDITS&amp;TALK FIGURES that give opinions &amp; not just the fact an let people view or decide it themselves. SO THAT IS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION to the discourse we are experiencing today even if it turns out that
@ChrisCuomo Since Pres. Trump came on the scene it has been a none stop fest. GREAT FOR RATINGS! The dissecting &amp; breaking down of what he does &amp; say or don't is a none stop run. I am not speaking of CNN exclusively here but ALL MEDIA the left the right &amp; center.
@ChrisCuomo I watch you tonight especially w/Sen. Kennedy&amp;you were SPOT ON w/ you assessment &amp; analysis of today's events. BUT YOU WERE ALSO BIAS! You spoke to blame on this mainly on the Pres. Not that YOU (not you specifically Chris)the media &amp; congress men&amp;women&amp;senators are all to blame.

@CorieWhalen @secupp So if we do not like it then we should not like much of what has been going on. Which is how he got there because the people got tired. SMH
@CorieWhalen @secupp both left &amp; right conveniently forget to mention. I look at Pres. Trump as the MIRROR ON THE WALL. So for as much as anyone wants to take to him for his words or actions well it is just the unpleasant reflection of what has been going on all along.
@CorieWhalen @secupp Was not saying it was not, it is but I was just looking at it in a larger picture. Since Pres. Trump arrived there is much criticism and overreaction by many, Not saying anyone specifically but the criticisms are accurate but they also happen to be of many that

@secupp @CorieWhalen Many accusations hurled across the isle then later on they are saying my friend across the isle. Same thing NONE OF IT IS RIGHT BUT I HOPE you do not think Pres. Trump the only one
@secupp @CorieWhalen How many times we see politicians go after one another in primaries/general or in any form of debate&amp;later on we see both of them coming together to not just work but calling each other friends.
@secupp @CorieWhalen Okay Great point but we are doing as if this is attributable to Pres. Trump alone. Maybe his form of this is the most petulant but certainly NOT THE ONLY ONE. Which is not a defense of it but rather to say if we call it out on one lets do it for ALL.
@ChrisCuomo Whether we illegal aliens commit more crimes or not the issue is they are here illegally meaning they didn't get permission&amp;even if it's less crime still they're committing crime so it's not excusable(not saying you are saying that but you are using it to make a pt which bit flat
@ChrisCuomo Well Chris many rhetoric from the left(not say there isn't any on the right)say that illegal aliens should be able to come and those here illegally should be able to stay. Both sides agree the system needs revamping but HOW is how they differ.
@Katheri56931902 @ChrisCuomo You are right not easily solved but we can try rather than just let the country be invaded. We can try and pair those who want a chance an opportunity to work rather than sit on public assistance.
@Katheri56931902 @ChrisCuomo Not true many on welfare are perfectly able to do work also we have a homeless problem they are not work and many are physically able too.

@TomiLahren when she checked the box EVEN IF SHE DID NOT BENEFIT FROM IT. Never the less doing it then was wrong &amp; to NOW come out &amp; push this even further is WRONG &amp; AN INSULT.
@TomiLahren Lets leave the politics out &amp;evaluate this straight. WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG! The schools said that her ethnicity was not considered in her advancement however they did use it to push their diversity. So we do not know how truthful the school is. Also we do not know her intentions
@Johnny_Joey I am more of an @IndyCar guy.
@BostonGlobe But the way you write this as some exoneration(my take on it)of what she did &amp;is still doing. She bringing this back up is furthermore insult to those who are Native Americans. She should just say I AM WRONG, I AM SORRY &amp; MOVE ON! JUST LIKE A POLITICIAN TO NEVER SAY I AM WRONG!
@BostonGlobe Here is what is missing from the article not that you or any1 would be able to know but Her ethnicity may not have been considered in advancement BUT we do not know if her using it was the intent. If she said it was not the intent behind it I take her at her word for now.

@AnnCoulter That is a STUPID IDEA!
There are many schools to choose from why go to a christian school. In Christianity homosexuality is an abomination plain and simple. NO CHANGING THAT.
SMH! We here on earth have FREE WILL especially in the USA we have the right to live as we so choose &amp; I respect anyone right to live how that see fit whether I agree w/the choice or not. But to force yourself upon other or their beliefs is JUST WRONG!
if so why not go to a secular school? TODAY WE ALL MUST ACCEPT HOMOSEXUALITY &amp; if not we are painted as if we are persecuting them. If this argument can be made then I guess the devil can be part of it &amp; be inclusive as we or we are persecuting the devil as well &amp; that is wrong.
How come we never hear about homosexuals wanting to go to a Judaism or Muslim school. WHY is it always CHRISTIANITY being attacked. All three religions regard homosexuality as a sin but only one is being forced to change its view. I get it they want to be inclusive &amp;
https://t.co/94xzIJuNOC The way this article was written is so one sided. Makes it seem as if homosexuals are being victimized. More than one way to look at it. It is a Christian school FREEDOM OF RELIGION IS IN THE 1stA so why do they even go to a Christian school.

@Schmity007 @ChicksDigSneaks @SenGillibrand only way to get it back on is if WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND IT! SIMPLE AND PLAIN THE DEMS did this. In this instance here they could have discreetly passed this off to the FBI or MD police or town where it happened &amp; I feel the out come would be much different.
@Schmity007 @ChicksDigSneaks @SenGillibrand The ones we elect who are suppose to know best, know better than the rest of us are governing like 7yr olds.

@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand Because he is now investigated 7 times &amp; yet NOTHING! But now he has this stain &amp; may never get it off.  Lastly I DO NOT THINK HE DID THIS!
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand he would not be made a predator for those who view him that way EVEN AFTER AN INVESTIGATION. See I am willing to look at this &amp; consider the possibility that he may have done this but ARE YOU WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT HE DID NOT&amp; IF SO HOW DOES HE GET HIS GOOD NAME BACK!
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand Had they discreetly informed the FBI or even better Police of MD or the town it was in, this could have been handled with more care &amp; consideration for both parties involved. She would not have been made a spectacle of for those who view her that way &amp;
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand Not just for her BUT EVERYONE INVOLVED! How good or questionable is it. You have a crime that take place today and half hour or hour later police question several witnesses &amp; they get different accounts of what took place. What is a Travesty as you said is how DEMS handled this.
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand and 2 who is to say those 9 people remember it accurately? Inherently there is an appearance of bias because they are her friends and to be fair same can be said of him with anyone he present that are friends. Also the question also comes to memory.
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand Lets say those 9 friends can say that she seemed off the next day or week and was not herself which in your view I am sure would say speaks to her frame of mind or state of being that something happened. Well even if that who's to say it is what's being alleged is the cause for 1
@talks2Eagles @kjwilliams89 @SenGillibrand I am not in law enforcement, are you? Not being mean I am seriously asking? The FBI knows better than majority of us here on twitter. Her 9 friends were not at the part so they can only speak to her as a person. If that is the case I am sure he can roll our people as well.

@Flea_Bitten_Wol @rebeccaprovinse @pantaleo_mary @SenGillibrand Well we all do that to some degree or other everyday. We vote&amp;trust&amp;hope the elected officials do what they are supposed to do &amp; say they will. We trust our police to keep us safe&amp;when we call they will come. We trust many things we do not know &amp; sometime you need a little faith
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand but the best we got. Hope people who suffer this will come forward at once when this takes place&amp; gets the attention it deserves. Also this does not happen to women alone, IT HAPPENS TO MEN AS WELL! We just do not know how many because it goes unreported.
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand Your opinion is no more heavy or light than the next. Both have reputable people to speak to their credibility so it is a matter of he said she said. Do not think it happened at all but if by some slight chance it did, we cannot get justice for her. Justice system is not perfect
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand We do not live in a DEMOCRACY but rather a REPUBLIC DEMOCRACY! The very laws we have many of them have been derived from the very values that we have&amp;hold that gave birth to this nation because the starters flee persecution of this very nature &amp; those values still hold true today
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand on something. I say this to say SURE you see BK as guilty &amp; understandably so. I myself DO NOT THINK HE DID IT, but still know there is a possibility he could have done it. But THERE IS NO WAY YOU GET TO A DEFINITIVE ANSWER OR REASONABLE ONE. So you as a jurist have your opinion
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand he did or reasonably. There is a reason why there is 12 jurors because it is SO HARD to get all 12 to see it the same way. That is why when charged w/a crime many prosecutors charge the defense with more than 1 crime because the chances increase that they will get a conviction
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand Politician say on TV &amp; like sheep we all run with what they say both left and right. Her testimony was convincing but LOOKING AT IT ALL OBJECTIVELY! Not as a man not as a woman but impartial she raised points that we can look to but nothing near enough to definitively say
@pantaleo_mary @rebeccaprovinse @SenGillibrand you do not know what he will do once a case comes forward with facts and arguments &amp; based on relevant law. That is just your fear talking, that is perhaps your bias as a woman &amp;probably a liberal/Dem talking. I do not know for sure but that is my guess. We hear what pundits and
@BobbyDuley53 @AMPRo1219 @realDonaldTrump True but you never know when we can use a swing vote Dem. Not too many of them. And lets be honest his vote meant a lot.
@AMPRo1219 @realDonaldTrump I think Manchin should get another term for what he did and so should Collins
@elizacollins1 Dont want predictions just want them to keep working that is how they win!
@DineshDSouza You are wrong Reps are not doing scorched earth politics they are sticking to fairness. But I would like to see the senate get back to at least 60% vote on confirmation of supreme court justice.
@KirstenPowers YOU NEED TO ADVOCATE FOR ASSURANCE THAT THE INNOCENT DOES NOT GET WRONGLY CONVICTED. Because now a day even after jail you are in the national registry sex offenders list. Case in point https://t.co/xS2V0lei9K
@KirstenPowers Now Kirsten you said it is VERY FEW that is wrongly convicted but still those men and women have years taken away that they can never get back just like victims have so much taken away that they will never get back. So as much as you/we advocate for women
@KirstenPowers IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER PROCESS! What is being said by Collins &amp; Reps are more than talking points it is a piece of the fabric of our society. And NO not one that protects rapist or let criminals go free but one that ensure THAT EVERYONE GETS A FAIR SHOT!
@KirstenPowers you need to provide evidence other than a convincing story or someone that is credible. I wish back in July Feinstein could of disclosed this to the FBI or even better the Police auth. in MD so this could have been investigate. I still think we come to the same result but
@KirstenPowers Our justice system is not perfect, NOT EVEN CLOSE and unfortunate as it may be sometime people get away with bad things. I am not saying BK is guilty I do not believe he is but I do keep an open mind &amp; recognize that there is a possibility that he is guilty but with what you have
@KirstenPowers The trouble is yes we need to find justice for women who has been abused ABSOLUTELY! But also we need to ensure that the innocent does not get convicted. The laws are not written to protect the guilty but the innocent. It is better 10 guilty go free than 1 innocent get capture.
@KirstenPowers @TheCut That is the past but the moving forward will that trend change now becuz of the attitude towards it. Also these numbers posted well that can be likened to police shooting are a small portion of all shootings yet many fear the police but we don't make light of their fears
@ChrisCuomo I do agree that we need to get back to 60% for these confirmation! &amp; Issues such as health care. I think the very core of what it is to be a REPUBLIC DEMOCRACY &amp; what the founding father had in mind. That there would not be tyrants just running away with it all.
@BillHemmer @dbongino This is a good thing and I am happy but when Pres. Obama was in office &amp; the number were dropping many Rep &amp; right wing rebutted the the job participation rate was high so ONLY FAIR to ask what are the job participation rate #?
@MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump This is a good thing and I am happy but when Pres. Obama was in office &amp; the number were dropping many Rep &amp; right wing rebutted the the job participation rate was high so ONLY FAIR to ask what are the job participation rate #?
@KirstenPowers It is not but from the onset the allegation has been loose and very vague with little to nothing to back it up.
@KirstenPowers Even heated debate but not shouting at them or shouting them down when offering explanation or answer. Giving them opportunity to answer concerns with interruption at the first thing you disagree with. Not right or civil.
@KirstenPowers She did not want to talk to him. After seeing what has been going on, the confrontation of Ted Cruz many of these people do not want to talk the want to accost the senators &amp; verbally beat them into submission or shame them. I am all for access to our govt. elected official.
@KirstenPowers Bottomline there is NO WAY WE GET TO THE TRUTH! No way to know if he did or did not do it &amp;if she is lying or not. Yes we can question people but their memory is also questionable in an environment or potential drinking
@AMPRo1219 Access to the SENATE IS A GOOD THING &amp; A MUST but to get accosted rather than ask questions demand answer &amp; meaningful conversation or debate of the ones we pay to represent us is not the way.
@KirstenPowers if the role were reversed and a man accusing a woman of assault it would be the same, we would need proof not his or her word but proof and she would be presumed innocent till proof. Sure we all can have our beliefs but we must also be reasonable to know none of us were there

@bennyjohnson @mschlapp How are you to ever have a conversation with a confrontation like this which is not even a conversation that is being seeked out.
@KirstenPowers @megynkelly Slow down, not saying taking the mans word, WE DO NOT EVEN NEED HIS WORD! We NEED EVIDENCE! He does not have to say a thing because it is not incumbent on him to respond but rather the accuser to prove he did it. Taking it seriously&amp;so far what we have is not enough
@KirstenPowers Her is another one Ken Wyniemko spent 10yrs for false sexual misconduct. https://t.co/zuZQokqQnB Not as if it does not happen https://t.co/WfI04RFT6R
@KirstenPowers https://t.co/k9NviepPTP
@KirstenPowers HAVE SOMEONE FORCE THEMSELVES ON YOU BUT ALSO HORRIBLE TO BE BRANDED OF ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN BE IN OUR SOCIETY A RAPIST! Even when found innocent it is still a stain that stays with you &amp; NEVER completely washes away.
@KirstenPowers Here is another actual false accusation https://t.co/RMAY4cQvUU Man was in police custody at the time of one of the rapes he was accused of yet he still was convicted. FAULTY ACCOUNTS BY THE VICTIM yet he was convicted. HORRIBLE THING TO BE VIOLATE &amp;
Alright so here is one for you that ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. https://t.co/xS2V0lei9K &amp; we don't know how many are truly out there because they have not been found. Not saying wrongly convictions are common but to dismiss the point that it happens is not right either https://t.co/FLIzIccpXw

@brithume Oh I am convinced now.
RT @brithume: My what a powerful argument. https://t.co/tc0zg5MCFs
@SenFeinstein other than that then it is just an exercise. Also the accuser does not tell the investigator how to investigate. The present their statements &amp; or evidence &amp;cooperation if/when needed.
@SenFeinstein You are such an embarassment WHY NOT TELL THE WHOLE STORY! She also did not give evidence, the therapist notes. Also unless you are saying what she said to the senate is a lie the FBI has he statements to run against what they find &amp; if needed then they question her about it but
@TaraSetmayer &amp; not a recent revelation due to current situation but long before this situation I felt it was wrong for him to lie but not worthy of impeachment for that lie. WHY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
@TaraSetmayer his whole life is being painted a particular way. I wonder under that kind of scrutiny how would you or any of us would answer. Much like looking back at Pres. Clinton where he was found in a lie, I then thought he should have been impeached but learning since then
@TaraSetmayer then I would take issue w/him&amp;his answers&amp;the way he answered. It is more than the bench or job interview, w/the NATION LOOKING HELL THE WORLD LOOKING&amp;he is being made to look a certain way on something he is innocent of (his word though I feel he is)&amp;
@TaraSetmayer I am sorry he answered questions was he the most forth coming on it NO but I DO NOT BLAME HIM. WHY? Because of the POLITICAL CIRCUS AROUND THIS! Had it been done in a way where the politics was left out of it (Both sides to blame MOSTLY DEMS)&amp;dealt w/it directly
@ChrisCuomo Kudos on that, I will say that you do give the other side a chance to speak.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo AGAIN YOU ARE BEING BIAS&amp;NOT BEING A JOURNALIST &amp; REPORTING ACCURATELY! If you are saying they(Reps)are willing to get him through at any cost which is your OPINION NOT FACT then you surely must consider the other side(Dems)is DENY him at any cost. But you make no mention of it
@ChrisCuomo but to say she is a victim is to automatically assume her allegation is truth and if so then why do we need an investigation we may as well convict at that point.
@ChrisCuomo You are right on this first thing I agree with but you are missing one part of it. The alleged victim because if it is an allegation then everything is alleged until a conclusion has been come to. How we get there I still do not know
@SenKamalaHarris But again you are a politician so you are PLAYING POLITIC
@SenKamalaHarris How could there be dozens of witnesses when the accuser only said 4 people were there oh no she said 3 or was it 5 But it was not dozens. As for people who can speak to credibility both sides you have that so it is a push. You are an attorney you do not win this case period
@brianstelter @ChrisCuomo Okay from your side YES &amp; other side ABOUT DENYING HIM! NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE FORD OR THE ALLEGATION! STOP BEING BIAS. If so go get a blog &amp; get off CNN
@ShannonBream So what I'm understanding is this lawyer is providing ALL FRIENDS OF THE ACCUSER who can attest to credibility but baked in is BIAS that these are all friends that is coming forward on her behalf on a he said she said&amp;no evidence to support what is being said And this is a Lawyer
@ShannonBream Last I check the accuser does not get to tell the FBI how to conduct an investigation. Also if she is so interested why don't we have the therapist notes as of yet?
@tamaraholder @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski Why? Is it becuz she did not provide her therapist notes? I feel u r so BIAS&amp;BLINDED by this that u r not even willing to look at another view point. SMH! Expected more from you being that you have a law back ground. Not so much as this is regarding the law but sense of fairness
@tamaraholder @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski Why because she would not provide her therapist notes? I feel you are so BIAS &amp;blinded by your own personal experience that you cannot see any other point of view!
@ChrisCuomo But I do not agree in the manner in which the president said what he did but as for the words &amp; what he was actually saying SPOT ON!
@ChrisCuomo What he said I have NO PROBLEM WITH IT! The manner in which he said it I do not like. I am now at this point of the believe that FORD LIED! If I was on a jury I would not believe her base on evidence &amp; her word as of today. I do not see her as a victim or survivor.
@ChrisCuomo Again judges are HUMAN just like the rest of us SO THAT MEANS THEY ARE FLAWED LIKE THE REST OF US! There are 8 justice right now I venture if we would dig just as hard as we are now we would find something flawed that YOU may say is unfitting of being a justice. Come one CHRIS!

@keljos22 @AnneOnimus @danacary @lisamurkowski @SenFeinstein I'm in favor of BK&amp;I hope she votes for him but if I'm to send her a message on that I can do it separately from this. This tweet is about some good work that is done. Now not to play politics but more often it is the Reps reaching over&amp;not the Dems wish I could see reciprocation
@tamaraholder I am beginning to look at you in a different way and it is NOT PLEASANT! You GENERALIZE as if this is mutually of all men, ESPECIALLY WHITE MEN! Then you go further to play identity politics have sub groups. Sad thing is you have followers that will read this and buy in.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder All of the LOOSE ALLEGATION! SO NO NOT AS OF YET &amp; MAY NOT EVER.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder WOW! What disparaging comment have i made against you? &amp; I explained I am not yelling at all just putting emphasis on point I want to make. But again perception especially when you are just reading a text rather than speaking to the person to hear &amp; understand all the r saying.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder How do you know this? I do not know him or his family! Do not think you do either. DO you?
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder &amp; get no where on this. Good chat wish you well We shall see how this circus all play out.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder &amp;Keep in mind even though I believe he didn't do this I'm still open minded to the possibility that he did but NOTHING THUS FAR TO CHANGE MY MIND! You on the other hand well you r dug in so I'm not going to debate this any further we will both sound like 1 of the network programs
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder No way to gage or tell who is telling the truth or remembering things accurately or have an ax to grind with either side. Heck it is difficult to get eye witness account of a crime that just took place. You get conflicting statement all the time so it comes down to WE DO NOT KNOW
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder From the report I have seen it was but lets say it was not because again the reports are not gospel. Still it is a loose case NO HARD EVIDENCE TO BACK ANYTHING UP AND if you are going to mention witnesses then that is out the window they both have witnesses.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder That is like saying if you are innocent you should take the stand and testify and if you don't then you must be guilty. Does not work that way but in court of public opinion I guess it does for you.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder That is not how the law works but court of pubic opinion is different so if you view him as guilty then that is fine your opinion just do not agree &amp; you have little to back it up.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Read what I said it is NOT ON HIM TO CALL FOR IT &amp; BECAUSE HE DID NOT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE HIM GUILTY! Many people do not give dna sample to rule themselves out of the possibility &amp; they are innocent.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder try to stop his confirmation. But that is my opinion NOT FACT! As for skin in the game I would like to see BK on the court but if not then LIFE MOVES ON FOR ME! NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I do happen to feel I am right in my opinions but difference is I also acknowledge it is only opinion and I can be wrong. I do not get that from you. So I see you as being deeply rooted in being against BK. even if he is exonerated I feel the Dems would still play a spin game &amp;
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Not yelling at all. If we were face to face you would see it. I CAPS TO PUT EMPHASIS. I would not yell as you
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder So have I there is a sea of people out there. So YES you will get many different opinions. But according to you there is ONLY ONE!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I am not arguing that many did not see it the way you did. Of course they did but MANY ALSO SAW IT DIFFERENTLY. Been saying it all along subjective but you are pushing your OPINION OR VIEW OF IT AS FACT WHEN IT IS NOT!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Well going by the thread looking at the message you sent u discussed him being belligerent and the fight I made mention the we dont know the circumstance we were not there then your reply was it is to be decided by a court So forgive me if I thought u were referring to the fight
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Polygraph w/just two question not enough for me sorry but I see it is for u. Also her evidence she has what is it&amp;pass it on to the FBI. ALso u r assuming that the evidence she has is credible or would prove her case again assuming it would WE DON'T KNOW. R U IN LAW ENDFORCEMENT
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Could of happened if the USA people got there head out of there you know what. Even this is politicized&amp;both parties enjoy it because it is red vs blue or D vs R and as long as they keep us locked in on that the both win &amp; take turns at control &amp;power. Who looses AMERICAN PEOPLE
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder That is what a lot of talking heads are feeding the public right now. Even if that is true then unfortunate because we still need proof, evidence before we say YES HE IS GUILTY OF THIS! Well for me anyways apparently not so for you.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I am not and never claimed to be. Not sure what the point of that comment is? Have you?
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder but NOT GOING TO JUDGE A MAN OR PUNISH HIM FOR SOMETHING WE DO NOT KNOW &amp; MAY NEVER WILL FOR CERTAIN OR BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT which you are not being.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Again you bring in the politics of it. But these are all loose allegations but I am not going to rehash them, they dont even deserve mentioning. Nothing to back them up. But if there is and they are found then I will entertain it and look at it.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I have yet to bring the politic into it. I have only answered it when you bring it up.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Again YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT! YOU ARE GIVING YOUR OPINION WHICH IS FINE BUT A BIT LACKING FOR MY TASTE. I do not THINK HE DID IT, BUT I DO KNOW KNOW FOR SURE &amp; WILL NEVER KNOW! He said she said ALL THE WAY AROUND EVEN FROM SO CALLED WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Oh there we go temperament,  well last I check judges even supreme court judges are STILL HUMAN! And in that moment he was not a judge he was someone accused defending themselves. It is called being human.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I never called he names only question he credibility which is fair game &amp; again jumping on he is your characterization which is subjective.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder No response to this I can't anymore with you
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder But here is one should she be investigated to see if her allegations is true or if she is lying? You answer is probably not because OH SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH BECAUSE SHE SAID SO!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Well first of all it is not for him to call an investigation. People who are accused do not call for investigations on themselves ESPECIALLY LOOSE ACCUSATIONS! Furthermore have you read ALL SIX BACK GROUND INVESTIGATION ON HIM! AGAIN YOUR BIAS AT WORK! He defended himself.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder It was on National TV yes but many did not see it the way you did. See this is the problem you ONLY WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU WANT &amp; NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT VIEW POINT OR PERSPECTIVE ON SOMETHING. Sound much like the Dem. party. Again STILL SUBJECTIVE!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder A supposed bar fight where he did not even get arrested would not go to a court to impeach him? You are dreaming.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I would still feel the same way. You accuse someone you should face them &amp; produce evidence of what they did.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Not at all because I AM NOT A REPUBLICAN AT ALL! I think it is a big fat game REP. &amp; DEMS play with the country &amp; voters so it has nothing to do with POLITICAL PARTY! I ACTUALLY WOULD LOVE IF WE COULD GET A LEGITIMATE THIRD PARTY! &amp; had it been the way you described
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Neither could she but I guess she is credible. Could not remember when where how she got there or got home.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I accepted both Pres. Obama justices he nominated &amp; the third that did not get on.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder BY HARD WORK! &amp; WHAT HE IS ACCUSED OF THERE IS NOTHING TO BACK IT UP. So I wont try to convince you because your mind is made up but I have listened and heard all the angle, reasons &amp; statements &amp; gamed them out or entertained them &amp; still do not see why we should not have him.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder YOU DO NOT WANT BK BECAUSE YOU FEEL END OF THE WORLD WILL COME IF HE GETS CONFIRMED. &amp; MANY ON THE RIGHT WANTS HIM BECAUSE ALL WILL BE RIGHT IN THE WORLD IF HE IS CONFIRMED! Nonsense I say! The man deserves it because you do not get to this level by accident or cheating.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Or we can say this cooked loose vague allegation that Dems held like the ace in the pocket rather than responsible elected officials. but again we can do this all night and point fingers but it boils down to this
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder The tit for tat game that both Reps &amp; Dems play but I suppose you are going to tell me Dems don't but the Reps do.?
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder That is you and how you see it! Not everyone does. He is being painted &amp; portrayed in a manner in which he see as false so he is reacting to it. You may not do the same but doe not make you or him wrong
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Because you wont behave like him or disapprove do not make him or his actions wrong. Maybe you are allowing bias to get in the way of your judgement which is fine You are not a judge and we all do it as humans.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Again perception, THAT IS YOUR VIEW OF HIS BEHAVIOR! NOT FACT! There are others that feel he behaved as someone who has been accused of something with NOTHING TO BACK IT UP &amp; He is being tried for it! Court of public opinion.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Who is W?
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I am not asking you too but YOU DID &amp; YOU VIEW HIM A MODERATE! Again something that is subjective. No right or wrong answer. But the point is He did not nominate a conservative nor did Pres. Clinton
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder that event we do not know because we were not there, so was he the aggressor or not these are important questions
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Well one fight and now you view it as he fights. He drinks or drank a lot I know many in my high school days that drank a lot and did not make them an alcholic or angry, well some of them were not all. And he did not deny drinking and the fight well all that is surrounding
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Doesn't remember where, or yr it happened or how she got there or got home. &amp;you call that credible. I don't but again that is a matter that is totally subjective but to be fair you have to produce some evidence in order to be taken seriously or if not then we ALL CAN MAKE CLAIMS
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder It is because it is the easiest one to pick or get at.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder ABSOLUTELY I AGREE THE SHOULD HAVE GIVE GARLAND A VOTE I WOULD NOT ARGUE THAT! BUT WE ENDED UP HERE I FEEL Because of Harry Reid lowering the bar for number of votes. Had he not this sort of thing would not be happening today.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder I wont debate how he responded other than to say he was being human. Also he not getting in on Friday HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW HE BEHAVED. It was pure POLITICS AT PLAY, ON BOTH SIDES
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder See that is your perception if it and you are not wrong because there are many ways to look at his behavior. Had he been meek and mild then there would be some saying no emotion he must be guilty because normal people do not act that way. Many ways to view it so
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Exactly! You just made my point. Pres. Obama did not go and appoint a conservative justice. Bush did not appoint a liberal justice and we can go on and on. But once there they follow the law on both sides. Or should &amp; that can be another debate
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Well we can begin with flying. That is the low hanging fruit.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Not spinning just talking facts.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder You do not know that first of all and secondly if it get there you do not know for sure how BK will vote. Case in point Kennedy voted against Cons. in many cases. Should not be about left or right but the law!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder WHO DO YOU THINK PRES. TRUMP was going to nominate a LIBERAL JUDGE?
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder See again the politics of it rather than the matter itself. So it is not about BK and the women it is really about you I presume &amp; the liberals I know for sure that does not want BK to acend because of what is sold to them by Dem. politicians.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder We DON'T KNOW THAT HE IS LYING NOT YET ANYWAYS! And that is not me implying he is or is not. Just saying that is unknown
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Okay I am willing to discuss it GAME ON! ONLY IF WE CAN DISCUSS THE LIE THAT FORD IS TELLING SINCE WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT OF LYING.
@Doodisgirl @AMPRo1219 SMH! This is rich!
@KatiePavlich SPOT ON! I feel like I am living an alternate reality or in a bad eps. of the twilight zone or something. They keep switching &amp; how people just forget and play along is astonishing! Am I living in the land of SHEEP where people just play along like mindless robots? SMH!
@tamaraholder SMH!
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder So take your dramatic BOOM and chew on that.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder by any means necessary for politics because Dem Politicians has scared them about abortion &amp; many issues that may not even come before the court of if it does the court may not even hear them. BK judicial record is one of success with many decisions held by the supreme court.
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder he lied under oath then that IS WRONG &amp; NOT RIGHT AT ALL! But 1 we do not know that as of yet. I do not take any media report as gospel left or right&amp; 2 I am willing call balls balls &amp; strikes strikes. Not sure about you but MANY aren't they are just willing to do whatever
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder someone defending themselves to ask people to come forward as character witnesses. Now how do you get that to a lie or conspiracy or obstruction I do not know but knock yourself out! Now if there is a direct text from him making mention of the Debbie Ramirez allegations &amp;
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder If these supposed text that is between Kerry Berchem &amp;Karen Yarasavage  it is reported that there was a conversation with BK &amp; Karen Yarasavage &amp; she is communicating what was discussed to Kerry. Now He was supposedly asking her to testify on his behalf which is not uncommon for
@IndivisibleInFL @danlybarger @tamaraholder Well if you look at it purely that way surely you get one answer but if I was robbed then YES I AM AGAINST MY ROBBER &amp; ROBBERY But if someone claims they were robbed and can say what was taken, when, &amp;or who then ofcourse I will have doubts even if I had been robbed in the past.
@ChrisCuomo Here is a question HOW DO YOU DETERMINE HE LIED? AGAIN the witnesses on both sides how do you know they are accurate about what they say or telling the truth?
RT @brithume: Besides, he never said he didn’t pass out. He said he didn’t black out. Big difference. https://t.co/aiwJoKFaft
@ChrisCuomo Okay now you call upon credibility STILL IT COMES DOWN TO WHO DO YOU WANT TO BELIEVE because witnesses on both sides will say what they want and NO WAY TO GET TO THE TRUTH ABSOLUTE TRUTH ON THIS! EVERY CASE you make is WEAK! ON THIS!
@ChrisCuomo YOU ARE LOOSING ME! You said the Pres. Trump is playing IDENTITY POLITICS! ESPECIALLY SINCE WE ARE DISCUSSING THE BK MATTER! That is a bit rich coming from you. I would like to think you are a MODERATE LIBERAL&amp;your brother is one&amp;that is ALL THEY DO, IDENTITY POLITICS
@ABCPolitics SPOT ON!
@Lennar 11
@FoxNews @SenFeinstein Well coming from their logic we should just believe her but yet someone should call for an investigation perhaps since THEY LIKE INVESTIGATIONS SO MUCH!
@Madge5656 @megynkelly @AP MeTOO LOL!
@jessknight72 @megynkelly @AP We do not know if she is a victim, she claims to be one but we do not know! That is your belief but no concrete evidence or any beyond a reasonable doubt. It's like saying someone rob me but I cannot say what they took when they took it or where they took it from&amp;yet I'm a victim
@pugsandco @megynkelly @AP YUP, PRETTY MUCH IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING! NEW STANDARD! URL
@erimarcroft1 @megynkelly @AP determine credibility. I happen to believe this is true but I am also open minded enough to say WHAT IF THIS IS NOT TRUE. Only way to be fair otherwise you are JUST BEING BIAS
@erimarcroft1 @megynkelly @AP Why? Because she is not espousing what you want to hear? This is one story that she retweeted that we all will look at &amp; decide for our selves being that this is tried in the court of public opinion right now. But you should at least be willing to consider everything &amp;

@BombshellNana @tamaraholder @megynkelly @NBCNews @FoxNews I stand with survivors as well but I would like to make sure they are in fact survivors &amp; not playing me. I would hope you would like the same as well as the MeToo
@WestergrenMike @tamaraholder People keep saying that but IT IS, for all of us THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION! Wise man once told me that if you just take someones at their word without anything to back it up YOU ARE MAKE YOURSELF TO BE PLAYED AS A FOOL!
@danlybarger @tamaraholder Oh so you are saying she should allow her own situation that has NOTHING TO DO W/THE PARTICULAR STORY INFLUENCE HER SENSE OF FAIRNESS &amp; JUDGEMENT?! Just asking because. That is like saying if I was robbed by a woman then I side w/anyone who claims to be robbed by a woman. SMH!
@tamaraholder WHY?
@mog7546 who have been investigate 6 times yet nothing. It is possible he could of done it but no way of knowing this with what we know so far. Sorry CANNOT PROVE A THING!
@mog7546 I happen to believe he is innocent but that is me &amp;yet I am willing to game this out every which way to get answer &amp; NONE IS TO BE HAD CONCRETELY OR BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT! So it comes down to what do you believe &amp; going upon that to deny a man w/exemplary record
@mog7546 Also you do not know if anyone has an ax to grind w/either of them to sway that individuals testimony or statement rather. So it is all nebulous at best &amp; you cannot come away w/a conclusive answer or even one that is beyond reasonable doubt.
@mog7546 NO YOU CANNOT!! Here is why, you can question all the witness but the issue is how good are their memory. Also being that this is played out on TV now for about 2-3wks no way to tell if they are influenced by the media circus &amp; social police activist or those on the right.
@SebGorka @SenFeinstein LMBO! PRICELESS! But he should have never said Ford was or seemed credible. SHE DID NOT!

@MeToo_Affairs It should be! Why should they take a second go at him when they have 6 times already! Also THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER INVESTIGATED THIS!
@MeToo_Affairs That is a belief which is fine to have BUT NOT PROVEN FACT! Also FORD IS A LIAR! THAT IS A FACT WE DO KNOW ABOUT HER FLYING!
@rosscc @lawrencemn @ReformedWriter @TaylorRae80 @ShannonBream @senjudiciary CAMCORDER STRAPPED TO THEIR SHOULDERS for an evening of drinking. SO NO PHOTOS OR VIDEO. I SAID THIS IN THE VERY BEGINNING EVEN IF THIS DID HAPPEN UNFORTUNATELY THEIR IS NO JUSTICE TO BE ATTAINED! System is not perfect especially in this instance.
@rosscc @lawrencemn @ReformedWriter @TaylorRae80 @ShannonBream @senjudiciary And this you can do with every person that gives a statement &amp;it comes down to who do you want to believe but FACT! EVIDENCE WE DO NOT HAVE. BACK IN 82 or what ever yr it was there were no camera phones &amp; highschool kids were not walking around w/ big cameras or
@rosscc @lawrencemn @ReformedWriter @TaylorRae80 @ShannonBream @senjudiciary It is going to be a lot of he said &amp; she said even from the witnesses. Did that lady MsKeyser drink that night, how good is her memory? Is she bias because Ford is her friend? Has see been sexually assaulted/rape or someone close to her have?
@rosscc @lawrencemn @ReformedWriter @TaylorRae80 @ShannonBream @senjudiciary I am w/you&amp;agree but my whole point is objectively looking at this THERE IS NO WAY YOU INVESTIGATE THIS&amp;COME BACK W/A CONCLUSIVE RESULT FOR EITHER SIDE. All you have is valid arguments either way but THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONDEMN A MAN OR DENY HIM WHAT HE HAS WORKED SO LONG FOR
@CountryFirst84 @NYGovCuomo TIRED OF THESE DEMS THEY DO THIS TO SEEM MORAL PURE AND SUPERIOR ALL THE WHILE THROWING REASONING &amp; COMMONSENSE OUT THE WINDOW!

@ChrisCuomo Not helpful because asking people question based on the calendar is a toss up because people may or may not remember or perhaps from pressure of the whole situation answer in his favor to help him or not in his favor to get at him. THE CALENDAR IS OUT POINTLESS AT THIS TIME!

@John_Kass Even if the investigation report comes back CLEARING HIM! One can &amp;WOULD ARGUE it is insufficient &amp; tainted! That argument is for either way the investigation comes back. SAD!!!!
@John_Kass As well as those witnesses political believes/bias may play a role. So if it was near impossible to get to the truth before NOW IT IS 20x harder to do that. Sen.Flake who is Flaking in his last months as a senator &amp; the Rep. party just delivered a GUT PUNCH to BK.
@John_Kass public being able to manipulate it. Now they go speak to witnesses those witnesses have already heard everything from bothsides so who is to say if they are telling the truth. Or remembering accurately, or if what they've heard over the last 2-3wks is influencing their statements
@John_Kass See no one is mentioning this. An investigation NOW IS WORSE THAN IF IT WAS DONE 2-3wks ago. Back then we did not know as much as we know now meaning ALL OF US! So the investigator had a bit of advantage &amp; perhaps could source out what they are seeking which is truth w/out the
@KirstenPowers I would say innocent till proven guilty even in a job interview or the court of public opinion
@KirstenPowers WELL WE ARE LOOSING OUR CIVILITY! As a civil society there are some principals that we all hold (or should) true. Treat others as you would like to be treated, make a mistake own up too it &amp;make amends better to give than receive, respect your elders &amp;
@KirstenPowers IN SPITE OF HOW I BELIEVE I ALSO DO KNOW &amp; RECOGNIZE IT IS POSSIBLE HE DID THIS! Just unfortunate we will not be able to get to this answer. So this all comes down to belief but to deny someone a position because of a simple allegation that is loose &amp;vague NO HARD EVIDENCE!
@KirstenPowers All of this convolutes the situation. There is no way to get to a conclusive answer on this unless the story change &amp; their is more. My personal opinion is this woman lied &amp;BK is innocent BUT I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT &amp; I could be wrong.
@KirstenPowers that may or may not remember &amp; their credibility also in question &amp; ability to remember accurately&amp; their own motives as to if they have an ax to grind or not want to be publicly shamed for what is perceived as taking a side depend on their statement for either one of them.
@KirstenPowers I say that is the proper way. But to hold it for 30+ yrs. then come out with POOR TIMING (Not that there is ever a good time) from a motive perspective view of it &amp; have no evidence other than he said she said not just from the accused&amp; the accuser but also supposed witnesses
@KirstenPowers THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IN GENERAL UNTIL PROVEN! Not just w/women but IN ALL CASES! WE DO NOT TAKE WOMEN'S WORD AS ABSOLUTION IN THESE CASES OR ANY OTHER. Once they come forward then we don't believe them or disbelieve them but rather take what they say seriously &amp;investigate.
@KirstenPowers One can argue they are the BEST AT IT BETWEEN THE TWO SEXES! Now putting my own feelings aside from this at the moment &amp; look at it objectively, First an environment needs to be created where women can come forward &amp; make their claim&amp;
@KirstenPowers Wow! And her you are playing identity politics in the same. No one that is fair minded is saying or will ever say women do not have a voice but if we are GOING TO HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS let's not pretend that WOMEN DO NOT LIE!
@RitaCosby So you believe what you want depending on which side you are on. But a clear answer on what happen or if he did or did not do this NO WAY YOU GET A CLEAR ANSWER ON THAT 2wks back &amp; ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY NOT NOW!
@RitaCosby Also how good are their memories? No matter how this investigation plays out BK is forever tainted in the public eye because of the DAMAGE THE DEMS, &amp; MEDIA HAS DONE&amp; NOW WHAT THE REPS ARE GOING ALONG &amp;DOING! There is no way to get to a conclusive answer on this.
@RitaCosby So people who may not remember may not say something because of the influence of this case &amp; perhaps their own bias or politics or some old score to settle. Or against the accuser because they do not like how this process is which on either side is not right.
@RitaCosby  Even if they do it will be TAINTED! Typically when an investigation is done the subjects/witnesses do not know what the investigator is coming with? What they are trying to archive or accomplish. With this EVERYONE KNOW!
@RitaCosby I think what Jeff &amp; the Reps did was utterly STUPID and damaging to BK. If they were going to do this investigation they should of did so 2wks ago &amp;they did not but after all of this being played out for the WORLD TO SEE! The investigation is going to get to NOTHING!
@JeffFlake Also gives Dem another reason to twist this when report comes back that it was not long enough or some other reason. I do not make a habit of name call and I am not but what you did was DUMB! &amp; SPINELESS! No other way to describe it.
@JeffFlake TYPICALLY WHEN AN INVESTIGATION IS DONE THE INVESTIGATORS QUESTIONS WITNESSES WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE LINE OF QUESTIONING IS ABOUT OR WHAT THE OBJECTIVE IS! To do this now DOES NEITHER SIDE GOOD!
@JeffFlake Perhaps someone got something against BK or the accuser and will give answers to do either of them in. Or perhaps the never had memory &amp;because of this influence them to answer a certain way.
@JeffFlake See the thing is this has been played out all over the news so the FBI which is NOT the proper authorities to handle this but they will go question folk. Those people already know what is coming &amp;answers can be influenced.
@JeffFlake Shame on you for what you did, calling for an investigation. I hope you get to experience a SMALL MEASURE of what BK &amp;his family is going through! What you did is rail road this man. Calling for an investigation now IS EVEN WORSE THAN HAVING ONE 2-3weeks back.
@FoxNews @KamalaHarris but the principal of innocent till proven guilty is a principal not only in our court rooms but in our society at the job, homes, church, ball park, it is everywhere.
@FoxNews @KamalaHarris KH you are a former AG for California so YOU KNOW THE LAW &amp; I am sure you know it goes beyond what you belief but rather prove. Also Innocent till proven Guilty. I am sure if Douglas was in this position you would want him to get a fair shake. I know it is a job interview
@secupp The unfortunate thing here is that the elected officials we elected to speak on our behalf because they supposedly are the ones among us that knows best HANDLED THIS POORLY ON BOTH SIDES! I am at this point of the belief the Dems gamed this &amp;politicized it.
@secupp But rather I listen and TAKE WHAT YOU SAY SERIOUSLY &amp; INVESTIGATE IT THOROUGHLY!
@secupp got their life together. So I would still vote him in. I am not saying this to make light of sexual assault but to say that WE REALLY NEED PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD WHEN THIS HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY &amp; NO it is not just I BELIEVE YOU!
@secupp Lets game this out and say he did it well he has lived a life of someone you would want to. So lets say he was captured back then and arrested and found guilty and was then released the way he has lived his life up to now we would be praising him for someone who turned it around
@secupp For me it is very simple, something this long ago &amp;no evidence we will get no where. EVEN w/an investigation done it is witnesses from both sides giving what is their best recollection of what happen or who they believe or character of the person.
@AndyOstroy @secupp @NYDailyNews should of gone to the Police/FBI about this if she really wanted too.
@AndyOstroy @secupp @NYDailyNews The onus is on the accuser. He does not have to call for anything&amp;that does not make him guilty. The appearance of it is 1 of perception which is totally fine but STILL doesnt mean he is guilty. It's the job of the senate to call for these things&amp;also the accuser can&amp;
@christoffel17 @ChrisCuomo @angela_rye Showing her some grace? HUH? Okay an investigation could have been done done with out her name being released. At least looking into the matter or time period. Not a word was uttered about his drinking or time at college or issues with women in private or public hearings.
@christoffel17 @ChrisCuomo @angela_rye Yes. Also it is not a federal matter to be taken into court it is a state matter. But if she wanted one couldn't she have gone straight to them? Also how do you want to remain anonymous but yet still have an investigation on your allegations
@ChrisCuomo You tonight have been so onesided&amp;all the while try to come off as objective. Game this out &amp;U STILL DO NOT GET TO CONCLUSIVE RESULTS! Also NO ONE IS A PARAGON OF INTEGRITY! We r all Men&amp;Women HUMAN INHERENTLY FLAWED! Hope u do better because u r starting to loose me.
@ChrisCuomo Watching you in this topic has been disgusting. Primetime the special I saw OBJECTIVITY That is why I have faithfully watching at 9pm. MY TV IS ON CNN AT (pm like clock work. But on this BK you have been so bias.
@ChrisCuomo @angela_rye Sen. Diane had the letter &amp;could have called for one and DID NOT! I get it you are a liberal and a Dems. but that is not an excuse for putting on blinders and being so BIAS!
@ChrisCuomo @angela_rye First of all you speak in absolution that what is alleged happened actually did YOU NOR THE GUEST YOU GIVE ATTITUDE TOO WAS NOT THERE! Next it is not for BK to agree too or ask for an investigation &amp;all the Dems. party you support well
@LawandOrderSVU1 So we automatically believe them? THat is contrast to what the show is about. You investigate to see if it is true and build the case. &amp; Usually the women in the eps. provide evidence or crime scene or something to go on. I'm also sure there are times where there are false claims
@ChrisCuomo You ask if the Reps win with this SCOTUS Nomination could it cost them in midterms. Fair question but again SLANTED! Becuz can't it also cost the Dems 4 doing what could possibly appear as political theater or hit job&amp;using this woman 4it? There r many that see it so
@ChrisCuomo Even on your crusade of integrity come on CHRIS! You have conflicting statements from several people who knew him at the time. Some give contrast statement and some give similar statements to BK so it comes down to which or what you want to believe. Even out of court
@brianefallon Becarefull of what you wish because 2018 is here and what you wish for others may come to you. Perhaps Dems will not win this mid term. You are SO BIAS &amp; ONE SIDED YOU DO NOT EVEN GIVE ROOM TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT! Also be careful calling BK a rapist, that maybe slander
@ChrisCuomo Not because we disagree because you are not telling the whole story.
@ChrisCuomo You are being so bias that it is upsetting. When the senate did question MJudge the dems had the opportunity to be a part of that and ask the questions the wanted to. All this was today was political theater. And you a taking part in it as well.
@ChrisCuomo How do we get to the truth? Is it based on who is more convincing? You have been VERY PARTIAL IN THIS WHOLE THING!
@ChrisCuomo Okay so you are a litigator and argue for a living lets examine this once again. I believe your assessment is wrong. Ms.Brooks how do we know she is telling the truth or just giving her assessment of it and that is from one prospective.

@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I said this from the very onset of this who thing. Sometime justice escapes up &amp; it cannot be had. Justice is blind &amp; it is for a reason. Statues of limitations are there for a reason. I hope at the end of all of this
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo as well the law is written on MANY PRINCIPALS WE HOLD HIGH! So if this is the case then why shouldn't many of the same principals we hold in a court be that same as we do in our lives just as how the courts take many principals we hold near to us in every day life &amp; apply them.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE TRULY OBJECTIVE. So it comes down to who do you believe. I get it many people say this is a job interview not a court of law but MANY OF US TAKE TO THE SAME PRINCIPALS THAT OUR LAWS ARE WRITTEN! As a matter of fact it is the other way around in many cases
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo corroborating his side of events. You speak of perjury well there is a lot of I do not recall on his side &amp; the accusers well they give very loose &amp; vague stories that would be hard to pin done on a lie. So we are at a stale mate on this.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Drinking at a young age as &amp; such a long time ago as well as the political environment we are in. So who is to say these folks are not saying things out of political bias or motivation. And that is for both sides because he also has folk speaking up for him &amp;

@ChrisCuomo If any evidence is presented then perhaps BK will have to answer and even then he does not. Perception is just that perception. We all as humans get fooled with it all the time.
@ChrisCuomo you are not making the claim. Nor are you responsible for anything. So BK do not have to request a FBI investigation or ask for hearing on this matter unless he is questioned about it. This is way sometime the defendant does not take the stand because sometime they do not have to
@ChrisCuomo Chris you know the answer to this the burden is always on the accused. If someone shout a ludicrous statement about you then it is up to me to believe it if I want to w/out proof &amp;that would make me a FOOL but the responsibility is not on you to respond or say anything because

@DanaBordeaux @KimStrassel So true. If they can deal with them doesn't appear that way.
@csvintagecool @sandeecarlisle @KimStrassel And many on the right says he did not. I do not know if he did or did not do it but I presume innocence till proven otherwise and ask sensible question to form opinions. I do not see how you get to yes he did beyond reasonable doubt.
@BShtick @TPM That is what you or anyone would want in this situation. Glad for the exchange &amp; would gladly do it again.
@BShtick @TPM Well I feel the same. I am for one going to wait and see. This next claim like the first in my opinion lacks corroboration based on what we know thus far. But we shall see. Lets reserve judgement &amp; reserve presumption of innocence till proven otherwise.

@SenFeinstein The FBI can investigate if they choose which you NEVER CALLED FOR PRIOR! As a matter of fact you knew of the allegations and did not even raise a question about the subject matter. Not necessarily the individuals or that instance but in general as to any inappropriate behavior.

@BShtick @TPM This allegation is not a credible on as far as I see and yet I am looking at it seriously.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon Or if it takes a long time he is proven innocent and Dems take control and not vote him in all on the account of an allegation.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon Fair point about the haste but the same can be said of for putting him in and then while doing the investigation. Lets go with you, lets postpone it and it takes 3 days I am sure the argument will be it is not enough or what kind of investigation would it be.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon See now you are making this about politics than what this is about. Also you think that which you can but do not know. Kennedy did not vote along ideological line all the time.
@BShtick @TPM IT IS TRUE THOUGH. That nasty word precedent. Why not?
@BShtick @TPM It is but next go round then anyone can do the same for what ever reason. Not the way this is suppose to play out. Sorry setting bad example.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon That is what you are speculating or perhaps hoping for. Rather than assume the best of a person perhaps you assume the worse. I make no decisions either way.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon That is subjective but I think he is fit, he would not even be considered if he was not unless you are saying the vetting of the FBI 6times over is not valid or credible.
@BShtick @TPM What the GOP did was wrong but it has nothing to do with this. Unless you are playing politics. I am not unless you are telling me this woman is playing politics. Approve him and confirm investigate him impeach him if he is guilty
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon She made an allegation and this has been put out for public consumption where many will judge either way before the facts come out.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon I agree the confirmation hearing may not be the venue but also going to the post, was the the proper venue as well rather than straight to the FBI? Also guilt till proven innocence is not a distraction it is the heart of these matters or where are we?
@BShtick @TPM Still we have to wait and see. We do not know what she has to say? If she has any proof. Again we must not rush to judgement. I do not have Kavanaugh as guilty. Innocent till proven guilty.
@MichaelAvenatti If this is done as you would like what do you say to the accused if it is proven they are innocent. Oh well I am sorry! What do you say?
@MichaelAvenatti You are playing politics. You are an attorney you know (or suppose to know how these things work) withdraw because an allegation is made? I guess if a woman or man made an allegation against you today you should have your Law License pulled? Not how it work or should work.
@BShtick @TPM so we should take it serious &amp; listen to her. Then after that take proper course of action. What ever that maybe. Lets see if she has anything else to add other than what she has said so far?
@BShtick @TPM Last I check the FBI does not need consent from the senate to look into a criminal matter so to put that on them is wrong. And maybe you can't but I can. And to bring politics in to this is shameful on Dems &amp; Reps. and I guess you are following suit. A woman says she was attacked
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon Lets look at the later. How is he unsuitable? He has a record that has got him here to this point. Each step along the way he has been grilled&amp;had his life under a microscope to ensure fitness for the position. Now we are here&amp;no evidence at all even to this pt w/the allegation
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon &amp; one wants to prevent them from getting the job all they have to do is make an allegation with no proof?
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon I did the first time and stand by what I said. even if not in a court room. As a society do we assume guilt until innocence can be proven? It is not even a question but allegation with no corroboration thus far. So each time a person goes for a job
@SANDRAELLENK @Meka_Moo89 @snowstar444 @Mariska No one is saying believe the accused (you said abuser and that has to be proven first) but they have presumption of innocence. SHould they not?
@SANDRAELLENK @Meka_Moo89 @snowstar444 @Mariska I am definitely with you that it should change to allow people who are abused or assulted or worse can come forward. That does not mean we believe them automatically just means we show respect &amp; examine the allegations. In examining the allegations means we ask tough questions
@MMFlint WOW! So according to you Guilty till proven innocent even if you believe her still need evidence. Looks like this is SLANDER!
RT @TomCottonAR: .@SenFeinstein give us a break. @ChuckGrassley has bent over backwards to hear her story. By contrast, you had her letter…
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon but to deny him is to say you are guilty now prove your innocence.
@brainbootcamp @brianefallon Just as it is to just delay or not appoint him because a simple allegation is made with no evidence to back it up. Inappropriate is subjective. To have him there and investigate is not wrong or a problem in my view. Should there be evidence there to bring him to trail then we do
@BShtick @TPM I am not concerned about the GOP or Dems. But you keep mentioning them rather than the issue at hand which is an alleged crime &amp; getting to justice.
@BShtick @TPM Here is another one for you, this lady has attorneys the can call on the FBI themselve. The FBI does not have to wait on the Senate to investigate an alleged crime. But again here you are playing politics with it.
@IndigoTwinkle I am on board but nothing but one side vs the other how is that fair. WHat happens when the time someone makes an allegation that is untrue and no evidence to corroborate and we convict the accused because the accused SEEMS credible or believable?
@IndigoTwinkle As state before we need to make it so people can feel comfortable to come forward right away. But not reporting and then 30+ years later I just do not know how we attain justice beyond reasonable doubt without evidence. DNA or other material then yes
@IndigoTwinkle If a report was issued then at least we have something to go on. Or a record of an attempt to report but we have nothing thus far. Now if an attempt to report was made and nothing was done that is horrible.
@BShtick @TPM but you also do not have any corroborating evidence of this but do not need one for an investigation. But again i want to put the NASTY POLITICS aside and look at what we have so far. Only a limited amount of FACTS that adds up to NOTHING on both sides so far.
@BShtick @TPM NO think for a second, if she wanted one she could have gone to the FBI and report a crime before going to anyone else. We do not know if she is under pressure from the Dems or other powers at play. Not saying that there is. Now the GOP well you are right they can call for one
@julieroginsky @FNC_Ladies_Rule Unfortunately we have this nasty political circus being played around this story.
@julieroginsky @FNC_Ladies_Rule under the influence and now. Even when a crime takes place immediately eyewitness accounts are often very different. There is no DNA evidence in question because no rape took place according to the allegation. So this is going to go NOWHERE!
@julieroginsky @FNC_Ladies_Rule Here is the thing there is no way to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Kavanaugh did this based on the facts so far. Even witnesses would not be reliable due to it being so long ago and it was a part of teen drinking. Tolorence level and how good are their memories then
@brianefallon that calendar could have been fabricated (not saying it was) or could in fact be true but does not mean he stuck to it. PROVES NOTHING! But guess what he is still innocent till proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. He does not have to prove anything it is the accuser that does.
@BShtick @TPM because he is innocent till proven otherwise beyond reasonable doubt. Laws are not made so the guilty go free but so that the innocent does.
@BShtick @TPM That to me was unfair they should of given Garland a hearing and up or down vote then that would be up to them but he should of gotten a vote. But that is immaterial at the point I am speaking strictly to the fact of what Ford is alleging &amp; how do we prove Kavanaugh is guilty
@BShtick @TPM so how do you get to the truth. The thing is a case can be made for either side but for a solid case beyond reasonable doubt for an impartial person to judge with no politics involved, HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT! I do not see it. Do you?
@BShtick @TPM Mark Judge has said he does not remember Fords account. but again even if he is lying there is no way for us to tell. Memories has faded. IE hers which cannot accurately tell the year date time or where. Same can be said for him&amp;other if there are others
@BShtick @TPM Well 6 times his life have been dug through and nothing has come up but in the interest of fairness YES lets look into this. But to hold this up is not fair without any corroborating evidence. They can still investigate him even after confirmation.
@IndigoTwinkle @Mariska WHAT? So it is your belief that anyone that lays this kind of claim we should just believe them? If so Gee I hope none of the people you know and love gets accused.
@BShtick @TPM Looking at this from an impartial unbiased point of view. Lets say what she is alleging is true (not say it is or is not)Had this been my sister I would be heart broken because to get her justice I know it is next to impossible.
@BShtick @TPM so influence can also be at play. No reports to go on. Court of public opinion is one thing but court of law is another &amp; to prove it beyond reasonable doubt is a tall order darn near impossible JUST BASE ON WHAT IS KNOWN SO FAR.
@BShtick @TPM &amp;no rape took place so no DNA, just relying on memories of people &amp; no way to tell if those people are telling the truth or not just because it was so long ago &amp;they themselves may have been drinking. Also this story has been all over the news local &amp; national
@BShtick @TPM See in there lyes the problem. Decades later were should obtain justice for something that we do not know took place &amp;according to what we know so far there is no conclusive way of knowing. BASED ON WHAT IS KNOWN SO FAR. A party of teens, where there was drinking&amp;36/38yrs later

@brianefallon See that is JUST your belief NOT FACT! Even if it is not a court of law it is in our govt. system. So to just deny someone a position becuz an accusation has be alleged we that would set up for much or the same to come weather true or untrue. He can be voted in still investigate
@BShtick @TPM Also one has to ask if an investigation is what she wants WHY GO TO THE POST, WHY WRITE YOU CONGRESS WOMAN &amp; NOT GO TO THE POLICE OR FBI. Again not being disrespectful or attacking Ford but asking QUESTION pleasant &amp;unpleasant 1s to get to the truth!
@BShtick @TPM Has he said that he does not want FBI involvement. Also there has been about 6times already.
@Meka_Moo89 @snowstar444 @Mariska Many women have sons, fathers, brother, uncles husbands&amp;men in their lives that can be accused or be victims, just as we men have women in our lives daughters, mother, sister, aunts, wives &amp;women that can be accused or be victims.
@Meka_Moo89 @snowstar444 @Mariska Sorry you went through this but here is a BIG &amp; DIFFICULT QUESTION THAT SEEMS TO BE LOCKED AWAY &amp;NOT BEING ASKED. How is justice attained if we reflexively believe the accuser &amp;do not worry or seek evidence or corroboration evidence &amp; just convict the accused?
@redtreefrog1968 @Mariska To ask questions about this even unpleasant 1s some how it's being disrespectful I don't get it. NOT BECUZ I'M A MAN becuz this happens to both men&amp;women Asking if you reported it at the time or told anyone is a natural &amp;Fair question. In an investigation it can help get to facts
@leggsmi @Mariska &amp; let the facts tell the story. Only way we have TRUE JUSTICE. We cannot just go off of one person word over another because one seem more convincing than the other &amp; this is for both sides.
@leggsmi @Mariska home many others that are wrongly convicted. People need to come forward right away when these attacks happen &amp; there needs to be an environment where the person attacked can feel comfortable to come forward. When they do we need to take it as a serious allegation&amp;investigate it
@leggsmi @Mariska maybe not if not, for people who do not know you how are we to believe you or the accused. This is the problem. I am not trying to be insensitive here but it is a valid question. Central Park 5 were innocent &amp;still went to jail I reference it because it is a famous case but
@leggsmi @Mariska Sorry this happened. I am glad there is a conversation but if we are to talk about this lets have the difficult conversation &amp;discuss it now. No two situations are the same. Should you come forward now perhaps there is evidence to support your accusation &amp;
@meganbushway15 @Mariska That is the wrong response that you should not have walked a lone while it may be some sound advice to help prevent attacks still does not excuse what happened and It may have been said in some was to excuse or minimize what happened
@Mariska when these issues arise not just RUSH TO JUDGEMENT TO SEEM MORALLY SOUND &amp; AVOID CONDEMNATION IF YOU DO NOT FALL IN LINE WITH THE SOCIAL PROTOCOL. Also SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HELP PEOPLE COME FORWARD WHEN THESE ABUSE TAKES PLACE.
@Mariska what state or mind frame was she in, was anything abnormal. How was she the following morning or day or week. We do not know if she is a survivor or not. We do not know if this is in fact true. I am not saying it is not I am asking question which is what is done
@Mariska It is still a natural question to ask because it is not an exact science and we all react to things differently SO TO ASK THE QUESTION DID YOU REPORT THIS OR TELL ANYONE IS A FAIR &amp;NATURAL QUESTION IN INVESTIGATING THIS. As well as her parents. Did they see her when she got home,

@tamaraholder If it is true, not saying it is not but on the other end of this is a man and the possibility of innocence must be there. Just an UNFORTUNATE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
@SenGillibrand Tell Senate to push Kavanaugh through. He has lived a life to be nominated so he should go through to try&amp;disqualify him on an accusation then that is a dangerous precedent you will be setting becuz I guess I can accuse you of in appropriate behavior&amp;expect you to lose your job
@ChrisCuomo That is crazy to me SORRY FOR ALL INVOLVE. Our justice system is the best but not perfect and sometimes it comes up short and this seem very much like one of those time. Not being insensitive just being real about the set of circumstance.
@ChrisCuomo Which way did they escape, how tall was the person. Now you are asking to go find people that was at a party where there was drinking involved and give an accurate account of what took place that night? And expect to come to a conclusive answer either way?
@ChrisCuomo Not saying this woman is lying. How would we ever get closer to what happened? Take for instance a crime takes place and 7 witnesses see it when police interview the witnesses often they get at least 3 to 5 conflicting stories. What the person was wearing.
@ChrisCuomo Well I am sorry we should just hold up the hold country because of an accusation. We all are assuming she is telling the truth. She could be lying that is a possibility lets face it we are living in a day and time where stranger and stranger things are happening each day.

@PNWDeepBlue @SenGillibrand Oh and 3. There is no mention of rape so lets as far as what has been alleged so far.
@PNWDeepBlue @SenGillibrand Tired of everyone tweeting this Yes it is true but 1. This is if what he did is classified as such and 2. You also have to look at the law that was on the books at the time the crime took place.
@ChrisCuomo Because the culture we live in once accused you are guilty and even if you are found innocent many still say you got off on a technicality which will be the case here because there is no way to prove this definitively. Beyond a reasonable doubt
@ChrisCuomo You keep pushing for an investigation that will bring about nothing. That is not to be cruel or insensitive to this women or the situation but rather just state the reality of it. Even if he is found innocent he will be look at by many as still a predator or offender.
@ChrisCuomo should not sum up your total life in total. Especially at 17. I wonder what you or any of us have done in our past that we are shamed of. Would you still be on the station for past mistakes made public?
@ChrisCuomo With your questions you are asking Kavanaugh should be disqualified from being SCOTUS if he is guilty of this. What do you want someone perfect on the bench? The man has a record that has earned him a nomination to this. I am sorry one mistake in a life
@SymoneDSanders Not guilty till proven innocent.
@SymoneDSanders I say appoint Kavanaugh to the court and investigate &amp; if there is something IMPEACH HIM! But to cost him a job on an allegation without any evidence is CRAZY! Presumption of innocence
@SymoneDSanders So if this is the case lets go with your train of thought then why not go and show the world how rigged it is. Also she has representation. So she gets to make allegations about someone and it gets to hang over them indefinitely.

@SenFeinstein Well I hoped you would of handled this a bit better. I hope this man Kavanaugh and his family can earn their good name back until this is proven one way or the other WHICH IT CAN'T BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. Lets say Ford is telling the truth which I am not saying she is or is not

U have a husband what if he is accused on something before u and he met today, WOULD U STILL FEEL THE SAME? Or would u grant him your husband the presumption of innocence
@wyatt1970 @AdamCAustin @SenGillibrand VERY TRUE!
@AdamCAustin @SenGillibrand Well what is alleged is not rape it all depends on how they file the allegation to determine if it is a misdemeanor there is limitation.
@brianefallon sometimes JUSTICE CANNOT BE HAD &amp; this is not assuming Kavanaugh is guilt, but rather innocent
@brianefallon Also depend on how the allegation is filed statues of limitations have passed &amp; NOTHING COMES OF IT! Also I venture to say, lets go back into your past I be we will she you are NOWHERE NEAR THE PERSON YOU WERE AT 17. The justice system is not perfect and
@brianefallon took place 38yr ago&amp;on a night of drinking. Even if the people surrounding the even are telling the truth that is what they may believe that necessarily may not be accurate. Also you are assuming this woman is telling the truth couldn't she be wrong, what if that is the case.
@brianefallon STOP YOU PARTISAN! You too are playing politics and taking this alleged tragedy for political gain &amp; trying to look morally sound. Here is the REAL DEAL, if it happened to her unfortunately NOTHING CAN COME OF IT! You investigate&amp;you will have to rely on memories on an event that
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN Okay but says her, we do not know? Why people do what they do? Who knows what else is at play if there is at all. Not saying this is a lie but not saying it is true either. Just saying we will not be able to get to the truth on this one based on what is alleged so far
@SenGillibrand Investigate for WHAT? HOW? Statues of limitation has passed so what do you want to come from this. I think we need to have a discussion about all of this and to have and help women come forward RIGHT AWAY WHEN THIS HAPPEN and not wait so long.
@ChrisCuomo Case in point Central Park 5 who was found innocent years later and that was a rape. In this case from what we know so far no rape so their is no DNA evidence to even look at.
@ChrisCuomo LET REMEMBER ALLEGED BECAUSE WHAT IF SHE IS WRONG? What recourse do THE NOW THE VICTIM OF FALSE ACCUSATION HAVE TO REGAIN OR CLEAN THEIR NAME?
@ChrisCuomo I got news for you NO MATTER WHAT COMES OF THIS! IF THIS IS INVESTIGATED AND FOUND INNOCENT HE STILL HAS A SHADOW OVER HIS HEAD because of the nature of the case. So long ago and faded memories and night in question drinking is involved. &amp; Chris you speak for victims
@ChrisCuomo and the night in question the accuser does not know nor what day or year or where according to reports so far so WHAT COMES OF IT! I am sorry Chris your call for an investigation I cannot get on board with that although you make some credible points.
@ChrisCuomo how we got to this point which is a valid one but also we all have made silly or grave mistake and rebound from them. To hold this man to this now after a life so long and no way of getting to the truth because we are going to rely on other people account on something so long ago
@ChrisCuomo and flawed and I am sure all of us you included has had a moment of shame or short fall in life and has learned from them. I do not say that to excuse Kavanaughs actions if he in fact did it what he is accused of but rather just address your point of us as a society and
@ChrisCuomo this at end of the day you may just end up shaming a man. Also none of us know what happened and the allegation are pretty serious so this MAN lets say he is innocent then what? He will still be looked at with a shadow cast over him. You speak of decency well we all are human
@ChrisCuomo you are a lawyer or went to school to be one VALID CASE CAN BE MADE FOR BOTH SIDES, how do we get to the truth on this? HOW? If you Chris was to represent Kavanaugh pretty sure you can poke a lot of holes in her version. Statutes of limitation is also a factor so you go through
@ChrisCuomo SAY IT IS TRUE, They maybe telling the truth best of their ability &amp; yet can be wrong because it was so long ago and drinking was involved according to reports. How does Kavanaugh clear his name? If this is you think only three people were there and drinking was involved,
@ChrisCuomo First this was so slanted w/Moore. You on the other hand made some good pts. First investigate but how do you get to the truth. Remember presumption of innocence is a corner stone. So we investigate something happened so long ago HOW DO WE EVEN RELY ON PEOPLE MEMORY &amp;
@SenFeinstein If what is alleged is true
@SenFeinstein You're an embarrassment of the USA Senate. How do u hold the seat is INCREDIBLE! You held on to this for so long&amp;NOW you vacillate on her credibility.

@CountryFirst84 IT IS CONGRESS BOTH HOUSE &amp; SENATE THAT WE NEED TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE! Can you tell me HOW MANY BILLS HAS THE HOUSE &amp; SENATE SENT TO THE PRESIDENTS DESK SO FAR FOR THE YEAR? Pres. Dem. or Rep. Pres. cannot create bills &amp; sign them into law.
@CountryFirst84 Now he did say that politicians is guilty of this but what did he do to make this better? WHAT NERVE! Pres. Trump would never be PRESIDENT TODAY had politician been doing half a third of what they say they will do. We look to the PRESIDENT WAY TOO MUCH!
@CountryFirst84 I find it RICH that Pres. Obama can say the Pres. Trump is capitalizing on resentment when HE HIMSELF &amp; HIS PARTY has been capitalizing on racism, homophobia, sexism, class warfare, immigration&amp;now made up category, ALL TO GET VOTE.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump I am only this vocal because when Pres. Trump is right I speak just as loud in defense so when he is wrong I am doing the same. Not to kick a man when he is down but rather show the errors of his ways.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump Okay but the man is dead and also even if you get hit, he went to uncharted territory and spoke about McCain service&amp;TOTALLY MISCHARACTERIZE IT. Call the man out on policy call him a political hack if that is what you feel but to question his service or speak down upon is wrong.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump I do not consider myself a Trump supporter nor a Never Trumper I do not put my  faith in any of the elected officials but I call it like it is and Had he done so today I would have had more respect for him he lost a  bit of it today.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump So McCain being a Rep. was right on principal &amp; though I thought he should have voted yes had he done so and it passed I think what the Rep. put forth would have been horrible.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs @realDonaldTrump Even though he voted no and I thought he should of voted yes. THE Rep. party is the better party on principals and they had from 2012 to put it together&amp;only did so like a student that was given 2wk on a project but only started on the night before &amp; expect the work to be GradeA
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs my point exactly, and everything the govt. does when it comes to our money road, infrastructure, they have failed. Only success there is, is with our military and that is because we have EXCEPTIONAL MEN &amp; WOMEN IN SPITE OF THE POLITICS &amp; CHALLENGES THEY RISE ABOVE &amp; SUCCEED!
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs yet to be brought home their commander and chief thinks they are NOT HEROES but losers. NOT COOL! HE NEEDS TO APOLOGIES!
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs Now today he did not have the humility to apologies and say he was wrong is awful! Pres. @realDonaldTrump is the commander and chief and if we should have any conflict &amp; our men &amp; women get captured or if we have any POW/MIA still
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs That @SenJohnMcCain is not a war hero. I found it hypocritical for someone to champion the cause of Vets. &amp; yet to call out one not for differences of opinions but rather their service especially when he did not serve himself.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs  Straight up I am going to say this. THE PRESIDENT IS DEAD WRONG FOR NOT HAVING THE FLAG AT HALF STAFF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY! I THOUGHT HE WAS WRONG BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN FOR SAYING IT AND THINK HE IS WRONG NOW FOR NOT APOLOGIZING.
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs &amp; yet it is so horrible, gee what are the rest of us to expect? Look at the Social Security, That &amp; the VA is an excellent preview of what kind of scam is being sold to us but we still buy. WHY?
@CountryFirst84 @Education4Libs EVERYTHING THE GOVT. HAS DONE THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY ARE IN ADEQUATE &amp; INSUFFICIENT. From our infrastructure, to EVEN OUR VA! These are men &amp; women that fight for our freedoms &amp; one would think they would get the royal treatment

@Alonso_GD @dandrezner I would not leave my child there NOR would my neighbor get to keep my child if they wanted him or her to stay. SAME APPLIES TO OUR COUNTRY! GOOD TRY! NICE ATTEMPT.
@Alonso_GD @dandrezner by extension the child is citizen of his or her parent. If I was to have my child at my neighbors house that does not mean my child belongs to my neighbor or has rights to stay at my neighbors house and entitled to all that comes from being a member of that household.
@Alonso_GD @dandrezner Yes but the author of the 14A CLEARLY EXPLAIN subject to the jurisdiction thereof as holding no alligance to anything but the USA. part of the debate while constructing the law was foreign principals such as Ambassadors. an illegal alien is a citizen of a foreign land &amp;
@ktparrish48 @dandrezner @sivavaid And she not having any allegiance to USA and by that extension her child would not either.
@TomKilianArt @MartianOrthodox @MarkSZaidEsq @dandrezner Okay WHY ISN'T IT! Explain that one?
@MarkSZaidEsq @dandrezner or should be right but what it is. Now if you argue that it should be changed or congress should amend it, that is a separate debate but it is CLEAR, NO ARGUING THIS ONE FAR AS I SEE.
@MarkSZaidEsq @dandrezner He could be a naturalized citizen. But being born of foreign parents DOES NOT SECURE YOUR CITIZENSHIP. GO read the 14thA then the author explanation of the words subject to the jurisdiction. The put your bias aside &amp; logically think, NOT WITH YOUR HEART or what you feel is
@littleboybluesa @dandrezner @oufenix SPOT ON. That is why I just went and read the 14thA myself and also found the author explanation of his words. Anton is right!
@booksnwine @dandrezner of becoming naturalized citizen &amp; taking the oath. So if a child is above all subject to his or her parent &amp; under that parent guidance directions and held loyal to that parent it would stand to reason that child is a citizen to the country of which the parent belongs too.
@booksnwine @dandrezner Simple "subject to jurisdiction of" and the author of the words clearly explained it. more so what is the difference of a ambassador or visitor here having a child on US soil. Both are citizens of a foreign land &amp; HOLD NO ALLEGIANCE to USA. There is a purpose to the process
@msallison @dandrezner You can argue the person ALL YOU WANT but it does not take away from the point he makes WHICH IS A VERY VALID ONE! So attack the person all you want does not change FACTS!
@dandrezner so I would think a professor would demonstrate a better example of how to engage in the internet public square.
@dandrezner lets follow Anton's fashion&amp;debate this &amp; deconstruct his argument &amp; see if it makes sense. I think it does. Or am I a racist as well because I happen to agree with him &amp; not you? SMH You are supposedly and intellectual shaping minds &amp; twitter is open space to express ones self
@dandrezner Light weight, I think NOT! Courageous ABSOLUTELY! To put forth an argument supported by fact that NOW can be debated that runs contrary to your opinion. GOD BLESS AMERICA YOU CAN EXPRESS IT But rather than hurl insult because you don't agree

@KristinaRibali I many of the times get so mad at many ideas I hear but I often remind myself as much as I disagree and idiotic I may find it many times that person is either misguided or just has a different view than I&amp;at the bottom of it they want things to be better just different solution.
@KristinaRibali AMEN TO THAT!
@ChrisCuomo No she shouldn't by any measure! We hire our elected officials to offer answer to tough questions&amp;provide solutions for the day. They R suppose to rise above it all. But instead we have this. 1 can argue Pres. Trump started this on the campaign but that's a 3rd grade excuse
@ChrisCuomo 3 equal branches &amp; THE ONE THAT MAKES THE LAWS IS NOT THE PRESIDENT. By in large that is part of the reason we have the PRESIDENT WE DO TODAY!
@ChrisCuomo Unfortunately Chris CONGRESS WILL NOT ACT! Why? Because to often the media focus on the President. Not just this one but all, &amp; when things does not get done many blame the president who ever it may be at the time. BUT WE ARE NOT A MONARCHY OR DICTATORSHIP!
@carlosgutierrez HELP THERE SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE FROM SO THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR COUNTRY!
@carlosgutierrez Unemployment rate among minorities that are CITIZENS is high but instead of advocating for them you speak of those who are not even from here. Charity begins at home spreads abroad! Solution is not to bring immigrants here but rather
@carlosgutierrez YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG! You were just on CNN w/@ChrisCuomo &amp; yes we have jobs here. But we also have CITIZENS who are living off of the system. I would MUCH RATHER MY TAX$ go to training them if needed &amp; filling those jobs than bring in immigrants!
@ChrisCuomo your guest Carlos talks about the JOB# as if it is excuse to allow other in illegally! FALSE! We have so many CITIZENS that are not working &amp; on the system WE CAN FILL THOSE JOBS &amp; THE Job participation number will increase and unemployment will go down even more.
@ChrisCuomo We are talking about babies and how they are treated who just arrived here &amp; are not citizens. WHAT ABOUT THE MANY THAT ARE ABUSED EACH DAY IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WHO ARE BORN HERE. Cannot remember the last time we cover that on national news.
@ChrisCuomo SPOT ON!!! It was PISS POOR EXECUTION! They should have been prepared! @realDonaldTrump going in right direction just taking some bad roads.
@ChrisCuomo WHy do you and other mention other countries (Germany) We are no NOT GERMANY &amp; GERMANY IS NOT US!
@ChrisCuomo Go after BOTH employees and illegal immigrants
@ChrisCuomo I do not know about that, you just mention to Cory that we have so many jobs and do not have the people to fill them. What is the job participation rate at? How about getting some of those folks off the system, perhaps training and get them a job.
@ChrisCuomo Case in point Salvadorian who have been given shelter for about 10yrs. WHERE DOES IT STOP? At a point you draw the line, where is that at?
@ChrisCuomo when things are settled I will help them rebuild their home or help assist in taking a collection to hire contractors to rebuild. Solution is not stay at my  home indefinitely or forever. I never hear this on the left or the right for that matter.
@ChrisCuomo Chris WHY is it for many on the left that the solution to those who seek better conditions to live in is to come to the USA and we should allow them to stay? If my neighbors house is burned down or flooded out OF COURSE I will offer refuge BUT after a month or two

@CountryFirst84 Questions, if a man or woman is caught shop lifting with their child doesn't the law take that child away? If a woman or man is caught driving w/out a Drivers License w/ a child isn't the child taken away?
@CountryFirst84 but they will QUICKLY PROTEST THEIR OWN NATION. SMH!
@CountryFirst84 Funny thing is you see so many on the left speak out about this but right in NYC you have MANY NATIONS THAT DAVE DONE WORSE AND DOING SO RIGHT NOW &amp; the same left that LOVE TO PROTEST &amp;MARCH I have yet to see a single protest or march against many of these nations
@CountryFirst84 I do not agree with this but I do not blame Pres. Trump for doing what he is doing, perhaps congress would now do what they are supposed to do. All of what is happening  is MADNESS because we should NEVER BE HERE DEALING WITH THIS!
@CountryFirst84 They have the power to make laws and repeal or reform them and they have done  nothing but lip service on this issue for decades. Had they not played political football with this topic but actually do something then we would not be hear.
@CountryFirst84 (By they way i understand why they come here but that cannot be the answer) So finally it will get to a point where it gets to drastic measure. Far as I am concerned I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM ANY SENATOR OR CONGRESS MAN OR WOMAN ON THIS if they agree or disagree.
@CountryFirst84 &amp; much more &amp; still people keep coming w/no respect or regard for our laws or sovereignty.  Just a few months ago we had groups of Central American flagrantly disregarding our laws &amp; daring us to do something w/a march to our nation.
@CountryFirst84 The country is being invaded &amp; it is all being done with out a gun or shot fired. I do not agree nor like separation of parents&amp; children it is horrible but what are we to do. We have done catch on release, we have issued warning, &amp; court appearance tickets,
@ChrisCuomo I do not agree with this but I do not blame Pres. Trump for doing what he is doing, perhaps congress would now do what they are supposed to do.

@CountryFirst84 Pres. Trump comments that NK is no longer a threat is a bit premature &amp; DUMB! Can easily get double crossed tomorrow. It is better if you let it play out a bit and work out a deal before claiming victory. SMH!
@davidaxelrod but I am going a long with it even if I disagree for 1. He is the president and 2. we have been doing it a certain way for so long and time to shake it up.
@davidaxelrod Now it could have gone the other way but going through the process that can fail as well. Point is HE IS THE PRESIDENT &amp; HE IS DOING THING UNCONVENTIONALLY THAT CHALLENGE A LOT OF OUR THINKING OR VIEW OR OPINION You and I included
@davidaxelrod The process my goodness. okay I agree YES he should have gone through the process BUT he is not the status quo that any of us are use to &amp; he is going to do it his way. The end result is he made the right choice on all accounts.
@morningmika @JoyceWhiteVance I myself do not agree w/everything but even then there are solid point that is made &amp; deeper question to ask NOT ABOUT Pres. TRUMP but our NATION AND OURSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS! We lash out because it is easier to do that than look at our selves or our nation.
@morningmika @JoyceWhiteVance public figures lashed out in outrage or took issue w/it rightfully so but fast forward you have many in congress &amp; celebrities who are having their closet door opened w/a lot worse in there. So perhaps we do not agree w/a lot of what is said
@morningmika @JoyceWhiteVance Well I look at Pres. Trump as the Mirror so as long as we all look at him &amp; get self righteous we all have to now look at ourselves the same way. Case in point the leak tape back on the campaign where he made remarks about grabbing women, well many in politics &amp;
@ChrisCuomo Have not been able 2 see U since your new show! CONGRATS BTW. Been busy w/work that I have missed out on a lot in the reality show of WashDC/WH but I hope to get caught up soon. Will try and DVR your show. Hope Y R the same CC from PT&amp;not the morning show All The Best
@morningmika So you were upset a RGiuliani comments but you are TOTALLY FINE W/THE PORN STAR Sleeping w/the Donald Trump &amp; taking money to keep her mouth shut Oh &amp; her going on a strip club tour? SMH! I guess she is on moral HIGH GROUND!
@morningmika What he does in his private time is his business isn't it? I am sure you being a celebrity would not want what you do in your private time to be disclosed. SMH!
@morningmika then wonder why the term has caught on #FAKENEWS Okay lets say it is true this claim you make, still you need to provide more than someone I spoke to, some sort of supporting facts and if not then let it be. Also why is this news or a story?
@morningmika So sad! SERIOUSLY, to regard yourself as a journalist &amp; work at a prominent network &amp; just come out w/ someone I spoke to that I know that spoke to the president &amp; run w/such a salacious remark or charge is ABHORRENT! Then you call this news &amp;

@amjoyshow @EJDionne And those ideas have gotten so polarized that the rules that governs our play on the field THE CONSTITUTION we are now beginning to chip away, dilute, pervert it to achieve our agenda, both right and left. You JOY take part in this as well. You are not the only one.

@amjoyshow @EJDionne Well gee I wonder had this Pres. not been president would we know how bad it stinks in Wash. DC the FISA court &amp; how it is being abused, no matter what side you are on THAT IS A FACT, SOME IN THE FBI &amp; CIA abusing the power or taking their liberties a bit too far.
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross no longer right or wrong but equivocations, rationalizations, &amp; a lot of spin.

@davidhogg111 the visit out to his place when there were reports on him. But you take to Wash. DC. SMH! Seems to me there is a WHOLE LOT LACKING FROM THIS FROM YOUR VIEW POINT! I commend your spirit &amp; do not fault you for being angry&amp;wanting something to be done

@davidhogg111 SO you look to the govt. that did not do their job (FBI, SHERIFF, POLICE &amp; OTHERS) to place more laws that there is a good chance will not be enforced. I do not follow you but from all I have seen I have yet to see you or those that stand w/you take criticism to those
@davidhogg111 Even more you are calling for MORE LAWS TO TAKE AFFECT when the ones in place that could have prevented this your man from purchasing the guns in the first place was not executed. !
@davidhogg111 or upset enough to commit such an act guess what LAWS WILL NOT STOP THEM&amp; IF THEY CANNOT BUY THEM LEGALLY THEN THERE IS ALWAYS AN ILLEGAL WAY. After all they are not concerned about the law or consequences. They are upset or deranged.
@davidhogg111 Have you critically though about this issue. Someone can get in a vehicle&amp;wait for children to get out of school&amp;run them over like a lady did in Las Vegas about three years ago. See the guns is not the issue &amp; if someone is disturbed enough
@nowthisnews @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle All of the world is not a nice place you will be well off to find other ways to handle challenges such as this. Be careful young man this boycott tool you use at your will is a fickle mechanism &amp; the pendulum can easily swing the other  way.
@nowthisnews @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle said so but calling for a boycott because someone makes a remark you do not like or disagree w/your view or simply makes a mean remark is not how you go about resolving issue.
@nowthisnews @davidhogg111 Funny you get in the square to debate &amp; one apposed you pull the kid card but in the same breath you say you have a voice &amp; want to be taken seriously that you know what your are talking about. @IngrahamAngle comment on your college acceptance was off topic&amp;she should not have

@thehill Thing is we HAVE HEAPS LOAD OF LAWS ALREADY, MOST LAWS WRITTEN ARE LONGER THAN THE BIBLE ITSELF &amp; YET WE STILL HAVE THE ISSUE, ENFORCEMENT IS Public reaching out Compassion and a host of other things will help but ANOTHER LAW, I HIGHLY DOUBT IT, not on this issue.

@davidhogg111 @SteveKingIA I would hope you would have learned from the very conceiving of our nation there was vigorous debate. That is why we have a CONSTITUTION THAT HAS STAND THE TEST OF TIME FOR OVER 200yrs and why many flock here because of what it offer. You'd be wise to not let your anger guide you
@davidhogg111 @SteveKingIA This is how our Republic Democracy  works you get questions and dissent which forces more critical thinking and hopefully a push to a sound resolution. I would think you know this David being you are still in school
@davidhogg111 @SteveKingIA On Feb. 14, 2018 250 people in Chicago alone far more than 17 did not see any marches then and certainly I would say that is worth marching for but I guess the cameras was not there. So I guess because the congressman propose questions that makes him a divider?
@SteveKingIA Or join the military, or be able to sign a contract or be put on trail as an adult?
@Education4Libs Or how about 3 or 4 out of the first the amendments or even simpler what is the first 10 amendments called?

It was 10yrs ago looking back we all have things we would not want to come out
@amandacarpenter Who cares at this point. Really this filth of a story is only allowing this Woman to gain more spot light. Majority of us guessed that the Pres. had sex with her &amp; paid her not to talk. We have her story from 10yrs ago&amp;true or not has no basis as for the Pres. &amp;what he does now.
@kylekeeling1 @squishybugbutt @Notorrius @Alyssa_Milano @NRA Or the officials they called on to warn about this guy. SMH!

@squishybugbutt @Notorrius @Alyssa_Milano @NRA But yes lets put our faith in the GOVT TO MAKE SOME MORE LAWS THEY WILL NOT ENFORCE.
@squishybugbutt @Notorrius @Alyssa_Milano @NRA No but they would not be cool with the Govt. that has them &amp; people have no access to them. By the way this is the same govt. that did not approach the shooter and shoot him or bother to Red flag his gun purchase or thoroughly follow up calls from the public.
@dwnwkonkistador @browsers77 @redroz0595 @RealDeanDirksen @Alyssa_Milano @NRA Well you are not giving to defense contractors, you are contracting or hiring them to do a job. Not the same. Now if you want to discuss the wasteful spending then that is a different topic we can also have.

@mjbrandonbowers @Alyssa_Milano @NRA @GOP Well I wonder what is to be said of those on the left the push for ABORTION!? &amp; you are right children should not be attacked but to say they are misguided or question their grasp on the issue is not an attack.
@Lynsm7 @Alyssa_Milano @NRA Why are they marching for the same govt. to act that did not act in the 1st place. MANY CALLS was placed warning about this shooter No reports were made or red flagging his gun purchase same instance in TX shoot the AF didn't report him. But sure lets look to Govt. for answers
@Jeffmeinhardt1 @Alyssa_Milano @NRA This is how misguided they are. Cuban flag which by the way Castro came to power with the use of GUNS! SMH!

@GovMattBevin I appreciate your words today at the meeting w/the Pres. and I feel that would go further than any other solution put forth.

@LeahRBoss Well on 1 hand I agree w/you on the otherside I say it's not right that we burn a guy at the stakes when the initial story come out so we should not do it w/women either. But if this is the rules we play by then game on, she is fair game. Simply put keep your hands to yourself

@FNC_Ladies_Rule @julieroginsky How about bulletproof windows and doors, and door with bolt the way you find on a door of a safe but not as thick. Also a button or latch to lock teachers &amp; kids in safe till help comes. Also lining the walls with metal.
@chelseahandler YOU ARE SICK, POLITICS HAS GONE TO YOUR HEAD &amp; TAKEN YOU TO A BAD PLACE, much of what is wrong with our country today you are putting it on FULL DISPLAY!
@AnthemRespect @MacMaggies @DailyCaller It is just scapegoating the to the NRA rather then look at the real problem because we today want &amp; instant solution which even if we got rid of the NRA &amp; Guns this problem will still exist.
@AnthemRespect @MacMaggies @DailyCaller AMEN!
@natjoyfully @IvankaTrump I agree I don' t like armed guards in the school it is exposing our children to too much. IT IS SCHOOL! Bulletproof the windows, doors&amp;line the walls w/metal&amp;have a latch or button to dead bolt the door&amp;lock the windows so teacher&amp;children can feel safe locked in till help comes
@enterprisecares that is not to minimize the death or situation in FL. See this boycott bandwagon that you are hopping on comes off as fake, because I wonder if Parkland never happened or if the people did not cry out about this WOULD ENTERPRISE EVEN CARE OR TAKE A STAND? https://t.co/Oj1RxDrCre
@enterprisecares or mental illness, hopelessness, &amp; many others. Also I have not seen anyone calling for a boycott on the NRA for the over 250 people shot in Chicago which is a heck of a lot more than 17 or the 29 in Baltimore, and https://t.co/Oj1RxDrCre
@enterprisecares Boycotting the NRA, well I will certainly boycott you! You are using the NRA as a scapegoat, the problem will still exist whether the NRA is here or not, The PROBLEM IS W/WHAT GOT THE PERSON TO THE PT. TO PICK UP A GUN, Poverty, lack of opportunity or education https://t.co/Oj1RxDrCre
@CountryFirst84 Since the talk of the NRA &amp; blood on it's hands How about PlannedParenthood having blood on their hands.
@Johnny_Joey @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump teacher&amp;students can lock themselves in a room that is safe till help comes. Also the problem is not the gun but what leads the person to the point to pick up the gun, Lack of guidance, sense of hopelessness &amp;despair, cry for help,
@Johnny_Joey Just saw you on @TuckerCarlson and I have been saying the same thing. Instead of arming teacher how about the @realDonaldTrump &amp; other bullet proof window, doors &amp; line the walls w/metal. Make door w/more bolt to lock at the pull of a latch so that way
@LeahRBoss And I am going out to get one tomorrow! Sign me up! #ResignSheriffIsreal

SPOT ON! GREAT POINT! EXCELLENT POINT! People were not calling for gun control as I recall at that time. https://t.co/FJ8jtQGF7i
@GOPBlackChick then why are they allowing to the military &amp; fight for our freedoms? Sure they get training so if that is the difference then why not make it mandatory they take set amount of hours of training? Just asking the question.
@GOPBlackChick What make a rifle an assault rifle? Either they all are or they are not? All designed w/the same ability different capabilities. I'm not going to make a big case of it but I feel it is worth discussing, if 18yr old should not be able to buy a rifles or guns
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick This is not 100% as well but it will go much further than any law. Just may opinion.
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick If we are putting guns in schools now why can't we have God, Prayer in schools as well. Look out for one another, taking the time to let someone know you care or they have people that care about them &amp; they are not alone.
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick Mind you there is no law that will solve this. COMMUNITY will solve it. Love one another, take time to listen &amp; respect one anther, lets have families again,traditional families, father &amp; mothers in the home.
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick feeling a sense of hopelessness along w/perhaps some sort of grievance. For some it is many other things. So if we do not look at what the cause is that got a person to pick up a gun then whether it be a gun or something else this problem(cancer)will still be here &amp; grow.
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick there are many types that is effecting people. So is this issue for some it is lack of guidance or father figure in the home or anyone to love them so they join a gang. For some it is mental illness. For some it is no where or no one to turn too for help or
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick we will be right where we are now where we were on Feb.14 and for the 44 day preceding  where 250 were shot in Chicago. If not guns, then Knife, Hammer, Car, bomb. This problem is like a cancer which there are many types of prostate, breast, pancreatic, and many other,
@berkybow5 @GOPBlackChick Here is the thing about all of this we discuss all of this &amp;it is all reactive. Which nothing is wrong w/that but how about proactive. Because the problem still exist, &amp;TRUST ME IT IS NOT GUNS. GUNS (Guns is only the instrument or tool used just as a hammer, car, knife or bomb)
@GOPBlackChick or in a car right outside the school. I have not been to a DC public school but it is TRAGIC when we have this, going through metal detectors, &amp; guns on the school premises. But then again new day, different times, new challenges calls for new methods. Who knows?
@GOPBlackChick I just do not like the idea of guards or teacher with guns in the school. Perhaps I am wrong, Just trying to think it through from all sides &amp; exposing a child to this visually not sure if that is best. Perhaps a guard on the premises or a station in the school
@GOPBlackChick Not saying this is 100% nothing is but heck of a lot better than just having a gun. Just my opinion
@GOPBlackChick That teacher &amp; students can lock themselves in a classroom w/out fear of being shot till help arrives &amp; police can go in with caution knowing that there are many in the classrooms less likely of people out side.
@GOPBlackChick Why do we push for that armed teachers or guards. Perhaps guards 2 or three yes but teacher not so warmed up to that idea. Why don't we secure the target like bulletproof doors and windows. Perhaps lining the walls with metal or bullet proof material.
@ScottforFlorida THINK ABOUT THIS! THINK IT THROUGH DO NOT LET YOUR OUTRAGE GUIDE YOU! Often decision rooted in emotions have a bad outcome.
@ScottforFlorida but you say they cannot buy a gun. Yet they can be put on trial as an adult. THAT TO ME IS A PROBLEM! Now having a requirement for those buying a gun take a mandatory set amount of hours for training perhaps is a better way for this.
@ScottforFlorida rather  than critically thinking this through. I encourage you to please examine this more &amp; find some other ways, better ways to do so. A person at 18 can go to the military and they are armed w/a gun and they can stand a post or take a battlefield
@ScottforFlorida If not guns, then Knife, Hammer, Car, bomb. Also raising the age well perhaps they person just wait till they are 21 to carry out this act, then what do you do at that pt. raise the age again? This is nothing more than outrage and just reactive
@ScottforFlorida So if we do not look at the really issue WHICH IS NOT GUNS (Guns is only the instrument or tool used just as a hammer, car, knife or bomb) we will be right where we are now where we were on Feb.14 and for the 44 day preceding  where 250 were shot in Chicago.
@ScottforFlorida w/perhaps some sort of grievance. For some it is many other things. See this is like a cancer and like cancer being prostate, breast, pancreatic, and many other, there are many types that is effecting people not just 1 cancer.
@ScottforFlorida to do harm. Some it is lack of guidance or father figure in the home or anyone to love them so the join a gang. For some it is mental illness. For some it is no where or no one to turn too for help or feeling a sense of hopelessness along
@ScottforFlorida Raising the age is like giving of gun purchase is tantamount to treatment that only leave the illness dormant. You are not treating what the issue is. WHICH IS NOT GUNS! Guns are only the instrument but so many are not looking at what drove the person to that pt
RT @KatiePavlich: Release the video, Sheriff https://t.co/Zr3eOPTRnC
@CountryFirst84 I have heard no 1 put forth a solution that would work. I think having bulletproof windows&amp; doors &amp; line the walls as well is a whole lot better than guards at the schools.
@LeahRBoss I am incensed, just saw a clip of the Sherif of Parkland call out Dana Loesch when his police department so woefully dropped the ball which could of prevented this or mitigate it.
@LeahRBoss Why?
@LeahRBoss Here is the thing, I have not heard anyone suggested reinforce the door &amp; windows w/bulletproof material so perhaps it will help prevent this. Rather lets go after the guns. SMH disgusting. Also funny how we can now bring guns into schools but God &amp; Prayer cannot. Shameful
@KatiePavlich I have not heard anyone suggested reinforce the door &amp; windows w/bulletproof material so perhaps it will help prevent this.

@weirdoffmain @Montel_Williams Okay so what age would that be? I am going to go out on a limb here that you take issue w/my comment but it is a valid one. This is the problem my comment was not mean spirited or aimed to insult but to ask a valid question but you take to some sort of insult.
@SenFeinstein @MaraLiasson So it is okay for someone join the army and fight for this country, be put on trial as an adult but not okay to buy a gun, then maybe they should not be able to drive, or vote or do many other things at this age?
@Montel_Williams Should we also raise the age to vote or drive or buy alcohol or enter into contracts or go fight for this country? Just asking?

@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss What do you think should the age to purchase a rifle be raised?
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA entering contracts or being tried as an adult. How is that for some suggestions from the supposed opposition.
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA I am for making them take a mandatory gun training &amp; safety class prior to purchase. Or if you raise the age for gun purchase then raise the age for everything else, like voting, entering the army, driving(which many in that age group get into accidents, some fatal)
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA But raising the age, is it fair you tell a 18 yr old or 19yr old you can be tried as an adult, you can vote, buy a house, enter into contracts, go die for your country but you are not responsible enough to own a gun.
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA that is not going to solve it, they will look for another instrument to inflict pain or destruction by other means to others or themselves. I say we need to look at ourselves as a whole &amp;as communities to help this. Can laws be tweeked sure.
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA We look at this because of the instrument the person used &amp; call for gun reform as if that will make us safe it is a false sense of security. It is the really issue we do not want to look at.  So lets take away the guns OR make it harder to get one, if someone is troubled
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA they end up joining a gang or self harming, or destructive behavior. The problem is not the gun it is the underlying issue that many of us did not take notice or care to pay attention to. All of this needs to be part of the conversation. Guns are just a scapegoat.
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA can tip the scale to keep someone from going over the edge. May sound simplistic but it makes a difference. Being a mentor to someone that lost their family. It happened to this young man in this instance but everyday it happens to children in many neighborhood across USA &amp;
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA not just take an idelogical side or view of the issue, respect for our common man, WE ARE ALL AMERICANS! Being a better friend, brother, sister, classmate, teacher, parent &amp; letting someone know you care &amp; you are there for them. Sometime these little things
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA I can saw enforcement of the laws. I can also say when something happens we all look to the govt for a solution as if laws are the magic solution. Sometimes it is us the community that change things. Loving one another, taking time to listen to one another &amp;
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA Okay so now how are you to get you message across to someone who is a NRA member or support. I'm a supporter of NRA. I don't advocate for senseless violence but it is rhetoric like that, that doesn't help. So are we going to takeaway cars or go back to prohibition because of DWI?
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA that is not being heard or even expressed much &amp; if it is well the person has blood on their hand. That does not get us anywhere NOR HELP ANYTHING.
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA I am only hearing 1side of this NRA is bad those w/mental health issues should not have a gun, age 18 or 19 should not be able to own a gun but her is the thing while all of those comment SURELY SOUND good &amp;sensible &amp;benevolent but their is another side of the debate
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA I take them seriously for what they are saying because they are coming from the point of view of experiencing something tragic. All of what they say are valid pts of view especially from their experience, but also in life there is cause &amp; effect &amp; so far
@BRomanent @JoyAnnReid @NRA No one said they could not but what are they reading when the overwhelming majority of the educational system is liberal or left leaning you get that. I hear a lot of their opinions &amp; much of it is the same &amp; much are talking pts we have been hearing.
@JoyAnnReid @NRA Wonder where they are getting this idea to call the @NRA out from. Developing minds this is being told something often enough will take to that. That goes for anyone but even more for young developing learning minds.

@dbongino Saw you on @TuckerCarlson last night and you are absolutely 100% RIGHT! They are expressing their voice&amp;opinion MOSTLY ROOTED from this experience as well as the fed info by media but they should not be the go to or voice of reason on this, but they should get a say
@Dre_LilMountain @LeahRBoss Well at tweet can and is still communication&amp;I think that is why people feel so free to express things about people that they would not otherwise face to face. All I am saying is there is no need for a personal attack on some1 who express thought on an issue. Especially Children
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss If someone wanted to they can make a pen an assault pen and do damage to but doubt anyone would call it an assault pen.
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss Who came up w/the name assault rifle? Is there such a thing as assault car or hammer or knife, but we call guns Assault rifles. A rifle is a tool used effectively can harm or not harm someone or something. It is the person using the equipment.

@LeahRBoss What did he say exactly or do?
@davidjbrewer @LeahRBoss You are right children are being used but is it their fault. In the educational system today is overwhelmingly liberal controlled &amp; break down in society when electronic devices are raising children rather than parents WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT. They are off limits
@Dre_LilMountain @LeahRBoss Not so much in personal attacks or attacks of any kind. Now to attack or challenge rather their opinion or thoughts or ideas then I agree fair game. But do so in a way that they can understand and learn.
@LeahRBoss @SplitElement Children that saw friend shot to death as if they are in some battle field or video game, as school no less they may not be think it all through but their thought I belief to be genuine w/out ulterior motives unlike the adults. What we should do is help help them think it through
@tally_dad @LeahRBoss With how children are being thought today maybe they are not. Who knows
@JaredEMoskowitz You along w/many people say why should some1 age 18 or 19 have a gun in the 1st place. Well why do we draft them or take them in the military&amp;put a gun in their hand to take a battle field to fight&amp;die?
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss Exactly, also the age they put you on trail as an adult.
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss Now some are talking about raising the age to buy a gun which is valid discussion but if so then they should raise the age of the draft. This country can ask or take 18yr olds in the military&amp;put a gun in their hands&amp;fight but they cannot buy one?
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss We are what many other countries attempt to be. It is so horrible or we do it so wrong that many flee to our country. We are flawed like any other but STOP WITH THE COMPARISONS!
@CountryFirst84 @LeahRBoss I am so tired of the BS about this is what this country does or there isn't any other country that has this or that. Switzerland does this or does that or Australia does this or that. WE ARE FREAKIN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! UNLIKE NO OTHER!

@lee_bozeman @SenKamalaHarris So hold on you are saying that Immigration was not&amp;is not an issue going all the way back to Pres. Regan &amp;beyond. Part of that is the  fact that little children are brought here or sent here unattended by an adult to get citizenship.

@lee_bozeman @SenKamalaHarris No it did not it has been on going WAY BEFORE 2012 But Pres. Obama &amp; Dems gave it a name then which was DACA! &amp; politicized it even more but you keep fooling your self about this. (By the way I am not political on this Reps. politicize this issue as well)
@TiffanyDCross @FoxNews I saw it. Hope they have you on more.
@ChrisCuomo @MarlaPena That can be the difference that keeps a sane or insane person from going over the edge.

@ChrisCuomo @MarlaPena Why do we turn to Govt. as if they have some sort of cure all or magic elixir that will wipe our troubles away. That is the easy&amp;weak way out. Not looking to insult anyone just giving my diagnosis of what is happening. You know what makes me US safe.
@JessicaTarlov @ @kayleighmcenany Pres. Trump IS NOT A REPUBLICAN but he ran under the Republican flag or name SO is the same for Bernie. He is not a Democrat but ran under the name or Democrat flag.

@dvsndvs @SenKamalaHarris I agree w/mental health issues point that if you have mental issues you should not be able to get a gun. But owning a gun is a right so if you pass a back ground check you are able to own 1 now the background check should check for mental health evaluations if they don't.
@dogslifehere @BershodM @ananavarro Now lets look at some other communities big &amp; smaller w/less crime big part of that is people talking to one another, looking out for one another helping one another. Also look at the gun laws of those communities. NRA is not to blame here sorry.
@dogslifehere @BershodM @ananavarro It is a community that take care of each other, makes one another safe. If you lived in the bad neighborhood lets say Chicago that environment w/the strictest gun laws &amp; still people do not feel safe becuz of the community &amp; enforcement &amp; other things.
@dogslifehere @BershodM @ananavarro Easy to think NRA is the problem SMH! That is the easy way out to think of this. Lets take ALL THE GUNS AWAY LET DO THAT I wonder how long before we beg to get them back or how many of us become criminals because we will own one illegally.
@MeShellVaTech Are you a mortgage underwriter?
@dvsndvs @SenKamalaHarris PERHAP SAY SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING SHOULD APPLY TO THIS AS WELL. But the false security of lets make another law just won't cut it. I won't feel safe by another law. Ask the criminals behind bars if  a law ever stopped them from breaking it?
@dvsndvs @SenKamalaHarris I got news for you, tomorrow and the day after there will always be a victim. Not happy about that or celebrating it just a fact of mankind. We should try to make things better but HOW WE DO SO is the question. Put all the laws you want there will always be violence
@edgemony @brithume Got news for you if we do not have safety security or entitlement unless brave men&amp;women stand a post or take a battlefield. Without them ALL OF THIS IS GONE!
@SenFeinstein Do not hear about a ban on pressure cookers and we have had a bombing in NYC using one. Wonder why not?
@SenFeinstein Sure so our police will have them our military &amp; national guard as well, Oh &amp; we know the criminals will definitely have them but me poor Joe Shmoe will be left out or have to become a criminal to have one to secure himself from criminals or his state. Not a bright idea.
@LeahRBoss Well said Leah
@KaivanShroff @LeslieMarshall How interesting U R tweeting about this now? Wonder if you tweeted back on Jan. 5 or 12th or 24th or Feb. 2nd or 9th about school shooting? or the 29 in Baltimore &amp; 250 in Chicago that got shot? Could it be this 1 is getting major media coverage so U R jumping in? Just asking?
@LeahRBoss Another law will not make things 100 safe or improve anything. What improves things &amp; makes us safe is looking out for one another, being a community, taking time to listen to one another being a friend, brother sister parent, teacher BEING A FELLOW MAN!! That makes us safe.
@amyj3sse @NYGovCuomo False sense of security yes it helps but a community keeps a community safe. LAWS DOES NOT KEEP US SAFE! Just go ask any1 in jail. They will say the law&amp;consequences didn't deter them from committing their crimes. Enforcement, acting looking out for one another. THat keepsus safe
@NYGovCuomo Where was this same exact tweet a week ago or 2or3? 250 shot in Chicago thus far&amp;29 in Baltimore but now it's a hot topic major news media is talkin about it twitter is buzzing, SO WE ALL BETTER SAY SOMETHING, right? Wonder how many tweets about this you will in 2-3mnths from now
@dvsndvs @SenKamalaHarris We are addressing people who are hurting this evening and you are playing politics cheer Senator Harris for President. SMH!
@SenKamalaHarris Okay so lets see on this issue you are part of a governing body consisting of 100people&amp;a system that consist of over 600people. I am asking over the last 60days which 45 accounts for this year alone how many times you have addressed this in the senate as well as here on Twitter?
@lepton939 @ZimmermanRob Convenient to blame NRA but that is not the issue. FAR FROM IT!
@ZimmermanRob Oh NOW YOU WANT ACTION, because this is the 18th, well  lets look at it RZ. 18th How many of them got coverage or on our major news networks or Politicians? This is the 18th but 250 in Chicago&amp;29 in Baltimore, 45days in  2018 NOW YOU CALL FOR ACTION becuz of major news coverage
@ABC7NY The DUMBEST IDEAS EVER! I hope who ever comes in after DeBlasio turns this around, Does not need to be shut down, needs improvement.
@ChrisCuomo This is not you only but us as a society your station the media as a whole YOU individually, ME as well,.
@ChrisCuomo But this happens we all jump in&amp;scream outrage &amp; anger about it, then move on? So in 2mnths or 4 mnts from now will you or @CNN be speaking about this? If not then why speak it comes off a bit false or phony. Again not saying you are but after awhile it begins to appear that way.
@ChrisCuomo Come on Chris you are saying all the right things, I do not know what is in your heart but just 4 or 5 months ago we had a MASS SHOOTING IN LV &amp;we have moved on like it is an after thought since the yr began I have not seen much if any mention of it from @CNN or you?
@ChrisCuomo Chris where was this feeling or you speaking out on this issue a week ago or two weeks ago or last month. I only ask because there are many people that are shot, so far for the yr 45days 250Chicago, 29Baltimore 7Boston &amp;on&amp;on not a word on that. But here we are.
@CynthiaLIVE @Gladwell @WorldGovSummit Where can I catch that interview?
@ChrisCuomo Govt. shut down &amp; who won and Illegal immigration. Yet 250 lives shot in a very condensed area &amp; not many more effected by it &amp; we are blind but now many of us take to our post to speak out as to some how be morally sound on this. SMH! WE ALL NEED TO CHECK OURSELVES!
@ChrisCuomo We all need to check our selves &amp; the sincerity about this issue. So far about 250 have been shot in Chicago and it is only 45days into the year. Yet that is not the headline in the news on any major news network. All I have heard about is Pres. Trump &amp; Russia collusion, Memos,
@ChrisCuomo Chris sorry my man but so far for the yr on your station I have not seen a single segment addressing this issue. Now that we have this happening we all turn to it like we do every other piece of news &amp; speak to it for a moment &amp; when the next headline comes along we move on.
@LeslieMarshall Not enough alone for him to criticize need solutions or suggestions on a solution.
@LeslieMarshall 100 in senate over 500 in house of representative, that is over 600 people you tell me they cannot divide up into several group to be each tasked w/looking for solutions to problem them bring proposals to the floor for the rest of the body to view &amp; debate them?
@LeslieMarshall Rep. Jim Himes has he written a bill or proposed one in the past 45 days, or even better the last 180day or call for a vote on this issue? He is part of congress. All I have been hearing is Russia&amp;Pres.Trump collusion, memos, govt. shut down&amp;Illegal Immigrants.
@NomikiKonst Media as well were have they been for the last 45days? Oh that is right DACA, Govt. shut down &amp; Memos &amp; Pres. Trump&amp;Russia collusion. Have not seen 1 segment on ANY major network on this but I am suppose to believe the sincerity about this problem. https://t.co/8ZTNJPKLTb
@NomikiKonst If that is the case we are not even 2mnths into the yr&amp;about 250 shot in the city of Chicago, 250! That should be alarming but not a word from anyone in the media or politician. But now pundit talking heads are going to politicize this issue because the cameras are there.
@AGSchneiderman Convenient to speak about this now because it is on the frontline. So far for the yr all anyone seem to care about is Pres. TRUMP&amp;Russia&amp;Immigration. But I got news for you not even 2mnths into the yr&amp;about 250 shot in Chicago but NOT A PEEP OUT OF ANYONE. But now you care?

@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT WAS NOT EASY OR SIMPLE. We are suppose the elect the BEST AMONG US to step up and solve the nation problems. As of late it seems we are not getting that, Not just with the Pres. behavior but all of CONGRESS!
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins Rather than grilling Mr. Perkins on how he &amp; evangelical vote for @realDonaldTrump &amp; justifying it as to some how call in to judgement their faith or beliefs because as it does not line up with their decision on the vote.
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins Simply Erin it came down to HC &amp; DT Both tragically flawed &amp; voter made a tough decision, tougher for some than others. Maybe the segment should not be on Pres. Trump but rather us as a nation, a society and how we got to this point.
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins have done just as bad or worse &amp; that is not to excuse the Pres. but rather question how we judge these issue because it would seem for a long time judgement was based upon the perpetrator.
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins If the Pres. @realDonaldTrump did pay her off at least he did it w/his own money. His winning the election is NOW FORCING ALL OF US TO KNOW QUESTION OR LOOK AT OUR SELVES &amp; OUR MORAL COMPASS. Media darling of NBC Matt Lauer &amp; many in Hollywood
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins I take no issue w/the questions just the fact it is a bit one sided. The Pres. is in Wash. DC you talk about the grab them by the tapes&amp;the alleged porn star pay off well MANY IN CONGRESS USED TAXPAYERS $$ TO PAYOFF WOMEN FOR THEIR MISS DEEDS.
@ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @tperkins You are HARPING on the Pres. Character. Obviously NO, NOT THE SHINIEST BY FAR! If people are to judge it upon that alone HIGHLY LIKELY HE DOES NOT GET SUPPORT. Sometime life is more difficult than that. the Pres. is a mixed bag

@ChrisCuomo @RepSwalwell Calling out the Pres. for not being around which is fair criticism but also HE DOES NOT WRITE BILLS CONGRESS DOES So 2 call him out 4not assisting u in DOING YOUR JOB is a bit RICH! I think he should've been this wkend but perhaps it was better he was not
@ChrisCuomo @VanJones As much as Pres. is instability&amp;lack leadership THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN HE HAS BEEN IN OFFICE Many Dems&amp;Reps like OHatch CSchumner DFeinstein MMcConnell have been around a longtime&amp;nothin has been done If congress is 67%on this Pres. is MUTE!
@ChrisCuomo Please do not have @KellyannePolls on for awhile. She is very ineffective &amp; does not make for a good viewing of a debate.
@ChrisCuomo I highly doubt they would have gotten ANYTHING had they stayed in longer. That is opinion but if they are championing this cause they should not have folded. Honestly they should not begun this 1&amp;if so they should have started soon back in Sept. Oct.
@ChrisCuomo If you were the Pres. &amp; made the same promise he had&amp;now a deal is on the table would YOU do anything for DACA w/out something for the WALL. I get it, the argument you do not agree w/the wall.
@Montel_Williams @GOP some how they are the honest broker here FALSE! Both sides on this issue does not look good in the HISTORY OF IT!
@Montel_Williams @GOP Only when there base put them in the hot seat is when they decide to act. True indeed gang of 8 made an attempt but that was when Dems was in control &amp; if my memory is correct not a single BILL was put up for a vote. SO DEMS ACTING VIRTUOUS in wanting to take care of this &amp;
@Montel_Williams @GOP Both sides are wrong but if you are going to tell the story then lets tell it all. GOP operated POORLY in not doing something about DACA (aslo let not pretend GOP is the only one with such a history)but Dems had opportunities to take care of this matter as well.
@ChrisCuomo Why do you have @KellyannePolls on? She is ALWAYS combative &amp; comes off SO DEFENSIVE. Even when she is right she does not come across that way. Not cause she is a women but rather just her style as she constantly has to prove she is right, an axe to grind.
@ChrisCuomo SO WRONG! So if you care about Dreamer you do something for them w/out attaching anything to it. Well gee I guess the who issue or debate about dreamers &amp; how they came here &amp; addressing the problem/issues has nothing to do w/what they are asking to be attahched?
@ChrisCuomo Lets be fair @realDonaldTrump DID DREAMERS A FAVOR, by repealing NOW CONGRESS on both sides will have to stop the talking pts. &amp; REALLY ACT &amp; do something. FOR YEARS THIS PROMISE OF DOING SOMETHING HAS BEEN MADE. BOTH SIDES NOT HONEST REPEAL DACA PUTS THEM TO THE FIRE
@ChrisCuomo SPOT ON! With your OPENING!!! But @SenSchumer kept calling on Pres.DT when he felt he was played, then why not go to work back in Sept. or at some pt to work w/Mitch on a deal &amp; leveraging his card to get something going or rolling in his favor.

@AreuCathy Saying @realDonaldTrump has a warped sense of reality is a bit of THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK coming from you! Seriously!
@ChrisCuomo I will be there BOOK IT!
@mschlapp Congress is supposed to be the best of what our society has to offer to not just represent us BUT OFFER SOLUTIONS. So both sides walk away happy. JUST DO NOT SEE THAT but rather this REALITY SHOW CALLED USA GOVT. SMH!
@mschlapp Just the process alone for a law to pass will exhaust the this time line unless they rush through this like a child rushing a 2week school project the night before it is due. No meaningful substantive debate will be had. This is a complex issues w/VALID opposing views.
@mschlapp NOT DOable for this congress! If I am to go on the track record especially recent on how Healthcare was handled 1st in 17 by Reps. then back in 10 by Dems. I do not think anything meaningful will come of it.
@Cmoore704 I like your handle, also I would add It is important to Listen, Listen to what people say, MORE IMPORTANT to listen to what they DON'T SAY! This recent shut has reminded me of this!
@SymoneDSanders TRUTH IS AMERICA LOSE because this is still an issue w/out a solution as of yet.
@SymoneDSanders (it would have been short because both sides would have been rushing the process to end the #SchumerShutdown) or the 17day they just bought them selves. I hear no one speaking to this pt.but rather which side won (including myself).
@SymoneDSanders Honestly w/such a complex issue&amp;I get it you are a liberal but the other side has valid issues as well BOTH SIDES DO! So a bill of this magnitude of importance put together in a short time of a govt. shut down
@SymoneDSanders Simply put DACA is dreaming if they thought they were going to get a bill out of this. Honestly objectively speaking w/Dems in the minority how much would they have gotten if they put a bill together. Also HOW GOOD WOULD THAT BILL BE HAD IT BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN SUCH A SHORT TIME?
@John_Kass SPOT ON! Where was the so called conviction! Reps are not angels in this either. They could have taken cared DACA issue long ago as well, perhaps before Healthcare.
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris Also only reason we are here now is Pres. DT repealed DACA had he not I highly doubt it would be here where it is now.
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris that everyone (not congress but the nation)can be a bit happy with. Instead we have a kick the can for 17days that because of the process in passing a law alone will prevent anything meaning full. Do not have confidence in congress.
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris A group of 10 or 20 with equal representatives from both sides could begin the work on this back in September then every 2 or 3wks bring it to the floor so the respective bodies &amp; parties can evaluate it &amp; perhaps offer additions to it &amp; by now we would have had a bill on dreamer
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris But in congress it seems to be a never ending show just to play the public like puppets to make them believe you are fight &amp; actually nothing at all is being done. Why couldn't they begin talks back in September. It is 100 of them in the Senate &amp; 500 plus in the house.
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris Not yelling at you just stress a point but I will turn it off. But there is the problem too much politics at play. Everyone rational person knows You cannot get everything your want. A lot of Americans know this in their marriages, friendships, work&amp; many other facets of life.
@Cmoore704 @SenKamalaHarris I know this but this is NOT AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP JUST YESTERDAY. It has been on going. I am also not speaking to or about just her. All of congress all sides. If this was the private sector I HIGHLY DOUBT IT WOULD HAPPEN THE WAY IT HAS  FOR AS LONG AS IT HAS.
@SenKamalaHarris I think it is STUPID&amp;NOTHING IF ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT WOULD COME FROM THIS! To handle a complex issue such as immigration in 17day&amp;those handling it ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT POLITIC&amp;KEEPING THEIR JOB(This means you as well KH)THAN WORKING THIS OUT SENSIBLY. BOTH SIDES TO BLAME!

@GiannoCaldwell WORST THING IS THEY R THE SAME PLACE THEY STARTED BEFORE ALL OF THIS! Which was/is we'll take this up once the CR passes. SMH LOL! Though I don't blame them 4not believing that it would have actually happened based on Reps. action. BUT STILL EGG ON THEIR FACES! #ShumerShutdown
RT @GiannoCaldwell: Sounds about right. https://t.co/iGNLN9O24I
@KirstenPowers I agree with you to an extent but this issue just as many have many layers to it. Some valid and some NOT AT ALL VALID!
@ChrisCuomo Pt is bothsides would rather continue 2B an issue rather than solve it. Both benefit from gettin votes off the issue w/out having 2do something. PresDT did them a favor by repealin DACA(WHICH HE IS WELL W/IN HIS RIGHT)bcuz now congress is forced 2really VOTE&amp;Show where they stand
@katumbagerald99 @GiannoCaldwell You are alive &amp; hopefully in good health or getting better, THAT ALONE IS ENOUGH, or SHOULD BE!

@Education4Libs While everyone out there keeps trying to figure this out the Pres. @realDonaldTrump just keeps WINNING!! I do not agree w/a lot from him how he does things or how he says things but I give credit. WINNING!!! https://t.co/ZPUSx9pen9

@PeteHegseth @OutnumberedFNC I disagree Pete on the Nuclear option. That is the cheap &amp; easy way out to governing. MUST HAVE COMPROMISE! Esp. in a nation that is overwhelmingly LIBERAL! The minority still gets a say. Especially on issue Like HEALTHCARE, BUDGET MUST HAVE 60%
@Education4Libs You are missing a big point. Pres. Trump DOES NOT MATTER IN THIS! If congress pass a budget that the Pres. does not like, there is nothing he can do about it. Congress controls the purse.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats @GOP @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @Team_Mitch WITH FOREIGN NATIONS W/OUT CONGRESS APPROVAL. AT THAT POINT THE PRES. IS MEANINGLESS! #SCHUMERSHUTDOWN
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats @GOP @SenSchumer &amp; @realDonaldTrump @Team_Mitch WHO YOU ALL WORK FOR HAVE SENT. THE PRES. CAN BE A MUTE VOICE IF YOU ALL DO YOUR JOBS. I SEEM TO REMEMBER THE SENATE W/98% VOTING FOR IT STRAPPED THE PRES. HAND IN LIFTING AGREEMENTS
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats @GOP @SenSchumer &amp; @realDonaldTrump @Team_Mitch WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP. WELL HAD YOU ALL HAD DONE YOUR JOB (ON THIS FRONT THE HOUSE HAS DONE THEIRS) MAYBE PRES. TRUMP WOULD NOT BE PRES. TODAY. HE IS THE GRENADE THE THE PEOPLE
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats @GOP @SenSchume @Team_MitchAs a voter THAT DID NOT VOTE FOR Pres. Trump I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE MANY IN HOUSE&amp;SENATE HAVE BEEN IN DC FOR DECADES&amp;STOOD SILENT ON MANY ISSUES NOW

@NancyPelosi You are 77yrs old been in congress about 30yrs&amp;STILL PLAYING GAMES! YOU KNOW IT TAKES 60%. DEMS&amp;REPS are to blame for us getting here. Dems could of done something in 08-10 so could of Reps in 2012. But today there is NOTHING IN THE BILL YOUR PARTY DISAGREE WITH #SchumerShutdown
@cristinalaila1 Can we get rid of some of these Dem. for DERELICTION OF DUTY OR SOMETHING OR BREACH OF OATH! They are suppose to be serving USA CITIZENS but they are not! #SCHUMERSHUTDOWN
@LawrenceBJones3 I am not either a bit disappointed that he could not get everyone on board! I am certainly 1 that loves to see the Rep. party disagree &amp; display that to get to the very best they can offer rather than the fall in line party politics LIKE DEMS BUT THIS IS 1 TIME THEY SHOULD OFF!

@EmilyCompagno VERY TRUE Dems could of taken care of it in 08- 10 but so could Reps in 12 when Pres. Obama signed DACA and urged them to do something.
@LeslieMarshall You need 60% When was the last time either party had a 60% Senate Majority? #SchumerShutdwon  to be fair Reps. should have taken cared of this in 12 when they had control as well. At least I can be objective on this. #SchumerShutdown
@LeslieMarshall You are far too intelligent for this statement. TAKE YOUR BIAS OUT OF IT! Dems claim they are for Dreamer A LONG TIME, in 08-10 the had a wider senate majority than the Reps. do today &amp;THEY DID NOTHING! Pres. Obama could have granted a Regan like pardon/AMNESTY.
@JoyAnnReid #SchummerSHUTdown
@JoyAnnReid TRUMP COULD OF GIVEN DACA AS WELL AND DEMS WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED! BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT HIM TO SUCCEED!
@SenSchumer No it will be CALLED #SchummerSHUTdown because you did not do what you should have done for those YOU PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT &amp; NOW THAT IS EXPOSED YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE FACE https://t.co/isTrPUuBVK #SCHUMERSHUTDOWN
@EmilyCompagno Dems could have taken cared of DACA when they had a wider senate majority back in 08- 10 w/out Reps. Now DACA SEE THEM FOR LIARS&amp;THEY ARE DOING DAMAGE CONTROL W/ #SchummerSHUTdown  https://t.co/isTrPUuBVK
@jahutchin @JoyAnnReid #SchummerSHUTdown  He could of had this is be a non issue when his party was in power. They did not care&amp; now Dreamer are angry becuz Dems Lied!  https://t.co/isTrPUuBVK
@JoyAnnReid YOU ARE FULL OF IT! DEMS, @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer DOES NOT CARE ABOUT DACA, if they did THEY WOULD OF TAKEN CARE OF THIS BACK IN 08- 10 WITHOUT THE NEED OF REP. SUPPORT! THEY HAD A WIDER MAJORITY THEN THAN NOW! #SCHUMERSHUTDOWN
@cristinalaila1 Charity Begins at home then spreads abroad! AMERICANS FIRST THEN ANYONE ELSE! DACA WAS NOT BORN HERE THEY COME SECOND! TAKE CARE OF HOME FIRST! #SchummerSHUTdown
@CNN Democrats ALSO VOTED FOR THIS BILL AS WELL #SchumerShutdown Americans first THEN OTHERS! Charity begins at home spreads abroad! Take care of AMERICAN CITIZENS FIRST THEN EVERYONE ELSE!
@JoyAnnReid @SenMajLdr SMH! Dems are exposed as FRAUDS! They claim to be for a base of voters &amp; when the base finally got fed up they decide to PRETEND TO DO SOMETHING! They had control 08 to 2010 Pres. Obama could of granted a PARDON OR AMNESTY prior to leaving office like Regan did. #SchummerSHUTdown
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Where was this concern for DACA in 2008 to 2010 or even 2012 or 2014. FONY! #SchummerSHUTdown
@ACLU This is SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF @SenSchumer Dems failed to keep their promise to a base of voters &amp; because of facing heat because they were begin to appear Fraudulent they pretend they cared now. I wonder where this concern was in 08-10. #SchummerSHUTdown
@Rreis1972 @ACLU What R U smoking Dems been saying they R 4 DACA 4ages&amp;when they had control they DID NOTHING (becuz they did not care) Pres. Obama like Regan could of granted a pardon/amnesty&amp;DID NOTHING! Now they want 2hitch this wagon 2a bill&amp;BLAME IT ON TRUMP&amp;U R FALLING 4IT #SchummerSHUTdown
@SenKamalaHarris NO DREAMER IS TO BE PART OF THIS! YOUR PARTY HAD CONTROL AND DID NOTHING, NOW YOU ARE FACING THE HEAT YOU ARE DECIDING TO PLAY POLITICS NOW. HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THE VETS IN YOU STATE TO THIS #SchummerSHUTdown WHEN THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL YOUR PARTY IS AGAINST
@NYGovCuomo Well CALL UP YOUR PAL @SenSchumer AND TELL HIM TO GET ON BOARD! #SchumerShutdown
@HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Seems to me Dems do not want Pres. Trump to succeed. Dems WOULD NOT DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING IN THE BILL BUT WANT TO HITCH A WAGON to this because THEY REALLY NEVER CARED ABOUT IMMIGRANT back in 08-10 OR NOW. FAKE FONNIE #SchumerShutdown
@NYGovCuomo STUPID COMMENT FROM AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT IS PLAY POLITICS &amp;TAKING HIS CONSTITUENTS AS FOOLS! IDIOTIC! You know it takes 60% to pass as budget so unless 60% Reps. in Senate then Dems have to vote! House passed it Pres did a lot YOUR PARTY OWNS THIS 1 #SchummerSHUTdown
@LawrenceBJones3 This #SchummerSHUTdown is sad and TRAGIC! Politics at its worsts. Everything you would agree with but still would not vote &amp; can only put together a small bill for a temporary extension
@JoyAnnReid Don't you mean the #SchummerSHUTdown
@Bakari_Sellers YOU ARE SMOKING SOMETHING, You just said of the Reps. there is no TRUST! What about Dems.&amp;their fake concern for DREAMERS! They could of taken care of this problem LONG AGO in 08-10 &amp;DID NOT! To be fair so could the Reps. since 2012 to now.
@Education4Libs Dems are FONNIE! One moment they are fighting for DACA that they claim to be fighting for BUT DID NOTHING FOR in 08-10 WHEN THEY HAD A WIDER MAJORITY &amp; did not need Reps help to do anything. but now they fight for it or no is it CHIP? SMH

@ChrisCuomo And many in the media are not bringing these points to the table. Keep the show going I enjoy it.
@ChrisCuomo only one to push back according to reports was LGraham. Same is to be said of the Pres. with the comments made. He probably knew it was going to get back to the press. I am only guessing here and made the comments. Both sides are doing it and we are getting no where.
@ChrisCuomo Does us nor the nation NO GOOD OR DACA and drives us further apart. Cory Booker aggrandizing today with his display. Funny how this same anger that was displayed on television was not displayed to the other dems. in the room when the comments was made &amp;
@ChrisCuomo You have two sides of this argument. And the adults  in the room(elected officials that were charged with a job because they said they knew best or equipped for the job) instead of doing what needs to be done they are playing politics &amp; instigating their base on both sides.
@ChrisCuomo so they are not looking for work to the point they are no longer counted in the unemployment numbers. All of this to the larger conversation of the immigration &amp; some peoples disdain. So here we are should we pack them up and send them home or can they stay.
@ChrisCuomo because of Unions neg. coupled with left wing politics to force pay increase coupled with GREED this all contributes to a frustration and anger. It also does not help to keep policies that keep people on Govt. assisted programs for decades sometimes generation
@ChrisCuomo he is calling countries SHIT HOLES. Many feel this way even if they would not use this colorful language, and I do not say this to excuse or as to some how play down what the Pres. said. Just having the real conversation. People are fed up, companies hire lower wages workers, &amp;
@ChrisCuomo &amp;SOME UNPLEASANT CONVERSATION. Fact is if congress had been doing their job perhaps there would not be this VOID of then candidate Trump to tap into to get voted in&amp;NOW BE THE ONE TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION Which you can say of N.Korea as well. So here we are&amp;
@ChrisCuomo Partially right, it is also about those who are USA citizens&amp;how they feel about the matter even if they are wrong or you or I may disagree. This can has been kicked for far too long&amp;we are now forced to find a solution that is bringing up A LOT OF HONEST, REAL
@ChrisCuomo I do not know nor can I speak for a lot of people but I know from a lot that was reported that a wall from end to end is not practical. I do &amp; would like to have one where there can be one, but also STEPPING UP PATROL, MORE IMPORTANTLY SYSTEM TO TRACK THOSE OVER STAYING VISAS
@ChrisCuomo Watch about half the show tonight and I MUST SAY YOU ASKED HONEST&amp;FAIR questions on both sides! VERY FAIR &amp; OBJECTIVE!!! Don't agree w/you much but always keep an open mind &amp; I was please on what I saw tonight. Keep it going! 9pm time slot is your will be watching!
@foxandfriends @SebGorka If citizens have to follow the law ELECTED GOVT. OFFICIAL DO NOT GET A PASS! They do not get to ignore the law. There are provisions such as for Police to speed &amp; run red light, stop signs when needed. As a matter of fact they should uphold the law&amp;set the example.

Here is the thing in a RAPIDLY CHANGING JOB MARKET WHERE JOBS ARE CONSTANTLY PHASED OUT&amp;COLLEGE DEGREES ARE NOT WORTH WHAT THEY USE TO,
@NYGovCuomo SCAM, 1st take my tax$ to fund State&amp;community colleges so it's affordable but then make it unaffordable so u can CON more $ from them to pay for the HIGH PRICE TENURED MAJORITY LIBERAL PROFESSORS. Oh &amp;the kicker is COLLEGE IS NOT MANDATORY So those who don't go still have to pay

@GOPBlackChick Not giving him a pass just putting everything in its own lane. Just because the Pres. is wrong does not mean you (CBooker) get to beat up on one of the workers that had nothing to do with it.
@GOPBlackChick NOT RIGHT! Had congress been doing their job perhaps THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED IN A PRESIDENT THAT DESCRIBES LESS WELL TO DO COUNTRIES AS SHIT HOLES.
@GOPBlackChick uphold the laws, not disclose what was said in a closed door private meeting that has already been disclosed. This is not to defend Pres. DT words or actions but to scold her WAS TOTALLY UNFAIR &amp; UNJUST JUST TO SCORE POLITICAL POINT IN MY VIEW! She is now collateral damage.
@GOPBlackChick Further more she was in a closed door private meeting w/her boss. He boss did not plot to commit a crime that we know of so asking her to betray the confidence or privacy of her boss. Yes she is being paid by the USA citizens but her job is to secure our boarders and keep us safe
@GOPBlackChick I share his displeasure about the matter but lets also put this in perspective, HE IS GRAND STAND A BIT! You are asking her what she heard, which he already believes @SenatorDurbin so I will venture a guess that if she had answered NO he would not believe her.
@JeffFlake They are human so we understand mistakes are made. All you say I agree with BUT LETS BE ALSO FAIR OR BALANCE in your criticism&amp;SPEAK TO THE PRESS WHO HAS TAKEN THIS GREAT LIBERTY&amp;TODAY OFTEN RUN WILD WITH IT! If you don't then it can seem as you are settling a score.
@JeffFlake THAT OFTEN IS OVER LOOKED RATHER THAN ON THE FRONT PAGE JUST AS BIG AS THE ORIGINAL MISTAKE! NEVER HAPPENS! THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESS HAS TO DO! SPEAK JUST AS LOUD IN APOLOGIES OR RETRACTIONS AS THEY DO IN MAKING THE MISTAKE!
@JeffFlake I commend what you are doing but you ONLY SPEAK TO ONE END OF THE SUBJECT! The press often report the news today from One perspective Left or Right but the perspective &amp; OFTEN HAVE INACCURACIES! When they correct themselves IT IS OFTEN BURIED ON SOME PAGE

@RepGregoryMeeks @msnbc Had you or your party or @BarackObama @POTUS44 had cared like you claim you do then He would have granted a PARDON OR AMNESTY. But you did not, nor did he but you are on @MSNBC bloviate about this &amp; how you will make a stand to paint yourself as 1 that is virtuous
@RepGregoryMeeks @MSNBC YOU ARE SO PHONY!!!! Your PARTY HAS CLAIMED TO SUPPORT DACA FOR YEARS BUT HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE! You were part of congress in 08&amp;10 that had a wider MAJORITY THAN REPS. TODAY! Not 1 BILL GOT A VOTE ON THIS SUBJECT! But here you are in typical fashion PLAYING POLITICS!
@Laurie_March MEEE! I DO!!! Hazelnut please?
@Lennar @WCILifestyle Nah, not crazy about it.
@GOPBlackChick Maybe not, he switches so much perhaps he will become a liberal once again. See the business man goes with what makes money so there you go. Just calling all of this unconventional craziness like I see it. Like something &amp; don't like somethings.
@PhilyRepub90 @GOPBlackChick Now the same Dems. who did nothing in 08-10 are now in the minority but suddenly wants to dig in and fight. And immigrants still support them FAITHFULLY! CRAZY!
@PhilyRepub90 @GOPBlackChick Now I will credit Reps w/ moving a bit to the middle in wanting to do something for DACA or entertaining giving them legal status coupled w/some conditions, which is giving the Dems exactly what they been calling for. SMH
@PhilyRepub90 @GOPBlackChick Then Pres. Obama could of granted a pardon or amnesty for them&amp;did not. He kick the can by Executive order of DACA. Reps are also complicit because in 2012 they had majority &amp; did nothing when Pres. Obama urged for something to be done. I do not recall any proposal of a bill.
@PhilyRepub90 @GOPBlackChick Well Dems who call themselves the CHAMPIONS of IMMIGRANTS&amp;DACA could of done something from08-10 w/out any need of Reps. But THEY DID NOT! Mind you they had a larger majority than Reps do today.
@GOPBlackChick SAD! To follow a man or anyone &amp; be that loyal &amp; you have NEVER MET THEM OR KNOW THEM INTIMATELY CRAZY! ONLY ONE I FOLLOW THAT MUCH &amp; NEVER HAVE MET IN THE PHYSICAL IS MY GOD!
@GOPBlackChick Not sure if it is dead but DEFINITELY LOOKS THAT WAY! He did himself NO FAVORS AT ALL! The underlying message may be a fair question but NO EXCUSE HOW HE SENT IT! Thus the receiver of the message WILL NEVER HEAR IT EVEN THOUGH IT BE A GREAT 1 because of his OFFENSE!
@GOPBlackChick Great response!
@GOPBlackChick Very sad but if he is married and wife is not deported then she must be a citizen or he had children here. Not an expert on Immigration law but why didn't he go for his citizenship or become legal? More to this story!
@GOPBlackChick VERY!!!
@GOPBlackChick There is A LOT OF THEM!
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Who know these are all good questions!!!
@DREAMerJ_D @TuckerCarlson @Foxnews at that point as to follow laws about fire safety.
@DREAMerJ_D @TuckerCarlson @Foxnews understandably those at the door wanting entry w/out a ticket are upset as well at those inside that have friends or family at the door that cannot get in, but surely it is up to the host/owner of the venue to determine who is getting in
@DREAMerJ_D @TuckerCarlson @Foxnews STOP! We're not in the industrial age. Think of it like this THere's a function at a venue&amp;it can hold only so much! So at a particular point once it's almost to full capacity they stop letting people walk in to allow those w/prepaid ticket in.

@GOPBlackChick WHICH ARE VALID QUESTIONS &amp; WE AS A NATION HAVE TO ASK&amp;ANSWER THE QUESTIONS But what he said &amp; how he goes about it NOT THE WAY! IE The travel restriction or the restrictions of transgender in the military. And others.
@GOPBlackChick HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE JOB OR HOW IT WORKS FALLS SHORT. He is a billionaire, he did not get up one day and go out to buy a lottery ticket&amp;became a billionaire. HE IS SMART, so he has to know what he is doing &amp;the ramifications of it. I get the underlying message or topic
@GOPBlackChick For majority of us Defenses automatically goes up &amp; no matter how great a plan or true the message is NO ONE WILL HEAR IT OR WANT TO. He has been Pres. a few days short of a year so the comments of THIS IS WHO HE IS, OR HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN, OR
@GOPBlackChick This is true but you know how this will be played out, so why craft the statement the way he did knowing you will be called a racist and the history of comments since his candidacy to now. No matter if the comments are true NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR THEIR NATION IS A SHIT HOLE.
RT @KhmerTimes: Shigeharu Shirai was arrested on Wednesday evening in Lopburi province, 150 kilometres north of the capital, Bangkok. Polic…
@GOPBlackChick OR EVEN DISCUSS. HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS? Now if this is the message the Pres. was trying to make I DO NOT KNOW NOR AM I SAYING IT IS! Then he shot himself in the foot with how he said what he said.
@GOPBlackChick once it is approaching full capacity those at the door will be understandably upset that they cannot get in but as a matter of safety you then at that point have to slow down entry or once packed stop entry completely. But these are question no one wants to ask, answer or face
@GOPBlackChick Also why aren't we discussing about this issue about helping those nations become better nations to take care of their own rather than simply yes you want to come here SURE HAVE AT IT! Thing is when going to a venue the venue can only hold so much people&amp;
@GOPBlackChick IS WE NOW ARE FACING EITHER TODAY OR IN THE NEAR HORIZON A BIG ISSUE! As far a categorizing other peoples country as a SHIT HOLE IS ABHORRENT! Even if they flee those countries for the better opportunities here they do not want their homeland to be described as a SHIT HOLE!
@GOPBlackChick NOT EARLY 1900's so who&amp;on what basis do we let immigrant in, in an ever expand stretching NATION w/MANY ISSUES OF IT'S OWN! We man not like how the question was phased but none the less this PROBLEM WE HAVE WHETHER PEOPLE CHOOSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT OR NOT
@GOPBlackChick question. Which can be (I cannot speak for the Pres. nor can I say this is what he meant or that is what he meant) but listening or reading it, it is a valid question we as a nation HAVE TO ASK? How or who do we let in or accept &amp; on what basis? IT IS NOT LONGER THE LATE 1800s
@GOPBlackChick The Pres. used bad language &amp; said something that can easily be interpreted &amp; easily a case can be made for Racism. I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT AGREE WITH HOW HE SAID WHAT HE SAID OR WHAT HE SAID. I am how ever able to put emotions aside for a moment &amp; look at the underlying message or
@ChrisCuomo CONVERSATION TO SOLVE AN ISSUE OUR NATION IS HAVING BUT MANY INSTEAD OF DOING SO shy away from the tough questions as if they would go away. I will also add on both sides of the issues something may or may not be tougher for some.
@ChrisCuomo Many question this same question about our constitution or values as a nation when it comes to other matters such as Homosexual Marriage. I am not giving a stance here just making the point that all of this is VERY TOUGH QUESTION &amp;
@ChrisCuomo Answer would be from most is they are the ones that need the most help. Which is also a VERY CREDIBLE ANSWER but the whole discussion &amp; part of it which should not be but in reality is, is race. We are not longer in the early 1900's should our values stay the same.
@ChrisCuomo Now for his point or message which is a fair one if you choose to interpret or read it this way, why do we accept people from horrible places or less to do &amp; not more from well to do countries. VALID QUESTION TO ASK.
@ChrisCuomo In NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM DO I DEFEND THE CHOICE OF WORD THE PRESIDENT USED NOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY IS TO EXONERATE OR EXCUSE WHAT HE SAID, because how he said it UNDERCUTS HIS OWN MESSAGE&amp; LEAVES IT TO BE EASILY INTERPRETED AS RACIST EVEN IF IT IS NOT!
@ChrisCuomo Like this interview, not agreeing w/everything you are saying but liking the show.
@DanaPerino @NicolleDWallace @LisaMarieBoothe @Laurie_March @KatiePavlich @cabernetfanc HOW CUTE IS THIS LITTLE ONE! https://t.co/gWNpgxBbF0
@ChrisCuomo You are harping so much on Pres. Trump &amp; his flexibility or change on the wall. Justifiably so. HELP ME HERE, were you the same way w/Pres. Obama &amp;his change on Gay Marriage or immigration or other issues. Not saying you were or were not just asking?
@ChrisCuomo This is a good interview but @KellyannePolls You come across SO DEFENSIVE &amp; COMBATIVE THAT gives a bad appearance. Every single little word you jump upon &amp; harp on that style wise Kellyanne looks bad,defensive guilty of something. Do not look cool calm &amp;assured!

@ShepNewsTeam So SSmith because things are leaking all the time is it your opinion that it is okay that Sen. DFeinstein do so? Your commentary can&amp;is easily interpretted as if u r okay w/her leaking. Could be you are just reporting the news but w/your tone can be read differently
@Lennar YOU ARE ON A ROLL! LOVE THIS KITCHEN! Usually I am critical but last few KITCHENS I HAVE LOVED!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump you are doing the same to perhaps garner popularity, to bolster future political aspirations. SHAME ON YOU!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump to have CONGRESS DO THEIR JOB, WHAT THEY HAVE SAID THEY WANT OR WAS GOING TO DO FOR YEARS &amp; NEVER DO! They have only played political football with the issue (ON BOTH SIDES) only to get votes&amp;
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump YOU DO NOT SEE THIS RATHER YOU PLAY POLITICS WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE BASED UPON YOUR PERSONAL VIEW&amp;FEELINGS. NOT WHAT AN AG IS SUPPOSE TO DO! Not in the job description! Hope you read this&amp;rethink your approach. Lead a march lead a charge
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump SO BY TRUMP REMOVING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH CONSTITUTIONALLY HE CAN BECAUSE IT IS NOT LAW, IT IS FORCING POLITICIAN TO STOP GIVING SPEAKING POINT, FAILED &amp; BROKEN PROMISES &amp; REALLY SHOW WHERE THEY STAND ON THIS ISSUE &amp; DO THEIR JOB &amp; PASS A BILL!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump Pres. Obama just kicked the can down the road. He urged congress to act, then they DID NOTHING, @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @Team_Mitch @SpeakerRyan &amp; many others did NOTHING! NO LAW WAS PASSED ON THIS!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump Removing an EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH YOU CERTAINLY KNOW IS NOT LAW! IS IN NO WAY UNCONSTITUTIONAL! You are so blinded by your bias &amp; personal view that YOU CANNOT SEE THAT PRES. TRUMP DID YOU &amp; ALL THOSE WHO YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR A FAVOR!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump SAME FOR A JUDGE! TO RENDER JUDGEMENT ON PERSONAL FEELINGS! If you feel strongly about this as you obviously do then you should STEP DOWN FROM BEING AN AG &amp;BECOME AN ACTIVIST OR RUN FOR CONGRESS WHERE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN WRITING LAWS!
@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump You are playing politics with the law! You are an AG! You are to carry out the law EVEN THE ONES YOU DO  NOT LIKE! YOU ARE TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL FEELING FROM IT! Once you bring personal feeling into the law JUSTICE IS NO LONGER BLIND!
@AGBecerra SHAME ON YOU, AND SHAME ON CONGRESS!
@AGBecerra @XavierBecerra THEY SHOULD OF DONE SOMETHING ON THIS SOONER! NOW PRES. TRUMP IS DOING THE SAME IN A MORE FORCEFUL WAY &amp; NOW CONGRESS WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING&amp;YOU TAKE OFFENSE TO IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM! Your BIAS IS GUIDING YOU, AND THAT IS NEVER GOOD FOR AN AG!
@AGBecerra @XavierBecerra Why do the so called brightest among us behave in such a petulant manner when they do not get their way? Even Pres. Obama said way back when that he cannot make the laws and HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER IS NOT THE SOLUTION! HE URGED CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING,
@AGBecerra @XavierBecerra THIS GETS TO THE SUPREME COURT I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. Spend your energy if you choose to champion this cause by pushing for congress to make proper LAWS to protect these people.
@AGBecerra @XavierBecerra it is signed it, it can be removed EXECUTIVE ORDERS! You are doing a PISS POOR JOB as a STATE AG by playing politics w/the law. The LAW IS NOT SOMETHING FICKLE THAT YOU CAN PLAY POLITICS WITH!
@AGBecerra @XavierBecerra DACA is an executive thus it is NOT LAW or LEGAL! It is enforced until it is challenged by a court. LAWS are made by CONGRESS! NOT THE PRESIDENT! Your beef should be w/congress to have them make a law! Every1 knows &amp;so should you, just as easy as

@ManhattanDA With this we are now acting like zombies. No thought behind our actions just that it meets the cool social activism test. Rikers needs reforming, system needs tweeking but closing Rikers Island? SMH!
@ManhattanDA &amp; elected officials The ones elected because they are supposedly more apt to handle these issue or knowledgeable to take on these issues are victim of it as well. I better be in on the in crowd or on the right side of the social activism or I will not be sociably acceptable.
@ManhattanDA One would think the way to close jails is prevent crime, help those who are subceptable to crime find a different path in life. No I GUESS "CLOSING RIKERS ISLAND" SOUNDS VIRTUOUS &amp; SOCIABLY COOL on the social activism front. FOOLISH! This is the new thing that guides us a society
@ManhattanDA We are talking about CLOSING JAILS rather than reaching out to those who are more likely to commit crime from a statistical view and see if we can help them. No rather Lets close the Jail that is supposed to be used to jail criminals!

@MoniquePressley @mariashriver @Oprah The treatment of women in the work place, treatment of women in society by some, by many that is unsavory, putting it mild. Also other matter on this subject not just the harassment/sexual mistreatment. Hope I'm reading it correct when summarizing the concerns or cause or issue
@NYPD113Pct Sad, does it have a tracker or one of those chips?
@AprilDRyan @Oprah general population interest because we have moved on to the next it thing. SAD VERY SAD!
@AprilDRyan @Oprah It is cool for the moment or I do not want to be the one to not say or do the socially acceptable thing. Case in point kneeling for the flag in the NFL that has lost it's legs in participation as well as media coverage, &amp;
@AprilDRyan @Oprah But I get it if you have a little to unknown name or face the same words may not go as far, AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM I AM SPEAKING TO! So when we cheer Oprah's speech many of us treat the problem like the latest fashion trend.
@AprilDRyan @Oprah so much of her but rather us in how we swoon over her words w/out some balance. Like Oprah on that night but would have LOVED MORE TO SEE SOME OF THOSE WOMEN ON STAGE, NAMES WE MAY NOT KNOW WHO PAID A PRICE TO BE THE FACE OR NAME/S OF THE NIGHT.
@AprilDRyan @Oprah The speech was great &amp; moving just want some balance or objectivity in its reception. Where were all the women that said something to only be ridiculed off into obscurity or blacklisted? I like OPRAH &amp; JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE HAS DONE, SHE IS A PIONEER so this critique is not
@AprilDRyan @Oprah Because it is popular or accepted. It is not hard to do. Not calling her out but rather us the public in view of it. Also in her speech she spoke to just women in moving us all forward as if men will not or should not be part of it.
@AprilDRyan @Oprah I know she has her own history w/this on an even more personal level so I do not question her sincerity in what she has said or what is in her heart but now that those who had done THE HARD THINGS&amp;PAID A PRICE FOR IT! It is VERY EASY NOW TO COME OUT &amp; SPEAK UP!
@AprilDRyan @Oprah SHe has the mass appeal but MANY VOTER WANT MORE THAN THAT! AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUES! Suddenly we the general population(generalizing here)flock to her as some answer to remedy us all after her speech. WHERE WAS HER VOICE 2yrs ago on this or 5yrs ago on this?
@mariashriver @MoniquePressley @Oprah champion of this cause when so many others have paid a grave price is a disappointment.
@mariashriver @MoniquePressley @Oprah Yes ABSOLUTELY &amp; IF SO WHERE WAS HER VOICE ON THIS WHEN THERE WAS NO #MEETOO When it was not cool to speak up on this subject? Her as a woman where was she. Not doubting her sincerity or questioning what is in here heart but to hold her up on this issue as the

@GOPBlackChick so far &amp; would love to see more done for the Black community &amp; also the lower class &amp; impoverished alike no matter the race. Would love to see MUCH MORE DONE WITH SKILLED BASED TRAINING JOB. Perhaps the WH can have some sort of coalition sponsored job training or expo
@GOPBlackChick Yes he Pres. DT deserves some credit but lets also look at it objectively. I got the numbers as the were on the way down not up like how Pres. Obama got them. I am not fan of Pres. Obama but that does not prevent me from calling it straight. Like what I am seeing in this regard

AROgers held a clip board &amp; took notes for 2 or 3yrs &amp; arguably the best QB today. Also Belichick can replace Brady w/an ELI
@NYDNSports Point is Brady is afraid of Garoppolo taking his spot like he did Bledsoe. It will not last forever &amp; if reports are true it is SELFISH OF HIM TO WANT TO GET RID OF GAROPPOLO! Belichick is right you have to prepare, that is why we have so many teams now

@RepAdamSchiff @SenGillibrand I'll tell you what he is doing knowingly or unknowingly(I believe the later)is he is shining a light on the LONG STANDING HYPOCRISY&amp;FILTH going on in WashDC among bureaucrat&amp;politicians alike by some of his own actions&amp;statements being questioned of many. DC deserves this
@funder because of some believable allegation THAT CAN VERY WELL BE TRUE OR FALSE&amp; ALSO THE PEOPLE VOTED HIM IN KNOWN THIS. She is making a name for herself right now.
@funder I recognize that there can be sexual overtone to the comment but do I think this no not because I want to cover for him I am not on the TRUMP TRAIN JUST CALL IT DOWN THE MIDDLE! Also didn't Sen. KirstenG draw first blood by calling for his resignation
@funder Interesting take on this or spin. It is a fair view. Thing is non of us truly know what Pres. Trump meant. He often does as he did on the campaign trail&amp;as he does today make vague statements&amp;LEAVE IT UP TO THE REST OF US TO TRY&amp;INTERPRET.
@ezradf @AprilDRyan That is up for debate in a nation of vast differences. SORRY YOU ARE OFF ON THAT ONE! I would think she is a great lady though
@deray judge all of this and standard we now keep. IN A WEIRD IRONIC WAY ONE CAN ARGUE HE IS DRAINING THE SWAMP when we judge his behavior we now have to look at others hold them to the same measure.
@deray we point the finger &amp; excoriate him but when it happens we all now have to face the fact that we have to hold ALL others in DC to the same standard no matter how eloquent &amp; presidential or politically correct they may be. Not a defense of Pres. Trump just highlighting the way we
@deray because of his winning there are a lot of cause&amp;effect the ripples through&amp;now we know congress is full of sexual assaults&amp;misbehavior&amp;as far as your mention of lies WELL that is nothing new coming from DC or any politician. So what may seem as the worst to many (Pres. Trump)
@deray Point taken but the irony is that Pres. Trump election ILLUMINATES THE HYPOCRISY &amp; FILTH IN DC. I wonder had he not been elected would these sex scandals come to light. Not saying he brought them to light but because of the anger &amp; discourse in our social fabric
@cabernetfanc @Teroforma Man, you are a wine lover. Guess these fires in CA is not making you happy apart from the tragedy to those affected this is also a down side to it pale in comparison.

@Cynfulfan @glaad @MegynTODAY @NBCNews @TODAYshow Not trying to at all twist if I misunderstood then my apologies. I am just saying if someone has a view that they do not agree w/gay life style or LGBTQ that is okay. We are not going to like each other.
@Cynfulfan @glaad @MegynTODAY @NBCNews @TODAYshow I also believe being GAY is a sin, &amp; do not believe in GAY marriage. But would not EVER deny someone that is gays, housing financing, insurance, WEDDING CAKE, or anything else in life.
@Cynfulfan @glaad @MegynTODAY @NBCNews @TODAYshow I guess only people that should have a voice is those who agree with GAYS? I believe in equal treatment, and the bakers should bake the cake, I also think we should not make everything a federal case &amp; if the bakers said no then just go have someone else do it.

@brianstelter @AprilDRyan Yes but that was in May, vs now. Case in point in May we all thought HIGHLY of Matt Lauer vs what many of us think of him today.

@SebGorka Watching you now on @seanhannity all is fine we are speaking of the left but Sean &amp; many on the right should STOP POINTING FINGERS. His own ex-colleague&amp;friend BO'Reilly had his problems as well as EBolling &amp; RAiles. STOP MAKING THIS A LEFT ISSUE,
@seanhannity The PRES. himself  has been accused of similar action. OR HOW ABOUT YOUR OWN EX COLLEAGUE &amp; FRIEND BO'REILLY. If you are going to tell the story TELL IT ALL &amp; COMPLETELY! Don't cherry pick to paint a narrative. There is guilt on both sides.
@seanhannity Watching the first few minutes of your program do not often do but where is the FAIR&amp;BALANCE! You speak on this issue as if it is only happening on the LEFT! Which is a problem you paint it as if it is exclusively a problem on the left. ROY MOORE has his fair share &amp;
@GOPBlackChick This is troubling times, it seems that it is not just a liberal or conservative issue yet both or projecting themselves to be on some higher moral ground. Not good at all! JUST TROUBLING TIME WE ALL ARE FACED WITH.

@RonLybrand @Vershered @SKYRIDER4438 @BarackObama Last note you said I defend Pres. Obama ALL THE TIME! INCORRECT! ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT!
@RonLybrand @Vershered @SKYRIDER4438 @BarackObama I just said I'm willing to give him the benefit of doubt base on what is known so far.
@RonLybrand @Vershered @SKYRIDER4438 @BarackObama when we do the same. Is it possible Pres. Obama knew SURE, but also possible he did not.
@RonLybrand @Vershered @SKYRIDER4438 @BarackObama See we the general public hate politicians 4 playing politics but we do the same ourselves. So how R we to expect better of the 1s we elect

@pageyjim @SKYRIDER4438 @RonLybrand @BarackObama You can hang out or spend time w/someone &amp; not know things about them. We all have a skeleton or two in the closet. HW did not,
@SKYRIDER4438 @RonLybrand @BarackObama He had his daughter intern at the company. Again your speaking to someone who does not like Pres. Obama the President.
@SKYRIDER4438 @RonLybrand @BarackObama Pres. Obama knew about it then that may be different but to know as far as hey he knew of a victim or someone personal is a tough one.
@SKYRIDER4438 @RonLybrand @BarackObama there is A LOT I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM! And we are pretty friendly. It is pretty bad that this is out there. Now if there are rumors &amp;

@stephenasmith THE ATTENTION TO THEIR CAUSE, is that to some, the not stand is taken personal &amp; prevents those who are offend from looking
@stephenasmith which I do not know why they don't because the very act was to SHOCK &amp;PERHAPS EVEN OFFEND TO THE POINT THAT IT DRAWS

@CarolHLN @CameronNewton then it is OFF WITH YOU HEAD! Again not agreeing w/what was said or how it was but to loose a sponsor,
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton Now a day it is best you say very little on nothing cause if you do not fit into the confines of public acceptance
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton not only Cam learning from this but we all as society learn from this because many lesson are to be learned from this.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton Slippery slope we go down when we do this I hope we all take note &amp;
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton offensive is costing this man a job. That is now where we are that speaking up or speaking ones mind can cost you your job.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton are so consciences as it should but to an extreme to the point that a comment that was made that was not overt but yet still
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton None the less here this company jumped out on this quick because the temperature of society on social issues
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton to illustrate the hypocrisy of the NFL &amp; these companies. Not using it to excuse or exonerate RRice or Cam.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton according to reports.They only then caved to public outcry at that point they fired him. HYPOCRISY! I only injected this
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton along w/first video which was horrible but did little until 2nd video came out which confirmed all he said &amp; disclosed
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton the same NFL that was okay w/RRice keeping his job after full disclosure of the events in Jan. or Feb.of 2014
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton So we should then question these companies moral compass. As well as the NFL,
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton I venture a guess that if there was not an outcry about this the company would not have did anything at all.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton Also these companies are just capitulating to the PC mob society we are in now.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton I am not saying when we see wrong or hear it we don't speak up but also have some perspective &amp; balance.
@CarolHLN @CameronNewton WHEN DID WE GET SO SENSITIVE THAT EVERY INFRACTION IS CAUSE FOR SOMEONE TO LOOSE THEIR JOB?

@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams BECAUSE WHETHER IT WAS MEANT TO ON NOT IT HAS BECOME PART OF THE ISSUE!

@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams other cannot tell them not to or how to protest. Hope we have an ACTUAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISSUES, ALL OF IT!
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams Breakdown is protesters have the right to protest but cannot tell others how to view their protest just as how
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams KNEW THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WOULD OFFEND, SHOCK, EVEN ANGER OTHERS! So they achieved that but not exactly how they intended.
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams Also the very act of protest in many instance is to disrupt or make uncomfortable bring attention &amp; many of those KNEELING
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams DON'T GET MAD WHEN OTHERS VIEW IT DIFFERENT THEN HOW THEY INTENDED! ALL SUBJECTIVE!
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams those watching the protest cannot complain about the protesters. IT IS THEIR RIGHT! So when they protest by kneeling
@BrookeBCNN @Montel_Williams I TOTALLY DISAGREE W/IT ALL BUT WILL FIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO! But the protesters cannot complain about how others view their protest just as

@MAFlee @secupp people are in surgery, injured, in pain. YES THE CONSERVATION ON THIS IS NEEDED but if your love one was among those injured or dead
@MAFlee @secupp Or perhaps HC is feeling so irrelevant that she has to politically exploit a tragedy such as this. Now is not the time for this conversation

@BretBaier @SecPriceMD He keeps mentioning that these trips were approved as if that is some sort of excuse. Commonsense was not applied &amp;

@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Goodbye
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain So YOU ARE RIGHT I AM RUNNING BUT NOT FROM A DEBATE BUT RATHER A CONVERSATION THAT IS POINTLESS &amp; LACKING SUBSTANCE OR FACTS!
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain I don't either but that is not a reason to conflate the two.
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain It is rooted in pure opinion &amp; identity politics rather than facts. You attack MMcCain because you don't like what her father did &amp;
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain &amp; you have NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THEM, so the conversation or debate if you want to call it that has become futile.
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain It is not a debate U R just assuming a bunch of stuff from MMcCain is going to bash Pres. Trump 2 where I get my news to now me being a Dems
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain See again you are being ignorant. Offer comment on something you know nothing of! Not smart. You do not even know what I watch. But u assume
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain But go ahead no need to reply. There is no changing your opinion rooted in emotion &amp; identity politics rather than fact. Have a good day!
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain u don't know that u r doing much of what the media&amp;politician do speculate about some1 or something u do not like rather than stick to fact
@NYPD47Pct Just a guppy in the ocean, MUCH MORE TO BE DONE! Good work, great job keep it up!
@JedediahBila Thank u 4this. The conversation on this is only 1sided millions of people can no longer afford the shrinking market that TAX  4not having it
RT @JedediahBila: That means I can oppose both Obamacare &amp; a bad GOP alternative bill that overregulates you.That's ideological consistency…
@Education4Libs On this He does, he should not have commented on this at all &amp; if so then articulated his opinion better. &amp; players owe an apology as well.
@srvonly1 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain finding a middle ground. The very essence of our govt. was designed purposefully for this reason.
@srvonly1 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain then we wonder why congress or senate cannot get anything done. This is not the Westside Story Jets vs Sharks it is about right wrong &amp;
@srvonly1 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain So because she is not all the way to the right or not on the right on every issue she is not a conservative? This is the problem &amp;
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain u don't know that first of all. Also on some fronts bashing of Pres.Trump is warranted The man is not a saint She's not responsible 4her dad
@darylparks  So offending may not be the point that they are trying to make BUT IT IS A POINT BROUGHT FORTH NONE THE LESS.
@darylparks which is to bring attention. So many knew that it would offend.
@darylparks HE VERY ACT OF KNEELING AT THE FLAG WAS TO POINT BECAUSE IT WOULD GET ATTENTION. Many that do so did so in protest
@darylparks Watching you &amp; your explanation that it is not about the flag but in part it has become that because T
@FoxNews @NFL Lets get beyond the kneeling, marching &amp; bring about a change on both sides.
@FoxNews @NFL Many politicians that are in power to bring about change take to this like the latest trend but do not nothing.
@FoxNews @NFL It is nice to kneel it is nice to march but what is being done beyond that, IF nothing, then this is nothing more the rhetoric.
@FoxNews @NFL Okay I have no problem with this in front of city hall. But can we get passed the symbolism &amp; actually bring forth change.
@Education4Libs I thought they already did in there rule book?
@HARRISFAULKNER Congratulations! Looking forward to it. Wished they would give it another name brand. So individually apart from Outnumbered you can shine!
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain THAT IS THE POINT. TAKE THE EMOTION OUT OF IT, &amp; UNDERSTAND.
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain a particular job decision before you make it&amp;once you have no matter the outcome you don't expect them to speak up or answer for what you do
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Yes but the point is she is not to answer for her dad. I am sure you do not call your significant other or family or friends to consult on
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain I was disappointed in him as well &amp; I wrote him on twitter &amp; statement my case. You can do the same but she is not responsible for that.
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain She is not there consulting her dad on policy or which way to vote or controlling his decisions. You are mad at him understandably so,
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain No it is not but even if he did you are not responsible for what your dad do or do not do. THAT IS THE POINT.
@lyvinh60 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain What does he dad have to do with it?
@lyvinh60 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain You assume she switched how do you know if she switched or got released or fired. She has bills to pay like anyone else.
@TimKehayias @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain @TheView I cannot really watch because they make little to no sense to me but I wish her the best.
@marmwilliams @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain point that she may or may not make on the show or tweet about an issue that have at it but should not get personal.
@marmwilliams @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain defend him. He has a twitter account you have a beef w/ him tweet him or even call his office or write. If you differ w/her
@marmwilliams @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain he does not consult w/her on the decisions he should make nor does she do the same w/him. Why should she be held to explain his decision or
@marmwilliams @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain What does her taking a job has to do w/ her dad?  Her dad goes to work &amp; I don't know but will go out on a limb here &amp; say
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain nor are you responsible for or obligated to answer for his work.
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Also what her dad does at work SHE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR! I doubt you can tell your dad what &amp; how to do his job
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Do you know her mom or siblings &amp; there political views. Why do people get so personal about someone they do not personally know? SMH!
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Further more she is going there to give a conservative point of view. Also to you lump her he whole family in together,
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain democratic companies does not make them any less conservative just makes them an employee.
@kmh1268 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain LOL, u attack her because she took a job on a liberal program on a liberal network Many everyday conservatives work for liberal or
@CourtnayTrent @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain have liberals on to give that point of view. Not just on FNC but many other stations.
@CourtnayTrent @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain She is taking a job, you nor I are paying her bills. Further more she is hired to give a conservative point of view much like ON FNC
@srvonly1 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Wonder if your child or family should be subjected criticism for what you do at work
@srvonly1 @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain U R out of line she is not responsible for what her dad does at work nor has to explain.
@info_pit @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain So far left on that program it is in the same box as MSNBC rarely ever making sense. All the best wishes.
@JoeLiebsch @BretBaier @MeghanMcCain Unfair she does not nor should be expected to answer for her dad. DO you answer or explain your dads action at work?
@BretBaier @MeghanMcCain When did she leave, I knew she wasn't there but I thought that was bcuz she was spending time w/her dad. It has been about a just over mnth

@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi when it comes to receiving a tax break.
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi even better yet DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY THEIR OWN GOVT.
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi And for it they're not AMERICANS, they are excluded or exempt or
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi poor middle class &amp; worked hard, sacrificed to get where they are today

@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelos YOU WANT TO PUNISH THEM FOR DOING WELL! Backwards! ASS BACKWARDS! SMH!
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelos &amp;want them to do well then soon as they become rich U NO LONG R4 THEM,
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelos U CHAMPION THE POOR&amp;MIDDLE CLASS. Well if u champion poor&amp;middle class
@Education4Libs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi See you are a flawed, you do not want a tax break for rich or wealthy,
@Vltreece @FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino @HeatherChilders @JulieBanderas VERY TRUE!
@Vltreece @FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino Good Hope @HeatherChilders coanchor w/him she deserves i, put her time in @ 5am&amp;fills in where ever needed. @JulieBanderas is a good as well
@Richardafowler you cannot tell the other side that it is not about the flag. The FLAG automatically becomes part of it.
@Richardafowler this for one but the kneeling WAY BACK w/CK not right either in my opinion &amp; when it is done
@Richardafowler Richard How is it not about the flag when you kneel for it. I'm well aware of it all. THe Pres. should have stayed out of
@GiannoCaldwell Also any substantive change that last through time starts granularly, grass roots, Bcuz then u have built a foundation that many understand.
@GiannoCaldwell I wonder how many of these player not casting aspersions, know who their representatives are on a local, state &amp; national level.
@GiannoCaldwell That &amp;a host of other things they can do. I do not object to them protesting, I do not agree with the form of protest.
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino I just wonder what will happen to Jon Scott now?
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino named it something else I feel Outnumberd Overtime is OVER KILL. I am sure she will do a phenomenal job.
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino Sandra would do just as fabulous of a job. And Congrats to Harris I am so happy to see her have an hour of her own though they should of
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino Congrats also to Sandra on co anchoring w/ @BillHemmer another great spot though I had @HeatherChilders for this one
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino Dana would do equally as well she is very balanced &amp; objective &amp;has the right personality for the job.
@FoxNewsInsider @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER @DanaPerino Congrats Dana, did not see this one coming or had her on my radar for this slot. I was pushing for SSmith but feel
@TuckerCarlson  that is not just along racial lines  but I would say more so economic lines.
@TuckerCarlson Also the comment on 2 Americas well there is a case for that in the sense of experiences that one goes through &amp;
@TuckerCarlson or live in a certain zip code does not make you immune to racism. AND ON EITHER SIDE!
@TuckerCarlson Not painting all law enforcement with the same brush but YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT just because you acquire certain status
@TuckerCarlson because you have $2000 suit &amp; $1000 cufflinks &amp; drive a six figure car THAT MAY MAKE YOU MORE OF A TARGET BY SOME.
@TuckerCarlson Now on this you are wrong, What the gentleman is speaking of is real RICH or not $1000 cufflinks or not. As a matter of fact
