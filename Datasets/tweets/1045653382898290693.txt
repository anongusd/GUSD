The 3rd movie in the saga. Vindicates the hero. Proves them right and justice finds the villain. Remember, we are in the sequel. It began when Patriots Fight changed format. The gavel instead of the cannon, the place holders instead of the drops. I believe that change.
The sequel usually leaves the hero bruised and broken. The loser of the major battle, his allies scattered, sent licking their wounds. The audience is left conflicted, speculating on the hero's next more. They are blown away by how the villain was able to overcome and win.
Movie 2, where we are now. The sequel where major plot lines are beginning to reach their apex, the hero is met with their most challenging tests. At moments, it feels like the good guys are losing and have no hope of finding justice.
[From drop 1928] Q uses movies to explain. Movie 1 was everything from the beginning. It explained the plot, backstories, and details necessary to understand. All of the subplots were started and the characters established. Foreshadowing of what was to come was eluded to.
