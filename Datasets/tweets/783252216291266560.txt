@drj21h Yes, the media would go crazy I agree. The sexism in political reporting is well known. However, Bernie's behavior and the media's Sexist slant still does not excuse her behavior towards her staff.
RT @notcapnamerica: .@KamalaHarris: “You must start the marriages immediately.” 🏳️‍🌈 https://t.co/lym9FQzJB4
@drj21h And I hope those stories come out too. And the ones about Biden, I hope it all comes to light. I will not be supporting anyone who behaves like that in the primaries. That's just me.
@drj21h Of course there are stories out there of male Politicians like Clinton, Biden, Bernie being verbally abusive to staff  and I hope those stories come out too during the primaries but that does not excuse Klobuchar's behavior.
@drj21h Because this story is about Klobuchar and I acknowledged that women are scutinized harshly. I will never condone that behavior from anyone.
@drj21h And I say we should care about all their tempers. That's my point. I have in NO way suggested that the tempers and professional behaviors of the male candidates shouldn't be looked at, they all should. Everyone.
@drj21h Omg!!! She threw it in their direction.

@Imavirtue Thanks for speaking up, your courage and your bravery is inspiring.
@Imavirtue Many gay men are serious misogynists who feel entitled to women's bodies. They constantly invade women's spaces&amp;bodies because there is that misguided notion that as long as they're not sexually attracted to women, inappropriately touching them is not sexual assault/harassment.

@michaeldweiss I think the issue at hand is that this is far from what they initially said the meeting was abt. Now we've gone from adoptions to donations.
@rubbberseoul Your attempt to intentionally distort and twist her words is dishonest.
@rubbberseoul You have a strong understanding of female infanticide of little baby girls in the U.S? Okay.
@rubbberseoul Society looks at you and decides to ascribe certain things to you or not.
@rubbberseoul That is what being privileged is. Privilege does not care how you personally feel or identify internally.
@rubbberseoul Nobody ask those babies if they identify with the reproductive organ they're born with.
@rubbberseoul In many countries, children with vaginas btwn their legs are killed at birth simply because of they have the "wrong" organ down there.
@rubbberseoul In many countries in the world, a child is born and certain values are ascribed or not to that child based on what is between their legs.
@rubbberseoul Where did she say she had an understanding of the experiences of trans women? You keep trying to twist her words.
@rubbberseoul She NEVER said trans women are not women.
@rubbberseoul I strongly support Chimamanda and I have never been more proud of her than I am right now. She refused to be silenced and spoke her truth.
@rubbberseoul You need to conflate the gender experiences of trans and cis women into EXACTLY one is disingenuous.
@rubbberseoul Yeah right. Saying Trans and Cis women have experienced gender differently is NOT transphobic.

@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia You're welcome.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia It is a dishonest way of dealing with the issues and having real conversations. It is a form of wishful thinking.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia Insisting that trans and cis women experience gender in EXACTLY the same ways is equivalent to a person claiming to be "color blind".
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia I hope for a world where we see difference as ordinary because that is the very essence of life and the only constant in this world.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia We don't need to be dishonest to show our support for trans individuals. Difference is NOT division, it is simply normal.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia It is dishonest to conflate both experiences into one and claim that they're EXACTLY alike when in fact they're not. They don't need to be.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia She never said one experience is more valuable or important than the other. Her point was that there should be no need to conflate both.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia In fact the words/descriptors "cis" and "trans" already indicate that.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia Saying trans and cis women have experienced gender differently is definitely NOT transphobic because it actually is the truth.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia I call it faux outrage. A well calculated plan to silence her voice because she refused to trivialize the experiences of cis women.
@ElliotMurphy91 @AnndraADunn @novaramedia No she is NOT. Don't let the social media outrage machine dictate what your opinions should be. I strongly support Chimamanda.

@Sisonkemsimang I have disagreed with Adichie on a few things but on this issue I strongly support her because I think she was grossly misunderstood.
@Sisonkemsimang Were all the people who came out in support of her, particularly women, were they also conservative about trans issues?
@Sisonkemsimang Does being a progressive mean you never get to talk about differences ever again?
@Sisonkemsimang But if she is conservative because she says there are differences in lived experiences of cis &amp; trans women, what does progressive look like
@Sisonkemsimang Fair point on a healthy disagreement.
@Sisonkemsimang I do agree with most of the points you made on the piece and I commend your in-depth look at this "stanning" culture and it's pitfalls.
@Sisonkemsimang Adichie is a firm believer in "feminisms" so you don't have to agree with her style at all, but it's not good to misrepresent it either.
@Sisonkemsimang Ok, so now it's very accessible but very narrowly defines concept of power?
@Sisonkemsimang How about common sense makes us continue to support &amp; admire her in the face of an organized attempt to label her &amp; silence her voice?
@Sisonkemsimang According to you 		"Similarly, there is a politics that propels those who continue to admire Adichie even in the face of her transphobia."
@Sisonkemsimang She never claimed to speak for trans women and she never positioned herself as an authority on trans issues.
@Sisonkemsimang So that lady is "conservative" in her approach to feminism?
@Sisonkemsimang The lady whose brand of feminism is to bring in as many people as possible to make it a big raucous club whose ultimate goal is redundancy.
@Sisonkemsimang So the lady that said "We should all be feminists" (men included) suddenly wakes up 5 years later to exclude trans individuals?
@Sisonkemsimang A great piece until you suggested her feminism is more "conservative" than we assumed. This is literally the exact opposite of her work.

@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog Avoid stirring up controversies and just spout off our favorite phrases, make everyone happy and satisfied.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog You're saying if only Adichie would just say trans women are women then everyone would be better off. That is a groupthink mentality.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog Talking about the difference in the lived experiences of girls and women is not transphobic or Terfism.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog Because she did not use your favorite buzzwords and answer exactly the way you want her to, she should be crucified and shamed.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog The kind of feminism that tells a black Nigerian woman to "shut up" is one whose intents are questionable.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog This faux outrage will be the complete undoing of free speech and dialogue. She was asked a leading question and answered truthfully.
@msirois74 @HuffPostBlog Another hit piece where a woman tells another woman to "shut up and listen."
@ianyrbarelyaliv She was asked a leading question and she answered honestly. She may not said exactly what you want her to say but she answered truthfully.
@ianyrbarelyaliv But that was the question posed to her by the interviewer? The interviwer brought up Trans women not Chimamanda,
@ianyrbarelyaliv She was saying, it's disingenuous to conflate the different experiences of women into one thing and then insist that we all do the same.
@ianyrbarelyaliv Listening to that interview, I simply cannot see how she was excluding trans women.
@ianyrbarelyaliv So the lady that said "We should all be feminists" suddenly comes back years later to exclude trans women from feminism?
@ianyrbarelyaliv I find it interesting that people calling for intersectionality in feminism are very reluctant to embrace differences in experiences.
@ianyrbarelyaliv Difference is NOT division. There is strength in diverse stories and experiences.
@ianyrbarelyaliv It is not a means of "othering" trans women by pointingo ut differences in experiences.
@ianyrbarelyaliv I never said it gets her a pass and I don't see anything problematic in admitting differences between the lived experiences of women.
@ianyrbarelyaliv Yes, your anger is real and genuine but incorrectly misdirected at a woman who has been an ally of the LGBT community. That's my position.
@ianyrbarelyaliv She said trans women are trans women and have different experiences from cis women.
@ianyrbarelyaliv Please show me where she said Trans women are not women. You take her words, twist it around and then generate fake outrage.
@shanakn @8RosarioSanchez No, she said "when people talk about are trans women women, my feeling is trans women are trans women."
@8RosarioSanchez @glosswitch Yeah you're right, I worried about that too.
@sapphixy @MissEllieMae That's what the general opinion of the piece is. The Left keeps getting bugged down with playing word games.
@sapphixy @MissEllieMae It's okay to create terms for your experiences, but forcing others to using those exact terms is ridiculous.
@sapphixy @MissEllieMae So you're angry at being ignored and your only rxn to that is to label a black woman with terrible names right?
@sapphixy @MissEllieMae And yes, Adichie has nothing to apologise for, I have never been more proud of her than I am at this moment.
@sapphixy @guardian @MissEllieMae Because any opinion that varies from yours is considered "trash" right?
@SlayZeKyriarchy Call-outs and criticisms are only meaningful if they're valid and not completely misplaced like it was here.
@ChristinaSFLaw When the old ladies come to mutilate a young girl's clitoris, they son't ask her how she identifies or how she feels.
@ChristinaSFLaw In many cultures, a child is born, privilege is accorded strictly based on what organ is between that child's legs.
@ChristinaSFLaw Privilege does not take into consideration how you feel, identify or whether or not you want it.
@ChristinaSFLaw Yes the male privilege argument. Privilege is accorded to you based on how SOCIETY perceives you.
@ChristinaSFLaw Trans women do not understand what cis women go through when growing up. Can I make that argument also?
@ChristinaSFLaw And I agree that cis women have no clue what trans women go through but can we reverse that?
@ChristinaSFLaw Saying someone had a different experience does mean a less valid or a less important experience
@ChristinaSFLaw I am still waiting for you to give me the specific quote where she said they are "unequal" or of less importance.
@ChristinaSFLaw Show me where she talked about the experiences of Trans women. Please do.
@ChristinaSFLaw Trans women should speak on trans issues and cis women on cis issues because they have different experiences?
@ChristinaSFLaw Ok, so she doesn't get to talk about trans issues which means she has a different experience. You're making her point.
@ChristinaSFLaw You demand unquestioned solidarity, anyone not using your favorite buzzwords are quickly labelled.
@ChristinaSFLaw Now you're using emotional blackmail? Chimamanda is responsible for the murdered trans women?
@ChristinaSFLaw Of course, more name calling. Saying there is a difference in lived experiences is not transphobia.
@ChristinaSFLaw @AdviceToWriters @Lin_Manuel Yes, Chimamanda is a bigot and a transphobe for pointing out facts. 🙄

@rising @mathewrodriguez @ianxcarlos Please point to out exactly where and when she diminished the experiences of trans women. I'll wait.
@mathewrodriguez @mic I have never been more proud of Chimamanda. She has refused to play your silly word games.
@ztsamudzi There is room for a multiplicity of stories in feminism but there should also be room to discuss the differences in experiences.
@ztsamudzi Chimamanda is not THAT woman, she will not sit by and let you trivialize the stories and experiences of young girls and women.
@ztsamudzi They have been made to silence themselves and flatten their experiences so as not to upset the social media outrage machine.
@ztsamudzi Your all or nothing approach have left many women afraid to speak their minds for fear of being labelled TERFS or transphobic
@ztsamudzi You don't have to agree or believe in privilege to benefit from privilege.
@ztsamudzi And she understands that privilege doesn't ask anyone if they want it, so it doesn't matter how you "feel" about it.
@ztsamudzi Chimamanda will not play your word games because she sees right through it.
@ztsamudzi The same people who tell poor white people that they are still privileged are now trying to distort how male privilege works.
@ztsamudzi The so called "woke" feminists have zero idea about what privilege entails but are quick to tell others to "check your privilege"
@ztsamudzi Solidarity must be rooted in reality and your need to conflate the differences in the lived experiences of women is disingenous.
@ztsamudzi She is not here to spout off your favorite buzzwords just to satiate your senseless need to be politically correct.
@ztsamudzi The kind of feminism that tell a woman to "shut up and listen" is the kind of feminism whose intents are highly questionable.
@ztsamudzi  I have never been more proud and inspired by her than I am right now.
@ztsamudzi Thank God for Chimamanda, she has nothing to apologize for and she is not here for you faux and ridiculous outrage.
@ForHarriet And more importantly, this concerns women and their lived experiences. Telling one side does not encapsulate the entirety of it.
@ForHarriet My suggesting a cis-gendered perspective is because many cis women have come out strongly in support of what Chimamanda said.
@ForHarriet And many people seem to have concluded that Chimamanda was elevating one experience over the other. She clearly wasn't
@ForHarriet I would definitely want to hear their perspective on things. It's not about elevating one voice over another
@ForHarriet ok fair point, but what about a piece by a defender of Chimamanda's comment? Preferably by a cis-woman?
@ForHarriet In fact, being unable to see your privilege is a hallmark sign of being privileged itself.
@ForHarriet Privilege doesn't take into account our feelings and circumstances. Privilege doesn't ask you anyone if they want it or not.
@ForHarriet Pointing out differences in lived experiences should never be interpreted as advocating hate or violence.
@ForHarriet My main bone of contention is that Chimamanda's general point was quickly labeled "transphobic" and "trans misogynistic"
@ForHarriet Reading the piece is a way of listening to trans people. It was written by a trans person.
@ForHarriet No, I am not trans
@ForHarriet It alludes to the notion that Chimamanda proclaimed herself an authority on trans experience which is clearly did not
@ForHarriet And I respect that, their voices need to be heard. But the piece is almost entirely one sided and honestly very flawed.
@ForHarriet And for the record, Chimamanda was not speaking for trans women.
@ForHarriet Yes I agree with that, but speaking FOR a group and having an opinion about a question posed are different things.
@freeradicalfem I have never been more proud of her than I am at this moment. She will not be silenced. Just amazing all around.
@ForHarriet The kind of feminism that actively seeks to silence a woman's voice is one whose intents are very questionable.
@ForHarriet Because she has refused to use your specific buzzwords, she must be brought to heel. But yeah...you're the real feminists.
@ForHarriet Solidarity must be rooted in honesty and reality. There must always be a room for sincere dialogues and debates.
@ForHarriet Stop trying to erase the stories of black girls and womenall over the world all in the name of blind solidarity.
@ForHarriet The so called "woke" feminists cannot listen to an interview and apply adequate critical thinking and proper context.
@ForHarriet Your hit pieces on Chimamanda will amount to nothing. She owes no one an apology and she will not be silenced.
@ForHarriet Devoted to "celebrating" the fullness of black womanhood except that of a black Nigerian woman
@APootler @JeanHatchet My thoughts exactly, she should hold firm and refuse to be silenced by the ridiculous social media outrage machine.
@lisasevern Only a senseless person will listen to that interview and think she is advocating for the subjugation of trans women.
@lisasevern What does she need to apologize for? For stating the obvious? Or for not using the exact words you want her to use?
@lisasevern I have never been more proud of her as a Nigerian. She has absolutely NOTHING to apologize for.

@steveschale I just watched you Rachel Maddow, great segment. Thank you!!!
@MariaTCardona @Bakari_Sellers You guys are the ONLY reason why I still tune into CNN anymore. Great job again tonight.
@JamilSmith Why do you think she waited till this late in the election to bring up the Central Park Five?
@mattmfm @mikememoli Thank you guys for staying above the lies many in the media have chosen to peddle. Very much appreciated.
Such a hypocrite. https://t.co/sSLyMsRTZm
@Bencjacobs I just realized that you were the reporter that interviewed Trump's ex-chair in Ohio. Your side eye is one for the history books
@TheLeadCNN Oh yes... EMAILS!! https://t.co/TWmJaQpeYU
@MattGertz Well said, there is enough blame and finger pointing to go around. Everyone dropped the ball last week Friday.
@jamisonfoser I live for your threads, thanks again.
@jamisonfoser https://t.co/9Ur114wxnc
@jamisonfoser Nothing more left to be said.
@katiepack Also, have you met Melania? Remember what she herself said about the bullying of @juliaioffe. She should look in the mirror first
@Khanoisseur @senorawesomeguy @jodotcom Not surprised, no one in the family have novel and genuinue ideas of their own.
@nickconfessore How come everyone seems to be focused mainly on evoking some form empathy for mostly Trump supporters ?
@chelseaperetti @owillis Lol!!
@LeahBonnema @JoshMankiewicz Seriously my BP went through the roof after I started checking 538's forecast. Don't know if I'll make it to next Tuesday
@DNAtv @DrJasonJohnson Oh yes, who can forget the clock counting the days since HRC gave a presser or the relentless drumbeat of criticism she faced.
@RonanFarrow Thanks for bringing more attention to the continued disenfranchisement of the electorate.
Peeping Toms will have a free reign #ImagineTrumpsAmerica
@nickconfessore @brianbeutler I was so disappointed that David French described people's concerns about voter suppression as just "hysterics".
@MattGertz @mmfa I have never been fooled by Megyn Kelly. Anyone who invites Mark Fuhrman onto her show is never to be taken serious.
Contractors continuously stiffed and ripped off #ImagineTrumpsAmerica
LGBT community shoved back in the closet and marriage equality repealed #ImagineTrumpsAmerica

Political rivals and opponents jailed  #ImagineTrumpsAmerica
Women thrown in jail for making their own choice.  #ImagineTrumpsAmerica
@Bakari_Sellers I can't stand the low AA turnout narrative especially when u consider the tireless effort by the GOP to suppress people's ability to  vote
@JamilSmith @DavidAFrench  I can't believe he would brush aside legitimate concerns about exercising one's rights to vote as "hysterics"
@peterdaou @JuddLegum Because the story makes no sense. In a two person race, if you "disrupt" one side you're helping the other, simple.
@JuddLegum it make absolutely no sense especially since this is a two person race. Just stunning that this is coming from the FBI
@EricBoehlert Very well said, completely illogical. If you upend one party, you indirectly help the other one.
@TheFix Just because you are terrible at your "job" doesn't mean others are. You should pay attention, you might actually learn a few things
@neeratanden Off course, it only had to be that HRC asked these investigative reporters to push  these stories. Just terrible from Cilizza
@NormOrnstein @kurteichenwald @FranklinFoer Exactly, nothing on CNN right now about any of the Trump-Russia stories out there tonight.
@armandodkos A lot of Trump news dropping tonight but Anderson Cooper and CNN is doing a profile on Huma Abedin.
@armandodkos @andersoncooper Yes, just terrible. complete disservice to the electorate who deserve much more than such misinformation
@juliaioffe Crazy stuff really, no wonder he was singing Putin's praises just yesterday
@AdamPlatt1999 @juliaioffe Not surprised, it's not about anyone named Clinton so why bother reporting about it.
@jonfavs @Slate Now lets see if "bombshell" is used to broadcast this news like it was inappropriately used last Friday

@MariaTCardona Exactly, the media frenzy for this nonstory is crazy. The FBI does not know what's in the emails yet people are calling it a bombshell?
@JoeNBC @jmeacham @dcexaminer Bill Clinton is NOT on the ballot.
@armandodkos Not surprised at all, watch for Joe S. to spread more lies about the emails "scandal" tomorrow morning.

@danpfeiffer So what happened to their voter suppression strategy that was reported last week? That's not working?
@michaelbd Agreed. Which is why the media frenzy over the story was reckless and a disservice to the electorate.
@Hillary4TheWin You are definitely right, there have been no leaks from them this weekend at all.
@christinawilkie Haven't you learned anything by now? It's only a "scandal" if a Clinton is involved otherwise it's all good.
@Toure Just a bizarre and terrible decision on his part.
@DemFromCT Expect the crew on @Morning_Joe to milk this supposed HRC "scandal" for all it's worth tomorrow morning.
@GStephanopoulos @timkaine @ThisWeekABC it's NOT a bombshell 🙄🙄
@ReignOfApril Wow, they're not even hiding in the shadows anymore.
@NateSilver538 "tightening"
@steveschale What is going on with all these pollsters moving states to tossups? RCP did the same to PA today. I am already anxious as it is
@BraddJaffy Is this why Real Clear made PA a tossup?
@JeffersonObama "tightening", "tied", "dead heat" and "neck and neck".

@Nate_Cohn I guess his "black outreach" didn't work. Thankfully, they see right through his lies.
@JamilSmith @nytimes Poetic justice that NC will likely be the death knell for him despite the blatant voter suppression from the GOP
@Nate_Cohn @nytimes Somebody please let the folks at @Morning_Joe know this, I hear they're still holding out for a miracle over there.
@Chris_arnade Thank you so much, awesome read.
@ThePlumLineGS @NBCNews  This is consistent with the CNN poll released yesterday
@DemFromCT @TheFix I absolutely agree with you, he should have corrected and called him out on his lies.
@DemFromCT @TheFix I absolutely agree he should have corrected them.
@Hillary4TheWin Haha good for you.
@DemFromCT @TheFix In all fairness, Joe and Mika rarely let their guests interrupt or challenge them, terrible for viewers being lied to.
@Hillary4TheWin Please please please stop watching that ridiculous and awful propaganda of a show it's all filled with lies and misinformatn
@DemFromCT @Morning_Joe they have always being in the tank for him, lying and deceiving their viewers to further agenda
@MariaTCardona Just tuned in to watch you on CNN and as usual I wasn't disappointed. Thanks for sticking up for immigrants again, much love.
@sparksjls @bi_politics If there are gods and goddesses out there, please make this happen.
@pourmecoffee You win the Internet tonight, lol.
@nickconfessore if this was about HRC all the media would need would be just the "optics".
@Hillary4TheWin Don't hold your breath for the MSM to pick this up, they don't wanna be labeled as being liberally biased and unfair.
@Acosta so sad you had to go through that just doing your job. Stay strong and safe.

@Hillary4TheWin  Please, don't get me started on Morning Joe right now, lol. They are national disgrace.
@Hillary4TheWin Yeah, and Tapper retweeting it does a huge disservice to the American public and the electorate.
@jaketapper Watch for The Lead and Morning Joe to jump on this LIE tomorrow and talk about the "optics" not looking good for HRC.
@Hillary4TheWin Thank you, I don't see what any of this has to do with HRC at all, they're really scrapping the bottom of the barrel here.
@KeithOlbermann Just imagine a supposed reputable news anchor like Tapper retweeting a bogus clickbait, such a disservice to the public.
@jaketapper  Retweeting this bogus clickbait without doing due diligence &amp; providing proper context should qualify as malpractice. Shameful
@jaketapper Always looking for a "scandal" in the wrong places. A democratic governor donated to the campaign of another democrat #Tryagain
@JessesLaw Me too, lol. I enjoyed it beyond words and hopefully this election will be the same with some of Trump's surrogates.
@EricBoehlert Yeah a real bummer there, I still go on youtube to watch Karl with his little white board trying to figure it out that night.
@ryanstruyk @ABC Oh no, so his "black outreach" is not working?

@Timodc This is the same Scottie that chastised Ana Navarro for using the P-word on air but was not offended when Trump said it.
@mattmfm Such a nice clean sweep.
@ddale8 You're so awesome and one of the only good things to come from this election cycle. Thanks for your great work.
@JakeSherman Yes, I am watching. Joe invites guests over and pretty much interrupts them all the time.
@BillKristol Thanks for calling out the hosts on Morning Joe, they have tolerated and pandered to Trump all along.

@MariaTCardona thanks for calling out that ridiculous LIE by Scottie that most women didn't wake up horrified by the comments of the pervert
RT @Claryse2: @MariaTCardona @NewDay @CNN Every woman I know woke up horrified w/this man &amp; his comments. He is still too close to the pres…

@JoyAnnReid @angela_rye @neeratanden @hilaryr HRC should not be made to shake this disgusting man's hand tomorrow at the debate.
Wait what happened to @ananavarro?
I am here for @ananavarro tonight.
That last @CNN panel with @ananavarro and @TaraSetmayer was one for the ages. Thanks to both ladies for calling out lies and hypocrisy.
Any reporter, journalist or political analyst that calls that an apology is a complete hack. That is NO apology
RT @emmyrossum: The statements Trump makes in the leaked tapes are promoting sexual assault. 100%.
What if it's a video of him voluntarily stepping down?
RT @SimonMaloy: if GOP lawmakers want to argue this was the last straw, that's neat	 	they should also explain why they were cool with ever…
RT @elizabethforma: .@realdonaldtrump: Were you lying or was sexual assault part of your action every day? It’s a simple question. You shou…
Looks like @CNN and @MSNBC are rousing up all their political contributors and reporters. This is definitely a political bombshell.
RT @BraddJaffy: Jason Chaffetz dumps Trump https://t.co/U8XSZZ0D79
@peterdaou Yes, @Fahrenthold has single-handedly taken a wrecking ball to his campaign. Fantastic and unrivaled journalistic achievement.
@ShaunKing Yes, it's a complete disservice to her intelligence and experience that she has to be even mentioned in the same sentence as him.
This right here. https://t.co/zOzRfAJOmI
@jonathantasini Thank you!!. This is NOT "guy talk" or "locker room banter"
@jonathantasini is speaking real truth on CNN. We need more people like him on air, enough is enough with the lies, spinning and deflection.
RT @5thCircAppeals: "Strongly condemn" Trumpism is like "thoughts and prayers" for shooting victims. Meaningless if you don't actually do a…
RT @ddale8: This is a good day to note that Trump has been accused of sexual assault by a woman who has gone public: https://t.co/2ubUM7K5pp
@Toure How about they add a Nobel Peace Prize to that, for potentially torpedoing the campaign of a potential tyrant &amp; ensuring world peace.
More revelations. https://t.co/rnr5Pifiuc
@AlexMorash It looks like the shoe has finally dropped and the bottom has fallen out from under his campaign.
@aedwardslevy You win the internet today!!
@megynkelly going for the false equivalence I see, obviously joking about sexual assault equates leaked speech transcripts and emails.
RT @stuartpstevens: Trump would be fired from any major company in America. Yet he's asking to be hired for biggest job in the world.
RT @MalcolmNance: Official Warning: #PodestaEmails are already proving to be riddled with obvious forgeries &amp; #blackpropaganda not even pro…

@DavidCornDC You're killing me tonight, lmao!!
@JoyAnnReid I thought I was the only that heard him say that. He is insinuating that Hillary may have joked about sexual assault? Lord!!!
@Deanofcomedy just ludicrous, another way to deflect and spin. HRC's emails have nothing to do with Trump's joking about sexual assault.
RT @HillaryClinton: The facts are clear: Trump refuses to admit he is wrong on the Central Park jogger case and continues to peddle yet ano…

@Acosta Someone tell him to stop.
@goldietaylor @thedailybeast This should be the headline across all the media spectrum.
Can we give @Fahrenthold the Nobel, Pulitzer, Oscars, emmys...and every other award under the sun for his HUGE scoops this election cycle?
I am waiting to see how Kelly Ann Conway spins this.
@Bakari_Sellers I am curious as to why you think HRC has yet to bring this up especially Trump's role in this gross miscarriage of justice.
@Bakari_Sellers Just horrible. But I am glad that finally, Trump's role in their story is being given the much needed attention it deserves.
@JohnJHarwood  I am curious to know why you think HRC has yet to bring up the central park five as it relates to Trump.

@ddale8 You're awesome, thanks for doing what you do. I greatly admire your determination in holding politicians accountable. Thank you!!

@EricBoehlert Sean Spicer was just on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and he failed to ask him about that Willie Horton style ad targeting Tim Kaine.

@peterdaou I am not watching the show anymore. The American public deserves better than such false narratives coming from #morningjoe.
The American public deserves better than the garbage being spewed on #morningjoe right now.
@i_am_mzleathers I will follow you lead too, not waking up to watch #morningjoe anymore. Despicable and shocking analysis this morning.
@JoyAnnReid You are my favorite reporter on TV right now and I am always so delighted to see you on. Keep up the good work.
#morningjoe is just awful this morning.
