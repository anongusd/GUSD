@unsolvedmoments It's almost April. What we need for you to do is cover the famous Sacco and Vanzetti trial of the 1920's. This trial is still mainly unsolved even after two men were put to death for a crime they didn't commit based solely on their political leanings.
@realDonaldTrump You're not compassionate enough to practice Wicca. Don't call this a "witch-hunt" when you persecute others for their religious beliefs. Had you been alive in the 1600's, you'd have been involved in the killing of hundreds of women and you know it.
