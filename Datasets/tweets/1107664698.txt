@ProudResister @AryaResists I am a 67 year old grey grandmother. I help my grandkids, I feed my mentally challenged neighbor and I feed 15 feral cats. I am the radical left!
@thehill Yeah, walls of wheat and soybeans as they all file bankruptcy together.
@Nightline While I think Joe is actuall the best person for the job, especially in light of trying to fix our country after trump, I am saddened to say I don’t think he should run. America needs new, younger, vibrant ideas and America is looking to vote like that.
@SafetyPinDaily Thomas May be a SC justice but he is a f..in moron.

@CuomoPrimeTime That’s rich coming from the thumb on,the Russian scale trump
@laintain @EdKrassen He has it wrong because NO ONE has the right to tell any woman when they should or shouldn’t have an abortion. Not at 20 weeks, 30 weeks, never. That decision should be between the woman and her doctor and them alone.
@sweetie911 @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Ha! Ha! Ha!
@ABC Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@LiberalResist He is pathetic!
@NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson Laughable....but we the people should start one now!!!
@EdKrassen You’ve got it wrong, guy!
@EdKrassen It is no mans or anyone’s else right to tell any woman anything, anytime about her health or her babies health. That is between her and her doctor...at 20 weeks, at 30 weeks or at any time.
@jacknorth @PrincessBravato He is that stupid.
@SaysHummingbird I think it is fantastic. All these other leaders and countries now know that the trump/pence show is a big farce and they will not play along any longer. They get it. Do the American people???
@RawStory Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@StopTrump2020 @realDonaldTrump HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace I stand with McCabe!
@RawStory Stone should be re arrested for threatening a sitting judge!!!
@peterdaou @LindseyGrahamSC Graham wouldn’t know the truth unless trump told it to him. He is a groveler.
@politico Laughable.
@Public_Citizen So sad for America.
@matthewamiller In other words....she was about to get caught and exposed and figured trump wasn’t worth it.
@mitchellreports @SecPompeo In other words, no praise at all.
@RawStory This guy trump is a riot.
@SafetyPinDaily Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@joncoopertweets So, who will these farmers be voting for now?
@Slate And trump does nothing. It’s despicable that his hate filled rhetoric may get people hurt. Hitler like.!!!
@renato_mariotti Rick Scott is a cheat and is morally bankrupt, just like trump.
@SafetyPinDaily He always does at his rallies.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Trump is a LIAR!!!
@thehill Huge LIAR!
@joysesq Huge LIAR!
@thehill WTF???
@AshaRangappa_ No it didn’t.
@bellegenerico_ I love trump.....everyone I know would know that I have been kidnapped and forced to say those ugly words.
@ndrew_lawrence So sad for America.
@adamcbest Trump is a HUGE LIAR!
@FranncescaRobi1 Wanna bet???? HA!
@siano2020 Or anybody else.
@thehill Why, trump should do that.
@thehill Bullshit!
@kylegriffin1 @RBReich And we regular folks get screwed again. Thanks trumpsters!
@JadedCreative @ListenToEzra Then why did you vote for trump. He is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@ABCPolitics I can’t even believe that you must advise trump and his admin. That separating families is wrong. It’s horrendous.
@nypost Trump is an idiot.
@CREWcrew It’s about time!
@thinkprogress Don’t believe you.
@johnpavlovitz @ItHasBegun2016 It is a cult....that’s why it’s so dangerous.
@daveweigel We can only hope!
@ACLU @DebbieDoesTwitt So sad.
@businessinsider Disgusting and sad for America.
@psychdr100 It was very obvious even before the leak.
@BrianKarem We all are part socialist...even trumpsters who use government services.
@RawStory You are a racist idiot!
@HuffPost What an idiot.
@Plywood85686792 @ABCPolitics Mind your own business and leave my body, my health care and my decisions to,me.
@ABCPolitics He is running scared. It’s hysterical.
@mmpadellan She is awesome.
@ABC He I graspin a straws.
@USATODAY God bless them.
@1IronMan2020 He is pathetic
@thehill Ha! Ha! Ha!
@sd21852 @WhiteHouse Fu1
@NBCNews @MeetThePress Not because of trump...in spite of him!
@StevenTDennis @MalcolmNance Sad!
@HuffPostPol Take a long look at that holocaust survivor. Trump thinks he is a dictator, just like Adolph Hitler....who thought only he and other whites could be the superior beings. Trump is so like hitler it is scary. We could all look like that survivor if trump goes unchecked.
@HuffPostPol Ha!ha!
@SethAbramson What a f...in idiot.
@ABCPolitics Here! Here!
@PhilipRucker Trump is trying to scare people into stopping investigating him.
@ABCPolitics Bad... women should make their own decisions about their own body. They are trying to scare you into thinking that a child almost ready to be born would be killed. It does not work like that and no doctor would do that. It is fear they are spreading.
@DavidCornDC He is full of #hit.
@CNNPolitics One... all democrats, please.
@FAIRImmigration Bullshit!
@MalcolmNance Yes it does.
@NewsHour Not because of trump.
@CREWcrew Sad and dangerous.
@mmpadellan Me too. He has denigrated every other US president by saying he alone was and is the answer. Disgusting.

@SafetyPinDaily No, no, no!
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber @repblumenauer Here! Here!
@JudicialWatch So funny!
@voxdotcom He hasn’t kept any promises except to his rich friends.
@politico That’s because if they openly put that on display people would laugh.
@business It didn’t work.
@WhiteHouse He is asking for it alright...and I hope he gets it.  From a liberal democrat!
@EndDeportations It sucks from my point of view.  A middle class American!
@renato_mariotti Graham has lost all integrity and decency. He is no longer the smartest guy in the room.  So sad for him and America.
@RealMuckmaker Please, let me stop laughing first, then I can talk!!!
@WhiteHouse Not my president!
@HuffPost It’s concerning for every American and the world.
@thehill You are ridiculous!
@TheDemCoalition Anyone who trusts trump is a fool. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@RawStory Crazy trumpsters.
@voxdotcom The wall is ridiculous and Not an emergency.
@CNNnewsroom So wrong and not an emergency.
@HuffPostPol So sad for America.
@CNN She is still the greatest of all time!
@guardian Not by choice I’m sure.
@RichardWRahn @WashTimes The 1% is destroying America. Middle and lower class work hard and need and want to get ahead.  Socialism is not the answer, But there must be a better way because you rich guys do not assist getting ahead. Except for yourself!
@TIME Trump does not unify...in any way, shape or form.
@mitchellreports Because doing nothing, watching fox, making calls that are not recorded or monitored is wrong for any president. We The People want to know all that he does. No hiding!
@PhilipRucker Sad.
@thehill He does not. His vanity wall IS NOT an emergency.
@siano2020 Trashed.
@thehill No he does not. That is not what emergency powers are for. His vanity wall project IS NOT an emergency.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Anything else.
@RawStory HA! HA! HA!
@joncoopertweets What a putz.
@RawStory Really, you believed this lying, cheating narcissistic moron?
@TheDemCoalition I love the sign.
@soledadobrien All you poor republicans. You are a trump cult if you all stand by him. It’s disgraceful. What happened to you all?
@Independent Lots of better to cope. Your family member probably agrees.
@Newsweek Ha! HA! HA!...........
@matthewjdowd Bernie is ridiculous and is only for himself.
@sahilkapur You don’t have a party. You all are a trump CULT. So sad for old real republicans. They had class.
@mcspocky That’s probably a good thing. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@Trumpet1984 Trump is a low in America and in the world.
@_allymaldonado God bless and peace to you.
@PolitiFact @ReportersLab @washingtonpost @factcheckdotorg How sad is it that we have to do that....with a president.
@KRNV I hope they are all Democrats.
@truthout @fightfor15 Love, love, love. A decent living wage (almost).
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber So sad for America. While some are working 2-3 jobs and sleeping only 3-4 hours a night. This clown is only working part time. But we are paying him and all those republicans full time dollars.
@B52Malmet First good news I’ve heard today.
@HuffPost As long as trump is still president I can’t be optimistic.
@thehill Ph, please. Don’t make me vomit!!!
@DeadlineWH @PhilipRucker @NicolleDWallace Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@RawStory YES! YES! YES!
@renato_mariotti Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! So pathetic that you and others believe that.

@stucam7771 @starincali A decent human....
@Slate Schultz is a billionaire schmuck. He thinks money will make him a better prez than trump.we need governmental experience, just like Nancy Pelosi. She knows the score and she has kept score for years.  Money does not equate to good presidential material.
@NYCMayor Good on you...and them.
@JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Who cares, unless he’s dying!!!

@cnni Giuliani is a major liar and dumb ass. Just don’t ever believe a word he ever says.
@Independent For gosh sales, Ms. May.  Just set up another vote. The majority don’t want to leave the EU. No politicizing, no politics, no for or against. Set up the vote and get it done.
@renato_mariotti @RudyGiuliani @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Ha! Ha!
@thinkprogress Trump is a moron.
@MotherJones So sad for America.
@NewsHour Very sad. Trump shouldn’t even be there. He probably wouldn’t have even rented to MLK. Sad for America.
@RawStory 2 minutes to long. Trump shouldn’t be there ar all.
@thehill Yes, mr. Giuliani. It’s called a soul...something you would not recognize.
@kylegriffin1 2 minutes to long.
@joncoopertweets I would.
@KamalaHarris @markos YES! YES! YES! From a Nevadan
@NBCPolitics Oh please, they are ridiculous. The only honor they have is to their white, evangelical, trumpsters. It’s a photo op!!! And a bad one at that.
@PNS_News Finally!
@B52Malmet Tell me where and when.
@business She should be in jail for fraud.
@mmfa Yeah sure, poor, poor trump.
@RawStory Actually they are not supposed to be loyal to trump. They are working for the American people and they did exactly what they were suppose to do. Protect the American people. It just so happens that trump is a Russian asset so the are protecting the USA from trump.
@HuffPost Word play. Worked for and profited from are 2 different things. Same outcome.
@CREWcrew Giuliani is laughable.
@ABC Working for Russia and profiting from Russia are 2 different things.
@PhilipRucker Such lies...
@maggieNYT I call BS!
@chipfranklin Russian money and many secrets.
@Acosta Worked for and PROFITED FROM are very different. Trump is a master at word play.
@NPR Worked for and Profited From are 2 very things.
@joncoopertweets @LindseyGrahamSC Interesting because I have read and heard that LC secret is out.
@washingtonpost It’s ridiculous on the face of it, but with trumps actions it very believable.
@NBCPolitics Who cares.
@CNN POS!
@thehill You are wrong.
@Newsweek He is a liar and is wrong.
@DrDenaGrayson Big difference being between ‘working for’ and PROFITED FROM.
@CNNPolitics You are wrong...again.
@ABC There is a huge difference from his words that say ‘I never worked for’ and I NEVER PROFITED FROM. Word play, but from trump it counts. He and his family and businesses have PROFITED FROM, in exchange for!!!
@NBCNightlyNews So sad I am weeping...for these workers, but also for America.
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump That’s to good a profile for him.
@RawStory Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@thehill You are a traitor.
@RawStory Not fast enough!
@ScarletAvengers Be still my beating heart....about damn time.
@NightlyPolitics @LindseyGrahamSC Russian money!

@thehill Disgraceful!
@jonathanvswan @tajhell So disgusting.
@Newsweek Graham has lost his marbles.
@MartinHeinrich I so sorry you and others must endure this. Blessings!
@politico What action...I don’t trust you.
@AdamParkhomenko Romney...you were ridiculous years ago and now you are sucking up again to trump who thinks you are pathetic now. And you are!
@realDonaldTrump You are pathetic.
@business Trump is always a LIAR&gt;
@HuffPost So silly on his part.

@WSJ @KarlRove ThatsBS.
@thehill Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@lister_lester Yes they can.

@activist360 @deck449 Really they have to discuss this....dahhhhh.
@thehill You are very wrong!
@altNOAA Bastard!
@robreiner Or are they in on it?
@B52Malmet They can eat it however they want. It was the gesture that counted.
@politico No what King said was racist. The really bad part was that his words are not a slip up, he really believes this crap.
@thedailybeast I call BS!
@CNNPolitics But he did not deny it!
@CREWcrew MAY HAVE????
@MissNyetTrump She should go to as I’m sure she lied to get her ‘Einstein visa’.
@AdamParkhomenko No, he’s been crazy since McCain passed away. I think after McCain died he decided to get in on the Russian gravy train and you have to suck on trump to do that. Just sayin...
@CNN You are wrong. I am a 67 year old silver haired grandma and I care very much.  This is my country, not trumps. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@HuffPost JUST DO IT!!!
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@SaysHummingbird You are taking Russian money to. What have you compromised besides your integrity? TREASON!
@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump He is a Russian agent. TREASON!
@RawStory Well ‘We the people’ don’t trust you anymore. You have sold out America for Russian money and you and trump should go to jail for treason:
@Franklin_Graham You are ridiculous. Separate church and state.
@SaysHummingbird FU. You are a Russian money lover and it will come out. You have sold out America. RECALL/IMPEACH you and trump.
@Shareblue He knows the goods.
@CREWcrew Emouluments clause.
@CBSNews But it’s coming....
@guttenberger7 Ha! Ha! Ha! You are so funny.
@WRosenbergTX @StormResist @realDonaldTrump As Michael Cohen will tell us all.

@business Buckle up America, the downturn is coming. It’s inevitable!!!

@GabbyGiffords @DemWrite @SpeakerPelosi @RepThompson Nevada has finally gotten a governor who will back the will of Nevadans and set up universal background checks.

@CREWcrew Astounding coincidence is kind.
@4everNeverTrump @GOP You are a disgrace to America.

@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats So glad someone in government cares. If you trumpsters don’t want to cash your IRSefund check. Please don’t!!!
@AdamParkhomenko Trump can’t, but he will try. It is up to all Americans to stop him!!!
@washingtonpost Get over it...women curse.

@RawStory She is pathetic!
@AJentleson @CA_Lady That’s to high.
@ABCWorldNews @sramosABC Lions just don’t attack. Someone left the door open and they were not ready and not practiced like they should have been. Yes a young women is dead but there is also a dead beautiful lion and someone should be held responsible...for both!
@michaelschweitz Oh my...what a cutie. And I mean the dog, not you.
@B52Malmet Disgraceful.
@thehill Good!

@joncoopertweets Trump as a landlord would not take maintenance in lieu of rent, I am sure. They are all blowing smoke to cover for trumps shutdown.
@CREWcrew Ridiculous.
@NancyPelosi Thank you Nancy!
@thehill Trump is nuts. What he says is nuts. This country needs much better.
@SafetyPinDaily Lindsey Graham use to be a solid normal Republican. Now he is a Russian ally who takes money from Russians and acts like a screwball Republican.
@SaysHummingbird Well they got right.
@RawStory So weird and disgusting.
@MotherJones So funny, like trump the landlord would actually take maintenance instead of real rent money.
@SafetyPinDaily Trump as a landlord would surely want maintenance from renters instead of cash rent payments...RIGHT? What a moron.
@KassandraSeven He is!!! And worse. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@ellievan65 They are too challenged to realize it.

@RawStory Of who?
@rollcall Trump is a big LIAR!!!
@RawStory Either one is fine...as long as he is GONE!

@ABCPolitics Just plain WRONG!
@ABC AND OUR GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING!!! It’s stunning.
@Nevada And trump is still a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@thehill How sad.  Government is supposed to help its citizens, not make things more difficult. It’s republicans!!!
@altNOAA That’s a great idea about boxing it out.
@nytimes Just keep it to yourself. No tattle tales.
@olgaNYC1211 @RandPaul You are such an a...hole!
@maggieNYT For he knows not what he is saying!
@ABCPolitics You are an idiot and have sold out.

@mitchellreports Are you kidding me?? Another dictator and pulling of the wool over trumps eyes and ears!
@Acosta Why, he does and everyone knows it.
@nytpolitics Roberts can handle it. He is a rock star.
@thehill It has taken them long enough. Do they all have enough money now?
@BillKristol When trump doesn’t get his way...he gets meaner. He thinks that is how powerful men act. He is wrong. It shows his weakness.

@HuffPost At other peoples expense. POS!
@RawStory That’s because he is an IDIOT!
@SaysHummingbird He is correct. Almost everyone does hate him. He is dangerous to our America.
@Sifill_LDF Again!
@MJGerson America is in danger.
@RawStory Actually, we dems and liberals do have a lot of sympathy for the shutdown people. I personally think that anyone who shuts it down without even caring about people are the 1%ers. Let them go without money for a while.
@naretevduorp I put up some money if they get included in shutdown. I want Mueller and his team on the job!!!
@funder And not get paid during the shutdown!!!
@Amy_Siskind @LindseyGrahamSC Russian money
@PhilipRucker Ha! Ha! Ha!
@kylegriffin1 He probably doesn’t. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@AltStateDpt Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@rickhasen @politico Give it a rest...just comply already.
@rollcall They take all their money and run....then they try and make us believe it’s for the good of the country.  That’s funny. If it was for the countries good they would not take the money and run.
@ABC So angry at this. The player is humiliated but for the good of the team allows his dreads to be chopped off. The player is a hero and the ref and others who didn’t challenge the ref are horrible for not sticking up for this kid.
@adamcbest Ha! HA! Ha! SUCKA!!!

@Yamiche Who cares???
@jimsciutto America is in trouble now without Mattis. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@NancyPelosi You tell the truth, Nancy.  Prayers and love for you and your family. Merry Christmas. Thank you for sticking up for us!!!
@krassenstein You go RBG! Prayers and love for your quick recovery. We need you!!!
@krassenstein These types of people are mentally ill and ignorant.  It is sad. They are pathetic. You keep up the good work!
@CREWcrew Keep it up, thank you!
@SafetyPinDaily I say to this man FU! You know nothing about real life, you are an elitist!
@B52Malmet @DemWrite Treason.
@ThisWeekABC It’s not unclear...Mexico has made it very clear that they will Not pay for it.
@mkraju That’s why you’ll never be re elected...that and other abominations.
@thehill That’s their problem...the rest of the country will do the right thing.
@B52Malmet Then trump should get out now, as it was all a setup.
@NBCNews @csiemaszko Good, most of the time they let it happen.

@votevets Redo.
@BostonGlobe Good, cause you are going to lose...and you know why.
@DHStokyo @JCTheResistance He lost his NEVADA seat to Jackie Rosen. Heller is an outright liar and a fraud. He should not be allowed back in government.  He was VOTED OUT!!!
@nytpolitics From bad to worse...trumps modus operandi.
@dandrezner @SamanthaJPower @HowardKurtz You mean he is alive?
@CBSNews You go girl!

@CBSEveningNews You speak the truth and you do it with style. Go, Nancy, Go!

@ABCPolitics Trump doesn’t know how to respect anything or anyone.
@KenDilanianNBC Isn’t that witness tampering.  Even I know roger stone was in the mueller mess.
@Dangchick1 Because they feel so bad about themselves and their lives that they want to “stick it to the man”. Meaning stick it to regular folks.   And they have.
@WSJ Ridiculous.
@NBCNews I am certain trump is fuming because the spotlight is not on him.
@maydaymindy9 Your opinion only.

@Reuters Point of view!
@NPR We get so little from trump and then praise him for it!
@SafetyPinDaily Why...does it effect their faith? That statement is ridiculous!
@WashTimes Smart man but tell him to watch it....transcribers have been known to change or drop words. It happened here in Nevada!
@SafetyPinDaily Does that make any sense? It just proves it is not really about life but only their point of view!
@EricHolder Poor losers and scortched earth tactics. They didn’t win so burn it all down.  Disgusting!
@PolitiFact @realDonaldTrump That figures!
@SafetyPinDaily So disgraceful!
@NYDailyNews WTF?
@TexasTribune @Fahrenthold @nytimes That figures! Friends of trump.
@ABC And then we here in USA have trump!!!
@thinkprogress And the Ukraine incident happened 1 week before and trump did and said zero. It’s all a ruse with trump. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@thehill And trump did nothing....and now we know why. They will continue to interfere until theUS actually does something!
@ItsJeffHudson Because you know those evangelical people are so perfect?  You do you!!!
@democracynow @johncarlosfrey LET THEM IN!!!
@ivenad4 Ryan was a disgrace to America! He did nothing to resist trump and helped make our deficit billions higher....just for corporations and the rich. Nothing to brag about.

@B52Malmet What will trump and Kelly do about this???
@PhilipRucker Since when di I believe ANYTHING coming out of this WH?
@ABCPolitics That’s rich coming from him!
@NBCNews And then people wonder why there is still racism. The nazis murdered millions and if we forget the Holocaust then we are destined to repeat those atrocities. These kids should be punished.
@thehill You are the criminal for sticking up for a man who committed treason! Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.
@nytpolitics @katierogers Trump can’t read!
@benwikler @JCTheResistance Scorched earth tactics. They didn’t win so they are burning the state down!
@ABCPolitics Disgraceful! Sure trumps Maga. Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@NPR And can someone please tell me...what will all of trumps children say about him after his passing?
@MsgToObserver @NRA NRA you are wrong. Taking a knee is very patriotic! Don’t try and make it about something else so you can sell guns!
@AynRandPaulRyan @frankzuber4 Trump is a narcissistic baby man who is dangerous to America.

@HuffPostPol It’s his charade.
@wesley_jordan @StormResist Absolutely disgusting! Remember his name.
@CBSNews All lies. We all know it. I am over 60 years old...and even I know it!
@NAACP Well then this circus must make you cringe.!
@danpfeiffer It’s not true in any high school or college!
@thehill Disgusting!
@HuffPost So if he believes that then does that mean that if he gets this nomination that he will get us back? Scary and not impartial!
@thehill @POTUS What a pile of BS.  How is he impartial if he is to be judge!
@politico What a fuc&amp;ing liar!
@people Which is so revolting to me.  Keep your prayers to yourself!
@NewsHour @JohnCornyn Except that this was not supposed to be a full on trial.  If it was there would have been a full blown investigation.
@voxdotcom And you created it by standing by trump!
@politico Vote Blue!!!
@DanRather @h3jp That’s the whole point!!!.they do not want anFBI https://t.co/Lp7MWwZax5 wrong. And until we get one Kavanaugh should NOT be on the bench!
@ALT_DOJ Of course you do.
@GMA Who told him to do that?
@politico But you refuse to ask for an FBI investigation or to take a polygraph
@SafetyPinDaily Sure it was
@thehill No, what we want is for him to not be a SC Justice!
@SteveSchmidtSES @ALT_DOJ Well if he doesn’t like the process then perhaps they shouldn’t have screwed Merrick Garland!
@CBSNews What about https://t.co/St4JxQxqPh? You have a lot to gain.  DrFord has nothing to gain!
@Reuters Keep your personal prayers to yourself. That’s part of why you’ll never get on the SC!
@Slate What the hell has gotten too Lindsey Graham?
@kylegriffin1 Lest he protest too much?
@CBSNews Who the hell does he think he is?
@NYDailyNews What about Dr. Ford?
@politico Please keep your personal prayers to yourself! This is part of the problem...separate church and state!
@SkyNews Gee that does not sound impartial to me.
@ABCWorldNews More than patronizing.  He knows doesn’t he that you should separate church and state?
@GMA This is so patronizing its disgusting!  Not to mention ...separate church and state, especially a sc judge should know that.
@BostonGlobe Is that for him to decide?
@latimes Separate church,your particular prayers and state.
@krassenstein Ridiculous!
@business Tuff shit! What about Dr. Ford. Ask yourself...who has the most to gain?  Ford 0...Kavanaugh. A Supreme Court sear for life!
@ABC @katiecouric What about hers?
@MotherJones He is screaming. His answers are consistenly the exact same, I love beer, this is a circus,etc. when you talk about drinking he stammers. Also please remember..what does she have to win/lose VS what does he have to win/lose? In my book...she was very believable. STOP KAVANAUGH.
@DrDenaGrayson Lest he protest too much...and loudly!
@NBCNightlyNews You patronage we women, mr. graham.
@thehill Threats now from republicans!
@HallieJackson That alone should make him unqualified to be a SC judge.  Church and state are to be separated according to the constitution.
@thedailybeast Who cares what he says?
@ABCPolitics Really, that’s how you see this? You are pathetic. An FBI investigation would answer a lot of your questions.
@CBSNews Gee a typical sexual abuse survivor.
@bpolitics Whoa...is he angry that he got caught?
@politico What about hers...and she didn’t even snivel as much.
