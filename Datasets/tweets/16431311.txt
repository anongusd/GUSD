One big component at stake is how much a forthcoming draft empowers the FTC to deal with data privacy. Any private input from ex-FTC commissioners could help inform how they approach the matter (caveat: the tech and telecom industry has since hired some of these individuals).
Senate Commerce lawmakers, notably, are in the middle of trying to finalize a bipartisan draft of data privacy legislation, which Chairman Wicker wants to move by the end of 2019. Committee members working on it keep saying they're close.

The latest on the partial government shutdown. The FCC, meanwhile, has enough cash on hand to keep running through Jan. 2 https://t.co/4ZWIUBdj90
A lot of groundwork had been laid to allow these FCC noms to move. Sen. Thune had been helping negotiate to successfully secure the lifting of multiple holds on Carr. If the nominees aren't confirmed in the next few days, President Trump will have to re-nominate them in 2019.
Although the government partially shut down Friday night, lawmakers skipped town for the first half of this week. The Senate isn’t expected to convene until 4 p.m. Thursday, and there’s widespread speculation that a shutdown could carry into 2019.
A Senate Democratic staffer confirmed to POLITICO last week that staffers were assembling a nominations package likely to include Starks and Carr. But that package became caught up in the CR debate and may not move until government funding is resolved.
The government shutdown fight racking Capitol Hill could blow up what was increasingly seeming like a likely Senate deal confirming FCC nominations for Brendan Carr and Geoffrey Starks, leaving the FCC down one commissioner for the foreseeable future
