Khan Sb. Please look upon the matter of Energy Crises. I think its fake now. And the old Establishment's Workers of the Institute torching the people.
Why the Load Shedding is still on???
Honorable Prime Minister. As you rush for the Change and will catch the Corrupt Mafia. Its Good. But along with this have a little look on these small issues which are not small, And start Campaign and Awareness Programs on Electronic Media. So that the People can learn. Thanks
A Common Person do not even know how to cross the road? People Spitting on Roads. Break the Traffic Signals. Even i seen daily in routine Police and Officials Break the Signals. This is Big GOOFINESS and Gunai Kabira according to the Fatwa of Late Amame Kabah Sharif.
What is the Pakistan's biggest Problem? Load Shedding? Corruption? Water Insufficiency? Pollution? Inflation. Energy Crises? Yeah Yeah of Course. BUT above all these problems I think the Biggest problem is GOOFINESS. First of all have to decrease the ratio of Goofiness.
Honorable Prime Minister. Requesting you that please start from the grass root level.

Prime Minister Should think Over it to make and implement such social education policies to bring change in People's Thoughts and Mental Approach.
Along with other Social and Governance Obstacles I think the Top most problem of Pakistan is JAHALAT Both Social &amp; Religious. Unless Literacy rate not increase through common Education, the people's Mental Approach not change. e.g. People Do Not even know how to cross the Road...

A comprehensive strategy for promoting the acceptance of results and preventing conflict would include a broad range of political and technical measures.
@am102358 @LavorattoT God Bless you. Success is yours Always.
Unnecessary Delay to take over the Charge. Why? PTI should hurry to settle down the things and take the stage.
What are the circumstances under which electoral contestants are more likely to win magnanimously or lose graciously? The present paper is an outcome of those discussions. It attempts to bring into chart methods that might increase public confidence.
How might one strengthen public confidence in an election 	  and increase the likelihood that its outcomes are accepted? In particular, 	  what features of political institutions and processes typically lead political 	  actors to accept electoral losses?
This is what all happens now in General Elections and PIT Won.
It is not enough to reform institutions; citizens need to be  convinced that changes are real and reserve their confidence.  Inclusiveness, transparency and accountability are all fundamental to  developing that confidence.”
In discussing electoral integrity, the Global Commission on Elections, 	  Democracy and Security noted that:  its root, electoral integrity is a political problem depends on public confidence in electoral and political processes.
“Elections are at the heart of democracy. When conducted with integrity, they allow citizens to have a voice in how and by whom they are governed.”
@Saad_Gondal @defencedotpk Nice Thought Mr. Saad. God Bless you
Thanks a lot Mam Komal
@Saeeda56900152 Yes he was.
All Looser of the Elections  are seems to be (KHSIANI BILLI KHAMBA NOCHAY),,, LOL. They must have to be treated by Supreme Court and they should stop violence. I request them to be patience and ethical now... God Bless.
@muneebshahid763 @defencedotpk Im always talk with logic im trying to be. That is why given you the reference of Baba e Quom. Imran Khan also wants to shape Pakistan the Pakistan of Quaid e Azam. If he will be trying to strict on his manifesto the old truths of the All Pakistan Movement are the logic stands.
Mr. Imran Khan is Legend of the World. Legendary Cricketer. The Achiever not looser. He is Master;s from Oxford University in Politics. What nonsense the ridiculous criticism on His Fascinate and Mesmerizing Personality.
Mr. Haroon ur Rashid the Elder Annalist always criticizing  PTI. He is from PMLN.???
@muneebshahid763 @defencedotpk Right. But it means we cut down the rules developed by the Our Great Founder. Since Our Mother Land came into being, none of the Government applied 14 points of Quaid e Azam. Anyways its not a debate between you and me brother. We must accept the reality. Love. God bless you
@muneebshahid763 @defencedotpk History needs to be write again.
@muneebshahid763 @defencedotpk When Pakistan came into being its Democratic Republic of Pakistan. Which Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah Settled down the name... Read the History my dear friend....
Appealing: Honorable Chief Justice Mr. Saqib Nisar. Take necessary action against the unethical and unnecessary criticism on General Elections... Please Stop the Looser Political Parties. Thank you
