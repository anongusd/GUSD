@baier_jason @FlyPartridge @KaitMarieox @AOC National Socialism is a right wing ideology. There is social right and economic right. National Socialism is far right socially and fairly right economically. It’s an ideology created to oppose communism but isn’t really socialist in any form.
@FlyPartridge @baier_jason @KaitMarieox @AOC I personally classify myself as a social democrat
@LeesaBaccellie1 @KaitMarieox @AOC I do say so because those are the facts.
@LeesaBaccellie1 @KaitMarieox @AOC There were jobs under Barack Obama. 2009 unemployment rate was 10%, 2017 it was 4.7%. Millions of jobs were created under him. Job growth has actually slowed under Trump. The economy didn’t make a magical turn around on Jan 20, 2017.
@MyGovtIsTOOBig @KaitMarieox @AOC Yeah actually I do understand that and no where did I say let’s just print money and spend it. If we actually made the rich pay their fair share we could afford this.
@LeesaBaccellie1 @KaitMarieox @AOC Research jobs, wind farms, solar farms, there are alternative methods that work and some that need research and development. We have to power the economy of tomorrow because fuel will not always be a thing. Not beginning a switch to alternatives will destroy the economy.
@baier_jason @KaitMarieox @AOC More jobs have been created by renewable/sustainable energy than coal in recent years.
@FlyPartridge @KaitMarieox @AOC To get more specific yes a Democratic socialist. Was going to say that but was unsure if I had enough room for the word.
@MyGovtIsTOOBig @KaitMarieox @AOC The economy always does best when the government actually spends money on things like this. It creates jobs and gets money flowing through the economy. This would also create sustainability in energy and pay itself off.
@KaitMarieox @AOC Problems with that statement: AOC isn’t a communist but a socialist(there is a difference) and the GND is literally aimed to create jobs AND promote renewable sources of energy. I’m guessing PoliSci/Public Administration wasn’t your major?
