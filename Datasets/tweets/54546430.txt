This reduction of invasive and overgrown plants, and resulting increase in native vegetation, ensures that various animal species have a home, and that the ecosystem will function efficiently, providing all nearby life with significant benefits. https://t.co/RaG3glokqC
The goats are able to eliminate vegetation threatening native plants, and thus biodiversity, without creating additional threats to the overall health of the ecosystem that other methods, like chemicals, could pose. https://t.co/a8oLnMhahL
When invasive plants take over, there is a decline in the amount and effectiveness of ecosystem services provided to wildlife and people living/working nearby.
Healthy environments rich in biodiversity provide various important ecosystem services to people and wildlife in the area, such as oxygen production, flood mitigation, erosion prevention, nutrient storage/recycling, pollution filtration, carbon dioxide reduction, and more.
By clearing invasive, nuisance, and overgrown landscaping, our goatscapers (at our Narragansett, RI Lab) will help increase plant and animal biodiversity in the area, and improve ecosystem health both above and below the ground. https://t.co/VCvZaWe1z2

Another #StLouisRiverQuest tip for the students: Don’t put anything down the storm sewers.  They’re not for trash or used car oil!  If they overflow after a heavy rain the contaminants will flow directly into an area lake or river.
A #StLouisRiverQuest tip: Medicine may be helpful to us when we are sick, but flushing it down the toilet can harm our lakes and rivers. Look for medicine collection centers or Take Back collection events in your area.
