@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS But tech + people work better and function without walls so put the money into tech and people not expensive walls.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Plenty of people do I've worked in the industry we get the data.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Hadrian built a wall but the Britains still got through it &amp; the Romans eventually pulled out. China built a wall yet enemies still got through. The Nazis built a giant concrete wall called the "Atlantic Wall" it had artillery, machine guns, mines, obstacles, etc &amp; it failed.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS The Soviets built a wall between East and West Germany yet thousands of East Germans made it through that wall and that wall had guard towers and machine guns.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Israel has a wall but they have a consistent problem with tunnels underneath it more than 30 ft below the surface. Weapons and rockets continue to make it under the wall. Please name a situation we're a wall of this type is working as intended.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Many nations do have walls and they continue to be ineffective for example Mexico built a wall on its southern border but the caravans don't find it to be an obstacle. There are walls all over Europe yet it's frequently cited that they have a migrant crisis.
@dougmontague79 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Can you specifically cite something that leads you to believe that they want illegal votes? And can you specifically cite data that suggests Americans don't support their policies?
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS These polls have been way more correct than incorrect over the years. It would be foolish to dismiss the data based on their track record. Oh no science made a mistake I guess we can't trust science ever again.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS I mean we know Pew to be a reliable source of information. You don't have to believe it if you want to and believe whatever supports your narrative but facts will continue to be facts regardless if you believe in them or not. The majority of Americans do not support the wall.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS There is no requirement to go after campaign promises in chronological order. You make priorities based on what is most impactful. Building a unnecessary wall isn't important. The President said in a tweet the other day that our border is secure already everything is very tight.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS For Mr. Trump the wall is completely about politics and image. It is not about legitimate security concerns if it were we will be focusing on where the problems are actually. To construct a wall of the kind the President is calling for would be security and political theater.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Majority of Americans are against the construction and or substantial expansion of the wall. Thus, it can be reasoned that denying the President the money to construct a wall is the will of the people and to construct it would be to go against the favor of the people. https://t.co/dBY1VsY1F6
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS So if he wants to drop this whole wall thing and start focusing on new bridges and roads and repairing our existing infrastructure. He has my total support. Investing in that sort of infrastructure would be good for commerce any economy in general.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Investing in infrastructure should have been priority not a wall and just over 5 billion dollars isn't going to get the wall built. All the actual estimates to actually complete the wall are much higher. By all real measurements the wall would cost upwards to $30+ billion.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Yet that infrastructure spending proposed on the campaign trail has yet to manifest. There hasn't been any plan in writing no official proposal now that he's in office. Democrats have all said that they want to vote for it and we're still waiting for that.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Many of the jobs that would be created to construct a wall would be from Mexican firms. We can also create jobs by spending money on badly needed infrastructure like bridges and roads. That would be a much more effective and lasting America first policy.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Most Americans including the experts disagree that a wall is a step in the right direction. Wasting billions of dollars building a wall isn't good for border security. That money should be going to things that actually make a secure. Our sovereignty is not at all under threat.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Wasting billions, seizing people's private property, and, spending years constructing a massive infrastructure project while ignoring the actual trafficking problems. Oh and harming the environment while we're at it. What an absurd, damaging, and, fiscally irresponsible plan.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Start where there's not a problem and then worry about where the actual crisis is later? Got it. Let's not stop drugs now let's do it later. Spending billions on a wall to increase our perception of safety is more important than stopping drugs pouring into our country good policy
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Better communication equipment to increase the efficiency of coordination among border patrol agents would also go a long way. Increasing the level of cohesion between aircraft and those on the ground also very effective practices.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS People talk about solutions everyday all you need to do is pay attention.
@YlwHammer17 @Gbo08959991 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS There's been several bills introduced and there's plenty of firms with technology some of it already deployed such as thermal imaging equipment, proper nighttime spotting equipment, drones advanced biometric systems at legal ports of entry, etc the list goes on.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS People coming here legally and overstaying their visas is a form of illegal immigration that far outpaces  border crossings.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS It's a hostile journey which is why they're choosing to travel in large groups for safety and we should be asking ourselves how can we help building a wall and locking them out and ignoring them isn't going to help anybody.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS The wall will be ineffective and a waste of money. Repair what we have and reinforce it with modern technology. Building a wall is just more out of control spending by politicians for political reasons only.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS All the problems are already at legal points of entry for example seaports and airports and legal border crossings. Most illegal drugs that are brought into this country are packaged with legitimate goods in shipping containers that come on ships.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS This is wasteful spending and political theater. if we were serious about border security we would address it where the problems are at the legal points of entry.
@Gbo08959991 @YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Immigration and law enforcement experts say otherwise. The people who live on the border it will have their property seized through eminent domain in order to build the wall oppose the wall.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS While we are arguing about a wall that will clearly be ineffective and expensive we continue to have very serious trafficking problems through seaports and through legal border entry points. Which has hardly been mentioned by this administration.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS It should also be noted that in order to construct a wall on the border you would have to seize the private property of American citizens... which is unacceptable. America prides itself on private property rights.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS They're plenty of border patrol agents including the Union who have expressed support for the wall and other still that we should simply repair what we already have and reinforced with technology.  Again border patrol has expressed concern about tunnels, ramps, and ladders.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Let's not waste our tax dollars on something that won't work.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Many Republicans don't want a wall they have stated as much. in fact the only Republican to have a district on the border says it's the most ineffective measure that has been proposed.
@YlwHammer17 @KimberlyMenegh2 @kevinsmith1211 @dickraunchey @newtgingrich @POTUS Invest the money into tech rather than a wall as border patrol has stated many times they're seeing a lot tunnels walls won't stop that and the data shows that most drugs crossing the border come through legal ports of entry on privately owned vehicles or semi trucks. #NoWall

@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat I'm curious do you think there's anything the Pesident has done that deserves criticism &amp; if so what are those things? I see the only positive thing that he's done is to appoint Jon Huntsman ambassador of Russia.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Maybe you're right! I spend an awful lot of time in Russia I'm actually leaving Sunday for Moscow. I guess that's pretty convenient for them I'll be right there.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat I mean we know Russia has been playing both sides of the political aisle for a while now and haven't stopped. Try to keep up.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat They never disarm or hut down their nuclear program. They are still developing nukes our own intelligence and the intelligence agencies of our allies all suggests that. The theater is Trump does that to impresses his supporters. In return Kim gets to use this as propaganda.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Well I have a degree in international relations and I study foreign policy extensively. When it's going well I'll be the first to say that it is. North Korea has done this time and time again. There's nothing new here they've signed treaty after treaty after treaty.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Nobody who is using the term "spy" knows what they're talking about but as the evidence piles up against the people who were on his campaign is becoming more likely that the President himself could have been an "unwitting agent" or as Moscow likes to say a "useful idiot".
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Blackmailing somebody with a video of something is a standard Moscow MO. I don't know if it exists or not and no one in the general public does either. Colbert and Hannity have given the most airtime to that story and one of them is just telling jokes not to be taken seriously.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Everything that he has done thus far with North Korea has been political theater and has done nothing more than legitimize the North Korean totalitarian regime. They still have a nuclear program they haven't disarmed and they said they're not going to until we do first.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Unemployment numbers are largely unreliable regardless of president. It doesn't account for a huge percentage of people who actually don't have jobs by college students for example. And if the jobs being added to the economy are min wage jobs then who cares about those numbers.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Are you suggesting that POTUS shouldn't be receiving the criticism he has been receiving? I'll grant you some things go too far but the large majority the criticism is quite founded and reasonable. He hasn't exactly had a great presidency thus far by any real measurements.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Fallacy? Ppl legitimately directed racist comments towards him regularly. Watch the newsreels. The fact that you think that ppl criticizing him got labelled racist just for criticizing is absurd. I criticized him all the time no one ever called me racist &amp; I work in liberal orgs.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat That's actually not like you saying that at all. Communist, who dislike Obama btw for being far too centrist &amp; corporatist, being at a campaign rally is not the same as racists picking up the mic &amp; saying inexcusable things and having to be shut down by John McCain.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat No she didn't get elected because she ran a bad campaign. Among several other unique 2016 factors. What exactly does misogyny stopping HRC from getting elected have to do with Obama experiencing racism on the campaign trail and throughout his presidency?
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Are you suggesting that Obama experience no racism at any point in the campaign trail or through his presidency? We have incredibly well documented cases. Literally just watch any McCain rally in 2008. McCain repeatedly had to confront supporters about the racist rhetoric.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Is plenty of room to criticize Obama on some of his policies. However Obama endured relentless unfounded criticism from the right on a regular basis not to mention the amount of racism directed toward him on the campaign trail in 2008 all the way through his residency.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Trump gets criticized by the media because his policies are poorly thought-out and his behavior is completely unprofessional on a regular basis. He invites every bit of criticism that he has and then he complains about it the criticism is entirely his fault.
@don_parvin @Jali_Cat We all are. If you don't think that you are then your problems run much deeper.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @newtgingrich What exactly is unfair about it? Is it that they attempt to hold you accountable for your statements, poorly thought-out policies, and even worst behavior? How dare they do their jobs. What was it that you said ... oh yeah, "just calm down and enjoy the ride".
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat I'd say the left is looking pretty good if the only thing they've got going on is falling for BuzzFeed stories &amp; wanting to impeach the president. I'd hate to belong to an ideology that's so feverishly supported by Neo-Nazis &amp; white supremacists.. would be hard to give a pass.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Go back a little further and the Left wants to impeach bush go back some more the Right impeaches Clinton.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat These sorts of things are happening all across the country so the right is looking pretty bad. Of course the Right isn't trying to impeach the right-wing president. Roll the clock back a little bit and the right was all about impeaching President Obama.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat Here in Tennessee we can't even get the right wing elected officials to say Nazis are bad. They literally blocked a bill that specific purpose was to condemn Nazis and white supremacist that are active in our state.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat I don't really need to defend CNN  they are mostly an entertainment network that annoys me. The hardest publications and networks to defend are Fox News, Breitbart, Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, The Blaze, HuffPost, BuzzFeed, etc.
@algonman77 @don_parvin @Jali_Cat I mean echo chambers exist on both sides of the political spectrum so yes I imagine that you live in an echo chamber just as much as in a liberal does.
@algonman77 @don_parvin @Jali_Cat So no spinning the BuzzFeed thing was ridiculous and the logical thing would be to pay attention to what we know is true things that have been confirmed and wait for the Special Counsel's thorough report.
@algonman77 @don_parvin @Jali_Cat Who is spinning? I fine BuzzFeed to lack credibility and I find those who fell for that story to be guilty of confirmation bias. Almost every right-wing talk show or TV host after 5 p.m. dies nothing but run fake news stories, half-truths and perpetuate manufactured crises.
@SandiRyan115 I studied a sub-discipline of political science and so I'm quite fond of doing my own research and I encourage others to do the same. My general rule is if I couldn't use it as a source on an academic paper then I don't use it at all.
@SandiRyan115 I spend a great deal of time in Russia and the media is controlled by the State. The few journalist that are not reading from the State's script... Let's say... are reporting the truth at their own risk. All this began by lightly policing the press.
@SandiRyan115 I feel that punishing news sources regardless of reporting credibility &amp; political skew is a slippery slope toward undermining that institution/a step toward authoritarianism. Someone will take advantage of that power &amp; we can't allow the press to become subservient to the state.
@SandiRyan115 I agree with you to a point. 24-hour news channels are about entertainment while they do have solid journalists. Misinformation exists but a high percentage of news from sources that we know are credible get labeled fake news.
@SandiRyan115 Correct... news sources not citations. That seemed abundantly clear due to context
@SandiRyan115 What are the correct sources that we should be following in your opinion and what makes them the correct sources of news?
@SandiRyan115 None of that answered any of my questions. I didn't ask you why you think CNN is untrustworthy.
@uncleRico1174 @Jali_Cat How is the Right looking? Should the Right also practice skepticism and patience toward news stories and sources that support their narratives or are right-wing sources more credible and trustworthy? If so, why are they more credible and trustworthy in your opinion?
@SandiRyan115 What are the authentic sources? Is it that everything the POTUS says is truth &amp; a proper source is one that supports the POTUS unquestionably &amp; anything negative about the POTUS' actions &amp; policies is false or fake? Which ones are fake &amp; which ones are to be followed?

@DesignGreek It would seem that trust in the media is on the rise again. 	https://t.co/tJVciH6NIt
@cobymac3 No serious person uses the term "spy". An "unwitting agent" or "useful idiot" as Moscow would say, sure, it has certainly been confirmed that people working within his campaign fit into those categories.
@cobymac3 Mr. Trump can engage in whatever fetishes he wants, who are we to deny him his pleasures.
@don_parvin @Jali_Cat Sure it is buddy. Keep living in that echo chamber it's safer there than out here in the real world.
@BeHeardAmerican @Jali_Cat He's doing the job he was appointed to do just fine. He demonstrates the professionalism and work ethic you  expect from a Marine. A true patriot who has never stopped serving his country. An example for all of us.
@GilaMonster_AZ @Jali_Cat What?
@realDonaldTrump Let us know when you start putting our great nation first. #stillwaiting #AreWeWinningYet?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Hope it is that you are ending the #TrumpShutown for the sake of all those federal workers, the overall function of our government, and Americans everywhere. This has been pointless and wasteful. Most of us don't want a wall. #NoWall
We can't afford to look foolish. Confirmation bias is dangerous. All we're going to do is validate the Right's narratives &amp; undermine the impact &amp; validity of actual news. Approach any news story with skepticism and patience, especially from sources like #BuzzFeedNews https://t.co/7bs1kbCfsc

RT @repjimcooper: Racism, white supremacy, intolerance, and hate have no place anywhere in America.
Agree. The only way we're going to see lasting change in our society in regards to these types of sentiments is to remove the engines that produce, encourage, &amp; perpetuate them Rep. Steve King has been doing all three of those things for a while now. #SteveKing #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/WnThYMy6UO
