@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 8/ Of course I‚Äôm only talking about the statutory changes to FAR/DFARS/other regs here. For super-technical stuff that‚Äôs not in law, we *should* take a long time to make rules and make sure all stakeholders can give feedback. Don‚Äôt want unelected folks making policies on a whim.
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 7/ But the problem is that class deviations only fix really high profile stuff like the MPT. For other, more obscure statutory changes you might have to wait for years while we grind through the gears of a non-value-added rulemaking process.
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 6/ As @JennaMcGeek rightly points out, we use class deviations as a band-aid to deal with this problem. See the most recent MPT one here: https://t.co/Ce1jVbjaeQ
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 5/ Some members of Congress have understandably complained about this - ‚ÄúWe fixed this problem in an NDAA two years ago, why is it still a problem?!‚Äù
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 4/ But our system demands that we go through the same long and complex process for things that have already been enacted into law. Ultimately, it‚Äôs the law so you‚Äôre not going to change it unless you lobby Congress. But we have to pretend we‚Äôre genuinely considering changes.
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 3/ It takes a *long* time to go through the rulemaking process - as it should for things that aren‚Äôt already laid out in law. There are good reasons for lengthy notice and comment periods on highly technical issues.
@PeterOrlowicz @packtray @michaelccata @timmathews @JennaMcGeek @SleepyHead_band 2/ Like you point out, the $3,500 MPT is still in the FAR even though the statutory change was made a while ago: https://t.co/VyiKOZ0AAc

@JustRichWebster My main point is that we shouldn‚Äôt be demanded that they make those tradeoffs. We should be empowering working-level ppl so that they don‚Äôt even end up grappling with whether to take a $20K raise and go to some firm in Crystal City with bean bag chairs and free afternoon beers.
@JustRichWebster Didn‚Äôt mean to imply at all that we don‚Äôt have tons of great people. Everybody working in this space makes tradeoffs related to how much micromanagement they‚Äôre willing to put up with. Many put up with it because they see it as a basic cost of serving their country.
Of course everyone is different, and some people don‚Äôt have a problem with this kind of work environment. But if you want comprehensive process reform, a necessary 1st step is to build an environment that reformers are willing to spend their time in.
There are loads of creative people who haven‚Äôt yet been broken by life, are reform-minded, and want to work in govt. But they won‚Äôt work in a system that baby-walks them through process after process, and expects them to implement/comply with those processes like an automaton.
When we have NDAAs that average about a thousand pages *every year* it adds tons of set-in-stone requirements to the day-to-day work of folks on the ground.
Low salaries and slow hiring processes are always raised as issues, but in my view the biggest impediment to getting excellent people into government is micromanagement - frequently at the congressional level.
There are huge problems with recruitment/retention and some of them are partly due to insufficient automation. But even if cloud computing somehow magically = process automation (which it doesn‚Äôt) it still wouldn‚Äôt address the big problems.
The idea that cloud computing can radically change government talent acquisition and learning management systems is nonsense. For people seeking jobs or doing mandatory employee training, what do they care if these processes are cloud based or not?

@BenSasse thoughts on the Nebraska state government software procurement process?
This would also allow projects to fail faster. If state procurement officials have a direct window into vendor operations and see that a project is a boondoggle, they‚Äôll presumably cancel or reboot it *before* spending $12 million on garbage.
If Nebraska wants to fix this problem, it would be better served by ensuring that software development involves integrated teams of end-users, procurement officials, and programmers/architects on the vendor side.
One state senator‚Äôs proposed solution? A judicial review process kind of akin to GAO bid protests. Color me skeptical about whether this would help fix problems like the recent software development failures.
Turns out it‚Äôs not just the federal government that can‚Äôt do #software #procurement right: Nebraska recently fired two technology contractors after spending $12 million on failed upgrades https://t.co/U70CZKd2xL

@JennaMcGeek Sounds reasonable. Offices of a dozen or so people can get stuck in a particular way of doing things, outsiders/contractors sometimes bring a positive type of disruption.
@JennaMcGeek What is a watcher contract? You mean like a public sector IG office hiring a PI to sort of red-team their own work? I haven‚Äôt heard that term before.
@JennaMcGeek Speaks to the way in which acquisition in some way affects nearly all other functional fields - and they, in turn, affect acquisition, for better or for worse
@JennaMcGeek From what I can tell, there have been (so far anyway) zero charges brought in this case against any formally trained acquisition professional. And yet it‚Äôs a case of clear, egregious contracting fraud...
@JennaMcGeek This isn‚Äôt about FAR or DFARS compliance, it‚Äôs about medical ethics and military law and corporate citizenship and a bunch of other things that don‚Äôt seem to directly tie in to the formal acquisition system
@JennaMcGeek Based on the article, these were federal contracts (DHA funded probably) for drug shipments. I‚Äôd assume they weren‚Äôt categorized as service contracts but who knows who weird agency-level rules.
Great story with two core takeaways IMHO: (1) there‚Äôs an intoxicating ease with which people fall into the pit of defrauding the government, and (2) every now and then, weird random private investigators may be better at oversight than IGs https://t.co/vDXZBWZtvh

@ZaknafienDC @Hayley_Mae_86 Yeah, huge problem. Too many people assume the biggest chest-puffer in the room (invariably male) is correct just because he behaves like a silverback gorilla.

@ZaknafienDC @Hayley_Mae_86 Apologizing for problems/mistakes is a sign of personal responsibility, not lack of seriousness. Equating honest self-criticism with weakness is a good way to to end up with sociopaths in charge of everything.

@JustRichWebster Of course there's more than just process-related barriers to entry, but I find those are the ones that you can generally get everybody on board with reforming.
@JustRichWebster Some of this is about IT modernization. Other pieces of it are about saying to people hey, that piece of paper that we file every time you do a procurement? The one that requires 15 different signatures and takes 4 months to finish? It's really not important and we should stop.
@JustRichWebster Super important. Breaking barriers to entry is the kind of win-win stuff that labor unions and military and Lockheeds and D's and R's all ought to support. We should be working to get the stupid out of program management and contracting.
@Ami_Marisol @jodilasky Sorry Ami but I feel like you completely missed the real core point of that discussion which is actually cat gifs
All of the 3 main answers I listed are considered legitimate, to some extent, by most people who get plopped into policymaking roles. But we tend to disagree, sometimes intensely, on the specific emphasis.
Is the *main* purpose of government procurement to serve the agency? (deliver high quality solutions) The taxpayer? (spend as little money as possible) Or the worker? (in other words, a jobs program) Or some other group?
Jodi, you're getting at what I think is the real fundamental issue that we're all sort of dancing around with this small biz stuff: What's the *point* of government procurement? https://t.co/l7zMERkHqz

@Ami_Marisol @jodilasky @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir It's not like this would ever even be seriously considered on the Hill, right? Which means that the 809 people must have recommended it simply to force a conversation. Seems they've succeeded. üò∫
@Ami_Marisol @jodilasky @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir There are ways to structure socioeconomic programs in such a way that they don't block PMs from using program funds to achieve program success. And from what some PMs have told me, effectively 20% of their budget, sometimes more, is effectively controlled by other offices.
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir My broad point is that, yes, 809 has a bunch of giant defense corp ppl, but that may not be the main driver behind this section of their paper. It might be more about working-level people feeling like they're being micromanaged, and I can sympathize with that.
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir I'm *not* saying this is how all PMs or contracting people feel; I've heard some say they have no problem with these policies. But it's how some feel. That may be driving this recommendation from the 809 Panel (especially taking into account their earlier SBIR recommendations).
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir And the other (small biz goaling and set asides and some similar policies) may sometimes feel like people a dozen tiers above you are telling you how to buy (again, looking at this purely from the POV of certain PMs or certain contracting officers)
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense @dodsbir 2. From a program manager perspective, SBIR and small biz goaling may feel like radically different policy approaches. They're both designed to drive DOD contract funding to small biz vendors, but one is encouraging investment in small biz through a dedicated funding line (SBIR)
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense 1. In their Volume 1 report, they actually pushed for a lot of @dodsbir changes that seemed pretty pro-small biz, including funding expansion and permanent enactment https://t.co/UwAIbgIDYn
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel @DeptofDefense On the #SmallBusiness set aside issue, I'd point out two things:
@jodilasky @Ami_Marisol @Section809Panel Like @Ami_Marisol points out, they can't actually do anything apart from influence the discussion and provide suggestions. @Section809Panel has no statutory authority to make changes to law or policy; it's up to Congress and @DeptofDefense to do stuff as they see fit.

@MaxBoot When this occurs over and over, it affects institutional culture. People start to constantly and automatically think in terms of how to deal with admin nonsense rather than how to solve real-world problems. And that is a serious waste of money (and a mostly invisible one). /10
@MaxBoot And now we‚Äôre failing at two instead of succeeding at one. And it‚Äôs not because of too little money, it‚Äôs because sudden saturation with excess cash created an institutional addiction that we‚Äôre now coming down off of hard. /9
@MaxBoot So we keep it, alongside P1. Neither is properly funded except when the pendulum swings really far, in which years they‚Äôre both funded too much. We started with a single top priority that we were successfully addressing. /8
@MaxBoot P2 is a self licking ice cream cone at this point. And even if none of the special interest groups associated with P2 existed, are we going to just toss it in the garbage? That would basically waste all the development dollars we already poured into it. /7
@MaxBoot One might think ‚Äòget rid of P2,‚Äô but that‚Äôs not the way this works. By the time it‚Äôs been established for a few years, it‚Äôs got equity holders throughout government and the military and private sector and congressional districts where contracts/bases are centered. /6
@MaxBoot Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôve got $1M for 2 priorities P1 &amp; P2, and that‚Äôs only enough to fund P1. P1 gets prioritized, and then we add another $1M because politics and hooray, we get to add P2 to our list of projects. But then we subtract the $1M because politics and uh oh, what do we do? 5/
@MaxBoot As a scholar of IR, you‚Äôre familiar with the ‚Äòresource curse‚Äô idea. Something similar can occur within DOD as the budget pendulum swings back and forth - dumping tons of money into defense can have negative effects on institutional quality. /4
@MaxBoot DOD doesn‚Äôt need more funding, it needs more *stable* funding. It also needs more leeway to spend money in ways that make sense rather than ways that have been baked into a long budget cycle 2+ years in advance. /3
@MaxBoot All too often the exact opposite is true. People get a pile of cash dumped on them and have to spend it, and when the size of the pile is shifting up and down every year, they start to focus more on getting cash spent rather than doing something useful with it. /2
@MaxBoot I appreciate the point of view you‚Äôre coming from here, and the fact that you‚Äôre calling out fiscal irresponsibility. But you‚Äôre stuck in the way-too-common fallacy of assuming that more money = a better military. /1

@USCyberMag If, for each person in a network, there‚Äôs a non-zero probability of some bad thing occurring, then bigger networks mean higher probabilities. And if bigger networks also mean that black-swan events trigger worse things, then we should probably just have smaller networks.
@USCyberMag Agree that cybersecurity is important and that it‚Äôs all about people; my point was more to the statistical argument for small resilient systems over large brittle ones.
@millerth3 @DAUNow And that‚Äôs assuming cyber security reqs prove to be useful. In many cases, once they go from the ‚Äúgood idea fairy‚Äù phase to the implementation phase, reqs like this end up as poorly-done, mandatory-viewing PowerPoint presentations. 5/
@millerth3 @DAUNow Hundreds of thousands of people work to provide DOD with road maintenance services, food prep services, petroleum, generators, clothing, water, any number of other things. These ppl probably don‚Äôt need to be cyber security certified. 3/
@millerth3 @DAUNow The federal govt buys about $500 billion of goods and services each year from the private sector, and even for DOD the vast majority of that is not particularly sensitive. 2/
@millerth3 @DAUNow You‚Äôre not going to get most govt vendors to set up airwalled networks to prevent any and all connections to the outside world... and there‚Äôs no legitimate reason to do so in the vast majority of cases. 1/

@Aelkus If many people don‚Äôt even know why they‚Äôre adding complexity, why should a tangible benefit matter? (I can‚Äôt speak for HP erotica, but in govt functional communities, some people clearly don‚Äôt know exactly why they do what they do - complexity is like an instinctive reaction.)
@Aelkus They may not even know why they‚Äôre doing this in many cases, but in many cases, the root of it is that it‚Äôs a way of deliberalizing a niche labor market. But doing so in a way that‚Äôs a lot less visible than, say, occupational licensing or guilds or overt cronyism.
@Aelkus You see this in functional communities in government all the time: Financial mgmt ppl deliberately making finance regs overly complex, acquisition ppl deliberately making acq rules overly complex.
@Aelkus Where do you think this stems from? Deliberately increasing the difficulty of work performed by an ingroup is a pretty universal human tendency. There are basic economic incentives behind it.

For another thing, nothing in the release seems to state that the contracted food and supplies in question weren‚Äôt actually delivered - in other words, DOD seems to have largely gotten what it paid for
For one thing, it‚Äôs not clear from the DOJ release that all, or even a majority, of the total $9 billion contract face value was ever obligated (i.e., spent)
The defendants, in violation of sanctions law, ‚Äúconspired to increase Anham‚Äôs profits in connection with the SPV-A contract by shipping warehouse building materials to Afghanistan via Iran, instead of using more costly, but legal, routes‚Äù

@Ami_Marisol @somethingbrite @cmclymer @Ocasio2018 @DeptofDefense 4/ The U.S. Code tends to be simpler than DOD's financial regulations, but still too complicated. If @Ocasio2018 is looking for a way to really improve the openness/accessibility of DOD's finances, consolidating the relevant laws and regs would be a great place to start.
@Ami_Marisol @somethingbrite @cmclymer @Ocasio2018 @DeptofDefense 3/ Excess complexity is largely caused by the fact that DoD is just gigantic, you can't manage literally millions of people and trillions of dollars in assets without it being really complex. But it's also cause by incomprehensible regulations like the DFARS and FMR.
@Ami_Marisol @somethingbrite @cmclymer @Ocasio2018 @DeptofDefense 2/ Lack of standardization is caused by the lack of a single authority across both functional communities (e.g., requirements development vs. financial management vs. acquisition) and organizations (e.g., Army vs. Air Force vs. Navy vs. OSD vs. congressional defense committees)
@Ami_Marisol @somethingbrite @cmclymer @Ocasio2018 1/ As a more serious response to the point made by Representative-elect @Ocasio2018 - the biggest problems with @DeptofDefense accounting aren't so much about transparency or malfeasance, but rather (1) lack of standardization and (2) excess complexity
@Ami_Marisol @somethingbrite @cmclymer @Ocasio2018 Yes the DFARS is always a fun weekend read, but if you *really* want something hot to add to your summer reading list, you also gotta include that stirring work of Joycean literary genius, the 7,325-page Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R üò∫ https://t.co/dzzVoyYACz

These functional communities are often the sources of core problems, but they‚Äôre also the communities who don‚Äôt actually have any primary responsibility for delivering the IT systems in question.
But the requirements community doesn‚Äôt allow for changing tech details midstream, and the budget community demands that you lay out exact plans years ahead of time.
Sometimes the program office, contracting, vendor(s), and end-users are all in alignment and onboard with the ideas of agile development, failing fast, staying adaptable, etc.
This is probably true, but whose culture? Whose communication? In many cases, not the program management or contracting people.

@Ami_Marisol @sbirgov @dodsbir @DeptofDefense @USGAO Good that Congress is focusing specifically on hard data to refute or confirm long wait times, rather than a broad request for GAO produce a generic ‚ÄúDOD must improve‚Äù report
@Ami_Marisol @sbirgov @dodsbir @DeptofDefense Also commissions a @USGAO report on amount of time it takes to award SBIR/STTR contracts (Section 854)
@Ami_Marisol @sbirgov @dodsbir @DeptofDefense (Arguably problematic, since having a larger number of smaller-dollar line items possibly reduces reprogramming flexibility)

@ValerieInsinna I‚Äôm just noting that having a HAC subcommittee chair politick their way through resource allocation looks shady to voters, and reinforces many of the worst, most conspiratorial ideas about DC. It undermines popular confidence in the integrity of our political system.
@ValerieInsinna I agree, I don‚Äôt personally see this as ‚Äúcorruption.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure the military will make good use of these planes, and yes we‚Äôre going to buy tons of these things anyway, and hey they might even get better pricing with advance buys - you‚Äôre the expert on that.
@ValerieInsinna There‚Äôs no solution here apart from comprehensive reform of the processes by which money is dispersed throughout the government. Has to have buy-in from leg and exec branches, and be communicated clearly to the voters.
@ValerieInsinna It‚Äôs not Kay Granger‚Äôs fault - she‚Äôs just giving the voters of her district what they want. The source of corruption here is you, me, our friends &amp; families &amp; neighbors - all of us who despise backroom-dealing in principle, but not when it redirects federal dollars to our area.
@ValerieInsinna This is a big part of why people see the political class as ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù - because of this kind of district/state based rent-seeking so common in DC. People are right, there is corruption. But what people don‚Äôt understand is *who* the real corrupt party is.
@ValerieInsinna Glad there are reporters like you illustrating in layman‚Äôs terms why we need appropriations process reform. We need a big chunk of the electorate to recognize this as a problem if we‚Äôre going to fix it.
