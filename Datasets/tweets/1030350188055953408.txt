@hr392_stop The GC should be allowed based on merit and the need is a merit based immigration reform not the country of birth skill.
@hr392_stop The point is pretty simple there shouldn‚Äôt be a discrimination based on country of birth.
@hr392_stop Is the tax bracket different for them ?
@hr392_stop Terribly wrong. Compare the salary of Microsoft employees from india and row (you can get the GC salary info from dol or USCIS site). You don‚Äôt have to provide it here, it‚Äôs for your own understanding, there won‚Äôt be any differece as you falsely claim.

@Patrickm55P @Sap_WomenRights @Shiva48447876 @kashspirit37 @rc05689 @rahulbhatiya7 @Rejecthr392 @POTUS @HR392 That means the jobs are gone. Federal and State taxes are also lost.

@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS As long as 2 people from any other nation who went to same school for same degree and working in same company on same job profile are not treated equally in EB, I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs discrimination and the system is broken.

@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS It‚Äôs fun to see you calling names. Some how I feel like you are a kid using some fake account. Why are  you reluctant in mentioning your personal interest in preventing any changes in the outdated immigration system?
@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS Chain migration happens when you get GC right away not after 20 yrs. who are you going to  sponsor after 25 yrs or 150 yrs in current scenario ?
@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS O yeah! I don‚Äôt see any anyone else squealing or whining. Still you are hiding your personal interest against HR392.
@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS Why you squealing? I‚Äôll say let the law makers handle it. What‚Äôs your interest ? Are you running some bodyshop or waiting for chain migration?
@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS Also, I won‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou are in rush‚Äù to a person who is a victim of country of birth discrimination and waiting in the queue for 10+ yrs.

My point was country of birth shouldn‚Äôt be a criteria in that situation.
@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS I think people who are misusing the EB category for pumping cheap low skilled labor are in rush and get GC directly instead of going through h1 with min salary requirements. https://t.co/RV1D4RdjwW

@lord_curzon @Shiva48447876 @IMMIREFORM2019 @realSureshMatha @theDuff4 @shaheenchevv @USCIS Exactly, there shouldn‚Äôt be any discrimination whether it‚Äôs race, gender or religion. Not in a professional work place.
@theDuff4 @realSureshMatha @IMMIREFORM2019 @Shiva48447876 @lord_curzon @shaheenchevv @USCIS Minimum salary limit is there for H1B but it‚Äôs not there in EB category . I‚Äôll say they should raise the min salary for H1B and enforce min salary on EB category. Country of birth should never be a qualification for highly skilled immigration. https://t.co/w4p4usGIXo
@Write2speak1 @IMMIREFORM2019 @USCIS May be his hatred is blinding him or could be some other reasons.  But he don‚Äôt understand the system is outdated and there is no way to reward or prioritize immigrants graduated from Ivy leagues and having great jobs. He don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs merit.
@lord_curzon @Shiva48447876 @IMMIREFORM2019 @realSureshMatha @theDuff4 @shaheenchevv @USCIS Sorry that you are digressing. I‚Äôm taking about real US experience and real US education.

@IMMIREFORM2019 @Write2speak1 @USCIS Which EB1 category could be use to file GC for an MBA from Ivy League university working as Director or VP?

@lord_curzon @IMMIREFORM2019 @realSureshMatha @theDuff4 @Shiva48447876 @shaheenchevv @USCIS I‚Äôm only talking about the ‚Äúmerit based‚Äù system here.

@lord_curzon @IMMIREFORM2019 @realSureshMatha @theDuff4 @Shiva48447876 @shaheenchevv @USCIS Okay great.

@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson I‚Äôll expect a point based system to follow it.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson #HR392 does not add any new GC‚Äôs or new VISA‚Äôs it eliminates the per country limit. There are pros n cons. But it eliminates discrimination based on country of birth and gives GC on First Come First Serve basis based on different EB categories.first step to merit based system.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson On the other side of a company weighs skills they will not have any problem in giving the highest salary.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson I think the existing min salary is 60K for H1B.Raising it to 100-120K will fix the issue of employers seeking cheap employment. But this will only limit the people in H1B. There is no min cut off for people getting GC directly bypassing H1B. So I‚Äôll recommend a min cut off in EB.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson #HR392 does not increase any numbers it prioritize people who are already working in US instead instead of bringing anyone new directly.
@Granner1 @RepKevinYoder @GOP @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @TuckerCarlson What‚Äôs stoping these global corporations from going to any immigrant friendly countries where they can find talents? Also, how‚Äôs #HR392 going to impact wages?

@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley Clearly you have covert interest in the candidates from travel ban countries and who want to continue misusing the decades old immigration system.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley Outsourcing companies should be punished. Companies and Travel ban countries abusing the current system and family based immigration for stealing American jobs should be taken care off. Doctors, Engineers , researchers shouldn‚Äôt suffer coz of outsourcing companies. Yes for #HR392
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley James, That‚Äôs the very point that I‚Äôm trying to make , they can only abuse people who are stuck in GC backlog. ROWs get GC right away and they can move and progress in careers. BTW great point James.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley Outsourcing companies thrive by misusing H1B and GC backlogs. #HR392 will burst outsourcing companies and cheap labour. Also, the channel used by outsourcing companies are being low skilled cheap employees from non- populous countries who get GC in 6 months.Again #HR392 !!
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley @Cissna That said it‚Äôs important to create backlogs, with through vetting, which is already been worked on by USCIS.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that you are also of the view that the current process needs to be based on fairness and merit.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley @Cissna Director Cissna**.The 70 year backlog is preventing from creating startups. Also its not only the Fortune 500 companies that creates jobs and innovation. There are multiple startups created by Indian including AppDynamics, Harness etc.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley Don‚Äôt worry about H1B‚Äôs if you are familiar with the USCIS crack down on body shops. I believe that USCIS is doing a good job under Director @cissna.
Thanks much @SenAmyKlobuchar!! Your leadership in bringing fairness by removing per country cap is much appreciated! https://t.co/CAFGPRPmAM
@sudiptoimpmail @MDVisas @needagcfast @FoxNews @CNN #HR392 eliminates multiple queues and country of origin caps. The candidates needs to compete against the international talent pool instead of their own country. It prevents preferential GC allotment based on country of birth.
@khokhani76 @DanKess @RepMiaLove #HR392 does not increase the number of GC. It only bring fairness in system. It provide GC who are already in the workforce. It protect American jobs by preventing the misuse of decades old dated process.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley There are thousands of Indians working for Amazon and IBM. Many are capable of starting 100‚Äôs of companies like HackerRank or even better and create jobs and boost US economy once they get GC. Thanks JamesA for bringing this up and support #HR392.
@JamesA96145445 @jeffsessions @ChuckGrassley Did you meant to say HackerRank is started by Indians and they grade the programmers? https://t.co/JHJ1CufAtc
@mimulmirom @FAIRImmigration Great to see somebody putting forward some great ideas. Totally agree with defining speciality occupation,salary and 12 months OPT. Also, the rule should prevent applying for GC in OPT.
@mimulmirom @FAIRImmigration Why 200K for H1B? Why not for EB category ? The minimum salary should apply for H1B and EB right? Is it coz Masters and PhD students from travel ban countries don‚Äôt have to go through H1B process? Is it coz they get GC while they are on OPT  abusing the existing system ?
4)Travel ban Masters and PhD candidate In US will end up applying H1B and their privilege to get GC right away after graduation or during OPT will end. Meaning, additional vetting and no cheap or low skilled or zero experienced labour to US work force.
#HR392 Cons:	1) The time frame for clearing the backlog is estimated to be 2-3 years without completely halting ROW.	2) Will adversely affect travel-ban countries and their capability to meet relatives.	3) This will also adversely affect the chain migration from TB countries.
10) Kids won‚Äôt go out of status and continue their education and contribute further.	11) GC will be given to the employees who are already there in the work force and will ensure fairness and requires new GS‚Äôs to be earned.	12) Prevents Chain migration and protects American jobs
5) Makes the business difficult for bodyshops.	6) Stops the Exploitation of employees thus raising the wages and increasing mobility.	7) Allows immigrants to start and own companies.	8) Boost US Economy and gives the backlogged employees to invest in housing market.
#HR392 Pros:	1) First step to a FIFO system that will clear backlogs and brings every one in single queue. 	2)Set path for a points/merit based system.	3)Ends decades old EB country cap abuse.	4) Ends Chain migration and pumping of cheap low skilled labour to US workforce.
Impacts of #HR392?	It‚Äôs the stepping stone to a fair system from a decades old outdated process to a merit based future system. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do anything nothing is going to change‚Äù. And yes the abusers and people wanting chain migration never want #HR392 to pass.
Another scenarios is when the person from travel ban country wants to apply for GC and bring relatives to US behind the doors. #HR392 is going to make them wait for 2-3 years and thus delaying the chain migration and pumping low skilled relatives to US job market.
#HR392 will prevent the abuse of current system. It will bring every one to one simple queue based on merit (EB1,EB2,EB3). It could be enhanced further with points. It will prevent or delay the Chain migration to a larger extend.
Immigration System and concerns around Family Based and other GC‚Äôs(860,000). How many of them enters the workforce? What‚Äôs the impact of 860K every year VS 300K Indians backlogged for 10 yrs and already in US workforce? https://t.co/F1Cl1eC1bT
No wonder they want to prevent #HR392.	Exact same reason why they create fake accounts to spread propaganda, creates panic on jobs among others and manipulate facts.
They will end up competing against international professionals once country cap is removed. They can‚Äôt get GC in 6 months. They will have to prove themselves, contribute to US economy and maintain clean criminal history before they earn GC. This will delay their Chain Migration.
The decades old rule of per country limit is misused by the travel ban countries to promote chain migration. Bringing low skilled relatives and snatch American jobs. #HR392 will stop this decades old abuse. They will end up earning GC instead or getting GC granted.
How will #HR392 impact the Travel ban countries?	No Brainer. It will end the  decades old GC system abuse by Travel ban countries. While the president was working on travel ban on one side, the people from travel ban countries used to abuse the decades old system to get in to US
Only 14% of 1 million GC is allotted for Employment Based category. The rest is for family based  or diversity lottery. How the abuse could be stopped for 860000 GC allotted where the uneducated or low skilled relatives gets GC through Chain migration and enter the US workforce.
Many of them can get GC in no time without proving at work or contributing to US economy. They get citizen ship in 5 yrs and will start chain migration and bringing more unskilled people in Family immigration and pump the US workforce with low skilled cheap labour.
Current EB country cap abusers will be against #HR392 but will be wanting Merit Based Immigration. Are they ready to work for merit based immigration? NO. They wanted to abuse the system for ever and don‚Äôt want any change to the existing outdated system.
Does people who are against #HR392 wants Merit Based Immigration?	Masters and Phd Students in US universities from all countries should ideally welcome merit based immigration. But the question is when is it going to happen? Current system is nearly 100 th anniversary.
It will make candidates to compete against the international resource pool instead of competing in the per country pool. Thus promoting the brightest. This will make America to get the best talents (this could be the first step and implement point based system)
With #HR392 employers will not be able to abuse employees stuck in GC backlog and thus raising the salaries and improving the mobility. As mentioned earlier it prevents GC abuse and makes them earn it instead of granting it.
#HR392 will make the GC system FIFO and treats doctors,engineers,researchers...equally, irrespective of their country of origin. It will give priority the the existing backlogged workers and prevents low skilled cheap workers entering the workforce. Thus protecting American jobs
Is it the best bill ?	No. It will make the existing system fair and set path for the merit based/ point based system once all professionals are in the same queue in respective employment category compared to the non sense and discriminatory per country queue that existing now.
Why #HR392 ?	This will bring fairness to the existing system(many call the existing system outdated and broken).All professionals will be treated equally in the corresponding EB category irrespective of their country of origin.
Food for thought: Should we be bringing more unskilled cheap workers or should we support US educated /working /taxpaying professionals? Should we treat qualified professionals equally in corresponding skill based category EB1,EB2,EB3...without making them wait based on country?
Masters or PhD Students from non-populous countries can get GC while they are on OPT. They don‚Äôt even go through H1B process. Also others outside US and from non populous countries can enter US directly on GC waiting for 5-6 months. It promotes chain migration too.
Who is against #HR392?	 The answer is simple ,the very people who are abusing the existing system.The people who want to bring relatives in student/exchange/visitor visa and abused the minimal wait time in GC processing for non populous countries.
Ideally GC should be based on skills in EB category and based on proven experience and specialized skills and how they can contribute to US Economy and society. US EDUCATION,SALARY,YEARS of US EXPERIENCE,CRIME HISTORY, CREDIT HISTORY,LANGUAGE SKILLS ... etc should be considered.
Also, foreign students who are already in US from Non populous countries benefit from current system as they can get GC right after graduation while staying on OPT. Masters and PhD candidates can get GC in Advanced degree category. Again no H1B process required.
Citizens from less populous countries can get GC in months wait time and can start working on GC without even going through H1B process. This new candidates are going to create additional burden on job market and create cheap labour. H1B candidates are already in US and working.
Will #HR392 steal American Jobs?	No. It will only make the process fair compared to where it is now and pave path to the merit based system. FIFO is going to help American jobs from new low skilled or non specialized ppl entering the system without going through the H1B process.
