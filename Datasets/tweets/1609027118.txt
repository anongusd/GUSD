President Trump said "Mexico would pay for the wall" because he felt they owe us for allowing crime to pour into our country. 		2006 legislation passed by Congress is what the American people bring up with the border not who pays for it. 		Americans WANT to pay for the wall!
@SenBobCorker American people voted for a wall and border security! Do you have a problem with that? You do! Okay, well how about you go away(which you are) if you don't listen to We The People.

Who knows if pulling out of the Middle East is a good strategy for success. 		One thing is certain, we need a financial and mental break from war. 		Millennials voted for Trump because we were done with war. 		It's time!
@JackPosobiec Yes, 17 straight years at war. 		17 straight years of our generation suffering the effects and costs of war! 		Time to come home.

I feel like we should go over AGAIN how confusing and answerless the Syrian situation is. It's smart to pull our troops out. We are too involved in the Middle East. Russia has a role in M.E.! Further put sanctions on Russia and keep competing with our natural gas, if needed.
@AnnCoulter You were never part of this movement. Bye!
@ColumbiaBugle naw, it shows that conservatives will do anything to get the wall. Trump only needs they $$$ and it'll get built. Signed into law in '06 and our military has deemed it a national emergency.

@tedlieu Trump's base is crushing on you, sir. Thank you. It means a lot that you're honest here.
@TheMadArab_ @Gringz @ColumbiaBugle Military fully funded again. Conservative judges are getting approved everyday. Tax cuts have resulted in lowest unemployment in nearly 19 years. Coal plants reopening. Manufacturing has comeback. Roads are being built again. He's pulled us out of Syria.
@TheMadArab_ @Gringz @ColumbiaBugle Our biggest threats of ISIS, NoKo, China, and Iran are all completely dismantled. Saudi and the corrupt oil cartel have caved to our demands of oil production. Pulled us out of a wealth redistribution called the Paris Accord. He actually has started parts of building the wall...

It should be illegal for restaurants not to have music playing in their dining room. Awkward silence in public is unfavorable!
