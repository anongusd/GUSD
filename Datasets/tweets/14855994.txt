If you can only imagine Dems nominating a neolib who can‚Äôt make the anti-billionaire case, then you can only imagine a race with 2 billionaires (Schultz &amp; Trump) harming Dems. If you can imagine Dems nominating a real populist, then you can imagine a victory over 2 billionaires.
@mcbyrne Theres a failure to imagine possibilities: the only possibility people can imagine is a Dem corporatist nominee who can‚Äôt make the anti-billionaire argument. That failure of imagination and aspiration is a core part of the defeatism that has created the crises the country faces.
@mcbyrne If they choose the right nominee, they should be able to draw a very powerful contrast.

Alternate take: Yes, theres a danger Schultz splits the vote, but theres also a chance that a progressive Dem running against 2 billionaires may create a great contrast for the Dem.

This article about Beto calling for limits on collective bargaining has prompted a good debate about unions in general, and police unions in specific. It‚Äôs almost as if journalism isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúattack,‚Äù but instead exists to prompt substantive policy debates! https://t.co/Ss5FWT9WVI

In the 20 years since I graduated college, I‚Äôve wondered why people tune out politics and news media. At age 43, I now understand why. In light of all this, the urge to give up is rational. I don‚Äôt think folks should give up &amp; tune out ‚Äî but I get the impulse. It‚Äôs not illogical.
The few politicians proposing solutions to these problems are vilified. The few journalists who report on politicians making these problems worse ‚Äî they are also vilified by partisans who are more focused on enforcing party loyalty than on protecting the future of the planet.
We have less than 12 yrs to ward off a climate crisis. Millions dont have access to basic medical care &amp; are struggling to subsist. And we have a media/political class &amp; a tribalist political culture that is hostile to anyone proposing clear &amp; obvious solutions to these problems.
The media industry is not a healthy industry. It is a machine of economic redistribution to the super rich. A friend once said that for most workaday journalists, the media industry will no longer provide a career path for economic survival. I now think my friend was right. https://t.co/Jit8RjiYtW

A terrifying possibility that rarely gets discussed: Dems electing an elite-coddling corporatist in 2020 who doesnt deliver transformative policies that help millions of people, and the GOP then using the backlash to that failure to elect a smarter, more extreme version of Trump.
As I‚Äôve said before: many affluent liberals seem to think we can just revert back to the pre-Trump Era and everything will be awesome, because everything was awesome back then for the affluent. But the fact remains: it wasn‚Äôt all that awesome for millions of the non-affluent. https://t.co/kr0ix45IqN
This NYT nugget is important: Biden is positioned as a candidate promising to return America to the alleged ‚Äústability‚Äù of the pre-Trump status quo.

I want to be clear here: I‚Äôve done a lot of jobs for Dems and for media outlets, but literally to this day, the only one that I get accusingly interrogated about is having worked for Bernie 20 years ago as a kid. The bias and hatred against him is very deep and very real.
I worked for Bernie right out of college. For 20 yrs, this ‚Äî and only this ‚Äî has made getting any job in politics/media far more difficult. I‚Äôm not complaining, but I speak from experience when I say that the hatred of him &amp; his ideology by the political/media class is very real.

Charisma, good looks &amp; awesome social media skillz don‚Äôt fight to stop climate change. By contrast, supporting policies that boost fossil fuel production ends up accelerating climate change. Maybe coverage of the 2020 election should focus on the latter, not the former.

Lots of progressives have legit criticism of Obama‚Äôs policy record. Much of the response to that criticism has been ‚ÄúDemocratic voters love Obama, so anyone criticizing him is politically dumb!‚Äù In other words, the response is often a political argument, rather than a policy one.
Let's be honest here: the reason is probably not because voters in these places want their representatives to enrich Manhattan bankers. More likely, it's because politicians in these places want lots of campaign donations from Manhattan bankers. https://t.co/HCRZHVtSFW

Weird: I worked for House Dems &amp; Clinton/CAP folk AFTER I worked for Bernie 19 yrs ago &amp; I worked for Dems/CAP for a longer time. It's odd that whenever I report a tough story on Establishment Dems, critics depict me as "tied" to Bernie, but not to Establishment Dems. Hmm...
@ASFried @human_100_emoji @Mikel_Jollett By the same logic, I have "long ties" to Clinton world because after working briefly for Sanders 19 years ago, I worked for a longer time for the Clinton folk at CAP. So...get a better argument.

@Mikel_Jollett Thank you for acknowledging.
Honest question: can anyone substantiate this idea with anything beyond emotions or feelings? Is there any empirical data to support this at all? I'm genuinely asking. https://t.co/2nRYHkpbN5
@Mikel_Jollett Yes, 19 years ago. I was also spokesman for House Dems on the Approps Committee, and then worked for the Clinton folk at CAP.

I'm not asking for a POLITICAL argument ("oh this means he's more electable!") -- I'm asking you to defend the votes on the POLICY merits of the bills he voted for. All the bills are linked in the article. So please use the comments to defend the votes on the policy merits. Go. https://t.co/MWRqflrerI
As you consider this, I would also offer the context that Beto represents one of the most Dem districts in America -- more Democratic than most districts in Massachusetts. So again -- please use the comments to defend these votes on the POLICY merits of the legislation. Go. https://t.co/MWRqflrerI
@amurderofroses This is not an answer to the question. So please try again.
Here's a reaction to my request: "Please defend on policy merits Beto's votes for GOP bills for Trump's deportation force, Wall Street dereg, corp tax cuts &amp; chipping away at the ACA."

#FF -- The Vast Media Cabal Of Journalists Who Sometimes Read Stuff In The Congressional Record And Dare To Report On It: @ebruenig @BMarchetich @alexkotch @matthewwalther @normansolomon @ZaidJilani
Things I learned this week: copying &amp; pasting direct quotes and roll call votes from the Congressional Record and then publishing that information on the Internet can prompt overwrought anger from some people.

Things are going to be intense in the new Dem-controlled House -- and we are fortunate to have lawmakers like this who are going to bring some transparency and a spotlight to the machinations that for too long have occurred in the proverbial smoke-filled room... https://t.co/83vN8ebVa5
@FisherBurton It's not the same thing. It comes from Noam Chomsky. I didn't say I agree with it. However, it made me think. I don't understand how someone who is a professor -- you -- would want people to not even think.
@FisherBurton I really just thought it was an interesting argument, from someone who I deeply respect. It doesn't mean I agree with it. It means I thought it was a thought-provoking piece. Honestly.

@RobDubJ @dcwoodruff @westword 112 may get considered in the legislature or may go back on the ballot in 2020. Hard to know. 74 being defeated prevented a very extreme measure from being put in the constitution. So yeah, I like many across the political spectrum think Colorado is fortunate that it was defeated
A journalist is not someone who reports facts that you like. A journalist is someone who reports facts, whether you like them or not. Trumpism = attempting to de-credential journalists for the alleged crime of reporting inconvenient facts. https://t.co/3E3PPzr0da
@RobDubJ @dcwoodruff @westword They spent about $10 million TO PASS the very extreme Amendment 74, but it was defeated by a grassroots effort and by good accountability journalism. They also simultaneously spent about $40 million to DEFEAT the separate measure 112, and they were successful in defeating 112.
BTW -- @RobDubJ, I gotta log off soon to get some work done &amp; do some family stuff. So if I don't respond, that's why. If you have any other questions, feel free to email me at dsirota@davidsirota.com. Thanks!
The investigative report that @dcwoodruff &amp; I did for @Westword about Amendment 74 &amp; the oil/gas industry was credited with having some big impact on the election. 112 got close but didnt pass because oil/gas spent $40 million against it &amp; proponents had only $1 million. Thanks. https://t.co/aWYse7MKFB
"I'm afraid my candidate can't win an election if too many people actually find out about his voting record" is a hilarious line of thought. In a normal world, the thought should be: "My candidate should build up a good voting record, and that will help him/her win an election."

Scientists say climate change will kill millions. In light of that, ask yourself: is it really not OK to even discuss a Dem 2020 candidate voting to lift the oil export ban while repeatedly breaking his own No Fossil Fuel Money pledge? Really? https://t.co/PYn9487LS7 https://t.co/JAhYpCZHGC
Science tells us that millions of people are gonna die if the next president helps increase fossil fuel exports and helps allow more offshore drilling. But fine go ahead ‚Äî defend Dems who support these things and who rake in big checks from fossil fuel execs.

Dems with ties to oil/gas industry are often defended with ‚Äúoil/gas is powerful in their state so they have to be loyal to oil/gas.‚Äù But if thats true (and I dont think it always is), maybe in the climate change era you dont want an oil-loyal president from one of those states?

I worry theres an effort to move the Overton Window on camp fin reporting ‚Äî an effort to say that if someone doesnt take PAC cash, we cant look at aggregate money (in $1000 or $2700 checks) from donors in the oil/gas industry. In the age of bundling, I just think thats wrong.
I got shit on as a BetoBro for half-seriously suggesting Dems could pick Beto as House Speaker (constitution allows for a non-Member to be speaker). Then I got shit for supposedly being anti-Beto just for looking at his donors in the oil/gas industry. This website is weird.

Speaking only for me, thats not what its about. I report on issues regardless of party -- and my record as a journalist proves that I don't care if my reporting pisses off particular politicians or party operatives. And IMO we need more of that kind of attitude.
I understand that this is hard for political junkies to see and accept -- and so they cast issue-based reporting from folks like me, @ebruenig, @sunraysunray @alexkotch as some sort of secretive political conspiracy for a particular candidate. But...
The crises before us threaten to literally kill hundreds of millions of people. Hence, there are newer voices out there who are focused on scrutinizing candidates on issues, primarily because they CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES, not because they are scheming for a particular candidate.

@xJawz We must look at $2700 donations from individual oil/gas execs. It‚Äôs really that simple. Saying that‚Äôs out of line is climate denial.
As climate change threatens to kill millions of people, I prefer 		A) My favorite 2020 Democrat to win the election even if they are worse than their opponents on climate policy 		B) The candidate with the best climate policy to win, regardless of who that Democratic candidate is
Sorry, but sitting here in a hospital thinking about life &amp; death, I don't have patience for people saying "don't point out fossil fuel donors' campaign cash because it offends my preferred candidate." Climate change threatens to kill us all. We must focus, and be uncompromising. https://t.co/8tnjMRGSmL
@ScottChalleen Also, there were a not insignificant amount of large ($1,000-$2,700) donations from executives. This is why the scrutiny is necessary. Presidents/CEOs of oil conglomerates often aren't giving out of the goodness of their hearts.
@ZenyattaforPres @TopherSpiro Wrong: https://t.co/q7oeWrHhTW
Fighting climate change and exposing fossil fuel industry control over our politics must be a BIGGER priority than any particular candidate you may support. The survival of humanity has to be more important than defending or promoting your preferred political candidate.
@kramericans Absolutely
In short: scrutiny of ALL politicians &amp; ALL kinds of fossil fuel industry donations - PAC, individual, etc. - must be seen as a nonpartisan, non-candidate-specific necessity in the age of climate change. Letting this issue become just more fodder for the candidate wars is not OK.
We must scrutinize all conduits of fossil fuel industry campaign cash. We must do this about all politicians &amp; not respond defensively with "you're just trying to help another candidate!" but respond proactively with "we need to stop a climate crisis threatening all of humanity."

@ScottChalleen That‚Äôs a good argument. I‚Äôm not making a value judgment. But simply mentioning the donations is not an ‚Äúattack.‚Äù
The basis of much campaign finance reporting is looking at aggregated donations from donors in specific industries. This is important in the age of bundled $2700 donations. Claiming any mention of individual donors is an ‚Äúattack‚Äù is an effort to halt campaign finance reporting.
Clinton in 2008 aired ads slamming Obama for accepting cash from donors in the fossil fuel industry: https://t.co/GOP8aNDhT1		The DNC considered rejecting donations above $200 from oil/gas donors. 		Mentioning candidates‚Äô money from fossil fuel industry donors is not an ‚Äúattack.‚Äù https://t.co/lGWBYWsJ9l
Nobody attacked anyone. You are at a think tank funded by a foreign fossil fuel government. Mentioning a source of campaign cash is not an attack, especially in the age of bundling of individual donations. The end. https://t.co/lGWBYWsJ9l

Food for thought: if someone shows you a lawmaker got cash from donors in an industry, ask yourself why you assume those facts are an "attack." Many lawmakers dont see it that way: many actually view cash from donors in an industry as a laudable sign of support from said industry
@MineLilLight @leahmcelrath I implied nothing. The trouble is that people assume a fact is an attack. You should ask yourself: why do you see a fact as an attack? Presumably, many Texas lawmakers actually see getting money from oil/gas industry donors as a positive sign of support from the industry.

@MineLilLight Show me where "wrongdoing" was insinuated. I'll wait.
One other point: Beto getting a large sum of money from donors in the oil/gas industry follows a DNC debate over those exact kind of donations. The idea that such donations now shouldn't even be discussed is ridiculous. https://t.co/HRnicM7rU4 https://t.co/JTZBRVY9zB

This is from a Democratic state legislator. I disagree with @NeeraTanden and her think tank (which has been bankrolled by a foreign fossil-fuel-producing government) that the 2020 Dem primary means we shouldn't even look at donations from the fossil fuel industry. https://t.co/gTVtHhIyBZ
Also, there's Beto's stated support for exporting fossil fuels. We're in a climate emergency that threatens to create a mass extinction. Are we allowed to scrutinize where he might be on these issues? Or is that also somehow too triggering or "divisive"? https://t.co/JoQ7TAPl8v https://t.co/CrCBlzdAmV
Does this mean Beto is evil or more pro-fossil-fuel than the GOP? No. Are individual max donations from top corporate execs worthy of some scrutiny or review, just like they are for GOP politicians? I think so. As a journalist, it's weird to me that anyone would argue otherwise.
Heres an example of why the "they were individual donors so they don't matter!" theory is inane. This is the top exec of a big oil firm maxing out to Beto. Is it notable in the context of Beto's support for the industry during a climate crisis? You decide. https://t.co/0x36Ng0LqW https://t.co/KPXeZkn8cS
It's unclear why posting a link to campaign finance data - and with no judgment - triggers some folks. The point of transparency is to have an informed debate. If particular donations are good with you, great - defend them! But why get so mad about folks even looking at the data?
For those asking, here's a partial list of oil/gas industry donors to Beto O'Rourke. From what I can tell, this appears to represent about half the total money he's received from donors in the industry (am guessing the data isn't updated for all of 2018). https://t.co/Cs3rOqEKw1

Thing is, it would be a lot more healthy if the tiny anti-Bernie group just explicitly made their ideological &amp; transactional case. Just argue against Bernie‚Äôs policy agenda and for the value of the Dem Party establishment that enriches you. That way we can have an honest debate.
The small anti-Bernie crowd changes their argument against him daily (‚Äúhe‚Äôs cult of personality!‚Äù...‚Äùhe‚Äôs ineffective!‚Äù) and don‚Äôt apply those arguments to neolibs. The arguments vary because they don‚Äôt wanna admit their opposition is ideological &amp; crassly transactional.

If you were in a public office, you were given the power to help the fight against climate change, which threatens to kill millions. If you chose not to use that power, everyone who you helped doom to dystopia is not obligated to say 100% nice things about you when you pass away.

I have another radical idea: if you‚Äôre a public official who did nothing to combat climate change when you were warned about it, people aren‚Äôt obligated to say nice stuff about you when you die &amp; humanity is facing the species-threatening consequences of your deliberate inaction.
I have a really radical idea: Groups of human beings grievously harmed by a public official shouldn‚Äôt have to shut up about being harmed when that public official dies.

If there‚Äôs anything to be thankful for in politics, it isnt just that some amorphous blue wave may have temporarily inconvenienced Trump. It‚Äôs that Congress finally has a few folks like @Ocasio2018 @RoKhanna &amp; others who admit the binary choices ‚Äî and seem ready to take a side.
Bezos has to make a less money for Amazon workers to make a living wage. Exxon has to produce less carbon for humans to survive. Corporations have to have less political power for democracy to be real. This isn‚Äôt a theory ‚Äî this is math. We need politicians who finally admit it.
Most politicians promote this fraudulent notion, because to challenge it is to admit that the donor class that bankrolls politicians is in a fight-to-the-death conflict with the rest of society. If you‚Äôre a politician &amp; you admit that taboo truth, your funding gets cut off.
America‚Äôs religion is the belief that we never face binary choices. This religion pretends we can have an economy of both billionaires &amp; equality, an ecosystem of both huge carbon emissions &amp; human survival, and a society of both corporate hegemony &amp; democracy. This is fraud.

@CharlesPPierce @Johngcole @BoggisNews Think we've hit the logical end of the conversation. You are deliberately reducing what I'm saying to absurd arguments that aren't what I'm saying, and you know it. Gotta go -- wife just home from her first legislative retreat. Later.
@CharlesPPierce @Johngcole @BoggisNews Right. And nobody was responsible for Dems losing Congress, the presidency, governorships &amp; legislatures. Hell, nobody was responsible for the Wall Street crisis. Nobody is to blame for anything, ever. That's the culture of America. No one should be held accountable for anything.
@Johngcole @BoggisNews A few others have. I know you haven't. I was just preempting. Alright, gotta go. Wife just got home from her first legislative retreat. Gotta check in with her and then make the kids' lunches.
@Johngcole @BoggisNews I think Pelosi is OK -- unspectacular, and theres a good case that after 16 yrs, Dems need new leaders. Whats problematic are people pretending Pelosi is some amazingly spectacular leader &amp; omitting her record literally losing the House over and over again. Thats some bullshit.
@Johngcole @BoggisNews And if you want to be a horseshit garbage person and claim that me saying that means I somehow agree with the GOP speakers on policy, that's some horseshit garbage, so try to refrain from that.
@Johngcole @BoggisNews That's not the argument. The argument is simple: who got more done for their party &amp; their movements? Nuance it, spin it, argue over which was easier, etc. I'm calling balls &amp; strikes. GOP speakers have gotten way more done for their party/movement than Pelosi has for progs/Dems.
@Johngcole @BoggisNews Maybe Ryan is debatable -- he wasn't there very long but got $2 trillion of tax cuts through, which was a huge win for his party. Hastert &amp; Gingrich together had tax cuts, deregulation, welfare cuts, etc. Incredibly huge impact (that I obviously didn't agree with).
@DoremusJ This is hilariously dishonest. Like, you sat there and thought "how do I literally make up bullshit." Nice work dude.
@BoggisNews Paul Ryan was more effective FOR THE GOP than Nancy Pelosi was effective for the Democrats. Doesn't mean I agree with Ryan's policies. But he was more effective FOR HIS PARTY than Pelosi was for her party. That's exactly right.

@BedfordMassDems @CharlesPPierce Oh I don't AGREE with what the GOP did. I'm saying in terms of MAGNITUDE for their movement/party.
@CharlesPPierce Also not to belabor it, but:		1981: Dem House, 58 GOPers in the Senate, GOP President		2009: Dem House, 60 Dems in the Senate, Dem President		So, '81 doesn't work.
@CharlesPPierce Also, "historic" - 1981 was a QUARTER CENTURY before 2009.
@CharlesPPierce OK, so you're dying on the hill of "59 senate votes wasn't historic." Got it.
GOP started a war based on lies, destroyed civ lib laws &amp; passed trillions &amp; trillions of dollars of tax cuts. Those were far bigger ideological achievements for the conservative movement &amp; GOP than those modest Dem reforms were for the progressive movement &amp; the Dem Party. https://t.co/KmaJE3owld
@RadicalGoats Right, Pelosi is the first Speaker of the House in history who has zero responsibility for failing to actually pass laws and then losing the House for 8 entire years. Good point.
No, you've mischaracterized me. I'm of the school of "if Democrats woulda used historic majorities to do universal healthcare and serious stuff on climate, it might have helped avert dooming my kids to a planet of mass death and dystopia." https://t.co/A57wxyyFxG
I mean, imagine a Dem Speaker who was as effective as one of these GOP monsters were for their own party &amp; movements. A Dem equivalent woulda been Medicare for All, or at least a public option, a larger stimulus, etc. But Dems cant even imagine that, which is part of the problem. https://t.co/vANjBf2HQm
Gingrich, Hastert &amp; Ryan were the most effective speakers for their political movements in my lifetime. Doesn't mean I like or agree with what they did -- but compared to any Dem speaker, they were highly effective FOR their party, their ideology &amp; their constituencies. https://t.co/tXVA2AlKC5
@Loki4Us @CharlesPPierce Newt Gingrich &amp; Dennis Hastert, for their party and their movement. Game over.
It's weird how nobody in the Democratic Party was responsible for Democrats losing the presidency, the House, the Senate, most governorships and most legislatures.
Love you man, but the argument that House leaders have nothing to do with historic House losses is really almost laughable. I know elite politics has become an accountability-free zone where nobody gets held responsible for anything, but the buck has to stop somewhere. https://t.co/xbsIm6AEEE
You can love Pelosi or hate her. I think she's OK. But trying to erase the Pelosi/Hoyer record of losing the House for 8 entire years - and pretending they had nothing to do with that catastrophe - is Orwellian, and an insult to millions who were harmed by those avoidable losses.
@karandikara99 I got it -- Speakers of the House have no responsibility for actually passing laws when their party controls the entire Congress and the presidency. That's a really excellent point.
"Pelosi got modest Romney-style insurance reform, almost nothing on climate, lost the House for 8 yrs, shit on Ocasio-Cortez &amp; represents 16+ yrs of the Dem leadership never changing &amp; thus she must be Speaker again without anyone asking questions," said almost nobody outside DC.
@CharlesPPierce @Ocasio2018 I'm sitting here in all blue Colorado, a formerly GOP stronghold. Tell me again how Tuesday "validated" that bullshit LMFAO
It's weird how we're all expected to forget not only that Pelosi lost the House for 8 years, but also that Pelosi instantly shit on @Ocasio2018 &amp; the progressive movement right after Ocasio's victory. https://t.co/MoFMM0g0a3 https://t.co/Y5syPWyggO
It is weird how Democratic leaders so vociferously campaign on the notion of change, and yet are simultaneously hostile to the notion of even modest changes within their own party.
I know elite politics is an accountability-free zone where everyone at the top gets to shirk responsibility for absolutely everything. But I think when you're House Speaker, and you oversee historic election losses, you bear some basic responsibility. https://t.co/muAZc9hmLO
Hey Tony Stark: by this logic, Pelosi created the messaging that lost the House for 8 yrs, at huge cost to the country &amp; the world. Maybe hashtag #TeamPelosi is right &amp; she's the right choice. But pretending this never happened is like insisting war is peace &amp; freedom is slavery. https://t.co/pZffQjlEAF
