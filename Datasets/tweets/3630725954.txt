It seems obvious that in fact the Mueller Special Council was illegitimately conceived by Comey's leak to his professor friend to instigate the Mueller Investigation.

I think this confirms the total and complete illegitimacy of Mueller's Special Counsel...a Counsel "Born in Betrayal" AND "Conceived in Deceit"!!! Also, did the FBI have any legal right to invade Cohen's Offices in the first place? I seriously doubt it!!! It smacks of Comeyism!!! https://t.co/hPu38UTgxl

Then tonight we see "Comey's Confession" that he managed to sneak in two FBI Officers to Entrap Flynn!!! https://t.co/DJjkADZr1p
I rest my case!	This Mueller/Comey Corruption WILL be exposed  sooner than later! When President Trump justly fired Comey, Mueller begged President Trump to hire him replacing Comey. The President refused and the next day, the Special Counsel began, headed by guess who? Mueller!! https://t.co/DdiN8506Xk
Mr. Schumer you are a disgrace to the U.S.!!

These "Deranged Democrats" are to America what the "Barbarians" were to the FALL OF ROME! We cannot trust them to do what is right for the country they have been busy betraying for decades!!!  These decadent democrat influences must not be allowed to erode what is good &amp; right!!! https://t.co/HNZP5vuG8Y
@Thomas1774Paine @GracefulAmerica Then get ready for "Grave Consequences", because there is a "Red Tidal Wave" about to sweep The House AND The Senate!! This is going to be 2016 all over again and some!!! 		It is 100% thanks to the "Deranged Democrats" wicked behaviour against Justice Kavanaugh and the Caravan!!!
Wow!!! Mr. Obama sure looks foolish here!!! He is without doubt the president that has brought the office of president down to a new low!!! This should not be surprising when one looks at  his crooked campaign to be a senator when he fed off fake voters and violated democracy!!! https://t.co/KcW4l9e5vX
@BlondisCraig @untappd Way to go Craig...üòéüòéüòé
@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer...by now you should be begging the Lord God of Israel to fogive you for all your voluminous and dastardly misrepresentations of President Trump!!! You should be irrevocably ASHAMED of yourself!!!
@realDonaldTrump Amen!!! Hear Hear!!!
Good point Kat! This "is" a planned "invasion" in every sense of the word! I could not believe Obama's pathetic words over the past few days... he was  tongue tied... what a sad figure he has become!!! His true colours are coming out...looks like he is a Black Racist after all!!! https://t.co/9rBOTPFUly
This woman is the most anti-American candidate ever!!! Thank goodness she will be completely drowned out by the gigantic Red Republican Tidal Wave and Martha McSallie!!! https://t.co/TDIk3jkIlR

Wow!!! CNN I will NEVER watch you again until Don Lemon is fired!!! This man has proven himself to be a BLACK RACIST of the same ilk as Mr. Obama's Reverend Wright!!! Lemon has lost all credibility since he has exposed his hatred of white men! He has forfeit his right to report!! https://t.co/DxbU1X14xj
Vote Republican!!! We are expecting a gigantic Mid-Term Red Tidal Wave and this is very encouraging!!! It is also very encouraging to note that the general democratic public are clearly on President Trump's side when it comes to "Common Sense" re: border security and birthright! https://t.co/OVUAk1tLFl
The democrats are to the security of the United States as the Barbarians were to the Fall of the Roman Empire...		...In these clips one can see why these Mid-Terms are going to be a massive Red Tidal Wave of Republican Revival as they keep and expand the House and the Senate!!! https://t.co/PLvhDMaQVj
@BreitbartNews As a Canadian let me assure you Barbara Streisand will not be welcome here...why would anybody want a treasonous entertainer!!!
Wow!!! If the mainstream media continue to ignore these apparently very credible and corroborated rape allegations against Mueller we will know beyond a shadow of doubt from whence they come!!! https://t.co/291IQCC8P7

Mark T Jay you are 100% correct...Barack Hussein (Obama) is most definitely losing it!! Just watch his facial expressions and listen to him stutter and stammer...what has happened to the smug, presidential Obama. He is no more and it is clearly TDS	(Trump Derangement Syndrome)!!! https://t.co/1LiecWm2Ce
Hilary The Hypocrite said, "All black people look alike!!!"..to be totally accurate she said, "They" ... meaning black people "all look alike"!!! The Liberal media gave her a "pass" on this...it is NOT a laughing matter! HILARY CLINTON IS A RACIST! This is worse than "Blackface"! https://t.co/dGcO6EQkd0
@mel_faith1 @PIRATEDANTRAIN Barack Hussein (Obama) was spitting feathers finding words speaking to his pathetic little crowd! I find it repulsive watching this buffoon dragging the Office of President to the lowest levels! He criticizes President Trump and never mentions Holder's plans to kick Republicans!!

This is going to be the biggest, Reddest Republican Tidal Wave in the History of Mid-Terms!!! It is 90% because of the way in which those duplicitous, deceitful and depraved democrats treated Justice Kavanaugh!!		Real Americans will never abandon innocent 'til proven otherwise!!! https://t.co/pUDskUPkgB

@ChuckCallesto Is Maxine Waters Kamala Harris' sister? The barbaric 	anger and curled up lips makes her look and sound just like Maxine Waters!!! Surely both of these American detractors ought to be ashamed of their incessant acts of betrayal against the country that has helped them thus far!!!
@ChuckCallesto Wow!!! Where was this noble aspiration when Kamala Harris was part of the Democratic Inquisition and attempt to destroy Justice Kavanaugh??? No wonder "Harris" and "Hypocrite" both start with "H"!!!
@HuffPost If it is true that a Jewish Group is telling the President to stay away from Pittsburgh then it must be a very and jaded Jewish group because the entire state of Israel in general and the Prime Minister of Israel in particular are grateful indeed for all President Trump does!!!

@NevadaJack2 @Number1Bitch65 What an obtuse and Duplicitous Democrat! Hilary just doesn't even remotely even begin to get it!!! Rather sad really! I wonder why nobody seems to remember the atrocities she and her hubby committed during the "White Watergate" episodes!!! Then there's the 33,000 destroyed texts!
@marklevinshow @PIRATEDANTRAIN This woman needs to  examine her feeble-minded attempts to grasp reality!!! How could anybody with even the basic rudiments of education ever make the obtuse and totally myopic statements about the great state of Israel?

@WayneDupreeShow This is not only plausible but it makes a lot of sense!!!

@ABC Hear Hear!!!
@michellemalkin @p8treeit @BarackObama Oh Dear...Mr. Obama, you definitely need to give your head a shake!

@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer, have a word about this with your friend Eric Holder who wants to kick Republicans!	I just heard this hypocrite who was the first Attorney General to be found in contempt daring to criticize others for being un-American when he is in fact the most un-American of all!!
@BillOReilly @TerriSFnative The democrat's insidious designs will fail again as they did when they tried so hard to frame Justice Kavanaugh!		I find it interesting that Corey Booker now has an inkling of what he put Justice Kavanaugh through!!!

@SenGillibrand Don't tell me this "Demonic Democrat" Ms Gillibrand is actually purporting to care about people...after her hate-filled rant against Justice Kavanaugh!!! America cannot afford to have such an unthinking air-head in the U.S. Senate!!!
@RealJamesWoods @washtee I agree with you James Wood!!! This is a time to gently demonstrate to Mrs. Hilary Clinton that civility triumphs over her calls for violence and those of Waters, and the previous democratic Attorney General et al...also, that shoe that was thrown at her was far too expensive!!!!
@JYANate @Netwatcher1 @tashamarie2469 @SenBlumenthal This is the truth!!! This man dares to denigrate Justice Kavanaugh with such a disgusting democratic record of duplicity, deceit and pure unadulterated depravity!!! Mr. Blumenthal you need to repent, recant and resign!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mr. Schumer... Ms Hirono has told you to "Shut Up" I don't think you should, but you should stop speaking falsehoods!!! You are a Jew and as such you should respect The Lord God of Israel especially when he commands us not to bear False Witness!!! You need to repent and recant!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Can this Hypocritical Hillary really expect that there can be ANY credibility to ANYTHING she ever says!!!	I honestly could not believe she could be so duplicitous and deceitful!!! Even regular democrats are appalled at the behaviour of the democrats on the Judiciary Counsel!!!

@washingtonpost How can the BLIND lead the BLIND???!!! Taylor Swift can't even find her own way so how can she lead anyone??? Her ridiculous words about Marsha Blackburn will only help Marsha to do even better in a political race Marsha is destined to win anyway!!!

@ConservaMomUSA @TomArnold Very well said...I watched the debacle and could not believe what I was hearing and seeing ... there is no doubr Tom Arnold has serious psychiatric issues!!!
@taradublinrocks @PamCouch87 @kathygriffin Well said  Brit!!! This Tara appears to be even more obtuse than Kathy Lee and that obtusity plus!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Absolutely NOT ... in my view Hirono should be immediately ejected from the Senate!!! I can honestly say I find it impossible to imagine that any educated person could ever bring themseves to vote for such an obtuse ignoramus!!! She is a blight on humanity and feminism!!!
@DjLots3 @Diannedorsey14 @POTUS Amen Amen and Forever Amen!!!
@FDRLST @SebGorka Hear Hear!!!
@politico The former dean at Yale is a blight on that august body and should be permanently branded a disgrace to the human race and a blight on humanity! Let him be forever known as the spineless coward that had the gaul to berate the truly AMAZING Brett Kavanaugh!!! A better man by far!!
@seanhannity Hallelujah!!!
@BreitbartNews Kamala Harris has just torpedoed her political career!!! This is a good thing for America!!!
@brithume @USANEWS007 This is preposterous! I just heard another depraved democrat, Brian Schatz spewing this odious codswallop about His Honour Judge Kavanaugh not having the right temperament!!!  How would he and other duplicitous democrats feel if they were anonymously accused of such evil crimes?!
@ShannonBream Kudos to Kristy Swanson who makes complete sense!!!
@BreitbartNews @Roger_Clinton1 Sarah Silverman is one sick puppy!!!
@KamalaHarris Wow!!! Kamala Harris you have certainly lost your way!!!
@ananavarro Sadly Anna Navaro you have lost all credibility ... when you were a real Republican your comments were almost revered ... unfortunately not so anymore ... in fact the one word used to refer to you now, is "pitiful"!!!
@politico Of course he did not lie but this guy Chris Coons of Delaware on TV now as I Tweet is one of the slimiest senators in the history of the USA!!! He and his new found little "Flakey" buddie are looking more and more like Tweedledum and Tweedledee than ever!!!
@WayneDupreeShow This deplorable democrat Chris Britt can repent and recant of his despicable cartoon mocking Judge Kavanaugh's younger  daughter,  he will assuredly burn in hell for all eternity!!! How tragic that there are human beings that are so myopic they become subhuman like Chris Britt!!!
@BreitbartNews Ellison is correct!!! His girlfriend has lots of corroborating evidence and Ford has none!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Flake and Coons have become Tweedledum and Tweedledee!!! In fact Flake appears to be Coons Dummy!!! Perhaps Coons is a Ventriloquist!!! Every time Flake spoke Coons lips were moving!!!
@ronniecwright @LindseyGrahamSC @JenniferHorn @larryelder @RealCandaceO @DiamondandSilk @SheriffClarke @AnnCoulter Hear Hear!!!
@KatrinaPierson @88_Charlotte_88 I  agree Katrina!!	I just watched Flake and Coons "cutely" side by side (aka Tweedledum and Tweedledee) I think we have a classic case of ventriloquism here!!! Am not sure who is the dummy here but Coons right hand was at Flake's back and whenever Flake spoke Coon's lips moved!!!
@agreee2disagree @Chris11962 @KimStrassel It speaks to Feinstein's "Fiendish Plot" to hijack the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh at the last minute! What a huge disappointment she is!!! However, given her decades of betraying America to China one can hardly be surprised!!! It is a good thing she has shown her true colours!
@SenGillibrand What a sad and sordid person you must be Ms Gillibrand!! As I hear you shrieking in your shrill voice like the Witch of Endor verbally trampling over all those righteous principles our veterans fought against Hitler for!!! Not the least of which is the presumption of innocence!!!
@ChuckCallesto @KCGCLCBC Wow!!! Feinstein should have the spelling of her name changed to "Fiendstein"!!! Only a true FIEND would do what she has done!!! The dictionary definition of "fiend" says it all..	"devil, demon and evil spirit"	...after her recent behaviours she qualifies for all three.!!!

His "Simpleton's Smile" says it all!!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @WhoopiGoldberg @TheView @ABC Well said Donald Trump Jr. You have certainly put that arrogant, duplicitous, deceitful and depraved democrat in her place!!!

@President1Trump @JohnBucanis @CoryBooker Look, it's that Booker Buffoon again...the same dirty little duplicitous, deceitful and depraved democrat who appears proud that as a teenager he groped and sexually molested young girls!!!

@AmyMek @RodStryker These wicked bullying aggressors are in danger of eternal hellfire and damnation if they do not repent, recant and "beg" forgiveness of those they are assaulting!!!

@FoxNews @maziehirono Hirono has disqualified herself as a "thinking human being"!!! She is a deceitful, duplicitous, depraved and destructive democrat and deserves to be as discredited as she is being discredited all around the world!!! In my opinion this woman is a total disgrace to the human race!!
@GOPChairwoman @rx2net Flake is a "flake" in action and in name ... Warren is just a flake!!!
The entire "Thinking World Populus" supports this truly AMAZING human being!!! He is without doubt a "Living Saint"!!! His myopic, duplicitous, deceitful and depraved democrat adversaries will be democratically defeated in the upcoming Mid-Terms!!! https://t.co/K2eTzzYdqN

He also thinks that it was okay for him to grope women through their clothing when he was 15 as long as he doesn't think so now!

@KyleKashuv @RepMaxineWaters @FBI Maxine Waters needs to be held criminally accountable for her duplicity, deceit and democratic depravity!!!
@IngrahamAngle @budillona Matt Stoller is obviously the racist here!!!
@realDailyWire Whitehouse is truly a depraved democrat that is so duplicitous and deceitful he really does not seem to be able to detect his own political myopia and has lost his moral compass!!!
@ananavarro Anna Navarro you should realize that after your democratic deceit, duplicity and depravity nobody could ever rely on a single word you ever say!!! May God Almighty have mercy on your tortured soul!!!
@gqforbes4 @CindyBP Debra Katz is disqualified to have anything to do with this case!!! She is a well known anti-Trump activist!!! I rest my case!!!
@carriesheffield @AccuracyInMedia @CNN @AnaCabrera @gusportela Carrie Sheffield, I just watched your interview on CNN and am most impressed!!!

@larks237 @Laurabellee63 @SenGillibrand So do I, and thank goodness most "thinking Americans" incuding most ordinary democrat American citizens feel the same way...Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed and rightly so!!!
@scbradley2 What a pitiful man ... how remarkable a man with a last name Flake could live up to it in this way!!!
@larks237 @Laurabellee63 @SenGillibrand Gillibrand is beyond the pale!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Hirono and Alyssa Milano are totally blinded to their own myopia on the subject of "False Allegations"...just because they have emotional issues they must remember... innocent until proven guilty!!! I have heard that Alyssa Milano has sexually abused little boys!!! Has she???????
@KevinJacksonTBS @MarionMarb Obtusity, intransigence, ignorance and bigotry characterizes this Hirono Twit!!! What a "Loser"!!!
@smalltownandrew @POTUS Doug Jones is a Deceitful, Duplicitous and Depraved Democratic Dog! What else would you expect from someone so devoid of ANY moral worth! However, the good news is that GOOD has overcome evil and His Honour Judge Kavanaugh WILL be confirmed and Republicans will win the Mid-Terms!
@IngrahamAngle @LoseyLaurice @Yahoo Congratulations to the "Boo -ers"!!! They got it right!!!:)
@washingtonpost Absolutely NOT!!! Not only will he be confirmed but he has triumphed in bringing balance between the "MeToo" movement and the presumption of innocence!!!	CONGRATULATIONS Judge Kavanaugh!!! You are "The Game-Challenger!!!
@katiet121 Pure EVIL...these two women's souls are in mortal danger...they need to beg forgiveness from their Creator before it is too late!	The upside however is that this wickedness is so obvious  it will cause a RED TIDAL WAVE in the Mid-Terms!!! Never  has such evil been so obvious!!!!!
@Education4Libs Well spoken Education4Libs	...how grateful I am that you obviously see through the Booker, Blumenthal Buffoons and all the Duplicitous, Deceitful and Depraved Democrats like Cagey Coons, Horrific Hirono, Horrible Harris, Filthy Feinstein &amp; Wicked Whitehouse to name just a few!!!!
@thehill Kimmel is one of the most duplicitous, deceitful, and depraved  human beings alive today!!! His pathetically perverted insistence on televising two young female victims and  forcing them to feel up his track pants to see what they can find speaks volumes!!! He is disqualified!!!

@politico Good news!!!
@BreitbartNews This Hirono woman has completely disqualified herself from ever adjudicating cases involving men!!! What a poor excuse for a human being she is!!! I cannot believe she could ever have had the academic prowess to become a Judge!!! She is a disgrace to the entire human race!!!
@BreitbartNews She is not an American!!! She can't be!!! No American could or would behave this way!!!
@seanmdav @VictoriaQWeaver Well said Sean!!! Now ... as I Tweet, we have that Spartacus Clown Booker speaking his duplicitous, deceitful and depraved democratic claptrap!!! May the Lord God of Israel help us all!!!
@BreitbartNews Mr Coons must shed tears (and many of them).. He is the most duplicitous, deceitful and dishonourable democrat dogs that cannot stop howling like a pack of ravenous wolves deprived of their prey! As I watch, I cannot believe this man can lie with a straight face!!! He is sick!!!
@Golfinggary5222 @smalltownandrew I could not agree more and now we have a Ms Klobuchar who is talking the democratic deceitful, duplicitous claptrap in spite of the obvious TRUTH that came out yesterday! She is still squealing like a stuck pig about an FBI investigation!!! She and her colleagues are a disgrace!!
@slothman_crime @KatiePavlich You can't be serious!!!
@kevinjosephkane @KatiePavlich What planet are you on???
@tman1112000 @KatiePavlich Good point!!!
@ZBeraty @KatiePavlich Hear Hear!!!
@KatiePavlich Well said Katie!!! Whitehouse has just proven himself to be the most deceitful, depraved and duplicitous democrat I have ever had the displeasure of listening to!!!
@seanhannity They are showing their true clours!!! And now this Sheldon Whitehouse is speaking more codswallop than I have ever heard in my life talking about "credible" allegations that have been categorically debunked! Whirehouse is futilely trying to pull a Lindsay Graham!!! What an idiot!
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC You are a great American Lindsey Graham!!!
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham is to be congratulated!!! Now we have the Disgusting Dick Durban speaking his deceitful, duplicitous democratic descent into pure unadulterated depravity!!!	May The Lord God of Israel have some mercy on his democratically depleted soul!!! He is willfully perjured!!
@LadyRedWave @vauxhall23 Wow!!! It looks like Blumenthal, Harris and Hirono are the new version of "The Three Stooges"!!!
@DineshDSouza @Chris11962 Hear Hear Dinesh!!!
@RiegerReport @Woohoo487 Let me say again, without evasion or equivocation  of any kind that Senator Lindsay Graham is a National American hero!! Watching Harris, Hirono and the other Depraved Democratic Dogs I am now utterly convinced that the Republicans WILL WIN the Mid-Terms thanks largely to them!!!
@CNBC An utterly ridiculous motion from an utterly ridiculous democratic senator!!!
@yaf @KCGCLCBC @michaeljknowles @realDailyWire @benshapiro Absolutely!!!
@AnnaApp91838450 @smalltownandrew Hear Hear!!!
@grizzlemeister @smalltownandrew Amen!!!

@CBSNews Congratulations to Senator Flake!!!
@NancyKelso @PA4TAXPAYERS @FoxBusiness @SenFeinstein Great reply Nancy!!! You are 100% on target!!!üòéüòéüòé
@N91TR @PA4TAXPAYERS @FoxBusiness @SenFeinstein Hear hear...they ALL, especially Feinstein need to go!!!
@BreitbartNews What a load of claptrap and codswallop!!!
@RealKyleMorris Lindsay Graham is a National Hero!!! This is a man who exudes decency, integrity and all that is good in America!!! This is the antithesis of Dianne Feinstein who is speaking now!!! Her new name should be "Dianne The Depraved, Deceitful and Duplicitously Demented Democrat!!!
@KatiePavlich And so he should!!!
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @chickybird949 @AnthonyRizzuto9 Oh where oh where can that little lamb be???
@BranHarper @Roger_Clinton1 @CoryBooker @PeterRiddle Indeed...as far as Booker is concerned...never in the field of democratic duplicity, deceit and Spartacus Stupidity has there ever been a more "Sneaky Senator" with a more hypocritical, hateful and fraudulent approach to such proceedings!!! He needs to lose his seat!!!
@seanhannity Hear Hear!!!
@SenFeinstein YOU Senator Feinstein are "THE BOTTOM LINE!" I never thought anyone could sink as low as you have done!!! Your Democratic Dupllicity, Deceit and Depravity in these proceedings is unmatched in the history of such political evils!!! You DESERVE to lose your seat in these Mid-Terms!
@nancylee2016 @PamCouch87 @BreitbartNews Does Gillibrand really think anyone could care about the thoughts of such a depraved, duplicitous and deceitful democrat as her??????
@HuffPost Those Twitter users WILL surely "BURN IN HELL" if in fact they have stated that there is a special place in hell for Senator Lindsay Graham for standing up against the "DESPICABLE DEMOCRAT ACTIONS" to try to FRAME AN INNOCENT MAN!!!
@HuffPost You are a National hero my friend!!!
@thehill I agree 100%! I said it earlier and will say it again... this "Blethering Blumenthal" is  the slimiest, snake of a human being ever to darken the face of the earth! After his unconscionable words against Judge Kavanaugh he should try to slither under the rock from whence he came!
@HuffPost What are you trying to suggest Huffington Post???
@Jamierodr10 @JohnBucanis Amen!!! Hallelujah!!!
@treniatoday @Cernovich You are 100% correct Trenia!	Be assured the two monsters that did this to you will NOT escape the Judgement of  God Almighty!!!
@JFNYC1 @Cernovich Superb!!!96% in favour of Judge Kavanaugh says it all!!! Hallelujah!!! üòéüòéüòé
@DougJones Wow! Doug Jones you are devoid of any moral worth and have branded yourself a truly despicable human being! People as morally bankrupt as you, Dick Durban et al are truly to be pitied above all men!!! You deserve to be held in utter and complete contempt for the rest of your life
@gspatton007 @RitaEsterRocks Anonymous is another word for "Coward"!!!
Hear Hear!!!
@darrylwolk Thank you Darryl...you too my friend!!!üòéüòéüòé
@americamag @Lawrence America Magazine you are sick and deserve to go out of business unless you repent and recant of such stupidity!!!
@politico Codswallop!!!
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsay Graham is truly a National Hero!!!üòéüòéüòé
@CBSNews Yes, but one, Ford was clearly a victim of "False Memory Syndrome" and was caught in multiple lies including her purported fear of flying!! She not only flew in for the hearing but has been flying all over the world for years!! She even flew to that hypocritical Hirono's Hawaii!!
@C_3C_3 @RitaEsterRocks Hear Hear!!! Well said!!!üòé
@Lrihendry @Diannedorsey14 She is sadly a deceitful liar! She said she had a phobia of flying and yet is a world traveler by air and flew in for her appearance! She couldn't even remember if she had shown her notes to the newspapers a few days ago?? How could she ever remember what happened 40 years ago!!!
@StefanMolyneux Mr. Colbert...You used to be respectable and a clever comedian! Look at you now! Your ratings are lower than ever and you deserve to decrease in ever-diminishing circles like the Woga Woga Bird until you disappear!!! You are a buffoon and for sure you will receive due recompense!
@Poruje @Terrilapointe48 She truly exposed herself as a "False Witness" of the highest order!! I wonder why nobody exposed that she was one of the most outspoken anti-Trumpers along with her wickedly conniving and impious lawyers!!! It turns out she has absolutely no phobia re: flying!!! She is a LIAR!!!
@Golfinggary5222 @JohnBucanis Hallelujah Amen!!!
@Slate The only dodges and deceptions came from Schumer's Shameful Democratic Dogs full of Duplicityand Deceit!!!Amen!!!
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @IngrahamAngle Hear Hear!!!
@PDeplorablegirl @RodStryker @Alyssa_Milano @KamalaHarris You speak well!	The dems need to beg God's forgiveness! The day is coming soon when these impious democrats will face "The Judge" of all Judges!!! Should they not do the above they need to know they are bearing False Witness and will be in danger Hell Fire and Eternal Damnation!!
@RichLowry Amen!!!
@Jamierodr10 @JohnBucanis Wow!!! Jamie you are not myopic!!! You are blind!!!
@SenSchumer Wow!!! Mr. Schumer you are behaving like an EVIL man!!! You need to get on your knees, repent, recant and beg The Lord God of Israel to forgive you of your wickedness!!! This needs to be done by the rest of your democrat dogs or you are all in danger of Hell Fire and Damnation!!!
@BreitbartNews It is shocking that nobody has mentioned the fact that Ford has been an outspoken "Anti-Trump" activist along with her two vehemently "Anti-Trump" activist lawyers!Why has nobody  questioned the obfuscated therapist's reports screaming "False Memory Syndrome"! This is criminal!!!
@USA4TRUMP @gatewaypundit Now Blumenthal ... who is without doubt the slimiest snake in human form that I have ever seen...I believe he should be immediately drummed out of any position of governmental responsibility since he has unequivocally thrown his full weight behind  Ford's uncorroborated claims!!!
@washingtonpost Now we have Mr. Coons!!! What an absolutely shocking thing it is that these democrats are behaving like a howling pack of deceitful, duplicitous dogs with only ONE purpose, to denigrate and destroy this innocent man Brett Kavanaugh!!! Vincit Veritas...Truth conquers all!!!
@thehill Oh boy on top of Buffoon Blumenthal we have "Bungling Booker" with hypocritical hype and his usual "tripe"!Again, their impious and deceitful, democratic codswallop is obvious to all Americans!	Thank God these democratic attack dogs are helping the public to see through it all!!!
@IngrahamAngle @KCGCLCBC @SenFeinstein This Hypocritical Hirono is currently talking ... she is the anithesis of everything that is American!!! How did she ever get into any position of authority??? Thank goodness the American people are able to see through anyone that condemns one entire group out of hand!!!
@FoxNews @SenBlumenthal How can anyone ever believe Blumenthal the Buffoon???
@washingtonpost Blumenthal the Buffoon is one of the  most duplicitous, deceitful and demonic democrats I have ever seen!!!
@politico Thank God Almighty that even my democratic friends are seeing through this woman's lunacy!!! I am feeling more confident than ever, that the truth is coming out finally and my main question here is what can be done to prevent such travesties of justice in future??? What a fiasco!
@SenSchumer Oh boy!!! Now that Buffoon Blumenthal is interjecting even more codswallop!!! Wow!!! How did this slippery,slimey excuse for a human being ever make it to senatorial status???We can only pray that somehow the Lord God of Israel can have a semblance of mercy on his insidious soul!
@SenSchumer If Mr. Schumer has any integrity he will call off his democratic dogs like Mr. Coons (who is currently interrupting the hearing with one load of codswallop after another) and ask them to repent &amp; recant of this insidious, unconsionable impious intent to frame an innocent man!!!!!
@SenSchumer The only apology owed is a Schumer apology to Judge Kavanaugh for propagating such a load of pure unadulterated codswallop!!!
@greta Absolutely not!!! Judge Kavanaugh must be confirmed!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Kristy Setzer has just been interviewed by Tucker Carlson, as Tammy Bruce says it was shocking! Obviously Setzer is a female fascist and wants to abandon English Law in favour of French Law ie "Guilty until proven innocent!" What a myopic and dangerous person, pray for her soul!!
@SenSchumer What a load of codswallop! Chuck Schumer knows full well that this entire fiasco is nothing more than a wicked political plot riddled with duplicitous democratic deceit that will only help Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation! It will ensure a big Republican victory in the Mid-Terms!!!
@mitchellvii Avenatti is a sorry sight these days!!!üòéüòéüòé
@FoxNews These are democrat hypocrites!!!
@kathym4321 @88_Charlotte_88 This is very good news!!! Ford needs to be criminally charged when all is said and done!!!
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @RepMaxineWaters @SenFeinstein Well said!!!
@Genie115 @HelloTeamTrump @LouDobbs @seanhannity @Varneyco Avenatti is the best thing that ever happened to the Republications....thanks to him, Ford, Hironi, Bai, Anna Marie Cox, Gillibrand, Whitehouse, Blumenthal and Warren (to name a few deranged democrats) the Republicans will win a landslide victory in the upcoming Mid-Terms!!!üòéüòé
@maggieNYT @MarionMarb Hear Hear!!! Very well said!!!
@1bigbeer @NoraWhi1 Excellent point! I am appalled to hear Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Blumenthal, Sheldon Whitehouse and Elizabeth Warren kissing their brains goodbye!!! Gillibrand actually went on television and stated, "I believe her because she's telling the truth!" Talk about codswallop!!
@MooiachiRios Shocking!!! It is good that this is being exposed!!!
@smalltownandrew Hear Hear!!!
@Franklin_Graham @vauxhall23 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @mike_pence Amen!!!
@HeyTammyBruce @Chr1sle1ner @SenFeinstein Wow!!! Tammy Bruce you have knocked it out of the ball park!!! Congratulations!!!
@Bobsbaby4061 @DonaldJTrumpJr You can't be serious!! Although we have come to see that democrats will stoop to any level to advance their democratically deceitful agenda! However, their unconscionable behaviour is plainly obvious to all Americans! This will ensure a "Red Wave" that will annihilate the blue!!!
@stopthenutjob @DonaldJTrumpJr Demented!!!
@ShannonBream This entire fiasco is a "no brainer"!!! Ms Ford first allowed nebulosities to arise in a therapist session in 2012 with not even a hint of Judge Kavanaugh's name!! The evidence of Ford and her lawyer's political war on President Trump is overwhelming...this is criminal behaviour!
@JeffFlake Well that is encouraging!!!
@marklevinshow Hear Hear!!!
@cristinalaila1 @JacobAWohl Hear Hear...then there is Feinstein's lawyer Neil Quinter who just said that only democrats are anxious to expose sexual assaults against women!!! Why is he not concerned about Ellison??? What a duplicitous democrat!!!
@BreitbartNews MSNBC needs to fire Donny Doutsch! He has a Nazi background!!! Has he forgotten the democrats birthed the KKK? How can he forget that he is not only a white man but he appears to have a history of "White Supremecist" thinking! He is a discredit to MSNBC &amp; the USA and a hypocrite!
@DrMartyFox @Diannedorsey14 @realDonaldTrump That is because Brennan is fearful that he will be exposed in his incessant attempts to undermine the USA!!! This goes right back to the 1980's when he voted for Gus Hall (an avowed communist that dreampt of and called for slitting the throats of Christians!!!) He is a traitor!!!
@mitchellvii Absolutely!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Terrilapointe48 This should open the eyes of ALL Americans!! Blumenthal, Feinstein and their democrat cohorts are guilty of a heinous crime, that of collaborating to make "False" allegations against a completely innocent man!!! They don't seem to want to even countenance False Memory Syndrome!!!
@marklevinshow @PamCouch87 Hear Hear!!!
@heatherjones333 Ms Ford's lawyers have already declared their intention to prevent Judge Kavanagh's confirmation by hook or by crook!!! Looks like they attempting both!!!
@JeffFlake Mr. Flake:	You can see this is a ploy by the democrats, cruelly using this obviously emotionally disturbed Ms Ford for their clearly impious and very dark political agenda!!! Her therapist may have made her a False Memory Syndrome victim, criminally raising false allegations!!!!!
@ChuckGrassley Mr. Grassley, you have been patient enough. You must no longer let the tail wag the dog!The vast majority of Americans (over 75%) have seen right through this demonic democrat's deceitful misuse of an obviously mentally disturbed accuser!!! I believe you will win a Monday Vote!!!
@smalltownandrew Hear Hear!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr It is obvious that Ms Ford is not well mentally!!! The dregs of evidence to date are tainted by the manner in which they were coaxed out of her by a therapist that clearly is part of that "False Memory Syndrome"!!! Why can't these demented democrats wake up and embrace the truth?
@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer you cannot be serious!!! You and your democratic cohorts have taken hypocrisy to an ALL TIME LOW!!! Have any of you  tried to put yourself into Judge Kavanaugh's shoes? Ms Ford increasingly looks like she is guilty of one of the most heinous of crimes "False Witness"!
@PeteHegseth @RodStryker Sen. Hirono is a disgrace to America!!!
@StopTrump2020 @pkthornton1 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely NOT!!! Kirsten Gillibrand will lose her seat in the Senate for exposing her "Legal Illiteracy"!!! This combined with her obvious obtusity and total disregard for the "Presumption of Innocence" will be her downfall!!! Mazie Hirono is just as bad!!! Vincit Veritas!!!Amen
@DonaldJTrumpJr @USANEWS007 Ellison's accuser is a million times more credible than this Christine Ford!!! Why this "Democratic Double Standard"???
@ChrisCuomo @SallyDeal4 What a load of democratic codswallop!!!
@SallyDeal4 Nobody can believe Christine Ford! Not only is the timing screaming "scam", but democrats are showing their true colours!!! They are demonstrating that they are devoid of all moral worth!!! Thanks to this obvious evil, Republicans will counter with a landslide in the Mid-Terms!!!
@RedNationRising @NoraWhi1 @TheDemocrats Well done Kamala Harris!!!
@kernelofwisdom @AnnCoulter @DRUDGE Hear Hear!!!
@BlondisCraig @untappd Congratulations Craig!!!
@senorrinhatch Hear Hear!!!
@BreitbartNews What else would one expect from such a myopically biased democratic senator Coons...we need to pray for this poor depraved fellow!!!
@thehill This fiasco is a pathetic attempt by the democrats to destroy Judge Kavanaugh!!! The truth will win and I believe Christine Ford will be charged also her therapist and her lawyer!!! This is a "False Memory Syndrome" fiasco and all participants need to be held legally accountable!
@DiamondandSilk Hear Hear Diamond and Silk!!!
@JeffFlake Wow!!! Jeff Flake is living up to his name again, again and again!!! He is the "Flake" of ALL Flakes!!!
@SenSchumer You are a hypocrite Mr. Schumer!!!	Why did you lead the charge to silence the Bill Clinton rape victims and yet you want to give credence to this obvious ploy by Christine Ford??? Contrary to your ridiculous assertions, Ford's claims are entirely unfounded!!! She must be charged!
@heatherjones333 @PamCouch87 Absolutely!!! Hear Hear!!!
@VoteMarsha @MarionMarb @realDonaldTrump Hear Hear!!!
@seanhannity Wow!!! Maxine Waters is completely unhinged!!!
@ananavarro Ana...you are missing the point completely!!! But then what else would one expect?
@ctsvgirl @ShellyLBell @FoxNews @seanhannity Very true! Hear Hear!!	Kudos to Lindsay Graham!!! Our prayers are with Judge Kavanaugh and his family and I am confident the TRUTH will emerge  strongly!!! It is my sincere hope that this sick woman will be criminally charged and get the psychiatric help she desperately needs!!!
@senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley How can anyone respect Democrats again after dirty tricks culminating in utterly contrived allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh by a Ms Ford who appears to be a victim of a contrived "False Memory Syndrome" in 2012 when she did not and could not identify the two purported people!!!!
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC Excellent!!!
@smalltownandrew @ShellyLBell Hear Hear!!!
@RepAdamSchiff @ProudResister Mr. Schiff you need to really take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you can repent, recant and try to take your vows to serve the American people with integrity seriously for a change!!!
@SenWarren Ms Warren...have you not taken time to evaluate any of this??? Of course not!!! You are part of this ridiculous show of shameful tactics to try "AT ALL COSTS" to derail the nomination of a truly amazing Christian gentleman by the name of Judge Kavanaugh!!! The timing is criminal!
@Jali_Cat @MarionMarb @LindseyGrahamSC @HouseJudiciary @HouseJudDems @GOPChairwoman @lisamurkowski That explains everything!!! What a wicked ploy by Christine Ford and the Democratic Party!!! This has to be the most unconscionable political dirty trick in the history of political dirty tricks!!! This woman needs to repent, recant and beg Judge Kavanaugh's forgiveness!!!
@hrtablaze @MarionMarb Mr. Biden is deluded!!! Pray for this feeble-minded Democratic Dingbat!!!
@RealJamesWoods Christine Ford has been mentally unstable for decades &amp; should be ashamed of herself!!! These vexatious allegations with such impious timing must be discounted!! Furthermore, they come out of the notorious "False Memory Syndrome" 8 short years ago without any identities divilged.
@mitchellvii It is utterly shocking that this obviously mentally unstable accuser failed to identify the two purported assailants in what was clearly a "False Memory Syndrome" report prompted by this purported therapist 8 years ago!!! These "Desperate Democrats" are depraved! Pray for them!!
@PeterSweden7 @p8treeit The evil actions of these Islamic Sex Grooming   Gangsters protected by "Political Correctness" clearly calls for a return to the death penalty for such unconscionable wickedness against an innocent 15 year old girl who suffered repeated rape &amp; 8 forced abortions for 8 years!!!!!
@washingtonpost This is utterly and completely repugnant to anyone with any sense of decency at all!!! If this woman never even thought of anything connected to Judge Kavanaugh until some therapist evoked this "False Memory Syndrome" in 2012, then it is pure hogwash!!! It is a wicked "Demoploy"!
@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer is a foolish man and seems to have completely lost his mind!!!
@Newsweek Nobody cares what Mr. Kerry says!!!
@LouDobbs @SidneyPowell1 Hear Hear!!!
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Hear Hear!!! However, as I texted to Mr. Obama, he is President Trump's best weapon...the more he opens his lying lips the better for the President!!! Nobody is fooled by Mr. Obama's repeated misrepresentations and he is the best guarantee that Republicans will win the Mid-Terms!
@newtgingrich @PamCouch87 Hear Hear!!!
@KimStrassel @PamCouch87 @SenBooker Well said!!!
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Amen!!!
@Patrici15767099 @RodStryker Obama myopically neglects to notice how divisive he has been since Day One!!!
@RodStryker His middle name is "Judas"!!!
@dbongino @PamCouch87 Hear Hear!!!
@TwitchyTeam @PamCouch87 Moore is a disgrace to the human race!!!
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Hear Hear!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Hear Hear!!!
@realDonaldTrump Woodward is mentally deranged!!!
@ChuckGrassley @PamCouch87 Absolutely!!!
@LoriinUtah @whoknowsnohow I couldn't agree more!!!
@marcorubio Hear Hear!!!
@D_Alex_connect @CindyBP What a classic "Chump"!!!
@IvankaTrump Great stuff!!!
@SandraTXAS @PamCouch87 And Booker is a "Patsy"!!!
@BreitbartNews Don't forget...Rob Reiner is a "Meathead"... Archie Bunker had it right all along!!!üòéüòéüòé
@BarackObama Barack Obama...your are a disgrace to the office of the president of the United States of America. As a Kenyan Canadian I am ashamed to think you could have any connection to Kenya!!! Keep up your insidious ways you are president Trump's best weapon against the Demoncrats!üòé üòéüòé
@FoxNews @BarackObama Thank goodness the American people are able to see through this Obama codswallop!!! I do hope he continues to speak...he is without doubt the most valuable asset to the Republicans and to president Trump as the mid-terms approach!!! The tiny audience   hearing him speaks volumes!
@ananavarro Anna Navarro needs to get out of political commentary!!!	She is perhaps the most wishy washy, vacillating commentator I have ever heard!!!
@FoxNews @BarackObama Wow!!! I can't believe my ears!!! Obama is trying to take credit for the current "Trump" boom in the American economy!!! He is a LIAR!!! While I text, he is still polluting the air waves right now as he gives one of the most divisive and hypocritical speeches I have ever heard!!!
@ABC Wow!!! Mr. Obama has brought presidential ethical behaviour to an all time low by bad-mouthing a sitting president!!! What a shame he seems incapable of following the dignified example of his predecessor George W. Bush who had way more ammunition against him and never used it!!!
@realDonaldTrump @RitaEsterRocks NIKE now stands for:		N...No	I.....Inspirational	K....Knowledge to offer	E....Ever again
@ABC Mr. Obama needs to stop his divisiveness and start speaking about "Making America Great" Again!!!
@realDailyWire This is par for the course with Booker!!!
@CTVNews Mr. Obama needs to remember he is a "Past President"!!!
@BreitbartNews Cher needs to stick to singing!!! Nobody has any interest in her mindless ranting and raving!!!
@BreitbartNews The only wounded animal is Brennan himself!!! Fortunately he has lost ALL credibility with the American people and so he is no danger to anyone but himself!!! We should pray for this man who voted for the communist Gus Hall who called for the slitting of all Christian's throats!
@SenWarren @fred_guttenberg @NRA This is another seriously insidious misrepresentation by the deceitful Demoncrats!!!	I watched the exact footage of the encounter and Mr. Guttenberg approached Mr. Kavanaugh unexpectedly from a side angle and Secret Service moved him forward preventing what may have an assault!!
@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer surely you should be ashamed of this total misrepresentation...	...you know and most Americans know that Mr. Kavanaugh has released more documents than ANY other nominee for this position!!! Why do YOU and your fellow Demos keep insidiously lying to the Americans?????
@BreitbartNews Bernstein is a master of disseminating "claptrap"!!!
@TimRunsHisMouth Personally I believe this is a pure unadulterated hoax!!! It clearly demonstrates that President Trump has been right all along!!! The fact that any newspaper would stoop to the level of even remotely countenancing publishing an "anonymous" piece of claptrap is disturbing!!!
@JudicialWatch Keep up the excellent work!!!
@FRIFFY @88_Charlotte_88 I totally agree!!! Now another obfuscating, misrepresenting and duplicitous democrat by the name of Kamala Harris is spinning her slimy and deceitful soliloquy against Judge Kavanaugh!!! What an absolute farce democrats are making out of this process that is meant to be dignified
@chuckwoolery Pretending is the key word!!!
@GOP @vauxhall23 Hear Hear!!!
@bud_cann @ShellyLBell Hear Hear!!!
@CBSNews What??? This is ridiculous "hearsay"!!! And what does it have to do with the price of eggs???
@GOP Judge Kavanaugh should be and will be confirmed!!!
@FoxNews @PiperPerabo What is wrong with you Piper Perabo???
@GOP @SteveDaines Hear Hear!!! And now we have yet another democratic dingbat by the name of Cory Booker speaking absolute drivel and literally wasting time with nothing but a bunch of babbled claptrap!!! Mr. Booker needs to learn to put his mind into gear before he opens his mouth!!! Shame on him
@FoxNews Good work...the Democrats appear to have no level to which they will not stop!!! Now we have another democratic dingbat attacking Kavanaugh in the person of Richard Blumenthal!!! This democratic deceit takes on new pathetic pathways of stupidity with Blumenthal's Bletherings!!!
@FoxNews I am listening to Christopher Coons giving his confused, obfuscated and dithering rebuke of Judge Kavanaugh with the serious misrepresentations one has come to expect from Democrats!!! Thank goodness Chuck Grassley is now setting Mr. Coons straight!!! Well done Mr. Grassley!!!
@SenSchumer Mr. Schumer you are such a Twit!!! Now I am listening to another Twit...a Mr. Whitehouse who is babbling at Justice Kavanaugh with some of the most ridiculous statements ever uttered by a purportedly educated human being!!! His name should be changed from Whitehouse to Outhouse!!
@Redtowel4 @PamCouch87 Michael Avannatti should have a psychiatric examination ASAP!!!
@washingtonpost Let me reiterate...The Mueller/Comey/Rosenstein and 15 Democrat Team Members of the "Witch Hunt" against president Trump must be held accountable for their pathetic one-sidedness!	Kimberley Strassel's book "The Intimidation Game" tells all!!!
@washingtonpost Mueller and Comey have such a history of corrupt collusion together (check out the phenomenal irrefutable details put forth by Steve Hilton's "Next Revolution" on Fox!!!) Surely these two clowns and remaining 15 Democrat Dingbats on the Mueller Team must be held accountable??????
@washingtonpost This is beneath the dignity of any newspaper...especially the Washington Post!!! Shame Shame Shame!!!
@JudicialWatch Hear hear!!!
@thehill What a load of codswallop!!! The Hill and The Washington Post are now notorious for issuing "fake" poll results that seem to be geared to influencing public opinion!!!  Benjamin Disraeli wisely warned us that there are lies, dammed lies and worst of all there are statistics!!!
@ananavarro Anna Navaro, your shocking vacillations and obfuscated arguments should surely disqualify you from making any plausible comments ever again!!!
@JudicialWatch Well done Judicial Watch!!! You are to be commended for taking this action to hold Maxine Waters accountable for her deplorable behaviour inciting unwitting Democrats to anarchy and violence against fellow Americans!!!
@Petermathers5 Congratulations Peter!!! Without doubt you are one of the most talented guitarists in the world!!! Very well done indeed!!! üòéüòéüòé
@FoxNews Amen!!!
@realDonaldTrump @nepafortrump Fantastic!!!
@MAGANinaJo @PamCouch87 It is an absolute disgrace!!!
@DineshDSouza O dear Dinesh!!! Is it possible you were looking in the mirror when you issued this tweet??? It sure seems like it...you poor misguided myopic fellow!!! Lol!!!üòé
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Hear Hear!!!
@BreitbartNews Chuck Schumer really debased himself by blatantly lying to the Senate today! At the same time he utterly embarrassed himself and the entire democratic party by exposing his complete lack of understanding as to how the American Judicial System actually works!!! Time to put USA #1!
@realBlackDon @LoseyLaurice You Sir are speaking more truth than perhaps anybody could ever realize!!! Well done!!!
@TheOfficerTatum @PamCouch87 @realDonaldTrump Indeed and thanks to Steve Hilton, Peter Schweizer has exposed Hunter Biden's hugely corrupt dealings with Ukrainian oligarch's and communist  China aided by his daddy Joe!!! Thank you for facilitating this and the shocking exposure of colluded corruption between Mueller &amp; Comey!
@greta @PamCouch87 Why always so negative?
@JackPosobiec Who are you???
@RudyGiuliani Hear Hear!!!
@therealroseanne @LoseyLaurice Count on our prayers at:	https://t.co/oRKxFYZMQx
@JMReflectionsof @ShellyLBell You are 100% correct!!!
@jdawsey1 @blakehounshell I applaud the president's focus on condolences to the family!!!
@ananavarro Ana Navarro you need to get back to being the kind of great voice you once were for the Republican Party!!!
@LouDobbs @POTUS Hear Hear Lou Dobbs you speak the TRUTH!!!
@SebGorka @RodStryker This "Illegal Alien" has no right to "demand" anything!!! He is a sub-human demonic monster and he will assuredly suffer eternal damnation in the bowels of hell. Dante's Inferno is a picnic compared to his suffering once he has been exterminated like the utter vermin he is!!!
@slacker_ga @RodStryker @POTUS Hear Hear!!!
@LauraLoomer @p8treeit I agree Laura!!! This young lady's blood is screaming for justice!!! Our prayers are with her family!!! Thankfully she is now in Heaven!!! Surely this sub-human demon-possessed fiend needs to be quickly put to death as painfully as possible!!! The death penalty "IS" a deterrent!!
@marie5483 @DJTrump2016 @realDonaldTrump With the greatest of respect Karen you really need to take note of the even greater financial crimes committed by Mueller and Comey!!! What a shock Democrats are going to get when the tables are turned and the cosy Comey/Mueller collusion is exposed and they are finally indicted
@CBSNews Mr. Trump has spoken the truth about the South African Dictator who should be crowned Mugabe The Second!!! What kind of evil carries out such dastardly crimes against South African Farmers because their skin is white??? Be assured there is a special place in hell for such people!
@LynnePatton @Chr1sle1ner @JackPosobiec @TrumpStudents @Cernovich @DiamondandSilk @KatyTurNBC @weijia @HallieJackson @kwelkernbc @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr The American Legal System must be transformed into a "System of Justice"!!! Mueller and his cronies need to be held accountable for their obvious disregard for true justice!!! Comey and Mueller are definitely more guilty than Cohen and Manafort combined!!! Mueller is a hypocrite!
@SaraCarterDC Absolutely Sara!!! I believe that far greater crimes have been and are being committed by Mueller and Comey!!! Steve of "The Next Revolution" has overwhelming evidence that these two are irrefutably guilty of so many acts of corruption it makes Manifort and Cohen look Saintly!!!
@TheNoahRing @vauxhall23 Wow!!! Elizabeth Warren got it totally wrong!!!
@TomFitton @LoseyLaurice @realDonaldTrump What a farce Mueller and Comey are making out of the Legal System in America!!! Hilary Clinton's transgressions make Cohen and Manifort look like "Living Saints"!!!
Mueller needs to be locked up along with his partner in crime Comey!!! https://t.co/zruXpqbQMh
@LisaSmith4680 @p8treeit You are 100% correct Lisa Smith!!!
@MittRomney Good grief Mitt...you cannot be serious!!! What about Hilary Clinton's deliberately erased 33,000 e-mails!!! Her culpability in the horrendous trail of blood during White Watergate just to name two out of dozens and dozens of documented criminal activity and corruption!!!????????
@DanRather @DJTrump2016 So what???
@AnnCoulter @FreeWhiteMale I wholeheartedly agree!!! I also am totally shocked that the American justice system would allow the illegal raid on Mr. Cohen's offices to go unchallenged!!! This, combined with the Mueller/ Comey collusion and the 13 Democratic stooges out to get president Trump is preposterous
@SenSchumer Why would anybody pay attention to Mr. Schumer? Without evasion, equivocation or mental reservation this person is perhaps one of the most myopic people in the entire western hemisphere!!!
@GOP Come on CNN...you can do much better!!! It is the "sacred duty" of all news outlets to be "Fair and Balanced"... the sooner you can start this the better your ratings will become!!! The best advice I can give is to suggest that you get your staff to begin watching Fox News!!! üòé
@Franklin_Graham Hear Hear!!! üòéüòéüòé
@BreitbartNews Methinks Jim Acosta "Protesteth Too Much!!!"
@HuffPostPol Mr. Acosta can't be serious!!! This is a time for him to look at that "Man In The Mirror" and ask that man if he is being "Fair and Balanced". To understand the meaning of being "Fair and Balanced" and how to implement this aspect of imparting news he needs to watch Fox News!!!

I just watched an interview with Democratic Congressman Swalwell on  Neil Cavuto!!! Wow!!! This guy could not give a straight answer to any question!!! As far as this ridiculous Meuller Charade is concerned, it looks like he along most dems has already swallowed the coolade!!!!!!
@BreitbartNews Don't worry Maxine Waters...the Dems will NOT take back the House!!!
@BreitbartNews Jimmy Kimmel is without doubt one of the most unfortunate specimens of humankind!!! He needs to try to burst out of his myopic little fantasy world and attempt no matter how feebly to be a decent human being! His wicked comments cause me concern for the well-being of his wife!!!
@dcexaminer @Diannedorsey14 What a foolish store!!!üòé
@washingtonpost Come on Washinton Post...	You can do better than this!!!
@BreitbartNews What a strange and unpatriotic thing to do!!!üòé
@BreitbartNews In this article Maxine Waters describes herself as a wounded animal!!! Perhaps this is the most accurate description she has ever made of herself!!! Perhaps in defence of wounded animals, they at least appear to be able to maintain at least some semblance of dignity!!!üòéüòéüòé
@realDonaldTrump @farmwife24 Don't worry!!! The "Demoncrats" are doomed to failure at every level and it is primarily due to their incessant inability to put America and Americans first!!! They, along with John Brennan are the the ones that are guilty of "Treason"!!! Real Americans are definitely not fooled!
@BreitbartNews Johnny Depp and his cohorts with their childish antics are actually driving voters in droves to becoming supporters of Donald Trump!!! Keep it up Johnny it is thanks to you and those of your ilk that Donald Trump will win another landslide victory in the next elections!!!üòéüòéüòé
@ReneGlloq @HuffPostPol Hey Rene, try to remember the impotance of the words of St. Francis when he said,"Oh Lord help me not so much seek to be understood as to understand"!!! If you can do this Rene, I truly believe it may assist you in dealing with what may well be a case of "Political Myopia"!!!
@KittyLovesGod Absolutely Kitty!!! Well spoken!!!üòéüòéüòé
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Judge Jeanine you are without doubt a modern hero!!! I already tweeted that you "Whupped Whoopee" the other day on "The View"!!! Your interaction with Ms Goldberg (the Ms stands for 'Miserable" by the way!!!) gave birth to these nicknames: "Whoopee The Witch" and Jeanine The Just
@TimsterKelly 	Hey Tim:	How are you? Great memories of Roy H. Crosby!!!	When you have a moment give me a quick call at (289) 221-2687		Sincerely,	Dorian Baxter :)
No wonder the Democratics are promoting those disgusting T-Shirts encouraging "lynching" again!!! After all, it was the Democrats who gave birth to the 'Klu Klux Klan"!!! Shame Shame Shame!!! If there is any sanity left in the "Left" I would encourage them to try to use it!!!!!!!
@BreitbartNews We need to arrange for this Judge to be banned from the bench!!! England Oh England!!! How art the mighty fallen!!! Tommy Robinson is a hero!!! Wake up from "Thy Slumber" Oh Mighty One!!! 'Lest Thou shalt become a "Toothless Bulldog"!!! Rise up, rid Thyself of such legal tyranny!
@BreitbartNews It's Maddow who is beginning to sound like a Foreign Agent and on closer inspection she actually looks like one!!!
@WayneDupreeShow Goldberg demonstrated her complete and utter lack of class!!! As I said earlier, Whooppee got "Whupped" by the Judge!!! Next time she has the privilege of being on stage with Justice Pirro she should limit herself to singing,"Here Comes Da Judge!!!" Lol!!! Lighten up Whooppee :)
Rosenstein and Mueller appear to be in cahoots re: the timing of the 12 Russian inditements to coincide with the Trump Putin Summit!!! Although Bob Goodlate is generous in his wording when he says,"It was curious timing". In my view it was much worse than that! Truth will emerge!
@TheCraftyColey @rayfineburg1 @pahubb43 Hear hear!!! I agree wholeheartedly!!! I tweeted last night that all my colleagues agree with me that Whooppee got a Whupping from Justice Jeanine and she graciously gave the View a much needed different point of VIEW!!!üòé
Interesting that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have always criticized Donald Trump's elaborate lifestyle while they have just spent $8.1 Million buying their Kilorama Rental!!!???
@Sheckyi @sunnykcollins Hear hear!!!
@FoxNews What an unfortunate situation when respectable American citizens allow themselves to behave like Barbarians!!! Come on you Maxine Waters supporters you can do better than this!!! I just know you can!!! You are not Deplorables so you should try not to behave like Deplorables!!!
@Petermathers5 Way to go Peter!!!
@Thomas1774Paine @NoraWhi1 I watched that clip of The View and Justice Jeanine "Whupped Whoopee"!!!
@Real_PeachyKeen @PamCouch87 They already have!!!
@HuffPostPol I was amazed to take note of the Rosenstein/Mueller failed stunt intended to impact the Trump/Putin Summit by releasing the names of the 12 purported Russian inditees when they did!!! It is time for  democrats and perpetrators of "Fake News" to repent, recant and republicanize!!
@thehill Mueller and his gaggle of democratic geese will find out in the end that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander!!! I often wonder how these coniving con artists can sleep at night!!! What a travesty!!!
It is utterly shocking to see the betrayal of the American people by the democratic party!!! People like Congresswoman Jackie Spear of California is only the tip of the deceitful democratic iceberg!!! This is not surprising from the party that gave birth to the Klu Klux Klan!!!
@RandPaul @NoraWhi1 @TuckerCarlson Hear hear!!!
@RodStryker @PamCouch87 Hear Hear!!!
@DonnaWR8 @PamCouch87 @TuckerCarlson What a stench in the nostrils of Almighty God!!!
@FoxNews @SecPompeo @foxnewsnight Amen Amen and Amen!!!
@YoungDems4Trump Hear Hear!!!
@BreitbartNews It looks like Whoppee Goldberg got a whupping from Justice Jeanine!!! And it is long overdue!!! Whooppee you need to know that you are coming across as a "Know It All" and it is NOT pleasant to watch this when it is further obfuscated by such nasty facial contortions!!!
@BreitbartNews Christian Slater should watch his mouth or change his "Christian Name" from Christian Slater to 	"Foul-mouthed Slater"	...what a shame someone who I used to respect has revealed himself to be a shallow name-calling twit!!!	Come on "Slater" surely you can do better than this!!!
@BreitbartNews Arnold Schwartznegger should take pill and have a nap!!! Seriously!!!
@RedNationRising @Dobba2Dobbs I strongly agree (like 100%)!!!
@IvankaTrump @WSJ Hear Hear!!!
@C_3C_3 @NoraWhi1 This says it all...well done!!!
@LauraLoomer @NoraWhi1 Well said!!!
@ChatByCC @NoraWhi1 Hear Hear!!!
@Slate Wow!!! Houston...we have a problem!!! What a ridiculous thing to say!!! Surely nobody in their right mind would even contemplate tweeting such drivel!!!
@Slate What a load of codswallop!!!
@FoxNews @Comey Comey &amp; his bedfellow Mueller are hollow shells "ectomorphs" of human beings and they should both realize that their disgraceful behaviour and betrayal of America has forever disqualified them from ever being taken seriously by anybody ever again!!! They need professional help!!!
@BreitbartNews This is most unfortunate..	Neil is usually more level-headed!!!
@BreitbartNews What a silly thing to say!!!
@BreitbartNews I used to respect Neil Cavuto	...what happened Neil???
@USAHotLips Lou Dobbs is 100% correct:)
@mitchellvii I wholeheartedly concur!!! Mueller and Rosenstein amaze me in that they are so obtuse they don't seem to realize that the American people can see right through their sick Comey/Strzok delusional collusion!!!
@politico Wow Politico!!! You amaze me by your relative obtusity and absolutely catastrophic inability to comprehend the big picture!!! How can you remotely compare Pearl Harbour and 911 to this hocus pocus drivel that is   pouring out of the mouths of the Mueller, Comey, Strzok Fiasco???
@thehill You can't blame him for resigning....it must be shocking even for him as head of the FBI to hear Rosenstein's ludicrous reports today!!!
@RL9631 @toninospontell1 Robert De Niro has proven himself to be a political embarrassment to all civilized and thinking human beings!!! I used to have great respect and admiration for him as a movie star and now I cannot repeat his name without feeling an unbridled sense of pure, unadulterated nausea!!!
@guardian Wow!!! Even the Guardian is "off the wall"!!!
@Real_PeachyKeen @toninospontell1 John Brennan is sooo off base!!! It is beyond shocking!
@FoxNews @SenSchumer Schumer's new name should be:		"Shameful Schumer"!!!
@politico He is 100% correct!!!
@washingtonpost Come on Washington Post you can do better!!! This is just a load of codswallop!!!
@politico Nobody can blame president Trump for his sentiments when one looks at the pathetic attempts by the Mueller probe to negatively impact the summit with these toothless inditements especially in the shadow of FBI leadership's blatant attempts to undermine president Trump's campaign!
@RealCandaceO @CindyBP Hear Hear Candace!!!
@BreitbartNews We do need to keep Mr. McCain in our prayers!!!
@RandPaul @NoraWhi1 Senator Rand Paul speaks the truth!!! I also believe president Trump was able to literally and figuratively "trump" the obfuscated press inuendos during today's summit by raising the issue of the "missing servers", Hilary's missing 33,000 e-mails and the Comey/Mueller collusion!!
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Hear Hear!!!
@FoxNews Oh dear!!! Hilary Clinton is at it again ... surely even the democrats can see that it is time for an "intervention"!!!
@BreitbartNews What a shame Archie Bunker isn't here to remind Rob Reiner that he is proving that Archie was right all along...	...Rob Reiner should legally change his name to "Meathead"!!!

@BreitbartNews Well...it looks like Archie Bunker got Rob Reiner's real name right when he referred to him as "Meat Head"!!! Come on Gloria and Edith help the poor boy...he always listened to you two!!! üòéüòéüòé
@FoxNews Whatever happened to rational responses, civilized and reasoned thought patterns??? Come on you democrats...you can do better than this!!! üòé

@BreitbartNews Khera is completely out to lunch and his purported grounds for objecting to Kavanaugh's appointment are nothing but "hogwash"!!!

@thehill Hear Hear!!!
@washingtonpost My goodness.!!! You people at the Washington Post need to get over yourselves!!!
@CNNPolitics The Mueller team and Mueller himself ought to be in jail NOT Paul Manafort!!! Come on America you must not tolerate this kind of unbelievable violation of basic human rights!!! Remember "innocent until proven guilty"!!! You must hold Mueller and his pathetic team accountable!!!!!
@mike_pence Cynthia Nixon should be ashamed of herself!!!
@elizabethforma @SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump I suggest you remember what your friend Barack was doing to separate children from their mamas and pappas for 8 years without even checking to see if they were being trafficked!!!

@Denarae11 @perryTheDad @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Hear Hear!!! üòéüòéüòé
@FoxNews Keep up the excellent work Mr. Nunes!!!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Mueller is fast becoming an abomination to the concept of American Justice!!! As the Founding National Chairman of NAPPA (The National Association for Public and Private Accountability) Canada, I urge Americans to call on the powers that be to expose the "Comey/Mueller Collusion!
@FoxNews This is preposterous...	this gentleman had every right to protect himself when he was attacked by three males who were purportedly protected by being labelled juveniles!!! It has been said that sometimes "The Law Is An Ass"...this is such a case!!!
@marklevinshow Great work Mark Levin!!!üòé
@JudicialWatch Congratulations to Judicial Watch on filing your "righteous" complaint against Maxine Waters' unconscionable words and actions inciting violence against those who are simply exercising their own "God-given" right to have an opinion!!!
@politico I will say it again...this time in response to @politico Michael Avannatti is obviously in need of some form of psychiatric assistance!!!
@BreitbartNews Michael Avannatti (Stormy Daniels lawyer) is obviously in need of psychiatric counselling!!!
@BreitbartNews These people are deranged in their myopia!!! They are "demoncratically" barking up the wrong tree!!! In so doing they are ensuring the demise of the "Demoncratic Party!!!"
@washingtonpost @PostEverything Wow!!! What a bunch of "Hogwash!!!"
@thehill What a wicked woman!!! May God Almighty have mercy on this wicked woman's soul!!! Surely a transgression of this magnitude (destroying such a rare and magnificent species of giraffe) puts her in danger of hellfire and eternal damnation!!! Pray that she can adequately repent!!!
@John_KissMyBot Count on my prayers!!!
@BreitbartNews Surely Michelle Wolfe should be immediately removed from her purported position as  Talk Show Host!!! She gives new meaning to the word "DEPRAVITY"!!!
Wow!!! Michelle Wolfe and Maxine Waters have taken humanity to an all time low!!!
@mikebwonder Hear hear!!!
@CBSNews Trey Gowdy speaks the truth!!!
@JudicialWatch Way to go Judicial Watch!!!
@AndreaVoyt @cspan @Jim_Jordan Andrea that is not at all fair!! Jim Jordan has every right to be upset with Rosenstein who has blatantly ignored repeated requests for disclosure!!! Surely you could see through the complete and utter arrogance displayed by Mr. Rosenstein!!! This is the real bully not Jim Jordan
@FoxNews @SenSchumer Mr. Schumer it must be very difficult for you to continue to mislead people ... your repeated vascillations and blatant misrepresentations are catching up with you!!!	Time to repent, recant and seek absolution!!!
@kathygriffin Wow!!! Kathy Giffin you have already disqualified yourself from being an authentic member of the human race!!! I would suggest you slither back under the rock from whence you came and understand that nobody wants to hear your opinions on anything ever again!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hear hear!!! It also looks like Fallon, Colbert and Conan O'Brian have become the new "THREE STOOGES"...	Never before in the field of human entertainment has so much ignorance and stupidity been poured into so few!!!üòé

@thehill What didn't he do???
@realDonaldTrump There is no doubt the democrats have totally lost their minds!!! Surely their new name "demoncrats" clearly         "demon"strates from whence they are derived!!! Without doubt they are your greatest asset!!! Americans are not fooled by this preposterous Mueller farce!!! üòéüòéüòé

@thehill Does the Hill really think anyone cares about what this woman says??? She loses credibility every time she opens her mouth!!! Tsk!!
@thehill Benjamin Disraeli said,"There are lies, damned lies and then there are statistics!!!" These polls are as reliable as the Democrats!
@PatLiverman just saw this thanks for engaging ... I guess we can agree to disagree on this one!!! I suspect you have "Alternate Facts":)üëçüòáüôè
@PatLiverman thanks for engaging on this Pat...Benjamin Disraeli said,"There lies, damned lies and worst of all statistics! I rest my case!!
@thehill These are depraved subhuman entities!!!
@CNN These polls are as Fake as the "Fake News" CNN propagates so profusely!!!
@SallyDeal4 O dear Sally....	you may be a victim of the Democrat tendency to propagate "Fake News"!!!
@politico Here we go again!!!  You "Politico People" are getting good at propagating "Fake News"!!! Tsk Tsk Tsk!!!
@washingtonpost What kind of a newspaper would allow such a childish headline???
@thehill Truly, these criminal imbeciles are the "deplorables" Hilary spoke about!!! We need to pray they are delivered from their depravity
@AP this is bizarre since there never was a "Travel Ban" per se!!! Rather it was, is and ever shall be "Extreme Vetting" &amp; surely warranted
@thehill Schumer has absolutely no credibility!!!
@thehill hogwash!!!
@thehill I thought The Hill had repented of their propensity to print "Fake News!!!"!!!
@thehill there appears to be a "streak" of "mooning madness" ... I never, ever believed Democrats and Liberals could be such moronic losers!
@thehill Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli got it right when he said,"There are lies, damned lies and then there are statistics &amp; polls!!!"üëç
@thehill Too little too late!!!
@thehill Why would anybody listen to a raving maniac like Howard Stern!!! Surely Howard can't imagine that anybody would take him seriously!
@thehill What a mouth, What a mouth, What a North and South!!! Blimey What A Mouth She's Got!!!" Elizabeth Warren needs to be more lady-like
@thehill this is ridiculous!!! As Benjamin Disraeli reminded us: "There are lies, there are damned lies and then there are dishonest polls!"
@realDonaldTrump this is true!!!
@thehill Michael Moore is a twit!!!
@CNN Obama's reforms included last minute pardons  for hundreds of heinous criminals committing heinous crimes against innocent Americans!!!
@FoxNews Obama should be ashamed of himself!!! The only force he has used is Air"force" One &amp; he used that improperly campaigning V's Trump!
@SallyDeal4 President Trump had no choiceüëç
@CNN üëçüëçüëç

@NBCNews Foolish Democrats!!!
@washingtonpost President Trump will stand on guard for Ukraine!!!
@CNN Hear Hear!!!
@washingtonpost Wow!!! I am losing respect for this newspaper...what's with this sudden obsession with "Fake News" and "Alternative Facts"??
@CNN She couldn't be more wrong!!!
@WSJ What a bunch of "Losers"!!! Literally!!!
@thehill Not very nice vocabulary!!! Naughty, naughty and actually quite nasty little Democrats!!! Tsk Tsk Tsk!!!
@SallyDeal4 @thehill Thanks for kindly taking the time to comment Sally!!! I do sincerely appreciate thisüëçüôè
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Hear Hear!!!üëçüòáüôè
@thehill What a mouth...What a mouth, what a North and South...Blimey what a mouth she's got!!!
@CBSNews have they forgotten Genesis 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man , by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in His own image
@NBCNews Successüëçüòáüôè
@jstorres Great choiceüëçüëçüëç
@CNN What a load of "cods wallop!!!"
@thehill Somebody should help Nancy to understand the difference between a "Travel Ban" and "Extreme Vetting"!!!
@WSJ Secretary Kelly speaks wiselyüëçüòáüôè
@CNN Nancy was totally unable to answer this gentleman's question...sadly it really does appear that the Democrats are totally awash! Tragic
@JustinTrudeau What are you thinking Justin??? Of course we must be as charitable as we can but surely "Charity Begins At Home"!!! Surely???
@CNN I am watching Nancy and she really is demonstrating total and complete inability to actually "answer the question"!!! How embarrassing!
@thehill Hear Hear!!! It would also be much better if "The Hill" and the rest of The  Media would stop misrepresenting this as a Travel Ban!
@FoxNews Oh Dear!!! It looks like the Democrats have forgotten the meaning of Democracy!!! I never dreamed I would ever see such sour grapes
@thehill That is just another piece of "Fake News!!!"
@HuffPostPol What "Hogwash!!!"
@CNN Did they forget, George Washington won the War of Independence???
@nytimes Come on Barack!You can do better...I was born in Kenya and our first president Jomo Kenyatta taught us "Harambee" (pull together!!)
@HuffingtonPost Two very strange ducks!!! They keep "ducking" the real issues!!! Whatever happened to "United We Stand???"
@nytopinion Is this supposed to be funny??? Wow!!! NYT what has happened to your integrity and level of maturity??? Gone With The Wind!!!???
@NYTNational Is that surprising?
@HuffingtonPost What a strange comment...I wonder what he is thinking???
@WSJ surely the Ex-President is not in favour of anarchy and insurgency??? Or is he???
@thehill Wow!!! Is Mr. Obama guilty of aiding and abetting anarchy? Is he guilty of encouraging insurrection? Looks like it! Disappointing!!
@PatLiverman with  the greatest of respected will have to simply agree to disagree...it would appear that you may have "Alternative Facts':)
@nytimes Not Islam!!!!! Radical Islam!!!!
@kylejpeterson This is wonderful newsüëçüòáüôè
@FoxNews Absolutely!!! This should not take a "Rocket Scientist" to figure out!!! Those with nothing to hide have nothing to worry about!!!
@CNN Some tweets are fighting CNN duplicity!!! Now that Hilary is gone CNN "Clinton News Network" needs another acronym!!! DNN "Deceptive.."
@politico which polls??? Disraeli had it right...there are lies, damned lies and then there are "polls" and "statistics"!!! Facts not polls!
@washingtonpost perhaps Keith should remember the USA believes in Democracy as opposed to Anarchy!!! Perhaps this includes the Democrats!!!üëç
@nytimes What is with you people at the New York Times? I used to respect you! You have become like a dog with a bone!!! Get over yourselves
@tkibble hear hearüëç
@FoxNews I am grateful that Sean Hannity is "Fair and Balanced" but whatever is wrong with Shepard Smith...what is his problem with Mr Trump
@thehill why is the Liberal Press forgetting the "Alternative Facts" Hilary et al produced around Benghazi, White Watergate and myriads more
@CNN finally someone is going to do somethingüëçüôè
@FoxNews this clearly makes Obama and his Democratic cohorts responsible for any deaths that may occur as a direct result!!! Unbelievable!!!
@CNN Now that really is a "Low Blow"...SNL has crossed the line...an apology is required and if repentance is adequate, absolution follows:)
@thehill and he is 100% correct üëç
@thehill Benjamin Disraeli spoke the truth:"There are lies...there are damned lies and the THERE ARE STATISTICS!!!" What about some polls!!?
@CNN Wow!!! CNN how low can you go??? Just watched Jake Tapper on "The Lead"!!! Does he not realize CNN started the crowd controversy???!!!
@CBSNews He has called it right...very well done!!! There is no doubt this guy is good on his feet!!!üëçüëçüëç
@FoxNews  Sean Spicer is finding the right balance between being accountable to the Press and simply asking  they reciprocate!!! Good stuffüëç
@thehill Hear Hear!!! It is always good when "Truth" is establishedüëçüòáüôè
@CNN This is "Good News"üëç
@FoxNews Sean Spicer is doing a fantastic job in his first Press Briefing!!! Surely this bodes very well for the Trump Presidency!!!üëç
@MMFlint am wondering if you are as disappointed as I am with the recent "Bad Behaviour" of the Democratic Party? Surely this is deplorable!
@SheldonKagan Congratulations!!!üëçüòáüôè
