@DGrant39107133 @hrkbenowen Trump is dominating the polls, no question, which is what we said. We report on all of those polls...

@JamilleHawkins Haha, not that I've been told. But I'm flattered by the suggestion. Thank you!
@GregsBMC @mite72 True, polls vary a lot. In latest Quinnipiac poll, Cruz is 4 pts behind Trump, nearly within the poll's margin of error.
@DGrant39107133 @hrkbenowen In ystrday's Quinnipiac poll, Cruz was 4 pts behind Trump, which is nearly writhing the poll's margin of error.

DA added that Oklahoma has no terrorism statutes on books, so if any terrorism links do come up they'd be pursued on federal level.#FoxNews
Answering why Nolen wasn't being charged w/ terrorism, DA said they've turned over that side of the investigation to the FBI. #FoxNews
DA will meet w/ victim's family over next couple of days &amp; will determine whether or not to seek death penalty in beheading case. #FoxNews
Other co-workers attempted to stop the attacks by throwing chairs &amp; trying to kick Nolen off of his victims during the attacks. #FoxNews
Nolen was stopped from beheading 2nd victim by COO, who fired 3 shots w/ rifle, hitting him once through the arm &amp; into abdomen. #FoxNews
Co-workers told police Nolen was yelling Arabic phrases during the attacks, in which he beheaded 1 woman, &amp; brutally stabbed a 2nd. #FoxNews
Nolen later told police he would've beheaded her too if he hadn't been stopped. #FoxNews
His 2nd victim, Tori Johnson, was 1 of those 3 coworkers he wanted to get. #FoxNews
He then went home &amp; retrieved a knife to get back at 3 coworkers in particular whom he felt were responsible for his suspension. #FoxNews
Beheading suspect Nolen was suspended Thursday after several confrontations w/ co-workers about how he didn't like white people. #FoxNews
Affidavit details events leading up to beheading...
Alton Nolen is charged in beheading case w/ 1st degree murder, Assault &amp; Battery w/ deadly weapon, &amp; Assault w/ deadly Weapon. #FoxNews
Lots of new informational Oklahoma beheading case from presser w/ Cleveland Cnty DA Greg Mashburn. #FoxNews
Alton Nolen remains in hospital, but police are told he should be released by tomorrow. He'll then be taken to Oklahoma Cnty jail. #FoxNews
If charged w/ 1st-degree murder, as is expected, OK's sentencing options are death penalty, life w/out parole, &amp; life w/ parole. #FoxNews
That detail is significant because pre-meditation is a key part of what's needed to seek Death Penalty in Oklahoma. #FoxNews
PD initially believed Nolen never left Vaughn Foods &amp; began attacking co-workers immediately after being fired. #FoxNews
Alton Nolen went home after being fired, retrieved knife, &amp; then went back to Vaughn Foods to attack co-workers. #FoxNews
Decision to seek death penalty comes after pd learned more pre-meditation was involved that originally thought...
Sources tell me DA expected to seek death penalty in OK beheading case, w/ charges of 1st-degree murder &amp; assault w/deadly weapon. #FoxNews

@DonBlais85 Thanks, Donald! Glad to be back in town.
@kenzeyg823 Violence has been a constant issue in Chicago for close to the last 100 yrs, but especially since the race riots of the '60s.
McCarthy:(Will Springfield strengthen gun laws?) I just refuse to believe we're going to allow this kind of violence to continue.
McCarthy: Violence is concentrated on south side for many reasons: poverty, education, gang violence, &amp; deterioration of the family unit.
McCarthy: And we're up 46 shooting incidents this year compared to same point last year.
McCarthy: We're down 11 murders so far this year compared to same point last year (Down to 185 from 196).
McCarthy: Criminal justice in Illinois isn't devised to punish gun possession. I'm still waiting for that change to come from Springfield.
McCarthy: Possession of an illegal firearm isn't even considered a violent felony in Illinois. That needs to change.
McCarthy: 8 incidents over the holiday weekend of CPD officers discharging their firearms or having firearms discharged at them.
McCarthy: When we chased people in NY, they threw away their guns, when we chase people here in Chicago they turns their firearms on police.
McCarthy: Something different about NY &amp; Chicago is proliferation of firearms.
McCarthy: More murders last week compared to last year, which is unacceptable considering we had a higher number of officers out on streets.
McCarthy: Our officers wouldn't be forced to use their weapons if there weren't so many illegal guns out on our streets.
McCarthy: There are too many guns coming in and not enough punishment going out for illegal weapons.
Chicago Police Superintendent Gary McCarthy on deadly holiday weekend: "It's Groundhog Day again here in Chicago."
Happy Independence Day! #ProudToBeAnAmerican
