Hey journos, take the day off in Alabama. Eat some BBQ. Take a side in football, not politics. Greet a stranger with a "Roll Tide." Hit a craft brewery. Eat catfish. See Civil Rights history. Try white BBQ sauce. Go down to the river. Watch a sunset.		Y'all come back now, y'hear?

@GreyhoundBus A pickup truck pulls alongside us. The license plate says "Wolvman." The driver flashes a badge and has a conversation with our captain.
@GreyhoundBus Apparently they're sending another bus. It may take 45 minutes to get here. "I'm sorry, daddy," I hear the woman in front of me on her phone
@GreyhoundBus Some passengers rush to get off the bus, growing impatient with the captain's polite requests to stay put.
@GreyhoundBus Passengers further back tell "what's going on?!" and mutter obscenities. The back of the bus hasn't heard of our captain's struggle.
@GreyhoundBus Trail mix supplies are running low, and morale even lower. I calculate we're running over an hour behind. Then we pull into a truck stop.
@GreyhoundBus Our captain makes no announcement but continues driving cautiously. I hear her say something about uber.
@GreyhoundBus Passengers are beginning to get restless. They want to know what's going on.
@GreyhoundBus They're too hot. We pull over to check them out. She tells someone on the phone that they're ok but there's a funny smell on one of them.
@GreyhoundBus The intercom on the bus is broken, but I can hear the chatty driver as I'm only a few rows back. There's a problem with the tires.
@GreyhoundBus log, day 4(what it feels like): we departed 30 minutes late and the woman behind me has been on the phone the entire trip.
