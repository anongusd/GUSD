William Barr for AG is the wrong choice: 		Barr‚Äôs history of wide pardons for past administrations involved in criminal acts.		Barr knows Trump needs an AG who won‚Äôt recuse from the Trump Russia Investigation. 		Barr knows Trump requires an AG who believes Trump is above the law.
William Barr has clearly expressed his view that a President cannot be indicted. Barr is refusing to commit to sharing the contents of Mueller‚Äôs report with the Congress or the public. Barr‚Äôs installation as AG will serve Trump and not the rule of law.

America and the American people must resist and fight (by organizing, protesting, and voting) for a free, equal, and inclusive America. We are stronger together. We always will be.
America and the American people must always STAND AGAINST any animus, discrimination, hate, prejudice, racism and xenophobia toward any minority or marginalized group in America. Their strategy has always been to divide and conquer. We must stand strong. We must stand together.
‚ÄúBy blindly accepting the Government‚Äôs misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, is ‚Äòdangerous logic‚Äô and a ‚Äògravely wrong‚Äô decision.‚Äù -Sotomayor
