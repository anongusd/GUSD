@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred I won't support anybody if y'all can't figure things out.
@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred And extending it.
@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred the way it's gonna happen is if y'all come to an agreement on border security/ touching up Obama's fence.
@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred get the gov. Funded and going again. So the little people can get the paychecks again. I'm telling you...
@SpeakerPelosi @RepColinAllred I'm telling you, y'all are all gonna look like a bunch of idiot's if y'all  can't come to an agreement to...

@realDonaldTrump this continuing resolution; all the time, is kind of a problem Don.
@realDonaldTrump So Steve has just about got that budget figured out huh.
@realDonaldTrump it is obviously rule book legal. I guess.
@realDonaldTrump So. You can be a senator And Speaker of the house at the same time? Is this not unheard of?
@realDonaldTrump oh. Take out the "will".
@realDonaldTrump Mitt.
@realDonaldTrump how long has he been living in Utah?  You think he'll will live up to the Hatch standard? That's right. Big shoes to fill.
@realDonaldTrump better Call up Kim Jong Don.  He's back in the spotlight. He don't like that piece of paper. https://t.co/WdzTKCKRWH
@SenatorTomUdall that was set up just right huh. You all are way damn too important to miss a check.  May starve.
@SenatorTomUdall then y'all will actually have a good enough reason to figure shit out.
@SenatorTomUdall It needs to be the other way around.  To where the little people don't suffer when all of y'all can't find your assholes.
@SenatorTomUdall So. All y'all senators and members of congress still get paid during a shut down. I think that needs to change.
@SenatorTomUdall I'm pointing the finger at all y'all.
@SenatorTomUdall I think we should just stand our ground for a while, Until everyone looks like a bunch of idiot's. How's that sound Tom?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump come on man... And, I'm so tired of everyone pointing the finger.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump ineffective. Please...what is already there helps. It damn sure does. And you know it.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Don wants his way.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump what's sad is y'all couldn't come to some sort of an agreement over this 1 issue.  I know, y'all want your way.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I can understand your view of saying "hostage". Now,  we need some improvements down south &amp; everyone knows it.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump in the 1st place. Huh uh buddy, we're not going to just single out Homeland security.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump here. I'll tell you what's cynical and https://t.co/cC6oJ71bwG all letting the government go into a partial shutdown
We ain't doing that Chuck. I guess we're all about to find out how much you, Nancy, and Don actually care about all these federal employees.
@KamalaHarris in certain areas.
@KamalaHarris see, there's where your wrong.  Obama's fence damn sure can be effective at times. Only if it was harder to get over...
@realDonaldTrump just my opinion.
@realDonaldTrump But if your Generals think they need a little more time to explore a little more, you should probably give it to them.
@realDonaldTrump If you and your Generals feel confident, go ahead. Believe me, you'll know when there is a rising problem again.
@realDonaldTrump think about it.
@realDonaldTrump yeah, I've seen some of the  previous solid metal privacy type barrier. Is privacy needed?
@realDonaldTrump so still thinking about some solid Concrete Wall sections huh. Does some of it need to be a privacy fence in certain areas?
@realDonaldTrump Them middle eastern people also want us out of Iraq. So the militants have time to regroup.
@realDonaldTrump Travel Ban, one of your best accomplishments.  Nothing going on in the United States.
@realDonaldTrump And may never be as powerful as they once were before.
@realDonaldTrump they'll end up kind of like the Taliban is now. They will eventually regroup.  It'll take a very long.
@realDonaldTrump we could think, that we have totally obliterated ISIS and I'm sure there would always still be some remaining.  In hiding.

@realDonaldTrump Now look at what done went &amp; happened. Putin has Balls dragging the ground Missile.
@realDonaldTrump since there's all these retards that think Putin tells you what to do. Fucking idiots.
@realDonaldTrump All that talk about "I'm tough on Russia" to make whatever stupid paranoid fucks feel happy.
@realDonaldTrump Now Putin's got that big ass Missile to make your dick feel little.  He did that on purpose you know.
@realDonaldTrump we're the Big Boys Don! We are everywhere.
@realDonaldTrump some of the American people feel like our Military is constantly serving it's purpose. Within certain regions.
@realDonaldTrump Now I don't know exactly what U said, but we gotta make sure we keep our boys busy. Just their very presence helps.
@realDonaldTrump You made a lot of American people happy the other day just be visiting our troops. All it took was knowing u went.
@realDonaldTrump And I'm it helps make a lot of other folks feel the same way.  We love our Military.
@realDonaldTrump when our troops out in the world fighting for a greater cause, It makes me feel very confident &amp; Proud as an American.
@realDonaldTrump I just like the way he said that 1 line. How it sounded. The rest is terrible.
@realDonaldTrump that's really a bad example. Cause he was really bad Senator in that movie.  If you watch the scene you'll understand.
@realDonaldTrump let me let you in on a little secret. Lol! https://t.co/fvpoHm3xb5
@realDonaldTrump they like it/ seeing that type of thing. Helps show our Military is serving a purpose.
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure for some of the American people having our troops helping other countries out makes them feel proud.
@realDonaldTrump And I hear what your saying about Some of the American people feeling like we're being played.
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure all the troops that are gonna be coming back home from Syria are very happy about it.  ISIS is pretty much done.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, just like you said. The Morale...
@realDonaldTrump I just heard someone  on the radio say, "sounds like they're making paper out of porta potties up there."
@realDonaldTrump And I thought things were really starting to click for you yesterday morning.
@realDonaldTrump who the hell is brad? You just had to repeat it. What else did you say that I missed?
@KamalaHarris @ABCPolitics that would really be something,  now wouldn't it.
@KamalaHarris @ABCPolitics I'm not gonna go as far as saying the American People should be given an opportunity to vote on the Fence.  Yet.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS You Really startin' to get it now ain't ya.
@ABC he's getting a little ballsy ain't he.
@ABC how's the market doin'?
@SenSanders Bernie thinks he's trying to start some sort of movement.
@SenSanders Be. Bernie
@RepJeffries go ahead. But y'all are stupid with this January 3rd we're running shit now mentality.
Well, Mama's consumer confidence is up today.
@realDonaldTrump Shutdown is 1st priority though.
@realDonaldTrump Come on. Let's get the ball moving on something with the Chinese Emperor.
@NancyPelosi Nancy. No holding out. Compromise. Let's end this shutdown situation we are in. ASAP. Merry Christmas!
@SenSchumer Oh yeah, Merry Christmas!
@SenSchumer really man, y'all need to reach a compromise.
@SenSchumer the American people deserve better than this game of chicken.
@SenSchumer Chuck.  I know Don gave you another offer &amp; I'm sure if you accepted it the American people would greatly appreciate it.
@ellisonbarber @CBSNews And Toots speaks.  Do y'all really think that's gonna happen?
@realDonaldTrump you, Chuck, and Nancy. Y'all got it figured out, all 3 of y'alls fault.  Y'all meet in the Middle.
@realDonaldTrump you know what's funny about this shutdown, how we both point the finger at each other. Yeah, y'all are right.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS 115 miles huh.  Good deal.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS chuck &amp; nancy, keep the gov. Funded, &amp; keep the finish Obama's fence project going, it should help out.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Fuel prices should be going back up here pretty soon. I'm sure if you can get to an agreement w/...

@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Ah‚òùÔ∏è! Finish Obama's fence üí∞. I get it now.
@realDonaldTrump I ain't buying shit.
@realDonaldTrump Robert's consumer confidence tanked just now.
@realDonaldTrump that's just the way it works.
@realDonaldTrump that's fuct up ain't it.
@realDonaldTrump And the stocks are plummeting as you tweet. "We're coming back home."
@Nike was...
@Nike I'm not doing it.
@Nike y'all may just have to improve your insoles. Hell, I don't know?
@Nike I ain't buying no shoes if I can't buy insoles directly with them. I was gonna buy two pair. Fuck it.
@TownEastMall that's right.
@TownEastMall y'all need to pick up the trash around here.
I just want some Claussen whole pickles.  Big and little ones.
@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost oh. I keep doing that.  You're
@amyklobuchar @washingtonpost Go on &amp; get the hell out of here man. If your leaving, get on...
@ellisonbarber Toots.
@FoxNews that's unique.
@FoxNews  Oh. It Ellison, not Allison.
@KamalaHarris As soon as we get approval to finish Obama's fence.
@realDonaldTrump Well, stocks in Ammo went  even further down after that tweet.
@realDonaldTrump I bet old Chucky went to go party.
@senrobportman It's on that third strike is when your fuct. The way it's always been I guess.
@senrobportman we believe in 2nd chances around here. Pretty much everyone that works here is a felon.
@senrobportman that's good. When I used to run these coils over to a yard in Ft. Worth.  The guy that i used to check in with used to say...
@KamalaHarris She try make it Don Trum down.
@KamalaHarris huh uh. Both of them. For being 2 stubborn old men. I don't blame Don for wanting to finish the fence though.
@SenSchumer 2 Billion...
@realDonaldTrump When you were running for President, you had no idea you'd be dealing with this 1 cockblocking mother fucker all the time.
@realDonaldTrump this gonna be your 1st Christmas at the Whitehouse. During another Chuckdown.
@LindseyGrahamSC Let Don Trum finish the God damn fence y'all.
@NancyPelosi she try make it Don Trum down.
@NancyPelosi Chuckdown.
@realDonaldTrump they finally ran The U.S. off.
@realDonaldTrump Hahahaaa! The Taliban say they've won.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman That's Myong talkin' there.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman They try make it Don Trum down.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman How many damn Presidents been working on that fence, and for how long now?
@GOP @GOPChairwoman is a little bit of Bush and Bill in that fence?
@GOP @GOPChairwoman that's a team thing we go going on there. Obama/Trump secure border fence act. Where 2 Presidents team up. Made History.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman tell 'em. It is time to finish Obama's fence.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman I'm telling y'all. That Obviously A Powerline Idea. Will work. Nobody will climb that fence.
@KamalaHarris A Chuckdown.
@ShannonBream she really thinks she's hot shit don't she.
@KamalaHarris the fence won't need to be High Voltage. Run a Powerline across the top of it. Someone needs some power routed, I'm sure.
@KamalaHarris Lol!  I'm telling you. Perfect.
@KamalaHarris That fence won't need to have any points on it.
@KamalaHarris A Big Ole Thick Way Too Obvious Powerline. Everyone will just look at it and the birds on it chirping away.
@KamalaHarris problem solved!
@KamalaHarris just think, it'll work out perfect. The only people that go near powerlines are linemen. Nobody will want to climb that fence.
@KamalaHarris Kamilia. A Fence. We're finishing Obama's fence. Incorporated with a powerline bird perch.
@ChrisCoons I don't know why Chuck always feels like he has something to prove.
@realDonaldTrump he just loves to cockblock Don.
@realDonaldTrump another 1. Another Chuckdown.  Just like last time.
@realDonaldTrump We're having a chuckdown.
@realDonaldTrump I'm calling it Chuckdown. Stubborn Chuck.
https://t.co/i4eIi4pFcm
@ShannonBream I can't believe Chuck's stubborn ass shut it down.
@GOP @SteveScalise well now that it reminds everyone of Obama, it's all good.
@realDonaldTrump be all that chirping going on.
@realDonaldTrump it's gonna be all pretty with all them birds setting on that power line up top.
@realDonaldTrump s. Likes
@realDonaldTrump he like that Fence. Reminds him of old Barrack.
@realDonaldTrump Chuck wants to talk more about it.
@realDonaldTrump we're gonna run a power line all the way down that fence.
@senatemajldr it's a fence, just like back in the Obama days y'all.  Does that help?
@KamalaHarris i been trying to tell y'all not to let it happen.
@realDonaldTrump now after a section of it's built, send that girl from American ninja that rides motorcycles out there.
@realDonaldTrump better be thick.
@realDonaldTrump I ain't gonna be able to cut thru it with a hacksaw am I?
@realDonaldTrump well we got plenty of steel.
@realDonaldTrump might take some time.
@realDonaldTrump but If i tied some rope to make ladder.
@realDonaldTrump there's nowhere to set your foot.
@realDonaldTrump stainless?
@realDonaldTrump with a strand of "High Voltage" wire at the top. For the birds.
@realDonaldTrump I'm lucky I didn't break my neck.
@realDonaldTrump i wouldn't want to get my shoe string caught on that thing when I go to jump. Trust me, no fun.
@SenateGOP @SenFeinstein I done told y'all! I figured it out, the President.
@SenateGOP that's fuct up ain't it.
@SenateGOP the President.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT and. They don't throw rocks.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT And. They don't Caravan rush the Border.  They pay their own way.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT they go back home.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT The Canadians don't need babysitters.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT It has nothing to do with race.
@marcorubio @ChrisMurphyCT Murphy is hilarious ain't he.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Ok. So y'all know The stipulation.
@realDonaldTrump And your going Str8 to Hell buddy.  Lol!
@ChrisCoons now, I'm gonna go in here, get a cup of coffee and a shower. Tell all them fuckers in the senate not to let me down Chris.
@ChrisCoons I'm tired of paying to babysit them.
@ChrisCoons you happy?
@ChrisCoons yes, I've heard it all. And the 1st time I heard Don say that I laughed.
@ChrisCoons I don't give a damn what he said before.  Has Mexico ever paid to babysit them all them mother fuckers?
@realDonaldTrump Where's the Logic?
@realDonaldTrump I just can't understand why $1.6 Billion was Okay before? Has something changed since then?
@tommychong @Libertea2012 I'm going to bed Tommy.
@tommychong @Libertea2012 I'm fucking Pissed! On some headlight bulbs, god damn fucking TA. $46.00
@ShannonBream @SecNielsen @DHSgov takes her job very seriously.

@LindseyGrahamSC I'm getting my money back Judge.
@LindseyGrahamSC walked out to the truck to put them on and clip was on the wrong side.
@LindseyGrahamSC I accidentally bought the KW bulbs.
@LindseyGrahamSC all cause I opened the package. Hell, there was a pack sitting right there stapled together.
@LindseyGrahamSC I'm so pissed on them God damn headlights Lindsey. TA fuct me.
@SecNielsen tell 'em. That kind of shit is Done. We're thinking Jurassic Park High Voltage.
@RepJeffries $ 1.6 Billion was okay last year, but not this year huh?
@RepJeffries Anything.
@RepJeffries Ransom. Please...
@RepJeffries But y'all don't even want that.
@RepJeffries I doesn't have to be $5 billion. Just agree to something. Don's will to give DACA citizenship. I guarantee it.
@KamalaHarris them mother fuckers just basically stole $46.00 from me.
@KamalaHarris they better hurry it up too. Before I do something stupid.
@KamalaHarris until then, it's a standoff.
@KamalaHarris I'm gonna get my TA refund 1 way or another. Either they're gonna pay it or they can assume that I satisfied myself.
@KamalaHarris go ahead and tell all them federal employees to find something part time. They can all blame Don, Chuck, and Nancy.
@KamalaHarris We're gonna have us a good ole fashion standoff for a while Kamala.
@TATravelCenters I'd advise y'all to speak up.
@TATravelCenters of course I opened the package. 9006...I left with H11.
@TATravelCenters the wrong ones.  And nobody said anything about it.
@TATravelCenters here's the worst part about it all is. Right after I bought the wrong bulbs I said I might be returning them if they're...
@TATravelCenters I just spend $300 at TA in grand bay, AL the other night. I've been coming to TA and Petros by choice.
@TATravelCenters they even called the manager over here.  Y'alls policy ain't right.
@TATravelCenters the bulbs I really needed were on $20. I left the receipt and those $46.00 bulbs on y'alls counter.
@TATravelCenters I spend a lot of money at TA. And y'all just fucked me on some headlights.
@TATravelCenters I left the bulbs on the counter anyways &amp; bought the right ones. It's like y'all stole $46.00 from me.
@TATravelCenters I got a complaint. I just bought the wrong headlight bulbs for my truck &amp; y'all wouldn't refund me $46.
https://t.co/ztMOgslI1q

@SenSchumer you'll be able to hear that son bitch buzzing from a mile away.
@SenSchumer Windmills and solar panels... It'll pay for it's self. .
@SenSchumer No expensive concrete Chuck. TXU would probably love to support it. We can harness natural energy to power it.
@SenSchumer Chucks like "The high voltage fence idea is an OUTRAGE!"
@SenTedCruz Now that I mentioned it, that's not too bad of an idea.
@SenTedCruz we're gonna put up 1 of those high voltage fences like in Jurassic Park.
@SenTedCruz He knows what the fuck goes on. And how out of control this issue is. Fuck babysitting all those people.
@SenTedCruz See.Ted's no dumbass.
@GovMikeHuckabee But No, everyone's too ignorant for that.
@GovMikeHuckabee I think we should pull out of taking care of the illegal Aliens.
@GovMikeHuckabee Fuck it. We'll be back, if need be.
@GovMikeHuckabee Give 'em a break.
@GovMikeHuckabee You know folks wanna come home.

We watch Fox in the Queen city truck stop. On 5 TV's.
@SenSchumer Now, I'm gonna go in here &amp; see if I can get me some grub.
@SenSchumer we've got a major problem. With those Aliens and their false claims.
@SenSchumer I sure do wish you'd quit being such a pain in the ass Chuck. Oh bullshit on the majority of the Country. We know.....
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @PJMedia_com Mornin'.

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @PJMedia_com Well y'all...Tractor runs great, just clouds up the whole Interstate with white smoke.
@LindseyGrahamSC I can't see it.  It's not showing up on my cell phone right here.
@nytimes he was trying to check out all the porn I've been watching with google play.
@nytimes Why's that son of a bitch try to update my cell phone apps everytime I log into Facebook? I had to stop him the other day.
@LindseyGrahamSC Don't we need to Get rid of all them too?
@LindseyGrahamSC You think it's a mistake don't cha. And what the hell is this I hear about people trying to Negotiate with Taliban?
@RobertKing80 3 years of it, I'm disgusted.
Evidently 2015 ain't cuttin' it. It's definitely settled, I am an anti-diesel emissions kind of guy. THEy Always Fuck Up!
I just want a decent truck to drive.
@CNNPolitics So, none of that shit matters. He didn't go thru with it. That's all that matters.
@realDonaldTrump she's not allowed to go outside on her own. Supposedly.  But, I'm not there right now.
@realDonaldTrump Back on the walker.
@realDonaldTrump her knees fuct up right now Don. She fell coming in the front door the other day &amp; I had to pick her up.
@realDonaldTrump "They try make it Don Trum down." Is what Mama always says.
@realDonaldTrump Ok.
@realDonaldTrump good thing they're done huh.
@realDonaldTrump what a load of shit.
@realDonaldTrump I just can't get over how stupid America is. Ah, hopped the border, broke the law, pamper them. They've earned it.
@realDonaldTrump not you Don, just people in general.
@realDonaldTrump then we can all determine whether or not your fucking idiot.
@realDonaldTrump before you go to bitchin' about the national debt, let's hear your opinion on the southern border laws.
@realDonaldTrump And people wanna talk about the national debt.
@realDonaldTrump especially when it comes to protecting our southern border.
@realDonaldTrump I hope everyone realizes we should not be sheltering &amp; taking care of those Illegal Aliens.Due process is fucking retarded.
@realDonaldTrump That little girl that died, it's her fathers fault. Neglectful dumbass.
@realDonaldTrump More than 2 or 3 I think.
@realDonaldTrump I mean God Damn, how many days without water does it take to die of dehydration?
@realDonaldTrump to give them water.
@realDonaldTrump them some tough ass kids that make it on the otherside of the border. Or, their parents just have enough sense....
@realDonaldTrump Desert, Swim the river, Climb the wall.
@realDonaldTrump someone's gonna throw a rope over it and tie it to 1 of them slats. Then triathlon over it, like they all do.
@realDonaldTrump Yep. You gotta fight for Democrats like Chuck too.
@realDonaldTrump Also to fight for those Citizens that totally dislike your ass, talk shit on you, and resist.
@SenSchumer since you keep trying to make him look like a fool.
@SenSchumer I'm sure Don is about to say something.  Probably doesn't really feel like talking to you too much.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Due process, Please...
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump the best policy is to set them right back on the other side of the border immediately.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump well let me tell you something, sheltering all those Illegal Aliens is unnecessary and ineffective.
@SenSchumer we need to stop pampering them. Overfeeding them. They don't need all that A/ C &amp; heat neither. Turn that shit off.
@SenSchumer Alright Chuck. We're gonna pay for it, just like we pay to take care of all those illegals that stay here already.
@latimes I got 2 pairs of nunchucks.
@CNNPolitics says the guy that doesn't know anything.
@realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi No Shitdown. Whatever it takes.
@realDonaldTrump winning.
@realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi It'd be nice if y'all would stop ragging each other's asses &amp; worrying about which 1 of y'all is..
@realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi  Go back to the DACA/ Wall deal. No shutdown. Let's try not to make this too difficult y'all.
No brainer. https://t.co/1l8QIfI2SP

@GMA @TVMarci I thought they found people with cell phone pings Nowadays.
@SenWhitehouse no are.
@SenWhitehouse You watch Shelton, we're are gonna get us some kick ass constitutional health care here pretty soon.
@thehill @BretBaier Hilarious!
@NancyPelosi anyone with common sense can come to that conclusion.
@NancyPelosi Nancy if that little girl died of dehydration as soon as our border patrol picked her up, it is not our fault.
@SenSchumer we ain't shutting shit down. Come to an agreement on a figure with Don. If not 5 then y'all do less.
@SenSchumer Oh Mick ain't too bad is he?
@realDonaldTrump Can't be having all that high turn over rate. It makes that Company look bad. Why they have so much trouble keeping people?
@realDonaldTrump yeah, you ain't replacing Mick Mother fucker. That's the last 1 you get. Like it or not.
@realDonaldTrump Fuck that Exhaust fluid.  I bet my truck runs like a champ from here on out. Got a new Cat and filter.
@realDonaldTrump replace. Causing you to replace filters earlier than normally.
@realDonaldTrump converter. Then It causes the DPF to not regenerate properly and therefore clogging the hell out of every new filter you...

@realDonaldTrump I hope he goes to the bunny ranch soon.
@realDonaldTrump that's all there is to it.

@stillcrazyblaze @AdamTheRed @washingtonpost Fuck housing them mother fuckers.
@weemelah1 @washingtonpost So. We are everywhere.
@AdamTheRed @washingtonpost I meant to write while not why.
@AdamTheRed @washingtonpost why marrying an Army MP with a drug test. And that was back in 1977.
@AdamTheRed @washingtonpost I can't understand why people think we should just let them in. It took my mother 6 months to get in.
@ABC He out getting high.
@washingtonpost Whoever he is, he's a dumb-ass. If we let them in. All of Central America will show up. They pretty much already are.
@ABC what's she doin' talkin' to Hilly?  She must've been hollering a lot with that hoarse voice.
@SenSchumer you can call it a hunch.
@SenSchumer I say that cause I'm pretty sure. No one is gonna overcome Donathan.
@SenSchumer we should make a deal at 2 billion a year towards a border barrier til 2024.

@SenSchumer You know damn well we're gonna need $12B more. Over the next 6 years.
@SenSchumer oh. I meant to write "these large crowds"
@SenSchumer Sure!
@SenSchumer All it takes is 1 little stand set up Somewhere in Central America that says "want to go to America!?" And they're all over it.
@SenSchumer I'm sure We may all change our minds a little once we get tired of fooling with this large crowds. That shit is ridiculous.
@SenSchumer We're doing a rounded steel post slat type thing. Only thing we need concrete for is a good foundation.
@SenSchumer Oh God damn Chuck. With the shiutdown talk.
@realDonaldTrump ok.
https://t.co/a3za8Sn46X
@realDonaldTrump American's just want too much $ for their work.

@realDonaldTrump what'd sounds a little better.
@realDonaldTrump what do you expect Don? They're French/ Canadian...
.
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews We don't take large crowds of applicants. It is illogical.
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Well, As she can see...her future application has already been revoked.
@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen And I bet, she could do it while eating a Street Taco without a problem.
@realDonaldTrump See. A 1 of a kind badass bitch you got there Don. She'll tell any little Alien kid to go home. https://t.co/zoPGfE6ecX

@NASA @NASAInSight The Hulk is there?
@realDonaldTrump oops ..they're are
@realDonaldTrump I think they're are landing something, but the preview cut out at 400 meters.
@davidcicilline @SenWhitehouse Obviously.
@davidcicilline @SenWhitehouse I'd say that is America all the way.
@SenWhitehouse @brianschatz that might help convince them to go back home.
Just about ran over a Turkey hanging out next to I-55.
@realDonaldTrump you know some ignorant mother fucker is gonna get tangled up in all that prison wire.
@politico He'll never make it.  Laughed my ass off the 1st time I seen his commercial.
@CNNPolitics Wow.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I'm done talking about it.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN Hell I don't know?
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN what was the reason behind Jamal's death? I'm guessing he was some kind of activist &amp; had somebody a little  upset.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN guess I was going along with all the finger pointing like everyone else.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I know what I said earlier. No, I can't be sure.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN about all the talk and blame.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I can tell y'all 1 thing. If...The Crown Prince really had nothing to do with it. He's definitely not very happy..
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN servant my ass. All long as we make it clear, this kind of shit can not happen. And will not be tolerated.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I can't believe nobody stopped Chow. What was he thinking? Chow had a death wish.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN Kinda like chow.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN Jamal was obviously viewed as a threat to someone.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I guess I'll leave it at, snitches end up in ditches.  Anybody ever heard that before?
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN people can point the finger all they want. Gotta have concrete proof.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN And I'm sure everyone is running off speculation. Kind of like me. What exactly does everyone expect Don to do?
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN Ok. So. I'm hearing what all these intelligence agencies are saying.  No way to prove it.
@realDonaldTrump good deal. Crazy with the prison wire. Over done maybe.  Watch 'em, they got snips.
Damn that took a while.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN gauge cluster light bulbs replaced. Column shift bushings in.
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN I may comment  later I watched 1 min 22 seconds. I come back to it. Column shift indicator fixed.
@SnoopDogg big grocery loads.
@SnoopDogg Probably about 2009 I started Jammin' Doggystyle. When I was an Ice Cream man. A for real ice cream man. Tandem axle box truck.
@SnoopDogg I don't like snoop. Then whenever 2 of Amerikaz most wanted came out I was like "This Jams!"
@SnoopDogg Remember when it 1st came out. Some people I hung out w/ were listening to it. I was like what the hell are y'all listening to?
@SnoopDogg Lodi Dodi/Murder was the Case.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr they https://t.co/rAZd5Z3OHw I had the day off, but start running again for the week in the morning. Rockford, IL.

@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr electric start/ self propelled. One of those high class push mowers.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr really it was crimped, but I soldered it back.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr I just fixed the electric start mower. Wire came unsoldered.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Put the old Felons back to work before the Mess-icans.  Americans deserve a second chance 1st.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Good deal. Ok.
@SecNielsen @politico I like reading her stuff.
@BrookeBCNN Alice. She's alright I think.
@BrookeBCNN she reminds of 1 of those protesters that won't shut the fuck up.
@BrookeBCNN basement girl is fucking stupid. Get her out of there.
@BrookeBCNN why does everyone look so tired?
@BrookeBCNN oh....s.  ratings

@realDonaldTrump Yea Don, crown Prince does not want to hear about no more. Feels insulted.
@realDonaldTrump Crown guy can deny involvement all he wants to. I really don't give a shit. It's over with, Jamal's a goner.
@realDonaldTrump Alright. Ate a little Turkey, time to take a nap. Crown Prince ordered a silencing of Jamal, we're not stupid redline man.
@realDonaldTrump I don't know what's wrong with them Nine people?
@realDonaldTrump yea. Those maroon/ purple ties go good with those dark suits Don.
@realDonaldTrump Momma said, "I watching Don Trum." https://t.co/f3NznfkD2h

@NancyPelosi @Jeopardy somebody was calling you the Visa lady a while back.
@NancyPelosi @Jeopardy Been pretty optimistic here lately huh Nancy.
@NancyPelosi @Jeopardy reinvestment.  I looked it up, no longer Negative Nancy. I was about to say reconciliation at 1st though.
The Untouchables.

@realDonaldTrump Domino's tonight Don. Myong's idea. Turkey at dawn.
@realDonaldTrump that's fucking hilarious!
@realDonaldTrump like I said, no real way to prove it.  We're just not stupid.
@realDonaldTrump there's not really a whole lot you can do. That wouldn't be taken as a direct accusing insult.
@realDonaldTrump I don't know what everyone expects you to do?  Holler sanctions?  What a bunch of bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia's bitch. Hahahaaa!  That's fuct up...

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Oh calm down chuck. He's gone.  Let him go.
@BretBaier Show folks How Bret makes the perfect Turkey sandwich.
@RobertKing80 I haven't ate a damn thing either.
@RobertKing80 I've taken 4 in the past 3 1/2. They barely work.
Those weak Hydrocodones should be illegal.
Too much news can be a bad thing too. I wonder what movies are on?
@BillOReilly @NoSpinNews My buddy's step dad told him George Soros hates America.
God damn... I'm taking 2 more hydrocodone.
@BeschlossDC @BretBaier Someone tell John, don't be fucking around man.
@realDonaldTrump Too much of anything can be a bad thing sometimes.
@realDonaldTrump the economy may get a little boost, then tank. It'll have to be a gradual process.
@realDonaldTrump Although, I do think if we start filling our high class job problem too quickly.
@realDonaldTrump Call up some new tons of available manufacturing jobs people.  They're gonna need bilingual trainers.
@realDonaldTrump only reason they get that privilege over the huge waiting list is because they're a fucking hassle.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously Don. Gonna have to do something.  We need that Mexican Cap.
@realDonaldTrump we should probably start with some of the crowds we are already sheltering. Dispersal.
@realDonaldTrump A Work providing program. Giving folks a certain amount of time to be self sustainable.
@realDonaldTrump I'm telling you, your gonna have to end up setting up some kind of program. Where we take in so many per year.
@realDonaldTrump that's it!  Apply.  Or Marry an American.
@realDonaldTrump Only war zone refugees. And that's as big as our hearts get.
@realDonaldTrump Asylum is not an option.
@realDonaldTrump how about catch with immediate deportation, once on our side of the border.  Or...just don't let Aliens cross our border.
@realDonaldTrump Catch, detain, feed, &amp; shelter?
@RobertKing80 Ah...It doesn't really hurt. Not like a need a root canal toothache does.
@RobertKing80 getting an implant.
Hydrocodone 325 ain't worth a damn. I just got molar pulled. No infection. Just broke and had a root eating away at itself. From the inside.
@ItsFlo where is Flo from I wonder?
@washingtonpost oh. I meant to write "some" here.
@TheOval @USATODAY Well even though the CIA says all signs point to the Prince.There really is no concrete proof yet. We're just not stupid.
@washingtonpost while so stocks go down. Others go up.
@realDonaldTrump And gas should be down during everyone's holiday travels. I'm sure there's a boost in sales anyways.
@HuntsmanAbby Abby's like, I don't even use gas.
@HuntsmanAbby And don't forget to thank Jamal for cheap gas. For the time being...
@realDonaldTrump So gas is going way down huh. Good deal! And all thanks to Jamal for running his trap.  Yay!
@realDonaldTrump You think I felt like dealing with think kind of bullshit?"
@realDonaldTrump I don't know what the hell you should do? Look at the prince guy and say "God Dammit Man!
@SarahKSilverman @wmag she's always up late.
@SecNielsen @DHSgov @CBP Wow. With the prison wire.
@realDonaldTrump headed back to Dallas.
@realDonaldTrump Walmart parking lot.
@realDonaldTrump I'm on my 30 min. In Commerce across from the college.
@realDonaldTrump yea...
@realDonaldTrump What I thought from the get go.
@realDonaldTrump But I do think The Newbie Crown Prince probably let the power go to his head a little.
@realDonaldTrump I think Jamal was probably a little too big for his britches anyways. That kind of shit ain't gonna happen again Don.
@realDonaldTrump yea.
@senorrinhatch @Hiresbigh1 Hatch got that pimp gear on.
@SenSchumer Chuck. Jamal was just in too deep man. He obviously would've been better off keeping his mouth shut.
@BrookeBCNN Ok. So the Crown Prince gets 1, but that's it.
That's right. Wanna buy weed instead of food? No welfare. https://t.co/HK0rabmPGU

@realDonaldTrump @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS If see a god damn grass fire, you call in. I don't give a fuck who you are.
@realDonaldTrump @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS All I got say is " Why do people not call in about a fire before it get ginormous?"
@SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @CISAgov the same ones.
@SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @CISAgov ya just don't fucking take them. I understand that they keep coming back.
@SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @CISAgov I still think anymore tents and any kind of housing for illegals would be a bad Idea though.
@SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @CISAgov she's good Don. Stop fucking with her like your not satisfied Don.
@SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump @CISAgov are you gonna really quit fire?
@HillaryClinton @staceyabrams But...I tried to tell her. Lawsuits are not how election's are won.  It makes you looks bad if anything.

@BrookeBCNN shows they're paying attention.
@realDonaldTrump I'm telling y'all, it's a wonderful thing.
@realDonaldTrump See how everyone comes together under Don!
@realDonaldTrump some people are just ignorant, so you got to tell them.
@realDonaldTrump and it has to have a ring around it of some sort.  Rocks, use rocks.
@realDonaldTrump if you start a camp fire make sure the coals are out before you leave it unattended.
@realDonaldTrump and commercials.

@realDonaldTrump what is there 5 different fires going right now out there?
@KamalaHarris @MSNBC I don't think it was a campfire. Who's was it?
@senatemajldr everyone pray for some rain out there.  Time for a rain dance.
@senatemajldr Just don't see how it gets into those neighborhoods and keeps going like that?
@senatemajldr get into the trees and take off.
@senatemajldr I've seen a few folks thinking they were doing a controlled burn get out of hand.
@senatemajldr things just don't burst into flames over nothing. It always starts off in the dry grass.
@senatemajldr you know how many fires I've seen on the side of the road that got out of hand over cigarettes? Too many times.
@senatemajldr And don't forget to remind folks to stop throwing out their god damn cigarette butts out on the road.
@RandyRRQuaid I'm not too sure if there's an actual way Eddie can be brought back.
@RandyRRQuaid Somebody hire this guy for some kind of a damn movie, cause I'm not giving his goofy ass $2.

@staceyabrams That's tough Stayshe...
@staceyabrams take an "are" out of that sentence.
@staceyabrams if you filed a lawsuit, then you are for sure are done. It just doesn't look good.
@staceyabrams that's not how people get elected.
@staceyabrams Yep. Your done homegirl. Filing a lawsuit to try and win an election race, is going a little too far.
Those California Fires are fucking stupid.  I'm so sick of hearing about California burning every year.
Sick of seeing that 1 legged mother fucker on the corner.
@realDonaldTrump All Hail The French.

@realDonaldTrump of involvement of some sort. Like you've got the answers to those type of questions?
@realDonaldTrump I bet Mac doesn't try to push a racial narrative on you. Or keep bringing up black suppression, like you've got some kind..

@foxandfriends Oh yeah, she's...time to retire.  Just like momma... time to stay at home.
@LindseyGrahamSC @ScottforFlorida I still can't believe Don fired Jeff.  Just cause he didn't like him. The Big Texas way.

@WhiteHouse All them people are well clothed and fed.

@RobertKing80 I know you can crack a windshield if you've already got a chip in it W/ hot &amp; cold on 1 or the other side of it. I've done it.
@RobertKing80 That ain't gonna be worth a damn with the windshield is frozen over. Defrost/ heat, make any sense?
@RobertKing80 Cold rain, but I want heat. Turn on defrost, no option for unfogging with heat. Plus I was kind of chilly.
Who's the fucking genius that came up with the idea to force U to use outside Air when trying to defrost your windshield?
@BrookeBCNN Don't nobody seek help for mental illness these days. They take drugs instead.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse So in other words. It's essentially stopping right at the new Tent.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse really! With the more tents? Oh god damn...
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Or else no one will hire you.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It doesn't work like that. Where u just come in and work. You have to be approved 1st.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse U know. There's actually a lot of them that want to work. Someone is going to have to explain to them...
@WhiteHouse it was sitting on the fireplace hearth. From All the way across the living room.
@WhiteHouse fucking hurt!...
@WhiteHouse hell yeah...1 time my ex-wife threw a softball sized rock at me. I was laughing, but it still dropped me to me knees.

@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN @MattLesser it's just a guy holding cash!
@CNNnewsroom @BrookeBCNN @MattLesser that picture right there says nothing that has anything to do with someone being Jewish.
@realDonaldTrump all them folks are too used to getting hand outs.
@realDonaldTrump they'd rather do nothing or raise hell.
@realDonaldTrump them folks don't want a manufacturing job Don.
@realDonaldTrump they got all that time on their hands to protest.
@realDonaldTrump All those people raising hell. Where's my Obama Check!?  You notice they're not at work.
@realDonaldTrump them Dems get crazy huh.

@BrookeBCNN the gunman's father probably said Nigger a lot when he was a kid.
@BrookeBCNN y'all white folks don't worry.  You can still leave your Church doors unlocked. It's a Black thing.

@realDonaldTrump they're like this right now.  ‚úäüèΩbut it's a tired fist.
@realDonaldTrump I don't know what the fuck they plan on doing over here?  Running the streets?
@realDonaldTrump they're thinking....10,000 strong, we're unstoppable!
@realDonaldTrump way in.
@realDonaldTrump you know them caravaners ain't gonna be orderly Don.  They ain't going quietly. They think they're gonna bum rush their...
@BrookeBCNN @RepSanfordSC not to kill though. Just injure.
@realDonaldTrump Yep. Some folks are probably gonna end up shot if they start shit.
@LindseyGrahamSC @axios all thinking your make a citizen just by fucking.
@LindseyGrahamSC @axios that's right! Your bitch better at least have a green card before you go to busting a nut in her.
@VanJones68 @BrookeBCNN @AndrewGillum that's just bullshit.
@VanJones68 @BrookeBCNN @AndrewGillum wait. A black is involved. Must be racism.
@VanJones68 @BrookeBCNN @AndrewGillum calling someone a thief does not mean they're are racist.  That's just ridiculous to even suggest.
@VanJones68 @BrookeBCNN @AndrewGillum why, what did Drew get caught taking?
@VanJones68 @BrookeBCNN @AndrewGillum why are y'all trying to push the narrative that Don's racist? A thief is a thief.
@SenSchumer illegals ain't getting free health care.  So you can shut with that shit Chuck
@realDonaldTrump what's simpler?
@realDonaldTrump And stop babysitting grown folks.
@realDonaldTrump Don. We need to do either do a mass deportation or put what we already got to work.
@SenatorLeahy do you have any idea how much money these illegals are costing us?
@SenatorLeahy I'm calling for mass deportations.
@SenatorLeahy have seen the multiple areas we are using to take care of these people?
@SenatorLeahy what about tax payer dollars to babysit illegals all over Texas?
@SenatorLeahy I'm telling you.  Don is not gonna fuck over the elderly.
Yeah, no way I could've stayed hooked up. https://t.co/hhJhD5KRiB
@SenateDems that kinda of shit ain't free unless you're elderly.
@SenateDems I filled out my insurance paperwork yesterday. They draw it out of my paycheck.
@realDonaldTrump I wanna buy something.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Don has a whole lot of Illegal immigration to deal w/ don't he? More than any other President in history.
@LindseyGrahamSC that's what my dad did. He didn't go to nutting till he go her here legally. Yep got mom here. A year later had my brother.
@LindseyGrahamSC better make sure your bitch is approved.
@LindseyGrahamSC if daddy is and mama ain't.  Then daddy better be working on getting that str8 then. Before that baby is born.
@LindseyGrahamSC Yep, should all depend on whether or not your parents are here legally.
@PoppyHarlowCNN @POTUS @RepTedLieu Oh. That makes me like Ted a little bit now. Respectful &amp; not talking shit.
@realDonaldTrump that way.
@realDonaldTrump But we should end that process.  Thay way there's no argument in the future.  Parents gotta be here legally!
@realDonaldTrump we need to go ahead a put and end to that process. That's why we have all the daca people. Present Daca's are here to stay.
@realDonaldTrump Yep, not a legal born citizen if your parents are here illegally.  I agree.
@realDonaldTrump I blame Obama For making us such softies.
@realDonaldTrump and y'all fuckers are just letting illegals in to wait on a court date &amp; taking care of them like babies.
@realDonaldTrump Mom said it took 6 months to get approval to come to The U.S.  Even a drug test. And that was back in 1977.
@realDonaldTrump my mother was brought here legally.
@realDonaldTrump I guess it could only apply to illegals having babies here.
@realDonaldTrump Don. If ending birth right citizenship was the case, I would've never been a citizen.
@RobertKing80 I must've spent 30 minutes trying to hit that hole perfect. Fork lift guy talking about 'naw.. can you come over a foot?

@realDonaldTrump @BlacksForTrump5 @StephenAtHome you know, kinda like how I refer to myself as a chink sometimes.
@realDonaldTrump @BlacksForTrump5 @StephenAtHome If I was black, I'd be so controversial. Everyone would trip out on me.

@realDonaldTrump @BlacksForTrump5 @StephenAtHome couldn't even explain it.  It's 1 of those freak things. Getting an implant.
@realDonaldTrump @BlacksForTrump5 @StephenAtHome inside the root, it's eating away at itself. From the inside out. A root canal specialist..
@realDonaldTrump @BlacksForTrump5 @StephenAtHome opting out for the route canal &amp; crown. It's got some kind of special shit going on...

@WinterLions @BrookeBCNN @Vimeo I get it!  I see what he's saying! We need a good ole War to help bring everyone back together.
@FoxNews @PressSec maybe...it was because I had the phone speaker up to my ear while laying here.?
@FoxNews @PressSec Oh god. She reminded me of a bitching housewife right there. Just pissed off.
@FoxNews @PressSec Uh...Sara. Is it gonna be ok to shoot at the caravan people w/ BB guns as a prank?
@realDonaldTrump This is an OUTRAGE!
@realDonaldTrump Us Americans need our coffee, otherwise we get moody.
@realDonaldTrump Don. You tell them Guatemalans there's a coffee shortage right now &amp; they need to get back to work.
@tedcruz Hey. That's where I'm going Teddy!
@realDonaldTrump these aren't war refugees.
@realDonaldTrump we don't let huge crowds in just because they want a better life. Life ain't fair.
@realDonaldTrump they'll be here in less than 20 days Don.
@realDonaldTrump why is this not working?
@realDonaldTrump I'm calling for mass deportations.
@realDonaldTrump that we have spread out in certain locations of Texas.?
@realDonaldTrump Don. Why are we spending so much of the American people's tax dollars on taking care of &amp; sheltering all those Mess-icans?
@realDonaldTrump ole superstitious flying Don.
@realDonaldTrump  I was checking out the map earlier.
@realDonaldTrump still trying to picture how your going to accomplish it though. I can not believe we are already sheltering so many though.
@realDonaldTrump Let me guess...your still sticking with NO on the Caravaners. Not 1. Yes!üëê you fucking asshole! I love it.
@realDonaldTrump I see ya Don. Double Tap for good Luck. And the umbrella.  Nobody else gets it. https://t.co/wLOKFY50Fl
@realDonaldTrump can't be done.
@realDonaldTrump I see...Damn we're holding a lot of people. Hold then deport. I don't think it is possible with the upcoming caravan.
@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper just cause he acts like he know best &amp; what he's talking about.
@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper I've seen his commercials, that guys fucking hilarious.
@realDonaldTrump There's no stopping people on this earth from moving around. That's all there is to it.
@realDonaldTrump You figure it out mother fucker. God dammit...
@realDonaldTrump I don't think it'll be too much. Probably just about right. More Booster. I'm so pissed for some reason.
@realDonaldTrump they'll be doing a service to this country by helping you out in this department. Economy will benefit from more production
@realDonaldTrump your gonna need to talk to some of these people with all these available job openings. They'll have to willing too.
@realDonaldTrump No Welfare!
@realDonaldTrump Make no mistake. I don't feel sorry for them people.This ain't no pity party. If we take in some it will be to our benefit.
@realDonaldTrump Cause...
@realDonaldTrump after this situation is dealt with, that's it. We're threatening folks with gunfire if we have another huge caravan.
@realDonaldTrump Ooh...Tent city is going to be So pissed off once they get word.
@realDonaldTrump Along with Mexico.  At least half of the people are not going to have the option to turn down Mexico's offer again.
@realDonaldTrump these are all factory/ warehouse workers man. Your have gonna have to do some temporary working Visas too man.
@realDonaldTrump Yep, We obviously have too many jobs to fill. Most Americans won't agree w/ making a compromise to help any of those folks.
@realDonaldTrump this is fuct up. I hope you know we're gonna end up interviewing for folks that can at least speak broken English.
@realDonaldTrump which, they pretty much already have. Even though they're over a thousand miles away.
@realDonaldTrump All I know is if they don't keep calm they're pretty much shit out of luck. They don't want to be starting no shit now.
@realDonaldTrump wouldn't work.
@realDonaldTrump yeah.  We're not shooting at the ground in front of them or fucking with them, with bb guns until they leave. Too many.
@realDonaldTrump Just trying to keep it logical here. I got more, I'm sure! Even though I said that's all I have to say about that earlier.
@realDonaldTrump Lol! Naw man. That's a big population problem there. That needs to be held in some sort of control.
@realDonaldTrump I can see it, you're gonna have to partially give in. Is that what u call standing your ground? What a little bitch! Haha!ü§£
@realDonaldTrump hold on, let me get another cup of coffee.
@realDonaldTrump gotta keep 'em calm.
@realDonaldTrump Guess you could say I'm kind of coming to a realization. We need to make it clear, there will be order.
@realDonaldTrump hope they can understand the phrase, you win some you lose some. It will need to be a very organized process.
@realDonaldTrump back to drawing straws I guess. I don't know? They're playing a game of chance with their lives anyways.
@realDonaldTrump worst case scenario...we take in some &amp; force some to stay in Mexico.  It'll have to be an overall agreement.
@realDonaldTrump whether we or them like it or not.  Guess we'll see how demanding &amp; unruly they become. That's a lot of people.
@realDonaldTrump if we can successfully hold them back. After too long an orderly compromise will need to be met.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, I'm sure they'll all be in Mexico border side for a while. How long are they willing to sit?
@realDonaldTrump And we sure as hell ain't putting them all in tent city.
@realDonaldTrump I can tell 1 thing. Once they reach the border, some kind of compromise will need to be met. They ain't all coming in.
@realDonaldTrump there's no arguing that.  They are all very poor. On foot.
@realDonaldTrump Face it Don. Do You really think we can hold all them people back?  I'd say they are pretty damn determined.
@realDonaldTrump And that's a nonstop walk with no rest. https://t.co/jEDrnPtVsO
@realDonaldTrump Ole Evil Robert over here...Is just so harsh.  Tough words for tough times.
@realDonaldTrump Sometimes... you got to do what you got to do. To set the record straight. Ok. Now, that's all I have to say about that.
@realDonaldTrump I know, touchy sensitivitie situation. Don't hurt anybody...how would that make us or you look to the world?
@realDonaldTrump I thought proud Americans came together and stood tough as a country? Or did we turn into a bunch of sensitive pussies?
@realDonaldTrump what kind of example does that set?
@realDonaldTrump But, if we let masses of people from other countries enter Our country at their will now.
@realDonaldTrump And. I'd almost say they were pretty confident of that supposed fact. I'm not really 1 to try &amp; promote violence.
@realDonaldTrump Ya see, those people think we're not gonna do a damn thing about it. Because we're too worried about anyone getting hurt.
@realDonaldTrump Or, do we not care about our land anymore? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza we'll see what happens. Right?
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza that is, IF...we do not stand our ground and protect this American soil which we hold so sacred.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza if the American people have any sense of pride, they will not provide a damn thing for those caravan people.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza All I have to say about it. In due time I will watch &amp; read about how the situation had unfolded. I'm sure.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza but... sometimes you got to send a message in bullets to get a very strong point across.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza And no, I'm not particularly for shooting unarmed people. Guess that could really not be a good thing.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza But, when it comes to protecting our country...gunfire has never failed to make a strong statement.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza I know it sounds unorthodox and Inhumanely wrong to all those softies everywhere.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza It's just a question of how far we're willing to go.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza So what's the master plan on the border?  There's no doubt about it going to be a fight.
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza I didn't know you were into Baseball Don?
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza I wanna see how fast I can pitch. And hit a ball. It's been a very long time. No. I haven't been keeping up.
@CBSNews what's $20?
@CBSNews 8, 13, powerball on a different set.
@JudgeJeanine we will provide nothing for those people. He is definitely right about it being a fight.
@JudgeJeanine Oh Jesus...
@BrookeBCNN @PittsburghPG I missed it all.
@RobinLawler3 @RepJeffries I am pretty sure the situation was addressed during the event.
@RobinLawler3 @RepJeffries I'm pretty sure there's a big difference between the cuban Missile Crisis and a shooting by a crazed individual.
Only cause I just heard it as an intro on the local radio channel playing in the background. https://t.co/cM8NsKwDkE
@SenFeinstein rifle.
@SenFeinstein let me guess. It couldn't have been 1 of those pointed 22 round rifles, right? That are much more deadly than an other older..
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Oh, typo. Human Life.
@RepJeffries lets not help promote anymore hatred of any kind Hakeem. Even if it is this so-called 2 way party player hatin'.
@RepJeffries your thoughts and feelings on the current situation.
@RepJeffries you know what I think. If you were in the same position as Don, you would've taken advantage of the opportunity to Express...
@RepJeffries So maybe in light of current events at hand could have caused a rescheduling.
@RepJeffries Oh, cut that shit out. Yes, I know it...a rally. Butt Remember...scheduled.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump there's a difference &amp; people within their our races can see it very clearly.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump you don't realize it until you see a Mexican that grew up in Mexico hate on an Americanized Mexican person.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump We may never get over it, because it is ingrained in our history.  Racism against very same races exists in all races.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump there's not a whole lot we can do, Besides to make sure we teach each other &amp; our children that we are all our equals.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump the racism that everyone keeps saying is still very much alive.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I'd like to think we as people all around the world, have overcome this type of inhumane behavior.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I know it, Fucking terrible...such disregard for the value human like.	Sicko racist Mother Fucker.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I know, now is not a good time to be joking around.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Y'all notice how quiet King's been about the fucking god damn Jews shooting?
@CharlizeAfrica @Everytown Oh. And Marty Mcfly!
@CharlizeAfrica @Everytown who are all those people? I only recognize the guy from tremors.
@foxandfriends @RealCandaceO it ain't nothing but bullshit.
@foxandfriends @RealCandaceO tell 'em Candie...a lot of us don't like it when other black folks pull the race card.

@CNN those damn cell phone tower pings. I seen a driver a while back, hemmed up in the scale house. Troopers were looking at a print out...
@tedcruz s	So remember folks. If it drives...move it.
@tedcruz I-35 in Dallas. Loop 12 area.
@tedcruz watching cars hauling ass over the hill plowing into that car that hit me.
@tedcruz their car was smashed under my Ice cream truck. I dragged the car for a minute then it let go. Then i sat over on the shoulder...
@tedcruz the guy said something in Spanish to the driver and they saw a hole and took it. Right down the off ramp.
@tedcruz so I ran against traffic like a dumbass up to there car &amp; and said whoa wait a minute buddy.
@tedcruz I said let me get my insurance &amp; I came back and they were gone. I looked down the road and they were getting into another car.
@tedcruz I did that once when some Mexicans did a hit and run on me and almost got ran over. Ended up being a 5 car pile up.
@tedcruz get yourself killed.
@tedcruz don't sit there like an Idiot choking up the whole freeway.  And don't get out in the middle off the Interstate.  That's how you...
@tedcruz plus there's signs that say, accident.  Move it off the road. Something like that. If the car still drives, get it off the road.
@tedcruz y'all know what the 1 thing I like about Houston is. How quickly they yank the cars off the Interstate when there's a wreck.
Hell yeah! Taco Smell Tonight!
So I'm on I-70 in Kansas.  Pretty smooth.  See, people in cars don't appreciate this kind of shit. Not even a thought in their mind.

@SecNielsen @DHSgov See. She fuct up too Don.  Lol!
@SecNielsen @DHSgov Kirstjen. Why did you tell everyone to come to a port of entry? So they could come to tent city?

@realDonaldTrump Love's...Pueblo.
@realDonaldTrump I'm going to bed. Wake up bout 5 &amp; hit the shower. Mountain time.
@realDonaldTrump we're gonna have to get real meticulous.
@realDonaldTrump within a certain distance of the border/ ports of entry needs to be set to off limits. Unless, you've been cleared.
@realDonaldTrump from both sets of government.
@realDonaldTrump eventually...
@realDonaldTrump we're gonna have this set up to where folks gotta get clearance just to be able to meet each other at the border.
@realDonaldTrump you know why? Cause being able to walk is cool. People like walking.
@realDonaldTrump if you shoot enough feet, they'll eventually just showing up.

@SarahKSilverman @ilyamerica and especially if 1 climbed up on top of whatever fence/ wall there is. Right in the fucking foot.
@SarahKSilverman @ilyamerica I'd open fire on their feet as soon as they got anywhere near the border.
@SarahKSilverman @ilyamerica we ain't giving in. They just all wanna come in, Just for the hell of it. Refugees...my ass.
