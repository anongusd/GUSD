@RepJeffries Now that all this is been proved fake- you want another to do another fake speech- I’ll pass!

@jewelwickershow If you feel the need to add “a specific color” to a group or profession you are speaking about, then you are feeding the problem, not the solution! #diversity https://t.co/Mjbfla32b0
@JayeNewton @TheLeakSpeaks @dayyjones Amen! Remember, If you need to add “a specific color” before the name of a group, you’re the problem,  not the solution! https://t.co/JTE6k0Z7o6
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Then DO your job! It’s your fault @SpeakerPelosi #PelosiShutDown
@realDonaldTrump Congress should allocate funding, the leaders of Homeland Security &amp; Border Patrol should have the decision on how it is spent!
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Exactly- NO person deserves to be attacked! Including the President! Make your words match your actions.
@SpeakerPelosi Is this True? https://t.co/kbKJtULmfU
@SpeakerPelosi Is this true? https://t.co/kbKJtULmfU
@tedlieu @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump The problem today is there is too much name calling &amp; vague info.  Be the change- Be who America wants!
@realDonaldTrump We know you did what you needed to do with clear expectations set in place! Great job!
@EviemaRee777 @tedlieu @DavidBrodyCBN No- Colton, The Bachelor 😂😂
@EviemaRee777 @tedlieu @DavidBrodyCBN The real winner is Colton 😂
@PattyMurray I urge BOTH parties to compromise and stop playing games! The finger pointing must stop! Lead by example!
@tedlieu @DavidBrodyCBN The sad thing here- this is not a game. You were voted to represent the people that elected you, not to play games. @tedlieu
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Solution: Allocate $$ for Border Security.  Allow Customs &amp; Border Control to use funds to better security. Could be a wall in one place, additional staffing in another, and technology in a different place. Take the word “Wall” out!
@SRRieling @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP He won the election on border security to decrease illegal drug trade, sex trafficking , illegal immigration and the extreme drain on American resources &amp; American Citizens. Parties need to agree &amp; work together.  Extremists cause divide and hate! @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi
@chatdragon @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP The majority of America are moderates! There is about to be an uprising and those who are extremists (Republicans and Democrats) are about to be ousted. @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr
@nadya_kasyanova @SenWarren @girlsreallyrule @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Maybe the house &amp; Senate should donate their salaries to pay the federal workers since there is zero effort and only finger pointing happening instead of true bi-partisan cooperation &amp; negotiations. @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump
@kathismoak @Lizbeth9753 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Wow!
Solution: Allocate $$ for Border Security.  Allow Customs &amp; Border Control to use funds to better security. Could be a wall in one place, addition staffing in another, and technology in a different place. Take the word “Wall” out! @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @LindseyGrahamSC
@VivintHome @rudygobert27 @CJC9BOSS @utahjazz @NBA This is seriously the most fraudulent company I have ever worked with. We called in December to lower our bill, their solution: 1 month of complete lies and 20 hours of wasted time still with no result! #avoidthisSCAM #ScamAlert
