@joshtpm @kombiz Kombiz's last point about signaling to other spoilers that there are costs, enforcing party loyalty I guess, makes a good deal of sense to me.
@kombiz @joshtpm that's interesting. smart point
@joshtpm @ralphnf1 right and that's what I find kind of knee-jerkish. it could. it also might not. so much energy these days around instant opinions.
@kombiz @joshtpm as in a way to close ranks and avoid more of a circular firing squad at this particular moment?
@ralphnf1 @joshtpm sure, that's fair. But it seems like a rush to judgment to conclude that his candidacy would ensure a Trump win. I could be wrong.
@kombiz @joshtpm sure I get that -- I just think he might take plenty of support from Trump too
@joshtpm if the main objection is that Schultz will be a spoiler, but the sources of this consensus are political amateurs, maybe that should downgrade the seriousness of the argument imo

@JonesChrisA that "base" of people who are fine with compromise are non-primary voters. you need to find a way to make the primary a process that produces candidates for them as much as for the primary electorate
@JonesChrisA hard to do that without reforming our politics to give parties more say over who they nominate, ie rebalance the primary process to give party leaders some say. NO ONE wants to hear this but you have to change incentive structures and that's how
reality check: most Americans would be fine with a compromise of some sort on the shutdown. but both R's and D's are so captive to their base voters that there's more incentive to stand off for now. that's a fundamental problem with our politics.

@EWErickson and we now find ourselves ‚Äî w all that as a backdrop ‚Äî in a razor close election where Kemp is in charge of the vote totals and there is no auditable paper trail bc he has not modernized the system
@EWErickson I‚Äôm happy to press on that story and revisit it. But there are often plausible-sounding explanations for much of this. What lends weight to the Abrams side of the argument imo is the historical consistency with which blacks have faced obstacles to voting &amp; gaining power
RT @colincampbell: Kemp claims victory in Georgia, prompting threat of legal action from Abrams, via @jonward11 https://t.co/8s6FYkINy1
@EWErickson And as to my characterization in that story, it's entirely factual. The Associated Press found in October that 53,000 registrations had been put into pending status by Kemp's "exact match" policy, and that most of them were registrations for African-Americans.
@EWErickson And then there are all kinds of red flags in Kemp's past. Partisan statements of concern about the number of minority voters being registered, his investigations of minority groups and in Quitman County, his refusal to switch to machines with a paper trail. The list goes on
@EWErickson But since then, in learning more about Kemp's history, and history in the South, there's a lot of evidence that these kinds of complexities are intentional. Carol Anderson's book "One Person, No Vote" makes this case powerfully. I'd encourage you to read it.
@EWErickson Erick, I've followed this issue since 2014 when I went down to Georgia to cover the last dispute between Abrams and Kemp. At the time, the furthest I could conclude was that the process was too confusing and complicated. https://t.co/IT4fTXniDT

Maybe Trump crowds at other rallies have done this, but I'd never heard a crowd do it anywhere, ever. They started chanting "six more years" near the end of the Macon rally.
But also, the #GAGOV race is an epic w/historic racial undertones, &amp; Trump loves to go where the action is. He did a riff today about how he "always insisted on having an odd number in the debate bc I wanted to be center stage" &amp; how even after 2016 he "never left center stage."
Why did Trump go to Georgia? If Dems win there, it creates a model for them throughout the South. https://t.co/U4wdJvy4Re
Trump, today in GA: 	"There have never been crowds like this in the history of politics."	"America now has the best economy in the history of our country."	"This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country, maybe ever. There‚Äôs never been anything like this."

@WillAisNumber24 @QuenaGonzalez completely wrong. look at the NYT for example. look at what they put out every day. it's as rigorous a process as you will find anywhere in the world, and it produces stellar work day in and day out. it is not perfect, of course. it is, however, outstanding, in the whole.

@QuenaGonzalez I agree it preceded him. But i disagree he taps into it. More like, he pours lighter fluid all over it and makes is 10x worse
@QuenaGonzalez yes, and this is a big deal because the body of work by mainstream media institutions is solid. this kind of fact-checking against Trump is meaningless bc most of what he says is the same, detached (often intentionally &amp; maliciously) from reality
@QuenaGonzalez self-inflicted to some degree of course. but no comparison imo to a president who promotes conspiracy theories, tells lies or falsehoods more often than not, incites violence, and even last night couldn't bring himself to lead but rather continued attacking the media.

Kemp mentions Abrams wanting single-payer health care in his closing statement. Seems to be just making that up? I've not seen any kind of proposal like that from her.
Abrams pivots to her focus on rural Georgia as often as possible. Kemp's main pivot is to say Abrams wants the government to take over health care, wants to raise taxes, and wants undocumented immigrants to vote for her
"20 seconds on your education plan" -- that's just a joke. Neil Postman save us.
pretty eye-opening that Abrams gives her most forceful answer on expanding Medicaid of the night, and Kemp doesn't even raise his hand to request time to rebut her.
Purely on command of facts and information, on specificity of plans for solving problems, and on ability to make the case, there's no comparison between Kemp and Abrams. Abrams a far superior debater.
on question of jobs in rural Georgia, Abrams says expanding Medicaid will bring jobs, stabilize economy and attract new business. Kemp says no to that, touts rural program but gives no specifics. Libertarian candidate says need more ag crops, specifically hemp (of course!)
Kemp not exactly giving a strong showing. Moderators give him a chance to rebut Abrams, and he says, "I think I've already rebutted" and kind of mumbles something

@conncarroll not really: "The golden age of the voluntary association is over, thanks to the automobile, the television, and the two-income household, among other culprits."
"Volunteerism, church attendance, and social-media participation are not schools for self-government; they do not inculcate the habits and rituals of democracy. And as young people participate less in democratically run organizations, they show less faith in democracy itself."

@KlausMarre Ah right
@KlausMarre Were you Senate staff?
The part of the statue where McCain pointed said, "WHO KNEW NO GLORY BUT HIS COUNTRY'S GOOD." (end)
McCain is walking around Indiana Plaza, asking his staff where to go, and singing the circus song: "Do do do do do do do do do do." And then he points at the Stephenson Grand Army of the Republic Memorial there, and says, "That's a pretty cool logo." (5)
I was just reading my notes, and noticed something. When we got out of the car in Indiana Plaza, his staff weren't sure where the event was.   (4)
This was the interview where he called Ted Cruz and Rand Paul "wackobirds" btw (3)
But his way of interacting with junior staffers in the car ride took me by surprise. Cursing, mock berating them -- all very lighthearted but very unusual. But on the way out the office there was a lot of warmth between McCain and staff as they said good night. (2)
Many reporters spent time with John McCain. I had an hour or so with him in 2013. We did a 40-minute interview in his office, and then I rode with him to an event downtown. I have never seen any public figure treat his staff with such affection (1)

That said, $44M for Trump to $28M for Clinton is not a nothing disparity in spending on Facebook. But the Clinton retort might be that much of that Trump $ was spent on raising $$ in a way that was more expensive/inefficient than their own fundraising. (4)
The paper also says that GOP ads were "better leveraged Facebook‚Äôs ability to optimize for outcomes.‚Äù But disparity in fundraising (RNC) vs persuasion (Clinton) shows 2 groups were after different outcomes &amp; fundraising outcomes much easier 2 measure than persuasion outcomes (3)
‚Ä¶ take this ‚Äúwhite paper‚Äù from Facebook. It says RNC effort was ‚Äúmore complex‚Äù than Clinton. But 84% of Trump budget was spent on fundraising. Almost half of Clinton‚Äôs went to persuasion. Yet persuasion is more complicated than fundraising, right? (2) https://t.co/nfx7Uv7ah4
