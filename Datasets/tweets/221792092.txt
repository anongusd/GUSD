I believe we can debate important policy without using offensive, painful stereotypes.
No member of Congress is asked to swear allegiance to another country. Throughout history, Jews have been accused of dual loyalty, leading to discrimination and violence, which is why these accusations are so hurtful.
Lawmakers must be able to debate w/o prejudice or bigotry. I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel. I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful.
Gross islamophobic stereotypes - like those about @IlhanMN recently featured on posters in WVA - are offensive and have no place in political discourse. Anti-Semitic tropes that accuse Jews of dual loyalty are equally painful and must also be roundly condemned.

When women control the spacing &amp; the # of children they will have, there is a ripple effect that benefits all of society. Cutting funding to these programs undermines U.S. international development goals, hurts women &amp; girls, and is, quite simply, an ineffective and bad decision.
Year after year, we must remind our Republican colleagues about the critical importance of international reproductive health services. And once again, the majority has severely cut funding to these life-saving programs.
I support @RepTimRyan‚Äôs amendment to restore funding for bilateral family planning and reproductive health efforts to the FY 2018 level.
Because the US neither can -- nor should -- provide assistance to every country, our partnership with UNFPA extends our reach to millions more women than we could alone.... Today‚Äôs global challenges are enormous.  The US must not cut itself off from its most effective partners.
UNFPA not only provides family planning services; it leads efforts to eliminate the practice of sex-selection; prevent gender-based violence; and provide safe delivery kits for childbirth.
I support @RepBarbaraLee‚Äôs amendment to FY19 SFOPS appropriations bill.  UNFPA works in 3x as many countries as USAID, including many places where no other service providers are available.
The elimination of reproductive health from these annual reports indicates the U.S. is retreating from our historic role as a leader on women‚Äôs equality.
These annual reports provide lawmakers and policy experts with critical information about how countries are respecting the human rights ‚Äì including reproductive rights ‚Äì of the most marginalized populations.

We cannot, under any circumstance, allow this policy to be codified into law, as it will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, including those who are unable to access services due to stigma, poverty, violence, or HIV status.
This destructive policy endangers our most successful global health programs.  While we are just beginning to learn the impact of the expanded policy, the alarm bells are already ringing.
In closing, my amend doesnt change long-standing prohibition on funding for abortions.  It simply allows aid recipients the ability to use their own resources, within the legal constraints of their countries, as they deem necessary to best serve men, women, and children in need.
The lives saved from our work in maternal health, HIV, malaria or other diseases should be a source of pride for every U.S. citizen.  Inserting the #GGR into all global health programs will diminish effectiveness of this work &amp; reduce our country‚Äôs role as a global health leader.
My amendment does not change any of the current provisions in law that restrict the use of family planning funds. It would simply ensure that countries are setting their own health policies ‚Äì not the United States.
Under this expanded policy:	o Her doctor can‚Äôt have a factual convo about her health w/o worrying if even a simple convo would risk entire clinic‚Äôs funding.	o Her kids‚Äô doctors have to sign onto a policy regarding abortion before discussing handwashing or providing immunizations.
We have seen this in our travels.  When I was in Cambodia in 2001, I met a woman, thin as a rail, when she came into a U.S. funded clinic with six or seven malnourished children trailing behind her.  And she was noticeably pregnant with her next...
One provider has estimated that approximately 2 million women will be denied reproductive health services as a result of the expanded policy.
We already know the Global Gag Rule, when only applied to family planning programs, hurts the health of men, women, and children. The expansion to all global health without knowing the precise impact is not only bad policy, it jeopardizes lives.
Meanwhile, mass confusion about the policy has led to a chilling effect, causing organizations to unnecessarily change or eliminate vital health services.
While the Administration is still ‚Äúassessing‚Äù the impact, reports indicate that thousands of women have lost access to services from the most experienced providers who have been forced to close their doors.
The Administration implemented this policy with NO analysis of its impact and has admitted there could be unanticipated effects.
It is unconscionable to tie up $8.8 billion in global health assistance by inserting abortion politics into activities such as lifesaving nutrition programs and efforts to prevent and treat malaria, TB, and HIV.
House bill shortchanges basic family planning &amp; health services, leaving women vulnerable to preventable diseases &amp; weakening their ability to achieve econ stability for themselves &amp; families.  Particularly egregious is expansion of   GGR to ALL global health assistance.
Offering my amendment now. It would strike the expanded Global Gag Rule as well as the ban on funding for the United Nations Population Fund.

In the FY 2018 omnibus, Congress rejected the dangerous riders and funding levels before us today. Democrats cannot support a bill if it would mean turning our backs to the world‚Äôs most vulnerable women or the looming threat of climate change.
If we are not successful, I will regrettably have to oppose the bill at this stage.
Over the 28 years I‚Äôve been privileged to work on these issues, I have always tried to keep contentious issues out of the bill. In the end, D votes will be needed to pass. I will offer amendments today with many of my colleagues to remove the controversial riders from the bill...
But the mark would slash investments in bilateral family planning, codify the Global Gag Rule and its expansion into ALL global health, and prohibit U.S. contributions to UNFPA. These policies hurt vulnerable women and severely decrease the efficiency of U.S. aid programs.
I find it hard to believe we‚Äôre still arguing over importance of intl. family planning &amp; reproductive health programs. Studies show access 2 modern contraceptives not only prevents unwanted pregnancies, abortions, &amp;  maternal deaths, it‚Äôs also key to gender equality &amp; econ growth
Unfortunately, this bill contains a number of short-sighted poison pills, from denying climate change to renewed attacks on women‚Äôs health.  These onerous riders would make the world less safe, hurt the most vulnerable, and reduce the effectiveness of U.S. development.
Further, this bill contains funding for the International Organizations and Programs account, recognizing that U.S. support for UN agencies gives taxpayers the best return on investment.
On the positive side, this bill maintains unwavering, bipartisan support and robust funding for our close ally Israel, and provides funding for other critical partners, such as Jordan, and for development goals in many of the world‚Äôs poorest countries.
We would be more secure and garner more goodwill if, instead of the Republican plan to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on Trump‚Äôs border wall and deportation force, we increased our investments in diplomacy and other security assistance in this bill.
For example, the unparalleled refugee crisis, numerous countries on the brink of famine, and ongoing threats to U.S. national security demand a more robust response from U.S. global leadership.
While the bill before us avoids the Administration‚Äôs irresponsible FY 2019 proposal to cut our diplomatic and development efforts, with an $18 billion increase in discretionary spending for FY 2019, we could, and should, invest more than 1% of the budget in our overseas efforts.
While I appreciate bipartisan process, I‚Äôm disappointed in allocation &amp; several policy provisions in FY19 foreign aid bill. It‚Äôs funded @ same level as FY18, should be at least equal to Senate‚Äôs increase of $400m to recognize we can‚Äôt further risk US leadership abroad.

If the Speaker were serious about addressing the DACA crisis, he would allow a vote on the bipartisan legislation that‚Äôs been underway for months, not just on extreme partisan measures and legislation drafted without Democratic input. 		https://t.co/Pkr9fLn05z
I withheld offering any amendments today but will offer what I hope will be bipartisan changes at full committee. https://t.co/fCo7NDM5kJ
As it stands, this bill would force US to retreat from its global leadership. Dems can‚Äôt support a bill if it would mean turning our backs to world‚Äôs most vulnerable women or looming threat of climate change.
But bill would slash investments in bilateral family planning, codify GGR and its expansion into all global health, and prohibit US contributions to UNFPA. policies would hurt vulnerable women and severely decrease efficiency of US aid programs.
Study after study has shown access to modern contraceptives not only prevents unwanted pregnancies, abortions, and maternal deaths, it‚Äôs also key to gender equality and economic growth.
In 2018, I find it hard to believe we are still arguing over importance of international family planning and reproductive health programs.
Bill denies climate change reality &amp; would ban US contributions to Green Climate Fund &amp; continue to be silent on impact of climate change on poverty and climate. While Admin may be comfortable dismantling US leadership on climate change, this strategy is reckless &amp; shortsighted.
Unfortunately bill contains a number of shortsighted poison pills that would make the world less safe, hurt most vulnerable, and reduce effectiveness of US development.
Bill maintains unwavering, bipartisan support and robust funding for our close ally Israel and provides funding for other critical partners, and for development goals in many of world‚Äôs poorest countries.
We could be more secure and garner more goodwill if, instead of GOP plan to waste hundreds of millions on Trump‚Äôs border wall and deportation force, we increased investments in diplomacy and other security assistance in this bill.
House allocation for this bill is same as FY18 but should at least be equal to Senate‚Äôs increase of $400M to recognize we can‚Äôt further risk US leadership abroad by shortchanging foreign aid and diplomacy.
With an $18B increase in discretionary spending for FY19, we could - and should - be investing more than 1% of the budget on our overseas efforts.
While bill avoids Admin‚Äôs irresponsible FY19 proposal to cut our diplomatic &amp; dev efforts, we should be doing more @ a time of unparalleled refugee emergencies, numerous countries on brink of famine, &amp; ongoing threats to US natl. security.
I appreciate the process but am disappointed in the allocation &amp; several policy provisions.

Flynn‚Äôs conversation with the Russian gov't was not simply unethical‚Äîit was a potentially illegal act that undermined our national security.
Instead @POTUS appointed him National Security Advisor, a decision that appears to have resulted in Flynn subverting American foreign policy
With such close ties to Vladimir Putin &amp; Russia, Michael Flynn should have been disqualified from any job with access to classified material
If @POTUS wants to be a leader for all Americans, he must put security above politics &amp; remove Mr. Bannon from the NSC &amp; his staff.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve cosponsored H.R. 804, which would prohibit Mr. Bannon‚Äôs appointment to the NSC.
As Chairman of Breitbart, Mr. Bannon espoused right-wing, anti-Semitic, &amp; xenophobic views that aren‚Äôt in line with American values.
Let me be clear: Mr. #Bannon is woefully unqualified to serve as a White House official, let alone on the #NSC or the Principals Committee.

Let‚Äôs work together again to replace the automatic spending cuts that are hurting jobs &amp; our economy w/a balanced budget plan.
Sequester cuts are forcing impossible choices for families. Should moms quit their jobs when their children lose access to Head Start?
Lowey: Sequester cuts mean 57,265 fewer children in Head Start; 18,000 staff members have suffered pay cuts or lost jobs.
Lowey: Every $1 of investment in medical research at NIH generates $2.21 in local economic growth.
Lowey: Senseless sequester cuts mean $1.55B less for NIH to conduct groundbreaking medical research.
Lowey: GOP government shutdown, threat of default cost $24 billion in economic activity &amp; 120K jobs.
Lowey: Our priority for a budget plan must be to continue to grow the economy, create jobs &amp; strengthen the middle class.
