@BrianKempGA You can do better, Georgia.		https://t.co/rB2ICuq2DT
@RepKevinBrady Democrats won't raise my taxes at all. They'll raise YOUR taxes with the type of income YOU receive. Enough of your trickle down BS. It has failed time and time again.

@JulioGo764 @senorrinhatch Ahh, the good ole George Soros bit. If he's writing so many checks, why can't the GOP get their hands on any of them? Seems likely it's just another conspiracy theory you rubes bought into. Pretty funny watching you all get your panties in a wad over the Soros boogeyman tho! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
@senorrinhatch "Mob"? I think you mean "majority".
@Mike_InIllinois @RhondaBrami @samfraulino @VdubTDI @dfalls38 @charliekirk11 Weird, all the top results I get show Trump outpacing Obama on travel/golf spending. Maybe Google is fudging the search results for Conservatives. Yah, I bet that's it. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
@Mike_InIllinois @RhondaBrami @samfraulino @VdubTDI @dfalls38 @charliekirk11 Always check your sources and check your sources sources. I learned that in elementary school, but it's better late than never.
@RepJimBanks Wow, your own analysis supports your own talking points? Shocking.
@Mike_InIllinois @RhondaBrami @samfraulino @VdubTDI @dfalls38 @charliekirk11 Obama golfed 333 times in 8 years. Trump has golfed AT LEAST 148 times in not even 2 years. At this rate Trump is golfing more than 2x as much as Obama.		And yes, your CNBC article is using a Judicial Watch study as proof. At least read your BS before posting it.
@GOPChairwoman Wow, the #DefyHistory hash tag happens to be trending like crazy in St Petersburg. Strange... https://t.co/LcOgWKlpR2
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Take it from the guys who learn their propaganda game from the best! https://t.co/eSMusQSPpH
@Mike_InIllinois @samfraulino @VdubTDI @dfalls38 @RhondaBrami @charliekirk11 Wait wait wait... you're using a finding by JUDICIAL WATCH to prove that Obama spent more than Trump golfing?!?! JUDICIAL WATCH?! You realize the problem here, surely? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

@charliekirk11 Trump also cheated on his taxes to the tune of half a BILLION. Pretty easy to turn down 6 figures per year from the same government you ripped off for 9 figures.
@JohnCornyn Gee, who was the asshole who was doing champagne toasts for this?!

@Andrea42685492 @JFNYC1 @realDonaldTrump I would assume he's about 6 months to a year old, considering he remembers the embassy move but conveniently forgets the Charlottesville march.
@scarr422 @JFNYC1 @KyleKashuv @realDonaldTrump I'm old enough to remember when GOP talking points didn't parrot Russian bots and vice versa https://t.co/0xVQE2JIXx
@JFNYC1 @realDonaldTrump Is that all you're old enough to remember? Just curious.

@shelton_frances Sounds like something #TheDerpState would say. Did you believe there was a pedophile ring on the surface of Mars too? I bet you did. ðŸ˜‚

@RoyBlunt @FoxNews @MariaBartiromo This was all about protecting Trump from the Mueller investigation. If it wasn't, @GOP would've cut Kavanaugh off weeks if not months ago. The reason they didn't should disturb any freedom loving American. We'll all know why soon enough!
