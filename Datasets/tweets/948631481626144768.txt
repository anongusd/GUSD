@Celeste_pewter Divided not decided
@Celeste_pewter Just my opinion but our words have consequences and we need to come together and let the major caucuses weed out the unpopular candidates as they usually do.
@Celeste_pewter It is the oldest trick in the book and one that we are working really hard not to fall for. I really respect your opinions and follow you for your activism. But strongly encourage you to not diss Dems that are running in the primary.
@Celeste_pewter Only 1 woman ran in 2008. That was HRC. I agree it‚Äôs a very critical election cycle, but the right is counting on us to be decided with these candidates to isolate their supporters and force them to be less engaged.
@Celeste_pewter Historically many people enter the primary race. In 2008, 8 people ran. While you may think it‚Äôs vanity, I will challenge you to not be gaslighted by conservative media. The fact that there‚Äôs already 5 women running is remarkable.
@choo_ek Meanwhile the president is really ripping children away from their parents. Get woke, folks.
I appreciate Rep Boyle‚Äôs sincerity here but you don‚Äôt need to give this man credit for anything. He brags about assaulting women, he calls people names, he hijacked the govt, and his charity cheated people. Don‚Äôt give him your time. https://t.co/NcnVkuJcKA

@Celeste_pewter Thank you &amp; I respect your thoughts as well. I definitely see your point. For me, the division in the party during 2016 was so vast it left a lot of folks disenchanted &amp; unengaged. If you look at conservative politics they don‚Äôt experience the same divisions

It was the closest I've ever been to my dad, campaigning around Nevada for Barack Obama but having daily discussions with my dad about the integrity of John McCain. The world will lose a light as he will pass on to a better place.
And said, "You are perhaps right beta (my child). Like I said, it is a hard decision, remember when you are old enough to vote, look at policy and values in those running for office, the responsibility of this great nation is up to all of us and the POTUS."
"While Mr. McCain, will work towards issues that will be important perhaps later on."  Very confused, I said to my father, "I really don't understand Baba, it sounds like both will get to issues but in different ways." My dad kneeled down to my level...
"This is tough, both are very good men, they have good hearts." And I said to my dad, "So why are you voting and working so hard for .@BarackObama?" He replied, "It is a matter of policies. See Mr. Obama will work towards the issues important to our family...

Please .@GOP you have to contain this situation to save our democracy. No more tweets and statements. ACT NOW. Fail to do anything &amp; history will judge your harshly. Your legacy will be remembered by your inability to stand up to tyranny. #ImpeachNow
Trump is killing our democracy. He loves Putin, rips on Americans who exercise their 1st amendment rights, weakening the military by removing patriotic soldiers &amp; discussing cutting funds for the stupid wall. Discredits the DOJ.

We just want to help patients, study and cure disease, and educate the public. Medicine is not what is was 20 years ago. They salaries have dropped, mid-level providers arrived, payer protocols dictate decision making... 3/
Educating ourselves, and acquiring training. To say it‚Äôs a sacrifice is reservation. However, no physician feels that way. We are honored to be involved in patients‚Äô lives. We are our toughest critics &amp; do not expect recognition. 2/

@choo_ek It‚Äôs sad but all those are true stories. So bottom line, racism occurs on all fronts and being a physician does not make us immune to bigotry.
@choo_ek Those who make accusations of falsehood about this issue are complicit and unwilling to accept reality. As a Pakistani-American, I‚Äôve had patients ask for another physician, or casually mention racist slurs to me, or tell me they are Trump supporters.
@RosenforNevada I trained at the Univ of NV Sch of Med &amp; know the barriers to healthcare coverage &amp; access  for many Nevadans. Yet Dean Heller voted for a repeal without an acceptable replacement of the ACA. Heller‚Äôs voting record &amp; party ideology is dangerous to Nevadans.
