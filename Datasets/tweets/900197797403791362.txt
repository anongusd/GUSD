@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway If Democrats want to prove they are for border security, then quit talking and start legislating because the Democratic Party itself already has a terrible record on securing our border and immigration as a whole
@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway If Democrats are truly for border security then they need to renounce their support for sanctuary cities, deport those who break our laws, and vote on actual border security measures like barriers, technology, and mandatory e-verify
@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway Also if Democrats are for border security and are anti illegal immigration, then why do they overwhelmingly support sanctuary cities? Cities that shield those who illegally enter our country, breaking the law, from deportation?
@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway Nancy Pelosi herself is probably the weakest Democrat on border security. Since 2006, she has voted down almost every border security bill. I find it hard to believe that she supports border security while voting against nearly all border security bills in the past https://t.co/FMTXJMz79d
@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway We can have technology and new resources on the border but we need barriers, E-Verify mandatory for all employers, Kate‚Äôs Law to make sure repeat law breakers go to jail and get deported.
@CjohnsonNV @jamesallen @MZHemingway Then why have they voted down bills making E-Verify mandatory? Kate‚Äôs Law which increases penalties on those who illegally re-enter the country? Why do they vote down barriers on the border which helps our border patrol agents do their jobs easier?
