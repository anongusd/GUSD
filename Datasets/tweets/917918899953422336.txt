@trumpbestprezev @ProudPatriot24 @TexasHoney1965 @JacobAWohl Oh! I remember it from the ’70s when she worked for the ACLU! I forgot about this case. So wrong of her but still she is a a great justice. We all make mistakes and grow to learn from. Trump’s state dept stamped visa allowing men to bring child bride so that is now and not 70’s.

@m0naIisa @Moonstone23 @JonLemire Exactly! I got this from few here on Twitter. My neighbor a rabid fan said to help my family out while my hubby was not getting paid for work I needed to get another job and not wait for a handout in order to not use up all our saving. She added the wall was far more important.
@Moonstone23 @JonLemire That they do! Just Google it. I have been told we should have savings for days like this. I had to explain to one, my husband I should not have to use up all my saving because of this Trumpdown. I have been told Government workers like my hubby make too much and deserve this.

@ClaudiaB898 @AmyRTurci That is not how this works. You lose your job this way. My hubby can’t work under job while not getting paid. He has to work. He is considered essential. The furloughed ones can get unemployment but will have to pay it back. I am not sure if they are allowed to find other jobs.
@Baldy309 @AmyRTurci @ckkoch3 It is. TSA agents per what my hubby says do not make much as other parts of Dept of Homeland Security do. Where we are located they only work part-time. They already have other jobs to make ends. My heart breaks each time I drop hubby off. They are underpaid and overworked.
@AmyRTurci @PattyMurray That is so true! Hubby and I are using our saving to get by, his colleagues with TSA are calling in sick daily. Few are thinking of quitting he said.
