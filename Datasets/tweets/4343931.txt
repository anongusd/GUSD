In the end, people will still vote based on the economy, and how much gov they are willing to tolerate.
Let the Supreme Court decide this. Until then, it will just be a political football being kicked around by loudmouth pundits and hacks.
I'm not a scholar, so I don't know if it does or not. But it doesn't seem right for th gov to make churches go against their sacred beliefs.
Of course, it's not about contraception bans. It's about whether it violates the constitutional right to religious liberty.

Newt is trying to emulate Reagan. Whether or not he's succeeding is open for debate. #harharhar
The GOP trying to push their candidate on everyone gives credence to the non-voter argument that the system is rigged and useless.
Tired of this "electability" business. The best one is now out. We're stuck with what we got. Pick one or vote for O again.

I can personally attest that being nice often doesn't get you anywhere. This should be esp true in politics. He did what he had to do.
4 years ago, we were wondering if Obama was unelectable over Hillary, due to lack of experience. same deal, with different circumstances.
Newt won SC, as I predicted. Now we have a race. I don't think he's "unelectable" as others do. After all, he was elected many times before.
Getting the mop trimmed. First time since last summer.
Seen a question: Is the GOP racist, or homophobic? Geez, might as well ask how many times a day they beat their spouses...
There was a time not so long ago when being a philandering perv was a resum√© paddler when running for prez. üòÅ
So Newt's a philandering perv. Won't make much difference. Predicting he will win SC. Establishment will be crying and throwing things.
Crowd's all into this debate, too. Newt schooled the media as usual. Looks lonely without Perry.
The timing of the MU shutdown is uncanny. Gov is at odds with the people and must be put back in their proper place: a servant to the people

If this happens, O is so gone in November. Landslide. In flames. The economy cannot absorb this high an increase. So screwed, Myrtle.
Oil futures into summer are already zeroing in on $5 gasoline. This will stop what little economic recovery we have. We're screwed, Myrtle.

Probably not what he meant, but that's how it sounded. He's correct that we left too fast without securing the peace. May be all for nothing

22% reporting: Romney, Santorum, Paul tied at 23%. Newt 13%, Perry 10%, Bachmann 6%, huntsman 1%. Interesting.
1% precincts reporting. Santorum 1st with 26%. FNC projecting Bachmann will finish last.
I will say that the candidate with the best record has been largely ignored for superficial reasons.
Just realized I said I would endorse a candidate last month and never did. Oh well...
One hour, Iowa. Show us what you got. üá∫üá∏
Roughly 24 hours left. Go get 'em, tigers! üòú
Of course, Iowa is just the beginning. Those with the least money are in the worst shape long term.
2 days until Iowa. Looking for an upset; Paul could win, and/or stronger than expected showing by Perry or Bachmann. Stay unpredictable.
Skins finish 5-11. Should be a high draft pick in the spring. Need a franchise QB.
Watched Inception last night. Great flick. Gonna watch I Am Legend later.
Apparently they're rocking so hard they caused an earthquake in Japan. Wow.

He routinely used food as a weapon against his own people. People found dead in fields with grass stains in their mouths, bc of no food.
Instead, I will have a moment of silence for the two+ million innocents he allowed to starve to death in the cold during his gracious reign.
So I hear KJII funeral is on somewhere, and my first reaction is, "Who would want to watch that shit?" üíÄ

Winter begins at 12:30 am EST on Thursday. Central time and points west it begins tomorrow night.
Maybe some more of that crony capitalism is just around the corner. They know just the company to do it, too.
TM is dead anyway. They want to sell out.
AT&T/TM deal is dead. Okay, I want to hear plans from someone else to cover 97% of the country with 4G LTE in 3 years.... Still waiting...

Romney is really racking up endorsements. I don't think he's the best, but part of me is starting to concede that he will be the nominee.
It's been a quiet weekend. These long nights really bother me. Wed is the shortest day of the year, but earliest sunset occurred 1 week ago.
They all nailed it on Keystone and energy policy in general. It's far too important to this country to be a political football.
After 60 degrees the last two days, back to snow showers tomorrow. Ugh.
I will say that RP confirmed his place in the GOP as the crazy uncle who lives in the attic. Totally floored by his response on Iran. üò≥
I missed the first half of the debate so I'll have to catch the replay. In the meantime, reading some strongly opinionated tweets about it.
The ol' fuzz buster conked out on me. Hate driving around not getting a heads up on speed traps. üöìüö•
Government wants a national ban on use of cell phones and "all electronic devices" while driving. One-handed driving will be next. üöóüì±

I can see why people thru the centuries thought some dreams were from God. It was so vivid. Still feel like I was there. üòå
Church was packed. People sitting in floor. One minute the pastor was speaking, the next Trans-Siberian Orchestra was playing. lol
Haven't been there or seen these people in years. But it was present day setting.
Just had a dream I was at my old church. Seen and talked to pretty much everyone I knew. Got caught up on life. It seemed so real.
Maybe some are annoyed by his public displays of religion. But some are annoyed by this belittling of religious people. Nobody is harmed.
They can criticize his gameplay all they want, even though he's doing good. But you would think he's breaking the law w/ his JC shout outs.
Jesus is his thing. Leave him alone. It's amazing how much political correctness has permeated society without people realizing it.
I don't understand this hatred for Tebow. We still have freedom of religion. Tolerance is becoming a scarce commodity, all around.
Although I disagree that a failing in one area of your life means you will fail in every area of life. Everyone slips. Consider the whole.
Perry looked decent on FNS. I really think his biggest problem is the Texas accent. It reminds those snooty Northeasterners too much of GWB.
Can't believe yesterday was 5 years my father's been gone. Where does the time go?
Go ahead and lose the rest of them, "Skins. At this point I'm rooting for a high draft pick. üòú
But I like it... http://t.co/3gN7NVKs
Big Bad Moon's lookin' down on me tonight.
Perry and Bachmann might get a bump out of this. Otherwise, not much will change.
Turned out to be a decent debate last night. Problem is nobody watches these weekend debates, except for political geeks like us.
There's an undertone to these recent questions that I don't like. They're digging for a "Gotcha!" without being obvious. #IowaDebate
Interesting strategy Perry is using. Defending Newt instead of taking the obvious course.
Another debate tonight. Everyone seems like this one isn't important. The big one is Thursday.
Looking at Christmas lights again.

Latest polling shows Newt @38%, Mittens stalled @19%, Paul @14%, and Perry back up DD @11%. It's not over by a long shot. No panicking. üòö
Just when the Cain Train suspension seemed surreal enough, he apparently quoted Pok√©mon in his gbye speech. Well...that was a fun ride. üëΩ
Looks like its gonna be another rainy and foggy night. At least it's not snowing.
Considering the country is still falling apart, that's all he has left. Sad. Complete 180 from '08. üòí
This is a pattern I've seen from him over the last few months. Just never brought it up. His campaign will be based on envy and dividing.
I can't deal with Bam's speech. I'm so sick of hearing him blame certain people for all our problems. He's clearly no longer a uniter.
With so many debates left, we can't say Newt's got this. Except for 2 or 3 of them, they all still have a chance. It continues after Iowa.
This is the point they begin making "outrageous" comments to get attention and differentiate themselves from each other. May be fun soon.
There's already been what‚Äî12, 15 of them? They're starting to regurgitate the same Q & A. Guess its ok bc so few are yet paying attention.
The Donald is hosting a debate on an obscure channel. Why all the outrage? With the exception that there are too many debates, period.
Turning the ceiling fan on. It's that warm this morning. üòä #stayawaywinter
I don't know if Newt is the answer. He'll kick the crap out of Bam in the debates, but is debating all there is to being president?
Gonna be a long, rainy night. ‚òî‚òÅ
Several more debates left. 4 more weeks. There's still plenty of things that can happen.
Cain endorsing Newt is not surprising, but it still too early to endorse, IMO. Wait at least a couple more debates.
Got invited to a church Christmas dinner. Very full now. üòä
The weekend is going too fast. How can I want time to speed up for certain reasons (Boo winter) yet want it to creep by, at least today? üòè
It was sad watching baby turtles getting eaten by seagulls before they even made it to the ocean. üò¢
Watching this Oceans documentary on Starz on demand. There's some really funny looking but amazing creatures in there. Sea dragons do exist.
Anything you ever could have remotely done in the distant past will likely come out if you ever run for prez. That excludes most of us.
I don't know if HC really thought all of this stuff wouldn't come out eventually. Then again, we all know O really wasn't vetted properly.
In all fairness though, it's very possible for men and women to be just friends. I'll take his word for it unless more info comes out.
Cain's suspended his campaign today. Prolly means there are more friends of his out there that haven't come out yet.
Hangin out relaxing tonight. About to get some food.üç¥
Been playing Angry Birds Seasons all night. Time to take a break.
Decided I'm gonna endorse one of the candidates after the next debate. It's probably not hard to figure out who I have in mind. üòâ
They have shrunk the entire labor pool 3 million since 2008. If counted, real unem would be 11.6%. There's lies, damn lies, and statistics.
Also wonder how much stat tinkering is happening. Was a larger percentage of total labor pool discounted and made smaller?
Unemployment rate down to 8.6. Good news, but how many are temp holiday positions? Employers are prepared for	record predicted holiday rush.

December 1. First day of meteorological winter. 3 weeks til solar winter, and the shortest day of the year. Start countdown to longer days.
So far, his timing is great. Him and Perry are the only ones who will aggressively put the hooks to Bam, if nominated. Verbally, of course.
Gotta hand it to Newt. He's the new GOP star.the question is can he hang on for another 5 weeks. At least he's willing to debate a lot.
Gonna post my top 40 songs of the year over the next few days. üé§

I'm more pro decriminalization than legalization. There is a difference. It would take care of prison overcrowding overnight.
Why there is a slow nudge towards drug legalization: Government likes a more sedate and passive population. They could get away with more.

Somebody stole my dirty clothes hamper. Hope they have fun with it lol
Sucks the AT&T/T-Mobile deal is all but dead. I haven't seen anyone with a better plan to cover so many rural areas with 4G LTE in 2-3 yrs.
This mandatory drug testing of half the pop just won't work. Too many legal pitfalls, and somebody will get very rich off selling test kits.
So Newt want drug testing for anyone who gets money from the government. Does this include retirees who worked for years and smoke weed?

No, I don't smoke. Haven't smoked in years. It's ridiculous that drug laws view pot as dangerous as meth and crack. That's clearly not true.
Make it a controlled substance paralleling alcohol and prescription laws. Then tax the crap out of it. This cat's long been out of the bag.
Guess they forgot that the Feds still consider pt illegal. SC says federal law trumps state law, so it will be interesting for future of MM.

@candacecbure Perry and Newt. Cain seemed to disappear tonight. Romney is still there. Paul is always interesting. The rest don't matter.
Not too bad, even though I missed the first half.
Syria is almost incidental to Iran. By far the biggest problem in the ME. #cnndebate
Perry gave the best answer. We wouldn't be giving illegals as many freebies if they cannot get here in the first place. #cnndebate
Ron Paul is correct on the drug war. It is a waste of money. Legalizing pot would undercut the cartel profits overnight. #cnndebate

So far Perry sounds best. Much debate to go, though.

Exercising 1st amendment rights is one thing. Defecating on police cars and trashing the cities is quite another.
And furthermore, every opportunist politician who got in front of this movement owns it. These are your boys. We will remember.

I heard the national emergency alert featured Lady Gaga music. Just the thing America needs to stop, drop, and roll to.
I have a sudden urge to raid a @Dicks Sporting Goods on Black Friday.
Candy corn really hurts my teeth these days. Probably not good.
Anyway, happy vets day ;-)
It's 11/11/11. None of us will live to see 11/11/2111. I'm sure someone on that day will stumble on this tweet and think I was weird. #yep

RT @trscoop: I just went to Wendys, and the guy in the drive thru taking my money told me to vote for Herman Cain. He really likes Herma ...
At this point, could anyone blame #Perry for not showing up to the rest of the debates? lol
I haven't endorsed anyone yet. I get ticked at the unfairness of a 10 second brain fart counting for more than a 10+ year economic record.
Texas is the final frontier of growth and job creation in this horrible economy. That ought to count for something. #Perry
Despite his horrible debate skills, Perry has one of the best records of anybody there. I hope the GOP doesn't live to regret this piling on
In fairness, we all have brain farts. Gosh, I do that all the time.
See what I mean? lol #perryoops
Interesting debate, but I'm really souring on these formats. Specifically designed to get irrelevant 10 second sound bites for news loops.
Okay, I didn't notice anything different at 2. Did the test work?
"Breaker 1-9 for radio check." "Come back, Wilbur. You're breaking up on me."
First ever national emergency alert test today. If you had 30 seconds on every radio/TV station in the country, what would you say?
I can think of 1,000 other pressing issues this country faces than this crap. Pure distraction. Watch the other hand. #sumtinaintrite #Cain
These are personal issues, right? I mean, being a philandering horndog shouldn't affect how one governs, right?
If Cain survives this, then maybe he should be the nominee. The Clinton of the right. Teflon candidate.
Well...There goes the Jewish vote.  http://t.co/laFtYFOi
Is the next debate Wednesday night? We need more Lincoln-Douglas style debates. That was some good, substantive stuff right there. #2012
LILO serves six hrs of 30 day jail sentence, released due to overcrowding. Don't want that PB shoot to take longer than necessary, do we?
I love DST, where it stays daylight until 9:30 in June. Ppl who hate it r almost always morning ppl bc it's still daylight when they crash.
This time change takes awhile to get used to. I feel slow now.
The 'Skins stink it up again. Same pattern every year: start out decent, get everyone's hopes up, then implode. I must be a masochist.
So Pippa Middleton is supposed to be writing a book on party etiquette. I'd be interested if I could get in to her‚Äîparty, too.
Exactly one year until Election Day http://t.co/ewxLSQe3
Eating at a Mexican restaurant with an old friend this evening. Gotta load up on the free chips and salsa.
Here comes the weekend. One extra hour tomorrow night, too. #fallback
Is this politics, or a high drama? Oh, never mind... #2012 #GOP
ChAIN of blame: Cain===&gt; Perry ===&gt; Romney ===&gt; ?
I'd be lying if I said I didn't like Kelly Clarkson's new album cover. ;-) http://t.co/XyukaUMI
I've just about had it with this place. Good thing I'm off 4 days after this evening.
Maybe I'll get used to it.
This Aluma thingy is already hurting my butt cheek. Not gonna work out, methinks.
Those women should work where I do. We'd love to have them. We have smokers, too. #Cain
Also, Cain's been making the rounds after the "harassment" stuff. I can see a day when we have to look at a wall when talking to coworkers.
Perry's Cornerstone Speech Highlights http://t.co/0BfsNd8A via @youtube
How did I blow $50 at Wallyworld at 3 am? Oh well... At least a got an Aluma-wallet!
It was entertaining, in a drunk, corny uncle sort of way. But harmless. The audience seemed to love it.
Got some Hotcakes earlier. Now watching these shrieking banshees in the media yapping about Perry being high on dope during NH speech.
Been hanging out at work for 13 hours. Craving Hotcakes for some reason. #readytogo

I had pink hair spray in Friday, so tonight I will dress up as boring.
It was a long day, but not too bad. Will be over in a few, hopefully.

Be careful what you wish for. Geopolitics abhors a power vacuum. 3 and counting. Bad guys will attempt to fill them if they can. I'm done.
This Arab Spring stuff was only half the story. They got rid of some dirtbag dictators. Then what? There was no bonafide replacement plan.
This virtually guarantees that a not-so-distant future president will have to deal with this...yet again. Iraq: take two.
Just seen a clip of Al-Qaeda flag flying over courthouse in Benghazi, Libya. Lovely. Just what I suspected would happen.
Oh wow. Went to a party, wound up getting fingerprinted and nobody seems to know the purpose. Creepy.
Going to a Halloween party. Wish me luck.
Perry is getting a lot of crap for not wanting to do all the debates, but, maybe he's right. Maybe there are too many of them. 12 more to go
That was great. I feel complete now. #BeavisAndButthead

But now, I love it here. I've learned to say more with less words. I like "broadcasting" to people worldwide, which is impossible on FB.
I thought about using it to post interesting news stories, but didn't think anyone would see it. Also, it wasn't a "blog".
The almost 5 year evolution of my tweets is pretty amusing to read. It's clear that we had no idea what to do with Twitter back then. :-)

Beautiful days, cool nights. That's fall. :-)
Oh lord, looks like Billy got a hold of the twitter app on my 4s. Don't type your address on here. Crazy people might show up and eat you.
It seems like the economy has took a back seat to other issues. It's like we expect it to be bad now. It doesn't have to be like this.

Don't feel good at all today. Guess I'm overdue a bug.

I feel bad for these kids, bc I had to endure it with little protection. They are lucky that its being noticed now, unlike back then.

100 years from now, future generations will talk about Steve like we talk about Henry Ford. On their holographic iPhone 54S's, of course.

Lots of rumbling that he would get in. Turns out he was on a roll. Butt, he will just sweat it out for now. Okay, I'm done. :p
ION, there is "serious concern" in the media that Christie is too fat to be prez. He may spontaneously explode without enough pizza on hand.
Might as well keep their boots on. Gonna have to do this all over again next year, only with Bam and dogcatchers also on the ballot. #wvgov
Earl Ray won, but 3 points is an incredibly tight race. 10 years ago, this would have been a 30 point blowout.  #wvgov
Can't believe the 4s doesn't have a bigger screen. This may be a deal breaker for me.
My father always told me if you don't vote, you can't complain about politicians. I voted, so I can complain about them until next year.

In other news, Dr. Pepper 10 isn't too bad. I'll drink it again. Acceptable caffeine content, too.
Christie getting in will only help Cain and Perry. He will cannibalize Romney and effectively end Huntsman's run. So, go do what you want...
Kick off your house slippers. Put your boots on. Go out and march. Maybe a job will jump out and slap you upside the head.
But, nothing good ever happens on Monday morning, so I shall laith down for now.
I'd like to break these candidates down sometime into electoral votes and which states go into flux depending on the theoretical winner.
Rep primary race summed up: Cain's in to win. Perry's got 1 more chance; dont f this one up. Base still dont trust Romney. Rest dont matter.
Herman Cain is finally in the race. Nice.

Very impractical for mountainous highway driving. At least the Escalade will get you up the grade without needing recharged.
A gasoline powered Escalade will never meet 55 mpg. The only offset is making a bunch of tiny electric cars for people who hate driving.

Glad Mtn Dew brought back Pitch Black. Now Pepsi needs to bring back Blue and I'll be set.
So what's up with all of these tornados this year?
#happymothersday everyone.
Just crushed a bag of Utz caramel puffn corn. Best midnight snack ever.
Turned out to be a good day after all.
Sometimes, you piss people off just because you can't read their minds.
#Osama is dead.
Two royal pecks. They hyped it up like it would be a long sloppy one. Wouldn't that be hot. #RoyalKiss
All right, ol chaps. Tottle on now.
All right. This is nice and all, but I cannought stay up any longer. #RoyalWedding
These hats are gonna put someone's eye out before it's over with. #RoyalWedding
Red full moon!
Oh well. So much for updating all night. The food made me lazy.
Got a bunch of food at Sheetz. I'm satisfied.
Haven't updated in a week. Will be updating thru the night, for a change.
Man that's gonna be weird.
RT @13abc: Massive debris field from Japan floating toward US: It's been exactly four weeks since the devastating earthquak... http://bi ...
1 month since the #Japan quake. I admire the respect and decency the Japanese still have for each other despite this tragedy.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep. Remember those in #japan	 who can't this weekend #prayforjapan
@ladyvalkyrie37 I'm still here but don't tweet all the time.

Not much is ok in Japan right now. Wow...
I don't know what was "Ok". That was weird. I don't remember typing that.
Ok
Back after taking a break. Enjoying the weather warmup.
Been watching the games today. Maybe one of these years the redskins will once again make it this far in the season.
Been up all night. Still not tired. It got really cold outside.
Didn't know AI was on again tonight. Bonus.
Not bad, man.
I'm actually liking this season's AI so far. It's different yet the same.
Okay. I'm officially sick of winter.
Who else is glad the holidays are finally over? Whew.
It's a really dark night. Literally.
It's about this time I really start wanting Xmas to be over with...
Too cold for this early in the winter. Technically, it's not even winter yet.
December 7.
How did I leave a $5 bill on a dryer in a busy laundromat for 45 minutes and it still be there when I got back? Honesty still matters. :)
Enjoying a sunny, warm Saturday in November. Won't be too many left this year.
Sitting outside watching a nice sunset.
In a tweeting mood today, but don't know who will read this crap.
I'm back. Kind of.
Last night was rough. Feels good tonight.
Texas. Broken A/C. Long night.
Got bored with updating. Sorry about that.
Somewhere in TN, outside of Bristol.
Leaving WV for H-town.
Lord, some of the things you see and hear in walmart on the third...
"Hey little sister, what have you done..."
Two more week until vacation. I really need this one.
Oh nice. How could you not love the "99 Red Balloons" remix? :p
The Bell then Wallyworld, then chill all night
U Hauling all day. Fought with a sofa. Took shower. Now need food.
Laundry day... Just realized that NFL preseason has already started. Better late than never I guess.
So I notice that a lot of people's status updates begin with "So". So cool.
What to tweet about? I'll get myself in trouble if I get too unhinged.
One more week, hopefully.
Another lazy Sunday evening. KFC buffalo snackers would be good about now.
After reading old tweets, I notice my command of the English language has deteriorated substantially... IOW, my writin' sucks.
Good morning. Well, it's morning somewhere...
Perhaps we all need a different perspective from the universe: Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pfwY2TNehw
Took 2 1/2 hours to remove a fake spyware worm from my computer. Who ever wrote that thing needs to be kicked in the nuts - repeatedly.
I've never been so happy to be woke up this early in a long time. :)
Done. http://yfrog.com/17rlmaj
@pepsi Bring back Blue! I still miss that stuff lol.
Grass is over-rated. I would much prefer a rock garden.
Just finished. Well, as much as I'm gonna do. Called someone else to come and finish it lol.
Taking a break from mowing tall grass on this hot afternoon.
An old cell phone pic. http://twitpic.com/28ec90
Hang around at McDonald's long enough, you will be amazed at what you see...
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Maybe that should have been, "jackassary".
Nice illusion. http://twitpic.com/277vt3
Ate Mexican. Left a tip despite their jackassery.
Sunsets are nice.
I need caffeine. Lots of it.
It's a new day, fwiw.
Well... Now what?
NM. Just remembered a spaghetti fundraiser going on this evening.
I don't know what to eat this evening. Sick of it all.
How did I spend $11 at Subway? :-/
Not to imply that I will ever be in charge. Many situations are beyond our control.
I'm still not in charge. I sit and wait.
Parking lot sweeper is here. Guess it's time to go.
Standing in Wal-Mart parking lot at 3:40 am talking about "Shit My Dad Says"...
"Lord have mercy... She's having a spell!" -Butch
I like these new Jeep ads... I might go buy 5 tomorrow.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIBL_ei5VM
I didn't tweet yesterday. I almost didn't today, either.
Should waiters aggressively ask for tips? Something about that really irks me.
Strange... An entire year of my Tweet history is now missing.
Summer is half over already. And Wallyworld is still packed at 10:30 at night. Amazing.
Why does Wal-Mart even drug test prospective employees? Working at that place would drive me to use.
I still love America, even if nobody else does anymore.
Happy 4th, everyone. :)
"Some days, it's just not worth chewing through the restraints.".  --Bonnie
I know I'm not in charge.
Sometimes, you have to wonder who is really in charge...
Wow. Sounds like a bad country song...
3 am. Power is out. Storms are around. Door alarm is buzzing endlessly. No one is up. No one seems to care.
Mmm... Sausage. Last meal of the day. #sausage
