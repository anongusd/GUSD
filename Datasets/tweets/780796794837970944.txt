I've never been contacted by anyone from A&amp;E about their up coming docu-series about the Clinton's. So I don't think they have the full truth. I have the original documents, so fake docu-series! There never would've been a Monica or impeachment if not for the Jones case. https://t.co/5AVj37bfyc

@Stephen6061Deposed a Clinton appointed Judge. She n Bill in back seat of car, she said, doing bible study. St. trooper did hear ;"Oh God"
@daphnebarak @TrumpGirlStrong @KayaJones @GretchenCarlson @deedeegop Maybe they have a few skeletons in the closet. Drain the sewer!
@dbongino Hillary helped cover up Bill. 200+ women we tried to subpoena. 1 Shelia Lawrence, was kept in Bruce Lindsey's house for 3 wks.
@1776Stonewall Bill Clinton was huge sexual predator. 200 + women on our witness list. Hillary moved women all over US to avoid subpoena.
Read my book "Above The Law" the sexual harassment case that brought us where we are today..
Because the Washington Post wouldn't print Isicoff's story about our case, the Post fired him. He was hired by Newsweek, owned by WP.
Kathleen Willey led us to Linda Tripp that led to Monica Lewenski. We didn't have investigative funds, I tossed the bone to Michael Isicoff.
How the world would've turned if it not for the Jones case against Clinton. There wouldn't have been a Monica, if not for me. True story!
@daphnebarak @MayorGUNASTI @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump @johnmappin Nice to see true love as opposed to tabloid bigotry.
@dbongino Obligations, Too late for redemption.They sold their souls to the Clintons. Victims swung in the wind of injustice far too long.
@johnmappin This is so on point, no true journalism when against media's biased views. Nuclear character assassination, I've experienced it.
@johnmappin @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @TrumpGirlStrong @Clyp_It I feel the BBC needs more Trump influence. Restore their sovereignty!
@daphnebarak @GretchenCarlson @RonanFarrow @TrumpGirlStrong @KayaJones @deedeegop @charlierose  Sincerity in words, but restitution needed.
@daphnebarak @BillClinton @seanhannity @kimguilfoyle @TrumpGirlStrong @johnmappin @TuckerCarlsonWhy these women waited years to speak, money
@daphnebarak @seanhannity @TrumpGirlStrong Juanita; raped, Paula, exposed to; Kathleen; her hand forced to his penis. ridiculed by the left
@daphnebarak @seanhannity @TrumpGirlStrong I remember the Wash/Post a cartoon of Paula's nose the shape of a penis, Character assassination
@daphnebarak @seanhannity @TrumpGirlStrong Hillary hired detectives that tapped our phone's and learned that we would soon depose Lewinsky.
@daphnebarak @seanhannity @TrumpGirlStrong Clinton exposed himself. We sued, and I got death threats,  5 yrs. IRS audit, fired from my job.
@daphnebarak @seanhannity @TrumpGirlStrong fake news was part of the Clinton propaganda, sad the victims endured this long for vilification

Hillary is not for women if she attacks the victims of her husband. I use the word husband loosely.
Fact, not rumor unlike the Clintontologist media, Bill Clinton had a distinguishing feature that Paula could identify. Not rumor, fact.
Fact, Hillary worked behind the scenes on the Jones sexual lawsuit to trash and destroy her credibility.
A fact, Bill Clinton pulled his pants down on Paula Jones and told the to kiss it. Fact, Hillary's hired a host of lawyers, detectives.
Clintontologist media are so bigoted. They go after Trump with unsubstantiated rumor, and ignore Bill and Hillary's factual dirty deeds.
Any woman that votes for Hillary has no soul for the abused women Bill Clinton raped. So, go ahead and cast your conscience.
Compare, Hillary, name one bill that she sponsored that helped women in 30 years. She did help Bill go after the women he sexually assaulted

So, if Hillary thinks Catholics, and Christians are deplorables, what's left? Maybe that's whe she refuses the term radical Islamic.
If Trump was a predator and pulled his pants down to a stranger fully aroused and tells her to "kiss It" like Bill Clinton did, that's news.
The Clintontologist must be getting desperate to dig up two women accusing Trump of groping, one 30 yrs ago, one getting kissed 11 yrs ago
WikiLeaks just exposed Hillary's hatred for Catholics and Christians, but you won't hear it from the biased media..
Hillary's advisor, Huma Abedin's mother has ties with the Muslim Botherhood, Al Qaida, and Hamas, go look it up, then vote your conscience.
Want to know more before you cast your vote. Read my new book, "Above The Law" by Stephen M Jones, at Amazon books.
Muhammad Atta, the master mind behind 9/11, imprisoned in Israel. Pressured by the Clinton admin, to be released. vote your conscience.
Megan Kelly must be taking over Greta Van Susteren's skewed views. Better yet, I believe Megan should take  Wasserman's old post.
Megan Kelly cares more about trash talk than true actions of a sexual predator. Kelly is a Clintontogist, biased cheap talk show host
Megan Kelly who are you to say the Jones lawsuit was a nuisance case! Hillary personally orchestrated wire taps,  detectives,n IRS audit
Another botched job from Hillary. Looks like Chris Stevens life was snuffed out due to secret arming ISIS, Al Qaida, and Libya rebels.
A Clintonologist will sell their soul for a liberal agenda. They don't care about Hillary and Bill's criminality. They have no moral compass
Trump has apologised for his past trash talk, but Bill and Hillary have never apologized to their victims of sexual assault.
There's no journalist in this election.Trump is vilified for trash talk, and Hillary, who went after Bill's victims is for women rights, sic
When it comes to sexual harassment, talk is cheap, but action like Bill, pulling his pants down, telling a stranger to "kiss it" is criminal
To keep the Clinton dynasty intact, Hillary attacked Bill's victims, sic. Check out my book on Amazon, "Above The Law" by Stephen M Jones.
Barbara Streisand is supporting Hillary using the term despicable's. That's rich considering her and Bill had a romp at the Hollywood Hilton
RT @dcexaminer: Barbra Streisand asks Dem donors to stop "despicable"Trump https://t.co/MZihdACUBA https://t.co/kHkyYVsWwG
Trumps trash talk is chicken feed to what  Hillary has physically done to many women. The biased media spews from one side of the sewer.
Trump says  'zero chance' he'll end White House bid, after damaging tape, calls to step aside |  https://t.co/BztnUYZQjt
Know the real Bill and Hillary.	 Find out in my book; "Above The Law" by Stephen M Jones, and be healed. If a Clintonologist, no cure.
I hope the Haitian people know the "fool me once shame on you", metaphor when it comes to the Clinton foundation after Hurricane Matthew.
Definition of a Clintontologist; a follower that doesn't care if Hillary has blood on her hands from Benghazi, or Bill is a sexual predator.
Weasel Comey destroys laptops and gives immunity to Hillary's lap dogs. So let's elect her and arrest the innocent and free the guilty.
Obama care is a joke, unless you're here illegally, or you can afford balloon note premiums.
Voter fraud in Indiana is just the tip of the iceberg come Nov. Trump has a up hill battle with crooked Hillary and her band of thrives.
The mainstream media is so far up "chicken little's" butt that the world is falling down if Trump is elected.
Kaine called Trump a fool. Mirror mirror on the wall who's the biggest fool of all, giving Iran 1.5 billion in ransom, Hillary that's who.
Hillary talking about killing Assange using a drone; if you threaten the Clinton hierarchy you may be like many are now, R.I.P.
Hillary uses special interest to finance her own campaign? Trump has invested his own money. He is not obligated to special interest.

Holy Toledo! Hillary is giving a economy speech in Ohio. She is part of the Obama administration where the GDP hasn't been above 3%, so sad.
Hillary continues to slap down Bernie  millennials, she desperately needs by degrading them still living with their parents in a basement.
Hillary is no friend of Israel, the Oslo peace accord stipulated Israel release all Palestinian fighters in jail. Muhammad Atta was released
Its a good thing that Bill didn't get to Alicia Machado before Trump. The talk of the town wouldn't be weight loss. Really Hillary!
Hillary ran the Bimbo eruption and hired detectives, lawyers, and  buddy Young's thugs to threaten and intimidate Bill's accusers.
Well Hillary, if Alicia would've been will Bill on that sex tape, you would have went after her and her family, hiring a host deplorables.
Hillary hired detectives, and lawyers, that dug deep into backgrounds of sexual assault victims.. My book, Above The Law tells all.
I hired the Dallas attorney's that depositioned Bill Clinton when he lied, which eventually caused his impeachment. Above The Law, my book
I say Bill Clinton's infidelities are fair game. You get two for the price of one and we the people, have already paid that price.
Bill Clinton dodged the Vietnam war, raped   Juanita Brodrick, pulled his pants down and asked Paula Jones to "kiss it", just to name a few.
The FBI has lowered the bar for the Clinton's once again. They are "Above The Law", as I describe in my new book. Check it out on Amazon.
In the presidential debate, Hillary said it was just a mistake using a private server Then why did her staffers take the 5th?
@Nikluk @terry_go_online @CNN Draft dodging! That's rich, Clinton dodged the Vietnam war, and  Hillary raged war on women he sexually abused
@wpjenna @washingtonpost That's because Hillary attacked the women he sexually harassed. She is no women advocate.
@wpjenna @washingtonpost
To answer Chelsea Clinton, not remembering her parents ever not being attcked. That's because they were predator's of women who fought back
My book, "Above The Law" optimises what the Clintons get away with. Eliot Ness is rolling in his grave.
Petraeus is recommended for prosecution, but Hillary gets a free pass from the FBI. Director Comey deserves a medals of dishonor.
Looks like the FBI is politically corrupt, and Hillary is "Above The Law", read all about it in my new book.
Wow! A witness for the FBI is given immunity, and is allowed to sit in as a legal representative for the target of the email investigation.
O
I wonder what kind of sympathy Bill Clinton would give the former Miss Universe. And if Hillary approves of this message.
Want to know who the true Clintons are? Checkout my new book "Above The Law" at Amazon books, or Wnd superstore
Too bad Hillary wasn't asked tough questions about the slush fund Clinton foundation.
