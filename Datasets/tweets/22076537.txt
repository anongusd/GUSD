@jeannathomas Anyway, one woman was lost, so I guided her in the right direction and then I saw she was wearing a Pats "28-3" t shirt. 		So my question is, is wearing that shirt in Atlanta bad form?
@jeannathomas So this weekend was the Great Masshole Invasion of 2019. I saw roughly 100 gazillion Pats fans... and 6 guys in Rams jerseys (1 dude had a St. Louis Rams jersey, so I'm not sure if he counts).

@LizMcKeon 35.99% interest rate. I bought a movie ticket in 2002 and I'm still trying to pay it off.
@LizMcKeon It was actually a passbook account (too young for a checking acct). The passbook became a checking account, and that became my first credit card with terrible rewards and a downright punitive interest rate. It's now my oldest line of credit and I'm stuck with it for life.

One other question... when did the president suddenly stop tolerating violence? Was it after he endorsed Greg Gianforte? Or after he invited Corey Lewandowski back to the WH after he was fired for grabbing a female reporter? Remember, POTUS mocked that incident for weeks after. https://t.co/CVbuFCvznU
Also, if the White House insists on making this an issue of violence against women, the president may not necessarily be the best choice to advocate this position (see also: Access Hollywood, his ex-wife, public statements during Kavanaugh, accusations from 12 other women, etc).
Petty, childish, immature, and astoundingly cheap. https://t.co/W2kJtujS0Q

@donie @TwitterSafety But their platforms evolved and now they're scrambling to enact some for of Standards and Practices. But they don't have any. And their efforts to use AI to solve the problem (read: keep costs down) so misses the point that I doubt they'll ever get on the stick.
@donie @TwitterSafety They don't have one. Twitter and FB keep calling themselves a platform and not a media company. But FB is developing TV shows and Twitter is telecasting NFL games. Jack and Zuck don't want to be media CEOs bc they don't want to be beholden to the content.
@MrManderly @TwitterSafety You're not wrong. But in the case of a user who tweets repeated, explicit threats, what's the platform's responsibility? I don't know the answer. That's why I asked. But if @jack wants @TwitterSafety to be safe for all users, how should/will they handle threats in the future?
@TwitterSafety Serious question... is there any set of circumstances under which you would notify law enforcement (local, state, or federal) for anything a user tweets that is against your rules? Have you ever done it before? Would you in the future?
