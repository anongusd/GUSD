Taylor says coal fired power plants ‚Äúcan be harmful‚Äù but that they are sufficiently regulated (not sure whether he‚Äôs referring to ACE rule or current standards). But he adds coal is on a downturn due to natural gas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a free market guy.‚Äù
On clean car rollbacks, Taylor says ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a mistake, quite frankly, to pause that.‚Äù He also notes he‚Äôd prefer congress to legislate the issue, though he acknowledges it‚Äôs probably unrealistic.
For those that care about this sort of thing, Taylor says he‚Äôs friends with @RyanZinke
Taylor rebuffs Luria‚Äôs claim that he opposed offshore drilling ban. In fact, he says, that was an across the board ban that would have been ‚Äúirresponsible.‚Äù He adds, ‚Äúmy position is no to offshore drilling‚Äù
Taylor says he does believe in man made climate change but then goes on a tangent about how to best use international aid to fight it and emissions from burning forests in Indonesia.
On sea-level rise, Taylor mentions his approps amendment that allows DOD to mitigate flooding through the DAR program. If you‚Äôre following these tweets closely (unlikely) you‚Äôll notice that Luria also said this was a positive step.
Taylor and Luria gave similar answers to a question about balance between development and protecting the environment. Taylor says Va. Beach could be zoned better to reduce sprawl and build more open spaces.
.@Scotttaylorva is now up at the @chesapeakebay candidate forum. He starts by touting his spot on the appropriations committee, saying he used it to help save bay funding trump had proposed to cut
A mildly interesting tid-bit: Luria has used very pro-economic development language throughout her segment of the forum. On clean energy for instance, she floated using tax law to incentivize industry to ‚Äúdo what‚Äôs right for our environment.‚Äù
In a non-shocking but noteworthy development, Luria says she opposes the Trump administration‚Äôs rollback of federal clean car standards
On offshore wind, Luria says it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge opportunity for Hampton Roads‚Äù and touts Dominion‚Äôs project in federal waters off the Virginia Beach coast. Here‚Äôs a story on that project from @diaconangelo https://t.co/iDvSfpdiLR
On offshore drilling, Luria notes Taylor‚Äôs vote against an approps amendment to ban offshore drilling for 5 years, says to applause that she‚Äôs not taking corporate oil and gas money
