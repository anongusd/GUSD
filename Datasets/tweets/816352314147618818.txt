@RealSaavedra @dodgysam1 I don't see anything wrong starting her own AOC (clinton) Foundation. She is learning from the best.
@EuroPaladin @Grubsquasher @JackPosobiec Uhh, I don't get it!
@tunegreg She voted for Clinton!
@RatpickJennings @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiff @POTUS Ok Patrick, I interpreted your statement:	"8700 lies. No more B.S.? Trump is the king of bullshit."	Looks like our President told 8700 lies and therefore he is the King.	Sorry!	What would be a better way to state your message so it don't look like  President bashing.	Doc
@RatpickJennings @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiff @POTUS Now count the Clinton lies.
@djnextgen @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Do this first: 	investigate every Democrat, that has held office over the last ten (10) years, to the same extent that the President has been investigated.	Please start with the Clinton's.
@JeanHollandBai6 @TwitterMoments But what have you been doing to make things better?
@RealSaavedra @rrhaley59 And she is a reincarnated Nazi?
@McguireScotty What was the outcome of this arrest?
Well Barbie 1, kinda believe you are damn close to being right.		And she can't be the only one getting kickbacks and free stuff.		For why would any American want open boarders?		Could they all be in collusion with other governments?		Perhaps you have found the real problem. https://t.co/ew8q1NbtVY
Another Obama imitator. https://t.co/4BOziQ1iSC

Kool! Would you give me some phone numbers? https://t.co/0x8LGEpSGD
@KNPACE Kool. 	May I ask, what is it about bae that ruffles your feathers?
@KNPACE Very good. Thanks for the authenticion.
@KNPACE Wait! How do we know that is you?
@KNPACE Are you sure that is your dog?
Or, maybe you don't have a bulldog. https://t.co/tDUzbSVX2C
Hold on a minute. Can someone please tell me just how many of the dead voters  are still dead. https://t.co/4OYL6Yb4sX
So president Trump is over at Nancy's house.	Suddenly they both smell smoke.	President Trump grabs his phone and starts dialing nine-one-one.	Nancy says; "Ohh No, let's wait and see if it goes out by itself". https://t.co/2AYEKSJ48j
When will the Surgeon General declare both Chuck and Nancy are mentally incompetent to hold offices. https://t.co/pLKwpXLDqm
Is there a provision to remove an elected person attempting to subvert the Constitution or intentionally interfering with the Democratic process?
@JernzyJean It's you John @JernzyJean
If a government official is suspected of being delusional, suffering a mental or physical ailament or under outside influence. 	What are the procedures to have them removed from office, at least temporarily, until further  evaluated. ie. captain of an aircraft carrier. https://t.co/hW5yudCS2b
What are the procedures to remove a government employee due to incompetence or a mental illness? https://t.co/MhSIra2lOB

AOC is spouting Extremely Dangerous Propaganda with her skewed subject matter ignorance.		This Disinformation is dividing our country. The 20 &amp; 30 year olds are hearing this as factual and it's spreading.	THIS IS A REAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY, ALSO.		  Operation Mockingbird https://t.co/f61AuVkaSZ
PONDER This:		Nancy &amp; Chuck, and all the like thinkers, have become infected with a desire to change the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INTO a NEW WORLD ORDER, NO BORDERS COUNTRY.	 	              Fake News	     Operation Mockingbird https://t.co/NAj6H9HvQ8
@Airbornex82nd Why is this Extremely Dangerous Propaganda permitted to be distributted via the media?		Is it because it shows AOC's skewed ingorance of a/the topic???		NO!		It's NOT entertaining!		We are seeing disinformation intended to divide our country.		See: Operation Mockingbird
@Harry1T6 Replace AOC's face with hitler's. Watch old aldolf videos. Compare.
You know Roger, got this one right on the mark. https://t.co/xhVgnzP1lF

@MelDMann Ask Hillary or any Democrat.
@onemike951 @schwast2 @realDonaldTrump Yes he did, but never specified that it would be in pesos. A vertical structure (wall, fence, etc.) that will halt unauthorized entry, would pay for itself by a reduction in benefits now distributed from illegal entries.
@Hanntity Mr President, proposal to Chuck and Nancy:	"I will give up on the wall if you, and all the non believers, remove security surrounding your homes for a 30 day period. The doors are to remain un-locked, granting unlimited access to the property. Let's see how that works for y'all.
Thought Discrimination was what the Dems and Libs are doing to our President?	So it's legit for the left but no others.
IfÂ Discrimination is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, then why aren't Chucky and friends in violation?
Merry Christmas Mr President.	Been curious about the term/word "Presidential" and could you direct me to the "Manual of Procedures for Presidents to act Presidential"?	It must exist as the media constantly references the document. 	Respectfully
@DanielTurnerPTF Now that is a great idea?
@TheDona01531168 @BigNurse20281 Thank You Mr President and a Merry Christmas to our Great Country.
@dcchroniclenews Brian, I'm right here with you. Michael
@mitchellvii Exactly! Why so difficult to understand?
@mardybp And see your thought process are along the same lines. Liked your "letter to DC" and the "worse CNN anchor" postings.
@dreamsocean @realDonaldTrump and what have you done for R Great Nation today and/or in the last 2 years??Â¿
@RossGinsberg @realDonaldTrump Ok Ross, how about you, and all your alike thinkers, remove any security devices (alarms, locks, fences, gates and doors) from your house and property!	The next bus load of illegals will be dropped off at your front door.  Kool?
@JGee_Swift @raren2go @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Ahh, come-on John (T-G2M) Swift, why would you even ask a question like that?	Was it just to antagonize or R U being serious?
@RealJamesWoods Start by delivering a bus load of illegals to the door step of every person in Congress (Republican or Democrat) that votes against the Wall.
@AD_WHITMAN @gspatton007 @staceyabrams Hillary, is that you behind those Foster Grants?
@Coolaid3K @JayTeeTodd Clinton
@JayTeeTodd And why?  Maybe because a bunch of liberal demos are up to there usual shenanigans. So take it out of the clint foundation.
@marcorubio Well, for all ye nae sayers, believe it to be a clever analogy.
@TheCatPatterson @maggieNYT And from this: respect of the military salute will be challenged.
@kristen14543231 How'd from Texas pretty lady.
Want to stop the Fake News and Social Media rhetoric? TOTL	(Turn Off The Lights!)
@JacobAWohl Gotta Love this President.
JUSTICE Kavanaugh: Newest member of the "Not Me" movement.
The proposed FBI investigation for Judge Kavanaugh should be extended to include all the Democratic Senators.	After all, we have the right to know what kind of Beer they were drinking at seventeen.
@BettieHerringt1 Dear Bettie, so nice to see you again.
How did S. Daniels report her hush $$$ income to the IRS?
@TexasTribune Where is #6?
Dear Mr. President Trump,	I would support your appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate the legitimaticy of the Obama presidency. 	The scope to include, not less than, 20 years of prior activities to the 2008 elections.	I offer my services in this endeavor.	Respectfully
If a person signs a NDA, receives $$$, then discloses that info, should the payer ask for a refund?

Hey, kinda new to Twitter stuff and have a Q's.	What is this Shadowban thing? https://t.co/EYpOvNlsl0
Question: Would someone (out in Twitter Land) affected by the Shadowban get back with me?	Want to know the circumstances.	 https://t.co/dEKMRGmV9w
So nice to have a Posting that makes one feel warm inside.	Thank You!	Agree the system is out of whack.	Probably not until  "Lock Her Up" happens will the faith be renewed. https://t.co/eo6PQ3unUd
Could the end of the liberal mind-set be close to an end? https://t.co/JELjJPZcvm
A High probability! https://t.co/COAA8oJdWd
Feel POTUS is getting very (extremely) close to finding out the (disgraceful &amp; treasonous) truth about the Democratic Party.	Why else would they be kicking and screaming so violently like a recently trapped wild animal.
Agree - but libetrals will not know the mathematical symbol for 'less than' and take it as a compliment. https://t.co/Pvb46Pu4FS
@HomeAdvisor Ok, thanks
No! The Betrayal is Clinton with Obama following her and the DNC. https://t.co/sMczXphrSX
@AdamSchiffCA No! And what/when he is found to be correct?
@ChuckCallesto GOP
Now that is TREASONOUS! https://t.co/11qv67NxPB
@BradMitton1 Looks like a good place to nap.
@JacobAWohl Hillary made me do it.

Proposed solution to "End Abortion": Reversible Sterilization at Birth.
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump Sweet!!!
Would "Open Borders" beÂ feasibleÂ if all liberals had to remove the doors on their homes?
@JacobAWohl .....and we will send everyone of them to you via over night delivery.
A "New World Order" is close (very) to becoming a reality.		It will be the revelation that 'We are not Alone'.
Want to hear what a democraptic radio talk show is spewing out over the AM/FM airways.  Can't find one.
@alexanderbruz @JudgeJeanine I'm with you on this.
@thehill Humm, so it's just a misdemeanor now!Â¿
@charliekirk11 A very simple and accurate statement. Except now the liberals will see it as an invitation to occupy your residence.
@LauraLoomer @NRA Ammo will be the next trading commodity.
@hrtablaze Believe your statement is accurate.
@Mammagistweetin @GmanFan45 Could all these actors be diverting us (the world) from what is about to happen. Something sinister or something great?
For all the years of Naval service don't recall any acknowledged democraps.Â 		Last week found out why:Â 		A minimum IQ test score of 83 is required for entry into the military.
Clever anology! https://t.co/dB5no1GNqr
Retrocausality
@JacobAWohl Scary
What is the mindset of those wanting 'open boarders'? Thought it was a few but ends up being a lot, after watching the "View". Why do democraps promote 'Socialism' after all the lives lost, in wars, to prevent it? How else could an  enemy of the state be defined?
@Blindeye0821 @JacobAWohl Now that's different.
@BradMitton1 @Eyeguy561 @JacobAWohl @Miami4Trump Was it nice? Our tax dollars at work. Can we (the people) expect any reimbursement from 'way back when' to the present? Has any actions supported a sense of legalitieÂ¿
Could 83%+ of the separated 'child from parent' (at the boarder) possibly be child/cyotie?Â  TheÂ destinyÂ ofÂ  the child would be unimaginable.
@alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Good! Someone finally submitted an option to solve the problem.
@PigskinAnnie @bx001 @laurawbush Somewhat of a good idea but should add a car and maybe bank account to the equation.
@JacobAWohl Now that is messed up!
@JacobAWohl YES!	Agree.
@Jernzyjean @politico @realDonaldTrump BLOCKed!
@Weezers_Revenge @Lyonsliveaudio @LeahMillertoo @JacobAWohl Wow! What a poor demonstration of your Photoshop abilities.
@Weezers_Revenge @LeahMillertoo @JacobAWohl Why?
@Jernzyjean @realDonaldTrump WoW!!!	You are so far Left that I have to follow.
'Trying' to give or 'Gave'? https://t.co/DmWvsnSHy9
@Verajlopez @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump QV, do you feel better now?
@TXRedPilled Who are they?
@JacobAWohl Was wondering how that worked. Now I know. Thanks!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Way too close!
@JacobAWohl Yes I do!
@JacobAWohl And so they say but what are the real numbers for the hunt?
@JacobAWohl And their free cell phones?
@JacobAWohl So, what is 90% of BS's incomeÂ¿

@mn_sportsman @jennifersterger @realDonaldTrump Very good Ryan.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump What? And you should be president?
@harding_lady @realDonaldTrump Can't you close the contemptuous babbling, for just one day, to respect those who made it possible for you to babble!
@realDonaldTrump So Rubin, when you saw something wrong what did you do to help?Â¿ Anyone can find problems!
@realDonaldTrump and add another reason to 'why I'm glad you are my president'!
