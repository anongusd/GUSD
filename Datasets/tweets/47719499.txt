@pbfrsox @AshSinclairxxx @premeViking @GeneralGee_ I’ve worked in several different industries, mentored hundreds of youth. You suck dicks for quarters, girl bye.
@AshSinclairxxx @premeViking @GeneralGee_ You ever take sociology? Didn’t know pornography made you a scholar of economics and race.
@pbfrsox @AshSinclairxxx @premeViking @GeneralGee_ Peter I don’t know you and don’t know how so say this nicely but fuck off. You don’t know me, or my family and trust if you said that shit to my face I’m not like President Obama or Mrs. Obama you would catch these hands.
Tasing hungry kids. How much more deplorable can this country get? https://t.co/nTChU1AGVv
@premeViking @AshSinclairxxx @GeneralGee_ Don’t lecture me or any other Black person in this country about hard work when u get paid to have sex on camera. (I got way more respect 4 sex workers that aren’t shielded by an industry with lobbyists - they are actually doing something risky and deemed illegal in many places)
@premeViking @AshSinclairxxx @GeneralGee_ My grandmother was a real life Rosie the riveter, went to college during the summer and worked in war industries during the school year, started her teaching career in a one room schoolhouse in WV. Her mother, My great grandmother was the 1st person in my family not born a slave
@premeViking @AshSinclairxxx @GeneralGee_ I don’t think there is anything wrong with sex work but the idea that a ww porn star is attempting to articulate a position that  inequality along lines of race doesn’t exist is beyond insulting.
I can’t. On what planet is it acceptable to use a taser in a 7 year old. https://t.co/0j0MMCMKra

@citizenstewart those some/a lot of entities representing the institutions u listed are also problematic too and do the same.
@citizenstewart frm the ag. industry to water companies. education should not be a new frontier for pvt industry profiting off Black bodies
@citizenstewart if so we can respectfully disagree. Private corporations make tons of $ off the suffering of Black ppl.
@citizenstewart so, do you believe we should trust private corps w/ educating &amp; nurturing our most precious resource, children&amp;young ppl
@citizenstewart according to you thats just a small minority of charter schools.
@citizenstewart fair enough. publicly traded companies should not be receiving taxpayer $ for a public service.nor should religious inst.
@citizenstewart personally, i think the community schools model (see: @CommSchools) are the best solutions. local communities know best.
@citizenstewart not saying that all charters are owned by private corporations. but it is a fact that remains true.
@citizenstewart but wholesale privatization of public sector institutions is bad, for society and especially Black folks
@citizenstewart pub schools in USA have real probs1) ineffective large bureaucracies in urban dist. 2)equity&amp;fairness3)school2prisonpipeline
@citizenstewart btw i went to one of the 1st charter schools in Chicago. It was an invaluable experience.
@citizenstewart i didnt say it was untrue. my broader point was that ALL schools public and charter need 2 remain relevant.
@citizenstewart nice talking point. has nothing to do with what I said.
