Why should you care about unfunded mandates?  They ↓↓ money in the State budget which leads to ↑↑ taxes and ↓↓ services for your community. Download the free app @ https://t.co/IwgeWNduCN to track HR50 &amp; contact your reps about this issue!  #unfundedmandate #purplepatriot
Why are unfunded mandates problematic?  Because every dollar a State spends enforcing federal regulations is a dollar that can’t be directed to the specific needs of that state.	#unfundedmandate #purplepatriot https://t.co/ee3cauUXC7
What the heck is an unfunded mandate?  It’s a federal regulation that requires a state (or local gov’t) to perform certain actions w/out getting paid for it.  It can also be a reduction/elimination of prior funding for enforcement of such a duty.  #unfundedmandate #purplepatriot
This Friday the Unfunded Mandates Information &amp; Transparency Act (HR50) will be debated in the House.  This bill will  close loopholes in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and require scrutiny for all major rules proposed.   #unfundedmandate #purplepatriot https://t.co/NUuUrL3fnj

What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #12: The Russians extensively used Facebook and Twitter to interfere with the election. 		What we don't know: Whether any of this implicates @POTUS or his campaign. It might, or it might not. We may never uncover a smoking gun.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #11: Trump Jr. exchanged private messages with #WikiLeaks during the campaign, at the same time the website was publishing hacked emails of the DNC staffers and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #10: #Mueller has interviewed two dozen current and former Trump aides, including Kushner, Priebus, Spicer, and Hicks.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #9: During the transition, Kushner suggested establishing secure communication lines between @realDonaldTrump officials and the Kremlin.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #8: Various members of the Trump campaign and administration have been misleading about their Russia connections, e.g. Kushner didn't include his meetings with Russians on his security clearance forms.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #7: When the meeting became public knowledge in 2017, @POTUS dictated his son's misleading statement on what it was about. It's unclear if he knew about the meeting when it happened.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #6: Emails revealed Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Manafort met with a Kremlin lawyer in Trump Tower on the premise that she had dirt on Hillary. Legal experts say this likely crossed the legal line on collusion.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #5: @Comey all but accused @POTUS of obstructing justice. He testified under oath to #Congress that he believes Trump fired him because of the Russia investigation. https://t.co/IzSCsRHyTL
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #4: @POTUS's lawyer said the president knew @GenFlynn had probably given the FBI inaccurate information about his conversations w/ the Russian ambassador
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #3: The special counsel is looking into @POTUS himself, spec. whether he obstructed justice by firing former FBI director @Comey.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #2: Former @realDonaldTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, were also indicted in #Mueller's investigation. They pleaded not guilty to money laundering and making false statements.
What the #RussiaInvestigation has uncovered so far, #1: Two @realDonaldTrump officials pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their connections and conversations with Russia. George Papadopoulos and @GenFlynn. Flynn is now cooperating w/ special counsel.

Loser: The #Obamacare marketplace. The tax bill was also a health care bill. The @GOP repealed the individual mandate, which taxes Americans who don't purchase health insurance. They call it a blow to the 'heart' of Obamacare. People on health care exchanges will likely lose out.
Winner: Tax accountants. Even though @POTUS promised a tax code that was "simple and easy to understand" tax accntns still benefit. @GOP passed a tax bill that does very little to simplify the tax code. @nytimes wrote the bill "creates as many new preferences...as it gets rid of"
Loser: Blue states. 12 @HouseGOP voted against the bill. 11/12 were from NY, NJ, or CA -- high-tax blue states that are overly disadvantaged by this bill.
Loser: fiscal conservatism. The corporate tax cut, along with the bill's other tax cuts, is expensive. The tax bill costs $1.46 trillion over 10 years -- a substantial impact on the deficit. Fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks seem to have changed their tune.
Loser: individual taxpayers - in the long term. The tax cut for individuals slowly decreases over time and ends altogether in 2025. The @GOP put a sunset provision on all individual #taxcuts to make the corporate tax cut permanent. The result is a tax increase in 2027 for 53%. https://t.co/wIBdlZAe9O
Winner: the individual taxpayer, for the short term. The @GOP plan lowers the individual rate and increases the standard deduction. Most middle-class land in the 12% bracket. According to the @TaxPolicyCenter, the bill would reduce taxes for all income groups in 2018. https://t.co/UPeiBQ3Vrt
Winner: @realDonaldTrump, who benefitted both personally and politically. Politically, this is the last frontier for major legislative change in @POTUS' first year. Personally, it cut his taxes from 39.6% to 37% and increased the exemption on the #DeathTax
Winners and losers from the @GOP #TaxBill. Winner: Corporate America. The bill permanently cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and American companies will no longer have to pay corporate taxes on 💰they claim to have made abroad. https://t.co/dAbvCEeGWl

Analysis: Democrats believe the @GOP is signing its political death certificate with the tax bill. Dems have calculated that a mix of public perception and populism has made the bill toxic to voters. By some accounts, they're right:
Why the @DemocraticParty failed to tank tax reform? Even w/ party unity and energized activists, they couldn't pull off what they did w/ #Obamacare repeal. Taxes are less sexy than hcare, more wonky details. And, Dems couldn't break thru media focus on Russia, sex. harassament.

Many of the tax breaks expire by the end of 2025, leaving a large section of the middle class to pay more in taxes. @GOP promises a future Congress will intervene to prevent that tax hike from happening. 		Is this productive? Or are they putting off making a real viable plan?

Losses under the new #TaxBill: Poor Americans, who mostly don't earn enough for a positive income tax burden, and who are left out of the child tax credit expansion, get $60 each a 0.4% boost to their income. The middle class gets $930, a 1.6% boost. Biggest gains go to the rich:
