"It's just.. we just go further and deeper and higher in season 2" @SonequaMG #StarTrekDiscovery
"The challenge was it could have been so easy for the Enterprise to overwhelm the Discovery. Characters can come on board from the Enterprise but as you can see by ep 2, the Enterprise has gone away" #AlexKurtzman #StarTrekDiscovery "Doesn't mean the Enterprise won't come back"
"The guilt is going to take a long time to heal. It's a long journey. It's a big part of the overall feeling of Burnham" @SonequaMG #StarTrekDiscovery
"I grew up with Kirk as my Captain so I have to go back to the original. That was my childhood. My favorite character of all time is Data (@BrentSpiner)" @ansonmount
"We are definitely enhancing their roles during the course of the season." #AlexKurtzman on the #StarTrekDiscovery bridge crew
#AlexKurtzman talks about what it's like to be in the @StarTrekRoom
"You will be seeing more cultures this season...." #AlexKurtzman #StarTrekDiscovery
"Just enjoy the moment but I know that seems kind of cliche to say. Those encounters are so special and they live forever" @SonequaMG advice to @ethangpeck and @ansonmount on meeting fans #StarTrekDiscovery
"There's a reason that there's only one @actordougjones - he's an unbelievable stellar actor" #AlexKurtzman #StarTrekDiscovery #Saru
"@actordougjones is a miracle as a human, as an actor, he's amazing. So much of what went into that character was concept design. The dream was to cast @actordougjones and the fact that he accepted... He just immediately brings so much life and humor and love to it" @hkadin
"We are doing two more short treks, they're going to be animated, different than the lower decks" #AlexKurtzman #StarTrekDiscovery -- "One will be directed by @CenterWillHold and the other directed by @m_giacchino"
"The idea with the short treks was to originally tell standalone stories. The more inlove with them we became, we realized we really wanted to use them"@hkadin
Alex Kurtzman tells the room "We can't wait for you to see the season finale!" and says they already have a lot of great ideas for season 3 of #StarTrekDiscovery
#AlexKurtzman talks about the the bridge crew &amp; how we think of the bridge crew has a family. Gene Roddenberry had the amazing foresight to create a bridge crew that was entirely colorblind-Hopefully, when you look at the characters on the bridge, you see that reflected"
"The one thing we could say is .. When you see him, it's going to be different than what you would have expected coming into the show" @hkadin #StarTrek #StarTrekDiscovery
"We know probably the middle of last season that it was something we wanted to do." @hkadin on including #Spock in #StarTrekDiscovery Season 2
"I think @ethangpeck had a tougher time than I did" @ansonmount on stepping into iconic #StarTrek roles "It's an enormous sense of responsibility"
"We see it has an amazing opportunity. There is this wonderful grey area where we don't quite know what happened to Spock during this time. This season allows us to explore a lot of detail." #AlexKurtzman on #StarTrek canon
"I think that #StarTrek has become a beacon of hope for all of us.. and hopefully the world will feel the same" -Alex Kurtzman #Hope
