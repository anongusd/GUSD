After failing to convince the American people or Congress to pay for his ineffective border wall, the President is now trying to bypass our constitutional legislative process to get his way. This action is lawless and unconstitutional.
The President's declaration creates a crisis that does not exist, it would require the seizure of hundreds of miles of private and state-owned land &amp; would take billions from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our troops have essential training &amp; readiness.
As lawmakers, it is our duty to protect our constitution, the separation of powers and defend our nation against this gross abuse of authority. That's why I voted to terminate the President's national emergency declaration.

To all the Dreamers across Colorado: keep up the fight. Our state and country benefit greatly from your courage and dedication. I will do my part in Congress to ensure we pass permanent protections that will allow you to work, drive, and live free from the fear of deportation!
#DACA recipients are integral to communities across Colorado, which is why I will continue to work to ensure that Dreamers and their family members can thrive. Their dedication and contributions are good for Colorado‚Äôs economy and our future.
Unfortunately, due to the actions of the Trump administration, these hard-working Coloradans could face deportation now that #DACA + #TPS have been rescinded.
I met a mother with #TPS who arrived in the United States in 2001 after an earthquake struck El Salvador. She's now an integral part of her community in Colorado.
I also spoke to a @TeachForAmerica alumna, whose passion for teaching is driven by her desire to see the next generation of Coloradans grow and learn each and every day.
One of the Dreamers I spoke with is an Eagle Scout, father, and college student who works full-time to provide for his family and complete his Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Sustainability Studies.
These bright young Dreamers currently contribute more than $31 million dollars in state + local taxes annually and wish to use their talents to take their communities (and Colorado) to greater heights.

Gun violence at the magnitude that we currently witness it is a distinctly American problem. On average, 34 people in America are murdered on account of gun violence every single day. Yet, not one single mention from @realDonaldTrump last night at #SOTU.
My full statement on #SOTU here: https://t.co/nWUI6FA7zp
My guest this evening, Elias, is a DACA recipient from my district, who is majoring in chemical &amp; biological engineering &amp; biomedical engineering at @ColoradoStateU. Elias, his family &amp; his path to success bear no resemblance to what President Trump said about immigrants tonight.
By ordering almost 4000 more troops to the border to greet caravans that never arrive, the President politicizes our military #SOTU
By continuing to outline reckless foreign policy, the President directly contradicts the advice he has received from his own military and diplomatic experts #SOTU
By dismissing the important role of Congressional oversight, the President again fails to understand our system of checks and balances #SOTU
Tonight, instead of highlighting places where we can work together, the President returned to his campaign rhetoric of demonizing immigrants, pushing false narratives, and painting the world in stark and grim terms.
Tune into @CBSDenver at 6pm MT to hear my thoughts ahead of the #SOTU https://t.co/eAnvflMyD5
