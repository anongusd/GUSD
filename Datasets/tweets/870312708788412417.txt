@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal I think you meant 14th "amendment" nowhere does it say an illegal non-citizen may birth a legitimate citizen... this is a ridiculous notion not written into the a law but an assumption on your part https://t.co/RmoYtdaRLy
@y2mckay @TheDweck Your sense of "equality and social progress" is a perversion and why you suffer...  baby slaying is not equality or liberty but debauchery and enslavement... a perversion of thought... same sex marriage is debauchery and enslavement...
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal There are attributes of children (disciples) that allow them to serve and do without guile (an agenda) with perfect trust upon a righteous parents (God) request... only if the whole is saved is the one saved (Check John 17 the intercessory prayer)  No last no first only service
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal In fact it is not only the fastest way... it is the only way... to stop the madness!  when Christ settled a dispute between his apostles about who would be the greatest upon his departure he said two amazing things...

@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal And, becoming a shareholder and a builder/servant and a believer in a higher power is the fastest way (still takes a long time and effort) out of poverty and its ills... hopelessness hate drugs alcohol sex-abuse crime potty mouth and stupor of thought
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal Those that believe in God and serve his children will disagree with you...  U need to get invested in the capitalistic system... become an American by investing... grow a portfolio... see how America works for its investors... This is the fastest way out of the Section 8 Cages https://t.co/HGvaRqqxhT

@krassenstein @Jack_Burkman Gossip
@krassenstein @Jack_Burkman Just another mindless Brian Krassenstein rant
@LukaBrazzi Think of hate filled ranters like Waters Sharpton Booker
@LukaBrazzi President Trump's White House is staffed by 374 employees, 95 fewer than Obama Trump's payroll budget is $35.2 million vs. Obama's $40.9 million Trump will save Americans $22 million over four years in staff expenses Melania's staff is just 10 compared to Michelle's 24
@LukaBrazzi O did more to erode race relations than any person in history
@LukaBrazzi Tell the whole story !!!
@LukaBrazzi O was rapidly increasing Debt/GNP ratio with zero economic growth... that is just crazy... he was absurdly incompetent !!!  THE WORST POTUS EVER  !!!
@LukaBrazzi Oboob was "The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama by Matt Margolis" ...read the book... low inflation, not if ur retired on SS ??? you mean zero economic growth !!!...  I lived through the O incarceration... he was the worst.... inciting violence agnst police
@LukaBrazzi The Oboob rally was liquidity driven not value driven... dirt cheap money, looming debt while GNP stalled....  that is a disaster...  the last years of the O rally was looking forward to the T tax plan ahead (read "Trumponomics")... THINK before making stupid statements

@y2mckay @TheDweck Its been widely reported even in the DNC press... (but it was probably a GOPer speaking, right!!!)...  DNC press labeled the Temple shooter GOP until he spoke of his hatred for TRUMP... so sorry !!!
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal Did I mention Ford did not know time dates and places...  she would not get any prosecutor to represent her with such nonsense
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal I went right and reported what happened to me... the Officer turned out was under grand jury investigation for multiple assaults... he assaulted a woman in jail and was caught on tape ... lost his certification and later convicted of attempted murder... a pattern of behavior
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal Ford was an obvious liar... no corroboration even from 1st hand witnesses (FBI)... would not produce the lie detector test, no reports to police or anyone... a squeaky little fake voice... no pattern of behavior evident in Kavanaugh...
@y2mckay @haileyshep5 @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal "GOP’s ever encroaching fascist police state"  this is just irrational junk of the lazy mind... you are a victim of the fake news boys at the DNC (MSNBC CNN CBS ABC NBC)... stop being a victim and do some independent thinking

@haileyshep5 @y2mckay @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal You are right, I was sodomized by a police officer (while handcuffed during an overnight false imprisonment/arrest) who is now in jail for attempted murder..  I reported the crime three times and was laughed at by the cops... The problem for Ford was no report/credibility/memory

@y2mckay @TheDweck @MaxineWaters @SenBlumenthal lying assault victims, disabled &amp; shrieking yellow journalists, violence against journalist (where's that???), armed guards in churches ??? a few gun toting NRA boys would have made short shrift of that shooter... that's the point..... now talk about performance and get to church
@y2mckay @TheDweck We are afraid of emotional mobs whose only source of income is George Soros and live in Sec. 8 Cages on the dole... and they're happy with that .... very low expectations....  too bad we can't deport these terrorists of the state of freedom... shooting up &amp; harassing senators

@y2mckay @TheDweck @SenBlumenthal @MaxineWaters Debt as a percent of GNP is lower; i.e., Debt/GNP ratio is down... this is not that hard to understand... the Oboob flat economy was adding debt faster than the TRUMP 3.5% growth economy... do u understand???  With jobs comes education... families...  normal love and affection
@y2mckay @TheDweck So you approve of the "Section 8 Cages" housing the disenfranchised for generations... this is the status quo u find acceptable ???  Stop the name calling and opinionating  and look at performance.... you will see the light and become a TRUMPSTER

@MichaelAvenatti Thanks for energizing the Red Wave... we're never going back to flat economic growth, mind boggling debt, no jobs for the poor, poor trade deals, poor political alliances, baby slaying, needy geeks &amp; fringe types energized by handouts and entitlements... etc yawn !!! https://t.co/ufiDwkTE28

Who is the greatest? a wise man was once asked. and answered, He that serves all even the weakest amongst us...  as we are all saved together... losing none... even the least of men is important to the whole...
@MichaelAvenatti @chucktodd Any popularity you may have enjoyed symbolizes just how desperate the libs have become.... grasping at straws... at anything...  their motives are all so disparate self-implosion was a surety... compared to TRUMPSTER performance you were just a blip of blab
@MichaelAvenatti @chucktodd Have peace Michael... soon you won't have to worry about this political stuff anymore... you'll be making new friends (of all persuasions) at Rikers... https://t.co/AhBnZWnfII

@TheView “I can’t give into hate, it’s too great a burden to bear — I have to stick with love.”   Then why stay on a show ruled by hate mongers Whoopi Goldberg Joy Behar and Sunny Hoiston ????
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump TRUMPSTER is a monster builder... he rebuilt the GOP the same way he became a billionaire... blood sweat and tears (gee is that PC) he just goes and goes and goes...  and he can't be bought !!!
@EdKrassen TRUMPSTER is a great counter puncher
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews Nice tweet from DNC Central News
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Your 2nd and 3rd hand hearsay is legally meritless and frivolous...  the FBI reviews only 1st hand accounts...  oh, and pay all the people you owe money to...  including the IRS... u have zero credibility !!!  Soon to be disbarred...
@authorkengould @AliciaPetril @StephenKing A cheap money economy, known as a liquidity driven marketplace, will always fail as debt/GNP ratio expands.... eventually no one will want to own your paper $$$ and raising capital through debt offerings becomes very expensive, interest on debt astronomical
@CNNPR Jeff Zucker is in the business of sensationalizing and ultimately selling news...  his only concern as a CEO is $$$...  he has demonstrated long before the TRUMPSTER his willingness to weaponize and radicalize news for zealots... he could care less about truth... what a joke
@GKeile If it wasn't for Tweet Trumpster I wouldn't be here either... Thanks to the MAN
Why don't @JoyVBehar @WhoopiGoldberg @sunny not see their hate-speak as part of the problem ? They love to point their fingers and speculate rankly and incite with misinformation, yet they are pure ???  Just part of the blue drip. they will be filled with indignation come Nov 6th

@JimCarrey These comments remind me of your "Dumb and Dumber" character... how gullible u r...
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump The libs will do/say anything to change the narrative... here is what didn't work: Squeaky Ford - Russian collusion - Latino Caravan - Healthcare/Medicare/Medicaid/SS scare - TRUMPSTER liar - FAKE News - Hostility - Mobs;  there is no narrative that works against performance
@Amy_Siskind So easily suckered
@grizzlemeister Dems up to their dirty tricks
@TotaLuv2Tweet @Basta20201 @MichaelAvenatti I think ur cute.  Goofy, but cute.  There is always hope
@spayer @JamesHershberge @charliekirk11 Name calling accomplishes nothing... we're not running for office here...  he is right about the law pushed by the dems
@grizzlemeister My sentiments exactly !!!
@authorkengould @AliciaPetril @StephenKing Get off the opioids !!!  The Oboob rise in the market was based on very cheap money.. printing printing printing... and the predilection that the enslavement of the poor through entitlements would soon be over... today's economy is better for the poor than anything the Oboob did
@StephenKing Stick to your knitting... great books...
RT @realDonaldTrump: Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.
@Basta20201 @MichaelAvenatti @TotaLuv2Tweet Have you forgotten...  "A lie can travel  halfway around the world while the truth is putting   on its shoes."  [“The Wit &amp; Wisdom” of Mark Twain]  A principle the  dems exploit daily

@ddale8 Dale's labeling "common sense" as lies shocks the conscience ! Common sense tells the Caravan is is leftist funded... a grab-bag of  the diseased, criminals &amp; terrorists. this is not rocket science as the caravan is scheduled to arrive on election day. what a shocking coincidence
@ddale8 WOW the snowflakes on this thread are the must gullible dupes I've ever seen...
@ddale8 Yes Dale's labeling "differences in opinion" as "lies" is a new one... his fact checking is straight from the "space ranch," worthless... I'm sure he uses the same SanFran Bath House as Michael Avenatti and Squeaky Ford
@MichaelAvenatti "Virulent" = diseased like a plague...  your legacy??? take a look ==&gt; https://t.co/kX5lp0if7W
@Basta20201 @MichaelAvenatti @TotaLuv2Tweet Clearly there are some pre-existing conditions (Avenatti and the snowflakes) which should be left untreated, why should we be encumbered by these zealots???  sure there are some who honestly need help... and there righteous claims will be covered under the presidents plan...
@TotaLuv2Tweet @MichaelAvenatti OMG looks like you're on the vanguard of multiculturalism !!!  which vanguard has laid waste to corporations... I'd keep the Bill Maher reference off your resume when looking for work... and I trim the hair and ditch the nose rings also...

@grizzlemeister love unfeigned or love unpretended... or love without guile (an agenda or secret motive)... only the Master really loves without guile... of course we aspire to be "like him" but all fall short without an atoning sacrifice... and only a perfect supernal unspotted sacrifice...
@EdKrassen ...the Pharisaical admonition, "outside like a whited sepulcher... inside full of dead men's bones" or "having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof"....  i.e., be careful when you cloak a political agenda with scripture...
@EdKrassen Where there is a political agenda or a false narrative quoting scripture is null and void... especially from an atheist !!!  "when you do charity to the least of these you do it unto me" oft quoted by the high moral ground libs this is to forget the Pharisaical admonition
@baldandgassy @MonicaBaumann @DavidAFrench The atheist dems care nothing of the judgments they may suffer as the scriptures teach "be careful how you judge for ye shall be judged by the self-same judging ye employ"... scary if Christian... not so if atheist... so most GOPs live under a higher standard...
@baldandgassy @MonicaBaumann @DavidAFrench The TRUMPSTER as a racist is a wild jump to conclusions or judgments without knowing his experience or facts... but the dems use labels liberally (pun intended)... the GOPs are just nicer people pushing the "golden" rule...
@baldandgassy @MonicaBaumann @DavidAFrench The problem is how fast one is to exploit explosive rhetoric without facts...  the dems win this race hands down...  because white people fear blacks or other minorities usually is experience oriented... racism is prejudice or prejudgement without experience being a factor
@MichaelAvenatti Dems shut down the boarders and shut down their only supply of new voters aside from the generations of section-8 progenitors giving rise to an ever-expanding new senseless brainwashed mob ??? I don't think so !!!

@charliekirk11 Path of least resistance... ==&gt; USA ===&gt; the good life on the dole and running gangs and terrorizing in the USA
@charliekirk11 Here's an idea !!! Why not all the poverty stricken from all nations enter the USA !!!  I thought this up all on my own... in the name of charity of course... OR  Why don't people stay in their own countries and work for social justice....   NAW  much easier to get welfare in USA
@MichaelAvenatti "The arms deal should have been cancelled weeks ago."  That's absurd, figure it out... that conclusion rates with all your other frivolous claims!!!  Get with your LGBTQ auto-asphyxiation buddies but please don't hurt yourself....

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump R U in never never land. the only jobs the Obomb created were meaningless govt jobs along his racial biases. he literally shut down the economy putting so many out of work for long periods they never returned to the workforce. remember how unemployment was extended three times???

@SenBlumenthal What did you give us Richard???  A package of lies to exploit the poor and emotionally unstable...  let's see... high taxes on the poor... no growth economy with expanding meaningless govt jobs and rapidly expanding debt/GNP ratio..  failed healthcare... and mobs of crazies

Squeeky Ford played right into my belief of what a liberal is …that the the libs unfortunately have decended into a grabbag of geeks, fringe types, anarchists and power gtabbers using those willing to shout
to shout down Senate hearings, to shoot Senators, and attempt to kill candidate Trump on more than one occasion  ng a potporri of emotions and hysteria to influence and control those lacking in emotional control
As such, Squeaky Ford fed right into the dem hysteria using only EMO.. No recolection of how she got to a party, where the party was, when the party occurred, of  other interaction at the party, what was said at the party… but, knew where the bathroom was?
Did not scream when forcefully grabbed and kidnapped into a bedroom???  We are to believe her simply because she feigned an emotional woman possessed of a squeaky voice though an accomplished lecturer… I found her completely without credibility

@steph93065 I don't condone his acts... but it seems his behavior was right in-step  with many party animals...  there are many men and women that seek  control through drugs and alcohol... the DA that bought him down looking  for a book deal pay day... same for all involved..
@steph93065 Should have been purely civil action...
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Look in the mirror... sure USA wants a pres that could pass for  rat/weasel man...  Your lame attack on @AlanDersh has all the dignity of a 10-year old in the sandbox
@steph93065 @BreitbartNews Self flagellation high on their priority list
@scotthetsko Rain I don't care... Only wish Hannah were there
@jimdwrench Seeking book deal$$$

@JoeNBC https://t.co/GRCZ3znHfH		the dems have weaponized hysteria...  Joe sows seeds of mayhem..
@JoeNBC https://t.co/GRCZ3z66o9
@Harlan @tedcruz The dems have weaponized hysteria....  destabilization and mayhem are their tactics since they have no plan other than to hate POTUS
@TheDemocrats Not to the extent to decide who lives and who dies...  sorry if I error, but I must error to a baby's right to life...
@RKBs_Twitstery This is a whole new battle plan for the dems tryng to invoke mass hysteria and mayhem and ride the coat tails of the #MeToomvm   see https://t.co/s0YsmkMsje
@heartswithin @mbelgass @TheView And I'm just getting warmed up ! ! !
@MartinJBabin Good to have you on board Martin... thanks for your service ! ! !
@JoeRice413 @gertrude1306 @SenSchumer @TheDemocrats @BillClinton @keithellison mega dittos Joe ! ! !
@steph93065 The haters are too busy storming the capital to work...  weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth...   same as at the Clinton "I Lost" speech...  mass hysteria has been weaponized by the dems...
@LibertyGirl20 @HuntsmanAbby I have come to your way of thinking....  How does the view come up with these wet noodles for contrary opinion vis-a-vis Megan McCain???
Seeing the demonstrations at the capital reminded me of Weeping and gnashing of teeth in the latter days https://t.co/qQXkHEusYI via @wordpressdotcom
@mj_flaherty @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump EVER!!!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Fantastic... the rest of us can't keep your energy level for five minutes
@ABC Shes a zealot using words like "fair and respectful"... OMG  One of the most despicable women in USA
@jpcammarata @steph93065 Clearly, the zealots don't believe in an afterlife....
@chontal @megynkelly I spend more time with my dogs than you do with your kids... what is love?  The "Fox" explained it to the "Little Prince"
@chontal @megynkelly Gee seems like you made up your mind on fakery...  would you eat rat poison if I recommended it to you?  Please eat!!!
@MichaelAvenatti Do you know, no one believes a word you say... except the new crop of fringe types them dems seem to be raising... check out the crazies at the capital today... these zealots will soon turn to hurting themselves..  time for you to fall on your sword and demonstrate your passion
@HuntsmanAbby Thanks for your typical noncommittal say so....  yes you look good but no guts no glory, just a trophy wife...  the dems have made book on this type of speculation/exploitation... take a stance gutless
@MichaelAvenatti Exploit mongrel.... read and weep... your antics are helping the GOP	https://t.co/Ye5lgVQEmA
@steph93065 At least (thanks to Trump) all the haters can get a job if they wanted to
@MichaelAvenatti Why would they respond to you
@HuntsmanAbby Shake your tail feathers Abby...
@MichaelAvenatti How ridiculous u r... the antichrist cries in the outer darkness of lost souls
@darlingdebRN @BukeCraig @SenSchumer @atensnut Keep drinking your swill
@gertrude1306 @JoeRice413 @SenSchumer @TheDemocrats Yes, she could get sued for libel..
@SenSchumer The FBI doesn't need the @realDonaldTrump permission to investigate anything... stop the fabrication!!! the fact the FBI has chosen not to investigate shows your claims are groundless
@SenSchumer The FBI should be investigating the dem agenda... antichrists poltergeists and shaman conjuring madness in the halls of the Capital... dem agenda has become so obvious, no Kavanaugh investigation is necessary
@CNNPolitics Love u @KellyannePolls
@JodiPow39225039 @Reuters @SenFeinstein Said so well Jodi... GREAT way to celebrity and a book deal and $$$ though... Anita Hill paved the way....  GOP was too shy then... Trump will fix...  Blues are now a potpourri of anarchists poltergeists and shaman... straight from the infernal pit.. led by Slimestein
@JodiPow39225039 @TomCottonAR @SenFeinstein @ChuckGrassley The crazoids are lining up... they were all pounding down the doors of Congress last week... they should be heard by the FBI! ! !
@CNNPolitics Of course CNN and MSNBC are apolitical... sell news is all their care... and still failing
@MichaelAvenatti I have a client that saw monkeys fly out of Kavanaugh's butt..  and he would like to testify...  also I represent the Grand Wazoo who is willing to testify he saw Kavanaugh dictating poetry to Mark Twain... he has been alive for 400 years!!!  I'm sure they will listen...
@MichaelAvenatti Yes, please run for president you have so much credibility... I am sure the committee  will listen to you and your long list of fanatics...  NOT
@TheView What's insulting is your actress pocketing thousands to run down a good man...
@steph93065 @carrieksada @ChristieC733 @LVNancy @LeahR77 @Stonewall_77 @DrMartyFox @SandraTXAS @phil200269 And book deal for sure
@cefilby @TnGovern @SenFeinstein How did Ford get the right to have Kavanaugh removed from her lying testimony hearing....  the GOP is WAY too nice
@cefilby @SenFeinstein As a pro se litigant... what happened to the accursed's right to face his accuser?
@SenFeinstein Because you and her are shills of the highest order of magnitude....  her request for a hearing is groundless and should have been thrown out... your last ditch effort was a typical dirty Dem tactic... totally transparent
@13WHAM T turning into best president ever
@LindaSuhler Hirono idea of a question is to give an incomprehensible speech during the confirmation... she doesn't know when to shut up
@LindaSuhler Hirono is just an unpersuasive goofball...
@steph93065 @SenFeinstein GOP need to study the Dems tactics.... they are always first with the negative lying rhetoric....  Trump figured this out way before the election...  he's a political genius
@CulinaryOracle @hindustanse @steph93065 @SenFeinstein Dittos
@hindustanse @steph93065 @SenFeinstein dittos
@steph93065 @SenFeinstein dittos
@SenFeinstein There are no death threats... bullying? What a laugh... outrages lies are what the dems are known for...  she'll be a no show... their last ditch lies will make no difference
@CNNPolitics Cory is filled with African American rage... so he can do what he wants... NOT !!!
@SenFeinstein The officer that assaulted me is now in jail for attempted murder... a few years earlierm he lost his certification for assaulting Lisa Tanner while she was restrained...  I was handcuffed...  I want an FBI investigation...
@realDonaldTrump I'm 68 but I could get a job in this great economy.... hard keeping up with the master though...
@SenFeinstein I'm a male raped by a Police officer... the police wouldn't take my complaint... the States Attorney took my complaint and did nothing... this happened in May of 2004.
@SenFeinstein I just filed my third complaint... and the FBI has still investigated nothing... so get a grip, Ford is a 12th minute of the 12 hour liar seeking a book deal... the dems do anything fore power and money
@HuntsmanAbby Ensure that... get to temple regularly
@HuntsmanAbby Nice
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView Who should be the greatest? And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.  As he who is leader must see that all else are considered... No one works harder than @realDonaldTrump
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?		Peace Brother @RKBs_Twitstery
@maziehirono I just filed my third complaint... and the FBI has still investigated nothing...  so get a grip, Ford is a 12th minute of the 12 hour liar seeking a book deal... the dems do anything fore power and money
@maziehirono You are so taken with fake news....  Ford's book deal and dollars is all she cares about... I'm a male raped by a Police officer... the police wouldn't take my complaint...  the States Attorney took my complaint and did nothing... this happened in May of 2004...
@maziehirono You are so easily duped...  how did the duped elect you Senator
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView Sure I am... 12th minute of the 12th hour crap is crap...
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView Keep coking
@LibertyGirl20 @HuntsmanAbby @HarperChildrens She slammed the speculations of the mouth, Joy,... joy shut right up
@realDonaldTrump Mega dittos
@foxnewspolitics Ford is a flea on the back of an elephant... Kavanaugh only stronger
@DRUDGE_REPORT Have you signed Ford to a book deal yet?
@yashar NYT will make up any news necessary for their survival...  they just made this up... under the law the fake news boys can make up anything... absence of malice... right to free speech.... only the zombies believe it
@SenSchumer STOP spreading your fake hate speak news dung over your fields of stunted zombies... Rosenstein should have been gone with Mueller long ago...
@CNN Keep the nonsense hatespeakology coming
@SurfBot6 @SenFeinstein Ha!!!  Yes, and all his opinions aren't based on binding precedent either... Raping and pillaging women isn't reserved for Al Franken and Cory Booker
@SenFeinstein You have totally lost your mind... your hate speak is revealing
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView You have no platform... stealnig from the rich will never get you a job.... you lazy lump
@kwhite791 @JoyVBehar Mega dittos
@JoyVBehar When will you tire from acting stupid and uninformed and misinformed on the view?  @POTUS made Jerusalem capital of Israel... you of all people should be thankful to this answer to old testament and latter-day prophecy... please get informed
@HuntsmanAbby @HarperChildrens Love it when she slams the mouth, Joy Behar... who spews any incredulity that comes to mind
@HuntsmanAbby @HarperChildrens Abby is the only normal person on the view....  she gives rich meaning to, "all the good ones are taken"
@RKBs_Twitstery @Sandrawright614 @TheView Didn't I see you storming the capital with the other zoomies!!!  We're taking back the USA... not sorry...
@TheView Book deals in the works... Fords got lawyers negotiating NOW!!!  Handsome payoff for lying under oath.....
@TheView Death threats are undocumented speculation... have another beer Whoopsie
@Sandrawright614 @TheView Assumes she has integrity... NOT!!!  She's 36 years late and gropes for a book deal after a failed marriage and man hate...
@TheView Ms. Ford seeking book deal.... will make millions selling her soul to the moonies...  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
@RichardAngwin What a strange sound for a pig to make
@heartswithin @mbelgass @TheView Of course, a "creature" should be shocked... kicking and screaming they're going bye bye
@SenFeinstein For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Think about it!
@SenFeinstein Feinstein should be investigated for obstruction of justice along with   Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin, Sheldon Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Chris Coons, Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Booker, Harris (crazies from the left of the moonies) for women's right to destroy life
@SenFeinstein Senator investigate what?  You are the dirtiest of the dirty...  sat on the lie for 3 months...  you got the crazies lining up.... saw them at the capital... they'll say whatever you want them to.... they all want book deals and instant millions...
@ShanonLee01 @radiorewrk3000 @SenFeinstein Feinstein will lie till she pops a gizzard...  She has zero integrity  sat on this info for three months?  oh yeah...  any dirty cess filled rant is ok with the lefties... lets c... Russian collusion?   and they actually got a shill to investigate. Got to learn how to fight back
@SenFeinstein Thank you to the @POTUS
@ABC Fake news alert... he knows nothing... stop with the speculation and innuendo...  if there was anything it would have been public 18 months ago... Mueller is just burning through our taxes with his nonsense
@heartswithin @mbelgass @TheView Motorboating? never knew until Stormy's need to write a book... just like Ms Ford... the lefty publishers are lining up.... turns out Ruth Ginsburg was groped by Abraham Lincoln... she may be going for a book deal also....
@CNNPolitics Don't waste my time...
@CNNPolitics She'll never show... her 12th hour fabrications would be completely undone
@TheView No one believes Ms. Ford &amp; Feinstein.  Zero credibility.  the dem agenda exposed.... she wants an FBI investigation?  Well F&amp;F should have said something 3 months ago... not in the last moment... how transparent how pathetic
@mbelgass @TheView Ditto... and these dummies are on national TV representing dems... says something... Love it when Holly puts Sun and Joy in there places... they need to get informed
@hasp259 @TheView @sunny Bring all our citizans stateside....  cheaper on welfare than rebuilding
@TheView @sunny So what was your solution???  Lots of stupid talk S(D)ummyTrump did all the US could do.... no statehood here.... for sure...
@SciFisstrs @TheView you swallowed the wrong pill... you remain in the surreality of the matrix....
@TheView Sure no agenda here Chucky... she just waited till the last minute to attempt her derailment... what a scam....  trickery is all the desperate dems have left
@TheView Considering Kavanaugh... here the dems show why Trump had to expose lie after lie after lie... counter-punching with fire against fire... Dems are a sworn bunch of geeks and fringe types... time to roll back the liberal swamp our county has become
@TheView @SenSchumer Biggest dem liar out there.... no credibility... if this latest Kavanaugh lie fails they will promote another lie... then another... then another...
@TheView KAVANAUGH Accuser another lying dem....  last ditch lying effort to derail Kavanaugh... what a joke.... lying Whoopsie (have another drink)...  and these liars call Trump a liar????
@TheView Tucker Carlson is spot on... Avenatti exploits the porno
@Tom4truth @gentlescorp @MMFlint Ha Ha Ha.... good one!!!
@TheView @WhoopiGoldberg Gotta love MM's compassion for the human race... thks but NOT
@TheView @WhoopiGoldberg MMoore rewrite of history... another flop in the making... Like O Stone on WWII...  Whoopsie on D&amp;A with fellow boozers Joy and Slimy reach a new low in guest selection
@TheView Stormy and Avenatti... what a duo... living off Pres largess.. shameless duo... no credibility... transparent in it for the buck... books to be written... no one of substance will read.  Whoopsie needs to lay off the D&amp;A... biggest liar... just for the bucks.. blind leading blind
@elizabeth28536 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Get a job and invest in the Great America
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Pres focused on great America... keep it coming... wish I could work for the Pres but I don't have the energy...

@POTUS Sean Patrick Maloney nut job up there with Woopie and Avenatti
@POTUS Econ growth... we're so proud...  Jerusalem capital of Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy... Obama rambles on racist hate speak (his entire platform) blues have no plan just hate... Obama shut down economy to grow govt and debt; that is not sustainable plan
@EricTrump Obama trying to take credit for the improved economy...  The economy may have started to improve only because the hopefuls saw a Republican win on the horizon...  When your father was nominated you could feel the excitement  spilling into the markets and the economy..
@WhiteHouse As usual @BarackObama rambles on racist hate speak towards reds (which has become their entire platform; i.e. hate speak) blues have no plan just hate... Obama took money out of the economy and shut it down to grow govt... and debt; that is not a sustainable plan...
@WhiteHouse The NYT story is a fake... should be clear it was written by a journalist
@AdamChodak While Samantha pretended to rake leaves I jogged my dogs 3.5 miles....  Rich C is best weather man ever... can't believe Al Roker hasn't demanded him for sidekick... his people skills are stellar and his voice and delivery relaxing.. he's even got Drew Carey beat!!!
@FLOTUS Thanks for being the best ever and supporting our best ever President

@realDonaldTrump When will the dems ever learn...  there is no free lunch... work is wonderful... the market agrees...  emotions and name calling come and go
@cnni Unfortunately here sentence will be light
@slack2thefuture @realDonaldTrump Regardless, Rosenstein still recommended the firing... get it!!!  Ur typical emotional outburst is pure demo
Mueller must justify his investigation...  how do we pay for such nonsense
Rosenstein fire Mueller before recusing yourself... there is no evidence... how can disgruntled shill innuendo a speculation investigation
@realDonaldTrump If Mueller can't come up with evidence in 1 week then you should shut down the speculation investigation
@CillizzaCNN did u c Norah's grouchy face this am.. she never asks tough questions of the libs
