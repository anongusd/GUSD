@ranchedcruz Not the entire country.  But many Poles were complicit.  Some enthusiastically aided the Nazis and were happy to murder their Jewish neighbors.  Holocaust survivors and scholars know the truth, which Poland can never erase.
If Bernie, Warren, or any other hard leftist wins the Dem nomination, I will almost certainly, barring something truly extraordinary, vote for Trump in 2020.

@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Referring to the hypothetical scenario above, to prove that your argument that taxes "can't be oppressive" is nonsense

@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Tyranny is merely an oppressive power
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa If the government takes nearly everything you have, that is nothing short of tyranny
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa BS
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It is not "what we do" in a free society.  America has experienced record growth and prosperity under lower taxes, and we have *never* had a wealth tax
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It is a tax directly tied to wealth, however.  There could be a case that it is still unconstitutional
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Furthermore, it is ineffective (this is a fairly old essay but the point still stands): https://t.co/Aqaw4ClFxx
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa The government can "tax" 99% of my income and 50% of my wealth.  Sure, it's a "tax", but that doesn't make it any less tyrannical
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa If someone takes half (if not more) of what you earn each year, while also taking 3% of all your assets each year, that is not reasonable taxation.  That is theft, no matter what you want to call it.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It could still be ruled unconstitutional given that its intended purpose is a direct tax on wealth
RT @ReaganBattalion: .@AOC, Why are you lying? https://t.co/elBluGkEse

@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa ‚ÄúNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.‚Äù
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa For some, most of their income will be taxed at 70%.   Add to that state and local taxes in a place like NJ.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa That's what I am referring to.  And Warren wants a wealth tax, which is ineffective and probably unconstitutional
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa I was referring to the 70% top marginal rate proposal
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa My parents are currently paying well over 20k in property taxes a year.  On average, New Jersey households make about $100,000.  The average property tax is about $9,000, or 9% of income if you want to talk about it in that way.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Wealth =/= income.  I'm talking about income obviously
So now @taxfoundation is an "opinion website".... can't deal with this stupidity. https://t.co/K2JDU4eN9w
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa The top rate is 37% nationally.  10.75% at the state level.  Add to that the percent of income taken in the form of property and sales taxes, and you'll certainly get to at least 50%.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Yep
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa And therein lies the problem with your thinking.  The "government" did not create American success and prosperity.  The people did.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa The tax foundation is reputable and nonpartisan.  Also, the link I sent you is merely statistics.  Sorry if the facts don't fit your narrative ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa The highest earners in the state certainly do.  And 10.75% is very high.  People are leaving the state.  Retired folk cannot afford to live here, and the wealthiest residents would rather move elsewhere. https://t.co/MuBHOEA2zK
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It is.  And as a nation founded on the principles of individual liberty and freedom, Americans will not accept oppressive taxation.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa No, I did not.  Had statistics somewhere but I cannot find the paper I had them on.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Are you sure you live in New Jersey?  We have high income taxes, insane property taxes, a terrible business climate, and high taxes on just about everything.  Here is how we compare to other states (and the top rate was recently raised to 10.75%): https://t.co/XAg1iiKkVy
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa *high* taxes.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Maybe not 50, but surely 40% of income once you factor in property taxes.  And upper class New Jerseyeans probably pay about 50%.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa To a certain extent.  When taxes are too high, that is a breach of the social contract and a threat to liberty.  Additionally, it is economically damaging
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa The wealthiest New Jerseyeans have left the state, hurting tax revenues.  NY has also suffered from drops in revenue due to their taxes.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa As am I.  Once you factor in state and local taxes, it  nears 50%, which is absurd.  We already have a progressive tax code now, and an absurdly progressive one in NJ.   People cannot afford to live in this state.  And people who do have a lot of money would be fools to stay here
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa No one even paid anywhere near that top rate though.   And high taxes that persisted on all Americans for decades were a burden on our economy.  And it IS a majority of their income, even now, for some Americans
RT @EliLake: @barbaraslavin1 Is this a joke? The real reformers are dead, in prison or exiled. Open your eyes. The only thing to negotiate‚Ä¶
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa In NJ, many middle class/upper class families are taxed at near 50% or more, if you include local and state taxes
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa And who cares if you think they "can afford to"?  It's not your money and the government has no right to take most of it.
@jaketk33 @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Of course I know how taxes work, and unlike you, I know history.  To some, that 70% rate will be on the majority of their income.

@Finefragrancefa @JakobIsSmug An therein lies the problem.  Socialism is based on greed and jealousy.  If the government seizes most of your income, how are you free?  And this is before state and local taxes (and as we have seen in NJ and NY, skyhigh taxes have caused the wealthy to flee)
@JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It is certainly oppressive in my opinion, and immoral, and ineffective.
@NicholasDonohou @JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Stealing from the rich, people who have usually worked quite hard for their property, does not work.  Socialism is a proven failure.  To paraphrase Thatcher, socialists will make the poor poorer as long as the rich are less rich.
@JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa Tyranny is merely oppressive government.
@JakobIsSmug @Finefragrancefa It is certainly tyrannical for the government to steal well over half of your hard earned money.  And it is a stupid, socialist policy that does not generate wealth and does not better society.
@Finefragrancefa They are proposing a wealth tax and a 70% marginal tax rate.  That is tyrannical.  Also, to fund even a fraction of their programs, they will need to raise taxes on most Americans
@Finefragrancefa If Ocasio, Omar, Sanders, Warren, etc. get their way, we sure as hell will.

@giulioiacoviel I do not believe in majority rule.  A radical majority should not be able to take away our freedoms. Our Constitution was designed specifically to prevent majority rule.
@giulioiacoviel And?  Majority shouldn‚Äôt rule on every issue.  Particularly not on issues they are woefully misinformed on.  If that were the case, the Nazis would have won since we never would have declared war on Germany
The majority is wrong.  That‚Äôs why we aren‚Äôt a democracy. https://t.co/xJMwf3Qasd

@mcimaps @joncprevo @BruneElections @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan You can criticize Israel without holding Israel to ridiculous double standards, ignoring the history of the conflict and glossing over countless Arab crimes
@mcimaps @joncprevo @BruneElections @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan Ilhan has yet to renounce her bigoted tweet.

@mcimaps @joncprevo @BruneElections @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan She lied to Jewish people in her district.  And when called out about her tweet, she cried bigotry and railed against "apartheid"

@mcimaps @joncprevo @BruneElections @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan Saying Israel is "hypnotizing the world" and calling for an end to Israel's existence is not "legit critique".  Stop with this crap.  It's antisemitism, plain and simple
@mcimaps @joncprevo @BruneElections @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan She said ‚ÄúIsrael is hypnotizing the world‚Äù.  She also supports BDS, and a one state solution, which will inevitably lead to genocide against Jews.  And another endless diaspora.  Ilhan is undoubtedly antisemitic.
@jclarks074 @LoConservative @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan Of course the GOP has a bigotry problem.  And a Jewish problem. Not denying that.  But the hard-left is quite antisemitic (thankfully they aren‚Äôt the mainstream of the Dems, yet...)

@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese States have existed long before modern times.  And you seem to have endless compassion for a people that control endless land and resources, while not giving a damn about a people who have barely anything
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese The Jewish people have been kicked out of nation after nation.  We now have a small state and we will not leave.  We will fight for our survival, and I don‚Äôt care what the world thinks.   They don‚Äôt care about us.  Never have and never will.
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese You do realize that Arabs have dozens of states, right?  And all we Jews have is this tiny strip of land?  And you are mad about that.  Heck, Jordan is a *Palestinian* majority state.
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese Arabs invaded in 48	Arabs threatened another Holocaust in 67	Arab nations invaded Israel on Yom Kippur. 		Yet, Israel has:	-given PA some control, allowing for a partially Judenrein Judea/Samaria	-given up the Sinai 	-given up Gaza 	-given up the holiest site in Judaism
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese That blaming the Jews for every f*cking thing.  Israel has been invaded by Arab armies multiple times.  Arab governments incite hatred and violence.  Open your damn eyes.  Israel wants to live in peace.
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese Israel has offered peace so many times.  They have offered the entire West Bank.  They have given into Palestinian demands for a Judenrein West Bank.  They have given into demands regarding East Jerusalem.  		Arabs have been at war with Israel for 70 years.  That‚Äôs a fact
@livingpotato @DrewVanDrese @2019politics_ @AHotchchick You denied my history, my culture, my ancestry.  You tried to erase my identity.  Try as hard as you want, but it won‚Äôt work.  I am a proud Jew.  The Jewish people originate from Eretz Yisrael, and it‚Äôs high time we defend ourselves and be free
@DrewVanDrese @livingpotato @2019politics_ @AHotchchick I support two states.  Though that cannot be achieved while Hamas and Hezbollah fire rockets at Jewish civilians, while the PA arrests and tortures people who sell land to Jews, and when the PA pays terrorists
@DrewVanDrese @livingpotato @2019politics_ @AHotchchick A one state solution is a call for genocide of Israeli Jews.   It is a call for another 2000 year diaspora, full of persecution and misery.  We finally achieved our hope of reestablishing a State in our land. We aren‚Äôt about to give that away.
@DrewVanDrese @livingpotato @2019politics_ @AHotchchick He cannot stand the idea of Jews being safe and free in our homeland for the first time in 2000 years.  He‚Äôs a raging antisemite. https://t.co/I31CgUegr2
@AHotchchick Also, not sure what ‚Äúwhite guys‚Äù you are referring to.  Jews aren‚Äôt ancestrally European. And we sure as hell aren‚Äôt treated as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù
@AHotchchick I said I supported Israel‚Äôs existence. I, like 90% of the tribe, am a Zionist.  Never again should our survival be in the hands of a world that hates us.  Arabs control 99% of the region.  Saying that Jews should keep our meager strip of land isn‚Äôt a call for ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù

@_alex_joshua @Karandikar18 @JakobDWe Though settlements aren‚Äôt the barrier to peace.  And I sympathize with many settlers.  Judea and Samaria has been Jewish for millenia.  We have a right to live there.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a bit conflicted.  But for Israel‚Äôs future, a 2 State solution is best, even though it‚Äôs flawed
@Karandikar18 @_alex_joshua @JakobDWe Israel never annexed it.  It isn‚Äôt Israeli.  The PA controls much of it
@_alex_joshua @Karandikar18 @JakobDWe I‚Äôm ok with some settlements, atleast in the Golan and East Jerusalem.  But outside of there, there should be no settlement expansion.
@_alex_joshua @Karandikar18 @JakobDWe A one state solution will be bad no matter what.  There has been progress within Israel towards Israeli Arabs, though it isn‚Äôt realistic for the entire West Bank to ever be Israeli
@polisciguy2011 @_alex_joshua @Karandikar18 @JakobDWe I‚Äôm ok with most of the Nation State law, but certain aspects are bad.  Arabic should remain and official language, and ‚Äúequal rights‚Äù should remain as law.

@livingpotato Jews, Muslims, and Christians live in Israel, all with equal rights.   We have a right to self determination.  Now, after 2000 years of misery in the diaspora, our destiny is in our own hands.
@livingpotato @2019politics_ @AHotchchick Yes, because that‚Äôs worked out so well in Jewish history.  We have a right to self determination after all these years of misery, and we sure won‚Äôt give it up so Arabs can have another state.

While we all trace most of our genes back to the Land of Israel, there are Ashkenazi, Sephardim, Mizrahim, and others.   And most Jews in Israel aren‚Äôt from Europe (and Ashkenazi aren‚Äôt European either)
@Polit_eurOpines @livingpotato @jackcurran49 He‚Äôs claiming that Jews, sorry ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù, are ‚Äúethnonationalist Europeans‚Äù.  He‚Äôs a revisionist, a liar, and an antisemite.

@Karandikar18 Israel has a pretty strong justice system.   Former PMs have gone to jail.  Also, Gantz is a pretty formidable challenge.  Not sure if he can form a majority, but it‚Äôs possible
@Karandikar18 Netanyahu won‚Äôt be in for much longer, even if he wins re-election.
@Karandikar18 Israel would benefit from say, a three or four party system.  Joint List, Zionist Union (Labor), a centrist alliance, and a right of center alliance.  Some parties have too much influence now
@Karandikar18 The Tkuma faction, possibly.  Likud is standard right of center.  It just has to be in a coalition with Jewish Home and others to stay in power.
@Karandikar18 And there are the religious parties (Shas and UTJ), and the four Arab parties forming the Joint List, ranging from communist to Islamist
@Karandikar18 Israel has 6 right of center parties, none of which can really be described as fascist, other than *maybe* parts of Jewish Home.  There are two centrist parties (Hosen Yisrael and Yesh Atid), the left of center Zionist Union, and leftwing/farleft Meretz.
@Karandikar18 Of the main parties, none is really ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù  Though on of the Arab parties is Islamist, and the Tkuma wing of Jewish Home has some borderline fascist members.

@jackcurran49 If settlements were the obstacle to peace, there‚Äôd be peace in Gaza right now.
@jackcurran49 I generally agree with Netanyahu on everything other than settlements.  He isn‚Äôt even that hawkish.  He just has to please settlers to keep his governing majority.
@jackcurran49 Israel withdrawing would require the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Israelis.  It would also lead to mass terrorism and threaten Israel‚Äôs existence.  It isn‚Äôt feasible unless there is a peace deal, which will have to include land transfers
@jackcurran49 While I don‚Äôt dislike Netanyahu, he is corrupt and his coaltion is reliant on settlers and the ultra orthodox.  I have nothing against those people but some of their preferred policies are not in Israel‚Äôs best interest. Hopefully there is a new gov. after the elections in 2019.
@jackcurran49 Israel‚Äôs electoral system is really messy.  Netanyahu is disliked by a decent majority of Israelis, but he wins because he is able to hobble together a coalition.  There are so many parties, and pro-settlement parties usually end up forming part of the government.
@jackcurran49 I agree that Israel should end settlement expansion.  Arabs in Israel have full rights, though I‚Äôm sure there can be improvement.  Arabs in the West Bank are under PA control, so unless they withdraw and give it all to the PA, there isn‚Äôt much they can do.
@jackcurran49 When Israel has done similar things in the past, they have only been rewarded with more terror.  Take Gaza, for example.  Israel withdraw.  Hamas now launches thousands of rockets at Jewish civilians.

@jackcurran49 The bias at the UN discredits legitimate criticism of Israeli policies.
@jackcurran49 Yep, Arabs could have had a state decades ago.  Jews accepted the plane, even though it was pretty biased towards the Arabs.  Originally, Jordan (75% of ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù) was supposed to be Arab the the rest was supposed to be Jewish.
@jackcurran49 Again, Israel has no choice.  They cannot allow Hamas and the PLO to control its borders.  Israelis didn‚Äôt initiate the 48 or 67 wars.  Arabs are the main culprits behind Palestinian expulsions.  I don‚Äôt agree with everything Israel is doing, but I understand Israelis‚Äô anger.
@jackcurran49 Israel certainly is not perfect.  They need some reform in that regard, but after 70 years of being under attack, they are fed up.  Understandably.  Palestinians are taught to hate Jews from a young age, which is really unfortunate.
@jackcurran49 I disagree.  When you get a chance read my tweets (though they may not be that coherent.  I typed them quickly).  Not trying to argue though.  Your position is completely reasonable
@jackcurran49 Finally, this is just my opinion, but I‚Äôm sure many Israelis agree: Israel is a tiny nation, the only Jewish state.  After thousands of years of persecution in the Diaspora, we are sick and tired of the world telling us where we can live.
@jackcurran49 certain death or persecution under Arab rule.  So the only option is to wait for a peace deal. Or annex the settlements.  (A one state solution would mean genocide for the Jews)
@jackcurran49 to no avail.  For security reasons, Israel can‚Äôt just leave the West Bank without a peace agreement.  Expecting otherwise is absurd (it‚Äôs also disputed territory. Not occupied.  PA controls much of it). 		Settlers shouldn‚Äôt be forced to leave their homes, and they‚Äôll face (7)
@jackcurran49 Israeli.  Heck, the PA arrests Palestinians who even sell land to a Jew, Israeli or not. 		One finally thing. Sorry for rambling on.  Israeli never wanted the West Bank.  Jordan invaded Israel in 67 and didn‚Äôt want the land back.  Israel has offered peace so many times, but (6)

@RealWendyTeresa @ScottAdamsSays Because I love America, I oppose the President‚Äôs reckless decisions.  Our heroes sacrifice for our liberties.  We should never abandon them, nor our allies.
@venterfrasier And while the Israelis can handle ISIS and Hezbollah, who knows if they can adequate prepare for a possible war against Iran (now that Iran will essentially control Syria)
@venterfrasier Kurds are secular, pro American, pro Israeli, and seek freedom.  They are oppressed by Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey.  Again, we have abandoned them.
@MatthewTackitt Leaving the Kurds and other allies to be slaughtered, and handing over Syria to Iran, is the worst decision he could have made.
@LurchSpun ISIS was partly created due to our premature withdrawal from Iraq.
@Staciopath @ScottAdamsSays Surrendering to our enemies and withdrawing troops for no good reason (other than to please Erdogan and Putin) is isolationism.  It has been tried again and again, and fails every time.
@ScottAdamsSays Public opinion is not always correct, particularly not on foreign policy.  Trump‚Äôs decision is reckless and cruel.  We had 2000 troops in Syria.  Very few deaths since the Kurds did much of the fighting.  It was a good deal for America, and the President threw it away.
Our ‚Äúpersuasive President‚Äù keeps surrendering to the enemies of freedom.  That‚Äôs not winning.  That‚Äôs scarifying the safety and liberty of Americans, Kurds, Israelis, etc. at the alter of isolationism. https://t.co/HoKngwcPR7
