WAKE UP @GeneralBrnovich, @dougducey, @maricopacounty! Our elections are being stolen.		üò°üò°üò°
‚ÄúSo far...in Arizona, the governor and state attorney general - both Republicans - are either uninterested in this issue, or afraid of it.... they need to address it quickly. The presidency and [GOP] majority in the Senate hang in the balance while they sleepwalk past a crisis.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe live in an age of early voting and ballot harvesting and if Republicans truly care about constitutional self-government and about maintaining confidence in the elections upon which our system depends ‚Äì not to mention winning those elections -- they need to take action.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nearly 2 million unsecured ballots. No wonder so many Arizonans were concerned. Yet, the Arizona Republican Party took no substantial action-to the consternation of Republican voters who continue to have unanswered questions about the legitimacy of the certified results.‚Äù
‚ÄúAdrian Fontes was sued for the ‚Äòpremeditated destruction of evidence‚Äô and for ignoring or fudging the signature verification process for early ballots, which accounted for roughly 80 percent of all votes in 2018.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe actions of Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Flores during the ballot count were seen by many observers, including the Arizona Republican Party, as suspect.‚Äù
