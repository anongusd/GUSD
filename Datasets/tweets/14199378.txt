When photography arrived in Japan in the 1850s, traditional woodblock printmakers had to adapt to keep up.		Early cameras relied on natural light, so printmakers produced atmospheric night scenes.

@Ohoura Wilson A. Bentley captured a single snowflake for the first time in 1885. This one from our collections is c. 1890.
In 1903, he sent 500 prints of his snowflakes to the Smithsonian, hoping they might be of interest to our Secretary. The images are now part of @SmithsonianArch. https://t.co/SeZ3E35O8S #FirstSnow https://t.co/rySLkmfve0
"Snowflake" Bentley went on to take thousands more, like this one, which helped support the belief that no two snowflakes are alike. #FirstSnow https://t.co/qSA5YOjQHc
Wilson A. Bentley used a microscope with his bellows camera‚Äîplus years of trial and error‚Äîto get a photo of one flake in 1885. (This one is c. 1890.) But he didn‚Äôt stop there. #FirstSnow https://t.co/HpHFaqrlDO
