@JOHNFKN5 @fabian30349 @Jim_Jordan Very refreshing! I would agree. Usually you cannot get a Republican to have a civil conversation. I must say, I’ve given up.

@maggie12161773 @brycetache @StatesUnity Do you remember the Lady in FB County that was pulled over by the local authorities &amp; arrested because she had an Anti-Trump Sticker on her truck? No doubt how she felt. That’s not ok. The VERY 1st Amendment says we have Free Speech. TEXANS looked like idiots NATIONALLY
@maggie12161773 @brycetache @StatesUnity You might be right! I’m a Native. Houston had less than a Million Ppl when I arrived. JFK would soon be sworn in. I know East TX well. My GParents had a place in Broaddus. I have an Uncle in Longview area. Did you know there is only 1 natural Lake in TX? All others are Man Made
@JackieCanada2 @brycetache @StatesUnity You should see some of the T-Shirts I wear. The only thing that saves you in Texas is that it’s a concealed carry state.  So No One Ever Knows What They May Be Getting Themselves Into. You can take the girl outta Texas....

@Darkshner69 @realDonaldTrump Compared to what. Couldn’t be other Presidents. FDR whipped Trumps butt in his 1st term. The Country went on to elect him to a 4th term. He got us through the Depression and WWII SUCCESSFULLY. It brought us together. That’s a President. Trump is a Failed Real Estate Mogul.

@PresWallace Anecdotal my foot! Your calling me a Liar. That’s a Republican trait. Not a Democratic trait. $700.00 and change. Your brainwashed. I take 15 prescription drugs. You can live in your fake little world. But since Trump showed up, &amp; on Social Security, my meds went up. Shoo!
@pam405 @BradHurt6 @JacobAWohl Hahahahaha! I live in Texas and I’m supposed to be a constituent of @tedcruz The Problem is that I’m a BadAss Democrat and Ted only represents Republicans. Every Democrat In Texas knows that. He claims he’s honored to represent TX. He’s a liar too. Democrats are moving into Texas
@BradHurt6 @JacobAWohl Well said! This Jacob Guy is spreading hate all over Twitter. Soon, I’ll deal with him. Hate on Twitter is not ok. Let’s stick to the facts. Let’s face it, Trump is covered in layers of Fat.

@banksterslayer @JacobAWohl NOT!
@JacobAWohl As if! Trump is a Fat Orange Nut Job. He knows NOTHING about running our Government HONESTLY. Oh and He doesn’t have a muscle in his body. Except maybe his jaws from eating cheeseburgers 🍔 He’s not sane. Nor are his tiny base.
@PresWallace My Prescription drugs went up $700. In 2018. He must be giving discounts to registered Republicans only. Which would be Typical of Trump. Prescription Drugs HAVE NOT GONE DOWN IN PRICE. I can send copies of receipts. No Problem.
@TTOPSSS @naretevduorp @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @BWilliams It’s you drinking the kool-aid. If he closes the Government again, We’ll entertain articles of Impeachment. Democrats don’t believe it’s right to shut down over a temper tantrum. He’s unstable and shouldn’t be at the helm. #ImpeachTheMFMoron
@MatejZZ @realDonaldTrump It’s wont happen! Trump made a promise with NO IDEA HOW THE GOVERNMENT WORKS! This is a Democracy. Even if y’all had met your goal on FB, that you didn’t meet. You couldn’t build it without a blessing from The Democrats! The Nov 18 Vote CHANGED EVERYTHING. The People Spoke!
@OptimalLeague @realDonaldTrump That, will never happen. You can’t be a President Of The U.S. from the Penitentiary.
@PresWallace @mrkrkrs @realDonaldTrump Oh and by the way, Your winning days are over. The Mueller report will be coming in within a couple of Months and Trump will be GONE! If that doesn’t do it, Congress will. Trump is an embarrassment that is setting us up for war on our land. #PutinLover
@PresWallace @mrkrkrs @realDonaldTrump Remember last year when Republicans locked away &amp; negotiated healthcare w/o Democrats. Then again they left Democrats out on the TAX SCAM. 2/3rds of The People had NO VOICE. Guess what, Republicans shouldn’t have done that. See, y’all woke an enormous sleeping giant. #NoWallEver
@MatejZZ @realDonaldTrump The U.S. Congress Holds the Purse Strings. Democrats have the MAJORITY in Congress. Remember how McConnell left us out on HC talks? And again on the GOP Tax Scam? Let me just warn you. Y’all are going to hate that even more than we did. We have a resentment. #NoWallNowNoWallEver

@misslilangtree @palomapoetry @rextreking @Leta82407395 @RevJohnBaldwin @BarbaraNye4 @NikkiJoy17 @schuhbdoo @RepSwalwell You can look up The Generation of The Fig Tree. But to inderThe Bible, you have to understand the beginning &amp; the end. Evil started with Adam Eve. They weren’t eating an Apple. Eve then was impregnated by “The Seerpent” which bore Cain. Cain killed his brother Able.
@misslilangtree @palomapoetry @rextreking @Leta82407395 @RevJohnBaldwin @BarbaraNye4 @NikkiJoy17 @schuhbdoo @RepSwalwell So I guess you haven’t read the Bible? Your right every Generation does that. Look around, EARHQUAKES , 51 inches of rain in Houston. Floods by the dz. Revelations talks about a man fitting DJT. It may not happen in this lifetime. Crime, sons killing their parents. Explicit sex.
@cetalley @washingtonpost CJ, thanks for responding the reason I come at them like that is because 1. This is primarily a Christian Identified Country. 2.Republicans always taut their so called Christianity. 3 They THINK THEY BELIEVE. Revelations does proclaim that info. They’ve just never read it.

@CigarsandSEO @washingtonpost Mark my words. All of you will eat crow on anything @Wapo reports. Remember Republican President Richard Nixon? WAPO did that. The Pentagon Papers, THE @NYT &amp; WAPO exposed those filthy republicans who were allowing our serviceman to die to save face. They don’t print fake news.
@CigarsandSEO @washingtonpost I’m sure you’d like that. The Washington Post brought Richard Nixon DOWN. THEN THEIR COVERAGE brought Down The PENTAGON with The Pentagon Papers. They don’t report crap. They report truth. You’re just not smart enough to get it! Can you read? @WAPO

The generation of the Fig Tree started in 1948 when Israel was acknowledged. That was the beginning of end times. that was 70 Years ago.

@Mikemacari13 You bring up JFK’s Dalliances at least it was justified by his Addison’s Disease. DJT was sleeping with Prostitutes right after the birth of his Son. He’s cheated on ALL 3 of his wives. I can’t believe that you’d leave yourself open for that. And HE CONTINUES TO LIE! #TimesUp
⁦@Mikemacari13⁩ Trump wants to cull these trees out. They seeded 300 years before Christ. That’s one way I make decisions. What people DO! These trees only grow on the west side of the Sierra Nevada in CALIFORNIA. That’s really why he wants to cut them. He hates Democrats. https://t.co/oZKP2Hg3Ke

@thewe @patschurman @Thalia_Nyx @thehill @USAGSessions @Yale It’s more like REPUBLICANS don’t do research. Because you follow &amp; support a “man” who lies in our faces 7.3 times a day, that would possibly make you much like him. Y’all are gullible &amp; naive.

@thewe @patschurman @Thalia_Nyx @thehill @USAGSessions I would never normalize Pedophilia. By the way, you just contradicted your earlier tweet. Pedophilia is NOT a political issue.

I’m asking you nicely to not even respond. Any further communication, I’ll refer to Twitter.
Morality can’t be successfully legislated. W re to Abortion, why is it that Men aren’t held accountable for impregnating women? The problem starts w Men.

But I’m responsible for me. It is me that will face my Lord &amp; be judged. Read Matthew 1 1-3. Then finish it. The Right has CHOSEN to do God’s Job.
@thewe @patschurman @Thalia_Nyx @thehill @USAGSessions Democrats DO NOT act like that. I see trump republicans like this: Most tout Christianity. Have you readThe New Testament? If so, it’s impossible to support trump &amp; call yourself a Christian. If you know what JC taught us, than I cannot understand how any of you do the following:
⁦@HouseGOP⁩ ⁦@SenateGOP⁩ THE MONEY THAT ALL OF YOU GAVE AWAY, BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. You may be wealthy with great medical benefits, you all better leave the Country or get body guards! Y’all are so shallow. I DARE YOU TO CROSS THIS LINE! https://t.co/bQE1PFTF6a
⁦@RepSteveStivers⁩ NO! 1st of all Republicans f*cked up giving a trillion away to the rich. 2nd this is The People’s MONEY! Take it out of The Military. We paid that money in ALL OF OUR LIVES. When we take the House, WE WILL CUT YOUR BENEFITS. IDIOT! https://t.co/bQE1PFTF6a

@thewe @patschurman @Thalia_Nyx @thehill It never happened under Obama like what Trump’s doing. And moreover those Asylum Seekers would have been given a fair day in court. Trump is doing ANYTHING to deport them back to the danger they came from w/o their kids! @BarackObama would never do what Trump is doing.
@thewe @patschurman @Thalia_Nyx @thehill I get that, &amp;  all great choices. Why not the separation of families? Most of the people that came to our border, came for asylum. Donald Trump &amp; @USAGSessions keep changing the rules to suit their Bigotry. That is a worthy talking point. Who will save you when they come 4 you?
@Zakiyyah6 I absolutely Agree. If @NancyPelosi  wants to remain in her position, and Zak she’s GOOD. She should NEVER DISPARAGE any member of the Democratic Caucus. She publicly apologized! Her relationship with our Mighty Maxine is intact. Don’t keep stirring  Sh!t
@davidhogg111 You should take that Tweet about @TeamPelosi down. Your showing your IGNORANCE Never disparage any Member of The Left! Look at the resources your tying up that could be spent fighting the enemy. Stay with what you know. I say you get a pass this time. TAKE IT DOWN!

@nancyPelosi raised 191 MILLION over the weekend in The Napa Valley. Age CAN BE relevant. @davidhogg111 ISNT OLD ENOUGH TO CALL NANCY OUT. Young man, consider sticking to what you know. NEVER SPEAK AGAINST MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY. ESPECIALLY NOW! You should STAND CORRECTED! https://t.co/mHsRU3sxOB

Donald Trump’s IMMATURE REMARKS TOWARDS ANY HUMAN BEING IS NOT FUNNY! His Behavior is unbecoming a POTUS. I didn’t vote for him &amp; he’s NOT MY PRESIDENT! His uncouth BIG MOUTH &amp; Behavior towards any OTHER POTUS is DEPLORABLE. YOUR SH!T EATING GRIN SHOWS YOUR NO BETTER. @PressSec

@TheMarieFonseca @SenFeinstein @chelseahandler Their purpose in tweeting all that follow them is to WAKE US UP! I wasn’t picking on you. Were you alive during the Vietnam War?
