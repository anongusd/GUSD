@SenateGOP fair tax reform will easily pay for it. a better question: why does the GOP love air and water pollution so much? could it be the 10s of millions $$$ the oil and gas industry contribute to republicans annually? you're all bought and paid for. you sell americans out with no shame.
8. their jobs numbers pale in comparison to those created by green industry	9. they refuse to mention the GND will be paid for with fair-minded tax reform and the rich paying their fair share
4. they really love to support and sustain gun violence	5. they do not have a platform based on truth or facts	6. they continue to boast of economy numbers equal to those of obama when the economy was a "disaster"	7. they avoid the deficit unless they evoke the GND

@Jim_Jordan you would not admit you lied and concealed the sexual assault of hundreds of boys over a 10 yr period. your word will never mean anything. you would be in jail if the pedophile had not committed suicide. i'm sure of it
@KYComer i believe cohen over any republican currently serving in congress or senate that supports trump
the @GOPoversight are terrified cohen will tell the truth. they are bugging out. hysterical
@Jim_Jordan america did not vote for trump
@Jim_Jordan twisting words to the degree you just did is a sure sign of a sociopath
