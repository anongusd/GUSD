Successful companies will develop tech to solve real problems for automakers and customers. Not just tech for tech's sake. #DETSW17
Future of auto services for #entrepreneurs: identify a problem and scale it -- you just have to be first. #DETSW17
Different auto amenities will vary based on purpose. Eating, sleeping, working out or just commuting? #autonomous #DETSW17
Auto will carry the hardware, #startups will bring the disruption, push the industry forward. #autonomous #DETSW17
Future of automotive services: Drive through the night while sleeping: arrive refreshed and ready to go. #AutonomousVehicles #DETSW17
If #autonomous eliminates crashes, will we need #insurance? Future of automotive services #DETSW17
#Rideshare vehicles will be on the road 23 hours a day -- hard on chassis. Maybe #swappable interiors?
#DuraAuto: once new tech is adopted, downstream technologies follow. Same will happen for #autonomous. #entrepreneurs #DETSW17
