@realDonaldTrump Stop being Children. Mindless drones who do the bidding of a deranged geriatric lunatic. He should be in a retirement home golfing all day... not destroying our country...while he golfs all dau. Get over it...hes a turd. Not the diamond in the ruff you were hoping he'd be.
Whats a better Dirt Bag Mobster Nickname for Don-ald Trump?		Or add your own suggestions in the comment section.
@realDonaldTrump Whats a Better Dirt Bag Mobster  Nickname for Trump?
@realDonaldTrump You've started more hate groups, between what I assumed were once good people, on both sides I'm sure, than any other President, we've ever had		You are the "GREAT DIVIDER" 		Breaking America down and destroying it, piece by piece		Had you cared, you would have resigned already
@realDonaldTrump Be nice if Caucasian Americans would stop listening to you and see you for what you are... an insecure geriatric man, (with limited vocabulary, slanderous ignorance, and indifference) toward anyone outside of your billionaire circle.
Stupid says what? 		Amazaon leaving NY city has nothing to do with far left liberal ideologies and everything to do with your smoke and mirrors in the economy finally dissipating. 		When big business starts running away from a stacked deck... the Market is gonna take notice.
@EdKrassen Hypocrisy ... vast majority if Americans no longer care enough for that to be an issue... She probably didnt inhale kike Slick Willy too
@billyeichner Just finished back to back seasons of "Friends from College," the entire show is Freaking amaze ballz... all you guys are funny as heck. Every song at the end throws me and the wife into a nostalgic tail spin. Great job with the show good sir.
@realDonaldTrump Your guilt and constant cries for attention by screaming Witch Hunt is hilarious. Im glad you never gave up on your honey boo boo reality tv star fame... it plays really well with your audience. Your core demographoc really eats that crap up.
@djrival714 I wrote it that way... nit sure what happened...but yeah
So I attended a Draft Beto meeting last afternoon in Vegas. Im super fired up. Between him, Kamala, and Castro... if any 3 of them get the nomination I would be over the moon. If any of them partnered up too a VP role...theyd lock down the next 8 years...plus 8 more after that.
@Onedayatatimeb1 @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump When you find 0 fault in a man who obviously carries many imperfections, my view stands,you have been programmed not to stir the pot,avoid speaking up against his establishment and the cool aid,is being passed around.Thank your husband for me for his selfless 22 years of service.
Watching Farenheit 9/11. Im so upset and frustrated. I cant let this go...Not now... not ever... we're better than this America. If we dont speak up, if we dont fight... if we stop trying... we lose so damn much.

Her unwavering love for all her people... gives me hope for the future... not your hate
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump David why open yourself to so much ridicule, by defending a Treasonous traitor like Stone. If thats the hill you wanna die on... God Speed Brother.	@realDonaldTrump  you sure know how to brainwash em, use em, then discard em and distance yourself from em.
@trypeacenow66 @bannerite Its all calculated, they had to yet again, change the news cycle. Instead of hearing about Roger Stone and the Trump Crime Family's latest loss ... the media can talk about the Govt being back open.

@realDonaldTrump The hard working people who keep this Govt.And Country running cant afford to eat, pay rent, live, but your happy our stock market-which benefits the top 1 percent of income earners in this country and accounts for 80% of all stocks being traded is doing well. Rich get richer yay
@mystcole @NaphiSoc Then I hope you Rot in prison for your crimes against this Country... you traitor.
@realDonaldTrump I hope they stop going to work...its ridiculous that we expect them to work for free...guess you want to treat them exactly like every other contractor who does work for you... make them do the work...then stiff em at the end...&amp; you havent worked a day since you been in office.
The President didnt do nothing wrong... everyone around him and connected to him and his campaign might have... but not him. You know the saying, "If you lay with Dogs, Donald Trump gave you fleas." ------ "Now we all have fleas... gosh damn... I hate fleas!!!"

@lutherkathy22 @realDonaldTrump Im not dancing in circles... no matter what i say... your mind is made up. Even if hes guilty... maybe prosecuted... maybe imprisoned after his time in office... you guys will still scream and shout foul play... Fake news... witch hunt. 		What are you most fearful of?

@HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @TheDemCoalition @BarackObama @JoeBiden @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer 		...But Donors and Party lines drum out any possibility of Bi-Partisan legislations.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @POTUS44 @BernieSanders @JoeBiden @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer 	Political designations need to be dropped. If it was a Secret Ballot without a record of names on who voted which way, I'm sure wed get some type of change that benefits everyone....
@funder @realDonaldTrump Then he would most definitely get prison. Doubt hes willing to gamble on that possibility
Is selling your soul to be Vice President a big deal? https://t.co/60c0IRAzsw
@wardaallen @realDonaldTrump What's worse losing track of classified emails or Conspiring with a Hostile foreign govt. If the latter is proved to be true beyond a shadow of a doubt, does it change your allegiance to President Trump at all?
@wardaallen @HinckJon @realDonaldTrump But bro...great...what about what's going on now...with this President... Hasnt been to one hearing yet, nor any meeting with Mueller... hes not going to either. That should tell you alot...but all you guys focus on is Hilary and Obama...like saint Trumps issues dont even exist.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Why dont you stop unarmed black men from being killed in your own Country first. That's one way to keep people from having to kneel.
@wardaallen @realDonaldTrump You had a tough choice, but I doubt there would be this much drama and corruption after she would have been elected. All her dirt centered around Benghazi and emails(In regard to DNC support). She was questioned many times before the Senate Judiciary committee on both.
@SenGillibrand @Lilly_Ledbetter Senator Gillibrand please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people not to.
@ChrisMurphyCT @Leticia17922167 Senator Murphy,  please do the right thing, Tell President Trump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people.
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Senator Hirono, please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment.

@SenFeinstein Senator Feinstein, please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people not to.
@SenSchumer Senator Schumer, please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people not to.
@realDonaldTrump If any one is looking for a good President, I would urge you to build a time machine, go back to 2016, and expose all these lies and conspiracies to the American public before NOV.
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator Manchin please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have now been found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people not to.
@marcorubio Senator Rubio please do the right thing, Tell PresidentTrump, that if he tries to pardon any of the criminals who've worked for him, who have and been now found guilty, you will consider pursuing Articles of Impeachment. It's unfair and a disgrace to the American people.

@realDonaldTrump For a Presidnet who's tough on crime. Your soft as baby turds when it comes to the criminals who have worked for you.

@MacMcKinseyIV So only 2 of these women should be blonde...if it was an accurate representation of Women in America. It's almost as though they're trying to promote a certain "something," I just cant seem to put my finger on it.
@realDonaldTrump So you want to censor a free press because your feelings get hurt when they report on your shady misdealings. Dude you need a reality check. You have way to much power as it is. I wish the GOP would grow a backbone and put you back in your place. Your a figurehead, not a King.

@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Meanwhile you applaud Putin for ACTUALLY throwing an election. You deny all of your intelligence agencies proof. You have alot of nerve,the last few days calling out other people for things you do 1000 times worse. Please resign. Let America heal from this disastrous divide.
@realDonaldTrump Are you seriously talking about meltdowns. My little kids throw less temper tantrums then you do.
This alone should be a grave breach of the American peoples trust of a shady administration. But theres about 30,000 other scandals linked to this president at the moment. #Vote2020 #ForThePeopleBecauseWeAreThePeople. https://t.co/gypClvrxDP

Either Stand up, Stand in line and vote, Speak up, March, Canvas, and get involved somewhere somehow... 2020 is a big step in refocusing our attention on the issues...not the Presidents Drama. A flipped House will deal with that later. #ForThePeopleBecauseWeAreThePeople.

@marcorubio @marcorubio Sir, I'm a Vet, I'm a Christian, I voted for you in the primary, and I'd vote for you again if you ran in 2020. But till then please speak up and out against this tribal group think, that's corrupting the Conservative Party. For God &amp; Country, in that order. Plz.
@realDonaldTrump The more you cry about it the more apparent it becomes your Guilty. Guilty of what remains to be seen.
@HardballChris Everyone knows he wanted to say	 "B$%^H," he has no class, no morals, no Integrity. This disaster we call President, is a disease that's spreading across America. Like Mad Cow, but self inflicted.
@realDonaldTrump I wo der how many times you called her the "B-Word" in private over the last few days. I'm guessing...  42,000 times... because your vocubalry is limited and your brain dont work so good when your flustered. You need to find a prayer closet and stay in there
@realDonaldTrump So I'm guessing you wanted to call her the "B-word" but thought better against it and went with dog. Everyone knows that's what you meant. YOUR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES...stop acting like a child! My grandma is 72,  didnt get past 5th grade, but 100x's the class. SMDH

@SenMarkey @SenateDems Senator you need to convince a well respected, Trump opposed Republican, to run against him in the 2020 general election perhaps as an Independant. That will chip away at some of the swing state votes that go toward Repubs. Think about it. Pass it on.
Picking a worthy Presidential candidate in 2020 is important. But, I recommend convincing a well Respected Republican to run against Trump in the general election. Divide the votes within the party, and win.  @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @TheDemCoalition @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
@Ocasio2018 You have a chance to motivate an entire generation of progressive thinkers. People who want to grow up, raise their kids, and retire in an Inclusive America. Continue the good fight. Inspire and motivate change along the way. We're all counting on your success.
@realDonaldTrump I love how you somehow managed to perpetuate a black stereotype of missing work and being late into your hate tweet. Have you no class or dignity. Everyone already knows who you pander to.
@realDonaldTrump @themouthmatusow I want to believe that man... I really do...but whens the last time you've been to an all black or Hispanic community?

@The_UnSilent_ @TraceyFromCali @KingJames @realDonaldTrump Awesome and Hilarious
@realDonaldTrump No, Because he is endorsed by a President who lies every 20 mins. No, because your under investigation for conspiring with Russia. No,because you attack the media daily. No because your tolerant of radical racist organizations. No, because you have no family/real Christian values
@realDonaldTrump Not only do you obstruct justice ...you advocate for the obstruction of Democracy too. #Sad
@realDonaldTrump Every day millions of Americans sit behind bars with out a formal vonviction... awaiting trial. Maybe let them all out...see how that works out. Oh and innocent children sit behind cages...waiting for their parents...you damn sure dont care about that.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Good time to do it. With so much heat on you... you definitely want to project the image that you care about faith. After all your going to need alot of prayer when your obstruction charges start coming down the pipeline.
@realDonaldTrump Wow theres definitely something wrong... please check your head.
@realDonaldTrump Kind of the way you use your Children for sinister purposes. I.E. having them collude with Russia and call you back on a blocked number after the meeting ended?
@DonaldJTrumpJr I remember when Obama's kids never colluded with Russia. Good times.

Praying that we don't destroy each other. Praying for the divide to be healed amongst countrymen.  Praying that Love beats hate.
On any other team Mike Trout would almost certainly always Bat 3rd in the line-up. How do we reward him year after year for being the best baseball player in the Bigs? We make him bat 2nd or like tonight throw him in the lead off spot. SMDH. Get more RISP in front of him.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas At sokme point in the near future do youj think Sosh will be forced to shake up the lineup.I was really hoping Puljos would have gotten an at bat there. We have to start scoring in bunches again. Seems like the Angels always hit a multi player cold spell
Go KNIGHTS Go !!!
@Patrick_ONeal He must have gotten a lot of love from his fam and friends for that. Kind of a bitter sweet moment. Your so stoked for you fam-friend for doing so well. But bummed your home team lost. Or maybe they're all know Angels Fans. Even better.

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas @JoseMota05 Not taking anything away from the outstanding pitching performances by both Price and Porcello... but it makes It that much harder for a hitter when umps are gifting so many strikes that just aren't.
@realDonaldTrump Did you gold before and after this dinner
@Markgubicza @JoseMota05 @VictorRojas  All these bad calls for strikes against Angels hitters is really throwing off their swings. They're being forced to chase balls because of the expanded strike zone. Last 2 days we've had some rough Ump calls.
@Patrick_ONeal Those our home team.... putting the smack down in LA. Go KNIGHTS GO!  #VegasStrong
This Chump Ump should be fired. He hasn't called a fair game since the start. #AngelsGettingRobbed
@TimSalmon15 This UMP wasn't doing him any favors either. Making perfect pitches and nothing to show for it has got to be so frustrating.
That's the old Sosh I remember pulling a pitcher who's trying to figure it out for an every dicer reliever. We were just down 3-0 with Othani...now with Bard. We're down 5 more. SMDH. Thanks Mike... lost confidence in an ace way to soon. Shame on you. This jaded UMP isn't helping
@VictorRojas Time to kick some RedSock butt
@Markgubicza @MikeTrout @JUST_JUP @adan_jome @Angels @GRICHARDS26 What an exciting start to this season. It's been so much fun to watch. Winning feels so darn good... I hope this feeling never goes away. Bring on Sho-Time
RT @Markgubicza: #LTBU!!! Big flies by @MikeTrout @JUST_JUP @adan_jome!! Best start ever for the @Angels @GRICHARDS26 with the W! ❄️⚾️🔥
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Chicago Sports Broadcasters talking about Ohtani during the Cubs games. Angels...Angels...Angels...were the talk of the town.
Michael Phelps on the base baths... Way to Swim Maldi
@TKN951 Positive thinking bud... double play coming
What the heck is going on with Richards. Is he Hurt? Tired? Mental Fatigue? I'm so lost right now. Hope he finds and fixes whatever's causing these mental blocks so early in games.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  or even "Beibu San"
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  OMG Othani is the real deal. Can we start calling him "The Beibu"? Thats "The Babe in Japanese. He's simply amazing man.
RT @Markgubicza: #LTBU!! Comeback style! @JUST_JUP with the big 3run HR!! And yes he did it again #ShoTime with a big fly! #Angels⚾️
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Right Field Wall Giveth to the A's..... Right Field Wall taken away from the A's.
@V__Dez Straight Fire
@Markgubicza.@VictorRojas  Why do I feel so guilty every time an Angels player crushes a Homerun over that short wall in Right Field. It's almost not even fair.... ALMOST!
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza I know it's early. But my mind can't help but wonder if at the end of this amazing season... Othani wins a Cy Young award. ROY award and maybe even a Batting title.Skys the limit. But Most importantly... the Wins he'll contribute to. A don't blink season
@Markgubicza @Angels I envy you and Victor brother. Getting to see this amazing season unfold live every game. The Machine going for 3000. Climbing the Homerun LB. Watching Trout dominate in the box and on the field. Witnessing the Awesomeness of Othani unfold. 1-9 competing everyday. Best job ever
RT @Markgubicza: #LTBU!!! What a night! #ShoTime HR⚾️⚾️⚾️ @Angels #GubieTuesdays #MLBHistory
@Markgubicza @Angels The Japanese Phenom is on fire. What An amazing addition to the Angel family. Big Congrats out to Cozart...smashing his first walk-off BOMB!!!
@jaystrod What Bike there's no pics
@Corrinam92 So....what's the verdict
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 	Man I'm so stoked with how well Shoemakers been pitching. We're gonna have a solid starting rotation. Minor hiccup in the 6th. But we have  Big Bats... and I'm loving the new Pitch tracker.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas To the Angels players good health... here here
@AMCTalkingDead Beer Me
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Great game. Pitching was tremendous. Excited to see what Skaggs has in the tank for the rest of the season. 1 win down. 109 to go. Then the playoffs. #WSBound
@Markgubicza @Royals You showed up and put in the work brother. You cultivated a skill through long hours of practice and determination. Way to be Mr. @Markgubicza
Why....ANGELS WHY!!!!!!!! We had this game... Your breaking my heart already...wanted to start the Pre-season with a W
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  I'm glad Albert is looking healthy...feeling good... back to beast mode this season I hope. I'm pretty sure I mentioned that before the season ended last year. He 's gonna crush 2018!
Thank you Jesus... Baseball Season is finally upon us!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Bro im an Angels Warrior in the stands..... lol...hopefully one day...I'll have an opportunity to contribute for the team from the inside of an office. 3 more years till I complete my Masters in Sports Management. Only one team I'd ever want to work for. #GOHALOS
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza	Ok guys I'm ready to join the team. Where do ya need me?
@realDonaldTrump How is this the last chance. If they flip the Senate and the house.... I'm sure they'll get another crack at it. 2018 Elections are right around the corner...and you've pissed of enough people...to actually get out and do something to change the chaos.

The way I hope Sosh runs the line up in 2018:	Cozart	Kinsler	Trout	Upton	Ohtani	Puljos	Simmons	Maldonado 	Calhoun		Man Trout could drive in 200+ RBIs no problem this year with this line up. @Markgubicza @VictorRojas Any chance it shakes out like this? Quick Give Sosh my OD roster
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza 		OMG.....WOW.... Cozart/Simmons/Kinsler/Maldonodo/ Trout/Upton/ Ohtani/Puljos		This is the best team the Angels have ever put together. World Series or Bust!!!
@ChuckRichter70 Diopoto did it
@_ThreeOne They're the Orange Angels of Orange County California
@MLBRandomStats Sosh will never bat Puljos in the bottom of the order.... even though he deserves to hoover around the 6th/7th spot
@pinchexpepito Trifecta
@TodayintheMLB @JakeTylerSimon @MikeTrout @JeffreyTrout @TylerTrout @DebbieTrout27   should be batting 3rd. The guys the best overall player in the game. He's consistently shown that he drives in runs... with those other guys in front of him...he might break records again next year. Just saying....

@Alex_Curry Were you referring to his Minor League team mates at Triple A? High School Ball? Travel Ball? Little League?
@Alex_Curry Did you ask Mike Trout if he's ever been on a team where it was so balanced he could count on every guy to be a hero each night?
@Markgubicza @Rickyj191 @VictorRojas They had a couple of tough losses that last 2 series...but man this SWEEP feels so good. Let's keep it rolling Halos

@Markgubicza I've been blessed to witness so much awesome Angels Baseball History.
@Markgubicza There when Fernado Rodney arrowed at the dugout in the 8th and we came back to win. There the night Mike Trout hit for the Cycle.
@Markgubicza No lie I was at that game in 2009 Torii hit 3 HRs. There in Texas when Morales hit HRs both sides of the plate same inning.
This is history repeating itself.I get that the pitcher has to excute pitches,but when games are lost on managerial decisions..it's an issue
@Jared_Tims I get it... But To do nothing baffles me. Send the pitching coach out there... yell a little at the Umpire... damn do something
@Jared_Tims It's a trend. Some of his decisions are frustrating... of course it's easy to Monday Quaterback... But at this stage I've expected it
@NoGoodRobb That's like Tiger Woods saying he could lead the Patriots to the Super bowl... they cut Brady and them saying... LET'S SEE

@StephenAtHome I'm so excited to see what happens this week on Presidential Apprentice...the plot twists have been riveting so far.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Either way thank you kind sir for the awesome response...you guys are always going above and beyond.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Wonder if there's a glare issue with lights at all at night
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas If he had = amnt of day games he theoretically would have 20HRs, with 47 RBI's at the sane clip if my math is correct.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Is their an upward Trend in day games for Albert V. Night games where he's more productive? You guys have all the stats...just curious?
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza Together ...onward...in hopes of new victories and accomplishments.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Today was a tough loss to swallow.I haven't found the words yet... on the plus side I'm glad #5 hit a nice rythm
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Tonight it clicked.I agree it was a great hitting day. I was thinking maybe it would spark Puljos hitting or walk % by going in front of 27
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Can you please pass on my first 5 starting line up to Sosh. 1) Maybin/Escobar 2) Puljos 3) Trout 4)Cowart 5)Cron
@HoodAdjacent This daily harassment of my minority brothers and sisters has to be exposed and stopped. No more guilty till we prove our innocence
@HoodAdjacent Low key cameras everywhere
@HoodAdjacent Sitting shotgun... see how  long it takes before the cops start harassing them
Do a show with 1 hood dude driving a pimped out car...2 more in the back with the windows down. A white female attorney ...@HoodAdjacent
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 20 LTBUs in a row and we're golden
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  It's heartbreaking. We need a couple of aces on the staff. Albert to get hot. 1st &amp; 2nd base to get hot. LetsGO
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Would Ramirez be a good fit for the Bullpen? And if so where can the Angels get some SP help from?
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 		 Eric Young Jr. Is a blessing from the Baseball Gods. All around 5 tool player.
@realDonaldTrump Russia has them all in a hidden folder on Vlad Putins hard drive.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas When Troutnado comes back right?
Time to go buy a Young Jr. Jersey. What a contributor he's been to this team.He's gotta be in the lineup everyday @Markgubicza @VictorRojas

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 	Man I live hard fought pitching duels. Defense is everything.
@realDonaldTrump So you choose to put down all the major networks hoping your supporters turn off their TV's tomm, instead of listening to Comey shit on you.
@Markgubicza History waits for no man
@Markgubicza A day early.  I came all the way from Vegas with the fam to watch Sundays game, Hoping to catch 600 in person. P239 ROW A Seats 17-21.

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 	 All together now... #LTBU	Man the Ball Was flying today.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  	Man so frustrating. What a comeback. Sad we couldn't come all the way back. We need a deeper line up, pitching
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  	Trout has to bat 3rd this year in the 2017 All-Star game right? Who else would be a better option?
I'm gonna need both of you to continue your positive premonitions. Everytime you mentioned something..it happened @Markgubicza @VictorRojas
I see Danny Espinoza isn't dipping that front right shoulder as much. Straight back on the load and through the baseball. @Markgubicza
@CANTHITWRISP Bwhahaha... We all had our jaws on the floor plenty during this game.
@CANTHITWRISP Getting back to .500
@CANTHITWRISP Which one?
Fix your face... We had this the whole time https://t.co/G3Vu8t341K
RT @halosheaven: The #Angels are back at .500, with 21 wins. 15 of those were comebacks, including tonight’s Maybin-fueled epic. https://t.…
@Angels  Can you please just rack up a bunch of runs...and make it a blow out... these late game theatrics are gonna give me a heart attack.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Garcia took Alberts ball to the Face. You don't walk Legends without respecting how they became legends in the first place. #LTBU

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  There is no one more amazing than Trout in baseball. This guy is always changing everything
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas So glad SOSH finally decided to shake up the line up. Breath of Fresh Air... New roles and possibilities.
@Markgubicza @Angels @Athletics @FoxSportsWest How do you see those close plays at first from up there... They give you Military grade Binos. Lol.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Sprinkle some pitching Magic on Myers and settle that man down. Slow is smooth...smooth is fast...fast is deadly.
@StephenAtHome Uhhhh Ted... Do you remember all the mean ...terrible... very sad things ... Trump said about you, your dad, your wife...grow a pair.
@VictorRojas Be honest...You guys up there doing flips and jumping off the sound equipment
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Man I'm looking forward to a return of a healthy rotation...a healthy starting lineup. Flip beast mode to ON!!!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Is that's what's causing him to swing under the pitches? Im rooting for him.Hope he figures it out.Let him know the fans still got his back.
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza What's the adjustment players with hitches need to make?
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza Leaves him late to the ball... constantly swinging underneath cause of that right shoulder dip ... trying to catch up
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza	 Casual Observation: Danny Espinoza is dipping his right shoulder at the start of his swing and overloading which
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza  Game time... Let's Go... Lock it down Shoe...give them nothing...take everytging
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  	I'll never understand why pitchers...pitch away with a defensive shift on. They're pitching against themselves
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas How hard would it be for Cron to learn how to play second base. Danny needs a little break.
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza WE GOT THIS! Positive vibes...Good energy...And we'll take down the pitching Monster know as Paxton. Due for an L!
Today I've realized I'm more broken than ive ever been

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas @Markgubicza @VictorRojas Observation 3) Jeffery Marte is completely psyched out by the 2nd baseman playing shallow right field. Talk to him
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas @Markgubicza @VictorRojas Observation 2) Espinoza is consistently swinging UNDER high fastballs.Every at bat has at least 2 high in the zone
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas @Markgubicza @VictorRojas everything else out of the strike zone. Convince him to swing and that first pitch and adjust from there.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Some casual fan observations. 1) Puljos 9/10 watches the first pitch strike down the pipe. Proceeds to chase...
RT @Markgubicza: @TonyrayJkSilva @VictorRojas The team just needs to get some traction now my man. I still believe they'll be solid.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Our Pitching Rotation has taken a beating the  last few years. LF still seems shaky production wise. I'll always be an Angel fan Win/Lose
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza What can Sosh do to change our current downward spiral. Losing is killing me. I think I need 2go2 a hospital now.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  At some point Sosh is gonna have to shake up this Line-Up...Right?
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  The Machine found his swing...The Big Fish put another Fisherman on the hook for a LOSS...and the team is flowing
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  I LOVE IT!!! What an amazing Job Nolasco did tonight. One mistake pitch in the 1st inning...lights out since.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas 1st Time I've ever seen an Angels Pitcher with less Pitches Thrown than King Felix. Let's GO HALOS!!! #Get_A_W

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Who holds the record for most singles and or doubles over a career in the 1st inning?
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Man I love Crons power. So happy he's back in the lineup...exactly the protection Trout and Albert needed
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Yo one of you got to have the inside scoop. Is there a chance we get Puig?
@RealKidPoker We might be failing...gotta watch out for the global reset button at this point
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Puljos keeps rewriting History.Trout is on fire.Kole is regaining his groove.Kron is back on fire. WORLDSERIES2017
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas It is such an exciting time to believe and watch Albert Puljos rewrite history just about every night.#Keepitgoing

@Bload22333 @Markgubicza @VictorRojas  That don't sound right pretty sure babe ruth held the record for most career "1st inning home runs"
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Can you guys please put up where Albert Puljos stands on the most "1st inning home runs" record tomm. And most B2B
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas @TimSalmon15  Guess Garret Andersons speech really inspired the Yankees. SMH Come on Halos
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  exactly. If every other team is having 1st pitch success we should 2...heck even Escobar is a 1st pitch swinger.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Do you think there's any chance we pick up Trumbo and Cespedes... Move Trumbo back to 1st. Cespedes to LF. St8 Lit
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  That non called strike...turned home run...warranted more than a Sosh Shrug... where's the fire in that man's ♡
@FishGLoomis @HecSantiago66 @Twins We need ya back in Orange County ASAP. Angels would have at least won on your starts. Damn it
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas How much rope is Arte Moreno going to give Sosh before deciding on a new direction for Management?
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Who put a curse on us? Who brought a goat to the field? Is it Voodoo? Gotta get this bad Ju-joo off of us. #Win1
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas I dvrd the game cause I was at church this afternoon. Street needs to be moved. We should trade for some prospects
@VictorRojas #NoANGELtrades
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Do you guys like hypothetical questions?what would our record be... Hypothetically... if we had picked up Cespedes
@CANTHITWRISP dudes a donkey
Lincecum has been terrible. I think it's time to put him in the bullpen as a long reliever and bring back Chacin to the starting roation.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Tonights a tough match up.Time to call in some wishful thinking at bats.Like Trout and Puljos bothgoing yard twice
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas I lost my voice screaming in excitement. Thank God there was no one backing up the catcher. Love it. LIGHTITUPBOY
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Say Mike Trout is due for a home run in the 9th. You always call it before it happens. Power of Positive thinking
@StephenAtHome  So f*ing epic. Dude is a legend. I encourage all of you to WRITE-IN Jon Stewarts name on the ballot #VOTEJonStewart4Pres
@Angels_Nation27 J.M.
@StephenAtHome I miss Jon Stewart. Tell him to run as a 3rd party candidate. I'd bet my left nut he'd win the Presidency. i  Miss his genius
You don't trade the Babe Ruth of our Generation!!! Angels fans would die of broken hearts if the Angels ever traded away @MikeTrout
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  @HecSantiago53 Command the zone. Your movement on your fastball is electrifying. Breathe...relax...Have fun.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas If this Win streak is a dream... please don't wake me up.  Freak em up and lock down 5 in a row Timmy!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Kole should move back to lead off.Take the pressure off of getting RBIs and back to getting on base.Still♡him tho
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Ive run the baseball analytics.Kole has killed more rallies by hacking hard in the 2 spot. He should clean up
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  So we're 70% to Win according to your friend who guest commentated. I love those odds. #5 going deep in the 1st
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Best decision Sosh has made all season.. letting his stellar pitcher Win or Lose at his own hand. #Lightthatbabyup
@Angels  Coincidence. .. I think not...let's run an 80's theme tonight and win 8-0
@Markgubicza @Angels Throw me in the box.I'll call a game with the two best commentators in Baseball.Might have to bleep me a bit if we lose
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas When are you guys gonna have a "Fan in the Corner" guest commentator spot for an inning. When your ready put me in
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  So I saw a post on MLB news the Angels have a .01% to make playoffs. I'm like "So, your saying there's a chance!"
@Markgubicza  that's Timmys  game...through no fault of his own.Sosh should have left him the hell alone and finish the damn game. SO PISSED
@Markgubicza Hope that 70% 1st inning lead win stat kicks in soon!!! Rally time Angels
@MattShoe52 @dnavs33 I'm just glad the offense scored enough runs to prevent MikeSosh from making terrible managerial decisions that cost Ws
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Slow is smooth...smooth is fast...fast is deadly. Let's go out there today Gents...Call a God game and secure a W!
@MikeTrout  Let's hit for the cycle tomm bud. Ain't nothing to it but to do it.
@MikeTrout Your welcome. Thanks for noticing
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza  Hey Angels fans member when we had the opp to GET Cespedes in LF. He's batting .300 w/20 HRs.Pfft who needs wins!
@Markgubicza Likewise Brother ... Hope of the Free because of the Brave. God Bless America!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Play Devil Advocates a lil. Why wouldn't Sosh challange the two on 1 out Cron at the plate foul of the glove ball?
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Blows my Mind that it hasn't been attempted once. At least try it once...geez
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Why don't one of you get down there in BP and show Kole how to bunt against the shift.
@Markgubicza @RedSox @Angels we got ripped off in that 9th inning. Can I sue MLB as a very distraught super van.
@JessTara  Congrats
Hey @TerribleHerbst! I want to play the #BigStuffGiveaway! https://t.co/QZxgrcp1xe #BigStuffGiveaway
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas The opportunities with Runners on keeps getting squandered.Kole is HR swinging to often w/runners on and ending In
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas It's time to move Kole to the clean up spot.His swing has gotten way to big and he keeps cheating Trout w/runrs on
@PujolsFive @MikeTrout @KoleCalhoun Look at the tape. I'm not wrong over 92% of the 2nd Pitches thrown are way out of the zone. Swing 1st P
@PujolsFive @MikeTrout @KoleCalhoun Please tell Albert stop swinging at the 2nd Pitch after a 1st pitch fastball. Always out of the zone.

@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Nothing to show for his performance tonight...something you say way to often. Breaks My Angel heart everytime.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Is it frustrating 4you as Angels announcers to watch games slip from our hands.What's your inside voice screaming?
#Halostration Thats frustration while watching the Angels nose dive. I'm a fan to the butter end. But damn it Arte Mike Sosh has got to go
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Not trying to be cute or funny. I love Albert Puljos but is there possibly a corrective lens issue. Contacts?
@VictorRojas Have your stats guys look up how many 1st pitch strikes Puljos gets then how many 2nd Pitch balls lead to 0-2 Counts. Please.TY
@CANTHITWRISP @xbreannaleighh  Mike Scoscia needs to bow out
Angels should Option Mike Scioscia to Triple A. Oh he's out of Waviers.. guess we'll just let him go then. 20 years and one title. #SOOVERIT
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  A's go out immediately to talk to their falling behind picture. Angels wait till their pitcher drops 3 runs. SMH
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  We have the best Player in Baseball on the worst managed team in baseball. Doesn't correlate.
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza  Please tell Arte Moreno to Make a Management change. This team is falling into oblivion. Too many losing seasons
@HustonStreet  Maybe instead of trusting the umpires, you should trust Carlos Perez behind the plate. Stop shaking him off so damn much.Ego×
Boycott till Arte Moreno FIRES Mike Scioscia!!!! Gotta hit him in the pocket book until he gets it. Mike Scioscia is a disease. #BoycottFIRE
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza  What's the logic behind not sending up the pitching coach right away. Why wait till 3 runs are on the board. SMH!
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza 2nd Pitch way out of the zone. And he always swings at it. Pitchers know if they get ahead go way outside the zone
@VictorRojas @Markgubicza Will one of you guys please tell Puljos to stop chasing the second pitch of every at bat. 1st pitch strike...
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas So Mike Scioscia has a jobfor life huh?Winone championship in 20 years and youbecome an Untouchable?I don't get it
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Don't worry ANGELS fans were gonna sweep Cleveland.We kill Above .500 win teams. It's the subWin teams we lose 2.
@VictorRojas What's the Wins Stat against +.500 teams vs. -.500 teams? My bet is they win against good teams and bomb against bad teams.
@VictorRojas if a pictures job is to be unpredictable with his pitches what foes it benefit a batter to be very predictable each at bat
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas it should be the starting pitchers decision to stay in or not. It is after all their game to lose. Deceiving stat.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Scioscia blew another game with another bad defensive decision. How is that even news or shocking anymore. Pffftt!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas We're going for a sweep. Knowing Scoscia he's gonna put Pujols in way to late when the games already over.Sickofit
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Why change the secret sauce today. Going for a sweep and you pull your strongest defender in center and 1st base.
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  At some point Mike Scioscia should bring in the day to day lineup. And defensive positions. This is Ludacris
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas How does Mike Scioscia always find a way to make huge mistakes as a manager. It's extremely frustrating as a fan.
@VictorRojas He and Perez got it working man. Wheeling and dealing when they're together. Their History and Chemistry is rolling.
That chemistry and history between Chacin and Perez is electric. LIGHT THAT BABY UP!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  You guys pump me up!!! 3 RUNS ...YO BABY!!! Let's lock it down boys. Shoot...communicate... Move on out!!!
@VictorRojas thank you guys for showing that respect and love for my fallen brothers. Not a day goes by we don't miss them.
@Alex_Curry @MikeTrout @MLB I wish my battle buddies could have been around to drink a beer with me and watch you play. My heart breaks.

@GaryDiSarcina @TimSalmon15 The orginal halo warriors.I grew up watching you guysand falling in love with the Angels and thegame of baseball
@VictorRojas Game on the line... Baseloaded one out...You have to gamble. Kole was half way home with nobody really holding him on. Dying!!!
Mike Scoscia failing at being amanager again.Why didn't he force the safety squeeze with the basesloaded and Giovatella at bat?@VictorRojas
@JoseMota05 @Alex_Curry @Angels @FoxSportsWest  so your like 20 now
@KoleCalhoun  You need to bunt.Pitchers won't respect your bat unless your bunt.Especially with all the open real estate on the L side of IF
@themouthmatusow  Hey Mike are there any pros in vegas who might host a poker workshop for disabled Combat vets.
@TexDolly  Doyle is there any pros here in Vegas that might potentially be interested in working with Disabled Veterans improve their poker
@Markgubicza That look you give your manager when you refuse to let him blow another game by pulling you out to soon https://t.co/grVVYux09x
I hope Mike Scoscia has a mild stroke..not kill him but definetely enough to retire his ass on medical reasons. Hate his coaching that much
Your an idiot if you don't blame Scoscia for this loss. Dale Scotts a tool. but Mike pulled the best pitching start of the season. #Halofail
@bmags94 absolutely wrong.Mike is always at fault.It starts with him and he's proven over and over again that he will bombwhen games r close
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Mike Scioscia  can't even get tossed defending his "Team" no passion...no real outrage. He should be fired up!!!!
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas Would you honestly say that he's been a good coach since 2002.Compared to MLB? Your probably to corporate 2 answer
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  Everyone sees Scoscias mistakes as soon as he makes a move. Hardly ever seems like he makes the right decision
@ArteMoreno1 please fire Scoscia this is getting retarded. Shoemaker could have pitched through the 9th. Hate this feeling
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas. I just broke my TV. I hate being right. Shoemaker could have pitched through the 9th. Scioscia consistently fails
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas  I'm screaming at my TV.Sit your butt down Mike.Shoemaker was lights out,Why does Scoscia make decisions like this

@Angels.why isn't Dipoto and Arte making moves to put a couple quality bats in the lineup? AL not far@Markgubicza@JoseMota05 @VictorRojas29
How much longer must we suffer through a slumping lineup.No bat support from 1 and 5-9 in the lineup. Literally killing me. @VictorRojas29
Angels need to stop pretending the bats are gonna magically wake up.Trout and Puljos can't be our entire offense everyday. #MakeAMove

@VictorRojas29 Looking over Paul Goldschmidts swing reminds of Rob Carews swing.bat high and shorter to the baseball. Used it to beat Nolan
@Markgubicza wanted to tell ya that Paul Goldschmidts swing looks a lot like Rod Carews swing... bat short to the ball
@niggggght Not that shovking...took similar pics in Iraq. War is hell
Anyone else noticing how much Cowgill is chasing out of the zone... Must be added pressure.  Don't seem comfortable in the box at all
How bout we win a world series this year. Wasnt online for a few m/o cause if it isnt Angels Baseball it really isn't worth talking about.
#Hauntedsprings @springspreserve http://t.co/Ro8iRUJDtP
@str8edgeracer You'll get it figured out...Get back into that solid routine. LAA need a WS ring...Can only happen with a healthy starting 5
Russell Wilson is a special kinda quarterback. ..If only the Raiders had him
It's been real Angels fanatics....See you guys next season...Hopefully with out Mike Sosh...we might have a shot then
Bad coaching decision 236 By Sosh..Starting the wrong guy for game 2. WILSON Amazing @ Home/Sucks on the road. #fireMikeSosh
Wilson logged a5.3ERA in16 road starts this season compared to a3.82 ERA at home.He also finished the regular season 4-8 on theroad 9-2@Home
RT @valdezallen2: @TonyrayJkSilva yeah I know. It's all frustrating right now
@EricP__  Man I'm trying to keep it together my Damn self.Voices in my head are going nuts.LOL.Bats asleep cuz Sosh is fuckin up rhythm
@JennyBaseballl  The impossible is always possible if we possible use possibilities to deter and reroute the outcome.  Bench Jham-FireSosh
@ShannonTucknies  He's a joke man...and KC is gonna laugh all the way to ALCS because Mike has no concept of Win by any and all means nemore
@valdezallen2  don't apologise...at least ur passionate...like me...what's this teams fucken excuse
@ShannonTucknies thank u...guy has no sense of here and now...that's why he makes terrible calls as a coach
@OhItsStacy @Halos82 @EssentialDacome  You can stalk him too...He parks his career in the front parking lot of the show stage. Follow him
CJ only has 3 wins on the road during the reg seas.better at home.Mike Scoscia should have pitched him tonight.Shoe Sun.Called it 3 days ago
@JennyBaseballl  Dude has only won 3 games on the road this season...Wonder if that makes ya feel better. Cuz my nuts are in my throat
@chazlong21 @MikeDiGiovanna  Mike Scoscia " Uhhhh I'll just wing it again, That book looks hard to read."
Teams that look unbeatable...crushing balls to all yards...Baltimore and Giants...Wish my Angels were playing with that much fire&amp; intensity
@EricP__  No committee...they need to take a lead and hold it...no come from behinds...no pitch in the 12th...Hold a lead take it down twice
RT @EricP__: @TonyrayJkSilva damn so is it really a win by committee? Cause I mean, y'all worked to hard to fold this bad
@EricP__  No wrong sir...He plays better at home...He only won 3 games on the road this year. Far far far worse on the road.
Calhoun has to get on base and score a run without a Kole run we got no chance.Make it happen by any means necessary.Make 27 bunt himover
RT @Baseball_Photos: How is Hosmer's leg not broken? http://t.co/ryFarhSq7O
@Baseball_Photos  Looks like a paraplegic swinging a bat!!!
@ShannonTucknies  I'd rather be 430 dollars poorer to at least seem them force a game 5
I'd rather see the world end and a meteor crash into Las Vegas leveling all of us...then watch my Angels lose Sunday. Guess im playin holdem
@andrewkarcher @JennyBaseballl  48
@EssentialDacome Break the glass , steal it , run as fast as u can past security into the locker room, hold it up and yell...Play with ♡

@TheZachWalton27 @Angels @Trouty20 @MattShoemaker33 @KoleCalhoun @thejoshhamilton @PujolsFive @HustonStreet @Freeser6 GET FIRED UP ORITSOVER
Fuck your interview Mike Scoscia...Your what's wrong with this team losing you and JHAM is the fucking Cure all.  I point at u dipshit.
Two amazing KC outfield plays that save a sure lose to force extras...and two KC Bigflys to put us away.Fucken hurts man. Kills me.Seriously
I'm always gonna be a die hard Angels fan win lose or draw...And I will always call out the bad or stupid shit they do or don't do.
@Trouty20 1st pitch strikes...FUCKEN SWING. Stop waiting for bullshit out of the zone pitches.All U do it on bouncing Breaking balls indirt
@rhandler33 He loves chasing up and in and way outside and away...Up the middle would be to easy.
@Trouty20 @PujolsFive @CCron24 Somebody better scream and yell and throw some shit in the dugout.No heart no emotion. PS is coming to an end
Swing first pitch Mike...What the fuck does it matter at this point
Shields vs Wilson...Good season ..Mike Scoscia go suck a dick...U should have kept JHAM on the bench...Fucked up bunts/hits/calls..FUCK YOU
RT @Halored27: Just cuz we criticize our team doesn't mean we are haters or so called fair weather fans. I just tweet based on what I see a…
And all u dumbass saying it's not Josh Hamiltons fault.again wake the fuck up we won 23 games without him&amp;took the best record run.
CJ the biggest choke artist of the season is pitching tomm and everyone's saying be positive. U guys are in denial wake the fuck up.Its Over
Why even fucken try Ianetta...You havent done shit behind the dish all series. Hold the fucken ball idiot.
@rkridley That last series against Seattle destroyed the teams vonfidence
I knew this shit was gonna happen. I'm so fucken heartbroken right now. B2B KC Big flys to kill us. The team that had the fewest HRs RegSeas
Great season guys...Shitty fucking coaching means shitty playoffs. ..Mike Scoscia can go suck a dick fat ass worthless coach. 5 yearsofBS
You piss away opportunity after opportunity with bad coaching decisions expect to lose in extras. Fuck u Mike Scoscia...I blame u..notAngels
@bmags94 Egos.KC has noproblem shelving there's to win a ball game.Mike Scoscia caters to his big name guys EGOS no matterHowBadtheyreplayin
If we lose these Series...ARTE MORENO needs to fire Mike Scoscia...Screw his contract his coaching style is outdated...No energy no heart♡
So for all u idiots who said take it easy on Josh Hamilton...Wasn't his fault...Enter how many times u said "Fuck Man...C ' Mon Josh again"
If Josh Hamilton took 3 pitches every at bat...He'd be looking at a 3-0 count 85% of the time
@TonyrayJkSilva Aghhhhh I hate being fucken right when Mike Scoscia makes it so easy to show him how fucken wrong his coaching is
@Angels_Nation27 @Angels  I'm not...Making me barf...we should be blown out the Damn royals
Come on @Trouty20...You were the ALL- Star MVP...That was a way bigger stage than this first round ALDS game!
He almost beat out freeze to the bag at 3rd...damn he's fast...Do something amazing...Do something amazing...do something amazing....2-3-4
RT @25Bombdiggidy: @TonyrayJkSilva you couldn't have put it any better. Well said. I agree 110% with you.
Fat ass Scoscia get out of the fucken dugout and fire your team up by getting in the UMPS face your heartless coward. Ebel coaching we win
@TonyrayJkSilva Sounds like progressive baseball thinking to me you heartless fucking bastard. Fuck your coaching technique
Ianetta don't know how to fucken bunt Mike Scoscia? Easy fix dumbass PH for him w/someone who can.man on 3rd Scores.EnterConger.FuckenIdiot
I don't think a single Angel stole 3rd in the reg season? Am I wrong?
Stupid ass Mike Scoscia...yes dumbass...now u should bunt Cron over to bring in the run fucking idiot...no coaching skills whatsoever
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza  All that down time kills momentum.Play a 6 inning simulated game. Keep the Angels sharp. Breaks kill momentum
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza Can u please talk to ArteorDipoto and tell them if we clinch next season keep the AAA Bees on standby 4scimmages
@chazlong21 @JennyBaseballl @bmags94 Didn't mean they were the best pitchers,they won 99 games that year, With 5 pitchers we have 2.
@chazlong21 @JennyBaseballl @bmags94 JarredWashburn/JohnLackey/RamonOrtiz/KevinAppier/(AaronSele-injured)/Mickey Calloway became 5thStarter
@AdamDrex I'd rather lose with him not in the lineup...worse that can happen someone in his spot might actually contribute
@AdamDrex  U bring a guy in that struggled all season into a game after not playing for 20 something games...He shouldn't be in the game
@AdamDrex The rest of the team contributed during his 50 game absence.even in the line up he never was a game charger. What are u talkinbout
@AdamDrex @KarenNSports put yet people who filled in while he was gone managed to contribute to every game so yeah...u can blame him
@PlayoffChokers  That's what I'm saying u want me to be positive talk to me after we win this series
@AngelsFamily27 @VictorRojas29  @Markgubicza  Expect it tomm then...If Mike Scoscia decides to make stupid decisions that hurt our team
@TonyrayJkSilva  Seriously players played with no heart cause our coach has no fucking heart...evident in that siutation. Starts @ the top
@AngelsFamily27 @TaylorBlakeWard  He's so on point..calls it like it is...Calls out the coaches on the in game BS
Umpire makes a horrendous call on Aybars check swing and u yell from the dugout..get out of the dugout and kick up some dirt douche bag!!!!!
Sad...Real Sad...but with Mike Scoscia failing epically yet again as a coach It hurts my heart to say I don't see us winning. NOT WITH HIM
@EssentialDacome @haloshead  That or we lose the post season because Scoscia is to chicken shit to bench a worthless overpaid piece of shit?
@krissimms  I'm fired up but the ad almost broke my 80' TV...FML
Ohhh u see that I called it...it's the truth that guy has no current baseball strategy instincts.
@TheLegiitNikki amazing...@VictorRojas29 you should bury Josh Hamiltons ass to...worse than Vernon Wells these days
@AngelHolicz @Trouty20 @PujolsFive @CCron24 @thejoshhamilton  Show some fucken emotion. Play with some fucking heart. JHAM ask to be benched
@bmags94 2 balls JHAM and Mike Trout should have caught to prevent BS runs
RT @rkridley: @AngryAngelsFan no one would buy him
@EssentialDacome  For the rest of the fucken series...P.O.S...twist ur wrist again Mr worthless
Fucken Aoki makes the catch of the game that ball gets away we win game 1
RT @KarenNSports: Stupidest things Scioscia has done tonight? Bunt Calhoun and pull Freese.
@JennyBaseballl @bmags94  Yeah they did but they also had 5 solid starters we have 2
@TaylorBlakeWard and CJ takes it the day after...He's considerably worse on the road...bad pitching rotation set up by Mike scoscia
Angels lost because Mike Scoscia fucken sucks at making key decisions and JHAM is the teams achilles heel...we were on a hot streak W/O him
@SeeingRedAgain  We're amazingly better with out him
@PlayoffChokers  Because Scoscia is a trash fucking manager...stupidity and moral killing is his calling card...He fucks us every year
I want to punch that fucking home plate umpire in the nuts...U fucking queen ass homo bitch...FUCK THIS GAME
Thank you again Mike Scoscia for over coaching this game and fucking us yet agajn. Ur a piece of shit.I hate everything about ur managering
Why doesn't Scoscia got straight steal 1st pitch then bunt him over to third...1 out ..we win the ballgame..chicken shit
Fucking rally killer JHAM bum
Fuck you Mike Scoscia for making Kole BUNT 3-1...Ur fucking fault not his...He's a hitter...let him fucken hit with a prime count dipshit
If only Josh Hamilton &amp; Trout would have made those plays...We'd be looking at a different scoreboard 2-0 Angels...Damn it
@EssentialDacome  That's dope homie...u should snap a pic of him...what side is he sitting on...see if I can spot him on tv
@EssentialDacome  You lying...Post a pic of usher
U suck donkey balls TBS/TNT...Who gave you the postseason TV contract...smack yourselves! !!
Puljos Just bitch slapped Aoki in the grill...stay on the bag hoe
I hate Mike Scoscias managing. Wilson should pitch @home his record is worse on the road and @HecSantiago53 has been more reliable than him.
Billy Beane.. Goodnight...You sewing up most of the best pitching in baseball went to shit...Blahahahaha...Suck it Chokeland
Royals got heart...Hate the As...kiss their ass sea bass
The Angels could learn something about these small ball tactics.they have been working to perfection.  Scoscia is to fucking stubborn though
An Oak series we would have to worry about tough pitching and opposing team big flys...Fuck all that...Pull it out KC Royals
I'm Hoping Royals win... They have small ball hit and run- steal going for them...but with Howie and Erik playing back there I'm confident
Wow KC Royals are Showing SO Much Life THIS game.Whoever Wins Will INEVITEATABLY lose to the Angels but what a preview to the postseason.
How convenient that Josh Hamilton feels 100% before the playoffs start. SoB...We better not lose because your having trouble with the curve!
@HecSantiago53 Seriously bro alot of games that were lost with you pitching were because of bad coaching decisions on his part. Your an Ace
@HecSantiago53 That slimey bastard Mike Scoscia better let you pitch in the playoffs.As hard as you worked your ass off.Furious if he don't
Mike Scoscia- Destroying Angels Team confidence since 2003.#Dumbass coachingDecisions#ReasonweFail#DoesntmakeTheRightCallEver#firehisdumbass
Again stupid decision to remove Cory for whack ass Thacher, We're gonna lose the post season with Scoscia s dumbass bad decisions. #FireMS
Heros get remembered but legends never die....Farewell Derek Jeter...What a career.
Wow.Mike Scoscia sure knows how to destroy moral within the team. Getting swept before the playoffs is gonna destroy team confidence.Dumbass
Mike Scoscia should have had him pulled last inning...that's why u won't win coach of the year douche...because ur dumbass decisions hurt us
@AngryAngelsFan he lobbed it a mile in the air back to the infield
Why do u suck at life CJ...everytime u walk someone there's  a 95% chance they'll score a run...Send his whack ass back 2 the bullpen
Can't believe we didn't pinch hit for Boesch. ..He's so garbage...Has worse plate discipline than Josh Hamilton. ..WTF
Morin has been phenominal with inherited runners...Future hall of famer
@HecSantiago53 Got rid of the bad JuJu..Now it's time to go work hermano. Don't do it for the fans/team/coach.That game is yours...do it 4 U

Well Angels fans...With ShoethewinMaker out his next start...I think it's time to give Newcomb a shot at the big show..Like or RT if u agree
@VictorRojas29 Explain it for all of us plz.Rasmus was loose and locked in.You talk to the manHes pulled pitchers in the past same way for L
May I also add that HAMILTON comes back and the Angels implode.  #BlameJHAM&amp;MIKESCOSCIA
The tone for the bullpen would ve been set and probably lights out if Rasmus pitched a scoreless 5th.Baseball God's punish dumb ass managers
I don't know about everyone else but it disgusts me that so many 1st pitch strikes down the pipe are taken every time...0-1
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza Just once I'd like to C mike Scoscia say I really messed up. I made a stupid decision as a coach. I apologize. .
Famous last fucken words...knew it would happen...Mike scoscia fucks up games
@CoryHink  Cause they didn't have to with Rasmus on the mound...Pretty simple
RT @SteveGranado: Rasmus gave up one hit in four innings, Grilli has given up three runs in 0.1 IP. #Mariners lead #Angels 3-2
When Mike Scoscia let's them play with out his so called " coaching" we win ball games...fuck you mike Scoscia sit your fat ass down shut up
There's the mike Scoscia I know and hate...pulling a perfectly good picture...who's in the zone for no fucking good reason
Please please please.....Bring Rasmus back out for the 5th coach....or I hate u
Josh should be batting 8th...Aybar has been to hood in the 6 hole not to keep him there
Nobody is happy that JHAM is back.....bad juju.....go fly a kite
Good shit Rasmus...Keep him in Coach...He's locked in...go 5...give him a W
JHAM WAISTED NO TIME...SHOWING HES BACK...DOUBLE PLAY...RALLY KILLER..
Let's go halos...The bullpen kept us in the game time to scratch out some runs...
Hector has the least amount of run support for our team...Be hard to get up on this one...Keuckel is a rough pitcher too...Staying positive
I love u 2 babe
@SteveGranado we are def going over 100...No doubter
Can I get a count...10 games in a row...they must have ran out of kyptonite...cuz superman looks unstoppable
@PujolsFive Noticed your a little more upright your last few games. Not in a good knees bent low center of gravity batting stance. Easyfix
Magic number is freaking 5...THIS IS HALOTOWN BABY
Took the fam to the drive thu, recorded the Angel game, through the 1st few innings pissed...FAST forwarded to our 1st run..Blowout followed
Long ball coming stand by!!!!!
CalBoom....RBI Single baby
Bwahahaha...Way to throw it away twinkle toes
All season every team has shifted ON Conger to pull..The Rangers just robbed him...At least he's going the other way now
Don't want this Win streak to end...But if there's one pitcher who could sink it... $ s on CJ

Finally...The 2-3-4 Power punch we expected coming into the season has arrived...Gotta move JHam to a diff spot in the order...#YOURBADJHAM
If your a Cleveland pitching coach...You should start updating your resume
Love it when a reliever is replaced by the coach. ..and the next guy in GIVES UP A HR...THATS THE UNIVERSE TELLING YA "YOUR DOING IT WRONG"
And that's how you Shut the dumb fucks up
RT @brittsyyy: Trout's reaction to being called overrated http://t.co/ZiBBdsE9hq
@brittsyyy Thats a CLOWN Yelling Bro!!!
@bmags94   At least give him the Scoscia byrd

@TonyrayJkSilva  Egh...CLINCH* Stupid ass auto correct
14 Games we vlonch...13 Games and we're at 100 Wins...FUCKING feels good to be an ANGELS fan
RT @JaneMLB: The A's have lost 11 games in the standings in less than a month. They're now SEVEN games out of first place. Unreal.
Ballgame...good job stros. ...Falling on your face again As...How's that Cespedes trade working out for ya...LMAO
@BillShaikin  Walking in a run...Death my Firing squad...lol...Glad it's them and not us
Come on Houston...Hold these Okie Dokes...Give us a 7 game lead!
What a krazy coincidence that on  Derek Jeter day...They Lose 2...yes...2...Nothing..............2
Let's do it again same way tomm with Weaver on the mound tomm!
@danieltosh The Who wore IT Best Contests  ARE Getting OUT OF control...Who's the skinny Uggo Lesbian on the right!
Boston-As- Twins...Four game smashing....SWEEEEEEEEPPPPPPS

I'll worry about football when the Angels game is over...In it till the last our baby!!!
@Alex_Curry @FoxSportsWest Collin Cowgills lost in the sun last second diving snag #AWTOP5
@valdezallen2  If he would have started and played alot more games in a defined role I'm sure his BA would look way better. Hard filling in
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza America's Top 40... Hit after hit after hit....WELL SAID GOOD SIR!
That's why Mike Trout won the heart and hustle award..Slow roller..runs it out as hard as he can even up 9.Love the respect he has 4 da game
Just let Conger come in and pitch the next inning
@TheRallyMonkey that's a lie..we all doubted. ..Scary when he's giving up alot of hits and walks early. Glad he found his groove
RT @MLBGIFs: Here you go, kid. #FarewellCaptain http://t.co/kXALvfR6lW
But then again might be prime opportunity for Scoscia to iron out the kinks on these inexperienced relievers.
@TraceyFromCali @Angels  yup..gotta rest the bullpen
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas29 Scoscia shakes up the lineup and we have a blow outgoing instead of a close 1run game. COINCIDENCE? I think not!
I think his inconsistency with playing time that really threw of CJ Crons mechanics and timing before they sent him to Triple A a month ago.
Man..We gotta keep CJ Crons power bat in the lineup at DH at the very least..Trust he starts seeing better pitches and picking his spots
In the next 5 years I bet CJ Cron wins a batting title
If CJ doesn't donk off his runs these next couple innings he might pull of a W
@troutbae @Halohnk @Angels @AngelsRBI No shit...I ain't leaving this shit in his hands...lmao
@AngryAngelsFan  We talked about this yesterday...I told ya I do the same thing..
GARYD :Stop Albert throws coming in Puljos:"Bitch put the brakes on me again, I'll beat the brakes off you next time"GaryD:Iwasjusplayingeez
@AngryAngelsFan play it off bro...play it off...lol...It's only crazy if it don't work right?
@AngryAngelsFan You sir must eat your words...throw them up then eat again
Big man can score from 1st...But not 3rd to home on a weak ground ball...My jaws on the floor
How many teams have the ANGELS swept this season...Anyone know?
Angels be like....CANT STOP...WONT QUIT...WE AINT NEVER OUT OF THIS BITCH!!!

I'm glad I'm an Angels fan.Fanatic and proud.The last 4 years every game lost drove me crazy...Glad at 86 Wins there's alot less of that
14 Games away from a solid 100 Win year...Totally possible
GIVE ME YOUR FAVORITE ANGEL PLAYER AND WHY HES SO SPECIAL TO YOU....GO!!!
Coming into the eight it was 3-5 bottom of the 9th it's 8-5 HUGE OFFENSIVE PRODUCTION WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A's just turned off da TV
Another W for Smith...He deserves it...He should have a bunch of S' s next to his statline...Hella Cluth
@haloak5  Agreed
Don't call it a comback..We had this game won...Since the 1st pitch...These twinsies just didn't know it yet

So glad we gave up JB Schuck for Boesch. ..I hated watching JB get on base and scoring runs...This Boesch guy fills that don't hit void
Joe Smith closing it down...SCIOSCIA THIS MAN DESERVES ANOTHER SHOT AT THE CLOSER ROLE
@Troutnado @AngryAngelsFan  WHY...SHE 290 AND 5'4...Your a sick man...With twisted low self esteem
What a sick backdoor slider for a K..Then gets the next batter to ground out...Hold the game Smith
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas29 Aybar and Howie have been so clutch this year...Where would the Angels be with out em#GoHalos
@Troutnado @AngryAngelsFan  Not lying true story...write that down!

RT @valdezallen2: @TonyrayJkSilva we used pretty much our whole bullpen last night though trying to get the most out of Roth
@valdezallen2  Everyone that was called in yesterday is professional enough to go back to back days. Roth is filler and it backfired
Scoscia trying to give away key  games again...SORRY ASS COACHING LIKE USUAL
Easy solution to getting Mike Trout into the 3 hole.IANETTA gets on base just as much as he does so lead off spot then Kole, Trout, Puljos
Looks like another game like yesterdays
@Markgubicza @KoleCalhoun @Erickaybar Back 2 Back Nights..The doubledutch brothers...Driving in the game winning runs

@Markgubicza  * Glove
AYBAR DESERVES A GOLD GLOBE FOR SURE THIS SEASON...IN THE WORDS OF @Markgubicza " NO QUESTION! "
Glad it wasn't puljos tagging up from 3rd...inning would be over
He's slow...perfect double play canidate...EASIEST DE IS ON TO WALKS A PLAYER EVER
Can't hit wRISP
RT @CANTHITWITHRISP: SOSH DOES KNOW THAT SMITH CAN THROW THE NINTH AS WELL RIGHT?
@CANTHITWITHRISP Nope..He forgot that Smith gave up No EARNED RUNS while he was in the closer role. Mike sticks to what's broken
I'm loading my gun...If we lose this game...IM SHOOTING MY FREAKING TV MAN...Fucken Angels are playing with my emotions!!!
I Fuck ing hate the LAW OF AVERAGES....FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKK. Stop putting Men on Street...it's gonna bite you in the ass everytime

RT @angelfanmp: Why Herrera? Why? There are literally... Literally 9 other pitchers in the bullpen that he could have brought in down 1
I guess scoscia planned on chalking this up to the loss column since the 6th inningwhy else would you bring weak relievers in to a closegame
Are these even the same guys that swept the A's in a 4 game set.
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza None of our Angel hitters look comfortable in the box man.What needs to happen to get the club clicking again?
3rd outs standing in the on deck circle...do something fuck
I hate see saw games...shit man...come shoe...
Soscia better not come out..swear...Fuck ing idiot
Sit your Fuck ing ass down mike morin...Scoscia being a premature ejaculator again...stupid ass
Albert and Hamilton need to calm the fuck down...they swing so loosely at every out of the zone pitch...Rookies do that bro...Not 200MILLION
@haloak5 @Alex_Curry hand face..
Should ve just let Efferon swing Mike...Fuck ing idiot
Boesch a shitty hitter is in the lineup tonight and J Schuck who hit .293 last season for us is playing somewhere else...WTF is that
Why..why ..why mike Scoscia do u refuse to give trout that shot in the 3 hole.bump albert to 4 and see the magic happen. Baseball nazi
Angels fan....THIS IS SPARTA!!!!
Game...set...match bitches#LTBU!!!!
@brittsyyy I call it how I see it...mcdonalds sells happy meals...but I ain't buying
Victor rojas &amp; Mark Gubizca said Trout - Puljos -Hamilton are due up....All I see is Mike Trout potentially doing anything. 2 outs to follow
Seems like everytime @HecSantiago53 is on the plate Darwins theory is in full effect. Infielders fail him this game. Should be 4-2. FML
@HecSantiago53 Bro I dont know if you watched tonight's Angels game but this Puerto Rican lefty Was beasting on the mound...Guy Gots Skillz
Finally Coach you needed to wake these bats up. Forcing them to put a ball in play should have been done 25 games ago
@HecSantiago53 @Markgubicza @VictorRojas29Took till the end of the year...But Mike Scoscia finally showed up.That's being a BL Manager there
@Markgubicza @VictorRojas29 The Halos off Is struggling.What's it gonna take for Scoscia to wake up these bats. How long til he shuffles BO
Hello twitterverse Hal-unatics...DID YOU GET YOUR RED ON #2014 WORLDSERIES
@VictorRojas29 Bedrosian is an easy fix He's swinging freely but too fast through the zone. Needs to let the ball travel and trust his hands
Turning off the TV...I can't watch this Mike Scoscia fuck up of a game
@Markgubicza  So CJ is seasoned and Bedrosian isnt...What's his excuse for not commanding the zone?
Hey Astro assholes...Role Reversals should be kept in the bedroom
I hang this L on Scoscias head. Fucked the lineup up, Didn't get to CJ fast enough, No motivation, No Fire, No will to coach. WASTES TALENT
@ChuckRichter70  ROFL...Or hand jobs to truckers at truckstops...everything explodes coming out of his hands
@Bload22333 @str8edgeracer  That's asking alot bro...
So with Boesch and Beckham in the line up we have 3 HAMILTONS who swing way out of the zone every pitch.Scoscia set this game up for failure
@str8edgeracer  WTF Is wrong with you. Your pitching like your scared. One of the best defenses and offenses behind you. PITCH LIKE IT!!!!!!
@brittsyyy POINTS!!! Texas is...You get my point though
Swept the second best team in Baseball...no prob...but that last placed team...No Fuckin idea how to play against them. KILLING ME ANGELS!
Peacock was the one who was supposed to struggle through the 1st few innings...WTF...hating this game so far
@NCAngelsfan agree there...falls behind...then is forced to serve one up the middle. He needs to go back to the bullpen
Hating on  CJ Wilson right now...Kills us...
Any theories as to WHY CJ is pitching so bad this season?

@HecSantiago53 Bro...Your stuff is great, keep it near the strike zone your gonna get the calls or swings and misses+lower your pitchcount
Fuuuuuuccck! !!! WTF...Bullshit...

Why the fuck did you pull Santiago.FUCk. .He gave up 1earned  run in 5 innings.Now we're down 2. You don't know how to coach anymore Scoscia
Take the fuck in handcuffs off mike trout already...start stealing bases fuck...hit and run. Alberts gonna do what he does no matter what
@VictorRojas29 @Markgubicza Why doesn't Scoscia put the squeeze on anymore.2Many games have been decided by a run,less than2 outs RISP, LOSS
Does anyone know math? Because if Scoscia puts the squeeze on we get a run and a man moves over to third, no squeeze and no runs...BAD MATH?

@HecSantiago53 Bro you have the second best ERA on the team and the lowest run support. You should be a 12 game winner by now.@Angels#FUBAR
RT @jake_sellinger: We got rid of Torii for Hamilton still makes me furious til this day. #TORIITOWN
@kwelch31  I've said that since day one. We had a good thing going with Hunter and they fucked him over. He had the last laugh.
RT @Domaine_G: Two pitches over the plate? Nah I'll pass... But a curveball in the dirt? Swing and a miss for the ice man!
Would rather have Cowgill then Hamilton at the plate.
Lose 2 out of 3 to the last place Red Soxs...FML
The Ol Cespedes Achilles Heel...Just cut the foot off

That's how you cap a 19th inning game on the home turf...AWESOME GAME
@thejoshhamilton God Is Good
If the Pitching rotation was set up the right way for this series the ANGELS would have swept em. You'll see at the World Series. @Angels
@petey0101  No...I can't quit yet...

The sickest part of this Angels loss is the 3 run home run that came off a blown call by the Umpire. Bullpen gave up 1 run in 6 inn. Weav6-6
@petey0101 I hear ya brah...And I know he might have been thrown out...but if the ball gets away or sails wide..chance
Rasmus struggled in the last inning...Why bring him back out. So many bad plays in this game...it destroys me when the Angels lose
Disarcina should have risked it and sent Puljos to the plate. At least we had a shot. Gosh Damn it
Gosh Damn it...We had this game won twice...Stupid Ump...Stupid Manny Machado
Closer or not..Joe Smith is still my favorite relief pitcher. @Angels @talk_angels @str8edgeracer @HecSantiago53 @RedArmyAngels @LAAngelsPR

@Angels @talk_angels @Trouty20 Rally for support for GRich.But let's get behind a man who's pitched his heart out. HSANTIAGO #DeservesAWin
@SingVinnyRamone what time...I'll try to shoot out
@SingVinnyRamone  That would be dope...Where at
@SingVinnyRamone what up Vinny...You catching some good breaks in the biz these days?
@HecSantiago53 Go out there tommorrow free and easy. You got nothing to prove. Your an amazing talent bro who can compete with the best ofem
This Angels offense is amazing....Losing 5-1....Setting the table and eating up everything there putting on the table
@Angels @Markgubicza @VictorRojas29   We give up alot of runs when the Coach or catcher doesn't take the time to settle down our pitchers.
@Angels @Markgubicza @VictorRojas29  Why doesn't the pitching staff or catcher come out and talk once they see the pitcher struggling
We have blow out games locked up and Mike Scoscia puts Relief Pitching into even sh ..itter situations...He is destroying pen confidence
This was a blow out game why does Scoscia do this to his team..
2-3-4 Hitting the Angels 1st, 2nd, 3rd HR for the Halos...Gotta love it when they're clicking on all cylinders man
@TylerTrout Sup buddy...Long time no talk to. Like 2 + years. Where's the Law Degree taking ya
Puljos 0-12 w the bases loaded. Sorry angel fans but I think it's time to pinch hit for him in the late innings in these situations
Why does the pitching coach wait so long to go talk to the pitcher. If he gives up back to back hits shouldn't that be a sign @Markgubicza
@thejoshhamilton  Hey brother...Looks like your committing to your swing before seeing the pitch. Your an amazing talent. Rootin 4 ya man.
All I want to do is find a career in MLB. My dream job is coming to the ballpark everyday and loving life under those lights and the crowd
@ErvinSantana_54  who doesn't want to be lucky when they take the mound...
Yo man... That first win is around the corner. I'll be at Angel Staidum on the 20th hopefully I'll catch an autograph from ya. Supporting ya
Great GAME TODAY man.You were pitching like an Ace through 4. Youve had some tough luck games. Hope they keep ya in the show @HecSantiago53
I remember where I was June 13th 2009. Angel Stadium drunk as a skunk watching Torii Hunter knockout 3 homeruns. Most magical baseball night
Bases loaded and I can't help but feel something amazing is about to happen
Are the baseball God's mad that we traded Frieri?
@GrillCheese49  Welcome to Angel Nation...close out some games for us and punch our ticket to the World Series
Trout nation...Blowing up
2-3-4 Putting it together for the Angels get some...That was the vision ...Now its fruition
Weav looks amqzing...keep it going JW
Fighting back the emotion..USA Always #1 in my heart no matter the outcome of any game. Fight Hard...love harder
@JoeyBats19 Mr. BATS...Your an anomaly. ..Your power is wicked insane...Good luck this year at the All Star Games
Please don't pull Shoemaker from this game...His worst inning is still better than a bullpen inning
Don't put that whack ass bullpen in the game yet Mike Scosica ....I want to see us win tonight not blow a lead
RT @EKayAngels: From @Jacob_Jaffe ... Cron is first Angel rookie to homer in all three games of a series since Salmon in 1993. #Angels
By the way...Who The Fuc&amp; is Jim Menez. ...White ass commentators
RT @Angels: And now it's @KoleCalhoun's turn. The right fielder hits the club's second home run of the inning! Make it 5-0 #Angels.
RT @Mar_e_o17: Darvish being punished on national TV, I can dig that! Angels doing good on national TV! I definitely dig that!
ANGELS NATION GOING KRAZY....GET SOME....
@ImGalifianakisZ  Or when your jokes aren't a hit until someone else steals your material and uses a stupid voice to make it hysterical
That's How I remember it as a kid...Angel Staidum before she got her boob job, tummy tuck and face lift http://t.co/1jVTlpkT93
Get me my smelling TURDS @TheDailyShow  #John stewart
LEFT center field baby...You don't know my boi Howie...Light that baby Up
Ibanez dead weight gone...Now we can win some big games...Cut loose the noose and hang that ball over the wall
So happy Ibanez is going...Cron puts us up 2-1 on a CJ Cron HR...wouldn't ha e happened if we kept the dead weight
Let's sweep these Rangers....GO HALOS # weaver4dawin
The unwavering ability to deal with endless amounts of bullshit has drawn to a close....

Angels fans are frustrated...Time to make serious changes or the post season is in serious jeopardy. RT 4 change.  #Angelsfanforchange
The Angels wouldn't have lost that game if ol Scotty DOWN WAS Still In The picture...Your killing me Arte by letting these guys ruin da team
I HATE WHEN THE LAA BLOW GAMES...SCIOSCIA NEEDLE TO BE GONE...AND SO DOES ALL THE OTHER DEAD WEIGHT LIKE IBANEZ AND FREESE...TERRIBLE GAME

Plz hold on Angels....plz...# Wtf
Ebel should know better...that foo can't pitch non save situations..@iBlogBetter
WTF. ..Dino Ebel you messed up by not pulling Frieri after he gave up 2 hits...He's notorious for blowing games in non save situations..FML
Feel the music, feel the rhyme, it's Santiago pitching time. Pitch your game, I trust in your stuff so does Angel Nation #Win@HecSantiago53
Stop watching pitches in for strikes and swing the freaking bat man@ChrisIanetta
I bleed...Not for Money, Fame or Fortune...But for those Colors that bend in the wind proclaiming freedom for its Citizens. #USA
@Trouty20 The Angels...They'll also win the Tour De France, Superbowl, Stanley Cup, French Open and Mike Tysons punchout....Called it!
Why doesn't Mark and Victor get in Scioscias ear pregame about their thoughtful ingame insights?  @VictorRojas29  @Markgubicza #HaloSocial
Why hasn't Scioscia used small ball tactics in close games? The 2,3,4 hitters should sac bunt for productive outs #HaloSocial@FoxSportsWest

Boom goes the COLLIN COWGILL Dynamite!!!!! #walkoff
If Mike Scioscia just would have went to Smith, Frieri 8-9th inning...We'd be 5 straight by now. Hector Santiago would of finally Won
@HecSantiago53 Heartbreaking man... You deserve tonight's win..Scioscia should have brought in Smith &amp; Frieri to close out your ball game
6th inning...Goose egg...Way to finish off Donaldson... You  deserve everything you worked so hard for brother...@HecSantiago53
5th inning...Goose egg..Hell of a pick off...Way to battle Back # Pitching like a boss @HecSantiago53
4th inning...Goose egg...keep hitting those outside corners my boy # pitching like a boss@HecSantiago53
3rd inning goose eggs...keep hitting those zones my boy...let's get some run support for ya now. # pitching like a boss @HecSantiago53
Why do you always suggest the team bunts to the fans...we're spectating...walk down and tell Scioscia or Dino ...might help @Markgubicza

1st inning in the books...Goose egg on the board...pitching like a boss @HecSantiago53

@Trouty20 Bunt once in awhile It'll help ya track the ball better cut down your punchouts. The simplest approach can hav the greatest effect
@Trouty20 Put that pep back in your step by bunting for a hit.Cut your strikeouts down/help ya see the ball better http://t.co/CecFXsl0GB
Mike Scioscia needs to be fired...# fire mike scioscia
Yo man...what happened to your wheels...watching you bunt for a hit was always super exciting. # simplify the approach @Trouty20
Angels lineup should be: Calhoun-Aybar-Trout-Puljos-Kendrick-Cowgill- Ianetta-Freese- DH@talk_angels
Why doesn't Mike Scioscia put a bunt on with 2 outs 2 strikes Hank Conger at the plate...Ibanaez at 3rd if the infield is a mile away
