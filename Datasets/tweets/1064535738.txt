Children &amp; parents have been separated at the border for YEARS. Happens if adult is a criminal, has a communicable disease, not the child's actual parent, &amp; other reasons. Goes back to Obama, Bush, etc. Couple dozen cases monthly. These are diff from zero tolerance separations.
"This means that in just four months the number of apprehensions is more than halfway to the 396,579 southwest border apprehensions we made in all of FY 2018." https://t.co/3kZ2IM2EcW
Border Patrol chief testifies: "Between the beginning of FY 2019 (Oct. 1, 2018) through January 31, 2019, Border Patrol apprehended 200,832 individuals along the southwest border. That is a staggering 83 percent increase compared to the same timeframe last year."

Just in! The Democrat-controlled House Oversight Committee officially subpoenaed the Trump administration Tuesday or documents related to family separations, the result of the Justice Department's "zero tolerance" policy, which was implemented in April 2018.
House Oversight Committee business meeting on whether to subpoena Trump administration on children still separated from parents seems odd considering the ACLU wrote last week in court documents that 97% of kids Judge Sabraw ordered be released from custody had been as of Feb. 13.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, says in House Oversight Committee business meeting that Chairman Elijah Cummings might be pushing to subpoena family separation info because he wants to be the first to subpoena the Trump administration.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: "I'm offended by what has happened and I'm also angry. I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago police Department. But this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve."
Chicago PD interviewed 100 individuals in the days after Jussie Smollett's hate crime claim. They also obtained video footage from near the incident - approximately 35 of our Chicago police pod cameras and 20 private sector cameras in the area.
Chicago Police Detective Comm. Edward Wodnicki: "He reported that the two offenders yelled racial and homophobic and political statements at him and beat him, put a noose around his neck and threw bleach on him and then fled from the area ... Jussie was not hurt ..."
"The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary. So he concocted a story about being attacked." https://t.co/2ejfhe92Zz
Chicago PD's Eddie Johnson: "Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language. When that didn't work Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process."
Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: "To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks. Celebrities, news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor."
Eddie Johnson of Chicago PD: "Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who is in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of this city." #metoo
Chicago Police's Eddie Johnson: "Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain &amp; anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head &amp; asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"

Trump vows victory on southern border wall: 'I will get it built' https://t.co/GLzWkWNXQD
Technically, the "proper wall" did get built for that time. Congress passed the Secure Fence Act in 2006. It allocated $1.4B for a ‚Äúfence‚Äù on 649 miles of the 2,000-mile southern border though it ended up costing $2.3B. Half the barrier was to block vehicles, half to block people

A few grains of fentanyl is enough to put a person in a coma - think about what 254 pounds of it could have done. https://t.co/WUVZGnhSoq
A few grains of fentanyl can put a person in a coma - think about what 254 pounds of it could have done. Fentanyl is up to 50 times as strong as heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, and led to more than 20,000 deaths in 2017.
The discovery was not only massive in terms of the amount of hard narcotics seized, but because of the prevented deaths it means for Americans.		"One kilogram of fentanyl contains 1 million fatal doses," Nogales Area Port Director Michael Humphries said.
One CBP official said the finding was a needle-in-a-haystack score considering 1,500 tractor trailers pass through the port daily.
NEWS FLASH: Feds make biggest-ever fentanyl bust at border, just as Congress weighs the need for wall, more security ... Truck transporting cucumbers into the country was found by @CBPArizona officers to have 254 pounds of fentanyl on board.
Pelosi suggests "normandy barrier" be used at border. When I was in Antelope Wells, NM, this month, I saw the mile and a half of this type of barrier that runs east of the port of entry. That exact barrier in AW is what THOUSANDS climbed over to get into US just since September.
