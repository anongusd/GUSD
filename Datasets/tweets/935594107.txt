The telephone town hall is wrapping up, but the conversation doesn’t end here. Remember to visit https://t.co/gyyfD1vZcJ to learn more about prediabetes, find resources, and take the prediabetes risk test. #AARPprediabetes
Not everyone can completely reverse their risk for prediabetes depending on risk factors, but most people will be able to lower their risk through physical activity and healthier eating habits, discusses Dr. McIver. #AARPprediabetes
While the risk test helps assess your risk for prediabetes, only a blood test will tell you if you have it for sure, says Dr. McIver. If you’re in the “at risk” range on the test, consult your health care provider! https://t.co/gyyfD1vZcJ #AARPprediabetes

Even though 1 in 3 American adults have prediabetes, nearly 90% don’t know they have it. https://t.co/gWckqi1Eb3 @docgriggs1 #AARPprediabetes https://t.co/TG9nacZHs6
Maintain a healthy weight, eat well, and be active. These 3 things can help lower your risk for diabetes, says Dr. Golden. https://t.co/gWckqi1Eb3 #AARPprediabetes https://t.co/zsUesgfBMJ
People of African American/Black heritage are at higher risk for developing prediabetes, discusses Dr. Golden. Some other risk factors include being overweight, lack of exercise, family history of diabetes, and being over age 40. #AARPprediabetes
1 in 4 people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes in the next 5 years, says Dr. Golden. That’s why it’s important to understand the condition and what you can do to reduce your risk! #AARPprediabetes
Prediabetes is a health condition where people have higher than normal blood sugar, but not high enough to be considered diabetes, explains Dr. Golden of @AmDiabetesAssn. Tune in: https://t.co/gWckqi1Eb3 #AARPprediabetes https://t.co/b9wZl6YSRE

Men comprise about 40 percent of all family caregivers. As @JeanAccius writes for @AARPpolicy, most men in the caregiving role are their family member’s main caregiver, and most support a parent or a spouse/partner. https://t.co/h8UnJ7FTnU

Today in @HuffPost: @AnnBrenoff talks family #caregiving and what Millennials can expect as they step into the role. Be sure to read today!	https://t.co/6ggHriyx1N
Millennial family caregivers of all races/ethnicity are employed at similar rates (roughly 3 in 4), however Hispanic/Latino Millennials in this role work more hours on average than others. https://t.co/jkBJ9HucSw https://t.co/DLwMJ0qnPC
Millennial family caregivers spend about the same as other generations on average on caregiving costs (~$6,800 per year), but have less money to do so with in the first place. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/WtcZ4TLxN3
Our colleagues in @AARPresearch found that Millennial family caregivers spend on average about 27 percent of their income on caregiving costs- a share higher than any other generation.	 https://t.co/sKFDmbSzl1
And yesterday, our CEO @JoAnn_Jenkins wrote about @AARP's caregiving leave program, and how employers can help to support working family caregivers. https://t.co/6o8AZfyigM
We in @AARPpolicy have also published on employed family caregivers. Be sure to read @FeinbergLynn’s report here: https://t.co/YTyKxIcJJW
To help employers better support working family caregivers, @AARP and @NEBGH published a toolkit with resources and promising practices. Check that out here- https://t.co/wDmgiBCnlF
Employed Millennial family caregivers also often earn low incomes. About one-third of this group earned less than $30,000 annually. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8
These negative impacts include going into work late, having to leave early, cutting back on hours and stopping work entirely. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8
A higher share of Millennial family caregivers are employed compared to Boomers and Generation X. But, Millennials often experience at least one negative impact on their work as a result of their caregiving duties.	https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/O4Z4lMmfO3

Knowing about mental health caregiving is important to understanding the Millennial caregiving experience. Millennial family caregivers are more likely than older generations to be taking care of someone with a mental health or emotional problem. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/zAj6dIE622
Our new report, along with research from @NA4Caregiving, @MentalHealthAm &amp; @NAMICommunicate, shows that mental health caregivers experience more stress and strain as a result of caregiving than other types of caregivers. https://t.co/VonpEDyweN
The Caregiver Resource Center is an important tool for family caregivers to get information and support to help with their caregiving duties. Be sure to check it out here: https://t.co/6EYQRnbtsw
As @BrendanJFlinn writes in his blog, Millennial family caregivers help challenge the “lazy Millennial” stereotype. They often perform difficult tasks, like bathing, and do so at similar rates as other caregiving generations. https://t.co/jkBJ9HucSw
Like older generations, more than half of Millennial family caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks- and most do these without help from health professionals. @AARPpolicy’s Home Alone Alliance has resources to help caregivers with these complex tasks.  https://t.co/afVkKMZ2N9
Just over a quarter of Millennial family caregivers provide “higher hour” levels of care (21+ hours/week), with multicultural Millennials the most likely to be in this role. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/y2dbEzEUSS
Who do Millennial family caregivers help support? Most (76%) care recipients are 50+, and are in large part parents and grandparents. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/3AGDcSUwdc

To help make #caregiving more manageable, @AARP developed the Prepare to Care Guide. Prepare to Care is free to download and is available in English, Spanish and Chinese, with tailored editions for LGBT and AAPI communities: https://t.co/AR97QVEthw
About 12 percent Millennial family caregivers self-identify as LGBT, and Millennials make up a larger share of LGBT family caregivers than any other generation. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/zgsvXsdghT
Men make up close to half of all Millennial family caregivers- a rate higher than preceding generations. Previous @AARPpolicy research goes deeper on male family caregivers, via @JeanAccius: https://t.co/h8UnJ7FTnU

Black Millennials make up almost one-fifth of all Millennial family caregivers, and about a third of all Black family caregivers.  https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/STChYUjpty
Hispanic/Latino Millennials make up more than a quarter of all Millennial family caregivers, and close to 40% of all Hispanic/Latino family caregivers- a share higher than any other group.  https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/Rr8ognKPmA
Millennial family caregivers are the most diverse caregiving generation. More than half represent a multicultural group- the first generation where this is the case. https://t.co/JCl190XrQ8 https://t.co/IFFvywI7A5
We published a blog on Millennial family caregivers, too! Check that out here via @BrendanJFlinn. We are going to share findings from our new report throughout the week. Today, we’re going to talk about who Millennial family caregivers are. https://t.co/jkBJ9HucSw
