@4doornomore I mean, everything‚Äôs calculated to a degree, as they can always simply not post things. You‚Äôre not wrong to be cynical.
@4doornomore bigger question is whether they buy things like AOCs insta stories on makeup, or Gillibrand's posts from her morning workouts, etc. I think that does tend to go over pretty well with casual voters. Less so with hardcore junkies, but it's not designed for them.
@4doornomore the number of folks who see these 404 pages is pretty small. It's far more of an in-joke for folks who pay way too much attention. So, no real impact either way.

Ultimately, it also would provide a nice warm contrast to Trump, which may or may not be what voters will want this cycle. Either way, I think it's at least a decisive choice, and that's really what branding is all about. 4/5
I have no inside info whatsoever, but Klobuchar's choice to go with her first name for this POTUS run is a smart brand decision, both to capitalize on her MN nice image, and respond to the current... *cough* press environment. 3/5
But I think it's gotten better in politics recently (e.g. Obama v. Hillary in 2008, but Bernie v Clinton in 2016). Certainly candidates should leverage what's best for their brand (we counseled a male candidate last week to use his first name to project warmth, for instance). 2/5
This mirrors a current discussion in political science, or at least the corner of political science twitter I follow (the elections and political psych folks). The question is whether to use titles or not, and the implications for professors who aren't men. Anyhow, I digress. 2/5
In re: "Amy for America", I used to think there was a pretty ingrained misogynistic thread in political discussions in which pundits (and all of us who follow politics) were far more likely to refer to female candidates by their first name, and males by their surname. 1/5

Not hating on TV, you need that scale (generally) and you also should do broader TV-style demographic targeting on digital for the same reasons. I just get sick of folks getting lost in the trees on digital, when the other option is TV or radio, who can't tell you much at all.
While folks worry about which specific individuals from a targeted voter list saw one digital ad, the best a TV folks can tell you is the audience for a given spot ran on a cable system, or in a broadcast market and the show's audience is maybe 60% female. https://t.co/UJAMjzTSzD

@DawgInExileNC @politicalmath And, if you want to play that game, why allow a nom by a president in any part of their first term ‚Äî they might lose!
@DawgInExileNC @politicalmath that‚Äôs still a world away from there being anything resembling precedent for ignoring garland. all the precedents SCOTUS and lower court are in favor of hearings and votes. McConnell‚Äôs move was entirely unprecedented.
@DawgInExileNC @politicalmath Taft BARELY ran, I flagged the other re-elect appointments, and Cardozo is still very much a thing. So clearly theres plenty of precedent for nominations.
@politicalmath especially considering that, as a math guy, you probably are aware of how rare false sex assault allegations are.
@politicalmath And you generally are too (your follower bots aside). Kinda surprised at your vitriol here.
@politicalmath Really? So, what is possibly shitty about comparing a the Garland sitch to delaying an appointment to investigate reasonably substantiated claims, when you're suggesting we just "ram through" a different one "without delay"? I feel I'm being reasonable here.
@DawgInExileNC @politicalmath There was also a shit ton of lower court appointees by lame ducks. if you care to use that new-fangled ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù thing. 		Or, just keep barfing up talking points. Your call.
@DawgInExileNC @politicalmath MA in poli sci, actually, and the following were true ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù appointments to SCOTUS: Cardozo, Pitney. Brennan, Murphy, Clarke, and Brandeis were appointed during a re-elect year.

@efranklinfowler As if this weren‚Äôt already complicated enough, a huge portion of that FB spend is aimed at list building and fundraising, which really shouldn‚Äôt be considered in the same way as TV spend, but there‚Äôs no real way to disaggregate it without literally asking the campaigns.

Some campaigns kind of do this intuitively -- but it is a practiced that can be managed and grown. But only if candidates and managers work at it. This effort is going to be required as polarization continues to deepen. 7/7
And that means not only hiring folks who can think this way -- but work more collaboratively than ever before. The way digital is less of its own channel these days and more of a cross-functional discipline, so too should campaign branding (or campaign UX). 6/7
Campaigns need to hire strategists who understand design, psychology, and politics more broadly -- and empower them to help ensure that every voter contact, or fundraising appeal, across all earned, owned, and paid channels creates a consistent user experience. 5/7
That's where the intentionally designing the user experience comes in -- and where TV consultants or pollsters (who traditionally control the "message" in the early part of the campaign) are ill-equipped to broaden a "message" into a campaign brand. 4/7
So, functionally, the candidates' "brand" is operationalized as "message" or "design" but the values-based thinking doesn't really expand into how we build the field program, the tv campaigns, email, or press strategy. "Brand" should extend throughout the campaign's culture. 3/7
The biggest problem is consultants and staffers tend to be in functional silos (tv, press, fundraising, digital, etc.). They may say they're think about their campaign's brand, but think it means using the right fonts, or words -- depending on their particular silo. 2/7
I've spent the last several years of my digital consulting practice focused on political candidates' branding. And I am starting to think it may be better to stop referring to "Branding" and think more about political campaigns as a user experience problem. 1/7

@A_Tall_Turner my TL;DR on 3 &amp; 4 is companies are also prone to NOT being as data-driven as you think, and the budgets need to be compared by effective cost-per-contact, which will still yield a TV-heavy mix, but more like 70/30 not 90/10.
@A_Tall_Turner I think that's the encouraging thing -- those are are more factual questions that you're actually interested in getting to the bottom of. Let's beer it up next time I'm in DC.
and to be clear, this is the correct framing of the discussion -- and productive from @A_Tall_Turner . I wish more people in control of campaign media budgets were as thoughtful. We'd all be a lot better off if that was the case.
So, @A_Tall_Turner is just plain wrong on tweets 3,4, and 9 of this thread, but worth a read, as it's considered and smart. 		We need to start applying the same hard thinking/burden of proof to our TV budgets and placements that we do to digital -- currently, it's a default. https://t.co/8hB7X4KTa4
