Marriage Equality is a matter of basic human rights. America’s same-sex families are now closer to having their unions recognized by govt.
As an early and strong proponent of Marriage Equality, I am very happy that President Obama has made this announcement.
Great news! RT @ap: BREAKING: Obama tells ABC interviewer he supports gay marriage, first president to take that position.
Minority rights should never be subject to a popular vote. Passage of #Amendment1 proves there's still much work to do. #MarriageEquality
On #TeacherAppreciation Day, I want to recognize the tireless efforts of teachers across NJ and the nation. Thank you!

One year after the killing of Osama Bin Laden, we recall heroism of US Special Forces &amp; strong leadership of our Commander in Chief.
Toll hike proposal by Port Authority is wrong &amp; undeserved. Commuters can’t afford to foot bill for yrs of mismanagement &amp; cost overruns.
One year ago, Pres Obama &amp; our troops reminded the world that there's no safety or shelter for America’s enemies.
I stand w/President Obama in fighting to keep #studentloan rates from doubling by ending tax breaks for #bigoil companies.
It is appalling that House Republicans are choosing to protect big oil over access to #education and healthcare services.
We must continue to fight for online #privacy &amp; to protect our civil liberties. No on #CISPA.
Happy Yom Ha'atzmaut to the Jewish State of Israel & all of its supporters throughout the world on the 64th anniversary of its independence!
On #Earth Day we remember importance of a healthy planet to all of us & find time to give back to the environment. http://t.co/JofvnFdv
We must stand against irresponsible big business & right-wing Repubs who seek to undermine enviro protections. #EarthDay
As large corporations continue to seek profit at cost of enviro quality, it's important to fight for clean air, water, & land. #EarthDay
We must ensure that anti-Semites never again be allowed the capabilities to carry out their evil & deranged fantasies. http://t.co/WiMjThu8
Each day we must recommit ourselves to the solemn pledge to never forget the #Holocaust. http://t.co/WiMjThu8
We can see that murderers motivated by the hatred of Jews are found in every generation. http://t.co/WiMjThu8
This day stands as a testament that America & world must never forget the horrific atrocity committed by Nazis more than six decades ago.
Our country shouldn’t be a place where my daughter receives less pay for equal work just because she’s a woman. #EqualPayDay
Despite its failure, this rocket launch is incredibly dangerous and potentially destabilizing for the entire region. #Korea
I stand strongly with South #Korea and Japan, and the broader international community, in condemning these reckless actions by North Korea.

@seffikogen Thank you for stopping by. Keep up the good work!
#GOPBudget is an absolute atrocity & continues #GOP obsession w/helping wealthiest Americans at expense of everyone else.
#GOP budget proposal is a direct assault on the Middle Class, seniors, and Medicare.

Congressman Rothman’s Statement on Today’s Attack in France http://t.co/zjZbicna
This morning’s attack outside the Ozar Hatorah, a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, was a horrific, murderous act.
We live in dangerous times &amp; protecting our country must be top priority, but targeting individuals based on their religion is un-American.
I call on Attorney General Holder to launch a full investigation into the NYPD's surveillance of NJ Muslims.
I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks from Gaza. Thoughts & prayers w/ #Israel. #IronDome saved lives, showed importance.
