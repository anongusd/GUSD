And, honestly, how convenient is it for Netanyahu to announce this 1 week before Trump is supposed to extend the Iran deal.
The average citizen pays 3k for war a year; people voted for you to get OUT OF war, to drain the fucking swamp not drench in it. Pulling out of the Iran deal based on what Netanyahu said would just hurt international diplomacy and make them more likely to get a nuke.
Iran is larger than Iraq; their military is much bigger, a war w Iran would be more disastrous than Iraq. POTUS ran on being anti interventionist, being AMERICA FIRST, yet he has surrounded himself w a bunch of war hawks just interested in being in the Middle East indefinitely.
Couple Netanyahu‚Äôs comments td with regards to the Iran deal with Mike Pompeii‚Äôs confirmation to Secretary of State, someone who has openly talked about regime change in Iran and who has never publicly acknowledged that the Iraq war is a mistake, and you‚Äôre looking at war w Iran.
