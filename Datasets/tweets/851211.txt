@EdwardSpiker I know! Also, this seems like the one time in history where Trump wildly overpaid someone.

This race is won or lost based on the votes of delegates to the Democratic state convention in Milwaukee this June 1-2. The most powerful thing you can do is become a delegate yourself. The second most powerful: recruit other delegates. Just, please, sign up so we can remind you.
If you'd like to join the party, become a delegate to the state convention, and vote to elect our ticket, wow: You're terrific! Sign up at https://t.co/iB2WfumCWN  and our terrific campaign manager, @austinjkieler, will make sure you understand all the steps.
Once you join, you'll be added automatically to your county party, &amp; you can sign up to be a delegate to the state convention (Milwaukee, June 1-2). Then, if you attend your Congressional District convention, you can lock in your state delegate slot. (It makes sense in practice.)
Are you a Wisconsinite? It's time to join the Democratic Party. A year-long @WisDems membership costs $25, or $35 for a couple. Only members in good standing (i.e. paid up) can vote in chair races—one of many benefits. Go to this page, and click "join":	https://t.co/HY9ZdWbpT9
There will be a great deal more to discuss in this race. And more than that, I'm looking forward to a ton of listening and learning. But for now, I want to ask for your help. In a democracy, nobody gets anything done alone. This race only works if people work to make it happen.
I want my kids—and everyone's kids—to have the opportunity to have the experience I had: to see that if they organize in this democracy, they can change things for the better.
Late last year, I moved—with my wife Beth and our three kids—back to Wisconsin. Friends will attest that I've been talking about it forever. It's so, so good to be home. And I'm thrilled to be working with such extraordinary people to help take our state party to the next level.
While we rallied outside in the freezing snow, Republicans inside the Capitol prepared to defy the basic tenets of democracy. They hoped we'd forget. We won't. Their reckless extremism fuels our organizing. We're building a party that will defeat them.	https://t.co/dxbOaOQWqL
But the Wisconsin GOP refused to listen to voters. They called a special session &amp; rammed through emergency legislation to strip the new governor of key powers to follow through on promises for health care. I helped sound the alarm. It wasn't enough.	https://t.co/I6UxEcwx8u
And then, in 2018, health care went from defense to offense. We fought for people who wanted to expand care instead of rip it away. Here in Wisconsin, Evers &amp; Barnes (&amp; Tammy!) ran on health care, grassroots activists worked nonstop—and together, we ended the Scott Walker era. https://t.co/Gu6cfZjGlc
For much of 2017, I spent nearly every waking hour trying to save the ACA and Medicaid, working with my spectacular @MoveOn colleagues and a relentless, inspiring coalition of allies—not least the @LittleLobbyists. I'll never forget the moment when we won.	https://t.co/p9I4OhLpxV
I've worked in progressive politics, activism, and media. I've organized against climate change &amp; war, and fought for economic, social, and racial justice. I tried to draft Warren, was a Bernie surrogate, and then helped raise millions of dollars for organizing to elect Hillary.
In college, I worked at the Center On Wisconsin Strategy (COWS, where the slogan used to be "Outstanding in their fields")—and co-founded the activist group @FightGlobalAIDS. I met my now-wife Beth putting up posters for a protest for AIDS funding.
I volunteered for Tammy Baldwin's first Congressional race. I crisscrossed the state on a gubernatorial campaign and throwing candy at county fairs. I interned for Russ Feingold. And I launched new campaigns—for a student spot on the school board, for increased school funding. https://t.co/iQHkQLpRdx
And then there's me. My political identity was forged here in Wisconsin. I learned to volunteer for campaigns when my godmother, Ada Deer, ran for Congress when I was eleven. I got hooked on progressive politics and activism, and never looked back.	https://t.co/xlmN0e9QG1
When @SnodgrassforWI ran for WI State Senate last year, she was endorsed by EMILY's List, Victory Fund, Daily Kos, Flippable, Human Rights Campaign, and President Barack Obama. She won 46.6% in a wildly gerrymandered district. Knows firsthand how county parties fuel candidacies.
Lee Snodgrass is running for 2nd Vice Chair of the @WisDems. @SnodgrassforWI is amazing. Ran a killer race for State Senate in 2018. Powerhouse county chair of @OutagamieCoDems. 24-year Appleton resident; Girl Scouts comms director; mom x2; bi; fighter.	https://t.co/SnKI6qjleu
Felesia canvassed her community so many times that, by the time she ran her own race in 2018, when she'd knock on doors, people would ask "who are we supporting this time, Felesia?"—and then they'd light up with joy when she replied, "Me!"
Felesia embodies the "respect, empower, include" ethos of the Obamas. (In fact, it was seeing Obama's 2004 convention address that turned her into a Democratic activist.) She's everyone's mentor. She's fearless. She's beloved. And she does the work like nobody you've ever met.
Running with me for First Vice Chair is the extraordinary Felesia Martin. She knows first-hand how Dems win in WI—bc she was a state (and national) co-chair for Obama's campaign in 2012. In 2018, she ran herself &amp; won a seat on the Milwaukee County Board.	https://t.co/griq2w8cR6
Taking this party to the next level requires a ton of skills, experiences, relationships, and vision.  That's why I'm so thrilled about the ticket I'm running with. Coming up in this thread: more about each of us; our plan... and how you can help.
@StarleeKine @SnodgrassforWI Yes PLEASE! Would be thrilled by your endorsement! https://t.co/iB2WfumCWN

To go on the offense vs the GOP—to organize in every square inch of the state—means empowering county parties &amp; grassroots volunteers with cutting-edge technology, training, &amp; support. And it means recognizing that counties &amp; regions vary. No size fits all. Listening is required.
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin is a statewide institution. But it is built on the county parties. The 72 county parties are laboratories of leadership. They're where the people who do the work gather &amp; coordinate. To fight &amp; win, empowering &amp; building county parties is key.
We're running not simply to defeat the GOP. We're running to build the kind of party we believe in. A party that respects the inherent dignity of every person. In the face of divide &amp; conquer, we're organizing to unite and liberate. How? The right way: Respect. Empower. Include.
The truth is, though, it's not enough to beat Trump. He's not just a disease—he's a symptom. A symptom of political sickness; of an extreme, lawless, and toxic party. The party of, here in Wisconsin, Scott Walker and Robin Vos. A party that has nothing but contempt for democracy.
Want to stop Trump? It's not enough to refresh Twitter, waiting for the Mueller report. You've got to organize. Specifically, you've got to organize in the states that'll tip the balance in 2020. And Wisconsin might be *the* hinge, swinging the whole election. The fight is here. https://t.co/end9PfedHQ

George W. Bush, an otherwise spectacularly bad president, saved millions of lives with his AIDS initiative. I couldn't loathe Trump more. But I'm thrilled that he thinks investing in fighting global AIDS is a worthwhile investment, and that it's a bipartisan applause line.
Everyone hates high drug prices. https://t.co/ZmiZJQiqWE
Attacking drug prices is always a huge winner. What Trump is leaving out is that, when he talks about other countries paying less for drugs than the US, he doesn't mention that his proposed solution is just to force other countries to pay more—not to help Americans pay less.
Gotta hand it to him: Trump's definitely creating jobs for Democratic women legislators.
There is a direct line between Trump's constant harping of misleading crime anecdotes and his systematically criminal and cruel policy family separation.
It is deeply bone-chilling that, not for the first time, the President of the United States is wielding the family members of murder victims to weaponize fear, incite hatred, and justify a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

And, of course, I'll also use the "wikler" @resistbot list (which you can join by DMing "wikler" to @resistbot) to flag moments for action nationwide as well. So even if you're not lucky enough to live in Wisconsin yet, this list is for you.
As the fight for health care unfolds, if you've texted "wikler" to 50409, I'll be able to send you alerts when there are critical moments to make calls, send messages, or attend protests. And by signing up, you'll also help beta-test this new feature.
Here in Wisconsin, @GovEvers, @TheOtherMandela, the @AssemblyDemsWI and the @WisDems State Senators are gearing up to fight to expand Medicaid. Republicans' constituents want it. Their elected officials, so far, refuse. So we're going to have to mobilize. And mobilize we will.

Even after the Foxconn promises began to unravel, the Wisconsin GOP—led by Robin Vos fought tooth and claw to protect the corporate welfare they'd overseen. The lame-duck power grab was, in no small part, a Foxconn protection plan—with Wisconsinites left out to freeze.
Scott Walker's governorship was premised on the idea that if you gave billions of taxpayer dollars to huge corporations, they'd create jobs. Foxconn was the jewel. The evaporation of the promised jobs is a metaphor for the con at the heart of GOP politics.	https://t.co/7oixoLHl7J

Two more points. First, don't JUST say you want the government reopened. Make clear that you want it reopened without strings attached. Without a wall. Without ripping up DACA. Without ending asylum protections. Just reopen the government, now, period.
The time to max out pressure on the Senate is NOW. They vote tomorrow. Flood them with calls, stop by offices, tweet and text and pull out all the stops. Millions of people will suffer if 800,000 federal workers miss another paycheck on Friday.

That list of wavering GOP senators is the reason everyone I've heard from on the Hill is shouting as loud as they can that NOW is the time to apply pressure. Literally, before you read the next tweet in this thread, call the Senate: 202-224-3121. I'm doing it now myself.
Here's the target list I've seen circulating privately: R senators who, we hear, want to reopen the govt:		Alexander	Blunt	Burr	Cassidy	Collins	Enzi	Ernst	Fischer	Gardner	Graham	Isakson	Kennedy	McSally	Murkowski	Portman	Rick Scott	Roberts	Romney	Young		...CALL: REOPEN, NO WALL
It's already clear that the GOP caucus is cracking. Last week, Rob Portman (R-OH) led an effort to build a bipartisan letter urging Trump to reopen the government, in exchange for a debate about border security afterwards. Lots &amp; lots of GOP interest. 	https://t.co/mQzcAlwyNe
(Technically, a completely clean CR wouldn't have disaster relief funding. But that's something both parties want. This CR is pretty damn clean.) https://t.co/19phniv3I6
A "clean CR" is a "clean"—meaning, no awful additional provisions attached to it—"continuing resolution," which means a resolution to continue funding the government at previous levels. It would reopen the gov until Feb 8, and provide some disaster relief. https://t.co/sVJJNjW4tl
There is, however, one bill up in the Senate that should pass on the merits—and I can't quite believe it, but I've now heard from multiple senators and staffers that it actually has a shot. It's a bill to temporarily reopen the government, no strings attached. The "clean CR."
Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on two bills. One is the bad-faith poison pill GOP bill, which would essentially destroy critical protections for immigrants—DACA and TPS—and fund the wall, in exchange for reopening the government. GOP calls it a compromise. It's not. It'll fail.

One unmistakable theme of @ViceMovie is that the damage wrought on America by the conservative movement didn't happen overnight, or in one presidential term. It's been the slow, deliberate work of decades.
Re climate politics and Vice: Read this. "An unambiguous thesis of the film is that the extreme political partisanship that exists today over climate change has its roots in the deeds of Dick Cheney." And the evidence is very strong.		https://t.co/lfMgl3DWzv
@ploop52 @vicemovie I think about that a lot too—there's a not unreasonable case to be made that the 9/11 plot could've been foiled. Team Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden; Bush systematically deprioritized counterterrorism until 9/11.
@aspiesocialwrkr Read Angler, by Barton Gellman, for a deeper dive on Cheney.
@RadioKitty @vicemovie The movie doesn’t make light of the source material. If you see it, I’d love to know how you react.
@GrahamVyse Made me literally LOL. And the credits-rolling bit! Real commitment to jokes by @GhostPanther, without any pulling of punches.

Sometimes people say “Look at Trump’s use of lies, shamelessness, and fear. Imagine how bad it could get if someone smarter and more disciplined used those techniques.” Ladies and gentlemen, meet Richard Bruce Cheney, former secret President of the United States.
One thing I appreciated in @vicemovie: the climate throughline. Reagan ripping the solar panels off the White House roof. Cheney’s energy task force. I often think the 2000 election will turn out the most significant of our lifetime, because Gore would’ve acted on climate.

@anilyn @vicemovie @Trevornoah I promise: I didn't spoil anything. It's a fleeting moment in the film that I happen to be hanging onto for dear life.
@GrahamVyse It kinda felt like an Adam Curtis movie, except made with actors rather than stock footage.
@dgentryor Bale was totally amazing.
@TheNewGenou Yeah, don't go see it if you're looking for a sunny laffs-to-despair ratio.
There are many truly terrible things that Trump has done. One thing he has not yet done is invade a country of 25 million people and cause the death of 2% of the civilian population.		https://t.co/Z9LaFPmbhQ
@ViceMovie takes you to very dark places. And then, amidst the carnage, near the end, you see Obama get sworn into office. The footage races ahead—to kids in cages, to a Trump rally—but that moment when Obama's sworn in reminds you that things aren't linear, or inevitable.
If you lived through the Bush years and were paying attention to politics, @vicemovie will take you back to the bad old days. But it'll also restore a certain sense of perspective to you about the Trump years. Things could be worse. They were, quite recently.
The story of Cheney—and particularly of the Iraq war—is so stunningly ugly that it partisans to tell it accurately. Hard to imagine it'll be told—that it's being told—properly in high school history classes. Kids, go see Vice.
There's a very strong case to be made that Trump isn't even the worst president of the 21st century. That dishonor belongs to Dick Cheney.
Just finished watching Vice. You should see it. You'll laugh more than you expected. You'll end it reeling and furious.

@NickJandl Senate can vote to expel its members at any time for any reason—but per the constitution, it takes a 2/3 vote to do it. The same number could force a vote on a spending bill and override a veto. That, too, is unlikely, but would happen first.

@jmartNYT According to MoveOn’s former Washington director, the convention should definitely be in Wisconsin.
Dems in the Senate just did the right thing, again: they blocked a bill unrelated to reopening the government. In this case, it was also a bad bill that would’ve unconstitutionally penalized free speech wrt BDS. Good on them for standing firm.

@SloGrace Today is my day. Got a row. Jackets make great blankets. Pillow is heaven.
Ultimately, likely this is happening—w the same networks that skipped Obama in 2014—because networks fear that Trump would use regulatory powers to retaliate against those who didn’t air his speech, whereas they knew Obama wouldn’t break the law to lash out vs perceived enemies. https://t.co/9gpISf5j6V

Hill reporters: consider asking GOP senators if they agree with Trump’s plan to keep the government shut down for years. 	https://t.co/FbE6BeWWbu
One last tactic suggestion: fund the eventual D Senate challengers. https://t.co/Mm6cQ6yp4q
Pelosi will hold. For the rest of us, the key is to make this the hill that the GOP Senate caucus either flees or dies on. This is the #MitchShutdown. This is the #CollinsShutdown. This is the #GardnerShutdown. And these senators are serving their final, servile terms in office.
Trump has a feral instinct for sensing points of weakness and then ripping them open. What he’s doing with the shutdown is a pure dominance play. To show he won’t be bossed by a woman. It can only be met through superior strength, or it will be repeated ad infinitum.
If you have Dems in Congress, call and thank them for standing firm. This is crucial. If Dems capitulate on wall funding now, Trump will use shutdowns for hostage-taking at every opportunity going forward. Ds know this, which is part of why they’re doing the right thing.
Another good way to reach your GOP senators to urge them to reopen the government: @resistbot. Check out https://t.co/7k3KYl18DJ for more info.
If you can’t get someone on the line in DC, call local offices. Find all their phone numbers at https://t.co/mVcLW0VjNi. https://t.co/i6i9fN7j73
If you’re furloughed and have a GOP senator, maybe use some free time to protest at your senators’ offices. Visit DC to protest them there. Make signs with your senators’ names and faces on them. Also worth doing if you’re not furloughed. Oh, and call them daily: 202-224-3121.
The only question, really, is how long Mitch is willing to let his caucus hang out to dry before he makes the call to Trump to get this thing over with. In the meantime, if you want an open government and/or don’t want a GOP Senate, it’s time to build pressure on GOP Senators.
The credible threat of a veto override from Mitch would result in Trump finding some path to reopen the government and declare victory. Because there’s nothing Trump fears more than humiliation. (Which leads him into confrontations where humiliation becomes inevitable.)
As the shutdown continues, GOP polling is going to take a nosedive. And it’s already pretty bad. But Mitch is in a bind, because if his GOP Senate overrides Trump, they’ll bleed support from their right flank as well. This is a disaster for him and his caucus.
This isn’t just a #TrumpShutdown. It’s a #MitchShutdown.
The conventional wisdom is that voters have short memories and that damage from shutdowns fades fast. But that won’t apply if this lasts for months. Nobody forgot health care repeal. This shutdown will cause more &amp; more real pain. And the public knows who’s inflicting it on them.
Tons of GOP senators are up in 2020, incl 	@SenJoniErnst @SenCoryGardner @SenatorCollins @SenThomTillis @sendavidperdue @SenMcSallyAZ—all of whom will lose if there’s a swing to D even close to as big as in 2018, giving Ds a majority even if Jones falls. &amp; @senatemajldr is up too

I’ve loved the city of DC, and all the people in it working to make it better—and the country better, and the world better. I won’t miss the cynicism and dysfunction, which are on full display tonight as the government shuts down. It’s the solstice, the longest night of the year.
Today, my family and I packed the last of our things into our car and hit the road for Madison, Wisconsin, where I grew up—and, starting tomorrow, our new home. DC waved goodbye with a rainbow. https://t.co/WYx70IMHOr

@nycsouthpaw Totally—and the other fatal problem with this tweet is that it uses the construction "quite the," which annoys me.
@epic_honey The underlying story was specifically about how the Department of Homeland Security used to have a unit monitoring right-wing extremism, which was then disbanded after right-wing media and members of Congress attacked it and the DHS secretary. Headline should've been specific.
The story itself is excellent. Hope folks listen and reflect on how the right uses strategic outrage to prevent close attention to things that might cause them trouble. See also: laws prohibiting federal $ into public health consequences of gun violence.
The fear of appearing to choose sides often results in ridiculous use of “we” in headlines and journalism. It’s a cop-out, like the passive voice. “We”—who, again? Fine if it’s the media outlet in question, or if it’s literally everyone (it never is). Otherwise, say who.
The original headline rightly sparked uproar: “The rise of right-wing extremism, and how we missed it.” Story shows how fear of right-wing criticism led DHS to stop monitoring the far right. Headline could’ve said so—but that might’ve caused RW criticism. https://t.co/dMvM6M7Hv1

It's vital to understand the Wisconsin power grab as a death rattle before the GOP loses the governorship—because even once it's complete, Scott Walker will be out, and Tony Evers will be sworn in, and things will change. Not as much as we want, but a ton. The victory is real.
@SkinMD13 Yes!
They're likely to pass something tonight. Dems shouldn't let this stop here. Along with court fights, I hope folks hold town halls in R Senate districts to expose what's in the bill. I think most of those voting for it don't remotely understand the full implications.
Precisely because I'm moving back to Wisconsin 18 days from now, I have to go back to DC tonight—there's a lot of packing to do. So, I'm about to board a plane. Will track developments in WI remotely, with gratitude to all burning the midnight oil to keep fighting this fight.

Vos is asked if this is just a partisan power grab. He responds that Rs were talking to Walker earlier this year about some of these ideas. Uh huh. What a coincidence that the push to handcuff the executive branch happens only once Ds control it. With that, press conference ends.
Robin Vos was elected with 16,775 votes. Tony Evers was elected with 1,323,545. But Vos thinks that his constituents should get to overrule the people of Wisconsin.
Journalist asks "Have you actually heard from any constituents asking for the lame-duck session?" Robin Vos says his constituents have been telling him "Don't back down. Make sure welfare recipients have to work. Keep our tax burden reasonable. Make sure the laws stay."
"In general, I think the vast majority of what's in the bills is going to stay," says Assembly Leader Robin Vos.
Absolutely jam-packed press conference by the Republicans here. So far, no indication that they’ve budged an inch on their power-grab plans. https://t.co/hPXGWJ0Edx
Rep Nygren, who chaired the Joint Finance Committee hearing yesterday, proudly declares that they decided yesterday to "more than double" allowable early voting because they decided that, instead of certain hours for two weeks, they'd permit 24/7 for two weeks. Scornful laughter.
Wisconsin GOP lawmakers says they'll start debate at 4 and hold the final votes by midnight tonight. They want to finish their power grab out of the glare of any TV news. 🚨 Wisconsinites: If you can, COME TO THE CAPITOL TONIGHT.
GOP leader Robin Vos: "We know Tony Evers will be the governor on January 7. But he is not the governor today. We are going to make sure the powers of each branch are as equal as they can be." That's what passes for their justification for the power grab.
Robin Vos, the intensely ambitious R Assembly leader, speaking now at packed press conference. Comes out swinging: this special session is "extremely important" to protect the measures Rs passed in Wisconsin over last 8 years. Cites voter ID and Medicaid work requirements.
Updates from Wisconsin: 	 - Rumors suggest GOP Senators might not have the votes for some of their power grab 	 - Already hours delayed, they're now planning votes on last-minute nominations first	 - Final passage likely late at night, to avoid scrutiny	FOLKS: COME TO THE CAPITOL

@csd It’s a jaw dropping gerrymander. Books have been written about it. Rs won 45% of votes for Assembly this year and took 63% of seats.
The bad news is that everything else sailed through the committee, only growing more extreme in the amendment process. Likely to become law tomorrow. Senate meets 11am CT; Assembly 1pm CT. And then the GOP hopes we all forget they did this ugly and brutal thing. 		We won’t.
That extreme proposal was always the easiest to explain and thus the most unpopular, if not the most damaging. It was defeated thanks to intensive organizing—particularly among county clerks, led by @samcdonell. Grateful for their work tonight.
The one sliver of good news: the most obviously, laughably bad proposal—to move the presidential primary date, at cost of $7 million, in order to rescue a far-right Supreme Court justice from having his election on a high turnout day—died in committee. Didn’t even get a vote.

After watching a ton of speakers give stirring speeches, I decided to go very practical—focusing on unintended consequences, paralysis, and backlash. Not an ideological manifesto. No idea how it landed. But, at the very least, satisfying to deliver.
I’m about to speak myself. Gulp!
To explain what’s happening: today’s hearing had two parts. In the first part, state legislators asked questions of Legislative Reference Bureau staffers and legislative lawyers. Now it’s part two, where constituents give two-minute testimonies. Folks’ve waited 7+ hours to speak.

Discussion now re GOP proposal to move WI presidential primary to March, so it's not on same date as Supreme Court election. This would cost ~$7 million and create giant headaches for county clerks. Why do it? To help elect conservative Supreme Court justice via low turnout.
More on the jazz hands situation here in this mini-thread: https://t.co/KzubloYBhu
For the GOP, this is used as a justification for rolling back early votes in cities like Milwaukee and Madison. But as @JonErpenbach immediately interjected, this is actually an argument for providing more resources to allow full early voting statewide. Room = sea of jazz hands.
Once again, a GOP lawmaker just argued that rural folks are sick &amp; tired of people voting in Milwaukee when their small-town clerks' offices aren't open. Then he caught himself and insisted it "wasn't about race," just that small communities lack resources	https://t.co/4qw1yKTcpp
RT @crooksandliars: HEY. THEY'RE WRECKING WISCONSIN WHILE NO ONE IS LOOKING. https://t.co/MGZ9hEgWzM
@analieseeicher A scenario @JonErpenbach raised: herds of private GOP lawyers, hired on public dime by R lawmakers, carrying out GOP agenda with zero public oversight or accountability. As @RepShankland put it just now: "You guys are going crazy here. It's like gremlins past midnight."
@analieseeicher These bills are so broadly drawn that nobody voting on them has any real sense of how mangled things could get if they become law. Dem state lawmakers have been asking about loopholes, and it's clear the GOP hasn't thought them through. Recipe for total chaos if passed.
I kid you not. The chair of the one hearing on the #WIpowergrab is so aggressive in policing crowd reactions that jazz hands are, for those who don’t want to get kicked out, the only remaining option. https://t.co/A5thxoytea
Meanwhile, the man chairing the hearing, Rep Nygren, angrily gavels the room to silence whenever people clap or hiss. So the fill-every-seat crowd is reduced to expressing their agreement via jazz hands.
The hearing room in the Wisconsin State Capitol is surreal. The author of the power-grab bill, which would essentially undermine the election, refused to testify. We're all only just learning what these sloppy, sweeping bills would do. And they could be voted into law *tomorrow.* https://t.co/onmEIDNhh2

The #WIpowergrab and #MIpowergrab stories still aren't breaking through to the top of the news cycle. But an array of journalists are covering them now, and that's a critical change. The GOP plan to pass these things unnoticed may be crumbling.

It's alarming that private law firms, accountable only to Republican legislative leaders instead of anyone elected statewide, could argue cases in court to supposedly represent the interests of the people of the state. It's alarming. It's wrong. – @ChrisTaylor4WI
If the #WIPowerGrab passes, the Republican state legislative leaders could, in any case involving the constitutionality of a state law, kick out the (Dem) attorney general and hire private attorneys at taxpayer expense to try the case their way.
In fact, @JonErpenbach is pointing out, under @WIpowergrab laws, the GOP state legislature could hire unlimited private lawyers to conduct work, in confidence protected by attorney-client privilege. They could even get office space in the Capitol. A secret, outsourced government.
@JonErpenbach asking a series of questions driving at a stunning point. The GOP #WIpowergrab would allow legislative leaders to hire lawyers using taxpayer funds to defend themselves vs ethics charges—&amp; sounds like scope of fees &amp; services could be exempt from open records laws.
One way to summarize the legislative impact of the #WIPowerGrab: it would extend the era of one-party Republican rule in Wisconsin, despite the fact that Republicans lost every single statewide race this November.

Another excellent point raised earlier by @JonErpenbach:	https://t.co/LMk57Ytf1C
@JonErpenbach (D) speaking now, asking if the #WIPowerGrab would result in fewer projects getting done l—in a state where road conditions are an atrocity. (See: “Scottholes,” named for Scott Walker.) Answer: “possibly, and certainly there’s less flexibility with federal funds.”
Another provision of the #WIpowergrab: restrict federal highway funds to a narrower set of state projects, so that federal prevailing wage and environmental protections don’t apply to more WI road projects. “So this is an attack on worker’s wages,” says @RepShankland https://t.co/Oq61bOWLZq
So along w everything else, the #WIpowergrab means a $60m reduction in tax revenue per year, to send money to families earning &gt;$200k.
Rep. Chris Taylor asks the legislative reference bureau what income levels would benefit from the tax cut buried in the #GOPPowerGrab bills. Answer: couples with incomes over $200k/year. Audible gasp in room.

If you're near Madison, go to the Capitol at 12:30pm today—through the afternoon, likely into the night—for the Joint Finance Committee hearing. You can get in line to give your own testimony. Let's fill the room, folks. I'll see you there. https://t.co/k1DUkoPtYC
If it's after 4:45pm, the legislative hotline is closed (thanks for that, Republicans)—but you can still call your state legislators directly. Use Or @resistbot: just text "state" to 50409 (or DM or Facebook Message "state" to @resistbot), supply your address, and boom. https://t.co/DoKb4T7OKw
If you're in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin legislative hotline is open 8:15a-4:45p at 608-266-9960. Call and tell your state Senators to OPPOSE the lame duck legislation. Reports suggest multiple R senators feel conflicted already. Light up their phone lines! https://t.co/qGVrfSUacx
If you're in Milwaukee, head to the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO at 6333 W Bluemound Rd on Mon 10/3 &amp; Tue 10/4 from 10a to 7p to join the in-person phone bank &amp; call voters in key districts. When people hear what's happening, they're outraged. Go! Go!
Want to fight the Republican power grab in Wisconsin? No matter where you are, you can call WI voters in key areas to tell them what's going on and urge them to call their state senators, 9am-10pm CT. Volunteers needed!  https://t.co/CZNCN2OCVn

By the way: not only have the NYT, WaPo, Politico, CNN, and MSNBC all failed to post a single original story about the Wisconsin GOP power grab, which could be voted into law in less than 48 hours—they've also ignored the one underway in Michigan. Hope this changes tomorrow.

Warning to our friends across the country: what happens in Wisconsin doesn't stay in Wisconsin. The GOP (and Kochs) use the state as a petri dish for terrible hard-right ideas. This effort clearly builds on the GOP power grab attempt in NC. If this works, it'll spread elsewhere.
And the way these things work in combination is chillingly cold-blooded. They gerrymander the legislature to end majority rule. They move powers from democratically elected offices to the undem legislature. They entrench by suppressing votes &amp; protecting partisan Sup Ct justices.
The same principle applies vis-a-vis ripping powers away from the Attorney General and arrogating them to the GOP legislature. Every issue becomes an opportunity for the GOP to take hostages. It's a recipe to break governance. Intentionally. It's a punch in the gut to voters.
If the WI GOP has its way, *any* adjustment to make a federal program work properly in Wisconsin becomes a hostage-taking negotiation with the hostile Republican state legislature, which will seek to extract partisan concessions. Just like how the GOP operates federally. So ugly.
As @TopherSpiro or @ASlavitt or, uh, anyone who has worked on federal or state policy can tell you, there's a constant process of seeking tweaks and adjustments for state implementations of federal laws. It's how the US makes federalism work. The WI GOP wants to take it hostage.
I can't stop thinking about the WI GOP attempt to block the governor from seeking *any* flexibility on any federal program. It's initially targeting the terrible Medicaid rules that @Tony4WI wanted to revisit. But it goes way beyond that. 	https://t.co/bkZpZssJlc
Oh, and for good measure, the WI GOP wants to block Governor Evers from being able to ban guns from the Capitol. 		https://t.co/Y8tCwaaInY https://t.co/DPnpHiqaL1
In its special session, Wisconsin's GOP aims to ram through a bill to force the new Dem governor to implement the punitive Medicaid work requirements—and to get their approval, in law, for any changes to waivers on any federal program. This is a shattering rebuke of WI's voters. https://t.co/QdJDtb5ruB
So-called Medicaid "work requirements" really amount to punitive red tape to create pretexts for withholding coverage from people. In the one state that has implemented them, Arkansas, they've been an abject disaster. Read this story—it'll make you scream:	https://t.co/ZjulJ4TyQG
One of defeated Governor Scott Walker's parting gifts to Wisconsin was getting Trump approval to force adults on Medicaid to jump through narrow administrative hoops to prove that they're working or training for jobs—on pain of ripping away coverage.	https://t.co/SaGcQaOfCT
So far, thread has covered the GOP plan to use a last-minute special legislative session to		1) suppress votes 	2) steal Supreme Court 	3) shred powers of AG. 		Here's #4: they want to force the new governor to implement Scott Walker's vicious plan to wreck Medicaid in Wisconsin.
And Daniel Kelly wrote that same-sex marriage "will eventually rob the institution of marriage of any discernible meaning."		That's the guy the GOP wants to upend Wisconsin's electoral system—and the national primary calendar—to defend. 	https://t.co/njq6rLhA9x
More on Justice Daniel Kelly: he wrote, comparing affirmative action to slavery, "Morally and as a matter of law, they are the same." https://t.co/09P4NEdnmw
Speaking of gerrymandered districts: the hard-right state Supreme Court justice the WI GOP wants to move heaven &amp; earth to protect, Daniel Kelly, was a litigator defending the GOP's maps, amidst court challenges they diminished minority voting rights.		https://t.co/pyqOMUXBQ7
What kind of case might the #GOPpowergrab affect? Try Gill v Whitford, the challege to Wisconsin's hideous legislative districts, which (long shot) could make extreme partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional nationwide. But not if GOP chooses the lawyers.		https://t.co/wHXZYsMYeO
The Wisconsin GOP's special session would allow legislators to “intervene in any litigation when a state law is challenged, and they would have the ability to appoint their own private attorneys — at taxpayer expense — to handle the case instead of the attorney general.”

In fact, the GOP would strip many of the attorney general's most critical powers, handing them instead to the heavily gerrymandered, Republican-controlled legislature, as @MollyBeck &amp; @patrickdmarley report. https://t.co/Y8tCwaaInY https://t.co/yVEJN1noWv
Third. The GOP bill would block Wisconsin's new Attorney General from fulfilling a core campaign promise: withdrawing from the GOP lawsuit to kill the Affordable Care Act &amp; end protections for pre-existing conditions. They'd force WI to stay in the suit.	https://t.co/9CVlcNmX2R https://t.co/BPO5IEf09r
Here's a list, via Dane County Clerk @samcdonell, of county clerks publicly opposing the election move. That's 60 out of 72 counties. And the other 12 aren't supporting the change. NO county election administrators are backing it. It's just an awful plan. https://t.co/WrkgTHtns6
The GOP plan to protect conservative control of WI's Supreme Court would mean three statewide elections in three months, which makes election administration an unrealistic nightmare, with key time periods overlapping. County clerks are up in arms against.	https://t.co/thvJwiDURN
To prevent progressives from defeating a far-right state Supreme Court justice on April 7, the WI GOP now has a bill to reduce turnout by moving the presidential primary race a month earlier, to March. One problem with this: it's technically "impossible." https://t.co/lkDwSAOVaJ
Second, the Wisconsin GOP wants to prevent democracy from ending 4-3 conservative control of the state Supreme Court. One far-right Justice is up for reelection on April 7 2019—which is also Super Tuesday, the presidential primary. Uh-oh. That means high turnout. So what to do?
The last time Republicans tried to restrict early voting, the great activist group @onewisconsinnow sued, and a federal judge found the rules unconstitutional. But that doesn't stop the Wisconsin GOP from trying again. It's just that important to them. 	https://t.co/jPXUTeP2Wl
So, what are Republicans trying to do in Wisconsin? It's a staggering list. First, they want to suppress votes. They'd block the new governor from changing WI's harsh voter ID law, &amp; restrict early voting two weeks—slashing from 6 weeks in some places. 	https://t.co/hGxDfDcPYV
The WI GOP power grab has national implications. By at least one analysis, WI is THE pivotal state for the 2020 elections. @prioritiesUSA crunched the numbers &amp; found that, if elections were held today, WI would be the lone true tossup state—&amp; would determine the national victor. https://t.co/eYy6SDyEUF
In Wisconsin, right now, the GOP has total control: the governorship, both chambers of the state legislature, and a majority on the Supreme Court. That's one big reason why Trump won WI in 2016—because they'd rigged the rules. Now they want to prevent Dems from unrigging them.
The #WIpowergrab is so awful that it's literally keeping me up at night. The plans have been rumored for weeks, but the WI GOP waited until Friday afternoon to unveil their stack of bills, plans ONE hearing on Monday, and votes on Tuesday. So opposition is needed *now.*
BREAKING—as in breaking democracy: a truly shocking &amp; naked power grab underway in Wisconsin. Dems won every statewide race this Nov. Now, the GOP unveiled sweeping bills to straightjacket the Gov &amp; AG, stomp on early voting, &amp; lock in power on state Sup Court. Votes THIS TUE. 1/

A friend of mine, encouraged by the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, has been working in public interest jobs for years—and is now suddenly rethinking life plans. Right now, there are 550,000 student borrowers in the program. + who knows how many who'd planned to enroll.
Out of 30,000 public service applicants, the Trump/Devos team forgave the student loans of only 96 people. That's a 99.68% rejection rate. Can you imagine deciding 10y ago to take lower salary &amp; work in public service, counting on loan forgiveness—only to get this rejection now?
Just learned about this tonight. It's shocking. In 2007, a law took effect: if you worked in public services &amp; made student loan payments on time for 10 years, you'd get loan forgiveness. In 2017, first wave of people became eligible. Guess what Trump did?	https://t.co/XgRYUVdS8j

@cubbykabi Yep! The great Avijit Michael of @Jhatkaa. He said the same thing. Told me an Indian comedian once said Trump is just Modi without the job experience.
These groups have a setup where existing orgs pay dues that help fund new ones, which then grow to become member-funded and pay it forward to the next crop. MoveOn was the first; now they’re all over. Read about the network here: https://t.co/CVA92QESaG
It’s heartening when those who oppose them know each other &amp; learn from each other as well. The trade union movement has always been internationalist. Over the last decade, the netroots has too. Patriots in their own nations, working  towards a common good that transcends nation.
In country after country, the so-called populists actually represent the narrow economic interests of a tiny elite, and the stripping of public assets to enrich a kleptocratic class. These elites know each other. They launder each other’s money. Trump’s pals around the world.
And then there are problems that I hope don’t become familiar: political violence far more widespread than the already awful level in the US. Violence is endemic here—but we’re not burying would-be voters killed during last week’s midterms.
But groups around the world face strategic questions that feel familiar. One campaigner in Europe worried that if his org fights the far right blow-for-blow, they’ll wind up with politics as polarized as ours. But alternative might be worse.
One thing I love: online grassroots groups in a dozen-plus other countries are co-developing/using a multilingual, open-source campaigning toolkit with capabilities that blow my mind. They upload databases of contact info for members of parliament for their particular country.
The US, India, Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary, Turkey, and so many other countries face rising autocracies. And so many aspiring autocrats are gunning for power across Europe and elsewhere. Last week’s US midterms were an important rebuke. The world is watching what we do here.
Had dinner tonight w/ great group of leaders of online grassroots groups from around the globe.

One thing I love about campaign victory parties: how many people, mingled in with the dressed-up folks, are wearing the sneakers they were canvassing in an hour or two earlier		(yes, including me)
Tammy's politics are the kind that I admire: principled, thoughtful, fearless. And she's one of the kindest, most genuine human beings you'll ever meet. When Trump won Wisconsin in 2016, she didn't run right. She stood her ground. And tonight, Wisconsinites thanked her for it.
Tammy Baldwin endorsed Medicare for All. She voted against Kavanaugh. She wants a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and she's right there with Elizabeth Warren pushing for worker representation on corporate boards. She's a serious progressive. And she won big.
I'm tweeting this from the @TammyBaldwin victory party. The Koch brothers network spent $15 million trying to defeat hear, with more early dark money than any other race in the country. Her victory was called within minutes of the polls closing.

@trailhen @snapdragon4561 I hope the loss email never sees the light of day. But I also know that it only strengthens us to look at the whole landscape of possibilities, light and dark and gray, and be ready for everything.
@trailhen @snapdragon4561 In 2016, I drafted MoveOn’s emails for win and loss scenarios, and didn’t think much about the loss one. My draft was so dark that I had to rewrite it in the middle of election night. This time, writing those drafts, colleagues reminded me to find the seed of hope even in loss.
@artisgoodck It matters *SO MUCH.* And then it also matters what we do after that.
@cal_perri In fairness, it's not a like-y sort of tweet. Unfortunately, there's no "resolving to keep moving forward even after glancing into the abyss" button.
@onoma071112 No despair. No giving up. Hope is deciding to press forward no matter what happens, not because success is certain, but because it's *possible.* That's where we are. Tomorrow could be glorious. It could be disastrous. Resolve to fight to the last moment—and all the ones after.
@snapdragon4561 I'm secretly optimistic. But I remember 2016 so vividly that I'm intent on reminding myself that anything could happen tomorrow. The main thing is to do everything we can—and to do it from a place of joy and abundance.
We could lose tomorrow. We could win tomorrow. Most likely it'll be a huge mix of both—tough losses and dazzling victories. So many people were shocked by 2016; this time, let nothing shock you. But remember that you have power. Use it joyfully.

And thanks to @issielapowsky for the fair and thorough write-up that captured exactly what makes this program unique and, in our view, worth betting on. 	https://t.co/uGr2lSwSZo
We're also grateful to our partners in this program: For Our Future, @iAmericaAction, @NextGenAmerica, @peoplefor, @SEIU, @IndivisibleTeam, and @PPact. Like so much of the progressive movement, especially since 2016, this has been a team effort. We're all stronger together.
But we know this: no matter what happens, we won't have that sinking feeling of regret, that we didn't do everything we could think to do. We, like millions of others across the country, are leaving it all on the field. And we're learning how to fight smarter at every step.
This is just one part of MoveOn's election program. Our volunteers have organized 1000 GOTV events, sent 30 million texts, donated $4.5 million to campaigns. And there's no telling whether all of our combined efforts will be enough tomorrow. Things could still tip either way.
This program wouldn't be possible without thousands of regular people making themselves vulnerable by recording the videos at the heart of the program. It wouldn't be possible without thousands of people chipping in. All of us at MoveOn are grateful to everyone who's powered it.
We've kept a tight lid on the program over the last 18 months because we didn't want the GOP to copy it. We didn't even send our first email fundraiser about it until mid October. But the response was overwhelming—helping us to scale it nationally.	https://t.co/sjmhTxgM5m https://t.co/GxOiiHJ2FB
All told, based on the scale of the program we're running this cycle, we calculate that Real Voter Voices will move hundreds of thousands of votes in key races to the Democratic column. That's... remarkable.
Nerdy note: Normally, the impact of tactics can't be measured until voter files are updated the spring after an election. But our methodology lets us randomize interventions at the precinct level, so we can compare margins in treatment v control precincts as soon as they report.
To put this into perspective: Conor Lamb's margin in PA-18 special election was 0.2 percentage points. (We also ran a test in that race. And we found a similar impact.)
So, how big is the Real Voter Voices program's impact? Big enough to tip close races. We ran tests in the Virginia 2017 elections &amp; Alabama's special Senate race. Per @WIRED, independent analysis found Dem margins were 0.4 percentage points higher in precincts where we ran it. https://t.co/u0qIdcsMMw
Regardless of exactly why, the most striking thing about this program: it actually *works* to move votes. (More info below.) Which is, unfortunately, a very rare thing in politics. See, for example, this huge study of 2016 tactics. Very few worked at all.	https://t.co/2HdfCkaFvL
These @MoveOn ads don't look slick. They look real. Because they are. That might help explain their impact. Or maybe it's the topics people talked about—not stuff brainstormed on a consultant's whiteboard, just actual people speaking from the heart. https://t.co/4Y0Jz5UBNH
We used Facebook's targeting technology to run the 260 ads to people matching the specific folks who found them persuasive in our tests, across 89 House races, 10 Senate races, and 10 governors' races. In all, we're reaching more than 20 million potential voters in key areas.
We used a new, rapid, low-cost, and highly accurate technique to test whether the ads moved people. Classic scientific experiment, with randomized treatment and control groups. We found 260 videos that worked as extraordinarily persuasive political ads.	https://t.co/lhpoLDhANm
This year, MoveOn turned that model on its head. We started by asking real voters in key races why they’re supporting their Democratic candidates. We collected more than 2500 authentic, unscripted videos—people talking into their phones. Watch them here: https://t.co/cOWLX4scF0
Traditional political advertising works like this: campaigns run polls to see what voters care about. They choose a message. They spend ~$10k-30k to shoot &amp; edit. If they're smart, they test them, often via dial-test or focus groups. Then they pay to put them online &amp; on TV.
NEW: Nationwide, @MoveOn was the biggest spender on political ads on Facebook last week. Today, we're pulling back the curtains on this election's "secret weapon": a groundbreaking new way to do digital ads that leapfrogs the GOP's political tech. THREAD. https://t.co/lhpoLDhANm

Becky was, and is, a jock. And she loves nature. She lives on three gorgeous acres with the kind of foliage you see in postcards.

Everything that makes you anguished, sorrowful, fearful, furious—channel all of that into resolve to turn out voters for this election. It couldn’t be more vital. And you’ve never had better tools to make a difference. Nine days left. Let’s do this.
So: friends, texts, doors, postcards, calls. Five killer ways for you to double or triple or quintuple your impact, alone from home or in groups on the streets. All of these techniques target people who might not vote, but if they do vote, will vote Dem. Time for turnout!
5. Call voters on the phone... with the ultra-powerful “hubdialer” tool!		Forget calling number after number where nobody picks up. New tools help you reach one potential Democratic voter after another, from home! @DFAaction has shifts listed right here:		https://t.co/0cbj1f8r3S

3. Knock on doors!		Still essential after all these years. You can join MoveOn members in your area to canvass in “waves” at https://t.co/fdpuYM5dn0 every weekend, or check https://t.co/FLEzTO4uPY for other ways to canvass near you. I’m about to go canvassing myself!
2. Text lots of other potential voters!		MoveOn has built a tool called Spoke that lets you text key potential voters with just a click on your trackpad, with tons of help to answer their questions. It’s addictive &amp; hyper-powerful. Join the text team: https://t.co/6YBACtDuVR
1. Recruit your friends who don’t always vote to be your “+1.” How to figure out if they don’t always vote? Voting records (whether you vote, not who you vote for) are public, so there’s an app for that! Install Outvote here: https://t.co/SZVk0zQ2JZ		https://t.co/pKLRcC3HOf

@kamkyrala @davidshor @lnsiebert @cskovron @MattGrossmann @jon_m_rob @dbroockman That... is a great and worrying point. I'd love for some smart social scientist to figure out how to measure the impact of those rallies.
@kamkyrala @3vanSutton @mattyglesias Yes, but there are Sinclair stations and local right-wing talk radio hosts around the country who make it their business to talk up the significance of local right-wing protests. And a small rainy-day protest makes for less good local right-wing TV than a big sunny one.
Great point by Evan: the persuasive impact of public protest is probably a function of the media coverage it generates. Per @mattyglesias's hack gap, there's a whole infrastructure invested in magnifying the impact of right-wing protests.  https://t.co/UBer9bxxWa

The Republican Party wants a health care system, and a government, that works for the Rick Scotts of the world, and abandons the Charlies. In the next two weeks, we get to decide if they win or lose. Don't waste a minute.
Rick Scott co-founded "the largest private for-profit health care company in the United States," which defrauded Medicare so much that it paid billions in fines—"the largest fraud settlement in American history."	https://t.co/f5lYvqkz2i
I met Charlie and her mom @woodra during the fight against ACA repeal. Charlie is alive because of Medicaid. At birth, she weighed less than two pounds. She'll forever have pre-existing conditions. But federal protections have allowed her to thrive. Fight this election for her. https://t.co/6PBqf3HYFO
Our health care system is shockingly broken in an endless list of ways. It's far from perfect in the sense that Milwaukee is far from Neptune. Not even the same planet. But there's one direction we absolutely must not go: back. That's where the GOP wants to take us. We say no.
We might not have long attention spans. We might be forgetful. We might spend too much time on our phones. But we remember danger. And the Republican Party put us in danger, by putting our health care at risk. Their 30-second ads can't erase those months—years—of memories.
Dana Rohrabacher has voted against the Affordable Care Act 57 TIMES.		57 TIMES.		Want me to show you the votes? Okay. Here they are. All 57. https://t.co/AcdxIWs96K		It began on HR 2, Jan 19, 2011. That vote would've ended protections pre-existing conditions. And it went on &amp; on.
And for Republicans who've been in Congress, it's even worse—because those clowns actually have their own voting records to contend with. Here's Dana Rohrabacher saying he's "taking on both parties and fighting for those with pre-existing conditions."	https://t.co/XuU2fUtvl3
Now Scott Walker is running a campaign that, if you'd been in a coma since 2009, might convince you that he wants to keep protections in place. But as Politifact put it, "Scott Walker says he would cover pre-existing conditions, but backs plans that would end protections"
This is a Rick Scott story. But it's the same story nationwide. I'm writing this from the house where I grew up, in Wisconsin. Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, said of a hideous ACA repeal bill: "I think it’s awesome… It’s a winner all the way around." https://t.co/mLR8uupRBJ
Every so often, over the years, Scott has paid lip service to pre-existing conditions. But his actions scream louder than his words. If he'd won, you and I would both be at risk. My asthma could prevent me from buying individual insurance coverage. I'm safer because he failed.
ACA repeal legislation finally died in the Senate. But Scott still had a way to torpedo protections for people with pre-existing conditions: his ally, Florida's Attorney General, was on the anti-ACA lawsuit. And Scott wouldn't say a bad word about it. 		https://t.co/JV5csVbbCz
(Side note: By that time, Rick Scott had written multiple op-eds in favor of repeal, including one entitled "Repealing Obamacare is only sane path." Uh huh.)	https://t.co/4cFidFBH5H
In July 2017, repeal was on the ropes in the Senate. Response? '“Floridians simply cannot afford the high taxes and mandates of Obamacare. This law needs to be repealed,” Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said in an emailed statement.'	https://t.co/PHc3RoqDtz
The House GOP's first attempt to repeal the ACA fell flat. Though it would've torched pre-existing condition protections, Scott said "The House bill was way better than Obamacare." Never give up! "I’m going to do everything I can" to get it done, he said.	https://t.co/yci6jSauEq
Trump didn't repeal the ACA on Day One. He wasn't ready. He needed help. And who was there to help him? Rick Scott. As he bragged to reporters in January 2017, "Scott said he’s talking with Donald Trump every week or two" on his anti-ACA health care bill.	https://t.co/uKIT1zJIOS
Rick Scott is a good exemplar of his party's obsession w/ ACA repeal. Even before Trump was sworn in, in Dec 2016, Scott knew what he wanted from the new president: “I want to have a repeal as quickly as we can get it done. Day one would be nice for me."	https://t.co/oFRCaj4EbB
In race after race, for House and Senate and governorships and attorneys general, Republicans are claiming they want to protect those with pre-existing conditions. But for eight years, the GOP's central message has been its hatred of Obamacare. These Republicans left footprints.
Floridians know that a single additional Republican vote in the Senate would've meant that Medicaid and the ACA—including protections for people with pre-existing conditions—would have been ripped to pieces. They know the stakes.
The problem that Nelson faces is that the Floridians who care most about health care were watching the ACA fight very, very closely. They were calling @SenBillNelson's office day after day. They know Nelson promised to protect their health care. They know he kept his promise.
Take, for example, this ad by Republican Rick Scott. One of his Senate campaign's closing arguments is that, he claims, he supports "forcing insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions"—&amp; cares even more than the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson.	https://t.co/P6xLxJ6Fv3
One of the positive side effects of the excruciating, awful, relentless months in which the sole GOP legislative goal was to end the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions is that, today, people can tell that Republicans are lying.

Non-trans people: Time to show up. Time to join—or redouble—the fight. This is when we organize in solidarity, when we remove power from those who would deny our trans sisters and brothers, when we declare, together, that trans Americans #WontBeErased. 		https://t.co/VyeNyLS844
@JesseCharlesLee The good-faith read of this is that, in Byron’s universe, “what happened” is a giant Dem/Russia/FBI conspiracy to frame Trump, which Dems will somehow stop investigating if they take power.

“My opponent wants to pay for the GOP tax cut for the wealthy and special interests by cutting Social Security and Medicare. That’s shocking. Those are earned benefits.” – @TammyBaldwin, not letting voters forget what Mitch McConnell just promised the GOP would do. https://t.co/BoOVbRQDtm
This is a killer argument for Dem Senate candidates: What their opponents would do. 		“If Leah Vukmir had been in the Senate last summer, she would’ve been the deciding vote to take people’s health care away.” – @TammyBaldwin https://t.co/0GdG1o7ers
Overall: spoke to 21 people, knocked 43 doors, possibly persuaded one voter and recruited one volunteer, reminded a lot of people where to vote. One kind soul lent me a hat, for which I’m grateful. Just returned it; now off to return my packet. Canvassing is the best.

As Judge J. Skelly Wright ruled, the White House and National Mall "constitute a unique [site] for the exercise of First Amendment rights." https://t.co/qnxsGIgAca
If Trump does something bad, you, an organizer, want to organize a public response that can show up on TV and in news article photos. That's often how they reach Trump. That's uniquely possible for protests at WH and National Mall. News outlets know to cover them, and fast.
Anti-Trump protests at golf courses, Mar-a-Lago, etc face a problem: public doesn't have right to organize on private property. Security makes it v hard to organize a protest with visually comprehensible backdrop. And, often, locations are remote.	https://t.co/wdoe3ext3S
@mattyglesias Most Trump locations (say, Mar-a-Lago) have security arrangements that make it very difficult to organize a quick protest that has the iconic target framed within the shot. That's one reason judge ruled WH "constitute[s] a unique [site] for the exercise of First Amendment rights"
@mattyglesias The logic of White House protests is a) sometimes one can see him (and often, his staff) peeping out the window and watching, and—much more importantly—WH is a very TV-friendly backdrop for protests, which Trump then watches on cable.

I've met a ton of amazing people at protests around DC over the last two years who found out about them, at zero notice, from this Twitter feed. If you're one of them, please: take a second to weigh in against these rules. If not, you should still weigh in. And spread the word.
You can read the actual proposed anti-protest rules on this page—and then post your comment opposing them. If you've never commented on a proposed federal regulation before, don't worry: it's easy and quick. Do it now!  https://t.co/kCxYhMu8Rd
The government restricted DC protest rights in 1967. The @ACLU sued, and won. Judge J. Skelly Wright wrote, "Timeliness is essential to effective dissent. Delay may stifle protest as effectively as outright censorship." Which is why Trump wants to do it. https://t.co/qnxsGIgAca
Over and over in the Trump era, we've had to mobilize rapid-response protests in the space of a few hours. Permits for those protests, under current rules, are expedited in urgent situations. Trump's proposal would end this, requiring 48 hours. In Trump era, that's a lifetime.
Since the morning after Trump's election through the present, I'm one of many people who have protested outside the White House, on the 25-foot sidewalk area where no permit is needed. Trump admin's plan? Block off 80% of it.
As the @ACLU writes, the proposed "Fee requirements could make mass protests like Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic 1963 March on Washington and its “I have a dream” speech too expensive to happen." This is what the Trump admin is proposing, right now.	https://t.co/qnxsGIgAca

@JoshuaHol Yeah, agree. As an aside: to me, the funny thing is that, as I understand it, “politically correct” started as a pejorative on the left to chide reds who took the CP line, no matter how illogical.
@JoshuaHol They didn’t define it, but I don’t think that’s the central problem. It makes sense that people hate the fear of being shamed. But they also loath speech they find offensive. “Political correctness” is shorthand for “being shamed for saying things I don’t find offensive.”

--&gt; https://t.co/eciK61MjzW
Susan Collins is basically playing the Rachel Mitchell role in the GOP's confirmation vote: drawing the attention to her to pull it away from her overwhelmingly male Senate GOP colleagues, to manage the optics.
I just realized what's actually happening here. Susan Collins, a woman (once) perceived as a moderate, is doing her party's bidding by trying to reduce the inevitable explosion of Democratic fury at Kavanaugh's confirmation that could cost the GOP their Senate majority.
You laugh, but Susan Collins actually did successfully buy the Brooklyn Bridge
well SOMEONE is lying https://t.co/EkvPjUQufc
Let me know if you have a map to the spacetime wormhole to the alternate reality where Collins was right all along and Justice Kavanaugh reaffirms Roe and the anti-choice right quits politics forever

If you're in the DC area, can't sleep, and wondering what to do, head out to the Capitol right now and look near the Senate steps on the NE corner. Or if you can't make it over there, here's the live video feed: 	https://t.co/E08O0dL4gL
Politics is unpredictable. The one thing you can control is whether you try to do something about it. And people *are* doing something—they're doing everything they can think of. Right now, for example: there's a #PeoplesFilibuster protest @ the Capitol that will go *all night.*
In the Kavanaugh fight, nobody knows for sure what's going to happen. The conventional wisdom in DC is that the GOP will have Kavanaugh confirmed by Saturday afternoon, and he'll be on the bench by Monday. But you know what? That was the conventional wisdom a week ago, too. 1/
On the one hand, there are reports about GOP senators still being undecided, and the WSJ op-ed suggests Team Kavanaugh is scrambling.		On the other hand, it's common in major votes for a few "holdouts" to make a fuss and then fall into line in final moments, adding "momentum."

Here's the underlying message of this giant thread. You have power. For the next four days, you have power. If all of us wield that power, we have a chance to win a fight with impossibly vast stakes. Don't just scroll through Twitter. Show up. Fight back. The time, folks, is now.
AND: If you know of other ways to help, please reply to this thread with them.
BTW, have I mentioned that Maine is important right now? It is SO important. Other important states: Alaska, West Virginia, Arizona, and let's throw in Nevada because Dean Heller should be held accountable. Call your friends &amp; relatives in these states, and ask them to speak up.
And while you're committing to make a difference, take a sec to sign up to volunteer during the last weekend of this election at—where else?—https://t.co/VehRs4NzGK, a joint effort by all your favorite orgs to turn out every blue vote we possibly can.

The organizing at the Capitol and around the country requires energy and sacrifice. It also costs money. Here's a fund specifically to support @CPDAction to organize with folks at the Capitol, like the women who confronted Flake in the elevator. Donate! https://t.co/xyN7PWDhAr
Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, was undeclared on Kavanaugh. Last Friday morning, he came out against. For this act of bravery, he's certain to be targeted by the right. So we've raised nearly $100k to show him we have his back. Chip in here: https://t.co/GzGeBJlLxY
The fund for Susan Collins's 2020 Democratic Senate opponent—whoever that might be—is up to $1,787,311 in pledges from 63,023 people... to be collected ONLY IF Collins votes yes on Kavanaugh. Give to it here. And spread the word. 	https://t.co/0JnSHjqHkU
Is there anything else you can do to stop Kavanaugh? Yes. There is more you can do to stop Kavanaugh. Pull out your credit card. To fight a justice who supports unlimited money in politics, time to put some money into politics. It's a stick, it's a carrot, &amp; it's organizer fuel.
FRIDAY, as on Wed &amp; Thu, there'll be 8:30/12/4 bird-dogging trainings, 10am and 5:30pm DC office walk-ins—and probably a lot more, still in development. Ditto for Saturday. If the Senate votes, you know we'll be protesting. So make a plan to get your butt to DC this weekend.
Thursday is also a national youth and student day of action, with organizing led by @PPGenAction and @genprogress. Youth &amp; students will march to Senate buildings to visit key offices. Follow them for more info. As @davidhogg111 says, the young people will win.
This THURSDAY in DC, folks gather at 12:30pm at Kavanaugh's current courthouse, 333 Constitution Ave NW, and then at 12:30, @womensmarch is leading a march to the court he wants to join—followed by rally at SCOTUS. This will be big. @lsarsour will keep you posted; follow her. https://t.co/qokxWndcx6
If you're in DC, bring some food and coffee to the folks in the People's Atrium. And each day at 10am and 5:30pm, head out with the folks from your state to visit your home-state senators' offices to register your feelings about Kavanaugh with a drop-by.
Want to get trained as a bird-dogger? It's a skill that will last you a lifetime. @UltraViolet is coordinating the thrice-daily trainings. Help them help you by signing up at advance here: https://t.co/0vIu6YPZn9 ... and follow @mcbyrne for realtime updates.
The atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building in DC has been renamed the People's Atrium. It's where folks are gathering. Bird-dogging trainings are happening daily at 8:30am, noon, and 4pm. On Tuesday, bird-doggers spoke to more than *60 senators.* Come help reach them all.
Speaking of heroes. Remember when @AdyBarkan met @JeffFlake on a plane &amp; asked him to be a hero? Remember @AnaMariaArchil2 (in a #BeAHero shirt!) &amp; @mgallagher822 talking to Flake on the elevator last week? Learn to do what they did. Trainings 3x/daily if you come to DC.
MAINERS: I know it's late to plan this. But there's a bus leaving Portland, Maine at 9pm Wednesday bound to DC to try to meet with Collins, and there's a seat for you on it. Sign up: https://t.co/73hnLjPVMN or DM @MissWrite with questions. YOU ARE MY HERO IF YOU DO THIS. Pls RT! https://t.co/qF6f6KKb7J
There's a lot you can do from whatever state you live in. But if you're within driving or flying or kayaking distance of the Capitol, I have a request: COME TO DC. There's a TON to do, led by @womensmarch &amp; @CPDAction. To plug in, sign up w this form: https://t.co/4c1XnxaVIw
You know what's even better than calling/tweeting/faxing/writing? Stopping by your senator's offices in person. This is the week to do it. Grab a friend or ten and stop by on Wed, Thu, &amp; Fri. Find local address @ https://t.co/mVcLW0VjNi. Staff are friendly! Make a plan &amp; go! https://t.co/V55Zp6zdc0
If you don't like talking on the phone, or it's tough for you to call, that doesn't mean you don't have a voice. One quick thing to do is DM @resistbot or go to https://t.co/9OVdjhEvl4 or text "resist" to 50409. It'll help you write a message &amp; send it as a fax or letter.
Senators employ staff assistants to answer the phone, check if callers are real constituents, then tally their positions. How many support Kavanaugh? How many oppose? Most offices circulate the call tallies to entire staff + senator every day. Your calls are counted. They count.
Call your senators to say no to Kavanaugh—but don't just call the switchboard. And don't give up if the line is busy or voicemail box is full. Senators have lots of offices. Find them all at https://t.co/mVcLW0VjNi. Here's Susan Collins, to take one totally random example: https://t.co/ZLokl6WPOi
Other than Wed night vigils, what can you do? First: CALL YOUR SENATORS. Call volumes are going through the roof. But unlike w health care, the other side is mobilizing too. Which means your calls are even more vital. 202-224-3121. 		https://t.co/9jpFz3Odpa
There are vigils all over the country listed at https://t.co/OzFD9VE9rx. If you're within driving distance, though, I hope you'll join me right where this fight began: on the steps of the Supreme Court. RSVP for the DC vigil here, 6pm Wed 10/3: https://t.co/OBoOnY5cjh https://t.co/HSmyirwewd
If you're in West Virginia, your voice matters now. This is the vigil to stop Kavanaugh in Charleston, West Virginia, across from Sen. Manchin's campaign headquarters. RSVP and invite your friends on Facebook here: 		https://t.co/T6IGFTKSfT
The most important Kavanaugh vigil is the one planned in Maine. Make it big enough that Susan Collins sees it in the paper. Starts at 4:30pm, at 1 Temple St in Portland. Know anyone in Maine? Go to the event's Facebook page and invite them here:		https://t.co/0oooBxI2KU
So, what can you do to stop Kavanaugh? How can you help? First, VIGILS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Nationwide. 64 so far &amp; growing fast. Find one here, or register a new one: https://t.co/OzFD9VE9rx. We'll help recruit. Let's make these powerful. Again, https://t.co/OzFD9VE9rx—pls share.
What about the FBI report? WSJ says it could end by Wed. Many potential corroborating witnesses won't be interviewed—nor Dr. Blasey Ford, nor Kavanaugh. Once background report is updated, only Senators will get to see it. Don't bet on it to end this fight.	https://t.co/ALGecxuz0d
What's next with Kavanaugh? On Wednesday, McConnell sets wheels in motion by filing for cloture. Senate rules require an intervening day before cloture vote—so that vote will be Friday. Then 30 hours of debate &amp; final confirmation vote as soon as Saturday night. Time is SHORT.
Furious about Kavanaugh? Don’t just sit there. We need your power. The truth is, there’s a LOT you can do. We may only have four days until the final vote, and your voice is needed now. This is a thread about what’s coming, and how you can help. Please follow along and share. 1/
