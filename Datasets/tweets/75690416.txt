@mattsgorman Hello friends
@mccanned @pkcapitol Thanks, Ted. Mostly, it‚Äôs just hard to see that sort of stuff as I look at packing boxes and things. We‚Äôve given everything we have over these years.
@foundation_west Totally understood. Thank you.
@pkcapitol And after a weekend in which this institution and our office hustled to get ready for today, the notion that there‚Äôs 'not much ambition‚Äô around here is a little silly.
@pkcapitol Also, I sat in a meeting this morning where several legislative items we‚Äôre trying to finish before the year is out were discussed, with policy people working at all hours to get them done.
@pkcapitol Given that Wednesday is a national day of mourning, we would not be in session that day anyway. He is being laid to rest on Thursday, with services which will include a number of members of Congress. And so forth.

@JakeSherman Oh hey btw, you guys left me off of the ‚Äòspotted‚Äô list for the Buck party. I left the boonies and put on a blazer and everything for it. Sad.
@JakeSherman Anyway, I get the joke as much as the next guy. It‚Äôs not for everyone, and there are things that make you crazy, but there‚Äôs so much joy in the job. So many stories to tell. I will miss it.
@JakeSherman And yes, geez, we name post offices. From time to time, we name them after service members killed in action. It means a great deal to those communities, and it should come with the affirmation of the Congress and the president of the United States.
@JakeSherman Also, the people. You meet the most incredible people. The Capitol Police at the South Door, the best. The Sergeant at Arms folks. Clerk‚Äôs office. And of course, all my dear friends in the press. And my colleagues, who are like family.
@JakeSherman Legislation. Much of what we do is bipartisan, and impactful. We did a big bill on trafficking this spring that is already leading to a crackdown. Opioids, I think of all the work good people did on both sides of the aisle to get that done. Members spend a lot of time on ideas.
@JakeSherman Tours.  Any chance you get to leave your bubble and show people around the world‚Äôs greatest working museum is a privilege. Also, you learn something new every time. (This is the time of year I give my unsolicited talks on the history of the Capitol Christmas Tree.)
@JakeSherman Letters. You didn‚Äôt mention we do a lot of correspondence. A slog sometimes, sure, but we often respond to young people interested in politics, who want advice. Can‚Äôt beat that.
@JakeSherman Flag requests. Incredibly enriching at times. Just the other day, I facilitated a flag and certificate for a co-worker of my wife who just became a citizen. Can‚Äôt wait to get it to him. (I‚Äôll get the certificate signed soon, honey.)
@JakeSherman Constituent meetings. Yes, we sit down and listen intently to the people we work for. 	We try to help a veteran with a disability claim. Or a family with a sick child. Or someone in recovery working to raise awareness of the opioid epidemic.
@JakeSherman Well, if they need a counterpoint to your take, here‚Äôs mine: I can think of no more rewarding a place to serve. (1 of whatever.)
@MEPFuller Well said.
@pkcapitol Just realized that today. Bummer.

It won't get much coverage compared to whatever the gossip of the day is, but it is going to make a difference. https://t.co/aryvl3dAL7
To make changes at the #VA, we need people willing to implement them. That's what this bill will do. https://t.co/aryvl3dAL7
And when it came to make reforms, one persistent problem at the #VA was a "resistance to change among employees." https://t.co/Xztcm6oJ8J
Only in Washington would zero not equal zero, but at the #VA, that's how things went. https://t.co/4CaUfCIr3d
At one point, the #VA said it couldn't actually eliminate the backlog it had been promising for years to eliminate. https://t.co/4CaUfCIr3d
Actually, wait times had gone UP.  And by no small amount. https://t.co/96FM6qhnpZ
Nearly a year after the scandal was exposed, wait times for care hadn't declined at all. https://t.co/JDzCUI9f8D
If the VA did half as good a job taking care of our veterans as it did its own bureaucrats, we'd have been fine. https://t.co/Xdbz9StSNc
Really, the problem was a sheer lack of accountability. VA execs were keeping their jobs AND their bonuses. https://t.co/OpBQXH01Fm
VA bureaucrats said the problem was funding. And Congress stepped up, providing record increases. https://t.co/gt9qxRiz61
Basically, records were being altered to hide how many people died while waiting for care. And administrators knew. https://t.co/OGBipBoMdq
In 2014, we learned about veterans  languishing--and dying--on secret wait lists at the Phoenix VA. https://t.co/OGBipBoMdq
This is a big day. After 3+ years of work, we're going to have real #VAAccountability. https://t.co/aryvl3dAL7

If defense bill is gonna be one of those tepid midnight signing statements, that's fine. I have a 4-month old. I'll probably be up!
And no, defense bill still isn't even listed on @whitehouse site. So much for #transparency? Bill # is S. 2943. https://t.co/637msW3juY
2 days to Christmas &amp; we don't know whether Pres. Obama will sign biggest troop pay raise in 6 years. Hope he does the right thing.
@jonathanweisman just glad someone's trying to track it down!
@jenfries Also rebuilds military, streamlines acquisition process, combats sexual assault. Here's the full text: https://t.co/oJa3mFoRCL
Anyway, there are 3 days to Christmas. Let's get our troops that raise. They deserve it. https://t.co/NbaCFqh5bJ
Pres. Obama complains about not enough bill signing ceremonies. We could have done one for this big troop pay raise! Low priority I guess? https://t.co/eqDNITdJq6
Why isn't troops bill listed on @WhiteHouse site? Asked Josh Earnest--who's big on transparency--for an update, but haven't heard back. https://t.co/VOvRBUUwzc
But look. No troop pay raise bill listed. Does this mean the president may NOT sign it 'in the coming days'? https://t.co/rNDPUY67Eo https://t.co/azGeS755Yh
Now the @WhiteHouse does this thing where they post on their site 'pending legislation,' bills 'the President may sign in the coming days.' https://t.co/cX6t9EDX5d
He signed a bunch of bills on Friday before leaving for Hawaii, but I guess they didn't put the troop pay raise in that stack. https://t.co/n7SlGnVOUb
Last Thursday, Congress presented Pres. Obama with a bill to provide our troops with their biggest raise in 6 years. https://t.co/NbaCFqh5bJ https://t.co/uhU3rheM6M
OK, back to this troop pay raise thing...(Sorry, I just think it's important!)

Hey @PressSec, any news on the nat'l defense bill? Is Pres. Obama gonna sign it? Biggest troop pay raise in 6 years. https://t.co/NbaCFqh5bJ
Pres. Obama always lamented not enough bill signing ceremonies. Coulda done one for biggest troop pay raise in 6 years. https://t.co/0dFo6U9bNw
.@WhiteHouse at least post the defense bill so people can review it. It's S. 2943. Biggest raise for our troops in 6 years. Merry Christmas.
Me again. 3 days to Christmas and Pres. Obama has not signed troop pay raise bill. It's not even listed on @WhiteHouse site. Low priority?

Hopefully, the @WhiteHouse, which brags about transparency, will at least note the defense bill is a thing. https://t.co/rNDPUY67Eo
The @whitehouse apparently doesn't even want you to know the troop pay raise bill *exists,* but it surely does. https://t.co/Ds1UmQNIOF
Now I was gonna screenshot this page to show you that the troop pay raise is pending. https://t.co/rNDPUY67Eo But look, it's empty: https://t.co/Hf8PGfa5rA
So the @WhiteHouse does this thing on their website where they list pending legislation "for your evaluation and comment." See: https://t.co/3Ir9HA5UP6
Update: 4 days to Christmas &amp; Pres. Obama hasn't signed the troop pay raise into law. Signed a bunch of bills before Hawaii, but not this.

Anyway, I should go back to tweeting #BetterWay stuff. Thanks for reading. If you have any Qs, just holler.
The text of that one is here: https://t.co/gq0sehOpx4
It stopped raining minutes before the ceremony started. And the speech went on as prepared. Thank you, Blessed Mother.
In fact, here he is showing Cardinal Wuerl  &amp; Pres. Garvey the weather channel app on his phone not long before the ceremony started... https://t.co/nE7ax6v6QM
But then Boehner turned his attention to whether the rain would stop before the ceremony. And I played into it big time to distract him.
One of VERY few times I kept something in he didn't want. Just too good. He got in the van that morning &amp; said, 'Ricci, you're in trouble.'
Boehner called me upstairs &amp; said he was hesitant to use it. Just too powerful. Stared out the window. "I dunno...find something else."
Now, the Gerry Faust stuff came from @OhSchnitt. Including "I've never gotten a call from the Blessed Mother, but..."
Wrote much of this on scraps of hotel memo pads during my honeymoon.
Another @SpeakerBoehner speech I'd watch is his 2011 commencement at @CatholicUniv https://t.co/Da3XlpT4AE
I'm the guy it should have bothered the most. But to me, it was a feature, not a bug.
Instead, it made us dig deeper to find the motivation behind why Boehner cared so deeply about those things.
The answer was no. But, if anything, it made us better. Anyone can write about kids or troops and use the things we always say about things.
Comment I got the most writing for Boehner was, "Do you write the tears in?" (So original, people. Truly.)
Well, there's one other thing I want to share about writing for Boehner. About his emotions and all that.
Finished the draft right before my interview w/ @SpeakerRyan, and here I am...a year and a baby boy later...
As I was working on it, got an e-mail from @BrendanBuck. Something about getting together to discuss ideas for the new speakership...
Wrote this mostly the weekend before. Went for a run that Saturday, my first since Baltimore marathon. Hadn't gotten a new job yet.
I just think thank yous at the top are lame throat-clearing. People are there, they're ready to listen, start on the second page.
Boehner was, however, sad he forgot to mention his buds: Latham, Burr, Saxby. Did thank yous in the middle, so that probably threw him off.
My deal w/ Boehner was after a speech, he would say, "It was all in the delivery, Ricci." This time was no different.
Not unusual in that Boehner was terrific. He ad-libbed at just the right moments. Always wanted to give him runway to do that.
Unusual speech in that I really left nothing on the cutting room floor. No deleted scenes. Wanted to make sure we left nothing behind.
The hill worked. And the Reagan nod worked b/c he inspired Boehner. But I didn't want to quote Reagan directly. (Just think it's overdone.)
You can kinda get a sense of the hill from Debbie Boehner at the start of the bio video: https://t.co/uWoFLFgx7T
Always knew I'd end w/ the hill Boehner's childhood home was on. Thought it was representative of his life.
And as Catholics, we're taught to wait. Lent, for example, is all about waiting for the blessings of Easter. Patience makes things real.
All the big things Boehner accomplished (earmark ban, school choice, entitlement reform) were long, slow struggles. Years of work.
"Freedom makes things possible, patience makes things real" was seen as a dig at Boehner's detractors. So off base.
We only used 100 seconds from that 45 minutes, but it was a good 100 seconds. https://t.co/JytCRmTaAY @CalebJSmith
"I'm still just me" was a nod to his first speech as Speaker, but also what I got from a 45-minute sitdown w/ him in early October.
The stuff about resigning at the top was a last-minute add. Stuff he had to say. Thankfully Boehner saved the moment w/ the box of tissues.
'Just perfect' was a nod to @TomAndrews34. That was a favorite Boehnerism of ours.
Ending with the barrage of Boehnerisms was an idea I stole from @DonSeymour.
The part about @SpeakerRyan being 'called to serve' was @ironmikesommers. (We were a very Catholic bunch.)
The Cincinnatus stuff was all @OhSchnitt. Would never have thought of that.
Only time I reprised the 'chasing the American dream' line. @michael_steel warned me in '10 it would be 'tough' for Boehner to get through..
Tomorrow is 1 year since @SpeakerBoehner's farewell address. This is first time I've watched it start to finish. https://t.co/7O9gmlfGH0
