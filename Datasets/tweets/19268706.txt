You can argue all you want that the Jussie story is vindication for Trump. That’s part of the story. But what he actually did is set a movement back. If you’re worried about race, gender, sex, trans threats...this imperils them all. That’s the important takeaway, not politics.

Trump’s inciting violence against the press is indefensible, and I say so constantly.

I get that, and it’s a conversation to have about tone. But you’re conflating the issue of inciting violence with my point, the press doing its job.

It’s intellectually very honest to be undecided. I get wrestling with it.

Thank you for your honest take, though, and thank you for your service. https://t.co/S6hOBqMbOx
Yes. An estimated hundreds, possibly thousands, of innocent people have been wrongfully executed. The state should not be in the business of even occasionally executing innocent people, let alone by the hundreds. The death penalty is morally and ethically unjust. https://t.co/Mf3dmMwsCA

Trump’s solution to the synagogue shooting - more capital punishment - is wrong. Here’s what I’ve written before: https://t.co/6xbL3f0vzn
Yes. A common argument in favor of the death penalty — and the President’s apparent argument today — is that it’s a deterrent. It is not. https://t.co/HDSVIQbORw
No, the reason to not have it is that it's ineffective, costly, unjust and often kills innocent people. https://t.co/c7vh6iuMpn
The death penalty can be applied in Pennsylvania if the victim was a law enforcement official. Having the death penalty in Pennsylvania did not stop this lunatic from committing a violent act of terror.

I’m on CNN @NewDay shortly to discuss the biggest story of the year...my take below. https://t.co/kI2uw016Ib
Absolutely, her timing should not be in question. She is brave and credible. My point is that voters will find him brave and credible too. https://t.co/uR39HESsly
No, there should be a reasonable doubt standard. As parents of sons we should demand a reasonable doubt standard. This shouldn’t be Kafka, this should be the constitution. https://t.co/yh3qHRJHSP
It’s not a job interview when he’s being accused of a crime. It’s a prosecution. Again, you can believe he’s guilty, but job interviews don’t involve this level of presumed guilt of criminal activity. https://t.co/hDayAjZgbn
Fact. Investigate. https://t.co/FzRSDusawa
This is an honest take. It’s based on Kavanaugh’s perceived politics. https://t.co/wSyeWU9GYQ
Here’s where we totally agree. Why not have all opportunities to clear or not? https://t.co/0L2f6Z28LL

It should be. And I believe her. My point  is that average Americans will side with him because they are as angry. And we shouldn’t discount that. https://t.co/GyzsxkCLmF
Hey, I disagree with you totally about his politics and integrity, but your assessment is based on actual issues. That’s refreshing. As always I love hearing your perspective, it’s honest and informed. And best of all, civil. https://t.co/M9mUbpjXvL
I applaud you for your honesty. You distrust him for his politics. The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary are pretending to distrust him for his morals. I have no issues with your stance...it’s honest,and fair. And I wish we’d talk more about that. https://t.co/GjTET1hy7h
No, don’t be coy. That’s not your issue with him. I respect you. Just be honest, you don’t like his politics. https://t.co/MVCAm4Qo0O
I respect @maddow incredibly but I watched myself and didn’t miss anything. You can disagree with my take but don’t demean me by suggesting I’m stupid, or her for suggesting disagreement is disqualifying. https://t.co/dfqnONNJXB
Respectfully, I and many average Americans I spoke to today disagree. They believe both to be credible, and both to be sympathetic. And they dont want to take the divisive position you do. They are conflicted, and that’s okay. https://t.co/FAif0d5dip
It feels like you’ve already made up your mind. I get it. But I want to hold us to a higher standard. That’s because I think victims deserve better than politicians using them. https://t.co/Sm5GSuzkIi
Well I hope I’ve served you proudly. I’ve said Ford was a credible witness and I believe her. But being sensible, I also found him credible. I think that’s how most average Americans  felt today. We can malign them, or take them seriously. I choose the latter. https://t.co/wBgRR4banR
Totally. That’s why I’ve said neither side can win this cleanly. And most importantly, the American public is the ultimate loser from this debacle. https://t.co/s6EWSBUM9W
No, they’re siding with a guy accused by uncorroborated witnesses and the media of doing awful things he denies. Again, you can believe the accusations, and many of us do. But don’t ignore how visceral the reactions will be, especially in November. https://t.co/XKDv7VmIrp
Yes. But I have to assume you mean leaders on both sides are stoking anger. https://t.co/M8S1eHKjLv
I respect you. But we all don’t agree he’s those things. We don’t need to malign her experience to find him credible, too. https://t.co/qDcbDPvmQ2
So true. They both authentically spoke to silent majorities— women who have been silenced and abused, and voters who have felt marginalized by elites. I share your fear that neither will feel appeased. https://t.co/bqkYwmeAxZ
Senators grandstanding instead of asking important questions FOR THE VICTIM when they have the opportunity is not a good look either. https://t.co/Bxue1ryYbw
No, her emotion lends just as much credibility. But truly that’s all we have. She has a poly and her memory. He has HER witnesses denying it. Their emotional testimonies were both powerful. We as a society must now decide what our standard is. And it’s not simple. https://t.co/95dvWrtGAn

This is a bad and dangerous idea, @Ocasio2018. Women in politics shouldn’t conflate sexual harassment with debate. You will be asked to answer questions as a public servant. Demanded, in fact, and from men, too. Better idea is to just come up with answers. https://t.co/A3bMTwa5hP

Great conversation to be had. And I respect you too. I’m not sure what “my way” is, though. https://t.co/OS8z9ArhDs
Speak for yourself, and every other last gasp of a dying gen, @IngrahamAngle. WE love this country’s diversity.  https://t.co/2GijMcK6vA
Now you’re just moving the goal posts. We started with you saying that Republican Senators should support Republican Presidents, out of respect. The Republican Congress largely hates these tariffs. Puts you in a pickle. https://t.co/3j8MTvwMbv
I did. It’s troubling. https://t.co/ktHgcgihnH
“Everything equal” is interesting. Typically the President’s party would support him/her. But this president has bucked his party’s platform on trade, the debt, our allies, etc. “Deference” to the President isn’t a job requirement of the legislative branch. It’s a perk. https://t.co/NlIGZv8XhF

I’m not sure what you mean, but if the argument is “they don’t care, so we shouldn’t” I’m not here for that. We should do better. https://t.co/Bnn4r46y34
Oh noooo. There’s this separation of powers thing that’s supposed to supersede that. Also, your duty to represent your constituents, not your president, regardless of party. Here’s how America works.... https://t.co/UMpXlxqbrR
Totally. Where he clearly violates those laws, prosecute him. Where he’s just a despicable human, companies are free to ban him for whatever reason they want. But if we’re declaring his horseshit hate speech, I think that is a slippery slope we should be VERY wary of. https://t.co/JVT1I1tmot
If you’d told me a year ago that anti-Trump, “libertarian,” “principled”  Rand Paul would end up being Trump’s most reliable errand boy I would have said...yep, I can kind of see it.
I think that’s mostly true, but not totally. Some on the left and right are defending the ban because it doesn’t actually violate 1A to do so. But I wish more liberals would ask some questions about the implications of that ban for other speech. https://t.co/3nXgQ9qb0n
It is. Really important points, I hope everyone reads it. I’m just dumbfounded at how he’s managed to be accepted as conservative — even by some conservatives! — when Hayek, Friedman, et al said nothing about weaponizing weather or school shooting hoaxes. He’s just a nut. https://t.co/8KRV5PoeMw

My last thought on this: I shared a studio with Larry Kudlow yesterday. I vehemently disagreed with much of what he said and said so on television. No molecule of our being should be gleeful about his health crisis right now. I can’t even believe I have to say this. We suck.
Good deflection. Google me, and I assure you’ll be appeased on that front. Now, back to Kudlow’s heart attack...any kind words? https://t.co/qpHhO4VPK7
Yes!! This. Your point??? https://t.co/wRp6fvI7UR

Love, a hotline won’t save you, that’s true. But talking to someone can. I speak from experience. And know, that whatever you have been dealing with, as awful as it is, it’s not worth the pain you’ll inflict by checking out. I promise. We need you. https://t.co/egvVRZjNHG

Thanks. I appreciate that. https://t.co/FJ7ySucQ5j
I DO understand. I’ve been there. But suicide leaves a wake you can’t know. I learned from therapy that what I thought was: “no one can help me. This is unsolvable.” But just bc you can’t see a solution doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. It does. Talk to someone. Now. 800-273-8255 https://t.co/wb97jGnwLG
And, no one ever talks about this, but sometimes it’s “and I hope they are sad when I’m gone.” Not saying that’s any of these cases, but it can be part of the self-rationalizing you go through when you try to justify killing yourself. Suicide Hotline: 800-273-8255 https://t.co/gsgPuMQsoj

I don’t think so. Many of us internalize these incidents. We think about our own trials, leaving our own children, dealing with our own issues. It shouldn’t be taboo to express all those feelings. In fact, it’s probably healthy. (Not talking about evil trolls, of course). https://t.co/UW7HfRRvYf

Val Kilmer is angry at Anthony Bourdain. That anger can feel unkind or misplaced. But as much as we shouldn’t stigmatize suicide, we also can’t dull real emotional responses to it. It’s okay to be angry that we are robbed of such an incredible light. I am. https://t.co/02xuzH54Ax
