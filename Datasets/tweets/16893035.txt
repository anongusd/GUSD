@Avis I appreciate you trying, Ashley. Sincerely. You aren't the bad guy here at all. I am just not optimistic and I no longer really have the time to wait. Thank you, again, for trying.

@Avis None of that is your fault. I appreciate you -- the social media person at Avis -- attempting to help and being polite &amp; doing whatever you were able to do. But my God in heaven has this been a bewildering, frustrating and aggravating experience. And it really didn't have to be.
@Avis I'm aware that I'm responsible for the keys being left there, and that is on me. But it is absolutely ABSURD how impossible it is to actually break through the CEMENT WALL of your customer service system to achieve a very, very simple task. Because of that, I'm basically screwed.
@Avis So all in all, this is going to cost me close to $1000 dollars, all because a very simple task was apparently impossible: a quick call to connect to a local human being, who could look in the car for me really quickly. Should have been a 15 minute project that cost me postage.
@Avis Once at the dealer, since I will need a new key fob and don't have a working one to help them program it, it is going to cost me $400+ and cause me to lose several hours of work tomorrow morning. And that will just replace my car key, I'll still be missing house key, office, etc.
@Avis No, I still have not heard. This has now taken so long that to avoid having charges pile up for me, I am forced to call a towing company to get my car out of the garage. Given that the garage has low clearance, this will cost me roughly $300 just to get it to the dealer.
@Avis I realize this isn't your fault, specifically, person who is replying to me, but still no call, and my wife finally was put through to the desk, and they hung up on her. This is getting pretty absurd. This is now 24 hours from the time I dropped the car off and still nothing.
@Avis Thank you
@Avis I'm 98% sure the keys are in that car, but if for some reason they aren't, I need to know fairly soon so that I can start the process of hauling my car out and getting it to the dealer before they close
@Avis Couple hours later and I still haven't heard back. I understand that everyone is busy and that the world doesn't revolve around me here, but I need to decide if I'm towing my car out of the garage and paying the dealer 400 bucks to get a new key fob, or if my keys are recovered.
@Avis Thank you, I appreciate that.
@Avis I want to talk to a human at Avis at Reagan National to simply locate my keys. I can't. Reach. A. Human. And my car is trapped at my local airport garage until I get my keys back, which is going to cost me a LOT of money. Can someone LOCAL there please respond?
@Avis Your customer service is a nightmare. I accidentally left my keys in my rental car when I returned it, and flew home. I filed a report through the website, called your phone tree a half dozen times and have tried desperately to get through to the DCA Avis desk. No answer.

@cgberube In my opinion, we should have GAINED followers after that exchange. Better than 99.99999999999999% of what is on Twitter today.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Any man worth his salt would say to himself, "this is disgusting and wrong, to take advantage of my friend like this... I am violating her without her permission." Imagine the filthy memories that will pop in his head when he sees Dax upon returning to his own universe.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Sisko lost the freaking Defiant, the most heavily armed and armored warship in Starfleet... and again, it was related to his basic incompetence. He also abandoned his post at DS9and lost his position, due to his incompetence. Nice hero you've got there.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander John Kennedy lost a PT-109, and he became president. George H.W. Bush was shot down in the Pacific Theater and became president. These things happen, even to the best. Maybe Picard should run for Federation president.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Oh is that why they totally abandoned him when some random poet showed up claiming to be the Prophet? Uh huh. You need better arguments, good sir.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Nice try, Frenchie: https://t.co/TetAZOksed
@cgberube @cdrsalamander The Jellico that went wimpering into Riker's quarters BEGGING him to fly a mission? The same insufferable douchebag who everyone, including Geordi -- who likes everyone -- thought was an insufferable douchebag? If that's your idea of good command skills, I see our problem here.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Picard never slept with Marta. That was the point. They both were attracted to each other, but he had too much respect for their friendship to actually do it. Q allowed him to see why that was ultimately the right decision.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Yes, I'm sure that attractive female friend of yours would think so if you went to an alternate universe and hooked up with her over there. Sounds "consensual" to me. (Hope you never get nominated to the Supreme Court thinking like that)
@cgberube @cdrsalamander More lies &amp; inconsistencies from a superficial fan. Quinn wasn't compromised when he offered the promotion. The entire episode was based on him ordering Remmick to investigate whether or not the Enterprise had been infiltrated, as he was starting to root out the conspiracy.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Picard pounded the green stuff. The green stuff that was so potent that it made Scotty flip out and start coughing. Picard didn't bat an eyelash. https://t.co/qH70LkD0uh
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Perhaps you need a re-education into the Battle of Maxia, but uh, Picard DID take him out.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander No. One. Does. Are you being purposefully obtuse?
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Not even a little bit.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Q wasn't a pre-existing human character established for 6 seasons as a totally normal guy who was then later retconned into a fucking deity. It isn't omnipotence I reject -- I was also fine with Trelane -- it is character inconsistency.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Again, like a consummate politician, you create a strawman to create a false narrative. That civilization had already died thousands of years before Picard encountered that probe. He was strong enough to live an entire life, return to his former life &amp; not go insane. Remarkable.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And here it is, ladies and gentlemen. The real reason for this argument. The self loathing anti-French sentiment from a Frenchman himself. Shame on you, Claude.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander So hiring Osama Bin Laden as your XO is cool, so long as he doesn't cheat at the poker table? Got it.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander No one is strong to stop it, Claude. No one. Sisko would've melted like butter.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander ...after being tagged, repeatedly, by Picard. Picard also banged Famke Janssen in her prime, Crusher and the like 400 year old MILF from Insurrection. Sisko is basically a rapist, having slept with Mirror Dax, allowing him to live out his fantasy without her permission.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander If Churchill was so recklessly and belligerently incompetent, and did something so stupid that the Soviets would have immediately joined the Nazis against the Allies, only to be saved by somebody acting on their own without his knowledge, than yeah... I think the same would apply
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Incorrect. At that moment in time Quinn was still Quinn, and had not been coopted by one of the aliens. It was later, in his second appearance in Conspiracy when he was compromised. And Picard sniffed it out IMMEDIATELY. That promotion was genuine.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander He ensured that competent leaders of moral righteousness and virtue were leading Starfleet in its mission to seek out new life and new civilizations. Him staying on the Enterprise prevented lunatics like Janeway from being Starfleet's first contact with hundreds of worlds.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander His ship was already lost due to the belligerent idiocy of Damon Bok's son. His maneuver prevented them from being actually destroyed and saved the lives of his crew.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You'd be a madman too if you grew up in the Reman Mines. "In those terrible depths lived only the damned. Together with the Reman slaves I was condemned to an existence of unceasing labour and starvation under the brutal heel of the Romulan guards."
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Picard was nearly hanged in The Drumhead due to his violations of the Prime Directive. Nice try. Sisko's "strategy" basically amounted to "punch a hole through there" and hope Mommy Prophet bails me out by fragging 1000+ Dominion ships in the wormhole.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander No he wasn't. He never exhibited any non-corporial characteristics. I don't care who his mother supposedly was, he was human through and through. And that plotline was perhaps the biggest Jump the Shark moment in Star Trek history.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You cited something that happened in Nemesis, which at this point has been wholesale abandoned by the powers that be in Star Trek as non-canonical. Try again.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Let's be honest, it was Wesley's mother that screwed him up. Not JLP.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Oooookay... and we never landed on the moon, and 9/11 was an inside job... got it
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Right... so loyal he tried to use a heavy gravity weapon to destroy him. Indeed, his ability to command in that moment was a lesson he learned from Picard. Doing his duty, no matter how much he might not want to.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander https://t.co/A5MIdTeem1
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You can't have it both ways, Berube. You can't call Ro -- a woman who never committed an act of violence on screen -- a terrorist, and then call Kira a freedom fighter. Your logical inconsistencies are starting to pile up.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander At least Picard was assimilated and had no control over what happened at Wolf 359. Sisko's uncontrollable incompetence was entirely his own doing. Picard never would've abandoned the station, nor would he have lost it.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You mean the log he deleted &amp; in so doing officially covered up a scandal that would've rightly ended his career and led to the decimation of the UFP?		Picard dealt with the scars of Wolf 359 his entire life. We had entire episodes devoted to his healing. And it wasn't his fault.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander I'm sorry, I think you misspelled "made his way back to the Alpha Quadrant faster, and with his ethical standards still in tact"
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Vash &gt; Jennifer &gt; Cassidy Yeates
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And you can keep ignoring Sisko's incompetence if you want, but he didn't bring them into the war... he nearly pushed them to the Dominion's side, and was unwittingly saved from that fate through no work of his own via Garek's surreptitious political assassination.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And obviously, your Star Trek knowledge is far inferior to my own, because they did IN FACT try to promote him to Admiral only 19 episodes in to SEASON 1, when Admiral Quinn offered him a promotion and the position of Commandant of Starfleet Academy.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Picard learned the lesson of Captain James T. Kirk -- "never let them take you out of that chair" -- you will recall Kirk himself telling that to Picard in Generations. You can't fault Picard for realizing that the Admiralty was corrupt and did nothing except sit behind a desk.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And along the way became a war criminal, and a rogue captain shirking even the most basic responsibilities of her Starfleet affiliation. How many times did Chakotay -- the freaking terrorist -- have to resign in protest? 6? 7?
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Does Sisko have a maneuver named after him? The supposed tactical genius? No? Bueller?
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You know why the Romulans cloned Picard? Because even in his academy days, his greatness was apparent to everyone and they knew that cloning him -- which can't in any way be deemed to be his fault -- would be lucrative. Was Sisko targeted for anything like that? Nope.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Convinced? If you want to make that case, GAREK convinced them by covering up Sisko's embarrassing, incompetent lie. If it was left up to Ben, the Romulans would've joined The Dominion, and Earth would be a dead planet right now.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And please, you're embarrassing yourself. Sisko was an incompetent captain with a volcanic temper and a God-complex who needed "Big Daddy Prophet" to show him what to do, and bail his ass out when he got in hot water.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Jesus Christ, this is like arguing with a meat headed politician. The fire at the Picard Vinyard -- which was owned and operated by Robert Picard, not JLP -- occurred while the Enterprise was on the edge of Federation space. How you can blame him for the fire is beyond me.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander It's called logic, Claude.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Yes, because if Sisko was captured and assimilated by the Borg, I'm sure he'd have had the, ahem, strength of Will to, ahem, "resist" the collective mind. Sure.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander RIKER (to Troi, same episode): What am I still doing here? Deanna, I pushed myself hard to get this far. I sacrificed a lot. I always said I wanted my own command, and yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong for me to want to stay?
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Riker's opportunities came BECAUSE of Picard. It was Riker himself who turned them down. Picard kept trying to kick him out. Indeed, Riker himself seemed bewildered at his own career rut:
@cgberube @cdrsalamander JLP: Reconsider your decision. 	WR: Are you telling me to leave, Captain? 	JLP: I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will, you're ready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And, you know, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander JLP: Will, what the hell are you still doing here? 	WR: Sir? 	JLP: You've been offered the Melbourne. 	WR: I've decided not to pursue that commission at this time. 	JLP: She's a fine ship, Will. 	WR: Yes, but she's not the Enterprise. With all due respect, sir, you need me.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Without his intervention? What twisted interpretation of reality is this? Picard virtually pushed him out, or need I remind you of Season 3's The Best of Both World's, Part 1? I see that I probably do:
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Perhaps in your world, good commanders are the ones who only take on missions that guarantee success. Some of us know better. Men like Picard take on the tough decisions because they are true leaders. Go back and hide in your fantasy world, Berube.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander You know, I expected better from a military historian. Someone like you should know that even Ike ordered men on missions that had a low probability of success. Ordered men to their deaths. Ensign Sito knew the risks &amp; the mission was planned flawlessly. It was simply dangerous.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Ah, so it is your position then that anyone who has ever made a mistake should be shunned from society and prevented from any hope of redemption. Got it. Wait, wasn't Sisko's First Officer an ACTUAL FUCKING TERRORIST?
@cgberube @cdrsalamander And again, even if that was a correct statement, it still ignores the fact that Sisko gave BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS to a KNOWN CRIMINAL and nearly destroyed the Federation's future hope of avoiding destruction ALL IN ONE EPISODE
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Lie: She was freed by Starfleet, not Picard, she was groomed and cultivated by Macias, not Picard, and there is no evidence she ever became a terrorist. At that point in ST history, the Maquis were more petty thieves and rebellious dissenters of the Cardassian policy.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Oh, and don't even get me started on Janeway, who was a war criminal and should have been locked in prison for the rest of her life when they returned to Earth.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander This, and so many other facts reveal to all right thinking people that Picard was, far and away, the superior Captain. And I say this as a man who also says that Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek series ever produced.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: And his lie didn’t even work. Once found out, he was only saved by the cold-blooded murder of a Romulan Senator by a spy/assassin that he himself commissioned. Had that not happened, the Senator would’ve revealed his treachery, and Romulus would’ve allied with The Dominion.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: And what did Sisko show us, when he was in charge? He basically started a war with the Klingons. He lost his station to the Dominion. And most heinous of all, he unethically engineered a lie to manipulate the Romulans into the war, bribing a criminal with bio-weapons!
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Picard demonstrated nothing less than remarkable command of the various skills needed to command effectively. Inspiring loyalty and superior performance from one’s crew. 3 Dimensional thinking. Restraint, coupled with force when necessary. Intelligence. Instinct. Respect.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Sisko didn’t take on the Borg like Picard did, and win. More than once. He didn’t out-think Commander Tomalak in a game of brinksmanship with the Romulans. He didn’t deftly navigate the Romulan incursion in the Klingon Civil War via tachyon net blockades.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Throughout the Dominion war — which the Enterprise E was involved in, as shown by Star Trek: Insurrection -- the Enterprise could have been (and certainly was) on the front line the whole time, scragging Dominion warships into a fine powder, and we simply never saw it.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Even then, Sisko was rarely leading fleet operations. The overall command of the fleet in most of the engagements we watched was with Starfleet flag officer Admiral William Ross, not Sisko. Sisko was more like a senior squadron commander.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Conversely, in the 7 year story arc from DS9, a full season was devoted to a war with the Klingons, and three seasons were devoted to war with The Dominion. Of course Sisko was in the middle of it, which btw was not about his greatness, but rather proximity to the wormhole.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: More importantly, the 7 year mission you witnessed on TNG occurred during a time of relative galactic peace. UFP had an alliance with the Klingons. There was a detente with the Romulans. Hadn’t met the Dominion yet. Borg were a single invasion event.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: As for the rest, it is a lie to suggest that Picard only led a fleet operation once. As the Federation Flagship during a time of war, one can only imagine how many times it happened off-screen. No one knows how many fleet operations he or Sisko led it total.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Riker, with a history of insubordination, was a risky pick by JLP. Yet he saw his larger sense of duty &amp; wanted his own opinions to be challenged. Riker justified that faith &amp; was offered command. He declined out of satisfaction w/the Enterprise. That’s to Picard’s credit.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT:  Sito Jaxa, like Ro, was a disgraced officer. Yet Picard saw something &amp; gave her a shot at redemption. The mission that killed her came from Starfleet, not Picard &amp; it showed her bravery. Had she lived, she would have clearly been an outstanding officer, vindicating Picard
@cgberube @cdrsalamander FACT: Ro Laren would have been in jail if not for Picard. Rather than dismissing her, he saw in her a spark of greatness that he fostered into an outstanding advanced tactical officer. Ro's betrayal came from her demons from the Cardassian occupation that she had to deal with.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander But since you want facts...
@cgberube @cdrsalamander That isn’t Picard’s fault — nor is it any leader’s fault — that is on the person in question, and their inability to make solid decisions. And it happens to all the greats, be they political leaders, military or business. Picard brought them further than anyone else could've.
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Picard as a cultivator of talent faced what any good leader does: the ultimate disappointment you face when you've identified talent, promoted it, invested in it, and put faith and trust in it, only to see the potential flushed down the toilet.
