La Défense africaine, qui paraît utopique pour beaucoup de sceptiques, doit plus que jamais faire l’œuvre d’une réflexion politique approfondie de l’élite africaine.
Nos armées se doivent d’être complètement toilettées quand a leur objectif (qui doit cesser d’avoir des connotations uniquement militaires pour être des armées d’utilités civiles impliquées directement dans le développement national).
La vision stratégique de nos armées doit, plus que jamais, être une limitation drastique de la présence des forces militaires étrangères dans le Sahel (présence qui alimente l’idéologie islamiste).
La réussite de l’approche non militaire dépendra de la présence (unilatéralement, bilatéralement ou multilatérale) militaire des différentes États concernés.		Une présence militaire qui peut et doit se faire en osmose avec les communautés protagonistes.
Il est plus que évident que les solutions vont au delà des réponses militaires. Mais a ne pas s’y méprendre, la part militaire des solutions est au moins 50% de toute la panoplie.
Depuis 2011 les violences intercommunautaires aux relents ethniques ont augmentées de plus de 70% dans les pays du Sahel.		Le phénomène touche presque tous les pays composants ladite zone.
