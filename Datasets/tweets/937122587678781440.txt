@SenBlumenthal You know what pisses me off, looking at a p.o.s. stolen valor s.o.b. in the halls of government
@AOC @RashidaTlaib That dumb b!tch got scorched by Ms Patton, try and keep up
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP 1) The Earth's climate has been in a constant state of change since it was formed 2) see answer one 3) Which nation leads the world in carbon emission reduction? Who are the leaders in pollution? Why aren't you talking to them if you honestly believe in your point?
@KamalaHarris @JoeCunninghamSC @ClyburnSC06 You wouldn't know common sense if you were banging it to get ahead in life
@PattyMurray @EPA Can you find me any nominee in history that didn't back the person that nominated them? Anyone at all, at any point in history? Another question for you, what nation leads the world in carbon emission reduction over the last two years?
@MarkWarner There's a lot of dead people in Syria who would disagree with you
@AOC It's not your dancing they're referring to you f@cking idiot
@RashidaTlaib if they were Jewish, would you cry?
@IlhanMN You know how I know you're a f@cking moron, because you saw a headline about past tax rates but failed to actually do the research on if anyone actually paid it. Here's another tip, you could tax the entire world at 100% and it wouldn't pay for what you and your ilk want
@RashidaTlaib You looked like an absolute clown, but don't worry, you weren't the only one. The best part was that Patton ate your freaking lunch for your ignorant statements, but you're just another racist anti-Semite Demorat
@RashidaTlaib @lucymcbath @MomsDemand @AMarch4OurLives The only thing you proved is that you don't know what common sense is
@SenBlumenthal You must have been watching something completely different than the rest of the nation. The only thing proved yesterday was that the @DNC is ran by mental midgets these days, but we already knew that
@IlhanMN You tried to pin the actions of foreign soldiers on what he did, not exactly the same thing you anti-Semitic douche
@RashidaTlaib Shocker, a company wants to make sure you can pay the bill before handing over the product.....
@KamalaHarris So they were supposed to just let her run around without medical help?
@IlhanMN @Apple @Google Be sure and speak this message to every mosque in the US too
@SenBlumenthal Can't be unconstitutional if you idiots gave him the power to do it
@PattyMurray You are an absolutely disgusting human being
@KamalaHarris How's that middle class in Oakland working out under policies?
@SenBlumenthal You idiots gave him the power to do so in 1976. I find it hilarious watching a socialist get mad at power they often vote to give the Executive Branch.
@KamalaHarris You often criticize the President for not listening to his experts, but now you vote against what the experts at the border are saying, including the holdovers from the Obama administration? Are you incapable of handling more than one issue at a time?
@PattyMurray You voted to not give babies born that survived an abortion attempt medical care you sick f@ck
@SenBlumenthal It's a waste of time because you morons gave that power to the President in 1976.....
@RepAOC That's hilarious coming from somebody who just posted a video of her discussing the morality of not having kids who belongs to party that just voted against giving babies who survive an abortion attempt medical care after birth......
@LisPower1 @AOC Because the dumb b!tch didn't post a video of her discussing if it's morally correct to have children........?
@SenBlumenthal How the fuck is a born baby still a woman's choice you sick f@ck!
@44amazingrace @cosper_nicole @TheDemocrats lmao, how to say "I have no idea how taxes work" in a tweet
@jhjet74 @PuzzledMule @TheDemocrats How to say "I only read the headlines about tax cuts" in a tweet
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog LMAO, it's going to be your talking point, but you're going to ignore all the precedent and laws passed by Congress allowing him to do it.
@RepJayapal Why do you think we didn't vote you socialists in?
@SenSanders LMAO, read what you just said again, slowly this time Mr. Socialist
@SenGillibrand Uh, how exactly would it have fixed that exactly? Can you be specific for once in your pathetic life
@RepAdamSchiff You wouldn't know an actual assault weapon if it was shoved up your @ss
@KamalaHarris You are a waste of tax payer money......and air
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He's saying he didn't need to do it if you had just listened to the experts at the border, but instead you dismissed them and turned it into a political issue.  Quick question, you said the wall was immoral, but you funded over a billion dollars towards it?
@PattyMurray You are the face of true evil
@KamalaHarris Yeah, f@ck all those kids in sex slavery, lets concentrate on something we can't change!
@PattyMurray Well I guess Congress shouldn't have given the President the power to do so then. What I find really strange about all of this are a bunch of socialists crying about a "power grab". That's right up your alley dumb@ss
@nowthisnews How dumb are you people? As dumb as @IlhanMN is anti-Semitic. How is he going to answer for foreign troops? No US military member was appart of it. The only connection is the training, which last time I checked, didn't include rape and pillage, but w/e pushes your narrative right
@ScottJW LMAO, President Warren, LOL President Harris.....omg you're going to make me pee!!!
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @MSNBC You want to know why journalism is dead, it's because you stopped speaking in specifics and started using your own interpretation and generalized data points
@KamalaHarris So did you start banging white dudes before or after you banged your way to the top?
@SenKamalaHarris lol, your bills will fail, and the President will continue to do his duty that he is required to do under the authorization of the Constitution.
@SenBlumenthal It seems you need a reminder on why McCabe was fired. Here's a hint, it's for lying.....
@AOC LMAO, way to cost your region 25K jobs and $3B in taxes (slow clap) You are the poster child of socialist policy reality
@KamalaHarris That's probably because nothing you have produced would have prevented it from happening.......
@PattyMurray Did you sacrifice a baby and bathe in it's blood before going?
@PattyMurray You are not what the people of WA deserve to represent them you rancid p.o.s
@justicedems @AOC Another step towards total government take over. You idiots are putting the chains of slavery on your own necks and you don't even know it.
@MuslimIQ @IlhanMN criticizing a rancid p.o.s. over their anti-Semitic and terrorist sympathizing rhetoric, is not criticizing their skin color.....
@CBSNews Then I suggest you move out of high tax states like CA, NY, NJ, and IL. Then don't vote for the policies that broke you all over again in your new state.
@cspan @IlhanMN That's f@cking hilarious coming from a rancid p.o.s. terrorist sympathizer......
@SenateDems @SenBlumenthal That's f@cking hilarious coming from the people who keep putting child sex trafficking, illegal aliens, and drugs that kill 70k Americans a year first, all over semantic words for "wall" or "fence"
@PattyMurray That's odd, because we're asking you to put aside your petty pride and politics to protect the American people. You know, the people you were elected to represent......
@SenGillibrand I'd rather stand with Satan herself (@PattyMurray)
@Jilchrest How many socialists/communists now occupy this country? Triple that, that's how much ammo I would be comfortable with.
@Jilchrest Or maybe they just don't want you to kill a human baby that can feel pain.........? Trump never said ban all abortion, he said after 20 weeks, which would be the medically founded fact of when pain experience starts.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump What's sad is that there are people like you, in positions of power, who have no idea what "innocent until proven guilty" and "due process" means.  Your pride will be your downfall, always is to the mob
@kenolin1 @AOC lmao, is that why her "New Green Deal" has been taken down before it was even up for 24 hours. It wasn't just the right calling her a fucking moron either bud.
@Ilhan You sure you can't think of a difference.........maybe one that would involve the legality of it all maybe......no? nothing? hmmmmmm
@CNNPolitics Pretty sure your doctor tells you to cut down on the stress in your life, but you constantly push the rhetoric of "this is Armageddon"
@Ilhan How to say "I have no idea how economics works" in a tweet
@ewarren Is this where you admit you're white?
@PattyMurray What we are sick and tired of are braindead senators who just spew rhetoric instead of facing the facts of the world. Don't you have a baby to kill right now or something else sadistic to push for?
@IlhanMN Are you praying Jihad finds him?
@PattyMurray For every America (minus you shmucks in Congress), since the ACA was enacted by you and your comrades, health care has been higher costs, lost coverage, &amp; worrying about what else is around the corner.
@shaunking @TheDemocrats are racists?! Well clutch my pearls! Btw, when are you going to admit being in blackface?
@PattyMurray You got mad he handed you and all the other socialists their a$$ in front of the entire country
@SenSchumer LMAO, you're not wrong. CBS poll had 76% agreeing with @realDonaldTrump speech. @staceyabrams tried to convinve us it was 1960 and that the Socialists had taken over since there were "bread lines"
@PattyMurray Proving once again that charity is more effective than government hand outs
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Is that what you call over 100 miles of wall built by Obama?
@TheLeadCNN Is that starting now? Because you've blind to it within your own party for decades Senator
@ananavarro Ah, we love it when you get so butt hurt you go racist #BuildTheWall
@CNNSitRoom @wolfblitzer @tedlieu @TheDemocrats trying to ruin the country over pettiness, one court case at a time (slow clap)
@IlhanMN I guess you forgot google exists......	https://t.co/pPttT1IaTb
@SenBlumenthal Why are you asking her questions that you know she can't publicly answer because of the possibility of it being a case in the future? Sit your lying a$$ down and stfu #StolenValor
@washingtonpost So it's literally true, but you've got nothing else so you're trying to spin it into something a technicality? Perhaps you should rewatch that $5.2M Super Bowl commercial you ran, because you've clearly forgotten the message it said. #EnemyOfThePeople
@RepAnnieKuster @realDonaldTrump @RepBonamici @RepCheri @NydiaVelazquez @RepMarcyKaptur @LeaderHoyer @RepSpanberger @RepSherrill Looking salty AF, good job......
@TheDemocrats What job did they get done exactly? Looking salty AF, yup! Looking pissed off that child sex trafficking was being cracked down on, check! Looking rabid that they were called out on murdering babies, sure did! You took one to the face last night, and looked stupid doing it...
@PattyMurray The only good faith displayed by you and your comrades is that we can count on you to always negotiate in bad faith.  Thank you for proving once again that you can never trust the word of a @TheDemocrats
@KimStrassel And it was in the wrong context. Their first applause was for 58% of the jobs created were occupied by women. I guess nobody told them at Representative Orientation that their seat has been around for decades.....
@IlhanMN "My sister @RashidaTlaib and I have been fighting against Israel*, any effort to deny that is a smear" There, I fixed it for you. We know who you rub shoulders with. The only peace you seek is from the death of everyone else who doesn't believe as you do
@PattyMurray You're the face of absolute evil with a good helping of stupidity. The only track you need to be on is towards retirement.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You mean the lady who thinks it's the 1960s? Yeah I'm sure you needed comedic relief after that scorching the President put on you
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They already have the 250 miles they are asking for........
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump How many times did you watch them say into a microphone and yet you're still here trying to say they're against it
@iamcardib I hear you like these https://t.co/OPMojvkBvh
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump NY Times, Gizmodo....? They are Libertarian, it's in their mission statement.......Border Patrol is CBP....?
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump CBP (the experts who work the wall) say otherwise	https://t.co/PpUorr7SoQ	btw, CATA is Libertarian, they believe in open borders
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump lmao, try again
@GSwarthout @IlhanMN Mom called and said you left your testicles on the night stand again. Her boyfriend’s coming over and he doesn’t want to see that. Your opinion of what's "cool" is irrelevant
@IlhanMN @Jamiemlong @NickAFrentz Science says Allah isn't real.....
@RepJayapal Because the Constitutional right of Due Process is wrong? Because getting black out drunk is smart to do? I thought there was an epidemic of rape culture in this country? Make up your mind
@KamalaHarris Good, maybe she'll tell you how your socialist policies have ruined what used to be a beautiful state
@washingtonpost Turn what around?  He's doing what we put him there to do. You guys throwing a two year hissy fit and taking all the trolling bait offered to you since the election has been icing on the cake
@AOC Odd you didn't let that play longer where the polling flips once all the actual math is done.......
@PattyMurray Your socialist policies hurt more people in WA than anything else. Don't believe me? Lets take a trip down to one of the many homeless tent cities and ask why they are there
@IlhanMN Only in America can a sitting Representative of Congress cry about people trying to "silence" them or "treat them like a 2nd class citizen" on a social media platform in their party's back pocket and still believe they are some sort of victim.....
@TheDemocrats @staceyabrams I'd rather shove a hot iron in my eye
@washingtonpost Should have invited the Covington kids just to rub your nose in the mess you made
@RepAdamSchiff Is that desperation or your diaper I'm smelling?
@SenSchumer It must really chap your salty a$$ that your approval rating is lower than Trumps
@PattyMurray Nothing hurts families and the economy more than liberal socialist policies.
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny It's okay, I'd tell you to buck up and keep trying to improve your reading comprehension, but I don't see it getting any better no matter how hard you try. I'll let you have the last word since you seem to be so desperate to have it.
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny You could answer your own questions if you could, thanks for playing
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny Reading is fundamental
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny LMAO!
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny ah there we are, back to "copy and paste", this time Mr. Spock, well it was a good run while it lasted
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny Yeah, I wouldn't doubt human interaction is a foreign concept for you
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny you managed to put together a sentence all on your own without help from any meme or other website, I'm so proud I'm choking up!
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny awwww, now you're copying me, I'm flattered
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny strange, you didn't use a Sponge Bob meme......trying to change your image now? Too late for that buddy
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny lmao, your head must hurt after using that word
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny lol, says the guy who posts Sponge Bob memes, so cute
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny I can't tell if you have an IQ in double digits
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny I doubt you know what the definition of palpable, or irony for that matter, even is.  we both know you copied and pasted that from somewhere else
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny I love it when you prove my point for me
@mozzfett @SusanHargrave7 @RepMichaelWaltz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump because the people who actually do the job on the border are asking for it. It's called listening to the experts, not reading biased headlines
@Rocks4Kimber @rep_stevewomack #BuildTheWall #SayNoToSocialism
@washingtonpost Yeah, we've wised up to the fact that he lives rent free in your head
@ashesinyourhair @RepRoKhanna @RashidaTlaib Actually it's not, if it was it'd be in the Constitution, which it's not
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny lol, wiki, 35 on the ASVAB it is. You're very welcome
@ashesinyourhair @RepRoKhanna @RashidaTlaib If there are conflicts of interest, the IRS would know it already. Still none of your business, nor do you have the right to demand them.
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny Oh sweet, a child's retort, either you got a 35 on your ASVAB or you're full of shit yourself #StolenValor
@RepRoKhanna @RashidaTlaib Literally the least important thing for Congress to be concentrating on. The guy was audited for the last 15 years before his election. If there was something in them we'd know. If taxes become apart of the criteria to become President then you'd have a point, but its not so....
@HELPCmteDems @PattyMurray Congrats, we here at the Committee for the Rare Combination of Pure Evil and Pure Stupid would like to congratulate you on becoming our new poster child!
@ABCPolitics I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that neither one of these morons will be able to be an adult tonight
@planetzainab @Ilhan @RashidaTlaib Strange, considering the ban has to do with countries and not religion. It includes the Christians of those nations too, well the couple that you guys haven't executed yet anyway.....
@RepJayapal Who are you exactly?
@washingtonpost ...to spin it into Trumps fault
@brianstelter Have they ever been?
@SenGillibrand You're not prepared to do anything but bend over and take what @DNC tells you to
@Govt_Issue_Joe @gillibrandny Yup, as a an actual war vet who didn't sit in the rear with the gear, I'm in the unique position that can do exactly that
@PattyMurray @FBI Lets go ask the massive homeless population in Seattle what caused their "tremendous damage"
@PattyMurray I think that's been the law since 1963
@PattyMurray @Lilly_Ledbetter It's been the law since 1963, what year do you live in?
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED Watching a sitting US Senator call for ignoring the US Constitutional right of Due Process is a lesson for future generations in the irresponsible use of positional power
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED Why don't you represent the survivors of birth?
@PattyMurray @usedgov The only thing you hold accountable is an infants life after birth you distgusting c@nt
@AOC So? Why do you think you have a right to it?
@igorvolsky How do you legislate somebodies poor decisions in life? How would you stop the parents from buying a firearm if they've never done anything wrong in life?
@Ilhan Going to go out on a limb and say that there is a perfectly legal reason, you just don't like it, nor do you have the ovarian fortitude to try and change said law
@gillibrandny LMAO logistics? He sat in a boat, no where near any danger, and made sure the Captain had his morning coffee (slow clap)
@MSNBC Because government got involved.....
@washingtonpost @PostEverything I was in the military, Obama was a total pussy
@PattyMurray Again, you're either ignoring the experts at the border, or you really are this stupid
@SenAngusKing @Morning_Joe You have my deepest sympathy. You're going to need a proper delousing when you're done there, scrub hard, scrub deep, and use bleach
@PattyMurray So I guess you think all the experts who actually work at the border are just full of sh!t huh? Quick question, is your "responsible border security" along the same lines of your "Affordable Healthcare" and "Common Sense Gun Control"?
@AOC Reason #1,596,784 to not let government anywhere near healthcare
@went1955 @AOC That's up until the actual numbers are shown, then support drops like Bill Clintons pants in a strip club
@SenKamalaHarris Our military's job is to literally protect our country and its borders........
@washingtonpost Nobody has done more to kill the free press reputation than you and your friends who forgot what "unbiased" means
@AOC @AyannaPressley @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Probably because they didn't do anything wrong, but hey, lets make it easier for child sex traffickers, you should make that your next campaign slogan
@shaunking @NFL @Kaepernick7 I don't think they care what a man who is in blackface has to say about their product.....
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED So you want to violate due process rights?
@PattyMurray They have since 1963......
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Schmuck @SenSchumer , feel free to explain where the ACA actually did what it was promised to do
@Gwendol69280110 @SteveScalise Playing the copy game now, that'll teach me. Take your own advice then swallow your lies. Have a great Trump is your President Day ;D
@RashidaTlaib Your socialist policies made Detroit what it is today, and you think increasing it will help......?
@SenSanders Why do you think you have a right to other peoples property? Those billionaires already pay over 50% of the country's taxes. You want to see your policies in practice? Take a good long look at CA, NY, NJ, IL. How braindead and jealous do you have to be to think that's a good idea
@IlhanMN @TheDailyShow @Trevornoah I'd rather have sex with my wife instead of just watching her boyfriend do it
@PattyMurray Did you just copy and paste the "Equal Pay Act" of 1963, because it's been law for decades, you just don't know how to break down a spreadsheet to specifics.....
@IlhanMN @RepLeeZeldin He was referring to putting someone with your blatant anti-Semitism on the committee, not someone of your religion. If it wasn't for the Liberal press covering your bigotry and hate you'd be a one term Rep.
@IlhanMN Nobody is trying to silence you, that's not what criticizing your words does. They're not spinning your words, you were quite clear in your comments.  Are you not strong enough to handle the criticism?
@AOC LMAO, they passed the Civil Rights Act did they? This must be what they call "revisionist history". That "Great Society" also locked up American citizens in internment camps, and that's what you want to return to? No wonder you want gun control so badly......
@PattyMurray Yes, you've made it clear you don't care what the experts have to say and you're willing to sacrifice Americans in the name of your pride and politics.
@JonathanRMcCui1 @SenatorShaheen @PattyMurray @SenatorHassan Sure have, I've also looked into how they get the "gender gap" and how it's debunked. I'm opposed to a complete waste of tax payer time and money on a made up issue. Equal pay for equal work is the reality in this country
@JonathanRMcCui1 @SenatorShaheen @PattyMurray @SenatorHassan Because "You can't pay males more than females for equal work" needs improving?  Seems pretty spot on to me
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This is funny coming from the guy who leads the charge against killing all of American Industry and enslaving everybody to government dependency.  You're fucking pathetic Chump @SenSchumer
@chrislhayes I'll save you the money. There's male, female, and then 63 versions of gay larping
@AbdulElSayed @AOC Pretty sure they are only reacting to her braindead statements.........
@jb_dean @SpeakerPelosi Damn Democrats and their internment camps
@WendyMeer11 @SpeakerPelosi Traitors deserve a traitors death
@SpeakerPelosi Which party did that exactly @DNC?
@TheDemocrats You can miss a layup, and you just did, then fell flat on your back with this one. Trump stopped you from leaving the country during the shutdown, or did you forget getting grounded by the Commander in Chief?
@PattyMurray @Lilly_Ledbetter You are a monument of what can happen when brain dead people get together and vote
@AOC @DemSocialists If it was real, as some allege. Then why don't greedy companies only hire women?
@TheDemocrats All you have to do is listen to the experts at the border.......
@KamalaHarris lol, this is where you lost. If liberals understood the value of hard work, they wouldn't be liberals
@Gwendol69280110 @SteveScalise This is why you should google before you post
@Gwendol69280110 @SteveScalise You're welcome.
@Gwendol69280110 @SteveScalise It's not a law, it's an Obama Executive Order. Just like DAPA which was found unconstitutional so DACA will too. Trump told Congress that they have to make it law because they are the only ones who legally can, but @DNC always turns it down when offered by Trump
@Humberbeat There's male, female, and then 62 different versions of gay larping https://t.co/AnQRpRiFGK
@ABCPolitics Chump @SenSchumer wouldn't know a fact if it was pegging him. If you think that IC Leads are going to tell the truth in a public forum then you don't know what the IC is. Which isn't surprising.
@kaitlancollins @abbydphillip Holy unrelated issues Batman! Is this what passes for journalism?
@ABCPolitics They must be working on their tan and need lotion rubbed on then
@ABC Send them back over the border, plenty of places to eat in Mexico
@PattyMurray REMINDER: This has been debunked over and over but you'd rather play Oppression Olympics because without it you would be exposed for the fraud you are.
@ABCPolitics @jparkABC So the experts who work the border are full of crap?
@SteveScalise One thing is for sure, they'll betray DACA for the umptenth time, they need that for political points in 2020 #DACADemBetrayal
@ABCPolitics Look at the amount of idiots who belive this. DACA is a breath away from being found unconstitutional becaues it's an Executive Order (see DAPA). Trump told you in Congress to fix it because you're the only ones who legally can and you keep voting against DACA. #DACADemBetrayal
@SenatorCantwell Then tell them to do equal work?
@ewarren Can you point out which kids don't have the oppurtunity to succeed in this country?
@kaitlancollins So @SpeakerPelosi isn't listening to the experts who do the job?
@BernieSanders Or we could just not give any country that wants to kill us any more money......
@PattyMurray @rosadelauro Congrats on wasting time for a law that has already existed since 1963! Leave it to you hard working ladies to copy Kennedy's work and pass it off as your own.
@JonathanRMcCui1 @SenatorShaheen @PattyMurray @SenatorHassan It's been the law since the 1963 Equal Pay Act.....
@griffbos @SenatorShaheen @PattyMurray @SenatorHassan Yeah strange how they can read employment statistics and testicular challanged "men" like us cant
@SenatorShaheen @PattyMurray @SenatorHassan This has been law since The Equal Pay Act of 1963, why are you wasting time and money on a nonissue that has been disproven over and over again?
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo If you think what the IC Leads say in a public forum infront of cameras is the same as what they say behind doors then you're a special kind of stupid. Feel free to check that against Clapper and @JohnBrennan statements. This from the guy who said only he can legally read emails
@kaitlancollins If you think what's briefed to the President by IC leads is the same as what is said in an open forum, you're a special kind of stupid.  Feel free to check that against Clapper and @JohnBrennan statements to Congress
@SenBlumenthal Pretty sure vets don't want to hear what you have to say
@PattyMurray Then may I recommend listening to what the experts at the border are asking for. Also, if you plan on sacrificing DACA/TPS for the fourth time over your pride, please don't ask for election funds anymore #DACADemBetrayal
@CNNSitRoom @wolfblitzer @RepSwalwell I love this guy, he's a kindred spirit. We weak and spineless "males" need to stick together while our wives seek comfort in the arms of men with testicular fortitude. I'll bring the juice boxes, you bring the moist towellets for clean up.
@KamalaHarris You're from Oakland, look around that shithole and understand it's your policies that made it that way
@SenBlumenthal So your solution is to make sure the parents can't protect their children from people who don't care about your laws?
@HouseDemocrats Weren't you guys calling the GOP ran House a bunch of traitors for not doing what Obama wanted just a couple years ago? You guys swap positions more than my wife does on gangbang night
@nytimes @viaSimonRomero @itscaitlinhd Weird, you can claim asylum at ports of entry.......?
@PattyMurray Then sign whatever the experts say they need and stop spitting on DACA #DACADemBetrayal
@KamalaHarris How are you going to make criminals turn in their guns? This has about as much chance as I do being the only dude in my marriage
@RashidaTlaib @JussieSmollett This story is about as believable as me being the father of my wifes kids
@Stepledpie @nytimes @DNC Whoa there big guy, who said i was having sex with my wife? I wish! I suggest you look at the pieces of what I said to see that puzzle. Then I suggest actually looking at the evidence presented, since it is a whole in itself separate from what you keep trying to tie it to
@Stepledpie @nytimes @DNC Oh she is, you can see it in her eyes as she stares at me while being pleased by better men than me. Look if you need help reading vote results let me know, I'll help you out.  You apparently don't understand what definitive proof is.
@Stepledpie @nytimes @DNC You'd be the first to turn down my wife's free meal, your loss.  However, none of those bills had anything to do with opening any portion of the government, they only dealt with getting a paycheck out, that's it.  The proof is in your face, not my fault if you wish to ignore it
@Stepledpie @nytimes @DNC https://t.co/rzgjRg6ym6	https://t.co/1csTXSDe0Y	https://t.co/29hIFf5sDg
@Stepledpie @nytimes @DNC I'd bet my wife's sweet ass (so I'm told it is by her boyfriend anyway) that I am.  All 3 alternative motions on bills put forth, all 3 were just to get a paycheck out to workers, neither side losing or gaining.  Here are the votes below, now ask why they weren't reported
@shaunking @BernieSanders @GQMagazine Brilliant, like wearing black face for so long people actually think you're a legitimate representative of that community? Brilliant like tricking "useful idiots" into paying for your third beach house? Brilliant like tricking people into thinking you won't raise their taxes?
@MSNBC Can I get a definition on "standing there aggressively". I need to learn what this is exactly so I don't look like I'm against Tyrone and the boys having their way with my wife on those rare occasions I'm allowed to stay in the room
@nytimes Makes you wonder why @DNC voted to not pay workers checks while they figured out how to end the shutdown on 17 Jan. The only thing the vote was for was to get checks out, nothing to do with how to open gov back up, but you ignored this vote, why? https://t.co/1csTXSDe0Y
@shaunking You know what's sad, watching you commit the ultimate Black Face. I let dudes bang my wife all day, and I'm still a hundred times more respectable than you.
@washingtonpost It's come to my attention that sitting on your hands, like I do when my wife's boyfriends are over, when somebody else is giving military members a standing ovation isn't the best look. Most people say it's a sign of weakness, I say I'm doing my part to stay #woke
@KamalaHarris Then you should probably work with @realDonaldTrump because he's shown time and time again he's willing to do so. My guess is you're going to place your pride and politics in front of the people you claim to advocate for, just like you did to DACA #DACADemBetrayal
@ajdukakis @ABCPolitics Your name is synonymous for not just simply losing but getting absolutely stomped. Just like I am when Tyrone come over to please my wife. Chin up though, just have to keep bringing fresh towels and water. You keep plugging away too, I'm sure somebody will care what you say soon
@davidgshortell @jeremyherb oooooooh, so this is what being ratioed looks like. I admire you tooting your own horn even though nobody believes you.  I toot my own horn too, but that's when my wife is busy with her boyfriends and I'm not holding her hand at that moment.  Keep up the good work, #1 fan here
@SenSanders @chrislhayes What's pathetic is that you guys drew a line in the sand that you already crossed to the tune of 53B and 700 miles of wall, but 5B and 250 was all of a sudden immoral. What's pathetic is you approved 100 miles for Obama, but now you say it's racist.
@KamalaHarris So is the 100 miles of wall you gave Obama a vanity project? Are the other 600 miles of wall a vanity project? Why are you insulting the DHS workers you just praised asking for a vanity project? Now you're going to have a 4th time to betray DACA/TPS #DACADemBetrayal
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Is the 100+ mile portion of the wall approved by Obama racist? Are you suggesting we take down the 700 miles of it already built? Are all the DHS/Border Patrol agents calling for it racist (52% of them are Hispanic)? Is your betrayal of DACA/TPS Lives racist? #DACADemBetrayal
@ciccmaher @shaunking @thenation So the side upholding the Venezuelan Constitution is wrong......?
@PattyMurray Wow, I've seen what a bad anal night can look like in my wifes bed, but that doens't come close to the load of crap you just spewed. @DNC are not dealing, the only offers of negotiation made have been from the other side. DACA ring a bell? #DACADemBetrayal
@washingtonpost You can't just say "criminal activity", you actually have to point at the specific activity that is criminal. Did they not teach you that in Journalism school?
@ShoulderCobras @KamalaHarris @DNC That's the whole bill
@ShelleyPersists @leftcoastbabe @MarkWarner Why would government workers be rich? They are paid by taxes....?
@MarkWarner @TheDemocrats Nobody believes that Mark. Braces are financed, I know I've paid for several of my wifes kids. Oh no, not the camping trip! Let's ask DACA people, that you betrayed (again!), feel about that. #DACADemBetrayal
@ShoulderCobras @KamalaHarris @DNC How is giving the workers their paycheck bad legislation? That's all the legislation dealt with........
@ABC 37% of people who pay attention to ABC and the Washinton Post like Trump? You guys must really hate that
@KamalaHarris Then why did @DNC vote not to give them their paychecks while you negotiate the shutdown? Why are you betraying DACA/TPS LIVES (again) for a couple paychecks and your pride? Does DACA only matter during an election year? #DACADemBetrayal
@TheDemocrats As a man* who is used to strangers taking advantage, this is clearly Union comrades saying what their political masters ask them to. Even a neutered wimp like me can see your trying to scare people with "could", instead of "will". Like "Tyrone will use my wife like a wet rag"
@KamalaHarris Then why is the only thing you guys won't accept in the bill is the additional 200 miles of obstruction identified by DHS/Border Patrol as needed? Is stability in the LIVES of DACA not worth a couple paychecks and your pride? #DACADemBetrayal
@nemontemi @ABC oh i get it, because you disapprove of my life style I must be a foreign bot of some sort. How xenophobic. I'll have you know if I had a back bone I'd write something mean. Now if you'll excuse me some people in my bedroom are calling out for a mop and towel
@RepAdamSchiff You are the dumbest neutered fuck in Washington. Contacting WikiLeaks isn't illegal. Trump joked about having Russia find the 30k subpoenaed emails Clinton destroyed.
RT @RepTomRice: Democrats are three for three on not paying furloughed government employees during the shutdown. It's past time for Speaker…
@MarkWarner Then why does the @DNC keep voting down bills that only deal with paying the workers, not the disagreements over reopening the gov? One side has been trying to negotiate, the other has not. Do it now because you have proven you do not negotiate in good faith
@ABC Shocker, liberal unoin leaders back Democrats. I'm the king of spineless so I recognize my own kind. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get my wifes bed ready for Tyrone and the boys. She'll be pissed if I don't put out enough lube again....
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics bwahahahahaha! Couldn't handle the truth so you blocked me huh Hagrid?  Never mess with a cuck, we have nothing but time on our hands while our wives are busy with other men!
@washingtonpost @PostEverything Because they didn't have 60 members in the Senate.....? #Civics101
@SenBlumenthal Weird how they only took place in Liberal ran cities by liberal ran unions.........?
@Emma4Change Have it in Colorado Springs and I'll be impressed
@ABC keep it shutdown until this dumb cunt negotiates
@KamalaHarris Weird how only liberal cities have this problem? I'm going to go on a limb and say this is coming from Union leaders, hmmmmm........
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell @SenateMajority @GOP Yeeeeaaaah, you just have the bills in front of your face.......Good luck in life bud, you're going to need it
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell @SenateMajority @GOP Incorrect, you do not need to open government to pay the workers. That's why bills were put forward to pay the workers while the government was shutdown. @DNC voted them down. HJR 28 (17 Jan), HR 648 (23 Jan), HJR 31 (24 Jan), and this in Sen 24 Jan https://t.co/3tkdDMmUEg
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell @SenateMajority @GOP Do you need pictures, sock puppets? The shutdown will go on because neither side agrees on how to reopen gov. What I'm talking has nothing to do with that. These 4 bills only get paychecks out, not open up gov. Why do you not want to pay workers while gov figures the rest out?
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell @SenateMajority @GOP Holy shit Hagrid, what did you smoke for breakfast? There is no twisting, it's two different (very real) topics. I'm not talking about any opening up government bills. These are bills that only pay checks to workers, that's all. 3 in House, 1 in Senate. All voted down by @DNC
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell @SenateMajority Everytime @DNC proposes a bill it's what they want to reopen gov. @GOP has proposed what they want to open gov too. However, now pay attention here, @GOP have also proposed bills to pay workers that has nothing to do with reopening government. How is this confusing to you?
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell No shit, they block each others proposals about opening up the 25% closed. Again, for the slow people in the audience. There were 4 bills proposed that dealt with only getting workers a pay check, not on opening up government, and @DNC voted it down.
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell That's weird, because they're the ones who put forth a bill to pay the workers (4 times now) while the rest is figured out. Why should either side accept the others proposal? Why not work a deal where both get what they want? Why not pay the workers while they figure that out?
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems @DNC @TurtleMcConnell You're still not understanding what I'm saying. The 4 bills voted down by @DNC were strictly for getting the workers a pay check. They had nothing to do with the argument over opening the government.
@EppardBruce @CNNPolitics @SenateDems Easy, they don't agree on a couple issues. That doesn't answer why @DNC keeps voting down bills that will pay workers while they figure out the rest.
@MedicinalTrolls @S_LeGresley @mfolgw @davidhogg111 I just saw my comrade deleted his posts for some reason. That's okay, give him time, I am the inevitable conclusion of the woke white guy mentality. Now if you'll excuse me I need to make breakfast for my wife’s lovers and her kids. Judging from the empty lube bottle, laundry too
@moccothepro @stevie_bro @BrazilBrian @shaunking I admire his strength, especially in his quads and glutes as he thrusts like a wild stallion. Alas, the best I can get out of him is a grunt when I offer him a towel and drink when he's done.
@washingtonpost Remember guys, when the girls get back from bashing the fascists they're going to want the feel of a strong lover to whip their feminine frenzy into an orgasmic blue wave. DM me to meet my wife’s boyfriends so they can give them what we can't. We'll play board games while we wait
@EichbergerUSA @washingtonpost Pulling out, just like Tyrone and the boys do when I upset them by not having the snacks and towels ready for them fast enough while they're pleasing my wife so I have prove my white guilt by washing the sheets.
@CNNPolitics This is grossly incorrect, you should be embarassed. As embarassed as I get when when real men look me in the eyes as they pleasure my wife. Quick question, why did @SenateDems vote down giving the CG a paycheck without reopening gov, when they knew both plans would fail?
@stevie_bro @BrazilBrian @shaunking Now you're speaking my language, I'm looking for another Bridge partner, DM me and we'll get the wives together and introduce yours to Tyrone and the boys. My wifes boyfriends are great and only ask for chilled water when their done with the girls. You'll love it.
@davidhogg111 How do you say "power corrupts" but advocate for a political philosophy that gives all the power to the government.......?
@SenBlumenthal Quick question, since Stone was arrested for lying to Congress, will you be brought up on charges for lying to Congress and the American people over your stolen valor?
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK The people that hate old rich white guys props up old rich white guy.......
@BrazilBrian @shaunking Sounds like another cry baby that doesn't know how to control his feelings #ToxicMasculinity
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Schmuck Schumer, you are counting on people not actually looking into what's being asked for. 215 miles being asked for by the experts who work the border. Do you not trust their word? Should we take down the hundreds of miles that are already built?
@NotreDame  Just watched Father John say that the Irish would get offended over a painting.  Somebody needs to remind him that the Irish aren't that weak.
@SenJackReed You literally voted today to not pay CG members while knowing this bill your propping up wouldn't pass.  I bet you can bend over far enough to kiss your own ass.
@mattdpearce @chrislhayes Shutup, the @DNC doesn't fear monger.  Our loyal comrades in Unions wouldn't stoop that low
@KamalaHarris Quick question, would those people you're describing live in high tax states ran by @DNC by chance? CA, NY for example? Because I'm doing just fine and can't wait to file my taxes to get a bigger refund from the tax cuts. You do not have a right to the money I earn, MOLON LABE
@SenBlumenthal Shocker they don't believe you will negotiate in good faith.  Believing you'll negotiate after you get what you want is about as believable as your military service. Quick question, why did you vote no to paying CG members today?
@washingtonpost Uh, he's on video saying he was a Vietnam Vet and "In Theater".....
@alan_mhgl @SpeakerPelosi Beat me to it Alan, oh the wives say to put the bottled water on ice. Tyrone and the boys said they were going to "bang a new hole in the guts of your wives" so they're going to work up a powerful thirst. I got Season 2 of "Girls" for us to watch while they're busy
@PattyMurray "I keep seeing this old white lady tell me she cares and she will fight for me to stay in the only country I've ever known, but every time they offer to let me stay, this white lady keeps voting no. I'm about to be deported to a country whose language I don't speak" #DACAStroies
@KamalaHarris Unconscionable, like you voting to not pay CG personnel today? Or you betraying DACA for the 3rd time? Keep trading a couple paychecks for DACA LIVES and we'll trade you out too. #DACADemBetrayal
@KamalaHarris You literally just listed a bunch of places that are "Gun Free Zones", how much did the shooter care about that?
@cwil88 @S_LeGresley @mfolgw @davidhogg111 It's sickening seeing him take advantage of his white privilege to gain admittance to an Ivey league school with subpar grades that didn't even get him in UC Davis.  I'm so mad at his, and my skin, I'm going to ask my wife to smear my face in her boyfriend’s wet spot tonight
@TheDemocrats That's right comrades. We'll show him soon enough what a bread line is as soon as socialism takes over this country. Now who is going to come over and bang my wife tonight?
@S_LeGresley @mfolgw @davidhogg111 Weak and defensless is who we are. It's why our wives seek pleasure in other peoples arms. Most women are made of stiffer stuff than us. Embrace it, you'll feel better. It's kind of strange at first, but soon the orgasmic wails coming from your bedroom will bring you satisfaction
@S_LeGresley @mfolgw @davidhogg111 Because you're walking down Cuckville St on your way to PoundMyWife Town with this neutered thought process. Population us. I make a mean non-alcoholic margarita and cleaning up your bed when your wife is done with it can be therapeutic, you'll see comrade
@S_LeGresley @mfolgw @davidhogg111 Whoa there big boy, pump the breaks and re-read what I said. I'm with you guys. You think I'm man enough to actually stand up and defend myself? If that were true my children would look like me and not the line of strange men that comes through my home. You'll understand soon
@Rainbows2xs @SecNielsen None of that is in the current plan that is in the link to the DHS that spells out specifically where the current, and planned portions (shutdown portion) are going.
@Rainbows2xs I'm not sure what you're looking at but here are the specifics	https://t.co/MEgUXclglV
@MarkWarner Looks like I spoke too soon. The @DNC just voted down paying federal workers for the 3rd time in the house, while you personally, voted down paying the CG.
@mfolgw @davidhogg111 The further pussification of your generation is fun to watch. I can't wait until we sit together and knit or bake cookies while Tyrone and the boys give our wives what we lack, testicular fortitude.
The political officers in the media are doing a good job at hiding this https://t.co/9JTSVz4q0y
@MarkWarner Did you send a letter to your comrads in the House to stop voting no on paying the workers? Two times they voted down so far. Your political officers in the media are doing a good job of hiding it, but word is starting to leak out
@Rainbows2xs Those two say it's "immoral". The 250 mile new seciton, but not the sections that already exist for some reason, nor do they advocate taking down the sections already up. Just fyi, environmental concerns will be ignored if deemed needed.
@KamalaHarris Then why did @DNC vote against paying them, twice? Clean is an interesting word for your bill, Neutered would be the more accurate term
@nachosarah My wife is willing to loan you her boyfriend for some stress relief if you need it. My wrists are too limp to fulfill your offer though ;( Well I wouldn't want the reward, but Tyrone said he would gladly accept it for me, like he does from wife.....
@Rainbows2xs Agreed, why are Chuck and Nancy making it some weird moral issue. Looks more like personal spite to me
@Rainbows2xs Because it's already alotted to it's specific section that it's building, the current bill is for additional areas identified by DHS/Border Patrol as needing barriers to help them do their jobs
@BoredLosing @SenCoryGardner These are the same polls that said Clinton had a 90% chance to win......
@SenCoryGardner Don't let the adults that still have their balls/ovaries get you down. You are making the right choice by joining the neutered on the Left. If you and your wife need help picking her new boyfriend I'm available for advice on how to find the right guy to please her #RINO #BetaMale
@Waitingfour4 @SegaTape @nytimes Another shining example of knee jerk reaction before all the evidence was in.  Psssssst, it wasn't a Covington kid
@Rainbows2xs Because sections of it are already being built through prior funding......? We just talked about that
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Hey Chuck, DACA/TPS would like to know if you're going to betray them again over a couple of paychecks? Stability in their LIVES were offered and turned it down. Must not be an election year #DACADemBetrayal
@HouseDemocrats Yet you voted down the two bills to pay the workers.....?
A total disgrace to the uniform https://t.co/y5AcgbUOqb
@Rainbows2xs The wall already exists in parts and the money allocated to funding those sections already under construction is for those specific areas. That's how government funding works. The bill in question is for $5.7B is for an additional 250 mile segment identified by Border Patrol
@Rainbows2xs @liberalvixen @GOP @HistrymajorLass 60 votes needed, 51 Republicans (minus Flake, Corker, and the other Rhinos). Anything less will result in lawsuits by the DNC to delay it for years. 2 years ago illegal crossings went down, they've since gone back up, or do you think things stay the same?
@liberalvixen @GOP @HistrymajorLass Interesting that you don't understand what bills take 60 Senate votes and which ones don't.
@tightline88 @GOP Border Patrol is asking for the wall.....
@CoreyGraziano @GOP Border Patrol wants the wall......
@HadleyTa @GOP You seem to be unaware of @DNC track record about negotiating in good faith if you give them what they want before hand
@KamalaHarris That's weird, because that's exactly what the experts who actually do the job say it's for, why aren't you listening to them?  If you really cared about paying those people you would have told @HouseDemocrats to vote yes to pay them, but they voted no, twice
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes It's pathetic looking at an adult who can't handle reality
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes Painting yourself the color of the sporting event to support your team isn't racist. If that was the case then that would make 75% of all the schools in the country racist
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes I believe you have never been to a sporting event, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that in the context pictured below you would be correct https://t.co/vK1OBCy8aJ
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes Please post your evidence
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes Are you going to tell me you've never been to a "black out night" sporting event?  Actually that might be the most believable thing about all of this....
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes I'll take "Things that never happened" for $1000 Alex
Not only are @DNC @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi betraying federal workers paychecks. They're betraying DACA/TPS LIVES the stability they promise to give them but never deliver when it's offered by the side that's supposedly "racist" #DACADemBetrayal https://t.co/os5LDICQSd
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes That's the thing, they weren't by anyone who can properly make that assesment.  Only by the same people who are trying their hardest to justify their previous gross actions against the kids. i.e. you
@weallscrewed @Marrrrcussss @nytimes Is there a time to pin such a thing on a group of people that you can't identify as the ones having done it?
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK After a long day of hating my skin color, there's nothing I love more than coming home and getting the drinks, snacks, and towels ready for Tyrone and the boys when they're done with my wife. I sit down with all the kids (none mine of course) and show them I'm doing my part.
@glamelegance @CNNPolitics The Secret Service made them.......
@SegaTape @nytimes Being able to post the full, almost 2 hour, unedited video might have had just a tad to do with it
@tobycuthcourt @nytimes A random guy that's going to be every person who advocated violence against children scapegoat*
@Marrrrcussss @nytimes You'd think you would have learned your lesson about knee jerk reactions to edited video, but nope, here you are
@chrislhayes There what is?  Btw, our wives would like cucumber water this time when Tyrone is done with them..........oh and don't forget those finger sandwiches on your way home
@KamalaHarris The people? Are Dreamers people? Because you're choosing a couple paychecks and your pride over those people by denying them (for the 3rd time!) a stable legal existence in the only country they've ever known over a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago #DACADemBetrayal
@MSNBC #FacesofDeath, just missing @maduro_en https://t.co/b6NrwxIZ7M
@darkchocoIate @MSNBC Like Trump 2016 was?
@davidhogg111 That's called trash
@MSNBC Because every time she opens her mouth she makes Trump 2020 more and more of a possibility...?
@PattyMurray You said you would fight for DACA, not betray it over a couple paychecks and your pride.  You also voted no to paying government workers the first check of 2019.  You have betrayed the country and the people because your puppet masters told you to #DACADemBetrayal
@OutFrontCNN @CNN @ErinBurnett Perhaps you should be reporting that only 9 @DNC Reps voted yes on paying government employees the missed first check despite the shutdown
@RepAdamSchiff Didn't you just vote no on paying government employees their first paycheck of 2019 despite the shutdown?
@RepAdamSchiff listen up you little weasel, you jackasses are choosing a couple paychecks over stability for millions of DACA/TPS LIVES on a bill that you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. It's not an election year so you don't care #DACADemBetrayal
@NateforSMOB @davidhogg111 should probably start blaming the people who run the place then before it becomes 7 years (@DNC looking at you)
@MFOLseattle @davidhogg111 I wouldn't walk around with food in the open like that, the giant homeless population due to @DNC policies are libel to gut you for it
After a long day of protesting that fascist @realDonaldTrump there's nothing I love more than getting the bottles of water and dry towels ready for Tyrone once he's done with my wife #AOC2020 https://t.co/9dnoItAcSX
@Andy_Johnsey @BenjaminNorton There's nothing to rob, that's the entire point of this......
@BenjaminNorton The US backed the side that's justified by the Venezuelan Constitution and not the dictator who destroyed the country through socialism and constantly breaks their Constitution. Canada and Brazil have just joined the US btw
@ananavarro Weird how you didn't say what political philosophy @maduro_en used to sink Venezuela and become a dictator.......?
@AOC  @RepAOC #Facesofdeath Are you going to support @maduro_en ? https://t.co/O2EiPJmR08
@CBSNews There's literally 250+ dead Russians in Syria who would disagree.......
@MSNBC @chrislhayes The controversy is in your initial reporting, Nathan Phillips lying about it and his service, and all the "tolerant" liberals demanding violence against children
@trendchasernews Somebody is about to win all the women's gold medals at the next Olympics #transathletes
@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi Need to push how @SpeakerPelosi is choosing a couple pay checks and her pride over stabilizing the LIVES of DACA/TPS over a bill she would have voted yes to 3 years ago. #DACADemBetrayal
@PattyMurray "@DNC @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi have denied DACA stability again, picking paychecks and their pride over our existence this country over a bill they would have voted yes on 3 years ago. I don't speak Spanish, but I'm about to be shipped to Mexico" #DACAStories #DACADemBetrayal
@charliekirk11 Need to bring to light that @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer are placing a couple paychecks over the LIVES of DACA/TPS on a bill they would have voted yes on 3 years ago, and not the first betrayal either. DACA lives only matter in an election year I guess #DACADemBetrayal
@SenatorCantwell If you vote yes to his proposal than over a million DACA/TPS recipients lives would gain stability.  However, you place a couple paychecks over actual Lives don't you. You only care about DACA in an election year it seems #DACADemBetrayal
@jaketapper @MarquardtA @TheLeadCNN I'd be pretty pissed too that only 9 @DNC Reps voted with @GOP to pay the first paycheck of 2019 despite shutdown. 9 wasn't enough to pass btw
@TheLeadCNN @MarquardtA Yeah I'd be pretty pissed the @DNC voted against paying me too
@washingtonpost Time for @maduro_en to take a helicopter ride
@SouthernGal918 @JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders Amazing how many people don't actually know what Conservatism is, but they'll gladly fund @SenSanders fourth beach house, again
@SouthernGal918 @JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders Which Conservative supports corporate welfare? They would belong on the next helicopter ride with the rest of the commies https://t.co/wFfx30bGFS

@SouthernGal918 @JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders It's amazing how many liberals don't know the Constitution specifically states the job of the Federal Government is to protect the nation and it's borders
@JediofGallifrey @SouthernGal918 @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders Yes because eating pets is the luxury socialsm has delivered, again
@KamalaHarris Does your values include using DACA/TPS only during an election year? #DACADemBetrayal
@JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders Which side is following the Constitution of Venezuela and which one isn't? Zero to do with US.  Socialism has failed........again
@SouthernGal918 @JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders Which side is following the Constitution of Venezuela and which one isn't? Zero to do with US.  Socialism has failed........again
@JediofGallifrey @WayneSumner3 @SenSanders You misspelled misspelled, and Constitutionally Legitimate President under the laws presented by the Venezuelan Constitution
@_Artozi @SenSanders Then asking for government to get involved is the last thing you should do, because those are the only two things that happens when it does
@SenSanders Lots of people think you should run again @SenSanders . So the only question you need to ask yourself is do you want another vacation home to cash in on once you roll over from the primaries being stolen from you again.
@SenSanders https://t.co/NFuPaHfATJ
https://t.co/fqIk7YQL16
@MarkWarner @MarkWarner it is simple, you are choosing a couple pay checks over DACA/TPS LIVES over a bill you would have voted for 3 years ago! You only care about Dreamers in election years it seems #DACADemBetrayal
@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris for the people, is that a joke? You're literally picking a couple pay checks over DACA/TPS LIVES by voting against a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. Just another betrayal because it's not an election year #DACADemBetrayal
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray you're picking a couple paychecks over DACA/TPS LIVES on a bill you would have voted yes to 3 years ago!!  Why not #DACAStories , oh yeah, it's not an election year......#DACADemBetrayal
@SenSanders @SenSanders @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC are saying loud and clear that a couple paychecks are more important than DACA/TPS LIVES! Another betrayal because it's not an election year. We will remember #DACADemBetrayal
@CNN @scottmclean Why is @CNN and @DNC ignoring DACA/TPS, again! A couple paychecks are nowhere near as important as DACA/TPS LIVES!! @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer would have voted yes 3 years ago! Another betrayal because it's not an election year #DACADemBetrayal
@mlip16 @CNN Don't get mad at the mirror. It's not the mirrors fault the reflection is ugly
@PattyMurray Again, you keep pushing a couple paychecks over DACA/TPS Lives!  Why not DACAStories?! #DACADemBetrayal
@mlip16 @CNN Woooooow, not only are you egocentric, but xenophobic and aporophobic.  However I'm guessing you present yourself in a different light. I'm glad you presented your true colors for the world to see.  You're also a horrible speller.......
@SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You need to push that @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer are placing a couple paychecks over the LIVES of DACA/TPS on a bill they would vote yes on 3 years ago. This is not the first time they've done this either #DACADemBetrayal
@mlip16 @CNN The point was made, but for some reason you're trying to make it about you.....
@GOP @GOP needs to push that @DNC @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi are placing a couple paychecks over the LIVES of DACA/TPS on a bill they would have voted yes to only 3 years ago. This isn't the first time they have committed this betrayal #DACADemBetrayal
@mlip16 @CNN Again, clearly you do as you try to associate a point to nothing I said. Here's a better question, why is it only the US that matters to you?
@mlip16 @CNN Your reading comprehension is ridiculous. I said "the world"	https://t.co/zEd3upjUfc
@CNN If you make more than $35k in the US, you are the 1% of the world.  For the first time in human history over half the worlds population is out of poverty, that is not because of the Socialism you Political Operatives at @CNN push
@SenSchumer We see you @SenSchumer  protecting a couple paychecks instead of doing something for DACA/TPS LIVES over a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. How many times are you and @SpeakerPelosi going to betray? DACA only matters to you in an election year #DACADemBetryal
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @GOP 3 years ago @realDonaldTrump wasn't President......
@RepDavidTrone @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @RepDavidTrone your talking about a couple paychecks will ignoring DACA/TPS LIVES over a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. This would the be third time @DNC has committed this betrayal. We see you, we will not forget it #DACADemBetrayal
@SenGillibrand @HillaryClinton spent $3B and got stomped
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @GOP People shouldn't be allowed to abuse the asylum system. All they are doing is delaying getting people who actually need it help by attempting to take a shortcut. This would still be the 3rd time @DNC betrayed everything they said to DACA/TPS #DACADemBetrayal
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer The offer is made, the goal posts are set, why so scared to vote yes for DACA/TPS? #DACADemBetrayal
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Poison pill to whom exactly? @GOP will vote yes for DACA/TPS, @DNC will vote no placing a couple paychecks over LIVES on a bill they all would have passed 3 years ago. It's a betrayal over @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer pride #DACADembetrayal
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer 51 GOP members in December, not all would have voted yes, i.e. Corker, Flake. More than 10 DNC votes would have been needed but @SenSchumer keeps a tight leash. Doesn't excuse the previous betrayals by the @DNC with DACA lives #DACADemBetrayal
@DoremusJ @amyklobuchar @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer 60 votes needed #Civics101
@VVAmerica You deleted your first post over this because of your gross knee jerk reaction, but appear to have forgotten this one @VVAmerica You are giving all us vets a bad name by leaving this up. Or maybe you condone the harassment of kids and stolen valor?
@amyklobuchar DACA/TPS was offered and @DNC is picking a couple paychecks over LIVES on a bill they all would have voted yes on 3 years ago. This will be the 3rd betrayal! Vote yes, LIVES are more important than @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer pride! #DACADemBetrayal take the deal!!
@CNNPolitics Stop placing paychecks over the LIVES of DACA/TPS. Vote yes and secure status. Do not commit this betrayal for the 3rd time @DNC on a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. LIVES are worth more than your childish pride! #DACADemBetrayal
Millions of DACA/TPS LIVES are being betrayed for the 3rd time by the DNC. How can you justify placing a couple paychecks over LIVES on a bill you would have signed yes on 3 years ago. We see you @DNC #DACADemBetrayal
@MSNBC Ohhh CBS says so? Quick question, have they changed their polling strategy since 2016?
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Do your job @RepJeffries . We see you placing a couple pay checks above the LIVES of DACA/TPS. This is the 3rd betrayal by the DNC, this time on a bill you would have signed yes to 3 years ago. We will not forget this #DACADemBetrayal
@RepDavidTrone @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump How many millions of DACA/TPS LIVES are you holding hostage? You're placing a couple paychecks over LIVES, committing this betrayal for the 3rd time. We see you. #DACADemBetrayal
@AdamSerwer @shaunking That's a strange way of saying "I support child sex trafficking" @AdamSerwer
@nytimes She's waiting for the government to do it for her
@RepAdamSchiff You have got to be the dumbest Senator on both sides. If you think we don't see you picking paychecks over DACA/TPS LIVES you are in for a rude awakening. You committed this betrayal for the 3rd time now over a bill you would have voted yes on 3 years ago. #DACADemBetrayal
@CNN He added DACA/TPS to the deal and you said no! You have betrayed DACA/TPS for the third time now over a deal you would have said yes to only 3 years ago. You are playing with LIVES because you don't like somebody #DACADemBetrayal
@RashidaTlaib @shaunking On what exactly? Do you not know the boundries of the very little power you have? #Civics101
@PattyMurray Boo f@cking hoo, You have betrayed DACA/TPS for the third time now. You're over here talking about paychecks and when there are actual LIVES at stake.  Get over your pride and vote yes already!! #DACADemBetrayal
@AOC Somebody want to clue these Dr's in on Ringworm being a fungal infection......
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @jessicadean Nobody has the right to serve in the military no matter if your gay, straight, male, female, whatever.  It's not a good idea to have a class of people who attempt suicide at a 40+% rate join a career field that has 22 suicides a day
@TheDemocrats Or you could just make better choices when it comes to unprotected sex and stop killing babies..........
@jackhealyNYT @nytimes Boo f@cking hoo, you're sitting here talking about a lady missing a couple paychecks (while holding another job), and ignoring the lives of over a million DACA/TPS recipients being betrayed for the third time on a bill that would have been passed 3 years ago
@JordynPhelps @SpeakerPelosi is going to betray all of you just like she has DACA/TPS members over and over again
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @ChrisVanHollen It's probably because Dems don't negotiate in good faith if I were to take a guess.  You can only trick somebody so much before they stop believing your bullsh!t.  Nobody on the other side believes you're going to bring it up later, and with good reason
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Listen up and listen good @SenSchumer , we see you trading the lives of DACA/TPS for the paychecks of a few on a bill you would have said yes on 3 years ago. We will not forget it either.  This isn't the first time you've committed this betrayal.  Get over your pride and vote yes
@brianschatz Then vote yes and stop trading the lives of DACA/TPS for the paychecks of a few on a bill you hypocrites would have voted yes on just 3 years ago.  Get over your pride white boy
@shaunking Are you going to pretend to be Hispanic now?
@SenBlumenthal That's hilarious from the party that is trading the lives of DACA/TPS for the paychecks of a few on a bill that Dems would have voted yes on only 3 years ago.  I'd say get your priorities in order but I guess they didn't teach you how in #stolenvalor Basic Training
@CNN It's clear that Dems are trading the lives of DACA/TPS for the paychecks of a few over a bill that they would have voted yes on just 3 years ago.....
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @RepAdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff  Intelligence Committee is an oxymoron
@FCBojangles @politico @AOC I didn't know DD joined CNN?	https://t.co/YwzEag4U0U
@iDrifter @ABC @AOC Right, because people are fleeing the US in search of a better life..........
@TheDemocrats Serving in the military is not a right for anyone gay, straight, male, female, whatever.  A class of people who commit suicide at a staggering 40+% rate probably shouldn't be in a career field that suffers 22 suicides a day.
@Patrici70824831 @JfTennessee @SenSherrodBrown Veteran*
@kaitlancollins That WH press shop hands you and @Acosta your a$$ on a daily basis because of comments like this. Is this really all you have, that he misheard a name? Pathetic.
@PattyMurray or just stop being stupid with your unprotected sex choices and stop killing babies......?
@KamalaHarris It's not YOUR body that people are concerned about here
@ewarren Did you tell them you planned on taking even more of their money by raising taxes?
@iDrifter @ABC @AOC Europe probably isn't the best example for your point since France is burning, England has ruptured, Sweden is drowning, and Denmark says "stop calling us Socialist, we aren't". Trudeau won't be able to distract with his costumes for much longer either
@SenJeffMerkley Funny, considering you guys voted for what was offered just 3 years ago, what changed? Vote yes to the deal presented, DACA/TPS is worth every penny, damn your pride!! This is the 3rd betrayal, keep your fake platitudes come next Election Day, your actions here will speak volumes
@MarkWarner Then vote yes for the deal presented. DACA/TPS is worth every penny, damn your pride
@FCBojangles @politico Okay I'll say this slower, the DNC, as in the Democratic National Party pulled it's sponsorship over anti-Semitic rhetoric from the leaders of the march. Did all of their members stay away? Nope, @AOC jumped right on that Hitler train, but she is a socialist so par for the course
@nytimes "typically", how did you miss that? How is it you still don't understand what layered security is? Why do you continually act like you know more than the people who work the border? If an a/c mech told you a plane was unsafe to fly, would you mock them and get on the plane?
@SenFeinstein @PostOpinions That's funny coming from the people who are betraying DACA/TPS for something they voted for 3 years ago.....
@TheDemocrats Then vote yes on the 5.7B for 3 years of protection for DACA/TPS, you would have 3 ago you fucking hypocrites
@politico Because public sector and private sector are two different things........
@SenSherrodBrown Serving in the military is not a right for anybody, gay, straight, male, female, whatever. However, putting a class of people who commit suicide at a 40+% rate into a career that has 22 suicides a day probably isn't the best of ideas.
@FCBojangles @politico I see somebody conveniently ignoring Tamika Mallory's comments on Farrakhan. She's not the only one who made similar statements. I suggest looking why the DNC pulled out of the Women’s March.
@MarkWarner That's weird, considering it was @HouseDemocrats that voted to open agencies one at a time.........
They all want to pretend that Nathan Phillips didn't change his story after the full video came out too.  The sheer desperation by these people to justify their calls for violence against children is insanity https://t.co/49cbYXiUi5
@KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton spent $3B and got destroyed. People should save their money instead of giving it to politicians who are going to turn around and vote to raise taxes that steal even more from you anyway.
@ABC Ahh yes, the song of Socialism, too bad @AOC is tone def.......
@ABCPolitics We know this mortitian is full of crap. We know he was for a border obstruction 3 years ago. We know he can't negotiate in good fath. We know he abandonded DACA/TPS over pride. We know @SenSchumer he has zero substance behind his hollow words. Times up Chuck.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You voted for border obstructions 3 years ago, why the change? You abandoned DACA/TPS people? Your solutions are for "monitoring" not "securing". You've still yet to produce anything factual in weeks, your experts are as believable as your communications w/ the Secret Service
@TheDemocrats In other words, you know you're just wasting time and tax money in your stance against a concept you voted for just three years ago.  You have proven that you do not negotiate in good faith, why should anyone believe you will revisit the issue later?  DACA/TPS wants to know why
@FCBojangles @politico I see somebody missed the Dems bailing on the Womans March because of what I just mentioned.  Feel free to ask DWS about it.
@BillPascrell @HouseDemocrats That's hilarious coming from the party that calls the cops "racist murderers" on a regular basis.  Take your fake outrage and shove it
@MarkWarner The problem with negotiating with Democrats, is that you have proven time and time again that you do not negotiate in good faith.  Nobody believes you when you say you will bring up the issue of border security later.  Do it now
@politico I'd rather not, not because they're women, but because of their anti-Semitic and communistic stances
@TheDemocrats lmao, no we don't, we see you placing your pride over the legal status safety of DACA and TPS recipients. We also see your hypocrisy in voting for what Trump is asking for just three years ago. We also see your absolute ignorance in ignoring what the experts on the border say
@CNN @GloriaBorger I see it more of a giant hypocrite detector, i.e. who voted for it three years ago, but for some reason (T) now finds it immoral today.
@doppelgosling @CNN @GloriaBorger Well it's his specific authorization that made it happen.  Do you complain during movie credits when the Directors name is bigger than an extras?
@talons918 @ABC NPC can't follow logic, initiate Russian bot protocal while engaging followers = right progammed language
@talons918 @ABC Yes, because people like you haven't been making death threats to those kids..............
@VVAmerica Yikes, this didn't age well. Hey @VVAmerica you stand with professional activists who approach, engage, and antagonizes kids? Then turns around and lies about it to media? Do you also stand by the death threats made towards children based on his lies?
@talons918 @ABC I think a grown man who approaches and engages a group of kids is sad. I think people who advocate for violence towards children is sad. I think people who have knee jerk reactions before having all the facts are sad. God helps those who help themselves, not cry victim
@talons918 @ABC Clearly you have perception problems, might I recommend a good Optometrist?  After your check up, please point out the right-wing media propaganda you're referring to.
@talons918 @ABC Here is reality, compare what you see to the statement made by Phillips about who approached (his first statement wasn't that he approached them) and engaged.   Take your own advice about narrative peddling https://t.co/849i7tnCsY
@talons918 @ABC I see you didn't learn the lesson the first time about not drawing a conclusion based on only the end of a video
@talons918 @ABC Oh no, they stayed back and said nothing racist to him, just danced to his beat that he put in their faces.  Absolutely horrible.
@SenateDems so are you going to ignore 1.4M undocumented peoples security within the country over half the distance of border obstruction that you approved just a few years ago?
@HouseDemocrats so are you going to ignore 1.4M undocumented peoples security within the country over half the distance of border obstruction that you approved just a few years ago?
@charliekirk11 This is what happens when you have a fully developed pair of balls, how transphobic, isn't that right mommy
@ABC The tolerant left, "He smiled at the adult who put a drum in his face, kill him!"
@KamalaHarris We have one that does that now, you're literally advocating for non citizens as we speak over the safety of citizens.  Do you live in opposite world?
@AndyOstroy the definition of a "woke" neutered wimp, brags about being blocked by people he hates but blocks middle aged housewives for simply disagreeing with him.  Stay strong kid, I hear there's kids going around smiling at people too, stay safe
@AndyOstroy You mean non threatening with a smile?  Oh the horror!
@beckemp @CBSNews How about you don't be a huge pussy and ovary the fuck up like a big girl and accept that there are other opinions other than your own.  Nobody gives a shit about how you feel about a tv station being played at a place you hold no power in.
@GOP Red state Dems are done in 2018.  It's pretty humorous watching Libs finally figure out what a deficit is and are even now turning around and calling to raise taxes.  More money staying with people and not going to the government is a good thing.
@CBSNews Sweet, here's a tip, if they didn't get permission to be here, it's time for them to go
@CNNPolitics Shocker, Dems don't do shit to help, even when it's what they want because "the evil racist people" offered it..........
@nytimes Accused is the new guilty, who needs proof when you have the court of liberal opinion
@FoxNews How many times do you need to be told to go away
How does Venezuela and North Korea fit into #NoMuslimBanEver ?
@MSNBC Noballs Chris Matthews makes bold prediction that will just turn out to be a Maddow sized nothing burger......................again.
@TuckerCarlson @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How about they just apply the law equally no matter what your political affiliation is.  Is that to much to ask for?  The IC and law enforcement communities should always be unbiased in their practices, not this shit show.
@ABC @GStephanopoulos They gave Clinton staffers immunity, and there was actual evidence of wrong doing in that scenario.  How did that turn out?
@FoxNews Mob mentality is strong with these comments
@MSNBC Are we back to it being men's fault she lost again?
@politico Letting people keep more of their money, good reason.
@MSNBC This is why the public doesn't trust you.  It's 100% legal for incoming administrations to meet with foreign dignitaries after the election.  Flynn lied about that meeting which is why he was fired and charged, but that's not the picture you want to paint
@millennialkyle @nytpolitics Oh I see, it's reality that you have a problem with, got it
@millennialkyle @nytpolitics Yes, the guy who literally invented the theory is wrong.........you seem like the exact type of person Karl was looking for to buy into his ideals of government run slavery
@millennialkyle @nytpolitics Socialism - In Marxist theory (the founding of the idea), is a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of communism.
@MSNBC It's like you idiots forgot why Flynn was fired.......
@nytpolitics Shocker, Socialists against people keeping more of their money........
@CNN If you knew Clinton was stealing the DNC nomination why not act sooner?
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Well he's right you know.......
@politico Mommy said it's okay to lie if you're trying to destroy people who think differently from you, isn't that right mommy!
@SenFranken You're a socialist, you support tax increases to make Minnesota families more dependent upon you.  I support sexual predators who assault sleeping females resigning from the US Senate.
@GOP Mommy said it's okay to lie and destroy peoples lives if they don't think the same way we do, isn't that right mommy?
@MSNBC Clinton lawyers, FBI agents who were demoted for not being unbiased in their investigations, and mole hunts for those who leaked about that tarmac meeting.......seems on the up and up to me.....
@ABC You zealots are going to go to far one day.  You'll be lucky if you don't get sued by what your reporting did to the stock market
@DonnaNeubig @CNN Facts* you mean like listing herself as a "minority" on a legal directory reviewed by deans and hiring committees?  Like being considered a "minority hire" by Harvard?  Those are actual facts, no matter how much you spin it.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Letting people keep more of their income is brainless, but believing the government can run healthcare isn't...................
@PattyMurray @SenateDems Odd, because we're watching the standard deduction get doubled.  How does that not help low and middle income families again??
@realDonaldTrump So why are these agents still employed?
@realDonaldTrump Why are any agents who handled that situation (plus the tarmac incident) still employed?
@tranceobs "We have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it" - @NancyPelosi
@MSNBC Isn't that what Socialists want?
@nytimes The same Dems that wouldn't even let anyone see the Obamacare bill?  Your fake outrage reeks of desperation............
@StaceyDizzy @nytimes @GOP Are you adding itemized deductions to the standard deduction?  You've never done your taxes before have you......
@ABC At least he's finally talking about something he's an expert in
@CNN LMAO, so his father hid his ethnicity out of fear during WWII (like many families did) and that's the same as using a fake minority status to get a job?  You know EW more than likely got that job over an actual NA right?  This is what desperation looks like
@alfranken Real men accept the consequences of their actions.  Why haven't you resigned yet?
@nytimes So when the lower and middle classes have more money in their pockets from the doubled standard deductions, how do you guys plan on spinning that?
How are all of these people voting on taxes with no idea what a standard deduction does?
@SenWarren You seem to forget all of those people voted for Clinton........the only people destroying the country are Socialists like yourself.  You must have done a rain dance, because there's a storm of your tears flowing.
@SenWarren @SenateGOP LMAO, of course you can't make it about economics, you don't know anything about that.  It's why you refuse to explain how doubling the standard deduction somehow benefits the rich????
@Sen_JoeManchin How does doubling the standard deduction hurt WV families?
@KamalaHarris How did the Obamacare vote go again.......?
