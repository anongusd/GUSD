#DebatesKE My @UKenyatta &amp; @HonRailaOdinga Allow Kenyans watch the game. Absconding a match isn't a gesture of sportsmanship; its cowardice

@SilantoiSuzanne You deserve it and I hope and pray that people of Nairobi see what we all saw you in you. There is need for leadership blood transfusion
@OleItumbi This is not being advertised for the first time. Maybe you'd have talked of "Without Confirmation".

Kenya will be peaceful. We embrace the political heat but we must remember that on 9th August 2017 we will still be Kenyans living in Kenya.
