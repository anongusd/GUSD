I'm frustrated with the Democratic Congress and am feeling quite despondent.  I hate that they're not going after tRump and his enablers, but are instead walking on eggshells.  The entire world knows that tRump has to go.  Why aren't they stopping him before more damage is done?
@carrickdbCA Contact your local Democratic party and adv around.  You should be able to either Google it or find someone on Facebook.  I did that in my state and became part of a large group that let us get to know the political leaders in our state.   Don't be shy and show confidence.
When I read about the neo-Nazi sympathisers and people (like tRump) who happily destroy the planet and take away civil rights, I find myself becoming furious.  Is it wrong to feel hatred against those who hate others?  Does that even make sense?
Our nation was created as a place to find freedom from tyranny and it as a nation of laws.  Trump is a tyrant who is now bragging about how he and the GOP are undoing the very civil rights that thousands of Americans died for.  He's the embodiment of evil. https://t.co/EzZMmxxvC1

@Ironhorse76 Thor was shot and left at a lake to die when he was only 2 lbs.  Coco was used for breeding and had a collar on so tight that her skin grew around it.  Chanel had been kept in a cage for almost 2 yrs.  Horrible abuse from inhumane people.		I'm so lucky to have them in my life.

@BerniceKing My parents were racist. They believed the bible condoned slavery and called Dr King a 'rabble rouser'.  Thanks to education, I didn't end up with the same mindset.  We have to change the focus of education to open more minds and hearts in order to end the hatred and inequality.
@Bmpalm9 @BerniceKing @shaunking I think a key to peace and equality is teaching about Dr King and others in school because, like you, students remember what they learn and it affects their mindset later in life.  If we only teach about rich white men, we do an injustice to children.
@goodlibrarian @BerniceKing Dr King warned us about 'right to  work' laws before they became popular and he was correct.		"In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false slogans, such as 'right to work.' It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights."
@BerniceKing In the Letter from Birmingham Jail, he sounded disappointed, but instead of becoming despondent, he continued on.  When they burned a cross on his lawn and the FBI stalked him, he continued on.  He gave his life for others and the challenges they face daily.  We must continue on.

@mikesackz @RealCandaceO I've actually been told that...more than once.  My work's always been in the masculine fields.

@LindseyGrahamSC Let's be honest.  Trump doesn't care squat about America.  He didn't get his military parade in homage to himself, so he wants to build a wall in honor of his perceived greatness.  It's an ego thing and has nothing to do with safety.
@celset2 @Goss30Goss @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump People who live around the border are already angry.  In fact, governors of the border states don't support tRump's monument to himself.
@MorningDawn3060 @Goss30Goss @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump As for saying that there's some sort of emergency at the border, there's not.  In fact, the number of people applying for asylum or entering illegally has gone down the last few years.  You're being lied to.  Try talking to someone like me who knows what's going on. https://t.co/lMTD54eqjW
@MorningDawn3060 @Goss30Goss @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump There is no emergency at the border.  The law, which I have a degree in, states that in order to get asylum, a person has to show themselves at the border and apply.  These caravans have been happening for years and it's totally legal.  The courts decide who is admitted.
@MorningDawn3060 @Goss30Goss @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Most terrorists come by plane and tRump's government shutdown is putting our nation in danger by causing TSA workers to quit or call in sick because they can't afford to pay babysitters or transportation fees.
@MorningDawn3060 @Goss30Goss @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Dawn, from someone who's been to the border and worked with law enforcement several years:	Democrats are willing to pay for border security, but walls are archaic.  They don't work.  Dems have offered to pay for high tech surveillance, which is much better and costs less.
@1VoteAtATime @UROCKlive1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I've worked with ICE, Border Patrol, Texas Rangers, etc doing drug interdictions.  Your information is incorrect.

@TatTat61010580 @TJF588 @MoveCold @TerenceHampton Because they're not imaging taxes on money they got in other ways and haven't for decades.  You and I are paying their taxes, essentially.
@WattersBre @jeffbauerjr @AOC Breanna, the wealthy don't pay taxes on the majority of their income which comes from investments, overseas accounts, etc.  As far as we know, tRump hasn't played taxes in almost 2 decades, if not longer.

@HungryTrucker @daisydancedream @realDonaldTrump Statistically, liberals have higher IQs and more education than conservatives.  As for being paid to give opinions, that's a ridiculous piece of propaganda.  Trump paid people to come to his rallies and stand behind him.  Democrats didn't have to.

If every nation chose to use only renewable energy, transportation and other overhead costs could lower exponentially.  The prices of products would be less because production and shipping would be cheaper.
If all vehicles were electric and electricity was free through all homes having solar panels and small electric windmills, imagine how much money would be saved yearly from the costs of home utilities and fuel for vehicles?  Even the prices of food and other products would drop.

@pwt4_43 @coleyworld @Bornabrit1 I have found that tRumpsters are proud of their ignorance and hatred, but they don't believe you deserve equal time to express your views.

@Bornabrit1 My daughter and I are no longer in contact with my son and his family.  He became an avid tRumpster, with a lack of compassion and a racist bent.  This is not the child that I raised.  He's become tough with his employees and seems to only care about money.  It's heartbreaking.

@vo_asshekh As a police dispatcher, the men treated me as eye candy until a rape happened to a friend.  By the time they arrived, I had blocked the crime scene off, gotten a list of possible witnesses, ridden in the ambulance with the victim, etc.  They asked me to be an officer after that.
@vo_asshekh I was told that I didn't need to know about cars or how to drive a stick.  After burning an engine, I bought a repair manual and began working on my own car.  I bought a stick and taught myself how to drive it, then became an over the road trucker.
@tngsmama @vo_asshekh I had doctors who said I had no disability, even tho I couldn't walk.  This one ran tests and found severe spinal damage, no cartilage in the knees, diabetes, low thyroid level, fibromyalgia, hypertension, sleep apnea, restless leg, TMJ, etc.  He cared about his patient.
@tngsmama @vo_asshekh It took me 20 years to find a doctor who would listen and help me.  I was in a wheelchair full time before I found him.  Now I know from testing and specialist referrals that with about 3 more surgeries and strong medications, I'll have a more productive life.   He's wonderful!
@vo_asshekh @BatmanResist My grandson was thought to be gay as a child because he liked girl things like his sister and was effeminate.  He's now a tough Marine and his girlie little sister is gay.  We shouldn't make these choices for them.  They'd be miserable living a life they didn't choose.
@vo_asshekh @KidCasteel During my life, I've been in the military, law enforcement, NYC cabbie, and an over the road trucker.  I've had to put up with sexual harassment and even a trucker trying to run me off the road after he yelled over the CB that women belong at home in the kitchen.

@Nancyanntaylor2 @Zebop @CharlesMBlow @Deoliver47 @washingtonpost I'm sorry, but I can't click on the heart.  I'm just so sorry for Kashoggi's family right now.  They must feel abandoned and hated by this administration.  They can't return to Saudi Arabia and their new home has turned on them.  It's horrific.

@Ih8tvvitter1 @ricfink @JZarif That's beginning to change.  Conservatives are being pushed out of government by Progressives.  This midterm election broke all time records.  We now will have a new House of Representatives.
@Ron56251304 @ricfink @JZarif We exercised our rights during the election this month.  Over 8 million Americans voted against tRump's regime and that broke an all-time record.  Starting in January, we have new people in Congress who will begin the process for change.

@JZarif Yes, tRump is an idiot.  Just stay patient.  Voters broke records this midterm election showing tRump and his cohorts that we don't support him.  He's also under investigation - possible facing ouster and prison time.  Some Americans are ignorant and/or corrupt, but not all of us

@davidkozin @MortuaryReport Speaking of withdrawal, when I changed doctors, that happened.  I googled and found a medication that helped and I had some leftover at home after changing meds.   It worked.  It's a blood pressure medication called Clonidine.  Keep it in mind to help patients withdraw safely.

@MortuaryReport Thank you so much for your articles!  I finally felt like someone understood.  I could tell you more, like how family deals with disabilities by measuring their aches and pains with yours or how people get frustrated when you ask for an accommodation, but you already know.  ♿💊
@MortuaryReport I had several tests this week.  The people doing xrays moved me around so much trying to figure out how to do them that I couldn't finish and was in tears.  I'm not a wuss.  Former military, law enforcement, and truck driver.  I was in bed for days....again.
@MortuaryReport Going to a store is challenging.  If they have motorized carts, I can switch over inside if staff helps.  I've learned to pull a cart and maneuver my manual chair, but it leaves me in pain for days afterwards.  Bad pain.  The kind where you wet yourself trying to stand up.
@MortuaryReport One specialist they sent me to had a ramp so steep that I got my wheelchair halfway and then began rolling backwards into a car that was backing out.  The waiting room had no empty spaces to wait.  I sat in a hallway with everyone squeezing by.  I didn't return.

tRump's caravan conspiracy theories are going to lead to a deadly situation.  Residents of the area don't want them there and the Border Patrol and Nat'l Guard have been warned that these groups steal weapons and government supplies.  They also tend to shoot with no provication.
@normangoldman @DavidCornDC They do it differently in Oklahoma County.  There's early voting and a special area for the disabled.  I've never stood in a line.
@WheelsofDJP @cccharley2 @boyndog @DavidCornDC Call your county voter registration office and ask if they have special accommodations for disabled voters.  For instance, in Oklahoma City the disabled can drive to a separate area and stay in their cars.  Workers bring the ballots out and come back later to take them inside.

When you can't afford bacon anymore or it's too hard to find, blame tRump.  It's his trade war that's going to hurt you the most.  This won't just affect bacon.  Crops are literally rotting in fields because of ICE raids on farm workers. 	 https://t.co/OEcE2Gp2eE
Didn't I tell you this would happen?  		"Unless companies can raise prices fast enough to keep up with the rising costs of hiring and materials, stocks may struggle to maintain current valuations." https://t.co/0IUIPsbtWj
tRump's policies are harming businesses BIGLY. 		 "Steel and aluminum tariffs have cost Ford Motor Co about $1 billion in profits, its chief executive officer said last month."

@AmericaWoke1 @brianbeutler @TheCorollary @RealCandaceO That could be one reason the FBI worked so quick on this.  Another is that it's shocking that 2 ex-Presidents, an ex-Vice President, ex-Secretary of State, members of Congress, and other important people were targeted.  The entire world is freaking out about this.  tRump isn't.
@FreeThinker226 @Flailmorpho_ @brianbeutler @MadRedHattie @RealCandaceO Speaking of bombing things, Ann Coulter is advising tRump to invade Mexico.  What do you think of that?
@restaurant_mom @brianbeutler @HoarseWisperer @RealCandaceO @LouDobbs It's groupthink and mass hysteria caused by propaganda, religious extremism, and fearmongering.
@brianbeutler @MSignorile @RealCandaceO I looked at her page and this woman is living in an alternative universe. These people are dangerous.  Ann Coulter is actually advising tRump to invade Mexico.  He's stupid enough to try, I think.
@BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO Wrong!  I know a lot of very active black democrats.  What about Connie Johnson from Oklahoma who served about 30 years in the state senate and ran for governor this year?  She's a wonderful black woman who helps others and who would say you don't know what you're talking about.

@gertch13 @MSignorile @HuffPost Do you realize that the Pledge of Allegiance was written by a Democratic Socialist?  It made no mention of god either.  Your fears are unfounded and based on propaganda and fearmongering from conservative news and politicians who care more about money and power than our nation.
@DesertThinker66 @gertch13 @MSignorile @HuffPost David, from your comment I thought you were a MAGA.  I went to your page to see if you were a troll and was shocked.  I don't understand how a liberal can tell someone to speak English or leave the country.  It's not what we stand for.
@gertch13 @ScarletM1926 @MSignorile @HuffPost Yes, there evidence.  Law enforcement on the local and federal level discovered evidence.  Apparently, the MAGA licked the stamps and left DNA.  He's a tRump lover just like you who refused to believe the truth over fantasies and he'll now due in prison.  Don't be stupid.
Ann Coulter said that tRump should order the military to invade Mexico.  This is the type of rhetoric and stupidity that we see coming from conservatives who have accused Mexicans of wanting to invade America.   It's completely nonsensical and abhorrent.	https://t.co/Qq1nt1kMNH
Obama, one of the many victims in the attempted bombings, spoke out against the lack of civility in American government and without using names, blasted tRump for blaming the media.  "It is wrong!" He said we need strong leaders right now to stop this.	https://t.co/8RQ93DF4iH
