More questions about #TheBigOne answered here ‚Äî and if you have more to ask, send them our way! https://t.co/lbLNPil1rt
How much glass will fall from skyscraper windows when a quake hits?		It depends on the skyscraper and the earthquake, but this is a big concern. People can be seriously injured or killed by giant pieces of falling glass. That's one reason not to run outside when shaking starts.
Is a car a safe place to be when an earthquake hits?		It depends on where the car is. If it's in the middle of a cluster of unsafe buildings, it may be good to be somewhere else. If a quake hits, you can slow down, assuming it's safe to do so. More here: https://t.co/lbLNPil1rt
Should I have landline phone service, not just cell?		Landlines can be more reliable after an earthquake than cell phones, as cell networks could be overwhelmed or disrupted. If you're get one, make sure it's not voice over IP, which utilizes the internet to connect calls.
How much cash should I have on hand?		You should have cash, since you don't know how long payment systems/ATMs will be inaccessible. Think about your expected weekly costs, and pull out however much will keep you comfortable if you can't get money for a bit after the quake.
How much should I have?		@jacobmargolis says he's aiming for 3 weeks worth of supplies, because even though emergency water and food stations will be set up across SoCal, it's likely there'll be long lines.
What should people have on hand in case of an earthquake?		At the most basic you need: water, food, first aid/medicine and shelter. We've touted FEMA's checklist here: https://t.co/mudKClUaKc

6) And SoCal's local news landscape saw some monumental shifts this year. The LA Times and San Diego Union-Tribune left Tronc's fold and returned to local ownership. Meanwhile, other local outlets had their newsrooms gutted, like SoCal News Group‚Äîor stopped the presses for good.
Our analysis found that in recent years the LASD has played an outsized role in sexual misconduct legal cases involving the county's massive workforce. We looked more closely at those cases: https://t.co/EGRpfHSRit

@TheRealJohnHCox .@GavinNewsom: Kavanaugh is going to play an outsized role in issues affecting California, from reproductive rights to private property rights. "For all those reasons, I opposed his nomination, and I think it was a sad day when he got sworn in."
.@TheRealJohnHCox: "I regret the divisiveness in politics today. If I have anything to say about it, I'm gonna try to get reforms that reduce the divisiveness, I think a lot of it has to do with fundraising."

Q: If there were a downturn, where would the money come from to fix the roads?		@TheRealJohnHCox: "We've gotta audit every agency and root out the waste in this budget. And believe me, there's a lot of it." #CaGovDebate
Newsom: "San Jose, SF and LA have the worst road conditions in the country. What John just argued for is to make things worse. 27 other states since 2013 have increased their sales tax or gas taxes in an effort to improve their roads, he chooses not to do that." #CAGovDebate

Newsom says was much work done by the legislature to get those bills through. "It's about transparency and it's about trust." #CaGovDebate
Cox says those bills could encourage a "fishing expedition for trial lawyers." #CaGovDebate
Q: Gov. Brown recently signed bills to allow more access to police records and body camera video. Would you have signed those same bills?		No, says Cox. "I favor transparency but I think we have to work more with law enforcement and give them the tools for particular situations"
.@TheRealJohnHCox is asked about his previous opposition to same-sex marriage. 		"I've evolved on those issues, just like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton," he says. #CAGovDebate
Q for @GavinNewsom: You've had a series of public spats with public officials. What does that say about your ability to get along with people you need to get along with?		Newsom: "I'm interested in change. Changing the order of things is difficult." #CaGovDebate

In previous elections, an average of 85 to 90 percent of provisional ballots were found to be valid and counted, according to @LACountyRRCC.
Answer: Yes and yes! You can request a provisional ballot, which *WILL* be counted once your registration is verified. It takes up to 30 days for that to happen.
Question: My name got left off the voting rolls at my polling place. Can I still vote and will my vote be counted?

Over the last 7 midterm primary elections, statewide voter turnout hasn't topped 50%. And turnout has often been far worse in LA County, hitting a low of 17% in 2014. 		How has turnout been in your county over the years? See the charts here: https://t.co/SJ1yMEffBH

If your vote by mail ballot has an error, contact your local elections office and ask for a replacement.		You can also show up on June 5 to cast a provisional ballot at any polling location in the county where you're registered.
The online voter registration deadline for the primary was May 21. But if you missed the deadline, you can conditionally register and cast a provisional ballot on election day if you go to your county's election headquarters. https://t.co/JbANdICGLs
There are 27 candidates running for governor and 32 candidates running for CA's U.S. Senate seat. 		Be sure not to "overvote." If you select more than 1 candidate per race, your vote for that contest won't count. If you make this mistake, contact your county election officials.
If you‚Äôre voting by mail, your ballot counts just as much as someone voting in person. In CA, all eligible mail ballots are tallied regardless of whether the races are close contests (and even though it sometimes takes weeks for election officials to count them all).
If you're voting by mail, don't forget the postage. 		In LA County, use one first-class stamp for the primary election. In Orange County, you'll need 71 cents in postage. Two first-class stamps will more than cover it.
The primary election is tomorrow, June 5. 		Here are a couple of last-minute voting reminders, from the questions that @maryplummer has been answering all election season. üëáhttps://t.co/D5ScWlA8NN

Chronic pain often requires multiple treatment approaches. Romero uses exercise, heat, ice, acetaminophen and stretching‚Äîand is looking at talk therapy.		People with chronic pain may experience anger and depression along with their pain. Psychotherapy can help them cope.

One method Romero uses to treat her chronic pain is exercise. While you might not feel like working out when you‚Äôre in pain, a number of studies support its therapeutic value. 		The CDC and the NIH both endorse exercise as a way to deal with pain.

This can mean disparities in chronic pain care. https://t.co/dRZgCwQnCh
People can also be denied pain medication because of racial and ethnic discrimination.
Why is this? One theory: When doctors aren‚Äôt of the same background as their patients, cultural misunderstandings can arise regarding how the patients are experiencing their pain. Language barriers can exacerbate this.
There may also be more troubling reasons.		Experts point to research that has found doctors are less likely to prescribe pain medication to Latinos and African-Americans.
Research shows people from different cultures handle chronic pain in different ways. For example, some studies have found Latinos are more likely to show stoicism when facing chronic pain, and are more likely to seek out a religious advisor before going to a doctor.
Latinos and Asian-Americans are both less likely to take pain pills. Latinos and African-Americans are also less likely to be prescribed opioids. https://t.co/J00ofsk0Sj

The CDC and California Department of Public Health say that doctors should work with long-term opioid users to safely decrease their dosages and help get treatment for those who have developed addictions.
For some patients, the consequences of being cut off from opioids can be extreme.		There are reports of some patients seeking out heroin or other illicit drugs as a substitute. Other reports suggest patients have committed suicide after being cut off from opioids.
Chronic pain sufferers are among those who feel stranded.		Many chronic pain patients are middle-aged and older adults, who are among the highest users of prescription opioids. https://t.co/0OJM6ljPb8
Some in the medical community say doctors are cutting back *too much* on opioid prescriptions in the effort to curb the overdose death rate.		Some doctors have renounced opioids completely ‚Äî meaning that patients who have become dependent on the drugs are suddenly cut off.
In recent years, opioid prescriptions have been cut dramatically ‚Äî but opioid overdose deaths are still on the rise. https://t.co/qQcrfjC2Y3
THREAD:		The national opioid epidemic has evolved rapidly in recent years‚Äîfrom prescription pill abuse to heroin and now fentanyl and other powerful synthetic opioids.		Doctors have been restricting opioid prescriptions to prevent abuse. But are some patients being left behind?

As LA's homeless population continues to grow, the city and county of LA are both pouring millions of dollars into rapidly building more temporary housing like shelters.		But the question of quality control for new and existing shelters is still one to keep an eye on.
The LA Homeless Services Authority says it's pushing shelters harder to improve quality. It's sending staffers to visit shelters more often, and trying to make it easier to find open beds.		But ultimately, even when bad conditions are reported, LAHSA seldom cracks down. https://t.co/cgVjMNrOoM
Also, the reality is that money from the government isn‚Äôt even enough to fully run these facilities. 		Many use philanthropic funds to make up the difference in staff and facilities costs. Others may want to up their standards‚Äîbut don‚Äôt have the resources or expertise to do so.
This decentralized system makes things confusing and frustrating for shelters. Multiple monitoring agencies, but no single authority setting the standard. https://t.co/HXSieBK2JX
Who's responsible for the safety and sanitation of LA's homeless shelters?		LA County has ~16,600 shelter beds. Most are run by private nonprofit and faith orgs. Some are contracted with federal, local and state government agencies.		There's no single public entity in charge.
These accounts help explain why reviews conducted at 60 shelters paid for by the LA Homeless Services Authority last year found more than half‚Äî33‚Äîwere not filling all their beds.		Overall, these shelters had a 78% utilization rate‚Äîwell below the 90% required by their contracts.
In one shelter run by LA Family Housing, a client filled out a survey with pretty good reviews about conditions. But buried in the comments section, they wrote that it "feels like a jail" ‚Äî and that someone had been stabbed there. https://t.co/AAfbn6PKtL https://t.co/HACSmDrbX1
Many homeless people told KPCC they were victims of theft, harassment and even assault by other clients in shelters.	 	‚ÄúThe shelters are dangerous as heck,‚Äù said Pepper Pilar. ‚ÄúAt least out here I have friends to watch my back. In there, they [will steal] your stuff.‚Äù https://t.co/TwdLS1zDVW
A 2017 public health inspection of House of Hope did not find bedbugs. But it did find 17 other health code violations, including evidence of rats, roaches, suspected mold and issues with waste storage and disposal.
We talked to several homeless people who said they'd rather take chances outside than in a shelter.		Craig Aslin it "sucked" when he lived in House of Hope in South LA: "I got [eaten] up with bedbugs."		Now he lives in a tent off Franklin and Vine‚Äîand says he lives better there. https://t.co/nKYKX1ED1z
Some of these shelters are funded with taxpayer dollars. But negative monitoring reports and health citations rarely, if ever, result in a shelter being shut down.	 	Others that don't use public funds have even less public accountability.
For starters, let's look closer at some of these shelters.	 	KPCC looked through dozens of public documents on shelter conditions and found reports of:	- bedbugs	- foul odors	- rats	- poor lighting	- harassment	- lax medical care	- contraband baby chickens (yes, really)
THREAD: 		Everyone agrees that homelessness in LA is at crisis levels.	 	Some 43,000 people spend each night on the street, in a tent, car or makeshift structure.	 	And yet, thousands of LA's homeless shelter beds sit empty every night.	 	Why?

OK, so there are way more than just 5 reasons that explain why housing costs have shot up so much. But the bottom line is: The task of making California affordable again ‚Äî or at least relatively affordable again ‚Äî defies a simple silver-bullet solution.
It's not just land though. Construction labor and the cost of raw materials are higher in CA, and are on the rise. 		There's a shortage of skilled construction workers left from the housing market crash of the late 2000s. Those workers haven't come back. https://t.co/tT7hOVQEOs
5) Land, labor and raw material costs are higher in CA than the rest of the country. 		The coastline topography makes it more expensive to build here than most other places. Also, the ocean. You can‚Äôt expand into the ocean.		Limited land + tons of demand = sky-high prices.
4) In most parts of California, the process to approve new housing is difficult, time-consuming and expensive.		Typical approval time for projects in San Francisco is over a year. In LA it‚Äôs 8 months. Why the lag? Here's the laundry list... https://t.co/C7b999SdeA
There‚Äôs debate about just how much Prop 13 is to blame for the state‚Äôs housing shortage. But talk to local elected officials and you‚Äôll see the issue isn‚Äôt just a hypothetical dilemma.
3) Prop 13.		Prop 13 was a 1978 ballot initiative that capped how much local governments could collect from property taxes. It's made development decisions much more complicated.
Who owns those renter-occupied houses? The vast majority are ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù investors and wealthy individuals buying one or two additional properties. Foreign buyers, primarily from China, have also become increasingly enamored with California real estate.
More people = more competition for housing. And we're not just talking about apartment rentals. 		Here's a pretty amazing graph. The number of single family homes occupied by renters grew by more than 400,000 over the last 10 years. https://t.co/85E1fdyN9o
2) Demand for living, working and owning in urban California has reached a breaking point. And part of that demand is global. 		Here you can see over the last decade, Californians have increasingly tried to cram themselves into major urban centers already jammed with residents. https://t.co/0hABcmzgx2
We're also not keeping up with other states in terms of building housing. https://t.co/yekgxPPGSo
1) We haven't built enough housing.		California's housing department estimates we need to build 180,000 new housing units a year to keep prices stable.		Over the past 10 years, we‚Äôve averaged less than half of that. https://t.co/qfE2bDigYb
THREAD:		Newsflash: California housing is EXPENSIVE. Why?		At its most basic level, it's a story of supply and demand‚Äîtoo many people, not enough houses. But there are lots of uniquely California factors involved, too. 		Here are 5 big reasons the market got so out of whack:

Why was this site picked? Part of the reason may be that it's in unincorporated OC, and the supervisor who represents that area, Todd Spitzer, wasn't at the meeting when the decision was made.		Read more: https://t.co/zKHtwn7XC6 https://t.co/ixXQutAm40
And here's the new site the OC mayors proposed Thursday. It's on the former site of Silverado Elementary, a shuttered school in the foothills of Orange County, east of Irvine.		The area is remote ‚Äî maybe even more so than the other sites. https://t.co/bIzYlKgYiR

The Laguna Niguel site would have housed another 100 people. 		It's a former courthouse that closed in 2008. It's directly behind City Hall, and there are homes nearby across a large field. https://t.co/jSsQNEtz2o
Irvine's mayor, Donald Wagner, had said chemical contamination and a lack of infrastructure make it a poor choice for a shelter. "It is not a place fit for human habitation," he told the OC Board of Supervisors in March.
Here's what's on the Irvine site now: An empty field near a freeway, with lots of construction equipment around and a chain link fence dividing it from a soccer field. The closest homes are in a gated community with an 8-foot wall. https://t.co/Sonkq4hMMV
How does the proposed new site compare to the 3 rejected ones? Let's take a photo tour. 		Here's the rejected site in Irvine. The plan was to put a shelter somewhere on a 100-acre plot of county land south of the Great Park. It would have housed 200 people. https://t.co/ie6XKy2LX1

But LAUSD says PUC Schools should have detected this earlier. They've been hounding PUC with serious questions that could have serious consequences for the schools.		Read the full story here: https://t.co/l4bRhxAmDN
The forms align with PUC's argument that they had no way of knowing his ties to Better 4 You.
Here's the $285,000 question we're asking now. 		Should Rodriguez's alleged missteps have raised red flags? If so, should LAUSD or PUC Schools have caught them? (And if not them, who?)
Rodriguez confirmed to KPCC that he did have a stake in Better 4 You Fundraising in Nov. 2014, but has declined to respond to multiple questions about the investment beyond that.
KPCC obtained the forms. 		The Better 4 You Fundraising investment is mentioned in the form filed to LAUSD ‚Äî but not to PUC Schools. https://t.co/ODPmXpoUdQ
Here's the thing: Rodriguez had invested in Better 4 You Fundraising. He disclosed that on a form he filed to LAUSD in 2014‚Äîa standard form public officials use to disclose financial holdings. 		A few months later, he filed the same form to PUC Schools. It told a different story.
Let's take a closer look at the allegations: 		Among the transactions mentioned in PUC Schools' complaint were 2 checks totaling $20,400 that he paid to Better 4 You Fundraising, a merchandise sales and fundraising consulting company. https://t.co/WO29E0X5qy
Rodriguez has denied any wrongdoing connected to PUC Schools' complaint. He remains on the LAUSD board.
In October, PUC Schools said they had evidence that Rodriguez might have been using charter school funds ‚Äî taxpayer funds ‚Äî for his personal benefit. 		They said Rodriguez had ties to two outside firms that received more than $285,000 in payments from PUC.
Here's the background: 		Ref Rodriguez ran for LAUSD school board in 2015. Before that, he had co-founded a a network of charter schools called PUC Schools ‚Äî Partnership to Uplift Communities.
