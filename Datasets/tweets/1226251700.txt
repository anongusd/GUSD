@Theytukerrrjobs @SenKamalaHarris You are correct, they are not accepting new applications. However, those who have been granted DACA prior to the injunction are eligible to all advanced parole as prior to the rescinding of DACA.
@Theytukerrrjobs @SenKamalaHarris I gave you a direct quote from the USCIS FAQ webpage. Not that hard to research. https://t.co/CHVXBApVWv
@Theytukerrrjobs @SenKamalaHarris Wrong. "Until further notice, and unless otherwise provided in this guidance, the DACA policy will be operated on the terms in place before it was rescinded on Sept. 5, 2017." - USCIS. This includes travel requests.

@MaggieB63399519 @Jazmine376 @GayRepublicSwag Your drug claim is a misconception. You only account for ‚Äúseized‚Äù drugs and fail to account for the substantial amount of drugs successfully transiting across the border and to their destinations undetected. USBP seized 400,000 lbs mj, plus fentanyl, cocaine, meth in FY18.
@MaggieB63399519 @Jazmine376 @GayRepublicSwag Wrong. First 2 mths FY19, Unaccompanied child apps = 10,265, up 44% over same time yr prior.  Family apps = 48,287 a 307% increase over yr prior. Total apps &gt; 102,000 in 2 months. Year end total for FY18 ~ 396,000.  At this rate FY19 will be &gt; 600,000, likely closer to 700,000.
@ehaaaaay @xxMichaelSexton @Newsweek Michael is correct. Walls don't stop immigration, only policy change and enforcement of law does. Fences/walls are an effective tool we use to deter, slow and assist in the apprehension of those willfully breaking the laws.

@Dyke67ny @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @GOP The GOP president who just put a justice in the Supreme Court, who supports gay marriage as the law of the land. Really dismantling...
@donnabrazile If you hate that he's there so much, you can thank yourself.
@SenSchumer All we'll see is that he's used whatever laws you and your colleagues have passed.
@SenSanders All should have access to education. Not everyone needs it. There's a difference. Why not reform failing primary education? Where do we rank
@SenSanders There's not one member of congress who  can't afford it.  Maybe we should pay you less to pay them more?
@SenSanders You've spent 25 years in Congress? Congratulations! You're responsible for this, so stop complaining. #youretheproblem
@jaketapper must be aggravating considering how often you all push the Putin/Russia narrative.
@NancyPelosi you've lied to us for years and you're still around. #youretheproblem
RT @Heritage: CBO predicted 23 million would have Obamacare plans by 2017. Only about 9 million actually do. https://t.co/PF2K3208cA
@NancyPelosi yes, please do tell us how it is worse than the failed Obamacare. Cause you have so much credibility.
@thehill orrrrr, it could just be that every president does the exact same thing, especially after a party changes power?
@NancyPelosi CNBC and Moodys report 298,000 jobs created in February, crushing the 190,000 projected. What have you done lately?
@DWStweets @SunSentinel because following the law is bad? Ridiculous. If you don't like the laws, then change them. #youretheproblem
@DrJillStein had prior administrations enforced our laws and stood firm, we wouldn't be in the extent of this situation.
@SenSanders haven't you been in congress for everyone of those years? #youretoblame
@SenSchumer really? The do your job and change the laws. #youretoblame #youretheproblem
@NancyPelosi you being in congress is a terror to our society. You've had the power to change the laws but failed to. #youretoblame
@KirstenPowers they're there to enforce the laws that CONGRESS passed. If you don't like it, then change the laws.
@NicoleAngeleen have you ever spoken in front of large groups? Easy to forget simple things. Especially considering she speaks 5 languages.
@HillaryClinton 306 - 232
@NancyPelosi Ms. Pelosi finally figured out who the president really is. She says same thing all the time, just inserts different name.
@DSenFloor He should have nothing to say. He's a nominee and judge. He follows the law, not your slanderous politics. Respect for Gorsuch.
@NancyPelosi coming from the lady who said we have to pass it to find out what's in it.
@SenSchumer do you work as hard on fixing things as you do trying to defend your party views on twitter?
@hilaryr @tedcruz wow, real logical reasoning. Solid evidence. Well done.
@SenSchumer hypocrisy at its finest. Voted and confirmed in 2006.
@jaketapper how about you talk about the man, not his mother.
@TheDemocrats Strange that he was confirmed to the court unanimously and now you speak out against him....
@CNNTonight @hilaryr @CNN the VA who spends 20 million on art work instead of healthcare???
@MSNBC @NBCNews which is amazing considering it's illegal to employ illegal immigrants.

@stuartpstevens @ABCPolitics sickening is not enforcing the law and supporting the constitution you swore to defend.
He's not the only one saying it, but then again it was with one of your CNN correspondents, so I don't expect you'll report on it. https://t.co/xTITy2sumi
@ByronYork nahhh, we'll place the blame where it belongs; with the biased media.
RT @JudicialWatch: RETWEET if you agree!	https://t.co/CHNvHLIuZB
@nytimes and I thought the biased media had already done that months ago. #trump2016 #prouddeplorable
@nytimes @nytopinion Yeah, @HillaryClinton has really connected with the people of this country.... well, at least with her elite donors
@HillaryClinton @POTUS because you're a great judge of character and honesty?
@HillaryClinton you're correct... we do have to do better. #Trump2016 #prouddeplorable

@kristilynnKLD @CassandraRules @BernPress @JaredWyand Clinton private beliefs gave us 20 years of DOMA. What more do we need to see?
@JaredWyand @daviddavid_nyc where is her list of judges? Who's to say she won't appoint anti-gay judges if she doesn't truly support view?
@dandrezner @soledadobrien Last I remember, people can work together, but have different opinions. No?
@DWStweets @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton- you have to work so hard because you support a failed candidate who is a corrupt politician
@HillaryClinton We're still waiting to see the emails that were deleted
@DWStweets @HillaryClinton Not that you would say any different being in Clinton's corner from the beginning....
@ericbolling Murders in the US rose 10.8% last year, the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971, according to data by the FBI.
@donlemon This is really what you choose to focus on? Can you report on a topic the public actually cares about?
@nancypelosi you and your idealism being a member of congress is a further threat to public health/safety.
