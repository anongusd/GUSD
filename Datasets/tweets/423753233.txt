God created us and so he is delighted. It negates the purpose of creation if he imposed condition on that after creation. 6/6
So I have to believe God delights in us because of what we are, not in what we believe or do. That's unconditional delight in Creation 5/6
...his delight in us is not based on our belief, but on the fact that he created us because he saw we were good then. 4/?
This is true for 2 reasons: 1) If God created us and saw that we are good and 2) he delights in what is good then... 3/?
First, if we are only delightful to God if we believe in him, then the lessons of the creation are inherently false. 2/?

@jamesmithsonian It's up in the air. Texas v US knocked down DAPA bc of lack of stat auth. SCOTUS hasn't spoken on DACA. I hope this turns out well though.
@jamesmithsonian It would be, but EOs only affect the Exec branch. So Sessions would have to censure himself essentially.
@jamesmithsonian It has the *technical* full force of law if it's rooted in statutory authority, but someone would have to enforce it. That's not happening.
@jamesmithsonian DACA isn't federal law though, it's an Exec. Order. He'd only be in trouble if Trump personally chose to penalize him.

Resisting heterosexual oppression begins with resisting the regulation of our bodies.

This all makes me think that being radical in the face of oppression is never a choice but something oppression forces us into.
Is this idealistic? Maybe. But no collective movement of resistance worked by joining in the oppression of other oppressed peoples.
And so if sexism is understood as the oppression of not just women, but also what is perceived as feminine, then GBT men must be a part too
Such a masculinity of course, in the gaze of hegemonic masculinity, is unachievable because we are seen as innately feminine.
This, I believe, must also include gay, bi and trans* men because sexism hurts us too. It creates an acceptable masculinity.
We must also realize that sexism does not just harm women. Sexism cannot be defeated unless it is countered intersectionally.
Sexism will never be defeated unless we deconstruct and rebuild the structures that most reify it. E.g., the modern presidency https://t.co/ujUCtZkiOM

Surmise this to say that I have no potential interest in knowing my roommate and after this lease is up it's "bye Felicia" for da bitch.
He also walked by me one day at the University, made eye contact and then walked by like he didn't know me.
Also, he plays video games and I have to listen to the same intro song EVERY NIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU IT IS POOR.
I've also never seen a grown man throw hissy fits like he does when the bathroom is occupied. Oh no she better don't. üôÉ
I gotta listen to his 'activities' regularly because of the wall we share, I've got some political capital to work with here.

Bears get caught in traps. Russia needs to watch its back if it continues this swaggering.
Example: Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk cannot become the next Sudetenland. Empty promises from eager despots cannot be enough.
While I respect Pres. Obama greatly, we need more than just more diplomacy. Russia needs to be shown that our diplomacy has a spine.
We must make Putin see that his USSR fever dream is just that: A delusion. He is a weak man. We must show him to the mirror.
I believe that Russia will only stop its support of Iran and Assad if it feels alone in the world. We must make them feel lonelier than ever
We must reinforce NATO in the Baltic, support pro-US Central Asian nations and peel away pro-Russia nations left after Cold War (Azer. etc)
We must isolate Russia in the world so Putin &amp; the Kremlin feel the impact of their decisions. Economic sanctions aren't enough.
#Russia interfering with our election is a direct violation of our sovereignty. A swift &amp; strong response is necessary.
