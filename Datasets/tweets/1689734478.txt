@MrBohBo Except that it's not relevant to my reasons for bringing the bill. I have a problem with this charge whether it's alone or part of a unit.
@MrBohBo Well the problem is the info provided was not disagregated. Also, believe it or not, I don't get Lexis or Westlaw access even as a member of judiciary.
@MrBohBo People in my family have needs, so I'm quite familiar. But I don't trivialize the stigma arbitrarily assigned to a few people. There's no reason for it. And yes, we have other bills dealing with the larger problem. We can do more than one thing at a time, believe it or not.
@MrBohBo This guy can't get a job now: https://t.co/uS5xzvjTF3
@MrBohBo So tell your friends not to tack it on. It appears in case search and stigmatizes/publicizes their mental health issues.
@MrBohBo Look in Lexis news search. There are periodic cases discussed every few years. But the charges are more frequent than makes news. But again, whether its solely charged is irrelevant. https://t.co/MttXux17yu
@MrBohBo I'm not sure why you're fixated on units of charges vs single charges. If it's part of a unit of charges, why is it necessary? And what is your interested in continuing to allow prosecutors to charge this? You can Lexis or Google old cases where its seemingly charged alone.

@JPeters_in_MD @tjzchouse @RichMadaleno The transit is also to service future growth and riders. That's why we concentrate dense new development near transit.

Also if any @mddems gubernatorial candidate wants a briefing on this bill, hmu, I'm happy to fill you on in what @larryhogan signed into law in #MDpolitics :)
@JPeters_in_MD @thekytikat @RedMaryland @LarryHogan Too bad that's not what happened. You seem to have a hard time believing @LarryHogan screwed Western MD ratepayers to give a utility company millions out of the pockets of ratepayers. And yet..... #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @thekytikat @RedMaryland @LarryHogan It's not one time. The hundreds of dollars are going to be added to the Western MD ratepayers on lots of their bills over an extended period of time (thanks to @LarryHogan). #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @thekytikat @RedMaryland @LarryHogan Okay, then ask GOP Delegates Grammer, McDonough, McMillan, Metzgar, Flanagan, Glass, &amp; Long why they voted against it. On the floor they said it was a new fee on Western MD ratepayers. #MDpolitics
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan It's not a rate increase. It is a new utility fee, signed into law by @larryhogan. #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @thekytikat @RedMaryland @LarryHogan Trust me on what the bill does. It adds hundreds to Western MD utility bills with no benefit to ratepayer. A bunch of GOP Delegates voted against it even though @larryhogan signed it into law. #MDpolitics
Dodge, dodge, dodge. Change subject, change working, dodge dodge dodge. Guys, you can admit you're for #trickledown economics. Take a deep breath. #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @thekytikat @RedMaryland @LarryHogan Except that's not what happened. Lol
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan Well if you want to change what you previously asked that's fine. It's still online at: https://t.co/a1iChfIDuM. You asked about utility fees. I answered. #MDpolitics
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan Now you're changing it to taxes. You said taxes and fees originally, and I answered your question.
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan You said: "You can reduce the FEES and taxes imposed on our utility bills." I showed you one example of new, increased utility fees that @LarryHogan supported in #MDpolitics
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan The bill lets Columbia gas add hundreds of dollars to the bills of Western MD ratepayers to cover toxic cleanup costs they're already required to do &amp; that have no benefit to the ratepayers. Just FYI #MDpolitics
@thekytikat @RedMaryland @JPeters_in_MD Actually I tried to stop the bill to raise utility rates on Western MD ratepayers. Oddly, it was supported by the Maryland GOP! @LarryHogan signed it into law: https://t.co/vJdnR7yAxI #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland Under the Senate bill, the reductions in personal income tax rates are temporary, ending in 2026. #MDpolitics
@thekytikat Well you're cherrypicking instead of looking at overall or effective tax burden. It's not accurate to cherrypick.
Okay, I gotta get to canvassing. One thing clear from this exchange. #Maryland GOP strongly supports this in #MDpolitics: "Those earning less than $40,000 a year would be worse off in 2025.... On flip side, those with higher incomes would enjoy tax breaks" https://t.co/YRU85tzPDU
@thekytikat Just clarifying your comment that they pay $0 taxes. Not true.
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland I said be honest. There's a lot more than that in there. #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland For how long? How many elements for ordinary folks in GOP tax scam expire in a few years? How many cuts for millionaires do not expires? Be honest. #MDpolitics
@thekytikat One of biggest misconceptions about the tax code is that many Americans do not pay taxes. 80 percent of American taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than in individual income taxes. #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland Well, links for one. #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland Links please. #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland Show me those GOP tax cuts for the working poor again? I must've missed that! lmao #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland What mandated spending are you referring to? You want us to cut education spending to give even more tax cuts to the wealthy? #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland That's vague. What bill are you even talking about? #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland I'm responding to @thekytikat not you
@thekytikat @RedMaryland The nonpartisan analysis of the GOP tax scam clearly states that EVEN factoring in economic growth, their plan adds $1 trillion to the national debt. They're mortgaging our future &amp; admitted its because their wealthy donors are demanding this. #MDpolitics

For example, you do know that Obamacare users are disproportionately from Western MD, Eastern Shore AND Baltimore right? #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland Or maybe anti-tax zealots are clueless about the impact of historic wealth &amp; income inequality on all working poor folks, rural or urban in #MDpolitics. Sounds about right.
@RedMaryland So farmers are the only people with estates? Come on now. #SmellTestFail in #MDpolitics. Y'all always trying to sentimentally invoke farmers when turfing for millionaires
@RedMaryland Funny how y'all never propose that tax cuts go to middle class when they're proposed for the wealthy in #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland I can't excuse Omalley support for estate tax cuts. But unlike you I'm not a partisan parrot in #MDpolitics
Or that time @larryhogan admin pushed a bill to give MGM and casinos $2 million a year out of our education trust fund this year? #MDpolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland Wow you are sorely misinformed #mdpolitics
Here's another one for ya. @larryhogan &amp; @mdreps say they protect utility ratepayers but then support a bill allowing Columbia Gas to increase rates on Western MD residents, to allow them to pass required toxic cleanup costs onto ratepayers in #MDpolitics.
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland @GregoryKline @mddems @LarryHogan @mdreps Just sayin yall talk a good game but dont deliver in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland @GregoryKline @mddems @LarryHogan @mdreps Lots of finger pointing, but no explanation for @LarryHogan's billions in new spending, while we face hundreds of millions in structural deficit AND y'all wanna make it worse to give millionaires more money in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland @GregoryKline @mddems @LarryHogan @mdreps We have an annual balanced budget requirement. You know very well that under @LarryHogan we are projecting deficits in future years in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland We are talking about people inheriting $5.49 million estates getting a tax cut in #MDpolitics. Nice try.
@GregoryKline @RedMaryland @mddems Are you guys in fantasyland? Your guy @larryhogan has proposed billions in new spending for a 2nd Bay Bridge, 16 new highway lanes on 495/295/270/95, a bullet train, and god knows what else. The @mdreps are big spenders and deficit creators in #MDpolitics
@GregoryKline @RedMaryland @mddems Please outline the $150 million a year in cuts you propose so that we can give heirs to $5.49 million estates a tax cut in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland @mddems But just as with the federal GOP tax scam, I guess you think deficits don't matter in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland @mddems Also "working people" implied estate tax cuts reward work or the working class. They don't. They reward intergenerational wealth transfer. #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland @mddems We have a balanced budget requirement in Maryland, so a $150 million/year loss is being paid for by everyone else to cover millionaires inheriting up to $5.49 million in #MDpolitics. Same dynamics as Congress' GOP tax scam.

@RedMaryland I think a letter that takes 5 min to write can be squeezed in. It's the contrarian debate from you that detracts. üòâ
@JPeters_in_MD @WCBM680 Let's have one about Arapaio's constitutional violations then
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland So you want to keep a divisive OFFICIAL state song, instead of having one we're all proud of (like Smith Island Cake). Or you're contrarian
@JPeters_in_MD @WCBM680 We are talking about what our state song should focus on. You are debating Lincoln's legacy. Nice dodge. Why should state song focus on that
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland But again, why do you think this should be the focus of the state song?
@JPeters_in_MD @WCBM680 Is this you having a problem of "they all look the same"? Good grief.
RT @mkorman: Mo Co Board of Elections is soliciting input on early voting sites for 2018: https://t.co/muXC6d3zF7 #MDPolitics
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland Better yet, why even have a state song that takes either side of the civil war? No song or a neutral one would be bwtter.
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland Nice dodge. You defend a state song that calls Lincoln a despot because of negative things he did. Question is why mention him at all?
@JPeters_in_MD @RedMaryland Uh so is that an argument for having a song that calls Lincoln a despot? How about no song at all? Or a unifying one.
@LaurieKellyMD Yeah, if we redo this, I'd suggest we don't need a song from the civil war era at all. Something unifying would be nice :)

Simple math for @LarryHogan = if you cut tolls that fund transportation, you have less money for it. Projects cut are his fault #MDpolitics

Noted. I'll remember to ignore the next time you whine about partisan politics. Ya'll support voters having no say. Done. #MDpolitics https://t.co/NKvRbRJbXQ
Hopefully not, and their effort at crass partisan hackery fails. https://t.co/2iXx2GAMJ6
If we end up stuck for next 30 yrs w/ voters getting no say in vacancies, u can point finger at @RedMaryland. Thx for nothing #MDpolitics
Or @DavidMoon2014 tries to give voters say in choosing reps &amp; wonders why @RedMaryland opposes. "Answer is obvious @LarryHogan." #MDpolitics https://t.co/DdszbwdUSm
Nobody told me to do anything. If you want to oppose voters choosing their reps, that's on you. Don't blame it on a boogeyman #MDpolitics https://t.co/Hf6CmhFXhd
Good luck ever getting any reforms passed then. If not through legislation you gonna do it through magic? https://t.co/HxQfhhM9es
What a joke. Ya'll are opposing voters choosing b/c of @LarryHogan. Your party chair (now appointed Delegate) also opposed it #MDpolitics https://t.co/x79MrWtNbX
That time the @mdreps Chair opposed special elections for Delegate. He's now been appointed Delegate #MDpolitics https://t.co/kHHYQ4kErs
That time I tried special elections for House/Senate w/ @Christian_Miele @TrentKittleman  @neilparrott #MDpolitics https://t.co/kHHYQ4kErs https://t.co/UdAc9p0quy
It's the motivation for YOUR opposition. I've always supported special elections, even for my race. The @mdreps oppposed that! #MDpolitics https://t.co/bT4IxxCbsD
Uh, I just got to the Assembly AFTER Omalley, thank you very much https://t.co/t8ZJbvqz44
So @LarryHogan, do you agree with @RedMaryland that voters should have no way in filling vacancies for AG &amp; Comptroller? #MDpolitics
"The answer is obvious: @LarryHogan." #MDpolitics https://t.co/pofMqDiw9D
Summary: @RedMaryland opposes letting voters choose AG &amp; Comptroller because @LarryHogan is Governor. SMH in #MDpolitics
Dont be shortsighted. We are taking appointment power away from every future Dem Governor too. Ya'll rarely win #MDpolitics https://t.co/SHtLkv6M7M

"We at @RedMaryland have always held opinion that more elections better but... Answer is obvious: @LarryHogan." Yup. #MDpolitics https://t.co/Hlhvp7tZ6R
I never want to hear complaint of partisanship in electionlaw from @RedMaryland again. Total double-standard when theres GOP Gov #MDpolitics https://t.co/UaUb9fKdG4
Surprising position from @RedMaryland folks who fought #MDpolitics redistricting to "protect voters." Turns out its just partisan politics https://t.co/UaUb9fKdG4
Vote against Q1 = Governor chooses your reps &amp; voters have NO say. Vote for Q1 =  respect will of voters &amp; give them a say. #MDpolitics https://t.co/UaUb9fKdG4

@JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan Um ya'll trying to give $37.5 million to a wealthy arms dealer for nothing &amp; tax cut for luxury yacht owners
@JPeters_in_MD I guess don't worry about it. @LarryHogan is "studying" how to build a bridge &amp; bulletrail w/o taxes &amp; fees
@JPeters_in_MD @LarryHogan Economics like needing to pay for multi-billion-$ projects, &amp; if you cut taxes/fees b4 a deficit theres no money?

@RedMaryland It was your party that advanced $37.5 mil in crony capitalism. And the foster kids didn't get $. So I been #SMDH in #MDpolitics
@RedMaryland Why don't u tell us what $400 million u will cut &amp; what agencies u will level fund if @LarryHogan budget passes in #MDpolitics
Treating opioid addiction is a top @LarryHogan priority in #MDpolitics. Not enough $ for beds (or mental health). #SryNotSry @RedMaryland
I tried to increase funding for disabled foster kids in #MDpolitics. If that's a special interest so be it @RedMaryland @mddems
Yeah, gov't is yuuuge in #MDpolitics. Tell that to mental health, addiction &amp; affordable housing advocates @RedMaryland @mddems
No. "Revenue actions" = Kansas-style starving of core government services. Try that in #MDpolitics &amp; you will see true flight @RedMaryland
No, "revenue actions" is code for GOP efforts to starve government ala Kansas @RedMaryland @mddems

@ConcrndFthrPrep Or it makes a lot of sense (cynically) and highlights a serious problem of overprescribing
@TanziStrafford That's not a response. Again, you should check your incorrect reading of election law on Google.
@TanziStrafford @RedMaryland Also your incorrect reading of law might invalidate all the state voter ID laws GOP has been pushing. Just FYI
@TanziStrafford @RedMaryland Hahaha that's funny. You should really Google "state vs federal law on voter qualifications" for the facts
@RedMaryland needs fact checker for @TanziStrafford. Total misunderstanding of US Constitution &amp; election law #MDPolitics
@TanziStrafford U should check your facts. MD already has noncitizen voting for cities. That's not violation of US Constitution #mdpolitics
@TanziStrafford I read and re-read your post many times. You think US Constitution applies to state electoral franchise. WRONG #mdpolitics

@OMalleyWatch This article I think captures my view on the link btw criminalization of black men and the War on Drugs http://t.co/vbWMbKU42k
@OMalleyWatch No but I think War on Drugs is excuse to go after POC, when we know incarceration is far inferior to a pubic health response
@OMalleyWatch No I'm with u. My point is the police use excuse of War on Drugs to unfairly target some neighborhoods, when use is widespread
@OMalleyWatch I said its the STATED justification for the police presence. I didn't say it was actually justified...
@OMalleyWatch Its selective enforcement. Pot arrest rate in Baltimore is 5-6x higher for black vs white, 3x in MoCo, etc
@OMalleyWatch Drug use is in every neighborhood, police are not.
@OMalleyWatch War on Drugs justifies criminalizing vast segments of population &amp; puts constant police presence in "certain" neighborhoods
