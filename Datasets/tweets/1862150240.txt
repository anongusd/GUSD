After 24 more years of blunders, and our 2 best options for POTUS are:	A.) The epitome of the 1% (Trump)	B.) An absolute Socialist (Sanders)
The Senate and House denied Clinton/Gore because the $$$ is in what lobbyists tell them to do as opposed to doing the right thing.
12 years later, Bill Clinton and Al Gore had great ideas on how to reverse social and economic change.
Every major issue that we have in this nation really started to peak in 1980 under the watch of Reagan.	Ronald Reagan screwed the pooch.
