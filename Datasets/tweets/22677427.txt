Credit to @realDonaldTrump.  Those wds will pain many, but If he'd capitulated to Kim out of eagerness to divert from #MichaelCohen, he'd be hammered by many, including me.  That he walked away is commendable.

Amazing how many of these members are incapable of asking a question that will yield relevant information.
3 hrs into #MichaelCohen hearing, my take is that this is a House impeachment process preview.  This is what it would look like.  All determined by partisanship and not by facts. In the case of Cohen, GOP didnt need to take any side - but made decision to defend @realDonaldTrump

A very necessary, sober antidote by @pbump to the @nytimes' Manafort revelations today. https://t.co/V9dEmIVD8v

As I said to @eliehonig I am suspicious of #Manafort lawyers making this new disclosure "by accident" - my hunch is that Manafort wanted to tip public off as to what #Mueller already knows in this regard @SXMPOTUS
"I don't see what the purpose would be of putting this deliberately out there.....how would Manafort benefit from putting it out there?" @eliehonig on the redaction "mistake" by Manafort lawyers @SXMPOTUS 124

That @realDonaldTrump rally last night was a milestone in a process deserving study.  It brought full circle something begun 30 years ago where GOP leadership surrendered their power to partisan media as GOTV vehicle and drove nation into partisan ditch
Could not make it up.  Watching @foxandfriends and listening to hosts hammer a reporter who inadvertently left phone on and revealed her bias agn candidate. Ok, but this, on the a.m. after their own talent pool appeared onstage with POTUS

As I said to @JohnBerman moments ago @CNN, maybe it's just not complicated.  Historically, when a president is under water (&lt;50%) and Trump is with approval of about 40%, his party loses somewhere near 35 seats in the House.
Our state is a relic. We should join those that have early voting not absentee voting for cause only https://t.co/XSQeOp1wu4

Im exhausted.  I watched it all.  Tweeted all day long. Bottom line? BOTH were credible. And in the world we live, sadly, partisans among us will continue to believe whatever they thought 9 hours ago. As for the rest of us, there is just no clean/clear outcome. #KavanaughHearings
All day long, probative questions have been a rarity.  I think @SenKamalaHarris poses legitimate inquiry asking Kavanaugh to square his claim of left wing conspiracy with treatment afforded to JGorsuch.  #KavanaughHearings
I really do wish @SenFeinstein would spell out exactly what her handling of the letter has been.  If I am mistaken, and she has done so, Id like to see that explanation. It's a legitimate question.  #KavanaughHearings
Wondering....Kavanaugh has been so hot with Ds, if confronted by @SenBooker might he raise the latter's own Stanford behavior as evidenced in column Booker wrote?  Id have said no, but today, anything is possible.  #Kavanaugh
Kavanaugh's antipathy toward the Ds on committee is palpable, eg @SenBlumenthal - he should turn it down a notch - especially with  @SenBooker still to come.
Important to note:  Some of us have been watching all day - but many Americans coming home from work now, and getting their first look. What happens now will shape many opinions.  #Kavanaugh
.@ChrisCoons asks appropriate questions - and Kavanaugh notes that the party attendees have given statements of denial.  And so it goes. #Kavanaugh
What I really think going on re Kavanaugh and his unwillingness to embrace FBI is that he knows delay is not his friend.  Either he gets thru now, or he doesnt make it.  If this goes another 2 weeks, there will be more claims, not necessarily credible, but more. #Kavanaugh
Cmon Grassley...No one is suggesting that the FBI render a verdict.  That is your job. They are saying FBI investigation would be helpful to sift thru this. It is the delay that Grassley fears.  #Kavanaugh
He struggles to answer @amyklobuchar blackout question.  A simple NO would have been more effective than asking her, which seemed defensive.  #KavanaughFord
Some will take away from this that it is Kavanaugh's call as to whether FBI conduct investigation.  I personally would like the FBI to help sort this out.  But I dont think the implication that it is his decision is correct.  #KavanaughFord
Breaking news..... @SenWhitehouse never played quarters.   #KavanaughFord
.@LindseyGrahamSC just saved Kavanaugh from what could have been a dramatic turn for worse initiated by @SenatorDurbin - Durbin's reasonable request for FBI elicited weak reply by Kavanaugh, but Graham turned it around
Highest drama all day.  Durbin says right now, tell WH/Don McGaghn you want FBI investigation. "I want to know what you want to do" - "Phony question" he says.  #KavanaughFord
Leahy asks about Bart O'Kavanaugh character.  Is that you? No answer.  "You'd have to ask him"  Will we ever hear from Judge?  #KavanaughHearings
Before I hear any of this spin at the timeout, I want to record that I found her to be very credible - and feel the same about him.  Only a pure partisan could say otherwise.  #KavanaughHearings
Will anyone ask him about Ed Whelan's sleuthing?  #KavanaughHearings
Feinstein raises FBI.  Will he ask her why she held letter since summer?  #KavanaughHearings
Wait....Rs outsourced their questions to him, too? Jesus, do your job. #KavanaughHearings
"What some of you on this side of committee have unleashed."  Not blaming Ford, blaming Ds.  #KavanaughHearings
Rs will take a dive, for sure.  But wondering how willing to engage the Ds will be when questioning? Who among them is going to seriously ask him on the underlying facts? #KavanaughHearings
He's running thru all the high school charges against him, but will he address his friendship with his buddy Judge?  Waiting.... #KavanaughHearings
As compelling as I find him, I ask myself, why didn't he demand that FBI bolster his recollection and calendar?  #KavanaughHearings
"Hanging out having beers with friends."  Should have acknowledged that to @marthamaccallum earlier in week.  More credible.
Our kids wont rely on faded memory and blurred calendars.  It will be Uber receipts, Snapchat and PayPal receipts. l
The factual recitation he is offering now is what the hired prosecutor and Ds should have both covered with Dr. Ford, but didn't.  #KavanaughHearings
Im tweeting often and immediate because I want to record my thoughts before all the partisan spin. For better or worse, this entire day it's been my authentic views. When it ends, go back and read the progression.
Having heard no cross exam of him yet, I still want to ask - am I the only one who finds them both credible in their testimony?
You know who will most appreciate the fight in him?  The guy who appointed him.  #KavanaughHearings
Seems like we are headed to a vote.  Any Republican who thought they'd dodge a bullet by him withdrawing now mistaken?  #KavanaughHearings
Not even Clarence Thomas was so forceful.  "This is a circus" the 2018 version of "high tech lynching". #KavanaughHearings
Question:  Is this what you think a man wrongly accused looks like?  Thus far, yes. #Kavanaugh
"I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford."  #Kavanaugh
Im already thinking this day could be a "push".  What then?  #Kavanaugh
Much different tone by Kavanaugh than when he first came before committee.  Here we go.
Im prepared to be disappointed in the lack of objectivity in Round 2. Dems who asked not a substantive Q of Ford will change tune with Kavanaugh, and Rs will now take a dive.  Sad. Need more independent thinking.
don't get swayed by all the spin happening now - see my twitter feed - 26 tweets in real time from before, during and after Dr. Ford's testimony #FordTestimony #KavanaughHearings
She was a very credible witness. No reasonable observer could say otherwise. That being said, this process was terrible because of format and the neglect by many to use their time to search for truth.
This entire process is a window into the lack of independent thinking in Washington. Who among this group walked in with an open mind genuinely wanting to hear testimony?
She clearly has something else to say about another party/ will senator Harris ask or not?
President Booker- not a single substantive question.
Pepsi not happy with Dr Ford’s testimony
.@cnn @SunlenSerfaty reporting that @OrrinHatch reaction to Dr. Ford was that she was "attractive" and "pleasing"....perhaps they should have outsourced more than just the questioning....
Minnesotans - it’s still lunch break at the hearing – time to buy tickets for my “American Life in Columns” – just added St Paul on the tour for NEXT MONDAY Oct 8th - info and tix here: https://t.co/MRIz0QuOP9
The only thing elicited by cross examination of Dr Ford so far is that her fear of air travel might not be real. No blood
Sen Whitehouse correctly lays it out - 13 men have precluded Ford claims from getting rightful FBI investigation.
Potomac Safeway...one more reason Judge needs to testify
How, if you are Kavanaugh and have clean hands, are you not the one demanding that Judge be called to testify??????
Durbin elicits 100% certain response from Dr. Ford.  Good line of questioning. Damning details.
This hearing is horseshit.  Leahy now interjecting his plea for FBI. While that IS the right call, we are theoretically in the midst of a witness interrogation. Let it happen. GOP was so eager to shirk their questioning responsibly, the ignored the format.
Republican mistake was not in hiring a professional to do their job, it was in not creating a format that allows for proper cross examination.  Rachel Mitchell will not be able to establish a rhythm. Every 5 mins Ds will giver Dr. Ford a breather.
This 5 minute, 5 minute format is going to be bullshit if Grassley follows it.  The proper way to do this is to just let Rachel Mitchell pursue her line of questioning. And same for any Ds.
Bad news for Kavanaugh that she's the first of the claimants to be given a platform.  Odds are increasing that there will be no need to assess the others.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, which is increasingly in doubt by the minute - without calling Mark Judge - then this is a Kangaroo Court. This is a story about 3 people.
The second front door explanation of when she told story rings true.  A level of detail that increases credibility unless invented by psychopath, and she's not
Gut check on her opening statement: no flamboyance in her presentation.  Straightforward - and yes, credible.
The Feinstein and Grassley Show just reinforces my concern about the disjointed structure of this hearing.  Rachel Mitchell should be able to question Ford without yielding floor every 5 minutes.  And same with Ds.
It's not that I disagree with what Feinstein is saying, it's that I disapprove of this grandstanding.  The witness is sitting there.  We want to hear from her.  Please step aside and let us hear from her.
Wonder what Millennials are thinking watching Grassley and Feinstein kick this off?
Grassley taking opportunity to poison well before it all begins.  Cmon Chuck, let's just let her speak. And then him.

Are women wearing black today in solidarity with Dr. Ford and does that extend to journalists? #Kavanaugh
The trial lawyer in me says alternating questioning between Rachel Mitchell and the Ds might hinder Mitchell from establishing a rhythm with her cross examination. It would be more effective for her to ask follow-ups with no time limit
Should the Senate Judiciary Committee vote Friday on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination? You can vote right NOW at https://t.co/UCpx3FqWfX #survey
Am reading Dr. Ford's intended testimony.  One sure area she'll be questioned: Letter to Feinstein said Kavanaugh and Judge "scrapped" with each other after "pile toppled" which some might interpret as drunken playfulness.  No such mention in intended testimony. https://t.co/8lUMfJz74C
Cannot imagine that Senate Judiciary will actually vote tomorrow with so much swirling around #Kavanaugh nomination especially where members will lack the usual crutch of polling data after today's hearing.

Let's hear if for Houston - here's a taste of what you get when you come out to see the "American Life in Columns" stage show - it winds up with fabulous Q&amp;A from the audience - take a listen: https://t.co/8zP9x3wv4z @hobbycenter
with me @SXMPOTUS 124 @amandaripley investigates a "classic American mystery": Why does college cost so much? And can it possibly be worth it? https://t.co/706CdrQMmQ
Right now @SXMPOTUS the LIVE lightning round from last night’s stage show @hobbycenter - listen to great political comments from Texans
New @NewYorker allegations agst #Kavanaugh go 1 of 2 ways…..pebble that tips scales of justice &amp; keeps him off court OR easily cross examined (“she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty”) account helps his nomination
ummm..... fellow @Yale alum accuses #Kavanaugh AND today 12pm is the launch of Yalie @ChrisCuomo #LetsGetAfterIt on @SXMPOTUS 124 @SiriusXM - coincidence? I think not....

.@realdonaldtrump was just handed his last, best opportunity to try and end the Mueller probe.  Im (obviously) not endorsing that course, just observing the cover this story provides him.  Hard to believe he will pass it up. Next 48 hours will be telling.  https://t.co/5avEGIGifa
Potential triple play?  So does @realdonaldtrump now tell Sessions to fire Rosenstein, and when he says no, fire them both, then appoint a new AG willing to fire Mueller, too? https://t.co/5avEGIGifa

That Lynch and @BillClinton did not discuss the email investigation during tarmac meeting means nothing.  Of course they didn't.  Both are too sophisticated for that but no words needed to be spoken. The mtg should never have taken place.
On the Rt: See, IG says Strzok said he'd stop Trump.  On the Lft: See, IG says @Comey acted without bias.   So predictable.  Stop painting by numbers.
If you are Mueller reading the IG report on @Comey, one lesson might be to release your report(s) to Rosenstein regardless of the midterm calendar. To do otherwise is to make Comey's mistake by taking politics into consideration.

So far 85% say @PressSec should not have walked about of @WHCA Dinner when @michelleisawolf did her performance (she did not) - do you agree? Vote at https://t.co/UCpx3FqWfX #Poll
The net effect is to reinforce to Red States the Trump characterization of media as self-indulgent, classless, out of touch, and underhanded.
I'm not sure how many people outside of DC watched the speech live. But the fallout has drawn attention to the speech and the media culture surrounding it.
.@mollylroberts essay in @washingtonpost (https://t.co/JVYlgx6Yww) makes good points about how these times call for something other than a “normal” #WHCD, but make no mistake, this is a Yuge win for @realdonaldtrump.
She said “facts,” not “fat.” Still, like was the case with SNL, comments about @PressSec's appearance were out of bounds. And the abortion joke was beyond crass.
But… she clearly crossed lines - not with profanity, F-bombs are fine for 10pm on a Saturday night on cable - but with content.
She was funnier than being given credit for. Michael Cohen, Pussy hats, Bear Stearns  - all original jokes and funny stuff. Having attended a few of these dinners, I know it’s a long night and a tough room for an entertainer to work.

We're possibly on the cusp of the type of military action that comes only when you have an all volunteer force.  If more members of Congress had sons in harm's way, there'd be more caution and debate.
Bad as any the presumed chemical attack is, exactly what U.S. constituency is clamoring for U.S. military response in Syria?  None I can discern.
And... in this news cycle, the longer the time lapse between a presumed chemical attack and any response, the more it loses its connection and deterrent effect.
WH conundrum (look it up): How do you save face and maintain perception of strength while walking back a promise of "nice new and smart" missiles?

130k is not chump change.  If you have to borrow that amount to pay a debt incurred on someone else's behalf, you'd presumably want it back to satisfy that loan. Key Q: was it reimbursed?

Every vote matters in #PA18 tonight. https://t.co/xIHrtWYbo0
Confirmed my tip. #PA18 Washington co will count tonight.
Will Washington County count tonight??  #PA18. Yes
There are 1195 absentee ballots that will not be counted until tomorrow in Washington County #PA18 - so can the race really be decided tonight?  In doubt.  @CNN https://t.co/r7GIBr0Ws8
There it is @cnn.  Washington Co absentee not being counted until tomorrow https://t.co/kRWoiizIWw
Whoa... might this not be decided until tomorrow? Will Washington TWP ballots not be counted until tomorrow?  #PA18 Developing
Anyone who wishes to credit @realDonaldTrump with closing gap over weekend in #PA18 needs to address why this BEGAN a single digit race before people even realized that Saccone was a bad retail candidate.
Apart from absentee ballots, an advanced society should be able to count 207,000 ballots with literally one question on them within 2 hours #PA18
I said to @AC360 when night began @cnn that margin more impt than the Victor- this is exactly what I meant
Last time I had this view I didn’t leave till 5am (11/8/16). These absentee ballots look like they’ll extend this night in #PA18 https://t.co/mUQPTvJIiq
If 87% vote in, and only 2k votes separate the #PA18 candidates, does it really matter for the takeaway which one wins??  @cnn
True that @ConorLambPA ironically would not have survived a Dem primary in #PA18 but same happens on Rep right - example Mike Castle loses to Christine Donnell who loses general.  @cnn
Only 16% of vote in on #PA18 pm  - my hunch is that the vote will unfold quickly when it does - there is only one thing on the ballot, literally nothing else to count and then go home
Looking forward to participating @cnn coverage re #PA18 - 8-11pm with @AC360 - one prelim thought: margin more important than outcome.  Not sure it matters which one squeaks out a victory if it's squeaker.
Embarrassing, but could've been worse.  At least they weren't allowed to vote.  https://t.co/JrJPBEgzVB via @PittsburghPG

With regard to #PA18 - who/what will win?  Passion.  On a cold PA day, with nothing else on ballot, and at stake just 9 month tenure in vanishing district, it will be the side with the most emotion, not necessarily largest number supporters
Regarding the House Intel Committee and Russia - so sad that our partisan differences no longer stop at the water's edge.

Something to be appreciated about #Mueller indictments today -the ability to keep it all secret until last minute. Before Rosenstein announcement, media was speculating it could be about Florida shooting. We have no idea what Mueller knows.
