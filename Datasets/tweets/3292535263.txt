I have used catnip at the posts as well to invite my cats to the post. Alyssa, I commend you so much for trying. I find the greatest advantage is to keep their claws trimmed.
@johnpavlovitz @BetoORourke Nice smiles.
@alyssa_brianna_ @cscatlady The abandoned declawed cat I found starving and injured urinates  outside the box. It’s common. You can’t even imagine the smell. My 4 clawed cats all use the cat trees I provide. If they scratch where they shouldn’t I use tape on the surface and they stop.
@alyssa_brianna_ The homeless or declaw argument is false. But if cats could talk, they’d pick their toes over any home. Since declawed cats are often surrendered to shelters for urinating outside the box, your priorities convince me you would dump the cat either way.  Spare the cat’s suffering.
