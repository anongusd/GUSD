"Capitalism has evolved by taking things that live outside of the market, bringing them into the market dynamic, transforming them into commodities that can be sold and purchased," says @shoshanazuboff. "Surveillance capitalism continues this transition but with that dark twist." https://t.co/4BUJ1KPdwB
Author Shoshana Zuboff (@shoshanazuboff) calls surveillance capitalism an economic logic. "It is not the same as technology. This is one of the big lies that has been perpetrated, that these methodologies are the only way that digital technology can work." https://t.co/IFJ5i2DRg7
Shoshana Zuboff (@shoshanazuboff) calls surveillance capitalism "a direct assault on human autonomy, a direct assault on our decision rights, a direct assault on the whole notion of individual sovereignty." #DNlive https://t.co/5xh1lFiYsZ
"Surveillance capitalism is an economic logic that includes, but moves far beyond, Facebook," says @shoshanazuboff. "We're going to need the social response that addresses, interrupts and outlaws this new economic logic—not just a single company or a couple of companies." https://t.co/TKRRgLKN4X
🔴 On air now: @shoshanazuboff is in studio to talk about her new book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," which warns that big tech is drastically reshaping society and human behavior. https://t.co/rHC7sbZBp6

But we have the will." https://t.co/9XdpRXhiax
Siblings Magdalena and Rio of @earthguardianz say they confronted Sen. Feinstein because of the urgency of climate change. "I think that she could've been a little more respectful ... But it's not about her — it's more about getting a Green New Deal," says Magdalena. https://t.co/CPZshEz4V0
"I'm the one who has to miss school because of smoke days; I'm the one who has to worry about flash floods and mudslides and fires," says activist Isha Clarke, on why she confronted @SenFeinstein about climate change. "I'm the one who's at the forefront of those experiences." https://t.co/32SkTJRZrG
"It's too pricey to not enact the Green New Deal," says youth activist Isha Clarke of @Y_Vs_A, who spoke to @SenFeinstein last week in a now-viral confrontation. "The longer that we wait the more costly and devastating the consequences of this climate crisis will be." https://t.co/TOUiDCMmrS

Activist @POkoumou wears clothes that say, "We really do care.

"In five minutes, this freshman congresswoman just laid out a whole investigative plan for three more topics into Donald Trump's potentially criminal activities," says journalist @emptywheel of House Rep. @AOC's questioning of Michael Cohen. https://t.co/9894j8NG0H
.@emptywheel on Michael Cohen's testimony: "Do we all know what a creep he was during 2016? Absolutely, yeah. Was yesterday a performance? Absolutely. But did he come off at least credibly enough to make what he was saying about Trump generally seem true? I think he did." https://t.co/vO1C6MyHKC
"What was most surprising was that Cohen came off more credibly than certainly the Republicans who were trying to damage his credibility," says @emptywheel, noting President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen seemed credible enough to make truthful claims. https://t.co/9I5RvOO0FS
🔴 On air now: Independent journalist Marcy Wheeler (@emptywheel) breaks down Michael Cohen's testimony before Congress yesterday, where Trump's former personal attorney accused the president of committing multiple crimes before and after he took office. https://t.co/hRcdmQMEro
"We don't know what the full picture is" behind the end of the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, says @christineahn. South Korean reports suggest John Bolton insisted biological and chemical weapons be part of a deal, and that North Korea responded by insisting all sanctions be lifted. https://t.co/vWG4iXR21N
"This is a moment when the international community must put pressure… on the countries that have been siding with the United States," says @christineahn of @WomenCrossDMZ. "Korea wants peace and the international community has a responsibility to support it." https://t.co/ozSKq9ZlOe
Korea expert @christineahn says the U.S. can't pass ambitious domestic programs like Medicare for All or free college without cutting the $700 billion budget in military spending in the Pacific. "We have a golden opportunity," she says. https://t.co/Eqx7Al2XG9
"The Korean people want an end to this Korean War," says @christineahn, executive director of @WomenCrossDMZ. "One of the key outcomes we were hoping for was the lifting of sanctions that are definitely getting in the way of inter-Korean economic progress." https://t.co/ZXdYZXI17Q
🔴 On air now: "It's obviously a very sad day for 80 million Korean people around the world, especially on the peninsula," says @christineahn on the Hanoi Summit's abrupt end.

Nuclear expert Zia Mian says addressing nonproliferation requires asking: "What does it take to control the great powers that have basically dominated world affairs for such a long time through their threat of catastrophic violence?" #DNlive https://t.co/bfOxBJ4y64
"A nuclear deal with Iran... would be a good thing. Having North Korea continue to commit to a diplomatic process going forward would be a good thing," says Zia Mian. "But neither of these are going to solve the underlying problem," which is "the existence of nuclear weapons." https://t.co/TPQuGG0pvn
🔴 On air now: Nuclear expert and disarmament activist Zia Mian says the #TrumpKimSummit is important, but "the larger issue we need to focus on is the fact that nuclear weapons are too important to be left to the whims of leaders like Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un." https://t.co/yUcMjMcPju
"I'm really grateful to the survivors" for coming forward and appearing on camera in "Surviving R. Kelly," says @dreamhampton. "We knew that we might get sued, so they couldn't get paid to come on camera, and they did it anyway, and they knew that they would be disbelieved." https://t.co/PICfyZbgsB
"I'm just worried about the two girls that remain with him," says filmmaker @dreamhampton of Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, who were seen sitting behind R. Kelly in court last week.

"We have told [R. Kelly] again and again that what he's doing isn't wrong, that we believe him despite all evidence to the contrary," says @dreamhampton, executive producer of "Surviving R. Kelly."

"Zarif put his reputation on the line in negotiating the Iran Nuclear Agreement" and felt frustrated by the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, she says. https://t.co/nD2D0anLTu
Pakistan has a long history of using "proxy fighters as a way to increase its capacity to wage war against its neighbors," says nuclear expert Zia Mian. "They look for ways in which they can use military thinking and strategy to carry out foreign policy rather than diplomacy." https://t.co/7zJrtMpZx6
"The international community has basically thrown its hands up and walked away," says Zia Mian of Kashmir, the center of a territorial conflict between India and Pakistan. "Neither the Indians nor the Pakistanis were willing to respect what the Kashmiris might actually want." https://t.co/RLxIf7LgBd
"It's not so much the military on military violence, but the fact that large numbers of civilians along the line of control that divide India Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir are caught in this endless barrage of artillery and firing," says Zia Mian. https://t.co/SONAeolC2N
"The escalation in fighting between India and Pakistan is a grave source of concern for people all over the world," says Zia Mian, nuclear expert and @Princeton research scientist. "It's part of a larger, ongoing crisis that surges into the news every so often." #DNlive https://t.co/iVSpi3Cppr

.@homerventers says prisons need to make major changes to help inmates with behavioral issues: "The idea that we had a solitary confinement unit for people with mental illness in the New York City jails until 2014 is horrific." #DNlive https://t.co/eWL8MFJHXD
"We've sort of grown numb to these headlines, like an individual died in prison or jail," says @NewYorker writer @jengonnerman. She adds that we often gloss over some of the tough questions associated with these incidents: "Did this death have to happen? Was it preventable?" https://t.co/SkVUfx2g7W
Homer Venters (@homerventers) explains the "pressure of dual loyalty" many correctional health professionals face when treating the incarcerated, saying that they are urged to act "more as an agent of the security service than as a healthcare provider." https://t.co/wrWDAxMISl
"This system was conferring new health risks to our patients," says @homerventers, former chief medical officer for New York City’s Correctional Health Services. "Our patients were getting hurt because of the way that jails were set up and run." #DNlive https://t.co/TXRDE5Ocpv

Attorney Charlie Swift says barring Hoda Muthana from the U.S. has "significant" implications, and that it paves the way for the government to also block re-entry for other citizens who "say and do things the U.S. doesn't like" while abroad. https://t.co/RP8AVNEQRS

After @marcorubio tweeted cryptic images of a bloodied Muammar Gaddafi, seemingly directed at Venezuela's embattled President Nicolás Maduro, @jaarreaza says Rubio cannot represent the American people. "What kind of representative is he for the people?" https://t.co/cCrwm5CFnu
"This was a plan. It was activated last year when they decided not to recognize the results of the presidential election," says @jaarreaza, Venezuelan foreign minister, on Juan Guidó declaring himself president. "Nothing is a coincidence when it comes to Venezuela and the U.S." https://t.co/tUFKLKGmtJ
"When you see the TV, it seems that [Nicolás] Maduro gave the order to his military to fire on the people, and that's not true," says @jaarreaza, Venezuelan foreign minister and former vice president. "We were very, very prudent and we resisted an invasion, somehow." https://t.co/XwhLHDJcRJ

"This certainly is not humanitarian aid and it's not oriented with any humanitarian aims," Edgardo Lander says. "This is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group, and the extreme right wing in Venezuela." #DNlive https://t.co/SjZu2gffAy

"I personally feel all the talk of lifestyle choices is a distraction from policy and the things we need to do at that level." #DNlive https://t.co/G0heF9nFRx
Trump is "less of a denier than someone who sees an opportunity in slow-walking action" on climate change, says author @dwallacewells. "He sees an advantage in American inaction in opening more coal plants and letting the rest of the world clean up the mess." #DNlive https://t.co/b9ZtY6TeKO

"This is not a credible attempt at helping the Venezuelan people," says historian @vijayprashad on Trump's call for regime change. "This is not a credible set of concerns about democracy or human rights. These people want to go to war." #DNlive https://t.co/4xok4mxlts

Today we spent the hour covering this weekend's events in Birmingham honoring civil rights icon and scholar Angela Davis, after @bhamcivilrights rescinded an award over her activism for Palestinian rights. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/wZAPFOcKOe

3,000 people came out to see Dr. Angela Davis speak in Birmingham this weekend, organized by the Birmingham Committee for Truth &amp; Reconciliation. "We just want a transparent conversation" about what happened when the award was rescinded, says chair DeJuana Thompson. https://t.co/KZOqu5yYeX
"It was an unfortunate set of circumstances that led to the decision by the board to rescind the award," Andrea Taylor, president of @bhamcivilrights, told us. "We learned something about how people all over the world feel a connection to Birmingham and its civil rights history." https://t.co/c74nqdbJtH
"Black people especially owe a great deal to Palestinians who have been struggling for decades and decades and refuse to give up," Angela Davis said, speaking to @imaniperry. "They are an inspiration to people who are fighting for freedom everywhere on the planet." https://t.co/ThvJdq4LvB
In a conversation with @imaniperry, Dr. Angela Davis recalled hearing that the @bhamcivilrights award was rescinded: "I don't want to do anything that can damage the future of this very important institution… It became clear to me that this might actually be a teachable moment" https://t.co/34WVZ7Qd4f
Birmingham resident Margaret Weinberg told us she was taken aback by @bhamcivilrights rescinding its award for Angela Davis: "I've never equated Palestinian solidarity with anti-Semitism. To me, those are two different things, and we need to keep them two different things" https://t.co/77xz4WxQYa
"My Judaism is directly rooted in social justice," says Jesse Schaffer, host of a Shabbat on Friday in honor of Angela Davis in her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. "The true reflection of Jewish values is this, building community around building a better world." #DNlive https://t.co/sgiHumJhiY
On Friday, Jewish activists around the U.S. held Shabbat in solidarity with Angela Davis, declaring, “Angela, you are welcome at this Shabbat.” The language was inspired by signs from when she went underground as the FBI hunted her—"Angela, Sister, You Are Welcome in This House" https://t.co/evZdu2gnW5

Immigrant rights activist Erika Andiola responds to Democrats like Rep. @AOC and @JoaquinCastrotx voting against the spending measure passed last night: "That is the right thing to do. We've been pushing for Democrats to do the right thing, to stop playing [Trump's] games" https://t.co/CFmcN9OQDv

"I have never seen teenagers more exhausted than [former Parkland student] Emma González was on the day before the midterm elections," says journalist @loisbeckett. "But they're already organizing to do more voter registration and turnout for 2020." https://t.co/d7qmpO3UKQ
"These are not just kids from Parkland working on this," says @loisbeckett, on activism on gun violence since last year. "The students have connected with young gun violence prevention advocates all across the country… They are building a deep bench of young political talent." https://t.co/9GUUpBomSK
Since the Parkland massacre last Valentine's Day, student gun control activists have turned "what was viral fame and media attention into the most old-fashioned and basic kind of political power: turnout," says @loisbeckett, journalist for the @GuardianUS. https://t.co/YUoWz7h03w
"We're dealing with a situation where not just dark forces of the U.S., but dark forces of Latin America that are linked to extreme violence, are now having suits and ties put on them and put out as leaders of this new Venezuela that they want," says @robvato. https://t.co/8o951RHql7

Ronald Reagan and Elliott Abrams "unconditionally" backed former Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt during the 1980s, notes @robvato. Montt "perpetrated massacres and wiping out entire towns, and perpetrated 85% of the killings of civilians during the war," he adds. #DNlive https://t.co/h5jd4jLk6q

The case is strongly related to the struggles of public school teachers striking across the U.S., says Anna Simonton of @scalawagmag. Simonton says a narrative was constructed in the Atlanta trial to paint public schools as "terrible" and make the case for charter schools. https://t.co/k5MFPZP4Fj
“This was actually something that was happening across the country,” says @ShaniAuthor, of widespread allegations of cheating on high-stakes tests in U.S. public schools. “What we can’t figure out is why teachers in Atlanta were slapped with felony charges." #DNlive https://t.co/380DTinac3
Shani Robinson's co-author Anna Simonton says the Atlanta trial was "incredibly unfair" and nonsensical: Witnesses recanted on the stand, the judge said perjury was occurring but didn't declare a mistrial, and the judge demanded teachers give up their right to appeal, she recalls https://t.co/M7ASRGCeYc
“The Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal was a period of time in which educators were accused of changing their students’ answers from wrong to right on standardized tests,” explains @ShaniAuthor, former first-grade teacher. “I was facing 25 years in prison.”	#NoneOfTheAbove https://t.co/N8JlGurCJ0
Up now at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB: We're talking with Shani Robinson (@ShaniAuthor), one of the 11 former Atlanta teachers convicted in what prosecutors said was a massive cheating scandal, and journalist Anna Simonton, co-author of the new book "None of the Above" https://t.co/Pnd2HHjYUy

.@TimJohnson4 calls it a "puzzling case" and says more investigation is needed: "This air charter company went repeatedly to places in Venezuela and Colombia starting January 11. Prior to that it had mostly operated domestically, and suddenly it began to change its patterns." https://t.co/uoF1jMNQ9v

"This is what everybody was afraid of when Bolsonaro won," says @ggreenwald on the current state of violence in Brazil. "He got elected based on his promise to unleash the police &amp; to authorize indiscriminate violence in the favelas where the poorest people in Brazil live." https://t.co/N5FtQGa35j
Amazon reached its status as a global powerhouse by virtue of Jeff Bezos "working hand in hand with the U.S. government and with police... constructing exactly the kind of sprawling, invasive, surveillance state that he believes now himself to be a victim of," says @ggreenwald. https://t.co/7IaQ32xAOd
"Ordinarily we would sympathize with the person who was being threatened with exposure of their private life," says @ggreenwald of Jeff Bezos. "Yet, in this case, the person who's the 'victim' is not just the world's richest person... but somebody who has used these tactics." https://t.co/v7gciwsmpi
.@ggreenwald says Jeff Bezos has implied that the National Enquirer was able to obtain text messages between him and his mistress as a result of abuse by the surveillance state.

"The important thing to understand about this is who is benefiting: It's the vulture funds, once again," notes @juangon68. He names a Boston hedge fund and two New York firms that hold billions of dollars of Puerto Rico's debt: "They're gonna make a killing" https://t.co/uRntTqGaXw
A federal judge approved a partial debt restructuring plan for Puerto Rico on Monday that requires payment of $32 billion over 40 years—Critics say vulture funds will reap huge profits by buying up those debts. @juangon68 calls it a "terrible decision" for Puerto Ricans. #DNlive https://t.co/Tfd88e0d05
"It was a night of contrast," says activist Ana María Archila, responding to the SOTU. "It was incredible to see a sea of women wearing white, representing the history of our country… On the other hand, there was Kavanaugh, representing the failure of democracy." https://t.co/1uuCrM6cZV
It was "really difficult" to be in the room during the State of the Union when Trump disparaged immigrants, says Rep. @IlhanMN. "For the president to continue to demonize immigrants and speak of aliens and not realize that seeking asylum isn't illegal is really devastating" #SOTU https://t.co/LqDuS11ANx
In his speech last night, President Trump again called Iran the world's leading state sponsor of terror, denouncing its "radical regime." Rep. Ilhan Omar responds: "This is a president who has cozied up to Saudi Arabia… This president is a liar-in-chief"	#SOTU #DNlive https://t.co/eBCprvPcI4
Rep. @IlhanMN on the SOTU: "I expected there to be an acknowledgment of the workers that he just used as political football—I expected there to be some imagination, a plan. It really felt like a pedestrian address, and I was taken aback by the lack of planning, vision &amp; interest" https://t.co/kLzNqaMxuA

On today’s show, @mtinkersalas and @dsmilde talk about U.S. regime change in Venezuela, and we get updates from El Chapo’s New York trial from @llchristyll. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/3TZPWsCGrv
"We spend $100B on illegal drugs here in the U.S. every year. That demand and the price premium that comes from our prohibitionist policies, from the militarization of the border—those things will continue to be a massive incentive" for drug cartels, says @llchristyll. #DNlive https://t.co/JvbuQBWy4H
Scholar @llchristyll says the impact of a guilty verdict for El Chapo on the drug war would be "basically nil": "Literally nothing changes about how drugs are coming across the border… The drug cartels will continue to meet the demand that comes from the United States." https://t.co/5X8n3dsnhB
It's overly simplistic to assume pressuring Nicolás Maduro and "trying to lure the military to step in" would lead to democracy in Venezuela, says David Smilde (@dsmilde). It is "just as likely that the whole situation will break into a civil war." https://t.co/OfQg8cXN37
"Sanctions essentially pass the pain onto the population, not the government," says @mtinkersalas, calling U.S. economic measures against Venezuela a "dangerous proposition." He adds: "It increases the suffering for the average Venezuelan"	#DNlive https://t.co/E6aDYgkyz6
🔴 On-air now, @pomonacollege professor @mtinkersalas says Venezuela's opposition overestimated their power and thought Nicolás Maduro would have been ousted already: "They underestimate, consistently, the fact that he may still have power among sectors of the population" https://t.co/F9zWh7XXEr

Throughout the film “Clemency,” writer and director Chinonye Chukwu wanted to underscore the risk of botched execution. “That is kind of this shadow that’s cast over the entire film as a possibility that can happen again and again and again,” she says. https://t.co/6g2QsH3Qtx

“Do We as a Society Have a Right to Kill?”: Chinonye Chukwu’s Film “Clemency” Examines Death Penalty https://t.co/3wjvgHFD3D https://t.co/rDwnhbMmc2
.@Always_InSeason director @jackieolive: "The real tragedy of a possible lynching is compounded by the denial and the coverup. Not only do you have to deal with the death, but then you have to deal with people telling you that you don't know what you're talking about." https://t.co/329QR8yjrJ

Police hastily deemed high school student Lennon Lacy's 2014 hanging death a suicide. His mother, Claudia Lacy, says investigators failed to do their due diligence in probing his death, and she urges her community and others to "start the conversation" about racist violence. https://t.co/DaXjHduoNm
"Lynching for more than a century was the ultimate tool of racial terrorism," notes filmmaker @jackieolive, who directed @Always_InSeason. She adds: "It was a way to keep black people policing themselves."	#DNlive https://t.co/nmR6HLmXJZ
Now at https://t.co/Xup8cdbMh1: We're talking about the disturbing new documentary "Always in Season," on lynching in the U.S. and the death of African-American 17-year-old Lennon Lacy, who was found hanging in 2014 from a swing set in a white trailer park in North Carolina. https://t.co/33TCIz3IdQ
During filming for "Clemency," the cast often discussed their personal views on the death penalty, @ChinonyeC says. "I hope that this film can really encourage people to ask the question, 'Do we as a society have the right to kill?' and not ask 'Should this person die or not?'" https://t.co/HISGgTI37c
.@ChinonyeC on why she focused on the prison warden in her movie "Clemency": "I wanted to explore and challenge the system of incarceration, of capital punishment, of the prison-industrial complex, through the gaze of a perpetrator of the system." https://t.co/o6r7Tiuzja
Actor @AlfreWoodard visited death row prisoners and prison staff in Ohio as she prepared to play a warden in the new film "Clemency." Those who carry out executions experience PTSD at soaring rates, she notes—"while we hammer out whether we believe in capital punishment or not" https://t.co/lvnDm0TUlC
"I was really inspired to write 'Clemency' the morning after Troy Davis was executed," says filmmaker @ChinonyeC. Troy Anthony Davis was killed by lethal injection by the state of Georgia in 2011. "I thought… what must it be like for the people who had to kill him?" https://t.co/RpPyP3fFHM

The Time's Up initiative (@TIMESUPNOW) is pushing Hollywood studios and actors to commit to work with women directors in its new #4PercentChallenge. Time's Up is about "addressing safety in the workplace," says actor @TessaThompson_x. "It's really looking at imbalance of power." https://t.co/Z2qPQu1NcP
"For so long when we talk about inclusion, people of color have been mostly ignored in the space of magical realism," says @TessaThompson_x, speaking with Amy Goodman at Sundance. "Films like Sorry to Bother You… break down those barriers" https://t.co/FkEjw3nLRB
"The pain that our communities are suffering together is one that's gonna make us have to address these issues," says @TamikaDMallory. "If we don't, we're not going to be able to build a movement that is big enough to fight all these different forms of oppression." https://t.co/glYafmwc9X
"Anti-Semitism has been here way before there was a Minister Farrakhan," says Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour), criticizing the media for focusing on internal divisions in the Women's March "instead of focusing on the real threat to our communities, which is white nationalism." https://t.co/f9TwJpTaF2
At a panel at Sundance, Nancy Kaufman (@NCJWCEO) calls the controversy over Louis Farrakhan and the Women's March "very difficult," saying it affected attendance at the march. "It had a ripple effect. I think Jews did show up all over the country, but there are concerns." #DNlive https://t.co/cooJsqkNaz
"Our responsibility doesn't end on Election Day," says @staceyabrams, who is suing Georgia election officials over mismanagement. "The minute the elections are over, the people who won—who did not share our values—are going to be working hard. We have to be working even harder." https://t.co/U3KUR5UDwZ
"Our mission is to fix our democracy by forcing changes to our electoral system," says @staceyabrams of her new organization @fairfightaction. "Voting rights is the foundation and bedrock of how democracy works... That democracy is failing."	#DNlive https://t.co/2fZtSffvIF

The U.S. "doesn't care at all about elections" and has "no outside credibility," @AllanNairn14 says, on the U.S. backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó. "They don't care at all about the poor. Completely fake elections are fine with them." #DNlive https://t.co/NyfFYtAF73
The appointment of right-wing hawk Elliott Abrams as special envoy to Venezuela shows "that the U.S. is trying to overthrow the government of Venezuela, and that it will be willing to use violence, to use military force, if necessary," says investigative journalist @AllanNairn14. https://t.co/0rsRiviYVK

"I expected rigorous hours," former Weinstein Company employee Lauren O'Connor tells Democracy Now! at Sundance. "What I didn't expect was the abuse I'd be exposed to, the abuse that I'd see others have to withstand." #DNlive https://t.co/CrgQGpkD0S

Today we spoke with @sellner74, @AleVelascoNYU &amp; @medeabenjamin about the crisis in Venezuela. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/WAjcIz3fpi
"It's important for the left in the United States to stand up, not to say we love Maduro, but to say we're against U.S. intervention," says @medeabenjamin. She's calling on the U.S. to "back off, to not support a parallel government in Venezuela, and to say no to a coup." #DNlive https://t.co/VGDXjwa0al
Medea Benjamin of @codepink disrupted @SecPompeo's speech at OAS yesterday, holding a sign reading "OAS: Don't support a coup in Venezuela." She says the U.S. is helping set the stage for civil war and urges negotiations and dialogue to end the crisis. https://t.co/WXnxaGJ0bH
Alejandro Velasco of @NACLA notes the speed of the "cascade of events" in Venezuela, from Juan Guaidó claiming power to the U.S. recognizing him shortly after: "The level of coordination suggests powerfully that this could not have just been very spontaneous." https://t.co/ufS6fqhsyK
The sanctions that prohibit Citgo from remitting profits to Venezuela translate to the country losing approximately $1B per year, says Steve Ellner (@sellner74). "There is a major impact in terms of discouraging commercial and financial interests throughout the world." #DNlive https://t.co/cgqJwUDdzY
"The level of discontent—especially among popular sectors who previously strongly supported Maduro and before him Chavez—is palpable… However, that does not translate, and it hasn't in the past, and it's unclear whether it does now, to support for the opposition" -@AleVelascoNYU https://t.co/0C4AUv8b3L
Are we seeing a coup in the making in Venezuela? @AleVelascoNYU, who just returned from Venezuela on Tuesday, says: "Yeah, absolutely. There's no question, on the other hand, that the Maduro government lacks a significant amount of popular support and… legal legitimacy" https://t.co/FkiFOErGWD

Kaleck reflects on Chile and Argentina: "Torture is not something that happens at some point in the past. It has an impact on the individuals, on their families, but also on society. And that is really important, to bridge between that current situation and the past." https://t.co/YSDe28Xh4Q
Leading European human rights lawyer @WolfgangKaleck criticizes President Obama for deciding against holding torturers of the Bush administration accountable: "It's stupid, because if we don't care for the torture in the past, it will appear in the future again." #DNlive https://t.co/sE8YvyvKIN

"It is an attempted coup d'état," says former U.N. independent expert @Alfreddezayas, on Venezuela. "We have here an unconstitutional situation in which the legislature is usurping competences that belong to the executive and to the judiciary." #DNlive https://t.co/4luc7Tz0nz
Becoming a major exporter of oil while importing much of its food, Venezuela's economy became dependent on countries like the U.S., says @mtinkersalas. Now, thanks to U.S. sanctions and government mismanagement, he says, the economic system is fracturing. https://t.co/fq1o35xxX6
The U.S. recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's interim president "is an effort to escalate the crisis, to polarize the conditions further," says Venezuelan historian @mtinkersalas.

Today’s show feat. @ArleneInouye and @sarahljaffe on the historic Los Angeles teachers' strike, and @chasestrangio of the @ACLU on Trump’s trans military ban. Podcast: https://t.co/gyObi82ZL7
The Trump administration is suggesting "that trans people don't exist at all," says @chasestrangio, responding to the Supreme Court greenlighting its plan to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military. "It's essentially Don't Ask, Don't Tell 2.0, but even worse." https://t.co/Bot1g32Llq
.@sarahljaffe connects the rising teachers' movements in blue states to Democrats' support for charter schools: "It's been bipartisan policy to sort of beat up on teachers and argue that privatizing the schools will make them better. And we're finally seeing incredible pushback" https://t.co/P73HUzSgBO
Key accomplishments of the strike, per @ArleneInouye:	- A nurse at each school 5 days/week	- More academic counselors	- Hiring 41 additional teacher-librarians	- Funding for mental healthcare 	- More early educators, bilingual teachers	- Possibility of capping charter schools https://t.co/JWylvetAWE
"We want higher salaries, smaller class sizes, less testing — but ultimately, this fight is about the privatization of schools," says Marianne O'Brien, a 10th-grade English teacher from the L.A. School of Global Studies who was on the picket line yesterday https://t.co/MkWqkYqBSK
After approving a new contract, L.A. teachers will return to their classrooms today. @UTLAnow bargaining chair @ArleneInouye is celebrating the deal, which followed a historic 6-day strike: "This was a historic agreement and gave us more than we expected" https://t.co/MX7wFZxcrx
Then—As the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration's ban on trans servicemembers in the military to take effect, we'll hear response from the @ACLU's @chasestrangio. Tune in 8-9AM ET at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB. https://t.co/DErbRE2S03

On today's broadcast: Omaha elder Nathan Phillips and @ChaseIronEyes talk about the confrontation with Catholic high school students Friday &amp; @DavidTreuer discusses his new book “The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee.” Listen to the podcast ↓ 	https://t.co/0PNopmvzDT
"In the popular imagination, 1890 was the endpoint" of Native peoples, says @DavidTreuer. His book "The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present," counters that narrative. "I'm not destroyed, my culture isn't destroyed, my community isn't destroyed." https://t.co/4PAnDyc7BX
"You have the president making light and being flippantly dehumanizing and offensive about our genocide," says @ChaseIronEyes. "You know, my family literally survived Wounded Knee. When he says the things he does, he gives license to young impressionable minds" https://t.co/nu33P8PgDG
"I was very concerned that it was going to get out of hand," @ChaseIronEyes adds, on Saturday's confrontation near the Lincoln Memorial. "And I looked for adults—If they were there, they were wearing MAGA hats, too, and encouraging this" https://t.co/MzgQvkUDJP
.@ChaseIronEyes, who helped organize the Indigenous People's March, recounts what he saw: "There were so many youth, jumping up and down, jeering. It was a mob frenzy, they were ridiculing, they were exhibiting nothing but contempt and scorn for one of our elders" https://t.co/xZvsHRaKC9
"I was absolutely afraid. There was a group of over 200 young, angry white men who were displaying mob mentality, and they were facing down just four black individuals," says Nathan Phillips. "A snap of the finger could have caused them kids to descend on those four individuals." https://t.co/yc8i0SJLPd

Time won't solve racial injustice, Martin Luther King Jr. said, speaking in 1964. "I’m convinced that the forces of ill will have often used time much more effectively than the forces of goodwill… We must realize that the time is always ripe to do right." https://t.co/zFqHIhTEki

After the 2010 midterm elections and the Tea Party's resurgence, restraining the IRS became a way for the GOP to attack Obamacare, says @paulkiel. "The cumulative effect of that is a budget cut of over $2 billion, in today's dollars, over that time." https://t.co/wWDTvqCoxu

Those close to Ali have said history must not "whitewash" his legacy as just a boxer, or even just an activist. "We have to take the whole Ali," says @DMogahed. "We can’t pick and choose, and we can’t revise him to what makes us comfortable." https://t.co/Uyl1hs3EAO
Here's a video of @johnlegend reading Ali's 1966 speech against the Vietnam War: "I either have to obey the laws of the land or the laws of Allah. I have nothing to lose by standing up for my beliefs. So I’ll go to jail." https://t.co/JXPPa3XhWu
We spoke with @DMogahed about his legacy in 2016: "Don’t De-Islamicize Muhammad Ali: Scholar Says Muslim Faith was Central to His Views on Racism &amp; War" https://t.co/F2VcSINjJ2
In 1966, Ali announced his refusal to fight in Vietnam: "My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people or some poor, hungry people in the mud… Just take me to jail." He was given a 5-year prison sentence—later reversed. https://t.co/FLub9T7gHV
Ali saw the Vietnam War as an extension of the oppression of black, brown and poor people in the U.S. As Dave Zirin (@EdgeofSports) said in 2016, he wasn't just a voice for peace, but "far more radical than that—Muhammad Ali was against empire." https://t.co/AHGzHPD8zo

Since former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler became acting administrator at the EPA, he has been "checking off that wish list of the coal industry," says @SierraClub's @maryannehitt. "It is the fox in charge of the hen house. It's the bank robber in charge of the vault." https://t.co/Obs7IRTxc2

Airport workers and other federal employees are being treated "in a mean and humiliating fashion," says Barbara Ehrenreich, who is calling for a TSA strike—which critics have pointed out would be illegal. "It's more dignified to strike than to be just used as pawns," she says. https://t.co/YOZdZwAmhk
"Don't just take this lying down," urges @B_Ehrenreich, to the 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working sans pay. "If enough airport workers were able to either walk away from the job or go on strike, that would shut down the airports. That would just shut down the economy." https://t.co/7U9sV5VBs0

We spent the hour on immigration and deportations today with Clara Long (@clarychka) of @hrw, @GregGrandin of @nyuniversity &amp; @kevinchlo of @aaaj_alc. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/CXlKfmvuTj
Watch today's top U.S. and world headlines: https://t.co/xwmgQthYhR #MichaelFlynn #TrumpFoundation #Rohingya
Many of those affected are refugees living in the U.S. after fleeing war, U.S. bombings and genocide under the Khmer Rouge. Kevin Lo's organization, @aaaj_alc, has been issuing warnings to Cambodian community members: "We have seen ICE raids every four months." https://t.co/tNKfguIbdM
Immigrant rights attorney @kevinchlo on President Trump sanctioning visas for Cambodians in the U.S.: "We initially thought this would not affect things that much, but within a month… ICE picked up about 100 Cambodians and were basically preparing them for deportation" https://t.co/OoKQ0XTMKH
"This is a totally unethical, immoral, unprofessional use of psychotropic drugs," says psychologist @PaulaJCaplan, on the medication of detained migrant children. "At the best of times, that sort of thing needs to be done only after everything else has been tried." https://t.co/YTyS7RbGjm
Harvard psychologist @PaulaJCaplan is calling on U.S. media to regularly remind people about the migrant children jailed by the U.S. government: "We want to keep that in the public eye. If we don't have daily reminders of what's going on, then people forget about it." #DNlive https://t.co/lCGgjbCUms
.@GregGrandin points out Jakelin's place of origin in Guatemala, Alta Verapaz, saw subsistence farming destroyed by economic policies. "This is a region caught in a vortex of global capitalism… The Trump administration is vile, but this history predates the Trump administration" https://t.co/GxRCor85v2
"Why should this little girl be in a jail-like system in the first place?" asks @clarychka, following the death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquín. "The U.S. can do this better… Treating people like criminals will lead, unfortunately, to these kinds of outcomes." https://t.co/ELittuGHoC
Clara Long (@clarychka) of @hrw says the public still doesn't have all the facts about the death of Jakelin Caal Maquín in Border Patrol custody, but what's important is the context: That Border Patrol has a culture of "indifference, and of neglect, and of abuse of migrants." https://t.co/C2Hq9Mmiwg
And: Advocates are sounding the alarm over a sharp rise in deportations of Cambodian immigrants living in the U.S. We'll talk with immigrant rights attorney @kevinchlo of @aaaj_alc about the fight to stop the deportations, live 8-9AM ET at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB. https://t.co/aLlMerXsUj

"In order to redress any problems we have, we have to look internationally," says @marclamonthill, on black solidarity with human rights struggles. "That's what Malcolm X was attempting to do, that's what Martin King was doing… That's what the Black Panthers were doing." https://t.co/yARHtKrSuJ
"If I'm outraged by gentrification, if I'm outraged by the separation of families, if I'm outraged by redlining, if I'm outraged by all of these kind of domestic issues… I have to be able to take that same outrage to every part of the world" - @marclamonthill on academic freedom https://t.co/gRtoQcRjq1
Academic and author @marclamonthill spoke on behalf of Palestinian rights at the U.N. and was fired from CNN and called anti-Semitic. "At no point in the speech did I call for violence against Jewish brothers and sisters," he says. "That was not the spirit of the speech." #DNlive https://t.co/LDMGGmsRze
"It was a violation of everything," says Palestinian-American speech specialist Bahia Amawi, on being fired for refusing to pledge not to boycott Israel. "A violation of my freedom of speech, right to protest… It was actually a no-brainer. I knew I had to do something about it." https://t.co/EjjUok45Hm
When Gov. Greg Abbott signed the anti-BDS bill, Texas joined 25 other states with similar laws. "You can boycott Canada or Russia or anybody else—it's just special protection for Israel that not even American businesses enjoy. That's what makes it so shocking," says @ggreenwald. https://t.co/TyFbV6GPV9
Any action to not support Israel—including not buying Sabra brand hummus—would be in violation of the policy, explains attorney @gadeirabbas. "Bahia's actions and choices to spend her money in a particular way are expressive actions that are protected by the First Amendment." https://t.co/mTR9EUij18
Last year, Texas-based speech pathologist Bahia Amawi noticed her school contract renewal would require her to agree to not boycott Israel. She immediately took up the issue with the school: "It affects me both ways, as an American citizen and as a Palestinian-American as well." https://t.co/1VUtwSVYtR

Watch today's top U.S. and world headlines: https://t.co/MArnKvkJjL #MickMulvaney #ACA #March4Ed
Journalist @JeffreyEStern on the Saudi coalition's air assault: "At the very least they've been extraordinarily careless. And using these weapons to hit things like water wells, whether they believe it's a water well or not, has created the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe" https://t.co/Ts22ZKRDhE
The Yemeni town of Arhab, bombed in 2016 as they tried to build a well, learned that creating infrastructure means "inviting" warplanes to come. So they stopped building, and water quickly became scarce. We're talking with @JeffreyEStern, who reported this story for the @nytimes. https://t.co/OVYafXKLSd
But @RalphNader also warns: Don't buy into the idea that replacing Trump would change the "fundamental, corrupt, corporatist, war-making structure of our federal government." He argues Trump's behavior in office builds on unchecked power by Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. https://t.co/qDGvGLIkgU
Ralph Nader wants the public to see impeachment as a viable option in the next Congress and to "stop thinking impeachment is like the ultimate neutron bomb or something." He says it's the "only way to hold the executive accountable." #DNlive https://t.co/RDf8UOmTzC
"President Trump is digging himself an even bigger hole by putting Mulvaney there. The combination of Mulvaney, John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo… He's trying to get sycophants around him, which usually is a late stage in the collapse of a regime" - @RalphNader https://t.co/OqiTZ6kBCf
.@RalphNader calls Trump's chief of staff pick Mick Mulvaney a "massive outlaw" and notes that the public can't sue to remove him. "Everywhere he goes in the federal government, he shuts down law enforcement, he harasses civil servants, he aids and abets Wall Street crimes." https://t.co/ZitG7UDO7u

Missed today's live show from COP24? We talked with Meena Raman of @FoEint, Nigerian activist @NnimmoB &amp; Costa Rican climate change activist @MonicaArayaTica. Podcast here: https://t.co/qbIr1y3vQt
“Ha, Ha, Ha”: At U.N. Climate Talks, Protesters Laugh Out Trump Admin Official Pushing Fossil Fuels https://t.co/UFCWW16yDi https://t.co/9TaJ6Dygjm
"Fossil-free Costa Rica is already happening," says climate activist @MonicaArayaTica, on how the country subsisted for 300 days on clean energy in 2017. "While the world is debating how to become more renewable… we are already there." #DNlive #COP24 https://t.co/6fjA1ZYRqP
The nonbinding 2015 Paris climate agreement was popular with politicians, because polluters saw they “didn’t have to do anything that science requires,” explains Nigerian climate activist and author @NnimmoB. "This is just the design and the desire of the fossil fuel industry." https://t.co/Cq6KHN4AY5
Meena Raman calls the U.S. "hypocritical" for demanding countries in the Global South cut their carbon emissions. "These are people who emit nothing… They have to eat, they have to go to school," she says. "All of this is not possible because they don't have access to energy." https://t.co/e3Do3zwejz
"It's really hypocritical that the U.S. is here, in what I would characterize as in bad faith," says Meena Raman, of the U.S. role in climate talks at COP24. The U.S. "is seeking to dilute further what was already a very delicate treaty,” she says. https://t.co/ycHfXufax9

On today’s show, we sat down with Typhoon Haiyan survivor Joanna Sustento and @harjeet11 of @ActionAid at the U.N. climate talks in Poland. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/vQeDbk4eRF
U.S. negotiators are still participating in the U.N. climate talks in Poland despite Trump's promise to withdraw from the Paris agreement. "The U.S. is setting the rules of a game which it is not going to play at all," says @harjeet11. "It's watering down the text"	#DNlive https://t.co/rRg0CrntCV
Harjeet Singh of @ActionAid says it's "frustrating" to see the U.S. at COP24: "They're using every single opportunity to destroy the Paris agreement… They're making sure not a single penny goes from their side to developing countries who have to transition their economies" https://t.co/mBIodODBZd
Joanna Sustento has dedicated her life to activism, now fighting to hold the “carbon majors,” the 47 fossil fuel companies responsible for nearly 1/4 of all greenhouse gases, accountable for the deaths. “It's a grave injustice, because we are not responsible for this." #COP24 https://t.co/t5rIJshhQv
"The waves were so strong. I was being pushed under the steel trusses of a building… It felt like I was being spun inside a washing machine," Joanna Sustento remembers of Typhoon Haiyan. "It was very exhausting for me to try to survive." #Philippines #COP24 https://t.co/hJRmXbIxZr
Climate activist Joanna Sustento recalls when Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest cyclones in recorded history, devastated the Philippines and killed her family members. "I kept on calling her, but she didn't respond anymore, and that's when I realized my mom was gone." https://t.co/6TeJcjXy5s
Also: In our third live broadcast from the U.N. climate talks in Poland, Harjeet Singh (@harjeet11) of @ActionAid will give updates on how the world's biggest polluters are hindering climate talks at #COP24. Watch 8-9AM ET/2-3 PM GMT+1: https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB. https://t.co/hO8FF4Rf6g

TODAY: When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in 2013, Joanna Sustento survived—but the devastating storm killed five members of her family. She says the world's 47 biggest carbon emitters should be held accountable. Watch 8-9AM ET/2-3 PM GMT+1: https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB https://t.co/okPOi8lIlj

Climate scientist @KevinClimate says Trump has "reignited a stagnant debate on climate change" with his inaction: "Increasing the voices who feel they've been marginalized over the last 20 years on climate change, they're coming to the fore, there's a sense of a new dialogue." https://t.co/HVVOIwmGsN
15-year-old Swedish climate activist @GretaThunberg says her weekly school strikes were inspired after Parkland, FL students launched a movement for gun control. "Instead of worrying about how our future might turn out, we should try to change it while you still can." https://t.co/yialDod73C

.@WinonaLaduke is fighting to save her northern Minnesota land, the site of the approved Enbridge Line 3 pipeline. "I live in a place where there are still insects. I live in a place where there is still life… That's what this battle is about. It's about: can we protect that?" https://t.co/WZJSNkE8oU
Winona LaDuke of @HonorTheEarth on an indigenous "Green New Deal": "The next economy has to be something that reaffirms our relationship to the earth and gives us a shot. That to me looks like a lot of local food, organic food."	#DNlive https://t.co/DcFA6koakE

"What we’re seeing in Wisconsin and Michigan is a national strategy by Republicans, who are losing their hold on power after the 2018 elections. They see a wave that is trying to push back Republicans. And the response to that is to try to undo democracy." https://t.co/JDQOUTzKsd
Part of Spain's transition to democracy included a mass "forgetting" of its fascist past, says @AlmuDocu. "This is not taught in schools, this is not taught in the streets and it is not talked about in the families." https://t.co/BjLA635TI0
Almudena Carracedo’s documentary @SilenceofOthers follows survivors of Spain's dictatorship. "What we tried to do in the film was bring back the past, to make a film about the legacy of the Franco regime in the present so that new generations could learn about what happened." https://t.co/44HcZMDbaN
"The Chinese government is targeting the entire population of Uyghurs," says Rushan Abbas, on surveillance and family infiltration. "Not just the 2-3 million Uyghurs in the camps, but also people leading their regular lives. They're living in a police state, being monitored 24/7" https://t.co/0QJVRxpV1d
"My sister was a retired medical doctor and speaks fluent Chinese," says @rushan614, who believes her family is in an anti-Muslim forced re-education camp. China says the camps are for vocational training. "I don't understand what she's being trained in," Rushan replies.	#DNlive https://t.co/hGEX4reEsP
After Uyghur-American activist Rushan Abbas (@rushan614) spoke out against China's repression of Muslims earlier this year, her aunt and sister disappeared and have not been heard from since.

The media was limited to inaccurate and censored government material from the 1991 Iraq invasion, unable to challenge the U.S. narrative, says Rick MacArthur. There were "no reporters on the field to verify anything… The American public gets the impression it's a 'clean' war." https://t.co/YpAKXRoVpJ
Rick MacArthur recounts how former Pres. George H.W. Bush employed propaganda to justify invading Iraq in 1991, including a fabricated story about soldiers killing Kuwaiti babies: "There were babies killed because of neglect and because of the American bombardment." https://t.co/CinuZRTWy9
Protesters will take to the WI state capitol again today to oppose the power grab. "The public has really spoken on this. They have asked to remove Scott Walker from office.

As of 4 a.m. today, the WI legislature passed the first of a "raft of bills to grab power from the incoming governor Tony Evers," says @rconniff. "The bill that is going to go to Scott Walker's desk next insists on work requirements for Medicaid assistance."	#DNlive #WIPowerGrab https://t.co/HeGypARmBp

“The problem with Bush and how he’s being treated now is the incapacity of most Americans to look in the mirror and recognize what they have done to the world," says Chilean author and poet Ariel Dorfman. "We should remember the terrible pain that he wrought." #Bush41 https://t.co/SCQYQ3SgNw
"There's a through line through Bush's life that's being completely ignored in all of the obituaries and the remembrances of Bush. And that through line is the easy resort to violence in the Third World." - @GregGrandin, author and professor of Latin American history 	#Bush41 https://t.co/bDXzEhk0CI
During the invasion, the U.S. unleashed 24,000 troops against a country with an army smaller than the NYPD. An estimated 3,000 Panamanians died, and poor neighborhoods burned. Civilians were targeted "indiscriminately" and in violation of international law, says José Luis Morín. https://t.co/5fAxoPmIW3
President George H.W. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989 was the biggest deployment of U.S. troops since the Vietnam War, notes historian @GregGrandin. The U.S. violated Panama's sovereignty with public support and in the name of "democracy," a turning point in U.S. invasions. https://t.co/GAVteAD177

George H.W. Bush's administration forcibly sterilized hundreds of HIV-positive Haitian people who were sent to Guantanamo Bay after seeking refuge in the U.S. in the '90s.

The National Climate Assessment predicts costs to the U.S. of $141B from heat-related deaths, $118B from sea level rise and $32B in infrastructure damage by 2100. Deep inequities will determine who bears the brunt of climate change, says @kristie_ebi. https://t.co/s75t0SLaRC
"I think [Mohammed bin Salman] is upset now that people are questioning his actions because, frankly, he has been operating with impunity for the last nearly last four years." - Yemeni scholar @shireen818 https://t.co/7y3umsJNrU
“The people who are quiet on [Donald Trump’s] side are just as guilty as he is in this inhumane, unconstitutional, immoral action that we see happening against human beings,” says @RevDrBarber, on the tear gassing of asylum seekers. https://t.co/pJDOqeDV73

From Vermont, Amy talks with #MedicareforAll advocates Kelly Coogan-Gehr, Jo Beardsmore, and @HosniehMarbin; then we hear from Sen. @BernieSanders on popular support for a progressive agenda. Listen here: https://t.co/QTAio4ncsq
Democrats controlling the House carries weight in the Senate, too, says Sen. @BernieSanders. Sending bills to the Senate that would raise minimum wage or expand healthcare puts pressure on Senate Republicans, who "have to explain to the folks back home why you voted no." https://t.co/4lBKwSsgiT
In his speech Thursday, Sen. @BernieSanders said Jamal Khashoggi's murder is just "one example" of violence by Saudi Arabia's regime, referencing the war in Yemen. "What a terrible tragedy that was—But what about the 85,000 children who've starved to death?" #DNlive https://t.co/dvju1rUiIk
"It's not enough to offer small, technical solutions to these big complicated problems," says Jo Beardsmore, an adviser to the National Nurses United #MedicareForAll campaign. "We have to offer bold solutions which really match the scale of the problems we face." #DNlive https://t.co/1kxcJGqnM5
"You have 1 in 3 Americans in the course of their lifetime declaring bankruptcy because of medical costs… 40% of Americans within two years of being diagnosed with cancer going through their entire life savings," says Kelly Coogan-Gehr. "How can we not afford single-payer?" https://t.co/RCVum1Mgfc
British anesthesiologist Dr. @HosniehMarbini draws parallels to the fight to defend the NHS: "What we've seen in the UK since the conservatives have been in power has been a privatization and market-based approach… We're fighting this neoliberal ideology alongside the Americans" https://t.co/rgMkxtEfUV
"We are in an era of proto-fascism… Right now, healthcare spending is 18% of our GDP; by 2026 it will be over 20% of our GDP. By fighting for Medicare for All, the American people understand they are taking back 1/5 of their economy." - Kelly Coogan-Gehr of @NationalNurses https://t.co/7dxWkU41YP

Indoor meat production "is an unbelievable exercise in mass cruelty in the torture of intelligent, sentient beings,” says @guardian columnist @GeorgeMonbiot—but, he adds, free range meat "is much crueler to the living planet, because it's such an inefficient use of land." https://t.co/dvIbakYpP4
"If we stop eating meat and dairy, we have an enormous potential then for sucking carbon out of the atmosphere, because so much of the land which is currently occupied by livestock could revegetate if livestock was removed," says @GeorgeMonbiot. https://t.co/0lwXqAPVak
Guardian columnist @GeorgeMonbiot is calling for an end to meat consumption to address climate change: "What we need to do in the rich nations is to switch towards a plant based diet. We have the means to do so, we have the technology to do so, we have the choice to do so" https://t.co/FKA4SimSVq

"This marks the first really big initial victory we've seen," says @shireen818, reacting to yesterday's 63-37 Senate vote on a measure to end U.S. backing for the war in Yemen that's left over 85,000 children dead. "We've never been so close to having a real debate and a vote." https://t.co/unb2rTmZmQ

Honduras has been devastated by the drug war, particularly since the 2009 U.S.-backed coup. Pres. Juan Orlando Hernández's brother was arrested for drug trafficking Monday.

"He's kind of this mediocre lawyer who doesn't understand very much about the Constitution, who doesn't know enough to know that he's sometimes saying things in the same paragraph that contradict each other."—@imillhiser on Trump's pick for acting attorney general Matt Whitaker https://t.co/w2cC1CBpgo
.@muhammadshehad2 on Israeli bombing of residential &amp; commercial buildings in Gaza: "Israel's choice for the next target is carefully calibrated in accordance with the desired magnitude of pain it wishes to leave Gaza with in order to teach it a lesson." #DNlive https://t.co/VM3LPVZGZD
Gazan writer @muhammadshehad2 says "Gaza is already, in fact, unlivable": "About 80 percent of the population depends on food packages and humanitarian aid to survive, and you have 97 percent of the water unfit for human consumption, totally polluted." #DNlive https://t.co/CpBinBtiyK
"To say that this is just one fire season after another without looking at the long term does not do us any good," says @mayboeve. "We know we have to transition our economy off of fossil fuels and to 100 percent renewable energy." 	#DNlive #CampFire #WoolseyFire https://t.co/WhPwinSVLL
Climate activist @mayboeve of @350action, speaking from Berkeley, California: "People have been staying indoors, wearing masks, and the sky is hazy… We're really daunted by the reality of the climate impacts that are facing us. This is what the scientists warned us." #CampFire https://t.co/PZ7WR11zY8
.@GlenMMacDonald1 says higher temperatures promote evaporation in the summer and prolong California's fire season into the winter. "The governor is quite correct, we can anticipate that these sort of events will occur in the future and they'll become worse." #CaliforniaFires https://t.co/W8YoA5UILz
Of the 20 largest recorded wildfires in California history, "15 of those 20 have occurred since the year 2000, and that's really been linked to, coincidental with, record temperatures," says climate scientist @GlenMMacDonald1, who had to evacuate his home in the #WoolseyFire. https://t.co/qxnr4XWfnG

Journalist @suzannecgordon says the VA Mission Act of 2018 contains provisions to "starve the VA of resources" instead of helping veterans deal with wounds of war: "There will be more money going to private sectors… that are not equipped to take care of veterans' problems." https://t.co/mn2hafYJ9Z
"Wars almost always cause more problems than they solve," says Adam Hochschild, on lessons from the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI. He urges Trump and others to "think long and hard before starting a new war." #DNlive #ArmisticeDay https://t.co/2bxZ52EKiF
Propaganda during WWI convinced Germans they were winning the war until they lost, says Adam Hochschild. That fed the "legend of the stab-in-the-back," with right-wing Germans blaming "Jews, socialists, communists, pacifists" for the country's defeat, years before Hitler's rise. https://t.co/576FbbVfJZ
Now at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB: Journalist &amp; author Adam Hochschild says Armistice Day must also recognize &amp; celebrate activists like Jane Addams, Eugene V. Debs and Emma Goldman, who saw WWI as "madness" and worked to stop it: "They were patriots also." https://t.co/se0yj5EbDn

Congressmember-elect Rashida Tlaib draws parallels between the U.S. under Trump and Israel under Netanyahu: https://t.co/TQey9ZC0UP
"Our movements will never concede to hate. We will never concede to homophobia. We will never concede to bigotry. And we will be here insisting that every vote is counted." - Andrea Cristina Mercado, @NewFLMajority https://t.co/adnvUN6uv9
This week we sat down with former Congressmember Elizabeth Holtzman, who served on the House Judiciary Committee that recommended Richard Nixon's impeachment, to talk about similarities in Trump's behavior now: https://t.co/K7KdPgcSGl
"It’s very frustrating for all of us here in Broward County. I was in that voting booth with my two daughters and really had to search for where I was going to vote for U.S. Senate." https://t.co/mt92aCdRqa
“This is a march to disaster, which is only paralleled by the moves of the administration to race towards the cliff of environmental destruction with eyes open.” — Noam Chomsky on the U.S. withdrawing from the INF treaty https://t.co/KbCS8RQ8wm
"The dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi was so ghastly, and it made people realize that the Saudis would go to great lengths to cover up… But certainly the dismemberment of children who have been hit by aerial attacks is just as ghastly." - Kathy Kelly https://t.co/htkSlGevtc
The GOP tax bill is “an enormous gift to wealth [and] corporate power,” says Noam Chomsky. “All because we have to lavish gifts on the super-rich and ensure that the corporations have profits bulging out of their ears.” https://t.co/i5gTWpWhyd
"Sessions was about as loyal to Trump as you could find anybody. He was the first senator to back Trump. He defended Trump throughout the campaign… He didn’t think what Trump bragged he could do to women constituted sexual assault" - @DavidColeACLU https://t.co/ADiK51qvJS
Before the mass shooting in California Wednesday, a misogynist murdered two women &amp; injured four more in a Florida yoga studio. “Anger &amp; loneliness are thought to be part of being masculine,” says @schemaly. “It’s destructive to society.” https://t.co/r5syyLIOeV
"The number of votes that it takes, because of the massive gerrymandering that we have going on," says @ProfCAnderson, "it requires a blue tsunami in order to get a blue trickle." https://t.co/yb7YjRxiyj
"In order to fill a couple of overstuffed pockets with more dollars, they’re willing to threaten the existence of organized human life." - Noam Chomsky https://t.co/ln8kzMwxtj
"Focus on making sure that we have a seat at the table, that we can truly be heard, not just displayed as like, 'Oh, look, our caucus is now diverse. Great!'"' - Rashida Tlaib on being part of the wave of women of color headed to Congress https://t.co/bwJp28WTmN

.@DREAMERcado of @NewFLMajority says in Broward County, Florida, the "design of the ballot was flawed," with the U.S. Senate race located on the side and hard to find: "We believe that's resulted in tens of thousands of people not voting in the race for U.S. Senate." #DNlive https://t.co/2U121CyrKk

Colorado's Amendment 74 is phrased as though it benefits property owners, but it's a "trick," says @davidsirota. "They are not designed for the average farmer or rancher in Colorado. They are designed to have fossil fuel attorneys sue local communities." #ElectionDay https://t.co/9GsVMMp9tT
Sen. Bernie Sanders has come out as a fierce opponent of #Amendment74, calling it "extremely dangerous." David Sirota adds: It is a "radical change" to the law, "designed to narrowly and specifically benefit the fossil fuel industry." #DNlive https://t.co/cXC1ynse58
Oil and gas companies are pouring millions into a constitutional amendment on the ballot in Colorado, Amendment 74, as a template to "effectively ban and block any state or local effort to deal with climate change and to reduce fossil fuel use," says @davidsirota. #ElectionDay https://t.co/jFVMunPnRd
"It's not illegal for him to maintain being the Secretary of State, but it's unethical," says @aimeeallison about Brian Kemp's campaign. "Instead of talking about the issues like Medicare expansion or education… he's using racism openly to try to get people to the polls" #DNlive https://t.co/gFrSV9Ndk1
"Despite the fact that white nationalists are backing Brian Kemp and he's using racist language, there's something more powerful, and, I think, deeply transformational, about the electoral organizing and the campaign that Stacey Abrams represents," says @aimeeallison. #DNlive https://t.co/xXjQh5qEEB
Printers in North Dakota were "actually blowing up" from printing so many tribal IDs for Native voters, reports @AriBerman. "It shouldn't be this difficult to vote, particularly for the most historically disenfranchised community in this country, who was here before we were." https://t.co/zhWlWjohA0
Ari Berman on the Trump admin including a citizenship question on the 2020 census, a decision now being challenged in court: "The fix was in from the beginning. This was done by Kris Kobach, Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions—the most anti-immigrant figures in the Republican Party" https://t.co/N6XBuTza70
"If you look at the numbers, early voting is shattering records among young people, among people of color," says @AriBerman. "We're seeing a lot more people that typically sit out midterm elections going &amp; showing up because they believe these races are so important" #ElectionDay https://t.co/m17hh3Syuq

Thank you to everyone who came out to @SokaUniv in Orange County for Amy Goodman's talk this Wednesday! Full list of upcoming events at https://t.co/w0tUi7q9Fs. https://t.co/4pW0k28qm3
Schools like @UNewHave and @YaleLawSch are facing scrutiny over ties with Saudi Arabia, but it's "not just a Saudi issue," says @yardenkatz. "Universities as a matter of routine practice form unaccountable partnerships that are negotiated in secret with many dubious actors." https://t.co/S2cLPsKHSn
Harvard Medical School fellow @yardenkatz notes MIT's @medialab hosted Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman last spring, where he met with university officials, saw demonstrations of war technology like autonomous robots and signed new partnerships. #DNlive https://t.co/nUaKtiQyf8
King, surrounded by rubble in Mexico Beach, sees the impact of climate change and is calling on the government and the public to act. "What I'm looking at around here is not a Chinese hoax. Those are really people who are suffering terribly," he says. #DNlive https://t.co/aFzG47UtmJ
Russell King's house—dubbed the "Sand Palace" and built to withstand hurricanes—stands out in Mexico Beach in Florida for largely surviving Hurricane Michael. "This storm picked up cars, picked up one man's house and put it on top of another man's house," King says. #DNlive https://t.co/KblQlk2rxb
Hurricane Michael ripped through Florida's Tyndall Air Force Base, damaging or destroying 17 F-22 fighter jets the military did not relocate before the storm, says @David_Philipps of the @nytimes. "These planes are literally irreplaceable and also just a tremendous cost." https://t.co/DvY8b92i1l
"Extreme warming in the Arctic is directly related to the climate breakdown," says Banerjee, a leading conservationist and @UNM professor. "Instead of helping to mitigate the climate crisis, [Trump] is turning the Arctic Ocean and all of Arctic Alaska into a petroscape." #DNlive https://t.co/HH1mJ9IRSp
Subhankar Banerjee outlines the consequences of the Trump admin. opening up Alaska waters to drilling: "All of this threatens indigenous food security, the incredible diversity of the marine life in those Arctic seas. And it is close to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge." https://t.co/lgjLG17ENt
Also: Jamal Khashoggi's murder has renewed scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's ties to academic institutions in the U.S. We'll talk with @yardenkatz and @ZatarStan about the elite universities "selling themselves" to Saudi interests, live 8-9AM ET: https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB https://t.co/VKHGJDuE2U
Then—We'll look at the impact of climate change-linked disasters on the U.S. military, after Hurricane Michael damaged over a dozen F-22 aircraft worth nearly $6B. @nytimes national correspondent @David_Philipps joins us live, 8-9AM ET at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB. https://t.co/ZUBGzWPgOI

Missed today's show with @BrennanCenter's Mike German, @ChapmanU professor Peter Simi, @GustavoArellano and @ElenaPopp? Listen to the podcast on @SoundCloud: https://t.co/PhMk6DC516
Watch today's top U.S. and world headlines: https://t.co/etrxJjUieV #PipeBombs #SaudiArabia #TyphoonYutu
Coming up later today! 👇 https://t.co/90WnD8Pdfz
Opponents of California's #Prop10 include some of the country's biggest landlords &amp; Wall Street investors, pouring $65M into the campaign. “Follow the money," urges @ElenaPopp. "The ‘No’ campaign is funded by the very people that brought us the housing affordability crisis." https://t.co/D3unJNI1B9
Housing rights attorney @ElenaPopp says it’s false that #Prop10 would hurt construction of new homes—"There has been rent control in Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, San Francisco. Cities that have had rent control since the 70s have had rampant development. Developers will develop." https://t.co/tdkFB87elQ
"Anything wacky and horrible about Republican politics in the United States came from Orange County," says @latimes columnist @GustavoArellano, on Democrats hoping to capture seats there. "To think that we're actually at the cusp of revolution… I'm still a sceptic." #DNlive https://t.co/VhqvYSX5nf
🔴 We're talking with @latimes columnist @GustavoArellano about congressional campaigns in Orange County where Democrats hope to unseat Republicans, including against incumbent GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who has said it's okay to not sell homes to gay people https://t.co/kWyyQcymKO
Far-right groups like Rise Above don't call themselves neo-Nazis, but rather "nationalists," says @ChapmanU prof. Peter Simi. "So it's an interesting point that President Trump just a couple of days ago at a rally in Texas made a point of identifying himself as a nationalist" https://t.co/PrjvS2HBnX
Sociologist Pete Simi responds to Rush Limbaugh casting doubt on the suspected pipe bombs: "It's incredibly irresponsible for folks to be touting these kind of 'false flag' conspiracy theories, especially at this point when so little is known about what actually happened" https://t.co/5wzJfxaDQE
Mike German, former FBI agent &amp; @BrennanCenter fellow, on federal law enforcement ignoring extremism: “It’s troubling that law enforcement is just seeming now to understand that this is organized, criminal violence… These group have had two years to organize and recruit" #DNlive https://t.co/KXHjVjVYSP
And: A November ballot measure in California would address the state's housing crisis by allowing for more rent control. L.A. eviction defense attorney @ElenaPopp of @ednlosangeles will join us live 8-9AM ET/5-6AM PT to talk about #Prop10. Stream at https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB https://t.co/tTJrsM6ugh
Then—Broadcasting live from Orange County in California, we'll speak with @latimes columnist @GustavoArellano about the key races that could determine who controls Congress after the midterm elections. 8-9AM ET/5-6AM PT: https://t.co/Xup8cdtnFB https://t.co/fjTRb8oqjj

On today’s show, advocates warn against racist voter suppression tactics in Georgia &amp; Kansas, and Silicon Valley companies work with government to expand deportations. Listen to the podcast: https://t.co/WR3wOblUZf
Peter Thiel's company Palantir is tasked with building the backbone of ICE, Jacinta Gonzalez explains. "It's creating the investigative case management system that ICE uses to be able to track immigrants, to be able to surveil them and finally organize their deportation" #DNlive https://t.co/90SJJeNgTD
Silicon Valley is changing how ICE operates on the ground, says Jacinta Gonzalez of @ConMijente—including by building tools to store more personal data like phone &amp; medical bills. "That's how Immigration is able to go door to door, conducting raids and terrorizing communities" https://t.co/QmxZrUYCuw
One of the tactics Secretary of State Brian Kemp used to remove voters from the rolls was sending postcards (pictured here)—not to all voters, but to some—demanding they fill out a form and mail it back to confirm their registration. Those who ignored the notice would be purged. https://t.co/PfiUL9F9zE
Journalist @Greg_Palast is suing GA Secretary of State Brian Kemp to find out why voters are being purged. "This is huge, and these lists are violently racially prejudiced. We're going into court to figure out why he did this… I've never seen a purge operation this wide" #DNlive https://t.co/3nJxzFtbRi
"It's very, very dangerous" for Brian Kemp to oversee the vote while running for governor, says @Greg_Palast. "When people go to the polling stations &amp; find they've been purged &amp; they fill out those provisional ballots, it will be Brian Kemp who decides whether they get counted" https://t.co/w46N7cIaKZ
"Stacey Abrams vs. Brian Kemp has become a touchstone for the entire country and for issues of voters' rights," says @LeahRigueur, professor and historian at @Kennedy_School. "This election is all about the rights of people to ensure that democracy exists." #DNlive https://t.co/zSZgJFAhUR

Listen to today's show on slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi &amp; on how imperialistic U.S. policies have caused the current crisis in Central America: https://t.co/nDlWlQCKAU
The right-wing backlash vilifying members of the caravan builds on nearly three decades of xenophobic messaging, @oachacon61 says. "If I regret one thing, it is that there is not a strong counter-narrative from the Democratic Party about… this caravan or migration altogether" https://t.co/lrMPYlLw29
"U.S. foreign aid is not what most Americans like to think," says @oachacon61 of @ALIANZAAMERICAS, responding to Trump's threats to cut off aid over the caravan. U.S. aid is earmarked for militarization and policing, and most Central Americans will never see it, Chacón says https://t.co/U53TZroWtD
"People are leaving because they don't have alternatives. It's not about looking for better opportunities, it's about looking for [a place to] survive." - Immigrant rights advocate Patricia Montes on the migrant caravan from Honduras, which just reached Mexico. #DNlive https://t.co/2x5TjY1UIu
Rula Jebreal calls Mohammed bin Salman's rule "nakedly corrupt" and says the killing of Khashoggi was "testing the waters." Calling the Saudi crown prince a reformer is "like calling David Duke a civil rights activist," she says. #DNlive https://t.co/PdSHAdmciM
The White House is complicit in covering up Khashoggi's murder and "emboldening and enabling" Mohammed bin Salman, says @rulajebreal. Jebreal notes Jared Kushner leaked CIA intel to the Saudi crown prince, who bragged about the intel and used it to purge his political opponents https://t.co/IkhRWunmVF
