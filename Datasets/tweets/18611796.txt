@patcasey86 @CliffStraham @TheOfficerTatum Yes
@patcasey86 @CliffStraham @TheOfficerTatum Sure. The undertone of the first was that you don't know anything about me, and the undertone for the second was that he limits the scope of his research.
@patcasey86 @CliffStraham @TheOfficerTatum You were. But you were not the one who said you live by do your own research and come with facts. My tweet (including the loaded question) was a reply to that, which you can see by looking at the thread.
@patcasey86 @CliffStraham @TheOfficerTatum The loaded question that I directed at someone else?
@patcasey86 @CliffStraham @TheOfficerTatum You're basing that on my WorldStar question

@CliffStraham @patcasey86 @TheOfficerTatum 1) Snopes is literally the opposite of doing your own research. You had them do it for you.	2) The "quote" isn't corroborated	3) If you believe he said that, you also believe he said he thinks he handed the South to republicans for a long time	4) Do you?

@lananothony @PPKeaveney @TheOfficerTatum I'm not reaching and I'm not talking about Republicans. You claimed the democratic party had to buy black votes. Im simply pointing out that there would not have been black votes if not for the law written, sponsored,  and passed by democrats. They didn't have to do that.

@pfoeller @Bmac0507 If I'm hungry andI don't have groceries, I don't respond by getting outraged. I go shopping. Doesn't mean there's no problem.
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 Homosexual is a definition of gay.  Outrage is not a definition of problematic.
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 So you've abandoned the correlation defense. Good. We're making progress. The problem (not outrage) with your using gay as an example of words evolving is that you've now conflated equivalence with implication.
Pale skin and wooly hair is so difficult to place in a Hairspray call.
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 Do ypu mean premise?		Problems can be met with responses other than outrage.
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 A) I will gladly concede the possibility that outrage exists somewhere in one of those articles beyond the headlines.		B) the zeigeist of which you speak is more hindsight, and a correlation is possible, but correlation isnt equivalence
I really should have brought some reading material...
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 So I'm wrong to presume the content of an article based on  a headline, but you're right to presume the feelings of the author based on...a perceived correlation
@JewishWorker From the Bernie camp
@pfoeller @Bmac0507 Based on three headlines that evince no outrage.
@JewishWorker So you think Hillary was attacked in 2018 in defense of Bernie, not as genuine criticism of her.
@JewishWorker Which criticisms?
@JewishWorker Forgive me, I've only just begin following. So you did find it odd that so many people focused on harassment in Hillary's campaign well after it ended.
@prisonculture Ivanka isn't accountable to anyone.
RT @petersterne: It's bad enough not to pay your interns. But this site wants to hire an unpaid MANAGING EDITOR. https://t.co/uhHovunJTp
@prisonculture But...her emails
@JewishWorker I would be more impressed if you had made that argument when the Clinton campaign was taken to task over their handling of a "societal issue" well after that campaign had ended.
@JewishWorker True. It's looking pretty conventionally misogynist.
People who bend themselves into ridiculous shapes to insist all the crazy shit Trump says is just his style sure have no problem believing Oman claimed that Jews have magical powers.
@JewishWorker Obviously not what I was referring to /story/2018/12/30/bernie-sanders-campaign-harassment-1077014
@JewishWorker Hillary has had several of her former staffers say she's never running again. Why is her lack of announcement more significant than his?
@JewishWorker By "Clinton surrogates" you mean "Sanders staffers?" Because that's who wrote a letter expressing their concerns.
@JewishWorker You cite an article in which she is literally quoted as saying  "no" when asked whether she wants to run as evidence that she's looking to run...very persuasive.
@TheOfficerTatum So...healthcare?
Why Aren't We Mad At Hillary seems to be a permanent political position. https://t.co/pUbgzHxnSz
@JewishWorker The focus on Bernie' s campaign is due to the fact that he has volunteers from his campaigns whose concerns are for the future. Hillary has no future campaign to examine.

@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley My only assumption is that the headline makes an assumption. If you agree with that, there's nothing to debate.
RT @JordanUhl: https://t.co/U0WUauXFR8
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley "To" is the part of the headline insinuating something false. I'm not outraged. Im just answering your questions. If you calm down, you'll realize thats not the same as an attack.
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley I haven't asumed anything about him.  Everything I know about him comes from this article.
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley Being a spendthrift doesnt make him a jerk. But yes, he had lots of money so he gave it to charity. An honest headline applauding his donations would have been just as nice.
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley The claim is that he lived a frugal life to donate is a lie. He was a rich spendthrift who decided to donate his money after his brother died because he had no living relatives. It would've been just as frugal to donate his money while he was alive and get it back in tax returns
@hogangidley45 @Cernovich @POTUS You looked in the Oval two hours later and feel like you accomplished something?
@TomiLahren You don't wake up bitter? So when does it happen? In the car on the way to work?
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley Nice that we've graduated from "assumptions" to "hang ups" so far, and that you understand that the "somewhere" from which his money came had nothing to do with his taping his shoes. The only reason to include a "frugal life" in the headline is to associate it with his donation.
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley What you're referring to is not the headline. The headline is "Social worker lives frugal life to donate nearly $11 million." There are very few rich social workers, which is why the headline implies he achieved wealth through frugality, and not dead parents.

RT @justinsink: the president just tweeted that he was in the oval, but no marine outside the west wing https://t.co/Y5EAx2wOoV
@AngerHeSmiles @AsteadWesley The headline implicates that he was able to giveafter he died because he was frugal, not that he was able to give for much of his adult life, and I stead chose to hoard it until after his death. That $11 million didn't come from wearing raggedy shoes at eating at McDonald's.

@IGonzal51504778 @u2luvntxn @antonia_okafor 1.I don't shriek about cultural appropriation 2. There are white Mexicans. 3. Not only Mexicans use Beto. Sometimrs cultures blend.

@Freedom_baybie @antonia_okafor @SenTedCruz You're right, I misspoke. Some people don't have the discernment to know  that O'Rourke is Irish.
@Freedom_baybie @antonia_okafor @SenTedCruz It doesn't, any more than it matters that O'Rourke's name is Beto. No one thinks he's Hispanic. He isn't misleading anyone.
@sweenprs @antonia_okafor So he didn't choose to go by a name other than his. He's called John because that's his name. Cruz is called Ted because that's what he asks people to call him. Just like Beto.
@u2luvntxn @antonia_okafor And Beto is short for Robert. If its not a scoop to call Cruz Raphael, it's not a scoop to call O'Rourke Robert.
@sweenprs @antonia_okafor Is John his nickname?

@ReignOfApril His point is probably that we don't appreciate subSaharan Africa enough.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 @joesanders33 The opposite of capitalism is communism. Socialism is one tick down. But we've strayed from the original point. You can hate/resent/suspect socialism while still acknowledging that cronyism can exist in capitalism.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 @joesanders33 Why are you talking about socialism now? We were talking about capitalism.
@PennyAxa @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Sorry, I don't see your point. Are you telling me government intervention led to Black Tuesday? It's a little late for me to read between the lines.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 @joesanders33 A couple of tweets ago, you said "one works and the other doesn't". What do you mean by that?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 I have.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 @joesanders33 We're talking conflicting perspectives of cronyism. What did you mean when you said one works and one doesn't?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Well you obviously have a reason to think that Hoover's policies after the crash hurt the economy. I'm not looking for a full on lecture, just what he did that makes you think that.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 What do you mean, one works? You saying family members can't be cronies?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Your professional economist friends didn't reply to me. But if you're tired, we can leave it here. Good talk.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Okay. So your definition begs government control. My definition allows for factors like nepotism and personal bias. Therein lies the disconnect.
@PennyAxa @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Capitalism has benefits. It also has downsides. If you support it, support it with your eyes open.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 No. I don't trust an employer to honestly assess what my worth is.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Okay. What programs of Hoover's made the crash worse?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 But you know that Republican wouldn't instigate a plan that benefits Democrats. That's counterproductive.	What do you mean, no? What are you saying cronyism is?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 No. But I don't trust a CEO growing rich off my suffering either.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 So your problem with the government's response to a crisis was that they didn't do anything...which made it worse
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Two problems with this: 1) the war on drugs was instigated by republicans and 2) if your position is that cronyism is government choosing economic winners, there needs to be an economic entity that wins. Parties are political entities.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 ...but he didn't handle it
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Where is there? Not every black community was affected in the same way. And a disinclination to open a new store doesn't account for the fact that there's a void there in the first place. Who benefits from the lack of commerce in that scenario?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 The government didn't handle it, though. There were slums all over the country named after a president who chose to stfu
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 I hear you speaking in broad strokes and I don't disagree that the war on drugs was an attack on the black community. I'm waiting for you to make the connection between a grocer's inability to open a store in a particular area and cronyism.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 A fair point, but the implication of the original tweet is that government involvement is causal. That disaster happened without the government pulling the strings.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Go on
Is it really only Tuesday?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 DO you think Black Tuesday was a result of anarchy? Or is that the fault of the government?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Which is? Subsidies? Property taxes? Sanitation requirements?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 You haven't identified "the problem" of which you speak. My problem with the original post was the implication that the singular obstacle to a capitalist utopia is the presence of government. I don't think it's wise to not acknowledge that capitalism itself has its dangers.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 That's like noticing that hospitals often contain a lot of sick people. That doesn't mean the hospital is to blame. Are you saying that the government does something to prevent companies from opening grocery stores in those places?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 For what obstacles am I fighting?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Cable companies also control internet, which is why the hotspot was my only viable alternative. But not every scenario can wait for a cheaper alternative. In food deserts, for example, consumers can't afford t wait for someone to decide to open a new grocery.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 What's stopping me is a legit factor. You assume the other company starts with no obstacles. You also assume a company sells one product instead of many and that people will be aware of their options in time for this second business to survive and become significant competition
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Assuming the person has network coverage and an unlimited data plan.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Can you be more specific? I'm seeing obstacles to production that I'll need more barrow parameters to bypass them.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Not everywhere. In some places, the only alternative is tethering to a mobile hotspot.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Cable companies don't have to follow either of those rules. They don't need to change prices if they no consumers have no alternative.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 The mixture of socialism and capitalism that we have now is because people were suffering under the economy as it was. Black Tuesday wasn't a result of socialism but a cause for it.	Remaining competitive is only a concern when there's competition. A monopoly assumes there is none
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 This is something once they establish themselves as a monopoly, not as they pursue monopoly status.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 The good thing about enterprise is competition. Monopolies eliminate competition, making way for companies to do whatever they want. They can impose high prices, give crappy service, let go of quality, etc, and not suffer for it because consumers have no option.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 "interfering with alternatives" is extremely vague. Can you elaborate?	My point was more that capitalism doesn't just exist free of cronyism. It isn't that cronyism taints capitalism, it's that cronyism is a side affect that capitalism risks.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 So your position now is that monopolies are innocuous. Okay. How did the government interfere on behalf of Standard Oil?
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Large companies have the means to become monopolies by pushing out smaller companies. That means isn't dictated by the government; it's a benefit of their size. They may also use the influence of the government, but that isn't the only tool in their box.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 I disagree. The anti-trust laws are all about protection from monopolies. When large companies offer lower prices because they're able to cut corners through their connections, or sabotage business ties, that isn't solely on the government.
https://t.co/w2Vj8F4MQF
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Free markets allow larger business to stifle the success of smaller business without consequences. Large businesses don't necessarily need the help of government cronies.
@Providence1775 @Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 I somewhat agree with you (substituting "power" for "influence") that the legislature has influence of interest to large businesses. But the reasons large businesses (or rich individuals) are able to influence legislators is that there's no check on their accumulation of wealth.
@Gabby_Hoffman @resurgent @Ocasio2018 Crony capitalism is free enterprise. Free enterprise is what allows crony capitalism to thrive. 	Your assertion about the uplifting power of capitalism lacks context.

@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis I did. Next I may assume your gender. Are you claiming you don't care about the thing that you keep bringing up?
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis No it's not, because I agreed to that already and then you went off on whether he's terminal or not..
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis I don't know why you're arguing a point that you, yourself said doesn't matter. But since we're here, did the Italian doctors make some claim that they could diagnose him?
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis Those are literally the only two options. Either he's terminal, or he's treatable. If he's not terminal, he's treatable. And lots of people make last ditch efforts on terminal patients. Charlie Gard was terminal, but offered an experimental treatment.
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis It doesn't matter to me. As I said, parents with a terminal child should be allowed to try everything. But since you claimed that he was supposedly treatable, I would like to know more about that. It would certainly tip the scale on the interest of the child.
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis So the Italian government thought he had something treatable? On what basis?

@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis Oh? What was their diagnosis?
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis "Anything" is pretty broad. I think we can agree there are things the government takes care of.
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis I do know. I also know the child was terminal, so by "everything" you mean hospice care. But I do think people with a terminal child should be able to exhaust every possible avenue. That includes people who don't have thousands of dollars on hand.
@newroadkill @hairyhilarity @owillis That depends on some nice donors being willing to pay for treatment (assuming treatment is available) elsewhere. That's a big "if" that doesn't apply to most people. Why are you willing to take your chances? Do you already have donors lined up?

@NoRiskNoReward0 @SophiaHelwani 1. Yes, though a less effective one. 2. I lean toward intent. I wouldn't call an accidental discharge an act of violence. 3. Yes.
@NoRiskNoReward0 @SophiaHelwani I'm using violence and weaponry in tandem. Weapons are tools for violence. Now, if you own a weapon (such as a gun), purely as a symbol, you have found an alternative use for it, but not a practical one.
@NoRiskNoReward0 @SophiaHelwani Eh. I'll give you 3. I'm not sold on the idea of non-violent killing. Violence with skill is still violence. Exercising your right to a weapon doesn't make it less a weapon. Assuming you won't have to use it, you've now expanded the uses to violence and the threat of violence.

Did a Kennedy just refer to people "at the top" in third person? Does he know what he comes from?
Joe's speech is already too soft and too slow...get to the point.

@ABFalecbaldwin I'm pretty sure Mayella's tears were actually fear that her father (who sexually abused her) would punish her for allow Atticus to argue that she'd been attracted to a white man. If Dylan is Mayella, she's a victim.
@RealJack and that whole pyramid thing
