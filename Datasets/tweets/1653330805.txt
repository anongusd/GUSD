@JesseRikart @KamalaHarris There were trolls on FB telling me "You can't be an American-you're a QUEER."
@JesseRikart @KamalaHarris This is REMINDING ME of that Jefferson/Jackson dinner in Iowa during the 08 primaries. It's Kamala's for the asking, IMO. I'd like to add that issues of sexual orientation ALSO have a lot to do with what happened. 1. was race, but 2. was LGBT rights.

He overheard two SS men talking about the function of the new camp, and when he heard what they had to say, he knew what to do. 	He proceeded to make the sign over the entrance, but there was one 'mistake' he made. The upside down B in the sign was A WARNING, not a mistake.
'Work makes you free' in German. However, the man who made the sign above the front gate of Auschwitz, had 1) been in the Polish resistance and 2) KNEW GERMAN. He worked in the metal shop.
Auschwitz-Birkenau took the old phrase they used at the front gates of Dachau, one of the first concentration camps in Germany, which he administrated. Arbeit Macht Frei.
Here is a seemingly unknown story I first heard in the epic BBC documentary "Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State." 	There is a unique feature to the front gate of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The B in Arbeit is upside down. It's known that Rudolf Hoess, the man who was the comendant of

@robinskyleigh @RealEcumenist GOOD. That happened to me after my mom passed away. My sister and brother in law had the GOOD SENSE to put me in a public continuation school. From there, I went to the regular high school that I would graduate from in 1984.
@RealEcumenist @robinskyleigh Oh, my...talk about CULTURE SHOCK...To go from Lakewood to NOR CAL? Wow.
@AnWallaceWriter @robinskyleigh @BlindBuster NOT a surprise. I have dyscalculia too. The ONLY person in my "Christian" school who would work with me was my 5th grade teacher. Same with my 6th grade. They never took away all my books, because my mother would have told them to go to hell, but I was fortunate in that regard.
@AndrewFrisbie05 @robinskyleigh @spatial_anomaly Hey, after my mother passed on (chirrosis of the liver-she was a BAD alcoholic) in 1980, I went to public school. Sure, it was a culture shock, but I soon got over it. Happily, I integrated pretty well with my fellow students and teachers.

@trabopoline @timdillinger Oh, hey..GET THIS: The 'Christian' school I was at had  flag football, too. I always wondered why they didn't do tackle. Didn't have to play vollyball in coulottes, fortunately. WE had the white cafeteria worker blouses and ichy nylon shorts.
@timdillinger I was sent home for wearing Toughskins, but NONE of the Seventh or Eigth Grade girls wore Dittoes EVERY FUCKING DAY to that school, and NONE of them were ever sent home. Period.
@timdillinger Oh, hell. At the 'Christian' K-8 school I went to, we had to sing 'America The Beautiful' followed by 'Onward Christian Soldiers' after the Pledge Of Alligance in Friday Chapel service. This SAME SCHOOL that sent me home one day because I wore Toughskins.
@adtimmswt @LeeUniversity Oh, hey..there was ONE school I almost went to where I was presented with that kind of thing..I was 13 IN EIGHTH GRADE. The reason I even WANTED to go to that school was that my best friend at the time also went to that school. My mother (bless her) refused to sign the thing.
@sarahjeanquinn Yup. However, I had the GOOD SENSE to drop that class. The only reason I was able to muddle through the first half of said Anthro classwas the fact that I had gone to two public high schools in adolescence.
@mikamassage YIPES. That's something MY Christian school NEVER did. Glad I escaped THAT. Of course, I went to that school in the 1970's before that piece of crap was ever released or thought of.

@SusanChandler5 @monolithimmort LOL, YOU TOO? My 'christian' school showed the SEQUEL to us one day in Chapel service. Had nightmares FOR MONTHS about it.
@ashtonpittman Honey, I got that shit, too. Never mind the fact that it came from some of my classmates, and NEVER from a teacher or headmistress. that's fucking horrible, and I'm sorry you had to go through that.

At this point, I'm crossing my fingers that Senator Kamala Harris will make a run for it. But-like I've said, we'll see.
OK, REMEMBER THIS, FOLKS: There were TEN people who announced they were running for President in 2007-2008, and even though GW Bush was not that great, he was NOT the Orange Menace. The ones who announce early usually drop out of the race before the Iowa Caucuses, so REMEMBER.
@leahmcelrath Hey, we're BOTH sober 28 years! I STILL can't believe I've been sober for so LONG. :)	Keep coming Back-IT WORKS!
@MarciAlegant @leahmcelrath In Long Beach, CA my sober friends and I would get together for a New Year's dance sponsored by the local gay Alano club. They serve Martinelli's sparkling apple cider. Man, I love that stuff.
@iris_rhonda @KamalaHarris HERE is the last item that should be on this thread: You not only have as Iris aptly put it, the smarts, the voice and the strength, you have THE EXPERIENCE. Go for it, Senator. I'll HAPPILY vote for you, as I did for President Obama.
DAMN. I JUST REALIZED why Warren declared early. Mainly because the Soviet tool (Bernie) is 'thinking about it', and Hillary has already said she'll wait it out.
OK, having consulted Wikipedia, there were TEN candidates running in the Presidential primaries in 2008. Mind you, we've got a LONG way to go before the actual race begins. But, don't be too surprised if there are ten (OR MORE) Democrats that run. Trump is THAT vulnerable.
@tweetmommybop Hon, like I've said SEVERAL times this morning, let's wait and see. The first ones to announce usually get picked off in Iowa. Unless they're Barack Obama.

@Stop_Trump20 Besides, the first ones to announce don't last until the Iowa Caucuses, so we'll see.
@Stop_Trump20 Remember, George W. Bush was vulnerable to defeat in '08, and let's remember the ass kicking the GOP got in 2006. Trump is JUST, IF NOT MORE vulnerable.
@Stop_Trump20 I'm taking a 'wait and see' attitude towards it. I was one of the people who thought She'd run in 2016, but she went to the sidelines. So, I understand why she's doing it NOW. If anyone remembers 2008, you know it was a pretty crowded field at first.
@Freeyourmindkid So does Tammy Duckworth, although she's FULL BLOODED.
@Freeyourmindkid Hey, I'm a quarter Cherokee myself. I'm cool with it. At least she DOES mention that she's got Native American ancestory.
OK everyone..REMEMBER, THE FIRST ONE TO ANNOUNCE IS USUALLY NOT THE NOMINEE. We have a PRIMARY system for a REASON. Who announced first in 2008? Does anyone remember?
OK, y'all. First one out of the gate is ELIZABETH WARREN. 	Anyone think Kamala will announce? The only reason Liz didn't run in 2016 is because Hillary wanted to run, and everyone knew that. What do you guys think?

at the condition of the GOP today. He probably would have changed his political affiliation. Mr. H is just one of many Republicans I've known-AND LOVED- during my years in recovery. Many of them I've looked up to, not for their political affiliation, but their behavior.
Mr. H, as we in recovery put it, "walked his talk". He didn't give a rat's ass if you were gay, straight, or in between. He treated everyone as he would have wanted to be treated. He would have been legitimately appalled
pardoned Richard Nixon. He said President Ford was pressured to do it, against his best instincts. He also said President Ford never wanted to be President.
I've been friends with MANY Republicans throughout the years. For instance: A guy I'll call Mr. H. Mr. H was a guy many people loved. He was friends with Betty Ford, knew President Ford, and would vacation with them and their family. I did ask him once why President Ford
What is REALLY SAD about this situation is how the GOP is acting right now. Like, "We're in the majority. If you don't like it, tough shit". Actually, because of my membership in a certain organization of people who are anonymous (And I don't mean THAT anonymous)

Just consider what I'm saying, here. this WHOLE SCENARIO is a hunch I have.
Watergate happened in a time that was a LOT more rowdy than our time now. BUT-If it plays out the way Watergate did, there would be no pitchforks or torches, right?
After Cox was fired, Nixon lost most of his Cabinet, including Spiro Agnew, who had to resign. And YES, I think Pence is the new Agnew. This is ALL going down in a way that recalls Watergate. Yes, it's MORE serious than Watergate, but consider this theory.
In addition to what I said yesterday, keep this in mind: History DOES have a nasty habit of repeating itself. SO, what do I think will happen? Expect another Saturday Night Massacre, just like what happened in 1974, with Rosenstein being the Archibald Cox of the situation.
GUESS WHAT, GUYS? There's going to be another Saturday Night Massacre, ala Watergate. I feel it in my bones. IF Rosenstein is fired, Sessions will resign. Followed by most of the Orange Menace's cabinet. MARK MY WORDS.
@DogginTrump Honey, it's NOT a hypothetical. THE GAME IS REALLY AFOOT.
That's why I predict a Warren/Harris ticket in 2020. That's why I'm predicting the way I do. Now that Russia's gotten slapped down (for now) The country is going to swing left, rather than right. This is our moment. It's up to us what we do with it.
Thanks to their choice of Trump, the GOP is going to be a far-Right FRINGE party, same as the Greens and Peace and Freedom here in California. Those parties CONSTANTLY get their collective ass kicked in every election. So will the GOP.
Now that we've had 2 long, HORRIBLE years of the Orange Menace fucking up all over the place, the pendulum is swinging firmly to the LEFT and will stay there for some time. That's why I'm making the predictions that I do.
OK, everyone..here's why I voted yes on that question. Society's basically a pendulum. First it swings one way, then the other.
@kate_woolsery @ChasingOzPhotog @realDonaldTrump Yup, I agree the GOP committed Seppoku (Japanese for suicide), but I personally think campaigning for  assholes (who hate ANYONE who isn't white, male or heterosexual) did NOT help.

@inMOMniac @leeleeb50 @JacsKrakrs1 OR, there is another option, here. Hillary. Now, Hillary's got a lot of baggage-90% of it LIES by the GOP on her character and competence. If I were her, with an eye on 2023-I would commission a media project (Maybe a documentary) exposing all of those lies for what they are.
So, I would NOT be surprised if the GOP goes the way of the old Whig party, or the Know-Nothings of the 1900's.
people, Asian people, etc. 	3) be accessible. Try to appeal to AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. Don't just reach out to the straight white male-Reach out to everyone, by putting their support behind the Equality Agenda. How hard is THAT? Personally, I don't think they will do this...
1) GET RID of the fringe elements/Trumpists. DO IT NOW. If they don't, they will be relegated to Green Party status. Relevant (But not really) in one or two states. 	2) Have a platform of REAL policy initiatives. Stuff like support for the equality of women, Black people, LGBTQ
Let's say the GOP survives this without getting banned. At this point, the GOP is a FRINGE PARTY. It would take at LEAST a few years for them to regain their lost reputation as an actual political party run by ACTUAL ADULTS. Here's how I think they can rebuild:

@ismandel @krassenstein Just a hunch I have that since this investigation started BEFORE 2016. It's been going on for awhile. Remember that W. Bush (and Condi Rice) had suspicions about Putin in 2008. They KNEW the SOB was up to something-they just didn't know WHAT.
@hoeifip @krassenstein Naah. More like 6 MONTHS.
@TheLongCon777 @SpringPeony21 @jhund60 @krassenstein Personally, I don't think that'll happen. THESE PEOPLE ARE BULLIES. We all know what bullies secretly are...COWARDS. They'll back down the moment they are confronted.
IF my theory holds up-and I'm confident it will-that this whole investigation into Russian hacking of our election actually started three years earlier, then I suspect Mueller has ALL THE EVIDENCE, and won't be rushing, but won't be dilly dallying around, either. ;)
@bellichka @krassenstein I did the math, and it's been three years since the TOTAL investigation started. I say TOTAL, because some people had an inkling of it, but not the actual FACTS. Someone had a damn good hunch, and ordered an investigation (and you guys can guess who it was.) :)
@Lee1865 @jhund60 @krassenstein Mueller's been working on this for quite awhile. I'd say he started this in 2015, which is WHY they have pretty much everything they need to nail Trump's ass to the prison's door. Considering the FACT that he's been a KGB asset since 1987, it's probable THEY HAVE EVERYTHING.
I don't think you guys understand the full EVIL the Orange Menace represents. THIS ASSHOLE IS COLD EVIL. All he needs is time, and our freedoms will be ALL GONE. That's why Mueller needs to HURRY THE FUCK UP. NOW.
@kay_merlino @jhund60 @krassenstein Yeah, that's true..this makes Watergate look like two kids having a tea party and playing pattycake by comparison. Let's ALSO realize the Internet was still a secret in 1972.
@jhund60 @krassenstein Actually, Janet Mueller's been working on this since 2017. Around May, to be exact-the time that Comey was fired. So, I'd say he hasn't rushed ANYTHING at all.

The FBI needs to FINISH THE JOB begun with COINTELPRO. THAT is only going to happen once the Orange Menace is out of the WH, but it does need to be done. Just a reminder to certain people out there. ;)
COINTELPRO was so efficient, the Radical Left 'defected' to the GOP. Which means, there's a LOT of '60's Radical Lefties in the GOP to this very day. Dershowitz, for one. Anyway, this, I suspect, is what is needed to fix the mess the USA finds itself in NOW.
Democratic Party. That was done during the Nixon Administration, and continued into WELL after Watergate. The Radical Left of the late '60's was funded/encouraged by the USSR, mainly because they shared the same ideology.
1. A reverse COINTELPRO is in order, here. For those of us who don't know what COINTELPRO was, A quick overview for you: COINTELPRO was the secret FBI investigation/infiltration of the late 1960's Radical Left that decimated that particular part of the (sorry to say)

And, NOT every gun owner is stupid. I grew up around guns. Granted, there were NO guns like an AR-15 in my home.
@AlvardoMitchell @MattxRed Honey, that's NOT what this is about. Most gun owning civilians with a brain AGREE there needs to be a change in the laws regarding guns. I've spoken with a few myself. It's NOT about 'removing firearms from civilians' it's about FIXING THE LAWS.

More like "this is what you GET when you act like an asshole". This would drive the number of such incidents down. NO, not advocating violence, but some of these people are BEGGING to get their ass whooped.
OK, the NEXT time some ignorant asshole (AKA Trumpist) decides to flap their big mouths to an innocent person minding their OWN BUSINESS (aka someone in the minority, such as a person of Latinx decent, or someone who identifies as LGBTQ) They should be made examples of.
OK, Here's the reason Asshole Central is freaking out: Mueller's got 'em cornered. He's going to zap them with subpoenas and indictments and SEARCH WARRANTS  GALORE. He's getting CLOSER, AND THEY KNOW IT. This is the reason why the Trumpists are pitching fits right now.

But it wasn't. So, LET'S DO IT NOW. Restore FAIRNESS to our national discourse. Restore the Fairness Doctrine, and make news strictly non partisan. NO "networks" devoted to one side or the other. NO 24 hour news cycle. Get rid of it ALL.
Fortunately for the United States, that didn't happen. NOW, we get the chance to REVERSE a HUGE mistake in this country's history, and rebuild the Fourth Estate of American journalism. It's not hard. We can do this. It SHOULD have been done during the Obama Administration
Getting back to the subject of restoring the Fairness Doctrine: The ONLY thing a 24 hour news cycle ACTUALLY DOES is spread extremist propaganda. All you have to do is look at the 1990's in order to see that. We ALL thought the US was disintegrating into a civil war back THEN.

@ladyhawkerfinds @PressSec OK, I've been told by my sister these facts: 1) there IS a Red Hen Restauraunt in Lexington, Virginia, and 2) Ms. Sanders was politely asked to leave said establishment by their management. She's GOD DAMN lucky she wasn't chased out by angry patriots like Biondi was.

The reason I mentioned Citizens United and paper ballots rather then the Electoral College is very simple. If the threat of attack on the electoral system is removed, then the Electoral College will be safer.
Switching to paper ballots rather than computers to handle US elections would not only protect our electoral system from attack, it would be MUCH less expensive than having all those computers running at once. So, think of it this way-Use paper, save the country.
to hack into our grid? OF COURSE NOT.  That's the issue, here. Secondly, fix our antiquated election laws. First thing that needs to go is Citizens United, followed by ALL vote tracking systems done by computer. The only "technology " needed would be a pen and paper.
First of all, STOP the importation of any and all technology made in the US. Yeah, I know-that might be more on the impossible scale, BUT- Let's say the Russians didn't have American technology at their disposal during the 2016 election-Do you think they would have been able

the long-time LGBT rights activist, was the one to take the sign down, and ironically, it hung in his HOUSE for many years. That particular sign is on display at the ONE Gay and Lesbian Archives at USC here in Los Angeles. So, any "celebration" of the SCOTUS ruling should
That policy at Barney's Beanery was SO HATED by the City Council of Weho, they basically came to Barney's EN MASSE to see that sign taken down, and it INCLUDED the first Lesbian to be mayor of Weho, Valerie Terrigno. Morris Kight,
What ended up happening was that the City Council of West Hollywood passed an airtight non-discrimination law, which SPECIFICALLY targeted Barney's, And was also a warning to any other Weho business that wanted to follow in their bigoted footsteps. Let's put it this way:
The guy who founded and owned the restaurant in West Hollywood called Barney's Beanery was a homophobe. He HAD  a sign in his establishment saying thusly:"FAGOTS-STAY OUT". For YEARS LGBT activists tried to get this particular sign-AND policy-relegated to the ashbin of history.
Giving you guys just a LITTLE BIT of SoCal history, here. I LIVED through this time. Wasn't fucking pleasant, believe me. From the time I came out as a lesbian in 1987, to 1993, when this particular incident was going on, was very unpleasant. You think TRUMP'S America is bad? Try
Oh, boy...IS THAT ASSHOLE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT OR WHAT? He's basically admitting "Christians" are bigots like he is.

@KatKartoons @gary_w_foster @ChargeTheMoundx Yup. I TOTALLY understand what you're saying, Katie. BULLYING is just as a reality in this country as guns are. I personally think that requiring guns to be regulated in the same way as cars are would go a long way to returning common sense to guns.
@shownbone @gary_w_foster @ChargeTheMoundx Hmm. Actually, I DO think that writing/passing laws that would put guns in the same catagory AS CARS (Meaning, licensing/registration and insurance) could go further to solve the gun problem as any.
@gary_w_foster @ChargeTheMoundx GOOD. I'm all for looking for a SOLUTION to the problem. We have a huge problem with guns in this country. I know that, and so do you. Thing is, what to do about it? I'm NO gun-grabber, by any stretch of the imagination. Guns are a reality in this country.
@gary_w_foster @ChargeTheMoundx Guns for hunting? Sure. A handgun for protection? Yeah, that's OK. BUT, a military style weapon designed to kill as many people as possible? Your'e a sensible guy. Think on that for a bit.
@gary_w_foster @ChargeTheMoundx Right. Reports are that he stole the AR-15. BUT-Gary, THINK. What wouldv'e happened if that gun had been safely in a lock box? I have many friends in the military who say VERY bluntly that no civilian has any business owning an AR-15, or an AK-47, for that matter.

@snapp_mary @GymCastic I've had the pleasure of meeting Rhonda Faehn face to face. It doesn't seem like she'd be the person to merrily go about her own business during a major disaster like THIS one.

@snapp_mary @GymCastic Right. I'll give you that. However, Rhonda was AWARE of what was up. And let's face it, THIS IS USAG. They are a provincial 'organization' dedicated to THEIR OWN ENDS. They don't give a flying fuck about those kids. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS, and I'm sure Rhonda knows this too.

@GaryCVB Actually, it's NOT about restrictions. It's about REGULATIONS. Say, there was a law that stated that gun owners had to register their guns, and then take a test asking them how best to safely use their gun. Is that a restriction or a regulation? I'd say it's the latter.

I want to be part of the SOLUTION to the problem. Problem is: WAY TOO MANY MASS SHOOTINGS. That, folks, is the problem.
There is an old saying in the rooms of the 12 Step program I participate in: 	You can either be one of two things: 	A) A part of the PROBLEM 	B) A part of the SOLUTION.
OK..I've been thinking about the proposal to regulate guns in a similar way to cars. And, I've expanded on it. I suspect this proposal is something that would be favored by SENSIBLE members of the opposition, mainly because it's not about a GOVERNMENT solution to the problem.
OK, I just had an idea. What if guns were regulated in a way similar to CARS?	Meaning, that gun owners had to buy licenses and insurance? That way, people would have access to guns, but would have to operate them in a responsible fashion?
OK, everyone..it's not about REPEAL. Nobody WANTS to repeal the 2A. NOBODY. It's about REGULATION. Stricter laws REGULATING guns. Most gun owners (with some intelligence) would agree that there DO need to be some regulations on guns, specifically the military-style ones.
RT @MillenPolitics: It‚Äôs been a few days since we‚Äôve had a mass shooting (thankfully). 		RT if you think now seems like a good time to talk‚Ä¶
@blaubok @PaulMayATL Yeah, COMMON USE guns. Meaning, HANDGUNS. Or rifles, if someone's a hunter. That's perfectly fine. Don't have a problem with those. Military style weapons like an AR-15 or an AK-47? those are entirely different, IMO.
@blaubok @PaulMayATL OK, I DID forget the Militia Acts of 1792 and 1795. This kind of shines a new light on this whole 2A thing. Problem is, what would be considered a WELL REGULATED Militia?
@blaubok @PaulMayATL I did THAT too. I've also read the Federalist Papers, specifically 46 and 48. More versed on World War II, but it never hurts to pay attention in History class to the Revolutionary War &amp; War of 1812.
@blaubok OK, I looked it up. The Constitution itself was ratified in 1778. This is from the National Constitution center blog. Before then, the country was ran on the Articles of Confederation.
@blaubok 1. I might have a bit of weight on me, but don't get your hopes up. I don't date stupid women, either. Now, COME ON. Your retort was just as CHILDISH as mine was. Sure, I got the dates wrong, but I was UNDER THE IMPRESSION that the 2A was written in around 1778 to 1779 or so.

@blaubok @PaulMayATL That was a ban on HANDGUNS, NOT AR-15'S. Nice try. Scalia DID say that OWNING a handgun wasn't the problem. The problem is someone owning a KILLING MACHINE DESIGNED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. Besides, isn't a handgun a common use firarm?

@RosarioKKYLIE Now, I know of NO Democrat who wants one party in power. If the GOP cares more about what 'team' they are on, rather than the welfare of the COUNTRY, That's what will happen. That's what HAS to happen. I am a supporter of a TWO party system, where both parties work together.
@RosarioKKYLIE When both parties UNITED to pass bills that they agreed upon. YES, it's gotten worse, and now, in my humble opinion, it's the Republicans who have gotten FAR worse. Most Democrats ARE willing to cross the aisle to garner GOP votes. But NOW? It's an impossibility.
@RosarioKKYLIE OK..I remember when politics in this country wasn't a blood sport. When it didn't matter what 'team' you were on, it only mattered what you could do to improve the country. When Republicans and Democrats  united to pass bills BOTH sides agreed upon.
