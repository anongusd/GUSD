@nirav_nirav If your cruise does not have any U.S. ports, you do not need a U.S. visa. If it does have U.S. ports, you will need a valid U.S. visa if you are not eligible for the Visa Waiver Program.

@writerslife22 Don't be concerned. For efficiency, cards are often printed from a specific Dept. of State location that is different from where your book is processed and/or printed. Hence, separate mailings are likely. Generally, they are mailed within 10 days of eachother.
@dooley7uga No need to worry. The check is cashed in the first step of processing your application. For routine service, there could be 4-6 weeks of processing remaining. For expedited service, the application should be processed 3 wks or less from the date the check's cashed.

@kkwisdom11 Plenty of time, indeed. Since you upgraded to expedite on 2/9, if your applications are complete and correct, the passports should be issued this week. Check the status online https://t.co/RwGw42VS0S this week. If you do not see a change by Monday, contact NPIC.

Many roads have debris &amp; rock throwing from small groups is likely in numerous areas. Avoid demonstrations &amp; large gatherings. https://t.co/YEmae2nIql
@IzzatSE No need. Renew by mail using routine service to save $60 and complete the process in 4-6 wks. Passport agencies are reserved for emergency travel needs - you must pay the $60 expedite fee, present proof of travel in 2 weeks/visa need in 4 weeks, and make an appointment.
Even if an item is allowed on a plane or in your checked baggage, it may be prohibited on your cruise. Check your cruise line’s prohibited items list before you attempt to board. https://t.co/0DN1EUHQLa #TravelWell https://t.co/LzO0Cq3I1d
Watch out for scams that target tourists while you are overseas - for example, be careful of the “teahouse scam” if you are headed to Thailand. Check common scams for your destination at https://t.co/JeUUxsLC0G. #TravelWell #SpringBreak https://t.co/DwQzW1Zz1i
@zack_ericsson See https://t.co/ottJ1maGLx to extend the validity of a limited passport. A passport reported as "not received" may be replaced with a new passport. The expiration date in a new adult passport is generally 10 yrs from the date the original passport was issued.
Check what medical services are available on your cruise ship before you set sail. Make sure you have medical coverage as part of your travel insurance and bring your passport book in case you need to fly elsewhere for assistance. https://t.co/0DN1EUqfmA #TravelWell https://t.co/wHo3ifinrv
@mamaji Thanks for the kind wishes! As for your application, it would be best to provide an alternate form of U.S. citizenship evidence, like your U.S. birth or naturalization certificate or another expired U.S. passport that has never been reported lost.

If you’re traveling abroad for Spring Break, know ahead of time how you will stay in touch with your friends. Group messenger apps are good for staying in contact. #TravelWell #SpringBreak https://t.co/qy1VS9zCgK
@harmonmarkets Yes! We strongly encourage everyone to bring their passports o a cruise, even if not required. Safe travels!
@Galactoise You would need to check with the airline on their policy, but we generally suggest having six months validity remaining on your passport because some countries (for example, the UK) require it. For Mexico, your passport only needs to be valid at the time of entry.
Waiting at the airport for your Spring Break trip to begin? Download or screenshot maps of your destination before you go. Cell service and free Wifi can be unreliable while traveling. #TravelWell #SpringBreak https://t.co/tKLYGnW6yD
Your cruise may be all expenses paid, but an emergency can make it unexpectedly costly. Get travel insurance that covers medical evacuations and other emergencies. https://t.co/0DN1EUHQLa #TravelWell https://t.co/SHn8SMUYaY
Double check your passport’s expiration date. If you applied for your most recent passport before you turned 16, your passport may be expired! Minor passports are valid for 5 years. #TravelWell #SpringBreak https://t.co/wvokHyjnMx
@stoverjd @IDAHOgov Yes, requirements must be followed, but individual cases can vary. Example: An applicant under age 16 who presents a U.S. passport as proof of citizenship must also provide something like a birth certificate that lists the parent's name for consent purposes.
#Peru: Demonstrations are expected to take place on February 11 and February 12, 2019, beginning at 12:00 pm in three separate locations within #Cusco – Tika Tika, Penal Qenqoro, and Tupac Amaru Plaza. https://t.co/yby0CK8Ok6
@OFridaMoncadaO If you have valid C1/D, you may use it to transit the US en route to a destination.  This visa is valid for immediate/continuous transit through the US. If you seek a layover for purposes like sightseeing, you must qualify for the visa required for that purpose.
@gantman Done! Please DM us.
@Galactoise Mexico only requires that U.S. passport holders' passports be valid at the time of entry. Here is the country page for Mexico, where you can see entry/exit requirements: https://t.co/7x0N8ZYXf3
#Venezuela: Demonstrations are scheduled to take place throughout Venezuela on February 12 and may continue in the following days. The movement of U.S. government personnel will be restricted to the vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in #Caracas. https://t.co/BfJCl6B4Jj
@Galactoise Hi Eric, We're so sorry for the inconvenience today. First question, where are you headed overseas? Your destination may or may not require 6 months validity remaining to enter.
@lulubee017 You will need to apply in person with him at a passport acceptance facility, where you will sign the form. You or your son may print his name in the passport book when you receive it. For more see: https://t.co/Up9xjk3wL1 or watch our video: https://t.co/04fbPsf4mw
@SharpCrawford10 You will need a passport book because you are flying.  If you think you'll travel by land to Canada in the future, consider applying for both at once and save $35. For more see: https://t.co/L5sWHIZvT4

Q8: Finally, what was one of the best experiences you had while on a study abroad trip? #SafeTravelsChat #TravelTuesday https://t.co/jINZD3lApQ
@Safe_Travels_MG Yes, definitely!
A7: Translation apps are useful if you’re not fluent in the local language. Write down key terms like “I need help” in a notes app on your phone or a piece of paper tucked in your wallet in case you need to communicate during an emergency. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/NWJJxglFch
Q7: Do you speak the language of your host country? Will you be taking language classes before or during your study abroad trip? #SafeTravelsChat #TravelTuesday https://t.co/NQmkUNpnJl
Great advice - plan out where you will be staying each night well ahead of time. #SafeTravelsChat #StudyAbroad #GlobalEd https://t.co/l4FNK37bvm

Q6: Are you studying abroad with friends, or will you be headed abroad solo? #StudyAbroad #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/MNuPWkSn8U
@Safe_Travels_MG @Polymathically Researching local laws and circumstances ahead of time is always a good idea! Thanks for joining us!

Q3: Once you are in the host country, how will you get around town? Will you use public transportation? App-based ride share? Does your study abroad program provide transportation options? #SafeTravelsChat #TravelTuesday https://t.co/gxRNbnbMq5
A2: Worried family members sometimes contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate when they haven’t heard from you. Set communication expectations ahead of time and share your itinerary so they can find you in an emergency. #SafeTravelsChat #StudyAbroad https://t.co/dJECT64S2m
Q2: When you arrive in the host country for the first time, you might not have cell or internet service. What are some ways to stay connected, and keep in touch with family and friends back home? #SafeTravelsChat #StudyAbroad #GlobalEd https://t.co/bCebdclPPL

@saforbes88 Ah, yes that’s a good insight too!
@saforbes88 Yep, that’s definitely one to be aware of and watch out for! Thanks for sharing!
@Day_Glow_Eyes Good to know, and to watch out for! Thanks for sharing.
@mwenrelemicah Great question - it happens all over the world, unfortunately. The country pages on https://t.co/iowVxipJPO detail the common scams for that destination. Check them out here: https://t.co/Oub8GsbF7z
@YodasWS That kind of thing happens too frequently. Thanks for sharing!
A8: You can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, and with the FBI at https://t.co/q5X8qSP5RR if you have been the victim of a scam. Bottom line – if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/nuxKOKZBmd
Q8: Finally, what steps do you take if you suspect you're the target of a scam while traveling? #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/SlRvoL3A8D
@sarainitaly That's really tough. It happens all the time!
A7: The “bag watching” scam – stranger asks you to watch his bag, leaves, returns with police or someone posing as police. The bag may contain drugs/illegal items. Scammers then extort money in exchange for police to overlook the incident. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/zBijPSWCKW
Buy medicine only from licensed pharmacies and get a receipt. Do not buy medicine from open markets when traveling overseas. #SafeTravelsChat @CDCtravel  https://t.co/byaP30OJ1l
Q7: Airports, train stations, and large popular tourist destinations are common places for scammers and pickpockets to operate. What measures do you take to keep your bags and personal items secure while traveling? #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/NfByivFpax
A6: A common scam is a lottery scam – the scammer promises prize money, but the victim must pay taxes up-front for winning. Heads up, if you didn’t purchase a lottery ticket in a foreign country, it is highly unlikely you can win a prize. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/fnEawOw1BY
A5: In a grandparent scam, a person contacts relatives claiming to be a grandchild who needs money right away. The scammer asks the victim to keep it secret. If this happens to you, reach out to the relative in need of money to verify. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/pduvccOedU
Q6: What are the most ridiculous claims scammers have made to you regarding money you could potentially earn or win? #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/UnROgmM32v
@johnironmanley Yes, friendly but firm is a good general rule!
@ArleighFrisco Unfortunately tourists are targeted by those types of schemes and scams all over the world. It's good to be aware of that, and hopefully avoid it by researching ahead of time.
Q5: Have any of your older parents been targeted by "grandparent" scams where someone calls claiming to be you? What steps do you take to prevent your older family members from falling victim? #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/cWIJ4aA0PS
A4: The “teahouse" scam: someone offers to show you around, then invites you to enjoy food/drink at a restaurant. You are taken to a back room, and sometimes drinks are spiked. Then you are forced to pay an exorbitant bill before leaving. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/qqE7OkMllc
Q4: Some scams specifically target U.S. citizens traveling overseas. Have you ever been specifically targeted because you are American? #SafeTravelsChat #Travel #Scams https://t.co/xbUHYYcSKB
A3: The drug trafficking scam – the scammer offers a job/opportunity for charity work/requests transport of documents, and gives the victim free luggage containing concealed drugs. These scams often begin as romantic relationships. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/v4vQFSuKnT
Q3: What are some other scams you have seen happen or heard of happening to travelers? #SafeTravelsChat #scams #travel https://t.co/ZyeevMAMHU
A2: A common scam we see is a romance scam. Someone you haven’t met in person offers friendship, romance, or marriage. Be skeptical if he/she asks for money for hospital bills, legal expense, or seems to have many sudden problems overseas. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/lQbguyrc46
Scams targeting those getting medical procedures taken care of abroad can happen. Make sure you do your research! #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/8Uy0hOP688
Q2: Often scams involve romance or friendship with someone overseas that the victim has never met. Has anyone you know been duped by an overseas romance? #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/mpivuh5q4B
A1: Heard of the Turkey Drop Scam? You spot cash on the ground. The scammer picks it up and asks if it's yours. Another person approaches, claiming you're trying to steal it. The two scammers threaten to call police unless you pay them. #SafeTravelsChat https://t.co/K5bJofgF9w

If it's too old it could be rejected, holding up your application processing. https://t.co/RKIC1gFlPY #PicturePerfectPassport https://t.co/wrk0diLz3A
Don't be shy; we need to see your entire head and you must be facing the camera straight on in your passport photo. A photo that is too far away or too close up could delay your application. #PicturePerfectPassport https://t.co/yLfVZ1weUy https://t.co/iLtAKg1L91
@StewDent3 What kinds of records are you referring to?

@danilov24 No, filing an immigrant visa petition does not affect a currently valid B1/B2 visitor visa. The immigrant visa process timeline depends on your country of nationality, the visa bulletin, and other factors. We can't provide an estimate.
Make sure to save phone numbers for the nearest US Embassy and local emergency services before traveling this hurricane season. If phone lines and internet are down after a storm, check radio and television broadcasts for information. https://t.co/uroLxWRz9s  #StormSeason https://t.co/WNrb4qdcZ7
@hh_sharmaji This is a great question for our friends at @customsborder! As long as the visa is still valid you are eligible to arrive at a U.S. port of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the authority on whether you would be granted entry into the U.S.
@danilov24 A US citizen can file an immigrant visa petition for a son or daughter. Since your son is married, you would probably file an F3 (family third preference) petition for your son, his spouse, and his son. Further information here: https://t.co/oAkWQB4leq

@QAnonamama @CDCtravel While we recommend enough medicine to last 2 weeks beyond the intended end date for your trip, we recognize it's not always possible. We encourage you to bring a copy of your prescription in case of emergency.

@bszweda Sounds like you might have some homework after today's chat! Fortunately, a small watertight bag containing copies of travel documents and some cash in the local currency won't take up much room in your luggage and can go a long way in an emergency. #SafeTravelsChat
