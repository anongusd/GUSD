We must fix the #CharlestonLoophole to keep these weapons from falling into the wrong hands!
#HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.
In 2017, 23% of cases where a gun was transferred to a prohibited purchaser involved someone who had been convicted of domestic violence or who had a restraining order.
This is dangerous and allows people with criminal backgrounds and mental illnesses to become gun owners.
The #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to purchase a firearm even if their background check has not been completed within the 3-day period.
He used that weapon to murder 9 innocent worshipers at a Bible study at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. 	We must fix the Charleston Loophole now!
In 2015, the #CharlestonLoophole allowed someone with a criminal background to buy a gun even though his background check wasn't completed.

@TheEricaAsh We agree on both fronts. Too many officers graduate from the academy but aren't fit for the job. And the "I feared for my life" standard has resulted in too many unarmed black, brown, and mentally ill folks being killed.
@TamikaDMallory This is why truly independent citizen review boards are needed. Folks need somewhere to turn when the folks who are supposed to protect them abuse their power.
@TamikaDMallory Hollywood, the private sector, and Congress have started purging its bad actors, but law enforcement needs to catch up in this regard. This applies to both racism and sexism.
@HRC @TransEquality Training is part of it. Too many POs lack the cultural competence needed to do their jobs effectively. That said: POs are legally required to respect the rights of all, so even if they're unfamiliar with certain folks, they should know that those folks' rights are always intact.
@NAACP Over turning state "Stand Your Ground" laws is part of the solution. But also @SCOTUS's Los Angeles County v. Mendez decision and other similar decisions have made it harder to hold police accountable for excessive force.
