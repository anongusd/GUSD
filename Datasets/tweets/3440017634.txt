@natehanco @realDonaldTrump I understand your position, but I can't get onboard with that. Undoubtedly, there are people who willingly break the law, but there are also a lot who want a better life. This means we need reform, but it shouldn't be in the context of treating people &amp; children this way.
@SickNickRules @realDonaldTrump I doubt that. He's using a sensitive issue for political gain. However, there are a lot of people who want to mitigate illegal immigration and they should be heard. More importantly, as a society, we need to intelligently re-define illegal immigration and uniform enforcement.
@natehanco @realDonaldTrump That's a valid question. Non-violent people should be kept with their families. Many foreigners don't fully understand our immigration laws and are desperate to leave their countries. Thusly, we should treat them more humanely. Certainly we should let families stay together.
Securing our borders doesn't come from walls &amp; guards. It comes from economic &amp; diplomatic engagement with our southern neighbors to help them make a country worth staying in. Since @realDonaldTrump is gutting our @StateDept &amp; raising unnecessary tariffs, this will be unlikely.

@baekboel I agree, however this can‚Äôt happen w/o the emergence of an ultra left wing movement similar to a leftist tea party. Such a movement would give a perspective that brings people to the center. Otherwise a centrist party would seem comparatively far left and thusly turn voters off.
