@NefariousNewt We should raise taxes on the wealthy, but we can't get *all* the revenue that way.		Look to countries that already have single-payer as an example. Or look at Social Security and Medicare. They all have to tax the middle class to some degree.
This is why I'd prefer to start with Medicaid buy-in and gradually subsidize it until it becomes free. Lets people opt into the system, or continue their old coverage, plus it costs much less up front and while taxes would have to go up some, there's no one year of sticker shock.
The first step would be to enact all-payer rate setting, so the cost of care itself is reigned in. Then you raise payroll taxes. If all goes well, you wouldn't have to raise them by as much as people, on average, were paying in premiums, but young, healthy people might pay more. https://t.co/Ta5W9qQk7m

Good catch. My point still stands though: a better reading of the political climate is, both parties are open to criminal justice reform, and have made strides at the federal and state level, but most of the holdouts remain in the GOP. https://t.co/smFKEa3qnu
For another, the bipartisan victory of the FIRST STEP Act shouldn't blind us to the fact that Trump's DOJ is overwhelmingly going backwards on many criminal justice issues, from Controlled Substances Act enforcement to civil forfeiture to reform of forensic science.
For one thing, Republicans never could have passed it without Democratic votes. Every Senate Democrat voted yes. Senate Republicans were split. https://t.co/CdiLIGB36Z

@born2bear True, but my point is that is a symptom, not a cause, of health care being an inelastic good.		People *don't want to know* what it will cost for them to live, they just want to know they're going to. Thus, there is no incentive *not* to be opaque with prices and rip people off.
Once we do that, and once that is the way our health care market works, we can do whatever we want. We could probably enact single-payer at a third the price economists estimate right now!		Also: an all-payer rate setting bill would probably be really popular. Just saying.
We really shouldn't even be talking right now about whether we are going to adopt Medicare for All, Medicaid buy-in or whatever until we solve the much more fundamental issue: the government has to set what health care providers charge.		That's step one.
Universal health care works differently in each country. Some countries have a single-provider system (Britain), a single-payer system (Canada), govt-funded nonprofits (Germany), or insurance markets (Switzerland).		The one thing they all have in common? THE GOVT SETS PRICES.
The upshot of all this is that, unlike a bookstore or an electronics store or a furniture store, a hospital or a drug company can double or triple their price and people barely respond.		THAT is why health care costs make no sense. Because the market has no incentive for them to.
Moreover, *because* people need health care so urgently, we have laws (like EMTALA) and an ancillary industry of insurance companies, that exist to separate consumers from the price tag they're paying.		So not only do we not care about price, we don't *know* about price.
In most industries, demand is "elastic." If Company A sets the price of a good or service at more than it is worth, people will stop buying it, or take their business to Company B.		Healthcare isn't like that. It's something people die without, and only a few people can provide.
Here's what I mean when I say that health care is an "inelastic good." If you have a medical condition that will kill you, there is no upper limit to the price you will pay for a cure. So there is no market pressure to set the price of that cure at what it is worth.
We need all-payer rate setting, now.		Every other developed nation on earth has figured out health care is an inelastic good and the free market cannot accurately set prices. We aren't fixing anything else about health care in this country until we fix that. https://t.co/uCtx720Y0j

@FungeonMaster1 @TimeLordJeff @Volceltaire Point of order: I never once called Ilhan Omar an antisemite.		I believe she used an unfortunate choice of words, and she didn't fully capture the complexity of Israel politics in the U.S. But I don't think she has animus for the Jewish people in her heart.

I eagerly await the Arkansas GOP's next great idea.		Maybe a bill that bans kids from having medicine if their parents get a call from social services?

I can't think of a single way this idea makes sense.		Studies have repeatedly shown proper nutrition in kids is linked to academic performance. If kids can't eat, the schools' numbers will get even worse!		And the kids are the ones who are already suffering if it's a bad school!
Are you fucking kidding me?		So basically, if a low-income school is struggling because it can't afford to hire good teachers, Republicans' solution is don't let the kids have food?		That's the most nonsensical, depraved, cruel policy I've ever heard. https://t.co/JcaZ9zca6j

@DanielHofheinz Nate Silver was one of the only forecasters who gave Trump a substantial chance of winning ‚Äî and who explicitly said *if* he wins, it would be because he overperforms in the Midwest.		But do go on.
By Nate Silver's estimate, there are 8 states Bernie won where, if you excluded voters who said the Democratic Party is "too liberal," he would not have won.		If you think these voters backed Bernie because they liked Bernie, you're kidding yourself. He was a protest vote.
This isn't to say Bernie doesn't have working-class and rural people who really supported him! He did. But just because Bernie won loads of primaries and caucuses in white, rural, conservative states doesn't mean he would have won white, rural, conservative voters in the general.
I've been saying this for ages. We shouldn't confuse protest votes with actual support. Many "Bernie-Trump" voters were never going to vote for Bernie in the general election ‚Äî they voted for Bernie solely to thumb their nose at Democrats. Open primaries made this easy. https://t.co/PhZrnevKIu

Meanwhile, Thompson's whole thesis is that Riley didn't actually provide a service to BNC worth the compensation, and this was all just a way for @AOC to funnel him money, but nowhere in the article does he provide any evidence for this at all!
Thompson also makes several basic factual errors and leaps of faith in the piece.		He doubles down on his false claim from last week that @AOC put Riley on congressional payroll, and falsely claims that her chief of staff hired him to BNC (which he wasn't leading at the time).

It does not do any of us good when "socialism", uttered in different contexts by people with various political bents, means either nationalized industry and food rationing, Medicare for All, or slightly raising taxes on the rich. It clearly doesn't mean ALL of these things.

@A1tiguyTerry Seems simple to me. You'd just take the Census count for each senator's state, divide it by 2 (since each state has 2 senators), then during cloture votes, note each senator saying "aye" and add their number to the count. If the count passes 163 million, the motion is agreed to.
10/ I want to hear a lot more from Democratic presidential contenders what their plans, if any, are to fix the Senate.		Because if not this idea, then we have to do SOMETHING. /end
9/ I believe if Dems want the Senate to survive as a viable institution ‚Äî and clearly we should all want that! ‚Äî they have to think big but also think smart. A constitutional amendment isn't passing in this environment. But a Dem Senate could enact this rule change by itself.
8/ The only challenge I can foresee is an Article I, Section 3 challenge, since some people might construe this as violating the constitutional mandate of "equal Suffrage in the Senate". But I don't think it does ‚Äî every state still has 2 senators and 2 votes on final passage.
7/ That means two things.		First, it lowers the threshold to end debate, meaning it's harder for individual partisans to blockade the Senate.		Second, it ensures that no bill can be advanced without representation for the majority of the population approving of it.
6/ This brings me to my proposal that, I think, will solve both problems at a stroke.		Change the filibuster so that instead of cloture requiring 60 votes, it requires any group of senators representing a majority of the U.S. population.
5/ Some political experts are worried that absent an urban/rural realignment, this means Dems will never control the Senate again. Even if that's not true though, it means some voters get way more power than others in Senate elections, and that will skew lawmakers' priorities.
4/ Meanwhile, malapportionment of the Senate is going to get worse, as America gets more urban and the Sun Belt states get bigger while the Midwest gets smaller. By 2040, 2/3rds of the population will be represented by 30 percent of the Senate.
3/ If we win the WH and Senate in 2020, the filibuster will prevent us from enacting everything from the Green New Deal to universal health care to reversing SCOTUS' attacks on labor rights, and we may have to cram bits of our agenda into budget bills like the GOP did in 2017.
2/ Right now, the filibuster is Democrats' best friend because it blocks Trump's agenda in a GOP Senate, but from 2009-2015 it basically hobbled a sizeable Democratic majority from doing anything. And we were right to be concerned.
1/ But first, a quick rundown of both of these problems.		The filibuster, the rule that any senator can shut down debate of a bill and 60 votes are needed to end debate, used to only be used in exceptional cases, but now it's used on every bill for partisan reasons.
THREAD:		I think as the Democratic Party discusses the future of governance, it needs to address two major problems: the filibuster, and malapportionment of the Senate.		Both are serious problems and both, I think, actually could be solved by a single, simple rule change.

@Steamboater @AOC The FEC basically has campaigns treat all in-kind contribs as if they were donations of the cash value of that good or service, which was then spent on that good or service.		That way, the value is disclosed to the public, but not counted as cash on hand for the campaign.
Example: suppose I donate 10 bowling balls to @AOC. That would be a roughly $1,000 in-kind contribution. But it's also a disbursement, because I effectively gave her $1,000 and made her "spend" it on 10 bowling balls. So it'll appear on both sides of her ledger.
Oh, and in case you noticed @AOC's committee also shows a "disbursement" of $1,750 to Roberts, that doesn't mean she paid him. The FEC automatically counts in-kind contribs as a disbursement because the "money" on the receipt has already been "spent" by providing the service.
False. The FEC report you're referring to shows Roberts provided digital marketing and web design services to @AOC's campaign in an amount worth $1,750. She didn't pay him anything.		Either you're lying or you just have no idea how to read campaign finance reports. https://t.co/a6mYxw3vKa

@RamonasVoices @davidabatchelor @mkraju @IlhanMN The reason she said that was that Raju had already asked her that exact same question, which she had in turn already answered with a public statement anyway.		At a certain point, you do have to ask why he kept asking her the same thing over and over.
And let me just say that, since the entire controversy started with Omar invoking a harmful stereotype of a minority group, it's a really bad look for @CNN that one of their reporters would do the same in their overzeal to push her for a statement.
I think @mkraju needs to apologize for falsely claiming that @IlhanMN "yelled" at him.		The tape clearly shows she did no such thing. And his tweet enforces dangerous, degrading stereotypes about irrational, angry black women who can't control their tempers.

Many people plan their finances around tax refunds, using them for big purchases or paying off debt. I'm not saying this is sensible, but a lot of us do it.

@orgfarmer The oddest part, for me, is how little these "pro-life" people care about women who want to have babies, but have no access to health care to do so, and so infant and maternal mortality runs rampant. Shouldn't that just objectively be a bigger issue than abortion?
When people say "late term abortion" what they usually mean is anything from 20-35 weeks. Which would be the third and part of the second trimester, and encompass a huge timespan of fetal development, and huge variability in how cases are treated both medically and legally.
We need to stop saying "late-term abortion". There's no such thing as a late-term abortion.		"Late term" describes a pregnancy at 41-42 weeks. No doctor in America performs an abortion at that stage, even for health. That would be a C-section delivery. https://t.co/9gtBzt9NJx

Especially when you step back and realize that the first and foremost reason companies buy back their own stock is to goose the income of their executives. Why are we taking it as a given that it is of any inherent value to the economy for a business to do this?
It's kind of astonishing to see, as a serious argument, that's it's not fair to restrict corporations from spending their profits to artificially jack up their stock price if they don't pay a living wage and benefits, because most of them don't pay a living wage and benefits.
If limiting buybacks to companies that pay a $15/hr min wage, offer 7 days of sick leave, and retirement accounts/pensions to employees would exclude most companies, we should ask why most companies don't offer their workers these things with corporate profits at a record high.

@imoore8904 Yep, my rule would apply to every vote, including executive and judicial nominees.		Trump keeps ramming through judges with senators representing a clear minority of the U.S. population. Under my proposal, he couldn't do that. He'd need consensus from a few of the bigger states.

@huey_duncan I don't inherently have a problem with the filibuster, but I do have a problem with the filibuster being used as a tool to circumvent popular will. I think my solution would ensure the filibuster could only be used if there was a popular mandate for it.
Seems to me that would address the two most immediate problems people have with the Senate: it makes malapportionment matter less, AND it makes it easier to get cloture for major legislation.
That is to say: final passage of a bill will still require 50 +1 votes, and any senator can still filibuster. But for cloture, you count up the number of people represented by each senator voting for cloture and it passes only if the total is more than half the U.S. population.
Here's another idea.		Keep Senate apportionment as it is, and keep the filibuster, BUT change cloture rules so that instead of requiring 60 senators to end debate, it requires any-sized group of senators representing a majority of U.S. voters.

@WhenIs2001 You honestly see our system with much clearer eyes when you realize that the history of America is the Founders not wanting us to have a democracy and the people gradually creating one for themselves anyway.
I think the day I will support totally abolishing (or time-limiting) the filibuster is the day we change the Constitution so that each state gets one senator plus one each per four representatives.
I think everyone, even defenders of the filibuster, recognizes the GOP turned it from a tool of consensus into a tool of obstruction.		The reason I still support having it is because the Senate is a malapportioned body. So a simple majority isn't really the will of the people. https://t.co/VFYso57xkp

We're tired of bombastic right-wing idiots flushing everyone's civil rights and labor protections down the toilet and then telling us to be grateful for all the "jobs," never mind that they don't pay well and have no union or long-term security.
We're tired of being talked down to by politicians and CEOs who were born back when the U.S. had a healthy public sector and welfare state, used both to build their lives, then cut the taxes funding it when it came time to pull their weight and left our generation a mess.
We're tired of being told the only thing that the govt should plan for long term is its own budget deficit, and not climate change, or a world in which people can afford shit.		Especially when they blow up the deficit anyway whenever corporate fat cats want a tax cut.
My generation is not concerned with "socialism". We're concerned we can't afford health care, housing, or education.		We view that as a national crisis, we want the govt to fix it, and we don't want to hear, much less vote for, a party of billionaires lecturing us that we can't.
This has worked for Republicans in the past. It won't work in 2020.		My generation is not triggered by the word "socialism" like Trump's is. And Republicans have spent so many years calling anything they don't like "socialism" they've devalued the word of any fear factor. https://t.co/lQqsAYLkHe

I don't really have an easy answer for the current crop of Virginia Democrats who are facing this problem other than: own up to it, let yourself be accountable, and continue to elect women and POC into your party and leadership who can stop you from being assholes when necessary.
While these social changes transforming VA are clearly bad for the GOP, which has lost 3 straight presidential, 4 senatorial, and 2 statewide elections, it's also going to mean serious growing pains for Democrats. And the GOP happily gets to exploit that for the short term.
That is: there are clearly many people in VA, including liberals, who just decades ago were participating in the pro-Confederate underpinnings the state had for 150 years. And now it's more urbanized, liberal, and embraced the politics of diversity, they are caught flat-footed.
What's happening in Virginia right now is first and foremost a damning indictment of whiteness and patriarchy. But it also reflects a kind of political whiplash of having transformed from a red state to a blue state in a decade.

@SJF1225 Exit polls routinely show voters backing Republican candidates actually prefer the policy positions of the Democratic candidate. And to use @clairecmc's state as an example, Missouri raised the minimum wage even as it elected Trump. Labels do weird things to people's politics.
For instance, you're going to get strong support almost anywhere, even in the Deep South, for raising the minimum wage or taxing income over $10 million. You're going to get almost no support for cutting Social Security, which is often identified as a "moderate" position.
I think it's easy to get results like this when a poll asks about "liberal" and "moderate" in the abstract. But when you start talking specific policies, you'll find that voters strongly prefer policies that make the party more liberal. https://t.co/IWTweiGhQv

@MassivRuss Because Medicaid, in terms of what it covers and how it's administered, looks much more like we would want a universal health care plan to look than Medicare.
Also: once Medicaid buy-in exists in all 50 states, we can eventually turn it into a single-payer system, by gradually subsidizing the Medicaid option more and more until it's free, or costs so much less than the private plans that everyone drops them voluntarily.
Democrats need to unite around Medicaid buy-in.		Like Medicare for All, it can be the basis for universal health care. Unlike Medicare for All, it can be implemented within the current ACA, start without tax increases on the middle class or pushing people off their current plans.

@ArtistGailS This crap reminds me of the Alfie Evans case in the U.K.		Conservatives lied that the NHS put him down to save money. Actually, a child welfare court ruled based on drs who examined him that he was terminal, in extreme pain, and continued care wasn't in his medical interest.
This faux outrage about the Virginia legislation goes to show that the abortion debate is being almost entirely steered by people who aren't doctors, have never even seen an abortion, and don't understand existing medical ethics or why and how women choose to end pregnancies.
There are already fed laws that make these forms of abortion illegal on viable fetuses. @AriFleischer knows that ‚Äî he was WH Press Secretary when the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed.		Even before that law, IDX was used in just 0.17% of abortions and never on viable fetuses.
The gorier methods of abortion in the 3rd trimester that pro-lifers like @AriFleischer are so horrified by, where chemicals are injected to dissolve fetal bones and it's forcibly evacuated, are only used when the woman has already miscarried, or there's a lethal birth defect.
A place to start would be if pro-lifers stopped lying.		No one advocates killing viable fetuses in the 3rd trimester, let alone neonates. If the mother's health is threatened but the fetus is viable, labor is induced early &amp; drs try to save both. The VA bill doesn't change that. https://t.co/4uPwVC232h

We need to recognize that it is inherently a moral problem that more working people don't have the wealth that billionaires currently have.		Not only would be of more utility to them, they would be more accountable to the market for using it inefficiently.
If you or I behaved as Elon Musk or Donald Trump did with their money, scaled down to our wealth level, we'd be bankrupt in a year. They're hopelessly incompetent.		But they *literally can't lose*, because their capital appreciates faster than they can liquidate and spend it.
The reason billionairism breaks capitalism is that capitalism is based on the ability of ppl to lose as well as win. Billionaires have so many assets, and therefore returns, it's basically impossible for them to lose even if they make bad decisions for themselves or the economy.
Billionaires are not automatically bad people.		But a single person having that much money is inherently too much power for even a good person to have. The very act of having so much money that nothing has a cost, is an ethical problem.

@oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods This remark betrays a misunderstanding of what an abortion procedure actually involves.		If a fetus is viable but the pregnancy is causing a serious complication in the woman, doctors will seek to save both of them. You imply they'll attempt to kill it first, and that's false.

This is an important point.		If you want fewer late-term abortions, make early-term abortions easier. Many women seeking earlier abortions understand they aren't healthy enough to have a pregnancy ‚Äî and forcing them to can lead to gruesome results. https://t.co/0nfrgco5vR

Really, any Democrat who supports Medicare for All, when asked whether they support banning private insurance, should say: "No, it's not necessary. Private insurance can continue. People are just less likely to need or use it as the program rolls out."
For the record: most successful universal single-payer systems don't ban private insurance. You can buy extra private insurance in Canada and the United Kingdom.
