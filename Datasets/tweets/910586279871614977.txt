Where there is society, there is trust, and where there is trust, there is something upon which it is supported.	Frederick Douglass,¬†Our Composite Nationality¬†(7 December 1869), Boston, Massachusetts
At this point I have one certain test. Mankind are not held together by lies. Trust is the foundation of society. Where there is no truth, there can be no trust, and where there is no trust, there can be no society.
If he will not tell the truth, except when it is for his interest to do so, let us make it for his interest to tell the truth. We can do it by applying to him the same principle of justice that we apply to ourselves...
They will try to impeach him but it will not work.		What God has put in motion, nothing or no one will stop.		While the elephant and donkey are fighting God will be putting the right laws back in place.	God spoke through a donkey before and He knows how to ride on them too.
