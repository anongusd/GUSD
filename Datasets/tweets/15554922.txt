Trump‚Äôs hate-filled nonsense should not be getting coverage over real issues that affect the American people.
It is incumbent on all of us to know and call out when our leaders are pushing propaganda for their own callous, political gain. And we rely on‚Äîand call on‚Äîa free and independent media to not give propaganda a pass.
Trump‚Äôs new absurd attempt to repeal the Constitutional amendment on birthright citizenship by executive order is another example of bogus rhetoric designed to stir up resentment amongst Americans before the midterms.
We are currently facing real threats‚Äîa series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence.	 	Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, Trump is trying to ignore them or even make them worse by pouring gas on the fire.
President @realDonaldTrump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain‚Äîto stoke fears and garner votes for the midterm elections. Trump and his Fox News allies are lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.

REMEMBER: The Senate GOP intentionally blocked the nomination of Merrick Garland (a pro-worker SCOTUS pick) so they could appoint a justice who would serve their own‚Äîand @realDonaldTrump's‚Äîcorporate interests at the expense of the American workforce. 12/12
Despite these attacks, Americans continue to fight for a voice on the job. 		Teachers across the country are fighting for better pay &amp; better schools. Fast food workers are demanding $15 and a union, and nearly half of Americans say that they would join a union if they could. 11/
These attacks should matter to all working people. In communities where unions are strong, all workers‚ÄîREGARDLESS OF UNION STATUS‚Äîearn higher pay, low-income children have a better shot of climbing out of poverty as adults, &amp; more people get out to vote. 10/
Adding insult to injury, the #Janus decision comes on the heels of Gorsuch‚Äôs 5-4 opinion in Epic Systems, where he found that corporations can force employees to sign ‚Äúarbitration agreements‚Äù that prohibit them from vindicating their class-action rights. 9/
Gorsuch knows that his ruling will harm unions‚Äô ability to negotiate salary increases &amp; safer workplaces w/out sufficient funding. 		But don't be surprised. This is Trump's SCOTUS pick doing exactly what he promised: siding w/ big business over the rights of the U.S. worker. 8/
Now, his deciding vote in Janus will undermine some unions‚Äô ability to prevent free riding. The 5-4 decision will allow nonmembers to receive all the benefits of unions without	having to pay the cost of negotiating for those benefits. 7/
Gorsuch overwhelmingly ruled for corporations over people and repeatedly tried to close the courthouse doors on workers, consumers, and others who filed lawsuits to vindicate their legal rights. 		https://t.co/Q1WP1zP7ny 6/

The circuit court ruled in favor of the driver, deciding he was wrongfully terminated under the Surface Transportation Act. Gorsuch's dissenting opinion ignored the law &amp; court precedent‚Äîand clearly aimed to wrongfully punish the worker. 		https://t.co/Q1WP1zP7ny 4/
