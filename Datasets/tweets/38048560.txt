Helpful for weight loss: Eating breakfast is linked to a negative change in BMI, and skipping it is associated with a 0 change. #ICNM17 https://t.co/5TpSDGCULG
Sticking to 3 meals a day is correlated with a 0 change in BMI each year, i.e., no weight loss or gain. #ICNM17 https://t.co/184LUfdDRj

Your vitamin D level could be a marker of diabetes or cardiovascular disease risk. #ICNM17 https://t.co/IdqPamne6C
