@thomaswright08 you‚Äôre right that the foreign policy community generally favors diplomacy. we don‚Äôt suggest otherwise, but it‚Äôs worth highlighting public disapproval for a ‚Äúmilitarized response‚Äù to iran when people making the case for an attack are in the president‚Äôs ear (e.g., bolton).
@thomaswright08 the report doesn't make longitudinal claims (re: ‚Äúwaning or strengthening‚Äù support for a particular foreign policy) since yes, it‚Äôs using time-bound data. but tom, you &amp; i both have knowledge of trend lines based in part on previous research... so this essay reflects that.

@Mad_Science_Guy True. And I‚Äôve written/spoken about that plenty. 		Point here is that political fragmentation has led many otherwise sane foreign policy analysts to oppose every Trump policy because it‚Äôs Trump saying it.
Of course, he‚Äôs wrong about all sorts of other things.		For example:		Brexit/Fragmented EU good for US		Ending INF w/o ally coordination		Unilateral JCPOA withdrawal		Ditto Paris Accord		And TPP...
Trump knows little about foreign policy. Cares even less. 		That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs wrong about everything. 		For example:		China is a critical trade access &amp; IP challenge		Maduro is an illegitimate leader &amp; disaster for his people		Most NATO allies don‚Äôt spend enough on defense
The Chinese are meeting w Venezuelan opposition. The Russians are calling for a ‚Äúmultilateral‚Äù solution. 		Venezuela isn‚Äôt Syria. If the US and allies stay the course, Maduro‚Äôs friends can help ease him out of the country and the people can have free and fair elections.
Some will say the US should leave Maduro alone. 		But it‚Äôs hard to just stand by and watch after Maduro destroyed his economy, stole an election and created 3 million refugees. 		Broad US-led multilateral pressure on Maduro is the right policy.
US humanitarian aid was sent to Venezuela with full knowledge Maduro wouldn‚Äôt allow it in.		It‚Äôs a public test of the loyalty of Maduro‚Äôs military and a US strategy to further delegitimize him. 		Ultimately the change has to be made by Venezuelans. And that‚Äôs now more likely. https://t.co/evAn27W9id

Trudeau and Trump don‚Äôt agree on much these days. But are both on the right side of the Venezuela crisis.		(for different reasons: for Trudeau it‚Äôs human rights, for Trump it‚Äôs a left/right divide)
@dany_bahar Nearly 2 million last year. So directly on back of Maduro-led economic crisis.
The Russians and Chinese are on the wrong side of the Venezuela conflict.  But even they see Maduro as a money pit and their support is limited. 		Broadest possible intl support for opposition will move more Venezuelan military to oppose govt oppression.
This does not mean the US should intervene militarily. I would oppose. 		But standing by and pretending Maduro can govern his way out of this crisis is ludicrous. Recognition of opposition is the right move; freezing Venezuelan assets abroad (Citgo) a next step.
Two million refugees have already fled Venezuela. 		Maduro has driven absolute economic collapse, the country has become increasingly ungovernable under his authoritarian rule. 		Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela.

At least 20 journalists have called me to ask how big a disaster for Trump the Mattis resignation is. 		It‚Äôs a significant negative. How much depends on replacement.		But Bannon firing was a bigger deal. Not 1 journalist called to ask me how good that was going to be for Trump.
Russia, Iran &amp; Turkey have strong national interests in Syria and military forces there to back it up.		2,000 US troops = US isn‚Äôt going to influence outcomes. Even the Kurds stopped fighting ISIS w US to focus on defending themselves.		Pulling US troops out admits the obvious.

@kengold Diversity just is. That‚Äôs like asking if technology is good. Need to understand the system it‚Äôs sitting in, how it‚Äôs employed. I‚Äôm focusing on the notion that diverse societies are automatically better. And how modern tech is making that more challenging.
Integrated diverse cultures are stronger. Segregated diverse cultures are not.

Kavanaugh‚Äôs character and overt partisanship should be disqualifying for the Supreme Court in my view. 		I still expect him to be confirmed.
@53Parker His description of Kozinski from his clerkship (completely not credible),	and much of description of his drinking / yearbook / etc. Plus the excessive direct partisanship in the hearings.
This strikes me as the kind of tweet that should perform particularly badly on social media. Because most people only agree with some of it.
Disagree strongly with this (Kavanaugh‚Äôs character and overt partisanship should be disqualifying for the Supreme Court in my view), but have to recognize it‚Äôs an effective meme to frame the debate in Kavanaugh‚Äôs favor. https://t.co/Br5YgUkXXv

USMCA is not an entirely new deal, but it‚Äôs more than a tweak on NAFTA. 		Improved IP protections, new auto rules, expanded access to Canada dairy, improved labor/environment regs, and more. 		Trump will exaggerate the win.	But it‚Äôs a win.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want trade wars. 	He wants limited ‚Äúwins‚Äù he can put he name on. 		S Korea, Japan, EU, NAFTA...	China more challenging but same dynamic.
