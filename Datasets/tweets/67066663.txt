@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC Which sins do you write about in your songs? Just curious. I'm sure some think your style is worldly. Our God is for us. Love what you do

@LifeNewsHQ @KNGMusic hopefully will see this
@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC Verse 13 of this passage is what he quoted. If you're saying no one who's ever sinned should enter the church, the church will be empty.
@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC Picking every social topic and announcing what's a sin may be your job, but John 8 shows a very different way of dealing with sin.
@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC I'll pray for you. You may not like his methods, but he's applying I Corinthians 13 in how he deals with people. He does preach the gospel!
@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC To say he's causing the sin is overreach
@KNGMusic @carllentzNYC I don't think condemning a certain type of sin would make the guilty person want to hear him preach the gospel. We're all sinners!

@NinersNation I am glad this was available on the web. The fact Kap opted out of this contract which was guaranteed thru this year is rarely discussed.
