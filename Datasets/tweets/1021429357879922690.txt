@charliekirk11 Fast and furious?
@BernieSanders The Democratic Party is officially a dysfunctional mess
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP That cause by humans part is very iffy
@amyklobuchar Hopefully you don‚Äôt treat America like your staff.
Does any other Virginian politician have anything they want to confess because at this point they need to just clean house.
@VP @RepHuizenga @POTUS Every economic accomplishment outlined we‚Äôre just the product of Obama era policies that set the framework for a positive trend.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Its amazing despite all the hate he gets he countinue to fight for what‚Äôs right.
@RepMattGaetz This isn‚Äôt about justice it‚Äôs about politics. Y‚Äôall have been chanting #LockHerUp for 2 years and did nothing. But now that Trump‚Äôs associates are going to jail these mundane allegations are coming back up.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Unborn children are not children...you don‚Äôt walk a fetus to the bus stop...you don‚Äôt let an embryo go over their friend‚Äôs house. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!
@PoliticusSarah @AOC Of coarse she said that, she would look bad if she says anything good about it.
@peterdaou Democrats always find the bad and the ugly in what is supposed be unifying.
@RubinReport Clapping shouldn‚Äôt be a political issue but some how republicans have managed to make it into one.
@RepDaveJoyce @POTUS I truely do hope we can swiftly and effectively get it all done. But I‚Äôd bet my life that every single politician in that room took @POTUS‚Äôs words and let it go in one ear and out the other.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I see what you‚Äôre saying, the ethical issue is immense after the second trimester because a fetus is turning into an actual baby. However, until the baby is born the parents should still have the right to control what happens with the child and the govt should stay out of it.
@SenatorCantwell So what exactly do you plan on doing about it because a tweet won‚Äôt fix it.
@seanhannity I‚Äôm surprised it wasn‚Äôt more!
@RepMGS @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemWomen @RepLoisFrankel The more woman in Congress the better!
@RepJudyChu @AOC *illegal immigrants* keyword: ILLEGAL
@RepBuddyCarter @realDonaldTrump I guess we‚Äôll see in the coming days whether this is true or not. I sincerely do hope he means what he says about bipartisanship because we really need it.
@tedcruz Agreed! You are definitely right about this one.
@Public_Citizen @RepRaskin I‚Äôm from Maryland and I would expect more from my representative then foolish rhetoric
@phillyarcher @SenFeinstein At least she‚Äôs trying to fix the problem
@SenSchumer @staceyabrams I thought both did a good job
@washingtonpost Trump is as confident as ever and if Schumer can‚Äôt see that then he‚Äôs emotionally blind!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Give him a chance!
@SenSchumer Can those people just learn English!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What he was trying to convey was that investigations are getting in the way of legislation because so much time, energy and money are being put into them that could be invested in laws
@brianschatz Is that an announcement I hear?
@SenJohnKennedy @CNN @jimsciutto Remeber you are your own person don‚Äôt be a typical republican please.
@Liz_Cheney @KellyannePolls Funny how clapping is now a political issue...
@IngrahamAngle @Morning_Joe Nice to see @FoxNews contort themselves to praise any and everything the President does. There is more to life than kissing butt @IngrahamAngle
@SenatorLankford This tweet was like his state of the union...positive at first but then turned into dividing rhetoric.
@HouseGOP I‚Äôm not sure if you all got the memo but illegal immigrants voting in American elections is not a good thing
The fun part of the #SOTU is guessing whether/which politicians are going to clap, stand, or stand and clap.
@brithume This is a gross generalization. There was literally only one Democrat on the floor that blocked it. Wait until every democrat has a say before grouping them all. This logical fallacy disproves your argument.
@realtalk995 @RepMoBrooks It‚Äôs amazing to me how much time you spend retweeting
#LiamNeeson is living in the 21st century with a 20th century mindset. Slavery has been abolished for over a century yet he still thought he owned the black race. What if he did find somebody to kill, that‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs son/husband/brother/father! Apology not accepted.
Agreed!!!! https://t.co/VrMOlcSZfV
#BuildThatWall ? #NoWall ? Both sides should be ashamed. #Democrats can‚Äôt just let people in here like America is a day care center. #Republicans can‚Äôt just give an ultimatum, that‚Äôs not negotiating. Take away congressional pay and perks then see how quickly this is resolved!
@RepMullin Even though I disagree with the wall the beard is üî•üëåüèΩ
@RepRWilliams @POTUS @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Negotiation is a two way street and you‚Äôd be lying if you said that @POTUS was willing to do that.
@TuckerCarlson I‚Äôm officially convinced this guy will criticize just about anything because he just had a whole segment criticizing Beto O‚ÄôRourke for going to the dentist...
I watched the first house session video and it was hilarious how clueless everyone was about formal procedure but overall it was very expected. I look forward to seeing what this Congress has in stored!
@jerneganartist We have a wall right now...and they still climb over...so how do you expect for a new one to help?
@RocketManDomain What is trump doing to lower the debt...just curious?
@Plutocracy1 @shakiedenise76 That‚Äôs not why people go to church. They go to congregate and adore the one true living God. They go to hear the gospel and receive wisdom from those who have been anointed to teach. In this secular world which we live it‚Äôs important that we can attend a sacred place of worship.
I hate hypocrites...when something bad happens they say they‚Äôll do all they can to prevent it from happening again...but when the solution is too ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or too ‚Äúliberal‚Äù then suddenly the problem is forgotten.
I feel like such a liberal for saying this but @TheDemocrats weren‚Äôt getting sent actual bombs before @realDonaldTrump came into office. His hate speech has given fuel to those who had to live in the shadows under @BarackObama.
Whether the accusations prove to be true or not everyone is innocent until proven guilty!
@SmoothieKing There‚Äôs a smoothie king opening in greenbelt MD but I don‚Äôt where to apply to it sense it hasn‚Äôt opened yet

It keeps me up at night thinking about what a newly confirmed #scotus Justice Kavanaugh would let the President get away with. I‚Äôm not speculating that there is something #POTUS45 has to cover up, but if there were-his #SC nominee would certainly aid in his false facade.
I‚Äôm saying this now because I‚Äôm about to contact my representatives for the first time. Even though their views align with mine, I‚Äôve heard money speaks louder than words in Washington...but I don‚Äôt want to speculate.
Your representatives in Congress works for you. You have the right to send as many calls, letters and emails as you want! As long as you get a response that‚Äôs all that matters.  Just because in the end they vote the opposite way does not mean they don‚Äôt care.
Political realist- Looking out for one‚Äôs own county	Moral idealist-Work together for the common good of the world		Political Realist- carpet bomb innocent Cambodians(Vietnam)	Moral idealist-get screwed over by Russia 		PR- No compromise, Just Benefit	MI-save the world from Ebola
#Immigration, I‚Äôm not going to give my view on it...but if we can resolve this as a country who knows what else we would be able to accomplish!		#bipartisan #Democrats #Republicans #USA #AmericaLeads #BorderSecurity #Amnesty #DACA #zerotolerance #Congress #Unity #Peace #Justice
@CONSMILITIA Isn‚Äôt community #selfdefence the job of the #police?
‚ÄúA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a State, the right to bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù 		-Second Amendment. 		I agree we should be able to defend ourselves with a firearm however using the second amendment too defend that claim is ignorant.
Somebody save me this isn‚Äôt #public #education this is opinionated bull crap...on all sides, take a political science class and you‚Äôll see what I mean.		I‚Äôm sorry the news is just doing their job in a way that appeals to their audience...not to those who are nonpartisan...
Turned on the #news:	-@MSNBC @Lawrence talking about how #trump brain washing	-@CNN @donlemon discussing a possible #POTUS interview for #RussianCollusion with Mueller	-@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle is confused about why people care more about illegal immigrants than Americans
The most important #power of the #President is by far that of chief executive. Executive agencies control every aspect of our life that‚Äôs why their so important. I may be contradicting myself from my last post but hey...opinions change #TuesdayThoughts #100DaysUntilMidterms
Enumerated #powers of #Congress: #immigration,#commerce and #war. Recently the executive branch is taking control of that...so much for separation of powers.                                                 #MondayMotivation #Constitution #BetterOffNow
We can #criticize #politicians for their #mistakes, but it‚Äôs not right to criticize them for fixing it don‚Äôt you think? That‚Äôll only make them more likely to not correct the error...		#WednesdayWisdom #115congress #21stCenturyCures #Democrat #Republican #Congress #President
#knowledge of #ForeignPolicy doesn‚Äôt usually get a President elected...yet it plays a crucial part in things Americans DO care about..the economy,jobs,consumer products and even something we take for granted like vacationing around the worldüåé.
#TuesdayThoughts #TuesdayMotivation
The #media is essential to our #democracy, yet it‚Äôs also a big part of our #political polarization problem. Everyone has a certain stance on a specific issue and will defend it until they die! You can stay true to who you are while still being open minded.
@LindseyGrahamSC  said on @FoxNews  @marthamaccallum  that there are ‚Äúno #moderates in #iran‚Äù to negotiate with...he‚Äôs more informed about the subject than I am...however I know I might sound na√Øve in saying that there is a moderate everywhere you just have to dig deep enough!
Hearing a lot about the #DeepState but I didn‚Äôt know what it was only that people were blaming it for everything...after some research I found out what it was(or what it‚Äôs supposed to be) and it is now my opinion that it doesn‚Äôt exist...I‚Äôm all ears if you think I‚Äôm wrongüëÇüèΩ
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @marthamaccallum I‚Äôll be watching and giving commentary on my pageüëçüèΩ
‚ÄúFor the love of money is root of all evil‚Äù @ every #Republican and #democratic #politician who claim to be so devoted...you should know this verse                                                 #MondayMotivition #politics #Government #governmentguru
@SenGillibrand Hopefully all while still protecting our sovereignty
@KamalaHarris That‚Äôs sounds great and all but...where that money coming from? O right higher taxes and China...yikes
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump All you gonna hear is ‚Äúexecutive privilege‚Äù
@FoxNews You gotta do what you gotta do....just kidding he thought he was slicküòÇ
@SenDonnelly Well I could have told you that was gonna happen before the law was even written
@dmartosko @EricTrump Depends on who you ask...
@KasieDC @SenBlumenthal This whole Supreme Court situation has been so messed up since Republicans blocked President Obama‚Äôs nomination....but the Democrats had to go and make the whole situation worse by trying to block Trump‚Äôs nominee...you can‚Äôt fight fire with fire
@FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
@DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump O helllllllllllllllllll noooo
I think a lot of people know what they‚Äôre taking about and A LOT MORE people don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about... yet the people who aren‚Äôt really informed get more litseners
I‚Äôve learned this new concept called motivated reasoning- it‚Äôs when people have the conclusion they want in mind first...then they find the facts to back it up. Seeing a lot of that...
I agree that something fishy is going on between @Russia and @realDonaldTrump but not enough substantial evidence has been released to make the accusations I hear
Lots of crazy stuff going on I just wanted to voice my opinion and ignite interesting conversation you don‚Äôt have to care if you don‚Äôt want toü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
