@BravesAmerica In my opinion, the missed opportunity is all about depth. For example, we wouldn‚Äôt want to have signed Adam Jones instead of Kakes. But having Jones now on the bench would be great. I don‚Äôt understand the Keuchel hate on Braves Twitter. He is not like Julio like so many suggest.
@KnockahomaQ @santoniobrown Excellent quote. 100% agree. There is a place for both standard and advanced analytics.
@niaplatt2 @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Yeah I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre real lovely in the real world.. maybe somewhat similar to your friend here: https://t.co/ATdv2QrR27

@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Hillary‚Äôs emails is different. The emails from her unsecured server. The 30k deleted emails. That‚Äôs not the same. You are conflating the issues.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows They did?? Says who? Everyone knew that the DNC was hacked when Assange said so.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows So not only did the bank robbery never happen, no help was actually provided.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows In this scenario, the bank robbery never happened. You left that key detail out.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows So Trump and Don Jr were so aware and apart of the DNC hacking that the didn‚Äôt even have the information on them??
@TyzO_pin_ion @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows How many of those indictments have to do with collusion? Please explain how this proves your point of Trump/Russia collusion.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows So is this your attempt to deflect from the point above?? Just curious if you are actually an idiot in real life or just on the internet?
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows They knew what?? Don Jr getting emailed about ‚Äúdirt‚Äù on Hillary? How could he have known about the ‚Äúhacking‚Äù if somebody is telling him about it? Also, there is no indication in the Don Jr meeting that it was about ‚Äúemails‚Äù but rather ‚Äúdirt‚Äù on Hillary.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Hey dumbfuck.. the Trump team didn‚Äôt steal the emails. Are you fucking retarded?
@TyzO_pin_ion @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows They did?? You have evidence of this??
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Conspiracy to do what?? Gather oppo research? What is the conspiracy? If accepting aid is a crime, then why is nobody acknowledging that the dossier is filled with Russia propaganda?? That is directly from Russians. That is not whataboutism, it‚Äôs that is what is the rules?
@niaplatt2 @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Like what? What is the direct connection from Trump to Russia collusion? Stone talking to Cossie about Wikileaks is not collusion. Assange has denied that connection as well. PapaD not charged with any crimes regarding collusion. Carter Page not charged with anything.
@niaplatt2 @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows I have no desire to read McCabes book. He is part of the problem. The fact that you believe in him is the problem. And he has contradicted himself numerous times about Trump, the dossier, the firing of Comey and his documented lies to the OIG
@niaplatt2 @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Well.. that‚Äôs what we need to find out. Because we have been told it‚Äôs a mosaic of information. Yet we only know about the dossier. We also know that the Trump team was spied on.
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows Just to be clear.. You believe Don Jr has Hillary‚Äôs emails? Because if he doesn‚Äôt, then what assistance did he receive?
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows It‚Äôs called oppo research. Is that a crime?? Also, they didn‚Äôt get anything out of the meeting. Not to mention it was a setup since it‚Äôs been proven that the lawyer was also working with Fusion gps
@niaplatt2 @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows So that‚Äôs it?? Broad and vague references. And just to be clear, a businessman doing real estate business is something that should automatically always trigger a CI investigation OR just when it‚Äôs your political opponent??
@TyzO_pin_ion @MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows So I‚Äôm Boris because I question your DOJ and FBI?? Okay. Cool. And you say complied. Compiled by Steele.. but he isn‚Äôt the source. You do know the difference, right??
@MarkRey92717108 @dfhappy @niaplatt2 @Chi_Curmudgeon @RepMarkMeadows What is there to explain?? Now you explain all the information collected you Russians that was fed into the dossiers that was used for the FISA app? None was verified. None of it has been proven.

@MattPowers31 Here is the problem: The Braves have a core of young and CHEAP talent. Acuna, Albies, Swanson, Camargo, Freeman, all the pitchers... they needed a big time addition. Like Harper. Or just anything more than Markakis and McCann. They didn‚Äôt do it.

@EthanF_Freeman7 @kendh Well.. maybe I‚Äôm biased but right now seems like the right opportunity to add a salary like Harper. The majority of our position players and pitchers are extremely young and cheap. Seems like an opportunity was missed and the hope for the future is that prospects hit.
@EthanF_Freeman7 @kendh With Waters and Pache being up, you are assuming a lot of things have to go right.

@KnockahomaNTN Fair points. Last year, Sanchez, McCarthy, Newk, Soroka and Fried missed time. We know the depth of young guys, but are they reliable for a team that wants to contend. Keuchel seems like a reliable front of rotation piece. It gives time to not rush young guys into the rotation.
@KnockahomaNTN Here is my rationale: Keuchel is easily the #2. That gives the rotation another LHP. Keuchel has consistent numbers that include limiting HRs and BBs. He is a GB pitcher. That will play well with our great defense. He doesn‚Äôt have to face a DH. Provides quality depth and options.
@KnockahomaNTN Why? Please explain.
@KnockahomaNTN What if I told you Keuchel would sign for 3-years $17-19 AAV. Would that be something you would be interested in doing?
@KnockahomaNTN So in an attempt to be vague you used two different pitchers?
@KnockahomaNTN @RandyPiper8 The pitcher you are describing in this tweet is 100% Dallas Keuchel. There is no way to dispute that. His stats are identical to the one listed as ‚Äúlast 3 seasons ‚Äú
@KnockahomaNTN @RandyPiper8 So are you saying that the tweet above indicating the last three years of 518 innings is not the same pitcher in the original tweet?

@scottcoleman55 Areas of improvement included: C, RF, Front of rotation SP, BP, and bench depth. 		Donaldson allows Camargo to help bench depth. Still would like more help in a 4th OF. 		Catcher is not upgraded offensively but likely better in other areas. 		RF, BP, and SP were not upgraded. 		B
@anch1970 @BravesAmerica @scottcoleman55 Beyond 2019 how do you feel about that corner OF spot? options include Pache or Waters, but that would be starting 2020 with a rookie. Not all rookies will look like Acuna. players like Brantley or Pollock seem like longer term solutions to aid development of the young guys.

@KirstenPowers Apparently you didn‚Äôt spend that time away learning a new skill..
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Keuchel is a LHP. Adding him behind Folty would give you a R, L, R, L. With Gausman and Newk. Thats a solid 1-4. Julio battles for 5th with Touki/Soroka or trade Julio. Keuchel is good. And would make rotation better. You are wrong. Your opinion is not worth any more of my time.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Obviously this is going nowhere. 		Keuchel is a very good pitcher. He would make us better. I genuinely do not care what happens to Julio. You act like he is valuable when in fact he is likely the 4th or 5th option. Keuchel would be 2nd. It‚Äôs really that simple.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Gio Gonzalez or Buckholtz would be options that wouldn‚Äôt make sense. They are worse than Julio. Keuchel is better in my opinion.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk The benefit of adding Keuchel is that you have options with Julio. Keep him or trade him. Somebody gets hurt then you have depth. Again, you don‚Äôt have to rush Touki/Soroka/Gohara into a role or expand to 6-man rotation. It‚Äôs a depth move and a move that strengthens your staff.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Keuchel is lightyears more polished and developed than anybody not on the big league roster. Not to me he has pitched in big games and is also a very good pitcher. The demeaning his success is weak. His success speaks for itself if you actually know baseball.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk You give Touki, Soroka and Gohara time to develop. They can either be apart of a 6-man rotation, bullpen or AAA. Soroka is coming back from injury his innings will be limited. Touki and Gohara would be great in the bullpen.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk No it‚Äôs not.. teams that are not in rebuild mode add pieces like him. He makes your rotation better. He gives it strength that can‚Äôt be relied on from ‚Äúaces‚Äù in the minors. How is that not the most absurd statement? Walker Buehler is an exception. Most teams add vets. Not youngs.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Just consider the madness of what you are saying.. it‚Äôs not your money. It‚Äôs not going to impact the ability to do sign guys like Albies, Acuna and others. They have 4-5 years on the cheap. It makes us better and gives more depth and flexibility. Keuchel would make us better.
@BravesStats @paulydeizzs @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk You can be optimistic. I‚Äôm optimistic too. I like this team but I think they can be better. I don‚Äôt have to kiss their ass and be proud of every move.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Like I said, I don‚Äôt want Keuchel over $20 million per year. 		Adding Keuchel is also about depth. He lengthens the rotation. Gausman and Newk are moved down lesser pressured roles. It gives options and time for the young guys to develop and contribute without much pressure.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk last 3 years:	ERA: Teheran 3.88 | Keuchel 3.77	IP: Teheran 552 | Keuchel 518	FIP : Teheran 4.49 | Keuchel 3.78	SIERA: Teheran 4.49 | Keuchel 3.85	HR/9: Teheran 1.26 | Keuchel 0.93	BB/9: Teheran 3.23 | Keuchel 2.65	GB%: Teheran 39% | Keuchel 58% 	FB% : Teheran 40% | Keuchel 21%
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk damn I thought it was just gleefully ignorance. 		Nobody is advocating for giving Keuchel $100m. Nobody. I have said this entire offseason that I wouldn‚Äôt go more than $20m per year for him. 		Comparing him to Julio is such a flawed argument. He is significantly a better pitcher.
@BravesStats @paulydeizzs @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk I‚Äôm not trying to be all doom and gloom, but Braves fans expecting 90+ wins are likely to be very disappointed. The division is much better.. im not going to go into more detail because it‚Äôs be belabored before.

@baldheaded1der Is that overpaying?? That‚Äôs $14m per year. That seems about right. He was allegedly asking for 6-years, $100m in the winter. That is overpaying.
@BravesStats @paulydeizzs @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk 92 wins?? That would be an incredible scenario. That would easily mean everything went right plus Dansby/Camargo hit 20 HRs and slashed .295/.350/.450
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk You‚Äôre fucking insane. I‚Äôm done with this troll. Keuchel would be the second best pitcher on the staff. Arguably he could be better than Folty if Folty struggled to do what he did in 2018. You have no data or supporting evidence to validate your claim. Pathetic and weak.
@paulydeizzs @BravesStats @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk That might be so.. everybody in the division except Mia is better. It‚Äôs a damn good division. The Braves will likely be able to make midseason moves too. Still time to add Keuchel or Kimbrel.
@Topher_55 @abraves277 @atlbaseballtalk Maybe so.. but there are ways to make it work.. including trading pieces like Teheran or Newk. You want Mitch Haniger? You might have to move a guy like Newk.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk They do?? They have a 5 pitchers in the minors that are capable of throwing 200 innings?? They have 5 guys in the minors that will throw a sub 2.60 BB/9 or sub 0.79 HR/9. That alone would lead the big league team.
@sheabooskyy https://t.co/1kR2mePsJH
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Kluber or nothing is meaningless. The Braves are not a complete team. The reason you add pieces is because things happen. Anibal was added right before opening day. McCarthy was hurt shortly into the season. Gohara was fat and hurt. Keuchel would add depth and give more options.
@Topher_55 @abraves277 @atlbaseballtalk disagree here. Keuchel is exactly who the Braves should target. Adding him to the rotation is what we need to compete in Oct. Legitimate depth. He is instantly the #2 in our rotation. That make the rotation more deep. Gives you more options and not have to rely on a young guy.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Lol.. that is such a terrible argument
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Here is the thing though.. right now the Braves can spend and should spend.. let‚Äôs just take last years end of year payroll of $130m. Why not spend up to that number? We don‚Äôt get anything for coming in under. Depth and upgrades. That can be achieved with another $20m
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk How does signing Harper equate to losing Albies, Acuna and freeman? The Braves have four or five years before having to worry about signing Acuna or Albies. Freeman isn‚Äôt going anywhere... and if Atlanta wins a World Series or two.. who cares if Freeman doesn‚Äôt get a 3rd contract
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Well no doubt it‚Äôs hard to win a World Series. I‚Äôd like our chances a lot more with a player like Harper. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard for Braves fans to see how elite of a player he is but it‚Äôs just unreasonable to think he should have done more with Washington.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Examining them while he is still unsigned is not a winning argument. But they are also at the top of their budget as well. Both have nearly 200,000 million already on the books for 2019.
@abraves277 @Topher_55 @atlbaseballtalk Harper gets you to the postseason. Of course you need more to win it all.. but Atlanta has no room to talk when it comes to winning it all. One championship out of 14 straight division titles. It‚Äôs a bit disingenuous for Braves fans to shit-talk the Nats.
@BravesStats @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk It‚Äôs not a matter if Duvall can be better.. because he can‚Äôt be worse.. it‚Äôs a matter of can we do better than Duvall. Teams that win championships do so with incredible depth. Duvall is not that in my opinion. In game 3 vs. LAD, they had Puig, Muncy, and Pederson on the bench.
@680TheFan @Braves Please ask him about his thought on Duvall serving as the 4th OF. Is that the best we can do?? Gausman as his #2 SP. Is that good enough to win in October?
@BravesStats @PTownBrave22 @atlbaseballtalk I don‚Äôt know any Braves fans that believe we are not significantly better to start 2019 compared to 2018. Lineup will not have Flaherty or Tucker in it. That said, we currently have Duvall as the 4th OF. And Gausman as the #2 SP. McCann And Kakes are adequate but not great.

It‚Äôs so small-market to think the Braves can‚Äôt manage Harper. Some of the biggest assholes in baseball have championship rings and were hated by teammates.
@atlbaseballtalk It‚Äôs fairly obvious that Atlanta has made offers but just not competitive offers. For what reason, I don‚Äôt know.. maybe they are placating the fans. ‚ÄúWe made offers, but just didn‚Äôt want to be irresponsible.‚Äù Seems like a small-market mentality.

@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro MIA will need Alfaro to become more than league average for them to make good on this deal. Sixto could be the next Jose Fernandez but they never won more than 79 games with him. So after losing Yelich, Ozuna, Stanton and now JT they need Sixto to be Jose and Alfaro to be Yadi.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro My point is simple. ATL wanted JT for the same reasons Phillies got him. Win now mode. That said, ATL has a farm system that in indisputably top-3. We didn‚Äôt give up pieces that will build on a team that won the division. MIA got an elite piece but they are still so far away.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro I‚Äôm not saying the Marlins need Alfaro be a hall of famer, but trading away an All-Star catcher for a league average catcher is not a good trade off. Then consider Sixto is not likely to arrive until 2020. What kind of production from him and company can you really expect?
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro Of grammar policing.. that is where you argument is now? Lol.. You think Miami wins more in 2019 than 2018? Lol.. that‚Äôs precious.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro You got a link for that 12-18 range??
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro You got an link or reference for that.. because that sounds not likely
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro You said ‚Äúwrong‚Äù on ‚Äúall of it‚Äù. Clearly I‚Äôm not wrong. Those trade happened and they were not good for Miami unless you consider the horrible contract that they signed him to.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro So all you need is pitcher with injury concerns to stay healthy for a long term to figure if you win the trade?? That seems like a lot of risk. If Philly gets back to the postseason, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that they win the trade. Or Atlanta developing another team of the decade.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro They don‚Äôt need him to be a hall of famer, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt. They need a lot. Miami won 63 games with Realmuto. They are not likely to be better with Alfaro. They need more help than you realize.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro Phillies finished 10 games back of Atlanta. I don‚Äôt think McCutchen and Realmuto make them better than Atlanta. I think it‚Äôs close to even. The addition of Donaldson is big for Atlanta.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro Sure.. like I said, you need him to be Yadi. To have the impact you need for a turnaround you will need more than what he is currently offering.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro Currently ranked 28 here: https://t.co/uUPalXsVZL		They are outside the top-10 in mlb pipeline. Adding Sixto will help but not enough to be more than average.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro So you are saying that the trades of Yelich, Ozuna and Stanton have worked out favorably for Miami?? Lol.. okay homer beat write guy. You are suggesting that prior to Sixto, the Miami farm system is not below average?? Lol again.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro Yelich, Ozuna and Stanton. Trading away another All-Star and getting one elite piece is fine, but that elite prospect has obvious concerns. Seems like history would suggest the trend will continue. Miami needs Alfaro to be Yadi for this to be a good deal.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro Phillies need Realmuto to be even with the Braves. If Philly adds Harper or Machado then they clearly win the offseason and the division. The Braves are fine though because they have improved and haven‚Äôt dealt any valuable pieces to do so. Both teams in the 86 win range.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro My opinion on Alfaro and Stewart is shared outside of the Marlins beat. The facts suggest that this is another blown opportunity for the Marlins to improve. Just like with Yelich, Ozuna and Stanton. Your farm system is below average at best. You best hope Alfaro turns into Yadi.
@santoniobrown Are you satisfied? I‚Äôm good.. but not satisfied.
RT @JackPosobiec: Twitter censored Trump! Share the original! https://t.co/zAGHSqujIe
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro Well.. it‚Äôs not factual because the Braves didn‚Äôt give pieces that the Marlins would need. Sixto is only piece of value in the trade. No question he has a high ceiling but he also has some serious concerns. I‚Äôm glad the Marlins got fleeced. I just hate that Philly got better.
@Tom1989603 @mpicardi @JoeFrisaro Exactly.. that is the point. The Braves are IMO the winners of this trade. They didn‚Äôt give up valuable pieces. Pieces needed for a turnaround. Sixto alone is not enough. Alfaro is not anything more than a platoon catcher. Stewart is nothing to be counted on either.
@mpicardi @Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro That perception is great. That perception the Marlins will likely lead to them losing another trade. Sixto even reaching 80% of his ceiling is not enough for Miami to turnaround the franchise. Adding Anderson and Pache/Riley would have been better pieces for a turnaround

@Tom1989603 @JoeFrisaro They are ranked right around each other in most rankings. The idea that Sixto is ‚Äúwayyy‚Äù more talented is subjective and likely inaccurate. Anderson is basically on the same trajectory and hasn‚Äôt the injury concerns that Sixto has.
@JoeFrisaro Sixto and Anderson basically equals. Neither are making an impact in the bigs until 2020. Camargo is a super utility asset. Alfaro is a platoon catcher. Not sure how that favors Alfaro. And then there is Will Stewart. I guess that ‚Äúputs it over the top‚Äù so best of luck with that.
@JoeFrisaro I‚Äôm curious why the Marlins think the trade was so good in their favor?? Will Stewart put it over the top?? I just don‚Äôt understand that line of thinking. 		Alfaro? He is basically a platoon catcher. Obviously, the Marlins wanted Contreras and the Braves rightly said, no.

@WalkOffWalk1 Clamoring? I‚Äôd say no. If we could land him for 16-18 million per year, I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with it though. IMO he is a great #2 option. His value goes down at $20 million.
@BravesStats @baldheaded1der @CoachCooney10 @atlbaseballtalk @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry Not sure how you figure that when everything is indicating the opposite, but keep up the good fight I guess.
@kendh @KnockahomaNTN You‚Äôre one of those hosts on this troll podcast account. I‚Äôm not going to bore you with stats and such. But I will give you just two data points for you to attempt to explain: WAR #22 and FIP #26. 		That would be ahead of every pitcher on the staff not named Folty.
@baldheaded1der @CoachCooney10 @BravesStats @atlbaseballtalk @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry The typical avg BaBip is .300 but it‚Äôs more likely somewhere among .285 for good pitchers. 		Julio had a BaBip over .280 twice in the past 4 years. In both years, his ERA was over 4.00 and he was a 1.0 WAR pitcher. 		Last season, Julio had .217 BaBip with a 0.7 WAR. 2019=Yikes!
@CoachCooney10 @BravesStats @atlbaseballtalk @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der Keuchel has posted a higher WAR in 4 of 6 seasons. Over the past 6 years, Keuchel has averaged a lower FIP and xFIP. A lower HR/9 and BB/9. Keuchel has averaged more wins and less losses over that 6 years while pitching less games. 		So basically the opposite of what you said.
RT @ACTBrigitte: If AIPAC pays politicians to be Pro-Israel...		Who pays @IlhanMN to be pro-terrorist? ü§î
@RyanVeneman1 @KnockahomaNTN Serious question: have you ever looked at their stats side-by-side?? 		Keuchel has posted a higher WAR in 4 of 5 seasons. Keuchel has had lower FIP and ERA in 4 of 5 seasons. Keuchel has had a lower HR/9 and BB/9 in 4 of 5 seasons. 		So basically the opposite of what you said.
@BravesStats @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk Not to mention an unattainable.217 BABIP. He is more likely due for regression than positive regression.
@BravesStats @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk His fastball velocity has gone down. He went from 92.3 in 2015 to 90.4 in 2018. Interestingly, his swinging strike rate was a career high. He showed development of a changeup and sinker. All that said, I don‚Äôt think relying on him continuing to reinvent himself is a tough ask.
@jondhoward @santoniobrown Good pun. And yes, we are a cheap franchise. Let‚Äôs celebrate our mediocrity. We will always have ‚Äò95.
@santoniobrown So your saying history will repeat itself. That seems like a trend to make your hill to die on.

@DKeetz @KnockahomaNTN @BravesintheUK @David_Kaplan1 Your statement may very well become true, but it‚Äôs just as likely, if not more likely to be the opposite. There is not factual basis for your opinion. When the opposite is true when you compare Keuchels past 3 years to the current Braves starters outside of maybe Folty.
@JodecoLikesSoda @BravesStats @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk Well.. you need to qualify your statement with an actual number IMO. I don‚Äôt pay Keuchel what he is asking if it‚Äôs actually 20+ million. Charlie Morton signed a 2/30 deal. Eovaldi signed a 4/68 with Boston. That would be my target.
@atlbaseballtalk @BravesStats @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der Exactly! Why does anyone want to see another year of Julio? He is who he is. High walks, high HR rate and a historical, unattainable Low BaBip. His velocity is also gone.
@BravesStats @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk Well.. sure. That said.. it‚Äôs interesting to see Braves Twitter become divided over a Keuchel/Julio debate. 		Julio has been very inconsistent for two years.. yet, when the opportunity comes along to upgrade the rotation Braves Twitter seems adamant that Keuchel is a Julio clone.
@BravesStats @JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk Maybe so but what stopped him from doing that in the past 3 years??
@BravesStats @atlbaseballtalk Let‚Äôs look at last 3 years:	ERA: Teheran 3.88 | Keuchel 3.77	IP: Teheran 552 | Keuchel 518	FIP : Teheran 4.49 | Keuchel 3.78	SIERA: Teheran  4.49 | Keuchel 3.85	HR/9: Teheran 1.26  | Keuchel 0.93	BB/9: Teheran 3.23 | Keuchel 2.65
@JodecoLikesSoda @Josh__Sperry @BravesStats @baldheaded1der @atlbaseballtalk Let‚Äôs look at last 3 years:	ERA: Teheran 3.88 | Keuchel 3.77	IP: Teheran 552 | Keuchel 518	FIP : Teheran 4.49 | Keuchel 3.78	SIERA: Teheran  4.49 | Keuchel 3.85	HR/9: Teheran 1.26  | Keuchel 0.93	BB/9: Teheran 3.23 | Keuchel 2.65
@BravesStats @atlbaseballtalk Keuchel is not inferior to Teheran in anyway unless you favor pitchers that walk too many hitter or give up HRs at alarming rates!
@KnockahomaNTN You copy that from another previous shitty post? 	Let‚Äôs look at last 3 years:	ERA: Teheran 3.88 | Keuchel 3.77	IP: Teheran 552 | Keuchel 518	FIP : Teheran 4.49 | Keuchel 3.78	SIERA: Teheran  4.49 | Keuchel 3.85	HR/9: Teheran 1.26  | Keuchel 0.93	BB/9: Teheran 3.23 | Keuchel 2.65
@KnockahomaNTN Atlanta doesn‚Äôt need Keuchel to be an ace. They need him to be the #2 in the rotation. Pay him 17-19 million for 3-4 years. That move solidifies the rotation. Keuchel is a top-30 MLB SP. That move allows you to trade Julio or keep him as your #5 and slowly bring along the youngs.

@nwilborn19 That‚Äôs not even a comparable trade. That would be insane for one player.
@atlbaseballtalk Reasonable take. We likely know that Keuchel is not under consideration based on things AA has said about money and years. Same is likely for Kimbrel until that price tag comes down. Likely to the same for Harper. Although, of the deals with the most upside it would Harper.
@FriedBasballATL Well.. The 15-man rotation in this year is going to be a sight to see!
@JodecoLikesSoda The dichotomy about the offseason is clear. The Braves are fine as is AND the Braves need to do more to be competitive. 		The reality is in the middle. There is reason to be upset about Realmuto being traded to the Phillies. And yet reason to believe that deal was bad for Atlanta

@Ray21Tyler @TBotkin1 @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN I totally understand feelings towards a terrible 2018 Mets team. The Mets have made improvements. And did so without trading their elite pitching talent.  It would really go along way for AA to add a quality arm to help match Atlanta up with the depth of pitching in the division.
@scottcoleman55 I‚Äôm guessing if you didn‚Äôt like the first two seasons, it‚Äôs not going to get much better.
@TBotkin1 @Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Sure.. on Jan 29. all we can do is speculate. It‚Äôs fair to say ATL played great in 2018 but equally fair to say they overachieved. Also fair to say others in the division may have underachieved. Right now, I see stronger rotations right now in division and improved offenses.
@TBotkin1 @Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN So.. you expect the Braves to continue that sort of good luck vs deGrom or is it likely that the Mets actually provide him with some additional run support. Because I honestly could go either way. We better hope have the the lead before Diaz and Familia enter though.
@santoniobrown Just to be clear here..  is it more likely that the Braves do better vs deGrom in 2019 or that the Mets actually score more than 2 runs vs the Braves to help him get some much needed run support. Because I can honestly go either way.
@Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN ATL may very well add a pitcher but right now they are still trailing behind other established rotations. Who you add matters. Speculation is worthless until we know more. And for as good is the top of the order projects, the bottom of the order is questionable.
@Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Atlanta went 10-9 vs Wash. deGrom in 6 starts vs ATL gave up 2 or fewer runs in each start. Point is that right now ATL has likely the third best rotation in division. That wasn‚Äôt necessarily an issue last year, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be this year.
@jase1129 @santoniobrown The point of this is simply this.. we play the Mets, Nats, and Phils each 19 times. Two of those have stronger 1-3 guys. Soroka winning head-to-head over deGrom is great but that is only once. drGrom gave up 2 or fewer ER in each of his 6 games vs ATL in 2018.
@kendh It‚Äôs certainly reasonable to think the Braves are better right now vs. this time in 2018. It is also reasonable to think that the Braves could be better right now IF they added a piece (Brantley, Pollock, Corbin, Keuchel, Harper or Puig). That is the disconnect.
@santoniobrown No reason to be rustled. Interesting,  that you have taken offense to counter arguments to your opinion. Comparing me to professional baseball players is interesting straw-man tactic.
@Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Adds a starter?? Any starter? Like Gio? That seemingly takes away the argument of having such a deep and talented pool of young guys when you bury them behind Julio Teheran and a pitcher like Gio Gonzalez.
@Ray21Tyler @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Well I seem to remember Atlanta scoring a combined 0 runs in Game 1 and Game 2 of the NLDS. So I wouldn‚Äôt talk so negatively of the Mets offense when the Braves didn‚Äôt score vs quality pitching when it mattered.
@McCoyJonathan @santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Pitching from the bullpen?? That will be incredible if true!
@santoniobrown No doubt we have depth.. but the guys listed except one have combined for less than 15 mlb starts. Not saying they won‚Äôt be great, but any reliance on them to be difference makers in this division should be tempered. And including Julio leaves only spot in the 5-man rotation.
@santoniobrown @KnockahomaNTN Mets: deGrom, Thor, and Wheeler	Mats: Scherzer, Stras, and Corbin	Braves: Folty, Newk, and Gausman 		One of those things is not like the others..

@santoniobrown I don‚Äôt think the argument is that the division was weak, but rather the division underachieved. Using the Nationals as your example, they had an ‚Äúexpected W/L‚Äù of 90 wins. The concern is not about last year being weak, but this year being more balanced and teams being healthy.

@Bigsky1014keegs @DOBrienATL It‚Äôs pretty simple.. Harper is an elite player. He makes this team or any team better. The fact that the Nationals never won anything with him doesn‚Äôt the fact that they were better with him. To win it all is difficult, why not make it easier with an elite player.
@Bigsky1014keegs @DOBrienATL Do you realize that ATL hasn‚Äôt made it past the Divisional Series since 2001? That isn‚Äôt changing with the current roster.
