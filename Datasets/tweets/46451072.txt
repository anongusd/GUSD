@Tamias7 @GMOGottaGo you have good points. No candidate is perfect. I'm angry that Bernie voted against the #BradyBill more than one time.
@Tamias7 @GMOGottaGo See, you're getting sucked in. You don't realize that you're representing the #statusquo. She's making history.
@Tamias7 @JeanetteJing it's clear you haven't voted in a lot of presidential elections.
@Tamias7 I understand you haven't gotten to your midcareer yet for a #RealityCheck. It's not about sex. She's the ONLY woman to get here.
@ProgresveRebel Do realize how impossible it is for women to get to where she is? This is a #RealityCheck. How can you think your equal?
@Tamias7 @GMOGottaGo You think Bernie/Trump will? Your career and life will be 100% better under a HRC presidency. W/O her is the #statusquo
