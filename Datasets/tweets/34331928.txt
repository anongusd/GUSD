@HomerWhite @michaeljames86 @slewfan @jmauney 7.7 % unemployment rate is a joke, i have put out 50plus apps and have 2 part time jobs!
@HomerWhite @michaeljames86 @slewfan @jmauney Ya the economy is terrible in Northern Mi, part time and seasonal jobs that is it!
@Jbuchin3 you truly have become posessed by the the force!
@HomerWhite @michaeljames86 @slewfan @jmauney The problem is at least where I live no one has ANY money to pay for anything!
@DrMaxE @KentAtwater @slewfan @jmauney @homerwhite Thats how it worked in Rome, keep the masses entertained, and distracted!

Hey New Yorkers your Governor sounded just like a third world dictator ranting and raving about gun control! How did you elect that idiot!
@danstrnad Because he can lie and get away it he is NEVER held accountable on any double talk!
@danstrnad That is how he has ran his whole political career at every level character assasination just like he did to Romney he is ruthless
@danstrnad What they don't understand is that his goal is to eliminate any opposition that is what he has done his whole career!
@danstrnad It s funny we all can see it why can't they, he uses every opportunity w the complacent media to blame the conservatives
@danstrnad Believe us conservatives are bewildered, its like they are on somekind of valium induced trance!
@danstrnad Thats what I keep saying if the republicans can't do it they should hire a damn PR firm!
@danstrnad How about Prez Pinnochio I never seen a guy that can lie the way that he can!
When is  somebody  gonna  tell Mayor Nanny state to shut the F______UP
@southsalem @guypbenson So what else is new thats all he does is lie!

Excuse me but didn't O'bama swear to hold up the Constitution, then why is he going to stomp on the Second amendment the he swore to hold up
@bsommerfield I had that over Thanksgiving, felt like someone beat me with a rubber hose, didn't think the human body held so much fluid LOL
How the hell did Florida re-elect that nutcase Alan Grayson to Congress he a frinkin loon!
Here we go again 155,000 jobs in December, how many were part time and temps for the shopping season, watch January's numbers!
@danstrnad @AngieMancuso The  Republicans are worse PR people I have ever seen they can't articulate worth a crap!
@danstrnad @AngieMancuso As I said typical Washington, but no rebuttle from Boeghner of why they didn't vote on it he should explain why!
@danstrnad @AngieMancuso What people don't know is that bill is loaded with stuff that has nothing to do with Sandy, typical Washington!
There is more to the damn economy than what the "DOW" does I am sick of hearing about it!
Life is good for ole Barry he comes in gets what he wants as the Republicans cave again then jets off to Hawaii w Michelle my Bell!
When your "Rich" employer does not give you a raise or cuts your hrs you can thank your great president for sticking up for the middleclass
What a surprise O'Bama bargains like the true tinpan marxist that he is!
Real noble of ole Barry to go on Meet The Press, why didn't he go on Fox News Sunday, can't lie on that program!
I told all my Dem friends &amp; relatives that if they voted O'Bama back in office he was coming after their guns, they said I was nuts! Hmmmm
Biden gets a raise hes such a buffoon he should pay the taxpayers for masquerading as a vice-president!
I would take Tim Tebow anyday over fricking Merril Hoge, he sucked when he played and he sucks as an analyst!
@Nick_Viau Minus 33 has a gray 230grm merino pullover 2XL Closout $35.00
Merry Christmas to all!
@Nick_Viau LaCrosse boots are awesome gonna need them w all the damn snow we got!
"Republicans have a problem saying yes to me" because your policies suck and are bad for the country! Nothing you say is based on fact!
@Talkmaster I agree my son looked at buying a firearm at a show still had to go thru all the background checks! Its all O'Bamas B.S.
Somebody in the House needs to put a fricking boot up John boohoos rear end and wise him to O'Bamas charades is he that damn gullible!
@Nick_Viau I think New years especially with the shit storm coming your way!
@Nick_Viau wouldn't need them up feels like spring at the moment!

@Jbuchin3 Heading in the woods for a morning sit, maybe i can get some solace there!
@Jbuchin3 I agree!
who cares how the shooter got the weapons or what type they were, it doesn't change anything, nor will more gun control!
I have also made myself a vow that I will NOT be watching any news this weekend, let the the families have some respect!
i am totally dismayed at the 24hr news coverage of this tragedy we really have become a culture of people that relishes misery!
@ghost1066 ya  I am going out too, gotta work in the PM and there is a rain predicted in the afternoon they might be movin good luck see ya
@ghost1066 it was almost 50 yesterday and in the 40s today cools off in 20s at nite
@ghost1066 i have been told that our deer get a heavy winter coat, if it warms up like it has thats why they move more at nite
@ghost1066 amazing how deer in differant areas react to the weather patterns, after a snow you will see deer at all times of the day
@ghost1066 It moves them up here they look for food sources as soon as we get any!
@ghost1066 Our temps since Tues have been in the 40s even less movement now, most of the snow is gone again!
@ghost1066 not here they only move when they have too, on my cam its always between midnight and 5:30 am
@JanSimpson @Pudingtane Its sad but its all about political gain, with this crowd!
@Pudingtane @JanSimpson I hate to say it but its all for show with this guy, as they say never let a crisis go to waste!
@ghost1066 I have 2 tags, but my deer have all went nocturnal, all kinds of sign but everything is moving at nite!
@ghost1066 my point exactly, how the hunting?
@ghost1066 And by the way didn't some guy in China kill 22 people with a knife?
@ghost1066 This is outrageous, that damn MSNBC is the ring leader of the whole thing, that network is a disgrace!
What a country, a national tragedy and it is being used for politcal gain already, give it a frickin rest!
Howcan a dumb ass like Michael Moore, speak for all the union people when he himself does everything he can not to hire union workers!
As usual in Michigan if Unions don't get there way they all take time off their jobs to go protest, no one in the Private sector can do that
@EngBernie I got some big doezillas but they are really elusive, coulda shot several during gun season, no permit!
@EngBernie or this one http://t.co/eDSblXeP
@EngBernie smaller 3pt but he made it thru gun season waitin for this guy! http://t.co/OCFcHlRC
@EngBernie no shots yet passed on a couple earlier, pretty much doe hunting now!
@bitslaw Ya only if they agree with the arrogant ass!
High 20s and a little white stuff in the air maybe the deer will move this AM, gonna be a cold sit!
@Nick_Viau Sending my LaCrosse Burly boots back, started develop cracks by the ankle area not good for a waterproof boot!

@RobMartinAriz I got 2 grand kids all the debt, the loss of personal liberty, O'Bama care alone is going to bankrupt this country!
See what 30 years of  socialist indoctrination thru the public education system will get you a bunch Dumb down all about me voters!
@TedNugent Couldn't agree more Liberty, freedom, and the Constitution lost out the people want too much free stuff!
Too depressed going in the woods maybe nature and my longbow will clear my head! I fear for this nation!

@Nick_Viau its real close as sleevegoes you make the call its around a 36 if his measurements are accurate! 65% wool acrylicwon't shrink
@britneysbsafari @nick_viau I was in the apparell biz for 30years One thing I know is fabric and fit!
@Nick_Viau @britneysbsafari if shoulder to cuff is 26in you add 10in from shoulder seam to bottom of cuff it sounds like a 36in sleeve
@Nick_Viau usually if 26 is under arm you ad 10in to get sleeve length!
@Nick_Viau its a no name brand for sure but with that Acrylic you can was it without worrying about shrinkage, as long as it fits!
@Nick_Viau Wool blend 65% whats nice is that its nylon lined! would you use as layer garment?

@Mia_Anstine @KimmieDG Us longbow guys shoot from all type of postions, target vertical u, heavily canted,  1knee, 2knees etc!

@Nick_Viau @CountryJackG Cheboygan for me
@CountryJackG @Nick_Viau agreed its about arrow placement for sure
@CountryJackG No but some of the courses are real hard on woods, and if you are shooting w a lg group, that can be hard on your arrows
@CountryJackG @Nick_Viau agreed its about Kinetic energy and accuracy, wheel guys are usually concerned about FPS
@LadyImpactOhio @BarackObama ya especially if Michelle my bell is there eating her unhealthy food
@CountryJackG mostly wood arrows cause I like making them its an addiction, but I do shoot carbons at 3D events
@CountryJackG @Nick_Viau most straight limbed longbows are a lot slower as far FPS, anything around 200fps for a trad bow is real fast
@CountryJackG ya i here y there I hunt with my longbows even during the firearm deer season, I do hunt with a TC Renegade muzzleloader too
@Nick_Viau Bring it!
@LadyImpactOhio maybe he will put a used solar panel from Solyndra on the top of it!

Is Pelosi the most incoherent speaking politician EVER to be elected, what the hell kind of district does she come from! Idiotville?

@SQLTentMaker @Nick_Viau learned my lesson the hard way after this, any arrow even vaguely look suspect they are gone & I am wearing a glove
@SQLTentMaker @Nick_Viau They say your body pushes foriegn objects to the surface I was surpised how big the 1pc was no wonder my hand hurt

@Nick_Viau @dustinnewer Unless they are Sherwood shafts not more Douglas Fir for me, sticking with POC!
@Nick_Viau @dustinnewer Its pretty fricking scary to say the least, put me right to my knees, now I know why people shoot metal and carbon!
@dustinnewer @nick_viau it may have I wait a few days worried more about infection though!
@Nick_Viau @dustinnewer may have deflected it some, leather is tough!
@dustinnewer @nick_viau that batch was inherently bad, bought them at K-Zoo 2yrs ago should have retired them, POSs!
@dustinnewer @Nick_Viau okay but hand is real sore especially my index finger, wearing a batters glove from now on, freaked me out bad!
Recovery is under way, our local hospital filed for bankruptcy is closed, 400 jobs gone, I wonder that will show up in the BHO labor stats!

@danstrnad @cybersly Thats an understatement! another Libtard!
S &P said  4Trillions in cuts, Tea Party wanted CutCapBal, O'Bama wanted 0 cuts they settle for a 1Tril and its the Tea Partys fault, WTF!
@JoshDickerson7 @Cajunhiker What he is a sociopath too!
i believe the real reason why O'b Adm does not want to cut any departments is the fear of what the cuts would do to the unemployment #s!
There should be two types of labor statistics: One for those employed by the private  sector and One for the governmental sector!
@Cateontheright I was on Unempl for over a year finally got a 719hr position with the State, pays good, no bennies, and erratic hours!
@Cateontheright In Michigan there are few FULL time jobs,  I am living  proof of that!
@Cateontheright @foxandfriends I would like to see the data if these jobs are seasonal or full time, in NO Mi most of the jobs are seasonal!
@BillHemmer Wait till all the summer seasonal jobs end and watch the rate then!
Crappy GM junk drivers side power window broke  for the second time bring back crank windows!

WTF is Washingtons problem Sucky plan from the house, NO plan from the Dem Senate and ZERO from the so called Prez freeze the  spending !
@Southernupland Ya hang em all I say!
Hey fellow Tea partiers we now reduced to Hobbits, excuse me but wasn't it a hobbit that toppled the ever watching eye!
@Southernupland fricking hackers at work
@Cateontheright Man tht water is always in the low 50s and 40s even on the top been Kayaking in it!
The thing is there are NO real cuts as long as they keep cutting from their baseline budgets, cause the budgets are always going up!
@Cateontheright I live by it TOO cold to swim in even in the middle of July!
@ghost1066 no that it is beyond my help gonna shop for a new one today
How  about the congress just do away with BASELINE budget tactics, watch how fast they save money, that is what the dirty little secret is!

@ghost1066 I may put my hanger up today as it is not real hot , 66in is a little tougher to manuever in a tree, in a ground blind not bad!

@ghost1066 @coyotehaven @A_Reel_Ladymy son shot a deer with one a cuople of years ago dropped it in its tracks  I use 8mm Mauser custom

@ghost1066 I don't have that much on it but I want it paid off by the Great lakes longbow shoot in August!
@ghost1066 I have a half a notion to contact the guy and see if he can build and R/D longbow about 60 inches long!
@ghost1066 I wish I had my MC paid off cause I would have that Zebra wood one in a heart beat!
I am beginning to think O'Bama is totally dillusional, he causes the problems and then says we need balance to solve them, he is a loon!
@ghost1066 Nick is looking for a bow for his wife he should check out  the 40 lbers
@ghost1066 @coyotehaven  morning

@ghost1066 i will remember that need to load up on some more shafts and full length feathers, prolly buy at Gr lakes long bow shoot
@ghost1066 As y can tell I love making them, there is so much you can to make them differant, I like them all unique!
@ghost1066 I take it real personally when i lose one  I can always send you more if you  lose them all I get bored with a certain look!
@ghost1066 Maybe not I have lost them for months and the fletching is still usable, I hate losing arrows
@ghost1066 It is amzing how them damn things can burrow in the ground! Try a hook or garden tine, I have found them with my metal detector

@ghost1066 @Nick_Viau When I am grouping real tight I shoot 3 arrows in a group
@Nick_Viau @ghost1066 that is so true
@ghost1066 those are really heavy shafts 75/80 I have only broke 2 so far out 36 of them and I split those at the nocks
@ghost1066 Must  be the way the fletching comes off the riser those 2 are nice and tight though
@ghost1066 Not bad at all even your high ones arn't bad!

@ByronYork Typical Liberals are only good at spending other peoples money!
Listened to Sarah Palin speech in Wisconsin, she knocked it out of the park, I still think she is a force to be reconned with!
@oreillyfactor Looked like it didn't work, I watched her speech she was great! they looked like Marxist mob!
April 17th in Northern Mi and we have accumulating snow, some spring so far!
@ByronYork Of course she won't she is a liberal, they will keep counting votes till they get the results they want ala Al Franken!

@MonicaCrowley @AllenWest @ThadMcCotter @MicheleBachmann Right on,at least some of them have the guts to do whats right!
As usual Bi-Partisan means agreeing with Dems! Now O'Bama is taking credit for the deal, what the hell did he do? MIA
@Nick_Viau prolly should have kept that blonde one I had!
@Nick_Viau watched the Foo Fighters on VH1C last nite they were playing lots of them, you had the EPi version didn't you!
Harry Reid is too senile to head the Senate, I swear he suffers from dementia!
@JoeTalkShow Totally agree with you on the budget, but we should all no that everything from now on will be about O'Bama getting re-elected
Great analogy of the budget, Dems had all three Branches of Gov., failed to take action now its everbody elses fault! typical Liberals!
How ironic welfare checks will be paid, but O'Bama will not sign bill to pay the military if there is a shutdown! I say what B......SHT!
@KarlRove exactly the Repubs are the worst at the PR game who had Congress for the last 2 plus years!
hey I got an idea why doesn't O'Bama give up his limo and buy his own gas for a week! Or why doesn't he just trade himself in!
O'Bama tells a guy with an SUV that if he doesn't like the gas mileage maybe he should trade it in! Hey  Pres how about WE trade you in!
@GOPLeader watched a guy fill up his Diesel pickup $100 for 24 fricking gallons, now that is pain at the pump!
@Nick_Viau figured it would be! That Predator shoots like crap!
@JonahNRO Remember AL Franken in Minn!
@JoeTalkShow Its funny how the Dems all forget that it was THEM that did NOT pass a budget when they controlled all the branches!
@griffij6 : Kennedy, LBJ, Nixon, Ford, Carter ( buffoon but not a serial Liar) REAGAN, Bush, Billy, Bush and OBummer by far the worst!
Tues was the last nite indoor archery league , just maybe this will finally mean the end winter! LOL
Dems control all 3 branches of for 2 years and   WOULD not pass a budget and O'Bama tells the GOP to act like grownups, lets go golfing!
snow in Northern Michigan in April and gas about to hit $4.00 a fricking gallon and O'Bama golfs! Nice spring so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@johnboehner Ya and he doesn't give a rip how high the prices get, cause it does not effect him!
Anybody with a GM truck from 99 to 03, check your brake lines, they are prone to corrosion, GM knows they are bad & are doing nothing to fix
@griffij6 Did he have Danica with him?
@JimDeMint Thank you, I wish more in congress would stand on conservative principles like you are!
@griffij6 @Nick_Viau We both shoot Royals for our main bows, and we both have Hunters!
@RepMikePence Way to go take a stand enough of this crap!
@KarlRove @hotairblog His claims are a distortion of the truth as always, he distorts so often that he doesn't even know when he is lieing!
@SpeakerBoehner DO NOT vote for  the continuing resolution!
@SpeakerBoehner Lets get to it before we are all broke!
When is congress going to get serious about oil production in this country & tell the enviros to stick it! Repubs need to grow a pair!

@griffij6 @newtgingrich Totally agree they are the reason that oil is headed to over $100 a barrel!
How the hell after 2 years  of Pelosi can Any Republican sit next to her at anything, not alone the SOTU, watch out you are being played!
With all the snow storms this winter there should be a lot of "Shovel ready jobs" out there, at least in the East!
Keep track tonite on how many times O'Bama says " I will not rest until" its seems as though the man never sleeps!
@IngrahamAngle Are you sure it was not the FCC! LOL
I have a question who is sitting next to Pelosi tonite???????????
Good thing is I should be home from in time from the archery range to watch Paul Ryan, give the Republican response!
