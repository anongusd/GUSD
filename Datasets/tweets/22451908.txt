Sen. Gillibrand tells me she's "grateful" that Trump is focused "on diplomacy &amp; a political solution w/North Korea, as opposed to a military one—I just would hope that he would, perhaps, engage with our allies &amp; South Korea more, so that we can reach a more productive solution."

Michael Cohen's greatest regret? Lying to @FLOTUS, he tells lawmakers.
Cohen says he committed crimes to benefit Donald Trump because he was so "memorized" by him. Says that being around him was "intoxicating" and that working for him "monopolized" his life. But since taking office, "he has become the worst version of himself."
In his opening testimony just now to Congress, Michael Cohen says that Donald Trump did not instruct him to lie to Congress, but by repeatedly claiming that there was no Russian business (when there was), "in his way he was telling me to lie."

At the WH I asked Sec. Mnuchin if POTUS could extend a March 1 deadline for a China deal so he can meet with Xi in Beijing after Kim. He said if issues remain unresolved, "I think President Trump expects that he's going to sit down with President Xi &amp; address those issues."

China and the United States are literally coming to the table to discus trade at the G20. The dinner table that is, according to Larry Kudlow, who's taking his turn at the White House podium today.
President Trump admits he officially qualifies as a politician. "Now I'm a politician, I can't stand it....but I've only had one race, look at the result here we are. And we're only going to have one more race, and hopefully that will be even better, because we've produced."
President Trump asked by pool how he feels seeing women and children run from tear gas. "First of all the tear gas is a very minor form of the tear gas itself. It’s very safe. But you really say, why is a parent running up into an area where they know the tear gas is forming?"
I asked the president if it's appropriate for border patrol to be tear-gassing children as he departed the White House: "'We didn't. We don't use it on children," he told me.

President Trump explaining why he's campaigning against Manchin, despite his voting for Kavanaugh, says that he called the Democratic senator and asked for it, but Manchin waited to give it until it was clear that the GOP had the 50 they needed.
Patrick Morrisey just claimed at the president's rally that Joe Manchin "helped offer one of the most radical gun control bills in our country" while making reference to the Manchin-Toomey background check bill.

Who is abusing or defrauding the United States' asylum system? Almost everybody, says President Trump as he claims that "bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow" the ones that are on their way if he doesn't act.
President Trump: "These illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States, and they should turn back now because they are wasting their time."
Trump to @CBNNews on "unfair treatment" by media (which he called "left-wing" at his rally): "It has been from the time I announced &amp; a lot of that has to do with the fact that I'm Republican, I'm conservative, and many other reasons, and probably me too." https://t.co/KKOycVTjEh

In Charlotte, President Trump says "everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction" and proclaims "we must unify as a nation in peace love and harmony." Then goes into a riff on the media's role, leading to booing in the direction of the press section.
Sen. Thom Tillis at POTUS' rally in Charlotte: "I also want to thank the president for what happened today when that ANIMAL who sent bombs and sent letters and threatened people - regardless of their political party, there's no place for that in the United States."
It's business as usual here in Charlotte. The crowd just burst into the chat "CNN sucks" at the president's rally during one of the pre-POTUS speeches.
@MattReynolds615 @SarahHuckabee Thanks for stopping by to say hi!
And yes, I can't wait for North Carolina BBQ. Now taking your reccomendations for Charlotte!

The president declined to stop and speak to press asking if he agrees the bomb threats are an act of terrorism. He's on Marine One now, en route to AF1 and on to Wisconsin.
President Trump in his first remarks on the bombs (aside from his earlier tweet) says that Americans must "come together" and he is "extremely angry" about the attempted violence: https://t.co/ydaxAQv9AC

Kellyanne says of Hillary to me this am: "It's one thing to disagree - she can even call half of the country deplorable &amp; irredeemable - we didn't much care &amp; we certainly knew it would help us ... But this level of discourse, I find to be less inspiring and more inciting."
President Trump on the missing journalist from Saudi Arabia to @jeffmason1 on the South Lawn: "I don't know anything. No. I don't have any updates."
President Trump specifically said that Ivanka would be "dynamite" as United Nations ambassador but it would be "nepotism" to appoint her. Later, to another set of reporters he laughed and said he believed that the appointment would be supported by CNN: https://t.co/atFgVIyDZo
I also asked the president about his meeting with Kanye at the White House on Thursday. He told me: "He's been a terrific guy. He loves what we're doing for African-American jobs, for so many different things." https://t.co/RS9gztUKAs
The president also said he likes his daughter for the United Nations position - but then he'd be hit with "nepotism" complaints. He importantly did not rule it out.
President Trump tells me that he is happy that Fox hired Hope Hicks. Tells me she is a "winner" on the South Lawn.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had lunch today with the president, comes out, makes a minute of remarks on NoKo and Nikki Haley and retreats back into the White House without taking questions from reporters.

Has the president spoke to Sen. Collins? Sen Manchin? WH press secretary Sarah Sanders said that he's spoken to senators but didn't say who. "We look forward to a final vote happening this weekend."
More Sarah Sanders on whether the WH has the votes: "We sure hope so. I think we should. I think Justice Kavanaugh has demonstrated over the last several weeks exactly what you'd want out of a Supreme Court justice. He's done that over the last several months..."
Sarah Sanders asked by reporters if the WH has the votes: "We sure hope so. I think we should."
The White House referred me to the president's tweet when I asked for a statement on the Kavanaugh vote. It's below. Remains to be seen if President Trump will speak publicly today. He currently has no open press events. https://t.co/XMaoVOkNyJ
@GotMade It is entirely accurate to say that with his help they carried it toward a final vote this weekend. That's not a commentary on how the final vote will end up but a factual statement about what happened today.

Worth noting that Trump's assault tonight wasn't only on DOJ - he also brought up "the top of" the FBI and claimed, "If it doesn't straighten out properly - I want them to do their job - I will get involved, and I will get in there if I have to."

What North Korea is saying about #TrumpKim: https://t.co/6XSMhC6iG3 | What POTUS is saying about it today: https://t.co/ryZYbqODTW
A gem from the president's presser in Singapore that took place while you were (probably) sleeping: "[Kim] is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough...You can take 1 out of 10,000 could not do it."
President Trump on the video we just saw: "That was a tape that we gave to Chairman Kim and his people."
"There can only be two results.  One of moving back or one of moving forward," the dramatic trailer said.
Press is currently being subjected to a theatrical government video that ran in English second and links North Korea and the U.S. together with images of Trump and Kim at the "media avail" where we are awaiting POTUS.
President Trump, summing up his blind date with Kim, assesses that the North Korean dictator has a "great personality" and is "very smart" --- a "good combination."

Dennis Rodman says on CNN that Kim is "more like a big kid" and he "loves to have a good time." Also, he wants to come to America.
As someone who is routinely present when President Trump meets with visiting leaders at the White House, what is striking watching the spray with Kim is how POTUS approached him with the same relaxed demeanor as he has other foreign leaders.
The president's chief economic adviser did not make the trip to Singapore. After the G7 summit he returned to Washington, where the president reveals that he has been hospitalized at a military medical center following a heart attack. https://t.co/lD3KBunvNw
President Trump has arrived at the summit site, Capella Resort on Sentosa island, and Kim Jong-un is en route.
The reason that Trudeau even came up is because the president's chief trade and economic advisers ripped the Canadian PM up and down on the Sunday shows. POTUS then sent several tweets on the same topic at the top of his first full day in Singapore for the #TrumpKimSummit https://t.co/zi3sH2vx0y

Also on the White House call was Kellyanne Conway, who said that Pompeo is a "trusted adviser" to the president, partly because he delivers helpful information to him. What information Pompeo may have brought back from North Korea, she would not say.
The White House just concluded a call on Mike Pompeo's nomination to be secretary of state on which Sen. Tom Cotton insisted that he is "not concerned" about mounting Democratic no votes &amp; asserted"Mike Pompeo will be confirmed as the next secretary of state."
Trump did NOT say, for the record, that the talks weren't with Kim. He said: "Well let's leave it a little bit short of that, but we have talks at the highest level, and it's going very well but we'll see what happens."
White House rolling back Trump's suggestion that he talked to Kim Jong-un personally: "The President said the administration has had talks at the highest levels and added that they were not with him directly," @PressSec says.
CHASER: President Trump told reporters during a pool spray with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe today in Palm Beach that he was adding golf to the schedule. "We're going to sneak out tomorrow morning and play a round of golf, if possible, and if we have the time," POTUS said. https://t.co/v9TXfwJKIq

President Trump says he was going to ask the crowd whether Sen. Rubio is better in English or Spanish, but the crowd answered his question by standing for the Spanish-language version. Rubio tells him that he said, "I just saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico."

Why didn't the WH tell us POTUS had accepted Kim's invitation (especially since he was the one who said SK had an announcement)? @presssec: "Because those were the individuals that had directly spoken with the North Koreans &amp; they were the ones that were making that response."
That was after @PressSec told another reporter who asked if the meeting might not take place in May, "We haven’t set a time or a location.  Those things have yet to be determined."
Yesterday, South Korea's national security adviser told us -- at the White House -- that Trump and Kim would meet by May. Was there a misunderstanding, I ask @presssec, given her multiple assertions that neither a time or place had been set? "No," she said.

Trump told the New York Times: "I actually talked about Russian adoption with him." Adoption is tied to the Magnitsky sanctions.

"Today was all about infrastructure," Scott said outside the White House.
Scott didn't want to comment on Comey testimony at all. "I've been here all day. Got here this morning, I've been in meetings all day."
I asked Gov. Rick Scott outside the WH if Comey's testimony came up in his meetings today. He said it did not.
Asked by @ZekeJMiller if she could find out if there's a taping system in Oval, @SHSanders45 says: "Sure I'll try to look under the couches"

Sarah Huckabee Sanders' says at the top that today's briefing is off camera because the president is speaking today.
If Trump did tape their conversations, Comey says his feelings won't be hurt - POTUS can feel free to release them.

@letsroll0331 He said he was not. Did not back Nunes up.
Now curious to see what Senate Intel heads have to say after seeing docs - Schiff did not back up Nunes charge.
@letsroll0331 I am very interested in what was in those documents and finding out what it was that bothered Nunes so much.
In order to know that it gave Schiff same docs as Nunes, WH would have to know exactly what Nunes saw.
How would the WH know that it gave Schiff the same classified docs as Nunes unless WH staff gave Nunes the docs in the first place?
After Sunday shows same q remains: How does the WH know that the docs it showed Schiff are the same exact documents Nunes saw?
@Afterseven How does the WH know that it was giving Schiff the same exact documents that Nunes saw?

RT @taddevine: If Trump were a contestant on The     Apprentice he would be fired today.
Pelosi's take: American people expressed their support for [ACA]. That message became very clear to our colleagues on the Republican side.
Meanwhile, the WH just sent out a memo declaring today: "A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OF GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY"
To recap, POTUS says he wanted bill to pass &amp; it was good, but had things he didn't like, so on to tax reform until Obamacare explodes.
Earlier @presssec didn't want to play the blame game - now @POTUS has picked a target: Democrats.
The REAL "losers" today, according to Trump: Schumer and Pelosi - because the have to "own" Obamacare now.
TRUMP: "I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode."
Former President Obama's office said it had "no comment' on the situation via email after Ryan said architects of Obamacare must be pleased.
RYAN: "Yes, this does make tax reform more difficult. but it does not in any way make it impossible."
Paul Ryan is asked about House Freedom Caucus - says that there wasn't enough votes for the bill from that group.
We had no consensus "...that's why I thought the wise thing to do..." was pull the bill, Ryan says
"This is a setback, no two ways about it" - Paul Ryan
So Ryan came to the WH to speak to Trump, then had to call him back and say, it's not going to happen, per remarks.
Ryan says that doing "big" things is hard.
Paul Ryan says this is "growing pains" - and that HE told TRUMP they had to pull the bill.
As soon as the room has been cleared he will speak to pool. https://t.co/yvtSTcTn6I

@ratfink_maloney He was talking about the unmasking of his name by the NYT and the copy of his conversation that ran in The Smoking Gun.
Stone also said: "I am a friend of the president...I have the privilege of talking to him from time to time" https://t.co/5a9Tt394it
Stone told me that Russian collusion claims are a "fiction of the Clinton campaign" &amp; he wants to face his accusers https://t.co/5a9Tt394it
Well, tonight I spoke with @RogerJStoneJr about the allegations against him: https://t.co/5a9Tt394it
"They have talked from time to time but I don’t think any time recently," Spicer said of Trump and Stone.
Spicer told me Stone "is somebody the President has known for a long time" &amp; "worked briefly on the campaign."
Earlier today you'll recall that I asked Sean Spicer about Roger Stone after he came up in commentary on "hangers on."
Now Sean Spicer offering his services to write headlines since he sees quite different ones coming out of today's hearing than reporters.
In briefing Spicer calls Carter Page a "hanger on" and distances POTUS from Roger Stone.

Trump said Obama was "tapping my phone." and yet the WH is now claiming that's not necessarially what he meant https://t.co/pGB04z2iP0
Trump said wiretapping but he meant "surveillance broadly" when he accused Obama, WH says https://t.co/pGB04z2iP0

Take it down folks. That assertion is likely to come back up. @charliespiering
Sean Spicer to @charliespiering:"This bill will land on the president's desk, he will sign it, we will repeal Obamacare."
IE no guarantee that conservatives will get the things that Trump/WH is promising them if they go along with phase one.
The problem: There's no guarantee that GOP will be able to get 60 votes to pass anything in phase 3, including comp across state lines.
Price admitted to me at the WH that it will take some leg action to sell insurance across state lines. That will require 60 votes.
So much of what conservatives want out of health reform is dependent on phase 3 of this plan - which needs 60 votes in the Senate to pass.
Trump says phases two and three will have key measures missing now, like selling insurance across state lines https://t.co/LulTKsgCdm
Phase two of repeal &amp; replace is exec action. Phase three is non-budget items that can't go through reconciliation https://t.co/LulTKsgCdm
The healthcare bill the GOP just rolled out is only phase one - there are two more phases https://t.co/LulTKsgCdm
@GruberDr Show me where those articles claimed, as Trump specifically said, that President Obama ordered the government to wire tap him.
Pence also had some zingers about his use of an AOL account and how that was the revelation that embarrassed him. #gridiron

Talking about the Oval @VP said: “I gotta tell you, every time I look at that portrait of Hamilton, I feel like there’s a lecture coming on”
On @presssec not getting dinner: "When the waiter asked you what you wanted... you shouldn’t have said, ‘Sit down, I never called on you.’”

WH today pointed me to Trump's O'Reilly interview when he said: “I’m going to set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence"
WH yesterday: "He named the task force, and the vice president is starting to gather names of individuals to be part of it."
By saying Trump "named" a voter fraud task force, WH meant he'd announced that he intends to form one - but hasn't yet.
The WH said yesterday that POTUS had "named" a voter fraud task force, but clarified to me today that he has not in fact formed one.

And now #LastTimeTrumpPaidTaxes is trending on Twitter in the United States.
@genethelawyer That seems to be the case. But Clinton hasn't been accusing him of illegal conduct.
"...city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions."
"That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes..."
"Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business...to pay no more tax than legally required."
"The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained," it says.
Trump statement does not deny core allegation in NYT story - that he may not have paid federal taxes for 18 years.

Notable: Clinton didn't take shouted questions at today's news conference (she did multiple times last week at the end)

Hillary Clinton will talk to traveling press again this morning, her campaign advises. 3/3 since press began riding the same plane as HRC.
Trump answered questions succinctly. Clinton did not. And it ate up her time. She never really got beyond playing defense.
Putin wants to call me brilliant, I'll take it, says Trump. It's not going to get him anywhere, he adds.
CHINA! Drink!
How Hillary is spending her afternoon: In meetings, according to the pool report. Tonight she'll participate in NBC's forum, as will Trump.

Virginia Gov. @TerryMcAuliffe - Hillary's 'closest friend' according to Donald Trump. #TPP
The people of Michigan can 'kiss' their jobs goodbye unless Trump is elected, he says..Otherwise, Mexico will become the car capitol.
Trump just now: Clinton would rather give a job to refugee than an out-of-work African-American.
Trump's pitch to the black community: "What the hell do you have to lose?"
Trump's campaign manager this morning: "I absolutely hope this campaign pivots to substance because we want to challenge her on the issues."

I tell @RAYGUNshirts owner HRC description of business is he makes "ironic" t-shirts. "Not always ironic, sometimes we're direct," he says.

@LEE0591 I'm glad everyone learned something new!
@bamatek and used it as a springboard for her stump line about how she will break down barriers...or, or or, you get the idea.
@bamatek I agree it's hard to answer it well, but she could have, for instance, told a story about someone she met on the trail
In the end, HRC said she couldn't condense 50 years of conversations, or pick just one person.
Clinton asked about the most meaningful conversation she's had with a black person. Answer basically turns into a list of her black friends.
A time the press corps really wanted to clap - when @edatpost told HRC news orgs that travel w/her really wish she'd take our qs more often.
It's a difficult speech for HRC to give, because it's before journalists - who are not supposed to cheer or clap (though some in room are).
Clinton, about to make a slam on Trump, says to compare her plans to what her husb---opponent is talking about. Whoops! #NABJNAHJ16
