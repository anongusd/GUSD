My Brothers, don’t walk outside without reminding yourself you’re a King. Every time you look in the mirror.

When your Queen comes home to a clean house, kids settled, Dinner ready and she smiles. Yeah, I miss that.
I spent a decade raising kids, being a stay at home dad, military spouse, working wild shifts at night. Put my dreams on hold so the woman in my life could thrive. I would do it all again because love and support are important to me.
Be the Queen in my life and experience what true love is. I believe in uplifting the Woman in my life. Whatever you want to do, wherever you want to go, I’ll be there to support you. Your vision is important to me. We’re supposed to ride or die for each other.
I don’t wanna hear there are no good men left. Stop spreading that lie.

That’s right. https://t.co/ok1swXMzst

@drunkenrandom I mean let me keep it 💯 first, this is happening to me now. I’ve been waiting for this dude to look me in the eye and shake my hand like a man but he hides in the crib. I wasn’t raised that way so it’s weak to me.
I think it’s worse when someone leaves you (especially a spouse) and ends up dating a coworker right after. Trash B.
Do you think I’m wrong about this? I feel it’s disrespectful if a new man is around your kids at your ex’s house, but never tries to introduce himself to you. That’s weak to me.
I don’t even know how to feel. Maybe I convinced myself that you were gonna live forever because you brought me joy when I was surrounded by pain. I ran to your imagination to get lost in a world I wished I lived in. 		Rest In Peace Stan Lee. 😔 https://t.co/eMUtNXeFK9

Let’s keep it 💯. Without #cannabis I’d be in a grave. Doctors laughed at me when I suggested CBD, then prescribed more pills that made me suicidal and have more seizures. A year without seizures because of the herb. #CannabisSavedMyLife
The mental illness stigma. The epilepsy stigma. The cannabis stigma. I really don’t understand modern society.
So at this point of my life I don’t wanna hear anything negative from anyone. I paid my dues and I’m going to enjoy every opportunity I have now. With my sons by my side. Peace.

Ten years ago today I got married at 21 years old. Although it ended recently I have no regrets because I learned many valuable lessons. One lesson I can pass on to you is to make sure you love yourself first before trying to love someone else. God Bless.
Tomorrow would’ve been my 10 year wedding anniversary. Instead of sadness I feel joy. Sometimes what seems like the worst situation is actually a blessing. I have new love, I have my kids and I’m happier than I’ve ever been. 🙏🏽

I’ve been in a lot of pain for many years. Depression, suicide attempts, epilepsy. I’m tired. The energy I have left will be spent on helping the youth. I want to take action so life is better for them. I can’t rest ‘til I use every bit of strength to make their lives better.
I need a break from everything. I need to take care of myself. I should just drive and see where the road takes me. Go help some people, speak to the youth, share ideas with others. I have time. I’m just gonna Go.

@Niya_efffff Then I appreciate you. It’s a shame, and I know what you meant by your original question. It truly is an uphill battle that is so stressful at times. I know one day we’ll come out on top. I have hope.
@Niya_efffff Support the advocacy of cannabis for Veterans. Call for the end of mass production of harmful medicines given to us. Sign and share petitions, contact your local VA and ask how you can help improve the system. I can go on forever...
Cannabis For Veterans Now. I’m tired of seeing my Brothers and Sisters die. I’m asking people to please fight with us. Please.
@Niya_efffff Saying you can’t do anything is exactly the problem. Who’s gonna stand up for us?
I’d be a hypocrite if I just sat by and watched my military family not get the care they deserve. I’m willing to risk my life so Veterans find healing. Put a target on my back, I don’t care. Veterans Deserve Better Treatment. But y’all don’t hear me though.
Everybody’s so caught up in the latest gossip that it’s almost like people forgot Veterans are dying by the dozens daily. But y’all don’t hear me though.
I’m a young Veteran and I refuse to see my elders, and others my age, be treated like this.
I’ve grown tired of seeing fellow Veterans not get the proper care they’ve earned. We serve and come home to even more chaos.
Sitting here in this waiting room watching fellow Veterans be treated like cattle instead of people. But y’all don’t hear me though.
I really wish more people would pay attention. They give us pills that do more harm than good. Suicide amongst Vets is still astronomically high. Weed has been proven to heal us but they ignore the facts. But y’all don’t hear me though.
I’m at the VA right now and nearly every fellow Veteran in this waiting room is stressed out. This place really is hell just in case any civilians wanted to know.

@Chaddwith2ds But I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’ve seen people truly heal and conquer mental illness. I mean, it’s a Win if you simply get through your day with this pain. It’s all small steps; there is no elevator to being healed.
@Chaddwith2ds I think it depends on the person and their specific situation. Coping mechanisms and education are pretty much all we can do. We still don’t know a lot about the mind.
@Chaddwith2ds Be careful with that narrative. There are too many levels to mental illness to make a generic statement. Don’t feed the stigma.
As a Man who is mentally ill it always hurts to see someone go through the same pain. I wish people understood how strong the mind is and know every day is a living hell.

@six_182 I focus my energy on healing and my kids. I don’t have much energy to spare to fight the stigma right now.
Thank you, @TheMightySite 		❤️❤️ #keepfighting https://t.co/4rpOJXiv6Y
I need family and friends to understand that #epilepsy is more than seizures. I’m in pain most of the time, my memory is fried and depression would be an understatement. If you’re gonna fight with me thank you, if not please leave me alone. I’m trying to Live.

@AIRFORCE77 Lol what? I’m chillin, relaxing.
@AIRFORCE77 Discussion, yes.
@AIRFORCE77 It’s not an argument but okay
@AIRFORCE77 Key words: My experiences.
@AIRFORCE77 I never said they didn’t... 🤔
@AIRFORCE77 Life is hard for everyone. I never said it wasn’t. I’m speaking as a Black Man who’s lives on this Earth for almost 32 years. I use My experiences to teach My kids.
It took me 31 years but I finally love myself. I love the man I’ve become.
@AIRFORCE77 I don’t teach that to my kids. Color matters in the real world. They have to be prepared and understand that as Black Men it is harder. That’s reality.
Understand that all shades of Black are beautiful. Love Yourself.
@AIRFORCE77 I feel you bro. I just want us to focus our energy on things that matter.
Spend less time being offended and more time making a difference.
6 months without seizures never felt so good. We win together. #BeatEpilepsy https://t.co/2sALn4Nqhv

Last year I told friends and doctors I’d find a way to fight my seizures. Most were silent. Today makes 6 months without a seizure. Believe in yourself and make it happen. #BeatEpilepsy #CannabisSavedMyLife
@MrAmbitious12 Did I even have to answer that? 👀😂
@MrAmbitious12 But of course
@InMyRustyCage Thank you. CBD and THC.
Today is a beautiful day. Today I am 6 months seizure-free! I made a decision not only for myself but for my kids. I promised them I’d do whatever it takes to beat epilepsy. #Cannabis saved my life. 		Moral of the story: Take the leap if you truly want to Live. #BeatEpilepsy https://t.co/BfslxNCtam

@OhNo_ItsOjoh I’m in the fence about that black space at the top for all the tech. Screen is impressive but that notch is distracting

Let Cam Newton have fun. It's good for the game. He's confident, believes in his team and cares about his fans. Let that man work.
