Should have been clearer about point 2. Davis' only legal work was for Bill. If he's done any work for Hillary, it's been political in nature &amp; I don't think it's ever been paid. Not that it really matters, he obviously has Clinton ties &amp; is doing this gig to stay relevant.
@jeffjacobs79 He worked in that capacity for Bill Clinton, not Hillary. Don't believe he's ever worked for Hillary other than any political fundraising or volunteering he may have done.

You’re fooling yourself if you think you owned me on this tweet. My point was just that the two events were close by. There was lots of enthusiasm for O’Rourke which is no way cancels out the enthusiasm for Trump. That’s all.
El Paso police estimate a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 for the anti-Trump, anti-wall, pro-O’Rourke march and rally tonight.
O’Rourke spoke at a rally organized by several El Paso groups, not his own team. And the energy was at once pro-O’Rourke and anti-Trump. Don’t have a crowd count yet but it was certainly several thousand — and it included a mile-long walk. https://t.co/2H7R2X7AoR
This was only true in the corner of the field closest to the Trump rally. I walked around as O’Rourke spoke and all you could hear was him. Also, the crowd was definitely several thousand people.

A Washington Christmas for Trump? "My understanding is that if there's a shutdown tomorrow, that he'll still be here," Stephen Miller says on CNN.

Ryan called the meeting with Trump "productive." Is being headed for a shutdown "productive"?

@TomPerez DNC may lay out certain issues for certain debates to address but says it would not exert any editorial control over the news organizations that host them. (Climate change, for one, barely made it into '16 debates.)
DNC wants its debates to be substantive. "We don’t want debates to be discussions of what your hand size is," @tomperez told reporters today. "We want debates to be discussions of health care, the topics that are important to the American people."
The early debates will all be held in non-Iowa, NH, Nevada, SC states. And then those four early states will get later debates as voters are voting.
@hilaryr @MichelleObama same
Criteria to qualify for the June and July 2019 debates will be coming soon from the DNC but won't just rely on polling but will also take into account factors like grassroots fundraising. If there are 2 nights, participants will be selected at random.
The original 2016 Democratic primary calendar included just four debates, all before voting started (more were added). This time the DNC is starting with 12, half in '19, and the early ones potentially divided into two nights if field is huge (it will be).
Asked if bill to protect Mueller is needed, Rosenstein says: "The investigation is being conducted in accordance with the department regulation and nothing anybody says is going to affect that." Adds it's "being handled appropriately under the existing department regulations."

Bolton gets surly about the tape of the Khashoggi killing. "Why you think I should, what do you think I'd learn from it? ... Unless you speak Arabic, what are you going to get from it?"
Bolton calls the Putin-Trump meeting slated for later this week a "continuation of their conversation in Helsinki."
The leader meetings that are currently on the schedule for Trump: Macri, Moon, Erdogan, Abe, Modi, Putin, Xi. Meet with MBS? "No," schedule is already full, National Security Adviser John Bolton says.

Hillary Clinton on threats: "We are fine thanks to the men and women of the Secret Service who intercepted the package addressed to us long before it made its way to our home. Every day we are grateful for their service and commitment and obviously never more than today."

@katherinemiller "if she were to run"
So apparently people ask Barack Obama for Michelle to run for president. "Michelle, she's not runnin' for president but she is out there telling you to vote," he says.
"Nevada, you could be the first state ever to elect a state legislature where the majority are women, which I'm pretty sure things will work better if you give women a chance to run things for a while," Obama says in Vegas.
Obama is team I-alone-could've-fixed-it-if-I-were-the-only-guy: "This is not just about one person in the WH. This is about Congress &amp;govs races&amp;state leg races because power in America isn't just in one person. If all it took was being pres, shoot, I would've solved everything."
Obama on GOP claims they're protecting people with preexisting conditions:  "I can tell you that they have no way of protecting preexisting conditions with anything they've proposed. They're just saying it. They're making it up"
Obama: "Unlike some I actually try to state facts. I believe in facts. I believe in a fact based reality and a fact based politics. I don't believe in just making stuff up."
"...you and your vote" https://t.co/k8uQz9o6ke
Obama: "We have a chance to restore some sanity in our politics. Right now we can tip the balance of power back to you, the American people. Because ultimately there's only one real check on abuses of power, there's only one real check on bad policy and that is you."
"Republicans in power want you to feel cynical. They want you not to vote," Obama says in Vegas. "They appeal to tribe, they appeal to fear."
Back and forth between Obama and Trump on the economy continues: "When you hear all this talk about economic miracles ... remember who started it"
@maxabelson did someone watch health track today?
Obama in Vegas: "You can get anything you want right here in Vegas. Some things you shouldn't want" but also a lot that's good for you like food and shows."

Trump says Kavanaugh "is at a level that we rarely see, not only in government, but anywhere in life. Honestly, I feel terribly for him, his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and his beautiful young daughters."
"Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case," Trump says. And then the Senate will vote, looking at what both had to say "from 36 years ago."
"I feel so badly for him that he's going through this," Trump says of Kavanaugh. "It should have been brought up long ago." Says Feinstein should've brought up her concerns in her one-on-one with Kavanaugh.
Why not have the FBI look into Kavanaugh accusations? "It wouldn't bother me" other than that the FBI says it isn't something they do, Trump says

All Cohn has said is this in a written statement: "This book does not accurately portray my experience at the White House. I am proud of my service in the Trump Administration, and I continue to support the President and his economic agenda."
At Reuters event, Gary Cohn gets a question that ties up trade with the Woodward book story on him taking the KORUS withdrawal letter off Trump's desk. So Cohn answers nothing. "I've said what I'm going to say on the Woodward book. I really have."
Asked if bankers should have gone to jail, Gary Cohn says: "What laws were broken? What laws were broken? ... I thought the U.S. criminal system worked that you had to break a law ... Tell me what laws were broken."

“Better is good. That’s the history of progress in this country,” Obama says. “Do not let people tell you the fight’s not worth it because you might not get everything you want.”

Obama: “How hard should that be? Saying that Nazis are bad.”
Regardless of party, Americans should fight to restore “honesty and decency and lawfulness in our government,” Obama says. “It not be a partisan issue” to say that we do not use the AG or FBI to “cudgel” political opponents.
There are “Republicans who know better” in Congress, Obama says, but they “are still bending over backwards to shield this behavior” and are “utterly unwilling to find the backbone to safeguard the institutions that make our democracy work.”
Obama: “None of this is conservative. I don't mean to pretend I'm channelling Lincoln now, but that's not what he had in mind, I don't think, when he formed the Republican Party. It sure isn't normal. It's radical.”

Trump says he didn't hear Ron DeSantis's "monkey this up" comment on Fox, then went on to call DeSantis "extraordinary," "brilliant" and "an extreme talent."
Trump asked for his current social media follower total and then bemoaned when platforms kick off bots: "I can tell you when things are different all of a sudden you lose people. And you say where do they go? They've taken off."
Trump on claims that Google, Facebook and Twitter target conservatives: "I think it's a serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right, it's not fair, it may not be legal."

Curious thing Sen. Graham said on the Today Show a little while ago. Asked if Trump's only beef with Sessions is the Mueller investigation, Graham says "it's much deeper than that." Pressed, all he says is, "well, we won't say on this show but it's a pretty deep breach."

A week ago, the government reported it had 572 kids in the custody of HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement. That appears to be just 13 reunified in the past week, but the admin's filings have shifted characterizations a bit so possible that's not quite right. https://t.co/NBGOW3v9Xl
Trump admin says it still has 559 separated kids from the Ms. L class in HHS custody, including 386 whose parents are outside the U.S. Officials have contact info for 360 of those kids' parents and have been in contact with parents of 299 of them in past week.
Trump admin says in a new court filing that 572 children are in ORR custody because their parent is "not originally eligible for reunification or not available for discharge at this time." That includes 410 whose parents are outside the U.S., down from 431 a week ago.

Trudeau's response to Trump's call for Russia to rejoin the G-7: "I said very simply that it is not something we are even remotely interested in looking at at this time, to have Russia return to the G-7."
And Trump says he won't accept a deal without a sunset clause. https://t.co/eSFykie7jC

@OKnox from the OSC FAQ page: "referring to their official titles or positions while engaged in political activity at any time" https://t.co/tUssTlfzU5 @swin24
Trump campaign statement confirming @parscale role includes a quote attributed to "Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President." That seems, um, not kosher.
@justinsink @catherine_lucey @AnnieLeHardy45 @robertarampton congrats to @robertarampton !!
.@oknox still waiting for the Schock announcement
Trump filed for re-election on Inauguration Day, see his letter to the FEC here: https://t.co/F5CpeLAWWt. The only news is that @parscale will be campaign manager. https://t.co/fXwwkVndt8
White House says the administration's agreement to buy two new planes from Boeing to serve as Air Force One will cost about $3.9 billion, less than the $5+ billion the project was initially estimated to cost.
@OKnox deleted my wrong guess because I'm embarrassed by it

@mikehtrujillo @lyft The White House basement, so no.
@mikehtrujillo @lyft Fortunately only one more left after that and we hit it when the light was green. And I just got to my destination!
Not to mention it’s a light with a specific left turn signal and a bike lane.
@lyft And if you think it’s that one can turn left onto a one way street from a one way street, I can tell you that is against the law in the District of Columbia, which is where he’s driving and where his plates are from.
.@lyft driver is telling me about how it’s OK to turn left on red ... Says he read about it.
@clairehoworth @radhikajones @VanityFair Amazing! Congratulations!
(NRA put out a statement last Tuesday night reiterating it opposed raising the age)
Trump has spoken extensively on guns a few times since Thursday but hasn’t brought up raising the minimum age of gun sales in any of those appearances, including hour-plus CPAC speech and hour-plus meeting with governors. https://t.co/DH2gH3ovqD

Is there any kind of campaign by teachers in favor of carrying guns in schools?
FLOTUS says adults should be "encouraging positive habits on social media and technology." And, for their kids, "Even limiting time online and understanding the content they are exposed to on a daily basis."
