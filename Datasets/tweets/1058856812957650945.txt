In a sense this is what we'd expect if Trump was more unpopular than Dems are popular.  Unsure this says anything about Harris v Biden though other than Biden having better name recognition &amp; being preferable to Trump to those polled
Interesting result not quoted: if explicitly asked about Dem v Trump v Schultz, Biden wins by 9% 51-42-7, Harris loses though 45-43-12.  Unsure why they didn't poll other candidates, and ofc this is somewhat prejudicial bc Schultz is unlikely to get that much attention https://t.co/BuRnOzAtMy
