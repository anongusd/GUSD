Rep. Meadows is visibly upset, as if Michael Cohen's testimony &amp; incriminating evidence implicating #45, is a personal attack against him. Mr. Chairman, I think he (Meadows) needs a time out. #CohenHearing
Why are (R) Committee members and the ranking member Jordan attacking MC?? The fact that this hearing has solely to do with 45, is unlike anything we've heard or seen in the history of all presidents. Donald Trump is a certified CROOK! #MichaelCohen
@RealCandaceO @MichaelCohen212 I'm sure Trump had a difficult time discharging you. You wanted to remain lodged - for you're a hard, knotted one. OREO! @RealCandaceO
Obviously, Rep. Green &amp; Rep. Jordan mutually agreed beforehand to double-team Michael Cohen. Party before country. #MichaelCohen
Then you rate him a 5, out of spite. Girl, boo! #MarriedAtFirstSight
No, Jasmine... you ruined it! The mood was right, he had that "I like her" look in his eyes. And you asked him that question. Why?!🤦‍♀️#MarriedAtFirstSight
I will lift my eyes to the healer of the hurt I hold inside.🙏
I mean, his interview -with @GMA news anchor, Robin Roberts- was so heartfelt. Like, for me, that's when I genuinely believed him. Now I'm completely dumbfounded.😮
He hoodwinked us all. Not cool, Jussie. Not cool at all. Smh😢 #JussieSmollett
@ABC I keep asking myself, why?
@CaryBfield Amen.
Jussie, if you're reading this... just tell us the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God! Please.🙏
Well, I think you're way late on that Luke. (On hurting Kate's feelings) #MarriedAtFirstSight
Poor Kate... she can't catch a break with this guy. #MarriedAtFirstSight
Luke is by far the worst spouse thus far of #MarriedAtFirstSight
Everyone is now condemning Jussie Smollett. We all should wisely refrain from commenting as details of what transpired are still being investigated. May the truth be found.
But, I'm totally here for it. TELL ALL!
Former FBI Acting Director, Andrew McCabe has a new "tell-all" book. Hmmm,🤔I should've known... with his timely interview on 60 minutes.

Ray Charles had a total of 12 children by 10 different women. Abhorrent.😞
My eldest couldn't make it to the restroom; therefore, he vomited on the floor. I make this admission shamefully,🙈 it remained there for three and a half hours because I wasn't able to clean it without gagging to the extent of vomiting myself.🙊 #MomChronicles
I pray this virus that's spreading rampant in my neighborhood, run its course and be gone!
A mother's worry: when our babies are sick, and their usually smiling faces are tears stained and sound asleep.😢💔
There are more serious issues worthy of media attention, such as the crisis at the border where an unknown number of children are still CAGED, separated from their parents. Be outraged about that! Republicans are hypocritical.
I my opinion, we have become too sensitive. This application was submitted 25+ years ago. If Sen. Warren's true ethnicity is "American Indian", then what's the uproar!? People can evolve. Give them time.
Wow. Roger Stone's official indictment court filings has a total of 24 pages. I just began reading it. Looks like the next hour for me is "booked". Hahahaha... get it?? 🤣
Thanks to reading "Becoming Michelle Obama"; I just learned to say something or someone is going "haywild" is incorrect. The correct word is "haywire." 🤦‍♀️as Homer Simpson would say... "Dup!"

@KailLowry If you were that would be fine. Their children are there responsibility. I was just saying, secure the bag. Sorry about the "t" in your name. Stupid auto correct.
@KailLowry She wanted you to acknowledge her so bad. It was obvious, like, she started complimenting Lux's curls.😄
Javi comes across as having low self-esteem. He just has to be in a relationship to feel validated. Hope this girl make him feel important. #TeenMom2
So, Kaitlyn is collecting child support payments from 3 guys, plus, a check from MTV. Secure the bag.. I guess. #TeenMom2

It's baffling to me to witness how many people have joined the #MuteRKelly bandwagon. I'm not saying the allegations against him are true or false... I'm just wondering when did Congress abolish the "innocent until proven guilty" mantra.🤔🙄

I be so angry, but more sad when I hear African Americans say, "I'm not voting; ain't nothing gon change." Thousands of African Americans are still enslaved (mentally) by choice. Thank God for liberty!
Morning folks! So disappointing to wake up and learn that Mike Espy didn't win... this time. But rest assure we are not giving up hope. In four years, the bottom rail will come to the top!

@jametriss_fran 😯🤷‍♀️ weird, I know.
Polls (in Mississippi, to be exact) are open from 7am - 7pm. YOUR VOICE. YOUR VOTE.
To all my peeps in Mississippi, go VOTE today! The run-off between Democrat Mike Espy &amp; Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith is today. Let your voice(s) be heard! Vote for Mike Espy! 		Oh, did I say, "Good Morning"..🙄

Tamar's behavior is that of a girl in middle school. Appalling. How old is she?? I'm embarrassed for her sisters. #BraxtonFamilyValues
But she is suppose to be a voice for the Conservatives. So, in one breath she condemns his actions and words, yet in another she quickly justify and point fingers at the Democrats. Complicity. #TheView
Pt.1 Abby Huntsman is in a pickle. She knows her president's behavior is unbecoming of a President and that his language towards women is disrespectful and inexcusable. #TheView

Senator Flake, I applaud your bravery to stand against your party-mates and call for a delay in the #KavanaughHearings . You are doing the right thing! @JeffFlake

He has shown no transparency. He is arrogant and unashamedly rude!  His words are self-serving and it is obvious he doesn't respect women! #KavanaughHearings
At the opening of Judge Kavanaugh's hearing, I was sympathetic towards him due to the scrutiny he has endured since the allegations became public. However, upon witnessing his horrible behavior under oath, I am taken aback. #KavanaughHearings
He is becoming unhinged. #KavanaughHearings
Why is he yelling at Senator Feinstein? Be respectful. Is that how he talk to a lady??🤔🤔 #KavanaughHearings
In retrospect, I'd be equally angry if it were me or one of my loved ones being accused of the unthinkable. Fair is fair. #KavanaughHearings
Donald Trump is somewhere grinning. Saying, that-a-boy; show'em Kavanaugh! #KavanaughHearings
He's so upset! If you're innocent, why all the hostility??? #KavanaughHearings

Mia isn't all in. She seems withdrawn. I would like for her to be completely honest with Tristan. Is it the ex factor?? #MarriedAtFirstSight
I feel like, Tristan &amp; Mia just keep missing each other. He canceled his insurance, with intentions of becoming ONE. Mia's response should've been, "awe, babe"... how thoughtful. She's picking fights. I think she wants out. #MarriedAtFirstSight

Just answered a phone call and upon hearing the company's name, I immediately assumed the reason for the call. Turns out, my reasoning was wrong. Moral of the story - DON'T ASSUME, JUST ASK.
We can wisely and respectfully advised the next, but don't be condescending.
Who gets to say how we deal with personal struggles, and life setbacks?? We do not have a say. And we should all respect each other's rights as individual beings.
As humans, who are we to dictate how long another person(s) should grieve? Or, how one is to cope with pain and tragedy.
God doesn't teach in human manner. He teach in precepts and examples.😐

That lady is clearly entertaining his interest in her. She baited Harvey Weinstein. C'mon, you can't do that. It's not right. MONEY!
I'm cool with her spilling the tea. But it makes me wonder, if her position wasn't terminated. Would she still be his cheerleader?! Idk....
I find it extremely difficult to feel bad for Omarosa. Who can trust her now? She is sellout.

In that scene, the Holy Ghost showed me how the devil maneuvers. He attacks me where he knows I'm weak. I have to purpose in my heart to be as relentless as Dre, and continue fighting. My fight is spiritual. His was scripted. But, oh the message in it.🙏
Dre's opponent(s) knew his leg was weak and previously injured. So they hit him there continuously, hoping he would surrender. He didn't. He was relentless.

Thank God for confirmation. Jeremiah 10:23  O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
Lord, as you told Moses; "open your mouth and I'll speak for you" ... I'm asking you to speak for me, through me. Idk the words to say.😟
A huuuge Congratulations to Kaitlyn Walker (Katie) on the completion of her GED! She did it! I'm so happy for her. A toast to Kaitlyn🥂... Go get them degrees, baby! I'm rooting for ya, all the way. 😗cheek 2 cheek😗
@raeforshort__ 🤣🤣 what did it say??
Wishing my sisters, Raven and Vanessa a Happy Birthday! No, they're not twins. Love you girlies very much.😗😗
@KonstanceWalke2 What Sis. Sanders say, huunn...
The only thing the devil can feed you, is lies. That is all he has to give, it's who he is. A lie!
@KailLowry 🤣 Donald Trump. When the media think they've caught him in a lie.
Had some sleepless nights, but you brought me. Brought me from a looooong way off. And, O give thanks unto the Lord for he is [so] good, and his mercy endureth forever!
Lost my family along the way, and my husband, too, but Lord, you brought me from a long ways off.😢🙌 Hallelujah!
Lost some friends along the way, but you brought me.
Lord, I thank you for my journey. You brought me from a long way off. I had to cry sometime, but you brought me.
@BabsEvansMTV He's trying to get back at Kail. Smh. He is an ok guy, who is a sucka for love. But, he needs to slow down &amp; let love evolve. Congrats on the pregnancy though!
Put on therefore the whole armour of God, that ye [I] may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Thank God for Jesus, and the Holy Ghost. I rebuked that spirit that captured me. Rebuked myself for submitting to it. And prayed to God for strength and endurance to battle on.
I honestly had to check myself this morning. My thoughts were all over the place. My energy was negative. All due to being tired &amp; sleepy. My ugly truth.
Being tired and sleep deprived is a sickness. One, or the two will have you being mean just because.
RT @RandallTime: If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I’ll buy everyone who retweet’s this a jersey...
I bet Fox will pick the show up.
RT @AprilDRyan: @therealroseanne girl bye. No more of your foolish and racist talk
What Roseanne tweeted about Valerie Jarrett was abhorrent &amp; distasteful. Wasn't funny in any way. Respect one another as humans, created equal by God.
We have been in a moral freefall since "the new guy" brought down the value of The White House by becoming #45. We must get back to what our democracy represents and uphold the Constitution. Liberty and justice for ALL!
As Americans we must know that any/all racist remarks, whether intended for laughter or no, is unacceptable in our country. Kudos to ABC network for doing the right thing, despite losing millions of dollars in revenue!👏
It's just not working for you boo.😞
I don't want to offend the individual, but I be wanting to say, STOP! Leave the jokes to lil man (Kevin Hart).
It irks my nerves that there's this one person always trying to be funny, but is not funny whatsoever. 🙎‍♀️
When you find the perfect pair of shoes to go with your outfit; they're so perfect you don't want to wear them and mess'em up. My life right now.
Guess who will not be watching the NBA finals??? Me. She. Her.
Let's go Houston! I despise the Warriors. Make'em clean out their lockers. 🏀
Tears filled eyes as I watch the #RoyalWedding Live! So happy for Meagan Markle.💖👰🤴
Meagan &amp; Prince Harry, I wish you two a loving and forgiving based marriage. May y'all always love each other. Communicate. Hold hands, look each other in the eyes, cry together, and forgive as often as needed. #RoyalWedding
And, Monique is suddenly dumb and can't talk. Yet, she's drinking like fish that has been out of water for weeks. Smh #RHOP
Monique is an instigator! Candice ONLY attacked Chariss (and Giselle) because her boss (Monique) gave her strict orders to! Chile, be yourself! #RHOP
Well, that's a wrap! Pelicans are O U T - out! So happy right now. I don't have to travel to NO on Thursday. Now, let's go Houston! Beat GS.
I wannabe around people that bring out the "wings" in me, not those who bring out the "worm" in me. -Bishop T.D. Jakes 	Wow! What a word.
So glad the @PelicansNBA lost! And no, I'm not a Warriors fan, just dislike the Pels a little more than the Warriors. 3-1 #4everlakersgirl
At this stage in my life I'm about growth &amp; positivity, and anything or anyone that disrupts that or costs me my peace of mind is too expensive. No investment.

Watching Married at First Sight reunion. Ryan knows what to say and when to say it. The hard part for him is actually living up to what he says. Smooth talker. #MarriedAtFirstSight
@raeforshort__ Things will get better baby sis. Don't lose faith in God. He hears you. Just keep praying, sincerely. I love you for always.😘
Don't treat people bad as they treat you; or, as wicked as they are in spirit. Treat them as good as you are and with all the love you'd like to receive. God is love.💖
I am me, and you are you. We're not going to agree on everything. And sure, we don't share the same beliefs, don't like the same foods, music, fashions, etc., that my friend is, diversity! Individuality. However, WE ALL BLEED THE SAME!
A huge birthday shout out to Alicia Crawford. Happy Birthday girlie! Count it all joy.
The joy of the Lord is my strength. I get joy when I think about God.
"Momma there goes that man!" Grown man move! Broooon! 3-2 #NBAPlayoffs
Aww! My heart goes out to Shauneice. She really loves Jepeth. Like, totally in love with him. I understand her reservations about not knowing if he feels the same. I cry for her.😢😢 #MarriedAtFirstSight
Watching Married at First Sight season finale. I love this show! It causes me to examine myself &amp; confront my ugliness. #MarriedAtFirstSight
Sometimes God has to allow horrible things to happen to awaken us spiritually. We be sleep walking and headed off the cliff.
Sometimes the view from where I stand, is picture perfect. Other times, things look dim and gray clouds loom. But, oh, to be kept by JESUS! How sweet it is!
Each day brings a different view.
It's easy to be common. The pressure comes when you try to be uncommon.
Jesus, your grace was greater than my sins. Thankful.
If you wanna know who ya REAL friends are, fall back.
What in the Stormy Daniels, Hurricane Tristan Thompson is going on?? The Pelicans are going to advance to the second round.
Just watched a clip of the Pelicans vs. the Trailblazers game last night. And boy, am I shook!😨 New Orleans lead the series 2-0, heading home tomorrow night.
Aww, man! I missed George Stephanopoulos interview with James Comey last night. I so intended to watch it. Oh, well... thank goodness there's YouTube!
If speaking nicely to plants helps them grow; imagine what speaking nicely to humans can do. Be kind.
Lord, I come to the altar, hands raised in total submission to you. I'm requesting a fresh anointing, &amp; a double portion of your spirit. I thirst for a drink from the well. The well that NEVER runs dry. Amen.🙇‍♀️
If I never see my name in lights, on the Hollywood walk of fame, still.. I'm "Happy with Jesus" alone.
Good morning Twitterverse! Today is April 13th..... my mom's birthday! Happy Birthday mommy! Enjoy your b'day vacation. I love you for all times. 😗😗
@balleralert She burnt the wrong person. Lol🤣	The girl said, "the baby is beautiful" and wisdomtucker, "you're not".
Woman 2 woman, my heart goes out to Khloe'. And as for you trolls mocking her, shame on you. Misery loves company!
Another friend of mine attacked &amp; defeated by the ugly monster. You'll be missed buddy. Alfred Isaac gone too soon.😢
Cancer sucks!😠It's a bad, bad thing! Why does it even exist??
@G_TheShooter No. He's my baby!
I know I can't but that doesn't stop me from trying to. I LOVE my babies to my core and every fiber of my being! I can't number the strands of hair on my head, neither can the depths of my love be measured. Time, slow down. #itsamomthing
😭😭I'm so tore up this morning. My babies are growing up. I know that's life, but I want my toddler(s) back. They're learning to fly, and will soon desire to leave the nest. I hover over them and want to protect them 4rm every bad thing and person.
Happy Birthday to my last born. Where does God put time?🤔 Hard to believe 8 years have gone😢 by. I wish you still wanted to sit in my lap. I try to hold you sometimes -your response, "ion want to, I'm a big boy".😢 You'll always be mommy's baby!👩‍👦‍👦
Rise &amp; shine, give God the glory!
Give love to those who are mean, they need it most.💖
So, "Girl Chat" on The Real today, they were discussing women bashing women - namely, on physical appearance. It truly is a sickness, that stems from insecurities within the BASHER(S)! B/c love 4rm within radiates outside, and is translated in conversation.💖
If you can be anything in life, be nice!
I have to always be in tune with the inner man, that I may hear THE voice. (incline mine ear unto you, O' God)
Be still &amp; quiet long enough to hear the Holy Ghost.
@GovMikeHuckabee Very inappropriate, Governor!
Stop nurturing your fears. Kick defeat out the door.
That doesn't make me better than the next. But if I'm trying to overcome my nicotine addiction, I shouldn't go bike riding with a smoker. #StayWoke
Two cups of weak coffee, begats one large cup of weak coffee. Same results.

Just another day that the Lord hath kept me.🙇‍♀️ Grateful.

Watching Married to Medicine reunion pt.3. I love the bond the ladies have. They may bicker and throw shade throughout the season. But right now, they are displaying true love &amp; support for one another. Real life is bigger than the cameras &amp; BS. #MarriedtoMed
I am starving. I want to go out to eat.
Oh, the stress that comes from worrying about the uncertainty..😳
Lord let me be spiritual. Keep my mind stayed on YOU. I beseech you.
@CNN Smh... a disgrace.
Lord when you show me myself, don't let me be in denial &amp; defensive. But rather, if it's good, give you the glory and if it's not something I'm proud of, admit it and strive to do better.🙇‍♀️
Watch👀closely &amp; listen👂👂carefully.
There are so many teachable moments in a day. Pay attention. #StayWoke
I get it.... it was all for the cameras. Bow Wow needed a storyline this season. I mean, what else did he have going on?? I'll wait... #GUHHATL

You have a choice, to build up or tear down; to save a life or take a life. Speak what you would want spoken unto you.
Choose your words carefully, for when they're spoken they are planted and can't be uprooted.
People believe and do everything "THEY" said, maybe preachers should refer to God &amp; the old Bible patriots as "THEY". Maybe then, people will believe, obey God's word &amp; live by the Bible.😮

Sooo, I'm sitting here catching up on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. And my heart breaks of Porsha. She acknowledged her wrongness &amp; has apologized to Kandi several times. I feel so bad for her! #RHOA
It feels like I'm going in circles. 😮Sigh😯

To sum it all up, his new tax plan SUCK! Millions will get a raise and millions will be out of a job also. Crappy. That tax plan was created to lower taxes for people of his (DT) caliber. Those getting a raise...that's more taxes coming out of their checks.
So, Wal-mart employees will see an increase in their wages. Effective when? Idk. Meanwhile, 63 Sam's Club stores across the state will be closing. Effective when? Idk either. All due to the "vagina grabber's" new tax plan.
My heart goes out to Tonya Harding. I don't know, I just feel like, to a degree, she was victimized too.
I know first hand how it feels to be ridiculed. Everyone watching you like a game of checkers, and you're just trying to stay in game. So, I dare not subject anyone to that pain &amp; loneliness. I only want to pray for ya &amp; be there for ya in any helpful way that I can.
People are so quick to mock &amp; judge when you stumble and make bad decisions. You become the butt of their jokes and the topic of gossip. Imagine, if they(sincerely)prayed for you, as often as they talked about you!?

@TranquilityHapp @PBandJenelley_1 I thought the same thing when I read her tweet.
Oh, how I miss my time with her. The long conversations we used to share with each other. Up for hours schooling me on men, and how to discern the MEN from the boys. She told me, money isn't love. Time is. Lisa, you were right! Thank u. I love u. I miss u. 😢❤
Happy Birthday to the late Lisa Hinton! On this day I reminisce about how life was growing up with her. (As a teenager) I always admired her. Insomuch, that I secretly wanted 2 B her. I often said 2 her, "you are so pretty"! Her response, "so r u"☺....
Good morning everyone! It's frigid Friday. Brrrrrr...
When you strut, you stumble. Be humble.

In the dream, I had an altercation with a chubby girl, and beat her up pretty bad. I also, attacked a 9 year old boy and left his face bruised. I awoke like, wth!? What was that about!?😦😞
I hate when I have dreams of me behaving horribly. Last night's nightmare had me shook-eth😖to the core this morning. Boy, was I relieved😥when woke up to find that it was just a dream!
God of mercy, sweet love of mine I have surrendered to your desire.
As my pastor would say, "Short term sacrifice, for long term gain". Stay in the race!
Watching Diary of a Mad Black Woman.
White people always trying to break (world) records and attempt death defying stunts.😞
Just saw a video of a Caucasian man playing with a lioness. Idiotic thing to do. Smh
Just watched "Single Moms Club". I really enjoyed it. I'd watch it over &amp; over. A real eye-opener.
Have a holly jolly Christmas! I wanted to post a video of me singing that, but unfortunately for you my followers, idk the whole song. So, too bad. #MerryChristmas
Thankful for another day that the Lord has kept me! Didn't have to do it, yet, He did.
Are there NFL games on tonight?
We as humans are so unreliable. But GOD is faithful. He is consistent. He is never changing. His word won't return void. I stand on His word and promises.
Am I the only to experience that??
How come the tweets I tweet from my desktop doesn't show on the Twitter app on my phone?! That's so weird.
Psalm 116 	(6) The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.	(7) Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.	(8) For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
Your love towers over me "Gracious Tempest" in the sea, surround me like a storm, let your tide of mercy rain, let it flood my heart again, surround me like an ocean; your love is crashing over me, it's surging like a raging sea; immerse me in the wonder of love
Happy Birthday to the late Sister Barbara Ann Gully-Davis! You are tremendously missed. You were loved dearly. Your giving heart &amp; spirit is unmatched. 😇💖 You gained your heavenly wings 2 years ago.
Most males think that being a man requires them to be iced and boxed in.😞 If that's you, move along. Ain't nobody got time for that!
It warms me inside, to see men be emotional and in touch with their sensitive side. It's so attractive, and a huge quality (of mine).
Just saw a video of Magic Johnson &amp; Isaiah Thomas, both literally in tears as they deaden their issues, and embrace one another. It made my heart smile and cry. What a beautiful moment to see BLACK men apologize &amp; love each other! 💙💙
I have a strong hunger for knowledge. Knowledge is power! I want to be very well educated.

I can't stand Maci's self-righteous, condescending attitude. Everyone is wrong, and she's right. Jen &amp; Larry has always supported her, and never took sides with Ryan when he was wrong. And for her to punish them on Ryan's actions, is unfair. #TeenMomOG

Eleven years ago today, at 11:45am, I gave birth to a 7lbs12oz boy. A first time mom, I knew not what I was doing nor the challenges I was to face in parenting. At the first sign of life in me (a kick &amp; thump), I loved you with every ounce of my being and I still do. 💙💙
My pastor always say, when God put you up, man can't bring you down. But if man put you up, when he want his ladder, you gotta come down. My advice: Wait on God. Let Him elevate you.
People (Society) forget all the good you've done, the minute you do something wrong. Terrible.
So now, Matt Lauher is a no good scound booker, good for nothing but to be ridiculed and reduced to his lowest term! #SexualHarrassment

You don't move up, putting others down. A lit candle looses nothing by lighting another candle.
I have to be real, some of the women crying wolf, ain't innocent. Y'all know when you walk into the workplace with ya skirt barely below your rump, your long, v-neck shirt, fitting perfectly over ya "D cups" exposing the beginning of the separating of your girls..

Gooooood Morning, Twitterverse! 🎤It's a beautiful morning🎵 it's a great day to be alive!
Even his 18 year old son was MAN enough and mature enough to thank the guy. That wasn't asking too much. No one is expecting him to vote for DT in 2020. Just say, "Thank you, Mr. Trump"!
Lavar Ball should've just said, "I apologize....Thank you, Mr. Trump!"  Instead, he rants about NOTHING pertaining to the anything. Embarrasses his family (which btw,😢 who is his wife) and showed millions of viewers how little and empty he is.
I applaud Chris Cuomo for remaining calm, and PROFESSIONAL while dealing with an arrogant cockalorum.
I just watched Chris Cuomo's interview with Lavar Ball. The father of LiAngelo Ball, who was arrested in China for shoplifting, and it was quite an interview, to say the least.😞
@_1Todd Sure thing bro 💙

Good morning Twitterverse! Who else is up at 2:14 to be exact? I bet y'all President is up.

@G_TheShooter You okay baby bro??
Why does the majority expect resignation of those holding public offices when "allegations" of sexual misconduct are exposed??? Whatever happened to forgiveness, after apology?! Society wants public humiliation and to be ousted. #WeinsteinEffect

Lord order my steps in your word, not my will but thine will be done.
@chardy_notsorry I couldn't agree more.
It's so obvious Javi is hurting. God, I hurt with him. Watching this episode breaks my heart, it's too painful. #TeenMom2
Kailyn is going to regret hurting &amp; divorcing Javi. You don't miss a good man, until he's loving someone else. #TeenMom2
Poor Barb. Jenelle is going to reap those same tears Barb is shedding. Jace, Kaiser &amp; Ensley won't be babies forever. #TeenMom2
Awe! I feel so bad for Javi. He look like he wants to sob. Poor guy, he really loved Kail. #TeenMom2 @Javimarroquin9

Lord teach us how to get along and love one another.

Meghan is so wrong for how she belittles DeAndre. #MarriageBootCampRealityStars
However, those who are REAL will respect my voice and view, and therefore, they will respect me. Unleash the GIANT in YOU.
Speak up! Everyone isn't going to like what I have to say. My voice matters. I don't feel entitled to, at all.
..they can/will easily misinterpret what I said, or my intent behind what was said. People don't LOOK beyond the picture on the wall.
I shy away from saying what NEEDS to be said. Sometimes bc of not wanting to offend anyone, or (shamefully) bc of what others will think..
Sometimes I deny my own voice. And, by that I mean, not speaking up in the most crucial moments.
Me: "disrespect!?" 😂😂 	My boy amazes me with the things he say..smh
So, at home, I killed a baby cricket and my 7yr old said, Mama, "that's disrespect!" His face was like, 😰
Just another day that the Lord hath kept me. Grateful.🙌
Hey, Wendy! "How you doing"????
I love JLo and Arod together. They are such a cute &amp; sexy couple. I hope their relationship lasts.
So, Wendy Williams got too hot in her Halloween costume, and fainted (on live TV). Man! How come i always miss the exciting things?? :-0

Lord help me to always, always have a grateful heart, and give thanks for all things...both small &amp; great, new &amp; used!
The very second GOD BLESS with new things, suddenly, we're so picky, with a book of preferences.

OMG! Vee is being so judgmental. I'd hate to think that it's insecurity on her part; because Jo is always so supportive of Kail. #TeenMom2
If you ask a AA person, where are they going, they'll tell you where they been - their parents names, and so on &amp; so forth. Smh..

I love the quotes the producers share on #BeingMaryJane . I wish there was a #BMJ quotes page. @beingmaryjane
Sean Spicer said, "Let me get off this ship b4 it sink and I drown too". Smartest thing he has said in almost 6 months. Lol #SeanSpicer
It is further embedded in me, daily, that age does NOT equal maturity.
Don't allow the enemy to silence you. If you're not with the solution, you're apart of the problem. ✌
New season of #TeenMom2 starts tonight. Yayyyy! So excited to see Brianna &amp; Nova. @_BrianaDejesus

Catch this; some of your teammates ain't your teammates.😉😉 Wise up!
Why does the nerve in my head keep jumping? Should I be worried?
Who would've thought he would go the lengths he has gone to feed his ego!? Pride is a disease. And, the results can be deadly.

What kind of website is "Black Planet"? I've never heard of it, until this morning.
I pray to my Heavenly Father that he shield and encamp his angels around my parents as they take their flight to California today. 🙏
I said all of that, to say this, what does Daffy Duck (Trump) has to do before Congress has him impeached!? Commit murder. What gives?
Bc u know in order to collect unemployment, you can't quit. But, when management won't fire you, despite ALL your crazy antics. What then?
And somehow, you get the job. So, u start acting out, embarrassing the entire organization n hopes of getting fired (2 collect unemployment)
When you apply for THE job and you know personally you don't qualify, you're not fit for the job and you have zero experience in that field
@balleralert Evelyn. I wanted her to cream Jackie! She is messy Jessie! #TeamEvelyn
Jackie is ALL talk! Same thing every season. Mouth &amp; threats. Mouth &amp; threats.#BBW

Jackie Christie deserves WHATEVER type of beatdown Evelyn gives her! #BBW

It is high time to execute judgment. Impeach Donald Trump and his ENTIRE staff!!! He's got to "GET OUT"! #RussiaGate
How long do we just TALK about the fact that Russia is to blame for the outcome of OUR election? It has been topic of discussion 4 5 months!
Jackie is messy as can be and loves to play the victim. Girl, bye! #BasketballWives
Watching #BasketballWives this show exudes mess and junk. I really can't with these ladies! Especially, Jackie Christie.
It always always comes back to YOU.
It pays to heed to instructions; and it pays when you fail to heed to instructions. Choose wisely.
This was a calculated, well orchestrated ambush on Congressionals &amp; Representatives. #shootinginvirginia
Another shooting (in Alexandria, VA). Jesus help us! 😢
The heart want what the heart wants. And love who it loves. No sense in fighting it.
It's an unprecedented PLOT to destroy Bill Cosby himself, and his legacy. In the words of Justice C. Thomas, "It is a high tech lynching"!
Watching @GMA give updates about the Cosby case. The whole scandal is sickening! It literally makes me sick to my stomach! #CosbyTrial
So thankful for the "prev" button on my remote right now. Watching two shows in between commercials. #MAFS #GUHHATL
Just ate pinto beans/sausage &amp; rice. I pray I don't be up all night with indigestion. Somebody pray for me, please.

Remember, people want to do better but NOT better than them! It's limits to their support.
How do I learn? Try. Make mistakes. Apologize often. Watch closely. Listen carefully. Speak less. Repeat as often as needed.
There is a lesson in every situation faced. And, I am always up to learn.
On the flip side, happy to see my babies. I missed them terribly!
What a busy weekend, glad it's over! I am exhausted!
Working the SEC tournament (every year) is tiresome! Early mornings &amp; longggggg nights. Ugh!

I still feel some type of way about Aaron Hernandez's death. 😔 What a travesty! The murder. The suicide. Everything. Smh
Time is THE MOST essential thing. The only thing you can't get back; so spend it wisely.
But, I wouldn't know what I know now had I not GREW  through what I went through. So, it ALL worked out for my good. Look at GOD!
Wish I knew then what I know now....
We get so caught up into who's right and who's wrong, that we lose sight of LOVE &amp; FORGIVENESS.
In all honesty, I think both of us would like a redo.

Never knew my maternal grandmother, she passed when my mom was a teenager. I cannot phathom the pain &amp; loneliness my mom must've felt. 😢
I love my mother very much, and I am grateful she is still here with me.
Disrespectful and ungrateful! Her life was jacked up &amp; her mom took on HER responsibility, and raised Jace.  But she's the enemy! #teenmom2
Barbara has nurtured and cared for Jace for 7 years, and that's the thank you she gets from Jenelle!? #teenmom2
Oh great, now a pity party! Grow up, Jenelle! #teenmom2
Nathan was right, Jenelle is always playing the role of the victim. #teenmom2
People do things just to be seen or heard. Trying to low key inflict more pain. But there's a GOD who knows it all...

Is Barbara really that short, or was Nessa standing on something!? How tall is she [Barbara]? @MTV
Hailee Steinfield looked stunning last night! Just gorgeous, like a real American Princess! #Oscars

But, in all honesty, I be totally amused. Lol
Some of the things on my Twitter feed should be prohibited. I'm just saying....
I looooove Google! It's like, my live in Professor!
Ughhh! I have indigestion! I think I ate too fast.
Jesus said, "that you do to the least of them, you've done it also unto me"...and that is in RED WRITING, saints!

They're suddenly so polite and kindhearted FOR HIM. It saddens me, bc most have been under his teaching since, like, b4 I was birthed....
I laugh within myself just listening to some of the members in my church, and how angelic their tone is when our Bishop is present.

Goooood "HAPPY VALENTINES DAY" Morning! Love to you all.
@Bravotv brought Sheree back in the starring role as "POT STIRRER". Messy. Messy.
Watching #RHOA Kenya's phone screen is cracked. Did Matt kick it too???
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and over use I love you...never let your praying knees get lazy-and love like crazy
You're manipulative, and fundamentally deceptive...
We all should consider ourselves. Rejoice NOT when your brother/sister calamity come upon them like a world wind. God is a merciful God.
I shouldn't have made that statement. It's so easy to speak on a situation b4 hearing all the facts. Or, because it's not ME &amp; some1 else.
Feeling much better today! Thank the Lord! Still battling a head cold, but 80% better.
Good Morning! Grateful for another day the Lord has kept me.
Trying to enjoy a "Hearty Soup Bowl" of Cheddar Broccoli, but, it's way too salty. So disappointed!

However, watching the clips on GMA, I can see she was hilarious! Cracking me up with the old scenes.

Hearing those young boys express their hurt brings tears to my eyes! Good job, Phaedra! #RHOA
#ThankYouObamas I anxiously await your biography. You are officially in the book of Presidents (in my opinion) as "THE" greatest..ever!
You are a remarkable person, husband, father &amp; President! It has truly been a "DREAM" come true to witness greatness during your tenure!
The past 8 years went by so fast. I'm sad your term has ended. But, your legacy will forever BE! #ThankYouObamas

Not sure if I'm going to watch Donald Trump's inauguration. I'm thinking I will, to see how he conduct himself.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me!
In most disagreements, the biggest problem is misunderstanding.
I have to allow Him [GOD] to purify me. Clean me, from the inside out.
In every situation (good or bad, big or small) GOD is making me.
@realDonaldTrump I honor him for being the GREAT man that you aren't!
I didn't expect that of Kandi. She seemed so loyal. I guess, she was fed up with Phaedra being two-faced. "When they go low, we go high!"
That's y I don't confide in women. When they fall out, "IT" all falls out! I don't trust women! A LOW DOWN "DIRTY" SHAME! pt. 2
Currently watching previous episodes of RHOA. And, I think that was very low of Kandi to spill Phaedra's beans. pt. 1
It is what it is...(sigh)
Jesus said, it is expedient that I go away, (Die) for if I go not away, the Comforter (Holy Ghost) can't come! #merrychristmas

I will not allow the voices of shame &amp; regret to steal my JOY! I am alive, that alone is a "GIFT" from God. Merry Christmas!
Lord, all I want to be is IN Christ! My mind. My thoughts. The life I live, the songs I sing, I want them to be pleasing in YOUR sight.
My heart is heavy! I really wish things could be different.

Farrah's guilt is going 2 murder her, should something terrible happen 2 Debra. I pray it doesn't! Debra if you're reading this, U R LOVED!

Leah is sooooo pretty, and is always dressed so nice! Good job, Amber! #teenmomog
I like her. She's a hands on mom. She's ambitious. She has a beautiful house and doing very well for herself. Just need 2 check her attitude
According to Farrah, she's right and everyone else is wrong. What will it take to get her to SEE herself? #teenmomog
Simon is an okay guy. I think he &amp; Farrah need to work on their communication. Farrah verbally attacks whomever is around when frustrated.
It is truly difficult facing someone daily, who has pretty much, handed you your life COLD on a platter.
Clearly, my mind isn't AT work today.
(In Martin's voice)....What's up? What's up? Whhhat's uuuuup?
Wow! I can't believe it...it's shortly after 2pm and I haven't checked my Instagram account all day!
A huge Birthday shout out to my older brother. 	Happy Birthday, Ced! I love you bunches! Enjoy your off day, which happens to be your B'day.
The protests in NC are out of control! The WORLD is in dire need of JESUS. But, HE's hardly allowed anywhere. Thanks, to MAN!
My babies suffered, and continues to suffer from it.  Through it all, GOD was/IS a present help in times of trouble! My solid ROCK!
Including the very, very painful dissolution of my marriage. I have learned a GREAT lesson from it.
I was nearly in tears, as I reminisced on my life and how it was a few years ago. Sooo much has changed.
So, I pulled out my Polaroid camera this morning. And, to my surprise there were pics of my baby (who's now 6).
Good morning, Twitterverse! I have a few things to vent about....
I will take the high road (there is less traffic) and pray for them and all parties affected by this. God Bless!
However, since I have travelled that road personally. And, I know first hand that it is a very, very DARK road.
I know I said, that I would save my petty comments on Brangelina's divorce for later.
I choose to wait til all the tea is spilled. 🍵
I'll (wisely) save my petty comments on Angelina &amp; Brad's rumored divorce filings for a later date. 😝

You [Jesus] held my hand and encouraged me to stand, when they said I couldn't do it I heard You say "Yes You Can!"
They thought that I'd be weak but JESUS made me strong....they thought that I would crumble but they were so wrong
I thank God for his faithfulness. He is NEVER changing! His love is unconditional. Unlike (wo)man.

"Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy"
Will we have mercy or be vengeful???
God give us all a CHANCE to play JESUS at some point or another.

However, it's a Godly/Heavenly ACT when we WILL righteously judge ourself.

Talked about Kobe &amp; the Lakers,the Super Bowl, and Cam Newton...
Not only was he my fellow Lakers partner, he was a personal friend of mine. I saw him Sunday, we chatted a while. 2-11-2016

The Lord giveth and The Lord taketh away....Blessed be the name of The Lord!
A very, dear friend of mine passed away. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I was/am crushed. 😱😰💔
This morning I received a phone call and was informed with devastating news.
I am so here for Cam Newton. However, I feel as though he was a bit-too sure of himself. And it seemed "cocky".
I think the Panthers underestimated the Broncos (their defense).
And, if I'm correct, Cam was sacked 5x. Smh
Offense doesn't win championships, defense does!
Cam Newton is only 26. He has to learn to be humble.
Hate my Panthers lost, but Congrats to Peyton Manning &amp; the Broncos!
Watching Little Women of Atlanta. Ha! They are a "little" mess! #LittleWomenATL

“@VirgoNation: #Virgos will say they feel okay or everything is alright even when it's not.” So, me!
I know this is not my line of work but, just maybe that's how they're (convicts) staying 1 step ahead of the cops.
Like, y u gotta disclose what area u're searching and how many sq. ft it is!?
I think the authorities reveal too much about the ongoing search for the 2 escaped prisoners.
I wish I had an understanding of the stock market and how it works.
Facebook is bigger than Wal-mart....in stock value, that is.
Not trying to be funny or insensitive. But, I'm thinking Lamar need new friends. #justsaynotodrugs
Ok! So, in less than 2weeks Lamar Odom has lost 2 "friends", and the 2 deaths are drug related.
What is "Periscope"???
Somebody is Hot-headed.... #MarriedAtFirstSight
Watching #MarriedAtFirstSight and I'm totally shocked at Ryan De Nino's behavior. Deplorable!
RT @TheView: Are you OK with your kids using a tablet at a young age?	RT - Yes 	Fav - No
“@BishopJakes: Fear is like a seed in the womb of your mind, it's your choice to incubate it or reject it.” Good morning!
Like the dew in the morning, Lord, let your presence gently rest upon my heart..Good morning!
I'm not going to confront anyone about a lie. For the devil IS a lie, and the father of it! Good day folks!
My bible tells me to "let a lie, be a lie"....
I can't and I WON'T entertain mess and junk!
Thank God for my pastor (shepherd)! Who looks out for the sheep.
..."will a man rob God?"... Yes. How so? In tithes and offering. Through the church members.
These modern day pastors/preachers are ALL about self gain.
He should be ashamed of himself. Smh
Creflo Dollar is getting his 65M jet. Wow!
@lovflowerchild Congratulations lady girl! After that "life" officially begins. 😱
How long will the media talk about CJ? I've watched her as BJ for so long, that quite frankly, it's stomach turning!
Lord increase my faith in you, help me to decrease so You can increase...#dailyprayer
God will TEST you to try your faith in Him. He will not tempt you with sin.
Know that when you are tempted it's of the devil, NOT God.
Deleted my FB account yesterday.
You were born what you were born to be. God make NO mistakes!
Yes, they're both my biological sister. Born on the same day. Unusual!
Also, Happy Birthday to my sister, Vanessa! Not sure how old she is. Sorry! Too many siblings to remember them all.
Happy sweet 16th Birthday to my baby sister, Raven!  I love you tons.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
I'm still sickened by yesterday's news.
“@GovMikeHuckabee: As president, I will lead with moral clarity, defend basic human rights, and hold rogue regimes accountable.” Blah blah!
Sure, Farrah did what she did, but that doesn't make her worthless. C'mon guys, have some compassion! Who knows what dirty secrets u 2 have
I'm so annoyed by Ryan's stupidity! Smh...He's totally CLUELESS! #TeenMomOG
Maci is so self-righteous! Ugh...get over it! Such a hypocrite! Having babies out of wed-lock, yet, she's judging Farrah. #TeenMomOG
Ryan is a total "Air head"! He NEVER have anything to say or do. He just yawn and chews gum all day!
People really need to get a life!
It's really sad and messed up. Caitlyn Jenner has just joined Twitter, and there are "fake accounts" already. Smh
I am completely at a loss for words...

I cherish my salvation. It's the ultimate gift....the Holy Ghost.
As when I was much younger. I liked fast, up beat jamming music.
Like, I'm now interested in slow, meaningful worship songs. I call it "soulful music".
Since I've gotten older my taste in music has evolved.
I love The Lord, He heard my cry...
Lord, let your presence gently rest upon my heart.
Good night ladies of #TeenMomOG . You're all still growing and moving in the right direction. Cheers! #TeenMomOGSeasonFinale
Why does it have to end???? Noooooo! More, please! #TeenMomOG
Leah is the prettiest thing! #TeenMomOG
Lol @ Amber. He has a job! He pays bills! ....Has he gotten paid? Well, not yet. Lmbo #TeenMomOG
Tyler is a total gentlemen. Catelynn, you hit the jack pot honey! He's so supportive. That's what love is about. #TeenMomOG
Gary is pathetic! Poor Kristina. What he said about Amber was totally wrong. #TeenMomOG
You're gonna scare him off. Things are going great....just let it flow. No need to rush! If he's the one, time will tell. #TeenMomOG
What's the rush, Farrah? Slow down! Let him decide when he's ready to wife you. It's ONLY been 4 months (at the time of taping). #TeenMomOG
I question Amber's boyfriends intentions. And, Gary is bitter that Amber has moved on. He no longer has power over her. #TeenMomOG
Maci and Amber are moving way too fast. You shouldn't rush into marriage because you're with-child. Not judging, just advising. #TeenMomOG
She just needs to contain Sophia. No child should hit an adult!
Farrah's house is beautiful! I'm so in love with it. She's doing very good for herself. I'm highly impressed! #TeenMomOG
@Byrd_IsDa_Word hey Shayna, how are ya?
Consider the ant: Which provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
I can't let the cares of this world get me down...
Nothing else matters. For this earthly life is but for a season.
Good morning! Lord it's ALL about You.
God's grace is sufficient to me. Good morning!
Give me your eyes...
Empty me God and fill me up with your spirit.
RT @POTUS: Hello, Twitter! It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account.

Loud &amp; boisterous Tamar, sweet, angelic Tamera, funny &amp; understdng Loni, bubbly, life of the party Adrienne, and plain Jane, Jeanie! Love'em
I love the ladies from The Real! It's my #1 daytime talk show!
You are a faithful God. Can't nobody else do what You do.
“@TheQuoteBoook_: Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others.” My motto!
RT @BishopJakes: When things appear impossible and your situation grows challenging, keep your eyes on Jesus and keep moving forward!
Be thankful NOW! Or, time and circumstances will make you thankful LATER..
Simply orange, orange juice is the best! Good morning! 😉
Apparently, she has forgotten that she was casted because of Bently.
She doesn't want Bently on the show anymore due to Farrah's return.
I'm starting to really dislike Maci. She's being totally unreasonable.
I know I should've tweeted this last night during TeenMomOG, but...
My soul says yes, Lord! To your will and to your way...
If we had Your eyes, we'd see things right: His ways are not our ways. His thoughts are not our thoughts.
Happy Birthday, Alicia!
Good morning! Wake up and smile!
I'm in dyers need of a new phone.
I am stuffed.
Ok...I've had enough of Farrah's attitude and mouth already! Her parents supported her throughout everything.  #TeenMomOG
Farrah is still a rude, spoil brat! Amber (so far) is a different person. She's really trying to be nice, but Gary is playing mind games.
And she is having yet another child out of wedlock. Mind you, with a dude she dated ONLY 2 months b4 he moved to TN w/her. #TeenMomOG
I don't agree w/Farrah's decisions, but we're all human. We live and learn as we go. That is just so judgmental of her! #TeenMomOG
How dare Maci?? I mean, like, I know this is a year ago, but who does she think she is...Ms. Do Everything Right!? #TeenMomOG
This world is in an uproar. Only GOD can deliver!
Some things happened for my learning. Thank you, Jesus!
Less of me and more of You...
Fill me up GOD...
Watching the Spurs destrrrrroy the Clippers. Let's go Spurs! (Fan of neither, but there's ONLY 1 champ in L.A.) Good night world.
There should be a "Kris Jenner" interview at some point. Whenever she's ready, I'd like to hear her story. I love them. #BruceJennerABC
This interview answers a lot of questions I've had over the past few years. #BruceJennerABC
A birthday shout out to my mom...Happy happy birthday to my mother dearest!
It's thundering and lightening. Ooooo!
Mommy love you wayyyyyy more than I can convey. I annoy you with my love and endless kisses. 😘😘😘😘
Happy 5th Birthday to one of the loves of my life...my baby, Jeremiah.
The song Sister Fannie (Maw) sang at church last night is still ringing in my soul. "Lord, thank ya, Sir"!
Rainy day here.
Thank God for His grace &amp; mercy. He looked beyond my faults and saw my needs.
And what I TRY so hard to remember is... "It could/could've very well been me".
When the truth of the matter is, we're all humans. No one is fool proof! Only GOD Almighty is perfect.
As humans, it is so easy for us to quickly (negatively) judge and condemn the next person to hell for their actions .
I can't believe its been almost 5 years ago. Wow! He's growing up way too fast. 😢
My baby's birthday is in 3 days. He's so excited.
A "Good Friday" that is...
Good morning! Singing: It's Friday, it's Friday....Have a good day everyone.
Help me, Jesus.
God knows what I have need of before i do.
I do NOT look my age. And I'm small in statue. #goodgenes
Those that don't know me and see me for the first time, assume I'm a teenager.
I feel good...like sugar and spice. I feeeeel good!
All the glory belongs to You, ohhh GOD!
My daily prayer...Lord teach me YOUR ways. Open my understanding, help me to see as You see.
Stand still and see the salvation of The Lord...
My God is BIG, so strong, so mighty! My God's plans for me goes beyond my wildest dreams.
God is the giver of peace. He's the giver of ALL things good.
I have peace. Apostle Paul said, "For I have learned that whatsoever state I am in, there with to be content".
Is Ray Allen is an active ball player? I haven't seen/heard anything about him all season. Inquiring mind wants to know.
For the Bible declares that "Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen".
I don't live by what I see. I live everyday in the faith that delivered me.
I'm so glad God is not like man. For man judges the outward appearance but God judges the heart.
Good morning everyone! Thankful to be in the land of the living.
I hear the chains falling...
I wish I understood the depths of the why's, when's &amp; how's. When will it all make sense?
Sometimes it's easier to return to the familiar, MOSTLY b/c of fear of the unknown.
So much is going on, but in the midst of all the chaos Lord keep me in Your will.
Prayer is my pick-me-upper. Works every time.
Only You [God] can deliver.
I love The Lord, He heard my cry and pitted my every groan. Long as I live and trouble arise I'll hasten to His throne.
I have a headache.
Good morning folks! It's Hump day!

More of You and less of me, JESUS!

When Jesus say yes nobody can say no.
It is a little after 12 a.m. and I am still awake. That's definitely out of the norm.
Frozen 2 is in the works, and I haven't watched the first one yet. Is that bad?
Ants. Bugs. Mosquitos. Bees. Crickets. Flies. And the list goes on.... Ugh!
I didn't like the winter. Now I'm already getting annoyed with spring b/c of what follows.
And be able to address it as it is. March 12, 2015.

This joy that I have, the devil didn't give it to me and he sure AIN'T gon take it away.
I reclaimed it, and said...LIES! Not today, devil!
The devil tried to steal my joy early this morning with negative thoughts.
Western omelet, slices of tomato and dry wheat toast w/grape jelly, and a glass of milk to wash it down. Happy day!
Morning folks! Workout done. Now eating breakfast.
Jesus, I'll NEVER forget what you've done for me. #grateful
Lest I forget....
Don't ever look down on anyone else, unless you're picking them up.
Jesus will pick YOU up, if He have to reach wayyyyy down.
I want to be the best me I can be.
Don't let the devil ride. If you let him ride, he's sure to drive.
So, I'm watching the old episodes of #KUWTK and like, I wonder why Kourtney put up with Scott's foolishness back then!?
Good morning folks! Make it a good day.
If you gon talk the talk, I'd expect you to walk the walk. Practice what you preach!
The stigma is, black people talk, talk talk and NEVER do.

@_1Todd hey, bro what's wrong?
I have two children and when they were babies they did NOT sleep all through the night.
I don't understand why people use the term, "Sleeping/slept like a baby"....
Morning folks! Slept like a baby last night.
@ENews No! That doesn't fit her.
The Blood will NEVER lose its power!
Morning workout done. Now eating a heart healthy breakfast. Morning folks!
You should know that I lead NOT follow.
Ain't nobody gonna make.a fool outta me..nobody gonna tell me how it's gonna be...
Well, ya like to bring me down..but I ain't staying down...
Maybe I'm wrong?! Could it be, he's just trying to keep the team afloat while Durant is out??
Glad the #Bulls won last night. B/c it seems to me, as of late, Russell Westbrook has been all about self-gain and NOT the team...
@ravenshamiyah_ that's good baby sis. Keep it up!
It seems to me like, they should have like, a "Teen Mom Sisterhood pact". Not tweet horrible things to/about the other.
I never understand why any of the girls from "Teen Mom" feud with each other.
"A mind is terrible thing to waste". Read. Learn. Discover. Explore.
Lunch time.
The blessing I received solidified all the more, that when God has a blessing for me (you), ain't NO devil in hell big enough to block it!
God is so good!
Lord, I thank you for the blessing I received this morning. I know it's no goodness of mine own, but yours.
Take time for Jesus, or, you WILL take time to die.
Woke up, (at 5:20) sat a while and came to myself. Went to the restroom, then got on my knees and prayed.
Above all, I just wanna be/do right. Not my right, but God's right.
Sometimes I talk a little too much, don't listen enough..
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
Anyway, it's pretty outside today!
I do NOT eat healthy! I skip meals, which leads to me overindulging....on junk food.
Truth be told, I exercise on a consistent basis. But, I have poor eating habits. 😳😱
Tamar is so funny! She said, ladies should have a "Tuck away" account.

Today's prayer; Let this mind be in you (me) which was also in Christ Jesus...
Help me to be steady, like a tree planted by the rivers of water, in Jesus name...Amen!

It saddens me greatly, to know that people can be soooo mean.
I serve a GOD that can do everything!
I can't say, I know how she feels b/c I've never lost a parent. However, I empathize in her pain and pray she be ok.
I pray that Bobbi Kristina recovers. I pray God mend her brokenness, fill her emptiness, and give her peace of mind.

Sometimes we brake each others hearts with the words we say, let anger get in the way...
Sometimes we're locked inside the prisons of our pride...
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away with the words we forget to say...
Obviously, not! (Shoulders humped)

She has more class than the rest. Nene is shady, but she's so funny.
They're all boogie and shady. Well, except may be Cynthia.
I like watching MTV's Girl Code, but I'm about to watch Housewives of Atlanta now.
About to listen to some soul stirring music on Pandora's radio. #churchgirl
JESUS lives!
Be the BEST you, YOU can be!
I love what I see in the mirror. Mind, spirit &amp; body. #Inthatorder
My thigh and shoulder muscles are sore. #teamfitness  #keepittightkeepitright
After 23 years of marriage, and two beautiful daughters, what went wrong? Like, what was the breaking point? #LiveFromE
Let me get out of my feelings for a sec and wish my brother, Cedric a Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday, big bro! I love you to pieces.
I guess I'm in my feelings today.
The eyes don't lie. #love
My best friend was ALWAYS, ALWAYS there for me when needed.
It's so good to be home.
Nap time.
Lord help me to continue to decrease so You can continue to increase in my life. #dailyprayer
He (JESUS) promised to keep me in perfect peace, if I keep my mind stayed on Him.
I'm in a good place. And, Satan, you will NOT cause me to become entangled with the affairs of this world.
I thank GOD for the Holy Ghost!
(waving my hand) Lord, I thank for your grace and mercy that's kept me.
Actually, had it not being for His mercy, I would've let go...a long time ago.
GOD's mercy kept me, so I wouldn't let go.
I was brought here by the power of love, love by grace...
I know who holds tomorrow.
Don't stop praying...
It's time to say goodbye to the fan in my office. I suppose it fell one too many times. #ACproblems
Morning! So, I decided to do some house cleaning and laundry this morning, instead of my daily, morning workout regime.
I mean, C'mon! There are more serious things to investigate. Like, the countless cold case murders, and the thousands of missing kids.
And to assign Special Investigators to investigate whether Goodell was aware of the "actual" punching video is funny.
He should NOT catch the flak for the decisions grown men make. Be it Ray Rice, or whomever.
But I also feel like, to force him to step down as commissioner is just WRONG, and absurd. #SocialSquare
I support #RogerGoodell . I'm not saying the two game suspension was punishment enough....
We as people shouldn't be so eager to condemn the next. There's the media's account, TMZ, Ray Rice, Goodell's and then there's the truth.
However, he's no psychic and he certainly isn't Lord of the universe.
It's totally unfair to punish him for the actions of grown men. Yes, he is the commissioner of the NFL.
I am angered at the outcry for Roger Goodell to step down. I do NOT agree.
Lord, please comfort Melissa &amp; the family, as only you can. For You're the mender of broken hearts. #RIPJoanRivers
My heart is broken. There's no more laughter on Fashion Police. A beautiful color taken from the rainbow. #RIPJoanRivers
I love her. She's such a funny lady. What is Fashion Police without her? A thing of the past.
My thoughts and prayers goes out to @Joan_Rivers family.
I love all...
I'm not on that. I was simply conveying my reasons for not watching the #Emmys2014 or #ModernFamily .
I've never watched Modern Family and tbh, I never will. I do NOT support homosexuality.
I never watch the #Emmys . They glorify homosexuality. Modern Family has won 5 consecutive years.
Gotta get my mojo back.
I've been in such a slump. I haven't exercised in like, 2 weeks. Pitiful.
Hello, Twitter. It's been a while.
People gossip too freaking much.
It's like, public humiliation.
Yet my current situation is as an open book. Alone.
Perfect family, perfect life....
Everybody on cloud nine, loving life because they're not going through anything.
Feeling blah today. 😙
North West is aww-dorable!
All I need is a little love in my life...me and my broken heart...
I know I'm like, weeks late, but I'm so happy LeBron went back home. #Respect #StriveForGreatness
Oh, that's definitely not gonna work.
I upgraded from Sky cable to Directv, and the package I chose doesn't offer WeTv or LMN. What the what!
She totally hit the jackpot. Total package!
Create in me a clean heart O'God, and renew a right spirit within me....
Let's go Barons! Let's go!
I'm in a good place today.
In New Orleans at Beyoncé &amp; Jay Z's concert.
Nap time. 😗
Morning! 30 minutes workout....done!
That's mind games.
Quit playing games! If you miss me, just say that.
Prayer makes the difference.
RT @Mamba_Insider: Who is the better dunker in their career?	RT for Kobe Bryant 	FAV for Lebron James http://t.co/A7gaOO79xt
"Let the words of my mouth, and meditations of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O'Lord, my strength, &amp; my redeemer".....
&lt;&lt;&lt; hands raised. #Guilty
Random thought: People talk so LOUD, and most of the time they're like, totally unaware of it.
I have long, (real, not bought) pretty, black hair. I'd like for it to be like, silky and bountiful like the Kardashians.
Wish I had a professional (like, celebrity) hairstylist.
Did a lil cleaning this morning, not very much. Will finish later today.
And I'm so like, into my what-if thoughts to make the first move.
The worse part is not knowing what's going on.
Watching "I'm in love with a Church Girl" on #BET . Starring Adrain Balion &amp; Ja Rule.
And, if you think your god is dead, try my God. He's still very much alive.
I serve a God of second chances.
Sometimes you gotta do what you don't wanna do...
My worship is for real..
It is ridiculously HOT outside! Ugh!
Like a tree planted by the rivers of water Lord keep me steady...
Good night! I know I'll sleep good. What about you LeBron? Hahaha #No3peat #NBAFinals
I'm so happy for Kwahi Leonard. Well deserved! #NBAFinals
There won't be a parade in South Beach this year. Lol! #No3peat #NBAFinals
RT @Mamba_Insider: Hey @KingJames, THIS is how you 3Peat 🔥 http://t.co/zzqqBvCf40
I guess LeBron was cramping the entire series. #Cramps #No3peat
I'm so ecstatic! Like, omg! The Heat lost...yes! #No3peat #GoSpursGo
Happy Father's Day Daddy! I'm solid because you were ALWAYS solid. Thanks for loving my mom unconditionally. #FathersDay
I wanna dance with somebody who loves me...
God's got a blessing with my name on it.
RT @___D_B___: If God isn't in it,  it won't last.
Good morning! Another beautiful day in the neighborhood.
I'm so gone...
What are burpees? Inquiring minds wanna know..
I was really tired, so I decided to sleep in instead of working out this morning.
Happy 15th Birthday, Myrikle! Enjoy your special day at the museum.
Ahh, man! I missed the CMT awards last night.
Good morning! 30 minutes workout...done!
I try to give them the truth, yet, they hold on to their assumptions. #Whatever
It upsets me when people like, assume things about me.
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus...
He'll keep thee in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Him..
I give myself away, so you can use me...(O'God)
@4everLakersGirl Lol. I knew you were going to say that.
Please don't laugh....but, what are "thots"?? #DontJudgeMe
@Byrd_IsDa_Word that next to NOTHING she wore a few nights ago. You haven't seen the pictures?
I will say this, if she's brave enough to wear "NOTHING" she better be brave enough to deal with the backlash. Be it good or bad.
Wow! Rihanna is BRAVE! I commend her bravery....I wouldn't do it though. #toeachtheirown
I am starving. Tbh, I eat poorly.
I like watching Girl Code. The ladies on the panel are humorous.
In those jeans....
Only on E!.
A marathon of the Kardashian's is playing all day. Yayyyy!
People will try to figure out about whom I'm speaking of.
Ahhh! I can't say what I wanna say. I'm limited.
I have eaten and now I'm sleepy.
@Byrd_IsDa_Word ikr! Lol
Hey, follow me on Instagram. Same username. Thanks!
Well, it happened twice for my mom. 2 this month and 2 in August (on the same date).
What's the chance of siblings being born on the same date?
Happy Birthday to my two beautiful sisters, Raven &amp; Vanessa! #NotTwins
Note to self: Take 6 months to mind your own business....and take the other 6 months to leave other folks alone.
Who are WE (collectively) to judge what others do?
Good Morning! Be more quicker to think than to speak.
Watching Daddy's Little Girls. That Idris Elba...lawd have mercy! Smh.
My neighbors girls just came over to get something to drink. Glad I could be a help. #BeKindAlways
When you know better, you do better.
But now, as an adult, I'm seeking soulfood, strength and growth. #HonoringMaya
I'm glued to the television. In my years as a teen I would NOT have watched this, I'd be looking for comedy.
I wish I had known her personally. Sadly and shamefully, I have NEVER read any of her books. #HonoringMaya
I'm gaining strength from the words and life lessons of the late, extraordinary Dr. Maya Angelou. #HonoringMaya
Lord help me to consider my ways.

88 years old....long live Bishop Edwards.
The wisest person I know.
Thank God for my pastor.
Be encouraged no matter what's going on.
We could've had it all.
My boys are headed to their grandparents' house with their uncle. Peace &amp; Quiet.
Watched a good movie on LMN last night. And it made me to know that women like, really do have "the power."
@PBandJenelley_1 Lmbo. Barbara is funny.
@dreads_n_tats don't you dare. Settle down.
The road I'm traveling won't seem endless.
If I can only think positive and be encouraged EVERYDAY...
It's a mind thing. The battle is in my mind.
My eyes feel heavy.
5-1 5-0 somebody call the po po....Dierks Bentley.
Watch they lose. They hardly ever win.
At the Birmingham Barons game.
@dreads_n_tats No. Lmbo
Somebody asked me, why do I dislike him so much.
And there's nothing I'd like more than to "witness" LeBron James lose (especially in the Finals).
OKC doesn't have enough (consistent) fire power to defeat Miami.
I hope the Spurs win tonight.
Greater is coming.
I am NOT into tattoos. Therefore, I have a liken for men who doesn't have any. Namely: Dwayne Wade.
Good morning! It's so good to be alive.
Times when I couldn't carry myself, He carried me. I owe Him my life, and He deserves my praise. Hallelujah!
I have a testimony. God has brought me through some very tough situations.
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
I'd rather have JESUS than silver and gold.
Good morning! The world has lost another icon.
Too bad I don't wear short &amp; tight, skimpy clothes. B/c I workout vigorously, and boy, do I loveeeee the results.
Hope I have another good dream tonight.
Heaven knows.
Can't check Instagram. Ugh!
The internet at Regions Field suck!
If I had one wish...
I feel good!
OMG! Just met Clay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors.
Kids having kids. #16&amp;pregnant
He's such an idiot. His shirt is on backwards and he's totally wasted. #16&amp;pregnant
This thing called "Love".
Lord help me. My mind is so not geared up to go to this game tonight.
45 minutes of workout in. #TeamFitness
All the while, she's griping b/c they forgot to send utensils. Really???
My co-worker is totally funny. Someone was kind enough to send her lunch. She says, she's thankful....
People can be so ungrateful.
So hungry and sleepy. Headed home to get a nap. Later!
At least that's how I hope it turns out. #HateTheHeat
I'm predicting the Spurs over the Heat in 6, in the Finals.
There's NO way the Pacers are going to get pass Miami playing the way they're playing. No defense, and inconsistent offense.
Washington blew out Indiana! Lead by Gortat. Who scored 31 points. Smh!(Shame on Roy Hibbert)
Wishing you were here. 😢
The juice in my battery goes out too devilish quick. #iphoneproblems
Listen to that still small voice.
I'm doing fine, considering the drastic changes that has happened within the past few years. #ThankGod
The music they're playing in this stadium is not jumping. But the lyrics are beautiful.
My heart can't tell you no.
It's a blessing to be alive.
Good morning world!
I like that guy....a lot! 😍
Happy Mother's Day to my mom, Sandra...and also, all mothers everywhere.
Did I mention the Barons won?
I should be sleep but instead I'm checking Instagram.
Just got home a while ago from working the Birmingham Barons game.
#ThanksGuthyRinker
I've tried a few other acne treatments, and I must say Proactiv is the #1 treatment for clearing MY acne. #ThanksProactiv
Wish someone would be so kind as to buy/order me a Proactiv package. #redbumps #acne
That wasn't so bad. Most of the time I worry about nothing. #VirgoProblems
I made the phone call. Whew!
I have a slight headache.
I am beautiful! It stems from the inside, and radiates on the outside.
Put my 30 minutes in this morning. #teamfitness
*Singing* I feel like dancing, and leaping, and flying through the air...it's so good to be "Alive"!
Good morning! Rise, shine, give GOD the glory.
I'm not about to give up! #Survivor
1 thing I dislike about myself. I over think things. #Virgoproblems
Fear grips me. I'm terrified!
So, I'm walking into my garage and sees this black &amp; white cat standing there watching my every move.
I do NOT like cats.
He that dwell in the secret place shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty GOD...
Yes! LeBron didn't get it.
@ENews Sarah Jessica Parker looked stunning. Like, the whole Cinderella ballroom look was beautiful.
He's so hot, but, he's also hot-headed. #turnoff
Maks Chmerkovskiy's response to Abby Miller (guest judge) was very mean and like, so disrespectful. #DWTS
Acne...the story of my life.
I hear the chains falling...
There is power in the name of Jesus, to break every chain.
Back on my exercise grind. 45 minutes accounted for. #TeamFitness
I'm all in my feelings tonight.
I pretend it doesn't bother me, but the truth is, it's tormenting me.
I'm like, so totally over these two "love birds." #BarfBarf
Yes! Pacers won.
"Black folks" make up 85% of your team.
It's 2014 and segregation still is...
If God don't help me, who can I turn to??
Alone but not alone.
Ain't nobody but me and Jesus.
Bottled up emotions.
Ok, rant over!
Shoot! You give people an inch, they take a mile.
At some point Sir, you have to be more professional and do things in a business manner.
I try my best to be easy to work with, but, DON'T ever mistake my kindness as weakness.
I've had it like, up to my wits with that.
I'm going to flip the freak out on him. Seriously.
If this man bring me this paper work, written on a legal pad one more time.
All work and NO play.
What mom says that about their own child?!?! Only Barbara.
Barbara cracks me up. "Ya know, @PBandJenelley_1 can be such a little b****". Lmbo
Greater is coming. #Faith
I'm encouraged.
I've always been a fan of his. @RealLamarOdom
The Knicks sign @RealLamarOdom . @PhilJackson11 was behind that. Good move.
Just stop cold-turkey, huh??
I've been through a lot within the past few years, but most importantly, I've learned a lot. #Growth
We'll ALWAYS be friends. #Regardless
It's extremely hot on this bus. 😣
That was then, this is now.
GOD gives me peace in the midst of the storm.
Rain, rain, rain. Maybe it will wash away the pollen on my driveway.
No Bible study tonight. Yippee!
Love is a beautiful thing.
Its been a minute. What's up, Twitter?
Madea: Shut the_____up! Sound like a siren. Lmbo
Madea's Big Happy Family! I could watch that all day. It's hilarious!

Still hoping I see Kobe.
OMG! Bradley Beal is such a cutie!

I'm getting stronger as the days go by.
Day five of the after fact...
Snap out of it Stephanie, snap out!!
Day four of the after fact..
In the house of GOD. Eager to hear what thus saith the LORD.
Day three of the after fact...
Good morning world!
Day two of the after fact...
I'll understand it better by and by... #KeepMoving
For we know that all things work together for the good of them that love GOD and those who are called according to His purpose.
GOD is always standing by...
Gotta get back to my squats.
Tomorrow...(if The Lord be willing and the creek don't rise) I'm on it!
I haven't exercised in like, 6 days. Smh
We live and learn as we go.
All have sinned and come short of GOD's glory. #JudgeNot
All I can say is, it could've been me.
All things work together for the good of them that love GOD and those who are called according to His purpose.
It's so cold outside! #Brrrr
The Holy Ghost is real. So glad I got it.
I've got a seed in the ground... #ItsWorkingForMyGood
See GOD, He's leaning in my direction. I say, He's leaning in my direction.
Everything is wooorrking together for my good. Everything is working together for my good.
Singing...This is my season for grace, for favor, this is my season to reap what I have sown...
He's totally irreplaceable. I love him so much! #truelove
He challenges me to go beyond the norm. #truelove
He inspires me to be the best I can be. #truelove
Fresh out the shower. #SoFreshAndSoCleanClean
Watching CNN. I really like Gov. Christie! He seems cool and legit and not to mention I think he's quite funny.
It actually didn't reach frigid temperatures here. I'm being a bit extreme. Lol
I'm glad it has warmed up here (AL). I can not deal with frigid weather.
These folks are sloppy drunk. #SugarBowl
In New Orleans at the Sugar Bowl game. #RollTide
Precious memories how they linger....
Oopsy! What was I thinking?
Omg! I'm like, so ashamed of myself. Lol! My parents have 15 children, not 12.
(10) My sole purpose is to go to Heaven.
(9) I have the gift of singing. I get it from my dad's side of the family.
(8) Omg! I overthink everything...literally!
(7) I have a BIG heart and I'm like, very mushy (soft).
(6) I'm very bashful.
(5) I was born and raised in a holiness church. And still attend the (same) church to this day.
(4) I'm a HUGE Lakers fan and a crazed Kobe fan.
(3) I totally dislike when a guy sees me for the 1st time, and like, immediately he's trying to "get with me". I'm like, you don't know me!
10 things you don't know about me; (1) I'm the 5th child of 12 children.                 (2) I'm terrified of rats/mice.
Ahhhhhh!
The topic of last night's Bible Study was "Love ye one another".
The surprising release of Beyoncé's new album is trending EVERYWHERE. The girl is just BAD! #Beyonce
@1Todd_205 oh, him. Wow! Lol
@1Todd_205 who? Dallas or Gerrick?
Death creeps up on you like a slithering snake.
I like both teams but I'm going for Cam Newton today.
In New Orleans at the Saints &amp; Panthers game.
And if you see a baby, then you know the mother is not very far away. Yikes!
I know it's so NOT professional, but I'm terrified of snakes.
And today, I'm still very much freaked out about it. Insomuch that I have my feet propped up in a chair at my desk.
So, yesterday, I walked upon a baby snake (at least that's what it looked like) in the hallway leading to my office.
Too little, too late! Move along.
One person's (so-called) junk is another person's treasure. #ImHappy

I'm a Virgo, and we are such perfectionist(s). Therefore, I do NOT like making errors, especially simple errors.
I choose to be happy. It's a mind thing.
Since I hadn't worked out in like, 4 days. I decided to put an hour in this morning instead of 30 mins, and boy, do I feel GREAT!
Headed out on my lunch break.
I had a good night last night.
Ahhhhhh! (Inhale, exhale)
With you &amp; God by my side I'll bloom and grow so beautifully...

I've got the eye of the tiger, louder than a lion and you're gonna hear me "Roar".
It hurts beyond words but I know it's better off this way. 😢😢
That blessing I've been waiting for it's on its way. In JESUS name, Amen!
Day 15 of the shutdown.
I have a terrible headache.
Day 14 of the shutdown.
When is a "dream" more than just a dream??
I'd like to go watch Baggage Claim.
And the reason is they've being playing it on #GMA all week.
Katy Perry's song "Roar" has been stuck in my head for like, a few days now.
@Bahdlikedhet lol...I figured that was the case. You're so excused.
@Bahdlikedhet Lol..what's up with you sissy?? You've turned into Corella Deville. Lmbo
Happy user. Proud user.
This Proactive stuff like, really works.
Day 10 of the shutdown.
This happens every single time. I should've known better.
I wanna put you on repeat play you everywhere I go...
In other news; Day 9 of the shutdown.
Something tells me this will be the last season of #KUWTK  😥
It seems to be a curse. 1st Nene &amp; Greg (who have since remarried) 2nd Clint Eastwood &amp; Dina, and now the Jenner's. Smh..
Maybe people, particularly celebrities should really count up the cost before allowing cameras into their home.
It saddens me so to learn of Kris &amp; Bruce Jenner's separation. 😣😣
Chris Brown is on a Twitter rant. I'd really like to know who he's feuding with this time.
I so love the Kardashian's! Like, seriously.
Great is your mercy towards me, your love and kindness towards me. Great is your mercy I see, day after day.
If I had one wish...
Day 6 of the shutdown.
Ole' boy might be playing both fields. If ya know what I mean. Ijs
The point I'm trying to stress is, ya might need to do a background check honey.
No offense to the gays/lesbians. I'm not hating at all.
Honey, I know you don't wanna hear this, but, your boyfriend looks so gay.
Day 4 of the shutdown.
Season 3 of #Scandal premiers tonight. Yayyy!
Day 3 of the shutdown.
A BIG s/o to @Byrd_IsDa_Word  Happy Birthday girl! Enjoy!
Let's go Bama! #RollTide
I personally, have found that to be ever so true.
It has been said, "Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
@Byrd_IsDa_Word Aww! Thanks Byrdie Byrd.
Nobody greater than You.
Thank You, JESUS for keeping me in my right state of mind.
As soon as I'm down to the last jelly, it traps me. Leaving me handicapped with like, NO possible moves. #Rigged
Candy Crush really irks me. This level (70) is impossible.
S/O to allllllll my fellow Virgos. I love who I am. 😃
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Somebody's birthday is tomorrow. 🎉🎈🎊🎁
If you've tried everything and everything has failed, try JESUS. He NEVER fails.
"This too shall pass."
But, by ALL means necessary, "Keep Moving."
If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, crawl. If you can't crawl, slide.
Be considerate, be fair, be patient with each other and above ALL lets love one another as Christ love us all. #Peace
Talk to one another right, be honest, say what you have to say, but say so in a respectful manner.
LORD help us to all just get along.
Why is @PBandJenelley_1 tweeting such harsh things about/to the girls of Teen Mom 3? By now, she should be above such childish behavior.
3rd time making headline news, since his infamous acquittal.
George Zimmerman can NOT stay out of the news.
Sometimes the only available transportation is a leap of faith.
And it was as though, like, GOD was literally saying that to me. Like, I just felt it ALL over me.  "Let JESUS fix it"!
One of the (experienced) mothers in the church sang "Let JESUS fix it" yesterday during service.
LORD help me to help myself stay OUT of it.
I should just step aside GOD's got the situation all in control.
I know I gotta overcome that. Once again I failed the test.
It's like, so crazy how I let my emotions get the best of me.
I have to admit I go to the EXTREME with everything...everything pertaining to my ❤, that is.
I couldn't help but to laugh. Lmbo I ❤my babies!
I slightly popped my 3 year old on the hand, and he goes "that didn't hurt my hand". Lol
Live in your truths (whatever IT may be).
I wish I could afford to have Stanley Steamer (deep) clean my carpet.
This Candy Crush game really be working my nerves. #RelaxStephanie
I mean like, what happened?? I'd really like to know what the downfall was.
Like, he and Khloe appeared (from the outside) to be soooo happy and in love.
Just sitting here wondering like, when/where did it all go wrong for Lamar.
RT @MagicJohnson: My prayers go out to Lamar Odom as he enters rehab.
Acne. Wish I didn't know it. #TheStruggleIsReal 😣😣
Football season kicks off tomorrow. Yayyy!
@Byrd_IsDa_Word that might just be in your genes. B/c I remember growing up, Jamai hands were always cold as well.
Lunch time!
I get cold real quick. Does that mean I have low iron??
Happy Birthday, Beyonce!
Thank GOD for being under true leadership.
It's kinda like the rich man and Lazarus. Like my pastor always say, "Short term sacrifice for long term gain".
And when winter came had no shelter or food. And then remembered the ant.
Be smart like the ant and prepare for war NOW, or, be like the grasshopper, who played all summer long and mocked the ant for working...
Ariel Castro committed suicide. His real punishment has now begun. Hell fire is real folks.
Watching reruns of 16 &amp; pregnant. I love that show.
My daily prayer is, "LORD help me to decrease so You can continue to increase in my life. Take away all of my selfish pride".
I'll NEVER understand that. #Ijs
Like, why shave the real ones and then turn around and draw cartoon eyebrows???
Ok! I am soooo NOT a fan of fake, draw on eyebrows.
LORD, I thank You!  I thank You! I thank You! I thank You! #ProblemSolver
He was arrested this morning for DUI. Lamar please get the help you need.
The troubles for Lamar Odom continues to erupt. Smh...I feel bad for Khloe Kardashian.
I hold the winning cards though. J.E.S.U.S.
Sadly, life doesn't flow like that. You learn as you live.
If I could turn back the hands of time.
I love watching Soul Food (the series).
Well, let me rephrase that. He talks a lot. Because he could be dumb and unable to speak. So, I'm grateful he has the ability to do so.
My 3 year old talks too much.
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgo season is the best season. ♍
Money, fame, the big-head &amp; lots and lots of women. Ijs
May be he married too young? Then got drafted into the NBA, and we all know what takes place next.
He appears to be a very hands on dad. I was just wondering if he was aware of the fact.
@Byrd_IsDa_Word Lol! Shoot! If that's the case, I'm always available for a hug. Lol
You see, the thing is, I wonder if he knows that part of being a good dad is being a good husband. And loving the mother of your children.
"I probably was a bad husband but I pride myself on being a good dad" -Dwayne Wade
I read an article in Jet magazine. In which, Dwayne Wade admitted, and I quote...
What's up with Miley Cyrus' behavior? The girl has gone ballistic.
Whatever it is, I pray he get the help he needs.
What's going on with Lamar Odom?
My last RT is so on it. That's exactly my thing. Nobody's business but ours!
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos don't have the desire to tell everybody who they're with simply because they think it's not everyones business.
Therefore, I fell in love with his game. (Not to mention, his cuteness, with the lil afro and freshness about him)
MJ time was expiring and KB was the new kid on the block.
Note: To whom it may concern: Kobe is my FBPOATs b/c when I developed a love and an interest for BB...
Kobe Bean Bryant. Happy 35th Birthday! Enjoy, continue recovering and getting ready for the upcoming season. #GoLakers
I like to send a huuuugeee shout to my favorite basketball player of all times...
I hope Kim is really happy with Kanye.
Baby North West is adorable.
However, it seems like the easiest thing to do when times get hard.
Giving up is NOT an option.
Lol...seriously, I'm done with that topic now. 😛
See, people think since you don't call their hand out loud, you don't know what cards their holding.
Enough of that. Just had to get that off my chest.
Pray for 'em but also watch 'em.
Like the good LORD said, "Watch and pray"...
People so fake! Skinning and grinning in your face and all the while trying to yank the rug from under your feet.
There's only three people in my entire neighborhood I completely trust.
That doesn't mean I consider any them my friends.
I laugh and casually talk with a lot of people.
I'm a very private person.
Anyway, good morning! GOD is great and greatly to be praised.
Woke up late today. 😗
Actually, he's like, the wisest man (person) I know. #ThankGod4Him
Heard those sayings from my 87 year old, ever-so-wise pastor.
You're known be the company you keep.
If you don't know who to hang around, you better know who to stay away from.
It's a beautiful morning! Thankful to be alive!
Through it all GOD is still good!
My AC is not working. Wrong season to go out in.
Thanks mom &amp; dad! You guys are the best parents EVER!
I could definitely use some me time.
The boys are at their grandparents house for the weekend.
Where would I be if JESUS didn't love me? #DontWannaFindOut
For, it's in You that I live and breathe and I have my being. You are my life!
Without You there is NO me.
LORD I trust your plan for my life.
I could eat that whole carrot cake. It be slap ya momma good.
HolyGhost filled and water baptized!
Church was good last night. GOD was definitely in the midst.
Glad to be in the land of the living. #Grateful
All u Heat bandwagons go follow me on IG @4everlakersgirl since being a follower is ur pet pev. Lol
Is it true that Raven Simone is a lesbian??
The 2013-14 season can't arrive quick enough for me. I'm like, so eager to see them lose.
It appears Miami has gained another follower. #Bandwagons #GregOden
And to this day I still blame Angelina Jolie.
I'm really happy Jennifer Anniston found love again, after Brad Pitt. It took me like, forever to come to terms with their break-up.
LORD, I thank You! #Grateful
To know better is to DO better!
Enough about JB. In other news, I'd like to travel to California.
Hopefully he gets the necessary help before the wheel runs off. He's like, this wanna be bad boy.
He's on the path of self-destruction. Like Lindsay Lohan &amp; Amanda Bynes.
Justin Bieber is such a kid. It's so obvious...
@Byrd_IsDa_Word ain't he though. Lol
My last RT has my name written all over it. Definitely me!
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos take so much to heart, but we try not to show it.
Well, I suppose I'll watch "Love &amp; Basketball" then. Love that movie!
I can't seem to find "The Best Man" DVD anwhere.
Keep it together Stephanie, keep it together!
JESUS, he still move me inside. (taking deep breaths) #TrueLoveNeverDie
But, nah-ah..smh! All it took was a brief conversation and here I go, smiling and reminiscing and stuff. So LOVE struck!
There I go again, getting all sentimental. U'd think I'd know better...right??
I'm going to have a "strong finish" because I have "strong faith". Beautiful words to the song "Finish Strong".
Less of me and more of u (JESUS).
Besides I'm due for an upgrade.
Oh, well, things happen. It's so NOT the end of the world. GOD is still good!
Ahhhh, man! Dropped mu iphone (on the carpet) and now it won't come back on w/o being plugged into the socket.  #SoIrritated
I'm stronger, I'm wiser, I am better...much better...GOD kept me!
Never would've made it without Him (GOD).
Thank GOD for keeping me sane through this whole ordeal.
Bought sense is the BEST sense. #LessonLearned
Wish I knew then what I know now....
Listening to iHeart radio. "I need just a lil mo' JESUS"...Erica Campbell of MM
@RobinRoberts is without a doubt a remarkable woman. I love her sooooo much and I've never met her. #Resilient
What's up with the Lamar Odom deal?? I thought he was resigning w/the @Lakers ...ign
That last RT is so me. I don't trust these folks. #BackStabbers #TwoFaced
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos have a select few people they "really" talk to.
Remember Samuel L. Jackson in "A Time to Kill"?? #ZimmermanTrial
I'll NEVER move to Florida. #ZimmermanTrial
How did we NOT expect an acquittal,  with the jurors being 1 Latino and 5 native American White women??? Duhh!! #ZimmermanTrial
Awaiting the verdict. Keep calm whatever the outcome! #ZimmermanTrial
@dallas_tb_34 I do don't it?? I've been working on that. Lol
@dallas_tb_34 NOT!! Helloooo, the won two rings back2back with him.
In case y'all didn't know...they call me "the female Dick Vitale". #NBAbroadcaster
He's not known as great defender. Well, guess I'll just have to wait and see how he contributes.
Now, about Kris Kaman...his offense as a Clipper was pretty consistent. In Dallas, he basically rode the bench and got garbage minutes.
I'm glad Dwight is history! Cause' personally, I've always thought that was a bad move.
Happy the @Lakers are close to signing @RealLamarOdom again! Never should've traded him anyway.
his dedication to being a hands on dad, and his courage to voice his mistakes. The bonus is he's tattoo free. I love that! @essencemag
@essencemag  thanks for featuring D-Wade. I'm not a Miami Heat fan. However, I love his (D-Wade) persona! His humbleness to fame, etc...
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos aren't secretive they just don't want everyone in their business no matter how small it is.
@VirgoNation So true!
Watching B.A.P.S
Thank GOD I think differently.
And he's all on news like, "what can I say, the ladies don't "like" me, they "love" me. Smh! #Suchanembarrassment
I heard on news, there's like, this guy, who has 22 children by 14 different women. #Pitiful #verypitiful
@sondrabrass yup, that's ya nephew.😄
@sondrabrass Lol...he sure is. And stop meddling how my baby talk (torn bread). Lol
This game is really annoying me. Can't seem to conquer level 29. #CandyCrushSaga

Tip off is nearing. Make me :) Indiana. Send LeBron fishing!
So excited about tonight's HUGE game 7...Indiana vs Miami! #LetsGoIndiana
I have the victory! For NO weapon formed against me shall prosper. GOD said it, and I believe it. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Satan, you're a liar! And the father of it.
Doesn't feel like cooking. #Lazy #eat #out
IHOP, anyone?? #hungry #strawberry #pancakes
@SherriEShepherd hahaha...too funny!
Inhale........Exhale....taking deep breaths!
No matter how hard I try to fight these feelings, I guess somethings NEVER go away. #StillInLove
Today is gonna be one of those days...Ugh!
@Ravenn99 you betta watch your language ma'am!!!!!
She shows NO remorse for her actions. It's all about dear, ole #Jodi playing the victim. Cold blooded murderer!
#JodiArais is a convicted murderer. There is a GOD!
Good morning birdies! The early bird gets the worm!
I'm a die hard @Lakers fan! @kobebryant has absolutely NOTHING to prove...to anyone! The proof is in the pudding!
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same GOD is worthy to be praised. #Give #Him #The #Glory
Not feeling good at all. #Dizzy
Grits are no good once they're cold. #trash
Morning y'all! Eating breakfast.
I'm encouraged! For, NO weapon formed against me shall prosper!
Wait on the Lord, be of good courage and He shall strengthen thine heart.
Louisville won? That's good! I'm happy for #kevinware
Good morning folks!
I could really use a nap like, round about now. 💤
Yesterday was great, today will be greater.
It's a lovely day to have my baby's birthday party. Unfortunately, I have to work. The bills aren't gonna pay themselves.
Happy Birthday mommies boobie! You're such a handful but I love every bit of you! 🎉🎉❤
On this day three years ago, my water broke and approximately 2 hours later I had a beautiful, healthy 7 lbs 5 oz boy.
Good morning birdies!
My baby will be 3 years old tomorrow. Wow! He's growing up like, so fast.😂
I'm so loving this iphone! Thanks to my brother, Justin!
Prayed a prayer for #Louisville #KevinWare . I'd NEVER seen anything so disturbing.
Is #TeenMoms Amber Portwood out of jail yet? #JustWondering

Finally finished the Sudoku puzzle. #SmartLady
My boys are at their grandparent's for Easter weekend w/their aunt, uncles &amp; cousins. The house is too quiet.
Ya lost, fair &amp; square! #NextGame #Please
If they had won, he wouldn't have said a darn thing about the way the game was officiated. So, like, don't say nothing now!
LeBron needs to toughen up! He's whining b/c they lost and the streak is apart of history now.
RT @RevRunWisdom: Life is full of give and take... Always remember to GIVE thanks &amp; TAKE nothing for granted!!!!
Been working on this Sudoku puzzle for like, three days now. #Concentrate
Healthy hearty breakfast! Whole grain, wheat rice, scrambled eggs w/cheese, slice ham &amp; wheat toast followed by a glass of fruit punch.
Should've said, 5 days a week.
Morning everyone! 30 minutes workout..√ 5x a week.
I so love the Kardashians! #GreatLaughter
@Rocking_Levis_ great! Call me, I might catch a ride w/you. I'll inbox (FB) my number to ya. I get off @ 4:30.
I meant * world*...not word! #Madeanerror
I'm encouraged! For, greater is HE that is within me, than he that is in the word.
@Rocking_Levis_ hey, about what time are you coming??
That song that says "the boys are back in town" is like, always in my head. And I have no idea who sing it.
Grateful to be in the land of the living! #TooBlessed #ToBeStressed
Good morning birdies! Beautiful Thursday morning!
Streak over! Good job Chicago! Goodnight!

Headed to Bible Class. #Feedthesoul
@Fromdat_mud601 yea, y'all got stubborn down pack. Smh..Lol
Oh, yea, and my eyebrows need to be arched...ASAP!
I need to get a manicure and pedicure.
The Lakers lost again?? Smh...Their chances of making the playoffs are looking pretty dim. Still #GoLakers
Moral of the story...Examine yourself!
Often times we over look what's IN the mirror for looking at what's ON the mirror.
Top of the morning folks. Make it count! #Workout #Grind #Teamfitness
@sondrabrass Lol...that lil girl
There are NO good things in this earthly body. Therefore, I must decrease so Christ can increase.
I (try to) read a few chapters of the Bible daily. Today I read Genesis 45 &amp; 46.
LORD, I've come a long way, and still have a long way to go. #I #wanna #be #like #Jesus
I'm mi own PI (Private Investigator). I find the truth for miself. #SoDontLieToMe
I can't hold this tongue of mine for nothing. #JesusHelpMe
What she means is, his parents are "no good" so, therefore, his chances of being "no good" are twice as high. Poor Jace! Lol
And Jenelle goes, what do you mean, he's so screwed up? Lmbo
The test revealed that he is indeed Jace's father. Upon leaving the lab, Barbara say,"Omg! This is terrible news, Jace is so screwed up" Lol
Barbara had me dying laughing. On episode 312, Jenelle had a paternity test done to determine if Andrew was Jace's father...
Just watched an episode of Teen Mom 2 online. I love that show!
Truth is I'm tired, and options are few...
This situation is too BIG for me. So, LORD, I give it to U.
I love to read! It's like, very therapeutic.
RT @1Todd_205: Sick of @SportsCenter talking about The Heat
Morning folks! "Let not your heart be troubled, if ye believe in GOD believe also in me (JESUS).
@981TXT Kobe Bryant.
Bible Class time (in about 20 min).
Prayer changes things...pray w/o ceasing.
@kobebryant I hope you're able to play on Friday. #GoLakers
Now, let me get some paper work done.
Just woke up from a much needed hour and a half nap...in my office. #Soneededthat
@___D_B___ Amen to that!
Good morning! Spring season officially begins today!
@sondrabrass Charming Charlie??? Never heard of that.
Be there, the LORD will ALWAYS be there. #Faithfultilltheend
He's better than VO5, He holds in all kind of weather, He's better than scotch tape, hey, you can't see'em but you know He's there...
He's better than campbell soup, He's hmm hmm good, He's better than maxwell He's good till the last drop...
He's (JESUS) better than Delta, He's ready when you are, He's better than coke He is the real thing....
Listening to The Anointed Pace Sisters..."JESUS be a fence all around me".
@sondrabrass Cute! Imma have to get those sunglasses. :)
@sondrabrass Ikr, that what I told him. Lol
@sondrabrass Lol...Caden loves that movie. He watch it like, ever night.

LORD don't take your spirit from me. I'd be like a ship without a sail. #NoPurposeForBeing
Good Saturday morning!
I hate when an eyelash get in my eye. I stop whatever I'm doing and head to the nearest restroom (mirror).

Morning y'all! Another 30 minutes workout counted for. #TeamFitness
Well, that's done! #HairWashed #NiteNite

Blasting Isaac Carree "In the middle"...that song makes me move. Love that song!
@buffie24_ Nice get up sister! Represent them #Lakers :-)
Been singing "How much do I owe Him" like, just about all morning. (continues singing)
In other words, experience is the best teacher!
The best sense is bought sense!
@sondrabrass Oh! Well, goodnight! Lub u!
@sondrabrass Are u at Joie's place?
@sondrabrass Watch it! I'm obsessed with that show. Can't get enough of it.
@buffie24_ Oh! I hope it's nothing serious. But, we're all doing good. Love u, sister!
My legs are sore from working out. #NoPain #NoGain
I will keep all those memories of the good times....
Omg! She's pregnant!? She who? She her, she me (Tamar Braxton-Herbert).
Palmer's Cocoa Butter lotion is the best!
Stupid song made me think of u, I listened to it for a minute, but then I changed it....#ALittleBitStronger
@buffie24_ what's wrong sister?
Create in me a clean heart, oh GOD,  and renew a right spirit within me...
LORD help me...there are things in me, that's NOT of You!
Like, my drive and energy be so high, like, I could run a marathon. #Teamfitness
In other news...I feel sooo good (mentally &amp; physically) after my workout.
Good morning everyone! Happy Tuesday! (It's trash day in my neck of the woods)
@usweekly NO, no and no! She's too self-righteous.
Bro. Ford on the radio broadcast. (Turning the volume DOWN) #LordForgiveMe
Got too much on the mind...one of them das!
Morning!
@sondrabrass Lol...Oh, is that what u call it? I thought it was being safe/careful.
@sondrabrass Omg! I do the same thing. Lol
@sondrabrass I know I'm being like, over the top....but I don't support their relationship. Sooooo, therefore, I don't watch their movies.
Then here comes "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith" ....I haven't even watch that movie, and don't plan on.
But Brad &amp; Jen was like, my favorite celebrity couple.
#Pretty #Pathetic #Huh ???
It's so bad, like, I'll turn the volume down on the T.V. to keep from hearing whatever is being said about her.
Whenever I hear Angelina Jolie's name I get like, really, really upset. #HateHer
Since I've been working out 6x a week, consistently, I feel so rejuvenated, so refreshed. Ahh! :-)
Good morning! It's Friday, it's Friday...
@sondrabrass mi sister is beautiful! BTW, I've never heard of that.
I'd like to go to the movies this weekend, but I'm afraid I have a game to work. :(
LORD, I'm helpless without You. I'd be like a fish without water, like a child without its mother...
Good morning birdies! Another 30 minutes workout in the books. #Teamfitness
The lil one who gets virtuall whatever it is she might want. #I #guess #Im #the #forgotten #child

My mom sent me a box of girl scout cookies.
GOD has NO respect of person!
I'm talking heart to heart, eye to eye kinda love.
What we shared was "REAL LOVE"! #NoDoubt
I believe yes, yes I do believe....He's able to turn the tables in my favor...
*Singing*....LORD let your mercy and grace shine on me...Angelo &amp; Veronica's version
Good Tuesday morning folks! Blessed and highly favored in the LORD.
Oops! Did I say that out loud? #LordHelp
Bible Study everynight till Thursday....Ugh!
I hate when people borrow a CD, or DVD from me and I have to constantly remind them that they haven't returned it.
I don't socialize with sometimey folks. Like, nobody's dying for your (seasonal) friendship.  #Fake # ChildPlease #GrowUp
@buffie24_ Love and miss you, too, sister! Be careful!
BTW, @Lakers won! Woohoo!
Morning birdies! 30 minutes workout flow. #Teamfitness

Just STOP it, it is NOT that serious!!  #SuchPretenders
Like, that can't eat, can't sleep, reach for the stars, over the moon, world series kinda stuff...
I believe in the power of love. And I know when in love, the feeling can be sooooo over whelming.
While secretly longing and desiring for another?!?!
And, it has me wondering like, exactly how many married couples are married to one person....
So, I'm reading Camilla Parker Bowles' biography, about her 20 year affair with Prince Charles.
Good Tuesday morning folks!
Yikes! There's a chipmunk on the loose inside the church.
Good win for the @Lakers yesterday. 103 - 99  #GoLakers
Well, actually, I've been up since like, 5:30 but I'm just now speaking.
Good morning birdies!
What's from the heart reaches the heart. &lt;3 &lt;3
She's dead and his life is pretty much ruined. No more olympics for him.
Reading an article in SI about the Blade Runner (Oscar Pistorius). It's really sad.
I Look To You....#WitneyHouston
Every road that I've taken led to my regret and I don't know if I'm gone make it, nothing to do but lift my head....
These people are so messy....smh  Like, that's why I keep my business, my business. #Gossipers
That awkward moment when you step into your bubble bath, and realize the water is luke warm. #Ugh

Good morning! Hopefully everyone else is having a good morning, 'cause I sure as heck ain't?
Nobody knows the pain I feel.
Feeling blue.... :(
I DON'T trust females.
Dr. Buss was the master mind behind the 10 Larry O'Brien trophies. Sad day for the @Lakers organization. #RIPDrBuss
In total disbelief rite now! To learn that death has claimed the life of an awesome man, Dr. Jerry Buss. #RIPDrBuss

I feel great this morning. GOD is good!
Good morning!
We'll watch a Nicholas Sparks movie. And go with the vibe.
It's gonna be a good night for me. #HappyValentineDay Stephanie! :-)
But, honestly they look alright. I mean, like, I'm NOT gonna start a business or anything. Lol #SillyMe
Now, if I had to grade myself... I'd get a C for effort.
This year I decided to be creative and hand make Valentine cards for my loved ones....
Happy 1st Birthday, lil Kylen! Although, you have no idea who I am.
Hey, Good morning birdies!
JESUS, you're the center of my joy, all that's good and perfect comes from You.

Charlie Sheen is something stupid.
And there would totally be NO excess body fat or juggling of the thighs. Ugh!
That way, I'd be privileged to be a stay at home mom and able to go to the gym, at least 5x a week.
I wish my husband was really, really wealthy. Like, a billionaire, or maybe someone who inherited like, this HUGE fortune.
My stomach is totally gettiing BIG.
I'm starving...didn't get to eat breakfast this morning, had to hurry and get back to work. :(
Good morning birdies!
Well, you think that you know me, know me, but baby, you don't know a thing about me.....
You should know that I lead not follow....
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what I'm gonna do, ain't nobody gonna make a fool outta me....
My hair hasn't been washed in like, two months. #Dirty
Wish I could stay in bed and watch movies all day. Mood; Lazy!
Lord help me to keep my conversations holy.
Good morning birdies!
Good morning! Forget what happened yesterday, it CAN'T be undone....move forward.

The power of life &amp; death lies in the tongue, with that being said...
Good morning!
I just have to learn to be patient. #HardestPart
HE wouldn't have brought me to it if HE wasn't going to bring me through it.
I know GOD is working it all out!
Like Brandi's song "It's a shame u (I) had to learn the hard wae". #LessonLearned
U don't miss a good person til he/she is no longer around.

This sucks! #NeedACar
Watched "He got game" earlier, and I have to admit Rae Allen was an attractive cutie pie....then!
Let's be completely honest with each other.
We really need to have a heart to heart talk.
Good morning birdies! Think positive!
@Byrd_IsDa_Word Good morning! :)
Logging off, I have a MAJOR hangover!
Sigh! Heaven knows I adore u!

I'm getting so emotional. Gosh! After almost 12 months of not talking, talking to one another, u still move me inside! #TrueLove
U know I'll NEVER stop loving u! #NEVER
I like, can't express how torn I am! Please, please forgive me!
I hurts me sooo much more just to know that I brought hurt upon u! :(
I NEVER meant to hurt u! (insider)
My heart's desire is to be like JESUS! #HeavenBound
Time and chance has happened to them (us) all.
I feel awful! That meeting this a.m. left a knot in my stomach.
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos always know when your lying.
Gotta do away with the insecurities boo boo! #LoveYourself
Stephanie, Stephanie, if u would just keep ur mouth CLOSED!!! #LessonLearned
Purge me LORD, JESUS, anything in me that is NOT like You take it out!
A while back I tweeted, "it was a mistake signing Nash", due to his age.I was so wrong! He makes a HUGE difference directing the offense.
Christmas was GREAT.....the @Lakers won!   I love me some Kobe! #HiHaters
I'm bout to go straight OFF! #LIVID
LORD, help me not to go off....
What do u cook when u don't feel like cooking?? #NeedAButler
I bet he miss me just as much as I miss him! #ThingCalledLove
I'm such a sweet and caring lady! I love who I am!
I LOVE the LORD and I won't take it back, HE has been so good to me!
I'm confident things will turn around for the better!
Good morning birdies! :)
Lmbo...what does he know about Kim Kardashian???
Caden brought me his brother's belt and I said, "Thank u"! He responds, OMG! U're tring to sound like @KimKardashian
#ChurchFlow @ 6:00
About to log off twitter, and watch #TeenMom2 online.
I need to join Planet fitness.
I wanna confront him so freaking bad, but I'll wait and let him sink his own self.
Oh! Morning birdies!
I need a new laptop. DANG! #NewOrUsed
The meanest thing u ever did, is come around!
It's like, finding out ur diamonds is from her old promise ring, a call back from the fortune teller, she read ur card upside down...
One look at u and I was through mi heart switched up on me, like a postcard from paris when I seen the real thing....
Good morning birdies! Get up and make it count!
Good night! #Tired
Bible class was great! Good job, Minister!
Who misspells their own name??? #Me
In due time, Stephane...in due time! #HoldOn
Good morning lil birdies! Note to self: Give it JESUS, HE can handle ALL!
@dreadz_slangin Kmsl
I'm so wrong! I turned the radio off to avoid hearing Bro. Ford. Lmbo
@dreadz_slangin and I'm about readi for u to move back also! :)
@malinawalker23 LOL
I'm exhausted! Been at the hospital with Caden for like, the past 3 hours. #SlowFolks
Repent and turn from ur wicked deeds. GOD will forgive everthing...except blaspheme against the HOL GHOST!
Sin is sin! However, some are an abomination unto HIM. And begin to stink in GOD's nostrils.
No sin is greater than the other!
This world is doomed and it's coming DOWN in flames!
And ladies &amp; gentlemen, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the COMING OF THE SON OF MAN!!! #ThatsBible
HE destroyed the city of Sodom &amp; Gomarrah in the Bible for the same reason. #Homosexuality
Calling right wrong and wrong right, no one can speak againt homosexuality, without being ridiculed. Well, Ma'am &amp; Sir, you're sinning!
Nobody wants to say the name JESUS, or acknowledge the HOLY GHOST! They rather say Holy Spirit instead.
And that's exactly what Satan is trying to do. State legislators have taken prayer out of schools, legalized same sex marriage (some states)
This fight is between GOD &amp; the Devil! When GOD put Satan out of Heaven, he said, he would exalt his throne above GOD's.
Guns are NOT the problem! People are the problem!
Now there was a shooting at a Mapco gas station in Tuscaloosa! #OneDead Smh
This person shot and killed, that person stabbed to death...like, dang! Where is the LOVE??? #TheEndIsNigh
Oh! Good morning lil birdies!
Several other parents no longer have that privilege b/c a highly disturbed MONSTER took it away. #PrayersForNewtown
I count myself totally BLESSED this morning...I can look upon my babies face, hug &amp; kiss them.
The @Lakers are so inconsistent! #UpandDown
JESUS is the answer for the world! Violence is on an all new HIGH! #Sad
I hate when the killer(s) take the cowardly way out by committing suicide. #Punk(s) #Newtown
I thought people were suppose to be in the spirit of giving during the holiday season???
How could he kill his own mother?? It's so apparent he was a "cold blooded creature"...no heart whatsoever! #Newtown
Innocent babies...smh! #Newton
Totally at a loss for words right now. Like, really? An elementary school...praying for all involved! #Newton
Hahaha....Relax people the're words to song :)
I just want to la down and die, GOD if u hear me come near me...
I just can't take it no more...
I need to clear mi head and get it together. #Focus
#MiamiHeat lost! Well, whip da do! :)
Morning lil birdies! :)
I'm sitting there fanning mi face, like a white girl...
Hearing #GabbiDouglas mom tell how she felt when her daughter won the gold made me tear up...
Oh, well! I no longer think that of him.
I'm not quite sure what gave me that assumption of him???
At one time I thought he was like, this wanna be plaer.
I love the new and improved @BenAffleck ! He's a hands-on dotting dad, and a romantic and caring husband.
I'm a die hard #Lakers fan, but I must admit the SUCK as of late! :(
LORD help me because I'd rather not hear him at all...
Bro. Ford is taking too much of Minister's time...and I'm sure he knows it..Ugh
I hope the #Steelers lose!
I have the worst headache ever! Ugh...
RT @VirgoNation: #Virgos tend to not believe things unless they see it first.
@VirgoNation OMG! That is so me!
Back to the #BCS we go! #RollTide
@Mzz_sweet_lips that's good!
@Mzz_sweet_lips are you still working? Btw, how is lil Kylen?
I miss my satellite cable so frickin much! #NothingToWatch
My son's birthday was actually, great. He was happy to have his dad there, and so was I. :-)
Saturday = College Football! #RollTide
@BabyDollsTwin he is Raven!
@Bahdlikedhet LOL...I am! He only gets one birthday :)
I suppose, since it's his birthday. Love my baby!
Caden wants to have a sleepover??? Dk about that!?!?
Too bad there's no longer a #ChuckECheese in T-town!
Happy Birthday Caden, my first born! Mommy loves you more than she could ever express! #6yearsold
Cause You're just a prayer away
That You are my GOD, you've done so much for me whenever I'm in need I just fall on my knees, cause I know You will make everything ok...
Cause after all without You no other man could be saved, so while in this world I'll tell everybody..I'll tell'em...
Now that you are a very special part of me, I will let the world see you are the light shineth in me....
Uuuhh woooo, you changed my old ways LORD, you took the wrong away because You gave me the love I been searching for...
The day you came my cloudy days swept away, I knew I didn't have to search for love no more...
@dreadz_slangin Good for you, sissy! Love ya!
Behind every choice lies consequence....whether good or bad!
I'm a natural WOMAN! :-)
Y'all casket ready! Lmbo
Dang! Some of you females really be over doing it with the make-up and eye shadow...tragic!
Gotta know you're wanted too...#HunterHayes
Like every thing that's green I need u, but it's more than one and one makes two, so put aside the math and logic of it...
'Cause everthing that don't make sense about me makes sense when I'm with u....
U know I'd fall apart without u, don't know how u do what u do...
An incredible GOD deserves incredible praise!
Morning birdies! Early bird gets the worm! #GetUp
Mommies babies are back home...Yayyy! #MissedThem
And I want to live a GODLY life! GOD is a good GOD, He's a merciful GOD, and He's a forgiving GOD!
That keeps me grounded and gives me the courage to say "NO"....for my body is "the temple of GOD!
...when men come at me lying and talking a good game, saying whatever to get "whatever", it's the HOLY GHOST and her testimonies...
You see, because of her testimony and the "GOD-given" mind to listen, I don't have to make the same mistakes she made (before GOD saved her)
Her personal experiences w/life &amp; men helps me more than she realizes. Thank GOD for Sis. Barbara Davis!
Heaven knows I really appreciate the testimonies of Sis. Barbara Davis. #LivingTestimony
Listening to the radio broadcast "Joy in the Midst of the Storm" by (my pastor) Bishop Luke Edwards!

Good morning birdies! Start today on your knees giving GOD thanks for your life.
So, therefore, I'm hooked. Thanks dad! :)
Listening to The Williams Brothers CD "This is your Night". My dad always listened to their music when I was younger.
Listening to my favorite radio station @981TXT all day, everyday! Today's best country music w/ Big D &amp; Bubba!
Besides..I have my reasons. The HEART is so NOT to be played with.
O' WHATEVER! I don't care what u birdies think, you guys have NO idea what I've been through.
Does that make me a mean person?
There are like, three people I so wish didn't exist rite now...
Wait, why am I smiling? I'm NOT shopping, or getting anything.
Good morning lil birdies! It's #BlackFriday :)
@dreadz_slangin Thanks big sis! Happy Thanksgiving to you as well! Love ya!
No, not "home sick"...at home, sick! :(
So much that I'm watching it again, right now. Since I'm home sick!
So, last night was my first time watching "Sex and the City" (the movie) and I totally fell in love with it.
Although, I'm home in bed sick as can be, I'm very thankful to be in the land of the living!
Good morning lil birdies! Happy Thanksgiving!
Dear Cold, get the heck out of my life...pronto!    Sincerely, Stephanie

@1Todd_205 Hey, watch your mouth Nappy head! Lol
Man, I need to get back on my exercising.
"Home alone"...literally! :)
STOP! It's a song, by Miranda Lambert!
To those of you wrecking your brain(s) trying to figure out exactly who I'm talking about....
They say I'll be ok, but I'm not going to ever get over you...
I miss you! :(
You went away, how dare you!?
Like, a gazillion times a day.
I've like, had it up to here with these telemarketers calling here! #NoMoreMrsNice
Morning lil birdies!  Lord please don't let it be so!
Good night lil birdies!

@sista_solja Ikr! It be in my head for days.
About to wash alllllllll this hair...that'll take at least an hour and a half.
"My baby don't stand no cheating...my babe"....
Whenever I watch Cadillac Records the song Lil Walter sing remains in my head for days.
Replacing you is so easy!
So since I'm not your everything...how about I be nothing??
It's not 10:00 yet, and I'm already ready to go back to bed. #sleepy
Morning!  LORD keep my mind stayed on you!
@theviewtv Mrs. Doubtfire! #TheView
I think it's called "tention"!
That awkward moment when you're left standing w/your ex's girl and it's so quiet you can hear a pin drop....
Drink plenty of water!
This man is a complete "Bugga boo"..
@sondrabrass what's up other yellow girl? I was at mom's house Tuesday night...I was looking to see you.
Turn down one stanking dog, and here comes another ole' manger dog!
Men (some) are so predictable!
Life can be a real pain in the you know what!
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood...
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to pay more attention to the things that I need....
Good morning twitterholics!
@dreadz_slangin Lmbo...
He yells..."I woke"
Jeremiah is still up, and when I say go to sleep..
@dreadz_slangin Ain't he though!

@jametriss_fran I tried those once and didn't like'em.
So, I'm just wondering...why is Wednesday called "Hump day"??? #Inquiringmindswant2know
Morning twitterholics!
What was I thinking???? #DeirksBentley
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama, daddy had a heart like a nine time hammer, think he even did a little time in the slammer...
Beautiful Saturday morning! Listening to #JoshTurner "Time is Love" on @981TXT
Feeling good today! :) Prayed up, and ready for a glorious day!
Good morning! :)
What?? The @Lakers fired #MikeBrown ? Well, can't say, I didn't see that coming...1-4!
Morning y'all! My prayer today..."Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in YOUR sight, O' GOD!
Yayyy! My 2 year old can continue to watch Seasame Street, starring #BigBird ! Thanks #BarackObama
I voted! #VoteObama
The angels bow before Him, heaven and earth adore Him..ooooooo what a MIGHTY GOD I serve!
Ooooooo what a MIGHTY GOD I serve!
I'm voting for @BarackObama b/c he's HONEST and care about the very poor! #VoteObama
He replies, "you believe Sis. Betty and not me"...Lmbo
He immediately starts crying...Me: why are you crying??
I gets off the phone and tells Caden that he has school tomorrow.
She tells me that they is no school on Wednesday, and that Caden got it mixed up.
Him: Because the teachers have a meeting to attend. So, I calls Betty Ann to confirm that.
Caden told me, they were not having school tomorrow. Me: why?
@Mzz_sweet_lips Lmbo...girl boo!
#LiesBoysTell I love you, baby!
#LiesBoysTell I don't have a girlfriend. You're the only one!
@dreadz_slangin Ikr! You'd think it would be common courtesy, for him/her to say, that's ok, I got it!
@dreadz_slangin That sounds good, too! It's different than what I've been eating as of late.
Lesson learned...NEVER do it again!
I can NOT stress myself out over this.
Baked Chicken, Turnip greens, Candied Yams &amp; Buttermilk corn bread is what's for dinner!
How long must I wait???
RT @MagicJohnson: Was very happy to see the @Lakers get their first win!  Hopefully, this is the team we will see all season.
Gosh! Wish I could go home and go to sleep. #sleepy
I love and miss my big sis, @dreadz_slangin sooooo much!
My legs are insanely sore from exercising. #Ouch
He's been better to me, than I could EVER be to myself.
GOD's been good to me!

STOP calling me!
Good morning everyone! Have a good day!
@dreadz_slangin Yeah, I like it, too! Caden said, he look like Uncle Vincent, except his hair. Lmbo
I'm a die hard KOBE fan! It's like, I'm married to man! #WinOrLose
Oh! Did I NOT say SIKE???
If the #Lakers lose tonight, I promise I'm changing my twitter name!
Thank goodness there's now a #Ross in Tuscaloosa! #LoveIt

LORD, give me the courage to do the right thing!
What have I gotten myself into?????
Umph! He still gets to me! #SomeThingsNeverChange
I'm glad you called! It means a lot to my heart.
Perhaps if I start crying??? #SHARKtank
Let me create something, anything and go to #SHARKtank for a deal. Maybe she'll give me a deal, too???
What's the lady name on #SHARKtank ?? She freaking likes everybody.
I'm a Virgo! We don't like making mistakes.
Ah, man! I meant he's NOT quite that old.
Bring him off the bench.
Well, he's quite the old but he ain't no spring chicken anymore.
No disrespect to him and his legacy, but the man is like, 54 yrs old.
I'm starting to think it was a bad investment to sign Steve Nash.
#ThingsParentsSay you can't fool me, I've been there.
#ThingsParentsSay I've been your age.
RT @VirgoSign_: #Virgos will often say they're okay, but inside they are covering up chaotic and confused feelings.
I vow to NEVER do that again!
That was the motto of Beulah Baptist church in Monticarlo, GA.
That phrase sticks with me. I got it from Fighting Temptation.
Beware of brief delight and lasting same!
Good morning! God Isreal (is real)!
@jametriss_fran You're so pretty lady! :) And I like the hair style, too!
I've NEVER felt so alone in my life!
Morning everyone! :)
Man, I used the wrong "fill"! Should've been "feel"  Ugh!
We have a "spiritual love" that last for a lifetime!
Just to fill our hearts beating together no other way to explain 'cause...
Now every time the sun rises and the sun sets, I know anything I'll endure...
I never knew life could be so, so complete with just 1 look in your eyes...
He did so good I want to read it again. "Furthering the Good News"  Acts 8:26-39
Minister know he taught that lesson yesterday morning!
Morning folks! :)
Men!?!? I tell ya...smh
RT @VirgoSign_: #Virgos are stubborn and want the other person to make the first move all the time.
@LaSondraBrass Heyyyy, morning yella girl 2 :)
Thing is, it's totally NOT his birthday! He says that just about everyday. Kmsl
My baby said, "Mama it's my birthday, I'm so happy"...Lmbo
Good morning to you and you! Have a prosperous day!
Cadillac Records!
@sista_solja Juvenile?? That used to be my jam back when...
@sista_solja Etta James is the original singer, right? I'ma look it up on Youtube and listen to her version.
The words of the song are life to me.
So I can watch Cadillac Records again. I gotta hear Bey sing "I'd rather go blind than see you walk away from me"...
OAN: I hope my baby go to sleep at 8:00 sharp tonight.
It's comforting to assume that if I'm thinking of you, then you have to be thinking of me, too....
It's possible, but no scientific evidence of it being true..
Could it be true... if I'm thinking bout you, you're obviously thinking of me??
One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl...
Man, I'm so sleepy!!!
You didn't deserve that!
Waffle House breakfast. Yum yum!!!
Morning! :)    Have a good day y'all!
#Romnesia!!! #Debates
SHUT UP Mitt!!! So undisciplined...gosh

OMG! Carrie Ann Anaba had a "Great Fall" Len &amp; Bruno couldn't put her back together! Lmbo.. #DWTS
JESUS cares....
You see through prayer GOD strengthened me and made me strong...prayer gave me the courage to keep on keeping on...
Its been my rock, my salvation and prayer has been my shield and if it's GOD's will ain't no wounds that prayer can't heal...
Prayer has been a shoulder to lean on, prayer has been a comforter when it seemed like hope was gone...
Prayer makes the difference!
Good morning cyber freaks! LOL
Then off to bed I go.
About to watch Cadillac Records again.
@malinawalker23 Ikr! I'ma watch it again tonight. I gotta hear Bey sing that song again..smh
Bey song that song! "I'd rather go blind, than watch you walk away from me"...
It made me sad, but it was real good!
Just watched Cadillac Records...
Happy 35th Anniversary Mom &amp; Dad! Love you guys like, way too much! #BestParentsAwardRecipients
My throat's a lil scratchy...bout to make some tea, and nip that in the bud..right now!
I guess he fell in L O V E with Mary Camden (Jessica).
I know that's so sterotype, but...oh, well
Please, don't ask why. He just looks like that kind of guy.
He has always appeared to be this "pretty boy, play boy" to me.
I'm totally amazed that Justin Timberlake is getting married.
No more I, but it's CHRIST within...
I love who I am...my personna, my compassion for others and my pure heart to treat EVERYBODY right!
Good morning everyone! I'm blessed and highly favored in the LORD!
LOL...this movie NEVER gets old! #Childhoodmemories

I accept your apology...but I think it's best if we just keep it SIMPLE!

Shame on me!

Like, just tell me how you really feel. Really...
Why can't you be honest?
Never again...
@ehasselbeck That's bologna and you know it! Are you a supporter of Republicans period, or are you just hell bent on disagreeing w/Obama?
LORD open my understanding, and help me to stay awake...in JESUS name, Amen!
Time to feed the inner woman. Headed to Bible study.
Make today count! #Beproductive
Me: I'm fine! Spirits are high and smile on my face :-)
Good morning folks! How's everyone doing today?
I wanted to believe you were different.
Honestly, that was like, very disrespectful of you.
It wasn't a good idea, anyway!
You're entitled to happiness, too! (As long as it isn't at the expense of someone else's hurt)
Never mind the haters, or critics!
And, I've learned u can't help who u love. The heart wants what it want!
You live and learn!
I guess that's why I'm sleepy now?
I didn't sleep good last night!
Dang! I got it bad!
You're awesome in every way!
Morning everyone :)
I suppose it's gonna rain allllllll day! #Goodsleep
@sayruhnicole sorry about the loss of your grandfather! May GOD comfort you during this tragic time!
