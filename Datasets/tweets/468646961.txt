Disarming the citizenry is the first step to oppression and tyranny. Kids, I suggest you crack open the history book and learn this pattern. #marchforourlives
Logic of the Left: we need more gun control and regulations for law-abiding Americans and also border enforcement is mean and immigration law is just a suggestion.

Simply being anti-NRA is not a solution. March FOR something, not just against everything.
