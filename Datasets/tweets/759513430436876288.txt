@azcentral Now begin reported that schools staff allowed students to wear clothes that supported President Obama's "Hope" program but they seem to have a serious dislike for President Trump's " MAGA" program which speaks of lawsuit in big letters
@azcentral Well the facility at that school is about possible have a lawsuit troubles as to how they handle that situation by telling a student to live school with calling their parents and having it flashed all over the different social media sites real smart bunch of liberals
@zomfies Just think if someone had not used their intelligence you would not be able to use the things you use to communicate these comment or do the work which allows to make a living or have the food you eat or the clothes you wear. You would just be another nake creature eat grass
@zomfies Well the begin of life is not rare it happen everyday to all living thing and if one really looks at it it not sometime that happens by accident either just like a computer did happen accident there was intelligence behind the creation of it  just like all life
@DanSerrano2 What are you and your school board going to do if you get involved in a lawsuit over the clothing of that student you requested to live cause she display Trump 2020 on American flag as retiree of the Army I think your action toward this child has disgraced why I served
@ARLYNVM28 Well looks like the that High School might tied up in a lawsuit over this First Amendment issues which may cause that school to lose more it gain by it's action against this student choice of clothing
@helen_petracchi @realDonaldTrump Please to me all Hillary would have brought was more of Obama's type policies which made the world less safe allow countries like China and Russia to increase their military which actual increased higher possible if armed conflict
@JackPosobiec Why is Wonder Woman the only super hero movie you liked please explain or might think your a bit on the silly side
@BayerUS There is a problem with that thinking only some parts of the world is population is becoming a problem like Asia where it will probably increase 3 to 5X in the next 50yrs where place like North America nation may only increase 2X in same time
@BernieSanders Just think all the things Congress is doing to impeach Trump would not be need cause no law would be enforce cause all law would be voided by your way of thinking.
@BernieSanders Well that's sounds great but what the Justice system going to maintain law and order if there's no consequences for breaking any laws of any types which means lawbreaker would be free to do what ever they please
@KamalaHarris What your thoughts on the new Criminal Justice Reform bill sign by President Trump back in December 2018 and how will it fit in your Criminal Justice program your starting to promote with your program in your run for president.
@KamalaHarris Has not President Trump address part of that issue or has those in Congress forgot
@Amy_Siskind They said the same about Hillary on her email server problem so we're is she is seating home enjoy the political show Democrats are putting on across this country
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Well the founders never envisioned a Congress so political containment with hate for a President as the one seating Washington at this present time to the tune they are unable to govern as the founders set forth in our Constitution
@MAGAphobia Question what is that teacher teaching by that teachers action how to suppress the one of the freedoms that school are suppose to teach our children set down in our Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights not act like a dictator
@zomfies Well one person belief is another superstition. Just wonder what you call the miracle of life as to how a person comes into this world by evolution or by the product of supernatural design by a supreme intelligence which do you think it is?
@Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan Here's my take why all these bad situations are now seemly increasing if one is student of works of the Hebrew writings in the book that's called the Bible foretold of increase violence on many areas as the time in which the arrival of the one call the Antichrist leadership
@washingtonpost Critical endanger "American Identity" being done by the very people who benefited from the American principles set forward in the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
@DineshDSouza So but to me even if you put together good days on your subject there always seems to be someone who want to destroy it guess cause their jealous of someone doing better that them on that subject
@lander Yes who represent family ideas to not the liberal elitists Democrats for they are the ones who have go about destroy God origin ideal of what married is so don't use this to promote those people who think God's principles
@aimsbond_ @megsx11 See your touch so bye don't like thin skin people
@constancevaland Well from my view of liberal elitists most have a view of America wealth like it was stolen not earn is that your view?
@aimsbond_ @megsx11 Well then the joke is on you for making a joke of serious situation. Do you ever take anything serious or is everything a joke to people like you?
@constancevaland @charliekirk11 So what is your solution to this problem? Have you called your state and federal elected people to see what they are doing on this problem.
@aimsbond_ @megsx11 Good for you but how many at that party did the same say you? How old are you anyway hope over 21 .
@CMCRET Did you feel the same way with all past President's who did one those things you list wonder why you didn't express your feeling on Clinton or Bush or Obama didn't they also fail your tests why just Trump getting those remarks? As a fellow retiree all those who run make mistakes.
@PatrioticCindy @Barracuda_Bella Well all that shows that there are some feel that there is still a difference between males and females and some line such not be cross just to allow women and men compete in sports together but there's one area men can never compete with women in is getting pregnant
@KamalaHarris Well your right but on area the government has not done such a good job when it comes to healthcare in the care of those who have served since 2000 if that is an example of how one would judge the government's ability to take care of healthcare need a failing grade you get
@KamalaHarris That's a good argument but question how does one accomplish such a feat? How would one get the medical community to go along costing their charges for their services which have increased so fast they've left us all in debt paying for the expensive life style they live in
@paulkrugman What's your take on our debt increase from the 1960- 2016 years cover Kennedy thru Obama and how each President dealt with our debt by lowering or increasing it by how means and what effect it had on our economy
@paulkrugman Wonder how the debt look during 2000-2017
@khumbuh_kay @I_Am_Lebohang_ @danielmarven Well look like our use of sex again as source of harm which seem to be the down fall of many a good man and woman these days seem it becoming normal behavior in our world today.
@Thaboew_Zikhali With a pic like that are you looking for sometime else besides a job?
@charliekirk11 Person like that had been US citizen they would have been locked up for a very long time especially if the death of a person was related to DUI situation but being a illegal they seem to get a free pass which has been granted by those in Congress cause failure immigration issue
@SHODesusAndMero @Showtime Wonder how your views would identify themselves as conservative or liberal, white, black, Hispanic or just other mixed raced groups? What wage group watches your show the most?
@DavidAd13662163 Why is Ted Cruz's the most hate person? Question why did the Hispanics failed to show their voting strength being they are now the second largest minor group in our country replacing blacks which held that position for years but now are second
@charliekirk11 Don't forget all the illegal drug which are also adding to our increase drug problem we're have seen increase to level not seen in many years. All one has to look to the courts almost half those case are drug related which maen we're lossing a generation of young again so in 60's
@megsx11 Wonder who was the sober driver for those who over drink with those $18 beers or was there alot of over drinking drivers on the road from that party and did anyone get DUI going home from this event
@KamalaHarris If they have hard time paying of place to stay wonder what else they have time paying for food, car insurance, healthcare, retirement, even put their children thru higher levels of education and paying all the taxes government requires to help pay for all those government program
@cubancafecito @KamalaHarris Right but what does offer his hand of protection for all that wwish follow him and his son Jesus Christ. If one looks at the world around us one can clear see who &amp; how the US has benefited from that protect but now it is being slow withdraw due our own ignorance in last 100yrs
@mjfree @DonaldJTrumpJr Wonder which of those women will be the one that let's the next crime to happen in which someone who is not a legal citizen of the USA commits against you.
@_Kerosun_ @JerryDa45215767 @fallen2saved @Alyssa_Milano Well in the Bible unborn are not seen as a person who has been born but the is a price for cause the dead of an unborn
@michtom20 @PaulEDawson Guess your next project would be clean up all the oceans to remove all the plastic items that now fill all our waterways they say there's a island the size of Rhode Island flowing around oceans &amp; getting bigger very day due to all the garage the world dumped in it.
@Jossfjh @michtom20 @PaulEDawson Did you know there are 3X same trees in the US as when the first European set foot no the land we now call USA so question is if we've planted so many why have the rest of the world not done the same &amp; if they had that 1.2 trillion 🌲 would have already been planted.
@cubancafecito @KamalaHarris Well that must have be some really nasty reading from your comment
@JerryDa45215767 @ObamaLeaf If that is true then we're all in for a ride which many will not recover from
@MarieGuttergums @steroidpower88 @K_4Duellys @Recipes_4_Lunch What Burr got under your saddle
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Have one question would you leave your house unprotected in the same manner as you have so done with our southern border?
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Question are you so against a border wall before Trump's was elected to be President you hadvote for a border barrage what has changed ? From my point of view our southern border is one of the most unprotected part of our country which mean anyone can cross it at will.
@NRO @jackrcrowe Sounds more like "Political Hit List" makes one wonder what kind of people are we now elected to represent us and it start to make us look like one of three world situation we been hearing about over the years
@Briannk398 @ConservativeGM @LadyRedWave @RoxxxyGurL @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN Are you sure about that for the pass two years there seem to a movement to do that overthrown a elected President and who has been leading that movement the Democratic leadership located in Congress and since 2018 midterms it has got even more vocal
@KamalaHarris May be nature love won but spirit love lost and may be that's why California has be hit so hard by natural event cause God has removed his hand of protection that help make it one of the most prosperous states in our country but now is possible it due to things like that.
@maziehirono Are you refer to abortion as one the critical health care issues. Sexual issues is where the problems starts which leads to the abortion issues which leaves one important fact the unborn life which get terminated as easy as one would step on a bug.
@Lawrence @TheLastWord Guess it takes a racist to know a racist so guess that makes you a racist as well too.
@PeterSweden7 Looks like Europe is being conquered by Islam replacing Christian as the main religion of the  Europe only took it 1300yrs or so do it not by force but by complacency on the part of the Europeans
@SenTedCruz That is what everyone wants for their children but it brings up this question those we I trust to do that are they truly giving our children a good education or are they indoctrinated them into thing the American way of life is a lie
@TheUSASingers To the Democrats have their on dirty launder the biggest load is the immigration issue which they are using as a to increase voter rolls.
@TheUtopitarian Did same that what did say is belief and thinking of those group are basically similar to where there is almost no difference in those group no matter the personal makeup of those groups.
@StopBigMoney Well there many still don't think to highly of Carter for two things Iran hostage situation and the Olympics which why he didn't get his second term he ended just like Bush Sr one term President
@SenateGOP How are you Republicans going use that data to help keep the liberal Democrats from taking complete control of both house and the President position in 2020
@TheUtopitarian Sorry to me there seem to me not much difference between groups like your and our liberal think groups these days.
@JoeNBC Well how do you explain how the Democrats got around President Clinton's near impeachment over his situation with that intern or President Obama comment "You can keep your doctor" or use of IRS to go after conservative group so how did those situations get so little attention?
@Lynda_Creech May be those who are against vaccines need to look back before vaccines be came standard part of growing up as to how many children died due to disease. The first use on bio weapon used against Native Americans was blankets contaminated with smallpox witch wipe whole villages.
@PhilippeReines @katydogcrazy Didn't an black woman use old white man to make the whole political system to be a bit racist
@TheUtopitarian So you must be one of those liberal socialist person which means a new Democrat with a new covering one must remember what the old original Southern Democrats look like.
@NBCNews Now if one could say that about Transgender males but that not true cause transgender male do not possess the necessary body strength to over come the normal male cause basically they are still physically a female which is the same for transgender female which basically males
@ChrisMurphyCT Question how is that going to stop all the gun violence in places like Detroit, Chicago or Los Angeles where most of gun violence is due by illegal obtained guns. So how is background checks help stop that type of gun violence?
@JacksonLeeTX18 @RepAOC If that what you call a hearing hate to see what your legislative work looks like on immigration from my point of view it sucks.
@TheUtopitarian Really that's not what was said on video

@AngrierWHStaff @pebbles9010 Not with that testimony he gave to Congress today it was all talk no meat on the grill just a bunch of hot air
@TheUtopitarian @JackPosobiec @AOC Question how would you have handle this situation if it had happen to you?
@TheUtopitarian What this video shows how one can be accused of activities which turned out to be done by someone else
@marinamaral2 Sad to read about such people but the only way to end such evil was man had to use deadly force to bring such evil to end which sorry to say has raised it's ugly head all through human history
@SVCCork @DonnaIsGod Question is how, when and why how it happen if one looks at what's written in the books of the Bible our Creator put women u see men but men were to treat women as weaker vessel and respect so how did that get corrupted
@Ms_Survivor_ Do you think this type only happen in this culture what other cultures let's say the Islamist one where women are treated or thought or valued less than equal to the males in that culture.
@JamieLeeOD @AndyFarnham May be there is a need to find a to delay sexual activity which is the main reason for the need of abortion but as long as there be sexual activity between males and females the possible of abortion will always be present
@emeraldbonzo @eoinyk What about the Scots?
@eoinyk @reido82 Well to have a good education system it has to be a honest view of the events that made history but have a civilation which it's citizens can help make a great one education is important part of that civilation

@NYMag Guess the old tale is true never get on the wrong side of a spoiled bunch of brats.
@SanfordBishop @POTUS Well you must know the laws very well if you did you know the law passed back in 1976 by Congress does give the President the authorization to declare an national emergency also gives him authority to use military funding as well as civil defense funds which you should have known
@superdishrag @KamalaHarris Yes if their born on US soil but addition to that they have dual citizenship which they have to declare which country they wish belong to at 18.
@trusthistruth @StormIsUponUs Are not leaving Jesus Christ out of you equation for he standin as God's High Priest as one who listen to our prayers which he in turn present to God
@StormIsUponUs Well one needs not worry about those who think that way for it's all record in one's book of Life which our Creator uses to decide who may enter his kingdom and who join Satan in the lake of Fire
@SenWarren @SenateGOP Who is looking out for the rights of the unborn child  who seem to left out of the equation. Cause these unborn are the replacement for people like you have you thought about it along those lines of thinking.
@RWPUSA How do you keep guns out of the hands of those who get gun thru illegal sources which background checks which only effect those who follow the law but there still problems in that are cause background data banks is limited to states not a general nationwide data bank
@AOC What do you consider a living wage $16,000; $18,000; $20,000; $24,000; $26,000; $28,000; $30,000; $35,000; $40,000; $45,000; $50,000; $65,000; $75,000; $80,000; $85,000; $90,000; $100,000 or $180,000 which is what  freshman Congress make?
@KamalaHarris One must remember where the funds have to come from to pay teachers the tax payer. How can the state limit classroom size as more illegal children are allowed to come in to your state and there seem to be a decrease in the number of person who chose to not go into teaching.
@tinabobuk With this video one could justify ban on all alcohol as they back on 1919

@poeticcjabs How do one explain why there is a grave here on Earth which contains the body of the prophet of Islam but the is no grave which contains the body of Jesus Christ
@KamalaHarris So you will stand by while that country falls to the same type controls that happen in Cuba but it was an island waterlimited spread of it's type of socialist agenda but Venezuela is not so it's socialist agenda will spread with your type of help
@JillWineBanks Well what would the Democrats look like ?
@TomiLahren Well as long as those who have liberal ideas which promote their agenda illegal persons who commit serious crimes and are allowed to live freely in our country these type of situations will always be present in our news cycles
@Cernovich @marcorubio Question how many Venezuelans will you be willing to take in while allow that country falls apart being taken over by Russian and Chinese which allows them to control that countries it's mineral resources
@KamalaHarris There be no need to jail anyone but till people stop committing crime and have laws which require enforcement of law as you should know
@DineshDSouza @bnutzman2 Well is that not also what kids are being taught in colleges now how to bashes conservative values replace them with liberal values like removing freedom of speech if one is on the wrong side of an argument.
@bnutzman2 No it's the biggest night for elitists liberals to show off their wealth and liberal bashing our American values which gave them the privilege to bash it.
@KamalaHarris You talk about fear of gun violence but one thing that is left out is fear of bulling in schools today which happens more often than is reported how easy cyber bulling is going on right under everyone nose just look at what happen to that high school kid cause he wore a cap
@KamalaHarris Question how do you protect the rights of the unborn if you choose to allow women the right to terminate the unborn who seem to have no rights. It strange how we treat unborn who are future person who replace people like you how easily we terminate the unborn why is that?
@tictoc Why is not Texas part of this sue being it has biggest part of it southern border makes more half of our southern border with Mexico which means they have the biggest stake in the border issue
@KamalaHarris Question if every child was given a college level education who would we get to maintain trades person need to maintain basic areas need to maintain basic operation systems like electricians, welders, carpenters, bricklayers &amp; many others who keep our basics system going.
@KamalaHarris Question who will be paying for this Medicare for all program you are suggesting and how would you regulate the healthcare professional who be require to supply the healthcare services?
@TIME Question how did the judge determine that person citizenship and what about the other twin ?
@SenWarren @RepCummings What stop it from getting into our civilation in the first place
@RepLeeZeldin Question what kind of violence would you except?
@JoeNBC Well it has also been use by our own country in our past history even before we became a country so may be you need to review our own use of that same term
@KamalaHarris How do you see what is happening in our own system which does the same thing to children who belong US citizens so how is illegal are more important than our countries own children can you explain such a disconnected between the two
@charliekirk11 Guess freedom of speech is first to go on college campus is one is one the wrong side of the argument
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump To me anyone who uses racism for any reason needs to receive full weight of the law to help insure other are persuaded to not use it again to avoid cloud when racism is real crime not a fake crime
@KamalaHarris How are going to set those things up for farmer workers who work in fields up to twelve hours a day during picking season which most average Americans seem to avoid those type of jobs
@charliekirk11 @TPUSA Well from the video looks like the guy in the coat pick the wrong guy to get in his face the way he did it was like pick on a rattle snake and the guy in the coat got bite
@Comey Bad thing l see with today's press is lack real jouralist intergret and corruption of how stories are reported
Let’s be mateys: https://t.co/3EuzBBgTt6
@KamalaHarris What happen to all about that $787 Billion Obama had for that same purpose and it was said shovel ready jobs were ready to go all was need was funding which was done in tune of $787 Billion
@KamalaHarris Question how do is it a person in position can talk on moral issues when you yourself had what someone would say was immoral relationship with a man who was married. How do you deal with it ?
@KamalaHarris Well is women and men took the time to think about what would happens after a sexual encounter abortion might not be need. One thing all forgets is when a woman be comes pregnant it's a miracle which is how all need not forget for without it none of us would be here.
@KamalaHarris Why is it people like put illegal ahead of US citizens? Why is it so important not to protect our southern border from those who illegal enter our country and stop flow of drugs and trafficking of humans across our southern border
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP As for Pelosi she looks like old lady who seems to be have attitude problem which seem to be common with older women who have become like men who hold similar position
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP Well one thing they don't do was provide request funding for border wall which is partly why shutdown happen in the first place
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump How you talk about Trump when Pelosi is about to give $3Billion to illegals but no money to protect our country and from those who chose to enter our country illegal. So who does Congressional Democrats really care about?
@KamalaHarris How can you wish that if some in your party wish to tax someone who wish improve financial status
@ChrisVanHollen But those who belong to the public media are the ones who are destroying the very media which they use the to attack President Trump with and turn around say President is destroying it very for doing same thing hypocrisies
@washingtonpost The question should be where how and where to depose the disassemble parts
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP Don't bet on that
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP No it takes two to tango
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP Well if Pelosi continue at this rate by time we get to 2020 one will wonder how often will Pelosi kept shutdown the government
@mikegotter @DanyLaplante1 @GOP Well if no funds could mean prepare for another government shutdown
@DanyLaplante1 @ida_skibenes The God you speak of is the one who made the first modern human from which you were made and he is God of all modern humans
@DanyLaplante1 @GOP Guess Captain Hook Pelosi and her gang of cut throat pirates can be trust to protect it's like having hyena to protect a hen house
@kylegriffin1 Well to me Pelosi and her gang have trust issues as well being Pelosi husband close business ties with Chinese
@JoeNBC I think Pelosi and her gang may have very close connection to the Chinese since her husband has very close ties with Chinese and has benefit from her being elected to Congress back in 1993
@ida_skibenes Same sex marriage is natural humans way of opposition to God's natural order in doing so it well bring chaotic results
@MSNBC Well did Obama is do the same thing but different was your media celebrate those events WHY?
@GOP Well where has been your party been in all this support Democrats by sitting on your hands just look at the mess we have now your party could have prevent this but cause you didn't like Trump Pelosi and her gang rule now which seem to make lot of your people happy
@AP It might be the first true thing Putin is been truthfully about since he has been in charge of Russian government
@bellewriter @RepLeeZeldin @ShirTruth Well that book has provide how wrong one person view of the future can be provide so wrong while another view provide to be more accurate as those found in books of the Holy Bible
@DLoesch Well you can call the Democratic party a "Death Party " as well on their new push on full term abortion up just before birth
@kylegriffin1 Question is how much influence does the Chinese have with Pelosi and those in her circle?
@funder Well that arrest was bit over the top wonder how you would feel if it happen to you in a similar manner
@JimNorton What honorable path did he follow?
@KamalaHarris Domestic violence is not limited to just women as victim but also abusers so don't limit this law enforcement to women only
@KamalaHarris Real is that how you justify how California has develop such bad budget problem
@MemoirScribe @paulaptlb @SenFeinstein Guess you agree with power hungry Pelosi.
@caindenises @SenFeinstein Well Pelosi &amp; her party also miscalculated as well at least someone was thinking about put people back to work which turned out to be Trump not Pelosi who seem to be on a power trip at her newsbreifing
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross Well Sen Warren tax plan sounds good but even with wealthy taxpayers it will not take care of the necessary funds to cover the program needed by the government.
@KamalaHarris You will be the first person born to parents who were not US citizens at the time of your birth
@SenWarren Well now federal workers know how other workers feel when those private companies shutdown do to funding problems. So now you &amp; your fellow Congress members have experience what normal working class people have to put up with when funds disappear
@SenWarren Wonder how many wealthy Democrats will be effected by your tax plan?
@thehill @TheHillOpinion To me this whole Mueller investigation has  turned into one big political show with the Democrats lead party
@realDonaldTrump If you let Pelosi pull another ironpant situation which she is making everyone think made you back down
@ManInTheHoody Your one sick crazy liberal thinking people if you lived in China or Russia guess where you be if put same type picture
@washingtonpost Well we will see if this woman can agree on anything from this old mans view that woman is about to run into a wall
@CREWcrew Question like that brings up other questions like why was the DNC not investigated for their activities during 2016 election &amp; why they didn't allow the DOJ to investigate the hacking into their computers? Why Mueller investigation did include DNC hacking by Russian?
@sasha4th The US has policies in place to insure safety of all parties. We don't want the same type of situation as in Europe where safety policies where ignored &amp; violence happen. Do you agree safety for all parties is your number one concern or not?
@KamalaHarris Why don't you donate 90pct of your salary to that cause &amp; get DNC to set up a fund for those people. Don't DNC have a lot of wealth donors
@tictoc Are you that bias to make up a situation like what you describe

@Amy_Siskind That brings up a big question does the Russia have the ability to produce those type of farm produce? The old USSR had a very hard time properly manage &amp; produce enough farm product so what has changed in that area since 1989
@Mar_maemae @MarshallCohen Yes what are they doing you might as well look at what the liberal Democrats are doing as well just look at the two new female Muslim elected to the House did when they were elected as to who they seem to show loyalty to it was not to the US but to Islamic groups
@bbusa617 The only way the Democrats can abolish Electoral College is they would have to have Constitutional Convention for a amend change the Constitution which would be difficult in this day and age
@Bold_To_Pray @bbusa617 Well don't forget the others important walls like the Great Wall in China or the Roman Wall which was built in England so walls have been used to protect nations, empires and cities full of people
@Vol2thaBone @bbusa617 @StromMrs Well the heavenly city of Jerusalem is a walled city built by God which he will place on this world for those founded in the book of life

@MarshallCohen You ever seen the two movies "Red Dawn" in those movies show how easily our country defense were over come by outside forces using the thing which you say could happen but did in those movies. Just look at what Russia did to Ukraine so it could happen if we don't keep our guard
@SenatorRomney The one thing you need to look into what women like her where does her loyalties lay wi the principle laid out in our Constitution or does her loyalties lay somewhere else and if they are she may be likely to betray our country based on those other loyalties
@PeterSweden7 One thing those in our modern world have to come to deal with is some of the Islamic belief have one thing on their mind is to do everything within their ability to make Islam the only religious belief UN the world by eliminating all other religious system's &amp; people using them
@DeplorableWench @Rosko311 @vmbb12 @mimiinftworth @FBI @RashidaTlaib May be the FBI,might need to look into how close is she to that group since as part of her being part of this government required to raise her hand to swear allege to the Constitution. So why would she wear a pin with a flag of another country &amp; not our flag
@tdfellrath Well we need someone to take a stand on this immgrantion issue which the present group in Washington keep ignore or push the illegal and border security issue down the road for the last 40plusyrs
@katehayden11 @MonkeyUas @LynnWoodSpeaks @KamalaHarris @BlueTsuni @sharicedavids @Deb4CongressNM Well guess all we need to run our country is bunch of dog so replace all of Congress with dog like you said a dog can do a better running our country

@WillowLWretling @MonkeyUas @LynnWoodSpeaks @KamalaHarris @BlueTsuni @sharicedavids @Deb4CongressNM Question where did you get the truth you believe from the liberal media like NBC or similar media
@WillowLWretling @MonkeyUas @LynnWoodSpeaks @KamalaHarris @BlueTsuni @sharicedavids @Deb4CongressNM Well is that not a dream of all Americans just like the dream which was fill for black American of have a black President which Obama fulfilled
@nesiemom @Amy_Siskind No there is a problem with those who came here illegal and have lived in this country for years without any attempt to become legal citizens of this country which created the problem with children both legal &amp; illegal so that is a big problem Democrats ignore this problem
@siouxsiespal Do you think the DOD or the Secret Service just throw a true IP like that without preplanning if you don't then your living in dream reality
@siouxsiespal And who would be those better leaders who speak about
@SuzanneMoyers @ndrew_lawrence @TuckerCarlson Well as women catch up with men so does their increase in health problems like,men and the life span beginnings to be the same as men so women will be equal in all things but those which God set,in place
@jsbishop1 @MyraWeeks13 @WhiteHouse Yes what kind of country will it be if its one has open borders which givens no regard to have anyone apply to be a true American citizen just another belong to a nonAmerican
@Amy_Siskind Well why are you so upset now this immgrantion problem has been ignored by Democrats guess that's Ok with you how the Democrats have ignore ed this problem
@tdfellrath Your problem right but as long as the Democrats continue tu n down the President request for funding for a wall the government will continue to be shut down
@tdfellrath @RepBalderson That funding does not cover border security or does nothing to fix the immgrantion problem has been ignored by Congress but now we have a President who has said the buck stop here and last time someone said that was Truman
@JonLionFineArt @NancyPelosi Yes the Democrats have majority in the House but the Senate has you reply that any bill not having funding for the wall Trump has requested the Senate will not consider any funding bill the House might send them so as long that continues there will continue be a shutdown

@WI_ameyro @PeterSweden7 Well the Sweden of that time was nothing like the Sweden of modern time for the sword ruled during that time today social logic seem to rule which has open the door to these type of crime sad how they have forgotten the Vikings past
@BruceTominello @JackPosobiec May be you are marginalize him remember was a Governor so he has some polical skills so don't underestimated his abilities
@LynnWoodSpeaks @KamalaHarris @BlueTsuni @sharicedavids @Deb4CongressNM Big question do they have the same wisdom of those grandmothers
@PeterSweden7 To me the biggest problem he may face is corruption due to miss use of political influence which have been inplace for past 14yrs which will have to be dealt with before the government can function properly to help its people
@mchooyah What change their speaking out against Trump which is not good for their careers if one knows who authorizes their promotion or demotion the President
@PeterSweden7 Makes one wonder where the main media of Sweden is on this situation or may be the Swedish government has put a lid on this situation
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees Why are you not try to secure a southern border. Why you making it so easy to become American
@darlingjules With language you use it makes me wonder who raised you to speak that way and you single digit IQ you display in you tweeter pic is nice
@psychfacts_com Brings up the question as to why would women of the world would need to seek men outside of the culture they were raised up in once that question answered then you'll know
@realDonaldTrump May be you need to cool the comments some that comment is a bit heavy on it's tone may be you need to read the Book of Job now that some heavy reading
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If your not sure of that conclusion just remember what Obama said this country is nolonge Christian just the tip of the Islamic spear
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The ISIS issue,may be over but the underlining problem is still there radical Islamic has not changed it view on their objective only how they get it done it seem their purse a takeover of Europe by replace Christian religion with Islam &amp; at a slower pace in this country as well
@RevDrBarber Systemic racism there's two way of looking at that the normal view of black, white &amp; other race issuse. Then the white only issue so both are being used in the environment we live in today so which do you promote
@CoffeeBuffalo @RevDrBarber So what would you call what Democrats been doing the nuclear winter option
@ramalan7987 @RevDrBarber Well then what would we have a third world mess would we
@EileenSoffer @RevDrBarber Well history may not judge the Democrat leadership any better as to how they've reacted to the man elected in 2016
@karen_eggleson @RevDrBarber Some what kind of tactics are the Democrats using to push their message hate and fear if one man who was elected by the system which has been working for over 250 yrs so what makes them any better
@RevDrBarber Is not the job of President to speak &amp; try to do thing to help fix those problems areas which you just listed. Insure legal voting by legal residents, insure legal entrance into this country as protect our border and get a health care system all access at a reasonable price
@JoyceWhiteVance Then who is there to blame for are inability to secure are southern border this days since there seem to be only two parties who that that responsible falls the President and Congress. One party wants to do something about it the other seem to be vary reluctant to help
@MSNBC What was the criteria for anyone to be selected for such a position and who were the other persons who were in the world running for that position too.
@dsam4a Well that means eliminating the health insurance companies do you think those large insurance companies are going to side by and allow that to happen without a fight or how medical professional will want to take a big pay cut or medical companies. So how does those fit in
@KamalaHarris Thought that was what the Affordable Health Care law to do if that law did get the job done. How are Congress going write a law which does give health care to all funding it &amp; getting health community to except it &amp; then make it work like a well oiled machine
@charliekirk11 One more thing ask your self why did the Soviet put up the wall we call the Iron Curtain
@charliekirk11 Remember walls have been put up all thrust history the Great Wall of China, the Iron Curtain,  Roman wall of northern England so putting up a wall to keep out unwanted persons is nothing new just how we look at who tho e unwanted are
@kristy571111 @BernieSanders Your solution is pretty wild. So what's your idea on fixing other problem our country have like fix infrastructures problems we have &amp; improve failing education system or even a health care system which seem has out of control cost
@BernieSanders You bring up Affordable health care for everyone fine but how can it be done? How to fund such a thing and how are you going to get the health community to go along with it. The Affordable Health Care law that was passed failed question why did it fail?
@KamalaHarris Brings up the question on how is such a system will be funded and how will one get the medical community except such a operating health care system
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout To me you have know real idea of what God stands for you have only a worldly view of him know nothing of the spirit view so in you is a worldly ignorance which most of the world sees sad
@washingtonpost One must from remember the Coast Guard is part of the Treasury even though they are closely associated with Navy due to the type of mission they do and are closely link to Homeland Security due to their mission to protect all sea and waterlanes associated with our country
@King_nando @tricke1113 @KamalaHarris @SRuhle As modern humans we have one thing the rest of the animal kingdom does not have is freedom of will to chose which path we can follow
@LapuzzaBill Right anytime a person trays to change gender to me it would cause problems cause their telling their body to change from one gender to another but their DNA is having hard time except the change which seem to cause body chemistry to react very crazy
@bbusa617 For that person blowup like that seem to show that persons body chemistry is out of sync with normal body chemistry
@SenatorCollins So what pay system is the Coast Guard under?
@northeasthiker @JoeNBC Well would be anything different to some of the things that Obama did during his time in office have forgotten what happen after he help take out Libya dictator how that country collapse into chaos and no one spoke out about that so why speak about what Trump is doing
@NightlyPolitics Well it is not the only organization possibly disappear the Boy Scouts of America after what happen with increase pressure to allow those of the opposite sex want to be identified as males question how will the Girls Scout of America after those of opposite sex identify as female
@ForeignAffairs Who in your staff thinks about the two or three threats the US faces in this world one coming from China and the other from Russia both are expanding militarily and economically the other is dealing with radical religious zealots of the Islamic religion
@SRuhle Could be any worse that Hillary thinking her private server was secure from hacking
@tricke1113 @KamalaHarris @SRuhle Question is as women continue to change away from the old models to new ones leave a bigger question to be answered what will happen to the family as women &amp; men no longer seem to hold to what the old definition of what is a family now
@KamalaHarris Guess our immigration system looks like a health care system the higher up the food chain one is the better care in gets
@KamalaHarris So what is your family history look like a fruit cake made from many different ingredients
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout Would you say a say the laws which govern our universe is imperfect or perfect
@IngridIngwah Like to know what kind of ethics does a anthiest use in their life and how they differ from let s say those of those used from the Bible used by Christians
@JonahNRO Well one thing about Trump is at his age of 70 and doing the work he is doing show something that many persons half his age would not be able to keep up with him he probable put even you to shame
@realDonaldTrump Dear sir you need to remember in the early days of country our military was use to protect those who settled this country now it's used to protect our interest in this world which now draw us into foreign places which bring hostile action which we use the military prevent that
@Newsweek She needs to go back the story in the Bible for Jesus was not a refugee as how we define one in today's standards my suggest to this lady is her understanding of Jesus is faulted and she need more study of that story
@NBCNews Wonder how many of those who are white that work for network are shamed of their white heritage and the roots from which they came from sad state when one is shame in such a manner
@Newsweek Know you media reports negative things about Trump but what the thing that have been passed by Congress which you have not been reported on is there any good thing coming out of this last two year
@KamalaHarris Your worried about this immigrant boy but how many children within your own state have died how do you acknowledge their deaths
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout To me you have failed to understand that humans were perfect but cause we have free will we made bad decisions which brought imperfection into the world which is sin so God is still perfect it's just due to free will his creation became imperfect is my understanding
@KamalaHarris Where is Congress on this mix? Isn't responsible for anything or you just ignore of your responsibility the health and welfare of the citizens who elected you and your fellow Congressional members
@IngridIngwah Still awaiting for the reading material you said READ
@minnman47 Well there's one p oblem with that layoff is Congress are not feed Al employees like 99percent of the government they are elected which mean they can not be layed off
@M2McAdo Well be waiting to see what that response will be
@IngridIngwah Read what?
@ugaswimmerbr1 Thought all humans had the same mental capacity so how does one talk down to someone of equal mental capacity
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout Well forget he gave humans one thing he did give to his other creations was freedom of will to chose so humans can chose which path to follow to the darkness or o the light
@JackPosobiec Funny how such a group wants to tie themselves to that group and why that group decide those people fall or associate with
@StevenBeschloss Well there probably just as many wish for the things that got Trump elected for so we'll have to see who gets the Christmas wishes get granted in the new year
@BrittPonset @M2McAdo @bbusa617 Guess it's true one man lie is another man truth
@MonRiverRat @KamalaHarris What not include the Post Office employee to no Christmas gift or mail how would that set for you
@realDonaldTrump That does not solve the original problem created which formed ISIS is the same thing that formed Islam as a religion so bring your troops home is good but does not solve the long term radical Islamic problem which will rise it's ugly head sometime in the near future
@KamalaHarris Guess you parties opposition to Trumps wall has done more than just shutdown the government well done
@GavinNewsom The embarrassment is those of our government inabilities to correct a problem that has been with us for over 60yrs which liberals use to justify their policies as did the Obama administration did with his EO on DOCA
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump How are you and the Congressional Democrats going to protect the Southern Border to prevent illegal entrance across that border
@kylegriffin1 Well looks like the Democrats may have a problem use they ca override the veto the President do since he is part of the legislative process
@wesley_jordan How is it living in a state with LDS
@ugaswimmerbr1 I don't think people like you really know what truly happen during those time
@TrinityResists @tngsmama Well as an independent I vote for Trump cause to me he was the better of the two even after all the thing said about him even today he is still doing what he promised during the election from all who came before his the first actual do what he promised
@brycetache How do you to your son about his mother why he has two dads
@A__Stout Well don't you read some kind of a book to learn how to be an atheist or is just come to one natural
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout That sound alot like when parents tell their young children not to do something but they don't understand why they should do it sounds alot like your comment don't make much sense
@washingtonpost As one of the most liberal publication in our country who needs enemies which people like you publishing thing like this article makes one wonder if your not work for Putin personnel which you keep say Trump is question is when did you become Putin proxy
@IngridIngwah What kind of ethics is ones without gods
@KamalaHarris Well question is who's job is it to get respondable immgrantion Congress or the President
@Stanford @LDH_ed Then how would one know what children have learned
@KamalaHarris At least someone take responsibility for this shuurdown since no one else in Congress wants to take on that responsibility
@realDonaldTrump What is your objective to keep the radical Islamic fundamentals at bay after leaving Syria &amp; Afghanistan
@KamalaHarris Guess you vote for the protection of illegal over the protection of the citizens who sworn to protect
@bbusa617 Know what's sad is that one President uses an EO to expand protections for illegal then another tries to remove those protection guess who said his EO can not override that EO the Supreme Court question is why have the Supreme Court can over both Executive &amp; Legislative branches
@A__Stout @The_DoctorV Setup is that what you say when you get catch doing something
@The_DoctorV @A__Stout Well if one of Eads the story Eve knew she was not to take of that tree so in some way she did know that if she took of that tree there would be will be consequences
@A__Stout Well the tale of evolution is just that there's no evidence to backup that theory
@A__Stout There are many thing which are invisible so how you deal with those unseen to our make eye
@A__Stout @The_DoctorV No he said banned them from the tree of knowledge of good and evil he told them if they took of the the tree they would surely die. There's always a down size do to obeying like if one knows it's bad to go over the speed limit
@A__Stout No did say the earth was 6000yrs old that modern man has been around 6000yrs
@OkigboXL Well if you at a traffic light that long it means trouble like obstruction or blocking traffic that means a traffic ticket in the mail cause these day smile your on traffic cam
@Spence90481167 @ABC Well from the looks of that pic you ladies are looking for something just wonder what that would be &amp; from those look your give says it all
@A__Stout @The_DoctorV The original sin was an act of disobedience being talk not do something then ignore the warning of what would happen of disobey. A simple act of taking a fruit from a tree brought sin into the world.
@A__Stout Well may be it's you who need it wake up to what's happen in this world for our world has been slow to develop over last 6000yrs but now has been double it's development ever 300 yrs but now that process increased 1000X in last 100yrs why Bible explain the why check it out
@A__Stout I understand but it's you &amp; people like you who twist scientific theory's to match how you see the world from a worldly point of view not a spiritual one
@A__Stout Sad how people like you really know berry little what's written in the Hebrew books which make up the Bible for those books have a large source of scientific source info if one know what one is looking for. Now Proverbs 1:7 explain how I see your lack of understanding.
@socialistal @ellievan65 No it idiots like you who think your saving them animals but if you were living in a wilderness place as early settlers it might be you who would be the diner for some wild beast
@ABC Another thing is how people act over a last but no one got treated the way that kid did cause his last name was the same as a disliked President remember Nixon &amp; Clinton were dislike but no one with those last name received the treatment that kid did
@ABC Sad he did that cause he has dishonored his father family it would have taken more courage to keep his last name but he chose the easy way out
@KamalaHarris Well shutdown the government has become a standard practice for almost 40yrs soshould you in Congress getting use to it by now
@Sparklefark @ellievan65 Well in the wild game most game killed is food but when it comes to predators it not for food but for control cause to many can become a problem which can only be controlled by hunting to being those population to a level allows balance just look at coycote populations
@A__Stout @The_DoctorV Do you know what the original sin was or even what is the true meaning of sin
@socialistal @ellievan65 Boy to me you need to study why humans started hunting in the first place but the hunting some in this country is very controlled. It is done to help control population of the various wild game we have in this country so the pic you show were of controlled licenses hunts
@A__Stout Evolution is just a theory for science has no concrete evidence to back up their theory cause their always missing one item to link modern humans to those creatures scientists say modern humans evolution from
@A__Stout Well God did it too give humanity a second chance and also to fulfill the prophecy of Jesus Christ so now you know why God didn't totally wipe all of those who inhibited in the land one more thing he did save those of the seas also
@A__Stout Well me religion is manmade but those who worship God thrust faith of Jesus Christ await to see Jesus's return to the return the Earthly kingdom back to his father control
@tabora_X @BernieSanders Well they also like the money but that's why they try to avoid people who are covered by government health insurances cause they limit how much they can charge clients for their services
@Lawrence Here's a thought for you to think may be God put Trump in as President to see whelter we would stand up to the principle he gave to the men he help who founded this country on or have we just forsaken those principle for something less
@Lawrence Boy that is alot of investigation but question why does he so bring out that kind of dislike of one person can say Nixon or Clinton never got that kind of treatment explain why Trump and now not before?
@ellievan65 Don't think you know every little about how those hunt help maintain a balance with our wild animal population for without them probably all we have today would be gone like mean we only have pictures of today so educate yourself on this subject clearly your education is lacking
@Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump Well he is still standing wonder how would stand up to so many failures? The one thing about Trump even with all those failures he was still able to keep a positive,attitude which help him come out on top even in this environment could you have done better
@SebGorka Well one day that statement may be more true than fiction for in the Bible Jesus Christ will do just that take the wheel then all who believe in him will be sitting in the seats right behind him. Question is will you be one of his riders or one of those looking from the sidewalk
@KamalaHarris Question why are you not showing how all women fair no matter the race and show how their economic levels effects their care in this area instead of a blanket statement like the one just gave. To me that does give all the facts only half truths
@quickwitter @KamalaHarris Well you seem to believe the Democrats are the white knight to the rescue but from what I saw at the hearing for the Supreme Court nominee it seem more like the Democrats were the ones undermining the democratic process accusing someone with evidence with no backbone to it
@KamalaHarris Does that mean the e use of abortion as a means to control population which also denies the unborn the right to live or is it one of those argument that cause their a nonliving person yet part of your argument
@KamalaHarris No the Republicans only uncovered that the Affordable Health Care law had too many problems and if it was a good law it would have stand up to the test but it didn't is why it came apart like it did
@DeepStateExpose If you actual know history the crusades didn't happen till 400yrs after Islam came onto the world and it started spreading by it Islamic armies conquest for first crusade happen around 1000AD &amp; Islam begin around 632AD
@ProudResister Well those two item are good from a woman if she want to attract sure type of men and yes your not that type by your comment
@SenWarren Well it was the courts said the mandated part of the law was legal &amp; said it was legal cause it was a tax &amp; when the mandated was of removed the whole law came a part so in a nut shell the law fell apart cause it was poorly put together in the first place
@hatchell_andrew @KamalaHarris There is a bigger problem where the countries of North, Central and South America need to deal with the ideareason this people have chosen to put themselves &amp; their children in which has lead to many deaths like this little girl
@KamalaHarris From the comments she made they were the shade of the truth of a situation which you and your members of Congress have failed to probable dealt with for over 60yrs always pushing this problem on to the next Congress question why have you people not the back bone for this issue
@authorpholloway @terrymtb55 @msallison @hatchell_andrew @KamalaHarris Well if anyone is to be blamed for this situation it is Congress for it is their responsible to make the laws which are used by our law enforcement to protect our nation from threats no matter who or what they are they don't have the luxury to completely ignore any law
@BernieSanders Now how will you get the medical community to go along with your idea &amp; another problem is funding this programs &amp; getting the regulation in place to control cost on all health care medicine to service which is where the hangup fall
@KamalaHarris Well looks like your state has a serious problem insure the farm produce is free of infection bacteria wonder were you aware of this problem which could cripple California farming ability to sell their produce within &amp; outside their state
@MDeeIsTooShort @triay_steve @VondaHanner @rising_serpent Guess the state of California has a serious issues with their ability to inspect farm produces to insure that type of infection is not present
@Johnson562SJ @rising_serpent Look like you got the idea for the figure from the movie the "Gangs of New York"
@perlmutations By doing then at all those that came before and after will be under investigation for the smallest infraction
@adamchewning Well guess nature can be more horrifying than anything humans can ever create
@adamchewning @agordonstudio @MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @THR Well as for us modern humans we've been on this world compare to those creatures just a blink of an eye
@agordonstudio @MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @THR Well even the Native Americans are immigrants for just came earlier
@cnni The weapon which people use today is the smart phone as one see here it was used against a person for what purpose to embarrass to maybe for me that person to drop out of the contest or to embarrass the country from which that person come from or to destroy the contest
@NBCNews Well after the assault on the Boy Scout by same sex and transgender person women have progressived very fast in the last 20yrs new women out number men in the higher education at almost ever level but women say they are still at disadvantage. The question is when will feel equal
@BettyeAnn1 @Hugh2D2 Well the WWII veterans were more welcomed back into the homefront the best of all those who fought in modern times for both my parents were WWII vets my father was combat member of bomber in China my mother WAC of the Army of the Pacific
@ChuckCallesto Wonder why the liberals didn't target the Girl Scouts as the did the Boy Scouts it seem their objective was to destroy any organizations that associated with male only building question why
@Stanford Wonder what she would say about all this argument about the problem with sexual identify of transgender, neutral gender, same sex and the assault on heterosexual identity
@GOPChairwoman Well you point out their faults and the outside points out your parties fault but to me both have failed to do the job which they were elected to perform that is why immgrantion is so screwed up &amp; both argue about it like a bunch 2yrolds
@mehworth @GOPChairwoman Why don't you apply that to the Democrat leadership of Congress
@John92553103 @GOPChairwoman Answer is no based on how the Constitution lays out the powers delegated to the states and the federal
@mikedrake178 @GOPChairwoman @GOP @SpeakerRyan Why do you think those of the Democratic party are so clean in these situations
@melodyacox @KristinKarnitz @GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed You speak of one child wonder how many other children didn't make as far as this one. Wonder how many children are in the same situation who live in this country have you been thought about children of this country?
@AnitaCreamer @GOPChairwoman Where's the evidence to backup that statement
@SenWarren @usedgov @BetsyDeVosED How was it you were unable to get the Obama administration to work on this problem
@SenWarren @usedgov @BetsyDeVosED Is not all higher education institutions but also education for profit
@funder May be you need to ask your self why did our creator put what happen in the garden of Eden on the man not the woman
@Mtbkgrl @SenatorLeahy What I'm doing viewing comments then reply to them my question back to you what are you doing
@1776Stonewall Well looks like the thing to help the male like how to be a male is no long what the liberal wants they seem to want a male to identify not as a male to be neutral gender
@Mtbkgrl @SenatorLeahy Appease don't make fun of the name for you your resume is has some strange listings
@JacquelynGill Question what do you think will happen as the the colder waters of the two polar regions meet the warmer waters of the equator regions will it cause a warmering or a cooling effect
@CarolynMcCrani3 @KamalaHarris May be just think get rid of all the motor vehicle go back horse &amp; buggy stop using electricity go back to what we used before electricity to light, heat &amp; cool as well as refrigerate &amp; cook food you like those days back to wood burning cooking &amp; heating just no cooling in summer
@missionhillman @RCTILJH @KamalaHarris Well if they did stop drilling how much are you willing to pay for the fuel you need to power your motor vehicle or for the food you put on your table or the clothes you wear or even the electricity you use for all your electrical device or how much you pay for medince you use
@k_Bradstreet @KamalaHarris Since you brought up the question oxygen where or how do our planet get it
@JordanSchachtel Looks like it starting is repeat similar situation to what happen during the ERON investigation where some of those performing that investigation got catch performing inappropriate activities under leadership of Mueller
@bbusa617 @CNN Well one thing about what's happen different is we've never had a modern ExPresident &amp; a First Lady to help campaign against a newly elected President may be you have explanation
@KamalaHarris Yes good idea but the problem is how to fund such a program and getting the medical community to except that program. As one remember what happen the Affordable Health Care law failed cause most states opt out of the Medical portion of the law so idea may be good how get excepted
@KamalaHarris Well who do you go after the people who promote the use of this type of drugs which seem to point toward the medical community bring how most people get started using those drugs due to medical problems
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Why bring up America cause their are Muslim who are American but they are integrated in to our culture but those who were brought to the European countries have not tried to integrate themselves to be part of the different cultures they are now part of which is causing problems
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Maybe those countries are rethinking their allow refugee into their country it seem those from the Islamic countries are not interpreting very well in to those countries culture &amp; seem there has been an increase in criminal activities by Muslim men against women in their nations
@SenatorLeahy At least Trump ideal was something more than what Congress has come up with for the last 40years which is zero and what was Obama's idea just let enter and have children which they use to keep themselves in our country with the support of liberals &amp; media
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Why does money help make lawyers do better for those they represent
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Have compared what Trump has done to past Presidents and why what he has done get such a negative response
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Have you figure out why liberal and media are so negative toward Trump
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 What happens to that system when refugee are added to those systems from different cultural and religious belief
@Jessica32983247 Being Saudia Arabia is the center of the Islamic world it but surprising what is happen there cause Muslim are so devoted to their religion they only care to care out to belief down to every word no matter what the cost which means life is cheap
@KamalaHarris Question on this healthcare for everyone bring up how will this healthcare be funded &amp; how will you control cost of all things related to healthcare
@MinnFreedom Well good luck finding a state which you won't find the same similar type of craziness
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin If one checks the facts about problems between police &amp; minority groups it varies but blacks have the largest contact with police data shows black commit more criminal acts than any minority group &amp; commit large percentage of violent crimes causing police aggressive action
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin The one thing for sure is the liberals always seem to make those of any minority group in the victim mode and the who in the majority mode who are mostly white as the aggressors so the liberal use that to promote conflict between the different groups making look like heroes
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Well from your comment you really don't know nothing about American history
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Hate crimes made up or not or fake ones create problems which when people start purse the issue are hard to stop or even change direct it's like a flash flood sweeps everything way in front of it
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well if you review our history when we had all areas need to fight the wars we've been they were all locate here in this country but now the vary industries we would need are no longer here which mean restarting them which would take years to rebuild
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well none of the Communism or socialist model for economy even worked as show by the collapse of those countries economies now the one model that seem to work it best is one similar to the one we use
@NoNameGirl8686 If that person did the crime they should be punished but there has be problems where someone was accused of a crime little that but late the facts prove false so any crime the facts have to match the crime
@MinnFreedom Well we have our fair share of craziness but wonder how do your state deal which people like that seem to go against the values of those who ordinal settled your state
@tonyallen077 The one thing I hate to see on the news all the time is the number of black in the news cause of crime which is sad that so many corrupt their lives with bad choices and makesone wonder why do they purse such a life which leads no where and as a military retiree of over 20yrs
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Well that one of the thing we can do in this country is right to bitch and complain about people we don't like but since Trump come out for president our bitch and complain has reach Mt Everst level don't think anyone my life time have seen this much dislike for one person
@MinnFreedom What think about Minneapolis mayor setup a Shania Hotline to report on people speak against Muslims is this how Democrats in your state operate?
@Come_On_Ground @thePKT4 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin No I evaluate info and see where it leads sometimes it leads to comment like yours
@DinoSaurNo1 @rumanddiabetes @FrankvdH2 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Well wonder what kind of people like you appeal too for your comment need little work on your grammar
@RepJoeKennedy Well when Congress passes a law the law cares not what it does to a person only that those who are responsible care out the law to the letter wi the no excepts. Sad Congress has not take the time to correct any problem such as the one you spoke of about that last.
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 There are some job areas we need cause if there was ever a major problem in the areas where those industries when we would be in a world of hurt and high tech jobs don't build or produce it's we normal use like clothes,steel for building or making equipment used by business
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Yes but there one more factor the Communists leadership was corrupt as we've learn most totalitarian government control the lives of everyone in their country and anyone disagrees especially with their leader end up in Siberia
@indigentdesign What is your source for this info you say is going to happen
@joshtpm @TPM Question is how is Pelosi and the Democrats going to protect the southern border
@Festivaloflight @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace To me Nancy has some work cut out for her the newest members who just got elected are not like those of the past these young guns are looking to make a name for themself so beware old bulls the young bulls are looking to get replace you
@rumanddiabetes @FrankvdH2 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin You must be a Don Quixote fan great the only left is where's the fake knight ? Think America is like a sleeping giant who is slow to awake
@rumanddiabetes @FrankvdH2 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Well how would the Liberals going to make America great or they full of promise which are full of hot nothingness
@realcl1997 @trisha122 @Evan_McMullin Like the old say money talks BS walks
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 How would you go about repair the textile, steel or even the solar equipment industries
@Clare_OC @Evan_McMullin One must remember when the media get hold of stories like Trump and Ms Daniels they see dollar signs
@trisha122 @Evan_McMullin One thing the others of those debates was all the people were getting the same old story line but Trump offered something new but old idea's of making our country like we use to think people were not hearing from the others
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Part of the reason the Soviet economic system failed was cause they could feed their population propely. They treated farming like a 9to5 factory job which it is not but a 24-7 job
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Now in our economy the one thing that has cause job loss was transfer of jobs to oversea some to cost of making produces so industries like textiles have disappeared from our economy. Remember as increase use of motor vehicles many jobs to related to horse disappeared
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Is not what your suggesting a form of socialism or may be the 10percent rule used by some Christians groups
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well old Soviet economy was centralized but had those who from my point of view had no idea how to put that economy puzzle together so it was ultimately collapse upon itself
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well can tell you one income not taxed that social security cheque &amp; some retirements but anyone working pay FICA tax
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well what income is not taxed
@schneidercathy1 @paulkrugman Well one doesn't have to worry about carbon cause when all the trees are gone within 50 years there won't be any oxygen so we'll all die from lack of oxygen
@RWPUSA Well with both alcoholic and pot legalized created new problems &amp; laws to deal with those who abuse both &amp;  drive a motor vehicles of any type. They also have different effects on how peoples behavior. So legalizing both only created situation which require laws to control people
@WayneDupreeShow One question are you ready for Jesus Christ when he returns
@matthewamiller Or when comes to illegals bypass the laws like Obama did during his two terms but when Trump restated the laws everyone jump up and said foul so rethink what you said
@PrisonPlanet Are they develop an app for other religious group so they can do the same thing as the Muslims it's only fair.
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 USSR tried to make their economy work like a 9to5 job which is good in some areas but not in areas like farming which is a 24-7 job and then forestry is another which is not a 9to5 job or small family business all have different working schedules. USSR failed unable to adept
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Do you really know how the US economy works or how many areas are involved across this country
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Wonder do you know how people live once the stop working after 65
@Esme_Dickenson @MissUndercove12 @_Dave9 @ABC Think children need to be embarrassed to show that kind of behavior is unacceptable and is costly
@_Dave9 @Esme_Dickenson @ABC May be he's showing other parents they need to learn how to be parents again but friends to their children
@MinnFreedom Hear one of your city mayors set up a Shania hotline to out people who talk against Muslims so how you did with that situation
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Wonder did you know that farmers don't have to put anything into RICA till they get the ready to retire then put full amount in for. 8 quarter.
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 You're right it is odd example my dad try to pay full amount but every year they raise the amount required
@tonyallen077 Think on this why don't we hear about those type of shooting cause they don't sell as do white on black do. As a retiree see alot but like I say even if there was a black cop shot a white it not make the news. Have you ever seen any white crime on the news like that
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Question who are these worker who are speaking about
@Swift818 @thehill How do you figure that out?
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 So what about taxes most fail to see medicare&amp; social security increases along with income that's just federal not to include state taxes is those included in your figures? Just wonder how the liberal wealth feel about your figures.
@indigentdesign @BetOnHumanity @KamalaHarris Think I know more than you just by the way you comment and looks like you got your head stuck up in some liberal media behind
@jewell_taft @KamalaHarris No just an independent who thinks for himself not like you a liberal elitists troll
@Navylife84 No but to me a PhD in economists is no guarantee that you fully understand all the in's &amp; outs of how our economic system works
@glukianoff @nytdavidbrooks @PamelaParesky Those who now are incharge have forgotten how &amp; who founded their school and believe Proverbs 1:7 is something the leaders of these schools have forgotten bases upon their schools were founded
@glukianoff @nytdavidbrooks @PamelaParesky Well many of this old schools were founded by men which may have followed this saying "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instructions. " Proverbs 1:7.
@JaredAllebest @Ant_Taylor3 @nytdavidbrooks But on the present college campus there seem to be a movement to restrict the 1st Amendment question is why are those who are incharge of college campus allow this type of activities
@Ant_Taylor3 @nytdavidbrooks Well there is this line of thought for you "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction.  Proverbs 1:7.
@primalpoly So what people are saying against the President is not 1st Amendment material but hate speech is that what your saying
@thehill If they go after Trump in that area will they also go after all past people who ran for office of President to insure the same violation weren't present in their campaigns or is this just another crazy situation to be used only against this President only
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Well how is that support funded from what source?
@indigentdesign @BetOnHumanity @KamalaHarris Think after 67 years of living I've learn a few things like cause and effect if you change one thing it invertily effect other things just like changing wages effects how much taxes one pay so may be you may not full understand the process as well
@structuralecon @Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 Here question if everyone was to receive let say $20perhour wage then we need no social programs like food stamps or Medicare would that not put alot of government workers out of a job what your thoughts on this
@824mtnj1 @BuzzFeedNews Well wish they give those who were killed during the riots in California but the rioters were give a pass . Don't know which is worse black rioters or white supremeist both committed horrify crimes against people but the one difference the black rioters get a pass white no why??
@HillaryClinton What think the US should do sail one of our naval ships thrust that strait if there's a treat showing freedom of navigation is good if not think a strong message of closing our main embassy in Moscow
@BetOnHumanity @KamalaHarris Well that's good now all those who now make $15.00 per hour nothing qualify for food stamps or some of the other low income programs since they're making $2400 per month now being in a higher income level paying more federal &amp; state income taxes now a real great move upper
@Richdog49 @KamalaHarris @tonyallen077 How would you solve this problem while still allowing business to c eat hobs for the grow work force
@KamalaHarris So at what wage would be the best 10;15;20;25;35;40or 50 dollars per hour or may be straight salary of 25k;30k;35k;40kor even 50k a year or may be what you make a year as congressional member but the question how would business support such wages
@PresHarryTruman @Freeyourmindkid Yes cause with slavery was gave the Southerns them edge UN p educe good at cheaper price over the more expensive northern goods
@ChandaFinch @StreetLevelTech @LeynaFerris @Freeyourmindkid Your right about slavery as it was cheap labor allowing the Southerns to operate with a big advent over the Northern &amp; turn they increase taxes &amp; tariff on Sounthen goods sold in the north which inturn forced to rebell against Northern economy aggression bring war
@TheUSASingers @brad_shively @MasonPampinella @FalkorResists @mark_msmith856 That which Ike spoke has not changed much but what has change is view of how to use the technology tools to get what those in power want
@dreamofbetter03 Well from how you comment you have know idea what to f freedom real is
@tribelaw If this Mueller investigation keeps going after those in Trump administration it is start to look not like criminal activities but political motives action which is going down a bit of a dark road which will cause erosion of our lives Republic leading to it's destruction
@joncoopertweets It looks like people like you are just as off the chain as you say Trump is the one thing about it is the long stays in as P as President the crazier you people get.
@pierre @Cernovich Well could be any worse than what happen during the IRS scandal during the Obama Administration
@missmayn Sounds like how a good sounding show starts but ends up in the file 13 drawer
@SenTedCruz @realDailyWire Sounds like something found in that book "1984".
@KamalaHarris Want kind of talk is that of course everyone looks different they also think, believe, dress &amp; talk differently even if one is of the same race for me it its one behavior &amp; how one interacts with others is important is how others will perceive you
@dreamofbetter03 You have a very limited view of US. Yes we do bring doom but we also bring life so people can have the freedom to choose how they want to live
@mat_jane_de_yar @DaysofPalestine @imStinger01 Do you think the other nation surround that area want a Palestinian nation just look back in history of that area before Israel came into being there was no thought of Palestinians only thought was no nation of Jews by all Arabs
@andrewdcarlson @KamalaHarris Well how you protect the system from possible abuses by the Democrats also or another groups wish to impeded any law which would put actions that would limit voters or lawmaker ability to cote or insure the process works as designed
@VicMRodriguez @Freeyourmindkid May be it's the same reason hijack US sailor fought on British ship they did have much of a choice
@murphdogg29 Question we know slavery happen but why is it such an issue today ? Yes we still have problems between different groups of people but of all the groups those of African lineage have had the biggest problem integrating into this country question is why.
@gregorykingjr @LeynaFerris @Freeyourmindkid Leave you with this words "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7
@Kb72977 @Freeyourmindkid Leave you with this words "The fear of the,Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7
@gregorykingjr @LeynaFerris @Freeyourmindkid It was part of the reason to see the whole picture of the reason for that war one has to put all the piece together to get a clear picture slavery was just one piece which had been part of our history from the very start it just happen to be part that came to end with this war
@ChandaFinch @LeynaFerris @Freeyourmindkid Yrs it was part of their reason to leave the union in the same reason we use unfair taxation by the Crown to gain our own independence from English Crown
@Kb72977 @Freeyourmindkid Your language usage is not one of you strong abilities as far as history there is so many view of that war it's sad how little we have learned from it. For it effects are still toxic even today so you better get your toxic suit on you might get containment
@gregorykingjr @LeynaFerris @Freeyourmindkid The Civil War was the catalyst that brought an end to the slavery issue for our country which we are still argue about almost 170yrs after the end of that war
@Kb72977 @Freeyourmindkid No slavery was part of the reason the war happen but like all thing it was just that a part of why the war happen like a jigsaw puzzle one needs all piece to get the whole picture one piece can distort the picture given an inaccurate view which some have done with the Civil War
@KristenInVA @classiclib3ral @lindeeloo_who @williecaine Well we did on the group that took over Russia back in 1917. We set troops to Russia 1918-1925 not in any history books
@Freeyourmindkid Well same thing goes on how others who came here are left out of the historical picture to so don't feel lonely how think Native American feel knowing how their heroes are betray in history
@walking_fox @Freeyourmindkid Another question who are you speak about here many a country has setup government which benefit only those they chose to be the privilege so what's so new about that it been going on since man formed the first civilization
@charlesanansi @Freeyourmindkid So what does this video say I am an overwork man that my bosses don't understand
@walking_fox @Freeyourmindkid Well those of the British homeland did look at the colonist in the same way as those in the homeland. The colonist were just tools to be use to make the homeland stronger so American colonist felt that was not fair so they took their own faith into their own hands
@walking_fox @Freeyourmindkid Well the winners always do that
@Kb72977 @Freeyourmindkid Well Europeans were ever aggressive people but so are those in Africa just look at it today how after gain independence from Europeans the African Tribal ways raised it's head to bring chaos to Africa as well as religious difference between old pagan beliefs &amp; Islam
@okoyemilaje20i8 @Freeyourmindkid Why such a reply
@walking_fox @Freeyourmindkid The American colonist were in some ways being use in a similar manner as slaves to help increase the economy well-being of the British homeland so after years of trying to get fair treatment with little success the colonist rebelled &amp; gain independence after 12 yrs of war
@eyeswideopentx @Freeyourmindkid Well if you look at slavery it still is alive in the world even into place where it started Africa. But slavery is still an economy issue use of human for uses based on an economic system where human are a commote with value to be used by other human sad but true
@TammyArra @Freeyourmindkid The only problem was slavery was only abolished in the states that ceded from the union those state that didn't slavery was still allowed &amp; slavery was not abolished till the 13,14&amp;15 Amendments were add to the Constitution in 1868-1872
@okoyemilaje20i8 @Freeyourmindkid Fit this into your game "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7.
@classiclib3ral @lindeeloo_who @williecaine Well Hitler was one of the worse but there were two in the same league as him Stalin &amp; Mao both cause as many deaths but both are treated as heroes in their countries so it strange how we look at these three. Hitler the monster. Stalin and Mao heroes can explain that situation?
@okoyemilaje20i8 @AgentCarter_SSR @LauraBarton2018 @JRHorsting @ResistanceHulk @1WarMachine2018 @ItHasBegun2016 @StarLordResists @American_Blonde @Coulson_2017 @NickFury2018 @DrStrange2018 @PatrickJude16 Movies are nice dreams of what people the world might be like only if people action that way in the movies but the reality is total opposite of what's shown on the movie screen
@DavidJNeal Well wars have been fought for many reason &amp; our country has fought many a war over coats lazy thing like how to e Buffalo Soldiers of the West fought during the Civil War to suppress Native American attacks on western settlers so how does that fit your history
@okoyemilaje20i8 @Freeyourmindkid Which one are you refer to been there food seem alright
@walking_fox @Freeyourmindkid Who are you refer to in your comment to me it describes many parts of the world across many centuries &amp; empires so which one are you refer to ?
@Freeyourmindkid Well our whole country has things named after many people who may not like those place named after them. Do you think changing the names will change how people think or may be make thing worse for all parties
@Freeyourmindkid Do you know why our country rebelled against the Crown which lead to our gaining our independence from the Crown
@Freeyourmindkid Have you really look up the years leading up to the Civil War? Slavery was an issue but not in the way we think it was more of an economy issues like cheap labor which allowed the South to make big profits compared to North did like so they force higher takes on the South
@KathrynSmiles @NormanBuffong @ladyhawkerfinds @LEAD_Coalition @mmbaily @StephStephens @ZaibatsuNews @Cruellaisdevine @texyellowdogdem @utilitarian @Beaufort_Gage @ASAging @JeriLowrance @MsActiviss @AMluvinit2 @realDonaldTrump @exoticgamora @porpentina2017 @briantylercohen @anti_orange1 @jomareewade @lfkraus @immelza @Carolyny1948 @ClareWHarris @chappie_cat There's a problem with your math yes mass shooting happen but if you take all the individual shooting that happen on a single day mass shooting would add up to only a faction of the number of people killed across this country &amp; probably most of shooting were done by illegal guns
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats If equality is in your game plan may it's time to add selective service to your equality equation
@TheUSASingers There's one thing you failed the talk about is how will this programs be paid for &amp; where will the funds come from to pay the people who will be required to ensure this programs operate at a proper level to insure they don't collapse or get corrupted
@DrEtiquette @writemombritt Here's a saying from Proverbs 1:7-"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction."  I wonder how that would fit into you equation for those two?
@larryelder @ThomasSowell "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 1:7
@JasMoneyRecords Well some thing will never make sense. It like why do me have to sign up for selective service &amp; women don't since equality is a big thing today why is selective service the one exception left out of the equality equation
@peterbakernyt There's one thing that is disappear with people like the 41st President the lesson they passed on to us are disappear. Lessons learned from good 1920-1929; hard times 1929-1941; war 1941-1953; 1945-1960 prosperity.
@jeneps Well if you were to look at 90percent of the nations of the world women have small roles in any government operation &amp; of the 10percent that have women in major position one could count all on the fingers of both of ones hands.
@AmbJohnBolton Question why has the UN done nothing real about either Iran or Not Korea as far for either the nuclear or the missle &amp; the Russians &amp; Chinese have impeded any progress on both of those areas question why???
@Clown_Torture The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: bur fools despise wisdom and instruction.
@Ocasio2018 Well that's a good thought but it's a dream which will be hard to fulfill base on how people like to complain &amp; bitch too much about everything under the sun
@Ocasio2018 Well if you want medical for all big question where will the funding come from to support such program. How will you get the medical &amp; business communities to go along with it as well as the states governments?
@tom_webber24 @BreitbartNews @JohnKerry Who is that idiot in the video?
@tom_webber24 You so like one those old gunfighters the notch their gun after a successful fight

@Kalondikebar @tomselliott @Michaelfulton45 Well I'm not a white person but a mixed one of European &amp; Native American mix wonder what you are mixed or full
@saranimd We have more laws on the books covering fun but it's not the legal guns that do the harm it's the illegal ones that are doing most of the harm but bought in a story but on the streets. So how would you approach that problem?
@JoeCrain Tornado has been a very destructive force but it always surprise how much has not changed when come to warning of approach ones &amp; how when they do strike we have such loss of life. Today person living in Tornado Alley seem less prepare today than those 40 or even 20 yrs ago why?
@thepoolrat You are one sick person to even invite Satan to your table for Gian only notice is to get you to forsake God so he want be by himself in the lake of fire. For it awaits all fails to get by the Gate Keeper of God's kingdom

@RonHarrisMN Well if he had no one would have said a thing cause they would be fraud of being call a racist if you remember Obama use the race card against both McCain &amp; Romney
@Joshua_Mikel @mike_pence @BrianKempGA Wonder what do you know about The real Georgia not the Atlanta one which to me does not show the real Georgia just another big Southern city taken by a bunch of northern liberals
@Public_Citizen Well most of what listed was done but the Democrats undone it so now the want to reconsider all the old items guess to make themselves to look good
@67jewelCDH Cause he does do all the thing you commented on does mean his think is far from those at the lower scale just look at how the liberals treat those who have similar ideals they look down on them more so than Trump he may be rich but he knows where his wealth comes from the people
@RogueFirstLady Don't judge what was said 20 yrs ago to what is said today the political atmosphere it quite a bit different now
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats What does that really mean "Fight For The People"? Are you going to reform immigration ; control cost of healthcare; get a livable wage without driving up the cost of living; help bring back jobs where business moved outside the US do to over taxation's &amp; regulation
@_Santa_Barbara @thehill Well that was a nice thought but in reality not practical for people are the one factor which has to be factored in to make any election to work
@SenWarren There's one thing you keep forgetting is our foreign policy has always been backed up with our ability to use our military power to influence the out come &amp; if one leaves it out of the equation the other will fail
@SenWarren Question for you how did you not see this coming during the Obama yrs &amp; before it just now during Trump term you &amp; your fellow liberal decide to jump on this problem now so where you'll at before Trump
@MSNBC Then if the bosses at VA need to be fired
@marclamonthill Yes but one must go back to who controlled that area before 1918 it was the Ottoman Empire so Palestinian Nationalism did really that hold till after 1948 when the nation of Israel became an independent nation
@Wayward888 @realDonaldTrump Well those investigation s were not pursed in the as manner as this Mueller's investigation &amp; the media don't either purse those investigations as they have pursed Mueller's with such a bias attitude either so Congress &amp; media's a strong dislike for Trump.
@JackPosobiec Why would they,be using that type procedure on people question why &amp; is it proper legal procedure
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Boy why would anyone want to put themself thru a painful experience of running for political chaos just to get a tax cut. Think Trump could have spent his time on least painful experience than running for such a political charge position of President of the USA
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Well if Trump did care why would he run for President
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Well if a president is interested in what happens in his country anything he does will always benefits everyone which include himself &amp; his family if one really think about
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Well think the fact about how Obama play his game on us in such way he made us think he had our best interest at heart
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Well at least as far Trump he was more up front about who he is wear Obama was not as up front about he agenda
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump You think it's funny that Obama pull the wool over your head
@SenWarren As a member Congress is it not part of job to pass or change laws but it seems you &amp; other who think it's the Presidents job to ugbore laws which your body passes just because your body seems to have not the ability's to change immigration laws
@JanFWalsh2 @realDonaldTrump Well may be the man Trump replace was a bigger conman believe the reason he was able to get away with his con cause everyone liked him &amp; made excuse for his behavior
@Bissel1969 @realDonaldTrump Aren't you putting the wagon before the horse.
@LeftSentThis I've seen many things both what you described seem to come from both sides question when will both start treating each other as what MLK stated in his "I have dream" speech
@Clown_Torture It sounds like Peter is just repeating his fall of the fence like the old fairy tale of Humble Tee Humble fall of the wall over &amp; over again
@SappyVibes Boy what kind of navy runt are you seen a few but when they let you joint they must have been scraping the bottom of the barrel
@stupidfuckinhoe Question is why was that part of the body in such a nasty place in the first place
@JRehling @realDonaldTrump Don't know which is worse tax cuts or tax increases. Well GOP tax cuts give money &amp; the Democrats tax increases take money so which do you like the most
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well the media gave him more free media than any other candidate that ran in 2016 so it saved him from spending on political ads
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well she got burned due to her emails being hacked &amp; Wikileaks broadcasting they had received her e-mail to the world the tables got turned on her the same way she turned on Sanders during the primaries
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well Nixon did ask those people to break into the DNC what he did was try to cover it up which turn out to be the worse mistake for him one forget Nixon had been up in DC for many years many in Washington didn't like him cause of his Vietnam policies
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley They want change but they don't like the messenger that brought the change but show me where Trump has failed to do what he said he was got to do when got in office. One more thing Trump is the same man he was before the election he has not changed but only thing changed is us
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well think Trump will leave Mueller in place &amp; it will be Congress requestion the investigation to be terminated due to the lack of evidence supporting the original reason for the investigation &amp; not having enough justification to continue spending tax dollar with no evidence
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well where has is the evidence that either Russian or Trump was about to control how people voted or that there was hacking which impacted election for the whole country
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well it was said those under his leadership were the investigators but the became the investigate due to the way the did their investigation which says alot about Mueller's leadership control
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well yes it's legal but only if they use source within our country they used a foreign agent which is illegal as was what Hillary did violated security protocols so &amp; all the Mueller invesgation has provide nothing toward the original intent but waste. $14million
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well he has one black mark the Enron
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley As far as Russian messing with our political process they been doing it since the 1920's
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well how elect have you know a party paid to dig up dirt to be used against an opponent like what the Democrats did with the Steel dossier
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well since you ask please explain why you can not except Trump
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley I try to be as civil as on can be but since Trump came on the scene people have really going off the depend this has been the most crazy ever seen people act toward a person elected to President never in modern history has a President been treated as Trump has been treated
@UppityWilliamP If question where a e the teachers for that would be consider assault which mean that black girl is in trouble of the worries kind
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Yes but the Democrats turn that hearing to side show which to me was an embarrassment to the whole process
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley You are fortunate but the are many who were not so &amp; the Affordable Healthcare law only made everyone into the healthcare system involuntarily &amp; used to the IRS used to monitor every citizen in our country
@NBCNightlyNews Well on e must remember where most of the areas being effect were not populated 100yrs ago &amp; most the areas were not livable either but do to lack of local &amp; state regulation people where allowed to build in these areas which now are being heavily effect by changing weather
@SandraTXAS You need to remember all the land listed in Genesis 15:18 was given to Abram which his descents thru Isaac would passion which to mean the when Jesus Christ returns as King of Israel he will take passion of
@Lara53049065 Well all his speech has shown that we are getting closer to what was prophecy in the Hebrew work list in the books of the Bible
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well his behavior is not food but at least we know where he is coming from but why did you speak out like this during the Obama years when those in his administration when after conservatives or have you forgot the IRS scandal so what your excuse
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Wonder what excuse was used to justify the behavior of Obama administration did during his two terms covering everything from his speak on how everyone could keep their doctor to Hillary email scandal
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well you might as well add Congressional Democrats to that childish behavior to you list after how they behaved during the hearing for supreme court nomination hearibgs
@SenWarren Where are you looking to build this homes &amp; how would you pick the people to love in this homes. Also how many soft will this homes be.
@jenlgeiger1 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well the Democrats are just as guilt by their ignore Obama use of EO to bypass immigration law so do be so high mind
@galaxiou @AFlemin16 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley @NRA Why be so one side on this issue the Democrats have just as many people of that type contributed to them to help put them in office so why the horse blinders
@AFlemin16 @Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Well how do we not know who the Russian may have contributed to may be they also contributed to Democrat candidates due to their liberal ideals which line up more with the Russian ideas of running a government
@Margarita2733 @SMurray1000 @ChuckGrassley Really then why Obama ignore campaign laws during his two terms
@Stormy_Tuesday_ @julycrab712 @OctoberFerguson @DuffySavoy @April2_1 @GOP Well Democ rat logic is just as corrupt to as a law is wrong but not willing to fix it but just ignore it like immigration so what kind of logic is that
@PeterSweden7 Humans are not program for migration as most in the animal kingdom which move as a group which humans only due to conflicts, natural disastrous or other types of disastrous
@CNNPR @WhiteHouse @Acosta The bigger question now is how effective will he be now that if he is even called on to ask question is not called on to ask question he will just a viewer only
@bbusa617 May be people voted separately for each position on the ballot &amp; not a straight ticket now that might be the way the numbers might line up
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug @duolingo Also from what language would you say Hebrew was developed from
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug @duolingo So how would you evaluate dialect as part of a language
@realDonaldTrump Please explain how our country when from big importer of oil to being a large exporter of oil which mean our oil companies are bring big bucks but as far as creating jobs in that area a negative impact. Also many jobs which use to be in that area have disappeared explain why.
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug @duolingo Well if one takes the Bible on where the Hebrew may have start from was the ancient city of Ur
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the part of evolution is a theory which has never really been able to fit the piece of how modern humans came to be &amp; how quickly they advanced to control the world we have come to know
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug @duolingo Don't forget the Celts. Most forget about them but they had a important part to play in Europe before Roman Empire &amp; even the Greeks check it out
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug @duolingo How would you describe the Hebrew language if one looks at it would be one of the Olds languages if we take what's in the Bible to it's source
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well when you take all the different complexion of human skin science can but truly explain how that happen or how it happen only thoeries
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug The problem with these the findings is science has but been able to link the modern with the ancient so until that time it only a theory
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Just interested what languages did you find that the language we call English was developed from
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the only thing that has changed for us is our technology advance have greatly increased in the last 100yrs as compared to the last 2000yrs so the question why now the speed up which science has no explanation from it
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Your right which mean we have not changed since modern human showed up still leaves the question how was that possible
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well if one takes the life cycle of those at the beginning of the Bible they lived hundreds of years long than we could even image possible today but within those same scripture it was foretold humans life cycle was decreased from hundreds of years to 120yrs then down to 70yrs
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug To me all languages develop in similar manner &amp; changes as it is exposed to other thing which help define it's structure with one objective in mind to transmit a message to others
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug To me the development of language we can see from the development of English give a good idea of how we come by language
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well to me what surprise me the most is how scientists can not explain why modern human appeared how quickly we developed to where we are today. If one uses the Bible's timeliness in 6000yrs modern humans advanced very quickly just look at last 100yrs &amp; it seem to be speeding up
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well historical those of science have had to reevaluate their finds many time cause even time they come a cross thing they just add it to their collect &amp; change their theories to match their evidence. So their theories never remain the same
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the English we speak today is now the same it has changed believe if one was to go back to 1000AD you would not recognize the language
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Really what we know about our human history we are not been sure where Morten human really come from only theories no hard evidence &amp; from what I've been reading their still not sure which language was wad the first language used by Morten humans
@CarmineRoux That if they even call on him
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well since you say you are good at language what your take on the Bible reference that during the reference of the Tower of Babel that there was only one language &amp; after God intervene that was a confusion of the language
@KamalaHarris Question what are you doing at the federal level to help your state to overcome the wild fire problem your state has it has had those type of fire such 2011 &amp; every years they seem to get worse question why
@sheanabana Yes I have been in California back in the 70's at Ft Ord &amp; saw the type of trees there were similar to the scrub pines of central Texas area around Ft Hood
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well to me language has change to the addition of new words to describe old thing but I don't think the language of old was primitive some of the language were in someway more advance that our present day languages
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Your right but there's one thing different about the Bible if it was fiction that would make it one of the oldest fiction in the world but there is a problem most of the info in it has proven to be historically correct &amp; most the persons list did live so creates a problem
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well to me to truly understand those word I have to resource meanings &amp; how those word were use in those times
@sheanabana @isabellabc @CHHolte @Tristanshouts @chucktodd Well really then what is all the bush that seems to be associated with forest type area so what do you Californian call those areas that are burning
@isabellabc @CHHolte @Tristanshouts @sheanabana @chucktodd The California wild fire problem reminds me of what happen to the Plain states during the 1930's which are know as the Dust Bowl years which happen during a long drought but was also man had big hand in it's creation by bad farm practices
@realDonaldTrump May be you need to get this book "The American Character" by D.W. Brogan published in 1944
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug May be you have info what is the religion of Abram
@washingtonpost May be the your media network needs a dog to lead it the dog might make better choice of how the new would be better served by publishing only dog stories
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well you you believe in thing you do to me if you the you have faith in the thing you have made with your own hand so what so difference in what you do than what people believe God created &amp; have faith in those thing he created with his hands just like you
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Do you remember the story of Troy which was thought to be fiction but turn out to be a real so sometimes fiction which was not real fiction but truth
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well if one takes the story of Jesus Christ he gave his life but the one difference is he died but 3days late he brought back to the living then 40orso days late he left this planet on a cloud which foretold he would return at some future date to reclaim land of Israel as king
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well like any story one has to have someone to believe it is true which is true of the stories in the Bible cause moat have historical events, place&amp; characters to back up those stories so they have more value as being true happening than fiction
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Heroes are a form of saviour as in all stories the objective of a hero is to save just how that hero goes about doing it is different in all stories so is the story of Jesus Christ is both hero who gave his life to save his people &amp; the world
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug No but there is always a hero of similar types in each of those cultures
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the characters were different but the basic base line story in all are similar so it makes one wonder if all had similar source they all may began when the story of the tower of Babel when human when from one people one language too many people &amp; languages.
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug No they may not have used the stars as those of mideastern world but they have similar stories of creation so close the seem to come from same source
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well that's what modern science says but from the Bible story of Adam &amp; Eve is is correct is what modern humans origin from a more advanced science beyond our present science capabilities
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Yes but all the story which use the constellations if one one study them all have the same basically story line birth of the savior or hero who would come to save mankind
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Here something for you to think about who was the first cloned human which was Eve also she was DNA modify from the DNA of Adam to produce a women so science is in the every begin so what you think of those apples
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Your about the Jewish god but the name Jew is not the true name of the people of the Bible it is Hebrew the people who are traced back to the first human spoke of in the Bible Adam which would be the father of modern man
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the star chart that was found in one of the Eypgtian building's was study found to be a picture of the heaven dated back before 4000BC but if you were to study constellation each group tell a story but basely the as story of a coming savior of humankind
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the constellations were t he first way that are creator in a way told humans of the future events to come it is the prophecy of Jesus Christ thousand of yrs before his birth
@Knightmoved The Bible is not just a book but a historical record of a group of people which makes it one of the oldest &amp; hate to say one of the most accurate one every produced by man to say it's just a book is down right ignore
@AdamSchiff Well the Mueller's investigation has not produced on ounce of any proof of any conclusion between the Russians or the Trump campaign so how million more of taxpayer dollars are the Democrats will to spend
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the star charts found in Eypgt were copies of old ones dated back to 4000BC almost 2000yrs before the Egypt civilization
@Knightmoved But to me the first man was given knowledge which we are rediscovering &amp; also to me our creator is always allow us to expand our knowledge as he see a need or he will also take it away if he see abuse just look at past civilization that came before since modern human appear.
@Knightmoved @Wile_Coyote_ESQ Well if one believes what's written in the Bible God has given humans 70yrs but one can add or take away those yrs
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug To me writing which humans developed is not a natural development but an intelligent development in short time frame as to how old the unverise is. Writing happen quickly into a very intelligent form of communication
@FuzzInvasion @porterwest8 @WSJ Well there one thing you forget the rural can survive without the metro or suburban so the metro &amp; suburban need the rural than the rural need more. Yes they both benefit but large population center would turn into chaos like a city under siege of old
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well the first writing was not words but pictures for them use writings are still with use in the heavens the constellation are the only first stories man record when he started written them down
@Wile_Coyote_ESQ @Knightmoved Well guess you are to educated for me if with all that education you have the yard time read my word feel for you
@Wile_Coyote_ESQ @Knightmoved What ignore you way of thinking
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Intelligence of modern humans is not mystically but is almost a miracle as tohow in little as 6000 yrs modern human appeared so suddenly in history as if some form of intelligence was behind the appearance had intelligent design
@Knightmoved Well if one looks at me science of today we've advanced alot in the last 100 yrs as compared to the 200 yrs before that brings up the question what allowed humans to advance so fast
@porterwest8 @WSJ Well you need to rethink rural as without it you would not have the foods you enjoy at you table or the clothes you wear or the power you use to power all those toy you use to communicate with so you thing the rural need the metro area you right their customers of the produces
@WSJ If you notice where the Democrats are gaining is in the metro like areas where government spends alot to keep people under government control but the downsize is it's driven those areas into bankruptcy due to the social program increa e due limited job growth &amp; illegal population
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug What did you get?
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug No but if you compare how we treat medical condition today it's only took 3500 yrs to catch up
@EmmanuelMacron We in this country have some how combined patriotism &amp; nationalism into one ideal of being proud of our country as well protecting our way of life at the same time
@The_DoctorV @MiddlesexDoug Well have be you overlook at our human body how all the varies system which make our body to operate with such high precious that makes all what we humans develop is still operation as a caveman intelligence
@Knightmoved @Ati_f_7 Well 3500 yrs ago there was medicine was being practice at a level which our modern medicine is just now rediscovering
@Knightmoved Well modern science still has not found how what brings life into being that evolution still has many piece which they have not been able to explain how they come together to make the human we call modern man but creation explaintion seem to give the best science explaination
@Knightmoved You need to rethink what is written the Bible cause there is more science in it than in most science books we use to teach or children today
@Knightmoved Well the evolution theory is just that a theory with very little scientific evidence to back it up as far as the evidence in the Bible it has been proven to have more true than myths
@dianne_hornick That is a dis race for anyone to put a pic such as that out to me they need to be put in a deep hole for such disgraceful display and anyone who agrees with this display need to jump in as well
@Knightmoved Don't you think the scientific &amp; creation both work together cause if one looks at our modern world today just look at all the things we use today so those two science &amp; creation work hand in hand
@The_DoctorV Yes but if one was to real look at how a human is put together it is not a random assembly but one which alot of thought was require not at random chaos but one of intelligent thought process just in the same way some of our most sophisticated systems we use today
@The_DoctorV Well those thing which are not see are put together as some scientists say not randomly but have some intelligence behind how they were put together
@Knightmoved If one was real interest in science one would see science is ever present in the Bible example story of Adam &amp; Eve is full of science which we are now just discover so may be you need to look more closely at thing listed in the bible for there is something that may surprise you.
@TBrno11 @forsberg_drew @jrossco @raul2rj @Barnacules @realDonaldTrump Well the House may start investigation but to complete anything they need the Senate &amp; without it it just a bunch of political play which waste your tax dollars
@Knightmoved Well for sure the modern human is something of a mystery for there has been no physical link to any group of species that have been identified it just like modern human just appear out of nowhere which science has yet to explain
@The_DoctorV Well there are thing which are unseen but we believethey are there like air which is unseen but is there cause we live so the unseen thing make the seen thing possible just as God may not be seen but his influence is always present whelter one believes or not
@Knightmoved Well their are physical laws we use to say was impossible for man to do like flying an object that was heavier them air but once we learn how new ways to apply old physically law it became possible so a far as physical law we have a long way to got into the unknown
@Knightmoved As far as believing what is written in the Bible is up to each person to decide but as far as the info found there has Proven time and time to be some of the most historic correct so makes one wonder what is written there is very possible true not myths.
@carolinebjerke2 Question what does a person like you believe in?
@carolinebjerke2 You sound like a very unhappy person with the way you look at the world
@The_DoctorV Another way of thinking on faith &amp; believing is it help free humans from the sins we face as we travel thru our life
@The_DoctorV Do you think humans are born with violent behavior or do we learn it what's your thoughts on that?
@The_DoctorV So what are you suggest to replace faith &amp; believing with
@NyabinghiD Did name who in the government who help him sell his drugs &amp; who he buy them from?
@NyabinghiD Who is Regan?
@NyabinghiD Property is a new term the liberals came up with to description the poor in the 60's but alcohol people been fight against it for long time before 1919 when they pass a constitutional amendment outlaw it it was not just the poor who paid wealth to &amp; many got rich btwn 1919-1934
@NyabinghiD Your have a low way of thing on the poor but crime does don't see the difference between poor or middle or wealth just how they are reported by the media
@BlueNGoldJoe @arensb @Larry_Lamb_MN @NateSilver538 @brianefallon Well if one was to real know how the we get electoral votes which are typed to the popular vote within every state
@Yamiche Well you say Trump emboldened those groups but did not Obama similar groups on the other Er side of the coin during his two terms question why did people like you speak out about Obama's speech which emboldened those groups or were you par of those groups emboldened by Obama
@Larry_Lamb_MN @NateSilver538 @brianefallon Do you real think that the electoral vote over rides the popular vote you better retook at how we get the electoral vote in the first place.
@theirfanator @Larry_Lamb_MN @NateSilver538 @brianefallon Well you need to look at how the party system has changed since the very first one our country start with Whirs &amp; Federalist which change to become the Democrat &amp; Republican parties &amp; even had some minority parties also.
@Jorja001 @Larry_Lamb_MN @NateSilver538 @brianefallon Well another way of looking at the electoral vote it give the least populate state an equal share in help choose the President where if only we use the popular vote as little as six states would be need to choose our president
@RexHuppke That woman was doing her job which was to retrieve the mic &amp; give it to some other journalist but Costa refused to give it up due to his blocking the woman who job is to retrieve mic Costa press pass was removed from him so he can't be part of WH press corp.
@NyabinghiD We both have spelling problems
@NyabinghiD Those at phase of drug may have started with Regean but those drugs were made illegal by the Amendment which made alcohol illegal back in 1919 so &amp; we've been fighting drugs since the drug wars of the. 19th century.
@NyabinghiD Well bigger question is why do people turn to criminal activities?
@crystal_kolomas Who were the two presidents your speaking about that mad bomber when after form president, a former VP ,Sec of State &amp; last both ran for President but the only thing they had in common was they were from the same party Democrat so looks like that person had it out for Democrats.
@tribelaw How would compare what happen to Trumps family to what happen to any wealth family let as like the Kennedy family
@NancyPelosi If the rule of law is what your interested in you such ask your self how did you all someone on your staff to break it by spying on you for the Chinese how you,miss that be in the position you hold?
@nigtmancometh @pescami To your question ask your self why did those men set up the two house that way in the first place.
@Joseph4AU @pescami Those class help understand the government one has to go to the core as to why the two house were created in the first place.
@GSaltine @pescami Well the bugger question is why do Republican do better in rural states than Democrats
@snoble @pescami Add this info to your fact which party does Christian favor.
@KamalaHarris Wonder what you think of that black-Latino activist being attack at the rally where ExPresident was speaking what's your comment on that event &amp; how the crowd respond to that person.
@cpicciolini @MSNBC Let me ask you how is blacks enjoy the best of both their world &amp; the white one example the compete in every thing whites do but have their own separate beauty pageant, BETA awards &amp; black only magazine's so how is they have all this &amp; still claim to be victims
@cpicciolini @MSNBC Wonder what America you live in for not the one I know for one who is black seems to have more opportunities for getting ahead in this country than you realizes chances at jobs , education, housing &amp; many more so don't sell me that story the color of their skin hold them back.
@Polidorable @bennoba @secupp @cpicciolini To me any type action from verbal assault in a restaurant to fiscally assault based on one speech of serious dislike of person or group to me is a form of hate action to say what you say is to me is bit intelligent ignore.
@AmyMek Makes on wonder what kind of Christian that person is especial one that says they representative God ?

RCSB take down at McBean community center or about 640pm 11-03-2018 close to dozen car for one unknown white male https://t.co/Hx5lm07eNG
@McguireScotty @tedcruz Well that person should have checked Texas law cause that could in up with a large fine or jail or both plus she got video doing the crime.
@KamalaHarris Why check out those who work at jobs which pay less that $3.00 per hour .
@KamalaHarris How do this women compare to other women of other groups as compared to men from the different groyps?
@ResistingEsq Why did you do that during Obama's time office he did the same thing just didn't get much media attention so how come you were so easily won over to vote Democrat you must not have been much of Republican to change so quickly just go Independent
@KamalaHarris May be you need to check on all the other Native American's see how they vote they are in all but six states which are a mix of Democratic &amp; Republican run state mostly in Midwestern states. If you worried about voter suppression check all areas in our country where NA are locate
@NPR Farmers will continue to produce a crop which pays the best price at present its coco &amp; guess who is the largest purchaser of that by product of coco it's the US till we get control of our desire for that by product the farmer keep planting coco.
@AnthonyRR_90 @Acosta Well at least Trump is for the American citizen where Obama was willing to let anyone in to our country as long as they were willing to vote Democrat how great is that! One more thing Obama was the first President to proclaim America was no longer a Christian nation.
@Acosta Well the only thing that is for sure is there're is around 7K coming to our southern border for one purpose is to gain entries to our country which you seem to be saying it's oh ok with you or I'm wrong with that conclusion.
@TheRevAl Question to you what have you been doing about those same issue &amp; why have you not promoted similar leadership conference for young black leaders ?
@Lawrence Question in less than two yrs your say Trump &amp; Republican were able to do this but what's your thoughts on all those shootings that happen on Obama's watch how did his administration down grade those shooters abilities?
@matthewjdowd @hughhewitt @JoeNBC @SenatorCollins Ask yourself this how can a member Congress tell people at rally they need to go after members of Trump administration when their in public is that not also form of promoting a type of hate activity?
@karenhunter Question happen to this person read he was married to a black woman had a child with her also had it said mental illness problem wonder after the end of a mixed marriage this person went of the deep end &amp; commit such a crime.
@JillShawcross Why is this your first party of this type?
@ceejay410 Please explain you logic behind you statement that Trump is unfit to be President.
@brandihc1 @realDonaldTrump For one thing to Bea mass murder one has to have kill someone which from what been put out Bo one has die from this weapon scared the hell out of a lot of very important people who support Democrats cause &amp; to blame Trump for what this person chooses to purse radical actives
@COkwir @cobbo3 @dfkm1970 @AkakiSam @godruhanga @rakidi Guess desire for to hit thing especially the thing of taboos is always present.
@wang_maya @BBC Guess the Chinese have two face one they want the world to see then the hide face of the old imperialist communist one they show to their people which they try to hide from the world but in the age of see and know all it is impossible to do.
@ruima What's you thoughts on the ever expanding Chinese presents in the world from the economy, military &amp; technology advance of the last 20yrs?
@annafifield Is there ever blue skies over Beijing being it is has a very large vehicle population?
@ReutersAfrica How would you characterize the changes in South Africa with the displacement of white farmers from the land by the government that I hear been happening in the last few yrs?
@geonal Have a question how would describe the events that have shape African's from events over the last 10yrs.
@loudsoliloque @cnni What do you mean?
@geonal @cnni Well normal I would agreecwith you but in the last 20yrs African has become a very dangerous place some places are more dangerous than other religious extremist, disease, tribal conflicts &amp; a few other situations the have made it a dangerous place to live or visit.
@Websurfer1998 @bbusa617 @dgerogers Sound so easy but those folk always seem to find a way to bypass those thing to gain access to our counrty, jobs, schools, healthcare, food stamps &amp; many other social program our country has. And if the government takes action some liberal steps up &amp; says we should enforce laws.
@cnni Yes it is beautiful from above but when one is on ground level one then realizes how dangerous African can be from the element, wild life &amp; it's many different people who inhabit it.
@linksteroh Well the Spaniard did alot to screw up those countries they had almost 400 years of shaping that part of the Americas before the US start getting involved in around 1800 with President Jefferson .
@bbusa617 This will become a problem forbthe San Francisco when it comes to states &amp; federal elections which require a person to be a US citizen to be able to vote. The city officials are creating a false illusion for those who here illegal,
@MajikaZulJin @Adondriel @lcorning @krassenstein Then why are the Democrat crying about voter suppression is that not a type of voter problem which may be a great problem so what's your source say about that?
@MajikaZulJin @Adondriel @lcorning @krassenstein Check but still don't see how they com up with a billion that's a lot of voting did your source say how type of voting were they using tocome up with that billion number local, state, federal or all together still a billion still sounds a bit much.
@linksteroh What mess did our country create?
@shannoncoulter Yes but the press also has a responsibility to be honest in their reporting &amp; not lean toward one side over another to me in doing so they do become an enemy to the freedom of the press.
@linksteroh How is it fearmongering when there's an invading army of 7000 people heading for our border to me with that many people heading our direction with one object to cross into country by any means but by legal mean amounts to an invasion may be not with people used as weapons.
@MajikaZulJin @Adondriel @lcorning @krassenstein That brings up this question if voter fraud is so small how is it the we are having Mueller investigation into a type of fraud where another country has helped a candidate win an election if they say there is really no voter fraud happening can you explain that situation?
@MajikaZulJin @Adondriel @lcorning @krassenstein Did know we had a billion people living our country though we only had little over 340 million but only about 150 million vote so that billion number seem a bit out of character for our country. Just wonder how they came up with that billion number?
@Adondriel @MajikaZulJin @lcorning @krassenstein How you come up with a billion votes &amp; where you get you facts from to make such a statement like that?
@Adondriel @MajikaZulJin @lcorning @krassenstein Please stop with you own scare tactics .
@xeni Would you not say it is an army of people you have only one thought is to invade cause they don't like the condition in their own countries so why not over run their Northern neighbors so are you willing to give up your job &amp; home to these invaders?
@KamalaHarris Well guess it have to be treated in the same manner as alcohol is treated after it was relegalized by the 21 Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 .
@RealJamesWoods Well Obama has broke the normal traditional way ExPresidents do things after leaving office fade of into the political sunset no Obama has to ride back into the spotlight how strange bedfellows political situation create them.
@br0nx10ve18 @lcorning @krassenstein Well some zip code areas are very large like out west &amp; one can not tell what the make of the people either also some cover very small areas due to population like in the big cities areas.
@billwrites4you @lcorning She one thing you left out a Latino &amp; what is there so many terms used for Spanish speaking peoples of the America's?
@Adondriel @MajikaZulJin @lcorning @krassenstein Why do we need ID in the first place?
@ChrisJZullo @ENDisNearSaveUS @TagAmericaBlue @togetherthrive Why is it change scares people so much ? Big question why does people like Trump scare liberals like you it's as if act like a horror monster like the one one in "Friday Thirteen" has taken over the government my question to you why such scare tactics?
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris Would you say the same think about Iran &amp;  North Korea by the pursuing nuclear &amp; middle technology which both have Russia &amp; China seem to be ever slow to to react to that situation. So would you do in that situation be passive or be aggressively to prevent those pursuits.
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris Yes the treaties have prevented a nuclear war but now some of the parties like Russia &amp; China are expanding certain weapon system which were ban under present treaties which has has put the rest of the world at a disadvantage medium range systems have created new situations.
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris Question how would you expect your government or any government pay for all the service it's people have come to expect?
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris @cathmckenna Here's a question for you to think about why does man have wars in the first place?
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris @cathmckenna Well a one party system does not work ever well it creates more corruption just look at the old dictator systems communism, religious one &amp; one man rule like USSR, China, North Korea &amp; many more like them we have today. Two party system seem to work the best so far.
@tiger_reviews @KamalaHarris Well think it use to work well if all parties would stay within the frame work of the treaty but it seem only one of the parties has being doing that the US as far as Russia no &amp; the Chinese where not even a part of that treat so they did whatever they want. Now need new treaty.
@KamalaHarris You can make it as easy as you want to vote but it still requires one critical element to make it work that element is the people desire to go do their duty to vote so that area is probably be the hard to make happen cause most people think on it the least important think to do.
@SenateDems Bigger question what did Obama do during his 8yrs that made or economy grow as compared to what Trump is doing now please explain how &amp; what are the best differences between the two.
@Nkokas @WSJ @SenWarren That brings up this question how did that company get into that much trouble being a seller of toys &amp; who has replaced them as toy seller now?
@FoxNews Crazy to kill of a character with a drug overdose a bit of a sick sense of humor is that how liberals kill of the opponents they don't like is strange twist of faith makes me wonder how would they kill of characters they like a more humany way of killing like die of heart attack.
@JackPosobiec Question do you treat all that seat on that bench the same way?
@Viscous_cree @BigSteve207 @mviser @mateagold You must be speaking from have experience it being a Native American which tribal do you concern yourself a member of.
@BigSteve207 @mviser @mateagold If the DNA test of Sen Warren shows any characteristics related to any of those who inhabited the Americas before Europeans next step is to identify which group of those inhabitants would be identify from those characteristics. As for me my linage comes from Cherokee of my mother
@JustgoawayDT @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump What you just describe is most American like you wonder how much you pay to keep someone quiet?
@SafetyPinDaily Well really only way to find out what happen to that person is Turkey has to be pressured to increase investigation of all personal at the Saudia Arabia embassy to find out what happen to that individual
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Guess his money may be a good reason. Guess with Hillary it was the power of of the position her husband Bill held was probably the biggest attraction for her.
@RealJamesWoods Well those three did not list the native people who inhabit those area's cause the Spanish were European mixed with those groups. Another thing haven't hear of any DNA testing of people who inhabit Americas before Europeans arrival. If you have please pass info on it.
@RealJamesWoods Looks like the big man saved that young man from making a bad mistake.
@JohnCornyn Wonder how many were give treatment as those 4 individuals for there were violence from both sides so the law needs to be applied equally to all who purses violence to express their view.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Well Trump is a people person he likes the personal touch but like past president he jumps into the fight he don't back away when confronted which is far different which we are not use to is why some react so negatively to Trump.
@ezralevin Why is it that people like you failed to see why there is a need to update voter records to insure voters a doing their part by insure they update the voter registration so fraud will not happen.
@ezralevin Well hear most states do that already when one gets their driver license &amp; are 18 yrs old that person is automatically signup to vote but after that it up to that person to insure their voter registration is always up to date.
@KamalaHarris What are you doing for the women vet for since women are now being more exposed to combat they are becoming like the me as to injuries as well suffering as men &amp; are becoming homeless just like many men vet's. You have talked about women issues but nit much on that issue why?
@KamalaHarris Funny if Hillary had won that 2016 Presidential election she would be doing the same thing Trump is doing with the court the only difference you would be jumping for hey knowing liberal policies would be ruling not conservative ones which makes you &amp; others a bit of hypocritical.
@B52Malmet Then why did you make that comment for even Jesus to the two who were crufied with him they would be with him in the kingdom so even the worst of us can be change with just little faith &amp; prayer.
@larryelder Is that not what some parties want for the government to control our lives as what the Democratic Party seem to be focusing on.
@B52Malmet Looks like you have little faith in prayer.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence May be you can explain why Hillary has stayed with Bill after the allegations?
@jlsHouston Why you call it a fiasco?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Really to at the end of the day the only thing that really matters is what God finds in your book of life which he uses to determine whelter he will let you into his kingdom or send you to be firewood for the his Lake of Fire he has prepare for those who don't make into his world
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Your right Clinton did talk about those thing in the same way Trump has but what made him above being call what you have be calling Trump?
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Never hear back on how you forgot the impeachment of President Clinton.
@NLTAndrew @MikeBloomberg Is that the same Bloomberg who got any soda bigger than 12oz ban in NYC?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Have one thing for you there's really nothing you could do or say that you hurt or bash me so give it you best show but becareful it don't boomerang back at you.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Another thing is that what you called President Clinton &amp; what name do you have for Hillary would it be iron skirt Hillary by chance?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well whelter you like it or not he is the President for us all so he's also your President to if your a US citizen so live with it till he is replaced.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well what made you think Obama was such a better people?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well why ask her I'm asking you why are you going after the First Lady?
@KamalaHarris Why are you bring that subject up or are you expecting that lynching is going be on a come back some how? Can you list the last lynching that happen in the US.
@NBCNightlyNews @LesterHoltNBC How is that much stuff getting thru at San Diego? Wonder how does the California Congressional members explain what are they doing to help their stop the flow of such nasty bad stuff.
@tedlieu Question you ever ask yourself this question is why would a man who had spent most of his military career defending his country but choice to step down from that when his state call for his service why would he do that without hesitation?
@NBCNews Question for your people why did Robert E. Lee choose his state over the country he had fought for most of his adult life?
@KamalaHarris Is that how you justify giving your state more federal tax dollars to pay for illegal immigrants &amp; their children .
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Well do you want your tax dollars to be use to support them with EBT &amp; social welfare programs which pays for housing &amp; all medical &amp; dental care at on your tax dollar &amp; you still have to pay out of pocket for those same thing those kids get at your expense enjoy.
@robreiner I've hear alot of things but yours probably is on the edge of being one stepaway from the Twilight Zone fantasy.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Your say we're in two different realities but it brings up this question which one of if in the real world &amp; which is in the realm of the twilight zone.
@CalicoJack1718 What would you call a woman who goes after women who accuse her President husband of improper behavior?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence What kind of woman stay with a man who she knows chase skirts &amp; get accused of of it but still stays with him will Hillary was done with her husband Bill.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well you need to really look at how this all got started the Democrats paid an exbritish spy to gather as much nasty &amp; dirty info he could get from his Russian sources to be used to help their candidate to win the election so who's more dirty Trump or Hillary?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Have question for since you seem to be a woman of knowledge. Why do you think God put man over the woman after they took of the tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Please name calling seem to be the norm now guess your right we have nothing common cause you seem to have a stronger dislike for this man which tells me you have very few Christian values you chose to show in the present environment we live in today so have a bless day.
@nancy_zarach Wonder want your high school &amp; college yrs were like ? Wonder how many parties you attended where alcohol was present?
@nancy_zarach What fraud do he commit?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence I do give you your right to believe what you want but question how you interrupt facts you comment on.
@NLTAndrew @MikeBloomberg No but FDR did talk to his Republican related family before he ran for his first office so he would not butt heads with them. Did you know his wife was related to him?
@KamalaHarris To me the one who,everyone should be looking toward is their Creator for in the end he is the one which will decide your final destination.
@neeratanden @MikeBloomberg To me what you call rational is nit rational at all but is the rational of a lynch mob.
@NLTAndrew @MikeBloomberg He is not the first to switch parties for political gain go back look at FDR.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well I'm not a troll just onevwho thinks out of the box but to me you are one who has angry at someone is over riding common sense as to your reaction to that person your angry is focused toward which is to me bad.
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence You must have had the patience of Job to keep quiet about on the things that happen during Obama's 8yrs but you have lost it with Trump why were you able to not say anything about Obama but have everything to say about anything Trump does why the difference?
@jlsHouston @joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence One more thing if Trump had done such as Obama had done on this program the major &amp; social medias would be crucified him for it but not Obama my question is why the big difference in our reaction?
@jlsHouston @joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence You right it did start with Bush but leaves a question why did Obama administration let it continue as long as it did &amp; how come AG Holder failed to detect that operation till the killing of the border agent then it took Obama 2 more yrs to stop it &amp; try to cover it up why?
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Guess when someone points thing it from a different point of view you just hate it so have a Bless day.
@jlsHouston @joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence Well it started by a local ATF agents in 2006 but the bigger question why didn't AG Holder know that that operation what said was 2010 after guns identified as program were found at the scene of killing of a border agent it took Obama till 2012 to stop that operation why so long?
@KamalaHarris Question how are you working with the states to except this new change in background checks? As you know Congress can pass anything that they is good but if you forget the states they'll just ignore what ever Congress pass &amp; you wasted a lot of time.
@mommamia1217 @realDonaldTrump If you want blame anyone for Trump winning the election put it on the network &amp; social media they gave Trump more exposure which gave him almost twice the exposure of Hillary at a tenth of the cost.
@mommamia1217 @realDonaldTrump Do you think the Russians don't think the Russians have enough resources to effect the election in all 50 states plus I think the Democrats put all their marble behind a candidate who had to much baggage dragging behind her also they put too much faith in those polls.
@BostonGlobe Why does want he want his comments off the record what is he afraid of ?
@jlsHouston @joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence Bring up the question how did they continue that operation without the AGE Holder not knowing about it which to me is a gross leadership failure on AGE Holder which the Obama Administration try to withhold info on even after the death of the border agent so how can one justify it
@jlsHouston @joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence Yes it did but it was still running after Bush left office till it was stop due to the finding of weapon which was in the the program which AGE Holder said he had no know of that program in 2010 two yrs into Obama's first term which in it self how did it get by them?
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 Wonder where you wounded was in your,backside as you were riding away from the enemy &amp; wonder what kind of medal they give for one who was brave enough to get a wound like that.
@CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well think you need to rethink a bit on that Hillary was a woman who keep all those at bay who try to take Bill many a times even before he became President even though she seem to have on power she did know some how get husband out of trouble if I was betting she help save him.
@joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @Lawrence What makes you so sure it didn't happen what source you use.
@joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @Lawrence How do you know for sure it did.
@joanwalsh @markchildress @ANNELAMOTT You &amp; your friend may be need a good long vacation at the Crazy resort with comments like those you need it do it now for may be a couple month's.
@FrankConniff Hope your but with a name like that for a book to me it looks it has 1,000,000 odds for that prizes.
@BFriedmanDC Charlottesville was a mess for both sides in that event acted very irresponsible &amp; in doing so people got hurt &amp; a person die but saying he was a Trump support is also a bit irresponsible useless you have that person he was supporting have you done that?
@CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well for one thing his wife Hillary was not going to let Congress impeach her husband.
@CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well she may have been but Bill was married so in most state that kind of activities can land one jail for a few years as far as the military it's a courtmartial offence. But it almost got Bill impeached .
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well couldn't be any worse than what President Obama allowed to happen during that FAST scandal where DOJ was selling 50cal sniper rife south along Mexico border in which lost track of the weapons in the process at least one border agent was kill with one of the weapons.
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well you know how the world is crazy about sports &amp; if anyone trys to interrupt the World Cup might start a war due to it. As far as I know more nations of the world play it than any other sport.
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well don't forget the Democrat Presidents they've done a fair share of going over the line if you were actual telling the whole story of Presidential history.
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence With that kind of think is there any wonder that is properly same way all 546plus member of Congress think cause the President can only request Congress to consider his budget for the Executive branch. Now the real money makers is in the House for they make all finical decision.
@magneteach @JaneEyre1967 @joanwalsh As far as how the Electoral College lines up with popular vote within each state has been working fine since it first use back in 1789 when it elected Washington &amp; to me it need no updating it don't need fixing
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence No but he was working for him in the old KGB as a Colonel so he learned where all the skeletons were so now he is where he is do to the KGB years.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence No just want to remind you of little history of President's. Guess from your comment you must have been pretty young during Carter years?
@magneteach @JaneEyre1967 @joanwalsh Well believe they tried that way in a few states way back years ago &amp; it didn't work ever well in the states how you get it to work in 50 different states plus the territories we have don't forget Washington D.C..
@JaneEyre1967 @magneteach @joanwalsh You forget California has a vastly large population than Wyoming so smaller popular vote will count more than in a large popular vote in a state like California. That's why both popular &amp; electoral voting is need for balancing the voting in a Presidential election
@magneteach @JaneEyre1967 @joanwalsh Don't forget the states how would get the states to agree to such an ideal for any changes to our Constitution must go to the states to get approval or have forgot about that?
@JaneEyre1967 @joanwalsh Electoral college balance the playing field when it come to Presidential election where if we just use popular vote one would only need six states to get elected which leave the other 44 states in the cold so don't think the smaller states would little that.
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Question how do you control your own budget when it gets out of control in your own household?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Do you remember why President Carter pulled the US out of the 1980 Olympics it was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan then what happen 1991?
@jlsHouston @CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well you must not forget what President Carter brought with his form of think the year of Iran hostages &amp; no Olympics in 1980 but his did get the Nobel for his work with Egypt&amp; Israel. Think your liberal mind is a bit to picky on history of Presidents.
@CalicoJack1718 @jlsHouston @joanwalsh @Lawrence Well he was the one who basically end the Cold War &amp; brought the USSR down hero or not he did that .
@joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence My question why were the Democrat women of Congress not call for President Clinton's head as they were doing for Judge Kavaugh head during this hearings?
@joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence Remember Bill and his comment about it ain't sex which lead almost to his impeachment.
@joanwalsh @CalicoJack1718 @Lawrence Well let's not forget the half truths Obama told about ACA or FAST under AGE Holder, or IRA attack on conservatives or Benghazi attack or the Russian hack in early 2016 before Trump or the Sec of State Clinton email hack so where do those rate as possible impeachment acts.
@SaysHummingbird One more thing those players have taken away another part if the game now the part before the game start when the anthem along with the flag is no long shown on any national media network only see by fans present at the game.
@SaysHummingbird Glad he did walk out for it is part of his job to stand for the flag &amp; the anthem is also part too.
@CalicoJack1718 @joanwalsh @Lawrence So you think all Republican elected should have been impeached so why do think Democrat President has done such a good job one must not forget Bill he was impeached but Senate failed to have the votes to finish it.
@joanwalsh Now have you forgotten how the popular is used in our Presidential process?
@agordonreed @jbf1755 @jesushjones1 @CharlesPPierce @jmeacham What does it matter what kind of candy does one like they all give one a sugar rush.
@quickslanding Well if that happens you'll probably see guns sell increase a thousand fold. It be back to the days when every man carried a rifle to protect himself &amp; his family the only difference those rifles shot one shot at a time where today they fire multirounds
@tictoc @blu_putnam What is the interstructure for Electric vehicle support to me is needed just like the petroleum base power vehicle .
@VanityFair Question you may want to ask is why is it that American has become second class position example your use of African-American can you explain why American not used this way American of African descent.
@sallydee74 What are the other four ahead of the US ? Have noticed Europe countries all have the same problem with refugees they let into their countries a conflict with the cultural of the country also their religious belief. So wonder how those things were evaluate?
@speculawyer @KpHeaney @nycsouthpaw Well i looked up that case as far that was a word phase but the sign in Texas was to me more disturbing cause gave a vision picture of a act which is different from using a word phase like that person did so to me there's a big difference between the two &amp; your conclusion wrong.
@ArielDumas If I was a betting person it probably be the other way around being she has more seniority.
@Susan_Hennessey The bigger question is how can she answer don't know so many time to think but can remember people who she said was there but when those people they don't remember alot of thing she said happen. Yes makes her story harder to verify &amp; even hard to convict anyone on such evidence.
@speculawyer @KpHeaney @nycsouthpaw Well it takes one to know one.
@KpHeaney @speculawyer @nycsouthpaw To it protects all if it is use as original intend not as some use it for like that person who put that sign up which is very offensive so don't pull this BS excuse your using it don't fly like a pigs ass don't either.
@speculawyer To me you are the one who don't full understand the true meaning of the First Amendment of the Constitution it was to allow freedom to speak but not to be use to a a vague way if communication as that sign was protray.
@MissSnoBunnie To me your using that for the wrong group it should be used for the liberal elitist Democrats that continue to portray themselves as sheep but in reality are wolves ready to pounce on anyone you strays into their path.
@WANaziWatch @Boeing Why if your protesting why cover your faces it seem you want to protest but are afraid of show your faces that shows how much of coward you groups are. If you truly believe in what your protesting be brave enough to show your true faces instead of your cowardly ones.
@speculawyer @nycsouthpaw Well first Amendment does protect our right of speech but it also require a respect of others but that sign is a form of speech which to me is nit what the founding fathers mean by freedom of speech so to me the police had ever right to take that sign down
@AmandiOnAir Why did you say the same thing about when Obama was in office question what is the difference between Obama &amp; the liberal agenda he was pushing &amp; the conservatives agenda's of Trump please explain the differences you see.
@persist4changes Well having lived in Texas a good part of may early years seeing guns was not abnormal to me in some ways it discourage bad behavior knowing everyone had a gun &amp; they knew how to use one was good but to day wonder how many truly know what gun safety is ?
@ValaAfshar May you need to send a copy those liberal environmentist who seat up in Washington how far behind the times they are.
@DesusandMeroVL What kind of video of anyone make within a stuffed bear with boots &amp; Yankee baseball cap walking in the wood scene &amp; doing a "N" rap to boot.
@DanLamothe Glad he has got home but there is many who are awaiting that privilege from passed wars &amp; conflicts so prayer that one day they will return home to.
@ourGentleSins This time reminds me of how the Romans viewed the Christian in 200AD-300AD they used them in their games as food for lions &amp; entertainment for the crowds while they were being butched by gladiators.
@ourGentleSins Why stop with Vietnam why look at McCarthy era that was a fun time or the Red scare of the 1920's fun time to or the Civil Right years also fun times now we step on the bus for the Trump fun time in the latest fun time games we play within our country's political arena.
@fiostang Well it looks like Satan has got you in his backpocket by the way you send out those kind of pics for sure you'll be hinting him in the Lake of Fire has prepare for all who follow Satan's ways. So have fun now cause you'll have a eternity to time how you got in bed with Satan.
@nycsouthpaw That was a picture of the worst kind of personal attack on a group just like burning crosses so that should be treat in a similar matter or griffitt on a religious place of worship all are unexceptional action.
@Zeddary Well love is good but how do you get an enemy who only wants one thing is for you to convert to their way of thinking if not you die. So how can you get live to work in that situation?
@Zeddary Well do you know what the longest continues war that Americans fought it start when the first Europeans set foot on the America's.
@RealJamesWoods Why has that question been put forth in such a manner? Is not the objective of both political parties is to help all American no matter what economic level they come from. So why has there been this class warfare image been created to pit those of one party against another why???
@SenFeinstein Bigger question you have not really answered us why who with held the allegation given to you back in July which brings me to this question can you be trusted to do your job as a US Senator anymore?
@SenFeinstein How through was the investigation into your spy situation as to how much impact it had on your political contacts?
@prcrecruit @kjd_kimd63 @MsnozyN @krassenstein @carissashumaker @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews What's your take on the long time staffer of Sen Feinstein turn to spying on the Senator &amp; her political contact for the Chinese?
@krassenstein Where you get that leaked info from was from the Mueller's team?
@missmayn You think our political system is broke but in reality it is still firing on all 50 cylinders as it was design which you seem to not to understand.
@MartinaHoeger @VP Well wonder what the your face will be if after all this ridiculous behavior that it has turned against the efforts that Democrats don't get the votes.
@RVAwonk Wonder how you came to that conclusion about this person. Did you review this person life or were just following what everyone was saying or you dislike him cause of who selected him for that position.
@esquared123 @KamalaHarris @TheCivicsCenter Wonder how of those kid are actual US Citizens?
@VeraGorman @secularcitizen2 @KamalaHarris No cause when they lower the voting age from 21 to 18 was done liberal ideal if one could fight &amp; die for their country they could vote &amp; drink alcohol but that has been proven wrong.
@secularcitizen2 @KamalaHarris Well it's the same reason they can't buy alcohol till their 21 may be they aren't responsible enough.
@paulkrugman As a simple person the comment you just made is one someone thinks themself of being righteous but in reality they are one who is a foolish over bearing personality.
@lesbianstoner1 @bobbygoode @Sha_Moore @jfsolnet @typeatracey @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin @GOP To me you may find out with that type of think it may cost the Democrats the mid-term election
@lesbianstoner1 @bobbygoode @Sha_Moore @jfsolnet @typeatracey @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin @GOP Well you forget the vote works both way.
@Richpf Wonder how you would react if someone just broke into your home while you were still in it how would you defend yourself?
@aud348 Well it works both way someone has be accused of something like inappropriate sexual behavior which proves to be a lie it leave a scar which seem to never heal cause this e thought of you doing that is there even though it was proven to be a lie.
@sirjordandodge @MichelleObama @BarackObama Sorry but they want be back due to the Congress setting up a wall which has only one way in &amp; now way back once one completes the journey the baby sitter is permanent till 2020 &amp; may be beyond.
@Im14N @MichelleObama @KKHannegan @BarackObama So you concerned a politicians who puts out half truth as a great person but one who speaks his mind a crimnal.
@okayhenderson @IAGovernor @KimReynoldsIA One can proclaim anything but to actual change the culture the question how,&amp; where do one start.
@lauren_hoggs Cause that would step into the states area of responsibility cause moat states has different requirement for voter registration.
@ricdanpow Have you missed that he won the Presidentic by being that kind of person which is what most Americans think but failed to speak out till now one could say Trump has been the most honest outspoken person we had as President since Ted Roosevelt that my opinion
@AmoneyResists It surprise me Howard man alive as served 12 yrs on the D.C. Appeal court had has been praised for his work there then as soon as he is nominated for the Supreme court everyone in the world has sometime bad to say about him based on the allegation which is almost 40 yrs old.
@greta Allegation will not be enough to bring a persecution without evidence to support it.
@greta Well it like any other criminal activities the viticm has to give the law enforcement so they can do a proper investigation then give that evidence to those who determine welter is enough evidence to persecute but if there is not enough evidence there will be no persecution.
@SenWarren How is this program going to be paid for?
@KamalaHarris How did you feel about how the Chinese were about to get one of Sen Feinsteins long time staff to spy on her &amp; her political connection?
@KamalaHarris Question why did they use the military TRICARE health care insurance which has been around since 1998?
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews What is your thoughts on how most civilation that have been documented all seem to have started about the same time frame to include African as well.
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews How would explain the biblical lineage of Jesus Christ his link with it going back to the first man listed in that set of books.
@davidenrich @katekelly @RebeccaRuiz @SteveEder Question how did you get hold of such material was given or did you have pay for it &amp; are you sure it was written by the judge? What proves it was written by him?
@paulkrugman Why is it Trump is jumped on so much but you never really dud the same for Obama on any of his failures like the way his administration handled Benghazi situation can you explain that the movie "13 Hours" paints a vary different picture of how the Obama administration handled it.
@KamalaHarris Why did she do her civil duty on this matter back in 2012 when his name was floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee if Republican was to win the Presidentic can you answer that ?
@McFaul What you think when you hear about there was a person on the personal staff of Sen Feinstein was caught spying on her for the Chinese or how she didn't turn evidence over to her committee till after the hearing was over so how is it everyone jumps on Trump for everything?
@flightbomb @HouseJudiciary @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Is this how you acted when Obama's administration lie to the American people about Benghazi or how they handled the Hillary's email scandal or the Russian hacking back early in 2016 before Trump so what is it with you people that you dislike Trump so much?
@benwikler You know people like you ignore a lot of thing like how Sen Feinstein held back evidence &amp; the Chinese spy she had on her California staff or even how Obama handle the Benghazi situation but let Trump do something your all over it to me that bit hypocritical.
@benwikler Why have you not been so hot on what Sen Feinstein did?
@benwikler Question if Karaugh is not confirmed who will replace him &amp; will that person have go thrust the same meat grinder that Karaugh when thru?
@GrassrootsSpeak @KamalaHarris As women increase their role in political arena how it feel their family we know how it feel the men.
@GrassrootsSpeak @KamalaHarris As
@DailyCaller Your really got a sick sense of humor.
@Weinsteinlaw Did you ever drink during your high school or college yrs if your should you have been allowed to be in the position you are holding now?
@Weinsteinlaw Wonder what your high school &amp; college yrs were like?
@rterdogan_ar How does Turkey teach the history of that country?
@AltemusCarol @FLOTUS Do you say the same thing about parent who get separated from the child do to breaking laws in your state?
@jamie_roche Have ever had a federal background check done on yourself?
@CChristineFair Well what's your take on that long time staffer for Sen Feinstein out in California who turned spy for the Chinese government wonder how Sen Feinstein got played like a fluke by the Chinese you wortjed about white men it was Chinese men who got the best of you women
@PardesSeleh Have you ever look into how Hitler came to power &amp; to compare Trump to Hitler is like compare USA to North Korea.
@PardesSeleh Guess this thing your calling a moral fight is nothing more than one of Satan games plays to corrupt this Christian nation so if your a play in this game beware of the Lake Fire WA citing all who game with Satan.
@TomCottonAR Why have the Senate not done a more through investigation into how a Chinese were about to place a spy on a high ranking US Senator have not hear hardly a word about that but hear plenty about Trump Russian situation question why are your chamber so silent of that issue?
@ABC You people,need to go back to the election of 2012 for Judge Karaugh name was talk about then as possible Supreme Court nominee &amp; the Democrats had plans then to derail any nomination a Republican President would present to Congress
@MSNBC Why are you not talking about Sen Feinstein holding back the Dr Brown letter till the hearing was over to me that one action did more damage to that process so why aren't you jumping her for her disregarded of Senate Judicial process strange how you go after one &amp; ignore other.
@flywithkamala @KamalaHarris Why are you so silent on the Chinese spy that was embedded within Seen Feinstein own staff not a word on that situation but you sure are very vocal about the Russian situation why your making big thing there but why so quiet about a Senior US Senator having a Chinese spy on staff
@irishrygirl Well did forget it also gets one elected to be President like Clinton
@SkepticalSocal @cajuncorksoaker @seevybaby @KamalaHarris She was but she did showed a disrespect to the laws during this hearing she &amp; others basically violent the 4,5&amp;6 amendments if the Constitution
@WizardofHaase @cajuncorksoaker @seevybaby @KamalaHarris Seen Harris may have been one of the best but after what she show during this Supreme Court hearing makes one question if she knows the law why would use the law so wrongly.
@debzgem @cajuncorksoaker @seevybaby @KamalaHarris Well may be they need to check out your past see if there seem there might be an interesting reading too
@JD60720127 @cajuncorksoaker @seevybaby @KamalaHarris Well what do you think of the others those who are of mixture of different race like white &amp; black; white &amp; Asian or white &amp; any number of other groups so what your view of those who look white but are mixed ?
@Andeyerant @EricColumbus @ThePlumLineGS Have you forgotten everyone has Constitutional right which you in your comment would violent his 4,5&amp;6 amendments
@Andeyerant @EricColumbus @ThePlumLineGS First it would violent his 4, 5 &amp;6 amendment rights or have anyone thought about the people
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What part of the Constitution did President Trump violate &amp; is this law suit might be violate the XI amendment to the Constitution?
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Have you ever come after this book "Atlas if World History" main author is John Haywood, PH.D. itshow interesting fact like where iron production started in African
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Same question what's difference between African society &amp; slavery
@JackPosobiec It going to,be interesting what they find. Might turn out like the Kennedy assassination still try to figure out if there was another shooter.
@KamalaHarris As a former CA Attorney General someone who is suppose to know the law is pushing for the FBI without local request in this matter they can not go end as you know from your time as Attorney General of CA. Question is why are you ignore normal protocol?
@KamalaHarris Yes it has been a sham but who has been doing the most sham is the question to m
@KamalaHarris Well what justice are you referring to the lynch mob justice is what you &amp; colleagues have to me been pursuing since the first day of the hearing then the allegation was brought in after the hearing like a back shooter shooting from a dark alley the kind that the justice you mean
@KamalaHarris Why are you procuring a case against this nomination without any evidence to support this allegation were you not someone who honored the law but it looks like who have forgot what that means but how you have pursed this nomination.
@KamalaHarris How are you going to do that what type of programs are you got to introduce to educate young people to stop or avoid that situation?
@KamalaHarris This all could have been avoided if Seen Feinsteins had back in July present the letter she had receive but she choice not to. There the allegations came out after the hearing to me gives the wrong impression of something else which is not an honest or unbiased view,
@danblackroyd Wonder how would act if it was you put in the same position how would you respond to all the high pressure drama that has been brought into this process all because of who pick you for the position makes me wonder if you even have the stones to handle it?
@hannahmosk Here is something for you enlight your mind with Proverbs 31:1-31
@hannahmosk Please discript this white power sign you are refer too?
@michaelianblack Well wonder what you were like in your young years?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The problem is not with the women it's with your &amp; your fellow Us Democrat Senator as how you've have grossly miss handled this whole process of presence this women which has thrown your honest &amp; integrity into the toilet.
@jbenton Is that imitation of you in your young high school
@JackPosobiec In the case which the FISA warrants used in the case which lead to the Mueller investigation may have been faulted. So a review of what &amp; how the info used by the government is needed.
@MichaelAvenatti You need to review the 1991 Supreme court nomination hearing. Lead by then Sen Joe Biden as what he said on the use of FBI investigation
@KamalaHarris Like said you need to review 1991 Supreme court nomination hearings lead by then Sen Joe Biden &amp; what said in similar situation only difference is both Thomas &amp; Hill were government employees at the time of the incident which why FBI was involved please review that hearings
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Think you need to review the 1991 supreme court nomination hearing lead by then Sen Joe Biden similar situation see what he said about FBI investigation
@StephenKing Well you need to go back to 1991 &amp; see what then Seen Joe Biden said on a similar situation you might be surprised but who side he was on.
@StephenKing So where does that put you right in the middle of all those wealth white celebties who make all that money &amp; like to show how smart they are by hacketing anyone they don't like. Like Republicans &amp; Trump
@pattonoswalt Well what happen to you where they bury you with the vombies?
@StephenKing Wonder what you were like in college probably just like that.
@StephenKing You know you comment is a real downer for a person who seem to be intelligent but your comment shows a bit of a racist, bigot, liberal elitist attitude
@Suck_my_bress @rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well slave labor since to be part of any conquest the group conquered always seem to become slave to do all kinds of labor task from house work to very hard labor jobs so why focus only on one group?
@KamalaHarris Wonder how you go about helping men who are also on the reach end of violence it is said men are have a great chance of being victimize by violence than any other group. If true why isn't there any programs for men we have them for women &amp; children but seem bone for men why?
@KamalaHarris Are you also going to promote a political party education class to teach young people about who &amp; what the different political parties we have in this country so the can make good educational choice as to what party to belong to or not.
@KamalaHarris From that picture could one tell she was Hispanic or white
@Adam_Creighton That's what we me have put up with since we're the ones who shoulder most of the blame for most of what happens in the world &amp; if your of the wrong it can be real a heavy burden to carry
@WhyAsk65 @TomiLahren Wonder what kind of poster would portray you since your into hacking people up must make you feel real good to jacket someone up in that way
@treasonstickers Wonder did you brag about when you lost your virginity
@treasonstickers How long did you stay a virgin?
@treasonstickers Well when did you lose your virginity was to someone before that big day
@treasonstickers It since Dr Brown is afraid of being ask question about the incident &amp; accused the Publicans of being bias about the type of question them may ask her. Hear her lawyer already day got the hear change to Thursday now they are starting to back out of Thursdays hearing why?
@KamalaHarris Well you may need to look at the movie business in California it seems to be moving to other states like Georgia
@KamalaHarris Well you need to review what VIP Biden said at the supreme court nomination hear back in 1991 when he was chairman of the Judicial committee on the subject of the use of the FBI for thisvtype of hearing might talk to your fellow Senators who were present during that hearing
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Are we getting agitated
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Well if your so full of knowledge please enlight me when did this remove happen &amp; by who was this white supremacist
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress One more thing your using a term white supremacist the only thing about it is realize new term only came in to use in 1800's
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Well the Mormon writing point toward those of Israel as those who wrote the book that Joseph Smith had not Eygpt
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Well from my research it seems to have a bit of a better edge than your from the comments you've made
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Have you ever study that book
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well myth sometimes come from real life wvents
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews You need to climb down from that ivory tower you have build for yourself
@rafandrews @Suck_my_bress @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews You people need a reality check you so focused on that issue you let the important thing slip by you
@Suck_my_bress @rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well it seem you real don't know as much about those kingdom that populate the African continent
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress No it was Hebrew not Egyptian for they use a form of picture writing till Alexander the Great conquered Eypgt in 328B.C.
@SenSchumer That might have been done if Seen Einstein had not held back on this allegation like she did cause if the Judicial committee had been given this info back in July there could have been a committee vote on this info whether to get the FBI involved but now all this is delay tactic
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Well in the tweeter world those thing are not really need just like in that days of Jesus Christ there was no punition of any type just one continues writing from left to right so eat those words may taste like honey but hit your stomach they will be bitter
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress No I think the church of Lateral Day Saints get their book from Africa they believe Joseph Smith was given a book left by decesnts of the lost trials of Israel who may have come to America around 682B.C.
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress Was that book part of the Catholics bible. Question to you who is not a white supremacist
@NyabinghiD @Suck_my_bress I think you have a ghost ride on your butt cause that be the only reason someone would see white supremacist behind everything that happens in the world just wonder what your ghost is.
@KamalaHarris What you saying to those of who are US citizens being American citizen means nothing cause the privileges we have are open to anyone that we are expected to sit quiet while people like you give a our country away
@Suck_my_bress @NyabinghiD Another question what is the difference in how Christianity &amp; Islam where spread across the Africa continent
@Suck_my_bress @NyabinghiD Think the you need to review how religion varies across Africa like how was Christianity in Egypt before Islam or which country did Christianity show up first. Show there may be much still to learn about that continent
@Suck_my_bress @rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews From most historical records most African were used in the south for agriculture
@Suck_my_bress @NyabinghiD When religion is the other parts of African
@jmcgrain There one difference in baseball center only has to track the ball but in football the player has to track the ball &amp; the other team players coming his direction a double tracking sytem
@jmcgrain Well why do you think that if you what thank someone for allow China to get that edge just look back Obama administration as to their lack of action in that area
@mitchellvii Looks like the Democrat have turn this nomination into a handicap match by tie one arm &amp; one,leg together thinking they can win
@SenBlumenthal Well why are you standing up now against bullying when your Senate Democrat members basically where doing the same thing you are claim the Republicans will do to Dr Ford can you explain this?
@Malachite385 @1virtualgenie @SenBlumenthal Well this whole situation could have been avoided when Sen Feinstein had done the appropriate thing by inform the Judicial committee of this allegation by this person instead of holding it back till after the hearing was completed which was bad ethical d
@Malachite385 Well if your jump on this issue you need to be fair about the Democrat receive proba lay as much of that money from as many wealth donors as Republican so $$ donors on both sides play this game if you going to jump jump on both sides
@CharlesMBlow Well your jump the Republican on comments why do the same for the comments coming out from Democratic side about Judge Karaugh which seem to be just a bad
@SenBlumenthal Question did you did you say the same thing after that first day of Senate hearing after the action of the gallery for Judge Kavaugh?
@NyabinghiD Well that's old use of terms you must be one of the Beatnik who turned Hippie
@NyabinghiD Well what or who is that pic you have some old rocker from the 1960's like Hendrix
@NyabinghiD Well American is no different than the use of Hispanic which is not a race either
@NyabinghiD Have one question why do you hate so much it seem to have clouded you view of history in some way reminds me of something Satan would do
@NyabinghiD For well educated person you seem not so interested in fact other than those that fit your view of history anything else is worthless to be view cause it don't fit your interruption so happy sailing in your rose colored world
@NyabinghiD Well you need to education in to the history between the English &amp; the Irish cause from your comment you know very little. One more thing check out this book "The Incredible History of God's True Church" by Ivory C. Fletcher about those who inhibit Europe &amp; from they came from
@NyabinghiD Why are so closed minded to info which my give you a better view of African. Are you saying Egyptians were the same as those of Nubia as being black
@NyabinghiD So using a term like that gets you upset you must be one uptight people cause e you think I'm white but What I'm is mixed person like over 45percent American. For your info I didn't call you boy wascyse it as a term like "WOW" so you are fast to jump to false conclusions
@NyabinghiD What do you know of this two empires Mali &amp; Songhai &amp; of theTrans-Saharan trade routes or Nubia empires of Kush
@NyabinghiD It was not the color of their skin but the group that were from The Irish were not valued very highly by the Ebglish. If you were to check old records for those time you might find an African slave was more than an Irish bond servant which you seem to have little knowledge it
@NyabinghiD Well you,need to upgrade you knowledge of what Irish bond servant real mean at the time in history your books in school real did not give a true picture of those people
@NyabinghiD Education is can cost alot or as little as going to a library or going on line for info all around all the or the taking. It's just all up to person what they desire to learn from it or not.And where does all knowledge from is one source God
@NyabinghiD Well on the other side of the market those who sell those drug which get people throw in jail for have created a job market which promotes such criminal activities &amp; who is caught in the middle the user of these drugs. The drug dealers find the user &amp; start for free drug
@NyabinghiD Really boy you may be one intelligent person but is some way you have a real racist attitude you complain about whites are in total control but in someway that way of think is similar to many others like Hilter, Stalin ,Mao &amp; many others.
@NyabinghiD Here a little know fact the first record interface married between a black &amp; white was 1565 in St Augustine between a free black woman &amp; Spaniard
@NyabinghiD You need to Google about when Europeans gotinto slavery there interesting info on it you might look at to add to ever ending view on how African ended up in the America's
@NyabinghiD Do you know how long this drug been going on &amp; when it started
@NyabinghiD Well if you look back at history the Muslim ruled most of African till Europeans start expanding in the 1400's so you need to updated you historical studies
@NyabinghiD The facts of why African slaves were original brought to America was to help upgrade the Irish bond servants who were the first white slaves other than Native American if you did know that then you education it ever incomplete in someway you been brainwashed
@NyabinghiD Well need to look back in time for there were whites slaves which were valued ever highly in many placevin African &amp; Asia especially white women so you need to go back really look at historical records before the 1800's
@NyabinghiD Well do you understand why we have the laws we use today?
@NyabinghiD Well you need to do some research cause where do you the biggest slavery markets are alive an well guess were in African in seem you talk a lot about the present but know little about what's happen in the present
@NyabinghiD Yes your right about that but most committed crimes against people of their own race &amp; people of their own neighborhood so how do you explain that kind of behavior against neighbors who are of the same race
@NyabinghiD Boy that was a mouth full but how do you explain all the barbaric murderous thing that are going on in African since Africans have take control since the 1945 to present
@NyabinghiD Well its at least pays &amp; allows them to have some outside jail time even though it's restrict look at what was available during the 1950's to what they have now to me to me it mercy pay to those who committed criminal acts
@NyabinghiD Well the Arabs had a very great influence on Africans they where very big into slave trade &amp; conquer the world for Islam so before jump on European start with those who call themselves Muslim &amp; how they had a great impact on African than any other group to include Europeans
@NyabinghiD Well from that comment you seem to know nothing of African history my suggest is you go back to more study on African kingdom before the 1800's
@NyabinghiD Well you need to study African history for there are two African kingdom you help promote slavery in which most of Africans who came America shipped from so be careful about pointing fingers
@NyabinghiD Well question to you is why do we have laws in the first place? Even God has his laws which require penalties to be paid. Man's biggest crime was allowing his wife,Eve, to take fruit form a tree &amp; what was his penalty Sin whine he passed to the rest of us so we're paying too
@NyabinghiD Well that's one way one of looking at it but there is cost which are never retrieved from criminal activities like the replacement of a human life or the emotional could t which victims go through so the wages paid to those in prison is mercy pay
@MxTX @TheCypherPod Boy are you a real piece of work a rapper who is to confused or is it no commit to nothing but to self center individual like yourself
@TheCypherPod Do you say the same things like this about black rappers who promote similar things but it from the black view but in some way it is also a form of racism as how racism is defined

@AncestralVoices Question where did the woman come from biological it takes two parts to make a human not one only some bring up this question who was made first man or woman? If the woman is made first where the man come from for without man there it on children so that statement is half truth
@NignemesisB Well one could say God is the thought that created all things that are made
@QueenOfGeele Question for what attract a black woman to a man of another race white, Hispanic or Asian same goes for black men
@KingmakerI Would kind of conversation would have with a black or Hispanic business owner as to how would bring a person of any group in to their business or would treat them the same you treated that white business owner in some ways is what is defined as racism which mean you are racist
@NyabinghiD Well historically poverty has always been with mankind as long as man has been around &amp; has been blamed as long for why people commit violence against other people so you comment is a pipe dream that will only end when God ends it
@NyabinghiD Well till people stop committing crimes &amp; using all kind of reasons why they commit the crimes
@NyabinghiD @drboycewatkins1 How you pay something to people who no longer around
@RepCummings That test is not a lie detector a polygraph can monitor blood pressure &amp; can be fooled that is why it is no longer used by the legal system as a valid method of determine whether someone really truthful when answering question
@AtheistRepublic Look this book up "The Incredible History of God's True Church" by Ivory C. Fletcher it add some facts about Scythians who the Celts, Saxon, &amp; Scots which now inhibit Britian it has be infered they be those of the 10 tribe conquered by the Assyria back in 722-718 B.C.

@KamalaHarris If you say the federal government failed the people of Puerto Rico does that include yourself being being a member of Congress who determines how to fund such issues. One thing you failed to talk about is what has the island government respond to helping their own people
@KamalaHarris Have you ever checked out the rules govern those who drive trucks
@DianaBa33008078 @WWBlondieDo @ginnybeesly @mj_lee Well the fairness you speak of has already flown out the window all one has to do is look at the major media &amp; most social networks and it has become one big circus with the crowd watching who will be eat by the lion
@ginnybeesly @WWBlondieDo @mj_lee One must remember this is not a criminal hearing so there are different rules in place here
@mj_lee Well this matter should have been handle back in July when Seen Feinstein became aware of this allegation but she waited till a week before the final vote to confirm the nominee to get this allegation released. If Ms Brown was so concerned about this why hide
@george_capen Well if your talking about the Kavaugh situation there is a problem with it it's 36 yrs old, the victim has told different various of the event to different people. This situation has no good evidence trail to follow &amp; no federal laws have been broken &amp; no request from local

Heat like we can not ignore laws
@Drewdferguson @artist4ever @realDonaldTrump Well as President his job is to insure the laws which Congress passed is correctly done &amp; not ignored as they were during the last administration so tell me what has he do to not fulfill what the Constitution played out for a President to do their job

@Digit911 @realDonaldTrump You need to go to Article 4;section 3; paragraph 2 &amp; read as to who is real responsible for Puerto Rico recovery

@steelsnowflake1 @KamalaHarris Well if you when for a job &amp; they want to know ever decision you ever made before decide whether to hire you would you consider it normal or a bit over board
@KamalaHarris To me by your action to promote this your are violating  your oath of office which swore to uphold the Constitution which at this you have been violating action at the hearing to me is a revolt against the Constitution &amp; a betrayal ofvyour duties as a US Senator

@JackPosobiec The Democrats have turned this hearing into a full revolt against the Constitution which mean their action could be interrupter as a betrayal of the Constitutional duties &amp; to me an act of treason against the Constitution
@KamalaHarris Question do you relate have to have all thosevdocuments to make a decision whether this person is worth to sit on that bench he has serve 12 yrs on the DC bench can you not determine from those 12 yrs of decision what kind of judge he will be or a revolt against Trump

@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well think your wrong on one point the last time we had no war was just after the end of World War One as for our country we've had wars our whole history do you know what the longestcwar we were involved in gin it last over 350yrs it end at the beginning of the 20th century
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci The point is unless you have walk in the boots of those who put their lives on the line everyday don't bevsuch a complainer about a budget to help insure our military has the best so they can do the best job to keep or allow you the pleasure of complaining about future issues
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Since 9-11 are military has be require to do is to fight two major conflicts &amp; a whole lot of smaller ones &amp; they due their job with ever little fanfare they do it as volunteers so why complain if what do today keep the boggie man away out of our backyard
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well from my experience the military has gone through many ups &amp; down between 1972-1993 the day I served ending of Vietnam war; end of the Cold War; War on terrorism; down sizing; many conflicts; last Desert Storm 1 so from there military missions change all the time
@SenWarren @AFSCME Question is where does the funds come from to fulfill the contracts made with union they have to come from somewhere question is where can you answer that question?????
@SenWarren @AFSCME Well unions dud change a lot of things but they also have some how cause some cities to go under because of the demands. Unions of state &amp; city workers have benefited greatly but in doing so have push states &amp; cities into increase raves to fulfill contract which taxpayers pay for
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well to me it is probably the best deal for the money if one looks at what you get for it &amp; I should know you are getting a very good for the price spent 20 yrs doing that job defending this way of life so people like you can complain all you want last thing you done for the USA
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well add this up you have 2.5 million person military &amp; they are oncall 24-7 365 days a yrs so how,many manhours so where else could you get a deal like that &amp; most of the cost if the,military budget it for equipment, maintaining it, parts,fuel &amp; personnel probably plus extras
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well how many manhours would you say our military puts in on those type of projects
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well if one looks at what God expects from us in reality one can never really put a true dollar value on that kind of help no matter how one trys to calculate it
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Yes but if one look counting dollar amounts can never be measured how can one put a value one worth as to work one contributions to help better someone else's life
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well that's just the dollar value not all the manhours that is put in on the efforts have your ever ask why the military is one the first to be ask to help in these efforts
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Got those number of site found on Google
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well our military does many different function from defending to wide varied of humanity duties
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well they may be nit but they are representatives of our country &amp; are defend by Marines so in someway it is a type of military base not in the normal way of thinking
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well the Russian know how to play chess pretty good so don't underestimate them
@LindaForAmerica Luck we live in the country we do cause if it had happen any place else in the world those who spoke may be in jail or worse just think of China or Russia or may be North Korea

@Animals4Bernie Here is something for you to look at how do we elect a President ; one popular of each state which determine who gets the electoral vote. So you need to go back look at each state as to who won the popular vote then might get the ideal of how Trump beat Hillary

@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well those agreements like NATO have kind if keep the world from going to a world war like the first two but we still have many smaller conflicts but no big one which would wind up destroy all we have now
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well it properly the same reasoning behind why we have embassies all over the world
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Since you've study this area did you ever study how those men were ablebto come up with the Constitution that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Quoting from the document that set our nation on it course but it was just the start now what's your thoughts on the Constitution as to how it has help bring those ideals set down the first document
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well we fought a Civil War in which the slavery issue was settled not had that kind of slavery since now we made progress in other areas to now our Constitution set in place a new ideals of how men would act toward each other which is still a work in progress do you agree or not
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Think your info on Utah might be off from what found Utah has both army &amp; air force guard units where you get that info about Utah
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well think you might be a bit of on that don't think Utah disband their national guard or reserve cause if Utah had a major disaster within the state who do you think the Governor would call up the state national guard so every state has one for that reason or others
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Where you come up with that figure
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Disagree on that the US had the largest military have you checked out how many serve in are military as compared to Chinese or Russia. Last seen on we have between 2 &amp; 2.5 million serve in all services which is less than 1 tenth of one pct now that's now much
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Guess your view of history is how you seen it but how would you view the history written in the Hebrew scriptures
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well that's great but what's your view as to how we interpret the 2nd amendment is it need reason or is not need reason
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Dud say abortion was to be not done only in extreme case
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well look up on internet &amp; that seem to be to number of women who have had abortions since Roe vs Wade decision in 1973 &amp; they have over 8million listed just for Plan Parenthood since their founding that's alot of terminated unborn
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well did not we go through a target attack of our country by forgein milita group so if we had Bo military could we have made any response or just wait for the next attack what is your view on this type of attacks that happen on 9-11
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Why does the states have a milita for what purpose
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Do you understand why there is the spending on the military as to the level
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well I am asking for view on this issue as to how 2nd amendment has change since 1787 &amp; why you some still feel it is need today &amp; why some feel it is outdated &amp; not need today
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well that's great but how were this abortion saving this women from a aerioys medical problem &amp; what was that,medical problem which required over 60million women to need to have abortion at anytime during the pregnancy please explain what that medical emergency was for so many
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci To add to that interpretion of the 2nd amendment why do people feel it is still important but others feel it is outdated &amp; of,nolonger use like hear your view
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Like to you tell me how the interpretation of the 2nd amendment has change since 1787 &amp; how we interpret today
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci A fetuses is to me in reality a human &amp; is a living beginning of all humans which should be protect for one never know what that,new,human will become but since Roe vs Wade over 60million of those new human never had a chance to blossom cause of a choice by a women to terminate
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well many thing have come in to being since those men wrote,that Constitution is one was real to look at how much our country has changed just look 1918-2018 from few using electricity to everyone &amp; from few car to 2 per family just a few of the changes more than in last 200 yrs
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci 2nd amendment was to arm military to help defend the states
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well the thing original mean for amendment has been greatly broaden to included many thing which have become more morale expected today like abortion
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci This amendment was interdicted into Congress in 1962 question which Senator introduced it Illinois was first ratifiy it &amp; ratification completed in 1964 &amp; North Carolina did ratifiy it till 1989
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well it for to do away with the poll tax or any other form which might be use to limit a person to vote as it was before we became a country &amp; sometime after becoming one thosevtaxes effected many who were poor &amp; people who owned no property of any kind to include bonded servants
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well don't think the 14th Amendment was mean to be use in that manner it was for those who were ex slave but it has been used for several case like the Chinese rights but still think abortion should be used only in extreme case not for unwanted pregnancy as most have been for
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Yes but they left one party out of the discussion that part was the unborn child so how can someone who see unborn speak they can so we depend on the mother but that has been prove wrong decision most abortion were perform cause women did not want to be pregnant
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well that good but the Constitution was written in 1787 &amp; ratification start in 1788 full ratified 1791 but before it the run was run under the Articles of Confederation after indepedenence in 1783 but the articles failed so a new document was proposed the Constitution
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well if you using the 24th amendment for worm guess someone could use it for the,unborn cause they were denied do process under the law by the approve of termination by abortion so what you think
@outlawjw Well so does a rattlesnake till it strike you which means two thing if you don't get help quick your died or you have been bitten one too many time your dies
@KamalaHarris Well what racial bias are you saying that black women are facing. What I see is most women both black , white &amp; other minority women of low income face the same issues how to pay for the health care they need. Biggest question which Congress has not found answer to funding
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Here a question for you where is it in the Constitution or its amendment it says women have the right to to take away rights of unborn which allows them to terminate that unborn life
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well your right changes to are not small just as how the Supreme court has to me intruded into the legislative part of the Constitution with their decision in Roe vs Wade by implying it stop against the constitution to prohibits absorption when strike down laws
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well when the first ten came in to being there was on Supreme Court now the Court only job was to determine whether the issue that came before them conformed to the ideas set forth in the Constitution but it seem that the court has step beyond their which are defined by it
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Have you real look at how thing of certain attitudes can being about changes which effect how we live just look at the how each got our Constitution then at each amendment as to how they've effect on our everyday life's so just a small change can have big impact
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well one can see how issue of the time can influence the reasoning behind why some amendment were created then over time are over turned or repealed just as the movement to repeal the 2nd Amendment get my drift
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well if you are why did those men group those thing that are in the first amendment together in the way they did
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Wonder how much you understand how these men propose the contents of each of the first ten amendments to our constitution
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci No but when people start talking to repeal amendment thing can get out hand remember probition how it got out of control till they repeal it itwas the first &amp; only amendment to be repeal
@Cernovich Well may it is time to outback in place physically type programs back starting at pre-K all the way to children graduate from college at least we help improve with health issue related to the bad overweight issues we have from pre-K all the way to those in college 4-24 yrs

@tctoral @waltshaub Well some don't think that way may be they need to get some of those old Merle Haggard tune or some of other Olds from Franklin to chill out from all those hot political desert wind we've had these last week
@KamalaHarris Well may be you need to listen to Mere Haggard song "Are The Good Times Really Over(I Wish A Buck Was Still Silver)"

@nytopinion Change 28 to 18
@nytopinion Do you know what would happen if the 2nd Amendment was repealed it would tell the federal &amp; state government we could long have a military which mean a complete dis assemble of our present military question have you people really look at what that Amendment how it really works
@nytopinion So where does it stop once one starts this repeal of the amendments of the Constitution may be till we erase it as well which would erase the very meaning of why we call ourselves Americans so I that is what you &amp; other like you what erase American Republic
@nytopinion Well if we start repealing one part like the 2nd Amendment then next question amendment will be next may be the 1st Amendment cause how the press use it ability to use the 1st Amendment privileges so let repeal it or restate the 28th Amendment probition of alcohol as in 1919
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Yes privacy is very limited in public but the one thing thatvis to replace privacy is respect for hold we treat someone as we would want to be treated ourselves
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Question how can a private company can censor but the government can where does the Constitution say the is a difference
@sarah_siskin @SenWarren Yes but to me its sad how someone can turn a funeral into a political bashing to me takes away from what makes America great this funeral events have downgrade that image of greatness
@KamalaHarris Well tell me what the Constitution say what would stop the Presidentvfrom doing his job as describe in the Constitution
@SenWarren Well it would have been a better day if they,hidden not turn his funeral into a political bashing of Trump sad McCain farewell letter had a tone of forgiveness but the tone at his Washington service was far from any forgiveness tone so how do you explain that
@numerology018 Well since you know so much about number what number seem to have the most important as related the Hebrew scripture
@Relationship006 Question how do you relay that to the new modern woman for that saying seem to go against what women hearing today
@numerology018 Your right but to get that forgiveness one must believe that Jesus being the son of God is the path to which God use to give each person forgiveness for ones sins &amp; without Jesus sacrifice there would be no forgiveness
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well great guess if they use your pic for let say to promote some product that is involved in a criminal enterprises it would be ok with you since you can't do anything about it
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well if that is true why is there constant argue about the issue?
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci One more thing think one nerd yo really rethink what those Amendments to the Constitution real mean
@Dragynwing @RomanRube @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Real so that mean if it was you anyone could come up to you &amp; do what ever they want &amp; that's nothing you could do about it right
@MSNBC @NBCSports Wonder if this is not similar to we someone who has had problems with sexual behavior toward other is there not collusion where everyone basically doesn't want anything to do with that person in anyway
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci One more thing don't think it silly for a citizen to complain about someone intrusion into how one is been if it is the President of this country for he has the same rights as you OT me or have you forgot that as well
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Well that is good but how do it protect citizen fro citizen
@ABC Wonder have you compared other Presidents with Trump during same period

@paulkrugman Are they also checking the other parties political ads to or is it just that one party if it's only one way is that not be bias toward that one party
@Dragynwing @osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci Funny how we interpret what then1st Amendment means it seems to change all the time now it's used it ways those who wrote it probably never thought it be used like blocking someone from taking a pic. Question does that mean everything is protected by the 1st Amendment now?
@osborncorrie @PhilipRucker @evanvucci How was stopping someone from taking a pic violent that persons 1st Amendment right please explain it in detail
@Turnip2020 @realDonaldTrump Well what do you have to offer which would make mevthink your better that what trump is offering

@OliverMcGee @realDonaldTrump Question is why has the major media network &amp; leadership of the Democrats forget those words the then Seen Obama spoke before becoming President Obama &amp; attack Trump for basically saying the same thing over ten years later
@CllrBSilvester The English &amp; America have the two greatest forms of Democracy still survive in the world today
@CllrBSilvester Well if your English's you have a long history which lead up to how your government was formed compromise between the lords &amp; commoner with your Queen overseeing a referee of the two which is why you've lasted as long as you have it almost as good as our government in the US
@TEDTalks Well in another way of think for humans to continue as a on this earth we must have the joining of the male &amp; female without that joining we become extinct so there always must be son agreement between the two if not extinction &amp; any other was also begins extinction as well
@lamb_pants Well the God I know gives us two choice one of following his rule or not one could as the lesser of two ways of living so the lesser of two evils to some
@insideoutvoice Well if I know people as long as the produce are available &amp; are when easy reach they'll go for it so all tell talking in the world want stop it unless there's a threat of bodily harm include with the threat as what's happen it those third world conflict areas
@richy_mcnally If those of Islam practice their religion like others in the it would be more excepted but in their belief they are to oppose all who are non believers
@traumatic_one @DLoesch To you Luke did you earn all that fruit in your pic or are just a want be ?
@lamb_pants May God allowed us to pick the lesser of the two evils that we had to pick from or may be it was just that Trump out campaign hillary
@insideoutvoice Well that's good but the reality is being Canada &amp; US are next door so unless Canada plan to put up a wall that trade will continue
@mickeyjoe49 @lamb_pants @SegarraMyrna @EdwardAshton30 @realDonaldTrump One more thing who has scared the rich more Trump just look at who has done most those the attacks against him rich white liberal elitist Democrats &amp; Jesus scared the elitist of his what at they do had him killed using the Romans to do it keeping they hands clean
@mickeyjoe49 @lamb_pants @SegarraMyrna @EdwardAshton30 @realDonaldTrump Well if you were to look at who is real still up for the rich whites it the Democrats all one has to do is look at the policies that party pushes who wants more taxes Democrats &amp; who get IRS for more loop hole for the rich Democrats &amp; who has lied the most the Democrats
@insideoutvoice Well your right the morale environment of today has become more toxic so unless we get something to change our moral values it can only get worse &amp; by our every abandoned of God's principles the road will get real rough for future generations
@insideoutvoice Well during 2016 when Trump announce he was running for President Bo one gave him a chance on n hell of winning &amp; everyone did almost everything under the sun to insure that it would not happen so you wonder why Trump act the way he did what would have you done ?
@insideoutvoice Well when one has an opponent like the Russian one has to play in way which both parties feel that by working thing out so conflict can be avoided which no one benefits
@insideoutvoice Well the problem with that people had no other choice it became mandatory by the health care law &amp; those 30M who had no coverage still had no coverage due to the cost there were a few exception like those of the military health care re system which cost 9X less than civilian one
@insideoutvoice May be he did but the policies &amp; regulation that were add to by Obama administration was dragging on people &amp; business to improve their operations capabilities so all Trump did was remove those thing which were slowing the recover process
@insideoutvoice Yes but who are they with in school people &amp; bigger question is what are they learning school for basic edcaution is nit like it was 60yrs ago &amp; we depend on technology more now which has good &amp; bad points &amp; social media has become any ever present in kids lives
@insideoutvoice Well that's is what one would do but the one thing any business has to keep in mind if your look for different tribe partners they must be able to afford paying for your produces you produce or it may become a bad partnership at the present the business environment is changing
@insideoutvoice Well the doctor promise, Benghazi, Russian hacking in 2016, Russian Uranium deal &amp; Hillary's email hack so he told half truth on those issues
@insideoutvoice Well if all the work that Obama thing did were working as well as we told they would but it's turned out that was a half truth example health care did help those it was mean to help health care is still out of reach for many due to cost only one who benefit most insurance co.
@insideoutvoice Well if all that you say is true then from my point of view the programs if they had been working as will the said there would have still be here but on the other they were not working just wasting money &amp; peoples time &amp; energy all one had do was look to it's ever rise cost
@insideoutvoice Well on that subject if one was to look at where most kids get the education it's not from our education system but from people they associated with &amp; now days the social media networks, music, video games, TV &amp; movies so how can he be messing it up when we ourselves have done it
@insideoutvoice Well trade is a two street if the US losses so will those who trade with the US for we are one of the biggest consumer markets the world has just look at how much Canadian's trade with the US foe we have one of the longest open borders anyone has so if one loses both lose
@insideoutvoice Why you so against Trump &amp; Ford
@insideoutvoice So how is it that a Canandian
@insideoutvoice So
@JoeNBC Question was Ex- President Obama not one over the half of the major issues he told us half truths explain that
@insideoutvoice Well how could we support one that was our president who told us half truths at every turn guess who that was
@eestesx3 @Cheetahgirlcat1 @brycetache Explain how he is a traitor?
@tonyschwartz Now Trump also is possible the first person who we've had as who has promoted American values &amp; not downgraded our country to be the bad guy or said we were less than we are all one has to look what has happen before he was elected
@joncoopertweets Well may be you need to rethink about how your party is going after Trump to me is going to cost your party the,midterm election
@kcarter0912 @julesandjimbo @RealJamesWoods Well this point to you is that own is it that the last administration knew of what the Russian was doing but choose to do nothing stop their unwanted interference into our political process so why is no is speaking about those issues
@MalcolmNance Well in our republic &amp; I believe in two principles give us by Jesus " TO our shalt love the Lord they God with all they heart, &amp; with all thy soul, &amp; with all thy strength, &amp; with all thy mind;&amp; thy neighbor as thyself" &amp; he said this do, &amp; thou shalt live
@hollier_ron @MalcolmNance @DeanObeidallah @JohnBrennan @Plot2Destroy One more thing it seem people like you should not be using those type of words cause to me it only take one to know one
@hollier_ron @MalcolmNance @DeanObeidallah @JohnBrennan @Plot2Destroy Well you need to review your history we are republic based upon democracy principles as a straight democracy no but one based on democracy principles yes so we all need to relearn what that means for it seems we as a nation have forgotten that
@jnganie1 @marcorubio Well did you say the same when our last president said our nation was no longer a Christian nation or was the just silences
@hersheyhiker @Chuck_Thulhu @marcorubio May be your need to review your history of those who founded &amp; wrote the US Constitution may be you find out those men used what was in the Bible ever day of they're life &amp; did just leave on a night stand carry it in they're heart so may be you need to rethink how you live
@Chuck_Thulhu @marcorubio May be we need to apply the lessons of the Bible more in all our lives for just looking at what one see on social media makes one wonder how we've let the Prince of the Air has turned us so away from God
@eestesx3 @Cheetahgirlcat1 @brycetache Traitor to me his far from that but his talk has been just the very thing we need to bring what ha s been hidden the true reality of what the world real looks like not the feel good thing that we've been lead to believe at least from the last 8yrs to me it's a clear look bow
@brycetache Well the feel good days of Obama are gone now is the days of true Americanism with Trump
@ItsMeCathi Doesn't the White House belong not just those who think like you but to callus who voted in the last election so don't treat the rest like we don't count
@JGreenblattADL Well at least their openly express their view to me its the view of those who hide behind the academic classrooms who seem to have had the greatest negative impact on those who attend our higher educational institutions those are the one we should fear not those few white radical
@stonecold2050 What kind of person are you to call anyone by that especial the wife of a seating President it seem to me you go your manners out of outhouse of the worse kind for it make hold nose even from here over this electronic device that's how bad you smell
@EdKrassen Trump has no policy for immigration but we haves played out as to how to treat illegal border crosses just as your government has
@insideoutvoice Is that how the Canadians do justice
@Heritage And with all that mind power we as a country still have about the same property level we had 60yrs ago &amp; have more programs to combat it so what is the problem that with all this brain power &amp; financial might this issue has not change much in over 60yrs
@mikebarnicle @realDonaldTrump Well to me the way people have treated our seating president is problem as much as a disgrace or more than what he has done for to me is the first President to really stand up for what America stands for &amp; not play the feel good game as Obama did
@RealMuckmaker Question since you have info on this backdoor how they do it &amp; from other source the upper levels of the Obama administration put a hold on any action against what the Russians were doing during 2016 which brings up why did they not stop the Russian interference
@ATX_STRONG1 @GOP You don't have much faith in the origin citizens of this country to me we origin citizens sometimes have more common sense than those we election to represent us &amp; the Constitution we have is still the best anyone could have written even after all these yrs
@IanBrzezinski After 8 yrs of the type of diplomatic of the Obama administration &amp; what Trump has been speaking out about has really caught all of the old way of thinking has turn their world upside down which cause them to turn into the ever thing they preacher against bunch mad attack dogs
@Jabbadaddy2016 Here sometime to think on the Democrats have had few major losses since 1860's Lincoln election, wrong side on the Civil War,  wrong side during the Civil Right debate &amp; many other social issues to me which may end up bring down the morale values upon which our country was found
@Jabbadaddy2016 Well the foresight or lack of hindsight on everyone who only saw Hillary as winning over Trump is to me the same mistake their doing in believe in a Blue Wave for the MidTerm election people to me have overplayed attacks on Trump which is have neg effect
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Why they protest against President Trump I'd think they got enough of problem with the Muslim refugees who have turn the culture upside down with their physical assault on their women
@SiddonsDan @DineshDSouza Well don't know if that will set any records but what Ben Franklin said after the signing of the Constitution was behave start a republic now it's up to the rest of us to keep it which we have been able do far wonder what they say in 100yrs if we're still a nation
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Since you know so much more than me what your understanding of Figures of Speech from what I found it was a type of language science used by the Greeks in writing
@KamalaHarris It's not President Trumps to fix this problem it falls to you &amp; members of Congress to fix the it cause it was Congress who made the laws that the President Trump is enforcing
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Question have you ever looked at the Catholic bible compare to the King James bible have you noticed a different
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Part of my case to you is located in book of Romans chapter 1 versus 1-32
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr You rest your case well your understanding of the the Hebrew scriptures are very weak from how you commented to me on them
@KamalaHarris Well what are you doing about the homeless &amp; the drug needle problems in one of California city of San Francisco hear there was a documentary made on it showing young children walking areas where needles &amp; human waste laying all over the ground have you seen that
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr From your comments it shows me you don't take what the men who wrote the Hebrew scripture ever serious for these men were writing what was give to them from God so live your life but don't be surprised on the Lord's Day if you are turned away from his kingdom
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr As far as a Christian traitor how can one be a traitor to the one who Christian is named after being he did more for us by freely dying for all the sins of all humans but if anyone is a traitor is those betray the principle upon which Jesus followed to get his reward
@washingtonpost To me what he did was best by not expose himself to a hostile group which might go beyond just a protest into some violate act against him
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr No but if the Russian had real done all that they say they did how come the DNC said they got hacked but never let the DOJ investigation it or why didn't they but just seat back hold Hillary's email &amp; blackmail her when she had won that would of sound more like what the Russians
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Well to me you really don't know God as well as you think to me you need to go back the Hebrew scriptures &amp; study them a bit more &amp; also expand your research of those same scriptures
@ZiplokTweets What do you mean by destructive of what please give what type of destructive behavior are you looking for
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well the more I learn about the founder of Islam the more I see a mixture of Judaism, Christian &amp; Paganism in what he was preaching to those who call themselves Muslims
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr Oh one more thing your same sex thing will not fly with God if you know anything about his thoughts
@PridgeWessea @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLdr See the liberal elitist ideals are alive a kicking but from me point of view come MidTerm election they may another kick in the backside as they did in the 2016 Presidential election which they still haven't got over that just this old vets view
@buckygoldymom @melissayf79 @merlisa @RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump Those are harsh word to without any proof to back up what your puts out there. People like you sound more like a lynch mob than someone who might have some common sense about themself
@RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump Well criticize is to easy of a way to described what the last administration knew about the Russian involvement in our election process back before the 2016 election &amp; did nothing to stop it that brings in bigger questions as to what motivation President Obama had to allow it
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well think you might be a little of about saying Africans were first before European have you forgot who ruled that area during Jesus time Romans &amp; the Greeks before them so European were present at the beginning of the Christian era
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well question for as to what position does Jesus hold in relationship to this three religious belief Judaism, Christianty &amp; Islam
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well in the the Muslim Islamic belief it states one thing but they practice something different in reality
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well the true about Christian African were not the first Christian the Jews were now those of the kingdom of Ethiopia was probable the first African to come in contact with disciples of Jesus Christ &amp; first use of that term was in Asia Minor which we call Turkey now
@MarshallCohen Bigger question is there been anything linking the reason that this investigation was started for was that now President-elect Trump had culled with the Russian if not all this other activities have show this investigation was nothing but way for a political attack nothing more
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump To me you &amp; your fellow Democrats have focused so much energy on ourseating President I think you've forgotten why you were sent to Washington for &amp; come November in my way of think you're losing your war with him &amp; giving the Mid-term over to the GOP
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well in your studies how the English see the war that happen between 1618-1787
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Not correct about what?
@NRO @madeleinekearns Brings up a question where are they going get the funds to do this action at the present California is so far in dept even if the due this they'll not be able to complete it due to lack of funds
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Question for seeing you have study history how is the thing you have brought seem to me lacking meat on the bone those subjects
@chelseahandler Well how can you be so vocal about kids being killed in school but you say it's alright to kill them in the unborn kids that women carry in their just cause people like you say it's woman's body real what cold blood way of think makes me wonder what kind of people are you
@percy127 Funny how they use their in such wasteful manner I've hear that England has to me a more serious problem refugees coming in from their colonies create problem because of them not wanting to be part of the English culture boy is this how your treat your friends
@SteveBakerHW Well as one who help defend Europe during the Cold War yrs it's terrible to see how far the English's have changed in just a short time this President being in office to treat a US President with such disrespects after all the US has done to help them over the last 100 yrs
@FoxNews Well it seem that the only group of entertainer's who have express anything against the NFL anthem protest is the Country &amp; west singers nothing from any other groups but support which seems tell me only that those from that entertainment believe NFL are wrong to use anthem
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Question have you ever study the science of figures of speech
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well to me that is an example of how thevPrince of the Air tricked humans into not believe in how God made all things of this universe
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews From the point of how the Hebrew scripture paint the pic of how their people was enslaved is to me art of how God show them his mercy &amp; if they did follow his instruction they would loss his protection as did they did after 70AD &amp; wander the world till 1948 return to Israel
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well my guess their history was probably leaning toward the English point of view so you need to dig more to truly get a full picture of human history your to me your history it missing big part of the puzzle pieces
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews You need more study on your history for in 328AD the Roman Empire embraced Christian as it main religion of that empire &amp; Rome was not the main Christian center can you guess what city that was it's namecwas change to Istanbul after World War 1
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well them you know Muslims really weren't part of that trade till 700AD cause their religion was not a part of the religions of the world till sometime after 650AD so your research is abit of you need refresher in your history studies
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews No you just don't know much about history on that subject cause you were never taught anything about who was doing the work before the African slaves showed up in the 1600's remember 1492 to 1650's there were no African slaves or so few it use not recorded so go back check it
@DRUDGE_REPORT Now the city of Washington D.C. is not one of your normal cities it is the only city in the country which is funded &amp; the US Congress has alot to say about it cause when it was found the first Congress put it in the Constitution as who was responsible for it
@morningmika @realDonaldTrump To me Trump is the first American President in a long time who has actual stood up &amp; told the European leadership it's time for them to start shouldering more of defend themselves they've been putting most of that responsible upon the US for almost 70yrs political correctness out
@TheEconomist @sarahditum A thought for you the day of judgment is getting ever closer &amp; on that day The One Who Created all things will open everyone's books of life &amp; decide welter to let one into his kingdom or send one to the Lake of Fire
@RealJamesWoods The only way the players willget the message about their action if the audience which pays to watch these games stop going &amp; stop watching these games for without someone to watch these games will mean loss of revenue for the owners which mean lack of revenue to pay players
@SenWarren Why not read that crystal ball &amp; tell the people how you vote for amnesty for million of illegal border crossers
@CyrusMMcQueen Well if look at how Germany made a backdoor deal with the Russia bypassing not let any of the other members of NATO in on this deal Germany violated rules govern those who are members that organization so all Trump did was exposed it to Putins bad nature
@johnlundin To me for you,to use Pains quote to justify why you don't talk with someone who supports Trump to me that quote also may apply to you
@RevJenButler @FaithPublicLife To me both you &amp; White are total of the mark when using Jesus as a refence for this immigration problem your both speaking on my advice go back to the scriptures &amp; restudy them
@BevHillsAntifa7 Well from the video the first thing they made mistake of try to block that driveway &amp; second it seem that driveway was entrance &amp;exit to police facility &amp; next police request them to unblock the driveway they seem to refuse &amp; that gave the police all the authority to remove them
@Clinton6one4 @Megan4MAGA @ROHLL5 @jojoh888 @grizzlemeister @ChristieC733 @ArizonaKayte @SandraTXAS @StacyLStiles @MareLoves_USA1 @MAGAGwen Wonder did you report this to your local law enforcement to check out where it was local or welter it was sent from within the state you live in or from outside the state
@Twitter To this "Twitter" user to me it seem Twitter has a double standard if some makes comments about whites there's no abuse but it someone makes comments about black, women, same sex, transgender or another minority group it seen as abusive so the question why the double standard???
@thehill What did President real do to help improve the image of how American see themselves &amp; how the world saw American. One thing I hold against him is his down playing the CItizens ristian values upon which those formed the country on &amp; how he say American was no longer a Christian?
@MorganStanley Bigger question to be asked is why has the India government not be purse the need changes to bring that type of technology online to help change how they can change how people think which will help change their environment they live in
@KamalaHarris Question how is that a woman is making a decision which effect an unborn person which mean that woman is sign a death sentence for the unborn people which they ability to speak for themself has been taken cause people like you say those unborn are unimportant to live
@ruidh Well yes they have alot of underemployed workers works at one tenth the wages of most Western nation &amp; the capitalist thing is partly true cause the Chinese government has a hand in all board decision every Chinese company makes but their government still has final say over all
@ruidh Well they don't have to use military anymore the use their economic power to over come their oppenants now which is more efficient. Now what think of Germany backdoor NG deal with Russia
@ruidh Well like I've said if conflict hits any those place all those goods we have so use of getting at cheap prices will cost whole more do to shortages &amp; if China continues to take over those vitall resources we will be at their beckon call how you explain that?
@ruidh Well yes it bring in cheap price but over all it put us in situation which if there was ever major conflict in the area where these products come from would no long be available to us &amp; since we no long produce them it would put consumer between rock &amp; a hard place explain that
@ruidh Los the two biggest enemies of WW2 are two of the biggest economic power house today cause the US help rebuild them. How you explain that strange turn off events
@ruidh One other thing have you ever wonder how the Chinese were able to move so fast from what the where in the 60's to what they are today in 60yrs they have completely turned around the economy how from my point get us to get in to their demand &amp; undercutting us till now
@ruidh One more thing we use to have a very strong textile industry but now it has almost disappeared for very few textile are produce in the US &amp; also effect the labor market in the those areas cause of trade deals allow US business to move operation to cheaper labor countries
@ruidh No that's no what I'm say but if you look at how what use to be produced in the US is no long be done here make one see how trade deals can have a bad effect in areas we pay little attention to &amp; put us in position which can change our ability to function in those areas
@ArmyTopKick @paulkrugman No that party is still very much alive may be more so now than in past yrs cause they did given in to all the big talk the Democrats had instill showed how to kick the pants of an over bearing bully
@paulkrugman Question when you do you contract for your job do you just sign off on anything you employer want to give you or do you work for the best deal for yourself &amp; still give those wish to hire you what they want well over the last 40 yrs we give away to other &amp; got little in return
@MalcolmNance So you think given away our advantage to China &amp; others countries is the best for the citizens of this country &amp; you say what Obama did to downgrade our way of life is also good &amp; one more question how did his way help improve the black citizens of this country
@markchildress @NAACP @flywithkamala Well don't think she'll get that job after some of the comments she's made &amp; to me the Democrats have over play the Trump card too much to the point that blue wave may hit a big Red storm wall this Midterm they already lost one big New York player
@FlapjackMcTavi2 @deuceohsixx @NAACP Why are you using a pic of Chuck Norse with a chicken bucket on his head that's very unflattering to a man like him
@Cernovich One more thing I'll pray that. CBS &amp; Showtime CEO's may receive visitation from their maker that this program may bring the worst ratings they have ever had for any program the have produced for the Prince of the Air is seating next to them at their dinner table
@Cernovich To me if they did what Palin is say they did as a veteran for someone to misuse the image of disabled veteran in that way is one of the most disgracefully disrespectful &amp; dishonest thing anyone could do &amp; anyone associated with it needs to be tar &amp; flag run out of town on a rail
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews And just who did they focus their religious hatery on mostly Jews so where does that fit into your think on this issue
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews You need to study history more as to how the Irish were used before African's came to America &amp; what Native Americsm tribes also owned slaves &amp; many other things in history which were left out of the history books
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Which whites groups are you speak about on the subject of Native Americans
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well the African first become enslaved by the invading Muslims around 700AD then the European start using them for the Americas around 1600's to help bring up the value of the Irish which had been use for about 200yrs where do you thing the light colored skin blacks came frm
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well it seem so did many religions as well even the Muslim put a type of tax on all nonbelievers to me the only thing it comes down to is when come to judgment God will have the final say on who he will save &amp; who he will throw into the Lake of Fire
@rafandrews @steelspace @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Where does it say slave is wrong let say in the Bible I've never come any verse saying slavery was wrong give me some verse you have found that it condemn it
@asixtyschick @yonnie2212 @funder Well to me the same may apply to that Congress member who promoted violent verbal assault against members of this administration
@renalds_angela @yonnie2212 @funder Well do think it proper for someone of who seats in a seat Congress to call for citizen to verbal assault someone who are working in a position in the WH? What would your response be if it had been done during the last administration?
@KamalaHarris Question for you OS how do you deal with those who illegally cross our border no make what their age?  It's no different how we treat our citizens now matter what their age. How your feeling of putting the very young citizens into the social system &amp; young adult in YDC facities
@lesly_lila Just be glad you not in one of the Muslim countries or they be locking you up for your speech &amp; the way you are dressed.  Notice your in England but also notice that your leader are bowing more to the Muslims every day so it may become just like Iran where Islam rules
@WorlMedia Wonder how those within that Muslim community see what that women did to her husband welter they will condom the husband for rape of his daughter or condemn the wife for burning her husband guess the leader of the Islamic religion will have tough choice to make who's more wrong?
@charliekirk11 Why you looking at Hillary why not compare Obama appointees to those appointed by Trump cause only someone who seats in the Presidential position can appoint Federal judges
@MikeyCanzonetta @Sta1tOfLiberty1 @jerialknight @paulajarvis69 @ArmedAndPatriot @MichaelPata @DanJobby @Pura_Vida_Tica @SardonicaRex @FoxNews @POTUS What you get those Granny's for?
@SethAbramson Well the I've have fir you is why are you only speaking about Trump &amp; not question why they never investigated the "FAST" which happen under Obama or how they cleared the Obama administration of the lie they created over Libya event so why they picking on Trump so much?
@Macktheknife16 @MichaelPata @EversFam @caramastrey @MikeyCanzonetta @DanJobby @Pura_Vida_Tica @SardonicaRex @jerialknight @FoxNews @POTUS If wonder what Hebrew scriptures are its the books written the people who God pick to get his message out in the books we Christian call the Bible
@Macktheknife16 @MichaelPata @EversFam @caramastrey @MikeyCanzonetta @DanJobby @Pura_Vida_Tica @SardonicaRex @jerialknight @FoxNews @POTUS Well here's something to think on do you believe what Hebrew scripture say about how we are going to get into God's kingdom &amp; if where we would end up if we don't?
@JoeFree76 That cartoon could be used by every President before Trump so why didn't they making such a big deal about Trump guess the liberal still can't give over how he beat Hillary. Makes one wonder how long do these people hold a grudge? It's starting sound like an old time feud.
@steelspace @rafandrews @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews Well that's been true even before that time but the term racist seem to be only used by Americans when refers to whites so do have info on who coin the term &amp; the first record time it was use?
@steelspace @rafandrews @BBCNewsnight @kehinde_andrews My question is how did that term "racist" get to be such favor term of those who blame whites for everything under the sun who gave that term it's importants in the liberal arena
@KamalaHarris Question what's your answer to those who don't legal purchase gun but get them illegally what's your answer to that problem? Cause most of the gun violence is cause by those who don't by guns legally but illegal. So how do citizens protect themselves from lawbreakers?

@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost When something is told to you is bad for you do you ignore it or check it out for that being told you may be true but it's still your choice to listen or ignore the one thing the Creator gave human freedom of will which no other thing he created has
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Well seem you have your mind made up on this issue only thing can say is God will have the final say over all of us as what he will do but it is your freedom to choose how one lives
@Sabertrooth @garywaynedenny @ziad_abubeker @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Well that question can not be answer cause that empire is gone bigger question would God allow any nation to destroy what he has setup like the nation of Israel just look at what's happen since it's 1948 bone have overcome it so what you think will God let it be over taken?
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Jesus did not come to change those rules the is father set up but to fulfill as played out in the scriptures. The first Adam broke one commandment &amp; brought sin into this world &amp; Jesus fulfilled all commandments to take sin out of this world only if we believe on Jesus
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Well ask yourself this why does the Creator concerned those of the same sex that lay together in his view an abomination as he does anything that goes against those thing set forward as those he approved human should do
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Question have ever read &amp; study the gospels of the new testament they are to me a look into what Jesus &amp; his mission he had to complete so we all could receive those benefits his father had promise to his creation man
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Here's my lesson to you the first Adam &amp; Eve disobed one order got humans throw out of the garden the second Adam Jesus obedience give us entrance back into the kingdom so it's everyone choice welter to obey or disobey thing the Creator set before us to return to his kingdom
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost For me the lesson give in the Hebrew scripture are lessons give for our learning to guide us for in the end we all will stand &amp; be judge on how we lived our lives &amp; the Creator is the final judge on welter we meet his standard which he set to gain entrance into his kingdom or not
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost You speak of love but it has many forms our Creator loves all that he created &amp; made but one thing I've found he hates the life styles we human choose which go against those guidelines he has given &amp; list thrust the scripts he gave his chosen people the Hebrew
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Don't question that it just like I said the origin ideal of two people one male female was set in place but we humans have changed that ideal or in other words corrupt the original ideal of what family was to be man &amp; woman only for the two complete the beginning of a family
@FoxNews @dbongino Their calling to abolish ICE bigger question who will replace them as immigration enforcement the US military or the FBI or even the Coast Guard or even the US Marshal's office now to do away with it Congress has break up the DOJ

@RobertMueIIer From the material that been leaking from this investigation your incharge of it looks more like your chance of that impeachment is almost a nonstarter from the start this investigation seem to have been based on a political motivated document which goes against the Constitution
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost There's one thing I have against same sex is one can not bring children into this world where one has one father &amp; one mother only as far as this world today that is getting to be rare thing our Creator see as a down size of human weakness
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost The book,is not just one book but many books of a people that the Creator choose to show the world what he can do for the only if the world will apply his principle he has layout to humanity
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost No just that life style choice they are living goes against the principle which the Creator set in place &amp; Jesus came to fulfill all those principle which the first Adam failed to do as the script layout all who follow his guideline may gain entrance to his kingdom LOF awaits
@Afsaneh_J @AngeloJohnGage Well any conqueror changes the landscape of the country they conquer just look at all who were conquerors of human history some did it in horrorable ways others not as bad so research you history even the Muslims change thing making people change how they believed in God
@MSNBC Why do the Democrats want to wait after midterm election makes no sense cause Trump will still be President so guess if Democrats win more seat in Congress it will change the choice probable not
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost Question to you do you really understand what happen with what Jesus did withvhis death &amp; resurrection?
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost There one thing you left out the new covenant which was brought in by what Jesus did on the day of his death &amp; day of his resurrection in those two events it created a beginning for human kind
@_goat_queen_ @HuffPost No but like the script say the Creator has the final say on who gets into his kingdom those who don't will be jointing Satan in the lake of fire now for those who wish to enter his kingdom he has laid out a path leads or one to follow but it's your choice to follow or not
@HuffPost Well that earthly marriage of that type is ever displeasing the to our creator cause it goes guess how he designed marriage to be so they can enjoy it but one thing that it says those who partake in that life style will not be able to enter his kingdom but joint Satan in LOF
@LuminaFound We also need those who keep our interstructure up and running degrees want build or repair or serve as o becareful if all get degrees who will take care of the important thing I like food we eat the place we live in the vehicles we use

@AKBravesFan98 @peterdaou Well why are the Democrats pushing for non -citizen such be able to vote like the 11plus million illegal who now live the US how can that help but destroy our political system is that what your promoting the destruction of may be the only true Republic based Democratic principles
@peterdaou If you are a citizen of this country do you believe in the democratic process which our republic is ruled by or do your believe in how liberal elitist view how it needs to be changed to some type of socialistic system similar to that of China or Russia
@peterdaou So your agree with Congresswoman Waters promotion of attacking WH official in public thought we had rules but seem Ms Waters has throw those rules out &amp; replaced them with mob rules
@peterdaou Women protestors protesting over illegal more that over the killing of our own children in our big cities funny how illegal kids get more attention than kids who are citizens sad
@peterdaou @ZerlinaMaxwell To me it's the silent majority has set this change in motion not some right-wing group your complaining about we got tried of how those who represent had failed time &amp; time again to get things done some they elected someone who might change that that person just happen be Trump
@RepCohen From the clip on tweeter look like someone was avoiding answer the question about the sign the FISA warrant which was used to monitor Trumps political campaign during the 2016 election base on a document which has proved to be political motives bases how you explain that????
@KamalaHarris If that's your thoughts then that's sound more like your obstructing the Constitutional process which swore to uphold
@BigGCount @KamalaHarris For the begin that investigation has been faulted &amp; as far as this thing there has been no proof been show of involvements by Trump but on the other it has shown those of the Democratic party has been up to their neck involved in undermining our political process
@PrisonPlanet That bring into question who are these people who are using this type weapon to attack with &amp; where they getting these weapons also what is your law enforcement doing to track those who commit this type of crime?????

@KamalaHarris If this problem keeps up we will become like the place those people left is that what want this country to turn into a third world place of violence where people start look for a safer place to live like the one you are constantly talking about
@KamalaHarris Well you talk alot about this is issue but what are you &amp; your Democrat colleagues in Congress not working with the GOP to fix it or is it more convent to talk chaos &amp; blame Trump for doing what Obama &amp; people like you were unwilling to fix this during his 8 yrs in Office
@RepAdamSchiff Well question Trump did create the illegal problem which the last administration made worse with Obama EO allow illegal to almost cross our border at will which none of you voiced any oppiste to but as so as Trump start enforce the laws I've never such a mess you people created

@PaulStewartII @JackPosobiec @KurtSchlichter Well it seem you may be reading your crystal ball incorrectly may be its your family he may be end up deporting cause looks like you really don't want to live the American dream but you want to replace with something else like what the North Koreans have
@charliekirk11 Well there a way of maybe overcoming that by eliminate out of every ten people counted onthe Cenus in California two persons will be not counted or maybe split 60-40 may be an opposition
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump @RosenforNevada Your right American are tired of this issue but what most tired of is Congress lack of ability to get this problem fixed it's not President Trumps problem but yours &amp; your fellow members of Congress to fix this problem which seem to have no backbone or grit to work on it why????

@NRO To all that shows is media networks like Time are not interested facts but trash news so they can sell the magazine sad how far they have fall from true journalism tradition
@juliamacfarlane Well you need to go back to the WWI &amp; serious look at what happen after war similar thing happen so it's funny how we repeat history &amp; it's funny how someone like you act so surprise by what you see cause of you lack of knowing human history
@seanhannity Well wonder they did do the same thing with his sister Jane back during the Vietnam War when sister was rubbing elbows with the North Vietnamese who were shooting down our pilots
@guardian Trump has no policy toward immigrants all he is doing is enforce law which have been ignored by pass administrations which have caused this illegal immigration problem which can only be fixed by our Congress just as your parliament has to fix your problem with those you let in
@CodyWhi13394629 @EdGullion @RedNationRising Well the treatment of Vet changed during Korean War didn't change till Dusk Storm One in someway Democrats treat illegal more like hero's than they treat those stand one front line protecting those same people sad shape a political party operates
@JoeNBC Well then if you think that way if you support another under the cover racist Obama
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you call Congress into session to speak to them on this immigration issue asking them to do the job they were elected for that your only doing what the law required nothing else to ignore this issue over the years has created a big problem we have today
@JohnMcGeever70 @realDonaldTrump There's one thing one need not forget that just how feel there are people on the other side feeling to only thing is their feel are conflicting with yours luck for us we are more civil than place like Syria were they choose violence to express their feelings
@NewYorker People like to me are sad embarrassment by their over illegal who break the law why don't they act that same way over the deaths of American children who end up in similar situation due to their parent breaking laws only difference is how they are treated which is abominations to
@PhilipRucker @NickMiroff @SariHorwitz To me Trump doesn't have policy like that but the Immigration Law does have that define within it which was placed there by Congress you need to review your facts before reporting them to be miss quoting the facts is bad journalism it down right corrupt jouralism
@washingtonpost The comment "Democracy Dies In The Darkness" is something you liberal elitist media types would come up with to me it is your type of reporting is what is killing what we common folk call democracy pat yourself on the back for doing such a good time job of killing American way
@1Romans58 Well your right this liberal thinking company the reality of the real business world has finally catch up with them &amp; wonder what cities &amp; states their closising those stores in &amp; also looks like the southern states are benefiting
@washingtonpost Why are you not reporting the whole story on this issue or is it just your paper only want as half true story cause it sells or is it you hate this administration some much you don't care what you print as long as it makes Trump look bad if so your betray what you stand for.
@KamalaHarris Question do you same the same thing about all law breakers of US law even US citizens or is it just illegals who have broken our Immigration laws by illegally crossing our borders with children if this is such a big issue with is Congress not doing it's job to correct this law
@jorgeramosnews @realDonaldTrump Question to you what do you think if that mother broke Mexican law they wouldn't have done the same thing so why not really say why it happens cause they broke the law which no one likes but if has to be enforce only Congress can change that law
@kurteichenwald Question do you think that much also for the American you break laws &amp; are separated from the family just like this illegals who break the law by crossing our border illegal or is it just you don't like someone who enforce the laws like Trump
@charliekirk11 Yes they gave out driver license to illegals but it still does not make them US citizens which is one of the requirement to vote in that state as in all area within the US states &amp; territories &amp; the big question is how is that state keeping those person from voting?
@LadyThriller69 Obama to me is an example of how the overall black leadership in this country has failed to bring blacks into compare with all other groups within this country as I see one problems is blame game not taking responsible for failing improve black lives in all areas
@washingtonpost You make this illegal issue such a big issue but what about American families who have live fact of lost of family member do to violence which cause separation by death or jail you stories on this issue is lacking sad how illegal are more important than your fellow citizens
@ItsLisaRice Well there were also low income white who were in the same boat as your mother. In the late 60's blacks &amp; whites in most the south were starting to go to the same schools. Do you know what I've notice in the last 20yrs is an increase in separation between whites &amp; blacks why???
@KamalaHarris Question for you have you research why Mexico allows those who travel from countries south of them to cross their country knowing they going cross into the US illegal but do nothing to stop them at their southern border
@jayMAGA45 There many who fight for this country values some of in far away land &amp; in this ever land as fire fighters, police, border agents, FBI agents or even plane old security officers so we have many who protect us &amp; sometime give their lifes doing that job so honor them this day
@MilkboneMan Never has there been such a nasty bunch comment ever been leveled again those that have resident in the WH wonder why their common sense has taken a backseat to this craziness that media &amp; entertainment taken such irresponsible attitudes makes me sick how we give them such stage
@TheEconomist How do you compare how the Chinese fix their finical problems being their economy is under almost total government control to one like the US economy which has some government control
@mikewagles @CaroleAlways45 @ConservaMomUSA Well that pic can also mean something related to a computer like may be Deport a port on ones computer so one can interpret that pic any way your want to just how people see how police do their job so becareful how on interrupts what one sees
@kurteichenwald Well comments like that to me is your little insane yourself by focusing so much of your energy undercutting anything Trump does or says which might try to make American proud which we have not had for a long time we need after 8 yrs of being down played
@realDonaldTrump To you be wise with your words for word can be either your burst friend or your worst enemy. As it saysin places a wise person choose their words wisely but a foolish person never thinks before speaking so which do you wish to be a wise one or a foolish one???
@TalbertSwan @yaswanth__nunna @realDonaldTrump To be one says he is Man of God &amp; speak in such manner makes me wonder where you get your ideas from those comment seem to me come not fro God but Satan for he would be words he would speak not ones God or his son Jesus would put forth so who do you stand for God or Satan
@JackPosobiec Well both have equal importance but today we've kind of allowed a breakdown in what those two things mean in old times it was truly define now a days we've muddy those waters with single &amp; same sex parenting
@tripgabriel Sad but it's no hard to see pic like this than see a child killed by a drive-by shooting in places like Chicago so sad but till the laws change that is how thing will be along our southern border for those who choose to cross illegal with children separation as laid out in law
@tripgabriel May be what you call the nuclear option is really what the laws says the border agents have to do when arresting someone who crosses our border illegal with children strip have d but Congress pass these laws now we are now enforce them if there going to change this let Congress
@Chicago1Ray Big question here is how was this person able to get hold of the deputies weapons &amp; that department will have to review their proceeders how they moved prisoners to insure events like this do happen again so another officer will not loss their life IBM this manner
@sppeoples @FrankLuntz To me if Congress what us to have any kind of immgrantion laws it will have stand up &amp; get a backbone stop being ones with yellow strip up their back either standby the laws or resign we can not have a no nothing do nothing slick willies in our Congress
@NRO You what's even sadder is how you report this stories how make this who break our laws the villain
@NRO The only way that family separation will stop is those who choose to cross illegal into the US stop crossing illegal &amp; do it legal for the law is clear on this matter only Congress can change the law to read different till then the law must be enforced sad but true
@GaiaTacita Big question what would have happen it was a normal white Brit who hit a officer would the judge be so easy on him
@KamalaHarris What's the different between US citizen who get separated from do to being jailed &amp; illegal who illegally cross the border with children but why make such a bigger issue over illegal but not US citizen explain that if you would
@SenWarren Well is that how you feel when a US citizen get convicted of any crime &amp; the have children they have to go to jail which separates parent from child so why are you making such a big thing about illegal who also break the law explain that if you would
@KamalaHarris Question to you why did you &amp; those of the Democratic party not push this during the 8yrs of Obama administration?
@marydalygervais @thehill Well Obama did take a photo with the leader of the Nation of Islam to me is one of the biggest racist type organizations similar to the KKK so how you compare that with what your saying
@marydalygervais @thehill Well Obama administration had quite a few thing but nothing like this US-NK summit so the biggest photo op was him receive that Nobel Prizes for what people thought he might do but never did
@thehill Well the quote may have be made by someone fro a group which did bad things but the quote is something that describes what those in social &amp; network media seem to practice alot especial against our President Trump &amp; by ignore it you are doing what the Nazi did to their people
@realDonaldTrump Why don't develop an ecnomonic zone which would include everything within North, Central &amp; South America similar to what the European have &amp; form a law enforcement agency to cover the same area to deal with drugs &amp; other similar problem
@DailyCaller Well looks like those three neighbors were able to agree on one thing may be there hope for the future after all
@mitchellvii Well if you look back to the Obama administration DOJ that problem was just as bad so why are you so surprised by what's happen now? Start with the FAST program &amp; all program to include the Russian hacking which let to the Mueller investigation
@USATODAY May be they need to look at the all that happen during the Obama administration you might start with FAST program which one border agent was kill with one the weapons from that program or are you afraid of the liberal backlash?
@USATODAY Question are they also looking into how the investigation on the Trump-Russian connection got started &amp; the info use to me that investigation has turn into one of the most screw up thing we seen I think it may be worse that the Hillary Email investigation.
@nikkihaley @USUN Hear that one of the African nation is banning Islam has any of the Islamic nation brought up that issue in the UN ?
@democraticbear Last thing in the old day people did like Outhouse BS they would tar &amp; feather those who offend they &amp; run them out of town on a rail but we've become to civil for that so people like you use social media now to tar &amp; feather anyone you seriously dislike boy how times have change
@democraticbear One more thing we need more fresh air info not so much BS info
@democraticbear Well compared to how you liberal elitist Democrats control the media today it might be a refreshing take on how info is presented not the twist crook way you people look at it that just this old common American retired military USA SSG see it
@democraticbear Well one thing about Washington worker environment it is not a right to work one but work under one administration but will be let go as another administration comes to office or if the new administration likes that person they will keep them till they nolonger need them

@Dwarb5 Brings up the question why have the citizens of that area not put pressure on their elected &amp; law enforcement to get answers as why has this problem continue to haunt them &amp; if those in power have igboref this issue then vote them out &amp; put someone who will solve this problem
@Citi Well guess your bank will stop doing business with the all Federal &amp; State government cause they allow many to sell &amp; own fire arms who are under the age of 21. Just wonder how your stockholders like that when you have to lose your ability to operate without that business
@Citi Is your banking going to stop doing business with the US government as well with all military members question what kind of business logic is behind this decision on this gun issue to me what "Dwight Light Zone" did that decision come from
@Citi Well your decision on the gun issue may got your corp earnings hard so to me it may cause more hardship for your stockholders &amp; why not go after cars, drugs or knife items as well since they also kill people at just at a high or higher rate than guns. Where's your common sense?
@Dwarb5 Question is it know who is behind these activities
@TEDTalks @Eve_Abrams Question for how would you punish people who break law one might put in place to keep order
@NickGriffinBU Sounds like you legal system is giving those ignore of your laws a pass sad bigger question why don't you English citizens start using your voting power to change that
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Why do you think it's strange for someone to get excited about growing something from a seed or raising livestock which benefit others to me you really have alot to learn about those who understand God &amp; the things he made for man
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders You need to really rethink that if our farm economy collapsed our whole way of life would start collapsing starting at the bottom working it's way up to the top. Start with shortage of basic foods increase food cost then food riots ever see movie "Total Recall" extreme example
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Well hope we never have another Depression like the one of the 1930's &amp; if we did we probably would not recover from it cause we don't have the same spirit our grandparents had we become to depended on the government &amp; our self discipline &amp; lost spirit which made this country
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Yes your right our country has become more of a high tech &amp; service economy &amp; our heavy industrial has slow disappearing just look at textiles &amp; green energy equipment industrially jobs where they go oversea so we've changed but at what cost simple jobs have now disappeared
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Another thing for you to think about a farmer today has to have more education than may be you have to run a farm. Farming is a very diffuclt &amp; high tech business today nothing like what one would think have you every look into what it take to start a crop &amp; farming is a 24-7 job
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Well when mechincal farming decreased the need for labor &amp; many when looking for jobs. But industrial jobs where mostly low tech very little schooling need but now industrial jobs now require allot of technical schools now. That requires a person to be educated at all levels
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Your right but need one not forget what happen during the time of WWI those who farmed over farmed which let to what created the Dust Bowl yrs in which many of farmers of the Plain states left the land &amp; many bad farming practice destoeyed thousands of acres which was lost.
@realDonaldTrump Well Mr Trump be thankful the man up stair has blessed you with health for most people above 65 are not in as good as health as you or me but it looking us old people are doing better also than some young
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders One more thing farming is now big business to have you every looked into what it takes to farm today &amp; it is one business that really is at the mercy of the weather &amp; one bad season can wipeout a farmer
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Well what that program has done is changed our country from agricultural employment to industrial one. Today we have only faction of the farmers we did 60yrs ago which mean one farmer farms 100 times more acres to support every growing population &amp; decrease #farmers every yr
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Yes but like any good think from the government there's a price. Over regulations has slowed economy growth which in turn created a subculture of over depends on government funded projects which foster over depends to the government by people who lack desired to work
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Well do you really know what makes the American economy works &amp; why it has been one of the most successful when many others have failed
@politico @AP Well at least they can't put the blame on NRA cause no gun was used to hold a whole cities hostage so what kind of response will liberal Democrats give now &amp; what kind of protest will they have since guns were not involved in this events
@Kris65547155 @JoeNBC Well don't give Obama credit for that one could lay that at the feet of Syria's top man &amp; the Russian top leader for starting that fire. The only thing Obama did was try to put it out with water pistol when need a fire hose
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Question what kind of work do you do anyway &amp; do you work for yourself or work for someone else
@electjohnmoser It's that the objective of anyone who goes into business to improve ones economic status as well helping improve others as well
@electjohnmoser Boy that some deep think that went into that. It makes me wonder where you come up with those thoughts
@Alt_FedEmployee As a veteran also but BRA did not put those weapons into the hands of those who commit those shooting so don't blame them why not put the blame on those who failed or ignore the ever rule to shoot those who committed the shootings
@paestSF @TEDTalks There are many different ways but in the end everything ends up in the same place
@electjohnmoser Your idea is the as old as the hills take from those who work hard to make their money give to those who don't work as hard &amp; depend on government to take care of them is not that your story line
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Your whole idea is the same old talk people have been saying for as long as humans have been around
@paestSF @TEDTalks Well if what a book to read of man's suffering just read the bivical sxriprures of the Bible
@iAnarchoCommie @SenWarren @SenSanders Well tweeter grammar is creature which doesn't conform to the normal grammar one uses to write with if look at history of grammar it has changed in many ways just look at writing of Biblical scripture it had no grammar structure just one continues writing
@TEDTalks To me what kind of disease if addiction? Next how do one classify it &amp; what type of treatment will be need to sure it. Addiction to me is like the common cold which is caused by a 1000 different kind of virus which humans have not been able to cure but have 1000 ways to fight it
@Cernovich Well if their going to drop their knight mascot they might as well change their name as well change it to the Holy church of Satan being their forgetting why the Christian when on those crusades in the first place
@wsvn Question what school was he attending at the time of the shooting &amp; why do the two brothers look so much different one looks white &amp; these one is black or Hispanic
@TEDTalks @justinbaldoni Question to when did men stop being men someone start calling men now a days girly men
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders That grand idea but to make it reality would take more than just bunch of talk which is all the present leader like all in DC do now Trump is not one of DC he is a doer not like people like Warren or others like her from both sides
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders If that was true it would have work but you idea is full of too many holes in the end it's turn out to be nothing but BS from my point of view your liberal ideas have done nothing to improve our economy which would have created jobs
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders Where you get that BS from
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders That is what the old socialist regimes use to say their people we know how that workout it didn't
@electjohnmoser Where you get the idea God was going to fix homelessness &amp; how are you going to fix it
@iAnarchoCommie @SenWarren @SenSanders Well the only problem with that way of think is workers do not work very effective which effects output &amp; quality of the product. All one has to do is look at the old USSR &amp; China
@iAnarchoCommie @SenWarren @SenSanders Boy you are piece of work don't you understand how our economic works if you did you would not speak as you do
@electjohnmoser @SenWarren @SenSanders What world do you live in the one I live in their will always be those who fall in to the homeless area for many reason &amp; the poor will always be with us &amp; when will the equality you speak of be is when the Lord's has his Day &amp; put all thing in it's rightfully place
@NRO Those countries may have development problem in that area due to the increase of Muslim refugees they've brought into the countries in the last 5yrs they increase crime against women now have no-go zones because of Muslim religion beliefs against their beliefs
@SenWarren @SenSanders Income equality is to me a mirage created by people like you which can never be accomplished as not everyone works at the same rate based on intelligence, learned skills &amp; a persons willingness to work so go ahead talk this line of BS income equality a socialist dream
@RealSaavedra White privilege is a disguise cause those who are we at we call white are mostly mixed raced people like myself European &amp; Native American &amp; the school shooting if compared to how many died from gun violence that same day would probably makeup only possible faction of kill&amp;wound
@CBSNews May be the painting has been mistake for WH spokeswoman but in reality it's Jim's mother who may have been not nice to him during his childhood so everyone thing it's represent WH Spokeswoman again it's his mother
@Gearbay @EnglishProudUK It such be treated in the same manner as that any group that goes against the normal rule of law just as your deal with the IRA &amp; not be afraid of doing what is good for your country &amp; not allowing those in government to use the issue for their own political gain
@zzu124 Question how does this line up with with God &amp; his son Jesus Christ
@tracyry43946583 @CllrBSilvester Here a thought for you to trunk after WW2 do you think you people would have allowed those who fought as Nazi SS soldiers in your country? Well to me IRIS fighters are the same as those NAZI SS soldier so what has change
@brithume If the Mueller investigation has found no collusion between the Russians &amp; Trump why go beyond the scope of the investigation if they do to me it's a violation of the spirit of the intent of why this investigation brought now it's becoming a political witch hunt &amp; media joke
@Gearbay @EnglishProudUK Well guess the French are allowing cities like Paris to be turned into pockets of third world ghetto &amp; if your not part of that group especial women you get treated very bad &amp; if they speak up they get attacked &amp; the local police to afraid to do anything isn't that all in true
@KamalaHarris Your right we need leaders &amp; they need to stand up to defend our Constitutional Rights which those who we elected seem to no longer understand what that means anymore to me it you who need to learn how to lead our country by learning what our Constitution really means
@Gearbay @EnglishProudUK Question why have the French city gov
@EnglishProudUK Question there has to be more yo this story than just that &amp; that person attacked that other person where does the police come into this situation
@CBSNews From the look of the two situation which two Russian have been attack looks like someone contacted with the Russian government is going after those who they perceive are a possible threat to those in the upper,levels of that government the past is a guide of past action by them
@guardian Question what race was the man attacked &amp; of the men who involved in the attack
@JamesDoss50 One more item the US has be an welling partner in that mix since our citizens started moving into the territories which once was part of Spanish territories starting in 1803 when bought the Louisiana Purchase, Florida &amp; all taken after War of 1846
@JamesDoss50 Well to my view on Mexico it has never real had a good foundation for any good government that goes all the way back to the Aztec who controlled most of Mexico &amp; then the Spanish,next the French last the continue Revolutionary movement which is still alive an well today
@Thomas1774Paine Well that true but it only took us 40 plus yrs to wake up before we decide our country was going in the wrong direction funny how liberalism can lull one into such a sleep state
@TheEconomist Well thatmean to me that we humans have not been able receive the next level in machine development till we come up with material which allows us to build faster operating computers till then we have to learn how to apply what we have to use programming to compensate for it
@WhiskeyMD247365 @FoxNews Don't think so if this is case can being down a President don't think so if that so then Benghazi would have brought down Obama &amp; Hillary for the part in the untrueful pic they painted of what really happen there
@KamalaHarris Have another question for you say you in a classroom teaching &amp; there was an active shoot in your hall outside your classroom how would feel about having a gun if it help protect you &amp; your students or wouldn't want a gun &amp; only have you body to protect your students your choice
@KamalaHarris Well that's great just hear one of your schools put out on administrative live for upsetting two student &amp; one parent out a class of 120 over a discussion on abortions issue what your comment on that situation???
@KamalaHarris Well that good but there's one downsize to the abortion issue how it effects our population growth since it started we've lost probably 10Million citizens which is almost equal to wiping out a city like Los Angeles. That's alot of voter not able to vote or help our economy
@Cernovich Well looks like another special election coming Congress lost another member from NY
@AUG_Chronicle Question was there an security cameras located in this apt complex if not may be its time for them to upgrade their security
@politico May be it's time for Congress to start looking at an age limit on those running for Congress &amp; wonder how many are over 75 yrs &amp; why do we exempt elected officials from an age limit when we do for every other organization but federal &amp; state elected officials why do we do that???
@KamalaHarris Well how do black women compare to black men if wanting to go that route why compare with only white men why not completely re to other groups like white women or Hispanic women or Asian women since you are compare or are you just blinded by you own ignorance
@KamalaHarris @LenaWaithe Well from what I've hear from her if that the role model you think young black women are is to what I've seen of young black women is not realistically real &amp; the View is a liberal leaning women &amp; if set next to Trumps selection for CIA they are a class below her
@TheMarkPantano Guess who's behind such a movement to me only one being that one being Satan
@KamalaHarris Question for you if you were confronted by an armed person how would you defend yourself &amp; &amp; your family
@jakaroo65 @Blackdi51264299 The only exception is military service most choose 18 except place where their leaders use young children cause they don't have enough young men
@Blackdi51264299 To add to that no driving license till 21-year-old as well
@Blackdi51264299 Well if there is a push for 21 for that the let make a requirement all thing we do be 21 yrs of age voting driving extended high school to graduate at 21 not 18 or 17 which means a person can not have a family or have a permanent job till 21 &amp; no military service till 21 as well

@Eagle102augusta Biggest question is when is the correct time to discuss the birds &amp; bees to ones kids in this age &amp; times that issue is present in all levels of our electronic communication media's &amp; most times kids know more on that subject than the parents so they have to catchup
@CBSNews It's sad anytime parents are separated from their kids but the laws have to be enforced if people don't think the laws are fair this country has a process by which laws are changed by those a the federal level are responsible for those changes

@DoctorPazuzu Yes it is but your protest was more of campaign of not allowing another from using their Constitutional right to speak which you seriously disagreed with so your protest was not a normal protest but a Anti-Constitution blocking movement you action resemble the Boston Massacre
@DoctorPazuzu You what you sound like is someone who knows nothing about what our Constitution stands for. So why do you violate someone's else constitutional right to speak their beliefs good or bad in some ways you are no better than those you are protesting against

@JamesDoss50 What you think of this idea raise everything of important which we citizen make decision be made by 21 or old person which includes voting as it was before Congress lower it to 18 because of feeling on Vietnam War

@DebraTdmbg @JRubinBlogger Bigger question that needs to be ask is how did the Obama administration allow this Russia issue to happen in the first place all I've hear is about Trump nothing about how or why the Obama administration allow this breach of national security protocols to happen your thoughts
@robinandriver @funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was a good feel good talker but that as far it goes he probably use his YO more than any President anyone can recall so as farads as working with Congress he doesn't have a ever good record even when he had the major in both houses

@robinandriver @funder @realDonaldTrump Well the Democrats gain control of Congress in 2006 then gain control of the Presidency after the 2008 election &amp; held the presidency till 2016 election so the Democrats had plenty of chance to do many thing like the immgrantion issue but the choose other issues over it
@robinandriver @funder @realDonaldTrump Yes but they held the WH which still gave them much control just look at how Obama used his position as to push his liberal agenda also you forgot the took control of Congress back in 2006 till 2010
@funder @realDonaldTrump Well if you think that way about Trump I can only guess what you Democrats response is going to be to just why your party has the answer to our country's problem after all the years your party years of control of Congress &amp; the presidency

@RepMaxineWaters Ms Waters wonder why you don't speak out more on how your states constant abilities to lose business like the movie industry seem to be leaving your state for states who offer better business environment to operate in

@SabiDaddyDoo @davidmweissman @Annakhait @GrrrGraphics @Cernovich Where you come up with that pic from makes one wonder why you have such a low opinion of yourself to pass it on to Trump that way
@jacob4kids Question what are info are they using to come up with that &amp; how can you judge Trump on just one year of office as compared to 8 yrs for the other three how can you say Obama is the best after he created the immigration problem Trump is having to deal with today
@funder @SpeakerRyan Well looks like more than half Americans would fall into that category which might include yourself
@doctorow Wonder what was your favor reading material the MAD &amp; Creep Show magazines from this cartoon you showed corrupt minds think alike
