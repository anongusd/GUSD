@joshchapman Field trip?! cc: @BobbyBump @Buffalo_Theory @DCBeerBill
@joshchapman I‚Äôm not out here riding for the seal. I think that‚Äôs a bit unnecessary. And if I thought it would associate me with these jokers, in anyone‚Äôs mind, I‚Äôd wonder what membership in the BA was offering me. Good chat dude. Miss you being in the scene up here.
@joshchapman It just feels a lot like cutting off your nose to spite your face. Would the BA be better off without Sam Adams? No, probably not. Would it be better off without that Pig Fucker Stout from the Big Boobs Beer Factory For White Men you posted. Hell yeah.
@joshchapman Particularly it boggles the mind when people get mad when BA raises the cap. First, the cap is arbitrary. But what really bothers me is the idea a brewery can...I don‚Äôt know...graduate out of craft? If they‚Äôre still making craft beer, what does it matter how much or what else?
@DanicaPost @raesanni YOU CAN ALSO TURN DOWN THE INTENSITY OF BRIGHT COLORS (to reduce eye strain) IN THE SAME SPOT! I‚Äôm naming my first child Danica Rae. Boy or girl.
@DanicaPost @raesanni God I love it when people I follow on Twitter express their contempt for a minor annoyance I share and a hero comes along with the solution.
@joshchapman And Sam Adams is a responsible company. Full stop.
@joshchapman I‚Äôve just never understood the hate and disdain for BB. Sam Adams was also a gateway beer for a lot of people who may otherwise have never moved beyond macro lager. So what if they‚Äôre keeping the lights on with Twisted Tea?
@jacobsberg Wait? Was that a woman...drinking beer...after a sporting event...and she‚Äôs not even white? Getouttahere!
@joshchapman Say what you will about Boston Beer‚Äîand maybe Koch should be out talking about the label issues‚Äîbut he never, to my knowledge, named a beer after a sex position.
@joshchapman I‚Äôm not sure I see the point of dragging Sam Adams into this. The ingredient/process argument and the BA‚Äôs inability and unwillingness to take on sexist and racist labeling are two wildly different problems.
@DavidMarcillo77 @bripruett @IanKarmel I laugh once a day at @thegissilent‚Äôs ‚ÄùI‚Äôm gonna name my horse Potassium. But it‚Äôs spelled K.‚Äù

@BobbyBump Maybe I worded it awkwardly, but that‚Äôs what I meant too. So many breweries out there quality is a crap shoot. I‚Äôm just bullshittin though.
@MoRocca @uclagymnastics You claimed a glass of water, but that‚Äôs a beer! Makes it infinitely more impressive and interesting.

On top of the nonrefundable $500 bond she paid a bail bondsman.		All because she turned around and said no when a guy smacked her ass in a bar. Just feels relevant today.
An overzealous prosecutor pursued felony charges of assaulting a cop and eventually accepted a plea to a lesser misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace. Now this woman is broke, unemployed, has to pay a fine and owes Cuyahoga County over $700 in court fees.
There‚Äôs a story early in the new season of @Serial about a woman in Cleveland who was being harassed (guy repeatedly grabbing her ass) at a bar. When she turned and shoved the guy, she was attacked by his friends and quite accidentally punched a cop trying  to break it up.

@Pat_Host @MartinDiCaro @maustermuhle Yeah...you missed my point. Which is that streets are less safe when cops cede traffic enforcement to cameras. Which seems to be the case and is evidenced by drivers running red lights with impunity unless a camera catches them. MPD needs to start pulling people over.
@MartinDiCaro @maustermuhle One wonders how DC police know the driver blew the light since they have all but given up on road safety enforcement in favor of cameras.

@FrankArgonaut @maustermuhle @RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc Me too. Good talk.
@FrankArgonaut @maustermuhle @RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc This is an argument that doesn‚Äôt really land with me, because it assumes tips are eliminated in a post-77 environment.

@FrankArgonaut @maustermuhle @RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc I come from a political background‚Äîdid it much much longer than food/bev industry, and the #saveourtips campaign has some big issues. I got a mailer with a picture of an owner, GM, and head bartender with the big ‚ÄúSAVE OUR TIPS‚Äù banner. How did that go out?
@FrankArgonaut @maustermuhle @RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc A lot of people are treating it as gospel too that employers pay that difference. I‚Äôm not naming names, but I‚Äôve been stiffed on that difference before. I didn‚Äôt make noise and I bet there are a lot of folks who also didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt because they want to keep their jobs/shifts.
@FrankArgonaut @maustermuhle @RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc Honestly man, I‚Äôm conflicted. I haven‚Äôt decided and I‚Äôm not coming at it lightly. I bartended and served for six years and during those times, I made great hourly money some nights and well under min wage others.

@inthezee @CellarmanDC I'm finished talking about this. You two are insane. Be offended all you want, I don't care.
@inthezee @CellarmanDC On the very specific charge I made of conducting political outreach in spite of their tax exempt status, there is a multitude of evidence.

@inthezee @CellarmanDC This is your problem, both of you, if you get offended by saying that cover up money was obtained through bilking people, I can't help you.

@CellarmanDC I also saw this as a flagrant violation of their tax exemption, which is why I shake my head at the notion this changes anything.
@CellarmanDC @inthezee Not calling anyone stupid. Calling the Church a bad actor.
@CellarmanDC @inthezee You're taking this in completely the wrong way. Bilking someone is fraudulently obtaining money. I didn't say con.
@CellarmanDC I saw it as sad, too, and not a reflection of the moods of individual Catholics, but as a dictate from the Church.
@inthezee @CellarmanDC I said the Catholic Church, not Catholics. It's a distinction through with you could drive a truck.
You clearly don't know what the word error means. More like human act of heroism. https://t.co/FKiusthZvh

The answer isn't to give churches more freedom to speak, it's to rescind tax exemption on these sham institutions. They're huge money sucks.

@brewnas Only real/serious candidates should be up there. It's 90 minutes. We don't have time for crackpots who can't find Syria on a map
@brewnas The debates are still a big stage, but not the influence they were when we barely had more than three networks.
@brewnas Analogies to 1992 are flawed. We live in an age of global instant communication. Nobody is being denied their right to see Gary.
@brewnas But of the two people likely to win, one is flawed, but reasonable. The other is a fascist.
@brewnas Wouldn't argue otherwise. Unfortunately, Republicans took away our right to keep good presidents by passing  22nd Amendment.

@NoseyBrewer I ferment IPAs 10-20 days depending on OG, yeast strain, desired flavor profile. Condition 1-2 weeks in keg/bottle. Drink.
@shelbinator I'd be more worried about lazy brewer syndrome setting in a 3 becoming 4 or 5 and off flavors from too long a DH.
@shelbinator Even keeping a long DH sched, you're better off in one vessel. Yeast autolysis takes longer to dev than 3wks.
@shelbinator @AllGrainBeer @NoseyBrewer ZERO reason to rack when you could a) have clear beer; b) avoid O2; c) avoid contamination. (2/2)
@shelbinator @AllGrainBeer @NoseyBrewer Bottom line--yeast won't give off flavors at &lt;4-6 weeks, and still floc hops (1/2).
@shelbinator @AllGrainBeer @NoseyBrewer IMO, 3 weeks is a little long for DH. My sched for most IPAs is Brew, B+4 DH 1, B+8 DH 2, B+14 keg.

@SweeneyABC Flight was delayed long before the emergency landing. Airlines never should have scheduled flights today.
@SweeneyABC @ABC7News Claiming they had no idea. Flyover was scheduled months ago. @usairways
@SweeneyABC @ABC7News Stranded in Philly bound for DCA. Gate attendant is lying to passengers, calling air show "an act of nature delay."
@USAirways Why is your gate attendant lying to people and calling this air show delay "an act of nature"? We're not stupid.
@USAirways You owe me $176, an apology, and an afternoon back.
@USAirways Sold me a worthless ticket. Gate attendant calling a scheduled air show an act of nature. Learn to read a calendar.
I don't understand how @usairways screwed this up. Flight should have left an hour ago. Plane's not even here.
And we've officially passed the point where it would have been faster to drive from Philly to DC. Thanks again for nothing @USAirways.

@kaitiekov @jmestepa Belly buttons.
@MillstoneCellar Great meeting you guys yesterday. Can't stop thinking about the 33.
Getting psyched for our staff homebrew day coming up soon @RightProperBeer. What should we brew? Might save a taste for our regulars.
Lost &amp; Proper is back, plus a Czech dark lager called Tmavy from @LostBrewer @beermadeclear @CellarmanDC @pete_eats @TheHubeAbides &amp; Nathan.
ICYMI last night we tapped two new beers @RightProperBeer. A Belgian-style table beer called Petit Frer, a German Gr√§tzer--The Lubitch Touch
@LostRhino Could Reed bring a growler too? Doesn't even need beer (though we wouldn't turn it down). We want to display it for guest tap.
@LostRhino Perfect! Thanks guys.
Hey @LostRhino, can we get a sleeve of coasters at Right Proper? The Lost &amp; Proper needs some swag.
@billjusino @seanldalton @Patrick_Madden Adams Morgan is crazy-go-nuts with rats, #insertjokeaboutratsvotinginwardone, seriously, it's bad.

@craftbeer Beer industry is also supposed to be "99% asshole free." Breweries that intentionally infringe on others' property are the 1%.
@craftbeer They brought it on themselves though. This isn't Starbucks being unnecessarily litigious. It's them smacking down a malcontent.
@craftbeer This is not Like the Vermonster. Nobody's picking on the little guy. The corporate coffee guys were entirely in the right.
@craftbeer If I start a brewery and brew a beer called Koka Coolah, will you call me brilliant like @Exit6brewery? What about Pepsee?
@craftbeer @Exit6brewery There's no brilliance in stupid stunts. I wish people wouldn't reward bad behavior with free publicity.

The centennial/Nelson Sauvin wheat IPA I brewed for the @HomebrewAssoc rally @3starsbrewing is tasting mighty fine. Come try it Saturday!
@LizMSuckow So cool. Joe Kittinger is a friend of mine--Stapp was his mentor. Can you post photo/scan so I can send his way?
@Brianbrewsbeer OH HELL YEAH!
@maustermuhle Cyclists should just put up with whatever for privilege of using roads, and stay out of the way of all cars, parked or moving.
@maustermuhle That's a rhetorical question. I know that one isn't yours specifically. But that's the attitude around here.
@maustermuhle I wonder what straw man NIMBYs would put up if everyone on a bike was an angel?
@maustermuhle I know. It was about parking. It's always about parking. But NIMBYs will use your same red light/stop sign argument anyway.
@maustermuhle But a driver sees a cyclist roll through a stop sign to keep ahead of traffic and it's a scourge that must be wiped clean? 2/2
@maustermuhle Why is it, whenever I complain of vehicles blocking bike lanes, it's "Something you have to put up with living in a city." 1/2
@maustermuhle Then you should move to a city with an effective police department, but that's an entirely different argument.
@maustermuhle Cyclists ask for a reasonable safety concession, NIMBYs offer irrelevant anecdote about bad cyclist behavior. #dogbitesman
@maustermuhle Never said it would. But it would make the cyclist safer for the rest of the trip. You're throwing up that old straw man again
@maustermuhle I use 11th quite a bit, and I see just as many Idaho stops from cars on that street and V as bikes.
@maustermuhle So they claim the bikers are why we can't have nice things. Regardless of accident statistics.
@maustermuhle That's an incredibly naive view of NIMBYism, in which folks cling to whatever convenient argument suits them.
@maustermuhle You seem to be arguing residents would be more amenable to bike lanes if cyclists more stringently followed traffic laws.
@maustermuhle Why even bring up stop signs? Like saying "We won't arrest someone for robbing you, because you jaywalked to get the the ATM."
@maustermuhle I'm not calling you a bike lane hater. Just saying you're using their very tried and tired arguments.
@maustermuhle Then say that. Bike lane hate isn't about safety. At least this time they can't turn it into some bullshit religious thing.
@maustermuhle @wash_cycle So every car driver has to obey every traffic law before we do any more road work, right?
