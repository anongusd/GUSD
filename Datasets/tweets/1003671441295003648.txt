4/Americans do not want to see political leaders attacking one another, especially those that agree, and they also do not want to see leaders stand by the poor actions of others. 		Time for the control of our country‚Äôs moral fabric to be put back into the hands of the people
3/It is exactly this political infighting, and lack thereof, that leads to the toxic political environment we currently have.		Americans realize the important issues and it is up to our political leaders to lead the way on all issues.
2/I do not know which is best for each political party, but in my humble opinion, I believe that the Democrats need to be a more united party that isn‚Äôt so quick to resort to infighting, and Republicans should be willing to admit the mistakes and faults of fellow Republicans.
1/To comment on the Van Jones backlash for what he said at CPAC, I would like to posit that Democrats are so quick to ridicule and attack fellow Democrats even the even show an inkling of trying to be bipartisan. 		Republicans are the opposite in that they will stand by their own
@annietheblank @_waleedshahid @AOC @SenMarkey People then follow the word and beliefs of these ideas, because it‚Äôs easier to point fingers than it is to accept faults and work to do better. People thrive in the status quo and it‚Äôs terrible for 90% of people who just want to live well.
@annietheblank @_waleedshahid @AOC @SenMarkey To a certain extent, I don‚Äôt disagree with you. Unfortunately, right now, there are entertaining people who are on separate ends of the political spectrum who point at eachother for all problems. 1/
I‚Äôd like to leave all my adoring fans with this message. Interpret this how you will.		Serit arbores quae alteri seculo prosint		He who plants trees labors for the benefit of future generations.
We need		Pluralism, not Hyperpluralism	Unity, not division	Freedom, not suppression	Equality, not inequality	Justice, not injustice	Compassion, not hatred	Help, not obstruction		As a country we need a lot of things.		We can only get them together.
Because things will begin to slip through the cracks. As a country we should be willing to see collective success and have a free and open discourse in which the best ideas succeed.
That is exactly what these kids did, and they were not looked down upon. But political sides like to create that image so they can construct a narrative that can push their agenda.		As a country we should be more willing to see our nation succeed as a whole, not in pieces.
Our government should not be so gross and so bad at its job that people are so willing to turn a blind eye. People should be so motivated by hope and progress that they have a watchful eye on all actions and take part in our political process.
Currently in the US, we have a political culture that is so willing to tear each other apart from the inside to get to the top, and to destroy opposition to get to the top. 		This ultimately results in a gross political climate that the regular citizen will hate.
Listen, @SenFeinstein was open, understanding, and fair with those kids. The fact that this is an issue is a bad sign for our political climate.		I don‚Äôt know why, but everyone is trying to be a ‚Äúmuckraker,‚Äù but they are going for stuff that isn‚Äôt there
@_waleedshahid @AOC @SenMarkey Sen Feinstein is not opposed to the GND. She made an alternate, passable bill with the same goal: save our planet. She is a public servant who understands politics and realizes this is the only way to pass such a bill. Don‚Äôt mean to repeat. Hundreds of people have said the same.
@EagletonHater the ovens ready. Chop chop. Time to get bakin‚Äô. Daddy want pie.
üëÄ Dean &amp; Abrams 2020?		If not, Abrams is an intelligent and clearly passionate public servant. Her past speeches prove her conviction and consistency in her positions. She would make a great and historical VP candidate. https://t.co/CtGhpCv8lJ
@RobinJoyous @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown That is an interesting ticket. Formidable for sure.
@chrisbrandt16 It‚Äôs not hypocrisy. I will admit it‚Äôs bad, and I do think it symbolizes the great divide that currently exists between our two major political parties. Pointing fingers, jumping to conclusions, and double standards are what add to the divide. We need to be more fair to each other
Democrats to Virginia:		Ralph Northam did black face?! He should resign!		After Northam? Justin Fairfax, allegedly sexually assaulted someone?! He should resign!		After Fairfax? AG Mark Herring also did black face?! He should resign.		After Herring? A Republican?! Maybe not...
@Michelle4NM @TJCoxCongress This is amazing.
@NoH8_USA @cornish1969 @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown I will have to look into that. Sen. Brown‚Äôs voice is just fantastic. If anyone reading this has never heard of Sherrod Brown speak out loud, please go find a clip now. It is fantastic.
@sarahd16ca @MtnManMT6 @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown Yep. I am filled to maximum capacity of excitement.
2/ I think as Americans, we need to come together and unify. One of these days the division will go too far with our division or we will need a person to bring us together and make us realize how ridiculously we treat each other nowadays.
1/ As a fictional congressman, I do not want to add to real division in our political culture, so I will not comment on divisive points of the #SOTU
@sarahd16ca @MtnManMT6 @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown She seems to have a deep love for public service. I would agree with you that she is tough, she was very hard with questions in Judicial nominations. I can‚Äôt wait to see her policies and how she fares compared to other candidates.
@KB805 @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown Interesting. I do not know how I feel about Senator Merkley. He is a chill dude. Could be a very solid VP candidate.
@sarahd16ca @MtnManMT6 @amyklobuchar @BetoORourke @SenSherrodBrown She is the Senator in my former home state of Minnesota and is such a nice lady. I am from Partridge and she is from Plymouth, but I won‚Äôt hold it against her.
@Charlie24492595 Interesting... üëÄ
@Charlie24492595 Is he supposed to be with Oprah again soon?
@amyklobuchar is going to be running for President. The fourth woman to enter the race.		@BetoORourke was with Oprah and said he is going to announce by the end of the month whether he will run in 2020.		@SenSherrodBrown is also considering a run.		üòçüòçüòç
@vinniesutra @DavidCarlucci Um. Last I checked Sen. Carlucci is a State Senator for New York, he has no control over appropriating federal funding for a border wall. Unless you are referring to a Wall on the NY-Canada Border, well, then he could fund that Wall.
@Alex_Kay_Biz Well, that is an interesting point, but if that were true then maybe he would have campaigned differently, and maybe he would not have won the primaries and so someone like Jeb Bush or John Kasich would have won the nomination. It is difficult to speculate on hypotheticals.
@Alex_Kay_Biz 1/   1.	No pre-registration	No early voting	No money to county BoE‚Äôs	These are just some		2. Well, thankfully in the US, literacy tests were abolished with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 so it doesn‚Äôt matter if I can spell or not, but I was using shorthand because this is Twitter.
@Alex_Kay_Biz 18 year olds are typically out of Secondary/High school by the time they vote in an election. 		Also, so long as a citizen is 18 and is registered, they can vote, there is no requirement or wait period to stay in school. I am not sure if that is what you are implying though.
@Alex_Kay_Biz So yes, 18 year olds tend to be more lazy and are less likely to register. Especially, b/c many now attend colleges away from where they live and have to use Absentee Ballots. The law is anchient and needs change. So I ask, why prevent or disagree w/ voting accessibility?
@Alex_Kay_Biz More often then not, when 18 year olds go to the polls in New York, they can‚Äôt vote only to find out they are not registered. On top of that we currently do not have same day registration (soon to come) and that could greatly increase turnout.
@Alex_Kay_Biz 1. It does apply and is completely relavant to the context.		2. It is not a manufactured problem. 18-24 year olds are the most politically disengaged generation and have consistently low voter turnout.
I do not want to discuss Ice town;		However, I am willing to discuss GoT
@Alex_Kay_Biz It was not always at 18, it changed from 21 to 18 with the 26th amendment following the Vietnam war. It was because those that were chosen for the draft could not vote for or against those who started the war.		This bill now would allow for 16/17 y/o‚Äôs to be registered at the DMV
