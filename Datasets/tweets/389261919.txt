@mikemayerMMO True!
@mikemayerMMO Why do I feel like the Mets are going to clean out the farm just to play meaningful games in Sept...smh
@brithume Did @brithume ever have credibility or was he always like this?
@BorisEP Your segments should be cancelled
@mikemayerMMO Good scouting by Mets

@PastorDScott Feel free to block me if you‚Äôre that thin skin?

@CubsDraftPicks @SageRosenfels18 @AriFleischer Yea, üëå
@SageRosenfels18 @AriFleischer Funny how Ari went silent once you mentioned King. Not surprised.
@joncoopertweets The answer is yes, but why didn‚Äôt Dems pass this during Obama‚Äôs first term when they had the votes??
@PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump Lmao
@PastorDScott That‚Äôs the type of response I expected from you, Pastor.
