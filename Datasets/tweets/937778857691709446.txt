@NateSilver538 What you don't seem to understand Nate, is that Bernie's support comes from his authenticity and his policy positions.  No one is out here stumping for Bernie because he's just oh so charismatic.  The average American wants healthcare and job security, thats how they vote. Smug

@mrwebber35 @KyleKulinski @DrLazy66 Sure, but hope and blind Faith in something that's contributed to the deaths of millions of people throughout history and resulted in centuries of intellectual stagnation of our species is ignorant and naive.

@Roar__Bang @KyleKulinski So centrisism is the answer? That way we can achieve incremental change? I don't think that's the way to go. 	  I don't think God exists, if that isn't already apparent.

@Roar__Bang @KyleKulinski For alot of people, they really seem to be, yeah.  The endless cycle repeats itself. 		People smarter than I will have to solve these issues, but I think faith inhibits many people from more forward thinking solutions, and instead they accept the comforts of God as all they need
@Cernovich The largest contributer to greenhouse gas emmisions annually comes from the agriculture  industry, livestock. 100 billion cattle a year.  And we can't even access these places and report on these issues fully because of ag-gag laws protecting these offenders. #peta #vegan
@Cernovich It's far more effective to change someone's mind when you can show the financial/environmental benefits of the world consuming less animal products, than by shaming them with slaughter house videos.
@Cernovich If vegan groups like Peta would change their messaging From ethical treatment of animals, to an economic message, they could change everyone's minds. You then Segway into health and the climate change points. People don't want to hear that theyre monsters killing animals
@Roar__Bang @KyleKulinski Solving the root cause of things like mass shootings would probably be a more effective use of time and energy than thoughts and prayers, and feeling better. Why coddle someone's persona belief's instead of trying to problem solve.

@teapot_russells @LiberalismRules @PrisonPlanet Unrelated, but your country is also full of pussies that can't even defend themselves from outside powers who would take their rights away.  History is a funny thing.
@teapot_russells @LiberalismRules @PrisonPlanet What then gives you your right to free speech? A different piece of paper? The point is it's not a fundamental right of anyone, without something, like my Constitution, to back it up. Your ideals and values of enlightenment mean nothing in the face of tyrants.
@teapot_russells @LiberalismRules @PrisonPlanet Woah, woke bae over here, my bad.  But freedom of speech is a right to all of us, that we only have because of the Constitution.

@PatrickSvitek @JohnCornyn I wouldnt be so sure about that, the dems had their best showing in a pres. election in Texas in 20 years in 2016. The state was as close as Ohio. the demographics are changing. were seeing a younger, more racially diverse population, of whom the GOP doesnt recognize their needs.

Here comes the flip tomorrow, Trump no longer supports changes to any gun legislation already on the books, perhaps comes out with some NRA approved half measure, or backtrack entirely on NRA talking points. https://t.co/ARhkZm8yY3

@The_JKM @thehill Just clarifying the difference between that and an armed guard.
@The_JKM @thehill He was sheriffs deputy you ignorant fool.
@The_JKM @thehill Protect and serve. The sheriff made a statement about how the officer should have responded. Youre defending a coward who could have potentially saved some lives. I dont care about the risks to his personal safety, that's part of the job he signed up for.
@christorrice @The_JKM @thehill Even better, the officer was afraid of the unknown. Still not acceptable. Do your fucking job and protect those kids.
@The_JKM @thehill The point Im addressing is that the kid has no business being called in for an interview to be asked about his opinion about the officer. 		 But yeah fuck those kids being shot, amirite? That AR is way too scary for me, a trained police officer to confront.
@The_JKM @thehill ngs objectively, and criticize your own side when they're being this stupid. This is why the Dems are really fucking good at losing.
