@ChristineDBaker Yes, the first one was racey but the second one about her husband I think was pretty funny.

@ChristineDBaker There isn't anyone left that I can think of who would try to stop him from declaring a state of emergency.
@ChristineDBaker *Pence, obviously.
@ChristineDBaker Pence is a good VP in the sense that he says absolutely nothing.
@ChristineDBaker I don't even think him and Pwnce talk to one another.
@ChristineDBaker I know! Who could have stopped him -- or would have wanted to stop him?
@ChristineDBaker Yeah I see how that might be a 'victory' for him, but I think if he personally thought that would be the best way to go, he would have declared a state of emergency in his address to the nation.
@ChristineDBaker That's is one thing I will draw a line with, we can't make that political anymore. Change has to happen, and it has to happen now.
@ChristineDBaker And Republicans are worried that if they do end the shutdown, the Democrats won't work with them to comprise to fund the wall. No matter what this is a difficult situation.
@ChristineDBaker I don't know either, although I feel like he will be getting desperate soon so deals should be easy to make. He doesn't want to declare a state of emergency.
@ChristineDBaker I would be so irked if I was in the position, and you don't have to get over it. But, in the end, it's better for everyone to leave the last behind and work together for a better future. (Which makes me worry about climate change -- which I am no longer a skeptic about.)
@ChristineDBaker insated of as a win for everyone. That, of course, doesn't mean every compromise is going to feel immediately gratifying, but in the long run it helps sustain the stability of our government.
@ChristineDBaker One thing I've noticed is that our biases affect our view of who is winning in politics. Like, at least when I discuss these things with my dad, he always says the Republicans give in and give in. And honestly I think people tend to always see compromise as a loss...
@ChristineDBaker I just think through compromise, our country can somewhat heal.
@ChristineDBaker No, it really is disheartening. The current state of things is beyond jokingly bad.
@ChristineDBaker That's all certainly true.
@ChristineDBaker In American politics there certainly isn't much trust.
@ChristineDBaker After Nancy Pelosi said they wouldn't fund the wall. The government shutdown needs to end, and a compromise would be beneficial to both sides. I can't see an argument against compromising.
@ChristineDBaker I'm not sure about the timeline on that, but it had to have been before the Obergefell ruling.
@ChristineDBaker There haven't been any negotiations. And to be honest Trump has been waiting for the Democrats to come back to the table. I think in the end, the wall is non-negotiable -- but that doesn't mean Democrats can't also win from a compromise.
@ChristineDBaker That's his own personal beliefs. I don't know if he would implement an anti-gay agenda.
@ChristineDBaker Trump doesn't have to offer anything. Our politicians, in both parties, need to be more creative. The Democrats could very well bring anything they want to the table.
@ChristineDBaker I like the sound of President Pence haha
@ChristineDBaker That's the thing, I don't want to punish Trump at the cost of throwing our government into a state of chaos -- his supporters I think would turn violent.
@ChristineDBaker They could use the wall to push forward their own agenda.
@ChristineDBaker Yeah but that's petty and gets the Democrats no where. If they want to achieve something, a compromise is the best possible scenario. I mean thy could ask for anything.
@ChristineDBaker Now that you have me thinking about it, maybe I am a little worried.
@ChristineDBaker Although, I guess, no matter the situation an impeachment and removal would be detrimental for this country. I can't even imagine all the consequences.
@ChristineDBaker That's a shame, Trump should've accepted that deal. At this point the dreamers are Americans, not foreigners -- many don't even remember living in their home countries.
@ChristineDBaker The fact that he is coming apart at the seems is what has made me less worried. I know it sounds strange but there is a method to my madness.
@ChristineDBaker It is a shame what's going on, but they will be payed for the time they didn't work. (And that doesn't mean I think that it's easy sailing for government workers right now.)
@ChristineDBaker Yeah, but I thought it was the other way around. Like I thought the Democrats said no to that deal. But if they what Citizenship for DACA kids, now is the time to compromise.
@ChristineDBaker https://t.co/X0He0X5TJi
@ChristineDBaker Now, if I was president I wouldn't push for a wall, but $5 billion is a pittance and the Democrats could get something out of this by making a deal with Trump.
@ChristineDBaker I can't fault him for taking a stand, because that was a huge campaign promise. I do think that it wouldn't be a problem to allocate $5 billion for it. I was recently looking at H.R. 264, at least I think that was the bill, and I was so shocked by the amount of money to be spent.
@ChristineDBaker I know...
@ChristineDBaker I'm not as worried about Trump as I was before. I am shocked that the FBI has been investigating to see if he is helping out Russia, and I think they are starting to overstep their authority. But I don't know, I don't have a definite position on it.
@ChristineDBaker That is all true. I don't think it should go up to 70%, but the harsh reality is that the U.S. is in major debt. We do need to cut spending and raise taxes for a time.
@ChristineDBaker and Republicans will have to give soemthing in return (I don't know what that is).
@ChristineDBaker No, I wouldn't like it if he declared a state of emergency at the southern border. I'm frustrated with the political game being played, and I think there is a definite compromise to be found, but that means that the Democrats would have to give something for the wall...
@ChristineDBaker And I do agree, there have to be protections in place to protect the people. But I am against any redistribution of wealth, an economy greatly controlled by the government, or anything really that goes beyond the social programs we currently have in place.
@ChristineDBaker I mean it doesn't matter what I think, you can be a socialist if you want to be, but I'm glad you haven't gone all the way haha
@ChristineDBaker I don't think Booker is too viable as a candidate. There definitely needs to be a younger candidate selected. The world is changing and our leaders should reflect that.
@ChristineDBaker Yeah, baby boomers shouldn't be running for president. Did something special or significant happen during her time as AG?
@ChristineDBaker This is kind of off topic, but would you support socialism over capitalism? I asked because I am shocked by how many people I've seen promoting socialism in the United States. (These aren't politicians per se but just your average Facebook user.)
@ChristineDBaker I don't like Warren. I don't really like any of the candidates so far and I don't think any of them will be the Democratic candidate.
@ChristineDBaker I don't want to sound like a sexist though, because if she were a guy, I would still find 'him' to be aggressive.
@ChristineDBaker Maybe not as much haha
@ChristineDBaker Despite being super old, of Joe Biden announced he was running, he would be my favorite. (That doesn't mean I want him to run.)
@ChristineDBaker Harris is just too aggressive. I don't know how to put it any other way.
@ChristineDBaker Who all have so far announced they are running?
@ChristineDBaker I haven't liked any of them, so far. Although she hasn't announced if she is running, but I do like Amy Klobuchar, she seems to be pretty sensible.
@ChristineDBaker I have to wonder how she even is a democrat?
@ChristineDBaker Haha yeah she really is a joke. Her campaign won't go far.
@ChristineDBaker I can't stand Harris.

@ChristineDBaker So many people have spoken against Dr. Ford's claims. The four people who she claimed were at the party can't even recall the party. So many people have come out to support Kavanaugh. Ford's friend said she never met Kavanaugh or Ford.
@ChristineDBaker Has he lied about his drinking? And I haven't heard anything about his time in the Bush White House.
@ChristineDBaker There isn't enough time to push through another candidate before a new congress is sworn in. There is a good chance that Democrats, if they get a hold of the Senate, will block any hearing for a Trump nominee.
@ChristineDBaker I can completely see why the Democrats are doing what they are doing. I think, from what we have heard today, that Kavanaugh is innocent and the majority of the evidence suggest so.
@ChristineDBaker I don't think I can buy that argument though. She knew about it for too long. The timing was too perfect.
@ChristineDBaker I am still pretty reasonable haha
@ChristineDBaker What I am getting at is if Feinstein never let anyone know about this allegation, there would have been no chance for any investigation. What was her plan? To just ignore Dr. Ford? It just doesn't make sense to hold onto that allegation for so long.
@ChristineDBaker I don't disagree. I think there is no reason to not have an FBI investigation.
@ChristineDBaker I agree there isn't a perfect way. But did she plan on ever telling anyone about it? If it wasn't leaked, would Feinstein have told anyone abou it?
@ChristineDBaker She could have, at the very least, informed the Democratic members of the committee of an anonymous allegation of sexual assault.  Also, I wonder how it got leaked to the press.

@ChristineDBaker I don't think I can keep looking at more cases haha but I do believe the Roberts Court hasn't overturned any major precedents.
@ChristineDBaker The second case -- Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc., (2007) -- is an example of the court overturning precedent. But, I think, they were right to overturn precedent to expand our right to freedom of speech, especially political speech.
@ChristineDBaker By accepting a more specific ban on partial-birth abortions, they didn't break precedent; although, they might have bent it. (2/2)
@ChristineDBaker In the case dealing with partial-birth abortions -- Gonzales v. Carhart, (2007) -- the court upheld the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 because it was "more specific concerning the instances to which it applies." 550 U.S. 124, 133 (2007). (1/2)
