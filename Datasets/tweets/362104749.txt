@FrankJAvery no.
today i pooped twice and intimidated some ducks.
@mmmmelissa I can just toss the couch out of the way. My smaller stature gives me extraordinary strength. Like an ant.
@mmmmelissa I'm here waiting for you... @FrankJAvery http://t.co/Mz4T1cdb
@mmmmelissa, you pee more often than I do. Then again, At least it isn't on @FrankJAvery's wall. @Bilko1024

Wish I had thumbs so I could turn off the lights and go to sleep on my plush bed... #whitedogproblems
FOOD! FOOD! FOOD! POOP! FOOD!
@mikemacroomie @christinawhaat I will. #livinglifeontheedge #deathbychocolate
@mikemacroomie This tweet was funny until you tried to poison me last night. #evil #nevertrustmichaela
@twirlywhirly more like vom everywhere. As in, I vomited everywhere.
Went to ER last night. OD'ed on chocolate. Injected w fluids for rehab. Let the fluids flow on @frankjavery's wall this morning. #fratlife
@mikemacroomie @mmmmelissa Table scraps don't count. Seriously, I've been chewing on my leg all day. We going to do something about this?
@mikemacroomie @mmmmelissa Quit tweeting. Just feed me, dammit.
some days all i'm interested in doing is eating my own earwax.
got a haircut today. everyone thinks i look like a dalmatian now. is this a step up or no?
i'll eat my own poop and the vomit of strangers, but i certainly will not touch bugs of any sort.  IT'S CALLED STANDARDS Y'ALL
eating last night's crumbs off the floor again. yum
#thingsifear air conditioning vents on the floor. thunderstorms. @mmmmelissa forgetting to give me her dinner leftovers. #eatyourgreens
think i'll ptfo under @mmmmelissa's blanket because of the rain. not that i don't do this every day. #hardknocklife http://t.co/Bgm5SDwS
Garcia drops more balls than my vet did when I got neutered. #traumitexperiences #CarolinaFootball
TRU FAX RT @christinawhaat being productive and knocking out some homework. @dogdogdognorman is helping. he's so studious.
took a bath today.  wonder if @mmmmelissa realizes her singing is not as soothing as she had hoped it would be in this stressful situation?
@DogBountyHunter gives me hope my search and recovery skills will earn me employment one day.
If Carolina #Gamecocks  fumble one more time, I'm going to chew my foot off.  #NervousHabits #StrayDogProblems
Why's everyone catching the ball with their hands? You catch stuff with your mouth. Why else would you have teeth? #collegefootball
Finally have the apartment to myself. Now I just need some thumbs so I can use the remote and watch some tv. #imadog
stayed in the hotel room alone watching espn high school football for eight hours.  i am severely disappointed. where is the seafood!?
made it to georgia! spent forty-five minutes trying to peel apart sandwich wrapper from trash to reach the leftover crumblies.  WHAT A DAY.
off on a road trip!  here's hoping i get the chance to vomit in @FrankJAvery's BMW.
sometimes i just like to chew on my toenails for a few hours
RT @christinawhaat my new favorite addition to the twitterverse is @dogdogdognorman yay Norman!! :)
