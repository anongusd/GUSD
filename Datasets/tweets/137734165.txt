A member of my family heard the gunshots while out walking his dog. My sister was blocks away and drove home fearing an active shooter was on the loose. A woman we know lost her 97-year-old mother for simply going to synagogue with her like she does every Saturday.
the saddest is I knew it'd hit my hometown eventually. And that sense of inevitability is the worst thing of all, and I don't want to feel that way. I don't have much else to say for now, but here are helpful links for donations: https://t.co/gTPD4cPEVE + https://t.co/HDnma79YjA
I landed from a 10-hour flight from Tokyo to the news alerts and a million texts, not knowing what was going on. The victims are members of small, close Jewish community, some of which my family knows. Gun violence always makes me unspeakably sad and hopeless, but what makes me
I am struggling to find the words to describe the sadness and horror I feel over what happened at Tree of Life. I grew up going to bar/bat mitzvahs there, my brother-in-law's family belongs there and my sister lives right down the street.

He added: "Facebook Is not a company, it’s a country. It’s big and its powerful and we need to learn more about the extent of its power, the extent of its data, who it shares its data with, what protections there are for the American people and the people of other countries."

Wyden, a tech ally and co-author of the law the bill would amend, is proposing language that would provide $$ to "prosecute actual sex traffickers" and "encourage websites to go after bad actors...without being targets for litigation." He previously had a hold on the Senate bill.
