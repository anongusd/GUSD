"Developing chemistry and combo play in the final third is a work in progress. PAR is tough in the final third. They traditionally don’t allow a lot of chances, I didn’t expect a lot of chances. We knew we’d limit them and not get that many opportunities."
"It was a great environment for our players. You play really hard when there’s people behind you and that’s a credit to the local community. The atmosphere was great. It felt like a real home game and that’s a big part of succeeding."
"These games are valuable in the players’ development. When we start getting into qualifying, games will look like this. There's a lot of physicality."
"The center backs were outstanding. Carter-Vickers and Miazga didn’t put a foot wrong. They played with confidence and physicality. They were a pair that looked like they had been there before."
"Darlington Nagbe is a really good player. He’s one of a few guys that can break down a team on the dribble. He’s a great leader, he’s still got more soccer in him and better soccer ahead I think. He provided a lot of possession for us tonight."
"Marky Delgado's a good passer. He’s a connector, he’s got good feet. Tyler Adams has an incredible engine. The combination of a good passer and a guy that can run can be deadly. We talked about breaking PAR’s line and Tyler’s timing on the run to draw the penalty was excellent."
"When you bring a group together with the National Team, you focus on cohesiveness and bringing the group together. It’s like a crash course in communicating, and I think the guys did an excellent job."
"The kids have got to start somewhere and this was a good game to get their feet wet."
Head coach Dave Sarachan on the 🎙️ after the W:	"This game became a real big boy game and these guys kept their composure when things started to fly. Winning is good and it's another step forward for this group."

"We're in a transition phase. You’ll see a lot of new players as a part of this roster and in rosters moving forward. It’s a time when we’re giving opportunity to new players, young players, who we think will be important for our players moving forward."
"I have great respect for South American teams in general. I’ve watched a lot of Paraguay in prep for this match and I’m very impressed with their group. They're very physical and bring good speed."
"We have six reserves we’re able to use and we hope to use all six. We’ll look positionally and where guys are fitness-wise. I’d like to see them all but that's not possible."
"If you look at the rosters we’ve put together, we've been giving players opportunity that we feel are going to be part of the bigger picture. You can’t predict a year from now, but we hope that these matches will pay dividends in the next WCQ cycle and future competition."
"The natural progression is that guys get older and young guys come through. if the balance is right, you can have a pretty successful group. Having veteran guys and voices is important. But you also need the young guns to get their feet wet and start to take the mantle."
"With youth comes enthusiasm and energy, but the soccer has impressed me so far in training. When the curtain goes up tomorrow night, we’ll see how it looks when it really counts. They’ve been playing without fear."
"The group has a youthful confidence. They come in from their club environments, and they're drawing from experience vs. POR and BIH. They're looking to impress, pushing each day in training. The technical level of these guys has shown to be very good."
"It's a very experienced group for Paraguay, we're going against seasoned players to an extent. The speed of play will be ratcheted up quite a bit."
"It's always nice to build towards something, and that something is tomorrow night vs. Paraguay. We’ll get to give guys a real look against a quality opponent. When you face the best teams you can, it gives our guys a great chance to measure themselves."
Head Coach Dave Sarachan on 🎙️ for his MD-1 press conference:	"It's been a really good week in Carolina. Good effort all week and the guys have gotten to know each other on and off-the-field."

"Apparently there was a game in the US where it snowed...hopefully it doesn't snow here tomorrow."
"The field conditions definitely change the way the game is going to look...it'll be slower, a little bit sloppy, but we have to adapt."

On Nagbe: "When he started playing with us, I was impressed. Anything he does, doesn't surprise me. I think he has a higher ceiling."
"I saw Michael Bradley around the game a lot as a kid. There was a focus, he's inherited a lot of his father's qualities."
"I think this has been a good competition and the level of play has been pretty strong."
"I think it's very interesting to see how some of the lesser known countries have played @GoldCup...they've vastly improved."
"It's been fun to put these pieces together with the #USMNT. At this point of my career, this is the best challenge I could hope for."
"Jamaica has been able to defend well, been opportunistic with goals and worked real hard to get to the Final."
On Jamaica: "My guess is they have the best defensive record in the tournament. They've been dependent on their defending, have a great GK."
On Dempsey: "He's always been a reserved guy, but he has a new excitement of playing from a year ago when he almost lost the game."
"Bradley makes my life easier. Since I've had Michael from January on he's been a great leader...fantastic to work with."
"My observations of Jozy &amp; Michael is that this is very important...Michael is a serious professional. Jozy's excited about the Final."

On #CRC: "All things indicate it will be a low scoring game. The #USA would do well to get an early goal...the first goal in the game."
On Acosta: "He's going to have ups &amp; downs. He's a player that's going to have a good future but we understand its not all going to be easy"
"At the most there are only two games remaining. I do think we have an advantage -- we should be fresher than a lot of the remaining teams."
"...At this stage of the tournament, we can put a team on the field that has more familiarity."
"If there's an issue in our team, it's that we haven't played together... that's kind of by design..."
"We've scored the most goals in this tournament, so we're not that bad in attack..."
On #CRC: "They have a set way that they play... Ruiz is their leader in attack, their back line is strong... overall, a real good team."
"...I imagine the teams we see tomorrow will be somewhat different that the teams we see in September."
On playing #CRC again soon in WCQ: "I guess we'll go one game at a time and see what tomorrow's game looks like..." https://t.co/H7di7RH957

On Costa Rica: "Every game is different...They look to have pretty close to their first team, though I've seen they've had some injuries."
Asked about Altidore/Romero incident: "There should have been a player sent off tonight. I didn't see the play live, I can't fault referee."
"Lichaj is an experienced player. We've been able to look at big picture in the Gold Cup, if there's one thing I get out of it it's that."
"I thought Bradley and Nagbe played well. Good goals from Omar and Lichaj and I haven't seen the replay, but I thought Zardes was inside."
ARENA: "I don't think games should look like that. Too many fouls, time wasting, players falling on the ground."

"We took penalties today. If it comes to that in these games, we're going to put our best players up there and see how they do."
"When Dempsey has his opportunities, he'll demonstrate whether he's still a 90-minute player or if there's a different role for him."
"I think Omar Gonzalez moving to Pachuca has allowed him to focus a little more on his craft...he continues to grow with experience."
"In observing all the group games, the smaller countries in CONCACAF have improved considerably... I think the gap has closed a little bit."
"🇸🇻 has a good group of attacking players... Zelaya up top with Bonilla and in midfield Pineda and Mayen. They're all good players."
On roster additions: "I was just following the rules of the tournament. I thought it would be good to test some players during the group."
ARENA: "It's great to be here in Philadelphia. We look forward to the match against El Salvador, a team that has performed well thus far."
