@politicsluo A challenger polling at 39% is also pretty terrible.

@devilmke @DanielBynum15 @sadtransqueer @Donnough1 @kevin_kubi @Prescribed_Naps @FakeOliviaPope @martsendo You are all wrong. Centrism is good policy. Compromise is good. Realism and pragmatism are good.
@politicsluo I think she wins by about as much as expected I think Gillum does a little bit better than people think. Greene is fading. Levine was always a bad candidate. King could hit 5-7%. King should be the nominee though and it sucks that he‚Äôs gonna get trounced. Murphy probs would win.

I‚Äôm holding WI-Sen at likely D but one more tight poll and it will go to lean.
@karandikara18 @ChazNuttycombe It‚Äôs a swing state. Lean D at best.
I support @ChrisKingFL for Governor because pragmatism and populism are two of the most important traits for the next Governor to have. Rick Scott sold Florida to the highest bidder and we need an outsider with a strong message of appealing to working Floridians.
@karandikara18 @ChazNuttycombe Colorado is a swing state. You can compromise with Republicans. Republicans are good people sometimes.

@joncprevo I would help write a concurring opinion on that

@SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @JMilesColeman What a blue dog. #demexit
@politicsluo @wp4637 Ideally Hillary Clinton would be president.
@haydenrobinsonn @galizerigfanda @davante_h @InsideElections Also, she‚Äôs a U.S. senator with a strong personal brand. Learn about objectivity.
@Whodat1001 @Redistrict That is false
@StuknDaMiddle17 @Ms_Liz2 @senatormcdaniel Charming you dick
@SenhorRaposa Was SD-01 a blue district?
RT @jacobfhsmith: Justice Kennedy's son convinced LeBron to go to LA.
@wp4637 Hey @Ojeda4congress I have twitter too.
@politicsluo Anthony Brown is pretty cool.
@SenhorRaposa Oof I didn‚Äôt even know Serrano was an incumbent. I forgot NY-25 is only like high single digits in the Cook PVI.
@SenhorRaposa Slaughters district?
@SenhorRaposa Eh we need a populist and I hate to say it because it‚Äôs gross messaging but a coastal dem is too easy to paint imho
@ForecasterEnten I don‚Äôt even know what I feel right now
@joncprevo Hey I‚Äôm a former Bernie person
RT @jacobfhsmith: Six decades from now, could become the longest serving House member in history. https://t.co/MUwH3vN6cX
This is incredible
Fuck
@ForecasterEnten What‚Äôs your dads voting history like otherwise? Typically dem in general elections? I know NY has closed primaries but still a question I had.
This is how I would roughly estimate the margin. I think the race will be within 4 points, I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôll win but Cordray should keep hammering the populist message. https://t.co/LWzPZPDUOY
Very intelligent! https://t.co/W6YnNL8hi9
@joncprevo This is false, pork is supreme
@ForecasterEnten Idek tbh
@SenhorRaposa It‚Äôs really that small? Wow. It didn‚Äôt feel like it when I visited him a couple years ago. It felt small but like a couple thousand people small. Weird.
@SenhorRaposa My uncle lives there
@LikeIGive_Adam @JMilesColeman When I read a pun its sMiles all around.
@politicsluo @jacobfhsmith He‚Äôs just joshing around, let‚Äôs not condenham  him.
@politicsluo @mcimaps ^
@SenhorRaposa Yeah probably, I do like @Scholten4Iowa though, I hope he keeps it close ish.
@SenhorRaposa @KielTWilliams Do CA POTUS 1876
@mcimaps @IAmKrishanPatel Do it
Wow that‚Äôs so creepy. https://t.co/QFbAqJSEGN
@giuliopolitics Is there a way to fill them all in perfectly or do you just have to be really precise?

@ActorAaronBooth Do pawlentys narrow win in 2006
@LikeIGive_Adam Presumably.
@LikeIGive_Adam They‚Äôre called shadow reps and senators in DC. It‚Äôs colloquial.
@wp4637 He was actually a great campaigner,I was visiting Philadelphia at the start of his campaign and I saw on his twitter that he had an event near where I was staying so I checked it out. He was very honest and came across as having a very populist message. I think he would have won.
@wp4637 Sestak would‚Äôve won
@RalstonReports  https://t.co/XtPvYCiYd7
@LikeIGive_Adam Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky?
@politicsluo Based on his feed it seems like he is
@summer87583383 @daveweigel @DavidMDrucker @MimiWaltersCA I mean, obviously not. She was the top finisher. She sucks but I still give her a teensy weensy edge if I were doing a no tossup map.
@SenhorRaposa Does she ever?

@politicsluo @heatherjtaylor Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee that seems like a risky bet. Scott Walker is actually a very good politician despite how much I hate him. The narrative is about how many elections he‚Äôs won in a set number of years but the reality is that he is just really folksy on the campaign trail.
@politicsluo Hmm
@politicsluo Seems cool, it says on wiki he‚Äôs unopposed? Is that true in such a deep red district?
@politicsluo How so?
@IAmKrishanPatel Wow it worked!
@politicsluo @SenSchachtner @SenFrostman Oh yeah for sure it‚Äôs swung towards Dems from 2016, my point was 2016 might have been an outlier.
@RalstonReports Nah, Laxalt has a famous name, was endorsed by Trump, gained national attention for his upset of Ross Miller, and has served statewide for 4 years and, according to your own paper, has the best name recog if anyone in the field.
@politicsluo @SenSchachtner @SenFrostman They weren‚Äôt bad, they also weren‚Äôt Conor Lamb though. I mean, WI doesn‚Äôt collect party registration so it‚Äôs hard to collect data on what seems to be the reality, but wisconsin was reliable twice for Obama so I wouldn‚Äôt call it a revival. I would attribute it to the environment.
@RalstonReports I disagree, Laxalt is well known, he‚Äôs the AG
@politicsluo True @SenSchachtner and @SenFrostman we‚Äôre both 6/10 candidates who had major swings. It was the environment, not the candidates that flipped those seats.
This could shift the narrative leftward. It might have been strategic or it might have been KH being a good senator. https://t.co/TNNZjaalbG
@BruneElections Comstock loses by 6 ish I‚Äôd say
Does anyone have a senate whip count on ending family separation. I imagine most,  if not all Dems and a good chunk of Republicans are in favor of ending family separation, even if not through the Feinstein bill.

Interesting question about 2020 election: does @realDonaldTrump break 60% with white voters? He had 58% in 2016.
