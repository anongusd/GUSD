We have some extremely GOOD news for the world about Jesus. And this good news is medicine to the sick and healing to the broken and hope to the lost. Don't make it look like a scolding, scowling, self-aggrandizing platform. Just make it look like Jesus.
I get that we must protect against false and unbiblical theology, but the fruit of spending all of our time pointing people to what they ought to be against is a church that is all about being against things.
It's like, if you can't say something nice about someone, you should start a "ministry of discernment" and masquerade your critical spirit as a "proper biblical worldview."
It's sad when entire ministries are built on criticizing other Christian leaders. Can't influence people in positive ways? Just do repeated hit pieces on your least favorite televangelists and you'll have a following of fellow unhappy cynics. We should be better than this.
