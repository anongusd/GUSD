@MarlaMHughes I meant no offense. Certainly Floridians use their pickups for their intended purposes. But on the I-4 corridor, I’ve only seen shiny pickups (excluding those owned by businesses) that people seem to drive as a lifestyle statement rather than for any practical reason.
Finally! A #pickup truck that’s ACTUALLY BEING PUT TO PRACTICAL USE. I have never seen this in #Florida before. #PickupTruck #BaleOfHay #Fox35 https://t.co/yO3HN2Bsvh
