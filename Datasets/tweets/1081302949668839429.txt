@atiku @iamhistory_ @FranceAbuja @EUinNigeria This re tools and weapons that jaganba is using . They are local media both prints,onlines , digital s ,TV in all Lagos and Ogun communities. The are for season and time like this.
@atiku @iamhistory_ @FranceAbuja @EUinNigeria Sai Atiku , structure s to win Lagos for pdp is not on ground. People want to change and vote you inn but the structure is not there. Dir can we arrange a meeting with Associations of community media, Lagos has about 160 members to do positive story
@renoomokri @DanielOmonze Great one. This govt never taught of promoting our language but how to move nothing to nothing is the language they know
@elrufai You re parts and parcel of the 16th years. Chairman BPE later Minister of FCT where you stole money to built you Estate and mall. So your memories are so short circuit.who re you before Atiku brought you to Govt.?
@Daystar The God of new beginnings is my God. The former rains and latter rain is falling 	 I can see it. The sound of abundance rains
@aminugamawa Thanks for this but APC continue to accept them to me is morally burden. How can you accused some one as thief yet you welcome him to your master bed room. You just be a thief yourself

@fabulouski143 can't read Your story.
@fkeyamo We remember there actions to there junior brother but the truth is she is a Nigerian. Qualified to hold what ever the best government choose to give. Constitution is final has the final say
@fkeyamo My take is that we are not be sincere to our selves. Some put needs to be popular and cut there shares of national cake  , don't care what dignity is all about. There characters and antecedents show they are ready to dine with the devil while others are pretentious about
@ShehuSani Women can be funny, she may have desired that for her husband
