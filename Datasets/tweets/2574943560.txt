@janearraf @BarhamSalih @realDonaldTrump The reason that Iran is so strong in Iraq and the rest of Middle East is because of US withdrawal in 2011. Don't repeat Malliki's mistakes. But, anyway without Iran's and US consent, Barham would not be the president of Iraq!

@KamalChomani @Matthew__Barber Believe me, Yezidis don't know what they want!
@KamalChomani @Matthew__Barber KDP has reached to an agreement with Baghdad, as they have done many times for the last 15 years. KDP is going back to Sinjar no matter what because for the last 4 years, all these Yezidi "sympathizers" have not done anything for Sinjar.
Yezidi people who were mass graved in Sinjar Mount for the last 4 years were also victims of political disagreements in Erbil, Baghdad and Washington DC.
@vandentoorn Since everyone else has failed to do anything for Sinjar since 2014 and since %80 of Yezidi people are still with KDP, it makes some sense for them to go back to Sinjar!
@AL_Khatteeb You know Sinjar can produce electricity for the whole Ninewa if the wind power would have been invested in!
@AL_Khatteeb Great luck, you deserve it.
@BilalWahab You think this time is not a Hana-Mana trap!

In Kirkuk, same people who danced for Referendum are dancing for the entrance of PMU. It's about building citizens not building countries.
I wonder if @Bernard-Henri Lévy is busy writing a script for his next movie about #Kerkuk
@BilalWahab @SarkawtShams It is the same accountability of handling Sinjar...
@ianbremmer US has been paying Peshmerga $ 4 m per month and told them it's not the right time for a referendum. Kurds should have been smarter.
It would be a huge shift in Iraqi politics if this Coalition succeeds without having its own militias and ties to neighboring countries. https://t.co/jvuJmZhquV
I wonder what Turkey makes out of this? PKK to fight in Kirkuk while Peshmerga are fleeing. https://t.co/gh3RPV4wNK
@USEmbBaghdad Maybe you should move the embassy to Kirkuk so no one of the sides would try to mess up the city.
I am sure if Soleimani intervenes, things would either come down or turn to hell in Kirkuk. #KirkukBreaking https://t.co/6VMWsuyrf4
As I said, they did it in Halbja, they did it in Sinjar and they will do in it Kirkuk.. don't be fooled by Media propaganda. https://t.co/qM2bt8yoLd
@BilalWahab It's a shame that a country of 30 million has no one to negotiate..
Kurdish people aren't the same in 1900s to sacrifice for some corrupted politicians. What have families of all Peshmerga martyrs got so far?
