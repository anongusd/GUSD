We are lucky to have this planet Earth, but don't be alarmed by the 0.05% CO2 in our atmosphere because photosynthesis works!
Then you may all come to the understanding that the Earth is a living breathing colony of organisms (of which humans are in insignificant numbers compared to viruses, bacteria, fungi, monokaryotic and eukaryotic plants).
It became a densely forested planet. With an abundance of life.  	For those of you reading this and saying that the Earth is getting hotter than ever.  	Please look up the Earth's climate during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods.
But even orbital flux and Sun spots have a minimal effect on average planetary temperatures.  	Unless the Earth literally gets too close to the sun. As is what happened millions of years ago.  	Even with this, the Earth did not become a barren wasteland.
For 40 years!  	The Sun is the source of our light and heat.  	Orbital flux and sunspots have a great effect on our planet. Not to mention Carrington events (where a solar flare blasts its energy directly at earth).
I'm a scientist and I can't believe how stupid some so-called smart people are.		How does 0.05% of our atmosphere cause global warming when ocean/sea temperature lags in the range of hundreds of thousands of years.  	CO2 levels rose after WW2 but the Earth went into a mini iceage
@realDonaldTrump i have the answer if you would contact me
@realDonaldTrump Hello Mr Trump. 	I thought I would share this little pearl of wisdom with you.	I know you're a smart guy so you will understand.		I'm a scientist and I can't believe how stupid some so-called smart people are. How does 0.05% of our atmosphere cause global warming
@realDonaldTrump Close all USA borders. 	No-one in &amp; No-one out!		The world is at WAR!
@realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina Mr Trump, please make Australia the 51st State of America. 	This is gaining momentum here in Australia.

@realDonaldTrump Hello Mr Trump, I would like to personally invite you to become the leader of Australia. Making Australia the 51st State of America. 	What are your thoughts on this?
@usafortrumpp Mr Trump, I for one believe that at this current point in history WE NEED YOU! Australia is an American ALLY, as susc we should support you!	If I was an American, I would vote for you! https://t.co/c4Az5IJ3qX

@Deborra_lee Hello how are you?
@TheEllenShow Ok is decaf really coffee? Why do we drink coffee? For the taste? Really? It is for the caffeine! Who doesn't need a fix a day? Well I haven't drank coffee, tea or any caffeinated drinks for years and I don't think that they are necessary same with alcohol.
@TheEllenShow Believe me when I say, that coffee without water, milk (or cream if that is your preference) or sugar quickly turns into cougheeeeee!!!
@TheEllenShow Coffee: one grain becomes a bean becomes 43 beans in a cup. Do you see how it takes a hold on you? Befpre you know it you can't get by without a shot, or will that be a double shot? It only gets worse you know! But that's how it has always bean (yes I know it's spelt wrong)!

@RealHughJackman @JulieRogan @Deborra_lee Hello Hugh, I do not condone the artificial homosexual procreation techniques. And that includes adoption.
@JulieRogan homosexuality is abhorrent to most heterosexuals. It is wrong in the eyes of the natural scheme of things.

@omeagoz @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee Yes I do object, emphatically to the artificial nature of same sex marriage.
@shade_for_days @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee Yes, I am, they are artificial techniques, laboratory based! There is a reason they don't occur naturally!
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee Why should society allow another negative effector (same-sex marriage) to destroy the very fabric of our society.
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee In this era, where children seem to be the "deserving generation", many new effectors do shape the modern individual.
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee Is it by first name basis, which shows an inherent lack of respect.
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee Who do they call "Daddy" and who do they call "Mummy"?
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee The "children" associated with this sort of relationship are brought up as very confused individuals.
@AniMotek @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee In reply to your comment Ani Motek; you say same sex marriage doesn't harm the participants...
@LewdHD @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee In marriage, the dominant partner will bully the weaker partner. This can result in the weaker partner dying or leaving (divorce).
@LewdHD @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee The causes of death in each case are inherently different. In slavery, the master/owner may punish his slave as he deems appropriate.
@LewdHD @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee In answer to your saying about slavery: people died because of slavery and people die whilst being married.
You can't compare slavery to marriage, although some married men may argue the point.

@laxmi407 @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee However, just because things have always been done a certain way, it doesn't mean that they should always be done that way.

@omeagoz @sarahanneoz @PangurGaming @RealHughJackman @Deborra_lee If it means anything, I do not agree with the sanctity of, and moral correctness being tarnished in this way.

@PrimaBaci Not dancing,
Spinal surgery will change my life and my family's financial position. Without this I will end up on a disability pension.
Since then, I have lost my job (through no fault of my own) and my health has deteriorated significantly.
I injured my wrists, knees and spine when helping my ex-mother in law when she had a stroke overseas.
They tell me that I must wait for 4 - 6 months to have surgery. I may not be able to walk by then. Please help me. The pain is 7 - 10.
My name is Martin Finn and I have been told that I need spinal surgery. But I do not have the money to pay for it.

@AgendaOfEvil War by any name kills! Why? When there is so much to live for!
@AgendaOfEvil Put others wants and needs before your own nomatter of faith, colour, gender or creed.
@AgendaOfEvil Per ardua ad astra. Just because it is in Latin just means that the dame mistake has been made for far too long.
@AgendaOfEvil Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy Thaad will only prolong life until the ensuing radiation of a nuclear winter covers the earth. Is this our future? You decide!
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy NOBODY WINS A NUCLEAR WAR!
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy That means military on all sides in a war!
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy Military kills in the name of peace! What a couterintuitive oxymoron.
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy Alas, the rhetoric flows freely.
@RodStryker @EverybodyNThDog @FaithGoldy Peace begins with a greeting, War begins with rhetoric.

@MichelZenni Nobody wins a nuclear war!
@MichelZenni Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
@MichelZenni It is when we give all of ourselves that we are truly rich! I'm not affiliated with any faith.
Military kill in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!

@JulianAssange Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
@mikandynothem @FSPat80 @realDonaldTrump The end result of not Playing nicely is demise and death to our planet. Noone wins in nuclear war!
@mikandynothem @FSPat80 @realDonaldTrump The answer is YES to all people no matter creed, colour,gender,faith or not. We are ALL coexisting on this Earth. PLAY NICELY!
@mikandynothem @FSPat80 @realDonaldTrump Why is it necessary to 'crush' anyone or any ideal? The answer is YES to all points of view.
Why kill? When there is so much to live for!
@JohnFromCranber Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
I believe in peace. But not at someone elses expense.
Oh the self serving rhetoric of the common media.
MAGA is self fulfillment. Think globally of all peoples and all faiths when giving of self, not just of wealth.
Self interest is the root of all evil.
Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
Talk genuinely without self interest in your thoughts and hearts of heavy burden. Peace is our only hope!
Why kill, when living can be so rewarding?	War is our enemy and pathway to global destruction.	Please fix this.
Our strength is measured not by what we can take, but by what we can gift with love.
Military kills in the name of peace! What a counterintuitive oxymoron!	Make friends in peace not enemies in war.
Military kills in the name of peace! A counterintuitive oxymoron!	Please make friends in peace not enemies in war.
Military kill in the name of peace. What a counterintuitive oxymoron!	Please fix by making friends with your enemies.	Life is short.
Military kill in the name of peace? What a counterintuitive oxymoron!
@JulianAssange Oh why can military kill for the sake of peace? The ultimate counterintuitive oxymoron, don't you think?
@JulianAssange The art of talking to our neighbours, knowing ourselves; is dying an agonising death. So sad are humans. To the iCloud we go, deleted ....
@JulianAssange With so much technology blinding our ability for rational clear thought. By internet we accelerate our doom.
@JulianAssange Greed, wanton lust for power it overwhelms so many. For so long. Obsession with power,intimacy with greed. Our demise they are!
@JulianAssange Why can't we just "play nicely?"
@JulianAssange SOS to societal norms, terminal velocity into the fog of our future. Why do we blind ourselves to our own demise? Oh foolish mankind!
@JulianAssange So many people trying to steal from their fellow man. For self interests sake. A sed indictment on how society is heading for the abyss!
@JulianAssange Trust, truth and faith in our common man, why can't we just believe? Scrutinisation, disbelief and mistrust is the modern man.
@JulianAssange May we remember the time, long since past, when all we needed was to know!
@JulianAssange This is what happens when you let money speak. The ethical truth dies! RIP truth, honour and peace.

@JulianAssange My heart bleeds for him. I don't know how he will cope on such a pitance? Facecious enough?
@JulianAssange @ciespal Mr Assange, they incarcerate your body, but your mind is free! We need more people like you
@ciespal @JulianAssange Mr Assanges' situation illustrates that you cannot incarcerate an intelligent mind!
@ciespal @JulianAssange Selective intelligence and media utilisation to guide the masses. Dangerous for peace
@JulianAssange Julian, do you agree?
@JulianAssange All the corruption in everyone of these countries is based on the premise that,"I want what they've got or there is trouble".
@JulianAssange Indonesia
@JulianAssange I have spent time in Saudi, Yemen, Pakistan, UAE(when Carlos the Jackal was a problem) and the largest Muslim country outside the MiddleEast
@JulianAssange Even though they each have their own resources, if one gets something for free, they all want it for free. Just like a spoilt child.
@JulianAssange The problem with the Middle East, in general, is that with Muslim countries; to help one you must help all of them.

@jpaulson49 Hello Jules, we are getting support for a gopetition that is asking for signatures to get the governments of the world to act.
@CarolHusband The fact of the matter is, that we are already at world war. The governments of the world just don't want to recognize it.
@CarolHusband If you haven't already done so, could you please read this petition, sign it if you agree with it and send it to everyone.
@CarolHusband Everyone around the world who has the potential to be negatively affected by  Islam should sign the gopetition "Stop Muslim attacks"
@CarolHusband No, my tweets are about forcing the world powers to act globally against the Clear and Present Danger of Islam all the innocent citizens
@CarolHusband ... Are the solution.
@CarolHusband Properly screened and trained professionals who affirm their allegiance to the country (or in Australia’s case; Queen and Country)...
@CarolHusband Things are getting out of hand. We need soldiers on our streets to keep the populus safe.
@CarolHusband I believe that we need Marshall law at this point in time.
@CarolHusband No
@CarolHusband In Australia, I believe that people would be too afraid to use a gun in self defense. The likelihood of being sued is too great.
@CarolHusband No such thing here.
@CarolHusband Register and have to have just cause to own a gun. But I do not believe that gun ownership is the answer.
@RaeleeBee @certoscio2 It's not just Muslims but Muslim sympathizers who don't actually identify as Muslim, but are willing to commit random acts of violence.
@CarolHusband Guns are for those who are properly trained to use them for the protection of our society.
@CarolHusband It is one way of limiting the guns that are owned for malintent. Not 100% effective, but if it saves one life it is worth it.
@CarolHusband @Texasbossbabe2 Our politicians need to be educated and called into action
@SpencerFernando Hello Spencer, I am just letting everyone know that we have actually been at war with Islam since before the crusades.
@MarieN2428 You too. Good night.
@MarieN2428 In some cases it is just Muslim sympathizers who attack in the name of Allah. Which is false.
@MarieN2428 That and protect the rest of us who need protection from the Muslim threat.
@MarieN2428 Yes, and to appreciate what our society can do for them.
In Australia we have somewhat effective gun control laws. And for the most part they are good. We need to have a more effective military.
@MarieN2428 Conscription won't be popular anywhere, but it is necessary to train our youth to fight back.
@MarieN2428 It's not about being popular or politically correct, it's about protecting ourselves and our society. From the malignancy of Islam.
@IlhanMN I don't think any of us want that!
@IlhanMN We must fight back or Muslims will rule every country under sharia law.
@IlhanMN Please read it and sign it if you agree with it. Then send it to everyone.
@IlhanMN The petition on gopetition, "Stop Muslim attacks" is only the beginning.
@IlhanMN Hello, we need to unite and lobby our governments, the UNITED NATIONS, NATO, USA Congress. Everyone
@MarieN2428 I know that sounds extreme, but it is the only answer.
@MarieN2428 We need Marshall law globally and conscription to fight back.
@MarieN2428 It is just that our politicians refuse to act on it!
@MarieN2428 We are at war, and have been since before the crusades.
@MarieN2428 Hello Marie, I am very angry today.
@TerranceCreamer Hello Terry, we as a global community must push our governments to enact Marshall law and conscription.
@JohnKStahlUSA Enough IS enough!

@JohnKStahlUSA Arrest all Imams, charge them with conspiracy if they teach radical Islamic views.
@JohnKStahlUSA This war is a World War! WW3, open your eyes people before it is too late!
@JohnKStahlUSA This war has been ongoing since before the crusades, it is now time to end it!
@JohnKStahlUSA We need Marshall law, conscription, we are at war people!

@peterwhill1 @TurnbullMalcolm WTF? Are they serious?	Please sign my petitions; 1. Stop Muslim Attacks, and 2. Ratify article 14(6) of the ICCPR!
@IlhanMN But it does not bring back the victims or console their grieving families.
@IlhanMN I applaud those Imams who refuse to give funeral rights to these criminals!
@IlhanMN Our politicians have been too politically correct up to now. They need to realise their mistake in this aspect of society.
@IlhanMN Please help with this problem, "if you are not behind us, you are in front of us" (SAS saying)
@IlhanMN We must weed out these extremist radicalised imams and prosecute them as the criminals that they are.
@IlhanMN The problem is; is that they do it in your faiths' name. Islam and the Qur'an does nothing to stop these attacks!
@gold1043 We need to send these Muslim criminals back to their country of faith, not country of birth!
@gold1043 This is not the beginning, or the end. It is however the staw that broke the camel's back. We, as a nation MUST ACT NOW!
