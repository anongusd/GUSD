Why with the high availability of diabetes medications are the costs for these skyrocketing other than pure GREED!
Let's tackle a big one.. 	Someone on an HIV medication or cancer drug might be getting billed upwards of $3500.00 per month or more!  (Certain medications are long term use possibly for years or decades) why such a high price especially when there are so many people on them??
Why does simply registering at the ER cost $200 or more billed to insurance or directly to the patient??
A nasal canula (4ft tubing) cost about $0.79 but bills from hospitals are for over $20.00
#WorthwhileGovernmentProjects	Regulate the prices for medical procedures, materials, and drugs.	Nobody insured or not should be paying $25+ for a .02 Cent band-aid or $25+ for a tylenol.
#WorthwhileGovernmentProjects	Grant full medical coverage to everyone in the country, medical costs will shrink as the population becomes healthier!
