@RowGirlVT This is where we disagree. I think there’s an enormous difference between a non-profit that gets millions in direct tax dollars (hospitals, schools, mental health agencies) and other non-profits that are tax exempt.
@RowGirlVT I am looking to highlight what most Vermonters consider to be a problem, that is tax payers supporting non-profits like UVM MC which pays its CEO $2.2 mil. Out of scale salaries has to be part of the inequality discussion and when it’s tax $$ it ought be a public debate.
@RowGirlVT I don’t agree. I have only ever objected to public funds going to non-profits that pay exorbitant salaries. That’s a pretty specific complaint and totally different from talking about pay at non-profits...something I’ve never commented on.

@kylehauptman You seem to be trying to make some clever point which I don’t understand. Why are you trying to debate the Canadian system? You remember my father lives there, right?
@kylehauptman When we set up democracies around the world we never copy our own EC system.
@kylehauptman It’s ridiculous to argue about a parliamentary system when we are talking about how to elect a chief executive. The current system gives OH and FL too much power, disregards NY, CA, AL, VT and 30+ others. Foolish.
@kylehauptman I applaud parliamentary systems.
@kylehauptman I have none. But we aren’t talking about a parliamentary system. Which is nothing like the electoral college by the way. No country with an elected chief exec uses an EC.
@kylehauptman Take a look: https://t.co/nsEiCbkMpf
@kylehauptman You simply haven’t studied the data. An average recount in a state swings 270 votes. Even the 1960 election (closest pop vote) wasn’t within a recount margin.
@kylehauptman Name a single democracy that mimics the electoral college?
@kylehauptman No, you’re missing the point. There wouldn’t need to be a recount because Gore’s margin was comfortable. A popular vote for president is much less vulnerable to recounts than the current system.
Actually it promotes recounts because it divides us into 51 precincts. Think about 2000, nobody wondered who was ahead in nation, just a question about lead in Florida. https://t.co/qB8eFozT73
