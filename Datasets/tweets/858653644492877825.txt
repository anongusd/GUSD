Lawmakers passed a bill March 1 that seeks to increase investigative resources dedicated to the state‚Äôs Native American community. #NELeg	https://t.co/7t3m6xR8pc
Additional details https://t.co/4mubafb8M1
Hearing is Thursday, February 28, 2019 1:30 p.m. Warner Chamber.		I really wanted to attend this one in person but I'm not going to be able to make it. Thank you in advance if you are able to attend in person.
The thought of having Audrey enter a kindergarten classroom where there is access to a gun really frightens me. Research indicates that more guns will not stop mass shootings but instead would put our children &amp; teachers at risk for gun violence &amp; accidental shootings.
Written testimony against LB343 is due by 5pm today.		This bill would allow Nebraska teachers or other school employees to carry guns in schools. If you want safe classrooms for our students, K12 or post-secondary, please write in &amp; oppose. Applies to private or public schools.

If you haven‚Äôt been thrilled with your choices during previous elections, it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Find your voice in 2019 and 2020. If there is something you are passionate about, use that energy and run.  Stop complaining, and take action. That‚Äôs what I did.
Voting is your right. It‚Äôs your civic duty.  Never forget that, even if you aren‚Äôt that enthusiastic about your choices on the ballot.
Statically speaking, I knew when I started that I‚Äôd probably lose the General Election. But, Team McClure worked hard anyway because we wanted to remind our neighbors about the importance of elections. We worked hard because we wanted to increase voter turnout.

Possible areas of reform: electronic health record interoperability, paving the way for telehealth for better rural access, improved transparency of pharmacy benefit managers, improved methods of prior authorization, improving Medicaid billing, modernizing the Stark Laws.
Part of the problem is the amount of overhead in our health care system. It's important to use a well thought out approach when reducing the regulatory burden impacting physicians &amp; hospitals.		Modernizing regs would be at step toward cost savings, while considering quality care.
When I first decided to run for office, I researched the United States health care system, which has substantial costs but not better quality when compared with other developed nations. https://t.co/OuiIaDGo9r
There are simple solutions that can help Americans, right now, while we work toward systematic change. The first step toward universal coverage is offering all Americans, and small businesses, the chance to buy into a public health insurance plan through Medicare.
Our current health care system is broken. I believe systematic change is necessary, which is why I support moving to a universal, or hybrid universal health care system. Many other developed nations have these systems in place, and have lower cost, quality care. https://t.co/wsKwcgJHno

I've worked with:	-EPA regs	-USDA regulations relating to biological products (vaccines) &amp; food labeling regulations.	-Food and Drug Administration regulations, including safety standards to keep animal medicines manufactured properly under federal guidelines.
Worker safety is a topic I'm familiar with because of past work experience. 		For every protectionist regulation that is dismantled by the current administration, Americans are at greater risk of on the job injuries, exposure to pollutants, &amp; a weakening of regulatory oversight

It‚Äôs important to use a well thought out approach to reducing the regulatory burden impacting physicians and hospitals. There is a clear need to update and modernize existing regulations, while still considering quality patient care.
When I first decided to run for office, I researched the United States healthcare system, which has substantial costs and decreased quality when compared with other developed nations. Part of the problem is the huge amount of overhead in our healthcare system.

... I am proud to receive the endorsement of Planned Parenthood Action Funds as my team and I work towards a victory in November so that I can fight for the health care rights of everyone.‚Äù ‚Äì Jessica McClure
‚ÄúI believe that access to quality, affordable health care is necessary. That access needs to include contraceptives, STD/STI testing and treatment, HPV vaccinations, family planning education, and other reproductive health services, regardless of a person‚Äôs background or income..

That is why I support Rep. Kennedy and Sen. Markey's legislative efforts to ban conversion therapies. I will continue to stand alongside the LGBTQIA+ community and promise to fight for laws that end therapies based solely on stigma, prejudice, and discrimination. #VoteBlue https://t.co/y8AdoEDrxk
Youth are especially at risk. Many sexual minority youths lack adequate legal protections from involuntary and coercive treatments that can irreparably harm.
Efforts to try to change sexual orientation can lead to family rejection, decreased self-esteem, increased depression and anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation and attempts. Significant harm can result when individuals undergo such ‚Äútherapies,‚Äù both emotional and physical.
Four decades worth of research, as well as many professional organizations (American Psychological Association, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Medical Association), have stated that conversion therapy does not work.
I want to address the use of conversion therapy on the LGBTQIA+ community. Conversion therapy does not work (aka. reorientation, reparative therapy, or forms of aversion therapy).

As a congresswoman, I will fight to ensure that LGBTQ couples have the right to become parents and to prevent religious affiliation from hindering the safety and well-being of children being the priority for adoption agencies.		https://t.co/Gy44jjEX7g 	#VoteMcClure #ElectWomen
Individuals and couples who identify within the LGBTQ community are no less qualified to be loving, wonderful parents based solely on their sexual orientation or gender identity. I stand with House Democrats in admonishing this move because it is blatantly anti-LGBTQ.
The amendment, introduced by Rep. Aderholt of Alabama, would ensure that agencies do not lose funding for exercising what they interpret as religious freedom. Adoption agencies should be working to find the best environment for children to thrive and be safe.
The House Appropriations Committee, which includes Rep. Fortenberry, recently approved a funding bill amendment from the GOP that would effectively make it legal for adoption agencies to refuse to place children with people who identify as LGBTQ.

Today our president failed to defend the people of American from foreign influence in our elections, and I‚Äôm deeply troubled at the implications this has for our future elections. I hope Congressman Fortenberry begins to echo my concerns. #VoteMcClure #ElectWomen #BlueWave2018
Today he released a statement on social media justifying the President‚Äôs actions. I couldn‚Äôt disagree with him more. When the President decides to stand up for a Russian autocrat over US intelligence, I would expect an outcry from all members of Congress, no matter their party.
Recently, however, I‚Äôm having a challenging time not standing up and shouting out against what is happening in our government. President Trump‚Äôs press conference in Helsinki was damaging to our nation, and I‚Äôm deeply concerned about @JeffFortenberry's complacency.
I like to focus my campaign for the House of Representatives in the first district on what I can do for this district, not about opposing the other side.  We are all Nebraskans and the political divide is hurting us as a community.

I stand in opposition to today's SCOTUS ruling, as we have always been a Nation that stands for religious freedom &amp; the right to practice one‚Äôs religion without government interference. I am deeply disheartened by today‚Äôs ruling. #StandWithMuslims #NoMuslimBanEver
It's bias against the Muslim community. I agree w/Sotomayor‚Äôs dissent, "Taking all the relevant evidence together, a reasonable observer would conclude that [it] was driven primarily by anti-Muslim animus, rather than by the Govt‚Äôs asserted national-security justifications".
Chief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that ‚ÄúThe text says nothing about religion‚Äù, though the ban effects five Muslim majority countries (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen).
Today the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of President Trump‚Äôs travel ban. This decision comes after the ban was blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii on the grounds that it was motivated by anti-Muslim religious discrimination.

I see standing up for separated immigrant families as a human rights necessity, not as flippant commentary included in an email. The families being impacted are real families, they are really hurting, and they deserve action from those in office.
@JeffFortenberry and I are in wild disagreement on this issue.		Granting #DACA recipients citizenship as a vital next step for the United States. The government must fulfill a promise it made when they came forward to participate in the program.		No strings attached to a wall.
Money spent on this wall could be put to much better use for health care, education, building internet infrastructure, or repairing transportation infrastructure.	#NoWall #congress2018
Quote 2/2:	It requires that the wall and provisions for DACA kids happen simultaneously."		Our "nice" congressman seems to feels that DACA recipients make a great bargaining chip to build an over-priced, fairly useless wall. #NoWall
Quote:	"A border wall and other appropriate security barriers are funded with changes to a merit-based immigration system that includes Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the children who are brought here through no fault of their own.
So, families being being ripped apart are considered "current difficulties." #FamiliesBelongTogther 	I can't watch video footage of what's going on. It brings me to tears.
Yesterday's stated, "The House of Representatives is considering options to not just resolve the current difficulties, but to forward significant and substantive changes to immigration law for the safety of America, in balance with the demands of justice and compassion."
Have you read @JeffFortenberry's Fort Report? I have. Including the one he emailed out yesterday. Nebraskan are desperate for answers about family separations at the border. They are calling the campaign line asking for answers, I'm assuming from a lack of response in Washington.

I want the same for my team. They are wonderful, talented people. They are my friends and they deserve to be featured on the prospectus.
I have been faced with criticism based on the way I look, how I dress, and the tone of my voice. I‚Äôm certainly not your typical suited up Washington D.C. politician, surrounded by equally polished cronies. At some point, I stopped caring and just decided to be myself.
As someone who is in the public eye right now, I expect criticism and #TeamMcClure certainly isn‚Äôt new to hearing the word ‚ÄúNO.‚Äù However, this response really bothers me. I think it‚Äôs because I expect more from people who support the Democratic platform.
I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around an email I received today. Someone decided to withdraw a pledged contribution because I featured my campaign team on my prospectus. He stated that because I featured ‚Äúalternative folks,‚Äù people in Nebraska wouldn‚Äôt be supportive of our campaign.
My campaign team wanted me to post some thoughts I shared on my personal Facebook page today.   So, get ready.  I'm about to share a long one. But, it has a point at the end. Keep reading. #TeamMcClure
If this administration hadn‚Äôt decided to give corporations a massive tax cut, the US would not be faced w/this kind of mounting debt. I deeply disagree w/ this proposal. The budget will be balanced on the backs of working class, poor, &amp; disabled, while corp shareholders profit.
The plan aims to take large cuts &amp; reductions to necessary programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families &amp; federal student loan programs while also repealing Dodd-Frank and setting up a potential repeal vote on the ACA.

@RepJayapal @BennieGThompson @RepZoeLofgren @RepAdams @repblumenauer @RepDonBeyer @RepBarragan @RepTedDeutch @RepLloydDoggett @keithellison @RepEliotEngel I absolutely agree with members of Congress who are urging the Subcommittee on Homeland Security on Appropriations to restrict the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs ability to separate families at the border.
As a mother, I cannot imagine the pain being experienced by the families torn apart by these series of injustices. One of my worst fears is being separated from my daughter and these families are living it. Every child deserves human kindness.
These children are said to be placed in foster homes until their nearest relative is identified, but as numerous reports from NBC &amp; Vox have shown, ORR-vetted homes were already 95% full as of June 7. This has lead to children being housed in abandoned Walmarts &amp; military bases.
I‚Äôm absolutely sickened by this administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù crackdown on #immigration that has lead to nearly 2,000 children being separated from their families.

#WomensRights The fight for equality is an ever-present force as I work on my campaign. Women only make up 21% of the US Senate, &amp; 19% in the US House of Representatives. 		Women are running for office in record numbers in 2018, &amp; I am proud to be a part of it. #BlueWave2018
#WomensHistoryMonth Black women suffragists sometimes faced discrimination w/in the movement. Some suffragists argued against enfranchising. After the 19th amend, State laws disenfranchised most black women in the South . Only 61 women of color have served in US Congress to date.
A constitutional amendment wasn‚Äôt proposed until war rhetoric was used to motivate Congress. It was argued that failure to extend voting rights to women might impinge their participation in the war effort. The House of Representatives proposed an amendment in January 1918.
Suffragists and Women‚Äôs rights lobbyists toiled for decades, trying to obtain complete voting rights at the State level. It was a long, slow struggle.
#WomensHistoryMonth Aug 18, 1920, the 19th amend to the Constitution was ratified, giving American women the right to vote. 	The first women‚Äôs rights gathering in the United States was held in 1848, taking the movement years to gain momentum.

Dickey Amendment should be repealed. It states that none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the CDC may be used to advocate or promote gun control. The CDC should be studying gun violence, since it‚Äôs impacting public health. #publichealth

In many cases of sexual assault NO is not an option.  No consent given b/c the victim is unable.  If we move to an affirmative consent standard, we are sending a clear message that sexual contact is wanted. Victims deserve more than allowing their silence to be heard as a YES.
Victims describe subjective experiences of fear, immobility, coldness, numbness and analgesia‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶entrapment, inescapability, futility, or hopelessness.
Toxic immobility has been most often described in the sexual assault literature, where it is referred to as rape-induced paralysis, &amp; is seen in survivors of physical assault.
According to individual accounts, toxic immobility in humans appears to present as a loss of the ability to move or call out and is thought to occur when a person is in imminent or actual danger
Its an active defense mechanism, your body‚Äôs response to dealing with threat. Freezing &amp; toxic immobility are part of the defense cascade. This human biological response is why I fully support adopting an affirmative consent standard in the case of sexual assault.
I support a yes mean yes affirmative consent standard because of the defense cascade. Freezing in moments of panic is part of it.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of the one defense behavior, fight or flight.
On average, there are over 321 thousand victims of rape and sexual assault each year in the United States (DOJ, 2014). #WeCanDoBetter #ElectMoreWomen #BlueWave
Today I spoke at #neleg about LB 988, affirmative consent (yes means yes). I stand up for women, &amp; not just with Federal policy. My statement was rightly overshadowed by the testimony from victims of sexual assault. Those who spoke today are truly courageous. #womensrights

I stand with the #LGBTQIA community, and promise to fight for laws that end conversion therapies because they are based solely on stigma, prejudice, and discrimination. #EqualityForAll
I support banning conversion therapies that try to change sexual orientation or gender identity. Youth are especially at risk. and lack adequate legal protections from involuntary and coercive treatments that can irreparably harm. #LGBTRights
Efforts to try to change sexual orientation can lead to family rejection, decreased self-esteem, increased depression &amp; anxiety, &amp; increased suicidal ideation &amp; attempts.  Significant harm can result from such ‚Äútherapies,‚Äù both emotional &amp; physical. #SuicidePrevention
There is no evidence or legitimate research that shows that sexual orientation can be altered.  Four decades worth of research, as well as many professional organizations have stated that conversion therapy does not work to change sexual orientation. #FactsFirst #SocialSciences
Today, I want to address the use of conversion therapy on lesbian, gay, &amp; bisexual individuals. Conversation therapy is misguided therapy used to try to change sexual orientation. Conversion therapy does not work. #LGBTRights

We owe it to victims, survivors, &amp; everyone impacted to continue researching ways to address mass shootings at a federal level.   Banning bump stocks &amp; ghost guns won‚Äôt get to the core of the problem, but it will be a step in the right direction.
A ghost gun is a firearm without serial numbers. There are websites &amp; businesses that allow you to buy the gun parts themselves and make your own gun, legally bypass background checks and registration regulations.  This, to me, is a terrifying thought.
After talking to gun owners, I believe that we must ban bump stocks &amp; ghost guns. As you‚Äôll remember, bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas mass murder in October. Congress must ban parts that are used exclusively in converting a weapon into a machine gun.  #bumpstockban
There were multiple High school shootings this week in a Kentucky, Dallas, &amp; in New Orleans. I wanted to revisit my commitment to addressing America‚Äôs mass shooting epidemic.  I‚Äôve committed to well researched policy to Washington. #KentuckySchoolShooting
"Poorly" isn't even the right word choice. Lives are being destroyed.
#DACA recipients deserve a clean #DreamActNow. They are not a bargaining chip to be leveraged. They are members of our Nebraska community. How can anyone support policy that treats members of our community so poorly. Is there really no humanity left in the GOP?
Our voices will be heard during the 2018 election. Our constant hard work is going to pay off. Our volunteers contacted around 200 people before the March on Saturday. This is what change looks like.  #BlueWaveIsComing #Midterms2018 #PrimariesAreComing #May15

I'm sure you've heard the news. Once again, @JeffFortenberry voted with corporate interests in mind. He just voted to decrease the corporate tax rate to 21%, a move that is expected to greatly increase the national debt.
#GOPTaxBill uses slower inflation indexing for individual tax brackets, and removal of individual health insurance mandate to help fund tax cuts for corporations.  13 million could lose health insurance. Trump republicans are  laughing all the way to the bank.  #sickening

@NPR @ChuckGrassley @GOP is so out of touch with the working class.  This report made me so angry.  Don't any republicans remember what it was like to work hard, and still have nothing left at the end of the pay period?
I listened to an @NPR interview with @ChuckGrassley (IA-R). He must have forgotten what it's like to work hard, but still have nothing left to save. His response to raising the ceiling on estate taxes was completely out of touch with reality. #TaxScamBill

@JeffFortenberry Maybe you are a sports fan. Guess what, the bill impacts you too. Charitable deductions for athletic event seating will be eliminated. It‚Äôs been suggested that this change will decrease the number of season ticket purchased, and decrease attendance at sporting events. #TaxScam
@JeffFortenberry Under the House Bill, stipends will be considered TAXABLE INCOME. This is absurd and cruel. Students will now have to pay more taxes, when they can already afford so little. #GradTax #GradTaxWalkout
@JeffFortenberry Educational benefits are no longer tax exempt, impacting 1,600 employees &amp; their dependents who use tuition remission benefits. #housetaxbill
@JeffFortenberry The purposed 20% excess tax would result in an additional $650,000 in taxes for the University. What a #TaxScam for Nebraska.
@JeffFortenberry it creates more #tax liability for the University.  Research that is not freely available to the public will be treated as taxable income, gets rid of advanced refunding bonds that save taxpayers &amp; students approximately 15 million in financing costs.

@JeffFortenberry @HouseGOP My definition of supporting #Nebraska family values is making sure families have access to affordable health care. Explain how taking money away from #medicare &amp; #Medicaid while gutting consumer protections will do this. I want a well thought out, fact based response.
@JeffFortenberry @HouseGOP #gop wants pregnancy to be considered a pre-existing condition. The bill for my daughter's birth was apprx $36,000. US #Healthcare costs are the most expensive, but Maternal Mortality Rates are actually rising. Did you come up with a solution to this disturbing trend bf voting?
@JeffFortenberry He voted "yes" to getting rid of many of the consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, a move that would be devastating to those with pre-existing conditions.  Guess what @HouseGOP, my daughter has a pre-existing condition and I'm working on #BlueWave2018

I'm going to think about @JeffFortenberry voting YES on ending #NetNeutrality while I phone bank tonight.
Remember, if you believe in a free and open internet, be sure to tell your friends what @JeffFortenberry is doing.
I love our free and open internet because it preserves our right to communicate freely online. The Trump administration's attempt to end net neutrality is yet another nod to big business. I believe that net neutrality is crucial for small business owners and entrepreneurs.
This is an issue our current Congressman and I truly disagree about, since he jvoted 'yes'' on ending net neutrality.  He sold us out, yet again.
According to Politico, it would also remove the legal foundation to tighten federal oversight of ISPs and would remove the general conduct standards, which give the FCC authority to police behavior by internet service providers it deems unreasonable.
FCC chairman Ajit Pai is aiming to dismantle rules that prohibit internet service providers (ISP)  from blocking or slowing web traffic or creating paid internet fast lanes.
The FCC just announced that it will vote to dismantle Net Neutrality rules based on Title II of the Communications Act.

This violence toward the trans community is unacceptable. As a congresswoman, I will promote legislation that helps to break down barriers for the trans community, including access to necessary health care and other services often denied to them.
I also want to recognize the achievements of the trans community. Just a few weeks ago, Danica Roem became the first out trans person to be elected to a state legislature. Phillipe Cunningham and Andrea Jenkins became the first trans people of color elected to a city council.
The National Coalition of Anti-Violence states that transgender women of color have an average life expectancy of 35. This is unacceptable and an inhumane way to treat others in our society.
So far in 2017, there have been 25 reported murders of transgender people. A number that only accounts for victims who've been reported correctly, as police reports often misgender victims.
Today is the nineteenth anniversary of Trans Day of Remembrance, a day dedicated to celebrating the memory of those who have lost their lives due to prejudice and hatred.

I see no benefit for Nebraskans. I stand with landowners who've voiced concern about the likelihood of a spill that will harm property and water supply. I'm anxiously waiting for the Public Service Commision to make the right decision.
Tomorrow, the Nebraska Public Service Commission is set to issue a decision on whether or not to begin construction on the northern leg of the Keystone Pipeline--which would run right through the indigenous land, farms, and ranches of Nebraska.
TransCanada recently had to shut down the Keystone Pipeline after it spilled an estimated 210,000 gallons across South Dakota farmlands. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, this was the third major spill in South Dakota alone.

@krackenpolisci First thing I told my canvassing volunteers is to be respectful because these are my neighbors.
@krackenpolisci I'm working on a few events and will send them out later today
@krackenpolisci I'm sorry that rude people attended the event and that you found it off putting. Right now I have no paid staff.
Sending out canvassing invites in the next few days. Join me and take action
I'm not going to sit around and let this happen. It's too important to do nothing. When I get stressed out, I take action.
LOVE that we had so many volunteers. We actually ran out of lit!!!!  Don't worry, we printed more. #flipthehouse
