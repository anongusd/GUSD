4/4 Huffing out her window, she continued to demand the farting stop.  The other riders and I who had already been in the car together for some time looked at each other.  Who was the culprit? It wasn't exactly a game of Clue.
3/4 The car smelled of onions and death. She huffed, rolled down her window, and demanded that whoever was farting immediately stop.  She then continued her sensory assault in clear violation of the United Nations ban on biological weapons.
2/4 However, I took an express pool a couple of nights ago, that included a driver, a couple, and me.  Until we picked up a less than sober lady from outside a Mexican restaurant.  She began farting uncontrollably.
1/4 I intended to recommend Uber Express Pool as among the most useful recent innovations. It provides an alternative to trains for extended commutes, as it costs less than a third of a regular Uber, and about half of a regular Uber Pool. I haven't seen it outside Silicon Valley.
