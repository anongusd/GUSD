@alice_the_malis Its all under not knowing how the opposite gender functions. I mean obviously we can understand on a base value of what women go through but we can't experience that overwhelming pain. As a man we can only compare the pain ,but nothing comes close.

@alice_the_malis couple minutes and birthing could last hours and maybe even days. Its just a no contest XD.
@alice_the_malis I guess it does depend on how hard you've been hit too haha. Yeah I don't understand how people can even compare the two. I mean if I had to scale it I would put the ball slapping between 3-5 on pain and of course 10 for the birthing. Simply because one literally only last a‚Ä¶.

@BenchingGaming Ok thats fine. I'm sorry you feel that way.
@CJDaMocha @DrBrewtonian @aravelle I looked it up because I have bad memory and that I don't have enough memory space to keep stuff like that when it doesn't pertain to me. The whole quit worrying thing was just banter because honestly I thought she was joking. I didn't know until it was too late.
@PixelJaden Solid idea its time to settle it in Smash XD.
RT @PixelJaden: @RovineV Play smash
@BenchingGaming Neither does a "regular" person so to speak. I have random thoughts everyday do they bother me no because in the end its trivial.
Just wondering what to do now.....hmm.
@DrBrewtonian @CJDaMocha @aravelle Sorry that I couldn't come up with a bigger response at the time I was talking in the conversation. I was making a simple comparison at the time.
@BenchingGaming @aravelle When your thinking about those thoughts do you ever think about something else?
@joelethrailkill @aravelle Glad to know you seem to think robots live among us.
@BogglingCon @aravelle I've read the description of Anxiety just to understand on the spot I wasn't going to put my foot in my mouth. No the conversation didn't start that way. It spiraled out of control in a sorts. I was only trying to help her feel better in the beginning and it didn't quite work.
@EhrgeizTV @aravelle Not quite what I was saying. I was saying its easy to understand when you have Anxiety its difficult to deal with it. I've read all the replies.
@SadKennith @aravelle Its easy to understand difficult to master so to speak. Thanks for insight though.
@CJDaMocha @aravelle Anxiety comes from a fear of a random outcome/event in base terms. Hence the metaphor.
@aravelle It wasn't anyone else that caused me to apologize. You were speaking clearly Aravelle. Just because i've never experienced Anxiety doesn't mean its not there. Guess I'm just lucky I don't let things get to me. I only wanted to cheer you up. Sorry it came out brash.
