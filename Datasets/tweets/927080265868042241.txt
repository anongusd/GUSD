@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe Idk, think he'll have a lot to answer for and honestly not sure how strong of a canidate he is. I do think that it is time for him, Warren and Sanders to step aside and make way for the new faces of their movements. Sure, endorse and be vocal but I think it's time for new faces
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe I could be wrong on MFA. I agreed, plus I don't see alot of excitement around him. I see alot of "he is going to run" but not a lot of "please please please run" like I do with Harris and Kennedy.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe I really believe so too. I however am afraid Biden is going to be the nominee so Harris, Kennedy and Booker may just be waiting their turn.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe I don't believe so? I know he voted against allowing importing perscriptions or price negotiability. He didn't speak about when the EpiPen cost skyrocketed, which those bills would have helped. I know alot of people who were going to be effected and I don't think it'll help him.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe Oh honestly I think she could really become a new leader for the progressive wing. She really is, I haven't found any credible claim she is not. I think Sanders will end up endorsing someone, I could see him endorse her.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe I think he'll lose a lot of support on healthcare grounds. But then again, the GOP has been cutting and gutting and proposed the American healthcare act which was unpopular so really depends on how he spins his stance and what the GOP throws into the ring.
@ChazNuttycombe Same here. I like the concept. Not sure about cost though. They seem to want to model it after the program during WW2.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe As a Bernie supporter I am not sure he is going to run, he seems to be leaning that way, but I think he made his mark, brought forward alot of issues and for that I'm grateful, but I can see the argument for moving forward to canidates like Harris, Kennedy, etc. Just not Cory üòÇ
@ChazNuttycombe @davidagordon9 Agreed.
@davidagordon9 @ChazNuttycombe I agree Harris is more progressive than Booker. I just can't get behind Booker, unless he was the nominee. I don't see the appeal to him and don't like where he is on healthcare and medicine. I do find Joe Kennedy appealing though.

@THEHermanCain Without the amendment right now 70% of the breaks in the bill will go to corps. While 30% go to the individuals. The whole purpose of the amendment is to shift that so individuals not only corporations get a tax cut. Either way the bill still isn't good. But just saying facts.
