@realDonaldTrump world is about to collapse as the #MUELLERPROBE report is about to be revealed &amp; The New Democratic Congress steps up the long overdue investigations into his administrations actions over the last two years.
#trump is so insecure he sees the #MUELLEPROBE as a potential expose of the one major achievement he has had in his messy corrupted life.	#trump really believes he is innocent of “collusion” because (he thinks) no one knows about the salacious videos #Putin has on him!
#trump is basically oblivious to the covert actions of #Manafort, Papadopoulus, Flynn &amp; others.	After the 2016 win, #trump, by obligation, invites Russians to WH as demanded by #Putin to test the strength of the control.	#trump continues to praise #Putin &amp; the breakdown starts.
Russian manipulation in concert with various collaborators including Wikileaks &amp; other #Clinton haters gains momentum with extreme right Republicans!	@HillaryClinton is personally targeted by #Putin &amp; takes full brunt of Russian onslaught!
Realizing that #trump could be so easily manipulated, Russia commissioned a sophisticated cyber invasion on American social media to assist his campaign.	#trump naively thinks he’s well liked &amp; gets sucked into Russia’s plan. Too late he realizes that Russia has him by the balls!
Wouldn’t it be ironic if @realDonaldTrump was just a stupid idiot that Russia saw as a simpleton that they could control way back!	So appealing to his vanity they compromise him with perverted sexual antics for future use!	Fortunately (for Russia) #trump decided to run for potus.
