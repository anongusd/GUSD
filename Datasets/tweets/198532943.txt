May POSTAL RECORD: Proposal a first step toward fixing, repealing WEP/GPO. https://t.co/06N1jgAOZH https://t.co/RIlnFsQqSV
.@jasoninthehouse: On govt to govt—if they're going to spend $$, they should be spending them, or looking at option of doing it, thru #USPS.
.@RepStephenLynch — 84% postal customers rate #USPS favorably; Congress about 6%. (Pew survey: https://t.co/X6VGtcnL3b )
.@jasoninthehouse — Your local letter carrier has an insight into communities; maybe an opportunity re census. @RepStephenLynch agrees.
.@jasoninthehouse — Government-to-government business needs to expand; letter carriers may understand communities better than anybody.
.@jasoninthehouse : Raising rates and cutting services is not the way. People want to have packages, goods delivered right now.
Postal Commerce's Lowrance: We need predictable postage rates among other needs.
NALC Pres Rolando: Collective-bargaining process has worked well toward negotiated agreements, arbitrated settlements.
.@jasoninthehouse notes that there's only 1 member now on #USPS Board of Governors. https://t.co/06N1jgSqoh Combine PRC &amp; BOG?
.@jasoninthehouse: Intends to release a discussion draft of a House bill soon; encourages suggestions.
RT @BillSomhigh36: You're damn right, employees are the backbone in most,if not all companies!! https://t.co/MdjZeFsPcb
.@RepLujanGrisham: When you reduce services, you reduce revenue stream. There can be a healthy balance; need to build revenue stream
.@RepLujanGrisham : Ride along with a postal employee and you'll see that #USPS is one of the most efficient postal services in the world.
.@RepStephenLynch — notes Oxford Strategic Consulting finding re USPS' #1 performance rating vs others in G20: https://t.co/tCLwsWFaer
.@LacyClayMO1: Asks NALC Pres Rolando about employee morale; Rolando says employees deal with four arenas in that regard.
PMG Brennan: Retiree health benefit account is more than 50% funded now.
PMG Brennan: Agrees with NALC Pres Rolando -- it's responsible to pre-fund; full Medicare integration will help address it.
NALC Pres Rolando: Coalition proposals more than adequately address pre-funding so that USPS can actually act like a private company.
NALC Pres Rolando: A lot of consolidations have been reaction to pre-funding. If USPS were a private company, it wouldn't have that burden.
.@RepLawrence: Notes that she worked for #USPS for a number of years; reiterates that the agency operates with no taxpayer funds.
.@RepStephenLynch : Postal employees have done their part to help USPS get on solid financial footing.
.@RepBrendanBoyle: We have to remember the value of what the local post office means to rural and urban areas.
.@RepBrendanBoyle: Is pre-funding unique to #USPS? NALC Pres Rolando: Yes; adopt consensus proposal &amp; retiree health gets overfunded.
.@RepBrendanBoyle notes Pew survey showing USPS' favorabilty as it relates to Congress': https://t.co/X6VGtcnL3b
USPS has shown operational profits over the past 3 years: https://t.co/lhbimhn7SO
PMG Brennan: We have an opportunity with PRC review of postage rates especially regarding cap on rates for market competitive products.
USPS receives NO tax $$ for operating expenses; relies on sale of postage, products &amp; services to fund operations. https://t.co/m8XdvxSLZ7
PMG Brennan: Majority of USPS losses are tied to pre-funding mandate.
RT @NCStateAFLCIO: @NALC_National @USPS opportunities like #postalbanking!
PMG Brennan: You can't cost-cut your way to prosperity. USPS needs to look at opportunities to grow.
PMG Brennan: tells @CongressmanHice USPS is not top-heavy in employees; universal service requirement drives needs.
Rep @GerryConnolly: Could lifting unique pre-funding burden ($5B+ per year), plus medicare integration, help turn around USPS finances?
Rep @GerryConnolly — we're hopeful we'll get postal reform this Congress.
Worth noting: Most mail to Congress gets extra screening; "means mail can take 10-14 days to reach destination." https://t.co/JypuG6SwWn …
RT @RepStephenLynch: .@NALC_National President Rolando mentioned that this would eliminate almost all of the $50B in unfunded liability.
.@RepMarkMeadows: Appreciates @NALC, other unions' willingness to work with him; 'I know I haven't been on your Christmas card list.'
NALC Pres Rolando: Proposal would be to invest up to 75% into higher-yield TSP Lifecycle Funds, managed and overseen.
.@RepStephenLynch: I think the coalition proposal ought to be adopted; a quick fix would be better retirement fund investment.
.@RepStephenLynch Too many USPS employees pay into Medicare but don't use it.
PMG Brennan: UPS and FedEx traditional competitors as well as partners (with USPS as last-mile delivery), "co-opetition."
PMG Brennan: Package growth alone won't offset losses; legislation for Medicare integration is also crucial.
PMG Brennan: USPS competes for deliveries every day; makes 30 percent of US package deliveries; strength is last-mile delivery.
PMG Brennan: Credit to @NALC, @NRLCA for working with USPS to be flexible in increasing delivery depth.
PMG Brennan: USPS has been innovating; partnerships with digital and e-commerce.
.@RepCummings: It's frustrating: We want USPS to bring in more money but we tie their hands/feet in their ability to do that.
.@RepJohnDuncanJr asks PMG about pension liability; integrating with Medicare would benefit USPS, she says.
.@RepJohnDuncanJr asks PMG Brennan about service reduction to 5 days a week; "no congressional consensus on that," she says.
NALC Pres Rolando: Our coalition's recommendations are grounded in best practices and common sense
NALC Pres Rolando: Burden 3—Postage rate-making process needs to focus on rate stability.
NALC Pres Rolando: Burden 2—Congress should consider retirement fund investment policy (right now in low yield Treasury accounts).
NALC Pres Rolando: 3 burdens hinder USPS—1. Prefunding of retiree health benefits, something no other biz or gov agency must do.
NALC Pres Rolando: We believe #USPS can thrive in the 21st century with the right public policy.
NALC Pres Rolando: It's no longer 2009, when doubts re #USPS viability were raised. USPS has returned to operational profitability.
Lowrance: Reforming pre-funding and greater USPS participation in Medicare are key to ensuring reliable, consistent mail service.
Now up: Assoc for Postal Commerce EVP Jessica Lowrance: Mail is, and will remain, a vital part of the American economy.
PRC Acting Chairman Taub: There are no easy answers, but answer we must.
PRC Acting Chairman Taub: USPS is the ONE government agency that touches every address in America.
Now testifying: Postal Regulatory Commission Acting Chairman Robert Taub.
Brennan: Reinstating the exigent surcharge is critical to restoring #USPS financial health. https://t.co/qp0cdzgXmH
PMG Brennan touts many reforms promoted by #NALC's coalition: https://t.co/gRm5irQzNU
PMG Brennan: Mr. Chairman—we need legislation now. #USPS #NALC
First to testify at today's hearing: @USPS Postmaster General Megan Brennan.
Also set to testify today, aside from NALC Pres Rolando, are the PMG, reps from PRC &amp; GAO, and a rep from Association for Postal Commerce.
@RepCummings: The @USPS is an institution on which all Americans rely.
OGR Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-MD): The unions have bent over backward to work with USPS to solve problems.
