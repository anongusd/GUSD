Labour is also pushing for an early vote, although the government has indicated it is likely to be delayed until January.
It‚Äôs an awful deal, the country doesn‚Äôt want it. Parliament would  overwhelmingly reject it. This isn‚Äôt personal, this is about the policy  being wrong for the country long-term.

Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and deputy  chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs  pushing for a harder Brexit, told ITV‚Äôs Good Morning Britain that Theresa May should stage the vote on the Brexit deal soon. He said:
