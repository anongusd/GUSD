#HR8 could make exercising a basic Constitutional right impossibly expensive for millions of Americans because it doesn’t put a cap on the cost of government background checks.
#HR8 would make it illegal for a domestic abuse or stalking victim to borrow a gun from a friend for protection, unless the threat is “imminent."
Did you know that #HR8 makes it illegal for law-abiding citizens to take basic steps to protect themselves from criminals and abusers?

While Democrats may prefer to use subpoenas as the first step in the investigative process, subpoenas are properly used as a tool of last resort. When you've got a witness coming in voluntarily, we're nowhere close to last resorts. https://t.co/wykoc7Puog
A subpoena is a powerful and coercive tool. And it is a tool that should be used as a last resort, especially when its use implicates the balance of powers that exist between Congress and another branch of government.
It's unfortunate that the first subpoena to be issued by this committee constitutes such a departure from the norms that have governed subpoena usage here in Congress.

⚡️ “Status quo at the southern border fuels humanitarian crisis” by @JudiciaryGOP		https://t.co/iuCR4dngKd
Porous borders are fueling the ongoing #HumanitarianCrisis, and Congress can act to implement #BorderSecurity that helps keep Americans safe and stop victimization at and around the border.
Heroin steals 300 American lives each week, and 90% of the drug flows across our southern border and into our communities. We need #BorderSecurity to stem the massive influx of heroin that’s destroying lives and dismantling families.
1 in 3. That’s how many women are sexually assaulted as they make the treacherous journey to the southern border. The #BorderCrisis is a humanitarian crisis, and women are falling victim to people who exploit this crisis every day.
2019 has already seen a 280% increase in family units arriving at the border—this #HumanitarianCrisis is unprecedented, and its stories reveal how dangerous illegal entry is. For the safety of families in America and to our south, Congress must support effective #BorderSecurity.
Did you know → Last month alone, over 20,000 minors were smuggled into the US. Human smugglers endanger children. Congress can help end the #HumanitarianCrisis at the border by fixing loopholes in federal law in order to protect children there and help them get safely home.
The #HumanitarianCrisis at our southern border has made it very clear that the status quo is not enough to answer this crisis and help hurting people. We need #BorderSecurity to keep Americans and people around the border safe.

@RepGoodlatte ✅ #BREAKING: @HouseJudiciary approves @TomRooney's #HR506, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act, to punishes those who knowingly scheme to defraud veterans of their federal benefits. https://t.co/eD5RcE7rPD
@RepGoodlatte Full statement from @RepGoodlatte on the "Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act": https://t.co/Uo3W7uJMnL
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR506, which has the support of the veterans’ service community, addresses this conduct by ensuring that federal law applies in situations where a fraudster may not yet have violated the federal wire or mail fraud statutes.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: This sort of conduct – swindling an elderly veteran out of his or her benefits, and doing so face-to-face – is truly reprehensible, and worthy of Congress’s attention.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Criminals are taking advantage of a loophole in federal law by conducting in-person seminars or meeting in-person at a veteran’s home or assisted living facility.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: In recent years, fraudsters have increasingly targeted veterans, particularly elderly veterans, and often those in low-income housing, in order to defraud those veterans out of their Veterans’ Affairs benefits.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR506 closes a small but significant loophole in federal law and provides federal prosecutors with an additional tool to pursue criminals who seek to defraud veterans.

@RepGoodlatte @TheJusticeDept .@RepGoodlatte: the reality is that this Committee’s #FISA702 legislation struck a balance that promotes national security and civil liberties.
@RepGoodlatte @TheJusticeDept .@RepGoodlatte: The taint of politicization should concern all Americans who have pride in the fairness of our nation’s justice system.
@RepGoodlatte @TheJusticeDept .@RepGoodlatte: You, along w/ Attorney General Sessions, have to date declined to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the improprieties that continue to surface related to the handling of the Clinton email investigation and other events surrounding the 2016 election.
@RepGoodlatte @TheJusticeDept .@RepGoodlatte: We hope to hear your assessment of the foregoing conflicts, whether individuals are being held accountable, and whether you still have confidence in the judgement of the Special Counsel you named and supervise.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: @TheJusticeDept investigations must not be tainted by individuals imposing their own political prejudices.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Reports on the political predisposition, and potential bias, of certain career agents and Department lawyers on Special Counsel Mueller’s team are deeply troubling to all citizens who expect a system of blind and equal justice.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Yet I and many on this Committee now find ourselves in the very difficult position of questioning the actions of both prior and current Department and FBI leadership.

@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 preserves and protects the right guaranteed to us by the Second Amendment and ensure that those prohibited by existing law from receiving a firearm are prevented from doing so.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #FixNICS ensures people who are legally prohibited from having guns, like those with violent felony convictions, do not obtain them.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Importantly, this bill also contains the Fix NICS Act to ensure that state and federal agencies enter all relevant records into the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only better prepared to act in their own self-defense, but also in the defense of others.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 allows law-abiding gun owners with valid state-issued concealed firearm permits, or those who live in constitutional carry states, to carry a concealed firearm in any other state that also allows concealed carry.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 ensures that law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment right does not end when they cross state lines.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: 2 fundamental principles regarding firearms policy. 1) the right guaranteed to law-abiding Americans by the Second Amendment must be aggressively protected and preserved. 2) the laws we have on the books need to be enforced to the fullest extent possible.

@RepGoodlatte Full statement from @RepGoodlatte on the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act: https://t.co/6dy1bxdcpN
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 is about the simple proposition that law abiding Americans should be able to exercise their right to self-defense even when they cross out of their state’s borders. That is their Constitutional right.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 will not arm criminals. If someone is a criminal who is prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm, nothing in this bill would allow that person to purchase or possess a firearm, let alone carry one in a concealed fashion.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38 maintains right of each state to determine permitting requirements but allows citizens who meet the qualifications for concealed carry in their home states to carry in any state they may be travelling in
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: A 2013 peer-reviewed study in Applied Economic Letters, found that between 1980 and 2009, "states with more restrictive concealed carry laws had gun-related murder rates that were 10% higher."
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, would ensure these time-honored rights to "keep and bear arms" extend to all law-abiding Americans.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #SCOTUS concluded that the Second Amendment "guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation" and that "central to" this right is "the inherent right of self-defense."
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads, “a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  #2ndAmendment

.@RepGoodlatte: Mr. Attorney General, our country is at a crossroads. Our constituents are gravely concerned that our justice system does not work for them... I implore you to work with us to continue that trend.
.@RepGoodlatte: We commend your efforts to combat illegal immigration, protect our citizens from criminal aliens, and to fight back against so-called “sanctuary cities.”
.@RepGoodlatte: Under AG Sessions leadership at #DOJ, there has been a significant increase in the prosecution of firearms offenses in the United States. Enforcing these laws is the most effective way to combat violent crime in our cities and neighborhoods.
.@RepGoodlatte: There is bipartisan support for criminal justice reform in Congress and with AG's help we can make changes that crack down on violent offenders while also doing more to rehabilitate federal prisoners and curb abuses in the system, as well as excessive punishments.
.@RepGoodlatte: In addition to investigations, especially important given the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in the United States is the reauthorization of #FISA702 through the USA Liberty Act. We cannot afford to play politics with national security.
.@RepGoodlatte: Consequently, we had no choice but to open our own joint investigation, with @GOPoversight, to review DOJ and FBI’s handling of the investigation into former Secretary Hillary Clinton and her mishandling of classified information.
.@RepGoodlatte: We have called on you to name a second special counsel to restore the public’s confidence in our justice system.  Numerous matters connected to the 2016 election remain unresolved.  To date, the Department has not appointed a second Special Counsel.
.@RepGoodlatte: Our last DOJ oversight hearing with Attorney General Loretta Lynch was, plainly, a disservice to the American people.
.@RepGoodlatte: While much has been done to correct the improper political engagement by the Department of Justice under the Obama Administration, more work must be done to ensure the Department is operating to impartially administer justice.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: @TheJusticeDept must have the confidence of the American people, even when decisions are not always well-received.

@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Criminals and terrorists have abused the US asylum system to both gain entry as well as to prevent their removal.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: Since asylum status leads directly to citizenship, it is important that steps be taken to prevent fraud and abuse in system.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: The US gov does not have the resources or the ability to truly validate the actual veracity of each asylum seeker’s claim.
@RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: The US does and should have asylum laws to grant relief to individuals who are truly persecuted. However fraud is pervasive.

@RepTomMarino @RepGoodlatte .@RepGoodlatte: #HR2887 would provide a clear congressional response that would, at the same time, protect states’ rights.

Chairman @RepGoodlatte Statement at Markup of #HRes111: https://t.co/B8SbXpnoiq
.@RepGoodlatte: We can &amp; will investigate any credible allegations of misconduct by Executive, but not thru politically charged resolutions
.@RepGoodlatte: #HRes111 is about politics, not information. Our oversight efforts can, and should, be better than that.
.@RepGoodlatte: Let’s be clear, #HRes111 would have no effect at all on the Attorney General’s obligation to produce documents to Congress.
.@RepGoodlatte: To the extent that there is any merit to the subject matter covered by this resolution, #HRes111 is premature.
.@RepGoodlatte: In fact, the Committee has already taken action to address some of the issues raised in #HRes111
.@RepGoodlatte: by adopting oversight plan, Committee has committed itself to conduct robust and thorough oversight of the Executive Branch.
.@RepGoodlatte: #HRes111 is unnecessary, premature, and not the best way to conduct oversight over the issues covered by the resolution.
.@HouseJudiciary is now considering #HRes111, @RepJerryNadler's resolution of inquiry.

.@RepGoodlatte: Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act ends this lack of transparency of the #EAJA
#EAJA can only work well if there is data on awards, not just anecdotal evidence. No reporting since 1995.
.@RepGoodlatte: #EAJA provides financial incentives to challenge the fed govt or defend themselves from lawsuits brought by federal govt
.@RepGoodlatte: despite large amount of taxpayer $ paid out each year, fed govt no longer keeps track of amount of fees awarded
.@RepGoodlatte: pursuant to #EAJA, fed govt pays millions of $ in legal fees &amp; costs to parties to lawsuits that involve the fed government.
