As we recognize #TNBCDay, I extend my support to the thousands of women and men affected by this devastating disease and highlight the need for continued education, research, and action to find a cure for breast cancer.
I’m humbled to sponsor a resolution designating today as National Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, highlighting a cause near and dear to me and my family. My daughter, Lauren, battled #TNBC for two years with incredible courage and tenacity. #TNBCDay https://t.co/soMq1kq23a
I often find myself in a book at the end of a long day and believe reading to be one of the most empowering, thought-provoking activities. In honor of #ReadAcrossAmerica Day, I sat down with my granddaughter, Arabella, to read one of her favorite stories. 	https://t.co/eo0xKNcH6D

It's not too much to ask that gun buyers wait 10 days before being cleared to own a deadly weapon. Closing the #CharlestonLoophole is a perfect example of common sense legislation the federal gov't can enact and I am proud to support this bill. #HR1112 https://t.co/3ZZfMteJ4p
I am so proud to cast my vote for this historic legislation. Not just thoughts and prayers – but real, sensible, bipartisan legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands.

Together, we can end gun violence. Today, we take one step closer. #HR8

It doesn’t just take a village – it takes a school. Students go to school not only to learn in a classroom setting, but to get essential services they may not have access to at home. These staff are a valuable resource to ensure all students are given an opportunity to thrive.
"Non-teacher" staff does not mean "non-essential." School psychologists, reading specialists, and librarians (aka "non-teacher" staff) play a critical role in child development, particularly if a child lives in poverty, has experienced trauma, or faces crisis at home. https://t.co/7vS8xxiEpv

In coming days, we must come together in good faith to prevent another disaster and work towards a bipartisan deal that provides the certainty and stability American families deserve. #NoShutdown

These weapons then flow onto the streets and into the hands of dangerous criminals, posing a clear threat to public safety. That is why the DOJ and AFT must play a central role in combating this serious issue that is plaguing our community and communities across the country.
#ICYMI Last week I sent a letter to Acting AG Whitaker calling on him to take action to address the growing instances of gun shop burglaries. Last year, a local gun shop in Rochester was burglarized twice in one week -- and seven times since 2007 alone. https://t.co/2eFZp0aibD

We face a clear threat to our national safety. We need improved leadership within the ATF, a stronger commitment to gun shop safety, and decisive action to prevent violators from retaining their federal licenses to sell dangerous weapons. #GunLawsSaveLives #EndGunViolence
These dangerous weapons enter the black market and underground weapons pipelines where they are sold on the order of thousands of dollars. The local shops are rarely held accountable for failing to secure their firearms and the situation never abated.
Here in Monroe County, one gun shop has been burglarized seven times since 2007. Nationwide, more than 575 gun shops were burglarized in 2017, releasing thousands of guns into the streets and into the hands of criminals. #EndGunViolence https://t.co/HlZKZ7ORic

If the Senate and the President were truly worried about the safety and well-being of Americans, they would join us in passing this legislation to re-open the Department of Homeland Security immediately and #EndTheShutdown.
Border patrol agents, members of the Coast Guard, transportation security officers and more are going without pay while critical security operations are stymied nationwide. That's why today the House passed legislation to fund DHS and ensure employees receive back pay.
The biggest threat to our security is this president’s refusal to reopen gov't. @realDonaldTrump claims to be concerned about border security yet is unfazed by the very real impact #TrumpShutdown has on the brave men and women dedicated to keeping us safe. https://t.co/7f7Og3jNYN

Which is why I joined my colleagues in co-sponsoring immediate relief by offering loans that:		✅Are interest free.	✅Are worth up to $6k.	✅Do not require a credit check.	✅Are issued even during the shutdown.		This is the least we could do for these hardworking federal workers.
Federal workers were innocent bystanders when the #TrumpShutdown began and should not bear the burden of its effects. These workers simply want to be able to pay their bills and provide for their families
Our ninth attempt at opening the govt would fund all 7 remaining appropriations bills through Feb. 28. The President and Senate Republicans have an obligation to do what is best for Americans and join us in bipartisan solutions that restore stability and certainty to our nation.
We are 27 days into the #TrumpShutdown and that’s 27 days too long. My colleagues and I in the House are yet again offering the President a clear pathway to end this shutdown that is hurting millions of American families and severely damaging our economy. https://t.co/jGvd33qXC4

Day 26 of the #TrumpShutdown and over 800,000 Americans are STILL without pay, without answers, and without assurance they can continue to provide for their families.

The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of American families are at stake. That's why today the House passed measures to ensure federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay receive compensation at the earliest date possible after the shutdown comes to an end.
This President has threatened, without any reservation or consideration for the millions of Americans being impacted, that he is willing to keep the government shut down for ‘years' - jeopardizing the financial security of over 14,000 New Yorkers who are going without paychecks. https://t.co/wo3SvCpMSh
My colleagues and I are committed to honoring our pledge to put your needs first. We will continue to support and pass bipartisan measures that fund the government and ensure Americans are protected. #EndTheShutdownNow

Our nation is at a crisis point. Every American’s right to clean air, clean water, and access to safe and sanitary parks has been jeopardized by this President’s defiant refusal to return sanity to our nation and reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown

That is why the House has passed legislation to immediately fund these vital services and programs. It is time to restore order to our government. Our families deserve better.
Furthermore, this #TrumpShutdown has imperiled the safety of our  transportation system with thousands of air traffic controllers and highway workers furloughed or working without pay.
With each passing day of the #TrumpShutdown, more and more Americans are being endangered – including roughly 2.2 million low-income families and individuals who are facing eviction because they can no longer access critical rental assistance programs.
This is another demonstration that the House majority is committed to governing responsibly and working #ForThePeople. We will continue to offer the president every opportunity to re-open the government so we can address the matters pressing our nation. #EndTheShutdown
This legislation accomplishes the following: 	✅Guarantees families will still receive essential SNAP benefits.	✅Ensures FDA and USDA can continue preventing public health epidemics.	✅Provides assistance to farmers.	✅Supports rural infrastructure development projects.
That is why I joined @HouseDemocrats in passing the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2019 Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA and Related Agencies appropriations bill to re-open the Department of Agriculture. It is nearly identical to the version that passed the Senate. #EndTheShutdown
The President’s refusal to reopen the government has put millions at risk, including families and individuals who rely on the critical support SNAP benefits provide and our nation’s hardworking farmers whose livelihoods depend on essential government services. #EndTheShutdown
It is inexcusable that the President has allowed this shutdown to reach this point. The House has passed and continues to pass measures that will fund the government so legislators can get to work #ForThePeople.
Tomorrow morning federal employees will wake up and see they don't have the paycheck they rely on to pay their bills, buy their groceries, and support their families. https://t.co/yz9TKqq0o7

That is why I joined the @HouseDemocrats in taking action to protect NYer's access to healthcare by passing a resolution that strengthens Congress's hand to intervene in this lawsuit, which would strike down the #ACA including its key provisions and protections.
Bottom line: we should be making it easier, not harder for everyday Americans to obtain health coverage they need and deserve. #ProtectOurCare
The Texas v. US lawsuit would wreak havoc by eliminating: 	✖️Protections for 130m people w preexisting conditions	✖️Medicaid expansion that covers 15m people	✖️Insurance tax credits used by 9m Americans	✖️Bans on discriminating against women	#ProtectOurCare
Now more than ever the American people are counting on Congress to stand up and fight back against those who seek to dismantle our health care system and the fundamental protections that it guarantees. #ProtectOurCare
.@WillowCenterROC, in my district, is operating with no assurance it will be able to continue offering critical services after January 18. We must end this harmful shutdown, reopen the government and get to work. American lives depends on it.

Rather than inciting fear and escalating the crisis, we must come together to fund the gov’t. Congress has offered Trump a clear path to reopen the gov’t and it‘s his duty to join us to enact a responsible, bipartisan solution to restore certainty and stability for the Americans.
The gov’t shutdown has created an economic crisis that lies squarely on the President’s shoulders. Nearly 1m federal workers and their families are w/o pay while essential services to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the American people have come screeching to a halt.
Tonight the President demonstrated again that he lacks the courage to swallow his pride, stand up and lead our nation. Rather, he has chosen to continue cowering behind his own wall of misinformation and misguided priorities that harm communities and families across the nation.

To allow this shutdown to continue any further would be entirely irresponsible and, ultimately, a failure of the President’s leadership. We must not give up on our efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions that unite, not divide us, and address the issues that truly matter.
Congress has offered @realDonaldTrump a clear path to reopening the government and it is now incumbent upon him to set aside his demands for a wasteful border wall and demonstrate that he is capable of doing what is right.
Today, my colleagues and I in the House followed through on our commitment to immediately go to work #ForThePeople by passing necessary and common-sense spending measures that will restore stability to our government and certainty for millions of Americans.
I am honored to be sworn-in to my first full term as a member of the House. I look forward to working with @SpeakerPelosi and my colleagues in the #116thCongress as we seek to create a more perfect union by creating opportunity for everyone who calls our great nation home. https://t.co/SBJd4uNXmQ

Grateful there were no serious injuries. My thoughts are with @GreeceTown and @GreeceCentral and I wish the two individuals taken to the hospital a swift recovery. https://t.co/EHKqBmUJIf
As we turn over the calendar, I extend my best wishes for a #HappyNewYear filled with good health and prosperity for all. https://t.co/HMnrUeyMTw
It’s unconscionable that the President has prioritized a needless vanity wall over the millions of Americans who have been harmed by this government shutdown. https://t.co/JgJnR857ca
From Umoja to Imani, let us come together each day of Kwanzaa to celebrate all we have accomplished, all that is still possible, and all we aspire to be. I wish everyone a happy and blessed #Kwanzaa. https://t.co/hX20pGwi9L
Wishing peace and joy to all this holiday season and always. From my family to yours, have a safe and #MerryChristmas. https://t.co/wyjbu6gFxs
My prayers and sympathies are with Dan’s family during this difficult time.
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and fellow former Assembly Majority Leader, Dan Walsh. Dan was a dedicated public servant whose contributions have touched the lives of so many New Yorkers. https://t.co/mQYpGiOitD
This is an epidemic we must address immediately, and yet another reason we must work towards a bipartisan agreement to fully and responsibly fund the government and avoid a shutdown.
#VAWA provides essential support and protections victims of sexual assault and domestic violence need and deserve - but it is set to lapse under a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/OFF3kp9uZD
The President’s decision to turn his back on the agreement that would have avoided this needless shutdown hurts millions of Americans while forcing them to foot the bill. That is why we must come together and work towards a bipartisan solution to fully fund our govt immediately.
On top of that, over 400,000 federal employees will be forced to work over the holidays without pay - including law enforcement officials, corrections officers, TSA workers and Coast Guard employees.
🚨 Food safety inspections will be significantly curtailed 	🚨 Small business loans will be halted	🚨US exports will be delayed	🚨 State and local law enforcement training programs will cease
As the President continues his attempts to push through funding for an ill-conceived border wall, let’s not forget about the 400,000 federal employees and he many essential services that will be impacted by a government shutdown:
I thank General Mattis for his decades of service and commitment to our country. https://t.co/5v2QlhA9rv
Gen. Mattis was a thoughtful and steadying leader in an otherwise chaotic and dysfunctional administration. His resignation is cause for great concern regarding the future of our nation’s security and the preservation of alliances critical to the wellbeing of the American people.
To prioritize the funding of a border wall over the millions of people who will be harmed by an avoidable government shutdown is a betrayal of the American people’s trust and the President’s fundamental responsibility to ensure the stability of our government.
We are now 12 hours away from the #TrumpShutdown. The President has failed one of the most basic tests of leadership by reneging on the bipartisan agreement that would have avoided a needless and harmful government shutdown. https://t.co/b10EdYerSt
I'm so proud that the House has passed legislation I sponsored to dedicate the Fairport Post Office to my dear friend and a true American patriot, Louise Slaughter, and her husband Bob Slaughter. This is a fitting tribute to a truly remarkable couple. https://t.co/5K7jZRGHwe
Sadly, this was yet another missed opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner to advance meaningful tax policy changes that would improve the lives of working Americans across the country.
This new tax bill continues to disproportionately benefit corporations, not middle-class families, and further inflates the national deficit by nearly $55 billion with no plan to pay down our debt.
Today, House Republicans rushed a last-minute, partisan #TaxBill which fails to address the devastating impacts of the 2017 GOP tax bill—which squarely took aim at New York State by eliminating the state and local tax deduction and profited only the wealthiest Americans.
Proud to cast my vote in support of the #FirstStepAct which takes an important step to address meaningful criminal justice reform. It is my hope that this legislation is the first of many bipartisan agreements to come as we work towards ensuring a most just society for all. https://t.co/sYBFNxmdTO
These new requirements will cut access to critical food assistance programs and have devestating effects for millions of struggling families. We must work to protect food security for all Americans, not take it away from those most in need. https://t.co/FetQh8QbFI
As the first African American woman to be elected to office in Monroe County, Connie's commitment to breaking down barriers was awe-inspiring. I join all of Rochester in mourning her passing and extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to the Mitchell family.
It was a privilege to speak on the House floor today to honor the life of Connie Mitchell, an iconic civil rights activist and leader in the #ROC community who passed away on December 14. https://t.co/KtDRYYfEBZ

Congratulations to @BobDuffyROC, @MCCPresident and all of the members of the FLREDC on being named a Top Performer! Grateful for your continued commitment to investing in our region and moving the #FLXFWD. https://t.co/m7OOtzcOfw
Now more than ever we must fight back against those who seek to dismantle the fundamental protections that no person should be denied. That’s why I will work tirelessly with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to uphold &amp; protect access to healthcare for every American.
This decision will come with dire consequences that include the elimination of protections for people with preexisting conditions, increased health care and prescription drug costs, and potentially a 50 percent increase in the uninsured rate.
This ruling, if allowed to stand, will pull the rug out from under millions of Americans who rely on the #ACA for health coverage. https://t.co/lC5z2XFJeI
On #BillofRightsDay, we honor a document that is an essential tenant of our democracy. Let us join in commemorating the ratification of the #BillofRights and celebrate the essential freedoms it guarantees to everyone who calls this great nation home. https://t.co/Xgh9g1PehR

Connie’s commitment to breaking down barriers was nothing short of inspiring, and her contributions helped to open the door of opportunity for so many people in our community. I extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to the entire Mitchell family during this difficult time.
I join all of Rochester in mourning the loss of Connie Mitchell, an iconic activist and leader who dedicated her life to the pursuit of equality and racial justice. https://t.co/vvdzQhL3us
Louise Slaughter was a dear friend, a trailblazer, and a champion for families in #NY25 and across the nation. I’m so proud to honor her legacy by introducing legislation to designate the Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office in their home of Fairport, NY. https://t.co/uWC60i8BLF
These staggering statistics underscore why I’m co-sponsoring a series of bills to ban assault weapons, strengthen background checks, enact red flag laws and more. It’s time for common-sense gun reform. #GunReformNow  https://t.co/gh94w3nv0L
Please join me in wishing the @USNationalGuard a very happy birthday! For 382 years, these brave men and women have devoted themselves to protecting our community and our country as citizen soldiers. We are all grateful for their courageous service. #NationalGuardBirthday https://t.co/MkRbwqU8wy

It’s been 3 years since the #ParisAgreement and we have more evidence than ever demonstrating the dire consequences if we don’t address #ClimateChange immediately. There’s no time to waste – we must #ActOnClimate now and protect the future of our planet. https://t.co/ncnIxGE9Dy
Beyond this legislation, I will continue to work with my colleagues to advance measures that support local farmers, bolster our agriculture industry, and protect food security for all Americans.
In addition, the #FarmBill takes important steps to support the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of our agriculture economy in the global marketplace.
Proud to cast my vote in favor of the bipartisan #FarmBill which effectively and comprehensively addresses the needs of farmers, strengthens our rural communities, and ensures vulnerable families have access to critical SNAP benefits programs. #FarmBill2018
These are important steps towards meaningful, common-sense gun reform, and I will continue to work diligently with partners like @Bradybuzz, @MomsDemand, @Everytown and more to advance measures that strengthen our gun laws and protect all Americans.
We cannot allow the never-ending string of senseless gun violence that has plagued our nation to continue. That's why I'm proud to co-sponsor #gunsense legislation to ban assault rifles, strengthen background checks, ban bump stocks, and implement red flag laws nationwide. https://t.co/4bhrv2xN6m
Today, I cast my vote in support of HR1162 which reaffirms our commitment to #Ukraine and condemns actions which seek to undermine their sovereignty as a nation. #NY25 boasts a vibrant Ukrainian community and I am proud to continue standing with them in support and solidarity.
I was proud to submit a statement to the Congressional Record recognizing and applauding Drs. Strickland and Mourou for this incredible accomplishment. I join the entire #Roc community in celebrating their innovation and important contributions to the scientific community.
Congratulations to Drs. Strickland and Mourou on this outstanding achievement! Their ground-breaking  inventions and research completed at @UofR are a testament to the world-class programs and opportunities offered at the university. https://t.co/8SOAPhq7GJ

#VAWA provides essential support and protections victims of sexual assault and domestic violence need and deserve, and that’s why I’m proud to cosponsor its reauthorization and work tirelessly toward its passage before the December 7 deadline. #ProtectSurvivors #VAWA4All
This morning I joined Willow Domestic Violence Center, @PPCWNY &amp; community partners to call for the immediate reauthorization of #VAWA. More than 4 million women in the US experience physical violence by an intimate partner every year - this is an epidemic that cannot be ignored. https://t.co/Og1mQufj1W

We must come together in a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation to focus on what’s most important to the American people and avoid a needless government shutdown that would impair these priorities.
In my district, what we want instead is to take a unified approach to ensuring quality, affordable healthcare, protecting Social Security and Medicare, creating more good-paying job opportunities, and addressing the gun violence epidemic that is devastating our communities.
This morning, I was proud to speak on the House floor to express my opposition to a senseless, entirely avoidable government shutdown triggered by a potential border wall that is ill-conceived and fails to address the more pressing challenges facing our nation. https://t.co/MpKLvEM5kZ
Time is running out to restore #NetNeutrality! It is critical that the internet remains a level playing field that is accessible to all people. We must act NOW to overturn the FCC's #NetNeutrality repeal and protect a free and open internet for all. https://t.co/nKKV60K9zV

Despite what President Trump may think,#climate change is real, and it’s happening — that’s why we need to take immediate action to safeguard our planet for current and future generations. https://t.co/SlR3mbGHnc
With Leader Pelosi at the helm, we will take important steps towards achieving meaningful reforms and putting government back in the hands of the people.
Like me, @NancyPelosi knows that we must work to lower healthcare costs, create more economic opportunities, enact commo-nsense solutions to prevent the devestating gun violence that plagues our nation, and take action to protect our environment for future generations.
In these critical times, it’s more important than ever that the Democratic Majority has a leader with the experience and skill necessary to make our shared priorities a reality and create an America that works for everyone — that’s why I’m proud to support @NancyPelosi. https://t.co/bIeTaNeq0T
The new Democratic majority will work to:		✅ End the influence of dark money in politics	✅ Implement new ethics reforms	✅ Ensure fair elections	✅ Enact common-sense solutions to prevent gun violence	✅ Lower healthcare costs	✅ Create a government that works #ForThePeople https://t.co/ac4z2QiAID
