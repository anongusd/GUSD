One fascinating theory on Granger as ranking member - She might be better positioned to help Houston with Harvey aid in this slot rather than chairwoman because Democrats may bring back earmarks.
First pass on our story, more to come: U.S. Rep. Kay Granger tapped to be Republican's top member on powerful Appropriations Committee https://t.co/yJ6CnkCfdg
A LOT of people questioned whether Granger had the votes for the steering committee recommendation as late as this morning. My sense is she killed it in her presentation and that put momentum in her favor.
It is hard to describe how many GOP problems are averted on two fronts with this recommendation: If she didn't get it, there would have likely been an explosion of outrage from female Republican members of Congress and very unhappy Texas donors.
Kay Granger secured the GOP steering committee nomination to be the next ranking member of the US House Appropriations Committee, per her spox.

@BudKennedy @ContrarianDave @cd_hooks I called Mayor Parker the day Beto announced to gauge her reaction. Her response was “who?” That I have to defend a point like this in my reporting to someone who works in journalism is absolutely absurd.
@ContrarianDave @cd_hooks Flippantly discrediting reporting without any evidence is one of the reasons journalism is in a crisis.
@ContrarianDave @cd_hooks Are you saying I am lying? Because it was a direct conversation with the Mayor and me.

Here is the ongoing story from @PatrickSvitek and me on the #TXSEN race https://t.co/Qjq2VrhcFf
I've long covered the issue of how Texas hasn't sent a freshman female to Congress for a full term since 1996. We are on track for a full blown CLASS of female members if these numbers hold.
I will always put 2016 as the most shocking night of my career. But what I am seeing in the Democratic early vote tonight in Texas is getting pretty damn close to that.
Again, the bellwether of Texas is Tarrant County and it is incredibly tight. Here is the story I published a week ago: https://t.co/L8dxEYd0VR
RT @ewaltersTX: Democrat Colin Allred ahead of Republican incumbent Pete Sessions by 14,000 plus votes, according to early returns from Dal…
Allred is WAY up over Sessions in the early vote. He's up by 9 per CNN https://t.co/eYJkqk2yVO #TX32
Link: https://t.co/nWUsttjHxC
Early vote -- Jana Lynn Sanchez has the lead in Tarrant. She's got to run up the score here to offset Navarro/Ellis. She's running to replace Joe Barton in #TX06. This should be a safe R seat. Very very very early in the night but interesting.
3/ The bellwether, my home county - Tarrant, is nearly split in the early vote - Cruz up by less than one: https://t.co/nWUsttjHxC
2/ How much do Dems run up the score in Harris (Houston) and Dallas Cos. I will underscore, only in May did I meet with Democrats whose main goal was to hold Harris in a midterm. Very different expectations now.
1/ Here are key Texas counties to watch for #TXSEN: We need to see how the suburban counties break down. Beto might win them outright or lose less badly: Collin, Denton, Williamson, Fort Bend

@MeetThePress @chucktodd Thanks so much guys!
@MeetThePress 4/  It is a quickly diversifying district and I will be very anxious to see how the vote breaks down there on Election Day. //end
@MeetThePress 3/ Lastly, I think one of the most fascinating counties in Texas to watch is a place called Fort Bend. It's suburban Houston and its population base is Sugar Land (home of former House Maj Leader Tom Delay.)
@MeetThePress 2/ I will say this, on an anecdotal level: I spoke with some Latino women at a polling location yesterday in Fort Worth. They voted for O'Rourke and did it for the same reason why so many other people I spoke to yesterday: They've met him.
@MeetThePress 1/ It's hard to tell at this point. One major warning sign for O'Rourke during the primary was that he lost a number of counties along the Rio Grande to an underfunded Dem rival with a Hispanic surname.
@MeetThePress @matt_zdun 11/ And I'd watch the margins of Cruz/O'Rourke in Tarrant Co (where I am right now). O'Rourke has pointed to it as a bellwether. And I'd watch Harris Co (Houston.) Before all of this excitement, Dems began this cycle only wanting to keep this county blue during a midterm /end/
@MeetThePress 10/ I'd also watch a state House race in west Houston. The incumbent is a moderate Republican named Sarah Davis. I think the central q there is can her personal brand outperform a district that has Beto fever. My colleague @matt_zdun wrote on this: https://t.co/8NFobOJdf5
@MeetThePress 9/ Many of the TX candidates in seemingly safe Republican seats are really strong. They're fundraising, they're getting out in their communities and they're trying to de-stygmatize the Democratic label. This is an example of that kind of race in 2010: https://t.co/0ukGOmoA1Y
@MeetThePress 8/ Actually - a couple of other thoughts. I'm on constant alert for a "sleeper race." These are the kinds of races where few people saw the challenge coming but it seems obvious after the fact.
@MeetThePress 7/ It's likely that if Dems take the House, these two seats will be pivotal in that calculation. /end
@MeetThePress 6/ Hillary Clinton outperformed President Trump in those districts in 2016, which Democrats took to mean as they should go on offense in these places. And they've backed up their talk with millions and millions of dollars in TV advertising.
@MeetThePress 5/ U.S. Reps. Pete Sessions and John Culberson are the incumbents here and haven't had competitive general election campaigns in at least a decade each.
@MeetThePress 4/ And then there are are the #TX32 and #TX07. Nobody paid attention to these races before this cycle. They were safe seats in Dallas and Houston which took in parts of the wealthiest parts of both cities and extended to the suburbs.
@MeetThePress 3/ The current Rep there is Congressman Will Hurd. We are seeing signs in polling and in party behavior that he could be locking this down. (Again, I caveat that this is an unpredictable region...)
@MeetThePress 2/ For as long as I have covered House races, #TX23 was the only game in the state because of the Republican gerrymander. It is the absolute most difficult race in the country for me to predict and always has been.
@MeetThePress 1/ Well, I gotta say - my job is a lot more fun than two years ago because there is so much activity in the state. The three most obvious races to watch are the Congressional races in #TX07 #TX23, #TX32.
@MeetThePress 10/ But what is always important to remember in federal politics: Candidate fundraising is more powerful because they get a lower rate for ads - which is important in expensive media markets like DFW and Houston. //end
@MeetThePress 9/ Regarding R reaction to all this money: I think that the third quarter numbers, which came out in early October, did a great deal to motivate the Texas Republican donor class to get in the game.
@MeetThePress 8/ How much money has Texas shipped elsewhere in the country? I think there is an annoyance that given all the activity in the state this year at all levels of campaigns that Dems here are still obligated to carry the load elsewhere.
@MeetThePress 7/ Additionally, O'Rourke's $38 million is absolutely mind-blowing and there was some discussion over whether he has an obligation to send that money to other Dem senate candidates. I think that conversation can be enormously frustrating to state Dems.
@MeetThePress 6/ I think one of the big questions I'm looking to answer on Election Day is whether this money worked to build the party or was misdirected enthusiasm.
@MeetThePress 5/ But what we're seeing is Dem challengers in super safe R areas outraising the incumbents. And they're buying TV advertising and running professional campaigns.
@MeetThePress 4/  The R incumbents will raise a pile of money and think they've hit parity with their challengers, just to see their numbers get blown out of the water by the Dems candidates. I've always been taught that it's always, always a warning sign when an incumbent is outraised.
@MeetThePress 3/ Several of the Texas Dem candidates have made a habit of posting more than a million dollars a quarter (three broke the $2 million mark.)
@MeetThePress 2/ Only two or three years ago, it was a huge deal for a House candidate to raise $350k and a Senate candidate to raise $2 million. The numbers we are seeing now are absolutely insane in that context.
@MeetThePress 1/ So i've covered House races for 3 or 4ish cycles now. And one of m gripes is that I sometimes think the political class has lost its bearings on how big this candidate fundraising is.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 4/ But the suburbs and exurbs are still mostly conservative around Houston - and Trump was on the local news in those places. So, I think Trump probably cut both ways at the statewide level with his Houston appearance - excited the bases on both sides.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 3/ He went to Houston, which didn't make some Republicans happy at all, particularly because there are some competitive downballot races. But on the other hand, Houston proper may be moving Dem.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 2/ It's important to remember that while the Rust Belt rural areas went hard in favor of the GOP in 2016, the opposite happened in TX. Big cities really became Democratic bastions. So there was a fear among some Rs that if Trump went to a city, he could incite the Dem base there
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 1/ Well, I wrote a story about this earlier in the week. When the president announced he was traveling to Texas, a handful of my R sources were hoping this event would take place in rural areas. The absolutely did not want this event in a major Texas city. https://t.co/1XKqxD6PFa
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 6/ My other point: TX could turn blue-r even if O'Rourke loses. I think what will be interesting to look at is whether he has coattails downballot in some of the Congressional &amp; legislative races &amp; can help do something that hasn't been done in a generation: Build a Dem farm team
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 5/ On the other hand, my sources are reporting back to me strange things. We have no idea who is voting early and so it's really hard to make assumptions that this is a benefit for Dems. But some of my R sources are nervous about the turnout in certain places.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 4/ Some of my Texas Republican sources have been incredibly worried about this race. But I think public and private polling are showing that Republican voters in Texas are coming home and Cruz has the advantage.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 3/ That we are still talking about it is indicative that O'Rourke has a historically strong campaign. Past statewide Dem contenders had faded away at this point in cycles past.
@MeetThePress @chucktodd 2/ I think a really important thing to remember about Texas is just how staggeringly big it is. There are two things going on here that I think political junkies need to consider. The first is, the Senate race.
@MeetThePress 1/ Well, to start with, I started my career as @chucktodd's assistant. And in that job, I learned to be super picky about polling and which ones to quote. Regarding the margin, the polls I trust probably put this race in the high single digits in Cruz's favor.

@CahnEmily Hey now.
Fletcher takes an indirect shot at Culberson - says she is against "passing stock tips on the House floor." Which I glean to be a veiled reference to this: https://t.co/VtBCxWukcS #TX07
Fletcher said the first things a Dem Congress should address if they takeover are ethics and corruption.
Culberson mantra is he "is the right person at the right place and right time." (It's a reference to his Appropriations Committee assignment.) #TX07
Both candidates are invoking the #TX07's most famous voter - former President George H.W. Bush - on the issue of abortion/Planned Parenthood.
Culberson refers to himself as "a free market, Constitutional conservative." #TX07
Both candidates are accusing the other of untruthful allegations but are avoiding the word "lie" and "liar." #TX07
Culberson says he supports banning pre-existing conditions; supports putting Texans in a high-risk pool. Fletcher fires back that legislation he backed only "nominally" protected pre-existing conditions.
Culberson says he is trying to bring back earmarks. [We're in super inside ball on appropriations but this stuff is still super important for Houston, post-Harvey] #TX07
RT @kprin7: @evan7257 @TexasTribAbby Livestreaming on https://t.co/EFMPm2Aupn
For Houstonians: This debate is being broadcast on ABC 13 and Univision 45.
Culberson has twice stressed that he doesn't seek media attention for his appropriations efforts. #TX07
Culberson fires back that he did do work at the hospitals to build out their infrastructures to handle flooding post-Hurricane Allison #TX07
Fletcher counters that Culberson should have done more to mitigate flooding - back during Hurricane Allison in 2001.
First question is about flooding in Houston. Culberson stresses regional relationships with NJ and Florida delegations to appropriate funds back home. #TX07
All right...I'm on location at the University of Houston about to live tweet the one and only #TX07 debate between U.S. Rep. John Culberson (R), and attorney Lizzie Fletcher (D.) Start time is in about eight minutes.

Well, the feed went down. Now it's back up and the forum appears to be over. The end!
@LOLGOP Pete Sessions, Congressman of Dallas. I'm livetweeting a Congressional forum and not specifying first names for speed.
Allred says anyone saying Dems want to confiscate guns is lying. #TX32
Sessions is holding the line on traditionally conservative stances (with the exception of aligning with POTUS on trade): gun rights, taxes, health care, etc.
I kinda dig this moderator. On the national debt: "Your party and your party have put the screws to my grandkids" #TX32
Allred's main line of attack on Sessions is the GOP tax cuts from last year.
If you're curious about what I'm livetweeting, it's a Rotary Club forum between U.S. rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, and Dem challenger Colin Allred: https://t.co/DPWTaHTo9G #TX32
Allred, on trade: "We should be expanding trade. Not putting limits on it."
Sessions brings up Reagan again when discussing trade/NAFTA, then says: "I am to the point where I understand what the president is trying to do...we need to look at countries around the world and go to a no-tolerance to anyone who would have a tariff."
Allred contends the townhall Sessions described wasn't a security threat and said townhalls shouldn't be optional.
Sessions then touts various meeting he held with Democrats.
Session, on townhalls: "We had the first one in the country. It was a raucous time with screaming and yelling...it was a one-sided event." #TX32
Sessions: "I come back to Dallas every single weekend...In 22 years, I've spent four weekends in Washington DC" -- I might be off a word or two but that's the gist of the quote.
Allred hits Sessions on not having a townhall in a year. #TX32
Allred, on his Obama endorsement: "I was honored to serve in pres obama's admin and to have his endorsements." #TX32
Allred: I don't support a single-payer system.
Q What should gov be doing? A. Sessions calls for "public private partnership" projects.
Allred, in opening remarks, touts his public early education and scholarship as a football player at Baylor. Calls for a "fresh" approach to representing Dallas.
Sessions, in opening remarks: He shows his Spirit of Enterprise Award from the US Chamber and touts his relationship with the group. "I'm a Ronald Reagan Republican."
Okay, I'm about to livetweet a #TX32 forum at the Dallas Rotary Club, featuring U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions and Democratic challenger Colin Allred. You can watch it here: https://t.co/DPWTaHTo9G

All that is to say, I hope you have a friend or relative who accidentally sends "Strange Justice" to your house because it's one of the best political books I've ever read and is foundational to my understanding of how Congress works.
At that time, I used to randomly buy musical DVDs &amp; send them to my grandmother. Apparently, I accidentally sent the first book to her house. She was totally confused about why I sent her the book &amp; it was a completely awkward Christmas.
Ten years ago, one of my mentors insisted I read @JillAbramson &amp; @JaneMayerNYer's "Strange Justice" a book on the Clarence Thomas hearings. I bought a copy on Amazon, and it never arrived. So I bought another copy and forgot about the lost one.

Lots of times reporters talk about the hateful/absurd/stupid email they receive. I’d just like to say that this I received the smartest, wisest reader email ever from @gabbyhesse, a college student.
It’s causing some grumpiness inside the Dem caucus to learn this now.
The fundraisers were in 2013-2015, when Shuster and Carter had uncompetitive general elections (but they did raise big $ for NRCC at the time.) Vela saw it as a means to advocate for his gulf/border district with regards to transportation and homeland security needs.
Things you could read about if you subscribed to our newsletter, The Blast: @andreweversden1 and I reported that US Rep Filemon Vela attended at least two fundraisers in his district for powerful Republican members (Bill Shuster and John Carter) several years ago.

Q Will you support impeachment? // Hegar says she will support impeaching any president if there is high standard of evidence of misdeeds "I need to see what the investigation finds out"
MJ Hegar says Citizens United decision is a component to solving gun issue.
MJ Hegar on guns. Evan: Do you want to take our guns away? MJ Hegar: You'll have to take mine away first.
Okay we've moved onto health care. Hegar says she would support "a Medicare option" but stops short of Medicare for all.
More MJ Hegar on Cuellar: "I think Congressman Cuellar does a good job of working across the aisle...I think that raising money for somebody who doesn't represent your values is different."
More MJ Hegar on Cuellar: I have long since said working...together and accomplishing things in a bipartisan way doesn't mean compromising your values."
MJ Hegar more on Henry Cuellar: "It's an example of what's wrong with politics. A little boys club, maybe."
MJ Hegar said she reached out to Cuellar previously and never heard back.
MJ Hegar on Cuellar encouraging people to support John Carter: I have nothing against Congressman Cuellar. // Do you know him? /// I don't.
Q Will you outraise Carter in third quarter? // MJ Hegar: Yes.
Q Wanna give us a preview of your third quarter fundraising? MJ Hegar: No.
She stresses industry over geography when it comes to donations. And...now she brings up Henry Cuellar...
Hegar adds that she is refusing corporate PAC money.
Hegar on out-of-state donations: "I talk to people everyday from inside the district and outside of the district and I hear things like, my daughter goes to school there" and recites other ties to the district. https://t.co/KaNpDTwcUk
Hegar is now describing her meeting with US Rep. Carter's office and her difficulty getting a meeting with him directly. (My internet cut out so I've missed part of it) https://t.co/KaNpDTwcUk
MJ Hegar on lack of women in public office in Texas: "I think we need more veterans in office. I think we need more women in office. Frankly, we need more Texas women in office...I look at Ann Richards and I think we need more of that"
Hegar on the foreign policy woldview of veterans running for office: "Every boot on the ground is a failure of diplomacy"
Hegar hits Carter on the immigration family separation policy: "To institute a policy of fear as a deterrent...goes against everything that I put the uniform on for"
Hegar indicates that she does not intend to make this race about Trump. "I don't know that Trump is as big of an issue in my district"
If you're just catching my tweet thread, I'm livetweeting Evan Smith's interview with #TX31 Congressional candidate MJ Hegar https://t.co/KaNpDTwcUk
Q: You've voted for John Carter? MJ Hegar: "I have voted for him." Goes on to say it's important to build an infrastructure for a choice
When asked if this is a race about Trump, Hegar says: "This race is about the people in the district"
Evan: The root to victory is what? // Hegar suggests countering voter apathy with presence in the district
*I think I misunderstood the question* -- Carter had a contested primary
Evan points out John Carter got 23k more votes to turnout in his uncontested primary this year than the four Democrats in MJ Hegar's primary https://t.co/KaNpDTwcUk
Hegar responds by saying it's a Republican district with low turnout...And says she's put the staff and infrastructure in place. "John Carter outspent his opponent last cycle 50 to 1."
Evan starts off underscoring just how Republican the #TX31 district is - "Why are we even talking about this?"

The issue that Carter is now rounding up donations from colleagues rather than giving them out could shape up to be a larger problem nationally for Republicans in the fall if there are enough similar races around the country.
In the here &amp; now, I watched Carter campaign in front of a friendly crowd. His message is a need for another border wall: An imaginary one between Travis Co (super liberal) &amp; his home of Williamson Co. He added that Rs need to hold this district to prevent Ds from taking over
The first question of this race is if Hegar can put him on defense to the point that GOP groups have to buy TV advertising in his district - that pulls money from other races. So, Hegar could indirectly win a seat or two far away that isn't her own seat. https://t.co/1Uof8rcvG6
Carter is an appropriator, which means he usually gives six-figure donations to the NRCC. That's not happening this year. He's now likely banking his money to protect his own seat. https://t.co/1Uof8rcvG6
Here's the more immediate question: MJ Hegar raised a pile of money (as everyone knows) from a viral video. That can now be used for television advertising. Carter has lagged far behind her. https://t.co/1Uof8rcvG6
Other Texas Republicans think Judge Carter will be fine. This is an incredibly Republican district. https://t.co/1Uof8rcvG6
I looked at it mostly from the GOP worldview, &amp; there's a real polarization in the analysis from TX Republicans. Some worry Hegar poses an existential threat to Rep. Carter's hold on the seat.  https://t.co/1Uof8rcvG6

@DavidMDrucker Same.
@MichaelGross25 Let me get this straight: I shouldn't report on television advertising? Got it.
At the same time, @PatrickSvitek and I heard rumblings among Cruz supporters who wanted signs to counter these images. So, we asked around and wrote a story about it. There's a lot going on here: https://t.co/3AlwFvyf8I
They were in Arlington Heights, Ridgmar, around Bernie Park, Colonial, Crestline around All Saints Church, Tanglewood, Monticello, often two on a street. The biggest flood was around TCU, which even though it's a college campus, it's a family neighborhood. This isn't normal in FW
Then I drove around Fort Worth on errands. I really was surprised at the volume of Beto signs. So I spent Saturday afternoon driving through all of my old haunts. Save for Rivercrest, Westover &amp; Burton Hill, practically every neighborhood on the west side was flooded w Beto signs
Basically, yard signs was the first thing my father wanted to discuss when he picked me up at the airport. I've seen a lot of signs in a lot of states over the years and kinda shrugged dear old Dad off.
Also, I got to take a photo from my childhood street (the second photo, of the Cruz sign.) https://t.co/3AlwFvyf8I

@KateNocera Thanks, Kate!
But amid talk of bench-building and moral victories, there is this quote from Democratic former consultant @JasStanford on what this Senate race means for his party: "The only winning is winning.” https://t.co/Zi7qWbcbI5
Some Republicans are genuinely concerned about Democrats having an opportunity to build its bench amid this perfect storm of a favorable climate and a charismatic statewide candidate.
Democrats in the state are incredibly anxious about out-of-control expections.
The most interesting thing I’ve learned about the Texas Senate race: pollsters are seeing trouble for Ted Cruz when they internally poll other races in urban centers. Which could mean trouble for Congressional and state legislature Republicans https://t.co/Zi7qWbcbI5
There is a sense that if O’Rourke can get this thing within 5-6 points, he will lift boats downballot. But if this ends in a double-digit margin - this race could be deeply demoralizing to the future of state Democrats. https://t.co/Zi7qWbcbI5
(Link) https://t.co/Zi7qWbcbI5
It’s hard to find operatives of any stripe who will say out loud on the record or off that they think Beto O’Rourke can defeat Ted Cruz in the Senate race - at this point. But there are starting to be GOP tremors about the down-ballot effects of this race.

I met Litton in September. He was impressive. He had a real campaign and a real staff and was raising real money a year ago.
Crenshaw is a veteran who lost his eye in Afghanistan. He is young and Harvard-educated, and ran an incredible primary campaign - snatched a runoff slot from a daunting self-funder. There are many state and national Republicans who have high hopes for him.
Democrat is Todd Litton. Some of this district gets tangled up in #TX07, which is one of the most competitive seats in the state. I’ve spent time down there, and it has felt like some of the excitement there has spilled over (lots of Litton yard signs) into #TX02
This is incredible: @Redistrict is moving #TX02 from solid to likely R. Context of that race: Ted Poe is retiring. It snakes around Houston and its suburbs. The R is one of the brightest rising stars in Texas (Dan Crenshaw) but the D is impressive and running a quality campaign. https://t.co/WqdvxWSHtn

And before national Democrats swoop in to take credit for this, let’s be clear: There are some high profile Congressional races with heavy DCCC involvement. But beyond those districts, this is purely organic.

Gov Greg Abbott is a dominating fundraising force and the well of GOP money in the state is bottomless. But this Congressional fundraising shows that at that level Dems are exhibiting a new phenomenon: growth. https://t.co/a0ngD8msGj
But this is activity not seen in decades. The hope among some Texas Dem insiders is that these individual House candidates are doing organically what national groups haven’t been able to do: Build the party from the bottom up https://t.co/a0ngD8msGj

Tom Ridge: “If you cannot engage in civil discourse...it’s very unlikely you will be successful in your effort to govern.”
Former DHS Sec Tom Ridge praises Hurd’s criticism yesterday: “He’s a good Republican” but adds that his comments were thoughtful
O’Rourke on Helsinki: Praises Hurd for his critical comments about Trump’s performance.
O’Rourke further says the road trip with Hurd is one of the things he will cherish most of his six years in the House
O’Rourke says that the idea of wanting to be in the minority in order to accomplish a party’s agenda should never cloud out serving the public (I’m paraphrasing here)

We are seeing six-figure Dem hauls in uncompetitive Texas districts. R incumbents may choose to spend protectively back home rather than ship money out. Dems could end up not winning many seats in TX but the state could end up as a GOP money pit.
Another brewing problem for House Republicans (which I will be writing about on Monday): Texas GOP House members - particularly chairmen and senior members with choice committee assignments - send a lot of money to out-of-state colleagues &amp; the NRCC.
Sessions is also a former NRCC chairman. Again, $700k would have blown my mind as a strong number in any other context. These Dem numbers are such a historical aberration.
For historical context, a $700k quarter has never been considered weak. It’s just D numbers coming in are so big. It’s also important in this context to note that a chairman (House Rules) got outraised.  Even so, Sessions has been banking moneyand had $1.9 million in cash on hand
It looks like we have our first confirmed Texas US House challenger-outraises-incumbent of Q2: Pete Sessions (R) raised $695k in the last three months. Colin Allred (D) camp said last week he raised almost $1.1 million. I expect to see more numbers like this in coming days. #TX32

Lizzie Fletcher, in #TX07 raised more than a million. In past cycles, $300-400k was the norm, $500k was jaw dropping. We seem to be in a new frontier of individual candidate fundraising.

And if your news organization went all out to cover the baseball game and you are ignoring our game, you need to think long and hard about your editorial choices and what that says about your image to your female colleagues in the press corps and to female members of Congress.

Idea for news organizations covering @CWSoftballGame: The reporter who covers the game should have a basic understanding of baseball/softball. Last year, I apparently tore my ACL (I didn’t), and in 2012 I pitched a “terrible” game (I had, bizarrely, both the win and the save.)

These numbers wouldn't be so startling with a smaller state, but our delegation is just so big. 38 members currently serve from Congress and we've elected seven women in all of Texas history to Congress.
Two GOP women with well-funded campaigns, Bunni Pounds and Kathaleen Wall, ran this term but didn't make it through their primaries. Dem side was basically as terrible at electing women until this year. Texas is on track to elect 2-4 freshman Dem women to Congress next term.
My realization of the paucity of women in the Texas delegation came one day several years ago when I realized that Kay Granger is the only woman who sits among 25 men at the weekly Texas GOP delegation lunch. That dynamic is all but certain to continue next term.
This article is a reminder that Kay Granger will remain next term the only Texas Republican woman elected to the U.S. House (although KBH served in the Senate and was the dominant force in the delegation for nearly two decades.) https://t.co/X7Bk3QRKNU

.@TexasTribune calls #TX07 for Lizzie Pannill Fletcher over Laura Moser. Roughest Democratic primary in the state is now over. She will take on John Culberson in the fall #TX7
DCCC is going there - Chairman Ben Ray Lujan signals their seriousness about this district with a statement tonight: https://t.co/VXcmsrbyr4
@katieleslienews @mWilstory @TexasTribune No no no no no no. I have three phobias: snakes, Charles Manson and spelling bees.
.@TexasTribune calls #TX31 Dem primary for veteran MJ Hegar. This is John Carter's district. Safe GOP territory but could be wave-y.
Now Ron Wright's lead is three points over Jake Ellzey in the #TX06 GOP primary
And then the margin gets wider - Ron Wright's margin over Jake Ellzey is back up to a little over five points. #TX06
#TX06 GOP primary gets tighter: Ron Wright has a two-point lead over Jake Ellzey now. #TX6
Even more breathing room for Chip Roy: He now has a six-point lead over Matt McCall. #TX21
.@TexasTribune now calls #TX03 Dem primary for Lorie Burch. This is a safe GOP seat but means another Dem candidate named Sam Johnson (who shares a name with the retiring incumbent) will not be on the fall ballot
We have another call: @TexasTribune calls #TX23 Dem primary for Gina Ortiz Jones. She will face US Rep. Will Hurd in the fall. This is the biggest Congressional race in the state.
We have our first Texas Tribune call on a federal race of the night via @rossramsey: We call #TX02 #TX2 for Dan Crenshaw over Kevin Roberts.
On the Dem side of #TX06, Jana Lynne Sanchez now has an eight point lead over Ruby Faye Woolridge. Context: This is a longshot Dem opportunity but could maybe be wave-y
Meanwhile, things have tightened in GOP #TX06 primary: Ron Wright has a four-point lead over Jake Ellzey now.
Chip Roy has some breathing room. He now has a five point lead over Matt McCall in the GOP primary to replace Lamar Smith.

Second dispatch of the night: How things are shaping up on the Republican side of Congressional races https://t.co/t9lgNKvcpH
In #TX27 (race to replace Farenthold), Michael Cloud has a big early, 18-point lead over Bech Bruun
In #TX05, Lance Gooden has taken the lead 56-44 over Bunni Pounds to replace Jeb Hensarling.
Seeing some fresh #TX02 numbers: Dan Crenshaw has a big jump on early vote over Kevin Roberts. 67-33 percent lead. #TX2
First dispatch of the night: Early vote looks grim for Laura Moser and the DCCC detractors https://t.co/P1qD82lssj
#TX31 Dem primary: MJ Hegar has a dominant early lead of 62-38 over Christine Mann. This is John Carter's seat. Longshot but wave-y for Dems.
#TX21 GOP side is getting really close. Chip Roy has a 51-49 lead over Matt McCall.
On the Dem side of things in #TX06 #TX6, it's the same margin - Jana Lynn Sanchez with a 53-47 point early lead over Ruby Faye Woolridge. This is to replace Joe Barton. It's a super longshot but possibly wave-y Dem opportunity. And yes, I just created that adjective, wave-y.
#TX6 #TX06 GOP primary update: Ron Wright has taken the lead over Jake Ellzey. It's 53-47
Collin Allred has a monster early vote lead in #TX32 with 71% to Lillian Salerno's 29 percent in Dem primary to take on Pete Sessions in the fall.
The race everyone wants to know about, #TX07 #TX7: Lizzie Pannill Fletcher has a monster early vote lead with 70% to Laura Moser's 31 percent. We'll see how this goes into the night..
#TX21 GOP primary is closer than I was expecting in early vote but let's see how this goes through the night - Chip Roy has 53% to Matt McCall's 47 percent.
Now here are the most interesting numbers I've seen so far: #TX6 #TX06 - race to replace Joe Barton. With 5000 votes in, Jake Ellzey, the underdog, has a 63-36 percent lead over Ron Wright. Again, it's still early.
In the #TX05 GOP primary to replace Jeb Hensarling, Bunni Pounds has a modest lead of 57 percent to Lance Gooden's 43 percent. I say modest bc this margin is smaller than what I'm seeing in other races and it's still early - but seems like strong start
In #TX23, Gina Ortiz Jones has a monster early vote lead with 85 percent of the vote. This is the biggest Congressional race in the state - to take on U.S. Rep. Will Hurd in the fall.
In the Dem primary of #TX21, Joseph Kopser jumps to a big lead in early votes over Mary Street Wilson. Context: This is a longshot Dem bid to take Lamar Smith's seat. Would have to be a monster wave but national Dems are keeping an eye on it.
Okay, early vote totals in Texas are beginning to come in...

There are currently three women: U.S. Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Sheila Jackson Lee and Kay Granger. State Sen. Sylvia Garcia and Judge Veronica Escobar essentially secured their seats on March 6. Bounds would be #3. And more women (in far tougher fights) on the ballot in Nov.
Depending on Bunni Pounds' fortunes tonight in the #TX5 GOP primary, Texas could be on track to double the number of women in its Congressional delegation.

I also asked Moser about what I perceived as veiled shots Fletcher takes at her for only recently moving back to Houston: "It’s not veiled...The kind of 'Gone with the Wind' Tara thing doesn’t feel relevant, but it’s not subtle." https://t.co/a0maeF8YjT
I asked Laura Moser about how her fundraising lagged behind Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in the runoff - she says the DCCC cut off big Houston donors. #TX7
This race really boils down the arguments in both parties: Better to paint in bold colors or appeal to crossover to voters on the other side? #TX7
First takeaway: EVERYONE in the bayou is beyond tired of talking about the DCCC intervention in February against candidate Laura Moser.

Fletcher says there are few policy differences with Moser but stresses she’s spent much of her career in Houston (veiled jab at Moser for moving back to Htown last year.) Says she disagrees with notion that Moser is the only person who can bring new people into the fold.
Moser says it’s a good thing that both runoff candidates are strong women. She goes on to suggest the reason to vote for her is to bc her “history with grassroots and activism” will bring new people into the fold.
The lack of disagreement between Moser and Fletcher is so striking that moderator notes this and asks them to specify how they’re different.
Fletcher repeatedly compares incumbent John Culberson to Paul Ryan and Donald Trump.
First two questions are from high school students and are environments-related. Not much disagreement here. The national ire surrounding this race isn’t detectable in this community center at this point.

A lotta talking points followed up and now that's a wrap! Well done, @brandonformby!
Q What committees would you want to serve on? // Salerno: Judiciary. (Says she's wanted to be on it her whole career)
Q: What committees would you want to serve on? // Allred says House Oversight Committee.
If you are just now tuning in, I'm live tweeting a #TX32 debate between Colin Allred and Lillian Salerno in that district's Dem runoff. Livestream here --&gt; https://t.co/rqLklmmBgP (Allred doesn't have a livestream on his FB page, so I'm not showing candidate preference!)
Allred, too, says he supports DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.
Allred, on immigration: Suggests Pete Sessions is one of the key obstructionists [my paraphrase of his words] on immigration issues.
Salerno supports DREAM Act, comprehensive immigration reform. #TX32
.@gromerjeffers got the money quote down that I wasn't fast enough to type on Salerno's Pelosi q --&gt; https://t.co/hE3AOkig5q
Allred adds he's "proudly pro-choice" and says he supports contraception.  #TX32
Salerno, on feminism: "I believe in choice. For me, it's a civil rights issue...I'm an EMILY's List candidate..." Salerno reminds crowd no woman has been elected to a full term in 22 years.
Question: Are you a feminist and what does that mean to you? /// Allred: Absolutely...we should all be feminists and if you're not we should ask some serious questions about why that is?
Salerno, on impeachment: "If there was sufficient evidence, of course we would go for impeachment." Pete Session is "basically the traffic cop of the US Congress" (she's referencing his role as Rules Cmte Chairman
Allred on impeachment: "Cart before the horse." But says that the Mueller report should go to a Congress that will do the right thing for the country. Calls for new ethics reforms. Things that used to be norms should be laws. [I'm paraphrasing here to keep up]
Impeachment question...
Moderator @brandonformby is throwing the heat and completely worth watching. (And nobody loves Dallas more...) #TX32
If you're just tuning in, I'm live-tweeting a Congressional Democratic primary debate in a competitive-ish Dallas seat, #TX32. If you want to catch the livestream --&gt; https://t.co/rqLklmmBgP
Allred counters the Salerno argument of needing GOP crossover votes by getting more people to vote, or in his words, "grow the pie"
Salerno: The entire country is watching and wondering if they're going to mess it up again in Texas?
Salerno: We cannot win this race with just Democrats...The only way we can win the 32nd District...is if you get crossover vote.
Allred, defending DCCC support: DCCC support came after he got 40 percent of the vote in the first round of the primary and "that is following the will of the people"
Allred says nobody asks about Pelosi when he's on the trail. Says he gets questions from the press and we only ask the q for clicks. (For the record: I've asked him this, and it will all but certainly matter in the fall campaign.) He defers the question to after the election.
More Salerno: We have got to win this seat, we've got to speak to Republicans....what they'll do is put her picture on campaign leadership..." says for the sake of country, Dems need new leadership.  #TX32
Salerno: "I worked on the Affordable Care Act for President Obama...but for Nancy Pelosi, we wouldn't have passed that...Now that was 2009..." she says it's time for new leadership
Question: Would you support Pelosi, why or why not?
Salerno and Allred are very similar in tone on gun issue - both call for more gun laws.
Allred calls Rep Pete Sessions (the R incumbent) an "extremist" on the gun issue. #TX32
Allred says he's neither. He echoes calls for new leadership in Democratic Party #TX32
Salerno alludes to DCCC elevating Allred in her answer in their Red to Blue program #TX32
Salerno praises both: I don't think it's an either or. We need new leadership in the Democratic Party. #TX32
First question: Are you more of a Hillary or Bernie, and why?
@ChrisFistonich Not my feed.
A guy at the podium says 275 in attendance. Livestream available on Salerno's Facebook page (I checked Allred's and didn't see a feed, in the interest of even-handedness...) https://t.co/rqLklmmBgP

Congressman Jodey Arrington of Lubbock is also here.
Conaway repeatedly stresses that he doesn’t care which party the votes for Farm Bill come from. Just wants it to pass (this has long been a bipartisan alliance between rural Republicans and Democrats who support SNAP)

O'Rourke: The strategy leading up to the March 6 primary was part of the longer strategy [thru the general] #TTEvents #tx2018
O'Rourke: "Many in Texas...did not at that point know who I am." He further suggests that his vote total wasn't higher bc he didn't spend so much time in Dem strongholds.
Evan, noting O'Rourke's lackluster primary performance. "What happened?" #TTEvents #tx2018

7. I've made a few calls to some GOP folks in the state, many of whom aren't fans of Cruz. The resounding sentiment is they are not remotely alarmed. "Think Jon Ossof," said one R.
RT @haley_samsel: .@BetoORourke announces stunning fundraising numbers, set to speak with @TexasTribune in Waco this afternoon https://t.co…
6. All that said, Cruz will have a gazillion dollars in super PAC money, and he’s one of the best politicians I’ve ever seen in executing a campaign. But as Dennis Quaid in the Big Easy would say, We might have a cute little ad war on our hands.
Slight correction to tweet #4: There aren’t fundraising limits (not spending limits). No coffee yet today.
5. I don’t know how he spends this money, or what it means about advertising or name identification in the fall. But my editor Lauren Whittington always reminded me that beyond all that the takeaway for big fundraising is enthusiasm.
4. There aren’t spending limits in Texas state politics and not too many competitive federal races, so sometimes I wonder if in-state political observers forget how hard it is to raise federal dollars.
3. I used to cover Senate races all over the country for Roll Call. I remember how impressed we were when a candidate crossed the $1 million mark each quarter. That was a few cycles ago, but even so, this is astounding for any Senate race, anywhere.
Meaning, going to this fundraiser was a financial priority/sacrifice for these folks. It didn’t register with me how significant that was until today.
2. I know some people who went to an O’Rourke fundraiser in March that was $125/head. These sources were perplexed by how some of their friends they saw there could afford to go.
A few thoughts on O’Rourke’s fundraising: 1. This is different from Wendy Davis’ haul, and she was a prolific fundraiser. She didn’t have limits. He does, so this all came in $2,700 (or $5,400) increments or smaller.
I’ve been dubious that O’Rourke can launch the TV ad campaign he needs to build name ID in such an expensive state. Key thing to remember on top of this astounding figure: candidates get lower TV rates than super PACs https://t.co/WXDykZWeJv

Softball status unknown candidates are Bunni Pounds (whom I haven't met) and Laura Moser (I forgot to ask her because there was lot of other stuff going on.) And Kathaleen Wall (who has not secured a runoff spot yet and declined to do an interview with me.)
The Q you're all wondering, what does this mean for softball? I've asked nearly all of the women who are in the runoffs if they want to play. Most said no. Exception is Lillian Salerno who may or may not make the #TX32 runoff. Sen Gillibrand recruited her in front of me in Dallas
Still waiting on #TX32 but EMILY's List is on track for a sweep of the state when it comes to having candidates win their primaries or make runoffs.
This is how I feel right now: https://t.co/cXd7DfQvOr
#TX21 Dem side: We call a Democratic runoff for Mary Street Wilson and Joseph Kopser.
Here's one thing that's clear on several fronts: Money didn't matter in a lot of races here. Whether it was self-funders or great fundraisers - a solid handful of folks were surpassed by staggeringly underfunded opponents
Kathaleen Wall and Dan Crenshaw are in a brawl for 2nd place and the runoff in #TX02. As of the latest FEC reports, he spent $92k. She spent $4.3 million. There may be some more up-to-date reporting. I'm just tired.
@elisewho For reals. It's a hopping race.
Texas Tribune calls #TX27 a Republican runoff with Bech Bruun and Michael Cloud. This is a race to replace U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold, who is retiring.
Texas Tribune calls #TX05 GOP primary a runoff with Lance Gooden and Bunni Pounds. This is the seat to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling.
Texas Tribune calls #TX07 Democratic primary for attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and Laura Moser.
Just got off the phone with state Sen. Sylvia Garcia, on how she feels about the likelihood she will be among the first Latinas elected to Congress from Texas: "Well, I don't really ever think about those things. I never really wanted to be the first. I wanted to be the best."
RT @nathanlgonzales: Candidate who spent $33,000 vs. GOP Rep. John Carter in #TX31 currently receiving 34% of the vote.
RT @amanbatheja: After spending at least $6 million of her own money, Kathaleen Wall is in danger of not making the runoff. https://t.co/qS…
#TX06 (race to replace Joe Barton) - Texas Tribune calls two candidates go runoff: Tarrant Co Ron Wright and former Cruz COS Chip Roy.
Here is a photo of Sylvia Garcia having a moment with a young Hispanic girl on Tuesday. She's now on track to be the first Latina member of Congress from Texas (a possibly shared title...) https://t.co/FUvdWdRDhd
#TX07 observation from one of my favorite Houstonians (a Democrat): DCCC stuff elevated Moser, hurt  Westin and Alex T. So why not Lizzie so far? "Her base was solid." [And to be clear: The Tribune has yet to call this race.]
The other thing is, state Rep. Roberts - who is in the lead - has a consultant team that knows how to win federal races in Texas.
This conversation, of course, happened after I turned in my story on the race #BahHumbug
Kathaleen Wall spent a fortune on TV ads, but the messaging turned off these folks. Additionally, the male relative said he really liked Dan Crenshaw because he is a former SEAL.
A thought on some wild numbers we're seeing in #TX02...I visited with some conservative relatives (and don't read anything into this on my own ideology as I've got liberals in my family too...)
Texas Tribune calls the #TX29 race for state Sen. Sylvia Garcia. For the first time ever, Texas will send a Latina to Congress (and probably another to call to come soon.)
Even so, outside of Emily's List, Washington Democrats aren't happy right now.
It's still early and it's a tight race for 2nd place, but still...
@Redistrict Still early and a tight race for second. But still...
Yeeeshk. Castros/Congressional Hispanic Caucus/Blue Dogs-endorsed Jay Hulings is in fourth place.
Additionally, I asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee at the DNC two years ago she worried that the Texas delegation could be all male, and she didn't rule it out as an unpleasant possibility.

US Sen. Claire Mccaskill gave a personal donation to Dem candidate Tahoe Javed, per newest 48 hour reports. This is a highly contentious Dem primary with an EMILY's List candidate in the mix
Lastly, who the heck knows who makes this runoff. There are no patterns to look for from cycles' past because this is the first real Democratic race here in forever. Monster turnout further confuses things. And it's unclear if any backlash has swayed voters.
One extremely local factor in this race is this: Some Democrats and moderates tended to vote in the R primary to protect a moderate state rep from the right. Many of these folks are torn by that habit and an exciting Democratic Congressional primary https://t.co/6dxowYcub5

Context: This is a seat drawn for a Hispanic member but U.S. Rep. Gene Green has held it for decades. Many ambitious local Dems stepped aside for Sylvia Garcia to have a clear shot. The Schumer-endorsed candidate is making a play and is not from district https://t.co/DhmmVpLQeU

Last question: All five candidates promise to share donor and research material and to support the eventual nominee. #TX32 ...signing off...
Allred supports Medicare for All.
Meier says he would support "a Medicare option for everybody."
Shipp says he supports single payer health care.
Shipp said he was on the fence about quitting WFAA until the fall shootings in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs.
Allred: I would have stood on my desk until we took care of the dreamers.
Shipp says he would have voted for the spending bill - says there was no end game and he would push for DACA separately
Brett Shipp touts his TV journalism career, saying he stood up to John Wylie Price and Jerry Jones.
These #TX32 Dem candidates continue to suggest gun control as a winning issue. Ya didn't often see that in cycles' past.
Allred notes that Wendy Davis campaign (of which he worked on) struggled to appeal to Republican women over abortion issue. But says both strategies are necessary.
Next question is whether it's better to appeal to the base or to non-Dems.
Shipp call she Sessions "an acolyte of Donald Trump."
Salerno suggests she's can pull in independent and Republican women. Allred stresses door knocking.
On the question of electability, Ed Meier stresses his fundraising prowess and insists it's key to taking on Sessions.
George Rodriguez: "Thanks to Lillian, we all hug."
Ed Meier, like others so far, stresses the collegial tone in the field. Lillian Salerno: "We've all made a pact that we are gonna beat Pete Sessions."
First round of questions is say nice things about Dem rivals. Brett Shipp refers to Colin Allred - star football player at Hillcrest High - "a hometown hero."
Just arrived at a #TX32 Dem primary forum. The motto here is "Unseat Pete" (Sessions)

An added dynamic to this race: This seat has been coveted for years by local hispanic politicians. Javed, until recently, called Beaumont (85 miles away) home.
But her Dem rival, Tahir Javed, is outpacing her on individual contributions and dumped $400k in the last quarter campaign finance report. What does this mean? I dunno. Self-funders have a mixed record in Congressional races in Texas and elsewhere.
Garcia has most of the major Democratic constituencies behind her: unions, state legislators, council members, EMILY's List, members of the federal delegation and the retiring incumbent, Gene Green.
The question right now is: Can Sen. Garcia put this race away and avoid a runoff?
State Sen. Sylvia Garcia is a fixture in Houston and Texas politics. She ran for Congress 26 years ago and is giving it another shot now that US Rep. Gene Green is retiring. She cleared the field, but out of nowhere came a self-funder with formidable money.
This race is quickly shaping up to be one of my favorites of the zillions of US House races in Texas: https://t.co/DhmmVpLQeU
