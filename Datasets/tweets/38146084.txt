And current ENA requires Kephart to provide "terms and conditions" for getting team approval. How can he do that w/o talking to teams?
Kephart said today not his job to get @Raiders on board, but that's wrong. Original ENA required him to get "binding agreement" from team
@nfalls75 @Oakland @RAIDERS @insidebayarea It was in Kephart's initial financing proposal submitted to the city back in June.

@LewsPlanB But, I didn't think their web headline really captured the story, so I changed it again.

@greenkozi Wonder how much money Council could save if it eliminated the flower pens. #oakmtg
CM Schaaf is no longer holding her flower pen. The immense power of social media again on display. #oakmtg
CMs Schaaf and Kernighan back Kaplan/Nadel plan. #oakmtg
@davidcolburn Kernighan and Schaaf also recently got haircuts. At this rate, Kaplan could end up with the longest hair of the bunch. #oakmtg
CM Libby Schaaf is going over concerns with 30-point plan while holding pencil with a giant flower where eraser should be. #oakmtg
CMs Kaplan and Nadel also have budget plan and it involves lots of acronyms!!! Propose $900k for 3rd academy and $100k for crime lab #oakmtg
@greenkozi I think they were talking about the budget. It was a very touchy feely 30-point proposal.
Mayor Quan just put her arm around CM De La Fuente. Can't blame her. He's sporting an impressive new mustache. No more goatee. #oakmtg
CM Brooks et al plan budgets $1 million for third police academy in June and eliminates one furlough day costing city $1 mill. #oakmtg

CM Brooks made a big deal about this item two weeks ago b/c kids got paid after work done -- just workers who built her teen center #oakmtg
So disappointed I'll never get to sit at Sanjiv Handa Memorial Press Table or speak into Sanjiv Handa Memorial Mircophone. #oakmtg
League ladies "very disappointed" about Sanjiv Handa Sunshine Ordinance. On the bright side, they get to go home now. #oakmtg

We need a resolution to hold future Council talks about Occupy at Oaksterdam U. or Harborside. Folks here need to mellow out. #oakmtg
Resoluiton dies. Only  4 ayes. #oakmtg
Looking like Brunner might be the swing vote. #oakmtg
Now they're talking off in the corner. #oakmtg
CM Kaplan sounds like she'll be voting against the rez. She's giving the business to the port's spokesman. #oakmtg
Occupy folks start screaming down De La Fuente, Council decides they need a timeout. #oakmtg
Wonder if these silent protests during council meetings are really a closed-captioner conspiracy. #oakmtg	Someone here is a great singer.
Maybe city should scrap port rez, and pass rez prohibiting speakers with 8 mins from doing roll call RE: who's paying attention #oakmtg
And that CMs Reid and Brooks will stick around till the end. #oakmtg
Gut sense is only difference btw this mtg and last one with port protest is that resolution will fail at 9 p.m., not 12 a.m. #oakmtg

Larry Reid is up.  He's walking
they're on the balcony. "No more  budget cuts."  -- maybe trying to get on the good side of city workers #oakmtg
Occupy folks are coming. Chanting let's go Oakland. They were so quiet before. #oakmtg
Of those to get cut, she says half worked in redevelopment, 20 are administrators and 20 are from elsewhere in the city #oakmtg
Quan said cuts result in only about 81 people getting laid off b/c other positions getting eliminated are vacant. #oakmtg
Senior moment at council meeting. Old folks pleading to preserve services that aren't slated for cuts. #oakmtg
SEIU is a lot louder in Oakland than in Fremont. Meanwhile Occupy supporters are quietly outside having their GA. #oakmtg
Followed by higher-pitched "Save our Schools." and deeper "No more Furloughs." I'm quiety chanting "Let's go Giants." #oakmtg
Didn't realize the accoustics at Oakland Council chambers were so good. Deep, bellowing "No more cuts!" chant #oakmtg
HAR-BUST!
Spat btw CM Brooks and CM Kerighan over minor procedural issue that may or may not have been ridiculous. #oakmtg
I'd like to ask Jessica about her spat with OO hardliners over live-streaming, but I'm afraid she talks faster than I can write. #oakmtg
CM Brooks wants 100 Blocks to come to council: "I don’t know what the 100 blocs are. I don’t know what the plan is." #oakmtg
CM Brooks not happy Measure Y proposals includes money for portions of Quan's 100 block program. #oakmtg
Still a chance that city could name sunshine ordinance after Handa, per D. Brooks. Seems like there would be five votes for that. #oakmtg
Occupy Medic accuses City Admin of playing Dirty Birds during Hollie's 6-mins. Good thing she couldn't see me thinking about NFL. #oakmtg
Occupy folks pay tribute to Handa by speaking for six minutes a pop. #oakmtg
Something tells me Nadel never gave Sanjiv Handa free chocolate:  "It’s painful to hear somebody praised who was so brutal and mean to me."
Jessica Hollie spent the last couple days sparing with Occupy hardliners. Now she's just finished 6 mins giving 2 cents to council #oakmtg
Larry Reid's poetic justice, smacks of hypocracy to 5 Oak city councilmembers. There won't be a Sanjiv Handa memorial press room. #oakmtg
