@ChrisOhio89 @CillizzaCNN He still wants to go down on Hillary.  Been his life long dream.
@CillizzaCNN Or the real translation.  Chris is a lying POS. So fake news is correct.
@CillizzaCNN TDS on steroids !
@eScarry Trump should hold tough. Wall funding or don't sign a budget deal. Don't give in.
@eScarry BS build the wall.  We shouldn't need to have forces there protecting us. The wall would fix it.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Build the wall  !!
@EWErickson @FrankelJeremy You don't have a clue what's best for him. TDS has gotten the best it you.
@bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/lFxUqaLORf
@NBCNews Ha this is pathetic journalism.  Go back to all your stories while he had the position. You non stop wrote about how bad he was. This is TDS
@JonathanTurley Wow you're as bad as CNN.  Missing the junior high girls club gossip or what ? How pathetic
@dwints85 @RepJimCosta @DHSgov @CBP Can you please share a copy of the letter sent to Obama from the Dems? You know there was what 70 times. Or did it not bother you then ?
@bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I'll get back with you and we can discuss some facts  about it.  I don't have time today. Thanks
@bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Yes I'd agree with you there. Different opinions never make someone a bad person.  It makes us free thinkers. Thankful we have that right.
@Ocasio2018 Oh threatening to abuse power. No wonder you're a Demorat.
@SenSchumer Just be honest for once. Tell you people the truth. You can't  do anything about it. Your only tool is smear campaign.  Nothing honest.
@bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I apologize about the name calling. But you are small minded if you think Climate control is our biggest worry.  It's a hoax.
@SenSchumer Hey dumbass. Remember you don't control the Senate and your vote isn't needed. You are such a hack.  What are you hiding?
@CNNPolitics @brianstelter The leaks from Muellers team will never stop.
@TeddMcc @Jim_Jordan Yes too many damn Rhinos on the right. Trump has fought them as much as the Dems.  All BS
@CillizzaCNN No big thing! Just a fired ex employee who sucked and his job. But CNN will lick his butt now !
@CillizzaCNN Yeah a fired disgruntled ex Employee is always a good source. But if they say something bad about Trump. They must be believed per CNN
@mnt92277 @organic2016 But will they be able to pass it ? We've needed it for too long.
@brianstelter Hey fattie ! It just proves they were a bad pick. And thankful he is gone. He's upset that he was fired.What fired employees tells the truth
@BonBee81 @kaitlancollins Exactly ! The left mob ruins everything.  The hypocrisy is unreal.
@SenBlumenthal Sit down and shut up ! #stolenvalor
@BonBee81 @kaitlancollins They stand by her homo-phobic tweets !
@ckjbg @bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump 100 % correct
@TeddMcc @Jim_Jordan Jim doesn't deserve that criticism.  He's one that has been fighting for us. Paul Ryan deserves the criticism.  But yes it gets old.
@Peoples_Pundit I always fight it. But happy how it looks after. I've been told tomorrow is the day. Hoping for a bad storm :)
@Peoples_Pundit You know all of us guys fight putting the lights up on the house though. I think it's a guy thinh6. We usually loose. :)
@johncardillo I just can't wait to hear General Flynn speak out again. I think it's coming soon.

@RebekahWorsham https://t.co/nxLSNLZqLJ
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Wow that Magic wond just never stops !
@RebekahWorsham Sorry I need to hear it from Kelly,  the President or an Official White House Representative.  CNN has no credibility.
@RebekahWorsham Ha the source is CNN can we trust it. They've said this a dozen times.
@NBCNews More Fake News ! NBC just can't be out done by CNN.  Real journalism has been lost.
@LANURSE1 @WvTrump Ha shes just hoping that will make him touch her!
@NewDay @brianstelter Now do Kaitlin Collins homo-phobic tweets ! Don't be hypocrites !
@CNN To bad CNN doesn't have standards.  They are good with Kaitlin Collins homo-phobic tweets. But jump all over this. Real hypocrisy.
@KamalaHarris How about screwing a married man to advance your career ? Did she teach you that ?
@CuomoPrimeTime Ha this is funny knowing McCabe is going down. CNN will never give you the real facts about his wrong doings. Doesn't fit their agenda
@kaitlancollins @brianstelter Conspiracy News Network never stops with their bs
@bluejasmine17 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What an Idiot. That policy is working out so good in France right now.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump In other words Chucky wants to destroy America like what's happening in France. What an Idiot!
@ellie_t45 @dbongino 100 % correct. He was a lobbyist for the company that sold it. Prior to becoming a Senator.  He is crooked.
@jaketapper @LauraAJarrett @TheLeadCNN So will he be called the Presidents wingman ?
@jaketapper @abbydphillip @TheLeadCNN More conspiracy theories from CNN . Conspiracy News Network!
@KamalaHarris Shut up! The will of the people was to build a wall in 2016. You have obstructed the will none stop.
@MicahTNDC @SenBobCorker @nielslesniewski How about his legacy of making 16 mil while in office ? He screwed over the American Public.
@Gngerbrdgrl His old lobbying needs to be looked into. He is deeply involved with the company that sold the Uranium.  He needs to be exposed.
@FlynnJack515 100 % correct Jack. All these POS need to be exposed!
@ChrisCuomo You lying liberals.  Only time you celebrate a Republican is when they die. Your hypocrisy is unreal. He was a great man.
@DavidWaddell5 @WashTimes And she will obvious say she had no idea. The hypocrisy is unreal!
@ChrisCuomo And CNN doesn't care who leaked his conversation illegally. It against their fake narrative.
@NBCNews Wow is NBC really this stupid ? This is the worse reporting ever!
@jaketapper @kaitlancollins @TheLeadCNN TDS for CNN should be the real headline.  Actual journalism is lost.
@jaketapper @DavidJUrban @PaulBegala @K_JeanPierre @amandacarpenter @thelauracoates @kim_wehle @TheLeadCNN You mean making up Conspiracy theories with nothing to back them.  How pathetic!
@jaketapper @SaraMurray @TheLeadCNN Conspiracy theories!  Is that all you have Jake ?  What a joke
@LindseyGrahamSC And Lindsey Graham from  the Swamp is back.  I knew it was too good to last.  To bad he doesn't care as much about actual Americans murdered
@SaraCarterDC Sara you're the best. But why waste one minute on this loser ?

@HTownStacyBrown @WalshFreedom @MarkMeadows Isn't he really part of MSM and a Democrat now. His credibility left years ago.
@SenBlumenthal So we have a Senator who has no idea what was retracted in Flynn's sentencing memo. But wants to spread conspiracy theories.  #Stolenvalor
@CillizzaCNN Yes we all know you are a conspiracy theorist.  Keep going. Reality will not be nice to you. Nothing more than a bias political hack!
@KevinJacksonTBS One thing for sure. It doesn't matter what political party you are from. Dershowitz believes in fair honest Law.  We need more  of that.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @neal_katyal And CNN Conspiracy theories  are in full mode!  Mueller retracted just enough to let them continue.  The Kings of Conspiracy Propogandist !
@CillizzaCNN Just enough blocked out for the lefts conspiracy theories to run wild. They will be proved wrong again.
@llambchops @NBCNews Yep funny how they are all former Employees.  They must be worried.
@NBCNews Wow he really has the Deep State worried!
@sam_vinograd @Mediaite @cmarinucci @RepChrisStewart Liar ! He wasn't an American Citizen. He didn't even have a green card. Fake news. What a joke
@MarkWarner So how about you explain your secret texts ? What are you hiding? How's your conversations with Mueller going ? You are so corrupt.
@KamalaHarris So are illegal Immigrants from a foreign government?  And you promote them everyday. What a lying Hypocrite.
@CillizzaCNN Poor Chris is going to cry soon. There never was collusion and you've pushed that bs for 2 years now. Just another Dem propagandist.
@SenSanders You're an Idiot ! How about you resign and get an actual job. Instead of living off the tax payers back.

@climatebrad @SenSanders That's 100% bullshit ! Put your boots on for this crap .
@SenSanders Its sponsored by an Old Man who has made a living off screwing the American People.  Ever had a real job Bernie ? Or just government scum ?
@NBCNews NBC is straight Propogandist for the Dems.  Everyone knows the Judge ruled she was responsible for Trumps attorney cost. Quit the Propoganda
@Sherrysherry1 @NBCNews Dumb ass the Judge ruled that bv she had to pay his Attorney costs.  Shut up or learn what you are talking about. #idiot
@NBCNews He quoted what Stone Said ! NBC has really become Propogandist for the left. Pathetic journalism.
@brianstelter So in other words. He has no place for Dems and the Propogandist from CNN.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump America is not a State Police Country. So you have it half correct. What a hack

@jaketapper @DanaBashCNN @TheLeadCNN So is this fake news or is Muellers team leaking again?
@jaketapper @thelauracoates @JeffreyToobin @TheLeadCNN More conspiracy theories from CNN . They are good at conspiracy theories  that's for sure. Real journalism is dead.

@BGrueskin @brianstelter You mean like the 1000 of CNN headlines with no Evidence ?
@amandawgolden @jaketapper So the real question everyone should be asking.  Is this Fake News or is the Mueller Team leaking?
@gregorykorte @brianstelter @MiamiHerald Funny thing about this story.  Mueller was involved but the leftist dont want to mention it.  What a bunch of hacks
@ChrisOhio89 @Susan_Hennessey @MaxBoot Funny how they don't mention Muellers part in it !
@MiamiHerald @jaketapper Jake why no comment about Muellers part in this prosecution?  You know was involved.  Quit being a hack

@Uncle_Jimbo @washingtonpost As usual liberal network pushing an agenda. Bunch of bs
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Either scenario is bad for Our Country. But we deserve to know the truth. And the guilty people have to be held accountable.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Sounds good to me. I have no problem admitting if I'm wrong. Let's hope you can do the same.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Don't ever block me and we will continue this conversation in a few months. Keep spreading your conspiracy theories with no evidence for now
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Pathetic that my mind requires evidence and not conspiracy theories. Look at your name. ResisterSister.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Not triggered.  Stating to obvious. You're a fucking Idiot.  No proof or evidence just Propogandist talking points.  Get some fucking help
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Been fired. Had to resign  or demoted. The list will ge longer on the FBI and DOJ side.  But let's talk about facts.  You're a fucking idiot
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Here's even a better one. List how many people associated with trump have been Indicted for ties to Russia.  Then how many FBI or DOJ have
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Just coincidence that McCabe, Strokz were fired and a Dozier paid for by Hillary  was used by the FBI.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Orange man bad.  But Comney,  McCabe and Strokz are innocent right. You really are fucking stupid.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn That's the real threat to our democracy . McCabe and Strokz are probably your hero's.  Actual proof of their wrong doings. And you ignore it
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Its sad that you can't provide proof or evidence but continue  believing conspiracy theories.  You've admitted it's all political to you.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Again your wrong.  Wanting to see evidence.  Should be a requirement. So many things are crooked and you are blind to them all.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Dont worry I'll accept whatever comes out. I honestly care about our democracy.  Hope it goes your way. If not I think you'll need help
@TXResisterhood More conspiracy theories. Si far no evidence has been provided my Mueller or the FBI to tie trump to Russia.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn As I've said many times . Please provide some evidence. Until then make sure you let everyone know your a conspiracy theorist
@TXResisterhood So are you upset that the Republican oversight has been restricted by the FBI and DOJ? Or just thr Dems conspiracies?
@TXResisterhood Apparently you haven't read my tweets.  I explained clearly. I'll believe wherever the facts and Evidence lead. You've provided none
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Sad is being a conspiracy theorist  with no evidence or facts to back it. You lost any arguement  many tweets ago. It's all political
@TXResisterhood Oh so now you admit you know nothing about his ties to Russia.  So all your statements earlier are conspiracy theories.  Glad you admitted .
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn I'll call you political for pushing a political agenda with no facts. Doesn't take a genius to figure that out. You've proved my point
@TXResisterhood You already stated he was bad before he was elected.  You've made it all political. Twist and turn it anyway you want.  That's the truth
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Once again. It's all political to you. No bias at all. Just comment from now on. Trump is bad. No evidence needed.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn See you are 100 % political.  The more you tweet . The more obvious it becomes.  Trump is bad. No evidence needed.  Your statement really
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn See your true feeling. No matter what Trump is bad. Evidence is needed.  Or peoples votes don't matter to you. That's a threat to democracy
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Conspires theories hurt our democracy  . Both sides are guilty of that until real evidence is provided.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Either Trump is guilty or there was a setup. Evidence had been provided that the FBI handled stuff wrong. It might be nothing.  Or might be.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn It is political.  Oversight by both sides had been impeded. That's the truth.  Facts and evidence need to be followed.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn I honestly won't spread a conspiracy theory without facts. Your responses prove it's all political for you.  No facts or Evidence
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn You honestly don't think the Republicans would stand up to Trump if there was Evidence ? Statements like that prove it's all political.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Oh here you go with another conspiracy theory.  You know Pences thoughts now also. Do you have anything that is facts and not conspiracy?
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Fact you don't understand.  If Trump removed Mueller he would be impeached. But evidence is needed. Not conspiracy theories
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Real facts by Democrats. Like this. Get help. You need it https://t.co/xgzCISbUOu
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Funniest thing here. Is I do believe Trump should be Indicted and impeached if he has ties to Russia. But Evidence is needed.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Not one of those listed have been proven true yet. So you believe conspiracy theories.  Evidence doesn't matter. Fuck you are stupid.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn And then also tell me where in his Indictment it shows he met with a Russian connection?  Shouldn't be hard if you are right ?
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn So you are telling me that since it all started with papi. If Misfud was western intelligence  and not a Russian Agent. It wasn't a setup ?
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn So many things tying Trump to Russia according to you. But you can't provide one. That's called conspiracy theorist.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn If their was no there with them 2 . You're whole conspiracy is shattered. But keep your left Propogandist agenda.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Funny how the guy that started  the investigation doesn't concern you ?  Or the fact that Carter Page will never be indicted.  Key parts !
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn The truth with no Evidence. Hope you don't need a safe space when your God Muellet disappoints you. Funny how you run from Misfud. No facts
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Or so now your telling me the bias Dems will get to the bottom.  But your God Mueller can't with out the Dems.  Way to contradict yourself.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn I don't worship Donnie or any Politicak figure. But I do believe in facts and evidence. When you can provide them let me know.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn That's funny coming from a guy that provides no evidence.  Why didn't the Dems made the midterms about Russia ? Can't fix stupid
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn And sure explain how the investigation started with Misfud and provide facts to support your conspiracy theory about Misfud. Still waiting
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Ha once again it's all political to you. Real evidence or facts don't matter. You can't support your argument.  Another partisan hack.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn I know Mueller has become God for you left wing conspiracy theorist. Even though there's no proof to connect Trump. #cantfixstupid
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Fantasy world. But you can provide evidence that Misfud was a Russian Agent.  That started the investigation. The real fantasy in your head.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Wow so otherwise if it was a setup  , you don't  care. It's all political for you. Don't talk about country over party then. Truth comes out
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn America should be concerned  about the abuse of power from the last Administration  if it was a setup.  You cant dispute Misfuds connection
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn It doesn't matter why it started ? Wow you're pathetic.  If it was a setup.  Then you dont care about country over party. What a hypocrite!
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn So if he worked for Midwestern Intelligence.  The FBI would know that correct ?  Doesn't take much to realize it was a setup.  If he did.
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Doesn't take a genius to know the whole investigation started over someone talking to Misfud. So is Misfud a Russian Agent ?
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn So you wont answer if he was a Russian Agent ? Or is he midwestern intelligence  ?
@TXResisterhood @JohnCornyn Guess you dont dare answer that question. Just another left wing conspiracy theorist.
