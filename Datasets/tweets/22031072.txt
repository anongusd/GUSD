@Nikkonito I don't want govt to do anything not specifically granted in the constitution. That's why we have one.
@Nikkonito Furthermore: If I was close enough on the NWA flight the guy with the bomb wouldn't have gotten off alive. Defend against actions
@Nikkonito Not at all. If a man tries to steal from someone & you can prevent it, you should. I want to stop the govt stealing from you.
@Nikkonito All aggression & unprovoked violence is immoral & abhorrent. I will never try to control you & should not control me either.
@Nikkonito Mommy (liberals) want to feed and care for you & Daddy (conservatives) want to tell you what you can & can't do. Simple.
@Nikkonito Thanks for the discussion. I enjoyed it.
@Nikkonito I agree to disagree! LIve & Let Live! Viva la difference!
@Nikkonito As adults we do not need a mommy (liberals) to feed us, or a daddy (conservatives) to rule over & punish us if don't his will.
@Nikkonito So therefore, you would advocate use of force or violence to bring people to your way of thinking. How is that "CIVIL"?
@Nikkonito When 2 agree it's no one else's business provided their contract doesn't infringe on someone else.
@Nikkonito I agree the State is the real enemy. Furthermore, I may not agree with what you may say, but I defend your RIGHT to say it.
@Nikkonito If he beats his wife he is infringing on her right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. NOT VERY HAPPY GETTING HIT!
@Nikkonito Actions that infringe on another person's rights must have consequences, but one must be free to do as he pleases if does no harm
@Nikkonito All of those things are actions that infringe upon another person's right to Life, Liberty & the pursuit of happiness.
@Nikkonito How are you injured by someone having a different religious belief? Only when their action infringes on your right: life, liberty
It's not from the benevolence of the butcher, brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.
@Nikkonito We all do better when each man pursues his own interest. By agreement we can go things together, but never by force or violence.
@Nikkonito A wide acceptance of beliefs can't injury you. Only if those beliefs cause actions against your rights. Then you must defend.
@Nikkonito A man's moral code itself can't infringe on your rights only his actions. If actions infringe on your right you defend yourself.
Both govt & organized crime resort to force & violence to accomplish their objectives. #tlot

@Nikkonito I have to disagree. Libertarianism believes in the philosophy of "Live & Let Live." They don't want to control or be controlled.
