For example, in 2014, the department was asked to mediate 686 medical bills. During the 2018 fiscal year, it received 4,445 bills.		Hancock said the program, so far, has saved Texas patients $30 million.
Under this legislation, both sides of the payment dispute would settle their issues through an existing balance-bill mediation program. The Texas Dept. of Insurance program has been successful in lowering medical bills across the state. via @AshLopezRadio https://t.co/UP56WCN8Tm

It is unclear whether funding for the program will be available in March if the #shutdown continues. The benefits for February cost the federal government approx. $4.8 billion.
The ~ 40 million people who depend on federal food assistance will get their February benefits early, because the government #shutdown means the money will be unavailable later, officials say.

CA’s medical board officials say they’re taking aggressive action against doctor sexual misconduct and plan no major changes. But a KHN/@CalHealthline investigation reveals many doctors – even those with multiple alleged victims – get probation, and some egregiously reoffend.
