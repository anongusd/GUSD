Alvin Brown was bad for Jacksonville when he was Mayor, and he’d be even worse as a Representative in Congress. https://t.co/8MyDSKFRfZ
I hope everyone in the @CityofJax remembers why Alvin Brown didn’t win re-election for Mayor.. he’s a bad representative of our great city. And trust me, as someone who lives and works in Washington, D.C., you don’t want him representing you up here either. #ilovejax @JayBuz24
@AGGancarski Also.. who actually waits for the former Rep. to be officially taken to PRISON to file for office. Someone’s priorities are CLEARLY misaligned. Not saying @MayorAlvinBrown is the next Corrine.. but not saying he’s not either 😬
@AGGancarski @RepAlLawsonJr understands the importance of bipartisanship and representing the people while Alvin Brown is just looking for a job. @MayorAlvinBrown why don’t you just go find Hilary so you can both wallow together on the pains of feeling forgotten. BYE.
@AGGancarski A good Representative understands the importance of working with all sides to get things done for the District. Not only was Alvin Brown an unpopular mayor, he didn’t even have the support from his own party to get things done in Jax. It would be a mistake to vote for him.
@CJLeMaster Well hello Mississippi. Go NOLES.
@CJLeMaster @NatResources If you ever want a statement before your last minute, try-hard dis on twitter approach, feel free to reach out.
@CJLeMaster Your tweet doesn’t even make sense. Here’s the guy who tweets for the committee? Everyone already knows @BenGoldey is the mastermind behind our digital game. Guess it feels pretty bad to be the late to the game.
@CJLeMaster @NatResources @realDonaldTrump Try harder to make your point next time.
It’s extremely disheartening to see Congressional Democrats stay seated when @realDonaldTrump calls for an end the opioid epidemic.
It’s unfortunate when the #SOTU cameras turn to Members of the Democratic Party and they look so sad to be Americans.. have some pride in your county. We’re the best in the world. 🇺🇸
@JackieTothDC Hmmm. Sounds a lot like our talking points on the lack of management authority given to tribes under Obama’s proclamation. Congressional action is required to establish tribal co-management, and that’s exactly what @RepJohnCurtis bill does.
@JackieTothDC It’s up to @NRDems who they want to invite as their witness, and for the Jan 9 hearing, they chose to invite Shaun Chapoose of the Ute Indian Tribe.
