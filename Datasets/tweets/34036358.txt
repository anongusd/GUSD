The Murdochs say they want to create a safe environment for women, but this suit shows how Fox News executives continued to silence one
Roginsky's suit also alleges that even after Ailes was forced out, Fox News' general counsel Dianne Brandi didn't investigate her claims
Roginsky's suit describes in detail how Fox staffers pressured employees to publicly defend Ailes against Gretchen Carlson's suit
As a contributor, Roginsky is not bound by arbitration rules in employment contracts, meaning this thing could go all the way to court.

Important context for Bannon promotion: Breitbart has a v. complicated relationship with Fox News. The site has trashed Megyn Kelly, Ailes

On August 2, I made calls to Trump campaign after hearing Ailes was advising Trump, and senior Trump sources shot it down.
