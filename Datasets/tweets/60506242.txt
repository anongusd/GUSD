North Korea claimed that Warmbier contracted botulism.		A question for the White House: Does President Trump agree with Kim Jong Un that Otto Warmbier died from botulism, or from these "barbaric acts," as described by a federal judge based on expert testimony? https://t.co/19x8DCsNIQ
"Cynthia Warmbier, his mother, said ... his eyes reminded her of pictures she had seen of Holocaust victims."
At the hearing, one expert testified:		* DPRK torturers likely forced Warmbier's confession during an ‚Äúold-fashioned, Stalinist show trial.‚Äù 	* DPRK likely used pliers to rearrange Warmbier's once-straight teeth.	* A scar on Warmbier's foot "consistent" with torture by electrodes
That's the lede of a report from a fact-finding hearing on the DPRK's responsibility, shortly after which a federal judge ordered the regime to pay $501 million to the Warmbier family.		Here's what the court heard before that ruling. https://t.co/gWLH0ihGU3
As reported by my colleague @ByTimRyan: 		"The first time Otto Warmbier‚Äôs family saw him after he returned to the  United States following 18 months as a North Korean hostage, he was strapped to a gurney on a plane, thrashing and making a 'guttural howling' sound."

"I see my job as both an effort for closure for this incident, this tragedy," Netburn says, but also an effort to protect "the rule of law."		"And with that, we are adjourned," she said. "Thank you everybody."
Judge Netburn ends the proceedings without a ruling, before addressing the 9/11 victim families. 		"I am incredibly sympathetic to the fact that it's 2019 and this process is still in the beginning phases," she says, predicting a few weeks before her decision.
Saudi Arabia's attorney Andrew Chun-Yang Shen cited "international comity" for keeping docs sealed. 		The kingdom identified 145 docs that it produced and designated confidential. It wants to seal 73 of those, claiming protection for 63 of those under the Vienna Convention.
I'll loop back to some of that later. The final part of the hearing relates to Saudi Arabia's motion to seal documents. 		Judge Netburn said the New York Times filed a letter on this matter, presumably seeking press access.
The hearing is now in a brief recess. 		There is a lot that happened between that, much very technical, regarding what discovery Saudi Arabia must provide at this stage. The case was only authorized into jurisdictional discovery.
Earlier in the hearing, Pounian said that 30-year FBI vet Michael Rochford asserted that "Bayoumi and Thumairy were tasked with assisting the hijackers." 		"The only reasonable conclusion is that someone in the Saudi government gave them that task," Pounian says.
@bradheath @Emily_Saul_ @TheNewsHam Not as forward-thinking as the Empire State.
@bradheath @Emily_Saul_ @TheNewsHam Weird, huh?
"Why were they paying him a salary?" Pounian asks.
Pounian also seeks more information on the kingdom's financing of Bayoumi, whom he says had 6 different job titles, "each of which was completely phony."		"There's no evidence that he was doing any actual work for the kingdom. The question is: What was he doing for the kingdom?"
Pounian says that Saudi Arabia refuses to turn over documents about its financing of the mosque.		"At this time, your honor, the hijackers were at the mosque," Pounian said, adding later: "This is where they found shelter in Los Angeles."
Pounian: The Saudi government effectively "took control of" the King Fahad mosque in 1997 until at least August 2001.		They want docs about Thumairy's chain of command - who's above him and who's below him.
Pounian: Saudi Arabia claims that Thumairy only worked at California's King Fahad mosque, which the kingdom characterized as a private charity.		Pounian says that they obtained records from the mosque showing that 7 out of 12 directors were tied to the Saudi gov't.
Steve Pounian, for the plaintiffs, is up now saying that's not true. He says he requested a document "repeatedly" and it has not been produced "to this day."
An attorney for Saudi Arabia claimed to have turned over every piece of paper on  Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, a reputed intelligence officer and former consular official, respectively, allegedly tied to 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
@moo_jam1 Good question!
Spoiler:		"I'm not going to rule from the bench today," Netburn announces. "So I'll start with the ending first."		The agenda, at the top of this thread, is mostly discovery matters, including Saudi Arabia's bid to seal documents.
"I want to particularly welcome the family members who are here," Judge Netburn says.		She notes that she reserved the ceremonial courtroom to accommodate them.

@BarefootRockU @bethmonster @jamesvasile She said she spoke to several inmates. As for Quay, Torres oversees him ‚Äî not vice-versa.		In her ruling, she said that civil cases are the vehicle for getting relief like federal monitoring. That sort of ruling in a civil case is more likely to stick on appeal than one like this
@sbplama A couple of individual defendants at MDC sought relief at the heart of the crisis. FD apparently saw an opening for a broader solution. She shut it down and effectively told them to do it through their lawsuit. They can continue to seek targeted relief for their clients.
Did Trump just take credit for a record number of women being voted into office, overwhelmingly in the Democratic Party?
@BetsyGinsberg Poor phrasing on my part, and Judge Torres did say just that. Punting only in the basic sense that she was saying: go there.
Just got out of SDNY doing my courthouse beat. What else is going on tonight?
@KatieD1183 Unclear: This particular case, not the MDC litigation as a whole, relates to a couple of inmates only. She invited more motions from them, and we‚Äôll see how that develops.		The Brooklyn case seeks MDC-wide relief.
@lexlanthony Right, I wasn‚Äôt commenting on the judge‚Äôs ruling. I was only pointing out what she didn‚Äôt say, and she didn‚Äôt clear them of misconduct. She just told the Federal Defenders to pursue the solution in their Brooklyn lawsuit.
@lexlanthony She spent the day building a record, and she didn‚Äôt contradict it in her ruling.		If she thought MDC handled the situation okay, she could have said that; she didn‚Äôt. She only declined to offer specific relief for the problems identified. MDC isn‚Äôt exonerated here.
The upshot: Judge Torres declining to rule in the Federal Defenders' favor here does not signal a clean bill of health to MDC.
Judge Torres pressed the attorneys on what relief she could grant. The major request, a special master overseeing MDC, is the subject of a newly filed lawsuit. She punted that issue to that case.		On the transfer, she found that specific record under-developed for two inmates.
Small postscript for folks perplexed about that anti-climactic conclusion: 		My analysis - There is litigation over the #MDCBrooklyn fallout before multiple judges. For now, heat and power are essentially restored, and there's a federal order mandating access to counsel. (cont'd)
(Both literally - inside the now-brighter jail - and figuratively in terms of public disclosure of the conditions there.)		My colleagues at @CourthouseNews and I will keep following this as it develops in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
If they do, the attorneys will need to explain why they didn't provide more evidence to support their specific requests earlier.		That's it for today.		At least for the SDNY channel of the #MDCBrooklyn litigation, the state of the union is the status quo, with more sunlight.
Spilke presses on with an attempt for a special master: "This is bigger than one CO. One captain. One warden."		Torres doesn't budge: the special master application is denied.		She gives them another opportunity to request their clients' transfer.
Torres on the special master: "So that specific relief is requested in the complaint filed by the Federal Defenders in the (EDNY)."		She does not believe it's an appropriate remedy in the criminal context.
Kunstler presses on to seek other relief: the appointment of a special master.		"Frankly, your honor there's a crisis of confidence here," she said.		"It's too much, your honor. I'm overwhelmed by my experiences at the jail."
(The current and former inmate who testified today were other incarcerated people at MDC.)
Neither of them testified during today's hearing. Their attorneys offered to bring the defendants into court now, but Torres said they're late: There was already a more than 4-hour hearing.
She said that defendant Segura-Genao in this case requested a transfer, claiming that he would be retaliated against because of speaking up. Another defendant requested a transfer to a hospital.		Torres doesn't seem to buy it: "Not a shred of evidence" supporting their requests.
She says a court stenographer and her law clerks accompanied her along with the attorneys, @TishJames, warden Herman Quay and some of the witnesses.		She spoke to the inmates, some in the common area and some in their cells.
Torres recites the background of today's hearing: "I felt it imperative that I conduct a full evidentiary hearing and an inspection at MDC."
Same question from Torres: What changed between his Feb. 1 visit and his visit today?		Ross agrees that it's warmer and brighter now.		Torres: Anything else?	Ross: The inmates are out... Out and about, the normal routine.		Ross's testimony concludes.
Von Dornum's testimony ends. 		Judge Torres calls special agent Ross at DOJ back to the witness stand.
Kunstler: Did this visit change your opinion any way that a special master was needed?		Objection.		Von Dornum: It did not.		She said that what "struck me" was the inability to get reliable information.
"I did not see any legal visits taking place," she said, but she did see social differences.		Torres: Any questions from counsel?		The attorneys confer.
"The phones were clearly up," she continues. "We saw the inmates making social calls."		Von Dornum said that the denial of medical care is still a concern, and water's largely improved now, except in the SHU, where the water's still cold in those showers.
"It was much warmer, much brighter, but it was clear that the medical situation had not been rectified," she said.		The inmates singled out "CO Webster" as providing very good care, unlike the other COs, she testifies.
Other than light and heat, she notes that the floors had "clearly been scrubbed."		"Before, they were quite dirty," she says.		The leaks from the ceiling remained the same, she says, currently dripping water and showing evidence of water damage.
Von Dornum's giving a floor-by-floor accounting of the lights and heat. Now, it's getting "even a little uncomfortably warm at times," she says.		Reminder: Von Dornum's  the attorney-in-charge of the Federal Defenders of New York for EDNY.
Von Dornum describes what's different from the tour today from her last visit.		She says it's "far warmer" and "more bright" now.		When she was there on Feb. 1, she says, "It was dark and cold."
"All rise."		Judge Torres returns to the bench and calls a witness back: Von Dornum.

With that, Torres adjourns the hearing to visit the MDC, and she says she may reconvene depending on what she sees.		"We may be resuming later," she adds.		One request seeking judicial notice of Weather Channel data on the temperatures in NYC during the relevant time period.
Kunstler cross-examines him, with one question asking what he was wearing.		Ross says he wore an overcoat over his clothing.		Q: Are you wearing an overcoat today?	A: No.		He wore a suit.
Ross talks about an inmate with colitis and an open wound. Unclear if it's the same one.		Torres: Do you have any other observations concerning the temperature and the treatment of the inmate?		Ross says the temperature was "fine," but medical treatment "concerned me the most."
Torres: What about the inmates? How were they dressed?		Ross: The inmates within the cells. Some had T-shirts on... Some had blankets over their heads.
Torres: How were the corrections officers dressed on that day?		Ross: The correctional officers in the lobby had winter coats on.
Ross describes touring MDC after the fire in late January: "Then we went down to the 6th floor and we went to the various units on the floor. For the most part, the units seemed okay, normal."		One of the units, he said, felt "cooler."
Next witness: John Ross, a supervisory special agent at @TheJusticeDept in the Eastern District of New York.
@JessicaAttieG Thank you!
Brief cross-examination ends.		Kunstler back up for redirect.
Von Dornum's cross-examination begins.		Q: Were you aware that the heat was generally back on?	A: Yes, I heard there was some inconsistency.		But yes, she adds.
Von Dornum says that MDC never has had a special master.		10 minute recess. Possible cross-examination ahead after that.
Von Dornum notes that, in the past, there were a number of forcible rapes at MDC. 		"I do think that if the guards knew, if the management knew, that people could show up at any time," Von Dornum says, things might change.		She requests putting a special master in place.
Kunstler says she has no more questions but wants the opportunity to possibly recall her later.		Judge Torres asks the witness what relief she wants.		"The biggest problem here is the lack of transparency," she says, and Von Dornum wants her help with that.
Von Dornum said that Velazquez told her she was unable to speak to any inmate.
Q: Why did you want to tour the facility with Congressperson Velazquez?		Von Dornum says two reasons: The congresswoman's Spanish is stronger than hers, and Von Dornum knows how to navigate the prison and push back against official denials of access.
Von Dornum said that one inmate slept on wet sheets because of leaks in the SHU. 		Those are the so-called "special housing units" commonly known as "the hole" or solitary confinement.
Q: On Feb. 1, when you visited the facility, who else visited the facility?		Von Dornum said that she arrived at the same time as Rep. @NydiaVelazquez, but that MDC officials would not let them take tour around together.
Von Dornum says that her clients unable to reach their families - with the social phones down - asked her to relate messages to them.		"Families were able to visit for the first time last night, which was great," she said.
Von Dornum describes the Federal Defenders phone as a free, unrecorded line.		There's a social phone that's a recorded phone, which inmates use by purchasing time from the commissary.
I mention this to make a simple point: With layoffs and buyouts across the country, providing information about our institutions remains crucial. 		Protect journalism. 		Now, back to the feed.
While there is a pause in this proceeding, a quick note: There are several other reporters in the court. 		At Guantanamo, there is usually one reporter, who typically live-tweets like this for military commission hearings. That's Carol Rosenberg, whom McClatchy offered a buyout.
"Common areas, it generally reflects my experiences," she says, but in other areas, she added, it felt significantly lower than recorded.
Kunstler shows the witness the government exhibit of the MDC temperature readings.		Q: Do these temperature readings comport with your experience at the units?		Von Dornum said that she was not able to go into some of the cells, but that there was a "great temperature variation."
"The man with colitis and the open wound," she said, was put on the defense witness list but had to be hospitalized before today's hearings.		So Von Dornum says he will not testify.
Von Dornum said that she learned that computer outage interfered with treatment.		Describing the client with colitis, the bloody sheets and the open wound, Von Dornum said that an MDC official claimed he was receiving treatment. He still had that open wound.
Von Dornum also disputes the warden's claim that the inmates had hot meals and medical care.		When she visited, she recalled them saying: "Today is the first day" they received hot food. 		She said an inmate reported losing 5 or 6 lbs in the past few days, &amp; was denied treatment.
Von Dornum disputes that the warden's contention that hot water was not impacted. 		"There was not hot water in some of the showers," she said.
Torres asks to elaborate on the all the days that she personally observed cold temperatures or heard reports from her clients.		"They would get on the phone and beg," Von Dornum said.		"They were expressing real terror in a way that I haven't heard."
"Heat has never been impacted," Von Dornum said, is "false."		She recalls it being "quite cold" when she visited.
Kunstler asks the witness to pick apart the details in Warden Quay's report that are inconsistent with what she saw.		She says the statement that "inmates have not been confined to their cells" and that they were allowed recreational activity is "false."
Von Dornum saw one inmate who was shot at the time of his arrest, and she said his bandages had not been changed for weeks. There was pus coming out of the bandage, she said.
Von Dornum: "I talked to people who said that they had seizures and pressed the emergency button, and no one came."
"There was frost on people's windows," she said. 		"People were begging me to call their lawyers," she continued later. "So I have personal knowledge that what the warden said was false."
"I had clients with bloody sheets from colitis," she said.
"It was hard to reconcile what I was hearing" from the BOP with reports from inmates throughout the building, who have no connection to each other and speak different languages, Von Dornum testified.
She said that she was in the middle of a multi-day bail hearing by a client with one kidney.		Seeking more information, Von Dornum said, she contacted the BOP. 		"The response we got was, none, or that heating has not been affected," she said.
Von Dornum says that the Federal Defenders have 500 to 600 clients there at any time, and none of the defense attorneys could see their clients.		"We were hearing truly alarmed reports," she says.
Questioned by Kunstler, Von Dornum describes the day of the fire and says that inmates reported an "acrid electrical smell."		Q: How did this fire affect your ability to do your job.		Von Dornum replies in "several ways," starting with attorney visits being curtailed.
* von Dornum
The brief cross-ex described the lockdown of the MDC to protect from threats.		No redirect.		Next witness: Dierdre Dionysia von Dornham, attorney-in-charge at the Federal Defenders of New York
Cross-examination by AUSA Portlock. She takes this one.
No computer also means "no intelligence for us," if the prison needs to conduct intelligence research.		"Intelligence?" Torres interrupts.		Garcia gives the example of an inmate transferred from another jail. The computer outage would prevent them of learning about that prisoner.
Garcia says that there's no commissary when the computers are down. 		Thermal underwear can only be purchased through commissary, Spilke notes.
Garcia describes the breaker system that separates inmate (cut by the power outage) and staffer phones (not cut by the power outage).
Up now is MDC's assistant warden "to be identified by the government."		His name is Elezar Garcia (sp?).
Questioned by Judge Torres, Murray says his cellmate wore the same thin sweatshirt he did.		No cross-examination by the government.		Murray steps down.
Q: Did you have access to hot food during this period?	A: The food was cold when it came to my cell.		Q: Do you feel ready for trial in your case, sir?	A: No, I don't.		Kunstler: No further questions.
Murray said he asked for mental health treatment on Monday, and hasn't received it.		He said last saw his lawyer at the beginning of January, and he's about to go to trial. He says it's part of the reason he requested treatment.
Q: Was there air coming in through the vent in your cell?	A: Yes.		Q: What kind of air was that?	A: Cold air.
Murray said he knows because the corrections officer [CO] took a reading in his cell.		The CO was bundled up. Murray was not, he said.		"I had nothing to bundle up [in]," he says.
Recounting the power outage after the fire, Murray testifies: "The lights was out. The heat was off, and we was locked in."		"It was hard on me because it was dark," he said. "It was cold. I was nervous."		He said that the temperature in his cell was between 30 to 40 degrees.
Up now is Donnell Murray, an MDC inmate. Kunstler questions him.
By then, the inmates hadn't showered for three days, Williams said.		Direct examination ends. Again, no cross-ex. Next witness.
Williams said that he saw eight to 10 inmates.		He said that he was there in the day, but the lights were off. "At least two of the cells" had inadequate heat by the time they arrived.		Some of the inmates blocked the vents to prevent cold air from coming in, he says.
"Where is your plan? You don't seem to have a plan," Williams recalled saying.		Williams testifies that MDC officials seemed to be annoyed that he and other electeds were there and cared about the prisoners.
Q: You said, "Let's just get the trucks there" or something like that; the trucks were carrying what?		Hundreds of blankets and portable generators, Williams replies.
"I reached out to the Mayor's office to say, 'We need to push again. At least get the trucks there,'" Williams said.		He said that the blankets were not distributed; there was no emergency plan, and "there was no plan to create a plan."
Williams said the most "astonishing thing was the lack of urgency."
He says that his tour - with a contingent of electeds - lasted more than an hour.		He said the inmates had been on lockdown.		"It was pretty astonishing, actually," he said. "There were people we were trying to connected to get medical attention."		One had an eye infection.
* February, forgive the typo.
Q: At some point, did you tour the MDC?	A: Yes.		"We heard some news that things weren't going well there," Williams said, adding later: "We went down there to check it out for ourselves."		Torres: What day did you visit?	A: Saturday, [Feburary] 2nd.
Again, the government has no cross-examination.		Spilke calls the next witness: New York City Council member @JumaaneWilliams.
He says that the heating is "completely fixed" now.		"The institution has heat," Sanon says.		He testifies that this was the first time he observed heating problems at MDC.
Q: As local president, were you satisfied with the responses you were getting from management?	A: No, I was not.		Sanon describes his tours with Congress officials and others.
Q: Did you bring those concerns to the attention of management?	A: Yes, I did.		Q: And, did anything happen?	Sanon says that management told him that they were going to take care of it.
Spilke: So are you saying inmate morale affects your members, as well?	A: Yes.
Q: Did you receive any complaints about this power outage from your members?	A: Yes.		Torres: What were there specific complaints?	Sanon replies lighting was a big one, because it poses a security issue and impeded their ability to detect contraband.
Approximately two weeks before, he says, but he doesn't know because he wasn't in the institution at the time. 		"From what I was told, they told me the entire building was affected at that time," Sanon says.		Q: That includes staff-only floors?	A: That includes everybody.
Spilke questions him.		Q: The problems with the electricity started a couple of weeks before [the fire]?		Sanon replies that's correct.
Up now is Anthony Sanon, a senior specialist and union president at MDC.
Again, the government has no cross-examination.
Kunstler asks whether family visits have been restored.		"I have no idea," Bencebi says.
She says that union members complained about the cold, "particularly at night," and that she related those complaints to the union president.
Q: Is this a safe situation for staffers on the unit?	A: I would say, no. It isn't a safe situation for the staff.		She testifies that the government shutdown aggravated the situation.
Q: Did you see any extra blankets given to them?	A: No.		Same with space heaters.		Torres: You were wearing more clothing than they were, was that correct?	A: I couldn't say.		She says she didn't observe.
Torres: In what areas of the building did you observe the inmates huddled.	A: In their cells, on the 4th floor.
Q: When you spoke to the press to the New York Times, you said, "They just stay huddled up in bed," you were referring to the inmates?	A: Yes.
Torres asks if there was heat coming out of the vents on three cold dates she describes, the third being Jan. 27.		"No," Bencebi replies.
"A couple of the inmates said that they were cold. Some of my elderly inmates said that they were cold."		Torres asks if there were "physical manifestations" of inmates being cold.		Bencebi replies that she didn't interact with the inmates on those days.
"I remember on Martin Luther King Day, it was extremely cold," Bencebi says.		She said that other staffers used a space heater, but she did not have one.
She recalls putting on a winter hat, a couple pairs of gloves and then a coat. She says she also saw others bundling up.		She testifies that it became a problem again on Martin Luther King Day.
Kunstler questions Bencibi about the heating problems.		"I remember it was supposed to be the coldest day of the year," Bencibi says, not recalling the date.		Q: Was that in January?	A: Yes.		Q: Did that predate the fire at the facility?	A: Yes.
Hai June Bencibi, case manager at MDC and a local treasurer at the jail's union, takes the stand.
"It sounded desperate and it sounds like people who wanted to be heard," she says. 		Direct examination ends. No cross examination. Next witness.
"I've never heard that sound outside the MDC, ever," Guevara recounts.		Q: How did it make you feel?		Objection. Overruled.		A: It was shocking to hear. It's not a sound that you normally hear... To me as a social worker... it sounded like a cry for help.
The judge does not allow the witness to comment on what the noise was.		Torres: She's hearing a noise and now, she's essentially guessing how the noise was produced.
Note: It sounds like several of the other viral videos of the clanging outside the MDC that made the rounds on Twitter on Feb. 1.
Guevara describes hearing the echoing of clicking from the MDC walls from outside the prison. 		She made a video that Spilke offers as an exhibit.
Clarification on the last witness: Torres interrupted the direct examination because the time was up. The government had the opportunity for cross-examination but declined it. That's why the prior witness's testimony abruptly ended.
@andylidholm She allowed cross-ex. Time limit was up on the direct examination, and the gov't declined cross-ex.
Up now is Vivienne Guevara, a director of social work at Federal Defenders of New York.
Q: Were you able to go to recreation?	A: They ain't let us go outside. They didn't want us to go out in the yard.		Describing his release, Cruz says: "I was surprised. I was crying."		Torres abruptly interrupts. Times up. No cross-ex. No redirect. Next witness.
Q: Were you able to get in contact with your family.	A: No.		"It was stressful," he said. "They're the only people who make me feel comfortable."
Q: Was it still a problem when you left?		Cruz replies that there was still no hot water.		Q: What about people with special diets?	A: No, there weren't getting nothing.		A Hindu inmate only had water and bread during that time, Cruz says.
"You're locked in your cell. You can't even press the emergency button because [no one] would respond."		Q: Did you get clean laundry during this time?	A: No.		Cruz testifies that he could take a shower every 72 hours.		"I wasn't going to take a shower in frozen water," he says.
"There was no light in the cell."		Q: Even during the day.	Yes, he replies.		"It's horrible. It's horrible. I don't like it."
Kunstler asks him about his meals during that time.	A: Two sandwiches. A bologna and cheese and another.		Q: Did you receive hot meals?	A: No.		"It was always dark," he says.
There was still no electricity when he left, on Jan. 30.
Cruz testifies that his bunkmate put book covers over the vent.
Cruz: "It was cold. It didn't have AC that first day. There was no AC. There was no heat." ...		"I couldn't sleep because it was cold."		He said that he was sleeping in his jumpsuit. He was completely dressed and had two pairs of socks on.
"When I first went in, the lights went off, and then the next day, the lights went back on."		Kunstler pivots to the Jan. 27, the day of the fire.
* former MDC inmate.		Cruz testified that was released at the end of January.
Defense attorney Sarah Kunstler notes that Cruz is a defendant and MDC inmate. 		She wants to limit cross-examination to the conditions at MDC, not criminal history or pending cases.
Q: The only way that you recorded the temperatures was by writing it down.		Maffeo agrees. 		Redirect ends, and the next witness is coming up: Miguel Cruz.
On the floor, it's 73.6 degrees.		Spilke asks whether the temperature varies depending on where you point in the room.		Q: If an inmate got out of bed, might that affect the reading?		Maffeo says it might "slightly."
Q: Was it actually that model?	A: No, it was not.		Maffeo points the laser gun to courtroom wall and takes a reading: 73.7.
Spilke asks what time of day it was taken.	Maffeo says he doesn't know and only started recording time on Feb. 1.		Maffeo: "We used a laser point and aim measuring gun."	Spilke: "You mean like this?"		Spilke brandishes the equipment in the air and hands it to the witness.
Redirect:		Spilke asks about whether Maffeo or anyone on his staff took the temperature of the medical records area. 		A: Yes.		Q: Is that reflected in your notes?	A: Yes.
Cross-examination begins.		AUSA Portlock tries to admit the temperature readings.	Spilke doesn't object.		It's admitted.
Maffeo says that it could take "up to a year" to replace some of the broken equipment. Unclear which.
Maffeo says that there's no way to transfer power from the "Priority 1" and "Priority 2" to the "Priority 3" equipment.		Inmate computers and phones are "Priority 3" equipment.		Q: Is there a priority below "Priority 3"?		Maffeo replies that no, that is the lowest.
The fire knocked out "Priority 3" equipment, Maffeo testifies.		He says "Priority 1" and "Priority 2" equipment was powered through "the whole incident."		I'll try to define that jargon as soon as I receive clarification.
Q: Did you consider this power outage to be an emergency?	A: Of course.
Spilke asks whether the power outage affected the phones.		Maffeo said that the inmate and staff phones are two separate systems: for security and "monitoring" reasons.		The power knocked out the monitored lines.
Due to the extent of damage, Maffeo says, he knew it would be a "prolonged issue." Maffeo says that he has an electrical background.		"I knew it wasn't going to be a quick, overnight, return to service type of repair," he testified.
"I told him that I'm on my way in," Maffeo adds.		Q: What happened next?	A: He says that FDNY was onsite when he arrived and extinguished the fire and the power was "knocked off service."
Maffeo recounts being notified about the fire by a staff member while he was at home. 		The staffer "told me that there was a fire in that area of the building, on the first floor, and I told him to contact the operations lieutenant," he said.
Maffeo says that these readings were not routine.		"No, we took the temperature readings because we knew we were heading to the cold weather," he says.
Spilke objects to its admission: "I'm not sure that I can offer it as a business record. He didn't take all of the readings himself."
"If they will refresh his recollection, that's fine," Torres says.		He's given the documents.		"These are temperature readings that we took throughout the institution," he says.
Torres: Could you record the temperature when the heating it is was not working?	Maffeo: On the 21st? I don't believe we did it on the 21st.		Torres presses on whether he did it after. The gov't offers a list of temperatures Maffeo recorded after that.
Maffeo: "They did bring in blankets, extra blankets, to the housing units."
Torres: When did you become aware of the problem?	A: I became aware of the problem on Jan. 21.		Spilke noticed that the problematic units had to be taken out and asks whether there was a contingency plan for heating cells.
Up next is John Maffeo, a facility manager at MDC.		Ezra Spilke asks him whether there was a problem with the heat recently at MDC.		"Correct," Maffeo says, estimating that it started a week or two before the fire.
The cross-ex and recross zipped by in a blur.		Barnwell's testimony ends.
Asked whether she remembers describing MDC as a "virtual icebox," Barnwell says "No."		Q: While the COs had access to hats and gloves and coats, did the inmates have access to extra materials?		Barnwell replies they had blankets but no extra materials.		Gov't cross-ex starts.
Q: Are there problems with leaks at the facility?	A: Yes.		Asked to elaborate, Barnwell says there's leaks "throughout the institution" and "massive floods."
The witness was quoted in the press as saying: "They're just waiting for a disaster to happen."		Asked about this remark, Barnwell stands by it: "Absolutely." 		"I'm thinking that if the media didn't come, we'd still be in the same situation," she added.
Torres: You say that the fire was on a Sunday. When was it that you say the media came?		Witness: I can't recall.
Questioning the witness is attorney Sarah Kunstler.		After Kunstler asked if the electricity issues put lives at risk in MDC, the government objected. Sustained.
Barnwell said that this created blind spots in the jail, which created the risk of inmate and staff assaults.
She said that she didn't notice whether the incarcerated people were having problems with the heat at that time.		An exchange about the lights-out:		Q: What kind of working conditions did that create for staff?	A: For me, it felt like it created a dangerous environment.
"They told the staff members to bundle up during that time," Barnwell testified.
"No heat, and we also had an electrical fire."		She says that MDC experienced "very cold temperatures" about "a week" before the fire.
Rhonda Barnwell, who has worked for more than a decade as a health information tech for medical records at MDC Brooklyn, is sworn in as a witness. 		"Over the past week, we've experienced some heat issues as well as we had no electricity."
Segura-Genao's attorney call first witness. Standby for spelling of her name and affiliation.
She notes that the Federal Defenders filed a civil lawsuit yesterday and that a judge issued a TRO.		"Today, after this hearing is over, I will be visiting MDC."
Judge Torres starts proceedings by describing the filings that she received. 		"Today, I will hear testimony from individuals who have experienced the conditions at MDC firsthand."
Assistant U.S. Attorney Karin Portlock speaks for the government.  		Ezra Spilke represents Mr. Segura-Genao, along with @GideonOliver and Sarah Kunstler.  		Segura-Genao entered.

As of Monday, the government dug into its denials that the power outage affected the heat and water.		"MDC informs us that the electrical outage did not cause the heat to go out, nor did it lead to a lack of hot water, because those systems were not affected by the power outage." https://t.co/Czt9EFjpZM
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ordered two MDC officials to testify today: June Bencebi and Anthony Sanon. 		She also allowed the defense to call witnesses about the conditions at MDC.
Later that day, Mr. Segura-Genao's attorney filed a follow-up letter informing the judge of other cases related to the MDC outages. Here's the story of Dino Sanchez, whose attorney's affidavit is included in the linked file. https://t.co/yopCbbHxib https://t.co/OsJHVY4ZEq

@JoeDelmonaco @BBuchman_CNS Quite often, prosecutors accuse defense attorneys of engaging in "greymail" - using secret info to get their client a litigation advantage. Defense attorneys accuse prosecutors right back of using national-security concerns to deny clients a fair trial. 		Delicate balance.
@JoeDelmonaco @BBuchman_CNS It's a common Catch-22 in national security-related cases: 		The defense often pushes for the disclosure for as much info as possible on fair trial grounds, and prosecutors try to limit the same info on national security grounds.
Why this is significant: 		The indictment alludes to two Turkish ministers, who took part in a meeting reportedly attended by Erdogan's son-in-law Berat Albayrak and Turkish foreign minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu.		My old thread on this: https://t.co/IciqRAk4Mv https://t.co/JR8TXzQ3OS

@nycsouthpaw True story: In my pre-reporting days, I wrote a sort of absurdist play - juvenilia really - inspired by "Mending Wall" and political events with an elf as a central character.		Of course, the line "Good fences make good neighbors" gets quoted the most, but the elf stuck with me.
This also makes sense because Veselnitskaya represented the entire Katsyv family, per this 2017 NYT article, which remains a useful backgrounder on her in general. 		https://t.co/KNJKMWbKjV https://t.co/U2VodijR8O
@jentaub Apparently, Manafort's own attorneys inadvertently disclosed it. Absolutely wild.
2019's off to quite a start. https://t.co/bLBxY7qJTv
Manafort accused by Mueller of sharing 2016 polling data with Russian linked to Moscow intelligence https://t.co/hNX4lcP2PO
@powersj_tx They can say anything they want, I suppose. 		The fact remains that the Russian attorney Don Jr., Kushner and Manafort met in Trump Tower in June 2016 has been indicted with federal crimes.		It also raises further questions about "adoptions."
If so, that would make the father of the owner of "Real Estate Company-1" Pyotr Katsyv, a former Russian transportation minister in the Moscow region. https://t.co/pqXxcYSckm
For those asking about "Real Estate Company-1": The indictment describes it as a defendant and claimant in the Prevezon case.		That leaves a flurry of shell companies for which the most likely candidate is Prevezon Holdings, owned by Veselnitskaya's client Katsyv.
The indictment charges that Veselnitskaya used fabricated evidence to try to pin the blame on "Investment Company-1," which appears to be a reference to Browder's Hermitage Capital.		Russia's campaign against Browder is well-known. Veselnitskaya participated in it. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/gsujFA0QWn
@edbott Considering Veselnitskaya is representing her client Katsyv, who owns Prevezon Holding and comes in a father-and-son team, that shell company appears to be a clear winner here.
@cjcmichel @edbott That's my thought too.
@edbott That appears to be the Occam's razor explanation here. 		Damn DOJ shielding non-parties convention masks the easiest explanation in a mountain of detective work.
@edbott Good theory. Another might be that they are simply referring to Prevezon Holding, owned by Katsyv, whose father is a Russian government official.
@edbott Yes, of course, I've reported that often. Just noting we don't know which shell company is "Real Estate Company-1" and who in particular is the beneficial owner.		It's a shame the case reached the last-minute deal that would have answered such a question.
@edbott Of course you're right. I scanned the doc way too quickly. 		This would have been an immediate tip-off: that she went on "to accuse, among others, personnel associated with Investment Company-1 of committing the Russian Treasury Fraud."		Deleting tweet.
@edbott Ah, so there are parties not listed as claimants on the case docket, which are listed as claimants on the settlement.		Narrows it down to the same thicket of shell companies in the company of a solitary oligarch. https://t.co/c5VgZbg8Pr
@edbott @Newfamilyguy @AdamBlickstein Ah, terrific. Thanks for the clarification.
@JohnSHausman Right, presumably those would be privileged, unless of course there was the old crime/fraud exception. We'll see.
@nycsouthpaw This is my longstanding favorite passage from the poem.
@JohnSHausman @BBuchman_CNS A thought: Presumably discovery had been ongoing up to the 11th hour settlement. That would seem to be the Occam's razor explanation on how they got the emails, and I don't necessarily know whether that discovery would tie to the Trump Tower meeting.		Wouldn't rule out, though.
Here is the passage in question clarifying how prosecutors had been reading emails. https://t.co/sEEgQAFi3T
This is a good point: 		Prosecutors allege that Veselnitskaya "exchanged numerous emails with the Prevezon Action Defendants' U.S. counsel" in the "immediate period" leading up to filing a motion, which was filed in 2017. https://t.co/xY1YpoQBST

@AClaudeCase Like civil forfeiture cases, which can still proceed.

Clarification: This standing order refers only to civil cases in which the government is a party in the Southern District of New York.

By the way, I am noting this not to endorse Flynn or the article's claim, but to note that Flynn stated this belief shortly before becoming a paid agent of the government he accused of this. The same government now benefiting from a $3.5B arms deal to be used in Syria.
This interview ran on January 2016.		Flynn started meeting with his now-indicted Turkish associates in late July 2016.
"We understood Isis‚Äôs long-term strategy and its campaign plans, and we also discussed the fact that Turkey was looking the other way when it came to the growth of the Islamic State inside Syria," Mike Flynn told Sy Hersh, before becoming a Turkish agent. https://t.co/otuAluy9YG

@lrozen Zarrab's now convicted of Iran sanctions busting. 		To be clear, I'm not saying that Kian was implicated in the Zarrab case. I'm explaining that the indictment alludes to the corruption probe implicating Zarrab as background to the Gulen-AKP preceding this media blitz.
@maddezmom Good question. Indictment's tantalizingly thin on this topic and utterly silent on Woolsey.
Remember: Bijan Kian had been a member of the Trump transition team, and Trump's Turkish ties have been largely eclipsed by the Russia probe.		From the Flynn case, it should be clear by now that the Russia investigation largely runs through Turkey.

Remember: Albayrak at the time was Turkey's minister of energy; his "direct boss" would have been Turkey's prime minister.		The "boss" - reis, in Turkish - is Erdogan's nickname from his supporters.
Extremely intriguing passage.		"I think im [sic] meeting [Turkish Minister #1]'s boss... not the direct boss but u know how," Alptekin told Kian on Aug. 26, 2016.		If TM#1 is Berat Albayrak, which seems highly likely, the "boss" would seem to be Erdogan. https://t.co/jakeHxdVCe

Zarrab's trial showed one high-ranking minister was bribed 45 to 50 million euros. Leaked tapes in Turkey showed Erdogan instructing his son to hide large amounts of cash.		In the indictment, this is a prelude for the Turkish government's PR blitz that brought in Flynn.
Background: Zarrab spearheaded a multibillion-dollar money laundering scheme to Iran that corrupted high-ranking leaders in Erdogan's ruling AK Party, allegedly including Erdogan and his family. 		Prosecutors explain here a major fissure in former Gulen-AKP alliance.
üö®üö® The "senior Turkish leader" in this passage appears to be Erdogan, who was prime minister when the corruption investigation came to a head in 2013. 		Erdogan called the probe an attempted "judicial coup" by Gulen, and here we have a connection to the case of Reza Zarrab. https://t.co/MbgxvzBIlT
The "Person A" described in this passage is Michael Flynn, quite thinly veiled.		(He's mentioned as the author of The Hill op-ed later in the indictment.) https://t.co/R64I3zwpWI

üö® The WSJ reported that the meeting to "whisk" Gulen took place on Sept. 19. 		Here is the passage on that meeting about Gulen. No reference to a kidnapping plot, at least in the charges, but this corroborates the meeting and its participants. https://t.co/SK1QMR383z

Just got off the phone with ex-SDNY prosecutor @HarrySandick - now a defense attorney - on the AMI non-prosecution agreement and other topics. 		His take on its significance: "It's kind of like the old @PreetBharara line: 'Stay tuned.'" 		https://t.co/DVvn0x2t8o
@OtisWilbury1 Presumably, after he gets out of prison, he does not hope to return there in a quite-public prosecution.
Risky move for Cohen's former attorney to float the possibility of testifying to Congress directly after being sentenced in part for lying to Congress -- and Cohen allegedly failing to tell SDNY prosecutors everything he knows.

Pauley allows for Cohen to voluntarily surrender by March 6, and the judge will recommend that Cohen serve his term in Otisville.
DEVELOPING STORY: Three year sentence for Michael Cohen. Much more to come soon. https://t.co/yHUwrfuKpp
* sentenced
BREAKING: Cohen is sentencing to 36 months of imprisonment.
Pauley: Cohen's cooperation "does not wipe the slate clean."		"This court ... believes a significant term of imprisonment" is justified, Pauley says.
"As a lawyer, Mr. Cohen should have known better," Pauley says, turning to the tax evasion, campaign finance, and false statement charges.
Pauley: "Our system of justice would be less robust without the use of cooperating agreements with law enforcement."
Pauley cites SCO's statement that Cohen cooperated on "core topics under investigation" and the information that he has provided was "relevant and useful."
Pauley describes Cohen's upbringing up to his employment by the Trump Organization.		"He thrived on his access to wealthy and powerful people, and he became one himself," he says.
"Each of these crimes standing alone warrant considerable punishment," Pauley said.
Pauley notes that Cohen admitted that he made the illicit hush-money payments "at the coordination with and the direction of Individual-1."
Quoting Oliver Wendall Holmes, Pauley said of the tax-evasion charges: "Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society."
Pauley talks about the "smorgasboard" of crimes involving "deception" and motivated by "personal greed and ambition."
Pauley speaks -- sentencing coming up soon. He reads the charges.
Tearing up, Cohen apologizes to the public: "You deserve to know the truth and lying to you was unjust."
"The president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world," mocks Cohen, he says, "calling me a rat."		He slams Trump for trying to influence proceeding that "implicate" him.
"I have chosen this unorthodox path because the sooner that I am sentenced," the sooner he can return to his family.		"I do not need a cooperation agreement in place to do the right thing."
Cohen describes "seeing the unbearable pain that my associations and my actions brought to my entire family."		"This is why I did not enter into a cooperation agreement."...
Hitting back at Trump's tweet calling him weak, Cohen agreed and added that his "weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump."
Cohen began his remarks by stating that: "Today is the day that I am getting my freedom back." ... "I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired."
Cohen: "I stand before your honor humbly and painfully aware that we are here for one reason."		"I take full responsibility for each act that I pleaded guilty to ...." including those implicating the "President of the United States of America."
Cohen stands up and brings his prepared speech to the podium.
Roos down, and Cohen is up next to address the court.
Roos: The unfairness here is not to Mr. Cohen here, but to the public.
Roos adds that Cohen's actions harmed the interests of "free and transparent elections, and in committing these crimes, Cohen has eroded faith in the electoral process."
Roos: "The charges portray a pattern of deception, of brazenness and of greed."		The campaign finance charges, Roos said, were particularly "serious because of the tremendous societal costs."
Roos hits back and says that Cohen "cannot have it both ways."		"To do so would send the wrong message," Roos says, the message being that "selective cooperation" would be rewarded.
"There's only so much we can say about the particulars at this time, given our ongoing investigation," Rhee said. 		Kept tight-lipped throughout her remarks. More on what she said soon. 		SDNY's Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos is now up.
Special Counsel's Office prosecutor Jeannie S. Rhee said that Cohen provided "credible" and "valuable information" regarding "any links between a campaign and a foreign government."	 "Mr. Cohen has sought to tell us the truth," Rhee said.
Petrillo steps down, and Special Counsel's Office prosecutor Jeannie S. Rhee is now up.
Petrillo lashed out at the Southern District, suggesting prosecutors are angry at playing second fiddle to Mueller. 	"Power to the Southern District," Petrillo said. "They want to build a bigger case than they've already made. God bless them."
On his client's treatment, Petrillo said: "Mr. Cohen had the misfortune to be counsel to the president."
Calling the SDNY memo unfair, Petrillo said, "I don't really understand the strident tone of the memo."
Petrillo denies that Cohen declined to answer questions from prosecutors and Congress.		"He is wary of a long-term cooperation agreement for personal reasons," asserting that Cohen wants to keep himself and his family from the "glare of the cameras."
Petrillo: "Life is tough and Michael Cohen accepts that. We accept that."		He claims that tax-evasions cases like Cohen's are "routinely treated in a non-criminal context."
Petrillo: "No bank has ever lost money dealing with Michael Cohen."		He repeats that line twice.
Petrillo calls Cohen a man who "does not engage in sharp business practices."
Petrillo pushes back against SDNY's "sharp memo."		"The crux of what we're saying is that he puts himself out to raise money for very worthwhile organizations."		"This is a man whose first instinct is to help."
Petrillo: "His action stands in profound contrast in the decisions of others not to cooperate, and allegedly to double-deal" while pretending to cooperate.
Petrillo calls the SCO's investigation as important as has been seen "since the days of Watergate."
Petrillo: He offered evidence against the most powerful person in our country. He did so not knowing what the results would be.		Or without knowing whether the probe would "survive," Petrillo said.
Petrillo said Cohen offered "his relevant knowledge" to the Special Counsel's office "knowing that he'd face a barrage of attack by the president."		"He knew that the president might shut down the investigation."
Defense attorney Guy Petrillo up now for Cohen.
Pauley calculates the guidelines at 51 to 63 months of imprisonment.		Reminder: The judge isn't bound by those guidelines, and can go either above or below.
Pauley also gives an enhancement for "sophisticated means" in his crimes, i.e. creating shell companies for the hush-money payments.
U.S. District Judge William Pauley starts by calculating the sentencing guideline ranges. 		Cohen argued that the tax evasion charges were "not closely related" to other charges, but Pauley finds in favor of the government that they are.
All rise!		We're beginning. AUSA Nicolas Roos introduces.		The Special Counsel's office and Cohen's attorney Guy Petrillo introduce themselves too.
Cohen's family is seated in the second row, and SDNY deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami is in front of them.		The SDNY sentencing memo was blistering toward Cohen. 		By comparison, Mueller's memo was good cop.
Attorneys from the Special Counsel's Office are now seated at the prosecution table.
Remember: Cohen's been prosecuted from both offices. The New York prosecutors filed the charges related to tax evasion, campaign finance, and lying to a financial institution.		Mueller's team prosecuted lying to Congress about the negotiations of the attempted Moscow tower deal.
My @CourthouseNews colleague @FRIED_ALIVE is also following this morning's sentencing hearing.		Cohen is seated at the defense table next to his attorney Guy Petrillo, but the prosecution table is currently empty. Prosecutors from SDNY and Mueller's office will be attending.
Michael Cohen is reported to have arrived.		Michael Avenatti is also said to be in attendance.

@snarwani I am stating a historical fact: Stalin used the phrase ‚Äúenemy of the people,‚Äù before Trump adopted it as a slogan.		Sanders and Corbyn have not.		Khrushchev specifically repudiated the phrase as toxic. You are apparently defending it.
@ChadMBriggs Hence my enduring discomfort with an admittedly brilliant play by a legendary playwright. The last production I saw of it, it sank in as a full-throated argument against democracy.
@ChadMBriggs Though Ibsen did coin it, his anti-hero was a misanthrope, and the play is fairly read as anti-democratic. 		Trump‚Äôs usage of the phrase seems much closer to Stalin‚Äôs than Ibsen‚Äôs. After all, the play‚Äôs poisoning of the water was not fake news.
The repetition of ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù desensitizes and erases history; reiterating that history makes it possible to re-sensitize what has been dulled.
The first line is the one that sparked raucous laughter at the U.N. General Assembly this year.		The last four words ‚Äî it can‚Äôt be emphasized enough ‚Äî is a slogan that traces back to Stalin. https://t.co/cpVEr7BRYV
@kurz_braten Thanks for letting me know. Fidan‚Äôs Senate briefing didn‚Äôt get much attention here. I‚Äôll look into it.
@ReflectingMan I should add: Whoever the source is, the information ultimately traces back to Turkish intel via the transcript.
@ReflectingMan True. My point is that the discrepancy suggests that it‚Äòs not the same mirror ‚Äî i.e. Turkish intelligence ‚Äî that‚Äôs doing the refracting.		CNN does not otherwise provide any clues as to the source of light.
According to CNN, the Saudis and Mutreb deny that call - said to be made to senior officials in Riyadh - was made.		Significantly: "The official did not address the transcript's characterization of the scene inside the Saudi consulate, nor Khashoggi's last words."
@LouiseMensch @leegiez * Calls said to be placed to senior officials in Riyadh by Mutreb.	* Saudis and Mutreb deny that a call was made. 	* "The official did not address the transcript's characterization of the scene inside the Saudi consulate, nor Khashoggi's last words."
@LouiseMensch @leegiez What you need to know from this transcript:		* Tracks the most gruesome reports from Turkish state media, including saws, screams and cutting, and listening to music with earphones to tune out the task.	* "Tell yours" quote in call most direct link to MBS.	(cont'd)
Either way, it‚Äôs gruesome and heartbreaking ‚Äî and the new details from the transcript bring it ever-closer to MBS.		The most chilling line isn‚Äôt in the headline. It‚Äôs: ‚ÄúTell yours, the thing is done. It‚Äôs done.‚Äù		Said by Mutreb, ID-d as a Saudi official working for MBS.
CNN does not describe the source in any way but does note that the transcript was prepared by Turkish intelligence services.

@tigerbeat @nytopinion Yup, I included that detail in my story.
@10Miles1 She's a defendant in the case, and she's represented by Epstein's attorney Scott Link. But the protective order in this Nov. 7 conference was by Maxwell's attorney.
Judge Netburn made clear that she's very unlikely to authorize sealing information that is relevant to a matter relevant to one of her rulings.		Any questions? Let me know.
The transcript of the Nov. 7 telephone conference in the Ransome case shows Maxwell's legal team aware of the fight, very concerned about media coverage and seeking as broad relief as possible.		They largely won the language that they wanted, with a big caveat from the judge.
In August, a federal judge rejected the Herald's request to unseal docs in the case of Virginia Giuffre, who's featured in the paper. The Herald's appealing that decision, which is linked and screenshot-ed here. 		https://t.co/Vos15u0vqM https://t.co/ZMCTbiWpnC
Quick points:		* The Ransome case was public before, but it wasn't cited in the Herald's expos√© today.	* The judge granted the requested confidentiality designation for "sexual activity or sexual conduct."	* She made clear she would hold parties violating it in contempt.

Shumate said that the fact that Ross deposition blocked means plaintiffs‚Äô can‚Äôt carry their burden on due process claim.
‚ÄúSec Ross does not live under a rock or in a vacuum,‚Äù Furman says.		Why should Furman not infer, he asks, that Ross wanted to implement the goals of the president?		The judge is pressing Shumate on whether Ross‚Äôs deposition needed to probe such issues.
Shumate is now up.		"There is no evidence that Secretary Ross acted for any discriminatory purpose," he said, claiming he acted at the DOJ's request. (Washington Post fact-checkers described this claim as false.) https://t.co/Zg5oG6pKnQ
The Constitution's enumeration clause mandates a count of all residents, not citizens, he notes.		Freedman cites evidence in the record reflecting the goal not to count immigrants, including a shared Wall Street Journal article, Kobach communications and other notes.
Furman asks whether discrimination against "immigrants generally - non-Americans - would give rise to an equal protection violation"?		Freedman replies that there could be "invidious discrimination" in violation of the 5th Amendment against immigrants.
Freedman noted that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach's statements are entered into the record.		Furman asks how those statements would prove animus against immigrant communities of color.
Furman turns to the due process claim, which will be fielded by ACLU's Freedman. He asks whether there's any evidence that connects Trump or any other member of the administration to the census change.		Trump statements did enter the record at trial.
Swiping at Wilbur Ross's claim to be taking a "hard look" at census alternatives, Colangelo says: "The record reflects literally no look at all."
Furman asks whether plaintiffs dispute whether DOJ could use citizenship data for Voting Rights Act litigation, whether or not it was a pretext. 		Colangelo replies that there's no evidence that they needed better CVAP (citizenship) data.
Colangelo says that Ross had an "inalterably closed mind" that was "unwilling or unable to rationally consider arguments.
In this hypothetical, the Democratic Secretary seeks a justification that would pass muster, but the post-hoc justification actually confers some benefits. 		Colangelo says this isn't that. 		"It has all the hallmarks of predetermination," he says, referring to this case.
Shumate argued that the judge should not second-guess Ross's decision but only determine whether he took information into account.		Back to Colangelo. 		Furman posits a hypothetical Secretary in a Democratic administration seeking to change census to benefit blue states.
Furman asks that if he finds that Ross's decision can't be justified on grounds of "cost, burden, accuracy, completeness," wouldn't that support a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.		"Is that not the definition of arbitrary and capricious?" he asks.
"On what dimensions, on what grounds, did he make that determination?" Furman presses.		Shumate said that Ross took all the information into "account."
"He doesn't have to choose the best option," Shumate says, but he just needs to choose a "reasoned explanation" for the option he chose.
Referring to the 30 percent more inaccurate response rate to citizenship question on the ACS, Furman asks: ""How can Secretary Ross say that is adequate performance?"		"He doesn‚Äôt; in fact, that helps our case," Shumate insists, saying that it shows Ross was "aware" of it.
For the DOJ, Shumate is back up and argues: "The Secretary is not bound by the guidelines and policies of the Census Bureau."		Furman prods Shumate on showing Ross going against the bureau's recommendations.
"There's an even more obvious flaw in this part of the Secretary's decision," Colangelo says. 		Ross "anchored" that decision that the Census Bureau would use the two years remaining to enhance  protocols and models, he says.		Colangelo ridicules this as the "magic wand theory."
One witness said: "Self-response is king."
Ross had "no empirical evidence" to contradict that of Dr. Abowd, the Census Bureau's own chief scientist who recommended against it, Colangelo said.		"Nobody disagrees that NRFU is worse," he said, abbreviating non-response follow-up operations.
Colangelo notes that the Census Bureau conducts a years-long process of testing the entire questionnaire.		"So there is a process for testing the entire questionnaire, which was not done with regard to the citizenship question," he adds.
The heart of the plaintiffs' APA claim is that Ross made the change in an "arbitrary and capricious" way.		Colangelo said that lack of testing goes against the advice of his own advisory committees.
@MoonsSunsStars I'm back. It got spectacularly into the weeds for awhile. The live-feed resumes.
Colangelo notes that Wilbur Ross said that the citizenship question had been ‚Äúwell tested.‚Äù		In fact: "The Abowd memo specifically points to evidences that the ACS citizenship question led to inaccurate results more than 30 percent of the time," Colangelo said.
The plaintiffs argue that Census Bureau didn't follow the OMB statistical policy directives.		Shumate argued that those aren't binding upon Wilbur Ross.		Colangelo said that they are binding on all agencies.		(It's getting in the weeds here.)
We're back and properly caffeinated. 		Colangelo is addressing the merits of the plaintiffs' Administrative Procedure Act claim.
Morning recess. Grab a coffee and see you back in a few.
Furman notes that his preliminary finding that Wilbur Ross showed bad faith is up for Supreme Court review. 		Shumate down; Colangelo back up.
Furman asks Shumate about evidence of Wilbur Ross's bad faith or pretext.		He wants to clarify whether DOJ's position is (a) the judge can't consider extra-record evidence of bad faith and pretext or (b) that there's insufficient evidence of it.		Shumate says it's the latter.
Shumate argues that any injuries resulting from the addition of the citizenship question results from people illegally not filling out the census.
"It seems undisputed that this will harm the accuracy of the data," Furman said, referring to Abowd's testimony.
"I don't think it accurately characterizes his testimony," Furman said, adding that he will refer back to the transcript.		Furman notes witnesses testified that NRFU *never* fully makes up for all self-response shortfalls.
Furman pointed out the discrepancy between Abowd's testimony about non-response follow-up operations (NRFU) - that it could fully mitigate problems - and Shumate's characterization of it - that it "will." 		"I'm pretty sure he didn't say that," Furman said.
Furman calls it "a little ironic" for the Census Bureau for not conducting randomized control tests and point to the absence of randomized control testing as a failure to demonstrate causation/harm.
The judge asks Shumate how that changes the calculus that there will be a "certainly impending" or "substantial" risk of harm.
Furman grills Shumate on the Clapper standard too. He notes that the Census Bureau works with "partner organizations."		"The defendants themselves seem to be relying on the fact that plaintiffs and organizations like the plaintiffs," Furman noted.
"How does that make any sense given the time sensitivities here?" Furman said.		Shumate said that he understands the concern about time sensitivity.
Shumate is now up for grilling by Furman, who asks him why he waited so long to raise a ripeness argument.		"You seem to have tried every thing you could to avoid a decision on the merits in this case," Furman tells Shumate.		But the ripeness argument is new.
"We have a history in this country of misusing census data," Freedman says, referring to Japanese internment during World War II.
Freedman notes that the civil rights groups suing here are already spending money and have sustained harm.		Furman pressing on issues likely to divide SCOTUS. 		(Clapper case was a 5-4 decision, with Alito writing majority opinion.)
Judge Furman quizzes Freedman about vaulting the hurdle posed by the Clapper v. Amnesty precedent, which found injuries by human rights organizations from warrantless surveillance to "speculative" for a right to sue. 		Background on that case.		https://t.co/eaLqtFD04N
For the ACLU, Arnold &amp; Porter attorney John Freedman tackles one DOJ argument: that non-response follow-up (NRFU) will mitigate problems of lower self-response rates.		One method described at trial is "imputation," but Freedman noted that Abowd conceded that tactic has problems.
DOJ has argued that the case isn't ripe until the plaintiffs try working it out administratively at the Office of Management Budget.		Furman asks Colangelo to respond to that arg.		Colangelo notes OMB has never rejected a census change + clock is ticking before surveys print.
‚ÄúIf Secretary Ross had prejudged the issue, why would he engage in all of this process?‚Äù Shumate asks.		His closing argument ends, and he steps down.		Judge Furman starts questioning the parties.
Shumate denies that Ross lied to Congress.		"It made perfect sense that the Commerce Department would reach out to DOJ," Shumate said.		"He didn't whitewash the record. He built one."
Shumate asserts that the plaintiffs failed to show Wilbur Ross's bad faith.		"To be sure, he thought that adding the question could be warranted," Shumate said. 		He claims a "policy preference" does not indicate "prejudgment."		"It shows he had an open mind," he said.
@Clancy_Dew Here you go. https://t.co/X9yxoLRE4k
Abowd is also the witness whom Colangelo noted choked up describing being kept out of the loop about the reason for the change. He testified that the citizenship question would decrease self-response rate. 		My write-up of his testimony earlier this month: https://t.co/aUq0k28hPg
That quote is misleading. Abowd testified that non-response follow-up operations *could* potentially cure fewer people self-reporting.
"Even if you assume there will be a drop in the self-response because of the citizenship question, Dr. Abowd has testified that non-response follow-up operations will cure" that problem, Shumate says.		John Abowd is the Census Bureau's chief scientist.
"There's historically been an undercount of Hispanics, even before the addition of a citizenship question to the census," Shumate says, calling it "speculative" to conclude that the revised census will chill participation.
"It was entirely reasonable for Secretary Ross to make a policy judgment that the benefits of adding a citizenship question outweighs the costs," Shumate says.		He turns to standing issues.
This could lead to communities being "marginalized and excluded for a decade." 		Colangelo finishes. 		Brett Shumate is up for the DOJ next.
Without an injunction, Colangelo says the census change will "impair core elements of our constitutional democracy."		"The outcome of this trial will affect every community in the county," he adds. "It affects representation in the Congress."
* Colangelo
Coangelo tells the judge there is "extensive, pervasive evidence of pretext" by the Commerce Department and Wilbur Ross.		"They in fact misled the public and Congress and the court," he adds.

Since my original thread on this topic, lots of folks have contributed research and context that contextualizes the emails. 		As the NYT's "Towers of Secrecy" investigation showed, NYC real estate transactions can be complex and murky. https://t.co/HOMnU66nvb
Again, it is unclear:		* where Turken received the flush of money.	* whether the purchases relate to the property hunt in the WikiLeaks emails.	* if it doesn't, on whose behalf Danismaz sought to purchase property.
@Kattsmee Not that I know of.
Public records show Turken buying and selling properties around this time. According to the records, Turken:		* bought a Brighton Beach, BK property in 2014 and sold it this year.		* bought properties on 762-766 Second Ave. and 302 East 41st St. in Manhattan in 2015. https://t.co/eMHL3YKQ43
That screenshot is from a profile on the charity from ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer.		https://t.co/mXG7zSJhFA		Again, this is the non-profit that is the successor to one on which Bilal Erdogan served as an administrator. Bilal is cc-d on the emails.
Testimony from Zarrab case showed that Bilal Erdogan was an administrator for an entity called Turgev, a predecessor of non-profit Turken Foundation.		In 2013, Turken had $0 in revenue + $1 in assets. The next year, it reported a more than $24 million contribution. h/t Propublica https://t.co/Mq1d3gIRs0
The next year, THO received a little more than $1.1 million from an unknown source, but still not enough for pricey Midtown real estate. 		https://t.co/fmRD26VVi2		This begs the question: For what person and/or entity was Danismaz seeking to buy property?

@WLynnPosey Two points:		* Filling out the census is mandated by federal law.		* A mass protest on the political left refusing to be counted could have the practical effect of reducing representation and funding to those constituencies.
There are two ways the government could win in the census case: rulings in its favor or beating out the clock.		Plaintiffs need to not only win, but to do it on time to matter.
Analysis: Census is supposed to go to print by June 2019.		It‚Äôs in the DOJ‚Äôs best interest to gum up the gears of justice to preempt a ruling blocking the government‚Äôs addition of a citizenship question before then - even with longshot motions resoundingly rejected last time.
@davidrlurie Surveys go to print June 2019. Looks like they‚Äôre trying to gum up the gears of justice as much as possible before then to run out the clock.
@TechMk_RGM Only two justices supported the government‚Äôs position last time: Gorsuch and Thomas. 		Kav wasn‚Äôt one of them.
Reminder: Only two of the nine justices - Gorsuch and Thomas - signed onto a dissent calling to block extra-record discovery in the case.		Even Kavanaugh didn't go that far. The majority's order limited the matter to temporarily blocking Wilbur Ross's deposition.
NEW: The government renewed its bid to stay the #2020Census case until the Supreme Court takes up the matter in February 2019.		Judge Furman witheringly shot down their last attempt.		Background: https://t.co/0l2Pe3wsDK		Also: https://t.co/rsMyLmlwCy https://t.co/VKIOwmlUAa

Part of Furman's order that jumps out at me with SCOTUS slating Wilbur Ross arguments on Feb. 19:		Furman says he "may" reopen trial record "in the event" that SCOTUS dissolves order blocking Ross's testimony "before the court issues a final decision."		May be moot by then.
@kpoulsen At present, only available at courthouse terminal. Not downloadable on the Pacer.
Prosecutors made this disclosure during a Nov. 2 arraignment on a superseding indictment with new charges added in light of the MCC incident.		The transcript hit the Schulte docket today.
Following the Schulte case closely, @emptywheel argues that it could provide an opening for an Assange charge that sidesteps 1A issues. https://t.co/CeO4YzWngT
"It is not simply an overlap of the same information," Karamaju said.
Prosecutor Karamaju emphasized the "CIA did not provide Mr. Schulte with additional information once he became detained."		But the info "that has been disclosed" since he landed at the MCC is additional information of what was produced by WikiLeaks" in Vault 7 &amp; 8 leaks.
Wrinkle in the case of accused WikiLeaker Joshua Schulte.		Last month, Schulte allegedly leaked more classified info using cell phones smuggled in federal prison. A newly public transcript states that those new leaks went beyond the "Vault 7" and "8" tranche of CIA files.
@rescdsk It's a good question. It could just mean Wilbur Ross successfully ran out the clock.

Lunch break:		Judge Furman says that he's "preliminarily inclined" to strike testimony that the Census Bureau will conduct randomized control testing + that the govt's failure to disclose it before now seems to have been a "blatant violation of the govt's discovery obligations."
Abowd said that the Census Bureau is trying to get an exception through Congress to hire non-citizen enumerators, or hire them as translators.
Abowd's testimony is that:		* he and the Census Bureau recommended against the citizenship question.	* adding it would be expensive and result in worse data.	* non-response follow up (NRFU) could mitigate it.
Despite testifying that the citizenship question will reduce self-reporting and data quality, Abowd that he doesn't have "credible quantitative evidence" that it will "increase the net-undercount."		This is why the plaintiffs called him as an adverse witness.
Furman interrupts the government's questioning on intricacies of Abowd's research.		"What's the point of this particular line of inquiry?" he asks, noting it's undisputed that citizenship question causes a decline in self-response rate.
Abowd testified there's "no consensus" at the Census Bureau that randomized control testing would finish on time before the surveys go out.
^ This is a key issue because the lack of testing was a key argument (among several others) that the Commerce Dept rushed the citizenship question without testing or process - the heart of the Administrative Procedure Act.
During the govt's examination, the Census Bureau's top scientist John Abowd claimed this morning that randomized control testing is planned for the citizenship question. 		ACLU's Dale Ho objected that it's an "ambush" + govt denied discovery on it.		Judge Furman postponed ruling.

Proceedings over for the day. Abowd‚Äôs testimony will continue well through tomorrow, with the plaintiffs‚Äô case (perhaps) wrapping up then.		I will have one story for both days of testimony and so perhaps no wrap-up today.		See you tomorrow.
They‚Äôre still talking up his credentials.		We get it.
Still on Abowd‚Äôs CV. 		Tl;dr, he‚Äôs impeccably credentialed.
One immediate observation: 		DOJ attorney‚Äôs tone is much friendlier than Ho‚Äôs, as Abowd is effectively an adverse witness - called by the plaintiffs and employed by a defendant.		Abowd‚Äôs testimony against the citizenship question notwithstanding.
Cross-examination by the government begins with Abowd talking about his CV.
@KARepublic @AlMonitor It‚Äôs almost as if the Turkish government‚Äôs piecemeal leaks about the Khashoggi probe to suit their geopolitical bargaining objectives fueled cynicism rather than advancing the causes of truth and justice.

Abowd agrees that fact ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù him.		Q: Among the senior executives at the Census Bureau, everyone you know was also surprised... [by that order of events].		Abowd agrees.
Ho plays another video from Gore‚Äôs deposition, again over DOJ‚Äôs overruled objection. 		‚ÄúMy understanding was those conversations were initiated by the Department of Commerce,‚Äù Gore said in the footage.		Abowd said he didn‚Äôt know that Commerce, not DOJ, initiated.
Abowd says that he was not aware about Sec Ross‚Äôs conversation with Kris Kobach, or communications relating to Steve Bannon.

‚ÄúThe most accurate data would come from modeling their citizenship status, that‚Äôs correct,‚Äù Abowd says, contrasting it to soliciting survey data.
Ho argues that using administrative records to ascertain citizenship data would be more accurate than using self-reported survey data.		Abowd agrees.
The Census Bureau believes that noncitizens give citizenship question answers that are inconsistent with the administrative records more than 30 percent of the time, Abowd testifies.
AG personally directed staff not to meet with the census bureau staff on how to obtain higher quality data.		Asked if this refusal is unusual, Abowd replies: ‚ÄúYes, it is.‚Äù
Ho asks to play a short selection of John Gore‚Äôs video deposition.		DOJ objects. Calls footage unnecessary.		Judge Furman overrules. It rolls.
Abowd agrees that Census Bureau found that using administrative records for CVAP data would be a better method and ‚Äúbest meet DOJ‚Äôs stated uses.‚Äù		He said he communicated that to Ross in February meeting.
Abowd testifies that the citizenship question also will lower the quality of the data.		Q: That‚Äôs a bad thing, right?	A: That‚Äôs something we try to avoid, yes.
Another cost will be increased communication campaign expenditures.
This is a ‚Äúlower-bound‚Äù estimate, Abowd says, because less self-reporting means more NRFU (non-response follow-up).
We‚Äôre back for the afternoon session of the #2020census trial.		Ho asks about whether adding citizenship question will increase costs of census.	Abowd says it will.		By $27.5 million, conservatively, he testifies.

Ho asks whether Hispanic focus group members said members of their community care about the census.		Abowd says they did.		Q: Members of this group would be more likely to self-respond if there were not a citizenship question on the census.	A: Yes.
Q: People who are afraid of deportation will be an extremely difficult group to count.	A: They would be a very difficult group to count yes.		Ho presses him on whether they'd be "extremely" difficult to count.
Ho reads a focus group report: "Participants in all locations asked about the citizenship question before the moderator asked about it."		They said that they are personally citizens, but they would not answer out of fear, he notes.
"Defending one's constitutional rights plays into Trump's hands" is one of the most pernicious popular hot-takes in circulation.

Noting that thee last time the census had a citizenship question was in 1950, Ho asks: "You agree that the macro environment is a little different now."		"Well, I'm not a macroeconomist," Abowd notes, before adding that he believes it is.
Ho asks whether the political climate around immigration could make the citizenship question affect the count.		A: Yes, it could.
Ho is now grilling Abowd about the lack of RCTs (randomized control testing).
Q: You believe that the Census Bureau did provide empirical support for its belief that adding a citizenship question to the census would reduce response rates.		A: Self-response rates. That's correct.
RT @mkraju: WH changes its explanation - no more mention of placing hands on an intern https://t.co/Doij1en327
Q: In your January memo to Secretary Ross, you concluded that adding a citizenship question would be a sensitive question for Hispanics.	Abowd agrees.		"Increased sensitivity is reflected through the 2017 data, yes," Abowd testified.

Ho notes that 5.8 estimate is based on responses to the ACS, but the question would be "more prominent" on the decennial census.		Abowd agrees.
"It's the best available point estimate in the decline in self-response," Abowd says.		It's as good as the analysis that led up to it can be.
Q: The 5.8 estimate. That's a conservative estimate, right?		Abowd responds that "conservative" is hard for a statistician to define, but with that caveat, yes.
Asked about the math of that, Abowd said: ""That's more than a million people, yes."
Abowd: "The best estimate we have is 5.8 percentage points," on the differential of adding the citizenship question.		The breakdown:		* 9.8% of households contain non-citizens	* 5.1% estimated lower self-response	* Affecting 630,000 households
"I support the conclusion that there would be a lower self-response rate and the consequences of that self-response rate, yes," Census Bureau chief scientist John Abowd, on the effects of the citizenship question.
Abowd agrees that his memo advised against "Alternative B" (i.e. the citizenship question) as "very costly" and "harms the quality of the census counts."
Q: "Let's be clear: Secretary Ross had only one meeting the chief scientist of the Census Bureau" before adding the citizenship question.		Abowd agrees.
Q: You agree with the conclusions in this memo, isn't that right, Dr. Abowd?	A: Yes, I do. 		It as routed to the Secretary of Commerce, and Abowd had a meeting with Ross about it.
Q: The memo that you wrote to Sec. Ross, in your opinion, that memo memorialized that ... could be expected to lower the self-response right among households that include non-citizens.	A: Yes, that's correct.		Abowd agrees that's a "large population."
Ho notes that "as the chief scientist of the census bureau," Abowd and other census bureau leadership have consistently recommended against a citizenship question. 		"Correct," Abowd answers multiple variations of this question.
The @ACLU's Dale Ho questions him by going over his CV, moving onto Ross's decision memo.		Ho notes that Ross said the citizenship question was necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.		Abowd notes that's true that Ross said that.

Forgive the lengthy aside: It seems that Census 101 falls by the wayside and the basic facts tend to be assumed rather than explained in the reporting, and I wanted to clarify what this case is and isn't about.		Lunch break. Will return to witness testimony in an hour.
Regardless on your views on immigration, for example, everyone presumably wants the government to accurately be able to create epidemiological maps. 		This is one reason why the census shouldn't be politicized, the central accusation in this case.
This is why the citizenship question challengers allege that the Commerce Dept and Wilbur Ross created a pretext of Voting Rights Act enforcement to change the survey. 		This may be widely known by my readers, but it's often assumed to be known than stated outright in reporting.
Basic census facts: 		* The Constitution mandates counting of all residents, not citizens.	* Not even the govt alleges noncitizens shouldn't be counted.	* It affects apportionment of political power and funding, but also basic govt functions and social services.
@Stuccorepair2 Correct, and fund social services, to draw epidemiological maps of disease, distribute Yellow Pages, etc.		It's about political power, but also about the basic functioning of govt.
In our era, bureaucratic red tape gets a bad rap, but it's what stops politicians - for example - from cynically ordering a sea change in policy for their own private gain.		That's the central allegation at the heart of this lawsuit
An in-the-weeds aside: 		One of the lawsuit's allegations is the Commerce Dept. instituted the citizenship q- in a way that violates the Administrative Procedures Act, which protects against "arbitrary + capricious" govt actions.		Essentially, a defense of bureaucratic red tape.
(Comment: This is what I mean by Salvo's testimony showing the best of what is often pejoratively labeled bureaucracy: expertise, community engagement and labor that meaningfully improves people's lives through mundane, unsung and vital functioning of government.)
Again and again during Salvo's testimony, he has spoken of his "fear" of what a bad count would mean for city services, including health care, education and even the distribution of Yellow Pages. His emotion comes across as wholly sincere. 		He is animated on the witness stand.
Here's where the citizenship question comes in: Enumerators build trust with the people directly over up to six visits.		"We are the City of New York," Salvo said. "We've got your back. We're goign to help you stand up for who you are."
Another problem, Salvo says: There is a greater reliance on using landlords as a proxy, and they are more likely to undercount to disguise "overoccupied situations" or "building code" issues.
Salvo and a co-author critiqued this in a study titled "Misclassifying New York's Hidden Units as Vacant"in the peer-reviewed publication "Population," displayed in court. 		If you're a New Yorker viewing the map, the image is all the more striking. https://t.co/8hLN90xQXL
Example: Salvo noted that the 46% increase in vacant housing reported by the 2010 census included Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Astoria and others.		"These are not neighborhoods that are experiencing any sort of abandonment," he noted. 		"This reeks of a bad map."
Here's why Salvo says the focus on admin records rather than people threatens the count:		"It's on the ground. You've gotta go, and you gotta look," Salvo said in a New York twang. "We go full-tilt."		Salvo's taken the court on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood tour.
2) In the past, Census Bureau sought waivers to hire noncitizens as "enumerators" - the workers who follow-up on nonresponsive households - because they have language and cultural skills. 		As @HansiLoWang notes here, WaPo reported a ban on that practice. https://t.co/ahI7pmN76E
Underreported facts: 		1) On top of the citizenship question, Census Bureau budget cuts provoked an increasing reliance on administrative records to learn whether units are vacant. 		In Los Angeles and Harris County, TX, Salvo said, 20% of units marked vacant actually occupied.
The Health Department had Salvo adjust the numbers to provide disease estimates, he said. 		"We had to on our own adjust the data," he said.		He also gave a granular look on outreach efforts known as NRFU (non-response follow-up operations), and why this leads to underestimates.
Giving practical examples of city services an undercount would compromise in NYC, Salvo pointed to:		* Language services	* Health Department (e.g. charting disease outbreak)		The 2010 census showed a huge spike in vacant units in Astoria and south Brooklyn. Ridiculous, he noted.
Salvo said that he agreed with Census Bureau's chief scientist on the major point. 		"The citizenship question is likely to compromise self-response. I think that is pretty much agreed upon by all parties."		The response will be "manufactured" to "compromise accuracy," he says.
The picture of a guy who - with the caveat that cross-examination has not yet begun - gives bureaucracy a good name.		Now for his testimony.
Salvo's worked on four decennial census surveys and served on the National Academy of Science's Committee of National Statistics (CN-Stat). 		A model public servant, Salvo speaks passionately about data-collection, conversant in government acronyms, but always human.
After voting early this morning, I've been sitting in court listening to testimony by NYC's chief demographer Joe Salvo - giving a granular overview about how city governments use census data and assist in its collection. 		Some thoughts on that (ongoing) testimony.

DOJ pressed Hillygus on cross on the fact that her data sources weren't citizenship question-specific. Hillygus kept agreeing that was true, but noted that this was the result of the Census Bureau foregoing random control testing.
@KARepublic Vaguely. Covering the census case live and need a moment to digest the Zarrab update. Will catch up with this soon.
The DOJ asks her whether she can rule out that they might still conduct RCT (randomized control testing) before the surveys go out. 		Acknowledging she can't know, she adds: "I don't know if that's still feasible to conduct that before the 2020."
The DOJ attorney adds that Hillygus also said: "I want to say in no uncertain terms that this is an absolutely awful decision."		She confirms that she did say that.
DOJ attorney says that Hillygus gave a presentation reacting to the citizenship question on March 19, 2018.		Hillygus' response: "WTH."		Asking if that communicated "What the hell," Hillygus said it communicated: "My shock, yes."

She adds the question increases the risk of "accidental or deliberate disclosure."
Testimony turns to the integrity of the data - referring to the security of the information.		"I would argue that a citizenship question has an impact on the integrity of the data," Hillygus says. "Data breaches happen."
The witness describes the chain of events like this:		* Fewer people self-responding.	* Increase in NRFU	* Increase in proxy respondents	* Increase in imputations		All of which she says reduces accuracy.
Hillygus: "The Census Bureau completely agrees that the addition of the citizenship question is going to reduce the accuracy of the data."

Reading through her report, I'm correcting one of my acronyms. 		Non-Response Follow-Up operations are known as NRFU, not NRFUO.
Hillygus's expert report, via @HansiLoWang https://t.co/tIhfQZTwBI
Furman asks Hillygus whether the imputation procedures are publicly available.		Hillygus responds that they are not.
Hillygus: The count imputation is contributing to the total population count. 		Earlier, she defined imputation procedures as "a guess to fill in the numbers," and that these will undercount Hispanic and non-citizen households.
These include "proxy responses," from neighbors as opposed to self-responses.		‚ÄúFor noncitizen households and hispanics, proxy households are probably underestimating respondent size," Hillygus testifies.
"This is going to be occurring during a presidential election," Hillygus says, referring to the follow-up operations to the survey. 		"The potential for this to be politicized" complicates NRFUO even futher, she adds.
Referring again to "non-response follow-up operations," Hillygus says that history shows that these will not make up for undercount if citizenship question added. 		"NRFUO did not eliminate undercount in the past. This is an empirical pattern that we have seen in the past."
Hillygus: "I think it would be incredibly difficult for this outreach campaign to be successful" from respondents not participating in census over citizenship question.		She says that the "fragmented media environment" makes it more difficult today to get a message out.
We're back.		Hillygus are testifying about the Census Bureau's outreach campaign and NRFUO (non-response follow-up operations).
10 minute recess.
After Hillygus says the citizenship question "sticks out like a sore thumb," Freedman introduces the printed ACS (American Community Survey) form into the record.
Referring to Abowd's research on the negative impact of the question, Hillygus says: "There are reasons that I think this is too conservative an estimate."		She emphasizes that this is Census Bureau research itself predicting depressed counts.
Furman asks whether this would lead to an undercount.		Hillygus replies this would lead to "lower-quality data" for those households.
Freedman turns to analysis by John Abowd, the associate director of research and methodology and chief scientist at the Census Bureau. 		Hispanics were 9x more likely from non-Hispanic whites to break off from the survey at the point of the citizenship question, Hillygus says.
Hillygus says that it offers "direct evidence" of what could be expected, and that the citizenship question could pose a "major barrier" to participation.
The study is called Census Barriers Attitudes and Motivators Survey (CBAM).		Hillygus: What‚Äôs so significant about this is post-the addition of the citizenship question, this offers one of the only attempts by the Census Bureau to evaluate the impact of the citizenship question.
Freedman describes a focus groups finding that Hispanic respondents were "highly suspicious" about how data will be used against them and their families - regardless of citizenship status.
Questioning the witness is Arnold &amp; Porter attorney John A. Freedman, who is introducing various exhibits into evidence now.
The same is true for SNAP and the nutrition program WIC (Women, Infants, and Children), she says.
The witness also cites "empirical research showing that even people who are not eligible for deportation are failing to use food stamps or ACA," using the shorthand for the Affordable Care Act.
Hillygus cites public opinion polls, including by Pew, suggesting that Hispanics - regardless of citizenship status - have feared that they or their families will be deported.
Asked about whether the citizenship question qualifies as a "sensitive question," Hillygus replies: "The census bureau itself designates it as a sensitive question."		She adds there is "empirical evidence" that both non-citizens and Hispanics will be affected.
Asked about the language of Wilbur Ross's memo claiming the citizenship question poses "no additional imposition" on the survey taker, Hillygus says the statement "contradicts the scientific methodology research" on the issue.
Hillygus differentiates "privacy" and "confidentiality."		"Privacy is like 'don't ask'; confidentiality is like 'don't tell,'" she says.
"When you have a sensitive item, people may be less likely to answer truthfully," she notes.
Hillygus describes a category of survey methodology called ‚Äúburden of the survey.‚Äù		"That is the effort that is being asked of the respondent to fill it out," she says, describing such factors as "length," "complexity," "intrusiveness," and "sensitivity of what is being asked."
Asked about an overcount, Hillygus gives an example of college students and people with vacation homes being double-counted.		She says there historically has been an undercount of minority populations.
Hillygus: "With a very first census, George Washington said: 'We have a census number, but we think there's an undercount.'"
Hillygus said earlier there's "considerable evidence" that the decision to add the citizenship questions:		* will depress counts.	* was executed in a way against census guidelines.		Now explaining how census works. More on those conclusions later.
Asked why she chose to testify, Hillygus says she "has a foot" in the various issues involved in the census case.		"The purpose of my testimony is to evaluate the likely impact of a citizenship question on Hispanic and non-citizen households," she says.		Also evaluating Ross...
She says that she published dozens of academic articles and an upcoming book with Princeton University Press and testified in a VRA case in North Carolina.		"We have an election tomorrow. I'm a political scientist."
Hillygus: "I served for six years on the scientific advisory committee for the Census Bureau."		She also wrote a book called "The Hard Count."

Barring that, trial will start on Monday at 9:30 am, and the coverage will be much more eventful than today's hearing. 		No story today, but I'll keep you posted on any important developments.
The wild card here, as always, is SCOTUS, which has not yet ruled on the DOJ's motion to stay the trial. 		The plaintiffs have not yet filed a motion opposing a stay, but the NYAG announced they intend to do that.
The remainder of the hearing involve last-minute pretrial preparations, sorting out whether testimony via affidavit would be allowed; which witnesses would be called for what purpose, by whom and when; and what evidence is admissible for what purpose.
Back from the final pretrial hearing:		Citing public interest, the NYAG wants to play the videotaped deposition of assistant AG John Gore at trial, but Judge Furman shot that down - stating that he could watch it privately.		If he does, Furman said, the footage would be public.

Guterres' references to Charleston and HIAS are pointed but restrained. The second half of the speech appears to by diplomacy-by-subtweet.
What Guterres does not mention is that the shooter's paranoid theory about HIAS echoed the "racist hoax" propagated by Trump and top GOP officials on the caravan, as @AdamSerwer noted in The Atlantic. https://t.co/nQ7JmwFkP5
In the second half of that passage, Guterres lauds @HIASrefugees - the object of the domestic terrorist's paranoia and hatred - as the "most fantastic humanitarian organization I have ever met."		High praise from the secretary-general of the world's leading international body.
Whether these ideas have done so already, and through what conduit, Guterres diplomatically refrains from saying.
The first half of this passage warns about the "roots of neo-Nazism growing," referring the white supremacist gangs in Charlottesville chanting "blood and soil."		Guterres notes their goal is to "penetrate the mainstream" so that their "idiot ideas" become the "new normal."

With Bolsonaro being widely described in the press as a ‚Äúpopulist,‚Äù I sincerely would like to hear news organizations explain the rationale for not using the word ‚Äúfascist‚Äù for someone who explicitly and repeatedly lauds the violence of a military dictatorship.
