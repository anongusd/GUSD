@BarackObama.    I got involved with this campaign to put you into retirement.  Your a big time socialist not what America is about.  See ya
@BarackObama Obama does his best work with a stroke of a pen when no one is looking. (Welfare qualifications )  are you serious what a joke
Why did DNC chairwoman Debbie W Schultz invest her money in other countries.  I guess Obama's supportrrs shouldn't throw stones. Wow!
Obama's US Attorney General Eric Holder appears to be putting down African Americans and Hispanics  saying they can't get an ID.  Wow
Obama stop playing politics.  You know raising taxes on anyone now is not wise.  Be a leader and put politics aside.
Obama keep on trying to take attention from the real issues the economy, healthcare tax most Americans don't want.  Put Obama in retirement
Obama says a trillion dollars has to come from somewhere. I'm afraid 4 more years of Obama where its going to come from.  Obama Tax master.
Obama,37 million dollars to run the white house not to include vacations limousines ect.  Obama's administration is big on spending our $.
Unfortunately Obama your Congress is holding up jobs stop throwing the bull.  Tell Reid and Pelosi stop playing your politics.
Page 50 section 152 healthcare tax pays for illegal aliens in US.  Pelosi got sign it to see what's in it.  America is smarter than that.
Obama wants us to work harder for those who don't.  No thanks Obama we don't want to pay for your give away plans.  Get informed America!
Obama's not a job maker he's a taxmaker I can't wait till November.  Let's go people change the direction of America before Obama does. USA
Obamatax new healthplan Obamatax..  Were suppose to say thanks.  Thanks for our new tax.  OBAMATAX HEALTHCARE.
Obama is a taxmaker remember your new tax in November.
Obama has turned into a great politician. Hope and change yeah right!
Obama's plan doesn't include the American people his last 3 yrs show that.  Almost 60% of Americans did not want this healthcare tax ha ha!
Nancy Pelosi said you have to sign the healthcare bill before you know what's in it.  Surprise no we know I wonder what's next.
Obama says its not a tax its a penalty or a mandate.  Wow fool me once!!
I don't believe a word this president says good luck to all who do your going to need it.
Regular Americans are the special interest that are going to retire Obama to a more suitable position.  Maybe talk show host.
Its a tax people. Great bumper sticker :-)
Obama should be running for president in the Soviet union his plans might work great there.  November 2012 Obama should be available for it.
Thanks Mr Obama just what we need another tax.  I find this country going the wrong way since you came aboard.  Get informed people.
Is it true Mr and Mrs Obama both surrendered their license to practice law. If so why?
Its probably another taxpayer funded program no thanks.  How about forgetting the dinner and concentrate on something more important. Jobs!
We want to stand far away from you.  Our veterans God rest their souls are turning in their graves.  I hope you were right on one term.
Why?
Americans are not that stupid!  Current president blowing hot air.
Obama would make a great talk show host let's help him with that this November election.
We need a leader for president not a socialist!
I wonder what else will evolve in a Obama second term?  Wake up United States of America!
http://t.co/tNFtu8gt.  Interesting.
Don't like the Obama vision we've seen almost 4 years of it.  He moved forward with programs when large% said no.  4 more yrs no thanks.
Don't need a college education to realize Obama policies are not working!
Congressman Alan West for VP what do you think?
Yes register to vote for change vote for Romney :-)
I'd rather eat at taco bell then Clooney' s with Obama.
We are afraid to move forward with Obama.  He has shown he has his own plan, a plan we don't want.  Remember in Nov save America from Obama
We don't want the Obama America.  We need to take it back from a failed presidency.
The president while campaigning stated to someone don't complain about gas prices if you want to drive a large Suv. America land of free?
@gretawire The Obama use of attack on women voters is just another reminder of a failed presidency.  America wake up before its to late.
@bigpatriot
@bigpatriot Let us reflect upon the misery and missed fortunes of the last two years and come to our senses and do what's right in 2012.
Thankfully we have a news station like fox that can put out the truth about what is really going in the world.  Thank you fox news.
