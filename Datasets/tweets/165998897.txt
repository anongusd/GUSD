@scottwjohnson I can't get into this anymore. I hope you'll update your story.
@scottwjohnson The 2nd one was on Drudge all day yesterday and got a lot of attention. People from both sides of the argument told me it was fair.
@scottwjohnson The 2nd story took a broader look, pulled it all together. It quoted a lot of people, including a WH official and 2 who agree with you.
@scottwjohnson Scott, this is very odd to me. People at an event saw things differently. Your problem is with them, not me.
@scottwjohnson your problem is that a few people there viewed it differently than you. They told me about it and i wrote it.
@scottwjohnson the story ran at 6am and was updated twice, with new info on scif and from  fredericks. I sought out new info and updated.
@scottwjohnson "you are not working hard enough if" you dont reach out to the person you are writing about. I did. You didnt
@scottwjohnson "Easley has yet to quote any guest commenting positively about the event." False
@scottwjohnson please correct your story. A few people were frustrated. Others loved the event. I reached out to the WH for both.
@scottwjohnson my 'complaint' is rhat you are wrong. Fredericks is quoted about the event in the first piece and more broadly in the second
