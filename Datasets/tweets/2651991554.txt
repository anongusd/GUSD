@IDontEvenKnow42 Ah, I see.
@IDontEvenKnow42 Yeah, that's true sadly.. but did they ever overload the schedule to the case of restoring #NetNeutrality before? If not, I say this 4 months has to hurry just in case the telecoms does do something else stupid.
@IDontEvenKnow42 And it sounds like we're going to restore #NetNeutrality without a doubt in the next 4 more months!
@IDontEvenKnow42 Yo, I don't know how true it is but check this out. One of my friends send me this link and told me that we'll be able to Restore #NetNeutrality by February 1st in 2019		https://t.co/Jcz5gBxeXO
@GhostUnderLight I'm good, I'm sorry I was busy. But what yourself?
@crvrh @fightfortheftr @AjitPaiFCC is because you're thinking the wrong way, dude. and I think you don't want to understand or you're just trolling just to get me mad. We'll be just complaining each other till #NetNeutrality is saved February 1st. so whatever. later.
@crvrh @fightfortheftr @AjitPaiFCC Okay, now that starting to sound like a troll, dude, I'm sorry. But killing the #NetNeutrality IS illegal itself. From what he's doing IS obviously illegal and #NetNeutrality has nothing to do with this, period.
@crvrh @fightfortheftr @AjitPaiFCC True, but that's how long he has till he retires. But if Pai keep being this stupid like he is now, He's going to ending up losing his job the sooner than you think.
@crvrh @fightfortheftr @AjitPaiFCC I seriously doubt it 'cause everyone is saying that Pai could lose his job just by doing this period. &amp; is not just Trump. &amp; it wouldn't make sense 'cause Trump, Pai, &amp; everyone else from Fcc including Kava himself. They're both in danger by the FBI, &amp; CIA.
