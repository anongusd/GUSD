Does Pelosi really believe that Rep. Omar‚Äôs statements are anti-Semitic? This weekend she blithely promoted their shared cover on @RollingStone while Omar was doubling down that supporters of Israel ‚Äúpush for allegiance to a foreign country.‚Äù	https://t.co/zc0F8V0yr6
Today, I am pleased to share that I am a cosponsor of H.Res. 39, legislation that would designate March 2, 2019, as ‚ÄúGold Star Families Remembrance Day.‚Äù These families sacrifice an incredible amount for our freedom, and I am glad for the opportunity to honor them.

Deceptive "Medicare for All" is latest effort to socialize health care. It forces all Americans, including seniors on Medicare, into a one-size fits all plan, outlawing virtually all private health care coverage, including employer-sponsored insurance which 158M American enjoy.

Today I voted against H.R. 8, which fails to focus on gun violence &amp; criminals who buy guns. Instead, it punishes law abiding gun owners by making it more difficult  to purchase guns, despite the constitutional right to do so. H.R. 8=politically motivated &amp; disingenuous, at best.

(2/2) Not only would GND destroy American economy and bankrupt us, it would (according to an EPA climate model) avert 0.137 degrees Celsius of projected warming by year 2100 ‚Üí  barely even measurable. The #GreenNewDeal is liberal extremism on steroids. https://t.co/vU65GUmMhl
(1/2) Report suggests #GreenNewDeal could cost 93 TRILLION! A household would have to pay $36,100-65,300 annually to meet the cost. Don‚Äôt forget: this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù would also ban air travel and aim to reconfigure every building in the United States. https://t.co/A8Ou3s8yK5

(2/2) Among other things, #GreenNewDeal wants to end air travel and "upgrade" every building in the U.S. The radical left continues to focus on its extreme agenda, once again ignoring the life and death problems America faces (like illegal drugs pouring over border). #NoDeal
(1/2) You can‚Äôt make this up. #GreenNewDeal should be called the Green New STEAL ‚Üí a socialist manifesto that proposes we steal dollars and jobs from hardworking Americans to reward those who are ‚Äúunwilling to work.‚Äù
(2/2) Sex trafficking crimes are a growing epidemic in America that must be dealt with swiftly. Law enforcement needs the necessary tools to protect our families and children, and this bill helps address the problem.
(1/2) Today I introduced H.R. 1110, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill would help law enforcement agencies fight sex trafficking demand by giving them access to federal grants through the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program.

On @POTUS's speech last night, I agree: open borders have caused lives of loved ones to be stolen, women &amp; children to be victimized by traffickers, &amp; drugs to be leaked into MO communities. Submitting to the status quo is hurting our American way of life &amp; it can't continue.
Privileged to hear from @vp about the humanitarian and border security crisis &amp; why we need to address both ASAP. @POTUS is negotiating in good faith. It‚Äôs time for the democrats to do the same. #ProtectOurFamilies. #StopDrugs https://t.co/Fm9itL4mC0

(2/2) I encourage Democrats to support legislation that funds our government &amp; prioritizes our security by increasing funding to protect our border, stops flow of deadly drugs into our communities, &amp; stems tide of illegal immigration. I stand by, ready to support such a measure.
(1/2) On December 20 I voted for a CR to fund entire govt through February 7, that included much needed border security funding for @DHSgov while also funding other select federal agencies. Unfortunately, the Senate did not reach the required sixty votes necessary to approve it.
Pleased to support the First Step Act that @POTUS just signed into law ‚Üí this bill works to reduce recidivism and give certain non-violent prisoners a second chance when they reenter society. Great step in the right direction.
