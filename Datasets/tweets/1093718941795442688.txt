Excuse me, what the fuck! https://t.co/JNaaUsr1b9
@NPR This is so wrong! Northam has shown that he has no ability to lead his people and the fact that he won't resign is a sham.
@EthanPetersen20 Okay.
@NPR Weird! People are not vaccinated for a disease are the majority of people getting the disease!?!?! Who would have ever thought of that?
@EthanPetersen20 And college sports also treat their student atheletes horribly. They don't get paid, they are verbally and physically abused, they are in constant fear of losing their scholarship if they become useless to the team, and they don't get to take advantage of the education.
@Reuters Good. Take this piece of human filth away from us.
@EthanPetersen20 Paying coaches millioins of dollars, building stadiums, and extravagant game day experiences are all for the fans. Along with poor management at the top, there is also a belief that who have to spend all this money for fans to continue watching.
@EthanPetersen20 But they don't really build diversity at schools as they really are benefiting mostly white kids. https://t.co/9gc80JbJAu
@EthanPetersen20 The existence of these large stadiums and whatnot are too appeal to football fanatics, not to make money for schools. They aren't going to be run well because then you can't have all the extravagance that football fans apparently want.
@EthanPetersen20 "You've got 125 of these programs. Out of 125, 22 of them were cash flow even or cash flow positive."	https://t.co/cJD5GLCfpv

@EthanPetersen20 Actually, athletics departments are a complete failure for schools with most, except for top 20, taking money from students and academics. Citations will be given in a bit.
@NPR I love NPR using the word doggo so casually.
@SFGate X for doubt.
@SFGate Anti-vax parents are putting the rest of our children at risk because of an unsubstantiated claim from decades ago that has been repeatedly debunked. Crazy!
That and the &gt;$40000 price tag.
The admission of students based solely on athletics is one of the largest injustices in the American college system today. Very unfair!
@TitaniaMcGrath Great activist of our generation. Indeed a genius.
@SeinfeldTV Mr. Peterman. Let's go!!!
@RepHaleyStevens @fightfor15 But unfortunately more people will also have to live with no job at all. Companies will replace workers without a second thought.
@politico The lt. gov must be investigated. Allegations are too serious to ignore.
@Hoboken1111 @politico For sure. This whole wall business is wacko. I'm saying that the President is the partisan and needs to stop thinking that this is an "us against them" situation. If you don't get your way in the political process, your response should not be to throw a tantrum.
@politico Shutdowns are going to be a common occurrence if partisan politics are not thrown out the window very soon. This environment where no one will budge is incredibly destructive.
@ABC The response to climate change must be our generation's space race, where we compete with other countries to become the most sustainable. We must put significant resources to ensure that there exists an America for our children.
@ABC The rapid increase in the frequency of devastating fires in California is a result of climate change and the government must act immediately.
@CNN Extremely ugly and overpriced garbage. Arguably, they made the thing offensive on purpose as an attempt at outrage marketing. How can you not notice how offensive this is going to be?
And out of the Virginia executive branch. https://t.co/kDI3utz9dU
@seanmdav The governor should resign immediately. I doubt any of his African American constituents have any faith in him after this fiasco. Absolute disgrace!
