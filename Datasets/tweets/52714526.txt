There are more than 600 million net tons of excess steel capacity in the world according to the OECD.  The Section 232 trade remedy is critical to ensuring steel remains a vital asset for our national and economic security. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
It is vital to our economic and homeland security that the United States does not become dependent on offshore steel suppliers #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
The share of the U.S. market taken by finished steel imports has fallen from 29 percent in April to 21 percent in November. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
China is producing steel at record levels -- exceeding one billion net tons in 2018. This means there is plenty of excess supply that will flood into our market but for the continuation of the Section 232 tariffs.  #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Global steel overcapacity, a large share of it in China, has led to high levels of dumped and subsidized imports in the U.S. market, causing severe economic harm and significant job losses. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Capacity utilization has gone up to over 81 percent for the week ended 2/2/19. #AmericaSteelStrong ⁦@POTUS⁩ ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩
AISI Says Steel Tariffs are Working - https://t.co/F95DHkRf9R #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Conditions in the U.S steel industry have improved as a result of the Administration’s actions on trade, deregulation and tax reform, as well as a more favorable economic environment. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #AmericaSteelStrong
Shipments of steel mill products from domestic mills were 4.7 percent higher in the first eleven months of 2018 than in the first eleven months of 2017. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Our national security depends on steel for critical infrastructure including transportation, energy, health and public safety. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
China’s record steel production, likely exceeding one billion net tons in 2018, and its high level of steel exports continue to destabilize the global industry and threaten American steelmakers. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
If foreign unfair trade practices are not addressed, steel consumers will become reliant on foreign sources of steel and steel consuming industries will no longer have local suppliers who can provide “just in time” delivery of product. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
The Section 232 trade remedy  will help ensure steel producers remain at the forefront in developing the most advanced steel products #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

In 2018, manufacturing sector industrial production growth was at its highest since 2011 and manufacturing payrolls increased the most since 1997. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
If foreign sources of steel come to dominate national defense applications, our military could never be sure if its orders would be processed to the needed specifications and in a timely manner. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Nearly every military platform and weapons system in our nation’s arsenal uses steel produced in America. These critical applications require consistent, high quality on-shore supply sources. #AmericaSteelStrong @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
The Section 232 tariffs, championed by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, have enabled key planned investments in the steel industry to move forward which continue to create jobs and contribute to economic growth. #AmericaSteelStrong

This is true! RT @millarsteel: @aisisteel #steeltalks Infact we must be one of the few materials where we can be upcycled.
Steel can be continuously recycled without losing quality, setting it apart from other materials that need to be "downcycled." #steeltalks
Steels life cycle advantages vs competing materials come from lower energy use, higher recyclability and resource conservation. #steeltalks
.@millarsteel This shows that you can increase productivity, environmental performance, and innovation simultaneously. #SteelTalks
.@millarsteel And the U.S. EPA has recognized steel as having steepest decline of air emissions among 9 manufacturing sectors. #steeltalks
.@millarsteel Each job in America's steel industry directly supports nearly seven other manufacturing jobs. #SteelTalks
.@millarsteel North American steel industry directly employs 150,000 people. #SteelTalks

RT @aisisteel: This is why it is essential to look beyond simply the use phase of a product. #SteelTalks
This is why it is essential to look beyond simply the use phase of a product and into the full life cycle of the materials used. #SteelTalks
Globally steel emits about 2.0 kgCO2e during production. Much less than aluminum’s 16.5 kg CO2e or Carbon Fiber’s 21 kgCO2e #SteelTalks
According to the US EPA, steel is the only domestic industry that has reduced energy demands while still increasing production. #SteelTalks

Innovation extends to labor productivity -- the U.S. steel industry has seen a 5-fold gain since the early '80s. #SteelTalks
Steel products are continuously reused by future generations, the very definition of sustainability. #SteelTalks
About 97% of the byproducts from the steel making process can be reused or recycled. #SteelTalks
RT @ArcelorMittal: @aisisteel and did you know 15 tonnes of steel are recycled every second #steeltalks
RT @Broaders: @aisisteel Correct! Also we have recycled more than 650Mt last year and over 23 billion tonnes ever #steeltalks
Recycling one ton of steel conserves 2,500 lbs of iron ore, 1,300 lbs of coal and 120 lbs of limestone. #SteelTalks
North American steel industry has voluntarily reduced it's energy intensity by 28% since 1990. #SteelTalks
.@worldsteel In 1937, 83,000 tons of steel were used to build the Golden Gate Bridge. Today, only half of that would be needed. #SteelTalks
