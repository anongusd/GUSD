@ayeshaali @Saisailu97 ...them.  a part of me believes that a part of these toxic individuals recognize the folly of their actions, but are so overcome with the well-deserved shame that they recede further into this dangerous personality they've constructed.
@ayeshaali @Saisailu97 It can be incredibly uncomfortable to observe or experience.  Men are usually more overt, while women are subtle, but both have this mentality that they're entitled to immature and destructive behavior because of past trauma...and they use other's compassion to manipulate...
@ayeshaali @Saisailu97 A surprisingly difficult lesson to learn on either end of the gender spectrum.
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a child.
It was inevitable that #newatheism would fall into toxic misogyny and #fascist politics as we know today; much of it is based on #absolutedeterminism and essentially rejects the human capacity to overcome the context of our birth and genetics.

@GDVF @dangohawks @SJI2783 @SteveKingIA I wouldn't say proscribed murder, but it is too complicated of an ethical dilemma to impose one way or another at a national level.  It is best left up to individual municipalities as opposed to the state or national governments.
Liberals are bizarre in that when they get an ally they'll still give them shit for it.
The problem with humans is that no matter how objectively good of a system you put in place for them, there's always going to be at least one asshole who has to exert his radical freedom and fuck everything up.

@SteveKingIA Keep religion out of politics
@Ljtnelson Lying and doing illegal shit is what I'd rather focus on.  These petty personal issues feel like a distraction from the real issues.
@afrhoes @meowllorylynn This is actually a way more accurate version of the saying.  Well done.
Why do we care that trump fucked a porn star.  MLK had his own share of extramarital affairs.  What relevance does this have for politics?
Trump seeks to improve foreign trade relations, but gave corporate tax cuts, so unless you're with the right company, we as a nation won't really reap the benefits.
