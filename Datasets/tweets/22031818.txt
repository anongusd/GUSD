@Rob_Abraham @WesternTC Because not every student drives, just like not every student eats in the cafeteria. Besides why pay if you can park on the street for "free"?

@laxbikeguy Nah, in Wisconsin it's considered just getting a buzzed.
@laxbikeguy Other differences are:   Whitewater isn't surrounded by bedroom suburbs, has no municipal bus service, doesn't permit commuter parking in the neighborhood around UW-W, or overnight on street parking 12 months of the year.
@laxbikeguy @twkovach @uscensusbureau And how do we compare to Whitewater now, which has been #1 in WI (although Madison folks rarely acknowledged)
Glad you liked the show. Love the photos of the American made firework from right here in Minnesota! https://t.co/1ALxVuOhHX
@sarasidnerCNN In the past, the fireworks manufacturers moved their sales to wherever they can find a place. It's all about the $!!
@eruviel_avila As a fireworks pro that helps write fire codes in the US, the San Pablito tragedy was easily preventable. Que lastima!
@VILLALVAZO13 As a fireworks pro that helps write national fire codes in the US, this tragedy was easily preventable. Que lastima!
Gray smoke indicates the fuel that is burning is metal. Combined with the roar and the lack of colors indicates this is mostly flash powder. https://t.co/sJKeRsvtsZ
@sarasidnerCNN @YouTube As a fireworks pro that helps develop national fire codes, it was easily preventable. Sigh!
@sarasidnerCNN @YouTube it makes me angry too! This was tragedy was inevitable.
