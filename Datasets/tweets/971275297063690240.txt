@19_mo_86 @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar You‚Äôre welcome bud.

@19_mo_86 @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar I‚Äôll answer it. The child doesn‚Äôt deserve that. Yes it does take a man and a woman but consent isn‚Äôt always present. In the end, that‚Äôs just emotional stress on the child. Sure they could be adopted but that choice isn‚Äôt always an option due to other circumstances.
@19_mo_86 @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar Because males can‚Äôt understand what women have to go through when faced with these situations. I don‚Äôt advocate for abortion. I advocate for the option for all women to be able to choose. I understand your points but you need to be open-minded and view both sides.
@dannydantheman @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar It‚Äôs so hard to reach the heart of conservatives.

Medical- Several women die from childbirth. Doctors can detect early complications and recommend abortions to save the mothers life.
@realizsm @19_mo_86 @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar Understood but success stories are rare. Honestly, I believe only rape and health concerns should be prerequisites for abortions. Otherwise, adoption should be the only option
@19_mo_86 @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar That‚Äôs true but the sad thing is that success stories like hers are rare
@realizsm @19_mo_86 @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar Apprently you didn‚Äôt pay attention to the video you posted. This woman is naming everything that happened to her as a result of a failed abortion. Who would want to deal with that all their life?
@19_mo_86 @realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar Making the babies live their life‚Äôs with human-created defects is even more evil.
@realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar People who have defects should not be killed. I‚Äôm saying that if a fetus is physically damaged due to a failed abortion, they should not force that child to have to deal with those issues all their life. It‚Äôll only do more harm than good.
@realizsm @KamalaHarris @ewarren @BernieSanders @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar I understand your point, but why should we force these infants to be born with human-caused defects. That‚Äôs just making them suffer their whole life.
