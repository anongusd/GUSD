It also serves as a loyalty test and a way of tying his followers to him. He lies to their faces and watches to see who defends him anyway.
This sort of reality bending is also typical. The truth is whatever he says *now*, not yesterday or last year. He was joking, or misinterpreted, or just so what? The truth is never knowable. Not his Twitter or his own words.
One problem with having a joke of a president is that his power is still real and no one wants to believe it. https://t.co/gxjpZWPJLC

Cohen is a crook who lied for Trump and defended Trump for money. It was his job. What is the Republican excuse for doing it? Fear? Power? It's a disgrace.
These Republicans sound like they are auditioning for Cohen‚Äôs old job as Trump‚Äôs defender and lackey.
They might find an ‚Äúhonest witness‚Äù if Trump ever hired anyone less corrupt than he is! Or is the only truth-teller the man who always surrounded himself with so many liars, crooks and spies?
Putin likely told Trump he‚Äôd get a prize for this humiliating performance with Kim Jong-un, but the Best Picture award goes to the producer, and that‚Äôs Putin. And Tom Clancy would never have written so unrealistic a script!
Cohen is destroying the last shreds of credibility of Trump the man, while Trump is in Vietnam destroying the credibility of the US presidency, dancing to Putin‚Äôs tune and flattering a mass-murdering dictator.
The worst of this Cohen spectacle is the GOP Congress members so eagerly sacrificing the honor of their office and institution to defend Donald Trump. They know what he is.

Trump's speech today should make it easier to find 20 GOP Senators to join the Dems and end this dangerous lunacy once and for all.
The groundwork is to turn the people &amp; leaders against institutions of democracy: the free press, political opposition, independent judiciary &amp; law enforcement, the truth. The infallible leader is the substitute for all of it.
Democracies rarely collapse suddenly, with tanks rolling through the streets out of a blue sky. It's a slow death of a thousand cuts to rights, norms, the rule of law. We lived through it in Russia, a far more fragile &amp; corrupt state of course.
Coincidentally, Feb 15 was already an executive power "day which will live in infamy" for me. In 1985, the president of FIDE claimed emergency powers to terminate the world championship match to save my opponent Karpov! https://t.co/P7CZFUqBNQ

Instead of exposing the evil rot at the core of the Soviet totalitarian state, everyone said "move on" and "avoid witch hunts". That brought us Putin just 9 years later, with all the witches behind him.

This is why "just give him what he wants" or "meet him halfway" is so stupid. What he wants is conflict. There's no appeasing that, only losing over and over.
Trump doesn't want an immigration solution. He needs a crisis and if there isn't one, he'll invent it. As I've said about Putin for 10 years now, confrontation itself is the goal. There's no negotiating with that, only winning or losing.

I'm flying to Las Vegas for CES &amp; will miss the speech. A pity! But I'm afraid I know what it's going to sound like. I remember Putin's speeches about "a new crisis management system" &amp; "strengthening unity" that were pretexts for crackdowns &amp; demonizing media &amp; opposition.
5) Or will there just be a few selected anecdotes to scandalize and frighten people when the overall data &amp; expert opinion is that there isn't a crisis at all?
3) Is there an attempt to justify a wall or emergency action on expert recommendations with a track record (not last few weeks)? DHS? FBI? Anything? 4) Is there a big picture view for a deal &amp; legislation? Asylum seekers, families, visa overstays?
Of course, these things would also be said if there were a real crisis! So how to determine the difference? 1) Why now, &amp; not during 2 years of GOP control? Can't blame Dem obstruction. 2) Emergency powers are for emergencies. Does he make a real case for desperate measures?
4) Attacking media for not blindly repeating his narrative. Saying "the fake news will tell you.." 5) Blaming shutdown &amp; "crisis" on others while positioning himself as the only one who can fix it. (If you enter a debate about solutions, you have accepted there is a crisis.)
A few things to listen for tonight. 1) The words "crisis," "threat," "emergency," &amp; "enemies" without evidence or on "secret" evidence. 2) Framing Trump's base as victims of these threats. 3) Blaming predecessors &amp; opponents for not dealing with the threats, or for causing them.

"Nationalism is power-hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also‚Äîsince he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself‚Äîunshakeably certain of being in the right."‚ÄîOrwell. "Notes on Nationalism" 1945

Trump's betrayals are for his interests alone. He aligns the US with authoritarians because it suits him. He spreads the virus of illiberalism, which is more contagious &amp; deadly than right or left ideology.
I think Obama sincerely believed the US retreat would lead to peace. Many of us said he was wrong and he was. Trump is much worse because we know the results already. The slaughter &amp; chaos are here, the thugs and dictators are advancing.
Trump's foreign policy is almost the same Obama's but with a much worse PR department &amp; with a critical press. It's saying "Go to Hell!" and hoping Hell doesn't reach you before you leave office. https://t.co/qKbFTGQzqd

If it's a gift or quid pro quo to Putin &amp; Erdogan or a useful distraction from domestic woes, the decision has nothing to do with US interests. That's the most dangerous fact, even if you agree with the retreat.
And keep in mind that Trump, like Putin, cares for nothing other than himself. So whether you agree with it or not, what he is getting personally in return for this move is the key to understanding it.
Everyone from Putin to the Taliban will be emboldened by the US retreat. Why negotiate or concede anything when the US will just abandon its values and its allies?
From waves of desperate refugees to homegrown terrorists inspired by Islamic State, walking away makes things worse at home even if you don't care about the slaughter in Syria &amp; Iraq.
Nobody likes the "global policeman" but nobody wants to live in a neighborhood, or society, without any police on the beat either. The power vacuum is filled immediately &amp; they don't stop targeting the free world.
I spent 8 years criticizing Obama's retreats and I can do the same about Trump's without being accused of partisanship. More of the world under the control of Iran, Russia, &amp; thugs like Assad is wrong &amp; dangerous for everyone &amp; every American.

Trump will be gone soon enough, and good riddance. But the energy generated to stop him must flow from negative to positive, to build up. If not, Trump will just be the first symptom of the terrible disease of populism and extremism.
When we founded @renew_democracy last year, it was with the idea of slowing this widening pendulum swing, to unite on basic principles of freedom, prosperity, and the rule of law. Anti-Trump is not enough.
That has a snowball effect of causing some of the moderate middle majority to radicalize so they can be heard and the rest to turn away, disgusted by the vitriol and ideological extremism.
American liberals &amp; conservatives have to be able to discuss and respect each other's ideas without hysteria or the extremist minorities on both sides will dominate more and more.

I fear an outbreak of violence that both men feel will suit their desperate domestic situations. Putin has done it many times before. Trump will struggle with his advisors &amp; his own cowardice.
Leaders who care only for themselves‚Äînot a global, national or party interest‚Äîare intrinsically dangerous and unstable. They are capable of shocking actions. Putin and Trump are both in this category.
Trump is more afraid of what Putin could do to him &amp; his image than Mueller or anything else. The extremes he may go to to escape that is why he was an unacceptable risk, not merely unfit.

For Trump, military action and ‚Äústanding up to the Russians‚Äù would appear to refute his critics and the main theme of the Mueller investigation. And we already know he is happy to use the US military to serve himself.
A dark possibility not beyond either man is that Putin and Trump could conspire to have an armed conflict timed to help Trump in 2020. A limited clash might also bolster Putin domestically, but he‚Äôd only risk it if he could control both sides.
‚ÄúThe most disturbing aspect of Cohen‚Äôs revelations regarding Trump‚Äôs Russia connections is that Putin has known it all the entire time.. Putin will never be treated like a pariah while nearly everyone believes he has the U.S. President in his pocket at least until Jan. 20, 2021.‚Äù

If the US &amp; EU wanted to deter Putin, there would be a long list of automatic sanctions &amp; other punitive actions against his oligarchs based on non-compliance &amp; any act of aggression. Not slow, ad hoc, inconsistent pressure he can absorb.
Putin will scan this looking for "unless Russia.." or "if Russia doesn't comply.." and, seeing nothing like that, no deterrence, he will continue as planned. He is escalating for more domestic distraction.

Of course Putin doesn‚Äôt want a real conflict he would lose, but as long as he can look tough at no risk to his rule, his aggression will continue despite its disastrous impact on Russia.
Putin has been telling Russians they are at war with the US &amp; NATO for years, recently expanding the propaganda to include the EU. Big bosses need big enemies, real or not. https://t.co/fqNavpLvE4
In its cowardice, naivete, and profit-seeking illusions of engagement, the West forgot what Harry Truman said about deterrence and dictators. Stand strong in small conflicts so you don't have to fight big ones.
And this is already happened of course. Putin's Syrian genocide &amp; his information and cyber war for Brexit &amp; against the 2016 American elections were absolutely encouraged by the weak response to his invasion of Ukraine.
The West decided that Ukrainian lives are expendable and that Putin can wage war there forever. But dictators always need new frontiers and take apathy as permission.
Another dangerous step in Putin's war on Ukraine. And if unopposed, he'll take another and another, until he goes too far and we have the wider conflict everyone thinks they're avoiding by not reacting to his first steps. https://t.co/4PfoQgHHTD

The Nazis took over Interpol in 1938 and it was run by SS generals. If its leadership is now handed over to a general from Putin's criminal dictatorship, civilized nations must again abandon it. Dark days.
It's a good example of the failure of engagement. Inviting dictatorships into free world institutions spreads their corruption, not liberalism or justice.

As I wrote over ten years ago, if you won't act to stop Putin, at least don't help him. Accepting him at such events gives him the only legitimacy a dictator has. Russians can't choose, but free world leaders can. https://t.co/UPeZWikyyR
And if you cannot convince enough people to trust you, lower the trust they have in everything that might challenge you. Split coalitions &amp; sow disunity, so even if your loyal base is small, it's stronger than any other group.
Centralization of power in a democracy means centralization of trust at the expense of parliament, bureaucracy, judiciary, elections, media, et al. It requires convincing people that those institutions cannot be trusted, but you can be. "Only I can fix it."
This language is not careless at all. Undermining trust in elections &amp; other fundamental democratic institutions is a key component of every kind of autocratic power grab. https://t.co/UwtfJlPU63

You cannot spread poison and then act surprised, or innocent, when things begin to die. Trump spreads poison from a hallowed office and it is killing people as surely as if they drank it themselves.
I've written that demagogues don't lead radicals; they radicalize their supporters one outrage at a time. Often their rivals radicalize in response. The tiny fraction of people capable of violence against innocents grows.
The value of human life has always distinguished the civilized world. When entire groups of people are dehumanized, called animals, called enemies, their lives become easier to take.
Demagoguery moves the middle to the extremes. Those who were already on the extremes are often moved to violence and the unthinkable becomes possible‚Äîbut it must never become acceptable.

When I said 10 years ago that Putin was a Russian problem but would become everyone's problem if not stopped, it meant his model, not just the man. Ignoring him empowered thugs &amp; autocrats worldwide.
Reversing it would also work by starting at the top, by standing up to Putin and sending a message to the rest that the norms and principles of civilization, of human life and individual rights, will be defended.
The poison of impunity has spread from the Kremlin. It's like dominoes in reverse‚Äîthugs and dictators are standing up &amp; feel free to murder their enemies wherever. If Putin can do it in England, why not Saudis in Turkey?

The Spirit of 76 is fighting for freedom from tyranny. Argue about goals and policies, but all sides must beware every encroachment on individual freedom in the name of order or civility.
We marched peacefully against Putin across Russia for years, always attacked by police &amp; provocateurs. Our freedoms were gradually destroyed, our marches banned, leaders jailed, exiled, killed.
No, I'm not defending violence or every jerk who harasses someone at dinner. There are laws. But the bigger threats come from state power &amp; those who abuse it, and any real conservative should see that.
In my experience, the "mobs" to be worried about are the ones with batons and guns that bash in the heads of protesters. Exaggerating the danger of public protest is often prelude to crackdowns on free speech.
Pathetic of GOP to whine about public resistance to Trump's attacks on American values. "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." And Barry Goldwater was hardly a liberal!

It's equally inaccurate and ahistorical to call whatever the government does that you like "socialism". And there is no "pure" socialism, or anything else in politics. It's tradeoffs and rationalizations all the way down. https://t.co/3Gp0Jg6Mqi
I'd be happy to tour US campuses lecturing about the fallacies &amp; dangers of socialism &amp; govt power. Perhaps my lectures would be protested, or even canceled due to public pressure. And? I would be outraged and continue to fight for my ideas, not whine about "censorship".

If/when giant private platforms approach monopoly power, this conversation becomes relevant. But there are laws and precedent for that, too, and ways to bust monopolies without censorship, let alone totalitarianism.

If your response is, "Yes, but what happens when such people get government power?", that is exactly why democratic institutions must be strong and balanced, to prevent abuse and persecution.
Free people shouting on social media leading to private companies changing their practices, even if I disagree with the politics or the practice, and I see "free" and "private", not mob rule. Citizens of authoritarian states can only envy their freedom &amp; power.
And I'm the last person to sympathize with political correctness, let alone "leftist mobs" or censorship. But my background is also why I know the difference and refuse to make false comparisons.
Stop treating the destruction of your democracy like an academic conversation, or simply clickbait. It's a war, and you're aiding the enemy by giving them a platform.
Horrible people promoting horrible ideas should be shunned, ridiculed, ignored. This isn't illiberal thinking, it's the immune system response to an attack. Don't engage with cancer to hear what it has to say.

Combating this influence will require international cooperation &amp; writing new laws to deal with a mafia state like Putin's Russia and China, which seamlessly combine private business with state power.
Instead, Putin-connected companies &amp; oligarchs spread corruption along with the cash they looted from the Russian people, while always operating as Kremlin agents. It was always a one-way street.
This Kremlin method of influence was actually encouraged by Western leaders as engagement. They hoped (so they said) it would liberalize Russia &amp; China while also profiting themselves.

There won't be any gulags for them, or anyone, if liberal democracy thrives, only the dustbin of history. The real purges are happening now, as both sides push out their moderates.
Trump's supporters fear having done to them exactly what they would do to anyone who doesn't agree with them, and accuse others of their own sins.
It's a call for democratic transparency, political accountability, and public memory. Calling that desire 'totalitarian' in order to defend Trump's attacks on fundamental US institutions &amp; values is perverse.
"Purging" the shills &amp; sycophants normalizing Trump's assault on US institutions would take authoritarian power that none of us have or want. We want them named for their own actions, and to know they will be remembered.

And yes, I am intolerant of intolerance, as Popper put it. You do not collaborate with those who would destroy you. You do not debate with those who wish to end all debate.
With @renew_democracy, this coalition concept is global, asking all who value the principles of liberal democracy to fight to defend them against extremists &amp; autocrats on all sides. Then we can get back to arguing amongst ourselves!
Working with demagogues and autocrats is like working with cancer. You fight it. You cut it out. These aren't political differences, it's deciding if we're going to have politics at all.
When Trump took office, I called it a test, a wake-up call that would leave America stronger, more united, more aware of the value of its founding principles. If that doesn't happen, Trump has won regardless of the election results.
People should know that their choices come with a price. Feel empathy if you can, but don't act from pity because we know such people don't have any for us when they have power.
Similarly, my lack of forgiveness comes from experience. The USSR fell, but the KGB was never rooted out in the rush to celebrate &amp; move on. No accountability, no truth commissions. Putin was the result, just 8 years later.
A thoughtful contribution, thank you. Ideological opposites allying for the greater good is also what I tried to help build in Russia against Putin. We'd be on opposite sides in a parliament, but at least we'd have one. https://t.co/vHyplDkAsH

"I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of being sanctioned by Putin for standing up for freedom and human rights for the Russian people and against Putin‚Äôs deadly aggression in Ukraine. I will never stop my efforts to support democracy, free speech, and the rule of law in Russia."‚ÄîJohn McCain
The global rise of authoritarianism and the crisis of liberal democracy are the direct result of decades of false equivalence, of quietly appeasing the evils that John McCain understood all too well.
McCain stood proudly for what all of America used to stand for, the idea that everyone in the world deserved freedom and that it was worth fighting for both on principle and as a strategic benefit for US security.
Of course McCain wasn't an "opponent of Russia," but of its dictatorship. McCain saw Putin for the KGB thug he is and the Kremlin hated &amp; feared him, itself an honor. https://t.co/X9qCtlQBJ0

As I've said, a demagogue doesn't find radicals to lead; he radicalizes his supporters one outrage at a time. Eventually he's all they have and the truth is what he says it is.
That's why demagoguery is so dangerous historically. When followers are so loyal to a person‚Äînot to principles or policies or even a party‚Äîthere is no need to convince them of anything, only to give orders.
Does it? Is there anything Trump could say that would lose the supporters he has left? He is what they follow, not anything he stands for or says or does. https://t.co/7VH3XdtHMt

This is why "the Trump admin is tough on Russia" is a joke as long as Trump himself continues to flatter &amp; do favors for Putin like the summit, etc. Being tough on *Putin* is what matters because Putin doesn't care about Russia or Russians.
Making Russia a pariah state is nearly meaningless as a deterrent if Putin's gang is convinced that only Putin can ever fix things, which is exactly what Trump's personal loyalty to him communicates.
What I've been saying for years, but omits *why* it matters. Threatening Putin's power is the only threat that matters. Trump undercutting US sanctions relieves that pressure. https://t.co/WASazFA2nJ

Sanctions are intended to have a policy point: deterrence and/or retaliation. They only work on Putin if they target the only thing he cares about, staying in power in Russia. Subverting that by fawning over him isn't being "tough on Russia".

Trump's "We're all to blame" says it all. Attacking his own administration and flattering Putin. America First? A sick joke. Where are Trump's supporters right now? Where are you? You fools and enablers selling out your country and the world for this traitor?
And there's the next item on Putin's wish list, offering "help" in investigating his own attacks on the US in exchange for Trump's help stopping @Billbrowder and the Magnitsky sanctions that target him &amp; his oligarchs.
Trump hits Obama for not stopping Putin's attacks on the US. He hits Merkel for making a pipeline deal with Putin. But next to Putin himself, he won't say anything. Is he wearing a tie or a leash? #PutinsPoodle
That Trump not only allows this, but happily defends the dictator who recently ordered a Russian military intelligence unit to attack the USA, is either an overwhelming display of weakness or treason.
This is Putin's dream, bilateral equality with the US despite his dictatorship &amp; aggression, one on one with the US president instead of confronting American interests, international institutions, and free world values.
The clearest message from this pathetic display is that Trump doesn't represent America, much like Putin doesn't represent Russia. And he just spent two hours alone with a KGB agent.

Choices are: 1) Trump was inexplicably ignored by the Russian influence effort; 2) He heroically refused all their temptations (we know he accepted some); or 3) He was compromised by Russia to some degree well before his candidacy, explaining his bizarre loyalty to Putin.
Of course the Kremlin's targeted Trump years ago. It would be abnormal had they not. Reckless &amp; with huge debts, he was an ideal candidate for the standard KGB ingredients of gambling, real estate, and sex.
They communicate on yachts, via family members, and shared private banks instead of in press conferences and on-the-record calls. They use these conduits to channel money into free world politics, gain favors, launder cash, etc.
It's an effective way of keeping political business (and business business) out of sight and serving personal interests instead of the national interest. So it's a natural course for autocrats &amp; would-be autocrats.
Putin's oligarchs are his quasi-official ambassadors and agents worldwide, and they recruit foreign businesses &amp; business people with favorable terms as agents of influence.

The GOP wanted to keep Trump supporters without electing Trump. If the Democrats think they can keep Socialist supporters without electing Socialists they are also dangerously wrong.
This is why there is so much 'investment' in Western politics by authoritarian regimes like Russia, Saudi, China. Their regimes' survival depends not just on markets, but the moral capitulation of free world values.
Facing this crisis at home, dictators need foreign help to stay afloat. They need markets in the rich free world for their gas, oil, manufacturing. They need free world leaders who don't care about human rights.
The crisis every authoritarian regime reaches is the inability to meet economic &amp; social needs without political liberalization. Call it the "Pensions or Police Dilemma". The survival of the regime must come first, so it's a downward spiral of repression.
The Putin mafia turned the Russian state into a vacuum cleaner, sucking up the resources of the nation to Moscow into his cronies' pockets. Even when instability comes he can't just reverse the flow. The machine doesn't work that way.
Many don't understand about the corruption endemic in authoritarian states. The regime cannot just end it at will even if it wants to. It's how the system works. It IS the system.
Once a corrupt system is in place, it takes massive reform from very the top to change it. Since nothing has changed at the top in Putin's Russia, we should assume the worst. https://t.co/R7SdJ15EAK

The US is under a dangerous foreign attack that strikes at the heart of democracy &amp; stability. But it's Putin's propaganda and his attacks on elections, not immigration. Where is the GOP outrage and plan to stop that? https://t.co/bJ4cwIXTYD
Sanctions &amp; laws make news when they are passed, but it's often hard to monitor &amp; enforce implementation, as @kolga explains here. US has similar problem. https://t.co/lMea1MeAsR
Autocrats rarely ride in on tanks. They subvert the traditions, laws, and institutions that constrain them until they don't. Putin, Erdogan, et al, the power grabs come *after* the first election. https://t.co/rFKN86YRya

"Not *our* kids" is easily expanded from gassed Syrians and bombed Ukrainians to refugees in America to legal immigrants and any "other" they wish to target, inevitably minority groups.
Human rights imperatives are global for a good reason. If you don't care about democracy &amp; liberty abroad, or refugee children, that moral relativism and apathy will quickly spread at home as well.
This follows the progression of moral detachment that makes anything possible. Condone the suffering of children in Syria, of "not our" children in America, and then? https://t.co/7J8YgiP4x5
