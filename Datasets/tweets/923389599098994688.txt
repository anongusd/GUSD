@funder How was the speech racist?

I just got done watching the presidential address. Amazing speech. Sincere and determining. The Schumer and Pelosi speeches at the end were bland and not factual. Trump states real life circumstances and percentages!    #BuildTheWall2019

@almondleafer @GragesTyler @magmaris @sjcloobeck It was the man I was responding too who said there were urban states*

@almondleafer @GragesTyler @magmaris @sjcloobeck It wasn‚Äôt me who said there were urban states or was the man I was responding too.
@sjcloobeck Lop*
@GragesTyler @magmaris @sjcloobeck Actually in urban states they have more electors because they have more people and in rural states they have less people so they have less electors so saying that rural states are worth more than urban states is completely absurd.

@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck Why don‚Äôt you think so? So 2 blue counties can dictate every election?
@funder @TheDemCoalition Trump is American. He was born in NYC.
@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck Second. Doesn‚Äôt the left want more government control? I believe the left brought up this issue because they are still crying about losing in 2016.
@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck First off You make it sound like the South created the electoral college for their needs or how you put it their interests when this article actually states that it was made because the govt didnt think that ordinary people could choose a leader intelligently
@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck Where did you get that information about slave states?
@magmaris @MikeJGrogan @sjcloobeck I respect your decisions as well thank you for your cooperation and your timeüôèüèª.
@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck We elected the electors they are elected officials. We elected them to do a job and this is part of it and Americans need to support our governments decision once they elect our President.
@MikeJGrogan @magmaris @sjcloobeck https://t.co/kOiwb7ISM8 if you look at this link it even states that Hillary‚Äôs votes come mostly from the same places. New York and California. This is why it‚Äôs so good. To protect everyone from big cities, red or blue, from determining the future of America.
@deathyyy @funder @TheDemCoalition ??
@magmaris @sjcloobeck I haven‚Äôt given much thought on finding a middle ground but I believe it‚Äôs achievable. I don‚Äôt know much about the electors in the states either so I‚Äôll have to do more research on that.
@magmaris @sjcloobeck Since their populations are so high they would have power over the government and leave small towns without a voice. In 2016 Hillary Clinton only won the popular vote because of 2 counties. Cook county and Los Angeles county.
@magmaris @sjcloobeck There are many large cities that have a larger number of citizens that all in most cases think the same political wise. For example. Los Angeles and Chicago and New York all usually vote alike and they would control the whole election basically.
@sjcloobeck You can‚Äôt eliminate the electoral college or even more corruption and loo sided elections would take place.
@funder @TheDemCoalition He corrected himself before he said it all of the way through...
@benshapiro have you given much thought about a 2020 presidential run? I‚Äôd support you 100% and help as much as possible!
