@JewishOdysseus @willstauff Now that is a better point. I agree that he is ineffective.
@willstauff Calling someone a murder supporter because they disagree with you about the intentions of someone telling a joke is uncivil.
@willstauff Hurt not only himself, but other conservatives running.
@willstauff That pro-lifers are pro-life only because they are ignorant/refuse to accept science. Not true, but Akin gave them evidence.
@willstauff I'm sorry to hear it. The difference between the two comments is that one was  a joke and one was serious. The left often argues
@willstauff Cute. But I'm going to pay you the compliment of believing that you understand that people sometimes use expressions.
@willstauff I think you're being intentionally obtuse.
@willstauff This is something people say all the time. Kids to siblings, co-workers, politicians. He's obviously not plotting.
@willstauff Yeah, probably not a great idea. IF Rove were more like Romney and seemed to be espousing pro-abort views, I'd be more convinced
@willstauff That does not suggest hatred of Akin because of his pro-life stance. That suggests frustration because of a campaign disaster.
@willstauff Not if what there is is one vague piece of hearsay and one joke about a man who has done something that has sunk his campaign.
@willstauff Right. It says clearly that this was a joke. Perhaps in poor taste, but not as damaging as Akin's real ignorance.
@willstauff Reading! Thanks!
@willstauff spurious or scant evidence. Rather have something solid. That's all :)
@willstauff No reason. Like most, he's just a man with opinions, no Wizard. But I am reluctant to join a campaign against a man on
@willstauff @griffinelection Fair enough! Thanks much!
@willstauff They made pro-lifers look stupid. Most aren't, but because of him, Dems had some credence when bashing. Rove right to worry.
@willstauff I think it's clear that he wasn't intending to. Akin's comments, on the other hand, were false and damaging to pro-lifers.
@willstauff A lot of people say, "I'm going to kill you" when they're really upset. If Rove really intended to kill Akin, his were worse.
@willstauff That's true - but because the evidence here is hearsay and very vague, there could be other explanations as well.

@US_VeteranGiant I think you've boarded another train here and I'm too tired to chase it. Enjoy your morning.
@US_VeteranGiant Why does it have to be a single attack? More than 3,000 have died in conventional attacks. Slower but more = worse?
@US_VeteranGiant No. But if you care about human rights, go in earlier. Don't wait for that.
@US_VeteranGiant Ok. So a chemical weapons attack that kills a thousand people is worse than a non-chemical attack that kills 3x as many?
@US_VeteranGiant No. I'm saying that massacres of civilians = bad, no matter what the method of delivery is.
@US_VeteranGiant I don't see the difference between a government killing thousands of civilians with guns or the same with chemical weps.
@US_VeteranGiant Say a chem. weapons attack kills 1,000 people while gunmen kill 3,000. Is the chem attack really worse?
@US_VeteranGiant There are still other countries we might like to help. Death toll should, I think, matter more than method.
@US_VeteranGiant Different administration, different policies, different issue. I meant regarding Syria.
@US_VeteranGiant That hasn't changed either. There are still others.
@US_VeteranGiant  I haven't seen the baby steps. I've seen a constant hands off policy until now. Perhaps I missed things you didn't.
@US_VeteranGiant Ok. Good. At least we can agree there.
@US_VeteranGiant Oh, I see. And you would argue that instead we've been taking baby steps in this direction?
@US_VeteranGiant I don't think those things are mutually exclusive. But there was justification enough to warrant action before.
@US_VeteranGiant Really? How's it similar?
@US_VeteranGiant Or perhaps it's a political move to distract voters from Benghazi and problems at home.
@US_VeteranGiant to happen before? And if so, why  the sudden change in policy? Why wasn't it enough of a reason then?
@US_VeteranGiant Could it maybe, possibly be because we don't want massive numbers of civilian deaths? If so, isn't that what we allowed
@US_VeteranGiant Ok. So let's think about why we might not want to used WMDs on a civilian population.
@US_VeteranGiant Is it for a reason other than to prevent massive numbers of deaths?
@US_VeteranGiant Ok. And why don't we want WMDS to be used?
@US_VeteranGiant Ok, why?
@US_VeteranGiant It's nice that it's convincing to you, but to some of us it isn't. What is our goal? To prevent the loss of life?
@US_VeteranGiant My point is not that action would not be justified. But as Hannan points out, the chem. attack argument hardly makes sense.
@US_VeteranGiant Regardless of that fact, we knew of the massacres long ago. The method should not matter more than the result.
@US_VeteranGiant First, these are Hannan's figures. I was quoting him and I largely agree with his article. Yes, they include both sides.
@US_VeteranGiant Right. There's been mass destruction already. So I question the motives and the timing of these proposed limited strikes.
@KLSouth What about jobs?
@US_VeteranGiant The result is largely the same, even if the method has changed. Seems like a political move, rather than one of conscience.
@US_VeteranGiant Not at all. It's that the killing before was just as appalling. Why not before instead of so late in the game?
@frasernelson Not necessarily. What created the need for a bail-in? Being greedy doesn't preclude you from being incompetent.

@fancygoose  I'm sorry the ideas of individual choice and responsibility are depressing to you. Anti-depressants may be covered by your plan
@fancygoose is cheaper and you can choose that. I might.
@fancygoose If you want a company that covers acne medication and you're willing to pay that price, great. Or, maybe over the counter
@fancygoose Insurance companies should be able to choose what they cover and you ought to be able to choose which you do commerce with.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose Except that you're actually opposing choice. No borg for me, thanks.
@fancygoose It's certainly fair to pay for your own insurance. It's also fair to pay for your own birth control.
@fancygoose @CUSSBRO Because then I might have to take responsibility for my own choices rather than keeping others from making theirs.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose It wasn't easy to buy, but we did it. That's how things work.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose When I bought insurance for the first time, my husband worked for a temp agency and I had a low paying tutoring job
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose Oh. Did the government force you to buy her a car?
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose That's service, rather than any particular number. Not the same thing.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose It's nice that employers offer that option. That does not prevent you from buying your own. I have.
@fancygoose @CUSSBRO Of course it is. Then you pick another company.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose Do you throw a fit if the government kills people you don't want it to kill?
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose We don't need the government forcing companies to make certain numbers available. Also, there's no ethical issue.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose If one phone company let you call only certain numbers and another let you call them all, you'd pick the other.
@CUSSBRO @fancygoose No. The issue here is whether or not insurance companies ought to be able to decide what they cover.
@fancygoose IF even the Catholic Church in NY chooses to do so, then choice can't really be such a problem, can it?
@fancygoose We're not talking religion. We're talking choice.
@fancygoose It's as simple as this - if you don't like an insurer that doesn't offer coverage, pick a different insurer. Choice. Right?
@fancygoose I'm not sure how this is relevant to our discussion. But the ad hominem attacks are really adding credence to your arguments!
@fancygoose Oh. Wait. Is it ok to take away choice to help people stay healthy?
@fancygoose Right. If that's your choice. But you're not really for choice if you're forcing others who don't want that to do the same.
@fancygoose No. There are plenty of things they don't cover and that will continue with "healthcare reform." You have to weigh your options.
@fancygoose I am self-employed. I've paid for my own insurance and chose based on services and prices. That's how business works.
@fancygoose Are we pretending that we're not paying for insurance under Obamacare?
@fancygoose Or I could pretend to be for individual choice while forcing my personal views on insurance companies - forcing premiums to rise
@fancygoose Or, you know. I could just CHOOSE a different private insurance company that offered the things I wanted.
@fancygoose Wait. I thought Democrats were supposed to be in favor of choice. Why isn't allowing insurance companies to choose a good thing?

@willstauff I will agree that most libertarians lean towards anarchy. Paul is not one of those. See his vote on partial birth abortion.

@PoliticallyOC The state probably shouldn't be involved in paying for that anyway. And besides, the state isn't paying. You are. Both times.
@PoliticallyOC It concerns me that you don't object to states forcing people to purchase anything. Not birth control, not organic food.
@PoliticallyOC Except that taxation is a power granted to states, whereas forcing people to purchase items is not. It concerns me that

@PoliticallyOC I would argue that this mandate, whether federal or state, violates the 14th amendment. See: http://t.co/AYwp6NbO
@PoliticallyOC You suggest that the only thing that matters here is the state's constitution. But states are limited by the 14th amendment
@PoliticallyOC You either buy the insurance, or you pay the fine. There's no opt out, and that was Santorum's point.
@PoliticallyOC of living/breathing in MA. Or, with Obamacare, in the US.
@PoliticallyOC I really don't think he is. Unless you're extremely poor, you do have to buy insurance. It's not a choice. It's a condition
@PoliticallyOC Ok, but no one is advocating breaking the law, here. The question is, are these things just and good laws? I think not.
@PoliticallyOC That's fair! But then, criticism of such a bill is legitimate. Santorum isn't advocating disobeying the law.
@PoliticallyOC Fair enough. Do states also have the right to mandate the purchase of, say, organic foods and birth control?
@PoliticallyOC But you would support it if a congressional majority favored it?
@PoliticallyOC No. The vast majority of the MA congress is not the same as the majority of the people. Support was about half and half.
@PoliticallyOC Maybe. But that's a lot harder than it sounds, and it generally takes capital, that, again, would have taken advance planning
@PoliticallyOC Alright, so in that case, the Obama healthplan is A-OK in your book?
@PoliticallyOC Yes. Particularly the sponsors of the bill.
@PoliticallyOC less choice than one might think.
@PoliticallyOC You can't choose every job, either. Again, the employer chooses you. And with unemployment as high as it is, workers have
@PoliticallyOC No, it's not a problem by your logic, because there are well over 50 countries you can move to if you don't care for it.
@PoliticallyOC Maybe so. But it isn't something we can instantly change after a politician imposes a mandate on us.
@PoliticallyOC No, it's not. I can't choose how much money I make. My boss chooses how much he is willing to pay.
@PoliticallyOC I maintain that accepting the mandate is not a choice. "Living in Massachusetts" is much the same as breathing there.
@PoliticallyOC Not exactly. If only we got to choose how much money we made! ;)
@PoliticallyOC Ok, yes. Unless they're too poor. But for anyone who makes more than that, just breathing is enough.
@PoliticallyOC The individual mandate requires individuals to buy insurance. If they don't, they have to pay a fine. There's not an opt out.
@PoliticallyOC Romney didn't seem tor refute Santorum's point about Romneycare. Are you arguing that there is no individual mandate?
@ProLifePolitics They have to focus on winning the primary first. That's reality. And if there is foul play, they ought to challenge it.
@PoliticallyOC http://t.co/5R694Wzo (More about Obama than Romney). I concede that he can be petulant, but I am glad he isn't easily cowed.
@PoliticallyOC Most of the trifecta speech did focus on Obama. And rather than trumpeting himself, he gave credit to voters, staff, family.
@PoliticallyOC Conservatives are often too quick to roll over. Attacks, if well-founded, are better than cowardice.
@PoliticallyOC Which in particular?
@DLoesch I really like Santorum, but I think that poll is very wrong. None of the others have results even close to that. PPP is Democratic.
@PoliticallyOC Are you referring to a specific incident?
@davidaxelrod I think you are ignoring many of the positive messages of CPAC. Much of the discussion was about how to bring "morning" back.

@ToddKincannon The bible also does not say, "don't rape your sister." Not everything is written as a commandment.
@ToddKincannon And the consequences of that were often heartbreaking. The stories of jealousy and rivalry are there for a reason.
