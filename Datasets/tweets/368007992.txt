@Alex_Gever please do some research before you say shit like this. being "down" isn't hereditary, depression is. because it's an illness.
@Alex_Gever mental illness isnt a choice tho! nobody chooses to be anorexic/depressed/etc. its chemical, its biological, just like cancer.
@Alex_Gever it's like having a cancer patient costume. it's belittling a disease that kills millions of people. i hope that clears it up.
@Alex_Gever it's supposed to be an anorexic girl, hence the name "Anna Rexic". it's using an illness as a costume, which is disgusting.
