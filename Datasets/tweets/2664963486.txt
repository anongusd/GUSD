@whitera65156619 @cala_1111 When's that parade again?
I trust Jesus Christ. I don't trust Q or Sessions or "the plan". I trust that if given the chance through declassification, the American people will rise up and support justice. Without declassification there is no legal way forward for the good guys.
Here's what Q followers do when you 1. want to declassify and 2. question Q... they behave just like antifa. @cala_1111 https://t.co/QMMEVsAK3e
Remember when I told how Q was an op to sow division. I am getting attacked by Q folks for wanting POTUS to declassify. Think about that. https://t.co/8dYa1EIR20
@whitera65156619 @filthy_liberals Can you count? The house will begin impeachment Q1. The senate is filled with never trumpers which makes it a toss up you dumbass - basic math. I am trump supporter. I am saying to declassify to stop that sht. I guess Q is against declassifying? Not surprised.
5. If @POTUS declassifies he will gain widespread support from even Bernie bros. Do the fcking research. Ask them. Either way the dems will begin impeachment Q1. But, at least declassifying will force the wheels of justice, firings, arrests, and most importantly transparency.
4. Myth: Declassifying will trigger impeachment. That is deep state horse shit. The main item the deep state needs is no light, no exposure, and no DECLASSIFICATION. Stop with the leverage talk. Leverage implies footing strength.
3. @POTUS staff is basically telling him to hold still while the deep state tries to commit a coup and ruin the US. His staff from @RudyGiuliani to @JaySekulow to @KellyannePolls to @parscale to Kelly to et al are enabling @realDonaldTrump to get outflanked. It's malpractice.
2. Name one high level arrest. Just one. Name one raid where FBI agents kicked in the door of any high level Dems. 0. Zilch. Nada. Don't give me chan rumors.
1. Deep state is winning. Prove me wrong. POTUS staff should be fired.
Do you think our Gov wouldn't use a lie to us or create a deep fake to impeach Trump? Stop projecting start thinking. THEY RAIDED WHISTLE BLOWERS. What did Trump do? His staff had him do nothing. Q tells you to think right?
When Q says don't worry about impeachment... really think about it. They have the majority in the house. All they need is to get the never Trump senators to join and then it's a toss up. That's not 4d chess... that's a greater likelihood of impeachment right now than ever.
They're already lining up the stories, the narrative, and the legal strategy. The never Trump senators are just waiting. Not saying it would be successful, saying it be a quagmire... DECLASSIFY ALREADY. https://t.co/WxHpzQCyTI
They'll do nothing... on purpose. They are the controlled opposition. They are the swamp. What came of all the many house investigations? Name one arrest? https://t.co/vGMn4SA6e1
@Jordan_Sather_ @seanhannity POTUS had an opportunity to gain the Bernie bros and MAGA and create an alliance.

@filthy_liberals Outrage op... no arrests. None. Ppl need to wake up and start at'ing POTUS account to declassify. That is the only way. He will be impeached come Q1 2019 either way.

Between leverage ppl and chans ppl... you just get a sense that not only is there no 4d chess... it's a deep state rout. POTUS has made terrible hires for staff in close proximity. Impeachment is more likely right now today than ever before. Bank it.
POTUS had a chance to unite the Bernie bros and MAGA by firing everyone and going after HRC... that would have made election for dems impossible.

.@POTUS and his malpractice staff has enabled this. https://t.co/TdEWrBiPQ9
@TheLastRefuge2 Define leverage: the power to influence a person or situation to achieve a particular outcome.		POTUS has 0 leverage and 0 positive outcome here. Deep state is laughing their asses off right now. THEY probably came up muh leverage. Goodness.
"Leverage" by not declassifying implies that @POTUS is actually getting something out of it. What has he gotten? There is still a coup, no arrests, still fake news, daily attacks, on and on. THERE IS NO LEVERAGE. Leverage implies positive outcome for the person holding leverage.
Today is Day #678 of a coup trying to take down a duly elected @POTUS.
Literally a soft coup occurring. We should already have arrests... this is close to political collapse if not a constitutional crisis already. And what does the @POTUS staff do? NOTHING. THEY SET HIM UP FOR A FALL. MALPRACTICE. @realDonaldTrump @JaySekulow @RudyGiuliani
.@POTUS is listening to the same voices in his admin that said he would never win and wasn't presidential... these same ppl said don't fire RR, don't fire Mueller, don't declassify... His staff should be fired. @RudyGiuliani @JaySekulow @Scavino45 @KellyannePolls https://t.co/ODsyHvzwM4
