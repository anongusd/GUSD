@fishmanpet @alexschief @bill_mk @MinneapolisFed And just so we’re at least all working off the same set of facts, the public will be allowed to park in the garage.
@fishmanpet @alexschief @bill_mk @MinneapolisFed Guys, I’ve offered to meet with anyone who wants to discuss this project. If you’d like to understand (and/or challenge) my thinking, why don’t you take me up on it?eric.dayton@askovfinlayson.com
My son comes downstairs this morning in a Wild t-shirt and informs me that he’s wearing it to school. I tell him he needs to put on something warmer. He refuses. An argument ensues that he ultimately shuts down with “The @mnwild do not give up.”		He’s wearing the shirt. Go Wild.
Amazing cameo by @willsteger’s Crossing Antarctica, a book so South that it’s North – well played, @Jacob_Frey! https://t.co/zejfmPl4aw

@GordonMrWright @pyry @alexschief @TomBasgen A small informal gathering to discuss urban design and climate change – you’re welcome to join us! 4:30pm @ TBF’s cafe
@mikelinnemann @Twitter @TwitterSupport @IndignantMN Sorry, I was trying to contact them directly. But I appreciate the support!
@TwitterSupport It’s been almost a month since our restaurant’s @bachelorfarmer @Twitter account was suspended and no movement or even a reply to acknowledge the issue – can we please get some help? Thank you!
@pyry @alexschief @TomBasgen I welcome the high standards and I’m learning a lot through these conversations. @pyry, I hope you can join us Thursday.
@kar_nels Regarding public $, they’re privately owned in Minneapolis (Saint Paul is different). Certainly wouldn’t be without cost / disruption, but worth it in my opinion! Thanks for the conversation – it’s an important one.
@kar_nels “Are skyways generally causing economic ruin for our cities and making us unappealing overall?” Certainly that would be overstating it, and as you point out, they do create some economic value. However, I think the downside outweighs it and we’d be (net) better off without them.
@alexschief In the meantime, solving climate change will require a lot of people working together. Very few of us are perfect on this issue, but let's give one another the benefit of the doubt re: intent and look for opportunities to work together rather than tearing each other down.
@alexschief As I said, I understand and respect your opposition. I assessed the project differently, which led to my support. I see you're in PA now, but let me know if you're ever back in MN and we can talk through this then (if you're interested).
@alexschief @TomBasgen @pyry A few folks are meeting with me in our cafe on Thursday at 4:30pm to share perspectives on the ramp and you’re all welcome to join. Alex, I’ve read your https://t.co/mZGaYP1Aln piece and respect your opposition to the project – I hope we’ll get a chance to discuss it further.
@alexschief @TomBasgen @pyry We've gone well beyond marketing on this and have built our business model on climate accountability to align our financial interests with interests of the planet – you can learn more here: https://t.co/Pren2jK7zg
@alexschief @TomBasgen @pyry I put a little more thought into it than that, Alex. You can certainly challenge my judgment on this one, but please don't question my integrity or sincerity of commitment when it comes to addressing climate change.
@GettingGophery @GrantSimons2 As follow-up to this, I'm meeting with a couple folks in our cafe at 4:30pm on Thursday and you're both welcome to join for the conversation.
@troydavison1d @AlexT_Burns I'm having coffee with Alex on Thursday and you're welcome to join us! I'm not trying to dodge the conversation – I'd just rather have it in person.
@alexschief @kar_nels But fortunately, Kar, I don’t agree that we’re stuck with them! Anyway, my two cents (full case made here: https://t.co/hfA7ZH23VB).
@alexschief @kar_nels We don’t have nearly enough foot traffic to support two healthy levels of a city and won’t in our lifetime (we’d need Tokyo-level density). "Improved skyways" are kind of like the "clean coal" of urban design – anything that bifurcates foot traffic is fundamentally bad.
@alexschief @kar_nels If I believed the skyways could be successfully tweaked, I wouldn't argue for their removal. Increasing the density of downtown residential will definitely help and I'm all for programming the streetscape. But neither really solves the problem we're facing.
@bloisolson @CallaghanPeter @alexschief @BillLindeke @Hennepin That’s not the choice, Blois. I like comfort just fine, but what I value even more is a vibrant city with a bustling streetscape and healthy retail and so I’m willing to *gasp* put on a jacket to go grab lunch in order to achieve it.
@CallaghanPeter @alexschief @BillLindeke @Hennepin I think everyone knows how I feel about the skyways, so I’ll just say this: When we value comfort and convenience as a city above all else, that’s what we get. But it’s also all we get.
@yourpalborno @greatnorthern Love it! I can’t join you tonight, unfortunately, but really appreciate the invitation – have fun!! 🙌🏻❄️💪🏻
We’ve lost a really good one. Jim Dayton shaped every project I worked on for the past decade and made it all so much fun. I’m sad to lose him as a partner and heartbroken to lose him as a friend. https://t.co/Qc5NOE7XAQ https://t.co/UG86hWZcwX

@JSchelitzche Regarding recommendations, we’re finding exciting solutions in energy and also agriculture through our Keep The North Cold grantmaking at @askovfinlayson. There’s such a huge opportunity for innovation if we’re all able and willing to recognize and tackle this problem together.
@JSchelitzche This includes the devastating impact of climate change on poor people living in developing countries. Those countries have the opportunity to leapfrog Western economies on green energy and technology and position themselves for a sustainable (and prosperous) future.
@JSchelitzche Thank you, Jesse – those are important concerns. I think we’re starting to see that the cost of inaction will vastly outweigh what’s required to address the problem.

@erikjaster Borrowed the photo from a friend! I'm not going to talk the talk and then not walk the walk – trust me.
@liblawbs And I've really tried.
@liblawbs Not saying Nicollet Mall is simple, but I'm having a hard time understanding the timeline, especially relative to those other projects.
@liblawbs I guess I wouldn't consider building a football stadium or highway bridge to be uncomplicated projects either!
@liblawbs What's an appropriate comparison then? Large-scale and complex construction projects are by definition unique, but is there no relevance?
@snyde043 @beukema @dbrauer This may very well have been the right sequencing, but every GC has told me that the pace of work is inexcusable.
@snyde043 @beukema @dbrauer And I absolutely respect his perspective. But I've been talking with general contractors around town to try and understand the timeline...
@cleverkate @bloisolson let's take the time to learn from other Northern cities around the world and become a leader in year-round outdoor accessibility.
@cleverkate @bloisolson I don't pretend to know all the considerations needed at this early stage in the process, but as I said in my OpEd...
@cleverkate @bloisolson If we really value those members of our community, we should be clearing sidewalks and crosswalks of snow in the wintertime now (we're not).
@cleverkate @bloisolson I addressed the issue in my piece and think everyone in Minneapolis should be able to safely navigate our city's streets year-round.
@snyde043 @dbrauer I've really tried to understand why it had to take this long, but haven't been able to figure it out.
@beukema @dbrauer Averaged $30M+ / month of progress during stadium construction, yet this project couldn't move any faster? Even accounting for differences?
@beukema @dbrauer Obviously not an apples-to-apples comparison. But I still have a hard time accepting this couldn't have been more efficiently executed.
@adalehunt Sorry, I don't follow.
@adalehunt Not blaming it for the stores that are leaving. But I know the stores that are staying have suffered during construction. Both can be true.
@bloisolson Stay tuned! And to be clear, I wouldn't imagine them coming down en masse.
@MarkRemme Even if you pull that out, still takes longer than 35W bridge? It's just really hard to understand, and I've tried.
@snyde043 @dbrauer I'm aware of the complexity of the project. I still don't think it justifies a torn-up city for 2 years+.
@dbrauer Fair enough! I just hate seeing the continued impact on Downtown businesses who have to endure it.
@dbrauer I recognize that, but would argue the larger point stands.
@GrantSimons2 I'm aware of the complexity of the project. But I still don't think it excuses the pace / timeline, especially given impact on businesses.
@dbrauer 30 months is correct, but the first three were demolition of Metrodome. Then 27 to build the stadium.
I didn't take the photo, but thanks for keeping me honest! https://t.co/7A1BGHLMLI
@plattMSP You're right – I don't.
@CallaghanPeter I borrowed it from a friend. 😉
By the numbers...		35W Bridge: $234M, 12 mos.	Target Field: $555M, 24 mos.	U.S. Bank Stadium: $1.1B, 27 mos.	Nicollet Mall: $50M, 28 mos.

@DeRushaEats @MorningWXGuy @RickNelsonStrib @SnowKreilich Keep in mind they're working within the tight constraints of the HPC in terms of what's deemed "appropriate" for a historic neighborhood.
@DeRushaEats @MorningWXGuy @RickNelsonStrib @SnowKreilich It sure beats the faux-historic crap that's been going up in the neighborhood for quite some time now. I'll take it!

@WehDs_World Again, feel free to disagree. But then let's hear your suggestions because the status quo isn't working. Thanks for the debate!
@WehDs_World Retail faces those same challenges in every city in America, and yet is doing especially poorly in Minneapolis. Why do you think that is?
@WehDs_World And re: "top city," I don't think #17 nationally for growth is a good sign.	https://t.co/gjgBHOZ6zr
@WehDs_World Here's the expert opinion on our city's infrastructure – they've been telling us for years, but we refuse to listen.	https://t.co/ee3XRI5YIs
@WehDs_World Sounds great, but it doesn't support healthy retail in our city. And it's only below zero once per year on average, so I say we bundle up.
@WehDs_World If I thought it was possible to have it both ways, I wouldn't be doing this – trust me.
@WehDs_World And it's not just my opinion re: the skyway system – many urban designers share the same assessment and have already told us so.
@WehDs_World If you don't like my idea, that's fine. But then let's hear yours.
@WehDs_World My motivation is revitalizing our city and positioning Minneapolis for continued success into the future. Seems like a worthy goal, no?
@WehDs_World I assure you there's no driver and I walked to work through DT Minneapolis for two years when I worked at Target – never used the skyways.
@BayerRyan1 That's a martini, friend.

@DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho And we should be doing it now even with the skyways, but we're not.
@DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho We absolutely have to make our streets safe and accessible year-round for all citizens before considering taking the skyways down.
@DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho You've made your point, and it's a point I recognized and highlighted as crucially important in my Strib OpEd.
@adambelz @mspbjHalter If you're standing in a place where there's wind, you've already picked the right side on this one.
@adambelz @mspbjHalter Winter is on the rise...everyone's talking about it.
@DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho I understand what you're saying, but I don't think a lack of funding is the issue. It's a matter of prioritization.
@GettingGophery @adambelz We're working on that! cc: @greatnorthern
@adambelz July's a little hot for me. 😉
@DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho Lastly, how about we as a city decide to fund and perform winter street maintenance and snow removal because it's the right thing to do?
@Z_Larsen12 @DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho The problem is that there's no interest among next-generation retailers in opening Downtown Minneapolis stores and backfilling empty spaces.
@Z_Larsen12 @DJAMWF @NewDoctorWho The problem isn't that we're losing Macy's and Barnes &amp; Noble – I agree those businesses are struggling for many reasons.

@jgulden I remember you from before, dude. Two smart people can have a healthy debate without getting into an IQ and vocabulary pissing contest. https://t.co/5goN1NWKdp
@jgulden Happy to have this debate, Josiah – it's an important one. But I'm not being obnoxious and I would ask for the same courtesy from you.
@jgulden That said, were not really competing w/ NYC and SF for talent. Here's how we stack up against our peers. With data.	https://t.co/d26fu5hSMX
@jgulden I do invest in local startups, but tech isn't my expertise – sorry. Agreed that our entrepreneur / VC ecosystem needs work, too.
@jgulden Let me know if you come up with something – I'm all ears, thanks.
@jgulden What would be compelling quantitative evidence, in your opinion?
@jgulden This assessment is from someone who has spent a career covering Minneapolis retail: https://t.co/dLBQ390UHG
@jgulden I'm not trying to bring back Macy's, Josiah – that's the past. I'm trying to attract Zara, Uniqlo, etc.
@jgulden And I know that because I've talked with the commercial brokers whose job it is to attract those retailers to our city.
@jgulden It's that we're failing to attract the next-gen retailers that are thriving and opening stores to backfill. And the skyways are the reason.
@jgulden And I've read that. Retail is struggling across the country. The issue isn't that we're losing Macy's and B&amp;N.
@jgulden This is worth a read if you'd like to better understand the issue:	https://t.co/ee3XRI5YIs
@jgulden What I know is that every city in America is dealing w/ Amazon and malls, and we're an outlier re: the sad state of retail in our downtown.
@judyinplym We agree on that, Judy! Glad to have this conversation – it's an important one. And I'd be happy to continue it offline anytime.
@judyinplym I appreciate the efforts of Greater MSP and wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think it was in the long-term interest of our shared goals.
@judyinplym I recognize that it's your job to put a positive spin on Downtown Minneapolis. But many objective observers are concerned, myself included.

@Ryan_MN I'm sorry to hear it, Ryan.
@skywaymyway @JDDroske @DeRushaJ @leifpettersen The issue isn't that Macy's and B&amp;N are leaving; those are macro trends. It's that there's no next-gen retail interested in backfilling.
@DeRushaJ @skywaymyway @leifpettersen I talked to the new owners of the Macy's / Dayton's building. They can't GIVE AWAY space on the ground floor. It's insane.
@DeRushaJ @skywaymyway @leifpettersen Agree 100%. The spaces need to be chopped up, and if there was demand from smaller retailers, they'd do it. But there's not demand.
@skywaymyway @DeRushaJ @leifpettersen I've talked with commercial brokers. The #1 obstacle to attracting great retail to downtown, which is their job, is the skyways.
@skywaymyway @DeRushaJ @leifpettersen Rent per square foot on the street is actually lower than in the skyways. That's not the problem.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen It would be an absolute ghost town! As I said, happy to discuss further offline. Thanks again, Leif – this conversation is important.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen Cities need energy, and that comes from pedestrians as well as vehicles. Imagine our streets now, with skyways, but without cars/buses.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen But after talking with urban designers, turns out that experiment has been failing in cities all over the world.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen Re: the pedestrian-only idea, I had the same instinct at first. Let's at least take buses off Nicollet Mall, right?
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen Given the choice, and it is a choice, I'll take "busy streets with glimmering shops" all day long!
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen And by definition, when they are being used, it's not street traffic. They are the enemy of bustling streets.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen In my experience, they're often not used by visitors / tourists because they're confusing.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen By your logic, if skyways were that feature we should have bustling streets now. But we don't.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen Re: your defense of skyways, I agree that Downtown needs unique destinations that will help drive traffic.
@DeRushaJ @leifpettersen This is a good piece, Leif, and I'd be happy to discuss in person anytime. A few thoughts...
Can't. Unsee. This. https://t.co/W7RfJNSSOS
RT @johnmoe: Last night I found out the Atlanta skyway system is derisively referred to as the Honky Tubes and now I'll never be sad again.

@noah_omdal And the long-term economic health of our city isn't an issue that only benefits some; it impacts everyone.
@noah_omdal I'm working on that, too – stay tuned. It's possible to care about more than one thing.
@ktjomurphy Thanks for weighing in, Katie – I appreciate it.
@Pieperbole I get it – it's cold. And going without skyways is a sacrafice. But I truly believe the payoff will be worth it or I wouldn't be doing this.
@Pieperbole Did it for two years when I worked for Target – I never used the skyways. And I do it now every day in the North Loop.
6. I don't expect everyone to agree with my plan for Downtown. But then let's hear yours. Because we need one; the status quo isn't working.
5. And lastly, a friendly reminder that Stockholm and Copenhagen are not "southern European cities."
4. The skyways are the enemy of that experience – the energy, the sense of community, and the quality of offerings.
3. People aren't moving downtown for the skyways. They want the best of city living: cultural institutions, restaurants, and shopping.
2. However, the fastest-growing downtown neighborhoods (North Loop and Mill District) are not connected by or to skyways; they're walkable.
1. I agree that continued residential growth is essential to Downtown's future. It's one of the best things happening in our city right now.
This is a very thoughtful counter-argument. A few observations in reply...	https://t.co/5op66k0TOK
@btaitt @thatlevi If I thought anything less than taking down the system would work, I wouldn't be doing this – trust me.
@btaitt @thatlevi As I said, this challenge requires entrepreneurial thinking, which by definition means taking calculated risk. And that's how I view this.
@btaitt @thatlevi https://t.co/gjgBHOHvaR
@btaitt @thatlevi I can't give you a sure thing, but I've provided multiple expert opinions and here's evidence that what we're doing now isn't working...
@btaitt @thatlevi You don't have to agree with my vision for Downtown, but then let's hear yours. Because (in my opinion) the status quo is unacceptable.
@btaitt @thatlevi Here's a pretty comprehensive argument on why it's the right thing to do. 	https://t.co/ee3XRInzA0
@btaitt @thatlevi It affects everyone, and there are ways to mitigate those effects. We'll all share in the sacrifice and all benefit from the greater upside.
@btaitt @thatlevi And if we really valued those members of our community, we'd be properly clearing and removing snow from our sidewalks and crosswalks now.
@btaitt @thatlevi So we're the only cold-winter city in the world that cares about people with disabilities? I find that hard to believe.
@bloisolson @PatKessler @DanBarreiroKFAN Membership is dwindling...
@WesleyHOlson @barbsalem @kare11 @jayolstadtv And even if that were true, there has to be a more effective and targeted way to control parking prices than the skyways, no?
@WesleyHOlson @barbsalem @kare11 @jayolstadtv Due to increased demand?
@WesleyHOlson @barbsalem @kare11 @jayolstadtv Sorry, Wes, but I'm not sure I follow your logic.
@barbsalem @kare11 @jayolstadtv I agree that's one of them. We also have too few offerings worth parking for at the moment. And that's the result, in part, of the skyways.
@WesleyHOlson Okay, now you're pushing your luck...
@WesleyHOlson This will be private investment with a long-term ROI to building owners.
@WesleyHOlson Awesome. How about an indoor Eataly-style food hall? The parking one is trickier, but I'll think about it...any ideas?
@SophieLSnyder You're not the first and I'm sure you won't be the last. Thanks for engaging in the conversation – it's an important one for our city.
@SophieLSnyder @WCCO This is a pretty comprehensive article on why they are at least a big part of the problem, if you're interested: 	https://t.co/ee3XRInzA0
@SophieLSnyder @WCCO What you saw in NYC doesn't mean foot traffic not still essential to retail. We can't change Amazon, but we can rethink our infrastructure.
@SophieLSnyder @WCCO as a city in terms of how bad things are. Those macro trends are compounded by the skyways.
@SophieLSnyder @WCCO I agree there are macro forces creating challenging environment for retail, and acknowledged them in my piece. But we're still an outlier...
@yesjonstark *all I've heard
@yesjonstark You don't have to like my vision for Minneapolis, or agree with it. But then let's hear yours. Because we need one.
@yesjonstark I assure you I'm listening. And all I'm hearing are personal attacks and people dismissing the argument instead of countering it.
@yesjonstark I addressed accessibility and small businesses in my piece. As for the poor, they're currently the only ones on our streets (not by choice).
RT @kare11: Op-ed from @ericdayton reignites debate over Minneapolis skyways. Helping or hurting? @jayolstadtv reports at 10	https://t.co/u…
@SophieLSnyder @WCCO Come on, Sophie – you can do better than that. I'd welcome your opposing argument. Interestingly, I've yet to really hear one from anybody.
@smburns Thanks for your support, Scott!
@NewDoctorWho Anyway, I'll leave it at that. Thanks for considering my perspective, Curtis!
@NewDoctorWho It's a great office tenant. But we're talking about retail, no? As I said in my piece, we're actually seeing good office trends.
@NewDoctorWho The causation part comes from Downtown commercial brokers who have told me skyways are the reason they can't attract those tenants.
@NewDoctorWho It's not that we're losing Macy's and Barnes &amp; Noble. It's that we're unable to attract Zara, Uniqlo, Apple, and others.
@NewDoctorWho I agree. But we're not attracting next-generation retail to our downtown the way other cities are because of the environment skyways create.
@NewDoctorWho That's true for now. But our youngest is 40 years old. And I think that tech claim is a stretch – again, for now.	https://t.co/4KQ9STTCyH
Tune in to @kare11 at 10pm for a conversation with @jayolstadtv on urban design, the skyways, and the future of Downtown Minneapolis.
@NewDoctorWho Here's my full argument, Curtis, in case you haven't seen it: https://t.co/46sqbXOAHM
@NewDoctorWho @jbeckerfinn then I don't know what is. I personally don't think the status quo is working, but you're welcome to disagree.
@NewDoctorWho @jbeckerfinn If public safety, a healthy retail ecosystem, and positioning our city (and thus state) for continued economic success aren't compelling...
@jbeckerfinn As I said, this requires entrepreneurial thinking and I know we're capable of that as a community.
@jbeckerfinn I'm not suggesting it's simple, Representative. But let's commit to a solution that works for everyone and is not devastating for anyone.
@jbeckerfinn I know because so many other cities around the world, ones with cold and snow and winter, are succeeding without skyways. We will, too.
@jbeckerfinn It's a challenge, but not impossible if we commit to it. And the cold can be addressed, too. None of this is easy, but it can be done.
So proud to see my friend Joe Heron of @CopperAndKings recognized for his vision, talent, and hard work. Cheers!	https://t.co/txLxxw3icy
@NewDoctorWho That's a fair challenge and, as I said in my piece, it's an essential part of any plan to make this change.
@NewDoctorWho Many other cities with winters and snow are doing a better job than us w/o skyways and we should learn from them.
@NewDoctorWho I don't pretend to know what that's like, Curtis. But we can start by better maintain our downtown streets and sidewalks during winter.
@snyde043 @LindaIHiggins @StribLopez I recognized and addressed that concern specifically in my piece within constraints of the word limit. Certainly more thought/detail needed!
@jbeckerfinn I recognize and respect those concerns. We can start by maintaining our streets and sidewalks in winter to reduce dependence on skyways.
@LindaIHiggins @StribLopez Agree 100% it starts with that. And if we really valued all members of our community, we'd be doing those things now! (We're not)
@LindaIHiggins @StribLopez I recognize that, Commissioner. But other cities with winter and snow have come up with innovative solutions to that issue.
@StribLopez We have many of those now and it's not working, unfortunately. Happy to continue this conversation offline anytime!
@StribLopez And if I thought we could have it both ways, I wouldn't be doing this – trust me.
@StribLopez I recognize their value 100%, but do we really value them above all else?
@StribLopez You can't think of ANY reward that would be worth that sacrafice? I find that incredible, Patricia.
Question for skeptics: What potential positive outcome from bringing down the skyways would make the loss of comfort/convenience worth it?
@pyry @nickmagrino The big commercial RE firms produce quarterly reports on Downtown...perhaps check their websites?

@nickmagrino @pyry And that's across Downtown Minneapolis, not building-specific.
@nickmagrino @pyry Talk to Downtown commercial brokers. There's currently a lack of tenant demand for street-level space under current (skyway) conditions.
@nickmagrino @pyry But agreed that we need smaller spaces on the street level that are better suited for independent businesses.
@nickmagrino @pyry Interestingly and counter-intuitively, rents on the skyway level are currently higher than on the street.
@nickmagrino @CallaghanPeter I look forward to reading this, Nick – thanks!
@benoberg @bonniesota Good to have you, Ben – thanks!
@benoberg @bonniesota I just did. Building owners will see long-term ROI with an overall healthier retail ecosystem, meaning lower vacancies and higher rents.
@benoberg @bonniesota I'm not proposing the use of tax dollars, Ben. Skyways are privately owned by the buildings they connect.
@kirstenbarta Count me in.
@kirstenbarta That's a bigger issue and certainly requires more attention...I wish I had the answer. But I'm very sorry to hear about your experiences.
@kirstenbarta I can't promise it will eradicate harassing behavior entirely, but I hope that be surrounded by others for support will be a positive step.
@kirstenbarta Either way, an environment feels unsafe/uncomfortable when there aren't others around. So I hope to achieve safer streets through numbers.
@kirstenbarta I hear you, Kirsten, and take that concern very seriously. I've heard from others who have had threatening experiences in the skyways.
Deal. https://t.co/KwIAmghZnx
@Seth_Kaplan @greatnorthern And they always will! But others want better quality of life while still having the energy and offerings of a city. That's where we can win.
@Seth_Kaplan @greatnorthern We're not competing against the biggest cities. We're up against Denver, Austin, and others our size.
@Seth_Kaplan @greatnorthern Amen!
@Seth_Kaplan We're certainly not in a crisis, but complacency is the enemy. So let's celebrate our strengths while tackling our issues head-on.
@Seth_Kaplan Every city in America is having this conversation. And if they're not, they should. It's a competition – there will be winners and losers.
@Seth_Kaplan @greatnorthern How do we stop apologizing for and hiding from our winters, start embracing them as a unique asset? I think that's the winning strategy.
@Seth_Kaplan Those are all factors to be sure. I think a lot about recruiting, too – that's one of the motivations behind @greatnorthern.
@Seth_Kaplan But we're lagging behind other cities our size. And Portland, Seattle, and Denver have winters, too. There's always an excuse to be made!
@Seth_Kaplan Thanks again, Seth!
@Seth_Kaplan One metric to consider: https://t.co/gjgBHOHvaR
@Seth_Kaplan @JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio Hah, whatever works! Thanks for a good conversation, Seth – to be continued.
@Seth_Kaplan @JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio That sounds great! If I thought it was possible, I wouldn't be doing this.
@Seth_Kaplan Those are real challenges. But other cities across country face the same ones and are doing better than Mpls. The question is why?
@Seth_Kaplan @wccoradio This is a good summary of why they're central to the equation: https://t.co/ee3XRInzA0
@Seth_Kaplan @JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio I don't disagree. Let's expand that microsystem to a healthy Downtown ecosystem. And with skyways, that's impossible.
@Seth_Kaplan @JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio I'll happily embrace that challenge, Seth – it's good motivation.
@Kovacsforward7 @JBGo4Fan @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio It's a healthy debate. If you think the status quo is working, then let's keep doing what we're doing. I think change/improvement is needed.
@JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio I'm working on it and would welcome your effort and ideas, too.
@JBGo4Fan @Kovacsforward7 @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio Right. And as I've said, this issue is about creating a city that attracts talent and is positioned for future growth.
@Kovacsforward7 @JBGo4Fan @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio Good thing we're tougher than New Yorkers. ;-)
@Kovacsforward7 @JBGo4Fan @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio Too much there for Twitter, but short answer is both. Plenty of cold-climate cities (NYC, Chicago, Stockholm, etc) thriving w/o skyways.
@Ajohnson85 I lived Downtown for the past 11 years and am a property and business owner in the city. I've got a lot of skin in this game, Andrew.
@JBGo4Fan @wccoradio Also, this is a good article on the subject: https://t.co/ee3XRInzA0
@UncaWilbur @StarTribune Okay, that one was pretty good.
@JBGo4Fan @LindsayGuentzel @wccoradio Respectfully, I disagree. Plenty of other cold-winter cities do without them, and are doing better for it.
@JBGo4Fan @wccoradio I've heard it directly from commercial brokers whose job it is to attract retail tenants to our city.
I'll be on @wccoradio in 30min talking skyways and the future of Minneapolis with Chad Hartman – tune in!
@MatthewBick @StarTribune I think it's a neighborhood of Downtown Minneapolis, adjacent to the city's CBD.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune The North Loop is on a good trajectory, but we're not there yet – it's early and still a ways to go.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune No, a strong Downtown is essential to the growth and success of the rest of Minneapolis. Important for the whole state, too.
@AliShops Thank you, Ali! And thanks for your continued support of this idea.
@LindsayGuentzel Sounds like we're all set – thank you, Lindsay, and I look forward to the conversation!
@slbeatty @askovfinlayson Yes we do! Not many left, though, so I'd call the store to check on specific colors: 612-206-3925. Thanks!!
Thanks for taking time to considering my argument. I don't expect everyone to agree, but I'm glad we're having this conversation as a city. https://t.co/05gefQYzBC
@MatthewBick @StarTribune Every city is unique, of course, but a number of cities are rethinking skyways and some are taking theirs down: https://t.co/kxYQRKFc7s
@MatthewBick @StarTribune The studies aren't publicly posted, unfortunately, but here's a good place to start: https://t.co/ee3XRI5YIs
@MatthewBick @StarTribune And it's worth noting that other cities around the country face those same macro trends/challenges and are doing a lot better than we are.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune Look, there's no silver bullet. I just think we need to take a hard look at our city and consider making real change if we want real change.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune And that's supported by national retail consultants who have studied Minneapolis as well as conversations with local commercial brokers.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune If I had to pick one thing to change, it would be the skyways.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune Skyways are big part of the problem there. We can't just hope for great retail; we have to create environment that attracts and supports it.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune It's also the lack of back-fill from the next-gen specialty retailers Downtown claims to want to attract. They just aren't interested.
@MatthewBick @StarTribune Thanks for weighing in, Matthew – it's a healthy and important debate for sure! My concern is not just the departure of big dept stores.
@wogggieee @StarTribune We'll see...some of them are more enlightened and forward-thinking than you might expect.
@bskitully I've explained why I think this is worthwhile. Fight for causes important to you and I'll do the same; this certainly isn't the only one.
@wogggieee @StarTribune Fair point! There will be an investment required, but I believe it's in the long-term financial interest of building owners.
@jonestony I like your plan, Tony – let's do it.
@Ali_Lucia @StarTribune Thanks, Ali!
@jennaboren262 @StarTribune Thank you, Jenna!
I'll take it! But is there anything less North than the skyways? If we're going to talk the talk, then let's walk the walk. https://t.co/l3eCKSBY5A
@arikhanson @RickNelsonStrib However, the current condition of Downtown is an obstacle to attracting the talent we need to drive existing companies and start new ones.
@arikhanson @RickNelsonStrib Of course they aren't directly responsible for the Fortune 500 drought, nor are they a silver bullet for solving the issue.
@arikhanson @RickNelsonStrib That's not the argument I made, Arik. I said skyways are directly responsible for the sad state of retail and impact safety, too.
@jeffmklein @StarTribune Thank you, Jeff! I appreciate the support.
@Williams01Dave @entertain_mn You certainly don't have to agree with me, Dave, but it's not impossible.
@eashoffman Thank you, Beth!
@noah_omdal @StarTribune I trust Minnesota women can handle it!
@NobleIdeas Someone has to take the first step, but it's up to the building owners, not the cities.

@jamiemmarshall The current issue isn't zoning; it's a lack of demand. Stay tuned...
@bradwellman @StarTribune In my experience, zero. They're actually really confusing for out-of-towners.
@jamiemmarshall Their economic interests are tied to the health of downtown. A stronger retail landscape means higher rents and lower vacancy.
@JDDroske @StarTribune You and me both, James – thank you!
@scottimus_p Thank you, Scott!
@andrewwagner You've got it backwards, Andrew – I use my businesses to advocate for issues I believe are important.
@jamiemmarshall It's not the city's decision to make; they belong to the building owners. And yes, I think there's a very real chance they'll come down.
This is my vision and hope for Downtown Minneapolis. Thanks to @StarTribune for the opportunity to share it.	https://t.co/ihdtrt67Qi

@ythanpratt Got it, thanks.
@ythanpratt Oh, you're referring to O'Cheeze and others – yes?
@ythanpratt SW? I don't follow.
@ythanpratt I'm working on an op-ed piece re: this very topic at the moment...stay tuned!
@ythanpratt The problem is that we're not attracting anything new, and that makes us an outlier in a bad way among our national peers.
@ythanpratt The problem isn't that Macy's and Barnes &amp; Noble are leaving; that's happening in other cities, too, and reflects bigger issues.
Whether or not we land Outdoor Retailer, it's a good excuse to remind people that Minnesota is a pretty great place.	https://t.co/LnBEiqVJuV
@ythanpratt That said, it's a very nice looking map!
@ythanpratt And improving the system with wayfinding signage doesn't lessen its negative impact on the city. If anything, it makes it worse.
@ythanpratt I guess I respectfully disagree; I think they are inherently bad for Minneapolis. This sums up why:	https://t.co/ee3XRI5YIs
@ythanpratt I've heard from a lot more outsiders who are confused by our skyways than were attracted by them.
@ythanpratt People in most cities don't think twice about walking 10 blocks, even the ones with cold winters.
@ythanpratt They'll have to weigh the cold vs. hassle of reparking and cost of repaying.
@ythanpratt Once parked, I expect most people will continue to navigate the city on foot as they do now. And as they do in other cities.
@ythanpratt I don't foresee someone who works at Target driving to go grab lunch at IDS, if that's what you're asking.

@DeRushaJ You're right - I'm not. At least just add one wintry winter day to your #Top10wxDay list next year? #KeepTheNorthCold
@DeRushaJ Sorry to be that guy, but if we cheer for the decline of winter, it'll be gone before we know it.
@DeRushaJ Agree 100%. Perhaps today is a good opportunity to sound the alarm about climate change, instead of celebrating its effects.
@DeRushaJ You're in luck; we get those here! Add them to your list!
@DeRushaJ So #Top10wxDay of fall and winter are days when it doesn't feel like fall or winter?

@Miquito17 I'm all ears! And it's certainly more than one thing. I'm just glad we're having this important conversation about our city.
@AliShops And predates Amazon, for that matter. But I know you know all this already!
@AliShops The construction has been brutal for Downtown businesses. But important to remember that retail decline predates this project.
@Miquito17 @MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman Yes. Because it's demonstrably bad for our city. Time for real action if we want change.
@Miquito17 @MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman See the current @mspmag for a good assessment of Downtown retail landscape by @AliShops.
@Miquito17 @MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman And I recognize that, but there are other ways to address those very valid concerns.
@Miquito17 @MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman We don't have enough foot traffic downtown to split in two. Healthy retail needs 100%.
@MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman Alternative is a Downtown full of empty storefronts – embarrassing and unacceptable in my opinion.
@MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman I agree with those challenges, but we have to come together as a city and figure this out.
@vinotintojoe @ChefJorgeGuzman @DearDara Yes, but the time is now. And let's not let coldest days of year dictate city's year-round design.
@Miquito17 @MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman Of course they aren't, Michael. But it bifurcates foot traffic, which is bad for stores.
@DearDara @MattLinzbach @ChefJorgeGuzman We blame Downtown's decline on external factors, avoid having a hard conversation about our role.
@DearDara @MattLinzbach @ChefJorgeGuzman That's true. But eventually we have to stop pointing fingers and take a look in the mirror.
@MattLinzbach @DearDara @ChefJorgeGuzman Construction = sharp blow to restaurants whereas skyways = permanent, structural retail headwind.
@patricktcondon Ahem, I can name one...
@ChefJorgeGuzman @DearDara After watching Macy's and B&amp;N announce their closures in rapid succession, I think the bigger risk is not trying.
@sorayadarabi That show is really hitting the spot these days.
@Josh__Bentley @rhett_carlson Thanks, guys! Now we need to create an environment Downtown that's healthy and attractive for small retail.

@SnoblowerBallet @rrchin If you reject the premise that cold = bad, I read that list to say that no one is better at winter than Minnesota.
@bloisolson Don't forget the aquavit.
@mspbjHalter But office / residential without restaurants / retail does not a great city make. I'm aiming high and think we all should.
@mspbjHalter Point taken – I'll happily concede that it's mixed.
@mspbjHalter Happy to discuss further offline over coffee. And in the meantime, check out the piece by @AliShops in the current @mspmag.
@mspbjHalter I know. What we're observing is a slow and steady decline and we're not seeing new businesses backfill for the old.
@mspbjHalter It may not worry everyone, but it worries me and so I'm trying to do something about it.
@mspbjHalter Look at our streetscapes, Nick, with all the empty storefronts. Does that look like a healthy city to you?
@mspbjHalter A few? We've now lost every anchor retail tenant we had.
@mspbjHalter It's mixed, actually. Macro trends for office and residential are positive and encouraging, which is great.
@mspbjReilly Agree 100%; they've had it rough. But construction is a one-time challenge whereas skyways = a permanent, structural headwind.
@maryhamel The fact that we're losing yet another anchor tenant and what we're going to do to make Downtown a healthier retail environment.
And "businesses nearby could feel the pinch from lower foot traffic" is exactly the argument against the skyways, @mspbjReilly.

@MorningWXGuy Will do - thank you, Mike. And that's exactly what I was trying to do re: "that's not a good thing" in your tweet.
@MorningWXGuy And please don't forget the climate change science the next time it's 72 degrees (30 above average) in November.
@MorningWXGuy I'd love to see the local weather reports stick to the science and leave out the negative opinion and editorial re: winter.

@Chuckumentary @jgulden I hear you! But a healthy downtown and strong retail environment require year-round support, even in the winter.
@jgulden @Chuckumentary I'm sure you're very busy. But take time to read article. My interest is health of our city, which I hope we share.
@jgulden @Chuckumentary Self-serving? How so? Here's a comprehensive argument against them. Let's hear yours for.	https://t.co/ee3XRI5YIs
@quick13 I hear you! But there's safety in numbers, so I believe getting more people out onto streets of downtown will help make them safer.
@quick13 We need to make sure sidewalks are cleared and work for all. Is there a cold-climate city that's a leader when it comes to this?
@quick13 I hear the argument about accessibility and it's an important consideration. But there must be a way to solve for that w/o skyways.

@DeRushaJ @dbrauer @MinnPost Easy to say we want small retail downtown. Another thing to create environment that attracts and supports it.
@DeRushaJ @dbrauer @MinnPost It's all tied together. We can talk about the downtown we want, but we won't get it without real change.
@DeRushaJ @dbrauer @MinnPost You won't attract small retail without foot traffic. Grocery stores are different - they're destinations.

@michaelfransen Getting foot traffic onto the streets would be a net gain for Mpls - will benefit existing businesses and attract new ones.
@michaelfransen I certainly have, Michael. But I've also seen how many vacant spaces we have on the street level, and that's a real problem.
@bloisolson @askovfinlayson And if you want to debate the merits of the idea, I'd be more than happy to - you know how to reach me.
@bloisolson @askovfinlayson I promise you it's not a stunt - this isn't about press for our company, but rather the good of the city.
@WallyNorlander Awesome, join us!	https://t.co/KeogWyhnCj
@MatthewBick That's the great dilemma, Matthew! But at least we're all starting to understand that we can't have both.
Caring about the community in which you operate is a central part of running a business. I learned that from my grandfather and @target. https://t.co/gY8q7eahE1
@BelflowerGrp @bryanstrawser @StribRoper We will - I promise!
@BuckeyeGirlMN @AliShops Or at least that's my opinion! But a lot of much smarter experts have said the same thing.
@BuckeyeGirlMN @AliShops They pull the vitality from our streets and create a tough environment for healthy retail by dividing foot traffic.
@cursedthing @askovfinlayson Are there any cold-climate cities globally that are leaders in winter streets accessibility?
@cursedthing @askovfinlayson This is a very important consideration, Laura, and one I'll admit to overlooking when we came up with the idea.
@StinaMo And for what it's worth, when I worked downtown, I walked blocks to work. I'd never ask folks to do something I wouldn't do myself!
@StinaMo I understand their appeal, Christina. I just want people to understand the cost of having them in terms of impact on the city.
@BuckeyeGirlMN @AliShops I understand the appeal, especially in winter, but "vital" is up for debate! Glad we're having that conversation.
@swoodruffmpls @AliShops I think this actually addresses your concern - there's safety in numbers.
@schowtyler @StinaMo I believe we would, Tyler - that's a big part of my motivation.

@Mr_Hilligoss If we create foot traffic, they will come.
@Mr_Hilligoss It won't be easy, but let's start by not using them and go from there.
@lifeofasalem I may not convince you, which is fine. But at least you're now considering the impact of the skyways. And that's a start.
@lifeofasalem Retail needs 100% of the foot traffic 365 days a year to be healthy, not 70% half the year and 30% the other half.
@barbsalem @lifeofasalem Create the right environment and you'll see more options at a range of prices. And the city will have energy again.
@lifeofasalem The streetscape is dead. Skyways bifurcate foot traffic, meaning there's not critical mass on the street level or 2nd floor.
@lifeofasalem @barbsalem Question is: Would you trade a cold walk some days for a vibrant downtown with better dining and shopping options?
@lifeofasalem @barbsalem I understand the appeal and convenience factor, but I think it's outweighed by the negative impact on our city.
@barbsalem @askovfinlayson Well I guess that settles it! I'd love to hear her argument - the downtown retail landscape suggests otherwise.

@BinkleyOnStyle He's a great representative for Minneapolis and the DNC would be lucky to have him!
@GPWDesign @BillToulouse The point is that we don't *need* skyways to survive winter. They're a choice, and a choice with consequences.
@BillToulouse And man do I hope that you're wrong about them coming to the North Loop!
@BillToulouse We can't cherry-pick. We need to tough out the cold days for a downtown that's vibrant year-round. Or we get what we have now.
Essential? Look at the companies choosing the North Loop - Arctic Cat, Be The Match - as a strategy to attract talent. https://t.co/NsZa5eanbu
