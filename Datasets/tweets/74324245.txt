Years vary, but striking stability of last 3 presidents' ave. SOTU audience: Clinton, 45.6 million; Bush, 45.3 million; Obama 45.2 million
President Clinton had highest (66.9 million in 1993), and lowest (31.5 million), SOTU audience of last three presidents.
4-year retention percentage on recent presidents' SOTU: Obama 72%, Bush 109% (but down 30% from 2003 pre-Iraq War address), Clinton 61%
Correction on previous tweet: President Obama's SOTU audience was below both President Bush's and Clinton's fourth address.

#oscar pick for Best Animated Feature: If votes were revealed, Toy Story 3 - worthy of its Best Picture nod - may be only unanimous winner.
#oscar pick for Best Supporting Actor: Christian Bale will and should win for his battles with boxers (and drugs) in The Fighter.
#oscar pick for Best Supporting Actress: The Fighter's manipulative mom, Melissa Leo, will win. Should win (lead actress?): Hailee Steinfeld
#oscar pick for Best Actress: Black Swan's Natalie Portman's descent into dancing (and madness) should will win. Dark Horse: Annette Bening
#oscar pick for Best Actor: Should/will win - Colin Firth, who was ironically pitch perfect in The King's Speech. Dark Horse:Jesse Eisenberg
#oscar pick for Best Director:Should win: Film is a director's medium, so King's Speech's Tom Hooper. Will win: David Fincher for Soc. Net.
#oscar pick for Best Picture: Should and will win in an unusually strong 10 flick field: The King's Speech. Dark Horse (aptly): True Grit
It's rare when a remake tops an the original film. Such is the case with True Grit. Just watched the 1969 version - not even close to Coen's

'Glee,' 'Big Bang's' Jim Parsons rare bright spot for medium of network TV: Cable has been hauling hardware so far at the #GoldenGlobes
#GoldenGlobes Best Drama prediction: Hollywood Foreign Press Assoc. will choose King's Speech, but Social Network will win U.S.-based Oscar
Annette Bening, #GoldenGlobes Best Actress, will now be favored to win an Oscar (if she doesn't split the vote with co-star Julianne Moore)
