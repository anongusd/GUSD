Chman Tom Carper (D-DE) pledges to fight to get the issue debated on the floor. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) skeptical about those prospects.
Sen. @TomCoburn: "Most of the amendments we're going to have on this bill [are] about politics...parochial politics." Policy intertwined.
Sen. Tester (D-MT): "This is about politics. This is 100 percent politics...this is about a political election in November."
Sen. Mark Begich (D-AK) says he would vote on amendment to allow guns in P.O. parking lots right now: "Let's cut to the chase and do it."
Ronald Stroman, deputy postmaster general, said they "strongly" believe current policy banning guns on P.O. property should stay in place.
Paraphrasing @SenRandPaul- vote to send issue to a study would be a vote against rights of law-abiding gun owners. (2/2)
Vote on amendment from Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) to study issue of allowing guns in Post Offices passes Homeland Sec comm. (1/2)
Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT): "I've got more guns than I need, and I want some more." Supports allowing guns in P.O. parking lots, not offices.
