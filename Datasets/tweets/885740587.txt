@JessyCurious Hi is that a way to justify the killing of unborn children. If you and Ppl care drop the aborted killing of babies that have heart beats. Stay with the good stuff lose the killing. Jessy have you been pregnant and had a child aborted, felt the heart beat?
@Wahotaho @PPact @SusanIsAStorm The unborn innocents have heartbeats. All, listen to your children heart beats and count them. That is the same heart that beats, that you hear and feel in the womb!Which of your children do you chose?  What cells are to be destroyed.

@JrLawrenceG @ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight As I recall, it was Chief Justice Roberts who voted for the IRS mandatory punishment payment. He went with the liberals on the court in the interpretation of the language of the law that said a lot about him. It appears he fell to Political push from Obama.
