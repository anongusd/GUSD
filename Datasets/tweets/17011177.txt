A little inspiration on this Friday morning: Stop what you're doing and read this in-depth piece on the bold and necessary work @aijenpoo, @aliciagarza, and others are taking on with @domesticworkers. https://t.co/rWblAfYgFz
Your periodic reminder: Marching is great. Knitting pussy hats is great. Getting together with friends, drinking wine, and writing irate postcards to members of Congress is great. But voting? That's how we transform this country.
Just a few things to keep in mind on this Tuesday morning!
We’ve been talking about equal pay for decades, but women on average still earn just 80 cents for every dollar a man earns. For Black women, it’s 61 cents. For Latinas, it’s 53. If we keep going at the current rate it will take *202 years* to close the global gender pay gap.
The U.S. is the only country in the developed world with no nationally mandated paid family leave. And for a woman earning minimum wage in America, full-time childcare costs an average of 2/3 of her income. This is a crisis.
Next time someone tries to brush aside the issues that affect women’s lives as “social issues” or “identity politics,” remember that nearly 2/3 of minimum wage earners in America are women, disproportionately women of color.
Devoting my President’s Day to making sure in 2020 we get a new one.
Always have loved ⁦@DonCheadle⁩ - this is awesome Cheadle Makes Powerful Fashion Statements On 'SNL' https://t.co/wRHWOg3fQh
@IanSams @adamslily @KamalaHarris @chrislhayes Just sayin’
A few *real* national emergencies:		- Women today are 50% more likely than their mothers to die in childbirth	- Black women are 3-4 times as likely as white women to die in childbirth	- For a woman making minimum wage in America, full-time childcare costs nearly 2/3 of her income
@StaggAndrea @streickercenter Andrea, I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. Will you DM me your address?
From now on, every candidate for every office who talks about working class voters should be required to mention that nearly 2/3 of people earning minimum wage in America are women. https://t.co/C4NKwJJClz
🤔 https://t.co/mCudvHYM3K
Women are nearly half the workforce, more than half of college students, more than half of voters. The issues we care about shouldn't be dismissed as "social issues" or "identity politics" - they should be recognized as central to a growing economy and a functioning democracy.

I'm here to remind every woman who wants to scream into the void right now that you have power, even if it doesn't always feel like it. We are quickly becoming the most powerful political force in America - and together, we can right injustices and change the course of history.
On election day 2018, women were 54% of voters. If that's true in 2020, we will change the political direction of the country.
In 2018, women donated $100 million more to candidates and campaigns than they did just two years earlier, in 2016.
The 116th Congress has more women and people of color serving than ever before. Women made that happen. (📸 @VanityFair) https://t.co/kuKNXw7nL6
Kavanaugh was confirmed by the narrowest margin in 137 years. There is no question that he is a Supreme Court justice today in large part because women do not have political representation. But that's already starting to change.
Yesterday Justice Kavanaugh showed us exactly where he stands on a woman's right to safe and legal abortion. @Slate put it well: his vote in support of an unconstitutional Louisiana abortion law is nothing less than "a declaration of war on Roe v. Wade." https://t.co/S145syckq1

RT @AlenciaJohnson: So we’re clear: There is no such thing as an abortion up until birth. 		The idea that there is legislation to somehow a…
The majority of Americans want abortion to remain safe and legal because they understand that personal decisions about pregnancy are just that - personal - and should be made by pregnant people and their doctors, not politicians.
Let’s not forget that this president has said he believes women should be punished for having an abortion, and pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. So when he talks about reproductive health care - consider the source.
Inflammatory claims like the one America just heard are not only false, they are offensive to people who face pregnancy complications. The people spreading this misinformation have one motive in mind: to ban safe, legal abortion altogether.
Reminder: The vast majority of abortions - about 90% - occur very early in pregnancy. When they do occur later, it is almost always because a woman’s health or life are at risk, or because her pregnancy is no longer viable.
@TheCarolineErv Me too!

We are going to see that what is currently seen as “the women’s agenda” will be seen as “the agenda.” - @aijenpoo
100 years ago, women got the right to vote. We’re still fighting for political equity. We would all be better off if women were no longer seen as an afterthought, but as central to our democracy, our economy, and our culture. #YearOfTheWomen
Q: In 10 years, what would you want to see?	@aliciagarza: I want to see women running the world. I want to see women in power. And I want to see women creating space for more people to have power.
We believe there is something more we need to do, investing in building powerful connections and grassroots organizing connections in the states. So stay tuned for that! #YearOfTheWomen
We held a convening in AZ, where we heard from women who were teachers, Dreamers, students, parents, organizers, newcomers, who were so excited to be together and connect across issues. That’s the work we have to do.
We’re seeing a trend toward a more reflective democracy. We need to continue that trend. - @aijenpoo #YearOfTheWomen
This is a motivating time, and women are raising their hands and saying, “I want to do more.” That’s why we’re stepping up to say: “Okay, we’re going to see what we can do to make this happen.”
There’s racism in this country. We have to continue to lift up and fight that. As people try to divide people, as @aliciagarza said, we have to show people that their issues are tied together. - @dawnlaguens
To go from losing white women by 14 points to breaking even in 2018 is a transformative shift. There was obviously something that was a catalyst for white women and what they were voting on this cycle. Challenge is about moving forward with them. - Molly O’Rourke, @HARTResearch
“It’s a space that is a trusted location to cut through the noise and find the actual information. People are deeply searching for that. It’s one of the best things we can deliver to women to make them the most invoters we can.” - Cortney Tunis, @pantsuitnation #YearOfTheWomen
Sometimes people who live in Washington think the same information being seen here is being seen across the country. One of the most heartbreaking, profound things we heard from women in listening tours is “I don’t even know how to get information about what’s happening.”
If you start to have a majority of white women, connecting with supermajorities of women of color who are leading, you have an opportunity for massive influence, to set the agenda and determine how issues are being talked about. - @dawnlaguens
We need to shift away from transactional politics and zero-sum politics. We need a way to do politics that’s about relationships and building long-term capacity and power. We need a new model for leadership. - @aijenpoo
What this year showed is the marriage of online and offline organizing, the digital tools combined with a deep understanding of people in person. You can’t be the circus, showing up around election time and disappear the next day.  You have to stay on the ground. - @dawnlaguens
And we need to create new avenues for people to act. How do we transform the challenges people are facing in participation? How do we confront those who are literally stealing people’s ability to have a say in the issues that affect their lives. - @aliciagarza
And it looks like speaking to the things women care about. The way our issues are talked about is so narrow it doesn’t encompass the way we live our lives every day. We have to connect to the way people experience these issues. - @aliciagarza
It looks like giving people a way to take action. Bringing people together across communities. People are yearning for a different kind of conversation, to be connected. - @aliciagarza
What does this look like? It looks like organizing in communities that aren’t being touched but are looking for a place to get active. We are meeting people all over the country who are starting their own crews and clubs. It looks like reaching them. - @aliciagarza
We need to build an infrastructure that allows women to be connected, to feel heard, to do this work. As a lifelong organizer, I have never seen the joy and energy coming from women supporting other women right now. This is a nascent movement to build on that political power.
The political system as it is exists cannot absorb, nor is it interested in, supporting this wave of women. It is not built to put up a “Yes, we’re open, come on in” sign. We heard from women in OH, FL, PA, and more who said they weren’t even sure how to get involved.
The women who have come into office were elected to solve problems. @LUnderwood630, a nurse from IL, who has a unique understanding of the health care system. @lucymcbath, who saw firsthand the tragedy of gun violence and how broken our criminal justice system is.

RT @dawnlaguens: So excited to be talking with @CecileRichards @aijenpoo @aliciagarza about this #YearoftheWomen! https://t.co/wCojlSjuxi
We need to build an infrastructure that allows us to be powerful, and be powerful together and for each other. - @aliciagarza
In GA and in FL, we saw a struggle over what democracy looks like and who gets to participate. We should build infrastructure and invest in communities who are doing what we are supposed to be doing, and who are being seduced by an agenda that doesn’t support them. - @aliciagarza
We saw in the midterms that women of color are continuing to do what we need to do to support progressive candidates. For example, in the GA governor’s race, 92% of women of color voted for @staceyabrams. - @aliciagarza
In addition to the wedges, there are vehicles of our democracy that are broken. New and infrequent voters who were motivated to take action at the polls were forced to contend with hours-long lines, closed polling locations in the poorest communities, and more. - @aliciagarza
This administration is doing everything it can to leverage fear and division to stop us. When they see us coming together, they do everything they can to drive a wedge between us. - @aliciagarza
I want to talk about what’s at stake and why it’s important to bring together a coalition of voters who have the most to gain and the most to lose. Women want to transform power in this country. - @aliciagarza
... and if we change laws to ensure women and all people can make their voices heard, women will be an unstoppable force. - @dawnlaguens
In 2018, white women nationally broke 49%/49% for Republicans and Democrats. Our job now is to make sure this trend continues. With women as a majority of the electorate, if white women joined supermajorities of women of color in supporting progressive candidates ...
The biggest change was women. Critically, we saw a shift in how white women voted. In 2016, white women were 42% of the electorate - the largest voting bloc in the country. There was a lot of discussion about the significant history of white women supporting GOP candidates.
This year, PP invested $20 million in 10 states through our March, Vote, Win program. We were a partner in the Win Justice coalition, which targeted infrequent voters. - @dawnlaguens
Of PP’s politically endorsed candidates, 85% won their races this year. They defeated 20 House members with a 0% @PPact rating. And, the cherry on top: 11 PP alumni were elected. - @dawnlaguens
Planned Parenthood Votes and our collective advocacy organizations ran the biggest electoral program ever, and won. - @dawnlaguens
We need to invest in women’s civic capacity - Black women, Latinx women, Native women, suburban women, urban women, rural women, and more - because they are going to transform this country. - @aijenpoo
Women are half of college graduates, half the electorate, 70% of the consumer base. They’re changing our country on many fronts. We’re seeing this happen in a big way in electoral politics. - @aijenpoo
Women are not a monolith. But we saw women from all walks of life step forward - Black women who continued to show up, as well as young, white, rural women who were stepping up like never before. - @aijenpoo
They showed up for a suite of policy issues - they were looking for solutions that can help their families in the long term. Economic security was a real theme that came up as they were talking to people. - @aijenpoo
Domestic workers, caregivers, and others were part of a massive wave this year. We saw them becoming part of a massive wave on the doors, as canvassers, and loving it. We saw a civic capacity and new generation of leadership that cannot be undone. - @aijenpoo
Women are becoming the most potent political force in America. It’s clear not only that we should invest in women as candidates, volunteers, activists, and voters - but that building a hopeful future for our democracy depends on it. #YearOfTheWomen
We also heard that women want to work together, in an interracial, intergenerational way. And women are going to lead on democratic reform - fighting for free and fair elections everywhere.
Together, we’ve spent the last few months listening to women (longtime activists and newcomers alike) in 15 cities. We heard that the issue of women’s equality is highly motivating, and women want to do more than resist.
We worked with groups across the progressive movement, including @PPact and @domesticworkers, to survey their members. Of the more than 15,000 people surveyed, 81% said they were more engaged in 2018 than 2016.
We saw that a majority of women see Trump and Republicans as out of step with their views on key issues, from health care to equal pay to sexual harassment. More than half of women said they wanted the outcome of this election to change the direction of this country.
Women voters and the gender gap fueled Democratic gains in the midterm elections. Women of color remain the most reliable progressive voters in the country. And for the first time, white women split evenly between Democrats and Republicans.
18 million more women turned out to vote in the last midterm election - 4.6 million more women than men - leading to a historic, 23-point gender gap. #YearOfTheWomen
There has been a lot of reporting on women candidates, but less has been written about the role women played as activists, volunteers, donors, and voters. #YearOfTheWomen

@Muddshark @NancyPelosi 🧐
I’m a free citizen - no one has asked me to do this - but I am honestly sick of men going after women any time we dare demand equal power. For all of these reasons and more, I enthusiastically support @NancyPelosi for Speaker.
I will never forget the meeting with her, when I was at PP, where she told me in the middle of that fight that she would not pass the ACA if it banned insurance coverage for abortion. Though many "progressive" men were willing to throw women under the bus, she was not.
She was the Speaker of the House when we passed the Affordable Care Act. As @BarackObama has said himself, we would not have the ACA without her.
When I worked for @NancyPelosi, she had just become Democratic Whip - the first woman of either party to hold that rank. She whipped the caucus to vote against the war in Iraq, even after Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt stood with President Bush in support of the war.
I also find it interesting – though not surprising – that the effort to go after her is being led by four men in Congress.
And that the House Democrats just picked up at least 34 seats – the most in a generation – and she just helped make them committee chairs. https://t.co/gXuvdyGb9s
I find it interesting that there are four leaders in Congress, only one is a woman, and she is the only person who folks are going after.

In the meantime, let's celebrate and lift up the extraordinary women of color who overcame so much to make history last night - including @JahanaHayesCT, @LUnderwood630, and @LucyWins2018, who were elected in majority-white districts.
This is a moment for white women to do some soul searching about how best to "spend our privilege," to quote @MsPackyetti from a few months ago. https://t.co/to3ujD3brn https://t.co/Gf1MOBsnTm
Last night's results are a familiar story for too many, especially Black women, who remain the most reliably progressive voting bloc in the country. Their issues are all our issues, and must be front and center in the progressive agenda - not brushed aside or marginalized.
As a white woman, I'm reflecting on the role we played. In a lot of places, white women failed to support progressive candidates. We have important work to do to be in solidarity with women of color &amp; help others see that racism, sexism, &amp; bigotry are intertwined &amp; hurt us all.
As an organizer, today I'm sending my profound gratitude to all the women who did the work in this election - not only as candidates, but as volunteers, donors, and voters who fueled progressive victories.
This is one to celebrate. Congratulations, @LucyWins2018! https://t.co/a7mEUhgYNA

That is why I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
If he were now being put forward for a Supreme Court appointment, I would feel it was my responsibility - regardless of the humiliation - to raise this long-ago chapter. I would feel this needed to be known before he could be put on the Supreme Court for life.
I have never forgotten it, though until I wrote a book last year, I never imagined saying anything publicly.
I never told anyone. I was totally ashamed, and what would have been the purpose? I never even told my husband, who I’ve been married to for more than 30 years. I didn’t tell a therapist.
When I was working during college, I was sexually harassed by my employer. He was a lawyer, very prominent.

9 in 10 women in the US have used birth control. This is basic health care that should be protected. And you know what? So is safe and legal abortion.

You can read the rest of Kavanaugh's 2017 speech here: https://t.co/Zm7lgX4Pn7
These are just a few of the many reasons why everyone who cares about women's rights, civil rights, worker's rights, and more should be doing everything we can to #StopKavanaugh.
In this speech from 2017, Kavanaugh made it clear where he stands when it comes to having a strict wall of separation between church and state. https://t.co/FRZ7EjzEEk
That's not all. He also praised Rehnquist's criticism of Miranda rights—AKA law enforcement's responsibility to inform you of your rights as a U.S. citizen. ("You have the right to remain silent ... you have the right to an attorney ...") https://t.co/2u2ShK9b80
Kavanaugh lamented that Justice Rehnquist had failed to convince his fellow Supreme Court justices *not* to rule in favor of a constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. https://t.co/sCRuBBnyk1
What we've seen of Kavanaugh's past speeches and writing is also disturbing. In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute just last year (!), he celebrated the dissenting opinion in Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/50QOSpL4PN
Here's how we know: 1) Trump campaigned on the promise that he would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. 2) Kavanaugh has ruled to prevent a young woman in government custody from exercising her right to abortion—and to allow bosses to refuse to cover birth control.
Make no mistake: A vote to confirm Kavanaugh is a vote to wipe out access to safe and legal abortion in America.

White men who mourn the “good old days” when moderates ran the show don’t know or don’t care to recognize just how bad those days were (and are) for women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and more. This country is changing, and the Democratic Party should change as well.
@GrantDeppen @nytimes Yep.
While we’re at it, wouldn’t it be great if an article written about a historic race were authored by at least one woman or person of color? Just sayin.
She overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary, exciting new voters that the Democratic Party needs if it is going to be relevant.

Clarification: His ruling *would have* allowed the government to delay the young woman’s abortion, pushing her pregnancy into the second trimester. Fortunately, the full court intervened and allowed her to access the health care she needed.
Access to safe and legal abortion, birth control, and other basic health care is hanging in the balance. If you’re one of the 7 in 10 Americans who don’t want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, this is the time to call your senators. #ScotusPick
He opposes #obamacare’s birth control benefit, and believes a woman’s employer should be able to decide whether or not her birth control is covered by insurance.
Last year, Brett Kavanaugh ruled against a young, undocumented woman’s ability to access an abortion. His ruling delayed her procedure, pushing it into the second trimester. #ScotusPick

Glad to be @hardball tonight - we need all 5 million people who marched January 21, 2017 for women’s rights to call their US Senators @PPact https://t.co/sUIW0xNeVU
Abortion in America didn’t start with Roe v. Wade, and overturning Roe won’t end it. It will only end safe, legal abortion. #WhatsAtStake
This is the person charged with confirming @POTUS' nominee to the Supreme Court. Call your senator today and ask them to only confirm a justice who supports personal liberty, including the right to safe, legal abortion. #WhatsAtStake
And of course, the unforgettable time he said Obamacare shouldn't have to cover maternity benefits because he didn't "need" them. (Apparently he was past his childbearing years). https://t.co/vPt5TRXSGx
There was the time he claimed that abortion was "well over 90 percent" of what Planned Parenthood does. When fact-checkers pointed out that it's actually 3 percent, his spokesperson responded by saying Kyl's words were "not intended to be a factual statement."
Tonight, @POTUS will announce his nominee to the Supreme Court. It's only fitting that the person tasked with pushing the nominee through Congress is former Sen. Jon Kyl. Today, I'm remembering a couple of his greatest hits ...
So the administration is trying to end maternity coverage, birth control access, reproductive rights...,and now breastfeeding? What additional punishments for women are they thinking up? https://t.co/z0sBvHOgyX

It is essential to call your US senators 202-224-3121 and demand no vote on a new SCOTUS Justice until after November. Let the people speak.
This week we’ve seen power of SCOTUS to unravel voting rights, women’s rights, religious liberty and rights to organize. No confirmation vote should take place until the American people go to the polls in November.
If you appreciate weekends, the 8 hour day, sick leave and health insurance, thank the labor movement. #Union

Clarification – it is unclear the status of taxpayer funding of CA centers. But according to SCOTUS today, lying to patients by fake centers all ok, and lying to women is a protected right.
SCOTUS today: upholds the immoral Muslim ban and says it’s just fine for fake clinics paid for with tax $ to lie to women about their pregnancies and withhold medical information. We’ve got to be ready for November.

Major medical groups oppose - this is government telling doctors they can’t give women full and accurate information about their health care and their rights.
This extreme domestic gag rule has never been implemented in the US. This hasn’t been tried since Ronald Reagan was president. 🦕
Women would no longer be guaranteed the right to health care information from their doctors.
Under this rule, docs, nurses, hospitals could not refer women to safe, legal abortion.

Serving as president of @PPFA has been the honor of a lifetime. Over the last 12 years, we've invested in young people, innovated to provide world-class care, and grown our movement from 3 million supporters to 12 million. We've come roaring back in the face of political attacks.
12 years ago, I almost didn't go to the job interview at Planned Parenthood. I had a long list of reasons why I wasn't qualified. So I did what any grown woman would do: I called my mom. Ann Richards wasn't having it - she told me to get a grip, and thank goodness she did!

Could talk to @GayleKing all day. LOVED doing this podcast! #MakeTrouble https://t.co/bMCiN9H8fa
@Glosssymom I know exactly how you feel! 😱
Yay Dawn! So grateful to have so many fierce and fearless leaders in the Planned Parenthood family! Don't forget to follow @dawnlaguens - she's your new go-to source for all things Planned Parenthood.
Join the fight - follow along with me @DawnLaguens and go to https://t.co/vffwSGYplV to find out how you can get involved.
As Cecile says - “One of us can be ignored. But together, we are a movement, and we are unstoppable.” https://t.co/kdjz6jNQL9
Planned Parenthood started with the simple but revolutionary idea that your body is your own, and if it’s not, then you can’t be free &amp; you can’t be equal. We’ve made so much progress in the last 101 years, but we’re  not stopping until that idea is everyone’s reality.
Really, @PPFA @PPact has never been stronger. Did you know that more than 2 million people have joined up since the election? We now have more than 11 million supporters —organizing, volunteering, telling their stories, running for office, making trouble 👏 https://t.co/uvKHsp3iG1
4. Linking arms and movements. To truly care for the people who rely on us, we have to fight for #DACA, for gun control, for racial justice, for an end to sexual assault and harassment, and so much more. #DreamActNow #NeverAgain #BlackLivesMatter #MeToo #TIMESUP
3. Our biggest-ever midterm program to elect champions for #reprohealth across the country! I can feel it y’all — November 2018 is going to be 🔥🔥🔥https://t.co/qdojzfF86i
2. Going on offense. In the last 8 years, politicians have passed 401 laws restricting access to women’s health care, including safe, legal abortion (!!) But @Guttmacher shows that this year more bills have been passed to actually expand access than to restrict it.
1. Innovation: we’re using telemedicine, chat &amp; virtual reality to eliminate barriers that prevent people from getting care &amp; info they need, like our award-winning period tracker Spot On. Soon, we’re launching an app to send birth control &amp; UTI treatment right to your door.
These are a few of my favorite things happening at @PPFA, @PPact and across our movement:
Working with Cecile has been a blast and I’m sad to see her go but excited to see what she does next. All of us at Planned Parenthood will still be here every day, providing care &amp; education, defending &amp; expanding access to reproductive health care.
Fun fact: My wife and I have triplet teenagers — 19 year old girls (Yes, we are very tired). 		Not-so-fun fact: The girls turned 18 on Election Day 2016. Definitely not the birthday present they wanted.
A little about me: I’ve been working with Cecile at PP for more than 8 years. As EVP &amp; chief brand officer, I have one of the best jobs at PP. I work with leaders across Planned Parenthood to protect &amp; expand access to #reprohealth for all, including our 2.4 mill patients.
I have the tough (but fun) job of serving as Planned Parenthood’s spokesperson while we look for an amazing new president. So if you want to stay up-to-speed on the happenings at @PPact and @PPFA, follow me over at @DawnLaguens.
Hi Cecile fans - I’m @DawnLaguens &amp; I’m taking over Cecile’s twitter for a couple hours to tell you about exciting things happening at Planned Parenthood! This is me (with Cecile, of course). https://t.co/We9dwyYYZ1

RT @PPact: Today, on the #ACA's 8th birthday, we finally have a spending bill that protects women's health after months of partisan attacks…
Happy 8th birthday to the Affordable Care Act! Before the ACA, being a woman was a pre-existing condition. After the ACA, 62.4 million women gained access to birth control, well-woman visits, breast cancer screenings, Pap tests, and more without a copay. #ProtectOurCare
I hope that we leave here even more inspired to fight for all people. Because nobody is free until everybody is free. #EqualityConvention
Today, we are all going to have to be bold and do more than we ever thought we could. It's time to get outside our comfort zones. If you're not scaring yourself, you're probably not doing enough. #EqualityConvention
With the help of our 11.5 million supporters and counting, the doors of Planned Parenthood have stayed open, serving more than 8,000 patients every day. #EqualityConvention
We are proud to provide hormone therapy in 20 states and counting. And to provide inclusive, non-judgmental care at every single one of our health centers. #EqualityConvention
You can come to Planned Parenthood to get testing, treatment, and the support you need in the privacy of our health centers. Or even at your favorite local gay bar, where our staff has been known to be doing testing on Saturday night at 1 A.M. #EqualityConvention
We believe health care isn't a privilege. It's a fundamental human right. #EqualityConvention
At @PPFA, our motto is "Care no matter what." No matter who you are or who you love. No matter where you live or how much money you make. No matter your race or gender identity or immigration status. #EqualityConvention
I am proud and honored to be speaking at the @HRC #EqualityConvention. Together, @PPact and @HRC will work to restore sanity to the White House and justice to America.

So thank you to @GovMurphy and to everyone who made this moment possible.
Yesterday, our health center manager in Trenton, NJ said "We are very community-based. We service a huge population of women who clean houses and work retail and don't make enough hours to qualify for company insurance plans—those are the women this funding will help."
It's not enough to just battle against the bad policies. It's time to push for good ones.
At Planned Parenthood, we want to make sure other states follow New Jersey's lead. So we recently launched Fight Forward, an initiative aimed at expanding access to reproductive health care in all 50 states.  		https://t.co/rYE361uhOU
Not to mention, he reinstates the right of New Jersey women, men, and young people to choose Planned Parenthood as their health care provider.
With the signing of this bill, Governor Phil Murphy restores state funding for life-saving care, including cancer screenings, STI testing, breast exams, and more.
For eight years, women and families and young people were denied reproductive health care because of the former New Jersey governor.

Thank you for joining in this work with me. I can't wait to see what you do next.
Whatever the future holds, I'll always be committed to that revolutionary idea and all those who refuse to settle for a world where women are anything less than full equals.
Through generations of struggle and change, we've been driven by one simple, radical notion: No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body.
Planned Parenthood has been at the forefront of progress for the past 100 years, and we'll be leading the charge for the next 100.
I'm so proud of what we've accomplished together—in the past year alone, we've defeated three “defund” attempts and helped build a movement that has led to a record-number of women running for office.
It has been the honor of my life to fight alongside the clinicians, advocates, volunteers, and staff at this incredible organization.
After 12 years, I will be stepping down from my position as president of Planned Parenthood this year. https://t.co/L6ttLDjyS1

Even with that knowledge, Scott Lloyd – an anti-women’s health extremist who Trump inexplicably placed at the Office of Refugee Resettlement – blocked Poe’s legally protected access to abortion.

Thanks to birth control, more women in our society graduate, innovate &amp; lead than ever. It’s basic health care - and it benefits us all.

RT @ASlavitt: In a nutshell, targeting abortion provision is political, not budgetary.		Oh, and defunding @PPact hurts women. https://t.co/…

Poetic: the worst bill for women's health in a generation - written without women - is now failing without women. https://t.co/wKRUxrILvr
They're struggling to get the votes for this bill … but they won’t stop attacking our health care. 		So let's keep fighting back.
We're defying the odds, thanks to you — but we can’t let up. https://t.co/lBHn6TsWnt
The newest bill would take coverage from 32M, double premiums … and block people covered by Medicaid from care at Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/f8iM5Fb6y8
Because you marched, rallied &amp; called, senators said last night that they lack the votes to pass #Trumpcare.		But this fight isn't over.
Apparently, stripping 22M of their health care isn't extreme enough - so now, some senators want to force a vote on an even worse bill.
Fact: Without Planned Parenthood, many patients would have nowhere else to go for care. https://t.co/3xPUD31hB2

But it also means we have two more weeks to call, speak, #StandWithPP and fight to stop Trumpcare. 📞 https://t.co/9szWI6uzhh
The Senate just canceled 2 weeks of August recess. That means it has 2 more weeks to try to sneak Trumpcare through… https://t.co/G3ExMFz1C9
Meanwhile, #YesRussiaButAlso Trumpcare - the worst bill for women’s health in a generation - is still in the Senate. https://t.co/IZu4wyUHi2
So when officials cite junk science to justify blocking access to no-copay birth control, that's appalling. https://t.co/xYNN2klnyS https://t.co/IJXeq7iWAB
Birth control is essential to women's ability to plan their families - and so much more. https://t.co/BH9chb8RFS
If more members of Congress could get pregnant, we wouldn't need to explain why birth control is so important. https://t.co/fRdLlJVyqg
Birth control is health care. 55 million women can access it with no copay thanks to the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/ERsaUre03G
For example: #YesRussiaButAlso, extremists in the Trump administration are taking aim at no-copay birth control. https://t.co/xYNN2klnyS
Tons happening in the news, but let's remember: long-term, what may matter most is what happens to our health care behind closed doors.

The news in Iowa is heartbreaking. We can't let Congress do this to the country. That's why it's critical to act.
Thank you to the doctors, nurses and staff working so hard to ensure we keep serving as many patients in Iowa as we can. You're heroes.
We will never stop fighting to ensure that our patients receive care. But dangerous laws like this leave many with nowhere else to turn.
Here's what that means: nearly 15,000 people will lose access to the doctors and nurses they trust. https://t.co/DMQ6NAUzwf https://t.co/dwCDSuZ9Cd
Today, a devastating "defunding" law in Iowa is forcing 1/3 of our health centers in the state to close.
Thank you for calling, organizing, showing up. It’s working. But the fight isn’t over - so let’s keep up the pressure: https://t.co/fGqfBhJ8Kc

Trumpcare would strip insurance from millions, force moms back to work shortly after giving birth, and reduce access to birth control.
Slashing Medicaid and blocking millions from getting care at PP will be devastating. And they call that✌️”#BetterCare”✌️?

P.S. Have you called your member of Congress today? https://t.co/24H09MNGW6 #StandWithPP
No matter how many times politicians repeat the lie that people can just go somewhere else, we'll never stop fighting for our patients.
Bottom line: "Defunding" PP would leave many of the patients we serve with nowhere else to go, causing a health care disaster for women.
That's important because for a woman who finds a lump in her breast or needs birth control, waiting months to be seen just isn't an option.
The majority of PP health centers offer same day appointments &amp; shorter wait times compared to other publicly funded providers.
Nationwide, PP represents 10% of safety-net family planning centers, but serves more than a third of women who rely on these centers.
Many community health centers actually refer patients to Planned Parenthood for our expert family planning care.
Health experts have even come forward to reject the idea that other providers can absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. https://t.co/HfGHWJ8xW5
So why can't women just go somewhere else instead of PP? For starters, in many communities, there *is* nowhere else. https://t.co/r1x7BzlZRM
To justify this attack, politicians like @VP, @SpeakerRyan, &amp; @SecPriceMD have repeatedly—&amp; falsely—claimed women can just go elsewhere.
Right now, House GOP leadership &amp; the administration are doing everything they can to force a bill through Congress that would "defund" PP.

If more members of Congress could get pregnant, we wouldn't still be arguing about insurance coverage for birth control.
Fact: PP health centers serve 2.5 million patients each year. If our patient base were a city, it would be the 4th largest in the U.S.
A Planned Parenthood supporter recently suggested sharing a daily fact about who we are and what we do. It was a great idea - so here goes!
America is at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancy &amp; a historic low in teen pregnancy. We should be working hard to build on that progress.

RT @dawnlaguens: The front page of @HuffingtonPost says it all. #GlobalGagRule 😑 https://t.co/aiZHl4KjHg
Our fight is just beginning - for the latest on reproductive health around the world, follow @ppglobe.
The #GlobalGag rule contradicts U.S. values of promoting human rights, international development, democracy, and free speech worldwide.
The world’s most vulnerable women will suffer as a direct result of this policy, which undermines years of effort to improve women’s health.
This will cause clinic closures around the world - resulting in more unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, not less.
The #GlobalGag rule prohibits organizations worldwide from receiving U.S. funding if they so much as refer people to abortion services.
At Planned Parenthood, we will never stop fighting to ensure reproductive health access - in the U.S. and around the world.
BREAKING: As one of his first acts in office, President Trump has reinstated the #GlobalGag rule.

Hot take: We should be celebrating this progress and building on it - not ripping away the health coverage millions have gained. https://t.co/SCVFqifu6y

If you're getting your birth control w/no copay, thank fierce women leaders like @NancyPelosi who fought for full coverage under the #aca. https://t.co/5RZUgBGSeM
An attack on the Affordable Care Act is an attack on women's health, plain and simple. #ProtectOurCare
Birth control is essential to women's ability to plan our families - a goal shared by women of all political parties. #ProtectOurCare
In its first year alone, the birth control benefit of the #aca saved women $1.4 billion. We aren't going back. #ProtectOurCare
At Planned Parenthood, we see the difference the #ACA makes every day in the lives of our patients. #ProtectOurCare
Not without one hell of a fight, they aren't. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/6lYnJhoyv2
