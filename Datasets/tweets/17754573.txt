I don't shy away from those who don't agree with me and will happily speak with you - either here in Stowe where you claim to live, or in Nashville, from which you mailed your correspondence. #MeToo
and know what the vast majority of us are in this work together and we are making progress and a difference. And, A FRIEND, if you find the courage to not hide behind an anonymous letter and want to have an actual conversation,
of the many messages of support and gratitude that I have received from other survivors, friends and strangers of all genders, organizations - including a lovely note from the The Vermont Women's Fund that I received today, and my loved ones,
and discrimination and that you somehow become less troubled by women standing up for themselves and their rights. It's always the right thing to stand up against harmful behavior and I hope you find your way to understanding that. I am going to go reread a few
(https://t.co/kf2tjuXRNs…/woman-gets-60000-second-inntopia-se…/), it seems you still have an intense need to blame women. So, "A FRIEND," since we're friends and all, I hope you're able to educate yourself on the important issues like sexual harassment, assault,
the absurdity of people who still think this silliness works or that I would be bothered by it. Given that you write that you know the individual who harmed me and you describe him as "morally deficit," and he has stories like this written about him like this,
I gotta say, it's a pretty fantastic feeling to know something like this doesn't even sting a little. In fact, the only reaction I had was to chuckle, shake my head, and take pictures of the letter and envelope to send to a few friends and colleagues who would appreciate
though my story predates the online MeToo movement. It's four paragraphs written rather childishly that attempts to chastise me for considering myself a victim (by the way, I don't, I damn sure am a survivor) and takes what I assume is the author's best shot at slut-shaming me.
So, I received a letter in the mail yesterday...yes, an actual letter. It was addressed as coming from "A FRIEND" and is, I guess supposed to be a hurtful letter with the intent of shaming me for coming forward and telling my #MeToo story,

She right. Adults saying this are dead wrong and perpetuating the myth that young men can't understand or control their sexual urges so not responsible for their actions. Stop it. You're excusing sexual assault. https://t.co/J1gyfL6fpL
Trump says he's telling the truth about Russia collusion but is panicked over investigation and wants it stopped.		Dr. Ford wants FBI investigation into her claims. Team Kavanaugh says he's telling the truth but don't investigate.		Why do these "honest" people fear scrutiny?
@CuomoPrimeTime @MichaelAvenatti Come on @MichaelAvenatti, you have to know better than to be out there advocating for sexual assault victims to be publicly outed against their expressed wishes. Please think about what you're suggesting. Survivors choose if and when they will go public.

Please, @SenatorCollins and Sen. @lisamurkowski, insist that time be to given to investigate the accusation of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh. Women were silenced and Clarence Thomas was confirmed. You have the ability to ensure our voices are heard.
From writings of Kavanaugh's character witness:		"If that man is any kind of a man, he'll allow himself to feel the awesome power, the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion,"		"Uncontrollable male passion" is an excuse for sexual assault. Nothing beautiful about it. https://t.co/LYapU3vOK7

- The AG's office and HRC will begin collecting data and tracking the incidence of sexual harassment in our state so we can truly get a handle on the size and scope of the problem.		There's more work yet to be done, but this is a big leap forward!
- @VTWomen will undertake a public, businesses, and employee education initiative to raise awareness of the requirements and protections created by the new law
- Next leg session, report must be produced with recommendations on how to address serial sexual harassers being hidden and protected through the NDAs - essentially creating whistleblower protection for survivors who speak out after learning their harasser has harmed others
- Pre-employment and employment agreements may not include any provisions that restrict the ability to report or limit rights under the law for someone who has experienced sexual harassment
- #VT fourth state to extend SH protection to all classifications of workers, not just employees. So unpaid interns, contract workers, and volunteers are now protected		- The AG's office and Vermont HRC will have an expanded reporting system for sexual harassment
SH harms survivors, other employees, company, and economy overall. Here are a few highlights of the bill:		- #VT is first state to prohibit lifetime employment bans against survivors in settlement agreements - bans covered company AND parent company, partners, affiliates, etc.)

@420Defenders @stuartpstevens @BillCosby @AGSchneiderman It's a mistake to deflect attention off Schneiderman. R policies did not make him a monster. It's more difficult for women to be believed when coming forward w/ accusations against men, like Schneiderman, who pretend to be champions of women. Bringing politics in makes it harder.
@420Defenders @stuartpstevens @BillCosby @AGSchneiderman Who has said this is "men behaving badly?" There is violent, misogynistic behavior across party lines. Schneiderman denies wrongdoing, claims his victims were willingly abused as part of a sex game. This after painting himself as a #MeToo champion and protector. Why defend him?
@420Defenders @stuartpstevens @BillCosby @AGSchneiderman Party is absolutely irrelevant, but claiming that your abuse of women was consensual "role-playing" is not showing any conscience. A person resigning after being caught and denying responsibility for his actions deserves zero credit.
Yes, it's true #NotAllMen. But it is "America's Dad," @BillCosby, and #MeToo champion and NY's highest law enforcement officer, @AGSchneiderman. Predators rarely look the part. Don't take it personally, but many of us have learned it's impossible to know which men are monsters. https://t.co/a4bkgYoDkR

Moore is accused of molesting a child. So, @jaymichaelson, molester &amp; pedophile are not exaggerated labels. Also inaccurate that he drove the 8th grader home and touched her bra &amp; underwear. He took her to HIS house and touched her through those garments. That's a child predator. https://t.co/EqyyMmt4ZJ
