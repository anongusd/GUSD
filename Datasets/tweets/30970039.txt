@lalpert1 @rachelweinerwp @markberman "PACER should cost less" is a very, very good argument. "PACER is the only way to get court records and should be free" is the position I take issue with, partly because it suggests people don't actually know how the courts work
@rachelweinerwp @markberman Records should be accessible, and where fees apply, affordable. I also think PACER alone doesn't tell you what's going on in court. For the same reason a cops reporter who only reads crime reports and doesn't talk to people or go to crime scenes is not a good cops reporter
@markberman They too can go to the courthouse, which is open to the public, and read court records. The court system is amazing and more people should see how it works

@Tom_Winter Thanks Tom
16/Finally, at a time when agents and deputies are doing dangerous work without paychecks, it's worth remembering there are many, many many good people at the Marshals and elsewhere, who risk their own wellbeing to do the right thing
15/Those are policy choices which will have long term effects on what the public knows - and thinks it knows - about how the government works. The arc of the moral universe is long, but in this area it is bending toward nonsense
14/The FBI now has a permanent counterintelligence unit designed to hunt leaks. The inspector general, which once used news stories as a tool to pursue alleged misconduct in government, now eggs the FBI to more forcefully hunt leaks
13/Obviously there's real value in some law enforcement secrecy and some leak investigations. But a great number of the leak probes I come across (or come across me) are spurred by senior officials pissed they might have to answer publicly for some internal controversy kept quiet
12/The FBI, having burned itself, now tries to say as little as possible about as much as possible.  As a result, the public space is increasingly filled by conjecture and conspiracy theories
11/Fast forward to today, and the obsession with leaks has metastasized so far that the 1 area of agreement among Trump, Comey, House Republicans, the inspector general, the FBI, DoJ, and Democrats is that any info about investigations are “leaks,” and all leaks are bad
10/It’s easy for me as a reporter to say “leak investigations are bad” because it makes reporting harder. That’s *not* my point. No one cares if our jobs are harder or easier, and I wouldn't ask anyone to care about that
9/The most forceful response to stories in which law enforcement officials raised concerns that their own people may be violating constitutional protections or committing crimes in a foreign country was to try to stop the stories.
8/The DoJ and IG never said anything about the Mexico questions. The secret ops continued. Later, the DoJ issued stricter new policies regarding how Marshals scan Americans’ cell phones en masse when they search for fugitives.
7/The inspector general told them to drop it, because it was unclear if that person was a source, but crystal clear they were a government whistleblower. The IG asked Marshals if they would instead like an investigation into accusations of their misconduct in Mexico. Crickets.
6/This Thursday, documents were released showing they had focused on one person they suspected of talking to me, seized that employee’s personal electronic devices (legally questionable) and tried to get them charged criminally https://t.co/pO6Y01yoPN
5/After the stories, a senior DoJ official shouted in exasperation at me: “What the f--- does it matter what we do in Mexico?” The main DoJ and Marshals response to the stories was a plumbing effort to stop leaks and punish sources. To be clear, these were Obama years
4/To repeat, sources said deputy US Marshals were engaging in lethal extraterritorial military raids, and then when one of their own guys was nearly killed on such an op, USMS hushed it up.
3/The stories cited internal law enforcement concerns about the legality of air-based sweeps of Americans’ cell phones in major US cities, and detailed secret missions in Mexico that some involved felt had become “kill missions.”

@pbump @AaronBlake historically, the easiest and simplest way in person voter fraud was done in this country (see Albany, NY Dem machine in the 1930's) was impersonating dead people. There are lots of ways that in-person voter fraud doesn't involve stealing an actual voter's vote
@pbump @AaronBlake No, the debate is whether we should use different terms for you lying at a polling place to vote illegally in your own interest, or having someone else lie to you in order to essentially steal your vote against your interest. Different enough to merit different terms
@pbump @AaronBlake Take your argument to its extreme. If someone is shot dead, what does it matter if they shot themselves, or if someone else shot them, or if that person was the intended target? ...It matters!
@AaronBlake is roughly 1000% more right than @pbump -- ballot fraud is very different than voter fraud, because the consequences/solutions/politics of them are so different https://t.co/aEopXsIHc8

And here's the central point: "The defendant has provided substantial assistance in a criminal investigation [three paragraphs of redacted material]." The investigation continues, and Mueller ain't talkin about that
Mueller writes that Flynn's guilty plea "likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the special counsel office and cooperate."
"Several senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions." (presumably that list would include at least Pence and Spicer)
In Flynn sentencing filing, Mueller writes that "senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards."

@maggieNYT True enough and “what to do about hate/conspiracy theories” is a huge challenge for our business and social media. But some killers do this partly for the megaphone it gives them, which raises tough questions (see @cjane87)
@maggieNYT Multiple reasons. For investigation, it can preserve integrity of witness statements if people can’look it up and claim knowledge they dont have. As a policy matter, it can prevent suspect getting days of free publicity for horrible beliefs

final point: any current or former (cough cough) official who claims the FBI has a longstanding blanket rule of not discussing investigations - or not warning reporters that some investigations don't exist - is not telling the truth.
this is a great illustration of the problem created by the FBI's current mantra of "say nothing" about investigations -- even ones that don't exist. FBI Director says he can't talk about even an investigation that doesn't exist

@JamesAGagliano @adamgoldmanNYT Anecdote: When the show "Quantico" came out, I asked a senior FBI person, "aren't you horrified about all this misconduct/light treason by the agents in this show?" And the person said, "The agents are young, ethnically diverse and a bunch are women. That's a win for us."
@JamesAGagliano @FBI agent ranks have gotten whiter, and stayed very male, in recent years. This from a 2016 story: "As of Aug. 1, 83.2 percent of FBI special agents were white, according to internal statistics. That’s a higher percentage than in 2008."

This is a loss for DoJ and FBI surveillance, but one they've been expecting for a long time. Inside FBI, a lot of folks thought SCOTUS would eventually make this kind of ruling, and their goal was to put off the inevitable for as long as possible

@emptywheel @JasonLeopold For many conspiracy theories, USG could publicly refute if they choose, but often choose not to on the theory doing so only fuels theory...

@emptywheel @matthewamiller To paraphrase an old friend, it's not called the "Federal Bureau of Huge Decisions Based on BS"
@emptywheel @matthewamiller then we go figure it out, and find it's laughable. so then Comeyworld says, we always knew that, but made huge decisions based on BS...
@emptywheel @matthewamiller but remember how this started - Comeyworld under pressure for Clinton moves, says, hey, if I could show you this secret doc you'd get it...
@emptywheel @matthewamiller what press should do about BS conspiracy theories is a big topic. short version: rolling over is not an option...
@emptywheel @matthewamiller if your argument is we're powerless in the face of BS conspiracies I simply don't believe that. It took us 3 calls to show Lynch claim false

McCabe: "I don't believe there is a crisis of confidence with the leadership of the FBI"
I'd argue this is important because FBI leadership has not *publicly* acknowledged this, or conceded it affected their decisions re Clinton
McCabe: "there were folks in our agency who were frustrated with the outcome of the Clinton case &amp; some of those folks were vocal"
the committee &amp; McCabe seem to be skirting basic question: Did the FBI adhere to longstanding policy not to discuss probes with White House?
"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI &amp; still does to this day,'' McCabe says, adding "vast majority'' of FBI supported him
McCabe denies FBI rank and file have lost confidence in Comey. "I can tell you that I hold Dir. Comey in the absolute highest regard.''
"Has anyone in the White House spoken to you about the Russia investigation?" McCabe: "No sir.''
"we typically do not answer that question,'' McCabe says re: Trump-Comey convos. But... is anything about this case/situation "typical"?
