*Farrakhan is in the headlines again which means three women of color are being harassed and held accountable for his words.*
A thread (1/3): I will not respond to those who are conveniently using Farrakhan‚Äôs words to dismantle the movement we‚Äôve built yet are silent when those in power attack our people. I will affirm to our friends that I stand with and for my Jewish, queer, and trans family. Always.

In addition, consider retweeting the original question with your answer as the comment above w A1, A2, etc. Have a resource you think is important to share? Tweet that out too. #TimeDone
I‚Äôll ask a series of q‚Äôs &amp; look forward to hearing your answers, comments and thoughts. Each question will start as ‚ÄúQ‚Äù and a #, e.g. Q1, Q2, Q3. Please tweet your answer back respectively as A1, A2, A3 &amp; #TimeDone
I‚Äôm so proud to be a partner of the #TimeDone campaign and to facilitate today‚Äôs important conversation. Thank you for joining us and let‚Äôs get started!
#TimeDone is about reassessing the way we deal with harm and justice. It‚Äôs about not throwing people away by committing to rehabilitation and accountability.
I have always wanted to adopt a child so I couldn‚Äôt stop the tears from flowing moments before I took the stage knowing that we would never be able to do that under current policy. #TimeDone is here to say no more. We must allow people to re-enter society fully
I was backstage at a criminal justice event in DC when I found out from my then-fianc√© and #TimeDone Campaign Director @misterjayjordan that one of the 40,000 collateral consequences on his conviction was not being able to adopt.
#TimeDone has the potential to change the lives of *at least* 70 million Americans who live with convictions. And that‚Äôs not even including the families and communities who will also be impacted.
A big shoutout to my co-host and brother @Mysonne + @Safeandjust &amp; @NYjusticeLeague for their leadership on this issue. #TimeDone

Californians are not going to trade community health programs for Trump-style prison expansion spending. RT to say NO to the #NewJimCrow https://t.co/MEeKIdEgxG
Though Prop 47 repeal supporters call this a safety measure, it is anything but. It would increase spending on prisons, keep more people in prison for longer, and kill the funding for prevention. It's a prison package and we say NO to the #NewJimCrow https://t.co/MEeKIdEgxG
The effort to repeal CA Prop 47 &amp; Prop 57 and expand CA‚Äôs prison system is backed by law enforcement associations and CALIFORNIA COTTON GINNERS &amp; GROWERS ASSOCIATION PAC. Seriously. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Say NO to the #NewJimCrow https://t.co/MEeKIdEgxG
The so-called ‚ÄúReducing Crime and Keeping CA Safe Act‚Äù amounts to a prison tax on Californians to expand the prison system. Take action to say NO to failed, costly and racist prison expansion policies! https://t.co/MEeKIdEgxG
CA is facing a serious threat to the progress our state has made toward fixing the broken criminal justice system. The ‚ÄúReducing Crime &amp; Keeping CA Safe Act‚Äù will increase taxpayer spending on prison expansion. Take action to say NO to the #NewJimCrow https://t.co/MEeKIdEgxG
