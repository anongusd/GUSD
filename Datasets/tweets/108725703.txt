Or if they're in it they're okay with killing babies just to make a few bucks then I think that could be turning the tables and other people can make a few bucks on killing the ones who decide it's okay to kill the babies to make a few bucks turnabout is fair play.
And if there is a court that would decide the killing a baby barely born or getting ready to be born is okay I would rather not be governed by those jurisdictional courts and we should be given an option to opt out of the particular courts where are there laws cannot affect us
And since children cannot go to court or being Court there still is a court that decides life and death and it should go through court before a termination is allowed I don't believe any Court should ever rule to kill a baby while in the womb or outside the womb

Hell there is even a sign on your clothes. Shirt pants and shoes in most cases.  Even tells you what to do to wash the particular item   Signs on your medicine to tell you how to take your meds.  Yes if you have issues with MAGA hat or make America great again  you need help
@RealSaavedra Mental issue one must seek help for,. It's a sign on a hat. How this could upset anyone, should of been considered mental issue at birth. Signs at school a signs while you drive, speed limit signs. Stop signs, by now you'll be a fruitcake if you can't handle a sign on a hat.

To bite off your nose to spite your face is the redundancy of your ability to run an office under an oath an office that has a reason for a constitutional purpose
Tyrancy of not allowing a president to be president is criminal act when you are in office under the Constitution which merely puts the reason and the sole purpose for your job a president in control.  this president has bent over backwards way overboard so you people can learn
