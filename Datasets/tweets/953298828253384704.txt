@Pugs_BTW I'll disrespect who I please. I'm Equal Opportunity.
@Pugs_BTW You linked no polls from any source
@RMProductionXXX Actually hes just retorting with @JeffBezos approved propaganda.
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I speak with high level experts about policy not some Tigger LARPing infantry.
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX Since those areas are massively subsidized by the Fed, growth is inevitable, and you ironically turn your nose up at Midwesterners who were promised relief if the trade wars affected them. They really ain't lying when they say the coasts are packed with hedonist, elitist snobs.
@Pugs_BTW Are those numbers from the same pollsters who said @HillaryClinton had an over 90% chance of winning the Presidency on Election Night 2016?
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm not here to prove what I do and dont know. You're here to prove me wrong, and you're doing a terrible job.
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX All those gains were concentrated on the liberal coasts that you shill for. Only 4 places experienced organic economic growth during Obama's years : NYC, Cali, LV, and the Dallas area. 3 out of 4 of those places vote blue.
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Actually you dont. Having informed discussions with military experts and generals will suffice for me as I focus my niche on other policies that they are not experts in. Understanding policy is not rocket science, though it may be for you.
@HeelStCloud Says the guys shilling for a party like the @DNC that literally stole its bases votes from @SenSanders to give to @HillaryClinton
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I dont need to be in the military to know how awful Obozo's policies were for our armed forces. Besides, how do you rely on a Marxist like Obama who hates America to keep it strong?
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX It took 6 years until 2014 for that bum Obama to get 5% growth. Trump did 4% in less than 2 years. Keep up playa
@HeelStCloud A single dollar of that money was never paid because the trade deals have already been committed to being renegotiated by other countries. But your hatred for 50% of the country though? That's pure agitprop gold.
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Thanks to @realDonaldTrump they will never be a problem again. A shame that he has to come in and clean up the massive failure of Obozo pulling out of Iraq in the first place.
Dont ever forget this is what they think of you my fellow deplorables.... https://t.co/FdfKsusRA8
@HeelStCloud @RMProductionXXX @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Hadn't heard about Osama because Obozo was having massive trouble putting down that "JV Team" that grew under his watch.
@RMProductionXXX Knowing people and taking pics with them means nothing. You are the one accusing without any evidence. No one owns POTUS especially not some broke ass Russian oligarchs. Trump owns them if anything. Do you read?
@RMProductionXXX The regs he pulled back are a good thing. They were stifling our economy by design thanks to Obozo. He destroyed ISIS territorial strongholds, renegotiating trade deals successfully, got us tax cut felt by every WORKER, and he stimulated growth to 4% GDP. We call that #winning.
@RMProductionXXX The Russian Mafia couldnt afford the loyalty of a billionaire playboy like @realDonaldTrump . They have no leverage over him whatsoever.
Well I guess he never loved America because it never showed. https://t.co/l7ZIxD0iOp
@RMProductionXXX Our nation is greater everyday @realDonaldTrump is in charge. Someone had to come in and clean up the massive failures of the departing Loser-In-Chief @BarackObama
@RMProductionXXX I suggest you follow the money trail and it clearly goes back to Fusion GPS and the HRC campaign.
@RMProductionXXX You should be because you vouch for their credibility by stating these news sources as credible.
@RMProductionXXX They didnt verify the story because @CNN is not interested in research or journalism. They are only interested in propagating Marxist propaganda.
#FuckJeff is right. https://t.co/msojLEaWEa
@RMProductionXXX HRC actually paid a foreign national to collude with Russians to develop the infamous dossier, yet silence from you and the media. Instead you choose to hold up baseless accusations instead of scrutinizing the obvious wrongdoings in front of your face.
@RMProductionXXX Trump was a billionaire global businessman before he humbled himself to be POTUS, so theres nothing wrong with this. Having relationships globally is building business globally. Claims of mobsters is sensational, but were you upset when Tony Rezko gave a "gift" to @BarackObama
@RMProductionXXX @JeffBezos owns @washingtonpost so I'm a little confused as to how you say #FuckBezos and "WaPo publishes real news" in the same breath.

@CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Im talking about the very real immigration problem in America, not the violent colonization that fictional Wakanda avoided. I'm saying refugees being imported to America will erode culture and values, the same way T'Challa and the Wakandans feared refugees would do it to them.
@CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump America is the Western power structure, so it's wholly worth protecting to extreme lengths, more so than Wakanda, whose existence is beneficial to no one but Wakandans. In order for that to happen, we need to start protecting Americans and their interests, and Trump is our guy.
@KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Here's a saying, "Truth Hurts".

@KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump I know truth makes your brain melt. That means it's working.
@Luvina_things Obviously that statement was too #woke for you, so you just do a silly laugh. Lol
@CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Is America not a nation of immense wealth, traditions, and cultures that are worth going to extreme lengths to be protected?
@CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @markrmccracken @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump So by that logic, it's fair to say America could be plundered and pillaged if it opened its borders and imported refugees en masse. Your logic states this is a combination of proper historical context and wisdom. Trump is our executive, endowing him with similar power to T'Challa
@Luvina_things They are certainly very alike facing the very same or similar problems, but starting at opposite sides of the spectrum.
@CTConsigliere @Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @markrmccracken @jelani9 I will watch it again. I'll come to the same conclusion. T'Challa will compromise and share some wealth of Wakanda with outsiders. But he will never share Wakanda itself with outsiders or give them access en masse. In this context, @realDonaldTrump is much more compassionate man.
@CTConsigliere @SallyStrange @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump You forgot that they both are patriots and love their country. You may go now.
@GuardianRover @bad_porkchop @BillClinton was paid to give a BS speech to Russia while @HillaryClinton was Secretary of State. All they had to do was promise Putin 20% of American uranium. We call that #treason. And that treason actually happened.

@Mars_Young All our Founding Fathers are born on this continent. They are not foreign settlers. They were the First honorable citizens of a nation they created on a continent that birthed them. That same idea gave me and you citizenship as well. Overtime a few tweaks needed to be made, sure.
@Luvina_things You just keep saying there's no comparisons to make when I claim that they're are many comparisons and similarities to make between Wakanda and America, T'Challa and Trump.
@JustWhatNowWhy @Not_Robin_Hood @Pussy_Riot_USA @omarvaid @RealMGrimm @realDonaldTrump Your candidate @omarvaid is a #SoyBoy.

@Luvina_things So to add to this, the policies of all those rulers before T'Challa, led to a mega wealthy nation, where culture is not under threat, and all citizens are looked after greatly. This is why I'm saying there is certainly merit to those policies they stood for.
@Luvina_things Yes because both men are essentially trying something new in their countries that's never been done before. That's why they're one in the same @realDonaldTrump and T'Challa.
@Luvina_things Every ruler that ruled Wakanda, up until MAYBE T'Challa, operated with @realDonaldTrump proposed domestic and foreign policies.
@AZuefeldt @Luv4AllSpecies @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump It's a valid criticism when they're chasing via witch hunt supposed "threats" and not keeping tabs on actual threats they've been alerted to.
@Luvina_things The contrast I intend to show is that America has not been an isolationist state in a while, and has never been any sort of ethno-state. We have always conducted ourselves opposite to Wakanda. As a juxtaposition to Wakanda, America needs more isolationist and protectionist ideas.
@Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @markrmccracken @jelani9 Why won't T'Challa share Wakanda with the rest of the world instead of just it's wealth, technology, and resources?
@Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @markrmccracken @jelani9 Does he say anything about letting in refugees into Wakandan borders? Does he say he will also trade the weapons technology? Also, why is it Wakanda doesn't take in any immigrants?
@Veritas_Voice #dasboot
@Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @markrmccracken @jelani9 Killmonger and Nakia advocated for foreign aid and trade. T'Challa did not do any of these things at the end. Only the Wakandan equivalent to social outreach. Just because you can't agree with what's happening on screen doesn't make it untrue.
@Mars_Young The continent was settled for almost 200 years before America came into existence. Take your revisionist BS somewhere else. We don't tolerate #FakeNews over here.
@MJCoad  https://t.co/G3rbW0zN9F
@toscomo @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump He actually abandoned none of those things and resorted to compromising on the preferred neo-liberal solution du jour: educational programming. Never let in any refugees, never opened the borders, no foreign aid, and still won't trade the vibranium freely. It all stayed the same.
@Mars_Young I know you have no intelligent retort to this, so with all the mercy in my soul, I'll let you walk away.
@Luvina_things @KariukiMachine @CTConsigliere @markrmccracken @jelani9 Nothing contrarian about the facts that stare you in the face and look you in the eye.
@toscomo @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Just because the line was used in Blades of Glory doesn't mean it doesn't apply to my glorious tweet.
@toscomo @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump T'Challa and Wakanda are practitioners of nationalistic, isolationist, protectionist, and traditional domestic and foreign policies. The same sort of policies @realDonaldTrump campaigned on and won the Presidency on. America First = Wakanda First. Same idea. Except Trump's real.

@mellowken Actually, it's you who obviously ignored the major themes.
@DeftDel @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump That's the truest test if you ask me...
@DeftDel @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump As long as we have the most valuable resources, our status will never change, and the more we restrict resources that are only available to us, the more expensive those resources become, and the more wealth that is brought into our nation.
@DeftDel @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Libya was a paradise before @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton destroyed it. Look up the public entitlements Gaddafis regime would offer Libyan citizens. It's probably the closest of a nation to Wakanda that actually existed.
@AshamedOkie @SenatorLankford You're welcome snowflake.
@DeftDel @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Sure. We can see. But the real test, let's see how many refugees T'Challa let's in Wakanda, with threat of Thanos looming....

@ebonyrose2009 @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Yea. It was literally spelled out to you the entire time. Protect the nation. Protect the culture. Don't let the outsiders in. Dont trade with the undesirables. Dealing with outsiders on their land and doing outreach with bases on their land is acceptable. Those were the lessons.
@theeclarkjones @msyoungelady @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Original Basotho blanket given to King Moshoeshoe I by a British man, meaning the Sotho people culturally apropriated a Western Monarchal textile into their traditional culture. *drops mic* *louder thud*

@DeftDel @markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump All he did was a bit of social outreach. No outsiders or refugees were allowed into Wakanda still, Wakanda still does not trade vibranium freely with anyone, and T'Challa was emboldened to go to great lengths to protect the traditions and culture of Wakanda. Very little changed.

We have always let in outsiders, we have always traded our wealth with outsiders, therefore, it is imperative Wakanda follows America's example, and not the other way around.
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Seems like you would like to allow foreigners to guy America's wealth and allow outsiders to come in and erode our culture. Tsk Tsk. T'Challa would be displeased.
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump You're right. @realDonaldTrump is a real person who has achieved something great, and T'Challa is fictional. Can't get anymore opposite than that.
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Besides, it looks like the barriers made Wakanda the richest nation on Earth. Are you advocating we do something different?
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump That's exactly the ending of the movie. You cant say otherwise lol just admit your wrong.
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Wakanda had a wall to decide it was time to build a bridge. We have all sorts of bridges to America, and no barriers. That needs to change.
@markrmccracken @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 @realDonaldTrump Again, the wall into Wakanda was never lifted in the end, and T'Challa decided to set up outreach centers outside of Wakanda, something the US has been doing since WW2.

That is genius and hard work and grit. @realDonaldTrump is the epitome of the American Dream as @BarackObama had written in one of his thesis for college.

That's not a bad thing. And I don't have to say sorry, you never specified the frame of the data you presented until I pressed you about it.

New York itself is packed with misguided yet comfortable liberals. Staten Island is the last refuge for hardworking, red-blooded Americans. You over in socialist hellscape in Europe can't relate to self-determination and individual responsibility.

@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney @LouisFarrakhan @BarackObama They might have endorsed him because they liked that he liked America as much as Donald said liked America on TV. I don't really know why. Have you asked them? I don't care about the KKK that's why I pay them no mind. How are you so obsessed with them and know nothing about them?
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney @LouisFarrakhan @BarackObama Just cause some racist people endorse you, especially when you never asked for an endorsement, does not make you racist. Disavowing the endorsements after they were made, is also not racist. You just keep trying to paint him as a racist and it's not working.

And it doesn't matter if he disavowed a million times and he built a monument to it, because thick headed leftists like you will never accept it.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney @LouisFarrakhan @BarackObama There were like 2 or 3 of them that are famous that did.

@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney @LouisFarrakhan @BarackObama Again, displaying your snowflake crybaby traits and not accepting his numerous disavowels.

It's generated hysteria that you've bought into lol.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney @LouisFarrakhan @BarackObama The #fakenews media is simply making really loud an amplifying the voice of a very tiny segment of the population in order to make @realDonaldTrump look like a racist. He's disavowed their endorsement numerous times and it's still not enough for you crybabies.

@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews I wonder why @HillaryClinton needed his endorsement when she ran for President in 2016? Can you explain this?
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama ISIS has been eradicated, only after @realDonaldTrump came into office. That is progress.
@aedaw9i @HillaryClinton @HillaryClinton alone spent a billion dollars on her campaign. 15 million is peanuts in comparison. The influence is negligible. @realDonaldTrump electoral victory was a landslide. Please stop. What kind of genius loses a billion dollars?
@aedaw9i @BeckyGilberto @Tim4372Fowler @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney It is not based on any facts, just #FakeNews political pundits hot air.

@aedaw9i @BeckyGilberto @Tim4372Fowler @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews @JohnMcCain @MittRomney It's as questionable as @LouisFarrakhan  meeting with @BarackObama before his ascendancy into the Presidency, something which the #FakeNews media actively hid from the American public for over 8 years.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You must not be a fan of rational and logical laissez-faire governance.

@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama That is not true, and @realDonaldTrump has pretty much eradicated ISIS, someone @BarackObama had referred to initially as a "JV Team". Obama's incompetence was insufferable.

@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews That doesn't mean their vote and their voice is disqualified or doesn't count.

@BeckyGilberto @aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews Once you call @JohnMcCain And @MittRomney Nazis, and racists, and misogynist, in every outlet that we now label today as #FakeNews, the religious right decided it was no longer a principle that needed to be upheld, but a battle that needed to be won.

@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Also not to mention a second restart to Iraq, with Afghanistan going on still to this day, and he was handed a conflict in Pakistan. @BarackObama had eight active theaters of war he handed over to @realDonaldTrump the day he left office.

@fafa019 @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @HillaryClinton I don't give credence to any argument made where the foundations rely on faulty social and humanities "scientific theories". That is why there is nothing to address with your statements other than you are just another misguided yet highly narcissistic sheep.
I did scream #LockHerUp @HillaryClinton , but I'm Indian tho ü§îü§îü§î @aedaw9i explain yourself https://t.co/hs2FbwhPmj
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Iran is not a regime we are on friendly terms with. The money should've never went out, and the fact the @BarackObama went to extraordinary lengths to keep it a secret, tells you how wrong he thought it was.
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Just lol. I just told you @BarackObama did all of these things first and you haven't addresed that point.

@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Yes he may have did these things, but he should get a pass. You know why? Because he's important as hell to a whole bunch of people. Unlike you. That's why you get judged on these actions, and he gets a pass in order to contest the Presidency. Which he won. #MAGA

@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump And the only facts you'll consider as "facts" are facts given by people who think like you. None of these traits or policies is suitable for governing.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You don't believe in science the way you think you do. You believe in "scientism". You don't believe in strength, because all the policies you propose consist of subsidizing the weak and the dumb and the lazy, and you believe in compassion to the point of blind benevolence.
@ToneZoneBeatz Then by your logic @IngrahamAngle is totally justified, on her platform, to disparage @KingJames for being a moron, which is her opinion. This just by the logic you just stated.
@fafa019 @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @HillaryClinton Please dont use that Marxist humanities "reverse racism doesn't exist" and "POC suffering is the result of cis hetero white male capitalist patriarchy" BS with me. Use that with "scholars" that can be fooled into thinking social sciences and humanities are respectable sciences.
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama locked up journalists, whistleblowers, deported the most people ever, started 5+ wars, started the culture of presidential drone bombing, and gave Iran a ransom payment. He will be in a orange jumpsuit in Guantanamo one day. #MarkMyWords

You have no idea who I am, what I've experienced and honestly I don't have to explain.

@BeckyGilberto @Tim4372Fowler @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This is America. A diverse country. Russians live here too and should feel good about their home. I'm sure you stood up for the Haitians and Africans who you thought might be insulted by Trumps shithole comments because you may have thought they had pride for their homeland...
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews Yea I and we feel the same way every time we hear CNN talking about "Cuckolding is an OK thing to do to keep a marriage or relationship afloat". Please stop.

@aedaw9i @APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump will go down as the Greatest President in American history who had been under an unprecedented assault from the media, simply for doing the things he said he would do on his campaign, you, basically keeping his promises. You guys have no standards whatsoever.
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton You are also no one of importance who's very existence and progress is the lynchpin to the growth and success of numerous others. No one gives a flying F about what you did or didn't do.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trust me, we feel the same whenever we hear Democrats, illiberals, and regressive like yourselves talk about the things you believe in.

@APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump I will call your cute ass sweety as much as I want, gorgeous. And I'm never worried about who @realDonaldTrump will hate beautiful, because I know there's one thing he loves the most. And that is #America, darling.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BreitbartNews Don't ever talk to me about "balanced perspective" or "only watching Faux News" when you don't even have the fortitude to read what the other side has to say.

@aedaw9i @APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump It sounds like your mad because one brave and strong man like @realDonaldTrump can take on the entire #VeryFakeNews #MSM and actually be a challenge for their coordinated assault on American democracy and Americans themselves. This is what makes him one of the Greatest Presidents
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you just described @HillaryClinton , someone you're very unwoke and deranged self probably voted for. Do not lecture me about morality or how morally superior you think you are than me. You are not.
@APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump No sweety, you are the consumer of the chaos created by #VeryFakeNews.  Think for yourself and maybe snowflakes won't be so deranged on a daily basis.
@aedaw9i @Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN I bet all you watch are liberal outlets. Do not lecture me until you read @BreitbartNews and @FoxNews daily to get your "balanced" perspective. You are just grand standing with no substance right now.
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump I am saddened by how many people in America can be so deranged and hateful because Americans stood up and voted for what and who they believe in, and that person was @realDonaldTrump . You must respect their voice, otherwise we will have no issues disrespecting you in his defense
@Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Well #VeryFakeNews @CNN had to layoff so many people because they were pushing such #VeryFakeNews and smart people realize this. It is you what is uninformed and ignorant.
@APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Actually, the snowflakes are you and the #FakeNews media that harp on him non-stop daily to the tune of 95% negative coverage. The media is supposed report facts, not feelings, and you and the #VeryFakeNews media can't seem to grasp this.
@aedaw9i @MikieSnax7311 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Glad you think Americans are stupid people. This type of hubris should help us and @realDonaldTrump won the 2020 election easily.
@APPerko @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Actually it's your fragile narcissism that makes you think that virile and strong and unapologetic MAN like @realDonaldTrump could win the Presidency. That is your derangement to deal with, not his silly snowflake.
@Tim4372Fowler @BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews You guys are so deluded that you think anyone who disagrees with you is a Russian bot. Are you ready for 7 more years of @realDonaldTrump ?
@KamalaHarris @common Getting ready for that 2020 L from @realDonaldTrump just like that 2016 L @HillaryClinton experienced I see.
@fafa019 @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @HillaryClinton Also he has a right to comment on social issues, and she has a right to comment on his stupidity. Deal with it.
@fafa019 @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @HillaryClinton I am a non-white born and raised in USA. I know what real racism is. This is not racism.

@BeckyGilberto @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @HillaryClinton Only research I need is @FoxNews is the most watched Cable News network and @realDonaldTrump won the electoral college. The Cavaliers aren't even first in the East. @KingJames needs to focus in his team, than focus on stuff he knows nothing about.
@amjoyshow @Sephspeaks This is the worst Presidential portrait in American history. @BarackObama  picked an activist artist and it completely backfired. @BarackObama deserves the ugly portrait for his ugly presidency.
@fafa019 @amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews She said nothing racist. Youre building non existent straw men and spreading #FakeNews . @KingJames would not speak so criticisingly if the candidate he shilled for, @HillaryClinton , had won the election, therefore we know all his commentary is disingenuous.

@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross @KingJames is entitled to his opinion, and so is @IngrahamAngle . Difference is, on politics, LeBron is wholly unqualified to pass comments on our politics without expecting to get G-checked by people who live and breath this stuff. @FoxNews and @IngrahamAngle take this round.
@jaketapper The idea that our President @realDonaldTrump did not earn his victory but won as a result of foreign interference in our election is a laughable at best, and slander at worst. Any journalist or media figure pushing the Russia story is #FakeNews
@Justinwcomedy @errollouis @realDonaldTrump The FBI is a politicized investigation arm who very obviously have an aligned agenda. The only pattern I notice with these school shooters is that they were brought to the FBIs attention, and they were ignored. https://t.co/s6wcUGHzf0

@CarterCruise In NYC, we have NYPD in riot gear with assault weapons and metal detectors in our public schools. This is already taking place in schools in high poverty communities. The solution suggests having veterans in schools who are teachers or janitors who also knows how to handle a gun.
@KamalaHarris We desperately need leaders wholl stop scapegoating tragedies to push for draconian gun control measures.
@BarackObama , @HillaryClinton , @Comey , @AGLynch , with #FISAGate are guilty of the same charge Jefferson charges to the Crown, "when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under¬†absolute Despotism..".

@LonnieHicks10 @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump This makes sense because @BarackObama is officially the President who deported the most people ever during his tenure. @realDonaldTrump is just following an established tradition, maybe even speeding it up a bit. I'm fine with that.
@LonnieHicks10 @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump One article from a globalist billionaires publication is not what I call "proof" or "facts" or "consensus".
