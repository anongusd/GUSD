Thinking about how this world gonna be for his children, finger on the trigger, nobody’s better at killing him..
Now he sitting with a codefendant, thinkin this couldn’t be how God written it, life on the line when they get on the witness stand, system thinks he wasn’t too intelligent, naw he just a product of the hell he in, so he self medicates with his medicine,
Hold up, I still ain’t finished,  he remembers he ain’t have a pot to piss in, defiant and won’t listen to anything but the 808 kicks, so he cooked up in the kitchen, better days seemed like nothing but a wish then,
Heart broken by a woman, so he do his own cooking, still spread love like BIG was resurrected in Brooklyn, but the pain feels like his soul just got tooken, used like a voodoo pin cushion, turns into Medusa even just for lookin, I need a break, bring the hook in..
Feel the scar tissue, Can’t look him in the eyes without seeing the tear, with my music this just something I want y’all to hear..
Ain’t have a father neither, he was too lost in the ethers, got lost and followed his demons, pour up out the pint and 2 liter, can y’all C a little bit clearer, as I paint a picture, real life but it’s still award winning theater,
Kick him while he’s down so he don’t fly off of his free loading, self loathing..
Only time he see the world is if they 360 his recording and touring, cultural extortion, only love him when he entertains for their enjoyment, New Slaves, most don’t end up like Mike Jordan, get faded from all the emotional exhaustion,
C this how it all started, every real one had a woman leave him broken hearted, seen momma mistreated by her fuckin boyfriend, escape to the streets, man up for employment, healing our wounds C that’s important,
It can be tough to find inspiration here. But these the throw away verses for Too Pimp a Caterpillar 🙏

I hope that this unfortunate attempt is a wake up call for any American believing this is the appropriate course of action to create positive change. So that this unfortunate negative is turned into a valuable lesson that galvanizes us moving forward together as Americans..
Despite the deep divides that have rippled throughout our country before we are New Yorkers or Texans, republicans or democrats.. We are Americans with a common goal.For the betterment of our country. We should find that we share more in common than any force attempting to divide
It’s unfortunate to see an individual who took an oath to serve his country believe that targeting the free press as well as political opponents is the appropriate way to serve his commander in chief. This is unacceptable in any branch of service 🙏

Aight so the bet is.. How long before I throw up on social media 😂😂😂.. They trappinnn for bait 😂🤷‍♂️🙏
Last thing I need. Especially right now.. is everybody all up in my business.. Bless up 🙏
Love and miss are action words. They ain’t tweets &amp; why I shouldn’t of used a certain emoji when leaving duality up to interpretation. Apologies are actions not words..
Oh and @LilBibby_ and if you waste your time wondering what the means🤷‍♂️.. Watch the news or something. Not me.. 🙏
If your life or relationships need validation via others and especially on social media 🤷‍♂️🙏..
3rd.. Y’all think y’all funny in this group chat. Make sure y’all put some commas on my head😂 before I throw the bet so we really slide on the winner on some gang ish 😂😂😂😂🙏
2nd.. Unguarded with Chris Herren make me cry every time. Ish gets me every time..
Few things I forgot.. real ones only end up in prison or dead from an OD or gun violence. Keep that real ish.. I’m tryna be me hastagg #WhoWannaGoToPrison
I wouldn’t be in rehab if I wanted to be on some bullshit that some of y’all be on. I could think of better places for that &amp; for today.. ain’t got no interest to go there. Tomorrow we’ll wake up &amp; see again 😂😂🤷‍♂️🙏

You know how heartbroken my family is that I’m back in rehab? My mother told me she thought we were finally past this and hasn’t been so depressed in her life. If I get locked I ain’t even calling her &amp; she’s the one person I can count on..
Aight so first things first.. I ain’t saying not to defend yourself. I ain’t saying it’s cool to get ya ass whooped. I ain’t even saying some turn ya cheek shit.. 		All I’m saying is.. 		A.) I ain’t got no cases for first time since 2015. I ain’t sitting on no dumb ish..

Noooooo ‼️ I forgot all my chapstick 😂😂🤷‍♂️🙏
And the journey begins 🙏
I don’t know if they ended the policy.. And I’m going to enjoy a break from my phone and social media.. But after 4-5 days of black out.. I’ll have my phone twice a day. In the morning from 8:30-9 &amp; at night from 5-6pm 🙏
While the most important change for me to make is my drug use. It’s also necessary to make other lifestyle changes as well.. I’m looking forward to learning from my past mistakes, taking what I need and leaving the rest 🙏
I look forward to the next chapters and new experiences and memories that life will present 🙏
I do my best to treat others how I would like to be treated. I do my best to spread love, positivity, kindness and to be polite and respectful throughout the ups &amp; downs and throughout the inconsistent treatment I receive in return. I take it all with a grain of salt..
Sometimes it takes due time for blessings in disguise to be revealed. My mother will always hold a special place in my heart. My father too. But it’s in the best interest of our relationships and well being to love each other from a distance.
That’s where I find stability. That’s where I find clarity. That’s where I find positivity and positive momentum in my independence. I’m grateful for all my experiences in life because all of it taught me valuable lessons. I’ve experienced many blessings in disguise..
But as evident by my life prior to my addiction and during my trip home in November for court. It’s best for me to love her from a distance and keep her out of my life as much as possible. That’s where I find myself. That’s where I find consistency.
I find much more consistency when I’m sober. More importantly, I find much more consistency aware from my mother. She means well. She has a heart of gold and she believes she’s doing God’s soul saving work. She’s done so much good for others. And there’s a lot of good in her..
I guess you could say that my stock fluctuates more then most and the way that people treat me coincides with it. That’s why I take it all with a grain of salt. That’s why I don’t enjoy the highs and that’s why I don’t get defeated over the lows. Life’s been a roller coaster..
I take the way people feel about me with a grain of salt. I’m not a politician looking for votes or an approval rating. I understand that I bring some of it on myself. I understand I’ve been inconsistent &amp; occasionally embarrassing over the last month..
I must work to regain my humility and gratitude. I must work to break old habits and create new ones. Actions speak louder then words and I would like to ask everybody to pray for my family 🙏. I’m nothing without the support of my friends &amp; family. 🙏
I understand that this isn’t my first time in treatment &amp; that it will take considerable time and work to earn back trust, credibility and things of that nature. I understand that I will be met with skepticism upon leaving treatment and I pray that God can guide me thru adversity
Someday I would love to help others to get clean and recover. The best way to do that is by setting the example. I know the hope that seeing someone get out of their situation can give to people. I’ve had friends give me that hope via the example they set..
I know there’s steps and they are in an order for a reason. It takes time to earn back trust and the people you’ve hurt need time to heal. But I’m looking forward to the opportunity to right the wrongs of my past and do what I can to not repeat the same mistakes 🙏..
Anytime I go to rehab.. There’s a million thoughts &amp; emotions that run thru my mind🙏.. I’m disappointed in myself for the last month and one day at a time I want to change my life for the better..
People can believe or not believe whatever they would like.. They can say that they don’t believe I’m done because this run didn’t beat me up enough. I’m not here to try and change their mind. I’m here to do my best one day at a time. I like my life &amp; myself better sober 🙏
Normally I don’t accept visitors while I’m in that shape. But I def won’t if there’s no barber 💈😂🤷‍♂️🙏
Most of the time there’s a good quality barber out of all the people in rehab.. It’s either free or a max 10 bucks and is the best 10 dollar cut you’ll ever get.. I’m banking on it 😂🤷‍♂️🙏..
Just trying to show her that I’m willing to change and willing to do the things that make her happy 🙏.. 😍🤩🥰😘

The package would cost the Knicks too much. Especially in the draft. I find it unlikely they pursue a trade when they can sign KD &amp; Kyrie to pair with Knox and the draft picks they have.. This is most likely positive PR in the aftermath
I was a big AD fan until his “musty” comment. It came off as a spiteful attempt to run himself out of town because the Pelicans aren’t caving to his demands. Look at what the Knicks got for Porzingis. Lakers offer isn’t even close.
In the aftermath of the fallout and with tampering allegations while being represented by Rich Paul.. It’s no surprise that this gets released to the public. He hasn’t shown ability to lead a franchise to victory. He will want to pair with Lebron.. https://t.co/5X39DHUaud

It’s not being a hypocrite or a double standard to want your children to not make the same mistakes as you. There’s things I did so that nobody in my family will ever have to again for generations and generations to come 🙏 https://t.co/p0j4fi0IEh

Like yo deadass.. I saw a meme &amp; it was a shoebox with like a grip(cash), a grip(strap) &amp; drugs packaged to distribute &amp; it said “What would you do if you found your 15 year old with this shoebox”.. Yo anybody looking to sell any of my kids drugs gonna have some real problems..
It doesn’t make me feel like “Damn.. where has this book been the entire time.”  But I respect The Big Book and what it’s done to save and improve lives. I don’t think it’s a bad book by any stretch of the imagination. In fact I think it’s a good book.
I find more solutions and more peace in my religion of choice. Despite the fact that I relate. The Big Book just doesn’t speak to me the way it speaks to others. It doesn’t make any lights go off. It doesn’t make me think.
There’s a point in time in my life where the Big Book probably would’ve had a greater impact on me. I find it to be staring the obvious. Obviously I can struggle putting it to practical application. But it doesn’t do it for me.
Derek the counselor is a breath of fresh air and I really enjoy his groups. I missed Young People’s group. It used to be good but sometimes it’s just nonsense because of the people in the group. Matt loves to get out his big book for it..
I used to enjoy Joe’s group after dinner but he’s become to repetitive for me. Most people can’t stand Joe’s group. They aren’t a fan of his public speaking skills &amp; technique but you know I gotta defend my guy Joe..
Yo at Sunrise House the do a guided meditation group but I just can’t with the facilitators voice on YouTube.. I’m ready to break out laughing at any second 😂😂😂🤷‍♂️🙏.. That turned into my cut group and it’s right before dinner so I’d have like a 3 hour break..

This one girl was nosy and wanted to know everything about me. They all started talking about the love they find in the fellowship and the comradery and sense of belonging and family that they’ve never experienced before it. That’s what’s cool about support groups 🙏
I had a cool conversation with this kid who traveled the world and we spoke about different cultures. A bunch of people in the group were talking about replacing religion with just spirituality &amp; were talking about how religion should be..
He told us to picture a place.. I pictured myself flying around in a UFO with Cheech &amp; Chong 😂🤷‍♂️🙏.. A girl took over as facilitator and I discovered my spirit animal was an elephant.. Afterwards things started to get weird..
Normally they go to a really cool spot out in the desert. But on this night we drove to a field. It was a guided meditation. We all laid down while the facilitator walked around us in a circle. Yo I had to try so hard not to laugh.. There was just something about his voice &amp; tone
Want to incorporate meditation more as a coping skill.. When I was out in Arizona we linked up with a few people outside of a meeting. They wanted us to come for a meditation meeting and the kid who drove me wanted to hook up with one of the girls..
This is my mother’s favorite study to reference.. https://t.co/d88Yts1ftq 🙏
I want to do research on the effect environment has on mental health and mental illness. It’s already understood that environment can play a role in seasonal depression. I’m curious about mood swings and other mental health issues..
He came from a drug and crime filled community. He was convinced that drugs were responsible for his environment. In his research he learned quite the opposite..
Check out the TED Talk regarding environment and addiction. Environmental factors contribute more to addiction then vice versa.. And the guy who did the study started out under the opposite impression and was intent on using science to prove his point.
They did a study with mice and discovered that they could get mice addicted to cocaine. But if they offered the mice healthy alternatives such as a fulfilling life. The mice didn’t return to the cocaine infused water..
They did a study with Vietnam Veterans. The Veterans who didn’t experience childhood trauma were able to put the heroin down upon their return home. The Veterans who had POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER from their childhood continued to use upon their return home..

There’s those who want to make something good come out of their negative experiences. Those who want to bring light to the darkness in a world that’s already filled with enough of it..We all make mistakes. I’m not perfect. Nobody is. Mistakes don’t have to define us in entirety🙏
There’s 2 type of people. There’s the misery loves company type. The type that wants everybody to feel their negativity. The type that wants to spread their negativity. Thens there’s those who know pain &amp; want to spread love &amp; positivity..

For years you’ve turned to me about anything and everything. You’ve come to me with all your most difficult and challenging problems and emotions. I just hope that you feel like you can turn to me and have me be the only guy(beside family) about your problems/issues with me..
Being in a relationship, being in love.. is much more than just a feeling. It’s much more than just words. It’s much more than just being loyal. I love you 😘@oliviaculpo 😍🤩🥰 and once I have my shit together I’d just ask for just a chance..
We can collaborate on writing, on fashion, on you being the best and most powerful woman that you can be. We can collaborate on making and creating babies😂 🤪. We can collaborate on being a “power couple”.. You can be my FLOTUS someday..
You don’t just deserve better. You deserve the best. And I know in my heart of hearts that anything I put my heart, mind and soul into I can be the best in the world 🌎 at. The best in the universe at..
This is what addiction does to your life. Not the glorification you see in entertainment. Codeine is no different. Percs are no different. I pray she doesn’t get an abortion because there’s still plenty of time for me to get my shit together🙏..
She is also happy to finally see me treat a woman the way they deserve. Same goes for my MOm.. I’d love it if she took me to treatment. If she did.. i wouldn’t even care if she did her thing while I was in there. I’m 💔 I’m not taking her to Paris for Valentine’s Day.

And while she was going on about “getting bleach in her whoha” 😂😂🤷‍♂️🙏and begging God to take her “home” and all her prayers for death.. I washed, dried and put away all the dishes. Put all the groceries away AND made her something to eat..
And “it ruined his last business because who wants a selfish fuck who only cares about themself and doesn’t pay attention to you..” 😂😂😂😂
And she’s the “And now he has a girlfriend” at least 6 times. Mom it’s 2 dates. “I think he wants to live off of her and have her support him while he runs his business”..

Jumpout or jumpout boys meaning comes from context. It could be like “he a jumpout” so he ain’t no sucker and he hop out before he air out. Or jumpout like they run train. So “jumpout boys came thru, blitzed and got dada dada da and he had it on him too. This his 2nd gun charge”
I just be feeling like I want to create music from that “I feel like I’m the most versatile artist of all time” mindset. I got the realist quoting my lyrics and love songs aint really my vibe 😂🤷‍♂️🙏

Brady doesn’t really move laterally so it’s import to pressure him from the interior. I say he gets another ring in what should be an interesting exciting game
With Aaron Donald and Suh being relatively the least impactful player on their line.. It’s going to be interesting to see them matchup with the Pats offensive line that’s been playing well. Interior pressure is important because of how Brady steps up in the pocket..
Despite what the Rams CB gave Brady to make his fire burn even more.. Even if he lost a step. If you watched the KC game and saw what he did on 3rd down after 3rd down late in the game. He’s still as dangerous in the clutch as ever..

But I like that she is fresh out of the struggle and can relate to the issues that are a reality for a majority of Americans. For me HRC was too distant. Too distant in a lot of ways. She was too distant in her relatability and far too much of a Democrat elitist for me
The reality that HALF OF AMERICANS only have $400 and generations retiring later and later with rising costs of living. These issues are too often overlooked by the people voted into office with the power to make change. I don’t agree with @AOC on everything ..
That 25 cents a slice is a lot of money to some people. Especially people feeding a family daily. It adds up. And especially if you grew up in an era where change got you places.. Too many politicians are disconnected from this reality.
I think Costco pizza is good. But I don’t think it’s better than a lot of places. The last few decades have distorted moms pallet a lil bit. Plus she say other pizza places are too expensive and she says Costco is $1.99 for a big slice..

They would also be able to rightfully portray to the world that America is responsible for the end of the INF treaty. America would lose all leverage and there would be no legal consequences preventing Russia from advancing beyond development to deployment.. @MaxBoot
Credible allegations regarding Russian development of weapons violating the treaty show their lack of desire to comply and willingness to not be apart of INF treaty. Lack of a treaty legally allows them to deploy weapons in strategic positions that pose a threat to NATO countries

Vicky was there that not and she’s like barstool smokeshow material. Everybody tries. I aint ever get with her but plenty of em. So the staff brings me ice for my eye but I’m on so many painkillers I don’t want it. But Vicky insisted on having the Spanish mother in her come out..

His family history is that they’re both attorneys. But heads up.. His mom is like the best divorce attorney in Denver with celebrity clients. She charges more hourly than Pam does. Only negative is that he’s a Red Sox fan. DM me for pics ‼️🤷‍♂️🙏
He’s got a cool personality and some cool friends. Again he would obviously be loyal to you. He drives a Mercedes. It’s last body style C class. Everybody knows my opinion on that. But it’s still a C class. It’s red and has Manhattan addy so he’s got insurance money..
He has the desire and brains to expand it once he has more then just a  say and full control. He’d be my business partner because I get 75% and own the building he operates out of. Who’s had their fun and ready for a relationship? He’s like 33 I think. He’s loyal.
And the older he gets. The more uncomfortable and awkward that will be and the more experience and less “take home to mom” other women his age will be. He has his plumbing license in the 5 boroughs. He’s set to “inherit” a plumbing company that does 7 sometimes 8 figures yearly..
I’m tryna find my cousin love. My pops says that he doesn’t like women that he can’t bring home to mom. He has a business degree from CU Boulder we know it’s reputation😂🤷‍♂️. An apartment via his family in Manhattan which gives him more disposable income to spend on you.
Just too bad that he’s a virgin like me and doesn’t utilize that bed and his Manhattan zip code and views 😂😂😂🤷‍♂️🙏. We’ve got a long love hate history. Don’t want to say his name after blowing up his spot. Love you Cousin.. ‼️🙏
So my cousin financed like a $3,500 bed. I told him I thought that was ridiculous. But he persuaded me.. He said “Think about it. You spend at least 8 hours a day in it. Plus whatever time watching TV and quality is good for your health.” He’s right.. https://t.co/4oaiXxPkMn

Mrs. Linda is understandably and rightfully one of my biggest critics. But we didn’t let it interfere in our relationship and would still hug and have a good friendly relationship in which we would joke as well. But that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t lay down the law..
But I also didn’t think it was right for her to tell me that I needed years in prison to fix what she teaches us is a disease. She told me that The Director just didn’t know what else to do to motivate me and that I’m one of the people she cares about the most.
To backtrack.. When I spoke to Mrs. Linda she told me she heard about the argument because it was out front and a lot of people stopped to watch. I told her I apologized but I was offended because not only was it not true and the exact opposite of how I feel..
That’s when Joe hooked me up with the temporary sponsors number to show me around meetings in Montclair. Joe means well. Joe makes a difference and Joe shares his truth, his experiences, his reality and his solution.
“People are terrified and are trying to figure out their situation and all our lives are at stake.” The Mayor, the Marine I was telling you about, had to reassure everybody I was just being protective. I ended up going to her office to apologize.
She came to address the community and I raised my voice. I said “Everybody in here is fighting for their life and I understand maintaining business as usual until the day comes. But we’re 3 days away and your using our lack of credibility as addicts to undermine the truth.”
We have a good relationship. But we’ve had our differences. Our relationship started with a disagreement. When the lockout was happening and people were telling their families what was up. She would speak to concerned families and reassure them that we were lying.
The people who know me and spend time with me don’t see the cookie cutter attributes that recovery experts and professionals associate with me. They tell the people who spend time with me that they’re in denial. I apologized to the director over it.
Yo I turned around and flipped the fuck out. I wish it was a dude who said it to me. I somewhat got in her personal space and if it was male staff I would’ve been all up in his space. They haven’t seen me like that before. I was offended.
She doesn’t know what I used to see when I look in the mirror. Believe me.. I’m my biggest critic and she doesn’t know how my home life is either. I was walking away when she said it and she also said “He needs long term jail time of a few years to get clean.”
When I left treatment with that girl and returned the next day because I left all my stuff. I tried to get back in. The Director told my mother “We know Vincent. He believes that his good looks and charm can get him out of anything.” I haven’t ever thought that..

Don’t get me wrong.. I understand why they use the rhetoric to convey their message to a broad demographic. It’s just not me to speak in those terms and like I said it shows comprehension when you put it in your own words like @rustyrockets
Another way I know it’s getting bad is when I start using recovery rhetoric and terms like “run”. I like @rustyrockets book on Recovery because he puts it in his own terms. To me that shows a greater level of comprehension..

Because of her DWI resulting in the death of her best friend. She was one person who would understand him. I like how they show the therapeutic value and how it takes time and the weight dissipates. I also liked the growing frustration in Ben on display for the first time.
Moms just watched Episode 13 and we both agree that it was just “Ok”. I liked how they incorporated AA and Step 5. I like how he was going on a spiritual journey regarding something he never told anybody and the calling brought him and Michaela together..

I just wouldn’t be the one to sign Harper. ESPECIALLY with The Yankees stance on long term deals, current roster construct, Florial and Frazier and Harpers career numbers, flaws in swing(does do a good job hitting to all fields tho) and similar value for far far far cheaper..
ESPECIALLY with the Phillies as his suitor.. The Yankees remain uninterested. Just interested in how it effects the benchmark of other free agents who will sign after he signs this offseason and in the future. I’m all about players getting their piece of the pie..
👀👇 Harper to the Phillies is trending https://t.co/mbrviAw9RO
Would be do such a thing? Or does this signal that the Phillies have exceeded the Nats 10/300 offer? Or is he standing on principal by not returning. Phillies said they were looking to spend “stupid money”. Expect the rest of the dominoes to fall shortly after he signs..
Would they still pursue Machado too? How does Machado feel about Philly? I know they had what was at least a second visit with Harper recently in Vegas. Would he take a 2 year deal and still be young enough to cash in long term during a different free agent market? https://t.co/HoemVHZWew

We should all support a better quality and way of life for the people of Venezuelan.. The most important aspect is how we support that

What’s more crucial and what Russia has more of a national interest in is Syria and its natural resources and strategic importance in the Middle East..
Colombia doesn’t support the Maduro regime and there’s increasing talks for the EU to not support them. Foreign intervention is a classic and standard @GOP tactic to increase approval ratings and given Russia’s stance on Venezuela. However, Russia can live with this decision..
It’s not a good look for the @realDonaldTrump NSA to be seen publicly with “5,000 troops to Colombia.”.. Maduro pushes rhetoric to the Venezuelan people regarding American intervention and has done so in response to sanctions..
Regarding the Bolton notepad.. An astonishing number of ideas are discussed as how to approach issues. While it might turn out to never come into fruition. It isn’t a good look for numerous reasons including the light it sheds on insight into the NSA thinking..

It wasn’t a political decision beyond that. It was a decision based on numerous factors..
That aspect of the campaign platform was met was mass support from the American voters. You could even say that it was the voters desire that made it apart of the campaign platform. Executing it proved to be different and difficult..
My biggest concern. And I’m speaking from experience under the Obama Administration.. Is withdrawing from Afghanistan without the proper enforceable peace agreement for primarily political reasons. The Obama Administration campaigned on ending wars.

I would like to see Afghanistan govern themselves and take all the burden.. The potential does exist for this to grow into a future problem more dangerous than prior to the invasion for another administration to deal with..

I’ve seen people say that she doesn’t take accountability. I can’t entirely agree with that. Where’s the accountability for what’s said about her?
In my Ye voice.. @jack says not to worry because if Trump still became President with his tweets.. I can too. But I don’t want to be a future version of him. I’ve seen talk that @AOC is the progressive version of Trumpism. Part of me thinks it’s an attempt to silence her..

The one benefit of Coats inexperience is his willingness to rightfully delegate responsibilities to intel professionals

Don’t get me wrong. CIA has done some things in the past. But we operate in a world where people are willing to do some crazy things that y’all just don’t understand. So we need the proper skills to combat it. I like the no credit part that we get tho.
She says I taught her how to be a professional liar. Yo I love being @CIA but it comes with some misconceptions. Yeah I’m trained in a lot of things. But I’m a straight shooter. When military comes home. They’re welcomed. CIA gets viewed with skepticism.

And I love your new haircut by the way. Just because it’s not what id prefer for you don’t mean that I don’t notice and still love it.

Obviously recently I’ve been bringing it on myself. But before I publicly spoke on any of this and I was going to meetings in Montclair. Any time somebody would speak about how drugs/liquor took “the girl” from them.. They’d call on me next.
She also says that she doesn’t need to be reminded that I have options because that’s what some of our problems were about. I just be reminding who I walked away from😂. She also says it’s obvious that I say similar things to my friends &amp; she still can’t believe Im really in love
She thinks I broke up with her when I didn’t have to just because I wanted to spend my brothers birthday with him😂. You can ask anybody I was in the stu with how relentlessly she was FaceTiming me. She says she ain’t think I was cheating but she just wanted to see me😂😂😂
Imma try and make this my last one. But I be high today. It’s snowing. And there ain’t much else going on to publicly speak on. She don’t realize that lying because she thinks I’m lying is what it be about😂 https://t.co/RsOiptcyMX

Her and her friends put two tables together and they were like the richest best looking girls. There was like 2 girls at that table that I’m lucky I didn’t hit. They’d be stuck up snobby to me and their own friends would have to intervene at times. So anyway..
So we sat in the corner. All the girls put two tables in between us and our other friends. One day I was sitting with my back to them and I turn around to quickly throw a tin foil ball at my mans. Yo I hit this girl square in the forehead.
We all sat together for lunch. The teachers on duty would say “I thought you guys were going to be my problem table. You’re actually the best behaved and I wouldn’t be able to get the rest to behave if you guys didn’t help me..”

The VP walks in to the gym and says “Take a walk to my office with me.” I get to his office and I swear that I didn’t cut. He shows me a stack of papers and says “Why don’t I have a pop quiz from you? I told you if you cut again it’s 3 days.”
The shop teacher was my friends parent who I used to ride with. All the guys were laughing and telling him what I did. He tells me if his boss walks in he will get in trouble so he has to hide me until the bus comes. The bus takes us back and I go to gym class.
I went straight back to the kids waiting for Votec. The bus showed up and I got on it. I hung out on the Ave. I got Burger King breakfast. My friends mom saw me and I made up some story. I go to Votec to get back on the bus.
Yo in 8th grade I cut my study hall to wait with the Votec kids to take the bus to Votec with them. The bus was late so the VP catches me and brings me in his office. He says “Cut study hall again and you’re suspended 3 days.” The bell rang and he told me to go to my next class..

He kicked me out of his damn STUDY HALL. How dumb do you have to be to get kicked out of study hall? 😂😂. I had my own study hall in the library. But we overcame our differences to have a great relationship 🙏
I say to him “How was I behaving?”.. He looks right at the principal and says “You were as respectful as you always are..” I was the only 8th grader with a study because I lost my elective because I wasn’t behaving. Me and him used to get into it.
The police escort me thru the cafeteria in front of everybody. They take me to the actual principals office. The principal accuses me of being disrespectful and causing a scene. Luckily I told Mr. Bonnett to get my backpack because he comes walking in the office at perfect time..
I told him how I’m sitting in my assigned seat, quietly, trying to prepare for a test and this is how they resolve the issue? By calling the police? And despite no violent history assuming they need a big gym teacher too?
On his 3rd trip in he says “This is the last time the police are willing to let me handle it. If I go back outside without you. They are coming in.” So I go outside and they had the big gym teacher posted. The assistant VP was a retired cop and I went off on him..
He comes in the room to get me and I say “We have a test we’re preparing for and I need to prepare.” He says “Okay I’ll be right back”. He comes back in and says there’s police outside. I respectfully say “I’m not causing a scene and I need to prepare.”
I’d be happy to give him my desk. But the teacher says she’s not starting class until I move. I refuse to move and she calls the office. The office sends Mr. Bonnett. Me and him were mad cool. I sat in silence the entire time..
Another time we made sure to get to class early and get our seats before he got there. The teacher told me to move for him and I wouldn’t. I couldn’t throw her under the bus because she would constantly plead with me to sit there even when I didn’t want to.
I’m no bully. I stuck up for kids like him even with my own friends. He kept sitting in my seat because of her and she kept begging me to sit there instead of him. One day he was going to sit and I pulled the chair out and got in so much trouble..
She’d but her books and backpack on her desk and use my desk to write. I had like a eighth of my own desk 😂. So there was this kid who was special. Just a different special than I was and he was in all ordinary classes too.
But anyway. I say she stayed getting me in trouble because in 11th grade we had all our morning classes together and she’d get upset if I didn’t walk with her to them. We had assigned seats next to each other and she’d make her desk mine.

They say they’ve done it a few times and they’re all excited and getting a rush from it. Of course the time I’m with them the police stop us and use their flashlights to check our sneakers and then let us go. We get to the dinner and the girls are there.
Out of fear she starts holding my hand while we walk and they tell me that they got someone picking them up to go to the dinner and I’m coming with them. We get in the car and these fuckin losers want to drive by the house.
On his way out he sees the cops on their way. So we all separate and leave before the cops get there. I’m hiding at the park when I see two girls that I know. I’m not a hand holder but one of em just had that real sexy sex appeal to her.
We get it rolled and we’re going to smoke. We link up with them. I saw my mans there drinking a beer and he was giving me his piss the next morning for my drug test. So this is 11th grade actually. He left because I said something about it.
I stopped selling dubs and slices and all that. So I go grab my mans. I’m like yo I got 2 girls who wanna smoke. Roll something up. Yo he starts hurting the Dutch right on the floor in the poor girls house. I forget that my friend used to hook up with her.
Her friend starts asking me “Are you hooking up with anybody because if you are I will kill you..”		So she always used to give me shit for smoking weed but this night she wants to smoke with me. So I’m like alright bet. I’ll be back..

I’m not talking about being in Kindergarten and wrestling and arguing over Candance with my best friend Johnathon. I had girlfriends in like 5th and 6th grade and I was dating another girl from another town before we got to West Essex. But this was different.

With withdrawals you get heart palpitations and the fluid is much worse. Kept smoking. Rollies and American Spirits make it much better. I have the heart rate of a non smoker. No chest pains and no fluid. But I still smoke. I regret smoking far more than drugs..
I had an insane heartbeat and an irregular heartbeat and had to go for what’s it called? An EKG? I continued to smoke Newports with chest pains and fluid. That’s like early COPD too. My Aunt who was a nurse tried encouraging me and I kept smoking.
Don’t want to come off the wrong way. But a $12 million dollar day.. Can relatively be a “BAD” financial day for me. None of that means anything if you don’t have your health. Your mental health. Physical health. Spiritual health.
Addiction makes all of that stuff irrelevant and it hurts the people that you love almost as much as it hurts you and they’re just innocent bystanders. And money and status can’t make someone love you or have you love them properly.
I’m not trying to come off the wrong way. But you could have everything on earth a guy would want. All the most beautiful women. All famous friends who celebrities fan over and to you they’re just your family. All the money in the world and still have nothing..

I don’t like putting labels on things. I have good relationships and than once that label is put on it.. Same thing started happening with Michele 🙏

Shawn was talking about how another grape cat came thru before me and how they were cool in there but not outside of there. We ended up being pretty cool. He trusted me with his iPad and let me use it whenever. I could just go in his room. He’d bring it to me by gazebo too 🙏

I went to rehab without expectations and got sober for the first time ever 🙏
Anyway, it was his girl who reassured my mom that we were on our way when she started to panic. I told him.. Don’t judge me if I cry. I went to rehab because my mom found out I started doing dope and was trying to convince me to go out to California.
Me and my brim homie Shawn(https://t.co/wP6FyBwvPT) got pulled out of detox for our visit. He’s like 6’2 300lbs and he don’t fuck with grapes. He had a white sugar momma who had a dope Benz truck and 7 series coming to visit him. Funny story how they met down by broad &amp; market.
You know how I told you that my mom won’t drive in the rain? It rained so I missed my visit the day before Mother’s Day and my Moms birthday. I got to see her the week before. I told everybody don’t judge me if I cry when I see her.
I also missed Jeters retirement ceremony. But May 14th was my sober day. I refused my last Valium so that it would be. Funny thing is. Friday night I prayed selfishly that the game would get rained out. The next day was visitation..
I never thought I’d be in rehab for Mother’s Day and my moms birthday because they were the same day making her a Mother’s Day card in there. When I got home we got in an argument and she was crying when she ripped it up and lit it on fire in front of me.
We would do percs a little more often when we were just chillin. Hard drugs made you a loser when I was in high school. Now there’s dope in my local JUNIOR HIGH. Especially with how anti drugs I was. I never thought I’d grow up to be an addict.
Me and all my friends were the biggest anti drug people growing up. We thought weed and liquor was different and I didn’t even try anything else until I was 15. Coke, pills, molly was like a 5 time a year thing. We did it like prom, senior ball.. Things like that

As an only child with a single mother who doesn’t really have any family or support system.. I play multiple roles in the family structure. Some of it is my pay back for not letting her date when she was working out and a smoking hot 40-50 year old 😂😂😂

It’s just not a proper representation. So I didn’t want to also show up in baggy pajamas 😂😂😂. 		In her own words.. My mom is “anal about punctuality. Punctuality is respect for the time of others. She’s right. She routinely shows up an hour early.
I had people calling my phone to come pick me up to go get pills. I could’ve made more money and got relief just by taking a ride. But I made a commitment and completed the job. I prefer to not present myself in public while withdrawling. It’s just not a good look.
My moms friend did nothing but complain about his job. He was getting paid more than me to just work the phone and all he did was work his mouth complaining while I’m sick AF doing manual labor.
One morning I was going to work in Hoboken. I was on pills and I was withdrawling. My mother was fighting with me to go to work in my baggy pajamas I slept in😂🤷‍♂️. I was doing all manual labor all by myself. I had to move heavy file cabinets down tight steps.
She was shocked that she was still coming in this little bit of snow. Moms thinks weather should shut everything down 😂.. When her friend was staying here &amp; working in Hoboken.

If you can’t tell.. I obviously slipped up this morning. It’s crazy. 2 nights ago I prayed to God to not use. I woke up the next day and had minimal withdrawals all day. Bearable aches. Bearable chills and sweats. Bearable anxiety. Stomach was bearable..
