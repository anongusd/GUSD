Maybe if you believe that there are “three chambers of government: the presidency, the Senate, and the House,” you also believe that a 70% tax rate 📈would work and that the world 🌎 will end in 12 years.  The facts 📖 show otherwise.
In Wisconsin, more people were employed in 2018 than ever before and unemployment has been at or below 3% (previous record) for 11 months. Workforce is biggest area for bipartisan agreement.

OUR LEGACY - 11 straight months of record low 3% or below unemployment in Wisconsin (was 9.3% in Jan 2010).
After inheriting a $3.6 billion budget deficit, we ended each year with a surplus. We cut taxes by more than $8 billion. Revenues went up. And in 2018, more people were working than ever before. Tax cuts work!!!
Lower tax rates actually lead to more revenue.  It’s based on the same reason stores like Kohl’s offer sales on top of sales: VOLUME. They could charge more and sell less or they can lower prices and sell many more products. https://t.co/AuyXWcG6xO

When liberal politicians tell you they will only raise taxes on the “wealthy,” look at Maryland.  They started out with a “millionaires tax” then O’Malley had to push a tax increase on households making $100,000 (2 people with $50,000 jobs) or more. https://t.co/diUJeRYXsH https://t.co/PknOwOUn7K

Explaining tax rates before Reagan to 5th graders: “Imagine if you did chores for your grandma and she gave you $10.  When you got home, your parents took $7 from you.”  The students said: “That’s not fair!” Even 5th graders get it.

We won three elections for Governor in a blue state that only voted Republican for President once in the past 34 years.
We received more votes for Governor than any other Republican.
We passed pro-life legislation to protect innocent unborn children.
To make it easy to vote but hard to cheat, we passed a photo ID requirement to vote in Wisconsin.
We inherited a $3.6 billion budget deficit and turned it into a surplus each year. Our bond rating is up, our pension system is fully funded and our rainy day fund is 190 times larger than we found it.
Our schools continue to be some of the best in the country. We can now staff based on merit and pay based on performance. That allows us to put the best and the brightest in the classroom.
We put in place welfare reforms that require able-bodied, working-age adults to be employed or in training at least 30 hours a week. And to be able to pass a drug test.
Our Healthcare Stability Plan starts lowering premiums and increasing choices in January.
We froze in-state, undergraduate tuition at the University of Wisconsin for six straight years to make college more affordable for students and working families.
We reduced the tax burden on the hard-working people of Wisconsin by more than $8 billion.
More people are employed in Wisconsin this year than ever before in the history of the state.

On the day after the primary, Tony Evers said “everything is on the table” when asked about gas tax increases.
Tony Evers wants to raise income taxes on manufacturers and farmers. That will cost us jobs and manufacturers.
Property taxes went up 27% in the decade before we took office. Tony Evers will lift the limits on property taxes and they will go up again on working families and seniors.

Wisconsin is working and moving forward. And now our welfare reforms will help able-bodied Medicaid recipients obtain the skills and support they need to enter the workforce and to be successful — that is just another way we'll keep Wisconsin working for generations to come.
We also want people to be healthy, and with employers needing drug-free workers, our reforms also include a drug screen. This and our bipartisan HOPE agenda are helping those confronting substance abuse become healthy and enter the workforce.
Our welfare reforms are helping people move from government dependence to true independence through the dignity of work. That’s why our reforms include a work requirement for able-bodied people who want to receive public assistance through Medicaid.
Wisconsin is working — literally. And with 3% unemployment, we can’t afford to have anyone on the sidelines. That’s why we’re enacting bold welfare reforms to help Medicaid recipients enter the workforce and obtain the skills &amp; assistance they need to be successful.
We’re tied with Evers at 47%. In 2016, Ron Johnson was down by 1%. You made the difference. We need your help again. Pass this flyer around electronically or print it out and distribute to as many as possible before Tues! https://t.co/PbkFXTL0Np

Taxes have gone up $2.5 billion under Gov. Jay Inslee. Five weeks after his last election, he proposed a $5.5 billion tax increase. Looks like a crystal ball to what Tony Evers will do. Tony’s Taxes will cost us jobs. https://t.co/LLAoPBqcvq
Our real leadership has led to a record of results -- like reducing the tax burden on hard-working families and building Wisconsin’s workforce. Read our plan below: https://t.co/MDgM3TCvxW https://t.co/PhbRqtl7V3

"It's mathematically impossible to cut it in half w/o releasing ppl who were convicted of violent crimes," John Pfaff, a criminal law prof. at Fordham University, who reviewed WI’s prison admissions and population earlier this yr when the Associated Press fact checked this claim.
If Evers wants to halve the prison population today, experts say that it would be impossible without releasing some violent criminals &amp; reconsidering the way they're sentenced.		Offenders who committed violent crimes accounted for 67% of WI’s total prison population last year.
AP FACT CHECK from the debate:		STATE PRISON POPULATION		EVERS: "Violent criminals will always stay behind bars. Red states across this country have figured this out."		THE FACTS: Evers was responding to a question about his support for a plan to reduce the WI’s prison pop by 50%

When he 1st ran for Governor Jay Inslee said he was against tax increases. Since then, taxes have gone up $2.5 billion. And 5 weeks after his last election, he proposed a $5.5 billion tax increase. Crystal Ball to Tony Evers’ future if elected. https://t.co/Edk71CLyBB
Great to be in Racine today to talk about how with our record of reform, and by doing what we said we’d do, Wisconsin is moving forward. Now, let’s keep Wisconsin working for generations to come! https://t.co/0246ZwQ07G
Tony’s Taxes are a recipe for a return to a recession.
Tony’s Taxes will cost us jobs. Wisconsin is Working. We can’t afford to turn back now!
Tony Evers wants to raise property taxes, income taxes and gas taxes.
Since taking office, Gov. Jay Inslee has raised taxes by nearly $2.5 billion. Crystal ball as to what Tony Evers will do if he is elected governor.
Gov. Inslee’s state already has the 2nd largest gas tax in America at nearly 50 cents per gallon. Earlier this year, he proposed an increase of 20 cents with automatic increases to follow.
Crystal Ball for the Future: Gov. Jay Inslee is campaigning with Tony Evers today. 5 weeks after his last election, he proposed $5.5 billion in new taxes. That’s what happens when “everything is on the table.”
There are only 10 days left until Election Day -- we’ve kept our promises and put Wisconsin on the right path, but now we need your help on Nov. 6th to keep Wisconsin moving forward! https://t.co/O9a9aeQQJX

After tonight’s debate, the attacks against us are intensifying — please chip in now to help us continue to move Wisconsin forward with more bold reforms and real leadership. https://t.co/2xlHWSnXi9 https://t.co/l4b9n3JG36
Tony Evers is bought and paid for by the unions. Throughout his political career, unions have backed his political ambitions, outspending Evers’ own campaign by a two to one margin. They know that he will put the big-government union bosses back in charge. #wigovdebate
We stood up to the big government special interests and won. We took the power out of their hands and put it back in the hands of the hardworking taxpayers. #wigovdebate
We want to keep our graduates in the state and attract new talent to the state as well. We want to continue to move forward and keep Wisconsin working for generations to come.
Looking forward, it is time to finish the job. We want to grow our workforce and make sure that every student graduates and every graduate has a game plan for college or a career.
This year, we have more people working than ever before. We have eight consecutive months of unemployment at or below 3%. We have some of the best schools in the nation and property taxes are lower today than they were when we took office.
When we took office eight years ago, Wisconsin was a mess. We had double-digit tax increases, billion-dollar budget deficits, and record job loss.
Since 2015, Wisconsin has seen an almost 30% drop in opioid prescriptions. Our H.O.P.E. Agenda is getting results in our fight against the opioid epidemic. #wigovdebate https://t.co/30ngDYWyME
Being governor means being visible, meeting with people and learning what’s important to them. We will never apologize for traveling to visit the people of Wisconsin. #wigovdebate
The UW System says that plagiarism is an act of “intellectual burglary.” They consider it a very serious issue and a breach of academic integrity. For plagiarism there are “severe” penalties.  Tony Evers is a UW regent. He should take plagiarism seriously too. #wigovdebate
Tony Evers said his plagiarism was contained to “a budget” and a few citations, then it came out there have been at least 7 cases over 6 years. What’s the truth, Tony? #wigovdebate
Tony Evers claims that the plagiarism was a staff mistake, but he is running on his budget request.  Either Evers knew about the plagiarism or he doesn’t know what’s in his budget. #wigovdebate
Tony Evers plagiarized portions of his last four state budgets. As more examples of Evers’ plagiarism emerge day by day, Evers must answer: are there more examples of plagiarism yet to be uncovered? #wigovdebate
When Tony Evers talks about “fair” taxes, it’s fair to assume that your taxes are going up. #wigovdebate
Tony Evers will raise taxes, but refuses to say by how much. Wisconsin families cannot afford Tony Evers’ tax hikes. #wigovdebate https://t.co/xYI39W5VKO
The $86.9 million we invested in local road aid is the highest it has been in the last 20 years.  #wigovdebate
When a Madison bureaucrat says that he will tell you after the election how much he will raise your taxes, hold onto your wallets and purses. #wigovdebate
The next budget will increase the amount of aid to counties to fix their roads to 30%, and would increase state support for town roads from 42% to a record 58%. #wigovdebate
The last time the Democrats were in charge of state government, they raided the transportation fund. #wigovdebate https://t.co/wQViffp5i6
Wisconsin families will feel Tony Evers’ pain at the pump. He said that a $1/gallon gas tax increase was “on the table,” which would cost a typical two-driver family over $1,200 annually. #wigovdebate https://t.co/LR7r0ntYeh
Under Tony Evers the gas tax will go up by as much as $1 per gallon, and we don’t know exactly how much because he won’t say. #wigovdebate
We will never raise the gas tax without a corresponding equal or greater decrease in the overall tax burden. Tony Evers said his gas tax increase has “no range” and “everything is on the table.”
Tony Evers said that “everything is on the table” when it comes to the gas tax. His proposal to raise the gas tax by as much as $1 gallon would cost a typical two-driver family more than $1,200 a year. Wisconsin families cannot afford Tony Evers. #wigovdebate
When Tony Evers says that “everything is on the table,” he means that he is going to increase your taxes — he just won’t tell you by how much. #wigovdebate
Tony Evers will give driver’s licenses and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. We are a nation of laws and shouldn’t be giving more benefits to those here illegally, especially when Tony Evers wants to raise taxes on hard-working families.
Driver’s license and in-state tuition reward those who do not obey our laws. We must encourage legal immigration by not rewarding those who come here illegally.
As soon as you stop enforcing the law, you eliminate equal protection under the law. Wisconsin will follow the law as long as Scott Walker is governor.
We are a nation of immigrants but also a nation of laws. It’s wrong to provide benefits like in-state tuition and drivers’ licenses to illegal immigrants who don’t follow our laws.
Wisconsin is on a roll. We have more people working this year than ever before and jobs are coming back to Wisconsin. #wigovdebate
After losing 133,000 jobs and unemployment reaching 9.3% when Democrats controlled state government, our reforms have WI working. Unemployment has been at or below 3.0% for a record eight straight months. #wigovdebate https://t.co/TAO46vqrDl
Even with more people working this year than ever before, we still have more than 90,000 jobs on the Job Center of Wisconsin website. We need everyone off the sidelines and into the workforce. #wigovdebate https://t.co/amxkEhea1f
Wisconsin ranks 2nd in Main Street Entrepreneurship. We are creating good-paying, family-supporting jobs all across the state. #wigovdebate
Through our Wisconsin Fast Forward program, we are helping to rehabilitate inmates by providing job training, so they’re ready for the workforce when they leave prison. Cc: @juvlaw1975 #wigovdebate
Tony Evers wants to overhaul truth-in-sentencing. That would mean less certainty and more danger for victims who won’t know when their attacker will be let out. #wigovdebate
FACT: Tony Evers wants to cut the prison population in half. Today, that would mean the release of thousands of violent offenders. Here’s the AP’s fact check: https://t.co/PTEy8UVqr4 #wigovdebate
The Juvenile Law Center called our bipartisan reforms “a huge step forward for Wisconsin.” #wigovdebate
We worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to reform the juvenile justice system. We are moving the juveniles closer to home to make it easier to be rehabilitated. #wigovdebate https://t.co/f32qbASjdd
Protecting our environment and making it easier to do business are not mutually exclusive. We have balanced both interests and in a way that works for Wisconsin. #wigovdebate
Say what??? When we first froze UW tuition, Evers said it was not “right.” This was even after it was found that the UW System was holding a slush fund of $648 million. #wigovdebate
Our agenda provides a New Graduate Tax Credit to graduates who live and work in Wisconsin after they graduate. #wigovdebate
We froze tuition at UW schools for the last 6 years and will freeze it for the next 4 years. We are committed to keeping college affordable for our students. This is how you keep Wisconsin working for generations to come. #wigovdebate https://t.co/ch9p3iyLKr
We need to find new ways to develop our workforce. That is why our agenda to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come expands Youth Apprenticeship programming to 7th and 8th graders. #wigovdebate https://t.co/pEJOAmg5Bw
We want parents in every zip code to have their pick of great schools. Tony Evers wants to take choices away from parents. #wigovdebate https://t.co/5ZRZ73o61z
2/3 funding for education is a Republican issue. Republicans first enacted it, then Jim Doyle did away with it and Tony Evers failed to stop him. Democrats took away 2/3rd funding and raised property taxes. #wigovdebate
There goes Tony Evers continuing the false attacks on our record actual-dollar investment in education. Fact: Tony Evers called our budget “pro-kid.” #wigovdebate
Developing our workforce is a top priority. That is why our agenda to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come expands Youth Apprenticeship programming to 7th and 8th graders. #wigovdebate
Tony Evers criticizes our education investments now, but called our investment “pro-kid” before he decided to run for governor. #wigovdebate https://t.co/kNMsrtTPl1
We have invested more actual dollars in education than ever before. We have shown that it is possible to lower taxes and invest record dollar amounts in our priorities. Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin does not have to choose between lower taxes and more money for schools.
Healthcare premiums are going down by more than expected in 2019 because of our market-based reforms. Two weeks ago, we announced that premiums are expected to go down by an avg. 4.2%. #wigovdebate https://t.co/FhehwjJrNB
Tony Evers should stop the scare tactics -- pre-existing conditions are covered in Wisconsin, and as long as Scott Walker is governor they always will be. #wigovdebate
Cancer survivors, Lt. Gov. Kleefisch and Rep. Felzkowski have called out Tony Evers’ lies about pre-existing conditions coverage. #wigovdebate
As long as he is governor, Scott Walker has committed that people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions will always be covered. #wigovdebate https://t.co/Cr77gZObbY
The governor has long supported maintaining coverage of pre-existing conditions in Wisconsin, and he’s said he will call a special in a heartbeat to pass legislation if necessary. #wigovdebate
When Tony Evers says BadgerCare for all, what he really means is government-run healthcare and higher taxes to pay for it. We want the people of Wisconsin, not the government, to be in charge of their healthcare. #wigovdebate
Once again during tonight's debate, my staff will be sharing the facts about our agenda to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come -- and the difference between talk and leadership. Let’s move forward not backward!

While Tony talks, we worked with local officials and signed bipartisan legislation allowing local utilities to help homeowners replace lead service lines &amp; put $26 million into replacing lead service lines from homes, schools &amp; daycare centers.
While Tony talks, we provided local governments with reforms that saved billions and gave flexibility so they can staff based on merit and pay based on performance. Tony wants to undo those reforms &amp; raise property taxes to pay for it.
While Tony Evers talks about local government, we’ve provided real leadership. We provided local governments with the largest increase in state aid for roads in 20 years.

We’ve cut taxes by more than $8 billion. That’s why property taxes and income taxes are lower now than in 2010. We even got rid of the state property tax. That’s good news for our hard-working taxpayers.
Tony Evers has long advocated for property tax increases. He wants to raise income taxes on farmers and manufacturers. And he will raise the gas tax by as much as a $1 per gallon. Tony’s Taxes will cost us jobs.
The tax cuts signed by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump save the typical WI taxpayers (2 working parents, 2 kids at home) $2,508. That’s not a shift, but a real cut. Tony Evers’ plan will raise the overall tax burden in WI.

NOTICE: I am going to use Tony Evers’ words and I am going to give him full credit: my education budget is a “pro-kid budget” (direct quote from Tony Evers on 2/6/2017). IRONY: Evers’ own words contradict his attack ads against me on education.
Had a fun time in La Crosse to talk about our plans for the future -- lower taxes, a strong economy, and investments in our kids. Let’s keep Wisconsin moving forward! https://t.co/dfo0stYnkp
Tony Evers is running on his budget. Either he didn’t know what is actually in it or he did and doesn’t care about plagiarism. In my book, either is a problem.
Tony Evers’ hypocrisy is amazing -- even for a Madison politician.
Tony Evers’ TV ads are attacking me on education yet his latest defense for the blatant plagiarism in his past and present budget documents is that I adopted his budget request. Which he asked me to do and called a “pro-kid budget.”
So far, Tony Evers has said it’s not a big deal (is that his message to a student who plagiarizes?), it was a one-time thing (it happened over and over) and that I adopted his budget (he submitted it hoping I would).
Why doesn’t Evers take it seriously?
Tony Evers serves on the UW Board of Regents. At UW-Madison, the writing center website says: “The University of Wisconsin–Madison takes this act of 'intellectual burglary' very seriously and considers it to be a breach of academic integrity. Penalties are severe.”
Tony Evers’ own agency says this about plagiarism: “Copying and presenting another person's work as your own is illegal and considered plagiarism.”
More news today of Tony Evers’ budget requests including plagiarism. First, it was the current budget request, now news that past budgets also included blatant plagiarism.
Farmers like Cal have really benefited from our Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit. Tony Evers wants to roll it back and raise a variety of taxes -- including property &amp; gas taxes on farmers like Cal. That'd hurt family farmers across the state. https://t.co/FWscI19L7O

FACT CHECK: Our budget invested more actual dollars into K-12 education than ever before - $11.5 billion. Plus, our reforms saved schools more than $3 billion. https://t.co/cLapJJIbND
FACT CHECK: Tony Evers called my state budget a “pro-kid budget” and told the media his priorities aligned with our priorities. He’s saying something different now, but the facts haven’t changed. (Source: 2/6/17 State Journal) https://t.co/6SPSvojooS
Looking ahead, I want to COPY Tommy Thompson and give him CREDIT for it. Two-third funding for schools AND lower property taxes. We can do both.
FACT CHECK: Gov. Tommy Thompson funded 2/3rds of schools AND cut property taxes. Gov. Jim Doyle got rid of 2/3rd funding of schools AND property taxes went up.
Channel 10/WMVS in Milwaukee will run the debate tonight at 5pm and 10pm and on Sun at 11am. There was a technical error that caused the broadcast to end before I was done with my closing statement.
Here is another video from me out on the road talking about the facts on education in Wisconsin: https://t.co/dkNisbxWyb
In the last budget we gave the largest actual-dollar investment in K-12 education in the history of this state … Tony himself called it a “pro-kid” budget. https://t.co/zQKmqUbzoF
Great to be in Green Bay with an energized crowd of friends and supporters. There’s only 17 days until the election, and we need everyone to help share our optimistic vision for Wisconsin’s future! https://t.co/TBn90LMk7U
We put together a bipartisan solution … and just last week we just got news that premiums will go down by more than 4 percent, and by 10 percent from where they would have gone without our plan. https://t.co/7L662RVmd0
Look out 👀… you better hold on to your wallets and purses because Tony Evers is going to raise your taxes. https://t.co/wPTA5SZ3zF
We have an agenda voters can rely on to keep Wisconsin moving forward -- not reckless plans that will increase taxes and cost us jobs. https://t.co/OwWOvhkhwh
Good luck to @BadgerFootball #OnWisconsin 🏈 https://t.co/Svt81gJFPy
FACT CHECK: Premiums went up in MN when they did what Tony Evers wants to do in WI. In Oct 2016, Gov Mark Dayton (D-MN) said “the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable” when premiums were going up as much as 55.8%. https://t.co/0Xky8boJdU

First post-debate stop this morning is in Glendale -- plenty of new faces eager to share our optimistic vision for the future! https://t.co/86Y7WUbp5N
FACT CHECK: In our budget, local governments received the largest increases in state aid in 20 years to maintain their local roads and bridges.
FACT CHECK: There were more school referenda proposed under Doyle than under tenure. And more recurring referenda passed under Doyle than under our tenure.
Tony Evers’ own department defines plagiarism this way: https://t.co/TSlxKXFnT5

Nice to see @Bucks won their home opener at the Fiserv Forum! 🏀 #FearTheDeer
Best part of debate: I got off stage and found out @Brewers are up 5-1!!!! https://t.co/YVaqsF0FWm
We have reached record low unemployment, more people working this year than ever before, and wages are up. After years of losing, Wisconsin is working and winning again. #wbadebate
Today our Rainy Day fund is 190 times larger than it was when we took office. Tony Evers will take us backward with reckless spending and tax hikes. #wbadebate
Local schools are now able to hire and fire based on merit and reward excellent teachers for the work they do. #wbadebate
Our reforms saved school districts more than $3.2 billion. Schools can now put more money into the classroom and less money into overhead. #wbadebate
Tony Evers will take our state backward to the days of billion-dollar deficits, double-digit tax increases, and massive job losses. We have Wisconsin working again, we cannot afford to go backward. #wbadebate
Since 2015, Wisconsin has seen an almost 30% drop in opioid prescriptions. Our H.O.P.E. Agenda is getting results in our fight against the opioid epidemic. #wbadebate https://t.co/C9HEoINH54
Our Manufacturing and Agriculture tax credit is helping job creators and family farms. Tony Evers would increase income taxes on Wisconsin farmers. #wbadebate
President Trump delivered the new trade deal which will give farmers new trade options. We support President Trump in his goal to achieve a world where there are no tariffs. #wbadebate
We created the Dairy Taskforce 2.0 to help farmers who are struggling with low prices right now. #wbadebate
We are always looking for new ways to add to our vibrant workforce. That is why we launched a workforce recruitment campaign that targets veterans to bring more quality workers to Wisconsin. #wbadebate https://t.co/VIi9qZKALw
We froze tuition at UW schools for the last 6 years and will freeze it for the next 4 years. We are committed to keeping college affordable for our students. This is how you keep Wisconsin working for generations to come. #wbadebate https://t.co/3ZrbuEHHxe
We took the power out of the hands of big government union bosses and put it back in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. #wbadebate
Developing our workforce is a top priority. That is why our agenda to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come expands Youth Apprenticeship programming to 7th and 8th graders. #wbadebate
Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has been at or below 3% for eight straight months. After massive job loss and sky-high unemployment, we have Wisconsin working again. #wbadebate
After losing 133,000 jobs and unemployment reaching 9.3% when Democrats controlled state government, our reforms have WI working. Unemployment has been at or below 3.0% for a record eight straight months. #wbadebate
The next budget will increase the amount of aid to counties to fix their roads by 30%. #wbadebate
Wisconsin families will feel Tony Evers’ pain at the pump. He said that a $1/gallon gas tax increase was “on the table,” which would cost a typical family with two drivers over $1,200 annually. #wbadebate
The last time the Democrats were in charge of state government, they raided the transportation fund. #wbadebate
When Washington and Obamacare failed, Wisconsin stepped up. We passed bipartisan legislation to drive down premiums and we are seeing results: premiums are projected to drop by an avg. 4.2% next year. #wbadebate
Healthcare premiums are going down by more than expected in 2019 because of our market-based reforms. Last week, we announced that premiums are expected to go down by an avg. 4.2%. #wbadebate https://t.co/0Ya3j7e4MZ
Cancer survivors, Lt. Gov. Kleefisch and Rep. Felzkowski have called out Tony Evers’ lies about pre-existing conditions coverage. #wbadebate
When Tony Evers says that “everything is on the table,” he means that he is going to increase your taxes — he just won’t tell you by how much. #wbadebate
The last time property taxes were this low as a percentage of personal income was the end of WWII. We have held the line on taxes, giving taxpayers some much-needed relief. #wbadebate
When Tony Evers talks about “fair” taxes, it’s fair to assume that your taxes are going up. #wbadebate
FACT: There are fewer referenda being proposed in Wisconsin under Governor Walker than they were under Governor Doyle – 735 compared to 858. Tony should get his facts straight.
Tony Evers criticizes our education investments now, but called our investment “pro-kid” before he decided to run for governor. #wbadebate https://t.co/saDrQbeumS
Tony Evers has been a DPI bureaucrat for almost two decades, yet has failed to address the achievement gap, despite calling it a priority. #wbadebate
There goes Tony Evers continuing the false attacks on our record actual-dollar investment in education. Fact: Tony Evers called our budget “pro-kid.” #wbadebate
To keep government spending accountable, we launched https://t.co/QUNZ7lrygh which shows taxpayers all of the state's expenditures online. #wbadebate
During tonight's debate, my staff will be sharing the facts about our record and our agenda to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come. Let’s move forward not backward!

The bottom-line: Tony Evers’ tax increases could total billions of dollars, and he’s still failed to justify to taxpayers what he’ll do with their money. https://t.co/UhF0yFFvBL https://t.co/GQZ2Opalpc
Our team put together a report to show the impact these tax hikes would have -- and the results are shocking…
Tony Evers won't say how much money he's going to take out of taxpayers' pockets, but he's been clear that he plans to raise taxes -- property, income, and gas taxes.

Love this headline in the New York Times (of all places): 	“Democrats Want to Beat Scott Walker. But the Wisconsin Economy Is a Hurdle.” https://t.co/1JRNEJseXa
Scott Walker’s Plan follows Tommy Thompson’s Record: 	✅ 2/3rds funding of schools	✅ Lower property taxes	✅ Welfare Reform	✅ More jobs &amp; record-low unemployment
Tony Evers wants to undo our reforms. That would take money out of the classroom and away from students and he would allow property taxes to go up to pay for it. 3/3
Looking ahead, we will fully restore the 2/3rds commitment for schools made by former Governor Tommy Thompson. I was proud to have voted for it in the state Assembly. 2/3
We will fund 2/3rds of school costs in our next state budget. Our good fiscal management and positive reforms, plus a strong economy, allowed us to make the largest actual-dollar investment in schools in our state budget while still lowering property taxes.  1/3
My wife is Type 1 diabetic. My mother is a cancer survivor. My brother has a heart condition. Covering pre-existing conditions is personal to me. And it’s the right thing to do. As long as I’m governor, people with pre-existing conditions will always be covered.

Tony Evers’ claims on health care have already been proven false, but he continues to mislead the people of Wisconsin. Our health care reforms are lowering premiums, in fact they’ll be 4.2% lower on average in ‘19! https://t.co/sQOjl9sNDs
Tony Evers’ plan will lead to higher premiums as we’ve seen in other states. Add that to his massive tax increases and he will take Wisconsin backward. Instead, we want to keep moving Wisconsin forward!
Our Health Care Stability Plan is doing exactly what we said it would do -- lowering premiums &amp; increasing choices. That’s why Republican and Democrat lawmakers voted for it and the Trump Administration approved us doing it.

FACT CHECK: Premiums went up in MN when they took the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. They just went down when they passed a plan nearly identical to the one we just approved in WI. Evers Plan = higher premium costs. Walker Plan = lower premium costs
Share our positive message! Your friends, family and coworkers need to see the facts about WI’s comeback! https://t.co/kFmxY8dyaY
Gas prices are on the rise across the country, and Tony Evers’ gas tax increase would add to the burden facing families. Check out our new ad: "Tony’s Pain at the Pump." You can also see it on screens at gas pumps across the state! https://t.co/fCTY8pQUDR
Evers left everything “on the table” when asked about raising gas taxes, and has more plans to raise property and income taxes on hard-working families — plans that would stop our comeback and take Wisconsin backward.
Tony Evers is repeating a lie that has already been proven false — his plan will raise health care costs, and our plan will lower them. It’s disappointing to see him resort to these false attacks to distract families from his plans to raise taxes. https://t.co/sQOjl9sNDs

For Tony Evers, “Government for Us” means costing us more money through higher property taxes, higher income taxes, and higher gas taxes. And Tony’s taxes will cost us jobs.

Our Child Care Tax Credit will be available to Wisconsin families to help with the burden of child care -- giving families the relief they need. https://t.co/nulEFqPl65
Wisconsin is Working! We can’t afford to turn back now.
In 2010, unemployment peaked at 9.3%. We ran on a plan to improve the economy. In 2018, we have more people in the workforce than ever before and we reduced the tax burden by more than $8 billion on the hard-working people of Wisconsin.
In 1986, Tommy Thompson said that his opponent was Tony the Taxer (Tony Earl) and that the tax increases had hurt Wisconsin’s economy. He had a plan to fix it. He won and cut taxes — and it worked!
Everything may be “on the table” when it comes to tax increases for our opponent. I’ll tell you right now – for me tax increases on property taxpayers, farmers and manufacturers, small business owners and others are not “on the table!”
Our tax relief has Wisconsin’s economy on the right track, and we’ve still invested historic amounts in our shared priorities – our opponent wants to raise your taxes &amp; take us backward. Let’s move forward &amp; keep Wisconsin working for generations to come.
On top of that, we have a positive agenda for the future that includes tax credits to help working families afford child care, students afford higher education and senior citizens afford to stay in their homes.
Our opponent would raise property taxes, raise income taxes, and said raising the gas tax by as much as a dollar was “on the table.” We will continue to cut taxes for hard-working families, and invest in your priorities in our next budget.
Plus, he plans to raise taxes on farmers and manufacturers by getting rid of a production tax credit — even at a time when our farmers are struggling. Our farmers need more money in their pocket, not less.
Our opponent said “everything is on the table” when asked by the media about a $1 per gallon gas tax increase. Now he claims he didn’t but he will not say how much he will raise the gas tax on families. A $1 per gallon increase could cost a typical family $1,200 more a year.
On transportation, we gave local governments the largest increase in 20 years for roads and bridges, while keeping our promise not to raise the gas tax without a corresponding decrease in taxes elsewhere.
On health care, we passed a market-driven solution to bring costs down for hard-working families while opposing Obamacare and its tax increases. Our opponent not only supports Obamacare, he wants to take the costly Medicaid expansion. When other states took it, premiums went up.
On education, we’ve made historic actual-dollar investments in K-12 while making sure property taxes are lower in 2018 than they were in 2010. Our opponent would raise property taxes on hard-working families.
We’ve shown that with a balanced budget and strong leadership, we can invest in your priorities while cutting taxes. Our opponent, on the other hand, wants to raise taxes on hard-working families -- but won’t tell you how much he plans to take out of your pocket.
When you hear a bureaucrat saying tax increases are going to be “reasonable,” run for cover.

JSOnline keeps false headline up all afternoon. I spelled out how to cover pre-existing conditions during my State of the State address in January.
Tony Evers’ address today should be called the State of the Unions because he’s pushing the union’s agenda that will take money away from students in the classroom and increase the costs of overhead. And he’ll let property taxes go up to pay for it.

In Jan 2010, Wisconsin unemployment was at 9.3%. In 2018, it’s been at or below 3% (previous all-time low) for 7 straight months. Wisconsin is Working. We can’t afford to turn back now.
Tony Evers own words about our budget — when he was running for his 3rd term as state superintendent. (Wisconsin State Journal 2/6/2017) https://t.co/EaSBxM8ZtD
In Wisconsin, people living with a pre-existing condition are covered. In Jan, I called for adding a state law to affirm that coverage. You can see and hear for yourself: https://t.co/heOx0w9EBH
The difference between Tony Evers and me is not how much more will be spent on education -- we already made historic investments he called “pro-kid.” The real difference is how much less will be spent in the classroom if Evers and the unions have their way repealing our reforms.
In Evers’ previous campaigns, the union-affiliated groups spent nearly 2x as much as his campaign. In our previous campaigns, we spent nearly 2x as much as all the outside groups supporting us. Unless you’re using some new math, nearly 2x as much is more than nearly 1/2 as much.
Tony Evers on the other hand will raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon. And that would put our jobs at risk. Wisconsin is working. We can’t afford to turn back now. https://t.co/KnspliOlDO

When union-affiliated special interests spent twice as much on his campaigns as he did, it makes you wonder if Tony Evers is bought and paid for by the unions.
We took the power from the big government union bosses and put it firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. Tony Evers wants to restore power to the unions that funded each of his winning campaigns.
Plus, Tony Evers wants to raise taxes on farmers. And he’s open to raising the gas tax by as much as a $1 a gallon. That would cost us jobs.
The unions and Tony Evers also want to lift the property tax caps. That would be costly for working families and senior citizens.
The unions and Tony Evers want to undo our Act 10 reforms that saved schools $3.2 billion. That would force school districts to take money away from students to put into overhead.
Tony Evers ran for State Superintendent of Public Instruction 6 times. He didn’t start winning until the union-affiliated special interest groups started spending BIG on his elections.
When union-affiliated special interests spent twice as much on his campaigns as he did, it makes you wonder if Tony Evers is bought and paid for by the unions.
In 2009, 2013 and 2017, Evers’ campaign spent $1,032,296 (including $308,737.97 in direct contributions from union-affiliated groups). During the same elections, union-affiliated special interests spent $2,368,046.03.
BREAKING NEWS: Union-affiliated special interests spent more than twice as much on Tony Evers’ winning campaigns as he did.

Good to join with state leaders for the 6th Annual Governor’s Cybersecurity Summit this morning. https://t.co/TdoaBRtIHN
We’ve kept our promises to the people of Wisconsin, we’ve balanced the budget, saved schools $3.2 billion, and even made record actual-dollar investments in education — Evers himself called our budget “pro-kid.” We stand by our words, he should too.
Despite his promises, Evers has failed to lead again, this time in the effort to close Wisconsin’s achievement gap. Now he’s resorted to making excuses — yet another example of Evers failing to take action and get a job done.
In Evers' failed effort to address the achievement gap, all he's given Wisconsin is excuses. While running for reelection in ’17, Evers blamed the achievement gap on “external things” and said “I didn’t let it happen.” … but wasn’t it a priority of his?
The achievement gap in reading and language arts subjects has seen an increase in almost all categories since Evers was elected state superintendent. Even the category that has shown the most improvement still stands at a 40.1% gap!
In fact, the achievement gap has only grown larger in most categories and held steady in others. Doesn’t seem like too much of a priority …
After calling the effort to close Wisconsin's achievement gap a priority and promising significant improvement, Tony Evers has FAILED to make notable progress in his 9+ years in office.
One of the most important things you can do in service to the people of Wisconsin is keep your promises and do what you said you were going to. I’ve done this, Tony Evers has not.

What is uncomfortable is that the teachers involved with immoral conduct mentioned in our ads still have licenses to teach. Tony Evers couldn’t even do his job. He should not be asking for a promotion.
Once the law was clear, Tony Evers’ agency still did not revoke the licenses of teachers involved in immoral conduct.
Now, Tony Evers claims to have worked with lawmakers to change the law but he didn’t even testify on the bill himself and GOP lawmakers don’t recall talking to him about it.
What is pathetic is that Tony Evers didn’t even try to revoke the license of the porn-watching teacher who said awful things about female students. Instead, he sided with the union and used a bureaucratic excuse.

Tony Evers failed to do his job. He shouldn’t be promoted to a new one.
Another teacher used social media to solicit a student for sex. That student reported the facts to the school district and to the police, but Tony Evers refused to revoke the license.
Well, the law was changed. Still, Tony Evers did not revoke the license of other teachers involved in immoral conduct. One teacher tried to get special education students to bring up porn on their phones. The school district fired him but Tony Evers refused to revoke the license.
Even though he had personally testified on bills in the past and even though he was at a press conference in the Capitol days before the public hearing, he sent someone else to testify about the bill.
Then Tony Evers claimed that he worked with Republican and Democrat lawmakers to change the law. But legislative leaders say they have no recollection of him personally working on the legislation.
Tony Evers sided with union and refused to revoke the license of the porn-watching teacher. He used a bureaucratic excuse that the law would not let him.
Even though the school, parents, and I all asked him to revoke the license, and both me and the school noted that we believed that he had the legal authority to do so, he didn’t even try.
When a teacher in the Middleton/Cross Plains School District was caught repeatedly watching porn in the classroom, the school board and plenty of concerned parents asked State Superintendent Tony Evers to revoke the license of the teacher.

Traditional Youth Apprenticeships have more than doubled since I took office. Last year, we started providing funding for every school to do academic and career plans in 6th grade.
Among the goals of our plan to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come is to make Wisconsin No. 1 in the nation for graduation rates. With record levels of employment this year, we need every student to graduate!  #EducationGov
Providing this curriculum earlier will ensure Wisconsin’s students know all of the educational opportunities and career paths that are available to them, and help them plan their classroom learning for the years ahead.
The expanded Youth Apprenticeship program will provide hands-on, age-appropriate opportunities both in the classroom and in the community across a variety of industries.
Currently, Youth Apprenticeships are available to 11th and 12th graders – our plan will extend programming to all high schoolers as well as 7th and 8th graders. #EducationGov
It was good to be back at the Rotary Club of Milwaukee to talk at their lunch meeting about our plans for student success and building our workforce through things like expanding Youth Apprenticeships to 7th and 8th graders. https://t.co/s7xDdrZc4Y

Our reforms saved schools $3.2 billion and allowed schools to staff based on merit and pay based on performance. That allows them to put the best and the brightest into the classroom. #EducationGov

Tony Evers got his facts all wrong in his first ad and actually made our point about why our plan is better on health care! https://t.co/qgpz2ZcXAr
Great to visit Franklin and Elkhorn this past weekend to fire up our grassroots army! https://t.co/8uz6bhM9u4 Check out our plans for Wisconsin. ⬇️ https://t.co/CZRjWjuDrl
So Tony Evers’ ad makes the case for why the WI Health Care Stability Plan will help lower premiums and makes the case for why expanding Medicaid will not likely lead to lower premiums.
FACT CHECK: Our WI Health Care Stability Plan (reinsurance like MN’s plan) passed earlier this year with bipartisan votes and was approved by the Trump administration last month for 2019.
FACT CHECK: Marketplace Average Benchmark Premiums are lower in 2018 in MN after enactment of a reinsurance plan passed by GOP lawmakers that is very similar to our plan.
FACT CHECK: According to the Kaiser Foundation, the Marketplace Average Benchmark Premiums in 2017 were $368 in WI and $412 in MN. MN started taking the Medicaid expansion in 2013.
Foxconn Bonus! https://t.co/UUjLKMRQeo
To keep WI moving forward, we have a plan to build on our success by working to keep our graduates here, reduce student loan debt, support working families, and help seniors stay in their homes -- all will keep Wisconsin working for generations to come. https://t.co/k30JkcygNF
Evers is struggling to run against our record of real results for Wisconsin’s hard-working families, and now he’s resorting to attacks that only mislead voters -- it’s unfortunate and disappointing to see from a candidate interviewing to hold the governor’s office.
Minnesota’s premiums dropped only after embracing a plan similar to our Wisconsin Health Care Stability Plan. https://t.co/WccSvQgNFJ
What Evers fails to mention is that Minnesota saw one of the highest increases in health care premiums even AFTER accepting the Medicaid expansion -- their Democrat governor said: "The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people."
Not surprising -- Tony Evers has his facts wrong in his very first general election TV ad. He’s actually making the case for OUR health care reforms instead.

Our plan will provide a tax credit for working families to ease the burden of child care costs. We will also continue to lower the burden on hard-working taxpayers and will seek to continue the Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday. https://t.co/YQT2h9T8tw
Our $100-per-child tax rebate and the Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday help families as they prepare for school. Still, the high cost of child care is a burden and often a barrier to entering or staying in the workforce.
We are fighting to help working families make ends meet. We lowered property taxes and income taxes. Our Wisconsin Healthcare Stability Plan will drive down premiums, increase choices and improve health care.
Honored to join with Wisconsin’s Veterans today. During our time in office, the unemployment rate for Veterans in Wisconsin fell to one of the lowest rates in the country! Now, we’re working even harder to bring more Veterans into our workforce.

“Republican Party's New Ad Highlights Two More Cases of Evers' Failing to Protect Students”	https://t.co/HTxOyMh97k
Now, Evers has yet another excuse. He says he needed the student to testify, even though the student already gave statements to the school and police, and other students corroborated the story.
The @journalsentinel reports: "She Snapchats me sexual things. She sends me close to nudes, but not fully showing anything," the male student said in a written statement. "When she is sexting me, she says how she wants to have sex in her storage closet or meet somewhere."
A teacher used Snapchat to send disturbing messages to a student. That student talks to school officials and to the police. The district fires the teacher. Tony Evers refuses to revoke her license. https://t.co/wsHpaZS7p7
Wisconsin’s comeback is just getting started! Lower taxes, record-low unemployment and historic actual dollar investments in Wisconsin’s classrooms -- the list goes on and on! https://t.co/BBQzMysuRm

Elections are about vision for the future. But they are also about record. Discussing Tony Evers’ troubling record of not revoking the licenses of fired teachers with questionable backgrounds is a legitimate issue. And an epic fail.
We believe Evers could have legally revoked the license of the porn-watching teacher from Middleton. But even if you believe his excuse that he couldn’t because the law had to be changed, why didn’t he revoke licenses in more of the many troubling cases after the law was changed?
A school administrator whose license Tony Evers refused to revoke went to another school district in Illinois and got a job. Later, he was fired after several female staff members accused him of sexual harassment. Had Tony Evers revoked his license, he wouldn't have worked there.
Another teacher used Snapchat to solicit a student to have sex. The school district fired her. Tony Evers would not revoke her license.
That same teacher asked students to log on to their computers for him so he could use their student accounts right after asking if they could view porn at school.
That same teacher was found with his pants down in a classroom by another teacher who entered the room.
One teacher asked special education students if they could look up porn on their phones at school. He then tried to get them to bring up the pornography on their phones. The school district fired him. Tony Evers would not revoke his license.
Even after the law was changed, however, Tony Evers did not revoke the licenses of some fired teachers with troubling records.
We believe that Tony Evers had the legal authority to revoke the license of the porn-watching teacher in Middleton, but he claimed the law needed to be changed.

To reduce student loan debt and to help keep our graduates here, we are proposing a tax credit of up to $5,000 over five years for college graduates who live and work in Wisconsin.
The @journalsentinel further reports: “GOP Rep. Steve Kestell, who authored the bill, said DPI did not push the bill and said it was the Middleton-Cross Plains School District officials who contacted lawmakers.” https://t.co/0pLfpIwHqA
A @journalsentinel story suggests that Evers was NOT directly involved in changing the law to make it easier to revoke teachers licenses. It says a DPI staffer talked to the legislative author and that DPI staff testified at the hearing, but no mention of Evers’ involvement.
Tony Evers didn’t do his job. He shouldn’t be asking for a promotion. Parents and the school district asked Tony Evers to revoke the license of the porn-watching teacher. He didn’t even try. Instead, he sided with the union.

Now, he claims that he had no choice. Back then, I too asked him to revoke the license. We believed that the male teacher’s action to view multiple pieces of pornographic materials at school put students at risk who would be coming in and out of the classroom. 3/6

When Evers failed to exercise his authority, we supported reinforcing it so no bureaucrat could again stand idly by when our children were in danger.

I agree with the Middleton-Cross Plains School District statement that said: “Our state superintendent clearly doesn’t believe viewing pornography in school over a long period of time justifies license revocation.” Tony Evers didn’t do his job.

And finally, we’re working to make child care affordable for Wisconsin’s working families. We’re planning to offer a tax credit and seek to continue our Back-to-School Sales Tax Holiday in the future.
Our plan also helps Wisconsin’s seniors. In the past, too many of our seniors faced a financial crunch with high property taxes, high prescription drug costs and high health care costs. We will provide a tax credit for senior citizens to stay in their homes.

Today we’re traveling around the state to lay out our plan to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come -- we’ll also be laying out our plan here on Twitter! First off, we want to connect students with careers by expanding youth apprenticeships to both 7th and 8th grade.
With record-low unemployment, more money in education, lower taxes, WI's on a roll -- but we’re just getting started. Now, we're sharing our plan to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come! Help us spread the news &amp; share! https://t.co/GvFVcfwwjT
Thanks for your support! The choice in this race is to move Wisconsin forward or take a giant step backward. Let’s move FORWARD! https://t.co/ow1Jy4CdP2
These goals are just the beginning of what we have planned for Wisconsin -- as I said, in the days ahead, we’ll be laying out our plans to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come! I’m now asking for your support as we work to keep moving Wisconsin forward together!
The choice is simple: do we take a giant step backwards and watch more of our graduates flee the state to pursue their careers or do we continue to move forward as we keep Wisconsin working for generations to come.
Sadly, our opponents endorse many of the same policies that got this state into trouble in the past. We don’t want to go back to the days of double-digit tax increases, billion dollar budget deficits and record job loss. That would be a giant step backward.
We want Wisconsin’s working families to be able to keep more of their take-home pay. To do that, we want to have one of the largest reductions in the tax burden for working families of any state in the nation.
We want Wisconsin to have some of the best health care systems in the country for quality. Along with that, we want to have one of the greatest reductions in opioid and illegal drug addiction of any state.
We want our high school graduation rate to be one of the best in the nation w/ our students truly ready for college &amp; a career. &amp; w/ unemployment levels at historic lows, we want WI to have one of the highest percentages of people in the workforce of any state in the nation.
We want Wisconsin to be one of the best states in America for millennials AND for retirees.
I heard it from families as we traveled around the state on our 21-city bus tour. We want to build on our record investments in education, on our $8 billion in tax cuts, on our reforms to make health care affordable, and so much more.
Tomorrow, I'll travel WI w/ Rebecca Kleefisch to lay out details for our plan of action for the next four years. We'll tell you what we're for -- in sharp contrast to the months of hearing Democrats tell you what they're against. I believe voters want to vote for something.
Wisconsin is working -- and we are moving the state forward with our bold reforms that are having a positive impact across the state. Now, we are planning to build on our track record of getting positive things done for the people of Wisconsin.
We did all of this &amp; still had enough to reduce the burden on hard-working taxpayers in WI by more than $8 billion. Today, property taxes &amp; income taxes are lower than they were in 2010. That’s good news for working families, senior citizens, small biz owners &amp; family farmers.
After Washington failed to repeal Obamacare, we took action to address skyrocketing premiums -- our plan will lower premiums next year. We’ve invested in worker training to help those who want to work find not just a job, but a career.
After sparking our state’s comeback and taking power away from the big government unions, we’ve made historic actual-dollar investments in our schools -- allowing school districts to staff based on merit and pay based on performance.
Unemployment has hit a record low, and we’ve been below the previous record low of 3 percent for 5 straight months. More people are working in Wisconsin than ever before.

Honored to attend the funeral visitation for Sen. Mike Ellis today. He was a giant in the Legislature and a bigger-than-life personality in Wisconsin politics. Tonette and I are praying for his family.
Looking ahead, I will keep visiting the victims of crime and assure them that I will not let violent criminals out of prison early. As long as I’m governor, violent criminals will serve their full sentences.
How can Tony Evers say he is looking out for the best interest of children when he supports a plan to cut the prison population by 50%. Today, that would put thousands of criminals with violent offenses out on the streets.
The real story is simple: my opponents want to cut the prison population by 50% — which today would let thousands of violent offenders out early. I will NOT let violent criminals out early, period.
Whether or not violent criminals stay in prison for their entire terms is an issue that people care about. The Democrats are trying to distract from that issue because their policies are dangerous!
Democrats desperately want to talk about anything (visits, management, sentencing practices, etc.) but the fact that their plan will let thousands of violent criminals out of prison.
Entry to the prison system is determined by judges (not the governor) at the time of sentencing.  A governor controls how many are released from prison early or not. I choose to NOT let violent criminals out early. This will be a clear choice in the election.
If you don’t want criminals convicted of violent felonies out of prison early, then I am your choice for governor.  This will be a deciding issue for those who care about public safety.

Democrats are not disputing they want to cut the prison population by 50% and cannot dispute that cutting it by 50% now would release thousands with violent offenses. Reaction is to try and deflect from story.
Years ago, I pushed Truth-in-Sentencing because people deserve certainty: law enforcement, prosecutors, juries, judges, society and — most importantly — victims deserve to know that a violent criminal will serve their entire sentence in prison.
Keeping our children, our vulnerable, and our seniors safe is a fundamental role of government. I take that seriously, which is why I will not let a violent criminal out of prison early.
67% of the prison pop. in WI committed at least 1 violent crime — things like: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, manslaughter, kidnapping &amp; sexual assault. Cutting the prison pop. by 50% would require thousands of violent criminals to be let out early. That’s wrong!
Liberals seem to think that everyone is in prison just for possession of marijuana. The facts show that 89% are in for more than drug crimes.  Many of the 11% in for drug crimes are dealers and involved with trafficking.
A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%. That would require the release of thousands of violent felons. I will not release violent criminals before the end of their sentence. This is one of the clearest differences in the race.
When it comes to violent criminals in prison, I want to keep them in for their full sentence. Democrats want to let them out early. https://t.co/ikfVwqB2oX

Foxconn must earn their tax credits based on actual investment and job creation. No jobs and investment, no credits. Thankfully, Foxconn is already hiring and already investing in companies that employ people in nearly every one of our 72 counties!
Let’s be clear: Obamacare is collapsing. Washington failed to act, so Wisconsin is leading yet again. Our bipartisan plan got approval from the Trump Administration and now we’re going to help drive down premiums, increase choices &amp; improve health care!
Stopped by HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center in Green Bay to sign our WI health care stabilization plan now that we received a waiver from the Trump Administration. Premiums will be an estimated 11% lower than they would have been in 2019 under Obamacare exchanges. https://t.co/sWdAfqwqEY

The Democrat candidates for governor are pretty much the same – far to the left. No matter who comes out of the primary, we know the out-of-state special interest money will be supporting them and targeting us.
Before we took office, Democrats cut education and increased taxes. Our reforms invested historic amounts into education -- $200 more per student this school year and $204 more per student in the fall -- all while providing over $8 billion in tax relief.

Construction wages are up by more than 50% from Dec 2010 to Dec 2017!
Private sector wages are up by more than 25% from Dec 2010 to Dec 2017!
There are more job openings posted at https://t.co/A79QOb193L than there are people who are unemployed in Wisconsin. That means that every able-bodied, working-age adult should be in the workforce -- and not on welfare.
Wisconsin had the highest number of people employed in state history a month ago!
The labor force participation rate is 68.9%. That is also one of the best in the entire country!
The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is down to a record low of 2.8%. That is one of the best in the entire country!

In addition, Foxconn has to earn the tax credits. They don’t get the full amount unless they create 13,000 jobs, pay an average of $53,873 + benefits, and invest $10 billion in Wisconsin.
An independent report from the Milwaukee Metropolitan Association of Commerce shows that the project will provide an $18 dollar return for every $1 worth of incentives from the state.
When fully operational, to put WI first, it’s been estimated that Foxconn will spend about $1.4 billion annually in goods and services sourced from throughout WI. That is 4x what Oshkosh Corporation -- a great WI company -- does with 700 companies in 140 communities across WI.
Foxconn will provide 13,000 good-paying, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin through their $10 billion investment to build one of the largest advanced manufacturing campuses in the world.

We doubled youth apprenticeships. Doubled funding for Fab Labs. Increased early college credit. We fully fund academic and career plans in 6th grade to get students on a career path.
Our state budget puts more actual dollars into schools than ever before -- an extra $200 per student this past school year. Another $204 per student on top of it in the fall.
Our Act 10 reforms allow schools to staff based on merit and pay based on performance. That means they can put the best and the brightest teachers in the classroom.
Our reforms put local school board members back in charge of our schools instead of special interests.
Proud to be the Education Governor in Wisconsin.
Great to see all these young women working to learn about what it takes to provide real leadership. Programs like Badger Girls State teach the importance of public service, patriotism, and hard work. https://t.co/fjE77tQPph
I am a pro-education governor — after balancing our budget and putting the state back on track, we’re now able to invest in our shared priorities! https://t.co/w2oDpdB4ep

Our Health Care Stability Plan will help provide lower premiums, more choices and less government.
During our administration, we covered everyone living in poverty under Medicaid – for the first time in the history of the state. And we did it without taking the Medicaid expansion of Obamacare.
Our plan will see a major reduction in overdoses related to opioid and illegal drug abuse. We want to get people healthy and working again.
We also want a long-term commitment for SeniorCare – the program that provides help for seniors with prescription drug costs.
Next, we want to guarantee in Wisconsin law that people with pre-existing conditions like cancer or other serious diseases or ailments have health care coverage.
Our Health Care Stability Plan will help lower premiums on the individual market to make health care more affordable for people across Wisconsin.

Today is #NationalCancerSurvivorsDay, we fought for health care reforms that cover pre-existing conditions so that those who have cancer or other serious ailments don’t have to worry. https://t.co/GEcfdVxNc1
Before we took office, Democrats cut education and increased taxes. Our reforms have invested historic amounts into education -- $200 more per student this school year and $204 more per student in the fall -- all while providing  over $8 billion in tax relief.
When Democrats controlled state government, big union bosses were prioritized over our students. We passed reforms and put school districts and parents back in charge — but there is more to be done!
With our record of accomplishments – historic investments in our classrooms, reforms to create more stable health care with increased options and over $8 billion in tax relief – Democrats should recognize that our reforms have proven results. Wisconsin is working!
The extreme liberals running for governor continue to push for more government-run, Washington-based health care -- on the other hand, we are advocating for personalized, patient-centered care that treats you like a person.
Despite the results and successes that our bold reforms are achieving for Wisconsin, Democrats continue to advocate for the failed policies of the past. We need to show them this November that Wisconsin is working and we want to continue moving forward! #WIWorking

After Washington failed to act on health care, we took action — reforming our health care system to work toward more stable care with lower premiums and more options. A #BlueWave would bring with it more government &amp; fewer choices.
Because of our reforms, we can afford to put more actual dollars than ever before in our schools -- $200 more per student this year, $204 more per student next year – plus more Sparsity Aid for rural districts. Don’t let a #BlueWave sweep away our progress!
Wisconsin now has RECORD-LOW unemployment at 2.9%, down from its peak of 9.3% when Democrats were in charge. We can’t let a #BlueWave take us backward!

Wisconsin is working with RECORD-LOW unemployment thanks to our reforms, but the risk of a #BlueWave puts everything in jeopardy – balanced budgets, collective bargaining reforms, $8B in tax cuts, welfare reform &amp; more.
Big government special interests flooded Wisconsin with distorted facts &amp; misinformation. Next, they'll target me and work to undo our bold reforms. We need to keep moving #WIForward &amp; make sure a #BlueWave of outside special interest money doesn’t take us backward.
Tonight’s results show we are at risk of a #BlueWave in WI. The Far Left is driven by anger &amp; hatred -- we must counter it with optimism &amp; organization. Let’s share our positive story with voters &amp; win in November.

Holder &amp; Steyer &amp; Soros -- along with the SEIU, AFL/CIO, AFSMCE, ACLU &amp; plenty of other liberal groups &amp; big government unions -- will spend millions attacking the positive things we have done to help the people of WI.
Obama’s AG Eric Holder &amp; his Washington, D.C. group will spend millions -- along with plenty of other ultra-liberal organizations and big government union bosses -- trying to get voters to ignore the facts of the Wisconsin Comeback.
Obama’s AG, Eric Holder, came to campaign for Rebecca Dallet, calling her a “progressive” in a non-partisan race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Obama AG Eric Holder &amp; his Washington-based liberal special interest group have targeted WI. They were able to force special legislative elections 12 days after the ballot is already set for the fall elections. Watch for them to spend millions against us in the fall.

Holder’s group wants to win elections for governor with the hopes that they can use redistricting to permanently change the makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives and put Nancy Pelosi back in charge as speaker.
Eric Holder and the other liberals from Washington, D.C. are using the situation in Wisconsin to raise money for their battles in the fall.
The members of the state Legislature will adjourn at the start of April and will not be back until a new Legislature is seated after the fall elections.
Nomination papers for the fall elections are due by 6/1/18. The special elections for 2 vacant legislative seats will be held on 6/12/18. In other words, candidates for the fall elections will be officially on the ballot before the special elections are held.
Nomination papers for candidates running in the 2 special elections are due by 4/17/18. Candidates for the fall elections can begin to circulate nomination papers on 4/15/18.
Obama Attorney General Eric Holder and his Washington, D.C.-based special interest group are behind the legal push to force Wisconsin taxpayers to pay for special elections for seats that will be filled in a few months in the normal elections.

When the Democrats ran things, our employment rate was at 9.3 percent. NOW, we’ve hit a historic, ALL-TIME LOW at 2.9 percent! Our reforms have Wisconsin working, now is the time to keep moving forward, not backward! #WIWorking
Our unemployment rate of 2.9 percent has NEVER BEEN LOWER. With today’s news, we’ve set a record for the lowest unemployment rate in Wisconsin’s history! #WIWorking https://t.co/1bJ8GyyKpM

Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.9% is the lowest (best) in state history. Future's so bright, I gotta wear shades! 😎 https://t.co/n2M7GU8zIU

Democrat leader in the State Senate said she’d rather spend taxpayers’ money on “anything else” — as opposed to sending the larger-than-expected surplus back to the hard-working taxpayers.
We’re cutting taxes to put more money back into the pockets of hard-working taxpayers – it’s your money anyway, not the government’s! https://t.co/pCJRGZIboW
In Wisconsin, we get things done. Pleased to see our school safety initiative making progress in the legislature. Every child has the right to feel safe at school. https://t.co/AJdakVFIu6
We’re taking our surplus and returning it back to the hard-working taxpayers. A $100-per-child tax rebate and a sales tax holiday is a conservative idea – we’re making tax cuts and our reforms real.
We’ve kept our promise to lower the tax burden – let’s keep fighting to cut more taxes and put more money back into your pocket! #WIForward		✅ $8 billion in tax relief by the end of 2018	✅ $100-per-child tax rebate &amp; sales tax holiday	✅ Property &amp; income taxes lower than 2010

Plus, almost all of it will go right back into the economy as parents buy back-to-school items. This will help build an even bigger surplus for the future. 2/2
A $100 per child tax credit is one of the quickest and easiest ways to get the bigger than expected surplus back to the hard-working taxpayers. 1/2
Great crowd in La Crosse for the @wisgop’s field office opening! Our bold reforms are producing positive results for the people of Wisconsin. We must organize and become energized to keep moving #WIForward! https://t.co/HyzHCMx6sF
Through the end of this budget, the cumulative impact of our tax relief is $8 billion. Much of that went to cut property &amp; income taxes, but some was for targeted tax relief. Now, it is time to give families a tax break! 👍

Typical WI taxpayer - family with both parents working and 2 kids at home - will save $2,508 under federal tax cut. Doubling of the child tax credit is big part of it.

Washington has failed to act on health care, so it is time for Wisconsin to lead. I propose we enact a law that guarantees coverage of pre-existing conditions. We must provide comfort and stability for the people of Wisconsin. https://t.co/HAxBVHoyaZ

Sending the surplus back to the hard-working taxpayers is a conservative idea. With our child tax credit, we are making tax cuts and our reforms real.
We propose to send the larger-than-expected surplus back to the hard-working taxpayers with a $100 check for every child under 18 living at home. For most families that will help with this: https://t.co/Yd4Sjfwdx0

People in WI want stability in healthcare. Our Healthcare Stability Plan ensures that pre-existing conditions are covered, Seniorcare is permanent and premiums are lower. We are helping provide stability in healthcare in WI!
Just as we did when we found our own way to cover everyone in Wisconsin living in poverty for the first time ever, we are finding unique Wisconsin-based solutions to healthcare.
