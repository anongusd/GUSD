Last time I looked the were a whole bunch of Dutch, British and German bankers behind the Chinese banks. China was colonized JUST LIKE America. Just like the Khazars/Huns who colonized Europe and turned the Viking Leaders into their warrior kings.
The REAL problem is that dirty money controls the world. The fact that criminals launder money in construction projects is ruining society.
China is a huge globalist scam. China is modern slavery. Same type of corrupted individuals that are ruining Canada. https://t.co/sq80PzIX3y
