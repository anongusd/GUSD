@GinaGladden2 @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump For America!
@LisaMei62 @ibfireproof NEWSFLASH! DWS was also in office in Broward County during the 2000 Bush/Gore Hanging Chad election. Parkland shooting was in Broward County.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump The businessman President.
@washingtonpost Businessman's lesson #1  Assess body language.

@prayingmedic YUUUGE big picture President. Talking about cleaning up 50 years of giving America away for the pleasure of past presidents and their friends. Words of truth and businessman like focus on what America was cheated out of.
@PressSec @POTUS Everyone else's body language vs The President. Who's in charge now?
@washingtonpost He will be missed. Godspeed.
@dustingold @POTUS @PolkCoSheriff I'm praying for more good guys to stand tall. Tired of corrupt law enforcement like in Parkland. Thanking The Lord for people with the guts to deal with this. #ThesePeopleAreSick
@LizCrokin @Liz The Lord will prevail.
@LizCrokin "Why do I even bother?" Because you're/we're called to shine onto darkness. Darkness is coming to light and the demons and the enemy are putting up a fight.
@LizCrokin @ChelseaClinton Simple. We worship the light of day, Satanists worship in the dark of night. We feel rewarded by God for doing good. Satanists feel rewarded by dong bad. The more good we do, the better we feel. The worse things they do to please Satan the more they feel rewarded by Satan.
@IdyllicLiving Tucson. Creepy. Map these other Satanic ritual sites nationwide and it gets worse. https://t.co/FBAuc7O7iY

@LizCrokin Jesus loves them, good enough for me. I'm for anyone who sold their soul and wants it back.
@therealroseanne I had to apologize to someone on Twitter yesterday for mis-speaking. Apologize honestly and move on.
@just4sc @Cici_94Percent @RealCandaceO My apologies, I was the exception.
@JackPosobiec Did Obama open our southern border for unaccompanied minors to disappear them here for some sick reason? #ThesePeopleAreSick
@DuncanTucker I was in Guadalajara in 2015 when they hit the helicopter and took over the city. Worse than reported. The Govt turned off the internet in GDL to stop information flow to the rest of the country, USA and the world. Govt and cartels intentionally turn off the news in MX regularly.
@RealCandaceO Sadly, our children won't know this either as history is being rewritten in new textbooks all across the country in our public school system.
@RealJamesWoods @becki_p20 Imagine the family reunion coming at at Gitmo. They'll be bringing in family from all over the world, and think of the family photo!

@Flipdawg17 @ASavageNation @POTUS #classicartofthedeal
@gal_deplorable Past Presidents continue to cheer for America. @BarackObama takes cover.
@RealCandaceO @HillaryClinton Historically epic FAIL.
@ASavageNation Kim will be back, and even more capitulated and on his knees.
@ACTBrigitte That really hurts, Di Nero, I bet he'll stay away now for sure.
@PressSec @POTUS You have the guts to to walk away from the table, like a Boss. #MAGA
@gal_deplorable We legalize marijuana and the cartels switch to fentanyl smuggling. The cartels are not stupid, they run Mexico. Fact.
@FoxNews @Jim_Jordan Bring it!
Thank you @Jim_Jordan for having the guts to deal with this crap.
@realDonaldTrump The real Q..estion is, where is @BarackObama retiring?
@mflynnJR HUMA has HUUUUGE problems.
@RealCandaceO @RealBenCarson @TheDemocrats @charliekirk11 You're making a real difference young lady. As an older American, I'm hoping to see young American movers with common sense rise up, you are now one of them. I've been following you a long time and it's about time the world wakes up. Nice work! #MAGA
@gal_deplorable These people are sick
@gal_deplorable Absolute no brainer.
@StefanMolyneux Animals
@washingtonpost Any fight with drug makers is a good fight. Their complicit in the Opioid crisis!
@GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec Consider it persecution. Proverbs 31 woman. I thank you for your service @PressSec.
@gal_deplorable Sad.
@nwoinfowarrior The next Epstein island?
@gal_deplorable Enjoying the show!
@FiveRights @gal_deplorable I'll take #3, for $100.
@ACTBrigitte Now, that's Presidential!
@MagniFieri @realDonaldTrump Now, that's Presidential!
@PressSec Now, that's Presidential.
@anon_vino @LizCrokin So sick.
@kritter1963 @LizCrokin Wikipedia that!
@LizCrokin @JingoistJ An abomination.
@realDonaldTrump Violating the Logan Act.
@rcjhawk86 @ROHLL5 Violating the Logan Act.
@Jillibean557 @GrizzleMeister @nypost Q. These people are sick.

@gal_deplorable Creepier by the day.
@GrizzleMeister The MSM Cartel
@gal_deplorable How about that?!
@AtheisticLib @GovMikeHuckabee And Jesus loves you.
@AtheisticLib @GovMikeHuckabee An athiest inturpiting the Bible.
@AtheisticLib @GovMikeHuckabee Out of context to my comment.
@RealWolvesUSA1 @ColoradoGirl2A @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @DineshDSouza Matthew 10:16 ‚ÄúI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
@phil200269 @ColoradoGirl2A Q. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK.
@PressSec Wonderful to see a Proverbs 31 woman in American leadership.
@GovMikeHuckabee A woman of wisdom and grace. Proverbs 31.
@cnni @QAnonPatriot Why did Kim just mysteriously capitulate so quickly? Maybe @POTUS gave Pompeo dircecive to give to Kim on thier Easter weekend visit. Capitulate or join the rest at Gitmo.
@prayingmedic Matt 10:16 ‚ÄúI am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves."
@washingtonpost The #WHCD is a relic of the past, rife with tearing people down instead of building them up. Just not a positve thing for America. #MAGA
@GovMikeHuckabee You should be proud of your daughter for showing such wisdom and class, good parenting does that. Proverbs 31.
@PressSec Only a lady of true conviction and wisdom can stand up to childish and vile insults. I'm proud of you. Proverbs 31.
@CNN It takes a strong woman to take insult over insult with class and dignity.
@gal_deplorable Does Bill know something we don't?
@FoxNews Life is getting good now that the underminer-in -chief is gone.
@gal_deplorable 4D chess at it's best. @realDonaldTrump
@CNN Imagine the pressure TRUMP put on Kim.
@ChrisJZullo @Angelbjoy101 Not Donald Trump? Then who structured those sanctions and dispatched diplomats to implement them?
@kanyewest Woke AF.
@WSJ And, who brought Kim to the table. Got to give credit where credit is due.
@CNN I spy a spy.
@KanyeWoke The people are!
@gal_deplorable Sick, evil and demonic.
@RealJamesWoods Simple, because his common sence ideas are are working.
@FoxBusiness @POTUS Rare Opioid survivor here. Mr. President, fixing the problem is easy. Follow the money.
@qanon76 @kanyewest He's Red Pilling everyone like crazy! Go!
@MAGA_TRUTH_ @antischool_ftw He got Red Pilled, welcome back to reality. Keep spreading the word.
@antischool_ftw Dude got Red Pilled. Welcome back to reality.
@RealCandaceO Don't worry, the white left will pimp anyone for their agenda.
@MicheleBachmann Congrats on your Salon article from 2012. Written before it's time, and it's about time right now.
@washingtonpost I lived in Mexico for 11 years and never once did I see a VOTE HERE sign in English.

@zergmans @ericbolling @zergmams You're despicable. @ericbolling Praying for you.
@realDonaldTrump Perscription opioid survivor here. Where's the problem? Follow the $. Who makes RX opioids? Who passes laws that take $ from big pharma? Who gets paid to sell? Only way out 6 years ago was to ask God for strength. Kicked cold turkey. It can be done.
@ericbolling Opioid survivor here, almost didn't make it. The gov't wants us drugged up and blind. Jesus was the only way out of it. Been praying for you and yours @ericbolling.
