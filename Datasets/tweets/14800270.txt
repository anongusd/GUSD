10/ Have you experienced age bias at work? Are you considering retirement? Or are you a leader trying to navigate these demographic changes? Join us to talk about these issues and much more: https://t.co/I5IW6Xrd9X
9/ And there's a growing market for innovations that can make a huge difference in the lives of older people. https://t.co/RPRPKgA4sh
8/ But there's hope. Especially if leaders step up to the challenge of managing a five-generation workforce. https://t.co/1QHOwJwUvC
7/ Broadly, this demographic shift and its effects could lead to generational conflict. https://t.co/vNHCHapCP9
6/ Caregiving is also something companies need to focus on. Six in 10 family caregivers in the U.S. are also in the labor force, and most organizations aren't addressing their needs. https://t.co/IX9n8mETZ3
5/ There's also the question of how older employees pass on critical skills and knowledge to others. Research on manufacturers in the U.S. and Germany shows how leaders are (and aren't) tackling this issue. https://t.co/vrVQAFLMrv
4/ Skill development is one area where this manifests itself. The conventional wisdom is that people are too old or set in their ways to learn new things. This is far from the truth. https://t.co/PiOOZ6R40Y
3/ Companies aren't prepared. One big thing standing in the way are negative (and unfounded) stereotypes about older workers. https://t.co/1QHOwJwUvC
2/ This is changing the ways we think about our careers and when (or if) we'll retire. https://t.co/XLQtMJgHPp
