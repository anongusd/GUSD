@emilywestmc No one is proclaimed unwanted.  One simply should never lead a church when they can not recognize their own sinful nature.  Leaders do NOT propogate sin, they denounce it and ask for forgiveness...they do NOT try to normalize it or encourage others to participate.
@ohheykiri Umm the whole proud thing is the problem.  We repent around here for our sins, we are NOT proud of them.  We don't don't try to convince others to join us in that sinful behavior.  Just saying.
@GuthrieGF @itsmejjwarren Oh okay.  Try repenting for sin and recognizing that it is a sin.	We are all sinful and repent as such.  If you can't or won't accept your behavior in the same vein you should not be a church leader.
@SereneJones And repent for your sinful nature's like the rest of us sinners instead of asking for us to accept that such behavior is not sinful.
@Starr2013 @CNN I don't understand.  Jesus forgave for sins...these folks don't believe it is sinful.  It is.  The church made the right decision.
@thehill If folks embraced homosexuality as sinful instead of trying to convince folks it isn't &amp; repent, this may've gone differently. Just saying, left tries to normalize murder w/ abortion, normalize homosexuality, normalize adultery, heck lying is part and parcel. All a hoax!
