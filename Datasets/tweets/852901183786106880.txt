Yeah a big failure he's	To men like Trump,means however foul,don't matter,as long as goal's achieved	An that has been the saga of so called great men,on graves of vanquished,they stand tall	N o matter what,we must rally round Trump,if to gracefully complete hisfull term in office https://t.co/4FHgcXISui
The idea of nuclear confrontation's bandied about too casually nowadays	None to be'a clear winner in nuclear conflict	Outreach toDPRK,mayn't be dismissed as a fiasco	Whatever,by virtue of his age and station,Trump's a father figure_a family man after all_wilt do all to keep peace https://t.co/4HUEO0qcei

This ishow thick skinned we have gotten	Isn't mass killing of civilians,-erosion of the western values	Prosperity to its people apart,true greatness of Americas lies in keeping world peace https://t.co/r3kdHqjuiI
Lets stop it?	The idea of nuclear-war's too casually being bandied about!	There shalt be no clear winner in nuclear confrontation!	Donald J.Trump's a family man after all_	For his age and station,a fatherly figure to the entire world?	May everybody sans exception,rally round him https://t.co/mNULdl0bFG
