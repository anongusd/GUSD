@fovillian @afternoonsand @gwlauren @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams Even though the building itself was open and had held events scheduled and being conducted in the days prior and the days after.

@fovillian @afternoonsand @gwlauren @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams See that would be a problem for Republicans. They don't want everyone to vote, only the people who vote for them.

@zeynep @DavidMendels @jbouie I could go on, but you get the idea. The money while admittedly not spread out evenly is reaching a lot of different races, most of which wouldn't even be given a second glance by donors. Also should point out this past Fri, Sat and Mon raised an additional $29.3m for Dems.
@zeynep @DavidMendels @jbouie The stats bare this out: 82 Dems raised more then $500k, including 60 who raised more then $1m in Q3. This is Democratic challengers ONLY also. Ohio statewide D candidates ALL outraised R incumbents (of which all are held by GOP). Public Services Commissioner GA D raised $1m.
@zeynep @DavidMendels @jbouie Yeah and Dems are going to raise $1.5B for these midterms when in 2016 it was less then $800m in a presidential year. Beto will likely be $100m of that ok, yeah that's too much money for Texas, but that helps D's in House races downballot. $1.4B going to other candidates.

@DL_DeAngelo That‚Äôs just not true, in fact it‚Äôs the opposite. Midterms are a referendum on the president. An unpopular president makes independents/moderates/swing voters want a check for ‚Äúbalance‚Äù. Without incumbency open seats are far riper for flipping. Ex. FL-15 49-46 R, NM-02 46-45 D

@EmperorTrumptin @SeanTrende @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 Basically we weren‚Äôt focusing our energies on the right areas so we lost, but now we‚Äôre flipping seats where Republicans have vastly outraised us because of our ground game. It was painful, but needed to get to where we are currently. You don‚Äôt learn if you always succeed.
@EmperorTrumptin @SeanTrende @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 Since that election we‚Äôve flipped over 40 seats, taken Alabama, a state Supreme Court Justice seat and PA-18 since then.

@EmperorTrumptin @SeanTrende @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 No, what happened was just what I figured. When millions of people suddenly go ‚Äúwe need to do something‚Äù and have never done anything like it before there was always going to be a learning curve. We were too social media obsessed in GA-06 and too invested in knocking every door.

@SeanTrende @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 That's a good point, though since GA-06 Dems have basically swept everything in elections since. Not dismissing the overall point because I agree with it, just adding a caveat. I'm pretty sure some of the Democratic wins came where R massively outraised them, so $ may not = win.
@LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @SeanTrende @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 That makes sense, it's not the only factor in why seats are rated where they are, but it plays a major role in it. Thanks!
@SeanTrende @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 Can I ask why? I mean it was previously unheard of for any incumbent to be outraised by a challenger and now you have 54 in Q2. Money does have diminishing returns on tv, but they can spend a lot of money on the ground game. CW is a Tossup for House. Is that really where we are?
Hey @LarrySabato @kkondik @ForecasterEnten @SeanTrende @Redistrict @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 I value your insight: Are these numbers big enough to change seat ratings? Some of the Dems fundraising numbers are pretty impressive. https://t.co/uUNm11TNJJ

I know it‚Äôs hard to see, but from the ashes a Phoenix can arise as a new party could be born. For now the party needs to be turned to ash though so rebuilding a better party can begin.
@BettyBenderWV @mkraju @eclaterlaterre And Jeff Sessions for all his evil and destructive policies is allowing the Mueller probe to go on. Remember to focus on the overall picture. Any Democrat is better then any Republican.

@jlo2 @ymscott @raye8405 @SteveSchmidtSES @karenhunter @Jamestown502 @DrJasonJohnson @SXMUrbanView @MadisonSiriusXM That‚Äôs not correct. No one on the left actually wants abortion.

We actually have policies that reduce abortion: sex Ed, contraception and birth control.
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES Anyways it‚Äôs been a pleasure and I hope you‚Äôll look into the debt issue yourself if you have your doubts. Sometimes discovering something for oneself is more powerful then someone passing information along.
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES This is why I personally subscribe to the pay-up front now in investments that will pay dividends for decades like in healthcare (more productive working adults) and education (more young entrepreneurs starting businesses). It pays off multiple times what‚Äôs invested.
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES As only country to create US dollars. There‚Äôs all sorts of opinions on what the optimal ratio is, but when it comes to the US debt as long as politicians continue raising the ceiling there‚Äôs no potential to default because of US treasury bonds that are safe havens for investors
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES No worries at all, there‚Äôs too much information for one person to know everything. The US can never become insolvent because it‚Äôs the only country to create dollars and therewill always be demand for risk-free US debt investments because the US is the only nation that can do so
@TopFloorRyan @SteveSchmidtSES It honestly will depend what happens in 2018 and 2020. If the party gets walloped in both elections they might snap back to form. That or they split or the party crumbles. Parties can be rebuilt, but for now this party needs to be destroyed.
@ymscott @raye8405 @SteveSchmidtSES @karenhunter @Jamestown502 @DrJasonJohnson @SXMUrbanView @MadisonSiriusXM You know what‚Äôs kind of funny? People say most are in the middle, but when asked what policies they support there‚Äôs a lot of liberal policies in there. Where is the middle anyways? What policies are actually in the center?
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES Also if deficit spending is your concern did you know that Democrats are more fiscally responsible? Yes, it‚Äôs actually true. So join us this November to send a message to the GOP: This is not our America.		https://t.co/4jHsuTTnHS
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES Every country has debt, but with globalization we are all interconnected so thoroughly that nothing will happen unless we default on payments towards debt. Economists across the spectrum agree we will never pay off our debt but as long as it‚Äôs manageable compared to GDP we‚Äôre ok
@muncy_marlene @SteveSchmidtSES Marlene I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll read this, but you and I are very similar. I‚Äôm conservative in my spending, I am debt free and am blessed to have this life. With economics though it‚Äôs different. The amount of debt really doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs the debt to GDP ratio that matters.
