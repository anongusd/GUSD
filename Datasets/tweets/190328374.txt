This is normal &amp; necessary. Not normal is the level of anti-Trump hysteria on the left. The first order of business in the new Congress should be to secure the border &amp; open the govt. @POTUS is willing to strike a deal, he just needs Dems to put our country before politics. 2/
Unfortunately, the #116thCongress begins under the cloud of a partial government shutdown. The prosperity &amp; security of the nation are taking a back seat to the Democratic Party’s political agenda. @POTUS is asking for modest and reasonable funding to secure the border 1/

The fund sets a new tone for appropriations bills: just because you can spend it, doesn’t mean you should spend it. It’s an approach that causes us to think about what all of this deficit spending means, in whose name we're borrowing the money &amp; who will get stuck w/ debt. 4/4
We cut $585M across the bill to make an initial deposit. The money in this account can't be spent on any other govt program; it’s protected from spending process &amp; only accessible when the Treasury Secretary certifies that the budget deficit is zero or there is a surplus. 3/
It also includes many significant financial reforms that slash harmful regulations &amp; streamline agency processes. Additionally, the bill creates the Fund for America’s Kids &amp; Grandkids, which safeguards funds for future generations. 2/

So what's a CR? A "Continuing Resolution" or the continuance of Obama-era policies = postponement of @realDonaldTrump priorities.
#NDAA increases funding for national defense by $88.4 billion &amp; authorizes 20k more servicemembers. Importantly, it also provides a 2.4% pay raise for the troops - the largest in 8 years. Our men &amp; women in uniform deserve nothing less for the sacrifices they make to protect us.
Today @potus signed #NDAA into law, which sends a powerful bipartisan message to our servicemembers that national defense is a national priority again. The bill greenlights the president's plan to rebuild the military.

I urge the Senate to act quickly so we can send a final tax reform bill to the president as soon as possible. 4/4 https://t.co/sUK4OjMC5t
Additionally, the bill promotes economic growth and private-sector job creation by slashing the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and cutting tax rates for small business income to the lowest levels since World War II. 3/
It will put more money in the pockets of hard-working #Georgia families and make the annual tax filing process a lot easier. In fact, the House Ways and Means Committee predicts the typical family could file their #taxes on a form the size of a postcard. 2/

Under the right leadership and with real changes, the @CFPB can play an important role in protecting American consumers and ensuring free market competition. 5/5
The change in leadership is also an opportunity to enact significant reforms, such as restoring Congress’s constitutional role in oversight by bringing the @CFPB under the regular government funding process, a reform I included in my Financial Services Appropriations bill. 4/
For far too long, middle-class families and community financial institutions suffered at the hands of a @CFPB director who put politics above consumer needs, particularly their access to credit.  3/
The acting director appointed by President Trump must create a culture of accountability, insist on transparency and end @CFPB’s harmful attempts at vigilante justice. 2/

Biggest question about #Obamacare now is: if you have a job you like, can you keep it?
How about a permanent delay of #Obamacare @ConoverChris. The best solution for families and businesses is to repeal it.
The Admin's #Obamacare employer mandate delay is an acknowledgement that the law is hurting biz, cutting hours and costing jobs.
According to a GA insurance co, the average middle-age family of five will pay about 45% more for medical coverage in Oct under #Obamacare.
According to CBO, H.R. 2231 would generate $1.5 billion in new revenue over 10 yrs. #jobs #energyindependence
Just voted for the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act which would create over 1 million new jobs and provide cheaper energy for families.
Thanks for reading the email and tweeting your thoughts @ginny_cw.
1 yr after SCOTUS ruling, 43% of uninsured are unaware they must buy coverage. They will get penalized by #Obamacare if they don’t.
Opposed to the Senate immigration bill. Any House bill should secure the border, enforce our laws &amp; not repeat failed policies of the past.

What's your reaction to the climate agenda and the #WarOnCoal? How will higher energy prices impact your family budget or business?
Jobs are urgent priority, 76% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. Obama's climate agenda will destroy jobs and hike energy prices.
The goal should be more jobs and cheaper gas, but #ObamaEnergyPolicy calls for more regs, higher costs and less jobs. http://t.co/yBGXTsxNvC
