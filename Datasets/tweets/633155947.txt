@FrontHole_ Dossier is not a legal document like an indictment. It's the information gathering report of a private detective who was hired by a newspaper.	The dossier is not the basis for investigation against Roger Stone.	I'm not talking about the dossier. Does that answer your question?
@FrontHole_ I'm not talking about Steele dossier. I'm referring to today's indictment.   Stone had the connections. He was directing others (Credico&amp;Corsi) to pass messages to Assange. Credico had legit reason - radio show- to be contacting Assange. That would be the cover story.
