So Close
Having to talk to the bishop afterward is pretty much my excuse to not do anything bad. Ever.
@SunshineGraceee Well @beedawn13 is trying to get a reunion together with @Doll_BabyV so we need to ask her.
@SunshineGraceee Where do you think??? Waiting for you to get back!!!
Too much for one Sunday...

@beedawn13 you are blessed. :)
@beedawn13 bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha yeah okay. I buy that. You may want to question his sexuality a little bebe..... ;)
I know it's my fault but I'm gonna panic about it anyway.
Didn't understand how an ordinance like baptism or confirmation could be beautiful until today.
@Doll_BabyV WOAH. WHAT.
@armeniangirl18 :D &lt;3 :)
RT @DarbyLynRichins: I love playing the piano in primary because the kids don't judge if you mess up horribly. @TeamMorm

Hey @beedawn13 if all the messages I tried to send you on Skype actually go through you're gonna be assaulted very suddenly. Apologies.

@beedawn13 well we will have actual options once I get a phone again..... Until then twitter seems to be the best way.....
@armeniangirl18 congrats bebe!!!! As soon as I get a phone you can tell me ALL about it. Figure by Saturday I should have it. :)
Deleted my Facebook in the same week that my phone died. Guess you could say I died.
@beedawn13 my phone is also obsolete so I have been COMPLETELY out of touch with life until I got the wifi password ten seconds ago.
@SunshineGraceee are you back yet?
@beedawn13 @Doll_BabyV I'm good with that. :)
L'amour, c comme la morte sans mourir.
It's crazy how you just know. And it's nice that you don't throw it in my face.
@theoptimist134 let's see each other, yes?
Facebook's gone. I feel so liberated.....

@SunshineGraceee we are curious what Mormon dates are like. Enlighten us? @beedawn13
100 people at the branch tomorrow. Does our building even hold that many people....?
You can't be as happy as me right now. :)
I'm a disgrace to the Mormon community. I'm early.
Enjoying the last of my phone for the week. :) yay girls' camp.
I'm pretty sure there's a homicidal frog outside my window.
@theoptimist134 you're cute and I love you. :)
When there's an entire EMPTY parking lot and they park right next to you..... O.o
$672 for vaccinations. Makes me wonder how much my health is really worth to me....
Hey @SunshineGraceee bring some sunshine back east, please?
@theoptimist134 http://t.co/IioFPTdgf2 go. Watch. That's all.
@theoptimist134 I definitely told you that like 8 years ago. Lol
"To accept duality is to earn identity."
@beedawn13 those are up???
Thanks for picking up my pieces as usual. @beedawn13
Whoever thought country music rap was a good idea should be punished.
California sounds nice....
@Doll_BabyV @SunshineGraceee don't listen to a word she says Gracie I love you. :)
How the frack did I get to this meeting 50 minutes early when I left 20 minutes late....?
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair.
I refuse to apologize to anyone for loving him. Except maybe myself.
@beedawn13 time to move to Cuba.
Three more days.
La deception de la vie, c'est que c'est pas la vie qui nous trompe, mais les personnes dans nos vies.
Is there an expiration date on a second chance?
@beedawn13 @Doll_BabyV @SunshineGraceee oh that was my plan....
@beedawn13 @SunshineGraceee @Doll_BabyV just tell me when and I'll let my cousins know. :)
@beedawn13 can I have the one in the white jeans???
@beedawn13 the more I watch it the more I realize IT'S PRIVATE GIVE IT BACK
@beedawn13 can I ask.... Why do we do this here on twitter? Lol
@beedawn13 @MormonBabydoll @SunshineGraceee beach when we're all here??? Yes???
@beedawn13 has amazing beautiful talented friends and I'm so beyond jealous of her right this second....
@beedawn13 I wanna watch!!!! D: the video went away today. I'm in mourning.
@beedawn13 this week's a little booked. Next?
@beedawn13 just tell me when. :) also, we all need to have a reunion cuz it's been 141587846227 years since we've all been together.
@SunshineGraceee darling you could say that about literally every aspect of your life...
@SunshineGraceee I think in order to "stay" peppy you have to first "be" peppy. Yes? @beedawn13
@beedawn13 maybe between the both of us we can be half as happy as her.....
