...and step up to deploy to DC in a continuation of service. It is a question for all of us, to remind us that the opportunities we have been given are not for us, but others.
My life Scripture, that I have carried with me on many missions, is Esther 4:14. ‚ÄúCan it be that you were put in this position for such a time as this?‚Äù  It gave me strength to put my military career on the line in the burka battle, and lead men and women in combat...
I have been leading the effort to modernize our legal immigration system, close legal loopholes that the cartels exploit, and build President Trump‚Äôs wall.
I believe in law and order. America has a right to enforce its sovereign border. We are not just a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. And we don‚Äôt have to choose between the two.
I believe in free markets because I believe we have the most innovative entrepreneurs, workers, and scientific minds on the planet.	 	I believe in a strong defense‚Ä¶ and a strong America.
and when I am in the Senate, I will work with him to confirm judges who uphold the Constitution.
On issue after issue, by working together, we have shown an ability to solve problems and get thing done for Arizona. I have worked closely with President Trump to cut taxes for working families, to create jobs, to secure the border, to honor our veterans‚Ä¶
I have fought for our veterans and our care. And my first bill signed into law fast-tracked our veterans for jobs at the border. That‚Äôs a win/win for our vets and our security.
Only when it became a national story did she start talking about it to cover her tracks.  	 	But I‚Äôm not a talker, I‚Äôm a doer. An aviator, not a bloviator.
This is a big difference I have with my opponent. She preens and postures for the cameras, but when veterans were dying waiting for care while bureaucrats cooked the books in her own district at the Phoenix VA, she did nothing for 15 months.
And as a combat veteran myself, it is my calling to stand with our veterans to ensure they get the very best care they earned - including from the invisible wounds of war.
I have fought relentlessly to help our citizens break free from the chains of addiction, by dedicating resources to recovery and treatment.
I spearheaded legislation to improve mental health access and strengthen compliance with background checks and voted for the Stop School Violence Act to identify threats sooner and make our schools safer.
That‚Äôs why I fought to double the child tax credit and to protect the child and dependent care tax credit as part of our historic tax cuts we passed last year, because working families and single moms deserve a break. And President Trump signed it into law.
I cannot, and will not, stay silent in the face of injustice. https://t.co/dJg6dEajN5
I do not have the capacity to walk by a problem - whether it is helping a neighborliving with a terminal diagnosis, a friend looking for work, or a stray dog on the side of the road. just ask my rescue golden Boomer.
So, if you wonder where I got my grit from to attend the Air Force Academy, and tell my fellow male cadets I would one day fly fighter planes - even though it wasn‚Äôt allowed at that time - well, I was just raised that way.
My mom suddenly went from being a stay-at-home mom in her early 40‚Äôs, to being a widow and single mother of five kids. 	 	She could have spiraled into despair but instead she sprung into action. She went back to school and back to work, and spent over 30 years in public education
He suffered another heart attack the next morning at 49 and left us.  	 	Those words ‚ÄúMake Me Proud‚Äù were written on the parchment of my heart as I began the grief-stricken journey of life without him.
..he knew in his spirit he was leaving us and asked to see us kids. I was blessed to visit with him not fully understanding what was going on. And in that last conversation with my Dad, he told me to make him proud.
And in 24 hours when I was 12 years oldeverything changed. We went from a day of spending time with family, to him not feeling well, then going to the hospital. He had a heart attack and was stable but in the middle of the night...
I learned a lot from my father. He was first in his family to go to college. He served in the Navy, used his GI bill to earn a law degree, and was driven to make a better life for his 5 kids and our community.
The contrast couldn‚Äôt be more clear: I have always been true to who I am and have spent my life in service to our great country.
This is how I see this campaign. It‚Äôs a choice between a doer and a talker‚Ä¶between a patriot and a protestor‚Ä¶between a career fighter pilot and a career politician - between proven grit and Hollywood glitz. #azsen
Tonight marks the next chapter in the campaign - the beginning of a 70 day sprint to electing Arizona‚Äôs next senator. In just 43 days, the people of Arizona will start voting! #AZSEN https://t.co/1Rmws9FPr8
I am forever grateful to have had the chance to know him, learn from him, and even work with him on saving the A-10 warthog.
And candidly, it is difficult to celebrate anything this week as we mourn the loss of Senator McCain and prepare to honor him here in Arizona and in DC before he is laid to rest at Annapolis.
It is tempting to celebrate. But let‚Äôs keep in mind: this is not our objective‚Ä¶our mission is not fulfilled until we win this seat in 70 days.

I miss him so much and wish he was here today. Hug those you love today and tell them how much you love them. And treat every day truly as a gift. 		I love you Dad!		-- MM
I was blessed from all of that and it is a driving force of my life to carry on his legacy and treat every day as a gift. I can't believe it has been 40 years since I last heard his voice...
My dad was given an opportunity to be the first in his family to go to college and through others believing in him, service in the Navy, the GI Bill and hard work, he was driven to make a better life for us kids...
Forty years ago, this morning he had another heart attack and went to be with the Lord. My life was changed in deeply profound ways through the valleys of grief and despair and eventually faith that brought healing and peace as I was driven to live out his dying message to me...
I spent some time with him talking about the mundane things of life like we all do with our loved ones every day. School, swimming, the dog hobo, etc. In that conversation that I had no idea would be my last with him, he told me to make him proud...
In the night he felt in his spirit that he was going to leave us and summoned his children to come be with him. In the middle of the night in a torrential rainstorm, I remember my brother drove us to the hospital...
I was 12, and didn't know what a heart attack was but I remember going to sleep without any real fear thinking he was fine and in the hospital...
Forty years ago, last night, my dad went upstairs to lie down as he was not feeling well. My mom then took him to the hospital and came home to say he had a heart attack and we would need to help him in his recovery... https://t.co/FdzzwIeTZh

A wonderful way to honor those who gave their lives to protect our freedom. 		This was the first time the 107th was assigned a mission in France since World War II. #BRRRT https://t.co/a5p4QPKdiL

No surprise here ‚Äî Arizonans know we need more help to keep our southern border and those who live there safe.		Deploying the National Guard is one part of that mission. Next steps are building a wall &amp; increasing technology &amp; man power on the border.	https://t.co/57gpl8UPWY
The Right To Try Act gives the terminally ill hope. Patients should be given every opportunity they have to seek treatment that could help them. 		I voted for this legislation so Arizonans, like the Downs family, can spend more time with their loved ones. https://t.co/j24QLdqlhl
