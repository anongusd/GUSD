@IanN_RN @wheelguy123 Texas 7, Kansas 3 are two examples that come to mind but there are many more. Conor Lamb as well. You don‚Äôt take the House back with base Dem seats. You take it back with swing seats.
@IanN_RN @wheelguy123 This is not accurate. In swing districts, moderates won primaries. And went on to win generals.
@ShootingBlanx There‚Äôs a difference between a primary and general. Obama in 2008 won Idaho in the primary by a lot. He lost it in the general. By a lot. I suggest moving out of the echo chamber for facts.
@tyzlaw @daveweigel Good point.
@IanN_RN https://t.co/8dVBHOjyNI
@ShootingBlanx They won in very liberal districts. I wrote an article about this. That is to the good. But moderates won in swing states and districts. And that is good to. Because they could win those districts.
@daveweigel What‚Äôs the actual example of electoral success in the general in a swing state or district of the alternative?  Just Katie Porter? More?	People sadly relitigate 2016 over and over but many are discussing a hypothetical.

in a tweet that made it look like Malcolm was talking about the GND or DiFi critics, when he was not doing anything of the kind. These are not the tools of honest engagement; they are tools to use the twitter mob to attack and silence.  And we need to call out this BS. Every time
He didn't point out it was from Nov; and seemingly hundreds of people yelled at me about it in the heat of the DiFi video. Only a few saw it was from Nov. Then a few hours later, he tweeted @MalcolmNance complaining about Russian disinformation tacts (unironically)
I'm moving off the DiFi incident, but want to share the tools of disinformation that happen on here.  After the video went up, a sr advisor to Justice Dems quote tweeted one of my tweets from November about how people should also criticize the GOP on climate, not just Dems

@adamcbest In short, should we fight for what we believe in? Absolutely. But is there anything that the Tea Party did that isn‚Äôt counter to having a strong government - including breeding cynicism?  Nope.
@adamcbest I don‚Äôt know. I thought Obama was pretty inspiring; he won a landslide victory in 2008, won re-election. I‚Äôd imagine he thinks the tea party tactics are anathema to actually trying to make real, positive change in people‚Äôs lives. Tea Party gave rise to Trump. Inspiring? Nope
@adamcbest The tea party wants the government to fail.  They like a Congress that grounds to a halt. They don‚Äôt build coalitions, they tear people down.  The inverse of the tea party is not what you think.

I think deficits are an over concern of both policy makers and voters but voters actually care about it and demonstrate that concern at town halls all the time.

@johncusack It‚Äôs utterly dishonest since I said I would support the nominee in 2016. You could have done a simple search before tweeting at me to your 1.6 million followers.
@johncusack Is everything okay with you?  Just as a reminder, you tweeted at me about supporting the nominee when I have said I would repeatedly. Even in 2016. I didn‚Äôt tweet at you. And I don‚Äôt need to record conversations. But happy to chat anytime.

@RafiLetzter @EricHolthaus I‚Äôd like to go to sleep but a person who believes in man made climate change is not a denier.

@RafiLetzter @EricHolthaus Except those countries are actually adopting policies. They are still in Paris. They are taking actions. We don‚Äôt need to twist ourselves in pretzels for this. If you believe in climate change you are not a climate denier. Period.
@RafiLetzter @EricHolthaus Europe‚Äôs date is 2050 for their policy target - are they climate deniers?  Lord. You‚Äôve changed the meaning of climate denial from denying the existence of climate change to not accepting the policy change that many or even most argue for.  These are not the same thing!
@RafiLetzter No. Saying someone is climate denier who does not deny climate change is gaslighting.
@RafiLetzter @EricHolthaus I read his thread. A person who believes in climate change is not a climate denier. A person who is willing to take insufficiently bold action, in your view - especially the only person to pass a climate bill ever thru the House - is not a climate denier. Words have meaning.
@EricHolthaus You want to criticize her for sounding dismissive of something you admire, well that‚Äôs totally fair. Gaslighting is not.

@AbdulElSayed @charles_gaba @TopherSpiro @amprog With all due respect that is a complete fabrication. Everyone is in a strengthened Medicare- only people with employer sponsored coverage can keep it or choose Medicare. Our plan is universal. Please don‚Äôt make up things about our plan. It is simply nothing like a simple option.

@crulge Universal is not a buzzword. Access is a buzzword. Perhaps you could actually read the plan before making stuff up.
@crulge Maybe read the plan. You‚Äôre just making crap up. The plan is universal.
@Th3W3b5t3r 70% of people who have employer based coverage like this plans. Why end their plans?  Only 30% of public supports ending employer sponsored coverage. Grapple with those facts. Most of the world has universal coverage with mix of public and private insurance
Lord. It‚Äôs Medicare for everyone except those who want to keep their plans. If employees want Medicare they get it. If they want their current plan they keep it. If you think everyone wants Medicare they will all choose it. What are you afraid of? https://t.co/3t3DAK9H6A
I don‚Äôt know why @cenkuygur is spreading misinformation about a plan. I assume it‚Äôs because he hasn‚Äôt read it and he‚Äôs not deliberately lying. Our plan is universal. It is not a buy in. And just FYI, Medicare today has co-pays. Happy to chat health care any time Cenk https://t.co/Vlfhk3wLrw

@ChandanChintz @_waleedshahid I agree
@_waleedshahid I‚Äôm sorry but you didn‚Äôt even read our plan. Ours is not a public option. Everyone has health care in ours. Tweeting on our plan when you haven‚Äôt read it... well, I don‚Äôt know what to say about that but perhaps you want to tweet after you read it.
@CharlesPPierce @TaraAriano Nope. They are rating their plan - liking it not at all, liking it a little or liking it a lot. And many people like it a lot. I know some find that hard to believe. But it‚Äôs data
@_waleedshahid That is precisely the false choice. I believe health care is a right. Everyone in Medicare Extra has health care. Everyone. We just don‚Äôt eliminate the choice of insurance for employees that like their current health care. But if they want Medicare, they can have it.
@PatFNelson Some are good for employees. Some are bad for employees. That‚Äôs why we think it‚Äôs important for the employee to have the choice. We don‚Äôt decide for them.
@TaraAriano Then why does it have 65 to 70% support in polls of employees with employer-provided coverage?
@awjedwards @feraljokes @lukesburneracct Nope. Enrolled in the Medicare plan from birth.

@blankslate2017 @armandodkos @rosadelauro @janschakowsky I think @armandodkos is kidding.
@speakn_my_truth @rosadelauro @janschakowsky Then under our plan, your could have the enhanced Medicare option, which sounds like it would be a lot better.
@lukesburneracct we do that
@frodofied @T_FisherKing Love to you too my friend!
@electrikmonk yes, and that would end under our plan.  It's wrong to say that ends only with single payer.
CAP's Medicare Extra for All allows employees to make this choice -- to join Medicare or keep their health insurance.  And we're proud that our framework has been introduced as legislation by @rosadelauro and @janschakowsky, two fierce progressive champions.
But then honestly wrestle with the disruption that creates when so many people who have health insurance through their employers like it.  And be honest that that it's a policy choice and not the only way to get to universal health care.
In fact, many countries with single payer allow people to buy private insurance. But many countries in the world have universal health care with a mix of public and private insurance. Now, I absolutely respect those who may want to eliminate private insurance.
Indeed, CAP's Medicare Extra for All plan does exactly that: https://t.co/DmIkqrAnKH. Would have been great for the authors to mention this proposal, but c'est la vie.  But it's a false choice to say that there's only one way to universal health care and it's single payer.

@garwoodgal We don't know enough about whether it was done intentionally or there is a problem with integrity, unfortunately.
@dave_in_sa We've known for a long time Cohen lied to Congress about the Moscow Deal. The news in the Buzzfeed story was that there are emails and documentation proving Trump directed him to do so.
@mavisr @sailmom What I'm saying is I don't think the Special Counsel would have issued a statement, when he's never done so before, for inconsequential errors.

@armandodkos Ok. I‚Äôm all for the House holding hearings
@mhinojosa8 Agreed.
@armandodkos Honestly, I think you‚Äôre overly parsing. The WaPo story on all this says SCO believes whole story is off. They‚Äôve never issued any statement like this. They probably wouldn‚Äôt if it were smaller discrepancies
@MultipleMommies No. Not by me.
@gailkiddenmom They don‚Äôt generally comment at all. But when the congress started talking about impeachment they felt they had to. Also the Washington Post makes clear in their coverage that the SCO is disputing whole article. I trust the Post
@OdporPravni The story didn‚Äôt say they got the docs from SCO. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd issue a statement if that is all they were disagreeing about.
@sailmom He wouldn‚Äôt say things are inaccurate if they are accurate.
@littlejackie66 But that is not what Buzzfeed said.
@OhSheri1 Agree
@JoeySchmittPhD I agree. But I don‚Äôt know why they haven‚Äôt indicated Roger Stone.
@sailmom He wouldn‚Äôt say things are wrong if they are right, regardless of other motives.
With some distance, I think the Special Counsel wouldn‚Äôt have released a statement if the thrust of the Buzzfeed story was right. So the thrust of the story is probably wrong. We won‚Äôt know til all facts are out but Buzzfeed may have set the Russia story and investigation back.

@edkrayewski @fugpapi @leonbotzky This is all fair. I hear you.
@edkrayewski @fugpapi @leonbotzky I really think you‚Äôre underestimating her conservative, not liberal, views. She attacked Obama from the right, as she did Hirono. Her support from Duke and Spencer gives liberals pause. But again, I definitely believe in a big boisterous primary.
@edkrayewski @fugpapi @leonbotzky Perhaps what you see as dismissal is just disagreement with your assumptions. I don‚Äôt see Gabbard as anti-war, since she‚Äôs pro Russian bombing in Syria.  Indeed she calls herself a hawk in some arenas. Anyway, I just hope you keep an open mind to other Dems.

@cd_hooks @leahmcelrath Do you not think Trump is a nightmare? Does that mean that‚Äôs all a candidate has to do? Of course not.
@cd_hooks Lord, to say I‚Äôm opposed to ‚Äúwe have to do better‚Äù is kind of silly. But then, most distortions are. I hope the primary will not rip people apart. If it does, that will be unfortunate for the country.  The first step to avoiding that is looking at people‚Äôs tweets with good faith.
@cd_hooks It‚Äôs a little odd to tweet about me without tagging.  Because if you had I could have told you this is a distortion.  Obviously the only way to get any positive change is to defeat Trump but that is not enough. Candidates need a vision and ideas to change people‚Äôs lives.

If we had a parliamentary system, have at voting for any party. We do not. If you wanted to stop Trump the way to do that was to vote for his closest opponent.
