The last two years have been difficult, but today we start to turn the page. 		Today we become the change we want to see in the world.
Thank you for being there for me, for believing in me, because I believe in all of you. I promise to be there when you need a fighter in your corner. 		I will never forget where I’ve come from or who I’m fighting for, and I will stand up for Nevadans by standing up to Trump.
As a young man, I learned what it means to have someone looking out for you. This community was there for me when I needed them most, and I have, as a result, spent my life trying to give back to this community and others across Nevada.
Nevadans said that crushing student loan debt must end, that climate change is real; that creating good-paying jobs should be a priority; that the mass shooting on October 1 doesn’t have to be the new normal; and that stripping children away from their families is not who we are.
Nevadans made clear that the chaos coming from this Administration is unacceptable; that Congress must do its job and represent all of us, not just the wealthy; that health care is a right, not a privilege; and that Social Security and Medicare must be strengthened, not cut.
It belongs to the people of #NV04, who took to the polls to say that they could not be bought by special interests or bullied by a politics of fear.
This victory does not belong to me. It belongs to all of us because this campaign was for all of us. It belongs to every volunteer who put in countless hours making phone calls and knocking on doors.

FACT: The Affordable Care Act has faced ruthless attacks from Republicans in Washington and from Republican governors &amp; state attorneys general. Now, Republicans are pretty much saying they’ve never attacked our health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/8hVaM8vbty
Here’s something Trump will deliberately fail to mention tonight: he and dozens of Republican states are suing the court to ensure you no longer have protections for your pre-existing conditions. This is who they are. They don’t want to #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/DbiId6Zo8n
Republicans are lying about protecting preexisting conditions. They are fighting to give insurers the right to discriminate against preexisting conditions. They *do not* want your preexisting conditions covered. #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/Mod5dBPQQ6
For 8 years, Republicans promised to “Repeal &amp; Replace” the Affordable Care Act. With 130M American relying on its protections for preexisting conditions, Republicans are hoping you forgot that &amp; will take their word today, not their word from 2010 – Sept. 2018. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/MpBiTmEx3C
FACT: Any new law from Republicans would weaken current protections for preexisting conditions and would likely result in you paying a lot more to get a lot less than the actual care you are guaranteed right now from your insurer because of the Affordable Care Act #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/a7OHES244Y
Republicans in Washington are running scared. They see the writing on the wall. That’s why they’re simply hoping people will fall for their careless lies about health care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/aZLKlvsTjV
Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in part because many with insurance found they were not covered for specific illnesses when they got sick. The law brought fairness &amp; certainty, giving families peace of mind to know they are covered if they face illness. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/KQ24xB0gD7

.@GabbyGiffords' determination is remarkable. Hearing from her and those working to stop gun violence gives me hope.		“It’s time for courage. We must do something. We must stop gun violence,” she said.		I couldn't agree more. We can and must act.		https://t.co/DgXuXA9zgB
As we honor, remember, and heal together, I am once again moved by the power of our community. #VegasStronger https://t.co/xxwxtoU4HO
In the days and weeks after, we showed the world what #VegasStrong means. We're still healing, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. As a community, we must work to stop senseless killings from happening again.
1 year ago, we experienced the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. We honor those we lost and will never forget them. #VegasStrong

1 year later, fellow Americans in Puerto Rico need our support. This administration denied the full impact of Hurricane Maria. More than 3,000 died. Many families were displaced.

Our democracy is at stake in this election. We cannot send Trump another yes-man in Congress. We need to check the chaos coming from this administration. 		Nevadans need a representative who will put them first.		 @CresentHardy? He'll just fall in line.
What does that mean for you? 		@CresentHardy wants to raise the retirement age to 75. 		He supports stripping health care away from thousands of Nevadans.		And he approves of the Trump tax scam, which lines the pockets of billionaires and endangers Social Security and Medicare.
Last week, my opponent said Trump's policies are his policies. He said he should have kept his mouth shut instead of criticizing him.		Tonight, @CresentHardy rallies with Trump in #NV04.		He will put the wishes of Trump above what's good for Nevada families.

Thank you Deisy &amp; Dreamers for hosting DACA dinner. Listening to your heartfelt stories inspires me to continue the work and keep all of our families together.
One year ago, Trump threw thousands of Nevadans' futures into jeopardy when he moved to rescind DACA. 		In Congress, I was one of 5 original co-sponsors of comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken system, and I'll lead on this issue again. It's just too important. #NV04 https://t.co/VBpLDGzXbs

83 years ago, FDR signed Social Security into law. Hundreds of thousands of Nevada seniors rely on it to stay out of poverty.		I'm the only candidate in #NV04 who has pledged to strengthen and protect your retirement.		My opponent? He wants to raise your retirement age to 75.
Repeal of health care is a very real possibility depending on who is elected in November.		I’ll keep this really simple:		I’ll fight to protect our health care. 		@CresentHardy will work with Donald Trump and Republicans to sabotage our health care. #NV04 https://t.co/BnpaUFbNuG

My opponent voted to strip health care away from Nevadans. He advocated for raising the retirement age to 75, forcing our seniors to work even longer. He won't stand up to Trump or the GOP party bosses, but I will, and I'll protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid. #NV04
Today is the 53rd anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, and more than ONE MILLION Nevadans enrolled in these programs face threats to their coverage because Trump and the GOP Congress gave tax cuts to the wealthiest corporations and Big Pharma. That is unacceptable. #NV04 https://t.co/Ns3rtC9uYZ

RT @KTVN Lyon County School Board Votes to Go to 4-Day School Week http://bit.ly/mHhq60 // Which school district is next? #nvleg
Young: Supportive of lifting the sunsets, an .8% margin rate, transaction tax.  Govs budget puts too much of a burden on hospitals #nvleg
The Governor's budget, with its deep cuts, is not fiscally conservative. The Margin Tax is a responsible solution, proposed at .8%. #nvleg
Sylvia Young, President of Sunrise Hospital:  5% cut to Medicaid + sweep of indigent accident fund = to an 8-9% margin tax.  MORE #nvleg
Sen Schneider:  Half of the kids who were born when I was elected have dropped out of school.  That is not a success story. #nvleg
Sen Leslie: Gov budget not fiscally prudent.  Takes school reserve funds, misuses voter approved funds, hopes for unrealistic growth. #nvleg
Sen Manendo:  We are only out of time to fix and fund our education system if legislators decide to stand in the way and stall. #nvleg
Sen Kihuen: Most companies that have come before Comm. on Employment have said they locate their business based on education levels. #nvleg
Sen Breeden: K-12 funding bill didn't increase spending beyond 2009 levels.  NV schools just trying to keep their heads above water. #nvleg
Sen Lee:  Our community colleges have to devote much of their resources to remediation, that will not change if we gut K-12 funding.  #nvleg
Sen Wiener:  I visit between 3-4k students a year, question from them is always “what are you doing to protect my education?” #nvleg
Merritt: The majority of small businesses that work w/UrbanChamber fall below $1mil cutoff, they would be exempt from the margin tax. #nvleg
Jerrie Merritt, Urban Chamber:  SB491 will help startup small businesses in Nevada. #nvleg
Newsome:  Paying modified business tax right now anyway, using MBT as a bridge is not a new liability. #nvleg
Shaundell Newsome, small business owner: Margin tax gives small businesses the flexibility they need, fairly diversifies tax base.  #nvleg
Zappos CFO: We understand and are comfortable w/SB491. It makes sense, we will continue to grow, we will support it. #nvleg
Zappos CFO: Higher ed is critical to what we do. We count on our employees to be innovative. You learn to do through higher ed. #nvleg
We help the most vulnerable one year, then cut their services the next.  We need to end the boom/bust cycle. SB491 will help stop it. #nvleg
UNLV student, constituent of mine, Michael Flores:  "A lot of us are tired but we are not going to give up."  Neither will I.  #nvleg
If we dont pass reform this session the next legislature will be stuck with a $1.1B budget hole and the same 1950s tax structure. #nvleg

Privileged during lunch break to join DNC in electing Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Mother of 3, strong Democrat, great friend.
I agree,  we should reform education,  but we also need to fund it.  We can't improve our state doing one but not the other.  #nvleg
I won't support taking money from schools that are falling apart and need repairs.  Students need to be safe to learn.  #nvleg

If Nevada will not invest in education,  the private sector will not invest in Nevada.  #nvleg
Laden:  we will lose grant money, professors, research assistants.  There's a multiplier effect to losses,  brain drain accelerates.  #nvleg
Mr. Laden: consequences to not investing in our schools = UNR bonds on market were rated "junk,"  Moody's + Fitch downgrade NV bonds. #nvleg
"Some cuts don't heal" - Marian Wright Edelman,  President of the Children's Defense Fund testifying before Senate Finance. #nvleg
Judge Breen:  we save at least $2 in future spending for every $1 spent on mental health courts.  Pay a little now or pay more later. #nvleg
Judge Doherty: counties cannot handle shift of mental health care. Detention centers will fill up with kids who shouldn’t be there. #nvleg
NV never had a “robust” safety net, bottom 10% in services, says Willden. What do you call drastic cuts to an already frail system? #nvleg
Keep in mind:  the less we fund HHS, the less federal support we receive.  The #govwreck cuts are worse than they appear.  #nvleg
Drastic HHS cuts are going to cost us down the road.  Patients don’t just disappear when you close a mental health clinic.  #nvleg
There are 15m gay adults in US.  Buying pwr = $690m.  Avg income is $82,000/year.  Let’s make them feel welcome in Nevada. #nvleg

#SB368 is up for a vote:  If you have the money, you have the right to buy a house.  Discrimination is not welcome in our state. #nvleg
UNR Silver Scholar, Mill. Scholar recipient:  works three jobs, sleeps four hours a night.  She's already making huge sacrifices. #nvleg

UNR freshman studying nursing works 30 hours a week to stay in school, has Millennium Scholarship.  Can't ask her to work harder. #nvleg

@timkaine: Instead of focusing on jobs, new GOP congress is cutting children's healthcare, weakening programs for seniors and working poor
@timkaine: Instead of focusing on jobs, new GOP congress is working to strip women of rights by eliminating support for Planned Parenthood
TK: Well obama does care.  He cares that Americans get quality healthcare. Obamacare means Obama CARES.
TK: Why do they refer to it as Obamacare? To make it out to be a bad thing? To suggest that to care is a bad thing?
TK: The first thing the new republican congress did was not to focus on jobs, they focused on repealing health care.
Under George Bush, if you put a dollar into the stock market, it got you 70 cents. Under Pres. Obama, that same dollar result is $1.50
@timkaine: Despite challenges, economy is starting to grow. We are gaining jobs under the President's leadership.
@timkaine: Choice between the two parties is clear. We want to win the future by out educating and out performing the rest of the world.
