Proud to have supported a major federal criminal justice reform by voting for the FIRST STEP Act, which lowers some of the federal mandatory minimum sentences and improves reentry services following incarceration.
I supported the House-passed $5.7 billion funding-level for border security as a starting point for negotiating with the Senate and the President. My hope is that a compromise will be reached that will avoid a shutdown.
Mattis has been the adult in the room when it comes to national security policy and I find his impending departure alarming.  For the last two years he has been a buffer between the chaos of the White House and our military.

On Tuesday of next week I will be unveiling my #NetNeutrality legislation-- the '21st Century Internet Act'.... more to come.
No doubt our immigration system is in dire need of reform, but those supporting this idea are only grandstanding and don’t really want to see a permanent legislative solution reached. I will be voting “No” on such measure should it reach the House floor.
The fact that the radical left wants to abolish Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) is foolish and nothing more than political games. ICE plays an important part in our national security and anyone who says otherwise is being reckless.

Red flag laws with due process both respect the Second Amendment and help us keep weapons out of the hands of those intending to commit violent acts.
In shooting after shooting, these dangerous and evil people have made their intention for violence clear beforehand. We should take their threats seriously and remove their weapons before they can commit their heinous acts.
While the Washington, D.C. gun control crowd wants to take guns from law-abiding citizens and criminals alike, smart red flag laws would allow law enforcement to take all guns away from those who are a threat to themselves or others.
The shooting at the Waffle House this weekend has made clear the need for red flag laws in this country.
