Glad we could share Booker Wright's story. Thanks to all of you for watching #dateline On now to our next hour of @datelinenbc
#dateline As you'll see, Greenwood is a very different place than it was in Booker's time. Is that in part because of what Booker said?
Yes, Booker Wright was killed. But was it because of what he said n that documentary? #dateline
The original documentary that featured Booker Wright aired only once in '66. long before DVR's and VCR's. #dateline
The filmmaker questions whether he should have included Booker in his 1966 doc. Somehow I think Booker knew the consequences. #dateline
@bagpoor THANKS. IT MEANT A LOT TO ME TO BE ABLE TO TELL IT. Thoroughly enjoying the story of Booker Wright on #Dateline.
#dateline Everytime I watch Booker Wright's speech to the camera I wonder how many hearts and minds he changed? Was he a civil rights hero?
#dateline I love that the Booker Wright story has so many of you inspired to dig into your own roots
When you hear Booker Wright speak on #dateline , imagine what he was risking. Did he intend to become an activist?

@nnwake Thanks. Lucky with hotels so far. Bit crowded w/5 in my room. Yes to food, but fuel for cars is a BIG problem.
USGS preliminary magnitude: 5.8. It's scary we're getting used to these things.
Another aftershock. So many of them, we're all starting to estimated magnitude. Lee Cowan guessed 4.2. I'm going with 5.8.
Sendai residents  afraid rain carries radioactivity.  "Black rains" of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  are ingrained in this country's memory.
@hillarylake @AnnCurry @NBCNews Thanks Hillary
Our route to Sendai is steering us well west of the exclusion zone around the Fukushima nuclear plants.
Driving to Sendai now. Light traffic in Tokyo even during PM rush hour.	Gas stations are all closed.
Apparently these modern skyscrapers rock for several minutes even after the shaking stops.  It's a good thing. So they say.
Rode out a 6.2 aftershock on 27th floor dtwn Tokyo. Building swayed for a full 3 minutes. No damage visible.
Odd moment on board flight to Tokyo. Turned on in-seat video system and graphic tsunami scene from movie "Hereafter" was playing.	Ugh.
Arrived in Tokyo tonight. Aftershock warning announcements being made in the terminal.
Hearing heavy calibar gunfire near our location in direction of square.
Driving into central Cairo now. Encountering agitated Mubarak supporters. Things getting more tense.
