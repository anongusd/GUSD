Today, 75 years later, the story of Tony and the 10 Americans is being remembered. The @royalairforce alongside the @usairforce completed a fly past to honour their sacrifice and Tony‚Äôs dedication. #RememberTheTen https://t.co/ffzuEB9zAl
In 1969 a plaque was built for the 10 Americans that gave their lives for the young Britons. For decades Tony has visited it. He lays his hand on the memorial as he talks about small things. His plans for the day, the weather. He never stopped trying to keep their memories alive.
Pilot Kriegshauser made a choice. Instead of risking the lives of Tony &amp; the other children, he steered the plane into the trees just beyond the park as the last engine failed. The plane crashed. There were no survivors. But Tony would never forget that moment as long as he lived
There were 10 Americans aboard the B-17 Flying Fortress ‚ÄúMi Amigo‚Äù. Sputtering, the plane was returning from a harrowing WWII mission over Berlin when an engine failed. 23 year old Pilot Kriegshauser steered the B-17 to a park to crash land. It was then that he saw the children.
In Sheffield 1944, 8 year old Tony Foulds &amp; his friends were playing outside when they heard a loud roar. Tony looked up to see a plane so low he could see the pilot waving at him. Tony waved back. It was only later he would realise the pilot was trying to get him out of the way. https://t.co/k1ZNtrqEx0

Prime Minister May is committed to stand up for the freedom of people of all religions to practice their beliefs in peace and safety.
Denial of the right to FoRB is a growing problem internationally, either through the actions of states, or through their inaction in the face of social persecution and discrimination by non-state actors.
Societies that aim to protect and promote freedom of religion or belief are more stable, prosperous and more resilient against violent extremism.

More information about The Duchess's Coat of Arms: https://t.co/nTrAhSozrI
Her Royal Highness worked closely with the College of Arms throughout the design process to create a Coat of Arms that was both personal and  representative.
The three quills represent communication and the power of words. Beneath the shield on the grass sits a collection of golden poppies, California's state flower, and wintersweet, which grows at Kensington Palace.
The blue background of the shield represents the Pacific Ocean off the  California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield are symbolic of the sunshine of The Duchess's home state.

Read more from PM May on how the UK will make the gender pay gap a thing of the past: https://t.co/lhBFb6RisN
Nearly 9 out of 10 who are out of work in the UK because of caring duties are women. To provide training, help update skills and enable people to return to work with confidence, the UK gov has made $7million available for returner schemes.
The UK contributed 100+ hours of negotiation to agree conclusions @UN_CSW on empowerment of rural women and girls. First time in over a decade that consensus was achieved. #CSW62
Last month, the UK gov announced a $2.1 million fund to help tackle the gender pay gap.
Action is already being taken: 3 years ago today, the UK introduced shared parental leave.
The gender pay gap in the UK is at a historic low but progress in shrinking it remains far too slow. PM May: "equality for women is a right, and our whole society is the poorer as long as it remains unrealised."
As of yesterday UK businesses with 250+ employees must disclose pay data to calculate the #GenderPayGap. This transparency is just one step to ensuring gender equality in the UK. https://t.co/n0mC9uMvvZ
