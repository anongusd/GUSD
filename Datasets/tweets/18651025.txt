In many cases - including some this year - those same candidates failed to even raise the $$ to really compete. Donors are sneaky like that ‚Äî they can smell bs. And the same old tired formula has failed to generate excitement from our small dollar activists.
I‚Äôm tired of this narrative. Dems in the South have tried that formula - apppeal to AA voters &amp; liberals in private/primary but in public/general abandon those principles &amp; become a milquetoast generic candidate indistinguishable from GOP &amp; we‚Äôve lost nearly every time.
*but also set records in turn out &amp; $$ w/ progressive candidates.	And we saw the standard formula - Dem turned GOP lite who won‚Äôt address issues that poll under 80% lose with larger margins.

@HeathMayo @conorhurley @BarackObama I stand by my statement. Your party is brushing it off as the actions of a teenager.	All the men in my life have been 17. Not one has been accused of attempted rape. It‚Äôs  not common &amp; it‚Äôs not something to brush aside. Unless you‚Äôre in the GOP &amp; a woman‚Äôs life is expendable
@HeathMayo @conorhurley @BarackObama Being 17 doesn‚Äôt excuse attempted rape.
Go look at your leadership and your president. You don‚Äôt respect women.  You don‚Äôt view us as equal. You‚Äôre willing to sacrifice women to advance your agenda. I‚Äôd respect you more if you at least admitted it rather than covering yourself in generic tweets and platitudes. https://t.co/4RhrUtgrc6

@HeathMayo @conorhurley @BarackObama Also men like you are the reason so many victims choose to remain silent rather than come forward.
@HeathMayo @conorhurley @BarackObama If we are talking about Propriety then it all goes back to the fact he is accused of trying to rape someone and you‚Äôre excusing that as commonplace 17 year old behavior. Maybe be sure of the definition of a word before throwing it around.

21 states currently have ‚Äúpre-viability‚Äù bans in place.  41 states have zero constitutional or statutory protections in place of Roe falls. Overall nearly half the country is at the greatest risk of outright ban should this landmark case be overturned. #ScotusPick
10 states still have their pre-Roe laws making abortion illegal on the books - and it‚Äôs not just the usual suspects. Think places like Massachusetts and Michigan. #ScotusPick
If Roe falls 4 states have in place what we call ‚Äútrigger laws‚Äù. Meaning these states have passed an abortion ban that springs into effect the instant or soon after Roe is overturned &amp; would not require any legal action to go into effect. #ScotusPick		https://t.co/ganDilZfCF
