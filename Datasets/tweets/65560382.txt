@trcfwtt Which is completely baffling to me after the modern populist President Obama. You’d think Dems would be better. All I can surmise is that perpetrating propaganda for nefarious reasons is more motivating rather than countering or promoting a positive agenda.
@trcfwtt It all seems so junior level at first glance. But as I think you’re eluding to, it could also be for some high level sophisticated shit. I’ll be curious to see what others say.
@trcfwtt It’s all so odd. Sometimes I wish I did have the type of cypher mind that could come up with this stuff.

@wandaloskot I give neither a pass on poor judgment. And in that regard, I actually give Omarosa a slight edge on judgment because ew, Trump.
@wandaloskot Both know him in some fashion. Both have stories to tell about it.
@wandaloskot I’ve read neither. One worked for him, the other slept with him. One could say they also both have the same poor judgment. I agree though, about the promise of those tapes. I just find it curious that liberals automatically take Stormy at her word but dismiss Omarosa as a clown.
@wandaloskot I think both are about equal in credibility. That opinion either elevates both or dismisses both. But I see nothing different about their demeanor or intelligence.
And before anyone asks, of course I will vote for her in any putative general election match up. Just not my first choice.

@FernieCommaAlex Most importantly, and germane to this. Local EAS can be notified by the FEDs if there is a national emergency and they are credible and trustworthy, aside from a glitch here and there.
@FernieCommaAlex Local alerts makes sense. They’re meant to warn you of impending danger. I would argue that this should not be labeled as a Presidential Alert. That in itself, makes it political. FEMA and this POTUS are not trustworthy in this capacity. Another consequence of Trump. Saaaad.
@CPaRhon @rodeodance @yashar Yikes! I had a similar experience with a doctor when I was 14. There was never a nurse in the room to stop him and he made my mother leave the room. Yes, Republicans can go to hell.
@FernieCommaAlex Well FEMA is just as bad right now too. They’re all bad.
@FernieCommaAlex I would also argue that we can still protect ourselves from the radio and TV should we choose. But this is intrusive because you can’t block it.
@FernieCommaAlex It’s sinister because it’s him. Plain and simple.
@FernieCommaAlex We have reliable EAS sources for this. Do you like the idea of someone who lies consistently about everything under the sun to be able to judge what an emergency is, let alone communicate it? It IS sinister.

Imagine the outrage is Obama decided to do that. Congress would block the ability immediately.
