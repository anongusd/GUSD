@realDonaldTrump 2) What would you do differently than President @realDonaldTrump on North Korea?  Be specific.		I appreciate President Trump doing something different, as all other past efforts have failed miserably.

@realDonaldTrump I am encouraged that there are plans to continue talking. 		We must not go back to the status quo. 		If negotiations fail, it would be time to end the nuclear threat from North Korea – one way or the other.
@realDonaldTrump There is only one good deal: the complete denuclearization of North Korea in return for security guarantees and economic assistance.
I appreciate the effort by President @realDonaldTrump to reach a peaceful conclusion to the North Korean nuclear threat.  	 	It’s better to walk away than sign a bad deal.

@VP @realDonaldTrump The only thing being manufactured is Democrats arguing there is no crisis at the border.  		Why?  		They don’t want to recognize Trump as the legitimate president. 		Democrats’ refusal to acknowledge the problems and crisis at our southern border is pure political hypocrisy.
@VP In fact, Democrats agreed and were willing to spend billions to fix it.  		That was their position, grounded in fact; at least until @realDonaldTrump became President.
@VP For years I have worked across the aisle and with any willing participant to reform immigration.  		During this time, I never heard any Democrat – in either the Senate or House of Representatives – say there was NOT a crisis at our southern border.
@VP In 2014, President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis at our southern border because 120,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended.  		As of today, we have already apprehended 120,000 in Fiscal Year 2019.  		The problems of 2014 are only getting worse.

My questions and full letter to the FBI Director about the tactics used in the arrest of Roger Stone. https://t.co/y1s67DF3Yu
Although I am sure these tactics would be standard procedure for the arrest of a violent offender, I have questions regarding their necessity in this case.
.....I am leery that a subject of the Special Counsel’s investigation, who had retained counsel, had publicly stated that he believed that he would at some point be indicted, and was apparently willing to surrender voluntarily, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid at his home.
However, while I firmly support law enforcement taking into account threats to officer safety, flight risk, and the need to ensure evidence is preserved.....
Since his appointment, I have supported Special Counsel Mueller’s ability to conduct his investigation without interference.  		Moreover, I have always been a strong admirer and supporter of the FBI.
5) Did anyone at the FBI, DOJ, or the Special Counsel's office alert CNN, any other media outlet, or anyone outside of law enforcement that the arrest was going to occur on the morning of January 25, 2019?
4) Did the Special Counsel's office issue a press release and release the indictment to the press prior to informing Mr. Stone’s attorneys of the arrest?
3) Were usual procedures for obtaining and executing arrest and search warrants followed with regard to Mr. Stone?
2) Was the manner of Mr. Stone's arrest consistent with the arrests of, and procedures for the arrests of, similarly charged individuals?
Today I wrote to the FBI about the arrest of Roger Stone.  		My questions include:		1) Why was it necessary to arrest Mr. Stone at his home in the early morning hours, rather than working through his attorneys to permit him to surrender voluntarily?
To do otherwise would be to encourage more illegal immigration. 	 	President @realDonaldTrump has been more than reasonable.  		The ball is now in the Democrats’ court.
I suggest my Democratic colleagues make a good faith effort to solve this problem before it is too late. 		* TPS program is going to be canceled unless reformed. 		* DACA population won’t get legal status unless we address some of the causes of a broken immigration system.
Last time I checked, the President of the United States is a stakeholder in the legislative process.  		To suggest he ‘stay out’ is a sure way for failure.  		https://t.co/15NWirpNHf
@realDonaldTrump I’m hopeful we can reach a deal between President Trump and Congress, which would be the best way forward.
@realDonaldTrump Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump have all sent troops to help secure the border in the past.  		What’s the difference between troops securing the border and troops constructing barriers to secure the border?
@realDonaldTrump Question: Can states ask federal government to help secure a broken border that is allowing harm to be done to their states?
If White House and Congress fail to reach a deal then President @realDonaldTrump must act through emergency powers to build wall/barrier.
Hope Congress - in a bipartisan fashion - will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.  		Last best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system. 		Thank you Mr. President.  		Let’s make this a win-win for America!
I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues to work with the White House on a 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding consistent with DHS priorities.
The way forward is clear: 		* 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding and Democratic priorities for disaster relief showing good faith from both sides.
@AOC Question: Is it possible Rep. Ocasio-Cortez could be wrong about the demise of the planet in 12 years and the American people reject her socialist agenda in 2020?  		Stay tuned!

Mr. President, you’re right to continue the fight for border security - including a Wall/barrier that Democrats have supported in the past. 		No Wall, No Deal. 		Use emergency powers as last resort.
Couldn’t agree with President @realDonaldTrump more. Damage from a broken border -- 90% of all heroin coming across the southern border, thousands of convicted criminals -- far exceeds the problems associated with a partial government shutdown that can and should be fixed. https://t.co/5c4xY68Zuk

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President,		Declare a national emergency NOW. 	 	Build a wall NOW.
@realDonaldTrump They hate President Trump more than they want to fix problems — even problems THEY acknowledged to be real and serious in the past!	 	Democrats will do everything in their power to stop Trump in 2020.
Just met with President @realDonaldTrump and his team.	 	It’s clear to both of us that Democrats don’t want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.
Mr. President, the Democrats are not working in good faith with you. 		Declare emergency, build the wall now.
Speaker Pelosi’s refusal to negotiate on Wall/Barrier funding – even if the government were to be reopened – virtually ends congressional path to fund Wall/Barrier.		Time for President @realDonaldTrump to use emergency powers to build Wall/Barrier.  		I hope it works.
@realDonaldTrump However, I currently do not see a path in Congress – given the recent statements of @SpeakerPelosi and the inability to use regular order in the Senate -- to fund a wall. 		Complete stalemate right now in Congress.
President @realdonaldtrump strongly believes he has power to declare a national emergency to build a wall.   		Will that approach work?  		I don’t know.
Hey Jim @Acosta,		You’re making Trump’s case better than he can!		#BorderSecurity https://t.co/rIHsInK4oU
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump President Trump cannot and will not capitulate on his promise to secure the border.  That includes walls and physical barriers where appropriate.	 	Shutdown continues, no end in sight.
Very disappointed to hear that @SpeakerPelosi refuses to work with President @realDonaldTrump on border funding -- even if the government were to reopen.	 	As long as this attitude exists, there is no pathway forward.
@senjudiciary In addition, I will also continue to seek common ground on the major issue facings our nation.  		I look forward to working with Senator Feinstein and all my colleagues to make this new Congress successful.
I’m honored to be selected as Chairman of @senjudiciary. 		I will do my best to continue down the path charted by Senator Grassley of having a fair and vibrant committee process.  		The confirmation of conservative judges will be one of my top priorities as Chairman.

Good decision by President @realDonaldTrump to address the nation about the crisis at our southern border.	 	Great opportunity to explain to the American people why we need more border security funding. 		The current situation at the border is indeed a national security crisis.
It is imperative we gather intelligence about their activities under Law of War detention.  No Miranda Rights at this time.	 	Any criminal trial must be done in civilian court, but only after intelligence gathering has been completed.

New conflicts between regional powers take pressure off ISIS.

To Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats:		No Wall Money, No Deal.
When it comes to radical Islam, a border wall is our last line of defense — not our first. 		Our first line of defense is a forward deployed presence working with partners to disrupt enemy operations directed at our allies and homeland.
I hope President Trump will not do in Syria what Obama did in Iraq -- which led to the rise of ISIS. 		We also must not abandon our Kurdish allies who have fought so hard by our side in Syria.
We must remember these troops are in Iraq to retake ground from ISIS after Obama’s ill-conceived withdrawal. 		The worst thing for morale would be to give back to the enemy territory that was previously taken through blood and sacrifice.
I’m very glad to see the President and First Lady visit our troops in Iraq. 		It’s always good for morale to have a visit from the Commander in Chief.		https://t.co/oZgs3DnSpy

As to the status of our Kurdish allies, the Administration has yet to tell the American people what happens to the Kurds - who fought so hard for us - when we leave. 		Is there a plan to protect our allies post withdrawal? 		Need answers now.
Just heard White House spokesperson claim ISIS is defeated in Syria. 		According to all available information, thousands of ISIS fighters still remain and are lethal in Syria.
Especially we must NOW hear from the Pentagon about the likelihood of the rise of ISIS and the fate of our Kurdish allies in Syria.
It is imperative Congress hold hearings on withdrawal decision in Syria -- and potentially Afghanistan -- to understand implications to our national security.
Congratulations to House Republicans for increasing wall funding - very much needed. 		Do Democrats hate President Trump so much they can’t see the need for more funding for border security? Do they hate President Trump so much they’re unwilling to compromise?		Time will tell.
I completely support the House Republicans decision to add more wall funding to the spending bill. 		If the House passes a spending bill with more wall funding, I believe we can find win-win deal in Senate.
The conditions in Afghanistan – at the present moment – make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy.  		If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11.
Like in Syria, troop withdrawal should be based on conditions on the ground.
Our Afghan partners are incapable of subduing the threat posed by ISIS-K alone. 		In addition, our intelligence capability and military might cannot be replaced by any other regional ally when it comes to subduing ISIS-K in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
I have just returned from Afghanistan and can say – without hesitation – ISIS-K remains a direct threat to our homeland and they would dramatically benefit from a reduced American troop presence. https://t.co/P3jgqF4MfY
@realDonaldTrump General Mattis is a combination of intellect and integrity.  		He has been in the fight against radical Islam for decades and provided sound and ethical military advice to President Trump. 		He is a role model for the concept of Duty, Honor, Country.
It is with great sadness that I was informed of the resignation of General Mattis.  		He is one of the great military leaders in American history.  		He should be proud of the service he has rendered to President @realDonaldTrump and our nation.
I ask that you listen to your national security team who are immensely talented.  		Take this opportunity to reassess our policy and how to withdraw with honor from Syria achieving real and lasting security.
Finally, I choose to fight against ISIS and other radical Islamists in their backyard – not ours.  		I choose to fight this war with partners – not alone.
You are right to want others to fight more and pay more.  		The Kurds have fought fiercely against ISIS and have been valuable allies.  		They deserve better.
The idea of outsourcing our national security and the fight against ISIS to Russia, Iran, and Assad/Syria is doomed to fail.  		It will result in an Open Borders policy for ISIS in Syria and elsewhere.
However, I cannot and will not empower a decision that I believe – no matter how well-intentioned – is equivalent to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
I believe you are on course to make the same mistake President Obama made in Iraq.  		It will turn out no better for you than it did for him. 		There is a lot of bipartisan support for a conditions-based withdrawal and I will stand with you to achieve that goal.
I urge you to follow sound military advice when it comes to withdrawing from Syria and the fight against ISIS.		Withdrawing from Syria is a shared goal but the ‘When and How’ – matter.

It remains the pathway forward and Americans are watching how we handle this current test.		#10
Showing the American people we will take a tough line on future waves of illegal immigration helps build the necessary political support to deal fairly with the problems created in the past.		#9
They can also offer their strong support for additional efforts to secure our border today and in the future.		#8
I have worked with many Democrats who have compassion for illegal immigrants already in the United States.  		In order to solve this problem, now is the time for Democrats to be clear that they too oppose the lawless behavior from illegal immigrants at the border.  		#7
It’s simple: We as Americans – have the right to decide who gets to come into our country, not immigrants seeking to force their way in.		#6
Americans want an immigration policy which we control, not one where illegal immigrants control us.		We are a nation of immigrants.  We are also a kind and generous people.  But Americans will not be played for fools.		#5
Everyone who supports dealing fairly with illegal immigrants already in the United States should make it clear the lawless behavior occurring at the southern border crossing will not be tolerated.		#4
The current chaos at our southern border must be dealt with properly or we will never find a solution to our broken immigration system. 		#3
We will not have the necessary ‘buy-in’ from the American people for a solution dealing with illegal immigrants already in the United States if we cannot convince the public we have the ability to stop future waves of illegal immigration.	#2
As someone who has worked for over a decade to fix our nation’s broken immigration system, some thoughts on the caravans and the current situation on our southern border. 		#1
I recommend she take a tour of the Holocaust Museum in DC.  		Might help her better understand the differences between the Holocaust and the caravan in Tijuana. https://t.co/05vCexiClE
@realDonaldTrump I support President Trump’s decision to close the border until we can get a handle on the chaos created by the broken laws governing asylum.    		We must have money for border security/wall and must change asylum laws.
You have to really hate President @realDonaldTrump to not understand the problems created by the caravans. 		He is right to push back in order to deter future waves of illegal immigration.
Completely agree.		We should take up criminal justice reform in December.  		Let’s vote! https://t.co/mVmDuykpF5

I fully realize we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage.  		However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.
While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the Crown Prince – in multiple ways – has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic.
I firmly believe there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms.
Likewise, it is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal #Khashoggi.
Time and time again President Obama chose to look the other way as Iran took increasingly provocative actions.  		Each time it led to even worse Iranian behavior and created even larger problems for the future.
One thing I learned during the Obama years is that when you look the other way regarding problems in the Middle East, it seldom works out.
I look forward to working with senator-elect @ScottforFlorida who will be a reliable conservative, reform voice and a great addition to the United States Senate.

President @realDonaldTrump is right to suggest the best way to protect France and Europe is for the French and other European nations to meet their NATO contribution obligations.
I would like to remind President Macron that throughout his beautiful country there are thousands of graves filled with American soldiers who gave their lives to help liberate France - not conquer France. The same is true for many other European countries.

@realDonaldTrump As to me, I will be part of a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate -- working with the President and my Republican and Democratic colleagues -- to make America safer and more prosperous. (3/3)
I look forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice and deal with both the opportunities and challenges our nation faces. (2/3)
Jeff Sessions served our nation well and honorably as Attorney General.  		He has dedicated his whole life to conservatism and upholding the Rule of Law. (1/3)
@realDonaldTrump The mainstream press are not -- in my opinion – ‘Enemies of the People’ but rather ‘Allies of the Democratic Party’ playing an activist role in support of their agenda.
Certain members of the press cannot stand the fact that President @realDonaldTrump and Republicans defied expectations in the midterm elections – actually growing our Senate majority.
It’s apparent to me the White House press corps lives in a bubble and the way they are conducting themselves today will do NOTHING to improve their standing with the American people.
Finally, the lone Democrat who voted for Brett Kavanaugh – West Virginia’s Joe Manchin – won reelection by three points.  		I’m confident that if he had voted NO, he would have lost his race too.		#KavanaughsRevenge
Liberal Democratic Senators and activists efforts to destroy Brett Kavanaugh ended up destroying Red State Democrats.  		Hopefully this resounding rejection of the smear campaign by voters will make it less likely that this will occur again in the future.		#KavanaughsRevenge
Virtually all Senate Democrats running in Trump states -- who voted against Brett Kavanaugh -- were defeated.  		Their constituents held them responsible for being part of a despicable smear campaign orchestrated by the left.		#KavanaughsRevenge

@realDonaldTrump We must send a clear message that we will stand for our values.  And those who follow the path set by Saudi Arabia will pay a heavy price. 		It is also important is to send a signal to our enemies that America is strong once again.

It’s hard to find this latest “explanation” as credible.
First we were told Mr. Khashoggi supposedly left the consulate and there was blanket denial of any Saudi involvement.  Now, a fight breaks out and he’s killed in the consulate, all without knowledge of Crown Prince.

@realDonaldTrump 4. New waves of illegal immigrant caravans are a distinct and different problem than dealing with illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for years.
@realDonaldTrump 3.  I also want to help Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador stabilize their countries, but we cannot tolerate having their governments be indifferent to our immigration problems.
@realDonaldTrump 2. He’s also right to hold Mexico accountable because they have the ability to reduce the flow and stop these caravans if they chose to do so.

Just spoke to Senators @BobCorker and @BenCardinforMD about our shared concerns regarding the whereabouts and treatment of Mr.  #JamalKashoggi.
Honest answers must be forthcoming for the sake of the Saudi-US relationship.
I very much share the concerns many have expressed about the fate of Saudi Arabian journalist #JamalKhashoggi.		It is imperative that we find out what happened to Mr. Khashoggi and the Saudi government give a clear answer as to their conduct and information on his whereabouts.

Judge Kavanaugh and his family are class acts.  		They remain very appreciative of all who helped and prayed for them during these trying times.
I just spoke with Judge Kavanaugh congratulating him on Senate confirmation to serve as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.  		I told Judge Kavanaugh I was very happy he was recognized for the good man he is, but sad that the process was so despicable.
…..finally thank you President @realDonaldTrump for the good judgment in selecting Judge Kavanaugh and the toughness and determination to stick by his side and see it through to Victory!
Thank you Susan Collins (awesome), Senator Flake (consistent), Senator Grassley (fair and steady), Senator McConnell (smart and strategic) and …….

@SenatorCollins @SenatorCollins, in my view, also understood that the allegations have to be viewed through a logical, constitutionally-sound process, and that = unfairly destroying Judge Kavanaugh’s life under these circumstances would not advance any just cause.
@SenatorCollins Finally, Senator Collins eloquently expressed the plight of abused women, sexual assault victims and the hell they go through.
@SenatorCollins The country needed what @SenatorCollins provided today – reason, facts, and an understanding of who we are as a nation. 		She rejected winning at all costs and the politics of personal destruction.
@SenatorCollins Senator Collins’ speech was one of the most consequential speeches in the history of the United States and did a lot to protect the independence of the judiciary.  		It should be required viewing in every civics class in America.
@SenatorCollins If we had legitimized the coordinated efforts at character assassination, it would have destroyed the Judiciary over time and eroded constitutional principles that protect every American.
@SenatorCollins Unlike most Kavanaugh critics, she actually took the time to do her job. 		She read his opinions, she had in-depth interviews, she listened to the accusers, and she applied a process of the rule of law versus the rule of the mob. 		She rose to the occasion.
@SenatorCollins floor speech in a word – wow. 		It will go down in history as one of the most thoughtful, reasoned explanations of support of a Supreme Court nominee.

@SenatorCollins Her intention to vote YES rejects destruction of the Rule of Law, the politics of personal destruction, &amp; reaffirms that when it comes to making hard decisions, @SenatorCollins will do what she thinks is best.		She has always been – and always will be – a fire-breathing moderate.
@SenatorCollins Senator Collins took great pains to ensure Dr. Ford was heard and FBI checked the Judiciary Committee’s work product on the central allegations. She listened to both sides and based her decision on facts, not threats.
@SenatorCollins gave an eloquent explanation regarding her decision to support Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.  	 	Simply put, @SenatorCollins has shown great courage under fire. She has rejected mob rule and embraced the Rule of Law.

@realDonaldTrump Clearly when it comes to President Trump, elections – in the eyes of Democrats – have no consequences.		In my view, the process needs to move forward with a hearing Thursday, and vote in committee soon thereafter.
@realDonaldTrump What we are witnessing is the total collapse of the traditional confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee.  		It is being replaced by a game of delay, deception, and wholesale character assassination.
When it comes to stopping Pres @realDonaldTrump and his agenda there seem to be no boundaries.		Whether it’s coaching witnesses or reporting thinly-sourced stories without proper verification, everything is fair game and falls into the category of – ‘The Ends Justify the Means.'

@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump The Obama years were dominated by higher taxes, slower growth, big government, a broken military, and a pathetically weak foreign policy.  		The voters found in Hillary Clinton more of the same.  		They wanted a better way.
The more President @BarackObama speaks about the ‘good ole years’ of his presidency, the more likely President @realDonaldTrump is to get re-elected. 		In fact, the best explanation of President Trump’s victory are the “results” of the Obama Presidency!

Jon Kyl is a worthy replacement. 		Over his many years of public service, he has established himself as a solid conservative who will do his best to solve hard problems and he will always have the back of the men and women in uniform – much like his dear friend, John McCain.

America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions.		….And I’ve lost one of my dearest friends and mentor.
Above all else, I know John wants his family, friends and staff to understand how much he appreciates their love, care, and kindness.
In addition, John’s deeply loyal staff and devoted friends are pouring their hearts out and doing everything they can to make this burden bearable.  John’s medical care providers represent the best of their profession.
The entire McCain clan is doing exactly what the McCains have done through generations — rise to the meet the challenge.
Cindy remains steadfast and is traveling every step of the way on this difficult journey with John.  The love provided by Meghan and the McCain children to their father has been comforting to witness.
I just want to acknowledge the continuing and abiding love, care, and dedication that Cindy McCain and the family are providing @SenJohnMcCain .

Strong GDP numbers indicate a vibrant economy. We need to reach agreement with Canada, Mexico and EU on trade.	 	Better trade deals with Canada, Mexico and EU will strongly benefit our economy and allow all of us to focus on Cheating China.
Wishing happy birthday to Bob and Elizabeth Dole, who are both celebrating this month. 		The Doles are two terrific friends and two great Americans.
The allegations against Pastor Brunson have always been bogus in my view. But we’re going to focus on the positive and continue praying for his safe return to the US. 	 	Stay tuned, I hope better news will be coming soon.
I’m pleased Pastor Brunson has been moved out of prison to house arrest, but the goal is to get him out of Turkey and back to the US in a way that moves the US-Turkey relationship forward. I very much want a better relationship with Turkey – they are a NATO member. https://t.co/c0fFTqM2Xb
@realDonaldTrump @JunckerEU Agreeing not to impose additional tariffs during negotiations is very smart and the best way to achieve a win-win solution.	 	Now is the time for EU and US – both victims to unfair China trade practices – to unite against China.	 	Well done, Mr. President.	2/2

This should be a whole of government approach and bipartisan. All of us should have an interest in protecting our electoral system, which is one of the crown jewels of our democracy.
I also talked with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford who said that the Department of Defense can help states in securing their election systems.
I had a very good conversation today with DNI Coats who informed me that he has numerous proposals that could help secure our 2018 elections. And I told him the sooner these could be implemented, the better.
All relevant agencies should provide us their suggestions and recommendations about how to harden our 2018 election systems against foreign interference, and Congress should act quickly as time is running out regarding the 2018 elections.
The warnings from the intelligence community could not be more clear. Republicans and Democrats working with the President need to act quickly.
....continuing to attack our critical infrastructure in the 2018 elections.		I’m very pleased to hear this and I stand ready to work with the Administration to harden our electoral system against all foreign interference, including Russia.
I have just been reassured unequivocally by the White House legislative team that the President’s ‘no’ response today to shouted questions was not intended to suggest that President Trump doubts the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia is continuing to attack....
A BIG discrepancy between President Trump’s statement and DNI Coates’ warning.  	 	It’s imperative we get to the bottom of what is going on so we can be prepared to protect ourselves in advance of the 2018 elections.	 	My personal view: the Russians are at again.

Looking forward to working with the Trump Administration, in a bipartisan way, to do everything possible to secure the 2018 elections from foreign interference.
President Trump was right today when he said we need to better secure our election system and we can only have ‘Peace through Strength.’
Meddling &amp; collusion are NOT the same thing.  		Russia did meddle in 2016 election &amp; are trying it again. I’ve seen no evidence of collusion, plenty evidence of Russian meddling.	 	Russia didn’t beat Clinton. Trump beat Clinton. 	 	Bad day for the US. Can be fixed. Must be fixed.
Finally, if it were me, I’d check the soccer ball for listening devices and never allow it in the White House.
It is imperative that Congress hold hearings on the extent and scope of any cooperation with Russia in Syria regarding Iran’s presence.
Missed opportunity by President Trump to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling and deliver a strong warning regarding future elections.  		This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves. (1/3)
It is beyond absurd to believe that Russia will ‘police Iran’ or drive them out of Syria.  Iran is Assad’s biggest ally – even more so than Russia. 	 	Russia policing Iran makes about as much sense as trusting Russia to police the removal/destruction of chemical weapons in Syria.

Radical Sunni groups will say – correctly – that Assad is a proxy of Iran and the Ayatollah.  It means the Syrian war never ends and ISIS comes back.
ISIS and other radical Sunni groups PRAY that Assad stays in power in Syria.  That allows them to recruit members to their cause in perpetuity.
Just to be clear:		Without Iran/Hezbollah, Syria’s Assad would not be in power and would not have the ability to slaughter almost a half-million Syrians.		Without Assad’s blessing, the flags of Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard would not be on Israel’s front door. https://t.co/vLVZnTOp0b
Hope someone will get solid answers from Mr. Strzok on the following questions:		▶️ Was Mr. Mueller’s decision to remove you from the Russia investigation justified?		▶️ Was it based on what appears to be an obvious bias on your part?
Another reason why the Senate should have oversight hearings soon.
The FBI position that Mr. Strzok cannot discuss the role he played in the initial Russian investigation destroys congressional oversight. 	 	You cannot shield an executive agency from oversight when in this case it is obvious that the agency in question was incompetent &amp; biased.
Democrats want Mueller to investigate Trump, but seem to have no interest in investigating abuses at the @TheJusticeDept and FBI during 2016 election.  		That will not stand.
I will encourage Senator @ChuckGrassley to have an oversight hearing in Senate Judiciary Committee concerning the behavior of Strzok/Page and entire FISA warrant process.
If Democrats and the FBI believe the bias displayed by Strzok and Page will not be subject to congressional oversight, they are kidding themselves.  		That’s delusional.
US withdrawal from Syria = major disaster for Kurdish allies, U.S. interests and regional stability.
To our friends in Israel – be very careful making agreements with Russia re Syria that affect U.S. interests.	 	I don’t trust Russia to police Iran or anyone else in Syria. U.S. must maintain presence in Syria to ensure ISIS doesn’t come back and to counter Russia/Iran influence.

@SenatorTimScott @henrymcmaster Charleston Harbor deepening has been a team effort.  		I think we all understand this is a long term investment which will benefit South Carolina and American business in perpetuity.
@SenatorTimScott @henrymcmaster I also very much appreciate the support of South Carolina State Senator Hugh Leatherman and the entire South Carolina State Legislature.
I also want to thank the congressional delegation – particularly my friend and colleague @SenatorTimScott -- for their unified efforts in support of the Port and Governor @henrymcmaster’s strong and effective voice.

The nearly $50 million in the Army Corps’ work plan allows construction to go forward without delay and keeps the project on track.  		The sooner we get this project done, the better.  		It remains a top priority for me and will continue to be so until it is complete.
This is great news for the Port of Charleston and the state of South Carolina.  		Charleston Harbor deepening is about jobs – both today and in the future.  With this news we are one step closer to having the most dynamic port in the United States.
I’m very appreciative of the Trump Administration’s decision to dedicate nearly $50 million to deepen Charleston Harbor.

My statement on today’s meeting at the White House with President @realDonaldTrump on trade. https://t.co/XMKfk44VRf
I strongly believe there is a plan in place to lead us to better trade deals.  		We should give the president the time and ability to achieve his goals.
Now is not the time to undercut President Trump’s ability to negotiate better trade deals.  		I will not support any efforts that weaken his position.
It was great meeting with President Trump on his trade agenda.  I’m confident he is on track to get us better trade deals throughout the world including in our own backyard. I believe in free trade but it must also be fair.
Great to join President @realDonaldTrump today at the White House for the signing into law of John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act – also known as the VA MISSION Act.
To all those who participated and who no longer are with us, may God keep you in his care. And to those who remain, may God continue to bless your life.		On behalf of all South Carolinians, well done.

@realDonaldTrump The President will continue to challenge our European allies to get a better deal.  		He is fully committed to re-imposing sanctions – as hard as he can for as long as necessary – to stop Iran’s march through the Middle East.
@realDonaldTrump As for Iran, he expressed a strong desire and resolve to sanction the Iranian regime for its efforts to dismember the Middle East.  		He stated one of the biggest threats the world faces is a nuclear-armed Iran.
@realDonaldTrump He’s fully committed to denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, and hopes to make it a win-win for North Korea and the world at large.  		However, he is also strongly committed to protecting United States interests and the American homeland from a nuclear-armed North Korea.
President @realDonaldTrump is a true believer in ‘Peace through Strength’.  		President Trump today gave an excellent overview of our North Korea and Iran policy, and how he plans to forcefully deal with both threats.

Gina Haspel should be confirmed as soon as possible as we live in a time of continuing threats.

She also has the support of six former CIA Directors serving under both Republican and Democratic administrations.
The selection of Ms. Haspel will be good for morale within the CIA and give the country a seasoned intelligence expert at a time of great need.

@realDonaldTrump Of equal importance, today’s action also sends a strong signal to the North Koreans.  		The Trump Administration is serious about denuclearization and will not support weak deals with loopholes.
@realDonaldTrump I hope President Trump will work with our allies around the world to find a better deal which will truly end Iran’s nuclear weapons ambition and hold them accountable for being the largest state-sponsor of terrorism.
@realDonaldTrump Instead, Iran has used the funds provided by sanctions relief to significantly enhance their military capability and create havoc throughout the Middle East.  		They also have used the funds to increase the threats posed to our ally in Israel.
@realDonaldTrump They sincerely believed that by providing Iran with sanctions relief, the Iranians would change course and become a better member of the family of nations.  		Those assumptions have proven to be a disastrous mistake.
@realDonaldTrump This would have required our Arab allies to develop a nuclear weapon of their own to counter the growing Iranian threat.  	 	There are some who blindly supported this deal, regardless of the risks it posed to our own national security.
@realDonaldTrump The agreement has always been fatally flawed when it came to controlling Iranian nuclear ambitions. 		With the mere passage of time, the deal allows Iran to enrich and reprocess uranium – without limitation – on its march toward a nuclear weapon.
I strongly support President @realDonaldTrump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.  		He made a strong and convincing case for this position.

I had the pleasure of meeting her numerous times through the years and can say without hesitation she is one of the most good-hearted people I’ve ever met.  		Faith is sustaining her at this very moment.
Like all Americans I’m sending my prayers to former First Lady Barbara Bush and the entire Bush family.

We should apply ‘3️⃣ Strikes, You’re Out’ out to the Butcher of Damascus.   		He’s a monster. He should be considered a war criminal and legitimate military target.
Assad:		1️⃣ Was warned by President Obama not to use chemical weapons.		2️⃣ Warned by President Trump not to use chemical weapons.		3️⃣ Continued to use chemical weapons against innocent children anyway.
It is imperative that when an American president speaks and warns ruthless dictators not to use chemical weapons against innocent children, those statements actually mean something. 		#Syria

America stands up to bullies. 		We do not cower before them.
It’s time for America to stand strong and reject the Obama Doctrine of weakness.
Both Assad and Putin are weak.  And when it comes to Assad’s outrageous behavior – enough is enough.
The worst possible outcome? 		Assad paying a small price – or none at all. Giving him yet another pass – because bully Putin threatens the Trump Administration with an escalation.
When it comes to America’s response in Syria it is imperative Assad pay a big price for the barbaric chemical attack.

These rewards for terrorist attacks are inconsistent with American values. 		They are inconsistent with decency, and they are certainly inconsistent with peace.		#TaylorForceAct
Taylor was an American hero who was brutally murdered at the hands of terrorists.  		Yet instead of condemning this horrific attack – and so many others like it – the Palestinian Authority pays monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.

We must take a strong stand to make clear this type of behavior from Putin’s Russia – nerve gas attacks, cyberattacks, meddling in elections and more – will not be tolerated today, tomorrow or ever.
I support the sanctions announced today by the Treasury Department, but believe even more must be done.
Putin’s Russia is striking at the very heart of the freedoms, democratic values and liberty all Americans hold dear.  		His aim is to disrupt every aspect of our lives – right down to having the ability to shut off the power in Americans’ homes or businesses.
I fear many Americans only view the threat posed by Putin’s Russia through the lens of the 2016 election.  		Putin’s actions and intentions against United States citizens – and our allies – go far beyond one election.
Whether it was the brazen nerve gas attack in England, cyberattacks on the American electrical grid, meddling in US elections, aggression against Ukraine, or continued actions in Syria in support of Assad, Putin is committed to harming the security &amp; well-being of the US.
I have long argued Vladimir Putin is not – and has never been – America’s friend. https://t.co/6VFWYC7H0h

As Dir of the CIA, Mike has made contacts throughout the world &amp; has come up with aggressive policies to defend our homeland.  		No one understands the threat posed by North Korea &amp; Iran better than he does. He has made alliances that will benefit the United States &amp; our allies.

The bill we introduce today is a starting point.  		It’s the place where we begin a long-overdue discussion about firearms and mental health.
It is imperative that we begin discussions about how to provide family members and law enforcement an effective legal tool to help prevent individuals in crisis from harming themselves or others.
The Emergency Risk Protection Order is designed to fill a gap in current law.  		It can be utilized when an individual has moved into crisis, but has not yet committed a crime.
I have spoken with @VP Mike Pence about a similar provision in Indiana law, and the legislation we bring forward today is modeled on that state’s approach.
Senator Blumenthal and I disagree on many issues regarding the Second Amendment, but we strongly agree restricting access to firearms by those who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others is a strong step forward.
With the introduction of this bill today, our goal is to begin a national conversation on how we can prevent individuals who are in crisis from accessing deadly weapons.

President Trump has done a good job against ISIL but there is no coherent strategy when it comes to pushing back the drivers of the Syrian war -- Iran and Russia.	 	The time to deal with the increasing Iranian menace in Syria is running out, particularly for Israel.
After my recent trip to the Middle East, I’m gravely concerned about the Syrian civil war becoming an even bigger nightmare for the region, particularly our ally Israel.
When it comes to the Syrian civil war -- when the UN speaks, no one listens.	 	Since the unanimous passage of the UN Security Council resolution calling for a 30 day case-fire in Syria, Iranian and Assad forces have bombed east Ghouta and are now moving in on the ground.

@IsraeliPM @IDFSpokesperson It’s past time we push back against Iranian aggression throughout the region, particularly the threats against our friends in Israel.	 	I can’t say it any better than PM @netanyahu does – the Iran nuclear deal either needs to be Fixed or Nixed.
@IsraeliPM We also had a terrific briefing by 	 @IDFSpokesperson regarding threats from Syria and Iran.  		The main takeaway is we need to be more supportive of the King of Jordan and our ally Israel because they are surrounded by radical elements.
Great meeting today in Israel with @IsraeliPM.  He gave a thorough and insightful view of the security situation facing both Israel and the United States. https://t.co/Co6gQxlHbc

The only way forward is for President Trump to grab the reins and lead us to a solution.
I do not believe victory will be achieved by further politicization of this issue.  That’s the oldest game in the Swamp – blame the other side.  		There’s already enough intensity around immigration.
Looking ahead, I continue to believe there is a deal to be had on immigration that gives President Trump many of his priorities on the border and relief for the DACA-eligible population.
This two-pillar approach is the best way to deal with phase one of immigration reform. 		Receiving fifty-four votes for this construct was encouraging. 		We are not there yet, but we will keep working to build our numbers.
I’m very proud of the bipartisan effort (Rounds-King) that would have given President Trump his border wall system money and created a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients.
I’m disappointed with today’s outcome in the Senate.  		I supported all four proposals, including the legislation backed by President Trump.  		Unfortunately, they all failed to reach the sixty votes necessary to move forward.
It looks like demagogues on the left and the right win again on immigration.
An overwhelming majority of Americans are sympathetic to the DREAMERS cause but do not view it as an entitlement.
Everyone is saying, ‘Don’t do comprehensive immigration reform’ except when it comes to the issues they want addressed.  		This attitude of ‘I must get everything in Round One’ has doomed the effort to failure.
I’m astonished that one of the leading #Dreamer advocacy groups is opposing legislation that offers the widest path forward since CIR for eligible Dreamers.		https://t.co/dXJGVXZHul

To call her and the Kim regime anything less than a tyrannical family and killer does the world community at large – and the people of North Korea suffering under their rule – a great disservice.
It’s important to remember that her lifestyle – comes at the expense of the North Korean people.  		North Koreans are systematically starved, tortured, and raped by the thugs of the Kim regime – which she is a leading member of – to maintain power.
Kim Jong Un has to be tremendously pleased with the coverage his sister -- Kim Yo Jong -- received from the international media.  		Frankly, the coverage has been over-the-top.

The appointment of a Special Counsel -- independent of politics – is the best way to get a result which holds people accountable and inspires confidence in the Rule of Law.
What I have seen – through my work on the Judiciary Committee and in a classified setting -- is disturbing and needs to be investigated.
I have repeatedly called for a Special Counsel to be appointed to look at individuals conduct at the Department of Justice and FBI regarding the Clinton email investigation and certain aspects of the Russia investigation.
As his friend, I will miss the regular interaction in Washington, D.C. and back home in South Carolina.  However, I’m sure this decision is welcome news for his family. I know Trey will continue to contribute in many different ways for years to come.”
His accomplishments are too numerous to list, but I believe his biggest legacy is how he balanced passion and kindness. I can say without hesitation Trey Gowdy is a true role model for public servants.
Seldom has a Member of Congress made such a difference in so many ways -- in a relatively short period of time -- as Trey Gowdy. He is one of the most articulate advocates for the conservative cause and does so with humility and joy.
Trey Gowdy's decision not to seek reelection is a body blow to the House of Representatives, the conservative cause, and the people of South Carolina.

However, passing laws that restrict the ability of current and future generations to fully examine the past will not erase history.

Heart breaks for the senseless tragedy in Kentucky. May God comfort and keep.
Nothing means more to me than making sure we take care of our military’s needs as they fight a war we can’t afford to lose.  Today, we took a giant step forward in that direction.
Winning is ensuring we have the funding needed for our military to meet the tremendous challenges they face.
Ending the government shutdown stops the losing for the country.  But it’s not winning.  Winning is solving the nation’s problems.
I’m convinced that to continue the government shutdown — after this proposal — does more harm than good to our effort to find common ground.
I'm hopeful my Democrat colleagues will find a way to reopen the government so we can find a solution on immigration, defense spending, and many other important issues.
I'm very pleased to hear Majority Leader McConnell commit to the Senate that if we do not make a breakthrough on immigration by February 8th, the Senate will take the issue up under regular order. 		This is a more than reasonable proposal by the Majority Leader.
President Trump has expressed a desire to have border security with compassion on immigration. #winningcombination.		General Kelly is tough but reasonable.  		Some other staff in the White House hold extreme and unrealistic views.  		They hold us back from getting a solution.
It's time to stop the madness.  Vote for a CR through February 8. It will allow us to reach a deal on all outstanding issues including immigration.		It's time to get back to work.

In light of these realities, I’m hopeful there will be overwhelming bipartisan support for the February 8 proposal
Military necessity —combined with the reality that DACA recipient lives will soon be turned upside down — provides the incentive for Congress to get it right once and for all.
General Mattis’s statement yesterday that defense cuts and continuing resolutions have done more damage to the American military than any enemy on the battlefield was very sobering.
After my discussions with numerous senators on both sides of the last night it is clear to me a commitment to move to immigration after February 8th is the key to ending the government shutdown and finding resolution on all the outstanding issues.
This will guarantee the Border Security/DACA issue will be brought forward with an open amendment process for resolution no later than February 8th. I’m confident we can find a solution to Border Security/DACA once we start the process.
After extensive discussions with senators, I believe such a proposal would pass if there was a commitment that after February 8th the Senate would move to an immigration debate with an open amendment process if no alternative agreement was reached with the White House and House.
I also agree with Senator McConnell we are close to a resolution on all these issues.
Leader McConnell mentioned last night he was willing to make a proposal for a CR through February 8 and seek resolution on immigration, disaster relief, military and government funding, CHIP, and other health care related issues.  I would support such a proposal.

Unlike some of my Republican colleagues I am glad @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and the Senate Minority Leader are talking. 		I have confidence President Trump can and will lead us to a successful conclusion on multiple issues important to the American people.
Glad to see @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and Sen. Schumer sitting down and talking. This is welcome news to American people, military, DACA recipients. 		Let’s see if two New Yorkers can agree on a deal good for USA. 		I believe – in America – anything is still possible.
@DeptofDefense The U.S. military has to work to accomplish their objectives.  		They don’t get to point fingers or pass the buck.  Congress could learn a lot from them and learn to get the job done regardless who gets the credit, or in this case, the blame.
@DeptofDefense We are inside the 10 yard line on a lot of major issues – military spending, government spending, CHIP, stabilizing insurance markets, disaster relief, and Phase I immigration reform.
@DeptofDefense It’s time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up, and act consistent with the values of a great nation.  		The White House should engage and lead us to a solution.
@DeptofDefense We could easily pass a continuing resolution – which lasts days (certainly more than the four proposed by the Senate Minority Leader) and less than the 30 days passed by the House of Representatives – to close the deal on outstanding issues which remain.
Continuing resolutions are devastating to our military. 		As @DeptofDefense Gen Mattis said this morning - no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combination of defense spending cuts and continuing resolutions.		He’s exactly right.
Simply put, there’s no reason to shut the government down and no reason to continue this chaos for the next 30 days.
Our military, which desperately needs additional funding as they are already scraping by, doesn’t win.  		American people who expect the government to be functioning and operating don’t win.		Cynicism about the ability of Congress &amp; Pres to solve problems increases even further.
Everyone is convinced they’ll win – but in reality, nobody wins in a government shutdown.  		The ‘blame game’ makes for great Washington theater, but doesn’t serve the needs of the nation.

My focus is not on pleasing a bunch of partisans. My focus is on delivering for soldiers in the field and fixing problems which face our nation – like the impending upheaval to the lives of 800,000 DACA recipients. People in SC and across the nation deserve nothing less.
We need additional funding for our military – which is desperately in need of an infusion. 		We also need some direction about the path forward for 800,000 DACA recipients who know no home other than the United States.
Americans in uniform are serving overseas in conditions – jungles, deserts, mountains, and more – that we cannot begin to imagine in Washington. All the while Congress acts like children urging all to rally around partisan flags and not the American flag which they serve.
To those who supported sequestration – you have done a lot of damage to our men and women in uniform.  You should want to fix it and I’ll work with anyone and everyone to get a result which benefits our troops.
When it comes to helping the military I will do whatever it takes to get them the help they desperately need.  Sequestration has been madness. I intend to do what is necessary to fix sequestration.
I am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days.  It’s time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up, and act consistent with the values of a great nation.		https://t.co/bu3G0ih74F

Speaking with @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews at 7:15 pm about the latest on immigration reform.
It is also clear there were conflicts of interest which were ignored during the Trump/Russia investigation by #DOJ and the use of the dossier produced by a political operative calls for congressional oversight.
What Democrats call a distraction – looking at #DOJ and FBI handling of Clinton email and Russia investigation – I call oversight.  		It is clear to me the top FBI agent handling the Clinton email investigation had extreme political bias.
The best way to start this process is to declassify how the dossier was used by the #DOJ and the DOJ’s interactions with Mr. Steele.  		We can do this and still protect sources and methods.
I want to find out – and believe the American people deserve – the entire story regarding #FusionGPS, the Dossier, and #DOJ – not just one portion of it.
I’ve been clear that we need a Special Counsel to investigate the Trump campaign and Russia.  		It’s equally clear we need to investigate how #DOJ conducted themselves regarding the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump campaign investigation.
It’s not enough to simply release the transcript from the co-founder of #FusionGPS Glenn Simpson.  		I want the entire story regarding Fusion GPS, the Dossier, and the Department of Justice to be revealed.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump With continued presidential leadership by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump -- and willingness by Rs and Ds to work together -- we can get this done.		#DREAMers

Banning Russia makes sense. But if there was ever another country that acted outside the spirit of the Olympic games – it is North Korea.  		I don’t mind talks with North Korea but I do have serious concerns about legitimizing the most barbaric leader on the planet.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump The American people overwhelmingly want better border security, a more modern immigration system, and to allow the #Dreamers a new and better life.  All we have to do is listen to the American people and enact their wishes.  		I hope and pray we can get that done.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump President @realDonaldTrump has the right attitude.  		Now it is up to all of us in Congress to  come up with a proposal that gets the job done.
Most fascinating meeting I’ve been involved with in twenty plus years in politics.  		I very much appreciate @POTUS @realDonaldTrump attitude, demeanor, and desire to get something done that will make our nation more secure – while being fair to the #Dreamers.
My biggest concern is this will undercut what has been a very firm and clear message from the world community to North Korea.

It’s a big-time bad idea to send a message to North Korea that there will be no repercussions for behavior which is among the most despicable in the history of the world.
What does Kim Jong Un earn for his record of barbarism and tyranny?		An invitation to the party and a chance for an Olympic gold medal.
* executes his uncle with an anti-aircraft gun; and		&amp; explodes atomic bombs, test fires ICBMs, and pledges the destruction of the United States.
Kim – who rules North Korea with an iron fist:		* runs the largest collection of concentration camps since the Nazis;		* practices the systemic rape, torture, and starvation of North Koreans;		* poisons his brother with deadly nerve gas in an international airport; 		[continued]
As to an invitation to the Olympics, I find it odd the Olympic committee has banned Russia but seems eager to get North Korea to participate.  		If there was ever another country that acted outside the spirit of the Olympic games – it is North Korea.
I encourage talks and dialogue with North Korea about their nuclear program and provocative behavior.  		I would expect these to be firm and direct because nothing else works when it comes to dictators like Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/afsOfL2mAz

@senorrinhatch He is a true friend and gentleman. He has worked tirelessly for the people of Utah and the U.S., and is the definition of a public servant.  		I look forward to working with him the rest of the year and wish him all the best in the coming years.
@senorrinhatch @senorrinhatch , as Finance Chairman, shepherded the largest tax reform package in over 30 years through the Senate. This – among many other achievements – will have a long-lasting, positive effect on the American people.
While I respect his decision, I’m sad to hear that @senorrinhatch will not be seeking reelection in 2018. He has been one of the strongest voices for conservatism of his generation and will go down in history as one of the most effective people to ever serve in the U.S. Senate.
Allowing Kim Jong Un’s North Korea to participate in #WinterOlympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet.  		I’m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.
As to President Trump and all those who love freedom, we should speak loudly in support of the Iranian people and punish their oppressors to the fullest extent possible.
Ruling by fear and intimidation ultimately fails because people at some point have nothing to lose because their lives are so miserable. Whether or not this is an accurate description of the current protests - only time will tell.

It will be a difficult task but failure is not an option.
I look forward to working with President Trump, our House and Senate Republican leadership, and the private sector to make Repeal and Replace of Obamacare a reality in 2018.
I know that Republicans and the large group of middle of the road Americans are counting on the GOP to replace Obamacare with something that works better for them and their families.
We will need House and Senate leaders on the Republican side as committed to repealing Obamacare as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid were to passing it.
To be successful we will need presidential leadership with the same passion to replace Obamacare as President Obama demonstrated in passing Obamacare.
I’m fully committed to Repealing and Replacing Obamacare in 2018 by block-granting the money back to the states and away from Washington bureaucrats who are completely unaccountable to the patients of America.
Obamacare is still the law of the land and will continue to crumble which will drive up insurance costs for hard-working Americans and eventually pave the path to single-payer health care.
By eliminating the individual mandate in the tax bill we have pulled one of the pillars of Obamacare out.  But by no means has Obamacare been repealed or replaced.
To those who believe – including Senate Republican leadership – that in 2018 there will not be another effort to Repeal and Replace Obamacare -- well you are sadly mistaken.  		https://t.co/peDYlJx1vo

RT @jenhab: NEWS: Sens. Graham, Cassidy and other cosponsors met today to discuss how to bring their Obamacare repeal bill back in 2018.
The days of micromanaging the war against radical Islam and terrorism are over. 	 	Good News for our troops and allies. 	 	Bad News for our enemies.
When it comes to the War on Terror I’m pleased to hear President Trump talking about ‘Winning.’  He’s also empowering our military with the flexibility and resources they need to win.
When it comes to the potential interrogation policies regarding terrorists, it is as if President Obama and his team never left.  		How many more attacks will it take before the Trump Administration embraces the fact that we are fighting a war, not a crime?
We couldn’t possibly have gathered information on the multiple trips Ullah made to Bangladesh &amp; other relevant activity in such a short period of time. Now that he has a lawyer there will be no more intelligence gathering &amp; everything will have to be done through plea bargaining.
Giving Akayed Ullah a lawyer and putting him directly into the criminal justice system means we lose the ability to gather intelligence from a person who fits the profile of an enemy combatant.
I am incredibly disappointed to see the Trump Administration continue to treat terrorists as common criminals.
Social Security has never been a welfare program and I don’t want it to become one.  		Using general revenue dollars to pay someone’s Social Security contribution is bad policy.
While I support child tax credits I do not support the idea of using general revenue to pay for an individual’s Social Security contribution.
North Korea is the ultimate outlier in world order. It is a country built around the philosophy of the divinity of a family. And the person who’s inherited the mantle is, on a good day, unstable.		 https://t.co/cZGbYeIXix

@realDonaldTrump To me, this would be a ‘Winning’ deal –- one which benefits Americans workers, creates new jobs here at home, focuses on energy independence, makes our nation competitive in the international marketplace and all Americans more prosperous in the years to come.
@realDonaldTrump In my view, a better deal would include modernizing existing trading regimes and negotiating an energy component to NAFTA so North American energy can better compete with Russia, China, and the Middle East.
@realDonaldTrump I totally agree with President Trump that we need to update NAFTA to make it a better deal for American workers.

Mr. Saipov is now lawyered up &amp; we lost our ability to gather military intelligence abt terror ties, plots, radicalization efforts, &amp; more.
Mr. President you had power to declare Saipov and captured ‘Solders of the Caliphate’ enemy combatants without ANY changes to current law
Hard to catch ‘Soldiers of the Caliphate’ alive.  		You must take advantage of the military intelligence opportunities they provide.
Trumps DOJ calls him a common criminal just like Obama DOJ.  		Saipov should have been held as an enemy combatant.
Unfortunately, Trump Administration continues the same practice as Obama treating ‘Soldiers of the Caliphate’ like common criminals.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS ....Mr. Saipov as a suspected enemy combatant to allow us to gather the best and most reliable intelligence regarding his activities.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Based on the current evidence, it would be very appropriate to initially hold Mr. Saipov as a suspected enemy combatant....

It’s coming down to a choice between Federalism vs Socialism. 		I chose Federalism of #GrahamCassidy.
Health care decisions will be made by state officials -- accountable to their voters – not nameless, faceless bureaucrats in Washington.
#GrahamCassidy repeals and replaces Obamacare by moving money and power out of Washington closer to patients.
Wow!	 	Obamacare is a disaster for SC. Must repeal and replace with Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson 		For good of SC &amp; USA – we’ll press on. https://t.co/cSvf2odfHb
I’m excited about solutions we have found in Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson.  We press on.
Taking money/power out of Washington &amp; returning it to states to administer HC is the best way to replace a collapsing Obamacare system.
I feel an obligation to fix this disaster and intend to push forward for state-centric health care vs Washington-knows-best health care.
Obamacare is collapsing in Arizona, South Carolina and across the nation -	 driving up premiums and reducing choices.
I know Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson is the best chance to repeal and replace Obamacare.
I respectfully disagree with @SenJohnMcCain position not to proceed forward on Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson.

It is up to the Trump Administration and the world to make North Korea believe otherwise.
North Korea believes there is no downside to pushing the envelope regarding their missile and nuclear programs.
It is time to more forcefully back up our diplomatic efforts with the threat of a credible military option.
Clearly North Korea does not give a damn about UN sanctions or tough talk.

President @realdonaldTrump is right to keep all options -- including the military option -- on the table to deal with this serious threat.
@realDonaldTrump I hope diplomacy can solve the North Korean problem....but right now it's failing miserably.
@realDonaldTrump With each passing day Kim Jong Un gets closer to having the  capacity to hit the US with an ICBM and a nuclear weapon.
@realDonaldTrump It is NOT in our national security interests to allow Kim Jong Un to continue developing missiles and more powerful nuclear weapons.
@realDonaldTrump Kim Jong Un is a dangerous, ruthless man, who has the blood of thousands on his hands.
@realDonaldTrump I choose to focus on what Kim Jong Un CAN DO.......not what he may or may not do.
@realDonaldTrump Many analysts speculate as to whether Kim Jong Un would use nuclear weapons against the United States.
President @realDonaldTrump has rightfully rejected the policy of containment.
I support President @realDonaldTrump statements he will not allow North Korea to develop a missile which can hit the American homeland.
It's clear to me the sanctions on North Korea are not working.....and what influence China has is not being successfully used.
