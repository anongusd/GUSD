Once last thing - gotta run - email or contact me - anytime - for advice. Now go out there and kick some PR - you know what. #prsaphl
While looking for a job - think of yourself as your first "client." Create a PR campaign to promote yourself. It's kinda fun! #prsaphl
We're constantly trying to help college grads break into the biz. We all need a break now and then. Pay it forward.  PLEASE!! #prsaphl
Another tip - if a family member has a good contact for you - CALL THEM! don't be so proud. A contact is a contact. #prsaphl
Follow up is definitely important. Keep in touch even if it's just to see how things are going with their family, etc. #prsaphl
As a reporter once said to me - "you're such a pain the ass - but you're so nice about it!" That's how you need to be. #prsaphl
#prsaphl asking for "advice" is so much less threatening that asking for a "job." it works - almost - every time.
Try this - find a person in the field that you always wanted to meet and ask if they would be willing to give you some "advice" - #prsaphl
Definitely. #prsaphl
Every PR gig I every got was through networking. I think it's important to try and meet 2 new people every day. #prsaphl
thought I would jump in and say hi. Twitter has been really great for our pr agency. #prsaphl
