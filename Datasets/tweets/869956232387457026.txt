@jonathanchait @JohnJHarwood Bring it on. We have precedent. All they have is a president.

@NormOrnstein It's only an absolute power with respect to co equal branches. Executive can't bind itself to prevent successor exercising its authority.

@AndyMcCanse @OverUnderClover @washingtonpost @just_security 1974 OLC opinion that pres can't pardon self, allows VP in 25th amend to take power, pardon pres , then transfer power back to pardoned pres
@AndyMcCanse @OverUnderClover @washingtonpost @just_security That's the problem. It's entirely untested. Clearly another branch can't intrude on the executive.  A successor is just that. Same powers.
@KatyTurNBC @alivitali @Scaramucci Yeah cause he's looking for a reason to get indicted.
@OverUnderClover @AndyMcCanse @washingtonpost @just_security It's certainly an undecided question. The pardon power is a constitutional authority residing in the office of president.

@matthewamiller And Ruddy is going to get deposed and skewered in this deal too. Anyone who has talked to trump and to his confidantes is skrewed.
@20committee Putin, Alex Jones....wtf? Talk about empowering americas enemies.
@tribelaw Congratulations. You have long been the true public face and leader on behalf of the school in my life. Thank you. Enormous service!!
@JohnBerman Maybe newt needs to show the pope his Tiffany bill along with his charitable tax reports. His meal ticket is in play. This is last gasp
@chrislhayes Be honest with yourself. You know that he is going to in fact pardon everyone involved. Everyone. Every single one. With a smirk. And finger
@jpodhoretz Newt is batshit and should be ignored. By all of us.
@jacklgoldsmith @benjaminwittes He's a crappy lawyer for this circumstance.
@matthewjdowd Melania has enabled all of this bullshit. She is fair game.
@mckaycoppins Trump is trapped. Make no mistake. We are closing in on him and his presidency will be strangled. It's a thing of pure political beauty
@CillizzaCNN Sucking up to the accused rapist.
@NormEisen @AlanDersh Norm, read his hateful diatribes in Israeli media. I respected him too. Then it turned out he gave Alex Jones and like knuckledraggers cover
@ananavarro @TIME It's already on my wall. I built the wall in his dishonor. At least one of us built a wall.
@CNN Trump blames engine loss on democrats using it as an excuse for the election loss.
@GlennKesslerWP @KenDilanianNBC Also said he had a large penis. Turns out he meant he was just a huge dick shooting blanks
@tribelaw @AlanDersh Please. Let the president hire Dersh so that we can officially ignore him. Talk about a succubus
@SHSanders45 Most intelligent thing to come out of your phone in forever.
@sam_kriss Isn't that guy a trump nominee?  Probably knows too many words
@maggieNYT Sekulow?  A public defender wasn't available?
@FoxNews Trump:  I hope you would be interested in remaining unpublished for 12 million
@Deanofcomedy U r shit out of luck when newt is your flotation device.
@20committee How many people who haven't voted in years and years were identified by Russian hack?  Want to bet it turns out a lot of them "voted". Mmmm
@BenAdamsO_O @nycsouthpaw Details.  Good call. Should be obvious to this shill.
@MarkHalperin Funeral for a friend.
@benjaminwittes Lewinsky wouldn't hire a shitbird like trump did. This turdburger is going to make all of this fun to watch. Ooooh, gonna file a complaint..
@foxnewspolitics Ding dong the king is dead.  Naked and vulnerable. Grandkids should change last name now.
@Deanofcomedy Trump carries decades of tawdry baggage. He's done done done. Vivisection will look like a better outcome to trump than what is coming.
@20committee Sort of fitting president of Romania at WH when the story turned. Romania handled their leadership transition deftly. Smartly. Face the wall
@20committee Repping a us president used to be a great gig. Now, not so much. Kasowitz is all the garbage one could hope for. Peas in a pod.
@rezaaslan Yes. Idiots led by idiots who employ idiots to treat the rest of us like idiots so that they can remain relevant to no one but those idiots
@KeithOlbermann U.K.?  Cmon, Russia is his place. Guaranteed no protests. Maybe instead visit Africa and catch Ebola.
@djrothkopf Not possible. Scumbags all
@kenvogel @POTUS @TrumpBedminster Makes divorce attractive just to get rid of the picture with this scumbag
@BillKristol Would you trust the advice of someone with such little self esteem so as to actually affiliate with trump let alone represent him. Shitbird
@Deanofcomedy Newt is roadkill.
@NicolleDWallace Sekulow. God's shitbird. Just like daddy.
@plaidtattoo @JessicaHuseman @TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump Kasowitz, it's like pee wee Herman and Madoff had a kid.
@suziferg0806 @JessicaHuseman @TheRickWilson Would you put it on a resume?  Porn actors have better 2nd career prospects than this crew will ever have.
@JessicaHuseman @TheRickWilson Surrender hopefully.
@dabeard @brianstelter @TimOBrien Hello?? He's a criminal. Not news
@BillKristol I think trump is the snake.
@TheRickWilson Way too late. He has neither soul or conscience to lose, but the trap has sprung all around him. Like a giant boa constrictor. Say Squeeze!!
RT @MaxBoot: A former FBI agent offers an illuminating analogy about Trump and Russian hacking. https://t.co/smTVeo4dlJ https://t.co/bDVDF7‚Ä¶
@TheRickWilson Screw that. Have a stroke. Contribute something to a better america
@davidaxelrod I picture him furiously masturbating when he tweets. Doesn't everyone. Makes all of this easier to laugh at.
@NormEisen It's like the stupid leading the idiots. A chinese fire drill. #trumpidiots
@MaxBoot Can you say libel suit?  Filed in England?  Don't think they give a shit about a sitting president getting sued. Life is beautiful
@KeithOlbermann Cowardly.....keeping your boxers on in the shower while the inmates line up behind you. Batter up!!!!!  He ain't no pitcher!!
@JohnJHarwood Jr. now just part of the conspiracy to intimidate  witnesses. Expect a jail cell smaller than his proposed new hotel room. No hair gel. Bumr
@NormEisen Trump, Kushner, sekulow...... can't any of these losers get jobs outside their family business. Come back once you have shown merit.
@newsom_roger @foxnewspolitics @realDonaldTrump Trumps not a real American. More of a rat with a smelly infection. Loser for sure.
@heidinichols3 @foxnewspolitics @realDonaldTrump He's playing with himself while teasing you. Cheap foreplay.
@foxnewspolitics @realDonaldTrump They aren't. The crime is pretty obvious. Stop sucking this felon's tiny Johnson. Makes you look desperate and foolish.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine This pos knows about lying cheats. She too was married to one. Where was lying Donald when she needed him. Losers.
@axios The son is a lying douche like his flabby fuktard father
@DavidCornDC Of course not. He's been compromised. This silence and inaction IS the collusion. Stop promoting the notion he isn't. Force him to prove it
@chrislhayes Impeachment by cop. Political version of suicide by Cop.
@jimsciutto Still waiting on Arab blood money.
@DavidCornDC It's a lot worse than that. And that's hardly news in the first instance. Accused rapist, fraud, perjurer.... Ivana warned us long ago
@Evan_McMullin Imagine what kind of shit he has pulled on others that remains untold or yet discovered.
@adamnagourney Thinking he doesn't think in the first place.
@peterbakernyt @SangerNYT They r still here. Why would they leave? Interesting trump doesn't believe in it at all. That enforced ignorance alone is collusive behavior
@peterbakernyt @ShawnBoburg What are the odds that kasowitz is the Russian liaison?  Something worse?
@peterbakernyt @ShawnBoburg You mean Paul manaforts client deripaska. Oh the web. Kasowitz will be gristle soon enough.
@mitchellreports Trump should use that excuse.
RT @DavidCornDC: When? Where? Who are the others? https://t.co/zO28FJFP4r
@FoxNews @Scaramucci @POTUS Long term like 15-30 in Leavenworth.  They can give him a short inmate number so easier to remember. Cock holsters for sure.
@matthewjdowd Don't worry.  When this is all done we will be standing on top of him laughing our asses off.  This is the loser last picked for kickball
@McFaul President is stuck in a perjury trap.  This is the fun part where he gets filleted in public for all posterity.  Let's drag it out.
@tribelaw Trump is so fukd
@markknoller Meanwhile no more appointments to fill the government while the world burns. Awesome. Did he mean winning at golf?  How bout 1 apt per hole
@markknoller He practiced getting handcuffed on the plane. Chased everyone out of office.
@benjaminwittes @tcwittes @jon_rauch Comeys sworn testimony as a matter of law is unrebutted. Unchallenged. Until factual sworn testimony, comeys version is unchallenged fact
@CillizzaCNN Witness is sworn and testifies will there be any legal rebuttable of the statement. However long it takes.
@CillizzaCNN Trump is firmly snared in perjury trap. As a matter of law, the sworn testimony of comey is unrebutted. Unchallenged. Not until a fact
@DavidCornDC Trump is now Alger hiss revisited. Perjury trap has sprung
@tribelaw @NormEisen @NoahBookbinder President fully in perjury trap.
@Amb_AlThani @KoriSchake @awhawth Then do something about hamas. And do something meaningful.
@davidmackau @joanwalsh Prednisone was taken
@juliehdavis Shocking that shitbird ambulance chaser got facts wrong.
@jdickerson Bullshitters both. Don't be duped
@TheRickWilson Let's hope he starts with Barron. Little downsy looking and probably gamey, but let him choke on it.
@PhilipRucker Kasowitz inviting slander claim from comey.
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Better yet, new hairdo!
@Acosta Oops, pants on fire. Let him burn.
@EliStokols Kasowitz is a dull tool with a shitbird for client. Loser just needs to testify under oath. Let Americans decide. Cowards in suits in WH.
@matthewjdowd He just testified.
@KenDilanianNBC I think he forgot some meds or had an extra coffee. Expecting covfefe any second.
@AndyKroll @joanwalsh Good luck with that trope.
@CillizzaCNN He's on the phone w Russia seeking asylum. Arguing about bottom bunk at Snowden's place
@BillKristol He's grown tired of Melania and sought a tall brunette
@costareports @AshleyRParker President bent over in huddle. Prep for first night in prison. Someone hold his head. It's coming!!
@jonkarl Cool. Challenge him to sworn testimony. Then we can just move to lock him up. Firmly.
@McFaul How awesome to be able to watch this president come apart at the seams while enjoying a nice beverage in his private room. Screw him
@BretStephensNYT So should trump
@thehill Where is she staying?  We have an extra couch.
@PhilipRucker @edatpost @karoun He's already denied the charge.  Just more opportunity to abuse trump.  Keep fingers crossed!!!
@chrislhayes Just stop being so persnickety. It's not like he knew what he was doing.  Used to just take a stack of chips and comped room could do trick
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump For $2.00 in extra postage you know it's true. @realDonaldTrump going to need something better than Cousin Vinny.
@TimothyNoah1 @JohnJHarwood Clear cut easy peasy plain old vanilla obstruction. Not anywhere close to a tough call.  Folks get prosecuted for way far less daily everywr
@VanJones68 Sort of unabomberesque with better hair.
@JeffreyToobin @paulkrugman Impeach and replace.
@NormEisen @marckasowitz @chrislhayes Reminds me of lewinskys lawyer.  Sad. Should read the final days so he isn't surprised by what is coming.  Clown school opened today. 4 ring

@USATODAY Said Cousin Vinny
@ezraklein They don't. We are
@chrislhayes But apparently not too dumb to remain president. Doesn't know to look both ways at an intersection, not familiar with bribing, ran a casino
@ASimendinger And the drinking begins.
@michaelcrowley Absolutely. Give him an extra blanket and pillow.
@jimsciutto He's a liar. Liars lie. Prisons are full of people who say they didn't do it. No evidence he knows or cares about the diff by true and false
@anamariecox Did you keep the boxers?
@lloydblankfein Please invest here. Save lots of time flying to china.
@markknoller @NewsHour @VP Chickenshit
@KT_So_It_Goes @TheRickWilson Trump got a case of herpes by way of this inquiry. It ain't going away. It will follow him to the last. History taking a huge trump on him!
@SusanPage There is a sink referenced in the starr report. More trivia!
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump You must be the dumb convicted fuck from court. He was obstructing the investigation of Flynn. Be a FLACK but try to be honest.
@ZekeJMiller @SHSanders45 Ask her if liberals are  evil. She'll pause a millisecond before reading someone else's mind and pontificating. Shitbird flunky
@MajorCBS Ohhhhh, that investigation......
@Evan_McMullin Me either. He is toast. Long overdue
@tribelaw Need to start a pool. What date and time will trump wave goodbye from copter steps?
@NicolleDWallace Entirely unrelated.
@DavidCornDC Tomorrow he's going to grab him by his ego and wipe his ass with it.
@latimes The most recent evidence of its demise just landed at Andrews afb
@FoxNews That line was in trumps wedding vows.
@jpodhoretz Act 1, scene 3. It's a long play.
@axios Indians need to buy a coal mine to get any love or attention from these knuckledraggers
@lawfareblog I care. Thanks. Comey is compellingly believable. Trump is a demonstrated sociopathic liar. Would prefer to see comey just beat him up
@DavidCornDC President invokes executive diaper privilege. Gentlemen prefer Depends. Sweet
@DavidCornDC President in a box. Like a beetle stuck on its  back kicking and flailing. Beautiful. Soon he will beg for the waterboard.
@gregpmiller Should have invited him to a nice island.
@DavidCornDC He prefers Ukrainians. Plus manafort got some deals on the pricing. U pay more for no video.
@biannagolodryga @brianstelter Prince Charles and Diana had less interaction
@StuPolitics @jmartNYT There is time.  Evidence is fixed. Trump got Gorsuch. We will get Trump.
@jpodhoretz Medved has an opinion. He's wrong. It's way more than enuf for obstruction. It's tampering as well. Would go to a jury.
@JeffreyToobin @CillizzaCNN Dead on. Summary judgment time.
@CillizzaCNN Of course it was correct.  Journalists aren't fabulist. That's for scuzzy trumpalists.
@ezraklein He'd be a shitty mafia boss.  Probably eliminated decades earlier on account of his mouth. Totally shitty alleged president.
@jimsciutto Hey hey hey, bye bye......... does the marine band know that one?
@CillizzaCNN Long pregnant pauses....otherwise known as a trump marriage.
@CillizzaCNN Cuz trump is a really hands on guy.....hand on your wallet maybe. At this point he is an unindicted felon. Time to call it for what it is
@CillizzaCNN A beautiful thing. Our president is a lying fat bastard. It's not conjecture and it's not a hypothesis. It's on the record. It's historical
@jpodhoretz See I read it as depicting a savvy operator trying to corrupt a law enforcement officer. The world and Washington work the same.
@JohnJHarwood College......because knowledge is good.
@JohnJHarwood Basically....Americas future thinks he sucks......
@JohnJHarwood With these skewed demographics his base itself could die off before impeachment starts
@DylanByers @QuinnipiacPoll There is plenty of room and time to bring his numbers lower.
@CillizzaCNN Did we miss something?  Bunch of guys in robes danced with a fat bastard?
@PeterAlexander @NBCNightlyNews Busy handing out his biz card.
@DylanByers Investigators found knuckle dragging impressions linked to trump.  Contradicting common belief that president is a swine.  Just a knucklehed
@EliStokols McCain is wrong.  There is no evidence or basis to know that a presidential request is classified in and of itself.  not in this instance
@DavidCornDC We r now forced to rely on the integrity of Rosenstein Et al.  That's hardly comforting
@JRubinBlogger @kasie Fairly outrageous?  Inconceivably outrageous.  Complicit.  They need to remember who sat in the dock at Nuremberg.
@DavidCornDC News alert' probe is and was messed with. Duh
@BradMossEsq @KenDilanianNBC It's waived when not asserted. Clarity is established. EVP is not a retroactive claim
@JohnJHarwood Failure to assert privilege is a waiver. Nothing further required from wh.
@jimsciutto Contemptuous of America people and unlawful violations of their oaths. Entirely prosecutable and impeachable offenses by each witness
@kasie DNI unable to say that president didn't make the request of him. Lights out. Trump is done.
@DavidCornDC @MartinHeinrich They are all going to share a cell. And their calls will be recorded. Rose stein and McCabe too
@jimsciutto Directed?  What a shameful dodge. Our leaders are syncophantic cowards.
@peterbakernyt Will meet and talk in a mens room at union station. Trump is screwed.
@mitchellreports Shameful cowardice. Russians couldn't be happier. They are just slow walking trump to the gallows.
@DavidCornDC Dead man walking.
@EamonJavers Loving it. Longer they duck dodge and delay gives rest of us more time to dismantle this president.
@20committee He will be questioned by mueller. Shameful that he is dodging. Soon to be retiring.
@mikeallen Putin must be outraged. He has full confidence in sessions.
@shanvav @mikeallen Prisons are chock full of guys who say they did not do it. So too is WH.
@juliehdavis Building his jail cell counts as infrastructure. Makes America great again
@washingtonpost He will always be a scumbag. It's genetic.
@chrislhayes Or his lack of personal dignity in accepting. Once you have slimed yourself by being Christie's flunky, maybe this degradation is cleansing.
@Deanofcomedy @Mediaite And then he unzipped Sean's fly and inserted new batteries. Sean happy.
@chrislhayes Why bother impeaching this turd. Just invites pence. Better to tie them up, expose them, and kick the shit out of them. Each one. Cheers!!
@Deanofcomedy Little Eric is the trump seal pup. Never works out well for the pup. Does a driver or a putter make for better clubbing? Sad. Little pussy
@KellyO It's like his wives....please meet my 7th choice. Yuuuge
@CillizzaCNN I think he is projecting. Naked Mike huckabee in a sauna. Ugh. Close your eyes and imagine Sarah in a bikini. Now Donald. Could be worse
@CillizzaCNN It's ok. We don't think president fat bastard and his spawn are people either. Just sad kids wishing their dad loved them as much as his ego
@PhilipRucker Just scream and curse at the camera. That will distract just enough.
@bterris @PhilipRucker Deep throat is one on one. Those numbers make it anal for sure!
@TheDailyShow Does digging ones own grave count as infrastructure?
@mitchellreports Somebody is making a recording......
@costareports @PhilipRucker @AshleyRParker I'd rather have VD than be left with Newt Gingrich vouching for me. Trump knows he is sinking. Newt is already dancing on his good fortune.
@JessicaTaylor @alexburnsNYT @nytimes Melania had same request of Sessions. Stand in line

@EricLiptonNYT And trump keeps it secret while suggesting it was some kid. Putin likewise. Teamwork is at hand. Time to call him a threat to nationsecurity
@mitchellreports @RepChrisCollins Giving him a platform to defend the indefensible makes no sense. It's not news. He's not a pundit. If president can't speak for himself tuf
@CillizzaCNN @NewDay They also like dog treats. Here Fido. Come!!
@realDonaldTrump You didn't win dipshit. You got appointed. Total loser. We will take it back. History will laugh it's ass off at you and your skanky brood
@CillizzaCNN Did Sean ever have any credibility. One thing to squander something. Entirely different when you never had it. Big mouth.
@20committee NSA lies to us by being silent, president just lies. Who got hurt from this leak?  No one. But the president. Still says it was fat kid.
@AlecBaldwin Right on. Fight on. Trumps a turdburger. Fuck him if he can't take a joke.

@IvoHDaalder Cmon. It's not like he isn't busy. Has to get up, pack, tweet, travel to golf course, play round, make phone calls, kiss up to kings, tweet
@CillizzaCNN Imagine how he talks to his wife. No need, just ask the other two who are bound by non disclosures. Best part of this is no aide will muzzle
@jaketapper @nikkihaley That inner circle is too busy masturbating on a cookie to let her in.
@washingtonpost Horowitz is old and broken. A joke with a pen and point of view. He is the punchline. Getting rich scaring a shrinking middle class. Loser

@KellyO I presume each time they refuse to provide details, and in the instance of each tweet, that he is masturbating furiously. Both small hands!
@DavidCornDC He'd prosecute the leaker who shared the calculated risk. Fuktard
@McFaul Too many syllables to count for these knuckle draggers.
@BillKristol Sure but stop concurrently trashing it. You unleashed these forces personally. Start solving the problem.
