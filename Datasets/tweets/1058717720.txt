The economic impact of #TrumpShutdown is staggering. It’s imperative @realDonaldTrump appreciate the need to keep the government open &amp; functioning for the American people.

I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle toward reforms that will increase security, provide protections for young DREAMERS and TPS recipients, and improve the process for asylum seekers fleeing violence.
Once the government is reopened, there should be a thoughtful discussion including hearings and expert testimony about how we can achieve 21st Century border security and effective immigration reform that will strengthen our nation.
Democrats and many Republicans have said for more than a month that this ill-advised game of chicken over a border wall is irresponsible and does not advance the interests of the American people.
Reopening the government is the responsible decision &amp; I’m glad @POTUS has finally opened his eyes to the need to end this manufactured crisis.

The President should work with Congress to reopen the government immediately.
These important resources for survivors of domestic and sexual violence are critical to so many women and families. This shutdown will weigh heavily on the most vulnerable individuals, and could deprive crisis centers, shelters and legal assistance programs of important funding. https://t.co/0I6WIjOlK1
President Trump has effectively shut the government down over his ego. The American people deserve much better.
President Trump’s game of chicken over the border wall is ill-advised and will not make our country safer. We need comprehensive immigration reform that bolsters border security and protects young DREAMERS, not political stunts.
It’s extremely disappointing that President Trump has brought us to the point of a partial government shutdown that will furlough hundreds of thousands of public employees in the middle of the holiday season.
Earlier this week the Senate passed a clean funding bill and the House should send that legislation to the President. President Trump said, "If we don't get what we want one way or the other ... I will shut down the government." This brinksmanship is irresponsible and unnecessary
I’m disappointed that President Trump and Congressional Republicans are once again bringing us to the brink of a government shutdown. The fact of the matter is Republicans control the Senate, House, and White House.

@onlyorganic #organic farming is important to our economy and environment in New Hampshire and across the country. Stay active and stay engaged! Make your voices heard about why we need the #HomegrownOrganicAct!
@onlyorganic Many producers in New Hampshire are hesitant to transition to organic farming due to the cost and additional land needed – the #HomegrownOrganicAct will provide more resources to producers to make the transition easier.
@onlyorganic Simply put – the #HomegrownOrganicAct can help farmers grow more right here in America by leveraging existing NRCS conservation programs to boost the transition process. This bill could open up more land &amp; financial assistance to help farmers manage the long transition process.
@onlyorganic #HomegrownOrganicAct is a win for our environment and our economy!
@onlyorganic The organic sector has seen strong increases in annual sales, but access to land and costs associated with transitioning to organic continue to be hurdles for farmers. The #HomegrownOrganicAct will provide robust technical &amp; financial assistance to farmers who want to transition.
@onlyorganic @SenBobCasey The #HomegrownOrganicAct would make small tweaks to Federal conservation programs to better position farmers to transition to organic Ag.

The Administration should focus on the areas where there is bipartisan support and work with both Republicans and Democrats for the benefit of the Granite State and communities across the country.
I have serious concerns with some aspects of President Trump’s proposal and rhetoric. The constant message I hear in New Hampshire from law enforcement, treatment providers, the recovery community, and others is that we cannot arrest our way out of this crisis.
Our bipartisan measures include expanding access to naloxone, strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs, addressing the Medicaid IMD exclusion, bolstering law enforcement, and increasing prevention efforts.

NH's Penny Pitou 1st American to win Olympic downhill medal once said "You know, when you stop falling, you stop learning. Falling means that you're pushing yourself.
