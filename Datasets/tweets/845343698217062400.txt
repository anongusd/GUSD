@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan &amp; I think that's what is wrong when something in anything in the system gets created it breaks homes and at the same time racism will manifest itself don't forget some generations have been ahead of other Generations in their time especially with certain race it's just facts. Pg8
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan I'm going to call it like I see it I think the day when child support was created it destroyed family homes in 1975 I have always spoken to my grandfather and my parents and the ones before them they never mention child support you support the family. Pg7
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan If you want to see the race war stop you have to build skill programs to help those of color to work their way up but just saying to stop race you have to support it with action not just words and some celebrities just don't understand that.. pg6
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan And in order to create a great future like you say you have to get to the bottom of the root of the problem and don't forget the KKK still exist that needs to be a problem that needs to be resolved and eradicated don't be disappointed to hear the truth. Pg5
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan African cultures have their own way of expressing themselves and right now it's going to be versus themselves like I said a richer class versus a poor class and if you can't listen to their poor class and you're rich being black you're spaced out if you can't understand.pg4
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan Happening today so life has a history and when I'm curious about something I look at it I read the histories and find out why this is happening in a certain way in our society right now yeah I might not be right to say slave master but you have to remember. Pg3
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan Families with broken homes and it's really destroyed Society when child support was created in 1975 it was designed for women going through a divorce now we have women going into welfare as soon as they have babies not fair to a man that's trying to get up and it's still pg2
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan You made some good points &amp; I'm not hear to argue with that I'm an open minded person. &amp; With women they had it tough but they also have advantages that men don't have &amp; I'll address my point. I was curious to how &amp; why child support was born &amp; looked into why there are more pg1
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan Poor black people dont relate 2 rich Black people with money especially when they think slavery was a choice that's a slap to their own kind in the face including scholar's like Martin Luther King. So respect their tradition &amp; understand there history don't deny it never happened
@hmsharp11 @Denita81016394 @serenitybee1 @MatthewACherry @VanLathan They both know about slavery but the one from college &amp; working families he don't understand the concept of having nothing &amp; so the parents.

@SuzanneWiedl @JimCarrey But what the hell am I saying! We have a big baby👦as president with no actual experience in government like he's done only 3 years in NY comparing to others that have been politicians &amp; lawmakers for 30 years! Those are experience this buffoon in the white house does not hav😒😅
@SuzanneWiedl @JimCarrey That's a good question! I have been thinking about that all my life but I also noticed all of the politicians are old which means I'm assuming in my belief is that age and life experience it's it's ultimate worth. young people 👦can't grasp that yet No matter the smarts 👴👵😅

@TracyMar @mollydepret @realDonaldTrump Those days that women were able to stay home and Men made good money take care of the house the kids and his woman those days are long gone. Now your kids are 40 years old living with the parents. I seen this coming and it was in 1996 I noticed the pattern 😒😅
@TracyMar @mollydepret @realDonaldTrump Relationships today don't last so if you sharing your apartment with your boyfriend and one of you split? And your minimum wage? You're not surviving landlord don't care they don't want to hear it and Trump is a landlord this is narrow-minded thinking it's sad.
@TracyMar @mollydepret @realDonaldTrump I know a woman that works minimum job she has three of them to make some kind of ends meet and she looks miserable! By the time she makes what my friend makes she's past 200 hours while he makes more in 60 hours than her.The system &amp; landlords apt are not design for single people
@TracyMar @mollydepret @realDonaldTrump You hit the nail on that one! I'm on the East Coast in Boston and I have a friend that makes $24 and he owns a condo and he also still has to watch his spending and we talkin single. A lot of people forget that not everybody is in a relationship minimum wage jobs is disaster.
@mollydepret @realDonaldTrump The American dream along time ago was find a nice girl college educated or not find a nice girl buy a house together &amp; have kids get married pass the house to your children. Today landlords like Trump don't care if u make $9hr he calls that mission accomplished &amp; rent is $1,600😒
@mollydepret @realDonaldTrump &amp; sharing an apartment can create conflict of who didn't pay for their rent that month now you have to carry the weight the landlord don't care. your his welfare/food stamps disability income he lives off of you these Maga's are your disgusting lazy scumbag landlords 😤
@mollydepret @realDonaldTrump Agreed minimum wage don't pay the bills if your single? &amp; Looking for an apartment? It's not going to happen. Why you think your parents survived the old days. Only couples can survive but if you have kids? Or single? Your in trouble.

@tmston_2 @monshertx @CBSNews I like guns 🔫and I read the story from his own words he said it was not loaded and as you can see in the picture his hand finger is not on the trigger. I get his joke but it was bad not from me but it was tasteless for (not gun lovers)that follow him hope that cleared the air 😅
@tmston_2 @monshertx @CBSNews Monika I understand what you are saying but you have to remember not everyone that is following him might not be Maga voters &amp; love NRA this back fired on him because he has a universal crowd. But I get the father joke has been around for years.
@CBSNews Only people that love the NRA? Should be on his page if he's going to display this kind of behavior. I get the joke it's a father joke but his followers might not all be pro gun so it back fired🔫😅 know who your followers R or hire someone before u post a picture with gun😏
@CBSNews If he wanted everyone to get his joke? He needed to have a follow only Maga base for followers. He should know better I understand his stupid dad picture joke that's his daughter &amp; I know about father's protecting their daughter with the father's to boyfriend jokes.😅

@redpilledbaby @CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular Your article did not even State who the slaves owners were? This article proves nothing it's just a bunch of gibberish with no facts 😃
@redpilledbaby @CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular And these white slaves were not slaves at all they just had white skin so I asked who were these Pirates and what nationality the article is missing so many pieces. And it was just callinizing taking away slaves from Pirates to slave them in other countries and 🇺🇸 bad article
@redpilledbaby @CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular So many questions about this article I'm not religious I find it to be abusive in nature &amp; I blame religion for the human divided including wars. Because of religions we have so much misguided information &amp; by the article it also sounds like an opportunist of owning slavery.
@redpilledbaby @CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular This article said the Barbary were a group of Muslims &amp; it mentions religion this is not solid proof of slavery only religion slavery witch we have today. So who &amp; what race was this cosair?
@redpilledbaby @CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular comparatively little attention has been given to the prolific slave trade that was carried out by pirates, or corsairs, along the Barbary coast (as it was called by Europeans at the time), in what is now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, beginning around 1600 AD.
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Brown people never forget Charlie (Brown people they never forget) the only way this country can move on if hatred gets removed from Power bigotry has to be removed from power in all fields in the law including law enforcement it's the only way brown people can live in peace.
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular You whip them you paid nothing to pick cotton in the fields you sick the dogs on them and then you shoot them Point Blank Range and the Caucasian male goes on the offencive. I'm just telling you humbly why? Why not acknowledge the wrong it does not hurt to acknowledge my friend
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Racist beings exist because white people some not all but some still sugar coat that they're ancestors seem that they never owned slave's. Brown people remember all they want is acknowledgement &amp; respect why is that so hard for Caucasian male to acknowledge?
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Who owned slave's? I never owned slaves my ancestors never owned African slaves. But why did u just get on the defensive Charlie? There is no shame if you said my ancestors owned slave's but you just went off &amp; mentioned about Africans selling slaves😒 I mentioned slave owners 😃
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular The news is the one that is owned by billionaires so they are the only ones that can spread truthful information but you and I know that's never going to happen. Charlie or Dave so the they are the ones that should own up 2 their bias that's just truth.

@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular We have to be honest the KKK members do exist &amp; they work in some of the police force but they hide they're true intentions of hatred towards color folks.

@Fayedainese1 @SweetJaine44 @steve_vladeck We have been at War since 911 so air strikes were necessary due to location of enemies of Bin Laden 😒 this Syria attack is only because he said she said Asad just Launch chemical weapons on its civilians?

@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular He likes to tweet I have no problem with that just like I have many nationality friends so I dont roll with the trend just because if I see a Russian citizen I dont expect them to be some kind of enemy. At the end of the day a person is a person I believe paranoia is running deep
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular We have wars that are now passing 18 years!

@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I don't find Hillary Clinton to be innocent either she's no nun from a church all of this bothers me that they run for presidency why have a dark looming presidency investigation Cloud ⛈over them and I stand with the law the law has to overcome and manifest itself in balance
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Agreed Charlie and I'm not just here to bash Trump himself I'm very skeptical of what is going on with the Hillary investigation I too will be buying her book because I'm curious like I said the vision of others and why she has a storm way before trumps decided presidency
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I'm not going to say the media tells lies but I'm not going to say the media tells truths I would just be fooling myself. That's not in my nature I believe in balance and Law and Order and truths and sometimes the truth? Can take 7,000 people documents📝📰and their current events
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Right now to me? Trump's tweets to me it's his book📙 it's his story and that to me matters when the media puts a story of what he said or says? I go and take a look because I can't be hooked on media truths lol but I look for myself and see what he says. That's his story
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I like to listen to Democrats Republicans Tea Party liberals I like to buy their books &amp; compile evidence of what has been in a media storm.Dive into the minds of what those events were looking like through their vision and even listen to Trump's vision I'm an open-minded person
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I'm going to buy, James Comey 📙just to see what the speculations of the investigation is and what has not been covered in the media. Like I said I don't pick sides but if you complete the puzzles in many forms of separate stories you will have a Clear Vision of who is corruption
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular If he's innocent? You don't need to surround yourself with lawyers and keep bringing up Russia and also adding another special counsel, &amp; having also creating an atmosphere of an investigation storm⛈ those are things to question. This was bad from the start ⛈ of his presidency
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular And what strikes me odd Charlie is that Trump wants to have his own special counsel which also adds another Republican leader I know it's not going to be a Democrat. That's not in Trump's vision. But it's adding more special counsel's of more Republicans?. That's bizarre 😵
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I would understand you Charlie and it don't mean you're wrong but these are Republican investigators it would be different and I might agree with you if they were Democrat investigators as the head lead teams. I would find it bias and believe the investigation is compromised
@CharlieOakes12 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular All we can do is to wait for the investigation to close. I don't think Trump's tweeting is helping with any investigation. I mean we have to remember these are Republicans that are investigating him. Mueller and James Comey, they are Republicans that hold the law and work in it
@marvinalexis27 @iluvpeasoup @DavyDove3 @Ashley_0803_ @wagepeace @FearTWD If Rick keeps making loose irrational decisions like this?

@NY_Sweetie @john_was_typing @DaNinjaDabs @FearTWD I do agree with you but I also think that not every new encounter should be hostile I think that's getting a little old there should be a friendly group that they run into once in awhile. u know spice it up a little. I look at every new group like they're hostile automatically😅
@iluvpeasoup @marvinalexis27 @DavyDove3 @Ashley_0803_ @wagepeace @FearTWD Agreed I think the part where Rick and Morgan killed some of the savior's that kind of made me mad because they could have picked up an extra 4 man crew and killed the guy with the long hair which obviously was bad. Rick seems more evil I'm wondering where his character is going
@Tony04219 @NY_Sweetie @FearTWD Agreed I don't mind if they mix it up a little bit just hopefully they don't get carried away. And lose sense of direction like the way Rick/survivors started out with surviving against the walkers💀 and now it looks like a gang 👦show/film😏		LoL 😅

@AP and they want a chance to review the material before prosecutors get to examine them.		I took that peace👆from the article from apnews. So nobody don't yell at me😅	I find it interesting that Trump team wants to comb through everything before the prosecutor can handle this matter
@DaNinjaDabs @john_was_typing @NY_Sweetie @FearTWD And the original Walking Dead the writing scripts need to improve a little. And they need to focus on the walkers 💀again bring back that flavor of survival. Because now it looks like a Turf War gang 👦members type show/film😅 not a survival Walker's dead 💀series that I love.😤
@DaNinjaDabs @john_was_typing @NY_Sweetie @FearTWD I'm all about good scripts and writing plots📝📖 of course I love the action but stories have to have some good writing scripts. Some people did not like Fear The Walking Dead I watched all of it nothing wrong with the scripts. Maybe they wanted action? which I saw as well✊💢😈
@Tony04219 @NY_Sweetie @FearTWD I think it would be stupid to merge the stories together and what would they call it?. Will they give the show both of them a new name as one merged?. If they merge they might as well change the name of both shows put into one. and it also tells me they're spending too much money
@Tony04219 @NY_Sweetie @FearTWD I think its going to maybe be a short entity joining together &amp; then later on separating the stories again. so both series stay in their own paths,&amp; then once the ratings dip they might just mix them up again.then split the entity shows away from each other again so its not merge
@marvinalexis27 @iluvpeasoup @DavyDove3 @Ashley_0803_ @wagepeace @FearTWD Anything with good writing scripts always make me come back but don't get me wrong, there has to be action and with this genre? It definitely has to have Gore in it hopefully they stay on topic with the walkers and very good Scripts I love good writing plots!📝📖&amp;👊✊💢😈 LoL 😅
@marvinalexis27 @iluvpeasoup @DavyDove3 @Ashley_0803_ @wagepeace @FearTWD I watch the fear in The Walking Dead I like it the writing scripts was a little boring but it picked up and I watch them all all the seasons and the last one was just getting pretty fired up.

@SiekmanEd @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Let the investigation be complete no one needs to interfere with documents of an ongoing investigation 📃 let's not jump into speculation that there is nothing there against an investigation I think documents📃 speak louder than you Ed😃respect the investigation and the documents
@atheistscott @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I'm sure he's been offered money but some people in this world cannot be bought. And some people are just too damn miserable with the money they have that they become greedy with power and complain when they are in legal trouble like think about it you're not poor!😤😒
@JulianJ9482 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I don't know what the KGB has to do with the FBI but at the end of the day  you have to respect law enforcement and the rule of law don't get paranoid on me 😃 the government is not after you LoL
@realDonaldTrump That is the best news you have given me today!. Bye Paul Ryan you won't be missed! 🙋✈
@ChinchenJustin @meanoldprick @LerouxMatthew @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Welcome to the Twitter party!! Justin 🙋
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 I just don't like to indulge in conspiracies and propaganda where are you here about information from Word of Mouth. I like to actually see documents 📃 for myself and it actually comes from the source that is working on the investigation those sources hope that info helped
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 No I have seen the legal documents that were released to the public there's plenty of documents being released in the public right now but what I am saying to you is that there are other confidential secret documents that is not available to the public and many witnesses as well
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 When the investigation is complete full and thorough you and I will know about it but right now it is not safe to leak confidential documents 📃 everything will be notified at the right time just have faith if you did nothing wrong everything will be okay that's true facts
@SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I was using the casino as a metaphor I hope that cleared it up for you bomba. You sound frustrated I'm sorry that you sound frustrated right now over a (legal investigation)
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 There are just some information'  that the public is not allowed to know for the moment I hope that's cleared up for you.		The public is not allowed to know as well as the media about secret investigations
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 I'm not an expert but I can see you're still stuck on the word collusion. Get away from the word collusion you're just confusing yourself let's just stick to facts we do not know as Citizens the documents and investigations are there I hope that helped you 😃
@atheistscott @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Agreed this is not the first time he's been brushed with the law 😏 his mannerisms says it all👲👦 thugs never change they only change clothes👔💼😈
@SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I understand what you are saying about collusion Bomba. And I explained earlier about what collusion can do to you for example I'm with my friends at a casino and colluded. casino found out I be barred from playing again or other events as an example
@SnazzyBBQ @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 At the time of the inauguration that is what it was called a collusion I don't know if you look at the news maybe hear it from Friends? The word flew around the world I hope this helps bomba. 		Now the small problem? It manifested itself into an investigation make sense? 😃
@SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I didn't say to charge him with collusion I said it manifested itself into an investigation I hope that helped and cleared that up for you bomba
@UnrealDTrumpy @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular It was harmless but collusion got serious when billionaires from around the world gets involved conflict of interest, emoluments clause each country has to step in when they see a manifestation of a possible corruption😈
@UnrealDTrumpy @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Agreed we can't just make up our own laws 😏 collusion like conspiracy they can manifest themselves into an investigation. For example a cigarette seller on the corner turned into a major heroin supplier that's where (manifestation) is born something like collusion was harmless
@Microsingular @SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 But just don't think about collusion just think about that something happened in these campaigns that it manifested itself into an investigation I hope that helps 😉
@Microsingular @SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 Collusion it's like conspiracy It's Tricky investigation like if you're in a competition and you colluded with a friend and it's written in contract or policy that you can be charged? That can create problems so maybe in future campaigns collusion should be written law
@Microsingular @SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 (Collusion) it's complicated kind of like (conspiracy) when you get charged for conspiracy like they see you handing a large duffel bag full of money and pictures were taken and now this mysterious truck you hand it over it's gone pictures were taken. Complicated
@SnazzyBBQ @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I'm well aware that collusion is not a crime but depending where the collusion is being in placed you can be barred from any event or activity that can disqualify you I hope that helps clear it up.Example me my friends colluded at a poker game &amp; the casino band me for (collusion)
@JohnMcC17972987 @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular John I welcome your your hatred that's okay for me your care to sit down and tell me about sit down can the Twitter Circle here have some coffee☕

@Cult___45 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular His attorney general is his goddamn lawyer! But this guy has broken all the rules hiring his own lawyers he's basically trying to write his own constitutional laws do what he wants that's an embarrassment for attorney generals to be pleasing their presidents 😤
@Cult___45 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Agreed in fact as president you're not supposed to have criminal attorneys! The president tradition is always to have your attorney general handle your cases that is in truth in the Constitution that people as Citizens haven't forgotten about. His attorney general is his lawyer!
@LerouxMatthew @Microsingular @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 Who's they? The left and the right? Anybody that wants a nuclear war? Is not okay in the head anybody that wants a war everyday is not okay in the head I know the world is not colored In Roses but it's also not created in darkness either I hope that answer helps 😃

Enough of the games she's not president I wash my hands of this problem they both had FBI investigation one still does. LoL😵
@SheldonBeatty @redpilledbaby @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @shacker56 @Microsingular That makes two of us because I don't care either I don't pick favorites! 😤 You're under investigation? You need to step aside. Enough of the games and anyone any candidate is under investigation? You need to get the hell out of office! You need to step down! 😤
@nickdoesmyhair @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular I have been saying that for a while now like I don't understand it's a republican decision for me I'm not a left or a right party. I don't pick favorites enough of this TV show!.😤 I'm fucking tired of it😤
@Microsingular @LerouxMatthew @davesiegel @ChatterfoxLesa @redpilledbaby @shacker56 I don't think anybody wants a nuclear war LOL can you imagine your lover you waking up next to your lover and they say every day they want a nuclear war.......😒 LoL 😃
@AndreaS37687 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular Then we must get to the bottom of it right? We must get to the bottom of the left and the right let's just get to the bottom of it. I don't pick favorites if you have favorites? Then we can work together you have to be neutral I appreciate that kind of voter

We got a God damn problem I would think the citizens in your country will remove you very shortly I don't got time for games! 😤 Not The Apprentice show 😤
@ChrisBorizov @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular If a Democrat president wasn't Trump shoes right now? I would say the same thing let Mueller do his job!. I don't pick favorites the only favor I pick? Is the law that is the one balance that does not stab you in the back tomorrow and change its Minds every day!😤
@Microsingular @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 I thought we was getting an America not an apprentice show so I really don't know what to tell you 😒
@Microsingular @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 I really don't know what to tell you because I don't belong to the left or the right I guess I would get my decisions from the cosmos. I hold every candidate accountable for their actions I don't get on my knees because the rest does. 💋💄

@redpilledbaby @davesiegel @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular What I find more embarrassing? Is your a president and is crying like a baby I about an investigation of your justice department in fact! It's the citizens justice department let me get my words right it belongs to the citizens of the United States of America!.😤😏
@redpilledbaby @davesiegel @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular I don't pick favorites when Obama screwed up and is found guilty on something? So be it I don't have favorites no president is above the law I was never mad when Bush was screwing up left and right or Bill Clinton let's go further it don't matter.
@redpilledbaby @davesiegel @WordUp1776 @ChatterfoxLesa @shacker56 @Microsingular See that's the kind of mentality that don't get you places you still thinking about Obama? When bush left office which it was better than Trump by the way I never mention bush whatever Obama did wrong I say man up he never cried about bush move on.
@ChatterfoxLesa @davesiegel @redpilledbaby @shacker56 @Microsingular You want to go further than that do you want to go to Bush Senior? Or bush jr.? You know what how about getting creative let's go straight to the Core have them sit down and ask her what they have done while running an office bring the mountain of paperwork

Let's move on to other matters she burned off all the emails who knows I don't work in the email Department go as Bill Gates he's got to have all that shit! 😤

I'm laughing so hard when I saw this 😆 https://t.co/6JXDFaljgA
@JimCarrey Now this is the top painting of all time!! LoL 😅 Jim your getting better at your paintings LoL 😆
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN What makes me upset is the news keeps talking about the Killer. I think about the parents that lost their children's that is heartbreaking. They to have a voice that needs to be heard with action and all I hear is crickets all the time from tragedies like this
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN I always tell my kids be honest with me and I don't lose my temper when they tell me the truth in fact I like when they tell me the truth and then I explain to them that they did well and they feel better and I get over it up here in the truth LOL but it's a win-win 😅
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN Yes I understand what you were saying mental illness is a challenge I can agree with you but a cure to mental illness? Is to have a sit-down with your child and always tell them to be honest so they know you're looking out for them.
@RossJames01 @mcfarland_sally @CNN Yes a brown kid when I have a conversation I don't alienate I just say directly of what it is if a criminal mugged you? Are you going to say is a criminal you need to be specific for me to catch him or her LOL. If it makes you feel better I'm Brown. 😃
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN Sometimes it's not mental illness U have to see the world in a bigger picture people have tempers but this school shooting stuff? The Young Generation dreams of being on the news get their 15 minutes of fame they already have hate and that can be deadly in itself😅
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN Did you see the news recently of the brown kid? that was 9 years old shot his sister in the back of the head 13 year old sister. She didn't give him the game controller so he went got the parents gun came back shot her in the head I rest my case 😅
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN Mental problem is a poor excuse. LOL I say common sense most school shootings are happening with kids with guns in the house I'm not saying that all parents with guns in the house are going to have school shootings LOL. If you don't have your guns in a lock box? You're crazy 😅
@mcfarland_sally @RossJames01 @CNN As a parent if you can't sit down with your kids then U are a failure and U should not have any kids. Because you're looking more of the interest of looking out for yourself pay attention to your children they don't like your house rules? kick them out when they turn 18yrs😅
@RossJames01 @CNN But when it comes to school shootings? And it's a teenager killing all their parents as kids a kid attended the school gets the guns from the parents or parents are aware of the child buying a gun they are complicit in this murderous crime. I'm a parent and it's heartbreaking
@RossJames01 @CNN All of the school shootings happen because parents have guns in their homes. The casino Massacre was a grown man that own guns since the 1980s. I can understand if a grown man went to a school and started shooting kids then I blame the NRA 😒
@RossJames01 @mcfarland_sally @CNN The new generation of today? Are kids raising kids I grew up in a strong household with strong laws if you don't like your parents laws in the household? Then when U move out you can have a week home and have guns in them so your kids can kill you and a bunch of kids at school😅
@RossJames01 @mcfarland_sally @CNN As a parent you should have strong laws in your house and if you don't have that sit down with your kids? Then you are weak your kids will buy a gun or take your gun and go kill a bunch of other kids at a Public Schools other parents kids your kid is killing😤 I'm disappointed
@RossJames01 @mcfarland_sally @CNN The kid buying the gun should not be buying the gun in the first place LOL. I know how I was when I was 19 years old a gun is a tool. You must treat it with care but when you have  ignorant parents in the home? Tragedies happened 😅
@Fragola_Girl @2020fight Do you guys watch TV you're going to get Pablo news from me he signed the bill. There you go now you heard it from me Pablo news 😅
@StreetsMacD @JulianAssannge @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @DNC @POTUS Julian I like your mind control LOL 😅
@AXSDavidGarcia7 @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Yep just what David said👆 I was just listening him talking for like an hour and he sign the bill. So much for your ranting of saying to veto the bill 😒😅
@CNN Word of advice to parents with guns in the home lock them up or sell the guns! Turn your guns into the police station your kids are not doing well in school hearing demons? Take them to the Asylum and get rid of your guns you're the problem to your school shootings end of story
@mcfarland_sally @CNN Don't blame any government officials blame the parents with guns in the house. A teenager? And guns in the house? Equals disaster 😅 it's not the FBI, NRA, police, it's the parents that owns guns in the house. The source of the problems? Is in the home.
@ogenjr @CNN Forget the news LOL it's the parents with the guns in the house while having a teenager with teenage drama! LOL. In my day school was reading books and go home do your homework eat play some games go to bed go back to school tomorrow. 😅
@CNN This is the school shooting gun generation LOL. In my day U went to school read books don't blame the NRA blame the parents that have guns in their house with a demented child.I own the gun the gun does not own me let's get real.crazy parents with crazy kids &amp; guns in the house😒
@mike_the_sailor @CNN Yeah tell them Michael in my day there was no school shooting! They need to start picking up books &amp; stop finding their parents guns. Those guns are going to outlive me I have a musket in my house it has already been passed down through 4 generations that bitch is older than me😅
@bodhi135 @nytimes Yes that's my real name. Yes people can't believe my name is from a famous person

Oh the irony I wonder about tomorrow? even his head lawyer resign😝😅
@kixrox @SethMacFarlane That's actually a good idea I think the 2020 race should be whoever wins all the fights becomes president that's better than them talking about their policies in the future for the country. LOL just fight your way to the presidency and rather than Wars?Leaders should just fight😅
@SethMacFarlane Seth too funny 😅 your like your own news guy LoL 😅

@wallacegarmany @rationallucha @tlew427 @JoChopra I'm sure Jesus told him to blow up those people 😒 he thought he was playing grandtheft auto game. Blow up people &amp; earn some points. God points 💰💰💰😅
@soprano58_carol @jaybino31 @lrhuff1022 @creativa2806 @RicanInBoston2 @realDonaldTrump If he was brown? Forget Muslim just being brown is enough to create the racist people to just come out &amp; start spitting on brown people. But it's a Caucasian male and all you hear is?.... Crickets &amp; crickets from the president 😒 he has a pattern of crickets of this kind of thing
@DailyTyrant @wamblue @PlanetJanet3 @AntifaHQ @ZackBergerMDPhD @realDonaldTrump Wamblue? Why would you edit Obama's picture? He's bowing to a child when the child is feeling his hair. I remember that bow down. Your a bum bitch 😒 hate much? Change your profile to (I'm a racist faggot shit) 😅
@eugenegu @LIVE_COVERAGE We got a serial killer/killers damn I got to stop watching Criminal Minds I love that show. You don't have to be a detective or FBI agent to know that the killer or killers are watching the news every time they set up their bombs they are serial killers those are patterns 😒😅
@NickKristof You ratted out your wife you're going to be sitting and sleeping on the couch for months. He could have blamed it on a cat that wanted to buy the dining set. But he ratted out the love of his life LOL. 😅
@IFThunder @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders And with all that his son died and he chose not to run in the 2016 campaigns I got to give him credit for thinking about it. I think he will most likely run this time around he might feel ready there are so many  candidates though we will see how it plays out
@IFThunder @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders And he's also been a politician since 1974 or something I remember him in the early 80s he's been around for a long time. Lots of them have and of course he has had downfalls like every other candidate but pretty much stable
@IFThunder @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders And he also reduce military spending cuts which takes a toll on the country and Obama and him did not do so bad with lots of airstrike drones killed a lot of enemies including bin Laden all that with military spending cuts that's a plus!. And more tasks and policies 😉
@IFThunder @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders The best that I can tell you I'm fighting that I can remember is he increased tax on Wealthy, he gave student loan forgiveness, he lowered the carbon emissions cap, increase infrastructure spending, was involved in renewable energy, same-sex marriage, involved Healthcare for all
@IFThunder @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders Yes I'm well aware of Joe Biden's record that's not so great. But don't jump the gun I said I might vote for him which means I have to look at policies first. Which is all of them so we will see how it plays out I don't quickly jumped the gun and say everybody vote for him. 😅
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders And don't get me wrong we don't need a Democrat that's a sell-out that is going to work with the Republicans but I really mean is the Republican voters not the Republican Party itself. If you can win Republican voters? That will be a landslide! 😉
@CelenaWheeler @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders Trump cheated Hillary cheated I'm not going to say colluded? But something went really wrong I don't know but it went wrong there was a power struggle that I can tell you.
@CelenaWheeler @SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders Celena I'm sorry I don't know all I like to listen to points of view I think Hillary Clinton ruined Bernie Sanders presidency for first spot in fact I think he beat her that's just my point of view. Something happened in that race dead people were in the vote LoL 😂
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders The key to beating Trump would have to be a candidate that can please the Republican Party and it all lies in the policies. And a great teamwork leader for me teamwork is a must! Communication is a must! And positive energy for our allies. Policies policies policies!
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders Bernie Sanders is going to split the voting odds for Democrats I'm a universal voter I vote Republican, Democrat, Tea Party, liberal, I spent more time reading policies not just see what's on TV. If Joe Biden runs and talks really good  and has a game plan I might vote for him
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders I know this as a fact anyone around 18 years old? They say they are going to vote my ass they spend more time hanging out with friends spaced out on Facebook by the time they go and vote? I already have gone home and went to sleep we old school are ready ! 😒😃
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders Stacey is right if you go with Bernie it can split the damn party and a bad fracture and way it won't survive and Trump will win again. The running up candidates or Bernie Sanders I think, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and other Dems are flying in the air for presidency
@SBiscontini @NaphiSoc @CelenaWheeler @Fuckpretence @EhmanTannenholz @hansalexrazo @JessicasMyCat @SenSanders I hate to tell you most of you but Stacey is right you cannot disagree with her I'm around in my forties and in my state a lot of people did not vote for Bernie I was going to but I did not vote at all first time in past 30 years!
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I noticed people pick favorites of what they see on TV. When I read their policies I'm like oh no! And I asked do you know who your voting for? And they're like yeah he's cool I'm like no not good for you you're going to be eating trash out the dumpster pal 😆
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Yes I agree we need some politician policy reading class not have people vote for what they see on TV. I read policies of politicians and prepare my paperwork before going to the voting booths but the information is cloudy you have to dig around and ask them questions.
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Washington is a mess LOL and Hillary Clinton I didn't vote for her the FBI spooked me with her LOL.😅 and with Trump? The FBI spooked me with him too LOL! 😅 Would like to see a woman president to represent women leadership but one without FBI problems 😅
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers My friend I know we have been friends for over 25 years he's a republican voter and he voted for Trump and I make fun of him all the time. But I'm not going to get mad at him and yell at him &amp; stop being friends that's just silly I also have other Republican friends LoL
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Just because my friend voted for Trump and is a Republican does not mean he's overnight not my friend I have many friends with different political views so I can't judge them. He's looking to retire soon so am I. We all do the best we can and vote for who you like 😃
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Oh don't worry I should not be judging you I understand. I think you have done enough you deserve it. And I was thinking you was rich LoL 😃 a rich red eating Republican LoL 😅 I have a friend he voted for Donald Trump he's a Republican
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I think you deserve to have your spine fixed immediately and a jiffy just to stop all of your pain so you can enjoy the rest of your life. But at least you're looking at it in the bright side if the worst comes to worst. Soon enough you'll have your house all fixed up next year!
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Getting older and having pain? It sucks! I'm glad you now have your retirement and enjoy as much as you can don't do heavy lifting all the time you're only going to get worse. LOL but you will do just fine people will remember you as a good person helping &amp; teaching
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Oh my God! Well I'm sorry I yelled at you I was being rude I'm happy that you are living and are able to spend time with your grandchild 😃
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I have life insurance for my child and so does his mother but I grew up it was not easy my family is poor and I just do the best I can pay the tax but it's not just for me I'm doing it for other families that don't have the opportunity and have struggles of their own.
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I'm glad you're doing the best you can nobody wants to be on government Aid but I don't judge people just do the best you can. Every walks of life is different and some people never had to go on government assistance because their family members have life insurance
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I was joking on your life insurance but I know you understand that LOL. I'm not going to judge you that you had to retire 2 years early you did your thing you work paid your taxes you deserve it 😉
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I have been voting since 1974 I have voted for many presidents my next president will be a woman if she's smart enough and no please don't bring up Hillary Clinton I believe everyone deserves to run I know old men don't want to see a woman president it's in their blood. LoL 😅
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I'm a Republican, Democrat, Tea Party, liberal voter I'm many mixed in one and I have to spend my entire time reading all policies from all politicians. Tax cuts can stay the way they are I'll keep paying higher taxes My Views/opinions are my own. I understand your view Deborah.
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Okay Deborah I understand that you like your president okay? You're entitled to like him for whatever reason you like him and I'm not going to take that away from you. And I'm not a liberal I'm a universal voter so please get it right😉
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I have seen people that were high and mighty a Republican type got sick where did they go? To welfare and got their retirement because they were too sick. Now they want to be Democrat LOL 😒😃 be happy you have a life paying tax is good! Not bad people are backwards😒
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I'm tired of The Selfish fucking people they are okay today but tomorrow they can be sick and need one of the services that can save their life and not be homeless and live in a dumpster somewhere. I'm not rich! I have seen people that were high and mighty

At work and never got their retirement tax money they paid over 30 years it's sad where you think that money went? It goes to somebody
@mcbee_sherry @calebno1 @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Yeah most people don't think about it I say pay I think my tax is only 25% but I pay more you never know if you get cancer or you get into an accident and break your arm or leg and doesn't work anymore now you lose your job and then say thank you Pablo you saved my life
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Go to bed old lady you won't be missed and when you get your life insurance I'll make sure we tax it at 66% 😃
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers See that's how I get you I got U to say liberal LOL typical alcoholic Republican why am I not surprised. U just don't admit your ignorance you think the world runs on a unicorn go tell the military in their face that you want your tax cut you're disrespectful. You're dismissed😒
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers If you pay your higher taxes? You get more police and ice like you want and get that fucking wall like you want now pay your share raise it to 56% just because you are bitching bitch a little more and you should pay 70% bring you back to 1964 😒😤😃
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Stop being picky with your taxes and just pay them already I don't want to hear your bitching anymore because I have been paying taxes for over 20 years higher than 30% and I don't care pay your share! All red States should pay 38% now lazy bastards cheap
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers Just imagine if the military was to pick which states will pay more in taxes and which ones don't obviously you don't like to see a stronger defense and your ignorance shows through your damn teeth you need to shut up because teachers and other government owes is paid by tax!
@calebno1 @mcbee_sherry @KarrieChavez1 @treasonstickers I like paying high taxes that's the problem with you fucking red States you guys always want to pay low taxes and expect me to pick up your Slack. Almost all blue States pay higher than 30% you need to keep paying your share increase it to 38%! It's your problem as well as mine

@wish2bjen @Mess_OfMe @KaivanShroff I seen someone try to pull this off in my state the guy went to jail and he hide money in a storage but not in his name was his wife but they got a divorce so money dont get touch after that?FBI was still following four months traced all of it back she open new business shut down
@wish2bjen @Mess_OfMe @KaivanShroff Nope I think they just care about the money she's going to move all of it when the divorce starts but the building? They might just sell it that's going to be hard to move to any of their names the government is seizing properties 100%
@dbarcon @KaivanShroff This is what happens when evil men want to run the stage they want to be on the world stage now Trump has to meet his fate just like the rest of the drug lords that killed many and also found and died by the very sword they wield their turn is coming was better running TV show 😅
@dbarcon @KaivanShroff Deborah this is what it reminds me of the Italian mobs living the very high life all comes Crashing Down.Or the Pablo Escobar or the ochoa brother or El Chapo the Trump family reminds me of them became president highest in the world now it's crashing down hard.
@mscheryl58 @KaivanShroff @joncoopertweets She's hiding it for him they will most likely flee the country or she will wait for him 20 years or more but not in this country she will take the money with her so she does not get touched in a different jurisdiction  indicting her back will be very difficult
@RealCapricorn01 @KaivanShroff @LauraMRoman The properties will be taken that I can tell you the money she will have to move it to another country if she's lucky they might not freeze it something big is coming though agree with you that's why the divorce is coming because they want to move money fast to another country
@Zainiac1 @KaivanShroff Agreed that's where this is going and they will leave and she will leave and flee the country and take all the money with them start all over again moving to Russia LoL 😂
@Vote2CleanHouse @KaivanShroff The divorce is a way for her to hide his money they're ready to go on the Run I have a feeling his son is being indicted. Running out the blue with a divorce? Is very telling they are getting ready to bail
@SDscribbler @KaivanShroff Agreed and the divorce explains it one way for her to take all of his money and then hide it somewhere else and leave the country for life he might evade indictment and be on the Run it's coming.
@Enidaugust2 @TheMarieFonseca @oconnellaboo @KaivanShroff Donna I was really kind of thinking the same thing and to make it even better put him on child support and  rake in millions I'm thinking they're ready to flee the country. I don't think she's going to wait if he gets indicted could be more than 20 years. 😉
@KaivanShroff She is leaving because someone is going to jail! And 5 kids? That child support is going to be very heavy! He's going to be broke she outsmarted him in the end I saw that coming 😅📃📝📰✈💰💰💰💰💰💲 five Moneybags represents each child on child support LoL 😅

@kurteichenwald @JesseBrown775 @weatikru What, then, should the United States do about illegal immigration? A fence won’t work, mass deportation won’t work, and every plan the government has adopted in recent decades has done nothing but enriched and empowered crime syndicates that have transformed a modest problem

@fuzzytoad @militarywife You know who's going to win today? In Pennsylvania? Connor that's who's going to win don't forget you just got Pablo news I'm your news anchor for the day 😆 you're getting ahead of time news none of those late date documented information from the news media Trump news is on time
@fuzzytoad @militarywife I believe Trump's ranting you can't make that stuff up I believe Rex Tillerson when he called him a moron himself you can't make that stuff up and a bunch of cabinet people quitting or getting fired you can't make that stuff up your articles are weak it's late information 😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife You just mad and you're ranting I understand some of your point of view but you're lost when it comes to information especially when your leader says fake news and you're putting up articles you're contradicting yourself 😒 who do you believe Trump or the media? LoL 😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife You got a good question Rex Tillerson cut his trip short because he was told to step aside but something tells me he was not aware of his firing yet that I can tell you was random because Trump has random tendencies he was already in bad friction with Trump for awhile
@fuzzytoad @militarywife You choose the media over Trump you're not a trump supporter! A real Trump supporter believes Trump's tweets 😃 Trump says tomatoes and you say bananas I thought you believed Trump? LoL 😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife Why are you relying so much on the articles? I thought you relied on Trump? I believe Trump see today Trump put up on Twitter that he got fired that makes sense to me what Trump said today it's what he says today 😃😒u just mad 😤😆
@fuzzytoad @militarywife I'm telling you right now to step aside and let someone else yell at you for the moment. Like I think I'm going to step aside and let you rant and then come back later😒😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife You're just mad because you make no sense he didn't know he was fired LoL step aside does not mean that you're fired that can mean you need to take a break let this person do the job. Fired means you're terminated you no longer working here you must pack your things and go 😒😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife Like John Kelly said (step aside) that does not always mean that you're fired so he didn't see it coming he got fired today he cut his trip short but didn't think he was getting fired 😒😃 Trump is a spineless coward he fired him like James Comey on Twitter I saw that coming LoL
@fuzzytoad @militarywife Hear your piece of your article👇		The president announced his ousting of Tillerson on Twitter. Tillerson was unaware of the reason for being fired when Trump went public with the news, a State Department spokesman said.
@fuzzytoad @militarywife I just finished teling you but you're just going off at your ranting. I said Rex Tillerson said live right now today that he got his firing less than 24 hours you calling Rex Tillerson the liar? He didn't know he was getting fired yet Pompeo had been aiming for the job for months
@fuzzytoad @militarywife He didn't cut it short he cut the trip short when Trump sent out the Twitter 😃see I believe Twitter news Trump news for Twitter only he saw it so he got the jet back to United States why you thinking so hard about it? LOL you think too much 😃 but I gave you your answer
@fuzzytoad @militarywife And why didn't you tell me about the article and a Fox News? Why doesn't Fox News have the article? About Tillerson firing? Every time I go to Fox News I see Hillary she lost the race why you guys keep talking about it? It's like you're stuck in 1974 😒😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife Once again you calling me a liberal I don't know if you're stupid? Or crazy I'm a free voter &amp; I have many different news outlets Fox News is included you know them? you know Breitbart? I don't know you got the wrong guy 😒😃 you jump straight to Liberal throwing bulshit articles
@fuzzytoad @militarywife But you know what surprised me more is that you didn't call it fake news like Trump says &amp; they have problems for months Rex Tillerson call Trump a moron with his own mouth on Twitter I believe Rex Tillerson they never liked each other true story Pablo news my news feed to you😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife And another thing Goldstein just got fired today he did not see it coming Rex tillerson's guy got fired today after Trump released his Twitter comment of firing Rex Tillerson I read your article but Friday? Rex Tillerson didn't see it coming your guy flip flops too much
@fuzzytoad @militarywife LOL now you call me a liberal another alcoholic Republican I read your garbage article but you proved me right because you're crazy president cant even make up his mind I believe Rex Tillerson he said it live on CBS he got fired less than 24 hours ago get your facts straight
@fuzzytoad @militarywife I don't know where you get this last week Friday him getting fired information I believe Rex Tillerson he said it right now with his own mouth that he got fired less than 24 hours while on Africa trip. believe you? Or Rex Tillerson? 😒I think I'll take Rex Tillerson😃
@fuzzytoad @militarywife &amp; you said the news mention that Trump announced he was firing him last week on Friday I just saw the news now live with Rex Tillerson saying he got the news less than 24 hours and that was on Twitter everyone site he saw it while in Africa he said it right now and walked away😒
@fuzzytoad @militarywife No that's not what I'm saying LOL I said 3 months ago Trump said it was fake news that Rex Tillerson and Trump had bad friction Trump said it was fake news but apparently it was real news you understand? It's not that difficult they had friction he found a reason to fire him.😒
@fuzzytoad @militarywife Trump said that they were getting along just fine😒 and he said the fake news media does not know what they are talking about and that was over 3 months ago about Tillerson possible of bad friction. Trump said they lying fake news but look what happened 😒😃
@KimDHello I noticed the guy fires people while not in his presence Trump's pattern is becoming very clear with me he fired Omarosa while not in her presence in the real world firing someone they might be angry it can come back to haunt him start leaking more information to the Press
@KimDHello @realDonaldTrump Yeah cheap shot LOL this reminds me of James Comey deja vu all over again he fired this guy while being in Africa and he fired James Comey when doing a meeting😒 that's low firing someone in front of the entire country rather than doing it private the guy don't need the money LoL
@militarywife @realDonaldTrump He did this to James Comey deja vu all over again I kind of knew this was coming. After seeing the headlines on Tillerson siding with the UK on the Russian nerve agent. Who would want to kill a Russian spy? For one spies are hard to find that's why must had something good .
@Bruton65Paula He pulled this move on James Comey I just got deja vu all over again he fired Rex Tillerson while being out on a trip just like he did with comey. I notice he fires people when they are not present or in his presence like Omarosa and others he has no backbone LoL 😒😃
RT @DTrumpPoll: Big numbers needed for this poll.		Q.Who has the largest following?		#TheResistance #MAGA 		Please Vote &amp; Retweet 😊
@ihatebellpepper @realDonaldTrump @astros @WhiteHouse Twitter boss LoL 😃
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I have nothing against the NRA I like guns but when kids start buying guns? And killing other kids in school it's just not normal and most of them have been white kids and white people don't say nothing about it. israelian dude does something like that they call it terrorism😒😃
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Yep poor people want to be rich middle class I don't know what they want to be they look confused probably the reason why they call it middle class LoL😂 &amp; Trump says he will shoot you on Fifth Avenue in New York what kind of fucking President says that before he became president
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump And people's violence like Derek for example he says he's going to kill the drug dealer like where is people's minds at? What if your kid gets killed being the drug dealer? Bet you Derek is just as poor as me some people just want to be high and mighty you're no different from me
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I remember the early 80s poor people they used to just hate on the rich now poor people hate on other poor people 😒 and the middle class rather than minding their own business they judge you. back then ?middle class work came home tended to family now they run they mouth
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I think since this guy became president people had just become more judgemental like I have seen the dramatic change people are measured by their wallets now if you're poor you get look down on if you're middle class they look down on you the rich they look to the sky LoL
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Yep agreed if Trump was a chill guy make everybody happy I would not care about the sex scandal not one bit I would look at it just like the Bill Clinton I would not care and move on. What makes him look bad is hate speech FBI investigation and emoluments claus &amp; dividing country
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump If the Democrats get the house and Congress back in November? Trump is fucked he is going to be facing some heavy heavy charges things might return back to normal because there's too many republican corruption that's what im looking at it in that point of view we need clean house
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I think in Pennsylvania I think Connor is going to win the Democrat but what worries me is the$120 million dollars that did not get used for the voting polls machines and staff that worries me I'm watching all this closely on their elections the red States I'm concern
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Paying someone to stay quiet basically forcing them to be silent is a crime he just has too much baggage going on baggage they should just try another Republican he's not an outsider he's just like them all politicians have secrets even Democrats they have been bribed before LoL
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump You knw like the Stormy Daniels situation right now some Trump voters are trying to tel me that it's fake news or it never happened or if it did so what?Lol I'm like you serious he's going through what Bill Clinton went through but worse much worse because he tried to silence her
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Yep that is what you call a narcissist they live in a delusional state he cannot accept reality to what it really is if I have a $5 bill in my pocket and I say is a $10 bill and you tell me it's A5 and I say no it's not I'm being fucking delusional a narcissist it's fucking crazy
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump When Ronald Reagan, Bush senior, Bill Clinton, Bush Junior it was not like this make America great again that's some faggot shit you're not making me feel like part of America Obama came and their feelings got hurt I like diversity culture learn from a different race have fun🎆🎉
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump This guy says fake news and everybody flows with it since when did news become fake? Then what am I supposed to believe? Fox News? Last time I looked their last name says news LoL 😒 like other outlets LoL 😃 and disrespecting the news Trump gets that from  putting hates news😒
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I didn't know that Obama hurt their feelings that bad like they really holding grudges the Republicans hated Bill Clinton to impeach him and it was petty over a blowjob not an FBI investigation &amp; think that is okay America is not normal right now LoL 😅
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Why you think George Bush said the Republicans are not the same I know what he means by that because I grew up and voting and voted bush because there was no other better candidate and I have been voting way before Bush &amp; I have seen personality this Republican party is different
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump LOL yep you seen those rallies? They look like torches message looks evil and not comfortable like a gathering of supremacist and you seen the brown people there? Those are paid actors we live in scary times we're brainwashing has become The New Normal
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I did the schematics on a nuclear threat one nuclear bomb can take over 3.5 million people shoot two? that takes out an entire state! And we have an other nations have enough to kill everyone in 1 night &amp; that is what is going to happen War brings confusion nukes are going off
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I know how this world is going to end the first nuke is going to confuse other nations their hands are going to be on the trigger &amp; the information is going to be scrambled no communication everyone's left in the dark and then the nuclear bombs are going to go off that's the end
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump That nigga Kim junk on is not going to denuclearize shit he's going to say he's doing it but with fingers crossed behind his back he's not doing it because Russia is not doing it India is not doing it China is nt doing it and so is a few other nuclear countries it's unfair to him
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Yep when I saw that I knew something was terribly wrong my jaw dropped and confusion I asked myself where are the universal voters at? This could not have just swung all Republicans overnight. And it took hours that is red flags to me I remember that night went to bed 6 a.m..
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump And what makes me even more mad? Is that I have to hear a trump voter sounding like an echo carrying his message saying he's not doing nothing wrong 😒 LoL
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump He spending way more money than Obama and his team ever did that guy Scott Pruitt flying jets all day private military over 2 million spent Trump?$900 million dollars! That went to his Resort emoluments clause and then says the poor does not need services to help kids single moms
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Oh! And don't get me started on the emoluments Clause him charging over $200,000 coming in at the Mar a Largo door &amp; other businesses he still owns he has broken so many laws and these voters find it to be normal like he's Jesus or some shit my mind can't process that information
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Oh and then the genius has a government shutdown not once but attempted twice! That's disrespectful things like that like what he's doing hate speech his whole cabinet is One race that's disrespectful to me I say brown skin because I represent all skins he's disrespectful

America's defense is broken distractions monkey shit then you got zombie voters crazy times. 😤

Wants more money for an army LOL with a tax cut and want to kill off the poor by cutting off services that's cutting jobs! 😤
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah! Thanks for the reminder we have 120 twenty million dollars sitting around and it's supposed to be for our voting machines so it won't be voted fraud or hacked no money is used like I said real shady shit is going on right now this guy has United States defense low!😤

That's fucking insulting that's our allies 😤😒
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump As he's acting like a clown playing decoy other nations are doing their thing under the rug I just feel like he's a distraction other nations are slowly gaining power creating new technology making stronger nuclear missiles we are sleeping! Trump is not helping LoL 😃
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump He complains about the inauguration crowd, he blames his allies, he blames the Republicans he blames Democrats, he blames Obama he mocks Bill Clinton but he's just like him Stormy Daniels he's in the same scandal. no respect to North Korea and as he's acting like a clown?
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Trump just has too much baggage I can't take it and firing James Comey?&amp; wanted to fire the special counsel prosecutor and all these scandals and paying people to stay silent? Those are things that a gangster would do a criminal he has all the signs of a criminal a serial killer
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump He's not well he has a personality disorder like I said he used to hang out with the Italian mob back in the early 80s to the FBI dismantled the mob. now he's a Confederate? The next he's going to become a Russian he has multiple personalities who will he be next? Is the question

@DerekWayneJohn @Mikewiesner6 @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump In life there is a big difference between a rich person and a poor person and I don't relate to Trump but I understand everyone's voting belief I don't know the conspiracies of the government and the news I don't believe everything I read but it's there for a reason 😃
@DerekWayneJohn @Mikewiesner6 @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Derek you also have to be prepared of what happens if your kid ends up being a drug dealer? Are you going to kill him or her you have to think about life both ways there's a two-way street to every story what if your kid gets killed bio parent like you that your kid killed?
@DerekWayneJohn @Mikewiesner6 @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Derek it is a race problem because when crack was distributed and not many white people was addicted to it you did not see hospitals helping brown people I know that with facts that's facts bro but when why people are addicted to heroin now we have clinics? And long prison senten
@DerekWayneJohn @Mikewiesner6 @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump So what are you going to do Derek you're going to kill the drug dealer in the lab coat that is legally bound to sell legally and a pharmaceutical building?I'm a parent and I'll speak to you  facts it's my job with my kid and tell him about every drug including alcohol that kills

I'm a brown cat when u start talking about long prison terms &amp; u have a 1970's want to turn back time? Something is wrong with America
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Obama slow down tax spending by repeating criminals back out the once that were not aggressive drug dealers🔫 &amp; session &amp; Trump wants long prison terms for any amount not good while u did a tax cut 😒in Pennsylvania last night he was talking about killing drug dealers not good😤
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Obama was not perfect he had to fight Republicans too on laws I think Trump got it easy he just un did most of his laws but he's doing with rant talking &amp; has this hate look on his face &amp; no diversity in his cabinet that concerns me. Ben Carson? &amp; Maybe 4 brown Republicans
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Derek I'm just not sure with Trump he just has too much problems FBI? &amp; Now stormy Daniels? LoL &amp; now he wants a parade? Army?! That's expensive!! &amp; I thought I was a money Horder! This guy spends money. Golf trips? Scandels?, FBI? Russia won't go away? This is to much 😤
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump I'm being honest Derek what I don't like is Trump got bad habits if I say I got you than I got you. If i screw up a deal I own up to it. Obama was not the best just because he's brown I'm not going to say he never made mistakes, also Bush or Bill Clinton.
@DerekWayneJohn @Mikewiesner6 @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump If I'm not an America I'm dead LOL😃see that is what I'm talking about LoL. I still got my green card Derek but just for you I'm calling ice tomorrow so they pick me up I'll wave goodbye to you when I'm on the plane &amp; u let your base know that an immigrant just left the country😃

If I said make Spanish parade great &amp; only have Spanish around me &amp; u different nationality u might feel left out too &amp; you should because I talk code
@Mikewiesner6 @DerekWayneJohn @parothed13730 @TheRoyalPosts @realDonaldTrump Me? I'm all the voters in one &amp; I don't choose or stop talking to my friends even strangers because of their belief in voting status.

@brooklyn4844 @wokeluisa Wu-Tang Clan! 😆🙌
@wokeluisa I don't blame the gun or the gun maker a gun is a tool like a knife in the kitchen women use forks and knives😃you don't seem those get banned but let's just stay to facts I blame the parents of the disturbed child and not being aware of their possible hostility in the household
@wokeluisa All I know is that if your child gets you more than 20 years? In prison for killing a bunch of kids at school? I know you're going to fuck them up while you're in prison both of you are going to kill your own child in prison LoL 😃
@wokeluisa People forget that the kid that shot up the Florida school was actually a student people talk like it was some random person. I say the parents should be in prison along with the student that killed 17 kids change the law arrest the parent with a disturbed child problem solve😒😆
@jstwood @realDonaldTrump Sometimes kids don't handle bullies very well and they don't know who to talk to so they start creating a fantasy and with the news with school shootings? They start dreaming about becoming the next school shooting killer they are in competition now World has changed it's sad
@jstwood @realDonaldTrump Personally I don't blame the schools or teachers needing guns it's it's what goes on at home the parent or parents are not paying attention to the disturbed child and with guns at home and Call of Duty video games I have a child too but I also have a third eye I miss nothing
@jstwood @realDonaldTrump And that is what drew the line the stabbing was pretty much gang related a bunch of them were fighting right in the lobby in the morning from there on out metal detectors and cameras were placed and that was over 20 years ago probably 35 years ago LoL 😃 damn I'm old!! LoL!😆
@jstwood @realDonaldTrump Yeah and my school they had cameras to but they didn't have a police officer they had a security guard but it was good enough because he had a quick dial out and cops will be on the way because there was a cop around the area there was a stabbing with students in my school
@ianrm55 @realDonaldTrump The egg the egg is there to protect the child because last time I look children should not be carrying those guns there's your answer problem solved😆
@jstwood @realDonaldTrump Metal detectors? Metal detectors have been in my school since the 1990s going before 2000 and High School LoL 😃 and that was over 20 years ago! I thought every High School and middle school had metal detectors in the country I'm scratching my head on this one LoL 😮😆
@dunkelherr666 @ChelleLBI @realDonaldTrump Yo Francisco that was a good meme😆 LoL
@SherryPotocki @realDonaldTrump Armed guards? This ain't Russia that shit is expensive what needs to be done is get these stupid fucking parents kids under control! Maybe we should put the arm guards where the parents have guns at problem solved see I solved your problem 😒😆 advice from real American 😃

@RichardHesketh1 Agreed Richard I learned in life that when you're honest with yourself and you're honest with others your life will be better off and when you're being blamed for a crime you never committed the police will believe you because you're always an honest person it goes a long way.
@RichardHesketh1 I have an answer for you because criminals always feel guilt LoL 😂 it's in their DNA they always seem to do things they're not supposed to and when Crimes start to catch up they start doing things like that 👆writing things like that it's crazy 😒😃

@StarAasved When we do start operating in manufacturing who in the world is going to buy our products?. I mean everything falls and a system everything runs in a order and when you take something out of order it's going to collapse everything else we are expensive to maintain 1/2
@StarAasved @realDonaldTrump I agree with you I have been seeing lots of businesses closing large ones only Amazon is surviving and it's operating a food business store obviously food will never go out of business because food is key essential everything else? Is going to collapse brick-and-mortar is closing

@lizardq28875918 @SenSanders If you choose not to have health insurance? Because you're healthy &amp; with this no existing health insurance mandate? You're setting yourself up for failure just go ask a fucking college student some Never end up paying their college funds &amp; die because the Bill is beyond reach😏

@TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump I did the math out of 45million followers break 32% is 1,406,205 people out of his 45million that means he has 43,593,750 that r bots &amp; other country trolls that meddle in the election 😅 but he only gets 80,000+ likes?
