@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Oh and too Kerley. But it doesn't count because he's not "ideal"
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Yes. The NFC East was such a competitive division last year
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk I have seen what Jameis is. He is a bad QB, he's done for. Go draft another or put Glennon in
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk By a late field goal! Don't act like it was a blowout.
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Ok, Denver's D is good, but not the best ever. If he is so good, why can't beat them?
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Cousins: 13-16.
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk You're obsession with overall bad QBs is troubling. Gabbert in his career: 10-29. Jameis: 7-13
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk And he still was better!
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Jameis has Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson around him, and he has trouble. Lynch didn't even practice
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk No! Washington is not a good football team! They barely beat Kessler and the Browns last week!
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Yes. Considering Jameis lost to Paxton Lynch when Siemian got taken out.
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Yes. Except Wentz, Prescott, and Siemian. They have proven themselves early.
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk They are not a good team, and have a highly overrated QB, plain and simple.
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Right. That's what I said 2 months ago, look at their schedule! They will lose 14 games no matter whose QB
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Prescott, Siemian, and Wentz have all proven themselves this season. Jameis hasn't in 2 years!
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk I don't like unproven QBs like Cousins, Gabbert, Winston, Taylor, Tannehill, Kaepernick, to name a few
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Its not a sophomore slump. 10 losses last year, same results again. It's just who he is, he is horrible!
@spencersmitty13 @ProFootballTalk Yep. Everyone needs time, just like Jameis. They've turned out so well
@BrittMcHenry Hahahah!!!! You are so funny!!!

@RedSox @HanleyRamirez Not on that play at home. What is he doing?
@JonHeyman they "may" fall out of the #2 spot?

@maggieNYT Biased. You're a disgrace

@TBTimes_Rays I ran on the field during that game
@Jared_Carrabis @ShiDavidi And Owens
@bnicholsonsmith But they just hired Ben Cherington!
@InfoRedSox I believe the Red Sox should fire Dombrowski and hire John Conway
@TimBritton Why is Holaday not catching?
@gregorMLB Oh did they?? Hahahahaha
@WTOPSports McCoy scored
@McCulloughTimes As he should. Took away what could have been the biggest milestone of Hill's career.
@MarcCarig It's over cautious. Let the man pitch, he's 36 years old! Could have been the biggest milestone of his career.

@PeteAbe Question. Will O'Sullivan be called up?
@theshowdannyp @TheHockeyPress Boston
@RobertMurrayFRS Who?
@InfoBruins I agree with adding veterans to the offense, but we need another defenseman!
@antoniopuesan Any more updates on this report?
@AdamRubinESPN Thought so. Just wanted to hear you're thoughts. Thanks, Adam.
@AdamRubinESPN Wait!! Bernadina? Yes, or no?
@AdamRubinESPN Adam, do the mets have an interest in calling up Roger Bernadina??!!
@AdamRubinESPN Bernadina?
@NYMetsfan37 @BNightengale @antoniopuesan Not coming from me. UNCONFIRMED report from @antoniopuesan
@ChicagoSoxTalk @BNightengale @antoniopuesan He said the Red Sox claimed him and then didn't say anything for the rest of the night. Odd
@ChicagoSoxTalk @BNightengale @antoniopuesan Not sure. The guy is verified and is a host on ESPN radio, so who knows.
@BNightengale Per @antoniopuesan Red Sox claimed him. Are they "lower-ranking" AL team?
@PeteAbe Perhaps if Yasiel Puig would be in that situation, things would be different.
@masnKolko Any update on Stephen Drew, Dan?
@IanMBrowne @RedSox Will it be Puig tomorrow?
@JMastrodonato But, they claimed Puig, right? Per @antoniopuesan UNCONFIRMED
@incarceratedbob @antoniopuesan Right. Forgot to mention it was unconfirmed report. Sorry about that
@incarceratedbob Red Sox claimed Puig, per @antoniopuesan
@BRAYkingBad @whitesox @YasielPuig @antoniopuesan Right
@BRAYkingBad @whitesox @YasielPuig Its the other Sox that claimed him, per @antoniopuesan
@BostonStrong_34 What about Brennan Boesch?
@antoniopuesan @MLBastian Is it confirmed?
@antoniopuesan @MLBastian What about Puig??
@ddddodgers @billplunkettocr @antoniopuesan Very funny.
@PeteAbe I'll ask again. Have you heard anything thing on Yasiel Puig and him being claimed by the Red Sox?
@clarkspencer @truebluela @JonHeyman Red Sox are per @antoniopuesan
@billplunkettocr Red Sox claimed him per @antoniopuesan
@chelsea_janes Cowardly play by Espinosa.
@TNT_Mariners The Red Sox did both!
@PeteAbe Hearing reports on Puig? @antoniopuesan says Red Sox claimed him. UNCONFIRMED
@BostonStrong_34 @Nickk42__ Trade him for Owens.
@Jared_Carrabis Per @antoniopuesan, the Red Sox have claimed Yasiel Puig. UNCONFIRMED
@InfoBruins He has done nothing to improve the defense! Weak!!
@Sportchronicle_ @SportsCenter 100% agree. What an awful human being
@AdamRubinESPN Any chance Mets call up Roger Bernadina?

@MikeSilvermanBB Will we see Rich in a Red Sox uniform again next season?
@ProFootballTalk Will the Patriots sign a veteran quarterback to back up Jimmy G?
@widewordofsport Right again, but I'm sure fans felt that he would be better than his past outings. Never expected him to be an ace
@widewordofsport Exactly. I never understood it why people felt so strongly about this guy
@widewordofsport @OverTheMonster Doesn't throw it over. can't reach over 90MPH
@widewordofsport @OverTheMonster At the start of last season. When he came up, everyone thought he was going to be great
@widewordofsport @OverTheMonster Last year he was overhyped as this pitcher who would be at the center of a trade for Hamels. Remember?
@OverTheMonster And so it remains that Owens is one of the most overhyped pitchers in the Red Sox system
@TimBritton Ah, didn't know that. Thanks, Tim
@TimBritton Any reason as to why the Red Sox wanted Owens to make the spot start and not O'Sullivan?
@BostonStrong_34 OVERRATED
@JMastrodonato O'Brien, Eck, and Lyons?
@PhilosoJaysFan @GetRealBaseball Not going to happen tonight
@BostonStrong_34 Why not Le√≥n?
@tpanotchCSN Still signed Dale Weise!
@AlbertBreer @AdamSchefter Of course he does it to Bell instead of Brady.
@TheLedgeSports Palmer or Rodgers for QB?
@THNMattLarkin Any word on Dennis Seidenberg?
@AlbertBreer Do the Patriots sign a veteran quarterback to back up Garoppolo?
@sportingnews He is a disgrace, we shouldn't cut him some slack
@CSNGiants Agree with you. I thought the trade was good as well, he'll bounce back.

@PeteAbe Well Papelbon will not let that happen tomorrow
@ClevisMurray Over/Under: Celtics win 50+ games this season
@Rangers Thanks for not picking my tweet
@Rangers What is it like pitching in the playoffs? #TexasTwitterTues
@SunriseWROL This should be a TRADE ALERT
@AaronJFentress Thanks for the follow.
@RyanHannable @DaleHolleyWEEI Why not? They need a veteran. Lindley, Yates, Clausen all available
@SunriseWROL Jax game was in London, CIN is obviously the better team. Regardless, they still would be 8-8
@SunriseWROL They still would have lost, regardless of the QB.
@SunriseWROL He still played 14 games!!
@SunriseWROL Taylor did have a full season and they finished 8-8. This will be his second FULL season
@SunriseWROL The two wild cards will be KC and CIN. Pitt wins the North, OAK wins the West. NYJ, BUF, BAL, DEN, IND don't make it
@SunriseWROL Bills are a young, overrated team. To think that they'll make the playoffs is laughable
@SunriseWROL If he's so underrated, why didn't the Jets make it last year? Defense was good, they collapsed
@SunriseWROL Both mediocre
@SunriseWROL Cousins led his team to a 9-7 record in a crappy division. When a has Taylor or Fitzpatrick ever made the playoffs?
@SunriseWROL These QBs are all OVERRATED
@ScottLauber Why not Brennan Boesch?
@BostonStrong_34 Devin or Chris Marrero?
@EvanDrellich Why not Brennan Boesch?
@MikeSilvermanBB Mike, is Brennan Boesch a candidate to be called up?
@JMastrodonato Boesch or Brentz?
@JMastrodonato What about Boesch? Is he an option?
@RedSox Could you please give us the specifics of the Wright injury?
@BuckinBoston @GlobeBobRyan @Mike_Uva Was it Pittsburgh?
@nadeaualex1 @InfoRedSox Right. So it should be today's lineup instead of tonight's
@InfoRedSox Thought they were playing at 1:35?
@jorgeccastillo Time for a trip to the DL?
@CSNAuthentic English?
@mlbdepthcharts You do a great job, I'm on you're website constantly. Keep up the good work!

RT @SunriseWROL: Should the Red Sox pull the trigger and #FireFarrell?
@alexspeier If it was worsening, why did he play tonight? Why didn't he try to rest it?
@ScottLauber Then why did Farrell play him if he knew of this?
@BostonStrong_34 Abad hasn't been impressive in his appearances so far. Disappointing
@jtomase Why didn't he use Pomeranz instead of Wright? Has more base running experience, does he not?

@chris_frotten I agree. Still a lot of time
@chris_frotten I know, don't worry about it. Let's just hope this team has a good rest of the season and Farrell will be soon gone
@chris_frotten That's alright, it's baseball, what do we expect? Haha
@chris_frotten Neither do I. Neither does anyone really
@chris_frotten Right again.
@chris_frotten Gotta run, but glad we could come to agreement on some things. Hopefully all turns out well with Kimbrel, I'm sure it will
@chris_frotten Which was great to see
@chris_frotten Right.
@chris_frotten Bad in game decisions. Bad management all around. Something needs to change, all starts with Farrell gone
@chris_frotten That's concerning when the young guys begin to publicly question the manager
@chris_frotten It is odd. You're right, he seems like a nice guy, but loses control of his team often
@chris_frotten Dombrowski wants someone new. Not Farrell, obviously
@chris_frotten O'Sullivan looks determined to take his place. Pitched well against LAA. We'll see
@chris_frotten Unfortunately, this is true.
@chris_frotten Right. He was great, established a good relationship with the players
@chris_frotten Lovullo should have stayed on, but they wouldn't fire him right after his bout with cancer.
@chris_frotten True. They need fresh blood.
@chris_frotten Exactly. Buchholz excuse for last game was, "I only gave up three earned runs." Unbelievable
@chris_frotten This is Koji's last year, done after this. God knows what will happen to Buchholz
@chris_frotten Good. Glad we were able to agree on something!
@chris_frotten True. Blame goes on the manager in a situation like that. Farrell clearly not confident in Koji or Tazawa
@chris_frotten Right. That's where they need to look at during the deadline. That and starting pitching
@chris_frotten Buchholz for the time being as well
@chris_frotten Agree, Koji is drained. Doesn't have it anymore
@chris_frotten Blame Farrell for putting him in that spot then. Blame goes to Farrell as well
@chris_frotten Fine then. I'll be more open to him, but I'm still not impressed this year. Agree he has been dominant throughout
@chris_frotten That's why I said earlier that he is one of the best in the game. Just not happy with his work so far this year
@chris_frotten Fine I'll wait and see what he does. Hopefully he'll improve
@chris_frotten You're just a real jerk, you know that? Turning a baseball argument into these personal attacks! Enough!
@chris_frotten Had Doritos actually today. Haven't had Cheetos in a while, but I do enjoy them.
@chris_frotten Again, appreciate that
@chris_frotten Just MY thinking. I am allowed to think that, others agree with me. My god, not everyone loves Craig Kimbrel!
@chris_frotten Thanks
@chris_frotten Im done with this argument. I tried to have a conversation with you, but obviously that can't be done.
@chris_frotten Have a nice night. All set with you.
@chris_frotten Enough with the name calling seriously. All I'm doing is trying to have a conversation and you're just being a jerk about it
@chris_frotten Kimbrel is not working out so far. Hopefully he changes. But the others didn't work out so...
@chris_frotten All I did was try to have a conversation, you turned into thinking I was a miserable fan.
@chris_frotten on Kimbrel.
@chris_frotten That's why I'm on the radio and co-host a sports talk show. You're exactly right. I invite you to call in to discuss you're
@chris_frotten he's turning into to other failed Red Sox closers like Jenks, Bard, Bailey, and Hanrahan. All didn't work out
@chris_frotten Fine then. We will see how Kimbrel finishes the year, hopefully better. But not great so far
@chris_frotten I'm not miserable, just not a fan of Kimbrel who doesn't throw it over the plate when he has the potential to do so.
@chris_frotten Thanks for you're nice words as well. Good to see that we could have a nice conversation.
@chris_frotten Who the hell do you even root for anyway? And I'm not acting like a member of a team, just a fan.
@chris_frotten Again, he has had other bad performances!! Wasn't just tonight
@chris_frotten He has had other bad performances. 17/19 in save opps, 1-3 record. Not all-star worthy
@chris_frotten Well if he a player like Kimbrel isn't living up to his potential, then why should we sit here and watch it? I'm
@chris_frotten Why? I'm not happy with Kimbrel's performance, ask any other Red Sox fan and they'll be unhappy with him as well
@chris_frotten Well with Kimbrel, we expect to be good every game he plays. That's why he is here, to be a dominant reliever. Not 4ER
@chris_frotten 3H, 4ER runs last night. I don't care what his ERA was then, only care what it is now. Still not good enough.
@chris_frotten for a reliever anyway. Especially Kimbrel who is one of the best closers in the game
@chris_frotten Its not a matter of "over privileged fans, it's a matter of fans wanting success out of their closer. 3.55 ERA, not good
@chris_frotten You said booing would hurt Kimbrel's confidence? Really? He deserved to be booed, he was bad tonight, awful last night!
@chris_frotten You're strange obsession with Kimbrel is quite odd. He deserved to be booed tonight, and last night. LOL!!
@chris_frotten But what do I know, I'm a moron.
@chris_frotten The two are totally different pitchers, but Kimbrel is not good in non-save situations. Clay is not good in general
@chris_frotten First of all, Kimbrel is much better than Clay, but he tends to not throw it over the plate and walk too many, like Clay!
@EvanDrellich He does not throw it over the plate. Just like his buddy Clay

@Padres @d_no36 Friedrich got the win, not Pomeranz
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Hood has been a great fit
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Definitely, they have the assets to deal, but Utah will be very picky
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio I agree, Utah is becoming formidable
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Love Hayward, but Utah looks like they found their franchise player
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio But Cousins would work out tremendously here
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio I'd love to see Cousins a Celtics uniform. Celtics would have to give a ton, not sure Ainge is ready for that
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio They have a lot of options, so it should be interesting.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Likewise to your points
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Its very frustrating to watch the Celtics not make any moves. Too many picks, too many guys, too much
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Right. If he doesn't and goes to GSW, they are the favorite.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio I know, a lot of players still out there. None of these teams are set, especially not the Celtics
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Early prediction. I would say it would be OKC vs CLE. Cavs are the obvious favorite in the east
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio The east has greatly improved. IND, MIA, CHA, BOS, DET, NYK, WSH all teams to watch from #3-8 seeds. TOR #2
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio I agree. I think Cuban goes all out to re-sign him. But who knows, Dirk may want to go elsewhere
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio With the west improving, they'd better improve quickly or else
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Not sure. Heard they were favorites to sign Dwight. I really don't get this team. They have some work to do
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio As any team would
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Its not such a bad backup plan. Dirk is great, although older, he still has it. They'd rather have Durant
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio If Dallas doesn't re-sign Dirk, they are in major trouble. Deron opted out, and Parsons is a free agent
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio If Memphis loses Conley, I see them falling. Houston is in turmoil, and Dallas needs to re-sign Dirk.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio won't get them in the playoffs.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Oladipo was there best player. Orlando is in trouble if they don't make a big move. Ibaka is a start, but..
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Adams has proven he's ready to become their starting C. A great playoffs
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Without a doubt, they will be in the playoffs, but as a #7-8 seed I'd say
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Right forgot about Illayasova. Him and Sabonis together would form a great PF tandem. Illayasova, underrated.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Should be interesting coming up. MN seems determined to get Butler
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Towns, Wiggins, Rubio, possibly Butler. Looks like a good team to me.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Westbrook, Oladipo, Durant, not sure who would play PF. Kanter/Adams at C. They need a solidified PF.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio 100% agree. Arguably could have the best lineup in the league.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Big on Minnesota. Think they can reach a #7-8 seed. Watch out for Utah.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Right. Was good for Miami, but health is a major concern. Did not consistently play last year.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Again, this all depends on where Durant ends up
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio They could take it to GSW or SA in a 7 game series. Also could beat CLE, arguably OKC is the best team.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Agreed
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Hassan Whitseside an option as well. Greg Monroe in a trade or even Sullinger, which I don't think would work
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Love the Spurs. Would say that OKC is favorite as the #1 if Durant re-signs. GSW 2, Spurs 3. LAC 4, wide open
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Honestly, I think he re-signs with OKC especially after getting Oladipo. GSW would have to wow him.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Absolutely. Now with the Warriors in play to get him, watch out. Who knows what will happen.
@SunriseWrol @celtics Horrible. Who is this guy?
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Awesome! Looking forward to it. Check our out our shows on https://t.co/Q9vJF8rJig
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio We've been trying. Working some things out, just got started with this on WROL 950am. Lots of callers
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio And it looks like they'll be long term guys. At least it's safe to say that with Draymond.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Great, looking forward to a great discussion. Our show will be focusing very much on the draft and the finals
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio It is amazing. And they've done it in two years without hardly making any trades or picking up free agents.
@ThaGreatOne99 @CBSSportsRadio Great!

@alexspeier Horrible, just horrible
@CJNitkowski @MLBONFOX @FS1 Kershaw for NL. Stephen Wright for AL
@BostonStrong_34 Better offensively than Vazquez
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe I love the Red Sox, but Rondon is a very underrated closer. Plain and simple
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe they are MY Red Sox as well. I don't like the Cubs, but they are a good team
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe I agree they have a lack of relievers, they are inconsistent. They will deal at the deadline
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe And he still has a 1.23 ERA after facing the likes of Harper, Arenado, McCutchen, Cespedes, Goldschmidt, Stanton etc.
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe They have also faced the Nationals, Giants, Cardinals, Pirates, and Mets SEVERAL TIMES.
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe I think that is pretty bad, but what do i know
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe He also has issued only 2 walks this year. 30 K's.
@Sonrics6 @PeteAbe Hector Rondon has a 1.23 ERA. Explain to me how he is a "poor closer"
@PeteAbe The Cubs don't have issues.
RT @NESN: Five years ago today, the Bruins were Stanley Cup champions. https://t.co/gDnWjZ7QUp https://t.co/F4hU5g8zgH

Congrats to Bruce Boudreau on being named the new head coach of the @mnwild. Same goes to Guy Boucher, the new @Senators head coach.
@PawSox Will Allan Craig ever be in the lineup?

@JMastrodonato I agree, he is very underrated
@PeteAbe I have no idea. Basically meant that if he can't get the job done, Farrell should give the job back to Koji
@PeteAbe Just like Jenks, Bailey, and Hanrahan. Kimbrel needs to improve or stand aside
@DetroitPistons In 6 mins, the sweeping will begin

@OverTheMonster Where does Stephen Drew fall on the list?
@PeteAbe Did not know his era was that high. Remember him with the Phillies, wasn't great. How long until we see Pat Light get called up?
@PeteAbe @PawSox Why not Sean O'Sullivan? He has the most MLB experience does he not?
@PFF They should take John Conway
@JaredRoberts20 @espn Political correctness, destroying this country. ESPN now
Xander Bogaerts continues to be the most overrated player in the MLB today. The Red Sox should never have gotten rid of Stephen Drew.
@RyanHannable Tommy Layne will join too
@RyanHannable An Uber is en route to Fenway to drive him to Pawtucket.
