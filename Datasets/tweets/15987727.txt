@madelineophelan So true. I feel like they make the name longer on slow news days.
@Kevin_McArdle @jennapederson Totally agree! In this case, I have it easy because the former colleague was working somewhere else already so I didn't even have to lose him for him to make this leap. :-)

@Kevin_McArdle @grove @mndeed @GovTimWalz Great idea.  This is a cool step, but I love the thought on going even further over time.  It would get more women and lower income people into entrepreneurship too.

Not every kid is a "maker" at heart, but entrepreneurship can be a way for kids to bring "art" into the world. Let's pitch entrepreneurship as a pathway of creation for kids like I was with little engineering, artistic, or musical talent. I used to think I had to be a lawyer.
@brennantownley That‚Äôs the one exception. If you have an important meeting to attend, you should yell at everyone.

@mikesonn Cool. I think we agree then.
@mikesonn Also, the paid leave policy is a messy joke of policy because of the sentiment that even speaking out would be punished. Employers can move jobs very quickly.  They don't have to participate in policy discussions. Punishing people for having an opinion discourages good policy.
@mikesonn Thanks for backing off this statement a little bit. I support a minimum wage increase, for sure. I wish the state or the Feds would do their job. It's complex to do this just in St. Paul. You cannot raise the minimum wage on an iPad and jobs we need may go elsewhere.

@higg1921 @fly2ohare I‚Äôm all about city airports... National LaGuardia, Midway.
@mikesonn Visit St. Paul made clear that convention business will suffer for lack of ramp. Companies and employees (including mine) complain about lack of options in downtown core (and some choose other places to locate due to issue). That plus broad consensus is enough for me.
@mikesonn Well, I don't do this professionally. Downtown businesses, the City, Visit St. Paul, the Mayor, and the City Council have hopefully made the strong recommendation on this ramp based on data.
@mikesonn Sounds forward thinking to say ‚Äúno more parking‚Äù but we need jobs now and current solutions not just transit that takes years. We need to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good here in the near term.
@mikesonn Unfortunately... if we have a purist strategy, it will hurt our City.  Rep Alice Hausman listened to and made this argument and now we got no money back from the state for St Paul.
Loss of potential job growth is what I meant. Cray is old news and is not anywhere near this ramp. Different issue. Companies that want to locate downtown are sensitive to making sure parking is readily available particularly for people coming in from east side of metro. https://t.co/GhAt2JSlVo
@mikesonn It is hard (I park at another ramp that is overflowing) and parking challenges downtown have already caused some loss of jobs.
I found some ice cream so everything is better now.
@SarahAnnWheeler @GarrettPopcorn Ice cream &gt; popcorn said everyone ever
@SarahAnnWheeler @GarrettPopcorn I do.
The lack of ice cream in Chicago Midway Airport is a real disappointment.

@ChrisVanecek @UndervaluedNPW @d_gangelhoff Because a typical person gets utility from doing a job he or she cares about and therefore demands less pay to do the job.  That‚Äôs pretty much exactly how this plays out in the market. If I like a job, I might do it for less money than if I don‚Äôt like it or feel good about it.
@d_gangelhoff 1 more thought. Many nonprofits are barely scraping by in MN. If they are underpaying employees &amp; bouncing between funding crises, shouldn‚Äôt they pivot, fold, or merge. Maybe your organization could offer Directors more formal guidance on these indicators.
@UndervaluedNPW @d_gangelhoff What prevents you from leaving the organization?  Is it your commitment to the mission or challenges finding another opportunity?
@d_gangelhoff Hopefully, job market stays strong so orgs (in any sector) that treat people poorly just collapse. I would love more transparency in how pay works at orgs I support so my action step is to seek that. Easy to get info when I‚Äôm a Director, but I bet I can get it as a donor too.
@d_gangelhoff The organizations I‚Äôve been a director of pay people fairly from what I‚Äôve seen. Your experience is a lot broader and I‚Äôm sure there are lots of sad examples. There is so much to this issue that I would love to learn more about from you someday.
@DC_Nomad This is true for me, but I see other people (especially the women in my life) multitask all the time and do so brilliantly.
This speaks for itself in some ways, but you don‚Äôt have to found Tesla to deserve dignity and respect in our country. https://t.co/FUDhMEbJYC
@d_gangelhoff What does market salary mean to you?  Shouldn‚Äôt the market salary for a job that is mission driven be less than one that isn‚Äôt?

@FrederickMelo @BillLindeke @melvincarter3 Everything is released now so I guess we can end this thread.  Hopefully no one will get arrested over the 48 hours we had to wait for this information.  :-) https://t.co/beeafiKW0l
@FrederickMelo @BillLindeke @melvincarter3 Can you explain how those processes are different?  In what timeframe do they work?  How are selections made? Are the appointing public officials in Office when the interviewees are announced?
@BillLindeke @melvincarter3 So they say the law requires immediate release in real time prior to inauguration even before finalists are all selected?  That‚Äôs not like anything I‚Äôve seen before, have you?
@BillLindeke @melvincarter3 They are clearly within the law and reasonable practice. Carter is not Mayor yet and finalists are not yet determined. I‚Äôm sure names will be made Public at an appropriate time. Doing so in real time disrespects applicants and disrupts the process.
