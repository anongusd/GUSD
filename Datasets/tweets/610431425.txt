@PaulMac0413 @speed_mel @CNN nobody ever said we needed a barrier across all 2000 miles. Border Patrol has asked for 270 more miles to be added to what we have already completed. The original estimate was for $25 billion and Trump dropped it down to 5. We also need $ for the drones, personel and entry points
@StephenRJones21 @speed_mel @CNN It's not actually a "wall" but that seems to be the term that everyone has chosen. We started this project in 1996. Since then we have erected some type of barrier fence/wall/whatever across a great deal. What the $5 billion is for now is the last 270 miles needed. Not fake news
@speed_mel @CNN You can't seriously think that that is what it is. You do realize that most of the wall is already built and we're just trying to close the gaps of what is left (270 miles) minus the spots where you can't build a wall and people can't "walk around" due to cliffs and such.
@QConteret @CNN There can't be more than one danger?...and you know that they're "peasants"? These are the ones that turned themselves in. Do you think it's possible that others could have come in that are not "peasants", like murderers, thieves, and drug dealers?

@mjmagee67 @WayneDupreeShow It is a touchy area and I'm not a fan of the government having absolute authority.

@modulator38 @WayneDupreeShow You are right. It does seem as though there is a double standard for celebs and the press. Although, we don't know if secret service paid her a visit afterward and said "hey, do you want to end up in Gitmo"?
@dlarge99 @WayneDupreeShow Technical term is Imminent lawless action and it is an advocation of violence. They would have to prove that there is an "imminent threat" that is caused by her speech. If nobody takes her up on it then its harmless but if they do then she is liable.
@itsbeenbetter @WayneDupreeShow The key word was that she started the sentence with "can". This is why it has to be investigated but prob not prosecuted. If she asks a rhetorical then its not illegal. If she actually requests someone do it then its illegal. They would have to prove "imminent danger".
@planogirl1 @WayneDupreeShow They keep it under the radar for bad press reasons but actually the FBI and Secret Service follows up on hundreds of these types of statements every year. They rarely arrest though because its usually just people blowing off steam.

If an American parent did all this they would be arrested. If he was so far in debt, how did he pay the smugglers? They admit that all they have to do is get caught after they enter illegally and they will be released into the country. Lock em up and build that wall. https://t.co/WRhyDAOYCi
@Lizzy_Unger @washingtonpost It was. He didn't need asylum like he lied about. He was in debt. He used the child as a easier way to get in. He payed smugglers to bring him in illegally knowing they would get caught then released inside the country where he could then work illegally. Dad should be arrested

@sxsdale making other countries come to the trading table equally or putting tariffs on them until they do	take down obama care	supports 2nd amendment	supports decriminalizing marijuana

@sxsdale 1)pulled us out of the Iran Nuclear deal	2)stands up to the main-stream media's fake news	3)Handled North Korea when no-one else could, brought peace back to that region, brought our soldiers remains from there back home	tightened up on all of the illegal immigrants already in US
Are you kidding me? #headslap People like this are why we have so many warning labels. https://t.co/sucFrasPJW
@sxsdale I didn't vote Trump. I think his personality is horrible, he's arrogant and should stay off Twitter. That being said, I agree with most of what he's done in office so far, I agree with his policies and I'd say he's the best we've had since Ronald Raegan.
