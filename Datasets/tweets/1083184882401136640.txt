@mojilu @Imamofpeace How is the woman the really killer if she's not he one in the video slaughtering people? Just because you read a book or because your parent tells you to go out and kill people, don't mean you have to listen. You have a choice.
@Imamofpeace Okay. Wow. I understand that you have the right to your religion, but why follow religion that tells you to sacrifice yourself!? My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ sacrificed His life for everyone. JESUS walked out of the tomb while Mohammed is still rotting in the ground.
