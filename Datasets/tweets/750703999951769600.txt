cpac 2019. keep up the good work. M.A.G.A. and don't care who knows it. I believe in the first amendment, but I also believe in the second one. Hope nobody punches me for that.
I never thought that I would hear a member of the House of Representative's broadcast the statement that "America needs to give praise to Allah", but I have a feeling that we will be hearing more of it before long.

I am just an average Joe, but in my 74 years, I have never witnessed such a travesty in our political system, in our society, our patriotic beliefs, and our respect and reverence for the ideals the we once stood for.  America is swinging to the left so fast that I fear the result
@JudicialWatch Knowing about it is one thing, doing something about it is another. I guess it works differently according to the amount of influence you have or the position that you hold. If it were me, I probably would be in jail already...Boooo

Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.(2Ch 33:14)

@Jim_Jordan @POTUS All illustrating her lack of understanding and her position concerning our beliefs. To be against Israel is to be against God, but then what can you expect. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck; it is probably a duck.
@seanhannity It is just plain ridiculous and not thought out. Can't happen. She must be on something besides the news.
Just saw on the news where "drag queens" are reading to our children in public libraries. People are calling bad good, and good as bad. Where are we headed.
I have been away from Twitter for a spell, but I am back for now. My first thought concerns Ms. Cortez. What are your thoughts concerning Christians and others that don't share your beliefs.
What's happening to our values and standards is frightening.  Where wilt all end?
