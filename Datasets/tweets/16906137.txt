Set aside for the moment your definition of and belief in "collusion." There will certainly be other times when the crucial interests of America are in conflict with the petty grievances and endless narcissism of POTUS. How did today make you feel about his ability to act?
That sound you hear is Republican lawmakers who aren't resigning preparing to step up and say with deep honor and patriotism that they didn't have a chance to see the press conference but find the reports troubling now I must focus on the needs of my constituents.

I wonder how many milliseconds Trump listened to the briefing about the foreign attack on our election before saying, "just be sure to say it didn't effect the outcome," wave them off, and look back down at his phone.
"America First. I love America. Make America Great Again."		"This foreign leader attacked America."		"Actually he's good."
It's raining witches.
"Mr. President, our principle adversary conducted an attack against our elections, interfering in our election at all levels, which is still ongoing."		"What is Luxembourg's NATO tab? Are those fuckers current?"
