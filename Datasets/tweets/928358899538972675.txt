@JollyRo53274551 @thejmills @CongressmanHice @GOPoversight That's rich coming from a guy that loves to spew anger and hate. Well done sir, well done!
@JollyRo53274551 @charliekirk11 Yeah, you showed your level of intelligence.. Nothing that I have said suggest that I'm a democrat or a socialist. I've even stated the opposite. You simply appear to want to express anger.  Good luck with you anger management and finding gainful employment!
@Abigail4561805 @charliekirk11 Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Come work in the real world and you'll see how wrong you are.
@JollyRo53274551 @charliekirk11 I suspect that I am more conservative than you. About 90% of Charlie's supporters are Trump Zealots that are RINO.
@JC20204 @WhiteHouse This thread started with my comment on a "sponsor banner" that listed the NRA. You stated that I don't know how politics work.		Regardless of whether you believe in [INSERT COMPANY NAME}'s agenda, that shouldn't sway your opinion whether they should have influence or not.
@Abigail4561805 @charliekirk11 If your wages are equal to your male peers, congrats! You are one of the few. I've been a male executive for decades and I can prove that the gap exist. If your truly believe that women make as much as men, there isn't much I can do to convince you other than to show you payroll.
@Jim_Jordan Dude, you were great on SNL!!!!
@JollyRo53274551 @charliekirk11 I am a republican. I have been for 33 years.
@Abigail4561805 @charliekirk11 I didn't say that the Google pay gap was wrong. But one data point does not make a trend. Just like a True Trumpian, you seize on one data point and declare that is the only data point that matters. Well done Trump Zealot! Well done!	#TrumpZealot #WomanHater #Bigot #Trumo
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Hate comes from all sides (Trump said so himself). The press leans left...and right. "Almost every hate crime has come from the Left" is fiction. Xenophobic isn't about controlling who is admitted into our country.		This goes back to the Trump lies. You believe everything he says
@charliekirk11 Wow. Just, wow. I think this is the most idiotic thing that I've ever heard you say. And you've said some stupid things!!!	#Wages #WageGap #genderwagegap #CharlieIsAnIdiot
@JC20204 @WhiteHouse I'm not anti gun. But the NRA does influence policy. If you don't believe that, then you are an idiot.

@JC20204 @WhiteHouse I don't disagree with you. Why are you calling me out for pointing out one of the guilty parties? There weren't any banking, oil, etc on the board or I would have called them out too.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse And again....you won't answer the question. I guess the question makes you nervous!
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Inspiring people to hate the other side, incite violence, to be xenophobic, to be racist, to attack the free press, is not leadership.
@JC20204 @WhiteHouse According to your comment, you believe that big business can buy their way into political power. Otherwise, you totally misunderstood my comment. Which is it?
@JC20204 @WhiteHouse I seem to understand how you think politics work....
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Nothing that I have said has anything to do with the election. 		Tell me exactly what Trump has done to make those things happen?
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You did answer the question.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I agree with you

@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I accept the election. I didn't vote for Clinton (neither of them). 		So, if it is proven that Trump violated the constitution, then you'll defend the constitutions and denounce Trump for the offense???
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Sure, because it is fine for an American President to lie to the people and spread propaganda. And there is little evidence that anything Trump has done has greatly helped this country. Not the economy, taxes, healthcare or anything else. But keep being a traitor all you want!!!
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I'm standing up for my country. I wish I could say you are doing the same.		Just like our founding fathers, I'm willing to debate facts and policy.		You are just a typical Trumpian. You switch the argument when you are losing. You don't want to debate facts. You just want to hate
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You are the one that started this. You challenged me to "start a thread of all the lies and misrepresentations from just that one speech"		But just like Trump, you don't want to discuss facts. You switch to another argument.

@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse He falsely claimed “you couldn’t fire anybody in the V.A.” before he took office. (He signed a law that would make it easier to remove bad employees, but the department had been able to fire people before.)
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse He falsely claimed just 3 percent of detained unauthorized immigrants “come back for a trial.” (About 72 percent showed up in the 2017 fiscal year.)
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse He falsely claimed military spending had reached levels “nobody’s ever heard of.” (Congress authorized more money for the military several years under President Barack Obama.)
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse He exaggerated the United States’ annual trade deficit with the rest of the world as $800 billion.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse "I flew to Iraq - the first time I left the White House, because I stayed at the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places."		Trump actually left the White House plenty of times.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse "We are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice so they can now go see a doctor. Now they can go see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks."		Veterans still must wait for weeks.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse On the Choice program for veterans: "I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved for our veterans."		Congress approved the private-sector Veterans Choice health program in 2014 and President Barack Obama signed it into law.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse We've lost so much money with China — $500 billion a year."		He's off by several hundred billion dollars on the trade deficit with China.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse "Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired."		Democrats did not universally - or even broadly - call for Comey to be fired despite their anger over his decision to go public before Election Day with news that the FBI had renewed its investigation of Clinton's emails.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse In his discussion of the diversity visa lottery program, he claimed "They send us the people they don't want."		"They," meaning other countries, do not select citizens for the U.S. program. They must meet education or skills benchmarks to apply.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Trump misstated his winning margin in the election.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Trump got the unemployment rate wrong.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Trump claimed that one of the lawyers on Mueller's team has been involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it.		This is false. No one on Mueller's team ever ran the Clinton Foundation.
@ClarkKe95563197 @ThatMustacheMan @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse HAHAHAHAHA!! "Filled with truth." Do you want me to start a thread of all the lies and misrepresentations from just that one speech? I'd be happy oblige you!	#TrumpZealot #TribeMentality

@NaylorWeeks @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump You are incorrect. Cohen's testimony was scheduled before Trump announced the dates for the summit.
@boondockDblm @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Ask Huckabutt. He'll tell you all about it.
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump The "clownshow" was scheduled before the Korea meeting were scheduled. Your father chose to hold the Korea talks the same week as Cohen's testimony. Why would Trump do that? Perhaps as a distraction?	#EricTrumpIsAnIdiot #Trump #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief

@Joy_Villa @realDonaldTrump Actually, most Americans don't support the wall. Look at the polls and data. Just because you support the wall, please don't speak for the rest of us.
@Joy_Villa I don't mind that you express your political views. That is what America is about! However, if you listened to the truth, then you would know that extending the border wall won't reduce crime and it won't reduce the flow of drugs because those enter through ports of entry. #Truth
@Highkingskid @charliekirk11 "Stupid" is not understanding that Fentanyl comes through ports of entry. "Stupid" is thinking that a wall will reduce the flow of drugs coming through ports of entry. "Stupid" is believing the lies that Charlie spews every day. Are you "stupid?"
@charliekirk11 Fact:		Fentanyl crosses the border through ports of entry. The wall will not help stop the flow of Fentanyl.		How many more Americans have to listen to Charlie spew propaganda and misleading rhetoric before we label him a liar and zealot?		#CharlieIsAnIdiot #TrumpZealot #Liar

@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump You responded to my tweet about Trump not standing up for our residences. You then proceeded to justify the Saudi's actions (murder) because the man was bad and evil. That isn't my narrative. They were your words and your narrative. Disagreeing with you doesn't make me liberal.
@E3P0322 Agreed! Convince the politicians to focus on the whole solution and I'll be happy! :-)
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Just like a true Trumpian, when confronted with the truth you switch the subject to something else and attack that. You were the one saying that we should cozy up to Saudi Arabia, You are the one that said killing someone is okay as long as you declare them "bad" or "evil." #Bot
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Just because I don't like Trump, doesn't mean I'm not conservative. Trump isn't a conservative. He's an opportunist. But regardless, you clearly aren't concerned about  the people here legally. You are a selfish citizen that only cares about your own self-interest. Or just a bot.
@E3P0322 Things have become so polarized that people are missing that point. Everyone wants more border security (reps &amp; dems). The argument isn't "should we spend money" but "where to spend money." Both sides have been telling Trump this but now everyone has dug in and stopped talking ☹️
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Exactly! You claim to be for America but you clearly don't want to protect the people the LEGALLY live here. You make the rest of us conservatives look bad. You're probably one of those progressive bots that was created within the last 6 months to troll twitter. Nice job bot!
@E3P0322 If you can spend the same money and save more than 1 life, it's not only worth it but way better.
@E3P0322 I'm not a liberal and I'm not against more barriers. We need more fencing/walls. We just don't need $5.7B worth of walls without the other things . We need better/more technology, tools and processes at ports of entry where most of the drugs and contraband enter our country.

@E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump Global warming and climate change are two different concepts. Calling them the same thing is like saying the Red Sox and the Yankees are the same team.
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump First, I'm a republican. Nothing I have said is left wing at all. And I didn't twist your words. But I do understand them. You said that murder is okay because he "was an evil guy", "he wasn’t a very good guy" and "he was just a US resident." Of course that justifies murder!

@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Has nothing to do with sympathy. Whether he was great or not isn't the issue (and who are you to judge?). The fact that you believe it is okay to murder US residences is truly disturbing. You suggest that murdering someone is fine as long as they are someone you don't like. Wow.

@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Wow. You just said that it is okay to murder a US resident as long as you don't like them. You fit right in with Stalin, Mao, Kim Jong-il, Pol Pot, Bashar al-Assad and Hussein. Welcome to the club.

@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I'm not offended because someone told me to be offended (unlike you). I'm offended because he was a US resident that was murdered by a foreign government. Everyone should be offended by that.
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because someone told you he was in bed with evil guys. You'll believe anything.
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I agree that we should condemn any country that kills US citizens. Why isn't @realDonaldTrump doing this? And you are saying it is okay to kill a US resident as long as they aren't "a very good guy?" Wow.
@Sherry27557249 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I think you mean "wouldn't." And I agree with you. Part of talking with them is to openly condemn them (communicate to them face-to-face) for killing a journalist that is US resident.

Ronald Reagan would beg you to stop calling yourself "Sons of Reagan." He doesn't want morons as sons.
@JerryDunleavy I'm a republican and that sounds like a pretty good answer to me. What did you expect her to say? You want her to lie, to say that women hate Jewish people?
@realDonaldTrump "I will never, ever let you down." You have let me down every day that you have been in office!!!!	#Egomaniac #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief #Loser #FakePresident #Trump

@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump As always??? Trump is proven wrong WAY more than he is proven right. You should go get that head looked at!!!
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton Again, you have nothing intelligent to add! All you know how to do is post memes. Even Ronald Reagan, as nice as he was, would have called you a twitter troll with a low IQ.
@AnnCoulter Perhaps you should stand against Trump and make sure that he is voted out of office!
@realDonaldTrump I thought you said 3:00 pm??? Forget to tell time?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Perhaps if 90% of what Trump said were true then you'd get more positive coverage. Don't shoot the messenger. Don't blame others when its your fault. It is clear that you have a bias, how could you not with your daughter working there. But don't spew your BS here!!! #Huckabutt
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton Again, you have nothing intelligent to add. You've wrapped your entire identity around political ideology. Spewing hashtags and posting a picture of your idols just proves your tribal mentality and zealotry. Again, Ronald Reagan would have been ashamed of you!
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton At least I met him which is more than you can say. And of course you have nothing intelligent to say. You just spew a bunch of hash tags and call me names. I'd bet large sums of cash that I'm more conservative than you are! You are just an old zealot hiding behind twitter.
@EricManns6 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I'm open to suggestions. Charlie and Trump need a lot of help! Anything that we can do to educate and help them in stopping to saying stupid things will greatly help our country. We should definitely take away Trumps's phone...he dribbles more nonsense on twitter than anyone!
@EricManns6 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Me either. What can we do to help Charlie and Trump to stop being ignorant and to atop saying stupid things?
@MatthewJshow @charliekirk11 The American people disagree with you. None of the previous 12 presidents remained BELOW 50% approval ratings for the ENTIRE FIRST TWO YEARS in office! https://t.co/LIcfXUo56i
@charliekirk11 That's because @realDonaldTrump can't actively rob people as easily from the White House. Don't get me wrong, he is robbing people, just not at his typical pace!	#CharlieKirkIsAnIdiot
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton The early reports cited the explosion and deaths. At first, they didn't know the cause. Later they determined that thieves caused it and reported that. Of course your only method of conversation is to call people names. I met Reagan in 1985 and he'd be very disappointed in you!
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton I didn't blame anyone. I simply pointed out that you are more concerned about the media covering dead Mexicans instead of pirates. Which is fine, it just shows us your priorities.
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN So now you have the "Huckabutt Variety Show???" 	#Huckabut #Loser
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton Yeah, because conservatives are supposed to care about all life (right to life) but some of us (and I'm a conservative) only want to beat the tribal drum when it is convenient. They don't think all life is important and they make snarky comments about the media to feed their egos
@SonsOfReaganAlt @TomFitton Yeah, because pirates are WAY more important than dead people.
@GovMikeHuckabee Huckabutt, you shouldn't feel any better about your post-political jobs. At least President Bush demonstrates acts of kindness. The only thing you do is insult people and tear them down. You are a disgrace to your family, your party and your country. #Huckabutt #Loser

@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO When someone belongs to a group (reps, dems, etc) and promotes another member of the same group simply because they belong to the group, it is called tribal mentality.

I'm a conservative that thinks we can put that money to better use with a better outcome. New walls don't really do much
@AlbertanPatriot @charliekirk11 1) People that voted for him didn't necessarily agree with everything he proposed, so you can't say every Trump vote was for the wall. 2) More people voted against Trump than for him,  so it isn't the will of the majority (BTW, I didn't vote for the other candidate)
@AlbertanPatriot @charliekirk11 1) Campaign promises aren't guaranteed. Like "read my lips.. No new taxes." 2) He promised that Mexico would pay for it, and NAFTA 2.0 will not generate enough tax revenue to pay for it....plus it hasn't been approved yet. 3) No supporting stats means that it is not true.
@AlbertanPatriot @charliekirk11 Walls do help when installed in the proper place and combined with other measures. No doubt. But we have walls. Give me the statistics (and source) of the percent reduction in illegal immigration, drugs and crime that additional sections of a wall will provide.

@AlbertanPatriot @charliekirk11 I'm a republican. All the evidence, studies and data suggest that building additional walls will be of little use to limit illegal immigration, drugs or crime.

@beckyhart58 @GOP @VP Here is a simple example. On Dec 30 Trump tweeted "President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound." He said this to sway public opinion for the wall. But it is not true, there isn't a 10 foot wall around their DC house.
@beckyhart58 @riotwomennn @Acosta @realDonaldTrump My comment had nothing to do with whether he won or not. He did win, that is a fact. But your statement about the math was false and I was simply pointing out that you were incorrect.
@realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be blasting Republicans for the same thing???	https://t.co/FmkRTzWijn
@beckyhart58 @riotwomennn @Acosta I'm a republican but your math is flawed. Trump did not win the majority, he won the electoral college. Thus your logic is flawed when you conclude that the majority of Americans want a wall because they voted for @realDonaldTrump
@WhiteHouse Your statement assumes that building a wall is the best way to secure the border. I don't think anyone disagrees that the border needs to be secure and that we need to spend money to do it. But a wall isn't the best use of our tax dollars (and isn't Mexico paying for the wall???)
@Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump I didn't say there was collusion. The purpose of the investigation is to make that determination. Anyone making up their mind (before the findings are public) has a bias one way or the other. My tweet was about Trump distracting from the investigation, which I think is fair.
@realDonaldTrump Great distraction from the Russia investigation. Well played Mr Trump, well played!	#Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief #Trump #Russia #Traitor #EgoManiac
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I'm a republican and your analysis is a bit one-sided. Which is expected from the sheep. Tribal mentality at its best! You make the rest of us conservatives look bad. #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@WeAreOne_Q Track to recovery. What kind of sicko makes fun of an old lady's health? Answer, you. #QANonIsAnIdiot #Loser
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Exactly! Nothing can stop what is about to happen to #Trump!
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Yes patriots! Buy this guys t-shirts so he can make a little money from the sheep! This is a genius idea. Although QAnon is an idiot, this guy wins an entrepreneur award!
@realDonaldTrump You promised a wall that Mexico will pay for, not the American people! #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief #BorderWallFunding #BorderWall #Immigration
@CalebFinigan @realDonaldTrump The border patrol can barely keep up monitoring the fence we have today (and in many cases they can't because they are understaffed). If we add hundreds of miles of new fence, we will not have the man power to monitor all of it. There is no new funding for more people.
@GOP @GOPLeader Hmmm, @realDonaldTrump went on national TV and bragged about shutting down the government! And he said that he would take the blame. You guys lie more than any group of humans that has ever lived!!! #TrumpShutdown #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief
@realDonaldTrump And here is what will happen to that steel fence https://t.co/BDjaUCviIu
@Nyc4Ed @Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump Wow, dude. Way to jump into a conversation and start hurling insults. Do you want to join the discussion or just get your jollies making personal attacks?
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Possible, but I haven't heard about that one yet.
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump I strongly agree!!!! I just wish I knew how to fix it.
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump Yep!!! And I'm enjoying it.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Hmmm....not sure that is an option here. But I'll look into it!
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump But if voters are making decisions based on the information the receive, how do we ensure that voters are receiving factual information vs. propaganda?
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump Oh, I don't disagree. I'm just saying that I think he ran more because of his ego and less because he is benevolent :-)
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Agreed, that's not cool,
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Amen!!!
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump I'm beginning to lean that way....register as an independent.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump In all fairness, I think he dishes out as much as he gets. Most attacks on Trump aren't personal, they are attacks on his actions and ideas...that is fair. As far as why he ran for president....who knows. Everyone has a different opinion. Given his history, I suspect it is ego
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Eh, I'm a republican and I can't say that 99.9% is the left :-) Question: Actions and facts do matter, so how would you ensure that the American people are getting accurate information to make informed decisions? Who polices the politicians and media? (This isn't a trick)
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump I would shift that narrative a bit. Mostly, they are attacking Trump (or his families) for actions, behavior, deeds and ideas. Those are fair game. What is not fair game is personal attacks on Trump &amp; Family (he's fat, she's ugly, he's dumb, she's stupid, etc.).
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Oh, I do appreciate the humor. A good zinger every now and then makes me chuckle. That is what the correspondents dinner used to be about. Every politician should have thick skin. However, there is a fine line between being funny and being mean, especially with your colleagues.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Anyone (on either side) that behaves that way is doing more harm than good.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Agreed. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive to have a civil discourse to resolve issues. America is a melting pot of ideas/beliefs and I don't always agree with others. But I shouldn't verbally attack someone just because we disagree.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump Using nicknames in jest or gentle ribbing is fine. But using them to dehumanize others or to inflict pain unnecessarily is not okay. We should attack ideas, not people. Example: I should challenge your ideas and beliefs, not attack you because your ideas are different than mine.
@krassenstein @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm surprised that he didn't say "walls and cages work"...
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 @realDonaldTrump I agree: "just because someone says something that is hard to hear doesn’t make him a dick or doesn’t make it a lie."	However, it his important how things are said and how one behaves. It is this that makes DJT a dick (from my definition above).
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 @realDonaldTrump I agree that the media can portray anyone in whatever persona they choose. I judge Mr Trump by his words and actions. I try not to judge anyone by the words of someone else (including the media).
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 From a dictionary: "being rude, selfish, arrogant, or unpleasant." There are plenty of examples of @realDonaldTrump exhibiting each.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 Its not hatred as much as annoyance. I think Trump would get a lot more done if he just wasn't such a d!ck about it. I need to sign off. The banter has been fun. Thank you. I hope the rest of your day goes well.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 Why thank you. I hope you aren't taking this whole thing too seriously. I hope we are just having fun. I seriously mean you no harm or ill will.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 Wow! And you couldn't look up Trumpian using google. You are a slow learner!
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 And he starts with the insults all over again!!! This guy is so predictable. It almost makes him adorable. I'll start calling you my little adorable Trumpian.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 It is a good thing that you don't claim to be a "keyboard warrior." I had to teach you how to use the internet after all. As for points, I know you don't need them, but I'm a generous guy so I don't mind giving you a few.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 True that	https://t.co/AH0WKdZmHp
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 At least you are mature enough to admit it!! I'm glad to help.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 I never said that I was trying to insult you, just define you. The fact that you assumed it was an insult enforces that likelihood that you are one!
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 That's not the case (my industry will most likely profit), but I'll give you points for making a logical argument and assumption! Someone losing money because of the wall may certainly be against it.
@E3P0322 @Mattsmith1776 Ok Trumpian
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Jezz...not only do I have to teach you how to use the internet but I have to teach to read as well???
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 Okay Luddite.
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 Ha! No. There is no need to go into specifics, but I work in an industry that provides tools specifically designed to combat illegal immigration.
@Mattsmith1776 @E3P0322 You are correct. I don't work "in" immigration.
@charliekirk11 Just because someone belongs to another race (other than white) doesn't mean that they can't be racist. Is this really how you think?  You are a moron. 	#CharlieKirkIsAnIdiot #Loser #EgoManiac #BorderSecurity #Immigration
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 And I was right!!! Congratulations on being the most typical, predictable Trumpian I've seen in a while. Since you obviously don't know how to use Google, I've included a link to a definition. You can go to https://t.co/oV6kMJQvcI for more references.	https://t.co/9i3Qv82xmJ
@jennife38666052 @E3P0322 @charliekirk11 I don;t think anyone is arguing for illegal immigration. I agree with you. The debate is determining the most effective tools and policies to prohibit illegal immigration.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 And again you go! You can't help yourself. The Trumpian is strong in this one! I predict that you'll respond with another meme and include the word douche, chief or some other derogatory term. Let's see how much of that I get right!!!
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps you should follow your own advice!!!	https://t.co/MPORQhpftc

@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 See,,,there you go....more insults. Keep going dude...you are proving my point and making this too easy!!! Typical Trumpian!
@realDonaldTrump I agree! You should stop holding American people hostage and open the government! Americans want border security but your wall is just a phallic symbol of your manhood. Most Americans think that your wall is a stupid idea. #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief #EgoManiac #BorderWall
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Like I said, all you want to do is hurl insults. Well done Trumpian, well done!
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That's probably true. Both sides have a team (tribe) mentality...."I want my team to win."  It's like a sports team....when the penalty is against you, the knee-jerk reaction is "we didn't do it" and when the penalty is against the other team it is "of course they did it!"
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Saying that "I would roll over and die" is an insult. Calling me "Chief" is an insult. And like I said, I've done more to fight illegal immigration than you'll ever do. It's my job. So go out there and do something instead of tweeting from your bedroom while watching cable news.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 I've been fighting illegal immigration my whole life, probably a lot more than you. What have you done other than post insults on tweeter? Exactly, NOTHING!!!
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Some do, but not "most" as I stated in my tweet.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump 1) Most democrats don't want him impeached and 2) @realDonaldTrump didn't do anything that resulted in those achievements.
@dbongino New Poll: @realDonaldTrump approval ratings continues to decline!!! https://t.co/XbUhBe6FvB
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I agree that if they voted for it in the past,  they should vote for it now (they are doing the same thing to republicans with the budget resolutions). I've appreciated our civil conversation. I wish more twitter threads were this thoughtful! I'm signing off. Have a good night.
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Again, I'm for border security. I believe the democrats previously voted to improve our existing infrastructure (border walls/fences). But I believe they would vote for a $5.7 billion package if it contained meaningful solutions to our border security and immigration issues.
@CalebFinigan @GOP @VP I'm a republican and a conservative, but the statement that he has "pushed for many great things in America" is open to interpretation :-)
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I agree that we need to solve the illegal immigration problem. But A wall won't prevent someone in a remote location from circumventing the wall. Israel's wall is not 100% effective (as you claimed in your previous tweet) and is different because it is mostly in populated areas.
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Your statement that "a wall 100% effective proven through out history" is inaccurate. From the Great Wall to the European walls of the 20th century, they all failed to prevent invaders. No one wants to diminish border security, but a wall causes more problems and cost too much.
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I have no problem replacing existing walls/fences with metal structures. It's may be a good idea. But there are better technology solutions that are cheaper and more effective for remote locations (and for some existing wall/fence locations). We need the right tools for the job.
@Goss30Goss Donald knows a lot about concrete walls!!!	https://t.co/eErpoIHx2v
@CalebFinigan @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I prefer a concrete wall just like @realDonaldTrump suggests in this video	https://t.co/eErpoIHx2v
@Extraneous_T @Bornabrit1 @realDonaldTrump Yeah....you are correct and perhaps I spoke too soon!!!!
@charliekirk11 According to @realDonaldTrump they already have one because it is mostly built. So what does this poll mean???
@Bornabrit1 I'm still waiting for his "Art of the Deal" skills!!! Oh yeah....his idea of negotiating is to declare bankruptcy....not really an option here.

@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 There are many better options for $5.7 billion. You statement is like going to the wine shop and saying "it is a $5,000 bottle of wine...we should at least try it!"
@RealJamesWoods Sounds walls work.,..they block the sound. Border walls kind-of work sometimes...people crawl over or tunnel under. Sound can't do that because it isn't a living thing. So your comparison is not really the same thing.

@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 This is my last response. All you want to do is say the same thing over and over. I got it. You want a wall and nothing will convince you otherwise. Get Mexico to pay for it and you can have your wall! Enjoy!
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 You proposed two solutions that don't address the source of most illegals. I believe there are many things that we can (and should do) to stop illegal immigrates. I don;t want illegals here any more than you do. But a wall or gun towers won't stop the source of most illegals.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Walls don't stop people that never see the wall.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 That is actually a more effective solution to stop illegals that cross the southern border. I'd vote for that before a wall. The problem is that most illegals don't cross the southern border by land, so even guard towers won't stop most illegals because they'll never see them.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 You said this was nonsensical: "Since 2007, most illegal immigrates don't cross the southern border." Prove me wrong!
@realDonaldTrump @jairbolsonaro While you praise foreign leaders, a US citizen was arrested in Russia. Why aren't you tweeting about that??? #Loser #Trump #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Why is it nonsensical? Provide evidence to the contrary.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Most illegals don;t cross the southern border. A wall won;t stop them because they won't have to climb over it or under. They will never see the wall.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 I don;t think you read my tweet. I can tell because most illegal aliens don't cross the southern border.

@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 See my other response. Most illegals don't cross the southern border, so a wall doesn't stop them. Also, all you need is a ladder or a shovel and you can circumvent a wall.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Since 2007, most illegal immigrates don't cross the southern border. So even if a wall stopped 100% of illegals crossing, it  still wouldn't have a major impact on the number of illegals. I want to stop illegals too, its just that a wall doesn't really help.

@DancrDave @MailOnline Yeah, Trump always tells the truth and of course you believe him! Bought any land or bridges lately?
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 It depends on what you want the walls to do. If you want a wall to stop illegal immigration, stop illegal drug imports, stop crime or stop terrorism, then a wall will not do those things.
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 China's wall was built when people could only travel on foot (the US has more illegals entering via airports than through border crossings). But regardless, other countries make their own decisions. Why should we tell them what to do???
@E3P0322 @jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Well, that is the whole debate :-) I think the cons outweigh the pros. I don't really care about the politics (dem vs rep) so my opinion isn't driven by the left or right (I'm actually a republican) but rather by evidence and science.
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm, you went on national TV and bragged about shutting down the government! And you said you would take the blame. You lie more than any human that has ever lived!!! #TrumpShutdown #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief

@jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 I never said anything about cages. I also never said that illegals shouldn't be arrested and locked up.
@jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Exactly. That is what we have today.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews https://t.co/InLDokIitZ
@jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 I don't believe your point of view and I'll never change your mind. So if you can find a way to pay for the wall without ME having to pay for it (and Mexico isn't currently doing anything that pays for it), then go build your wall.
@jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Exactly. You install locks on entrances {ports of entry]. You have windows which are less protected [open land] that can be accessed. But you don't install bars [the wall] on all your windows because of the cost and problems it causes. Its just not worth the money,
@jennife38666052 @charliekirk11 Those illegals wouldn't have been able to enter the US anyway. So it wouldn't have cost Americans any more than its costing us now. Mexico may be paying for their food, but they aren't saving the US money. So no, they aren't paying for the wall by providing illegals sustenance.
@charliekirk11 Exactly. You put locks on doors at entrances [ports of entry]. You have glass windows [open land] which aren't typical entrances but they can easily give way to a brick [someone hiking through the desert]. It's not worth costs or problems to put iron bars [wall] on your windows.
@charliekirk11 Go raise $25B for your wall without taxpayers paying a cent (it should be easy because #Trump said Mexico will pay for it) and you can build your wall which won't solve any problems (but actually create more problems). #Loser #CharlieKirkIsAnIdiot
@DancrDave @charliekirk11 I said those things about Charlie Kirk. I said ONE person is racist. How does that translate to me saying that 63 million people are racist???

@logancy87 @Boar250624 @alsagertree @RaychelTania @realDonaldTrump And more: "Mongols overthrew the Jin Dynasty, took control of northern China and soon wiped out all other Chinese dynasties as well. By the year 1271, the Mongol Kublai Khan declared the creation of the Yuan Dynasty, which ruled with a heavy hand over the Chinese until 1368."
@logancy87 @Boar250624 @alsagertree @RaychelTania @realDonaldTrump Since you can't read, here is a quote from the article: "the failure of the Great Wall of China is rather spectacular. It worked as a manifestation of power that put fear into the hearts of barbarian riders but it didn’t keep any invaders from the north out."
@Boar250624 @alsagertree @RaychelTania @realDonaldTrump Agreed, but a wall that someone can simply climb over or dig under (out in the middle of nowhere) isn't going to fix the problem.
@logancy87 @Boar250624 @alsagertree @RaychelTania @realDonaldTrump Dude, I'm a republican and a capitalist (an entrepreneur).

@OfficeOfMike It's not about which act is worse. Neither should happen, and if both did happen, then BOTH culprits should be held accountable if they violated a law. Your post is an attempt to justify what #realDonaldTrump has done. But you are admitting that he is guilty. Why does he get off?

@ANDY72403580 The payments to women were intended to influence the campaign, and thereby constituted violations of campaign finance law. They have not formally charged Trump with this crime - it was a sentencing report for Cohen, not Trump - but this is the U.S. DOJ calling Trump a criminal.
@ANDY72403580 That doesn't make it illegal (it isn't a crime to receive bad information and investigate it...that happens in law enforcement all the time) but it does make the FBI look incompetent. If they arrested someone based on false information (and knew it), that would be a crime.
@realDonaldTrump Evidence does not need to be present to start an investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to discover the truth and find evidence if any exists. So no, it wasn't illegal. Why must you lie EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief

@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Show me a quote from Trump where he said he reduced the money because of corruption. I've searched. It doesn't exist.
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You did say that, AND YOU ARE F'N WRONG  BECAUSE NO ONE HAS SAID THAT. YOU JUST MADE IT UP BECAUSE YOU ARE AN IDIOT THAT CAN'T READ.
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The research says otherwise. You will gravitate toward whatever information supports your racist views.
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump According to Trump, black unemployment numbers are at a record low (5.9 percent). Either your guy is wrong, or Trump is. Which is it?
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You keep saying the article said something that it did not say. The article DID NOT SAY THAT $8 MILLION OF RELIEF MONEY DISAPPEARED. The article DID NOT SAY THAT TRUMP STOPPED AID BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION. I give up....you are an idiot that cannot read. Moron.
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I agree this is something that we (every country) needs to work out. The environment is important. However, again, this wasn't the topic of conversation. We were discussing the made-up information that you presented about illegal immigration.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Shouldn't you be doing something more important, like, I don't know...perhaps attending the G20 summit??? #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Ha! You showed me the crap that you made up and that you have no evidence to back it up. Worse, you attempted to twist news articles to support your incorrect conclusions. Go back to Fox News. It is time for your feeding!
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I'm just reading what you sent. CIS has been linked to many hate groups and some people there are affiliated with racist/bigots. Again, you are a racist. I get it. I really don't care. You started this conversation. I'm moving on. I have better things to do than entertain a bigot
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don;t know him and I have no reason to think is isn't credible. What does Peter Kirsanow have to do with anything?
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with the thread. But I don't doubt that immigration does have some negatives, and this is likely one of them. However, again, this article is about all immigration, not illegal immigration which was the topic of this thread.
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump A couple of things. 1) CIS maintains ties to hate groups. 2) Vernon Briggs works with holocaust deniers 3) he is a bigot 4) here is more food for thought. But you will hold your racist views no matter what I say. Don't bother replying. Have a good weekend!	https://t.co/QzniUXMBeh
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You didn't have your facts straight about the corruption (you incorrectly stated $8 million of relief money went missing) and you don't have your facts straight about aid relief reductions. Prove me wrong, find a quote from Trump or the government supporting your point of view.
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It is true that several people embezzled and got busted. However the money that was taken was over a three year period and didn't include much (if any) of the relief money. And it is not true that Trump stopped further aid because of government corruption. Get your facts straight
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Universities aren't the only sources of research and information. There are other credible sources. But I suspect it is easier for you to hate than it is to learn and be a better person.
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews That is true that two employees from Toa Baja embezzled and got busted. Which does suck. What is not true is that Trump refused to give them money based on this embezzlement. I'm only giving you a hard time because you made a generalization about the money that isn't really true.
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The article that you provided does not say that. No where in that article does it say that money disappeared, that the Puerto Rico government is suspected of being corrupt, or that Trump refused to send money because of corruption. Provide something that corroborates your tweet.
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Again, that does not provide evidence to your claim (restated here): ""their government is corrupt and just took the money and asked for more so trump said no because all that’s gonna happen is that it will be taken again."" Provide evidence of the corruption &amp; Trump;s response
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews For pointing out that your article doesn't back up your claim of a corrupt Puerto Rico government. You are absolutely welcome to allow me to point out your bias toward other Americans!
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The article doesn't say anything about your claim: "their government is corrupt and just took the money and asked for more so trump said no because all that’s gonna happen is that it will be taken again." Again, find a source to back up your claim!
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump Then it should be easy for you to find! And it your only source is @FoxNews then I'll understand why you think this is true.
@CLight1 @realDonaldTrump Ahhh, so the US Government selects and chooses which citizens it will help based on whether it likes them or not??? I see why you are a Trumpian!
@Steeler89733412 @realDonaldTrump That simply isn't true. Cite your sources.

@trumpp_j @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Calling it an "invasion" is spin. By using that word, you conjure up images of force and violence because the first definition of "invasion" is "an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force." That does not accurately describe the current caravan of immigrates.
@j_jrohde @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump There are a number of illegal immigrates in the USA, that is true. But from 2007 to now, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in the United States after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the Mexican border. They came here legally.

@timmyanton @Anthony63214249 @WeAreOne_Q Well, Mexico hasn't let them in. It'll be hard to stay in Mexico if they are never there. You thought they were Mexicans because you are a racist bigot.

"He was on a good show, I won't mention the name of the show, recently, and he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump's very, very large brain." @realDonaldTrump The president of the US actually said those words. #Loser #IdiotInChief

@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump Yeah, students should see how other countries laugh at us when we brag about all the things that we have done...they laugh because they know that we haven't done squat. They know that we've actually done more harm than good and that @realDonaldTrump is a #Loser

@Whodis37373318 @syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump People should be held accountable for Benghazi. I never stated otherwise. I agree with you that both sides have issues. Watching the whole Kavanaugh circus should convince anyone of that! The point I was making is that not all news is fake news. And certainly not 80% is fake.
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Trump did call the free press the enemy of the people and I proved it. You are just too stupid to follow logic. What are are you, 5 years old? Just like @realDonaldTrump, you are spreading lies and misinformation. You are the fake news.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Wow. Fair and balanced. I'm glad that you don't take political stance and then report a biased opinion instead of real news. On wait, you are on @FoxNews. That is exactly what you do. Every. Single. Day. You are doing exactly what @realDonaldTrump calls "Fake News."

This is an amazing analysis of Russian Interference that helped @realDonaldTrump! "Stepping back to view the timeline from beginning to end reveals how these parallel threads — contacts, hacking and social media fraud — often crossed during the election." https://t.co/CkkThIEq8w
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump If you need the source of Trump calling 80% of the media "fake" then here it is on the Fox News website: https://t.co/0H0Jy4zVnq
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Again. Although not everything is always accurate, the inaccuracies are not 80% as Trump claims. Trump mislabels most legitimate free press publishers as fake news. So when he calls "fake news" the enemy of the people, he is calling free press publishers the enemy of the people.
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump You asked me to prove it and I did. But instead of arguing the proof, you just want to shout and call people names with no basis. BTW, that is what fascist and zealots do. How about arguing against the logic of my proof? Or is that beyond your capability? Guess you are just a kid

@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Trump claims 80% is fake news (see the quote below). Since he says fake news is the enemy of the people, you must prove that 80% is fake in order for the claim NOT to include free press. PROVE IT!!!!!
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump "The fake news is comprised of — it’s a lot. It’s a big chunk, okay? Somebody said, ‘What’s the chunk?’ I said, ‘80 percent.’" @realDonaldTrump on August 22, 2018
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Although not everything is always 100% accurate, the inaccuracies are not 80% as Trump claims.

@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Just because the press is critical of Trump or points out his lies, misleading statements or misinformation does not make it "Fake News." I don't believe everything I read. But #realDonaldTrump is on record as saying 80% if the press is fake and that is absurd. You are a Zealot!
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump "Free Press: a body of book publishers, news media, etc., not controlled or restricted by government censorship in political or ideological matters." That covers 100% of the media in the US. Calling any of them the "enemy" is calling the free press the enemy.

You are a zealot.

@MsMuckenfuss @realDonaldTrump One thing that I've noticed about Trump supporters is they adopt his method of argument. He is either attacking or embracing. Everything has to be 100% for or 100% against. There is no middle ground. I do appreciate some things the president has done. Others things not so much.
@MsMuckenfuss Well, people are fighting for their lives and as you said, that is most important. How about focusing your energy there until that fight is over.
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I don't care who agrees with me. This is a free country and if a democrat, republican, black, white, Jew, Christian, Muslim or anyone else "likes" my viewpoint, then that is called "common ground." Of course you Trump zealots wouldn't know anything about that.
@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Just like @realDonaldTrump, you label anyone that doesn't agree with you a "leftist." You won't argue the points. It is easier to label them (and incorrectly in this case) and then dismiss the group.

@MsMuckenfuss @realDonaldTrump All he could talk about today was the conspiracy against him, no collusion and meeting a senator from Michigan.
@MsMuckenfuss @realDonaldTrump Oh, he mentioned it a lot the preceding days because he got blasted for Maria (and I rode out Irma in PR the week before so I know what it was like). Today, every other public figure expressed their concern for the Carolina's. All @realDonaldTrump could do was tweet about himself

@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Plus, he is a horrible human. He has sent 5 tweets this morning. Not one is about the deaths from Florence or the people in the Carolina's struggling to survive. Every tweet is about him....about conspiracies against him...about how great he is...about things that aren't true.
@realDonaldTrump Wow. Again, your first tweet of the day isn't about the people killed by Florence or the people snugging to survive in the Carolina's. It is a self-serving tweet about your competition with President Obama. You truly are a despicable person. #Loser #IdiotInChief #LiarInChief

@syntec1000 @MsMuckenfuss @Whodis37373318 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I'm a republican and I didn't vote for Obama, Why does everyone automatically assume that you are a liberal if you don't agree with @realDonaldTrump?

@Brisco49647973 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Exactly. And that also means that the US must behave legally and honor international law regarding immigrates and refugees, We can't pick and choose which laws to obey.
@tedcruz I support @BetoORourke because of his willingness to stand up and protect the liberties Texans hold dear instead of snuggling up to @realDonaldTrump. Cruz cares more about his political career than he does about Texas. Look at his last two years of service. #Loser #IdiotInChief

@realDonaldTrump "As part of this reform, we will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and for people like me, but unfair to American workers."
@realDonaldTrump "The Trump Plan will collapse the current seven tax brackets to three brackets." "The 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on investment income will be repealed, as will the alternative minimum tax."

@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN Yes sir
@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN I bow down to your wet superiority.
@Makayla1338 @ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN Ha! That is awesome. Love your sense of humor :-)
@columbo7771 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz @foxnewsnight I misspoke. I meant Feinstein: "I want to talk a little bit about one of the big decisions that we have the belief that although you told Senator Collins that you believe it was ‘settled law,’ the question is really do you believe that it’s correct law, and that’s Roe v. Wade."
@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN I know, I know. Luckily we have you to be our guide and Shepard. No go chug 2-3 gallons of water within 30 minutes, you need the hydration!
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz @foxnewsnight Uh, were you not listening??? From the start, Nancy (and I'm not her biggest fan) rattled off a diatribe of concerns. You are deaf or stupid.
@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN Great! I'm glad that you have proved this hoax wrong. You are amazing. You deserve a medal. No, you deserve much more!!! Perhaps a Nobel prize! Thank you so much for pointing us in the right direction. You are our savior!!!
@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN Exactly. We are all wrong and brainwashed. Too much water can't hurt anyone. I think you should prove the point by guzzling 2-3 gallons of water RIGHT NOW! You'll be fine. I'm sure of it.
@ChristianAbert3 @ryanherbst21 @baileylax13 @CNN Have you ever heard of Google? Give it a try and you'll see the answer. I posted two articles....there are hundreds.

@AlexanderMaga2 @ChrisCuomo @NYGovCuomo I don't agree with him but it isn't fake....
@Niklbag That is much tamer than what @FoxNews says.
@Niklbag That's not a lie. It may be.
@ScottMatthewsEL @marklevinshow @AprilDRyan What lie to the American people. You've not presented one false statement in any of your examples.
@RidgeReaper68 @CNN @donlemon @FoxNews @IngrahamAngIe @realJeffreyLord @chipfranklin It's an opinion...it isn't fake.
@GeoWashPundit Anonymous Sources are good enough for Trump
@GeoWashPundit Trump:  “Anonymous Sources are really starting to BURN the media.” @FoxNews The fact is that many anonymous sources don’t even exist. They are fiction made up by the Fake News reporters. Look at the lie that Fake CNN is now in. They got caught red handed! Enemy of the People!
@ChristianAbert3 @baileylax13 @CNN I'm a triathlete. I do Ironman 70.3's . And I can tell you that too much hydration can kill you. I've seen fellow competitors taken away in ambulances for over-hydration. If you think that is fake, you are an idiot.
@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll That isn't fake. That is integrity. You just don't agree with them and you call it fake. Ok, I don't agree with you so you are fake.
@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll Dude, cite ONE false statement from today. I'm beginning to think that you can't read.
@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll You said that they don't report on GDP, economy or unemployment. I showed you that they do. You said they are fake, but you can't give me a single fake instance from today. Bashing is not fake. Just because you don't agree with them doesn't make them fake.

@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll They do talk about the economy. They do talk about unemployment. They do talk about our GDP. I'll post in this thread. Also, I said to list three false statements that CNN made today, If you can't then they aren't fake, they are factual.
@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll You have no idea if there was collusion. The investigation is ongoing. Regarding CNN as "fake news," list three things CNN said today that are factual (and provable that they are) incorrect. If they are fake, this should be easy!

@realDonaldTrump What did you expect? They would never admit to it. This is a "he says she says" situation. So who do you trust? An administration that has resulted in 5 convictions of @realDonaldTrump's inner circle, or a Pulitzer Prize-winning, respected journalist? Nice try Donald.
@StopMSMLies @h_astorpr @WeAreOne_Q @HillaryClinton I'm a republican and I watch Fox as much as CNN. I keep an open mind and listen to all sides. You are the one under mind-control. All you know how to say is "Fake News" but you refuse to admit that @FoxNews is as guilty as anyone. @realDonaldTrump controls your mind.
@BadRiffRat @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Yep we'll see. We're probably both wrong :-) Have a good evening.

@BadRiffRat @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Trump shoots himself in the foot and I don't believe that he thinks about the big picture. My original comment was about his tweeter habit.

Your responses are indicative of a zealot that will defend his leader regardless. BTW, I never said I didn't like Trump. But most republican's hate his tweets
@BadRiffRat @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Yep, another Trump zealot! Or just another Russian bot as your name implies. Either way, just another clueless Trumpian wallowing in ignorance.

@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump You know what creates a larger "FALSE REALITY?" That would be @realDonaldTrump with is misinformation and "alternative facts." A reality star will create their own reality, and @POTUS has certainly done that! #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@WeAreOne_Q Yes, because some people are interested in the strange and unusual. QAnon is both. Done...I asked myself and answered, that is what you wanted. #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@WeAreOne_Q Well, if you believe in "FULL TRANSPARENCY" then you should show us everything. not "(SOME) things." #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@WeAreOne_Q You've read one too many Tom Clancy novels! #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@markknoller @realDonaldTrump got himself worked up and finally blew a gasket!
@Nick83948946 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews So, looking at the ABC site. Here are the top stories. Is every story below a lie? "Man arrested for threatening Boston newspaper." "Grandma charged after grandson's hot car death." "Northeast cooling off as Midwest gets new storm." "Former coach denies charges in Nassar scandal"
@Skinsnrugby @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews Anytime. The world needs more nuts :-) #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews The MSM are right more than they are wrong. They certainly have a better track record than @realDonaldTrump! Just because the MSM doesn't agree with you doesn't make them wrong or "fake." The #QAnon people are the sheep, following crazy conspiracy theories. #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@realDonaldTrump @CNN I can't believe an American President just sent a message saying that someone or something"sucks." You are a petty, petty man.  How about acting like a president and do something. Like disarming North Korea? Like helping the US turn to renewable energies? #IdiotInChief
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews So you are for chain migration??? Awesome! #moron #idiot
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Do you know the difference between a brown-noser and a shithead?
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I'm surprised you even know how to Google.... #idiot #Moron #TrumpButtBuddy
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @BretBaier Self-serving moron! #Moron #Idiot
@realDonaldTrump Sigh, you don't even know how the internet works, much less Google. BTW, they can put anything they want on their page. This is a free country. Google isn't required to be a propaganda outlet for @potus. You have @FoxNews for that! #IdiotInChief
@cool_kitten18 @WeAreOne_Q No idea what D5 is. And we are all being swept up.
@cnsnews If you had only paid as much attention to child molesters as you do @realDonaldTrump, you may have a valid voice. But given your history, I don't trust your ability to expose wrong-doing. Of course you'd think @POTUS is doing a great job!
@cool_kitten18 @WeAreOne_Q Exactly
@realDonaldTrump You've been listening to Q and @FoxNews too much. Plus you just make up crap. You are as big a crackpot as Q!!! #IdiotInChief #Moron #QAnonIsAnIdiot https://t.co/btgwTaEGTQ
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs HAHAHAHAHAHAHA....[catches breath] HAHAHAHAHAHA! Trump killed almost 3K people in Puerto Rico because he is a bigot #IdiotInChief #Bigot #Liar

@IvankaTrump @POTUS @RepLoisFrankel @JohnBoozman @SenatorCardin @RepEdRoyce Women's empowerment is very important and I'm glad that you are fighting for it. But your dad @realDonaldTrump doesn't give a rats a$$ about women's empowerment. @POTUS thinks that women are great and every man should own one!
@TeamTedCruz @tedcruz I #DontChooseCruz because he gave into @realDonaldTrump. If Ted Cruz won't fight for America, why should I choose him?
@stinehart8 @ABC Uh, yes he did. @FoxNews even said so https://t.co/3t496Hnxb3
@GovMikeHuckabee Do you know the difference between an a$$ kisser and a sh!thead? I didn't think so. The difference is depth perception and your head is so far up @realDonaldTrump that you can't even see the world around you. You are a self-serving hack! #IdiotInChief #Liars
@tedcruz I see that you are fighting for your political survival after cozening up to @realDonaldTrump!!! I'm a republican but I'd never vote for you because you gave in. You quit fighting. You are filling the swap, not draining it.
I have never given money to @realDonaldTrump but I am on their mailing list somehow. I receive one (and sometimes two or three) emails EVERY DAY from their campaign begging for money. Many of the emails bash other politicians or candidates. We are better than this! #IdiotInChief https://t.co/6PgHc893k4

@seanhannity BREAKING: Sean Hannity is hack journalist. He's just an entertainer that has developed a cozy relationship with @realDonaldTrump. "Birds of a feather" is what my mother always said.
@WeAreOne_Q Yep, coincidence. Lots of other things happened between 2009 - 2013, like the sun setting every day. I don;t think HRC was the root cause of those things either.
@realDonaldTrump How are you still the President of the United States? #IdiotInChief
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I totally agree! Don't take things at face value., Challenge ideas. However, you must concede that the MSM are right 99% of the time. They are not fake and they are rarely wrong. You should also encourage people to heed your advice about @realDonaldTrump. Don't believe everything
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump That is true. However, acting on conspiracy theories without any evidence can cause great harm and is dangerous. #QAnonIsAnIdiot
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I never said anything about Russia or collusion. I never said that I approved of the investigation. We were talking about the MSM and truthfulness.
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Again, nothing to do with MSM
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with the MSM
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Lanny said (live on CNN) that Cohen did not have the information and later he said he misspoke. Since he said it live on CNN, most reasonable people would assume that is as good as an retraction. As far as "Progue" it sounds like they made a mistake. Is that all you have???
@SampsonRamm @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Here is some misinformation for you: "I think Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people... Google and Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. Its not fair to large portions of the population" @POTUS
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump What false claims? List them.
@seedeenurse @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump With Lanny, they just reported what he said. He is Cohen's lawyer so it is reasonable to believe he knows what's going on. But Lanny said that he misspoke. That is on him, not CNN. No idea what you are talking about with Prague. Give me some more examples. Want my Trump lies?
@SampsonRamm @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nope, I'll cite original sources (government reports, scientific research, etc.). Are you up for the challenge? You start. Give me a MSM article from the past 24 hours that provided misinformation about @realDonaldTrump.
@SampsonRamm @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I totally agree!!! Perhaps you should tell that to @realDonaldTrump. He is the one spreading most of the misinformation, not the press. I guarantee that I can show more instances of the President distributing misinformation over the past 7 days than you can cite the "MSM"
@ThiaMedia @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump They were concerned that if he gets too fat that he won't fit on Air Force One :-) Yeah, some of the news is more like the "National Inquirer" than real reporting. I hope that smart people know the difference and take it for whatever its worth.
@SampsonRamm @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @POTUS "Negative" and "wrong" have too completely different meanings. The media often criticizes @Potus when he makes false or misleading statements. And he makes a lot. You call that "negative" but it's not wrong.  If he spoke truthfully more often, then you'd see that 90% go way down.
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump I do my own research. The MSM is right more than they are wrong. Just because they don't support your views doesn't mean that they are wrong or "fake." The followers of #QAnon are the sheep...they are following crackpot conspiracy theories. #QAnonIsAnIdiot #qanonsense

@rpiloves @WeAreOne_Q Sure....what is the meaning that the person in the tweet was trying to get across?
@realDonaldTrump How about doing something about this. Do you remember this tweet? "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"
A great example of @realDonaldTrump being an a$$hole! https://t.co/T9C1ebNl3O

@WeAreOne_Q Is this illegal? If so, did you take your information to the police? If not, stop b*tching! #Morons #QAnonSucks #QAnonIsAnIdiot

@sillyleftys @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yep, that is the response that I'd expect from a Trumpian. If you don't agree with someone, just call them a liar. Not every Republican is fooled by the dog whistles and propaganda. I respect your views and opinions. How about you respect mine and stop calling me a liar.

@Liquadate @EricTrump @washingtonpost @JeffBezos @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yes, U.S. Steel said any “operational changes” such as the opening of new mills would be “publicly announced” and “made available on our website” if it occurred. So where are your facts? Surely a quick google search would back up @realDonaldTrump claim of seven new plants.
@Liquadate @EricTrump @washingtonpost @JeffBezos @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Look who is "sliding." When the facts aren't on your side, you slide. Typical Trumpian move. Come on, let's see you  prove them wrong. Show me proof that U.S. Steel is opening seven plants. No sliding this time. It should be simple to prove if it is true!
@Liquadate @EricTrump @washingtonpost @JeffBezos @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Fine, we'll pick an easy one. @realDonaldTrump claimed the United States Steel Corporation “is opening up seven plants.” USS has restarted two and they say that they have no plans to restart more.

@SenBennetCO I agree with your sentiment. The Supreme Court determined that his "travel ban document" is constitutional. However, we need to make sure that the implementation of the document is executed within the spirit of the constitution, and not used solely as a political tool.
"That's why when the polls are good, you remember during the campaign, when the polls were good I would always talk about it. When they weren't so good, I wouldn't mention it, right? I didn't talk polls." Actual quote from @realDonaldTrump last night in SC.

@ScorpioDragon94 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Right. If evidence exist (which I don;t know if it does) then we won't know until the very end of the investigation. Just because no one has been charged does not mean that there is no evidence.
@realDonaldTrump The Times said that the leak came from people related to your legal team. If you feel the leak was "disgraceful" then you should fix the problem with your team. @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump What is disgraceful about asking questions? Answer the questions and let's get past this. @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Since when do you need a crime as a pretext to obstruct justice??? Those two things are unrelated.

@ScorpioDragon94 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You assume that an investigator will file charges the minute they find evidence. That is not how it works. You, or me or anyone else has no idea if they've found anything  related to collusion because those charges will be the last charges they file.

@RepPerlmutter @realDonaldTrump If @realDonaldTrump tries to fire Mr. Mueller, your constituents expect you to stand up and prevent it! Let the process play out. If there is nothing to find, then let's get past this. If Mr Mueller does find something, we can proceed from there.
"This President is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"[Kelly] said he was sick about my firing and that he intended to quit in protest. He said he didn't want to work for dishonorable people who would treat someone like me in such a manner." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"The setup of the dinner, both the physical layout of a private meal and Trump's pretense that he had not already asked me to stay on multiple occasions, convinced me this was an effort to establish a patronage relationship."  @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"Asking-rhetorically, I assumed-whether he seemed like a guy who needed the service of prostitutes. He then began discussing cases where women had accused him of sexual assault, a subject I had not raised."  @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"It is also wrong to stand idly by, or worse, to stay silent when you know better, while a president brazenly seeks to undermine public confidence in law enforcement institutions that were established to keep our leaders in check." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"Brought up what he called the 'golden showers thing'...it bothered him if there was 'even a 1% chance' his wife, Melania, thought it was true...what kind of marriage...does a spouse conclude there is only a 99 percent chance her husband didn't do that?"  @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"Another reason you know this isn't true: I'm a germaphobe. There's no way I would let people pee on each other around me, no way." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"I had often wondered why, when given numerous opportunities to condemn the Russian government's invasions of its neighbors and repression — even murder — of its own citizens, Trump refused to just state the plain facts" @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"I stared at the soft white pouches under his expressionless blue eyes. I remember thinking in that moment that the president doesn't understand the FBI's role in American life." @realDonaldTrump @Comey
"His face appeared slightly orange with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coifed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his" @realDonaldTrump @Comey

@stumper53 @ABC @LetsGetDCToWork I agree....that is what I said. If he backs Trump, I'll fight against his election.
@pancho_villa123 @ABC @LetsGetDCToWork Which party is that?
@LetsGetDCToWork Does Rick support Donald's trump's agenda?
@ABC Stand up for conservative fiscal views, and I support you. Stand up for Trump and I'll fight your election. @LetsGetDCToWork
@politico Good call. That feud went deep and dirty quick. I'm glad to see that you both can move on! @jimmykimmel @seanhannity
I give it a week....he'll fire Mr Mueller within a week. As a republican, my representatives better be ready to push back against @realDonaldTrump very hard! https://t.co/pqM3HKw6hw
@politico @joshgerstein It's not an attack on what I stand for. You seem a little jumpy for an innocent man, Mr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Great insight Kara! #Facebook @MarkZukerberg https://t.co/sRVRXgMVcj
@_ryebreadd @TPUSA_IUP @charliekirk11 In a binary math system, there are only two digits (0 &amp; 1). But binary numbers can represent more than just two. Same with gender.
@SenateMajLdr Yep. And I'll pay more in taxes under your new &amp; improved tax code, which also puts us trillions of dollars deeper in dept. Thank you Mr McConnell!!!! #TaxReform
Wow! I wonder what this is about. I bet @realDonaldTrump didn't see this coming. https://t.co/D3dX5ChtnJ
@realDonaldTrump I can't wait for you to build your wall and then nothing changes. I agree that we need secure borders. But your $20B will do nothing. #StupidWall
@VP @POTUS You poor thing. It must be exhausting! Meetings and then wining &amp; dining. I hope you get a nap in. I'll go back to my 60 hr a week job and let you get back to your hard work.
@JRubinBlogger $1.6 Trillion more than predicted. This is insane. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @POTUS https://t.co/us4CclgOYF
@politico Then fix it. Negotiate. Stop shooting from the hip and making threats that you can't back up. If China sells the $1+ trillion in debt that they own, you are screwed. How about acting like a president for once! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@SpeakerRyan Infrastructure? Shouldn't you be more concerned with the massive debt you are creating??? https://t.co/us4CclgOYF
$1.6 trillion more than expected. I'm a republican and I'm embarrassed. This is on you @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP https://t.co/us4CclgOYF
Merry Christmas kids! Just what you wanted, DEBT! @realDonaldTrump @potus #RealNews https://t.co/U9oX9f4Wni
@t_matson @realDonaldTrump Great, a large number of us are paying more taxes and they still can't balance a budget https://t.co/U9oX9f4Wni
Of course the tax rules don't apply to him, just Amazon @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews https://t.co/LNhpEw8cV3
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LNhpEw8cV3
@CNNPolitics He constantly blames everyone else for the world's problems. How about looking in the mirror buddy @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump It was four years ago and can you please stop plugging your own self-interest while you are the President of the United States? @POTUS
@CNNPolitics It was a mistake. Things like this will happen when you have a president constantly shooting from the hip @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews
It looks like @FoxNews is now reporting #RealNews https://t.co/rrRCl33P6I
Without @FoxNews our president @realDonaldTrump wouldn't know what to do. He watches their shows for instructions. @POTUS #RealNews https://t.co/mj1PuICbk3
@t_matson @realDonaldTrump I don't live in NY, I live in California. https://t.co/XioAS2AHjf
@t_matson @realDonaldTrump Oh, the facts match my perception. My entire state just got a huge tax increase. That is a fact.
@thehill @Redpainter1 Without @FoxNews our president @realDonaldTrump wouldn't know what to do. He watches their shows for instructions. @POTUS #RealNews
@AnnCoulter Probably, she does work for @realDonaldTrump who seems to hire idiots
Once again you chose money of lives @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews https://t.co/yABnkWFgUV
@politico How about paying attention to this instead of wasting $20B on a wall that won't do anything @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews

@t_matson @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you are defending it to me.
He has a point @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews https://t.co/cZVeqBIwyC
@USCG @USCGGreatLakes Thank you for your service!!!
@realDonaldTrump Instead of blaming others, why don't you do something about it. You are the president after all!!! @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump He did it because you told him we are pulling out troops out. You said that things are okay in Syria. What say you now???
@t_matson @realDonaldTrump With the state income tax rate at 13%, people here hit the 10K limit pretty quick. There aren't many houses less than $750K here. So yeah, almost everyone where I live will see a tax increase. Also, the "tax cut" is not "historic." Thanks @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump It's not like you haven't  told us one thing and done another. Like with firing Rex Tillerson? Like with firing James Comey? Etc, etc. @POTUS
@politico You may be waiting a while..... @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Immigration
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, but now I can't deduct the SALT taxes and you have limited my mortgage interest deduction so it is a wash!
@TIME Proof that @realDonaldTrump will assert almost anything. He is the only one that believes this to be true! @potus#RealNews

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Yes he will...even though securing the border won't impact the flow of most illegals (overstaying their visas) or stop drugs (which mostly come through ports). He promised to waste our money on a border wall and by gosh he is going to do it! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #WastedMoney
I've never trusted FaceBook Messenger and I never installed it on my phone. Good thing! @MarkZukerberg @facebook #privacy #data https://t.co/SH30iPzumW
@FoxNews calls out @realDonaldTrump about his false claims against @amazon #RealNews @POTUS https://t.co/CX3WCxSrwa
@iheartmindy Thank God she didn't have an AR15 or a lot more people would be dead!
@sendavidperdue I'm a republican and that statement is idiotic. Don't you have better things to do than to build a $20B that will accomplish nothing???
@FoxNews Probably shot down by those heavily armed Mexican's and their diverse collection of surface-to-air missiles that they purchased in the supermarket before they come to the US to commit violent crimes. If only we had a wall that could stop surface-to-air missiles...
@Redpainter1 And probably the consistency of wet spaghetti
@CNNPolitics That is your first mistake. You want to apply logic to Trump's tweets :-) @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #RealNews
@GOP @SecretaryAcosta That is very true. Just be careful how much credit you take for job growth since it was well underway when you took the White House. But still, regardless of party affiliation, American is doing well.
@IvankaTrump @GOP That is great news. However, make sure that you mention that Verizon had already committed to donate $200M over 5 years. So an extra $200M is still a great donation....but very different than a $400M new donation.
@realDonaldTrump Uh huh. I have some swamp land to sell you if you believe that poll #FakeNews @POTUS #FakePoll
Even Ann knows that sending the military to the border won't accomplish anything! https://t.co/bSWc7NNLxg
@CNNPolitics Because they know a boarder wall won't accomplish anything! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Immigration #StupidWall
Exactly! We shouldn't waste $20B on a wall that won't solve the problem! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Immigration https://t.co/LzfkcQHXcS
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, they have strong laws to repel the Americans that are fleeing to Mexico and Canada???
@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry Mr President, but you did start a trade war. You even said trade wars are easy to win. Get your head out of the sand!!! @POTUS #RealNews https://t.co/fMrnkpczdn
Even FOX News recognizes @realDonaldTrump idiocy!!!! @POTUS https://t.co/GZhqIsRP3X
@tedcruz I'm a republican but I'm going to give to @BetoORourke because you haven't done anything to reel-in @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xgXNA87aGn
@senrobportman I agree with your sentiment. What new steps have we taken?
@realDonaldTrump @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer Uh huh #RealNews https://t.co/9xIhKdk9hb
@realDonaldTrump This sums it up #RealNews https://t.co/9xIhKdk9hb

@FoxNews @POTUS Dude, have you seen the stock market over the last several weeks??? @realDonaldTrump
@ReutersBiz Sounds like a stock buy opportunity!
Let's see if @realDonaldTrump takes credit for this! #RealNews https://t.co/Y7DQthOWGu
Yep! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #DACA https://t.co/vCGNlpEuMf
@GOP @PressSec @POTUS I'm a republican and that statement simply isn't true. The house presented a joint (DEM &amp; GOP) solution to the President and he refused to sign it (even after he promised he would). This isn't the democrats fault. Trump killed DACA.
@realDonaldTrump DACA is dead because you killed it and a wall won't stop drugs or crime. https://t.co/RbiWISEfJc
