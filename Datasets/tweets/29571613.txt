The way in which the property is landscaped makes upper Viretta Park appear to be a part of Mr. Schultz’s land,” John Capps, then-president of a neighborhood group called the Madrona Community Council, said in a letter to the parks department.

Quite a few of Howard Schultz’s neighbors say Parks Depart never should have let him build a 100-foot driveway through the park next to his new home he got city permission to build a new driveway and even convinced Seattle authorities to waive the $25,000 fee they charged for ...
