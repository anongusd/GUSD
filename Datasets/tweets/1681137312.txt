@realDonaldTrump Hey @GOP if Obama has said this you would have all the ammo you would need to say he’s a communist. Are you gonna denounce this?
@washingtonpost He shouldn’t have decided his way in Citizens United, or the travel ban, or transgender soldiers, or the Voting rights act. If he wanted to save the GOP from itself he surrendered a long time ago.
Although a special election or 2 would happen this year, I highly doubt the state would turn back to the GOP after they already rejected Ed Gilsepe and Corey Stewart.
Here’s what I think will happen in Virginia. Fairfax either resigns or is impeached. Northman appoints a new Lieutenant Governor. Northam resigns.  That new LG becomes Governor then and then the Attorney General resigns and the new governor appoints a new AG and LG. No GOP rule!
