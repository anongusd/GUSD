@HLawMediation fyi: The Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act, H.R.113/S.1706, is federal legislation. If passed into the law, the paradigm of horse rescue/welfare would be forced to shift because no American equine would be subjected to being slaughtered on U.S. soil or abroad.
@shari_hazlett Thx for asking. We adhere to no kill tenets. If a horse enters a municipal shelter, the acceptable reason for euthanasia is valid medical reasons. As for horse rescue orgs, we applaud those that have the wherewithal to do certifiable "compassion pulls" from slaughter auctions.
