Wishing everyone in the Show-Me State a happy and safe Halloween! https://t.co/5my19budbW
The bottom line is that when it comes to prescription drug prices, Missourians are taking in on the chin. And that’s just not fair.		Claire: “There’s simply no reason that the cost of a drug in Versailles, Missouri, should be 7 times higher than in Versailles, France.” https://t.co/xjVP70XIRY
Versailles, MO vs. Versailles, France.	Milan, MO vs. Milan, Italy.	Sedalia, MO vs. Sedalia, Canada.		One thing all these cities have in common? The cost of prescription drugs is, on average, consistently higher– up to 591% higher – in the Show Me state than in foreign countries. https://t.co/JEgrAZ5uzR

Claire agrees with the President: prescription drug prices are too high, and we need all hands on deck in our effort to bring down costs.

Big news: @POTUS *just* signed Claire’s bill to prevent pharmacy “gag clauses” – and stop patients overpaying for their medications. This is incredible news – here’s the story: https://t.co/D7cC8FkFMB
Claire’s always fought to keep pre-existing condition protections &amp; tackle rising healthcare and prescription drug costs – but “junk” insurance plans could increase costs for Missourians &amp; reduce access to quality healthcare for seniors &amp; those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/QNe3jwevXx
In a partisan effort to undermine protections for those with preexisting conditions, the Administration is attempting to expand “junk” bare-bones, temporary health insurance plans… but Claire’s pushing back. Because they’re just that: 	   	Junk. #NoJunkPlans https://t.co/wefTVj6BPo

Claire’s bill would cap the amount that hospitals and physicians could charge uninsured patients and out-of-network patients who have individual market coverage—“this proposal would make significant strides in lowering costs and premiums for Missourians.” https://t.co/WBlarXJKuU
Claire’s determined to find any and every avenue possible to lower healthcare costs for Missourians—and her new bill to cap out-of-network costs for individual market health insurance plans would lead to lower costs and premiums.
Claire’s standing up for Missourians: “The 1-2 partnership that’s essential for rural MO is high speed broadband combined with reliable mail service. That is where you can start businesses &amp;allow businesses to thrive—no matter where you live—if you have those two ingredients.” https://t.co/n5OYGJ0Z3P

Claire knows that “while this might not solve every problem within the air ambulance industry, it’s a bipartisan measure that will provide us with critical information &amp; better empower consumers, bringing us closer to a solution—I’m not afraid to compromise to make real progress”
Claire: “This is an important step to bring greater accountability and oversight to the air ambulance industry, whose practices have often left patients with tens of thousands of dollars of debt.” https://t.co/Q6g4Onn8U2
Claire’s fighting back because these plans “offer coverage so deceptively slim it does nothing but skirt the protections we’ve worked to put in place for Missourians with preexisting conditions and to help ensure older Missourians don’t pay even more for their care.” https://t.co/ijol1A3H3F
Earlier this year, the Administration expanded short term “junk” insurance plans that can exclude preexisting conditions &amp; raise premiums for folks with preexisting conditions &amp; can also often exclude basic health benefits like hospitalization, maternity care &amp; prescription drugs

What else? This week, Claire signed on to an effort to *permanently* extend and increase mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions (like Historically Black Colleges and Universities) from $255 million to $300 million.
So when the Department of Education tries to weaken accountability in higher education by an effort to dismantle a rule that will leave Missouri students vulnerable to predatory career training programs? 		Claire fights back. https://t.co/Do2bSlZwMy
Claire's made it her mission in the Senate to tackle issues of college affordability and accessibility, especially student loan debt and holding for-profit colleges and universities accountable when they defraud or cheat students.
Claire's always stood with MO students: just this month she's called on Secretary DeVos to protect students from unmanageable debts and degrees that offer little to no employment opportunities AND championed expanded funding for HBCUs &amp; other minority-serving institutions.
Claire won’t stop fighting to make sure that government works for all Missourians: “Government oversight is about making things—big and small—work better for Missourians, and it’s what I’ll continue to do.” https://t.co/bXuFc9rteL

This bill would allow widows, widowers &amp; surviving divorced spouses to:	✔receive 100% of the survivor benefits they are entitled to	✔increase the value of their survivor benefits beyond arbitrary caps	✔receive child in-care benefits until children are 18 or 19 &amp; more
“Social Security is founded on the principle that we take care of the most vulnerable in our society, but far too often when a loved one passes away, their surviving spouse is being forgotten and left behind.” – Claire
Claire knows that’s unacceptable—so she’s backing a new plan to end unfair restrictions on Social Security benefits for widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses. https://t.co/n9BGHQ1mlX
Right now, poverty rates among widows/widowers caring for children &amp; widows/widowers with disabilities are among the highest of all Social Security recipients. The poverty rate of widows/widowers receiving Social Security benefits is nearly 2x as high as that of retired workers.
This is a big step forward in fighting the opioid epidemic that will help save lives in Missouri. Claire’s glad to see this example of bipartisan legislation pass—to curb the flow of fentanyl into communities, cut down on overprescription, and support doctors &amp; first responders. https://t.co/ePB2fUn8pG
This week (by a vote of 99-1!) the Senate passed an opioids package that included Claire’s priorities for fighting the epidemic, including proposals aimed at cracking down on fentanyl shipments, bringing down overprescription, and increasing prescribing oversight in Medicare.
Claire released the following statement on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court: https://t.co/QGkEYegig9

Claire’s “witnessed firsthand the challenges women face in the workforce—it comes as no surprise that they continue into retirement.” Women are 80% more likely than men to face poverty in retirement, so she's backing a bill to ensure they have access to fair, stable retirement.

This week, Claire introduced a bill to honor Arla Harrell—a Missouri WWII veteran intentionally exposed to mustard gas—by renaming the post office in Macon, MO the Arla W. Harrell Post Office. After a 2 year effort, Claire’s Arla Harrell Act was signed by the President last year.

This is exciting: this week the @FCC awarded nearly $255 million over the next ten years to expand broadband to Missourians in rural communities - more than any other state.
One Missourian’s takeaway from Claire’s trade roundtable? “The most important thing was I felt like I was being listened to” he said. “I wasn’t told, ‘Well, we’re going to have to deal with it for a little while &amp; you guys might survive or you might not.’” https://t.co/tgZPNMgZqq

Claire heard from the hardworking Missourians at Mid Continent whose jobs and livelihoods are at stake, and it’s absolutely clear: these tariffs are costing Missouri jobs and may force businesses to shutter. https://t.co/FIvbGZbWHg

Claire visited a Poplar Bluff factory earlier this summer to see firsthand how they’ve been devastated by this trade war. Things haven’t turned around: one employee wrote “now we are on the brink of extinction, &amp; our government’s trade policy is to blame.” https://t.co/YV5H31VVEx
Claire called on the Administration to scrap this plan: 		Not only can short term “junk plans” discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, they can raise costs for millions of Americans – all while raising premiums for sicker people and putting purchasers at risk. https://t.co/nq5CayNaOQ

Claire's committed to tackling rising healthcare and prescription drug costs a top priority—and this bipartisan bill is a good step forward. She knows "we’ve got to continue taking every possible step to make prescription drugs in this country more affordable.”
What do gag clauses that mean for consumers? Overpaying around $135 million for prescriptions—in 2013 alone.		But here's the good news: Claire's bipartisan bill with @SenatorCollins to fix this JUST cleared a key hurdle in committee!
Here's what Claire thinks about gag clauses: “It’s outrageous that these contract clauses would forbid pharmacists from helping Missourians pay less for the medicines they need." https://t.co/Fqe4y6FKGH
Right now, pharmacy gag clauses forbid some pharmacists from proactively telling consumers if their prescription would cost less if they paid for it out of pocket rather than using their insurance plan... and pharmacists who disobey these clauses can face significant penalties.
Claire’s reaction when a federal court ruled that patent did require review, despite Allergan’s efforts to shield it with a dubious loophole? “This is a win for MO &amp; consumers all across the country, and hopefully puts an end to this deplorable practice.” https://t.co/xCdlv2GEst
Combating rising prescription drug costs is one of Claire's top priorities – that’s why she strongly opposed one company’s move to shield a drug patent from review, calling it a “brazen attempt by a pharmaceutical company to stifle competition at the cost of consumers.”
Claire: “The NTSB recommendations following the 1999 incident in Arkansas were pretty straightforward, but unfortunately nothing happened. So I’m in the early stages of drafting legislation... These recommendations are reasonable and commonsense.” More from @stltoday: https://t.co/MNadw01Q5b
"We’ve had more than 40 deaths associated with duck boats since 1999, yet there has been little done to address the inherent dangers..." In response to last week’s tragedy, Claire’s introducing new legislation to make these vehicles safer. Watch her speech: https://t.co/OHYCuxUujv

Claire knows we can’t go back: if this lawsuit is successful, it “will leave more than one million Missourians with pre-existing conditions out in the cold—that’s wrong and I’m committed to fighting tooth and nail to prevent that.”

Claire joined 46 of her colleagues in writing: “this rule could harm people with pre-existing conditions, raise costs on older Americans, &amp; promote plans that exclude basic benefits...”	   	Read more in the letter: https://t.co/6tlE91mJin https://t.co/dZAlmmysAH
The administration’s proposal would expand short-term health insurance plans to year-long “junk plans.”		Sound bad? It is: these plans can exclude basic health benefits, like hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, and substance abuse treatment. https://t.co/cKWNktECyD
Claire’s made tackling rising healthcare &amp; prescription drug costs a top priority – that’s why today she’s calling on the Administration to stop implementation of a new proposal that would jeopardize Missourians’ access to quality, affordable healthcare.
Today Claire talked MO history with @LIBERTYSCHOOLS students: they’re in DC to compete in @NEHgov @NationalHistory contest with some really impressive websites they built, one featuring Claire’s favorite – Harry Truman!

Thousands of Missourians have made their voices heard on #netneutrality.	   	Claire: Missourians “want a free and open internet that allows consumers and small businesses fair access to the internet content of their choice.” #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/4GC4QYOZsW
The clock is ticking for #NetNeutrality– today, critical FCC internet rules officially end. So Claire’s calling on @SpeakerRyan and the House of Representatives to follow the Senate’s lead and pass bipartisan protections for consumer internet safeguards.

Claire: “I thought I’d seen everything, but taxpayers spending tens of millions of dollars on a program halfway around the world that didn’t work, then another $98,000 to make sure it didn’t work is a new one.” https://t.co/GLQs2ZAcHC
Claire’s demanding answers over why the government spent $60 million on an electricity project in Afghanistan that doesn’t work—and then spent additional $$ to disable it due to safety concerns: https://t.co/h5qQb7anzg
Claire’s fighting back against efforts to raise Missourians’ health insurance &amp; prescription drug costs with this deceptively slim coverage—standing up for affordable healthcare 🏥, Americans with preexisting conditions ♿, and older Americans 👴.
Claire’s leading a letter to @HHSGov pushing back on insurance company plans that would increase costs and reduce access for Americans with preexisting conditions... or deny them altogether. Read more: https://t.co/ZYk0ofIEY9
Roughly 30% of Missourians (more than 1 million people) have a deniable preexisting condition – and a new #JunkPlan insurance proposal could jeopardize their coverage, hike their costs, and exclude basic benefits like prescription drugs.
Yesterday Claire met a very special guest on the Senate floor… (history-making) baby Maile Pearl! Congratulations to new mom @SenDuckworth (and loved the duck onesie, Maile)! https://t.co/GX7LUSYpIh
Claire: “I’m so proud of the Navy pilot that was piloting the Southwest flight and was able to land that plane… She showed tremendous skill and poise at one of the most critical moments a pilot could ever face.” More from @thehill: https://t.co/fSCfVHDwHx
Claire’s excited to announce a new $25.5 million @DeptVetAffairs grant to state-run veterans homes in Missouri for renovation &amp; construction, including: 	- $13.1m to St. Louis 	- $8.7m to Cape Girardeau	- $3.7m to St. James
She’s speaking out on the cost of lifesaving overdose prevention drugs: “You know how many parents I’ve talked to that have walked into the bedroom and their child was overdosing and they can’t afford this drug to save their life? I want you to be as mad as I am about it.”
Claire challenged @HHS_ASH to explain an overdose prevention drug's 600% price increase: “I’m going to hold you accountable on this…I want somebody at [@CMSGov] to begin to express the outrage to these pharmaceutical companies that I hear from Missourians every day.” https://t.co/uv2woXENqy
On high drug prices, Claire’s pushing for accountability and for the government “to begin to express the outrage to these pharmaceutical companies that I hear from Missourians every day.” @kytv: https://t.co/QhUVMfQgkN
As the daughter of a WWII vet, Claire’s proud to represent the many thousands of Missourians who serve our country. Yesterday, she met with Missouri chapters of @MilitaryOfficer to discuss her continuing efforts to advocate for MO’s servicemembers &amp; veterans.
Claire celebrated the 100 year anniversary of @aaoms with the *first ever* Missourian to serve as President of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Dr. Brett Ferguson of @UMKansasCity, who started his impressive career at @TrumanMedKC. https://t.co/vxmB3F96zt
Claire’s digging into why the government is creating unnecessary confusion for Missouri’s veterans by operating both https://t.co/okQDYeAAxr and https://t.co/2Nr10j2oXz. https://t.co/38LoP71m5f
This $10 million in @HHSgov funding for MO will help:	✔ expand treatment access to MO families who need it most	✔ reduce overdose deaths 	✔ cut down on overprescriptions
Claire’s seen firsthand how devastating this epidemic is on families: “Opioid addiction continues to devastate families and communities across MO—but we’re also seeing addiction and prevention treatment programs chip away at an epidemic that at times has felt unstoppable.”
Great news! @HHSGov announces $10 million in new opioid prevention and treatment funding is headed to MO. Claire knows “these new resources will go a long way in continuing to combat this crisis and give tools to the folks on the front lines.”

A NEW REPORT from @SenateFinance shows that 20 of the top 37 Fortune 500 health care companies will save approximately $100 billion in tax benefits over 10 years… savings they can pass to shareholders &amp; executives while Missourians’ prescription drug &amp; emergency room costs rise. https://t.co/bfZ2ZCNPkX

Meet Matilda!	AKA: Toodles	Very deep thinker. Currently considering the fundamental nature of reality, existence, and squeaky toys. Thinks time is relative, and so are zooms. Will thoughtfully BOOP you anytime. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/c8U5TYeIKj
Meet Dexter!	AKA: Dexter Pants	Is a very concentrated Ball of Floofness. For your safety, we can only share very small photos of Mr. Pants. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by cuteness, do not look directly at Mr. Pants sitting on a Pumpkin. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/QTXP7SwHgc
Meet Duke!	AKA: Smooshy McSmooshface	Is irrationally afraid of the @UPS man. @FedEx is probably a no-go too. Would kindly request no more boxes with non-food things inside. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/jcaFOtCVWA
Meet Carmen!	AKA: Definitely a Doggo	We’re not familiar with Carmen’s exact breed, but this baby Clip Cloppy Clydespupper dreams of one day starring in a #SuperBowl ad. You can be whatever you want, Carmen. We believe in you. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/h8gVYKJToL
Meet Buster!	AKA: Good Dog	“Buster came into our lives as a Christmas present for me and my sister, but turns out he only likes our mom.” – Buster’s Human. It’s ok, Buster, we all have favorites. Loves lakes but hates the water—is stuck in quite a pickle on that one. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/puBaWtjrGx

Meet Bogey!	AKA: Bogart	Has discovered that tiny humans make the best “Best Friends Furever.” Would do anything to keep her safe, like barking at cars as they pass by. WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING ON THIS STREET, CAR? #PuppyBowl https://t.co/nIrOtojfkc

Meet Abner!	AKA: Narf	Would like to know what we’re going to do tonight, Brain? Assumes it’s the same thing we do every night: eat the kitty’s senior-blend cat food and get stuck in a tree trying to retrieve the very greatest tennis ball ever made. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/yg3YbiOspn
Meet Teddy Bear!	AKA: T-Bone	AAKA: Theodore	AAAKA: Baby Bear	Valedictorian of his Obedience School. Secret alter ego is Santa Paws, but please don’t tell.

Meet Diego!	AKA: D-D	A Greater Swiss Mountain Doggo from Dent County, MO, Diego likes smoked meats, protecting his humans from very dangerous squirrels, and this particular car seat. It’s a good car seat, will snuggle adoringly. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/E6oXvgbt4S

Meet Sierra!	AKA: The Pupper Currently Known as Sierra	Sierra is a Professional Sunny Carpet Finder, and takes excellent snoozes in warm spots. Probably won’t share her peanut butter but is very somewhat not really sorry about that. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/uNp0LSTjjt
Meet Daisy!	AKA: “NO DAISY YOU CAN’T EAT THAT”	Recently took her @23andMe, discovered she is part pretzel, part Harrison @buttkicker7’s biggest fan. Still pretty sad the @Chiefs aren’t playing in #SuperBowl2018, could use a snuggle at your earliest convenience. #PuppyBowl https://t.co/TND6wWDci8
Meet Sadie!	AKA: Mouse	AAKA: Cat	Seems to have an identity crisis, but definitely knows she’s a Winker Extraordinaire. Sadie is a very polite and serious lady who would prefer if you would keep it down please. Also sees ghosts: NBD. Cc: @HaleyJoelOsment #PuppyBowl https://t.co/TWRxgRJAHK

Claire: "Funny that [other] small companies haven’t realized you can raise prices aggressively &amp; nobody gets too upset.”–investor
Claire: And the documents also make clear that the investors are working hand in	hand with the companies to drive up prices.
Claire: Martin Shkreli tells his investors that a certain drug will be “an annuity for some time” or a “$100M present” for investors
...and they have a whole master plan for how they go about doing so systematically.
Claire: These companies are very good at targeting drugs whose prices can be manipulated without generic competition...
...and [these new companies] do not hesitate to pursue that goal despite risking patient access, and people’s lives.
Claire: These drugs &amp; their patients [are] vulnerable to [..] a new breed of company whose primary goal is to reap extraordinary profits...

Thanks for letting us shine the #MissouriSpotlight on a “wonderful, warm community” w/ a Peculiar name! Join us again next week.
30 miles from downtown Kansas City, Peculiar boasts, “a wonderful, warm community, w/ a ‘small town’ feel” #MissouriSpotlight
Peculiar-approx 8 sq mi-has a Downtown Arts &amp; Culture District, awarded a “#MO Creative Community” #MissouriSpotlight http://t.co/2fVypjIZRC
Early settlers came to Peculiar by riverboat and rail &amp; the town was est. in 1868 &amp; reestablished in 1889. #MissouriSpotlight
You can read all about how Peculiar got its name on the city’s website: http://t.co/hJ53pA0d14 #MissouriSpotlight
(3/3)The postmaster wrote back “My conclusion…it would be difficult to imagine a more distinctive name than Peculiar" #MissouriSpotlight
(2/3)The 3 names were rejected, so they wrote “We don’t care what name you give us, so long as it’s sort of peculiar” #MissouriSpotlight
It’s said that when early settlers were deciding on a name, they sent 3 to the post office for consideration. #MissouriSpotlight (1/3)
Peculiar’s name attracts a lot of attention, including the @USNews list of “Strangest Town Names” http://t.co/gnRfwoh46S #MissouriSpotlight
Peculiar – located in Cass County – is home to apprx. 4,000 ppl &amp; goes by the motto “Where the ‘odds’ are with you” #MissouriSpotlight
What’s so peculiar about Peculiar, #Missouri? You’re about to find out. #MissouriSpotlight http://t.co/XAA5EXma9B

Claire: #MO’s Attorney General got 50x the # of complaints for illegal telemarking calls than for the next highest category of complaint.
Claire: We must give law enforcement more tools &amp; flexibility to fight these fraudsters, b/c the complaints are only increasing. #robocalls
Clare: We have to stay on top of this issue - spammers &amp; robocallers use whatever tools available to defraud American consumers. #robocalls
(3/3) Claire: This bill would allow @FCC to enforce our spoofing laws against overseas callers who direct activities to the U.S.
(2/3) Claire: The bill would give @FCC more authority, allowing it to go after non-licensed #robocall violators &amp; increasing penalties
Claire: This week I introduced the #Robocall and Call Spoofing Enforcement Improvements Act of 2015 w/ Chairman @SenatorCollins (1/3)
Claire: I’m pleased the @FCC heard our concerns &amp; offered a proposal for companies to begin offering tools to combat unwanted #robocalls
Claire: Today, #MO Attorney General Joe Dandurand joins us to explain why consumers need power &amp; choice for which calls they receive
Claire: That does not sit well w/ me - or #MO’s Attorney General, who led a letter to the FCC to clarify if companies were being truthful
Claire: Innovators have made great strides w/ call-blocking technology, but company reps insist the law does not allow them to do this
Claire: I’ve been tough on phone companies not b/c they cause the problem, but b/c they are perhaps in best position to do something.
Claire: When I talk with Missourians I often hear from them about these unwanted #robocalls

In downtown @VisitChilli, you’ll find a series of outdoor murals &amp; each celebrates a piece of the town’s history. #MissouriSpotlight
Chillicothe comes from Shawnee language for “big town” &amp; named after their Chillicothe – 1 mile from present-day city. #MissouriSpotlight

We’re glad to shine the #MissouriSpotlight this week on the charming, small #Missouri town: Tightwad!
Tightwad often attracts attention, including a 1988 @LATimes story about MO’s unique places #MissouriSpotlight http://t.co/poFHSp5yKp
As Tightwad Bank told the @WashingtonPost: “We're seeking the customers with a sense of humor” #MissouriSpotlight http://t.co/WwJRpnTggu
Speaking of the Tightwad Bank – reopened in 2008 – it caught notoriety based on its name. #MissouriSpotlight
As of 2010, Tightwad had a bank, a café, a tavern and a convenience store in their business district. #MissouriSpotlight
Tightwad’s name is said to come from a store owner charging a postman $.50 extra for a better watermelon in early 1900s #MissouriSpotlight
Located in western Henry County, the small village of Tightwad is home to approx. 60 people. #MissouriSpotlight http://t.co/ir6qQjuFz9
The town and its 1 sq mile of land, has been known for its sense of humor with street names like ‘Stingy’ &amp; ‘Miser’ #MissouriSpotlight
This week, the #MissouriSpotlight is headed to the small town of Tightwad.
