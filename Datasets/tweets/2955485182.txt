We can't afford to wait any longer to take steps to get our debt under control. This includes committing to regular order with regard to our budget process &amp; managing the entire federal budget, including mandatory payments. Delaying action &amp; looking the other way is not an option
In SD, we balance our books each year, and we have a strong economy and low unemployment because of it. High debt threatens economic growth by driving up interest rates and discouraging businesses and individuals from investing back into the economy.
Joined @sendavidperdue @SenJoniErnst @JerryMoran @SenatorLankford to introduce a resolution recognizing U.S debt as a threat to our national security. Surpassing $22T in debt should be a wake-up call to Washington, which for decades has failed to balance the fed govt's checkbook.

In the history of the world, the true test of a society is how well we treat the most vulnerable among us. A baby who survives an abortion deserves the same rights under the law as any other newborn baby and should receive proper medical care, not be left to die.

Moving forward, it is time to stop the recklessness of continuing resolutions (CR) and the threat of government shutdowns. This is no way to run a country. The American people deserve better.
I voted for today's appropriations package b/c it avoids a second government shutdown and provides the American people with the certainty of a fully-functioning federal government. It also makes a much-needed down payment on the president’s promise to strengthen border security.

We must take steps to immediately address the shortcomings of the IHS that failed the victims outlined in the WSJ/FRONTLINE investigation, and so many other tribal members for far too long.
An assessment will allow us to take a close look at the failures of the IHS so that we can work in close consultation with the tribes to immediately solve these problems and begin providing the reliable care our tribal members deserve.
IHS has a trust &amp; treaty responsibility to provide proper health care to tribal members. More on my bill here: https://t.co/jAEUPE7unt
This news reinforces the need for my IHS assessment legislation, which I reintroduced today. Tribal members have faced unimaginable horrors because IHS has failed to meet basic benchmarks for providing timely, adequate care.
The @WSJ and @frontlinepbs recent joint investigation found out Indian Health Service repeatedly ignored signs that a pediatrician on the Pine Ridge reservation was molesting Native American children. Rather than firing him, they moved him to different IHS facilities. Appalling.

Later this week, I plan to reintroduce my IHS assessment legislation, which will take a close look at the deep-seeded systemic problems within the agency so we can take action to make certain these unimaginable horrors never happen again at the hands of #IHS. Enough is enough.
Instead, the #IHS moved him from reservation to reservation, covering up decades of sexual abuse of Native American children in Pine Ridge and elsewhere. Appalling. Failing to protect these vulnerable children is unacceptable.

I also wish to thank the president for his strong commitment to defending innocent life.
I thank the president for prioritizing these important issues in his address to Congress and the nation tonight.
This includes enacting policies that further grow our economy, strengthening national defense &amp; border security, making sure all Americans have access to affordable health care, opening new markets  through strong trade agreements, &amp; improving our nation’s infrastructure.
Reminding us that much more unites us than divides us as Americans, he called on us to set aside our differences and tackle the tough issues before us. I couldn’t agree more. We all want to make our country safer, freer and more prosperous for the future.
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump @POTUS laid out a vision for our country that builds upon the successes of the past two years to further strengthen our economy and keep us safe.

Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act included measures to temporarily double exemption rate of the death tax. Permanent repeal is necessary to make sure family farms &amp; ranches will be able to be passed down for generations to come, which is why I cosponsored @SenJohnThune's Death Tax Repeal Act.
Government shutdowns and continuing resolutions are wasteful, ineffective and destabilize government programs, making them more difficult for our citizens to utilize.
Congress and the president must now work diligently on a long-term appropriations package and strengthening border security. The	senselessness of the past 35 days, coupled with another short-term CR,	underscores the need to reform the entire budget process.
I’ve said all along that nobody wins in a shutdown. I’m glad a deal has been reached on a three-week Continuing Resolution so hardworking federal employees can get paid and important federal services can resume.

Corn &amp; corn ethanol production are vital components of SD's economy. Corn ethanol has taken a hit in recent years, due in part to the high number of waivers issued by EPA to small refineries. This has reduced the amount of ethanol required by the RFS.

As the border crisis grows and more Americans are adversely affected by the partial shutdown, time is of essence. It is time to work together to find a solution that has bipartisan support in Congress and adequately addresses the president’s calls for enhanced border security.
Tonight, President Trump did an excellent job reinforcing to the American people why additional resources at our borders are necessary. Negotiators must come to the table to find a compromise that will strengthen border security and reopen government as quickly as possible.
Thank you, @SecretarySonny, for working to provide flexibility for SD producers affected by the partial shutdown. Nobody wins in a shutdown – both sides must recognize the need to compromise as we work to strengthen border security &amp; fully reopen government as soon as possible. https://t.co/GypX07VTEk

Today I watched my friend @senorrinhatch deliver his farewell address on the Senate floor. Sen. Hatch has served the people of Utah for more than 4 decades. His wisdom, experience &amp; good humor will be missed in the Senate but we wish him well in retirement!
The farm bill includes tools that can help farmers and ranchers keep their operations viable even during tough times. https://t.co/c0YtFAQlUA
At a time when farm income is down 50 percent and our producers are at the tip of the spear with the ongoing trade disputes, passage of a five-year farm bill is a critical step toward providing our ag community with much needed certainty and stability.
The Senate just confirmed my counsel, Jonathan Kobes of Sioux Falls, to be a Circuit Judge on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He will be an excellent judge, and I look forward to watching him excel in this position. My full statement: https://t.co/GJPEakDdRf https://t.co/OTLDMknyfv

He will be forever remembered for his strong faith, his love of family and his love of country. Jean and I are keeping the entire Bush family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.
Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn the loss of President George H.W. Bush. From his time as a young naval aviator who fought in World War II to serving as the 41st President of the United States during the post-Cold War era, President Bush dedicated his life to our country.
The EPA should be using their legal authority to not only restore these lost gallons, but anticipate their impact moving forward. These waivers have the potential to reduce domestic corn ethanol demand by billions of gallons, hurting SD farmers &amp; our state’s largest industry.
However, I am disappointed that the EPA did not incorporate the impact of small refinery waivers into their decision. The EPA granting these waivers has lowered the amount of corn ethanol blended into the nation’s fuel supply in recent years.
The explosion of corn ethanol production has directly helped our farmers, bolstered American energy independence &amp; created thousands of jobs. Pleased to see @EPA meet their statutory deadline with this rulemaking &amp; that they are allowing for 15B gallons of corn ethanol in '19.
South Dakota is a leader in corn ethanol production, and the RFS has provided the certainty necessary for the corn industry to become a vital component of our nation’s fuel supply. https://t.co/SsQsOI8J6z

We were glad to see the CPP rule was halted by the Supreme Court after more than two dozen states called for it to be stopped. The new proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule respects the rights of individual states in setting energy policies that work best for them.
The previous administration’s costly and burdensome Clean Power Plan was a prime example of ‘government-knows-best’ rule-making. Not only did it threaten job creation and economic growth, it was a recipe for sky-high electricity costs for American families and businesses.

Thanks to Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Jack Reed, Sen. Jim Inhofe and the rest of the committee for their leadership and hard work on this important bill. https://t.co/6FCIexS0XW
As chairman of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee I’m glad we were able to adopt a number of important cyber measures in the #NDAA. One of the most vital is a provision that will allow the DoD expanded authority to conduct cyber operations needed to help keep America safe.
It also includes a provision I offered to help military members transition into civilian life. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in nearly 2 decades &amp; this will help promote military members’ talents to employers across the country.
#NDAA includes a provision I offered that would require DoD to report the number of eligible military members able to participate in the Transition Assistance Program following their service.
The #NDAA authorizes $716 billion in defense spending, prohibits a BRAC round &amp; provides a 2.6% pay raise to military members.
The #NDAA is named in honor of Chairman John McCain. Few people are more passionate about our troops &amp; our military readiness than @SenJohnMcCain . The courage he has exhibited during his years of service - and in his current battle – has inspired us all.
This year’s #NDAA builds on last year’s efforts to provide tools to our armed forces so they can fully rebuild our military &amp; address the challenges we’re facing.
The Senate just voted to pass the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY19 w/ broad bipartisan support.

Lastly, we were able to secure a verbal commitment from the Chairman to work with us to fix an Obama-era proposal known as the ‘surplus water rule,’ which restricts South Dakotans’ access to water in Corps-controlled land. South Dakotans are legally entitled to use the water.
We were also able to secure a provision for the Corps to carry out a project for shoreline stabilization on the Lower Brule Reservation. This much-needed project will help fix erosion that is threatening an entire community and the surrounding environment.
It prioritizes implementation of the Upper Missouri River Basin snowpack monitoring program that I’ve been calling for since taking office. This program will help mitigate the possibility of a flood event for those living near the Missouri River.
Includes language to update &amp; maintain water infrastructure systems such as dams and levees, upgrade drinking and waste water systems and increase water storage to make certain all citizens have access to safe, clean water.
EPW Committee voted unanimously to pass comprehensive water infrastructure bill today, which includes a few of my priorities. https://t.co/ugqH5xml5T

Our bipartisan, commonsense bill will create new markets for producers and give consumers more choices at the grocery store, while continuing to maintain the high quality and safety standards necessary to keep consumers healthy. https://t.co/T9ZK1YCR3q
Because the state inspection programs are required to be ‘at least equal to’ or better than the federal inspection standards, products that pass state inspection should be able to be sold across state lines.
Currently in South Dakota, cattle, sheep, swine and goat products are limited to markets within the state even though they are required to go through inspection at an FSIS-approved state facility.
Today, @SenAngusKing and I introduced a bill to allow local meat &amp; poultry products to be sold across state lines. At a time of economic downturn in the ag sector, opening up new markets for SD products is critically important.

The boost we’re giving to our armed forces will strengthen missile defense, fund new weapons equipment and invest in measures to help us counter threats from our enemies such as ISIS and North Korea.
After years of underfunding, the omnibus provides a $61 billion boost in funding for our armed forces, so they can be better equipped to defend our nation.
The omnibus gives a 2.4 percent pay raise to our hardworking men and women in uniform – the largest pay increase for our troops in nearly a decade.
The FARM Act, legislation I cosponsored to exempt farmers and ranchers from reporting to EPA livestock waste emissions, was included in omnibus. https://t.co/pCl283LvAP
The FY18 spending bill provides $12 million in funding for Joe Foss Field in Sioux falls, so they can replace aging structures and construct a new aircraft maintenance facility. Great victory for SD.
RT @SenatorRounds: The omnibus bill passed by the Senate includes an additional $5 million in funding for Essential Air Service, a program…
The Brownfields program provides funding for technical assistance grants to small communities and rural areas. I’m pleased the important program was included in the omnibus bill.
The @nsuwolves_mbb won last night's game in double overtime and now move on to the #NCAA Div. II championship. Good luck and #GoWolves!
The omnibus bill passed by the Senate includes an additional $5 million in funding for Essential Air Service, a program which is vital to connecting our smaller, rural communities with the rest of the world.
I am pleased it was included in the omnibus package. This fix will protect our producers and grain operators from unintended consequences and help our ag economy flourish and grow. https://t.co/zzuobPkKiZ
I thank Senators Hoeven, Thune and others for their leadership on this issue, as we have been working with our colleagues in Congress, co-ops, independent operators and producers on a legislative fix for some time.
Omni includes fix to section 199A of the tax code. The inclusion of Section 199A in the tax law was always to maintain the status quo for the ag sector, not to give an unfair advantage to cooperatives over independent grain operators.
Last summer, I led a letter with a number of our colleagues requesting this amount be appropriated for FY2018, and we were pleased to see they agreed to this request.
Glad to see the omnibus includes $95 million for LBNF and DUNE, so the scientists at the @sanfordlab in Lead can continue their important research on neutrinos and dark matter.
SD workforce depends on temporary, H2B visa workers to fill short-term, seasonal jobs each year when employers are unable to find U.S. workers to fill them. Omnibus includes language that provides path for admin to increase # of H2B visas by 69k for FY18. https://t.co/MWHCkfJXZB

My bill, S. 465, would set us on a path to address the long standing failures of IHS. https://t.co/YxUD61DVL0
I believe that a comprehensive assessment of IHS is a necessary first step toward making calculated and systematic changes at IHS.
For many in my home state and across the country, fixing the broken IHS is literally a matter of life and death.
IHS will continue to fail unless we take a close look into the operations, funding, quality of care, and management at IHS.
While many believe that IHS is underfunded, from my standpoint, investing more taxpayer money into a dysfunctional system will only compound the problem. IHS lacks an efficient system and accountability; this needs to be addressed before we consider funding.
For years, tribal members in South Dakota have dealt with unimaginable horrors in dealing with IHS facilities.
Tune in now: @IndianCommittee is holding a legislative hearing on my bill to require a full assessment of failing IHS, first step in necessary reforms. Watch: https://t.co/6KArhEvgs2

Misguided practices at #EPA have hurt our #ag community most—burdensome rules &amp; paperwork get in way of caring for land, livestock, crops.
Currently, EPA fails to account for state/local concerns when making new rules. Skews facts to support its agenda. #WOTUS is good example.
