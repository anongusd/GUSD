Across the nation, we see a patchwork of protections, exceptions, and privileges for religion. Some states do a better job of ensuring religious equality without giving special treatment to religion over non-religion or undermining the civil rights protections and other laws.

@stormbobcat @freethinkerdojo No one is requiring an organization to do anything. It's saying that the organization isn't entitled to grant money from the government if it doesn't meet the requirements of the grant, namely to provide certain services determined by the gov't agency making the grant.
If the government declines to fund a religious provider **that doesn't actually provide the services the government wants them to provide** that is not "hostility" toward religion. That's common sense. #DoYourJob #StopKavanaugh
If the government is giving funding to organizations that provide family planning services and a religious group would like to participate, they must be required to meet the terms of the grant, like providing info about contraception or referrals to abortion providers. (1/2)
Holding religious organizations receiving tax dollars in order to provide services to the same standards as secular organizations isn't "discrimination." If they can't provide those services without discriminating, they shouldn't be receiving tax dollars. Simple. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/iEdKDryTNQ

To be clear: medically accurate and comprehensive reproductive education ALSO teaches about abstinence. But it also includes actual facts about how to use birth control, how to minimize risk, and how to have healthy relationships. This reduces unintended pregnancy and STI rates.
Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs don't JUST teach abstinence; they teach sexist and religiously-rooted notions of "purity" and compare women who have sex before marriage to "pre-chewed gum," harming young women who have been victims of sexual violence. Enough is enough.
The curricula they teach is absolutely medically inaccurate. We've found programs that distort failure rates of different types of birth control, give false information about STI infection risks, and lie about abortion and the effectiveness of the program itself. https://t.co/6AWiiYtwwd
Since the federal government switched to funding comprehensive and medically accurate programs, teen pregnancy rates have declined by a third. #FactsOverDogma #EvidenceOverIdeology
FACT: Over the last 20 years, the U.S. has spent $2 billion on abstinence-only-until-marriage programs that show no evidence of working. Starting in 2010, we switched to comprehensive sex ed AND IT WORKED. Congress is trying to turn back the clock. #EvidenceOverIdeology

@jasonrapert Turns out it's pretty easy to "prove" America is a Christian nation when you (1) cite a document that isn't the foundation of our law, (2) cherry-pick to make your guy seem special, and (3) just make shit up. Maybe @jasonrapert should study some better sources. Just a thought. https://t.co/qdAGyu7MHl
@jasonrapert Perhaps @jasonrapert means these little tablets with, again, just I to X on them? Oh, wait. The sculptor himself said they represented "ancient laws" as a whole and the Bill of Rights specifically. We're running on of options, Jason! https://t.co/XrA8BdV7rm https://t.co/CFhKhgLA9Q
@jasonrapert Oh wait, maybe @jasonrapert is talking about the frieze that's directly above the bench. It has tablets with I to X on it. Wait, maybe we can think of some other set of ten things important to American law. 		::cough:: Bill of Rights! ::cough::		https://t.co/lQ6uPtIDFj https://t.co/Oz69ZOoSYo
@jasonrapert If @jasonrapert thinks America is a Christian nation because there is a frieze in the Supreme Court that has Hebrew excerpts of a few commandments, maybe he should take a look at the opposite wall. Oops, it's Muhammad. Does this count as "creeping sharia?" https://t.co/6jYwoo4CEz
@jasonrapert And when we say "secular" commandments, we should be clear that "Don't murder" and "Don't steal" aren't exactly novel inventions of Christianity.
@jasonrapert It would be idiotic to say that one of the 18 was somehow special. It has Menes, Hammurabi, Moses, Solomon, Lycurgus, Solon, Draco, Confucius, Octavian, Justinian, Mohammed, Charlemagne, King John, Louis IX, Hugo Grotius, Sir William Blackstone, John Marshall and Napoleon.
@jasonrapert Or maybe @jasonrapert meant one of the friezes in the courtroom itself? This is the one with 18 historic lawgivers, including Moses. He's holding a tablet with portions of the secular commandments (no murder, no adultery, etc) in Hebrew. Another picture (of a small portion). https://t.co/5O8noJmMG3
There is no display of the Ten Commandments, as you claim, @jasonrapert. In the sculpture “Justice the Guardian of Liberty” on the eastern pediment, Moses holds two tablets, but they aren't inscribed with anything. See? Here's a picture. https://t.co/zWPDJIcMQE
If the founders were as determined to create a Christian nation as you seem to think, it's awfully weird that none of that is referenced in the Constitution. And the Supreme Court also has engravings of Confucius and Solon. Or do you mean the frieze with 18 historic lawgivers? https://t.co/qdAGyu7MHl

We're confident that the Washington court will reaffirm their original ruling that no business has the right to discriminate. As the couple said in their brief: ‘This case is no more about access to flowers than civil rights cases in the 1960s were about access to sandwiches.’

The 2nd Circuit held that teachers have the same right to opt out in a non-disruptive way as long as they don't proselytize their students. See Russo v. Central School District. SCOTUS denied cert. on the school district's appeal, so there is no definitive answer nationally. https://t.co/OS0ZJCKjYi
The last time this issue was in the news, we joined with attorneys from multiple other atheist organizations to warn the Bossier Parish Schools against any attempt to discipline students who elected not to stand for the anthem. https://t.co/uamlEoaWRj
But if you are a student at a public school and choose to opt out of the Pledge (as our client did in this lawsuit: https://t.co/I0YnBLjMdj) or the anthem, your school can't discipline you, harass you, or otherwise punish you for exercising your rights. #TakeAKnee

News organizations need to do a much better job reporting what the Pope actually says and not the tone in which he says it. "Love the sinner, hate the sin" is no grand act of tolerance. "Just be celibate forever!" is not an answer to the Catholic Church's record of bigotry.
@TaxNegotiator @godlessbutsunny Yeah, you're right. Fact-checking lazy reporting by quoting the Church's words is really a despicable act. Right on par with the Catholic Church spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying governments to take away LGBTQ and women's rights or covering up child abuse.
From the Catholic catechism: "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. They are contrary to the natural law. [...] They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved." https://t.co/ansV0y5a7w https://t.co/cZ6E0RvcUd
Here are the Catholic Church's own words: "The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. [...] Homosexual persons are called to chastity." https://t.co/YZBtWdahUc
The position of the Catholic Church has long been (and still is) that BEING gay is out of a person's control and not a sin. But ACTING on being gay is a sin. Don't give this pope and the church any credit for their newfound "tolerance." They're just getting better at branding.
This is not a "major shift" from Catholic teachings. Nothing has changed. The Catholic Church still maintains that all sex outside Catholic marriage and without the possibility of procreation is sinful. This is the same bigoted position, just said slightly more nicely. https://t.co/pfKgiNOox1

Perkins says the First Amendment does not protect the rights of Muslims nor Christians whose views Perkins believes are not “based on orthodox religious viewpoints.” In 2011, he said that the government shouldn’t treat adherents of “fringe religions” as equals to Christians.
It's laughable to think that Tony Perkins will be an advocate for religious freedom abroad. "Perkins is only interested in one thing: elevating his own extreme version of Christianity above all other religious views." That isn't freedom. That's Christian supremacy.
From interim executive director Ed Buckner: "Under [Perkins'] leadership, the Family Research Council has spent tens of millions of dollars attacking LGBTQ people, atheists, and religious minorities by weaponizing religion in our nation’s public policy."

@JoeMyGod @libertycounsel We're not shocked.
Our favorite part is that the bill says tax dollars can't be used to defend the constitutionality of the amendment. It's like they know they'll lose so they're preemptively heading off the "wasting taxpayer money" argument.
Alabama politicians have a tendency to waste time and money trying to put up religious monuments. Putting it in their state constitution doesn't do anything when they keep losing in federal court.
This bill would require a state ballot initiative to amend the state's constitution to explicitly say that Ten Commandment monuments are permitted on state property, including schools, as long as they comply with the federal constitution. Which is pointless.
STATE POLICY ALERT: We've submitted testimony opposing a pointless measure in Alabama that would amend the state's constitution to allow Ten Commandment monuments (but not really). https://t.co/ql1XIxX1UD

@TheTimKnight @toddstarnes So what exactly is the confusion? He thinks that school shootings are about God. Not about "politics and mental illness and gun control." He thinks they happen because we're not adequately pious. This isn't exactly reading between the lines. He says it.
@TheTimKnight @toddstarnes Are those words in quotes? No. He said, "They kicked God out of public schools," talking about the ruling in Abington v. Schempp which challenged mandatory Bible readings in public schools. He said, "we've turned our backs on [God]." Implying that people aren't Christian enough.
@TheTimKnight @toddstarnes We, um, took a screenshot. And posted it. https://t.co/qM0x1ZBueQ
And, to be clear, @ToddStarnes still hasn't said what we're lying about. We posted a screenshot of his words. He seems to think school shootings happen because kids aren't forced to read the Bible every morning. Or maybe because we're not all The Right Kind of Christian? https://t.co/cdnrHPFwba

We're poking fun at this because it's so absurd. Saying "Happy Holidays" isn't an attack on Christians. It's an acknowledgement that, as a business, you should be welcoming to everybody. "Happy Holidays" is good business. Presumably the Trump org knows this.

@mattyglesias This is the sort of question that got us into public policy.
@realDonaldTrump Saying "happy holidays" is not an attack on Christianity, Mr. President. It's an acknowledgment that the United States is a pluralistic nation. And the government picking sides on religious questions is bad for government and it's bad for churches. Do better.
@realDonaldTrump Happy holidays.
If you're more offended by "Think critically about what your pastor tells you" than by "If you don't believe like we do, you're going to be brutally tortured for eternity," we have questions about your moral compass.
We'll be charitable. Sure. Maybe this pastor hasn't put up billboards threatening us with hell. He just preaches it as a cornerstone of his religion. That's way better!

"Fake news" is a real problem. We all should do a better job of thinking critically about the things we're being told. Especially when the things we're being told involve talking snakes, virgin births, and walking on water.
We think (and hope) that everyone knows that the fables in holy books aren't real. If you no longer believe in them, you don't need to keep dragging yourself and your family to church.
The message this year, as always, is that you can celebrate the holidays however you damn well please. You don't need religion to spend time with family and friends, give gifts, do charity, or have a community.
It's that time of year! Holiday billboards are going up right now in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico! https://t.co/yW1frWP2hz https://t.co/dwPI7stJ1v

Repealing the #JohnsonAmendment would open the floodgates of secret, unaccountable, dark money flowing through churches into politics.
In 2015, Americans gave $119 billion to churches and religious orgs. 2016 federal election spending: $6.5 billion.
If just ~5% of the money Americans donated to churches was diverted to politics, it would equal the total of 2016 federal election spending.

@adidas4680 But they can't be enforced. If you live in a state with it still on the books, talk to your elected officials about removing it.
@adidas4680 Obviously we'd like the laws to be removed (imagine if they said Jews or Baptists couldn't hold office!) because of the message it sends.
@adidas4680 We can. Despite those laws being on the books in seven states, the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in Torcaso v. Watkins (1961).

@EmilyRo94906765 We agree. Thank you for hearing out perspective. Take care.
@EmilyRo94906765 Those disagreements about religion should take a distant back seat to making public remembrances inclusive for all. #unity
@EmilyRo94906765 Yes. We disagree on one (important) thing, and that's why it's important all are represented when unity is needed. Thanks for hearing us.
@EmilyRo94906765 It is true. Organizers for Pulse shootings welcomed atheist speakers. But in Boston, a city with 1/3 nonbelievers, no atheist allowed.
@EmilyRo94906765 Literally all we're asking is for events to be fully inclusive. That's all. Not to the exclusion of religious folks, but inclusion for all.
@EmilyRo94906765 This isn't hypothetical. This has happened repeatedly. In Boston, official event had many faith leaders, multiple Christian. No atheist.
@EmilyRo94906765 And we're asking organizers to ask. But we experienced this after Boston Marathon bombing. Humanist chaplain at Harvard was turned away.
@EmilyRo94906765 Just as you'd feel excluded by vigil or service completely devoid of prayer, we are excluded by events with ONLY theistic prayers.
@EmilyRo94906765 We didn't say exclude prayers for the religious. Just ALSO include an atheist or humanist chaplain to speak to nonbelievers as well.
@MrKangDangaLang @Brycedimsdale @MrAtheistPants There are often "official" events for this where elected officials speak and community leaders are invited. That's who we're speaking to.
@MrKangDangaLang @Brycedimsdale @MrAtheistPants Because government entities, colleges, etc. are often the ones organizing them. Or, if it's churches, they reach out to other denominations.
Everyone should be able to mourn &amp; grieve together. If you're hosting a community event, please make sure it includes the whole community. https://t.co/VtbId41lqK
@MrKangDangaLang @Brycedimsdale @MrAtheistPants We're not criticizing, in any way, their right to grieve and find comfort however they want. Simply saying their way isn't universal.
@MrKangDangaLang @Brycedimsdale @MrAtheistPants The problem is that right now is when these events are being planned. We're not saying DON'T include religious folks, just don't EXCLUDE us.

@katydid_alot We hope so. Include theistic and nontheistic worldviews. Try to offer comfort to all.
@katydid_alot Families, loved ones, community members. If a single person feels excluded from the mourning, that's one person too many.
@katydid_alot Include people of all faiths, including none, in these events. We've spoken to organizers who never considered the issue until we raised it.
@katydid_alot Not about us. It's about comfort for all mourners, including the likely 1/4 who aren't religious. That's the point of uniting. Include all.
@freethinkerdojo We're not criticizing. We're offering suggestions and resources for people organizing events to consider something they may not have.
@freethinkerdojo Fine. But having heard first hand from people after the Boston Marathon bombing &amp; Pulse Shooting who were affected, we have to speak up now.
@freethinkerdojo We're not offended. But this is important for those affected by events like this. We're offering constructive feedback to organizers.
@freethinkerdojo This happens constantly. We've worked with organizers before, told us they hadn't considered it, thanked us for raising the concern.
@freethinkerdojo And they can offer their comfort that way. Just ALSO include someone else if you're organizing a community event. This isn't complicated.
@freethinkerdojo If the only comfort being given is from scripture, statements about god's plan, you don't see how that rings hollow to atheists?
@freethinkerdojo Did we say "don't include the religious?" No. We said that if you're going to try to speak to everyone, don't leave out 1/4 of people.
You're right. It isn't about us. It's about the 1/4 of mourners who are atheists and nonbelievers and making sure they're supported. https://t.co/pMzLXl4Z4v
Language is imperfect. "Vigil" / "interfaith" are commonly understood. What's more important is being inclusive in the program itself. https://t.co/4GHTZyPRaL
Important to recognize: Atheists are part of every community. Addressing only the religious at times like these excludes 1/4+ of mourners. https://t.co/FuFA5HNi5l
If you're organizing events, making it "interfaith" &amp; only including religious leaders isn't enough. PLEASE reach out to atheists/humanists. https://t.co/jBt9umN6C1

@notforthem Unfortunately, based on the information we have seen, this appears to have occurred at a private, not public, school. Not unconstitutional.

@electro_chino @deedeemarz The fact that you have to specify why they're kneeling means it is exactly context specific. Not profane on its face. Precisely the issue.
@electro_chino @deedeemarz If you're offended by kneeling, it's context specific. Therefore not vulgar. Vulgar has a specific meaning to the Court. Try again.
@kylegriffin1 We just sent a letter warning Bossier Parish Schools that we're prepared to sue if they don't rescind their policy. https://t.co/5ls4cJaVyr
@electro_chino @deedeemarz Go learn the law &amp; try again. Vulgar speech is not protected in schools, see Bethel. Symbolic speech (arm bands, kneeling) aren't vulgar.
@electro_chino @deedeemarz Thankfully, your completely arbitrary standards of what's "okay" don't matter. Student taking a knee is non-disruptive, therefore protected.
@electro_chino @deedeemarz When you said detention is free speech (?), you lost all credibility to lecture on this issue. But read Tinker. Symbolic speech is speech.

@hemantmehta Probably not the exact admission numbers, but rather sales figures. The rebate is on all sales tax paid at facility (tickets, books, merch)
(6/6) Our guess? They don't want to disclose their ticket sales. They don't want the us to be able to fact check their attendance claims.
(5/X) So why doesn't the Ark Encounter want to tack on this surcharge? It's not them paying the fee. It's ticket purchasers. Like sales tax.
(4/X) When we were researching, we caught the same clause in the Tourism Development Agreement RE changes in ownership voiding incentives.
(3/x) But there is nothing in state/fed law that requires it. City council confirmed at Tuesday meeting they'd rewrite to cover Ark.
(2/X) There is no constitutional requirement that nonprofits be exempt from local taxes &amp; fees. The initial draft had an exemption for them.
We've been talking w/ many at the city regarding the "safety fee." Trivially simple to re-write ordinance to cover nonprofits. (1/X) https://t.co/q15yAETr6l

@niclmatt We were speaking only to the initial passage of the law. We did not take a position when that was being debated. Hope that clarifies.
@niclmatt We absolutely oppose the changes proposed to the regulation because of the discriminatory impact plus the religious exemptions.
We take no position on passing the law itself. The problem is when you start granting religious exemptions for some things, not for others. https://t.co/G8Rlyo67nb
This is government saying religious objections to contraception are reasonable or appropriate, but objections to blood transfusions aren't. https://t.co/G8Rlyo67nb

@craigfhayes @BRGHFan Bottom line: We don't give exemptions to JWs who objected to insurance covering blood transfusions, why birth control?

Only 1 of this list is a "reason" to attend church. And that reason is to "test [God's] claims." We've done that. That's why we're atheists. https://t.co/2TF3QPiDMS
These "reflections" are nothing we haven't heard 1000x before. Still going to skip church. #AtheistChristmas https://t.co/dF2dsgngJD
