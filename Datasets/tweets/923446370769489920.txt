Fascism @senatemajldr ignores external costs, such as pollution. This makes goods cheaper and  more accessible. It also depletes natural resources and lowers the quality of life in the affected areas.
Fascism (@senatemajldr ) only aids those who align with the national values. They may use their power to rig the system and create additional barriers to  entry. This includes laws, educational attainment, and capital.
The others are viewed as extraneous or an unnecessary drag on  prosperity. They may be viewed as bad for the genetic pool and  sterilized.
Trump and @senatemajldr (Fascism) either ignores or attacks those who don't aid attainment of the  national values. This includes minority groups, the elderly, the  developmentally challenged, and their caretakers. It attacks groups that  it blames for past economic ailments.
6/ Government Surveillance: The government takes an active role in suppressing dissent. It rewards people who report on each other.	7/ Persecution: The state violently persecutes minority groups and opponents.
5/ Mass Appeal: The leader claims that the people,  manifested as the  state, can achieve anything. If they don't succeed,  it's because of naysayers, minority groups and saboteurs.
4/	Father Figure: The leader assumes the role of the father of the  nation. He creates a cult status as a "dauntless ruler beholden to no  one."
2/ Nationalism:  Leaders appeal to a nostalgic wish to return to an earlier golden age.  That can include a return to a simple, virtuous pastoral life. 	3/ Militarism: They glorify military strength through propaganda.
1/ Fascist regimes (@GOP, @senatemajldr , @VP, and @POTUS have these seven characteristics:  	Usurpation: The state overtakes and merges with corporate power and sometimes the church.
