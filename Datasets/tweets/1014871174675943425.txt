If I were Jesus...I would give #XiJinPing the whole continent of Africa as a gift. I would say, “here son, have this land RICH in natural resources “.  Of course, I can’t do this because I AM not God 😁. 	That’s what they tell me. They tell me I AM not Jesus.
It Is supposed to say cute.
Hmmmm Jimin, for some reason you look extra cure.
I waited an hour before going to California to tell him I was going. Hehehehe...that was funny. 	That was my finest moment in our relationship. 😁
And he’s proud of it. And he doesn’t care if he embarrasses me in one of his jealous episodes.
Crazy jealous man 😞 👉🏻 Jimin. Is there any hope for him. Probably not.

Printing money provokes inflation and inflation provokes starvation. 	If Trump is considering printing money 💰 to pay for the wall, this action will initiate a Venezuelan crisis right here.
We don’t print money to fund government projects. 	🌈☁️	That’s a myth.	Instead we have a few go-to countries that happily buy millions upon millions of bonds 	💵💰💵💰	They know each failure to pay increases the probability of a surrender of the US territory to satisfy the debt.
Everyone knows we will sell foreign governments our federal bonds to fund the wall construction. 	The ones we always borrow money from.	👩🏻‍🔬	The wall won’t render any profits so I don’t know how the USA can repay the debt.
Hmmmm Well, building the wall only to tear it down would be a great way to increase work opportunities.	👀	But... it will “dig” the USA further in debt with foreign countries increasing the chances of a takeover to pay the debt.

Sometimes People run away, obstruct, etc. Because they don’t want to be sold into slavery. Victimless crimes are truthfully just mere infractions and not crimes that don’t require law enforcement involvement. These procedural violations are actually under civil jurisdiction
Victimless crime warrants, indictments, tickets, including the act of a police or sheriff shackling a person and transporting them to a detention facility, all 4 objects are slave deeds issued to the government in exchange for 💰.  Government officials are the slave masters.
Instead of calling them plantations, they are called @CACorrections @CorrectionNYC @CorrectionsPA @AZCorrections 	On state legislators purposefully/maliciously passed victimless crime laws in order to fufill the demand for inmates. Statutes are not actually crimes but slave deeds
The inmate’s existence in your jail is a business transaction involving human life. 	The term slavery is synonymous with the term human trafficking. 		Only your slavery/human trafficking is unconstitutionally legalized and approved by our US government.
Your activity violates the 14th Amendment because your prisons and jails are overflowing with victimless “crimes”. 	Example,Person drove without car insurance but doesn’t have the money to pay the fine. The person is forced to exist in your detention center which renders you 💰.

We must not have any hindrances to the flow of money and commerce, domestic or foreign. 	The purpose of mergers in America is to be able to compete in global markets. 	GM move to Mexico was a sound fiscal decision and saved the company from a future of 100% American jobloss.
I think it’s ok to accept their contributions to a campaign. 		As long as the corporation understands the candidates platform and there is a clear understanding between the two that the candidate will adhere to those goals without corruption.

GOP = Gangsters of the Public
The urge and ability to defend oneself is inherent. An urge that obeys the laws of nature. The laws that are more powerful than the @GOP . 	This idea of propaganding hate and abuse without provocation doesn’t produce a better world but mass destruction.
@GOP doesn’t respect the US Constitution in any way. 	They are brute  savages pretending to live in the Stone Age and successfully convincing their voters unprogressive and destructive behavior towards all people outside of the supposed “Aryian” race.
I have been told that the electoral college is a deterrent for many voters that believe their vote doesn’t count because the electoral vote opposes their popular vote.	@nprpolitics https://t.co/mZQD1kIIl5
That’s last year’s leadership. Now it’s half the leaders. 	New leaders are actually respecting our Constitution’s mandate of freedom of religion.	@AJEnglish https://t.co/uXvfe0YnPV
🤣 Socialism at its core belief, is an ideology of how the government and the people it represents interact with each other while all sharing the same worldview.	FairShare tax is not socialism. We can all have different opinions and pay the same tax. 	It’s common sense economics
I think 25% tax rate is good and fair. Keep all the credits for things like going green, having kids, education etc. Corporations should get credit for donations, going green, keeping jobs in America, etc.
Representatives from Congress all come from states that require a fair, flat tax rate on all sales in their states.	💰	But when other members want to do this same thing on the federal level, they immediately start slamming it with words like “socialism” and “big government”.	🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/lVjd8OId5T
When a billionaire buys a wild caught fish sandwich meal, he/she will pay the same sales tax as the middle class customer. Income and corporate taxes should be handled the same way. https://t.co/0aT9Kvo6bK
I took this picture in the #CapitolBuilding in Washington D.C. 	I love my friends but we don’t agree on every single political issue.  Like, I believe in a FairShare tax system.

@iamcardib Cardi B always looks so cute and classy in all her videos. Giving good sex to a man is the brown woman’s section of expertise. Video shows this. Stress is relieved, serotonin released, the relationship bond becomes stronger, etc. @STEPHMHAMILL
@iamcardib @STEPHMHAMILL if you listen to the lyrics, the song talks about the power of a woman to please her man sexually. The song also explains a woman’s success and financial independence. There are men rapping and singing about their power to please his woman sexually. Video is great.
How did the German military turn on their own people (Not only Jews were murdered) and then murder their surrounding neighbors? I will tell you there are high ranking military officers ready to be in compliance with any dark orders given to them. They are ready.
Anything that looks even remotely like decisions that were made to cause WWI and WWII should be squashed immediately.
I AM not like anyone else. I AM myself. I only repeat words of Jesus’ Holy Spirit. No movement, only warnings.
Proponents of the wall know this. This is what they want. Ushering in the dark era of WWI and WWII is the Goal and they have key puppets to bring about this dangerous change.
The “wall” is not a symbol of national security but a symbol of regression. Time travel back to the days of division and darkness experienced in Europe this past century. It is a very dangerous step towards great suffering for the American people. The wall is the door to downfall
