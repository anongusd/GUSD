We boarded the same shipment of dirty palm oil at sea off the coast of Spain, and delayed it by 36 hours https://t.co/yisoYbkgDj
But they haven‚Äôt. So we‚Äôre drawing to attention to this massive shipment of dirty palm oil products (owned by Wilmar) to let @Oreo‚Äôs customers know that you can‚Äôt trust all their promises.
Mondelez (who make @Oreo cookies) and other brands committed to drop rainforest destroyers from their supply chain. Which means it‚Äôs time for them to stop doing business with Wilmar.
10 years ago, Wilmar promised to clean up their act and only buy palm oil from producers who commit to respecting the environment and human rights by 2020. But they haven‚Äôt kept that promise.
Producers sell this dirty palm oil to traders like Wilmar who in turn sell it to customers like @Unilever, @Nestle, and Mondelez (who make @Oreo cookies) https://t.co/mgnpw5IHxf
Palm oil can be grown sustainably. But  rather than do that producers cut down and burn beautiful rainforests, destroying the habitats of orangutans and violating the human rights of their workers and the people who live there https://t.co/VeAkBW9MC8

@FemNurse @Ritzcrackers @Dove @Colgate Palm oil is a very land-efficient crop (ie. you get a lot of oil per hectare) but we need to use it wisely and it cannot come at the expense of rainforests.
@FemNurse @Ritzcrackers @Dove @Colgate However, the solution isn‚Äôt to drop or ban all palm oil. If we push all consumer goods companies to stop using palm oil, demand would switch to another vegetable oil such as soya or rapeseed, therefore the problem would shift somewhere else.

"...with profound implications for everyone who lives there, whether they know it or not. And they are a reminder of one of the great truths about climate change, and one that is hardest to grasp: In our rapidly changing world, no place is too distant or too far away to matter.
"As the Arctic heats up, it raises sea levels in Miami and Bangladesh and every other coastal city, and it increases the odds of wildfires. In a sense, the massive changes that are taking place in the Arctic are remaking the weather in America and northern Europe...
"Think of the Arctic as our early warning system, a big screaming alarm that is alerting us to the fact that the planet we will live on tomorrow is nothing like the planet we lived on yesterday, and we better get ready.
