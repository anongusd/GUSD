Insider tip: A Hollywood habit that drives everyone who works for CIA bonkers is calling us agents		In the real-world lexicon of spies:	Americans who work for CIA are called “officers”	Foreigners who give us intel (the actual “spies”) are “agents”		~Molly		https://t.co/YM7nOrGwaU

Dear Film Buff 007,		All Hollywood films &amp; TV shows, of course, take liberties when portraying CIA. I can’t generalize &amp; say “this film is accurate” &amp; “that film is total bunk.” They all probably contain some elements of truth &amp; fiction.		https://t.co/YM7nOrGwaU		#askmollyhale https://t.co/9SDbeXzRZH

Looks like the Wakandan tech w/the most votes is: Virtual cars.		Our CIA scientist, “Rebecca,” says she’d be most excited for Kimoyo beads.		Curious about her take on what Wakandan tech could become real-life tech? Check out: https://t.co/B0iV7cufqA		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
Which fictional Wakandan technology would you most like to see made real in the future?		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther #Oscars
Sand Tables:		The ability to remotely manipulate objects from a distance &amp; physically interact w/data or temporary items would allow people, including intelligence officers, to get hands-on w/information &amp; work together from different locations.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
Panther Habit:		Rather than suits for superheroes, in the real world people are interested in nanoparticles for biotech &amp; medicine, but the world’s spy agencies might like outfits that could reform on the fly in order to foil surveillance.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
Lesotho Blankets:		One of the least plausible technologies in #BlackPanther, but if you could weave carbon nanotubes into a cloak &amp; add in some hologram effects, you’d have a shield that would be the envy of any intel service operating in a warzone.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
Holograms:		They’re real-life hot tech right now &amp; as they improve, intel practitioners in the future could incorporate holographic displays for operations or holographic projections to illustrate situations to the President or other policymakers.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
If real, which of these Wakandan technologies do you think would be the most appealing to real-world spies?		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther #Oscars2019
The magic metal from #Wakanda might not exist, but there are real-life materials that possess some similar qualities to those of the fictional Wakandan isotope, #vibranium.		To learn more, see: https://t.co/B0iV7cufqA		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
The #vibranium in Black Panther’s suit protects him from kinetic damage, &amp; vibranium sneakers are both super-quiet &amp; amazing shock absorbers for jumping. Those would be great for spies, right?		Too bad vibranium isn’t real.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther
In #BlackPanther, a unique metal called #vibranium helped the fictional African nation of #Wakanda become the most technologically advanced country on the planet.		#ReelvsRealCIA #Oscars		Do you think vibranium is:
During tonight's #Oscars we’ll ask a series of poll questions to get your views on the feasibility of Wakandan technology today &amp; share the expertise of a top CIA scientist, “Rebecca,” on how #Wakanda’s tech matches up w/emerging “real life” tech.		#ReelvsRealCIA #BlackPanther

Flames leapt 30 feet into the air from the 3-story apartment building next door.		A young child was trapped on the roof, screaming in terror.		The officer—barefoot—scaled the outside of the rough sandstone building.

#Navajo Code Talkers were used in every major @USMC operation in the Pacific theater. Their primary job was to transmit tactical info over telephone and radio. At the invasion of Iwo Jima, six Code Talkers operated continuously and sent more than 800 messages. #NAHM https://t.co/zbu8SwQNus
The initial #Navajo code consisted of 211 vocabulary terms, which expanded to 411 over the course of the war. You can read the entire dictionary of terms here:		https://t.co/DZrhbhpLZL
#Navajo was the perfect option as a code because it is not written and very few people, who aren’t of Navajo origin, can speak it. However, the U.S. Marines took the code to the next level and made it virtually unbreakable by further encoding the language with word substitution.
During the course of #WWII, about 400 #Navajos participated in the code talker program. The first 29 recruited arrived at Camp Elliott in May 1942. One of their first tasks was to develop a Navajo code from their native language. Code protected valuable #intelligence.

Vernon's linguistic skills afforded him a myriad of opportunities. His simultaneous translation of a speech by Nixon in France prompted President Charles de Gaulle to say, "Nixon, you gave a magnificent speech, but your interpreter was eloquent."
Vernon loved #languages and enjoyed a friendly competition with fellow #linguists. He would engage two others in conversation and each time a person spoke, they had to talk in a new language. Once you ran through your repertoire of languages, you were eliminated.
President Nixon appointed General Vernon Walters as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in 1972. Vernon spoke French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Chinese and Russian fluently.

Strategic Priority 6: Invest more heavily in our counternarcotics effort abroad. 		Narcotics have killed more Americans than any terrorist group. No foreign threat has had a more direct &amp; devastating impact on families &amp; communities than the flow of opioids &amp; other drugs into US.
Strategic Priority 5: Build stronger partnerships at CIA across US Government, IC, &amp; with our foreign counterparts as well.		Teamwork is the only effective way of dealing with the range of complex global threats.
Strategic Priority 4: Investing in foreign-language excellence as a core attribute for our officers.		We’re strengthening our language training to ensure that our people are more capable &amp; better attuned to the cultures in which they operate.
Strategic Priority 3: Steadily increase the number of officers stationed overseas.		Our mission—as a foreign intelligence agency—lies abroad, &amp; having a larger foreign footprint allows for a more robust posture.
Strategic Priority 2: Invest more heavily in collecting against the hardest issues.		CIA’s heavy emphasis on counterterrorism is vital, but we are sharpening our focus on nation-state rivals as well.

DCIA Haspel: “Every year, the anniversary of 9/11 is a time for both reflection &amp; renewal. It’s a time to remember not only the lives we lost, but also the resilience of the American people, the strength of our values, &amp; our determination to stand up to terrorism.”

Interested in more myths &amp; facts about us?		Check out the full list of 10 myths:	https://t.co/ICCDmgeUrD
Myth: The CIA makes foreign policy.		Fact: CIA does not make policy; it’s an independent source of foreign intel for those who do. We collect, evaluate, &amp; disseminate foreign intel to the president &amp; senior US government policymakers so they can make informed decisions.
Myth: The CIA has law enforcement authority.		Fact: The public often confuses @FBI responsibilities with CIA’s. We don’t have law enforcement authority. CIA’s responsibility is to collect intel &amp; information overseas.
The National Security Council, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, &amp; the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, provide guidance &amp; oversight.		Internally, the CIA Office of Inspector General detects &amp; deters fraud, waste, abuse, &amp; mismanagement.
Myth: The Agency operates independently &amp; is not held accountable to anyone.  		Fact: The CIA is responsible to the American people. We operate in accordance with oversight from US elected representatives.
CIA officers work as scientists, support staff, engineers, economists, linguists, mathematicians, secretaries, accountants, inventors, cartographers, architects, psychologists, police officers, editors, graphic designers, auto mechanics, historians, museum curators, &amp; more!
Myth: All CIA officers recruit &amp; handle agents.		Fact: Only some officers recruit &amp; handle agents, which is the job of an operations officer. The number of employees at CIA is classified, but the variety of careers here is similar to major corporations.		https://t.co/acebqeWxty
So, who is a CIA agent? 		Our operations officers recruit well-placed human agents with access to secrets. These recruited spies are agents. Agents/spies are invaluable. They provide critical information about their country to help America.
Myth: People who work for CIA are spies &amp; agents.		Fact: US citizens who work for CIA are officers, not agents or spies. All employees, from operations to analysts, to librarians &amp; public affairs, are considered CIA officers.
Let’s debunk some misconceptions people have about CIA &amp; the women &amp; men working here.

Director Haspel Welcomes Additions to Leadership Team		https://t.co/RGvyGzNnpR https://t.co/A0k4lhO6kI
As part of DCIA Haspel’s leadership team, Bishop brings decades of experience &amp; wisdom.		“I’ve always believed CIA is a unique &amp; special place,” says Bishop. “I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to serve as a steward of this great institution.”		https://t.co/v7zucWbsYH
As CIA’s new Deputy Director, Vaughn Bishop brings to the office a contagious enthusiasm &amp; love for the work, an uncanny ability to inspire, a 35-cent framed picture of FDR, a photo of golfing with friends in Scotland, &amp; countless pictures of his grandson.
Throughout his career, Bishop held a number of expert-level analyst &amp; senior management positions across a diverse range of regional &amp; functional mission areas. He also led his share of crisis response teams.
Bishop’s leadership philosophy is encompassed by a simple saying:	stop, look, listen, learn		It’s how he approaches every new assignment. Bishop believes that the importance of listening cannot be overstated &amp; is a valuable leadership trait &amp; one that is too often underused.
A major Agency reorg in the early 1980s required Bishop to choose a distinct career path: social science methodology or a regional expertise. He chose Africa.		But his passion for analytic methods, teaching, &amp; exploring new tools of inquiry stayed with him throughout his career.
Bishop’s first assignment with us was in a small unit where his job was to drive the need for &amp; value of social science methodologies in the art of analysis. “…a much harder sell in 1981 than it is today.”
After doing his dissertation field research in Kano, Nigeria, Bishop was looking forward to a life in academia &amp; began his teaching career at @EmoryUniversity. But a CIA job advertisement caught his eye &amp; changed his fate. He began his 30+ year CIA career in 1981.
Born in Indiana to parents who had grown up on farms in the rural Midwest, Bishop attended @NorthwesternU where he earned a bachelor’s &amp; master’s degree in political science &amp; a PhD in political science &amp; African studies.
DCIA Haspel &amp; DDCIA Bishop believe close collaboration &amp; communication across directorates is critical to fulfilling the CIA’s mission. As Bishop likes to say: managing between the white spaces on the org chart, the spaces between the directorates, is a powerful force multiplier.
Bishop is thrilled to work with his colleague &amp; friend, Director Haspel, again. Years ago, when DCIA was a senior operations officer, &amp; Bishop a senior analyst, they worked together on difficult missions from opposite sides of the Agency directorate structure.
Meet Our New Deputy Director:	https://t.co/v7zucWbsYH		Vaughn Bishop never imagined that one day he would be asked to serve as Deputy Director of CIA. “Then again,” says Bishop, “at no point in my career did I ever cease to be amazed at the opportunities offered at CIA.” https://t.co/h8KT1gbcV0

Asked what lesson guided him throughout life, Dungy said: “If you really want to do something good, do something that helps others. Don’t look for sympathy. Look for what you can do to make the situation better. To be good at what you do, you have to be able to reach everyone.”
JB &amp; Coach Dungy also hosted a discussion with the workforce about the coach’s philosophy on leadership, team building, dealing with setbacks, &amp; living an “uncommon” life.
During their visit to CIA, Coach Dungy &amp; JB met with officers from CIA’s Talent Center to discuss opportunities &amp; challenges related to diversity and inclusion, as well as how to dispel common misperceptions about CIA to potential candidates.
The CIA Speaker Series was established in 2014 to provide CIA officers with the opportunity to hear leadership insights from private industry and national security thought leaders.
Last week we hosted Tony Dungy, former head coach of the @Colts &amp; @Buccaneers, &amp; James “JB” Brown, from @NFLonCBS for a CIA Speaker Series event.		https://t.co/UgL2EwtYLb https://t.co/k923bP3ZOP

Working closely with @FBI, the op also seized computers that contained details of another terrorist plot.		3 months after Africa bombings, a federal grand jury in NY charged Bin Ladin w orchestrating them &amp; conspiring to commit other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
Within days of the bombings, 2 Bin Ladin associates were arrested &amp; charged w the attacks.		CIA officers at a small station had received word the terrorists were fleeing to their country of operation &amp; quickly put together an op that lead to the terrorists’ arrest &amp; imprisonment.

When France announced its intention to detonate a hydrogen device, the IC sought to gather info about the their nuclear test area in the Mururoa Atoll, French Polynesia.		@USNavy used the USS Ranger. Mission was codenamed Operation Fish Hawk.
Modifications took 7 months &amp; required retraining of pilots to fly the modified bird, a U-2G, teaching them how to land this already peculiar &amp; challenging airplane on a pitching flight deck.		1st landing without damage took place on 2 March 1964.		https://t.co/2jkXtGTrT8
The fragile U-2 needed airframe reinforcement, strengthened landing gear, an arrestor hook like other carrier-based aircraft, &amp;“spoilers” on the wings to cancel the aerodynamic lift once the aircraft flew over the carrier deck. https://t.co/SR7kMlEG6M
A U-2 lifted off from the deck of the USS Kitty Hawk without catapult assistance or incident, but its landing was a different matter. The expected “bounce” when the aircraft hit the carrier deck damaged a wing. https://t.co/LQBLFtXhpy
U-2 was designed as a land-based aircraft, so launching it from a moving, narrow carrier flight deck posed several problems.

Happy #IndependenceDay America, from the women &amp; men silently serving around the globe🌏 https://t.co/22AvM9oRcD
In the late 1990s, a US petroleum company restored Glomar &amp; used it for actual deep-sea oil drilling and exploration.		Project AZORIAN remains an engineering marvel, greatly advancing deep-ocean mining and heavy-lift technology.		https://t.co/13qAYTPoef https://t.co/ZLTOnSr1Sd
Among the contents in the recovered section of K-129 were the bodies of six Soviet submariners. They were given formal military burial at sea &amp; DCI Robert Gates presented a film of the burial ceremony to Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992. 		https://t.co/9KW8Kz89dp
During the lift, when the sub was a third of the way up, it broke apart, &amp; a section plunged back to the ocean bottom. 		Much of what was retrieved is still classified; however 2 nuclear torpedoes were found in the recovered part of the Soviet sub.
July 31, 1974: Clementine touched down on the ocean floor, sending up a cloud of mud that obscured visibility for half an hour.		Aug. 1, 1974: Clementine &amp; a 132-foot sub hull section, weighing as much as a WWII-era destroyer, began a more than 3-mile ascent. https://t.co/WBSGSzvOB8
Sailing from Long Beach, CA, the Glomar Explorer arrived over the recovery site on Independence Day, 4 July 1974 &amp; conducted salvage operations for more than two months under total secrecy—despite much of the time being monitored by nearby Soviet ships curious about its mission.
Glomar would conduct entire recovery under water with specially built capture vehicle, Clementine, in complete secrecy. Clementine would be positioned to straddle the sub, &amp; its powerful jaws would grab the sub’s hull. https://t.co/lPgzJiyvry
The cover story: Glomar Explorer, a commercial deep-sea mining vessel "built" &amp; "owned" by billionaire Howard Hughes was conducting marine research at extreme ocean depths &amp; mining manganese nodules. https://t.co/lPLuSghtlM
CIA’s mission: recover the 1,750-ton, 132-foot-long wrecked sub from more than 3 miles below the ocean surface… in total secrecy. 		1970: CIA engineers &amp; contractors concluded the only solution was to use a large mechanical claw to grab the sub &amp; lift it.
March 1968: Soviet sub K-129, armed with nuclear ballistic missiles, sinks.	May 1968: US located sub about 1,500 miles NW of Hawaii.	Recognizing the value of the intel on Soviet strategic capabilities that would be gained if the sub were recovered, CIA agreed to lead recovery. https://t.co/W68l4f7AIh

Although the story of TRIGON ended tragically, the intel Aleksandr passed to Marti &amp; CIA gave US policymakers valuable insights into Soviet foreign policy plans &amp; intentions. Insights &amp; courage like this helped win the Cold War.		https://t.co/5XU7SONtVn		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/X1WfG9HOgI
From Marti’s memoir, The Widow Spy: “Opening the pen as if to begin writing, he bit down on the barrel &amp; expired instantly in front of his KGB interrogators. KGB was so intent on his confession they never suspected he had poison….TRIGON died his own way, a hero."		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/KIhVYd0Y3x
We later learned that on 22 June 1977, Aleksandr had killed himself after KGB arrest with a pill hidden in a pen he had earlier requested &amp; CIA reluctantly provided.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/jax5Pti0ps
A KGB surveillance team was waiting &amp; seized Marti. They took her to Lyubianka Prison, where she was questioned for hours &amp; photographed with the espionage paraphernalia she &amp; TRIGON used.		She was declared persona non grata &amp; sent back to the US immediately.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/5YPS3P7SLG
15 July 1977: As night fell over Moscow, Marti left a concealment device in a narrow window inside a stone tower on the Krasnoluzhskiy Most—a railroad bridge near Lenin Central Stadium.		It was a trap. 		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/nkRGbJAClY
June 1977: A Czech penetration of CIA gained knowledge that TRIGON was working with us; info which he passed to Czech Intel who notified the KGB.		#ReelvsRealCIA
TRIGON’s position in the Global Affairs Dep’t gave him access to incoming &amp; outgoing classified cables to embassies worldwide. He provided sensitive intel about Soviet foreign policy plans &amp; objectives.		His reporting went to the President &amp; senior US policymakers		#ReelvsRealCIA
Marti used a purse to conceal supplies &amp; equipment that she transferred to TRIGON via dead drop exchanges.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/vSmUOg6zyK
Because meeting face-to-face was dangerous &amp; complicated, TRIGON &amp; Marti instead used:	-signal sites	-radio messages	-concealments	-car drops 	-dead drops – like fake bricks &amp; dead rats		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/SXgeYQOo70
Moscow was a challenging place to operate in 1974. Even finding one’s way around was difficult as Soviet-produced city maps were deliberately inaccurate.		https://t.co/3ppWnl3H0p		For the nearly 2 years they worked together in the 70s, Marti &amp; TRIGON never met.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/48hnYYdfIZ
One of the first female CIA case officers to serve behind the Iron Curtain, Marti Peterson, went to Moscow to be TRIGON’s handler. At the time, the KGB discounted the ability of women to conduct intel operations, so Marti went unnoticed for almost 18 months.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/pGhza6kHtm
October 1974: TRIGON returned home &amp; agreed to continue spying, but asked that US government resettle his then-pregnant girlfriend.		#ReelvsRealCIA
In anticipation of his recall to Moscow, CIA officers taught TRIGON operational trade-craft &amp; techniques. He also received training in secret writing, the use of one-time pads, &amp; dead drop techniques.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/K7JJvaIzU9
CIA recruited Aleksandr in South America in 1973 &amp; gave him codename TRIGON.		He smuggled docs to CIA officers who would photograph them. Material he provided gave unique insights into Soviet’s Latin America policies, including plans to influence other governments.	#ReelvsRealCIA
Aleksandr Ogorodnik, a mid-level official in Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) posted in Latin America, had access to information about Soviet intentions for the region. While he enjoyed his life in Latin America, he found the Soviet system oppressive.		#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/vPiS8ae3rk

Ian Fleming died in 1964, a month before the 3rd Bond film "Goldfinger" was released. While he was able to witness the initial success of his creation, he probably never dreamed his character would still be going strong over 50 years later.		https://t.co/vzPhXVpwOu	#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/ElWa2Kcb2b
In 1962, “Dr. No” was the first Bond movie. Since then, the James Bond franchise has become the longest continually running series in film history. There has been more than 25 films made associated with the character. They’ve grossed over $7 billion in revenue.	#ReelvsRealCIA
Using his #WWII experiences, Fleming completed his 1st book “Casino Royale.”		He wanted a boring &amp; nondescript name for his main character. Looking around his library, he came to a reference book entitled “Birds of the West Indies” by ornithologist James Bond.	#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/z5zPCG9PZE
After #WWII, Fleming decided to move to Jamaica &amp; drawing on his family’s income, he built a home for himself.  He called it “Goldeneye.”		Fleming told friends he had always wanted to write a spy novel &amp; now with time on his hands, he did exactly that.	#ReelvsRealCIA https://t.co/VVnmpN0Fzb
When #WWII broke out Fleming found his true calling &amp; a love for espionage in Britain’s Naval Intelligence Division. He became part of a team working with “Wild” Bill Donovan to help write the blueprint for the new Coordinator of Information, which became #OSS.	#ReelvsRealCIA
Born to a wealthy family on 28 May 1908 in London, Fleming was an undisciplined student &amp; often clashed with his teachers even when earning high marks for his schoolwork. He eventually landed a job with @Reuters, but also tried banking &amp; stockbroking.	#ReelvsRealCIA

As there was no sign, the driver had great difficulty finding the entrance, upsetting the President. The next day, Eisenhower called Dulles &amp; ordered a sign be placed at the entrance.

Eloise was the first woman to serve as the Deputy Director of the IC staff &amp; Chairman of the Critical Collection Problems Committee, responsible for allocating collection assets on critical problems facing the United States.
With hard work &amp; dedication Eloise became a case officer &amp; in the 70s, our first female Chief of Station. She also became an expert on terrorist organizations.		Throughout her impressive career in the DO, Eloise rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the DO’s No. 3 officer.
#WWII: Eloise served as #OSS Director “Wild Bill” Donovan‘s secretary, where she learned business of espionage &amp; developed passion for intel work.		1945: she moved to Brussels, Belgium to help open first post-war station &amp; eventually became one of CIA’s first employees in 1947.

Jeanne blazed a trail at CIA at a time when it was an overwhelmingly male enterprise.		Remembered as a driven, focused officer who demanded excellence &amp; was always devoted to the mission, Jeanne's life &amp; legacy has forever impacted CIA.		https://t.co/Bw4lfemwyb https://t.co/jruA1NbUz7
Jeanne had reached the mandatory retirement age in 1992 but immediately returned as a contractor to see the investigation through to its completion.		She was a true CIA icon &amp; legend. Serving our Agency for 58 years, working until just prior to her death in 2012.
The @FBI took over the investigation &amp; used surveillance to build the case against Ames. He was arrested on February 21, 1994, with further incriminating evidence discovered in his house &amp; on his home computer.		Ames plead guilty &amp; is serving a life sentence in federal prison.
Ames’ extravagant lifestyle came under the task force’s suspicion in November 1989. 		In August 1992, Sandy Grimes (who was on the team) discovered Ames made large bank-account deposits after every meeting with a particular Soviet official.
Extensive reviews of records showed Aldrich Ames, who worked in Soviet Division counterintel, began spying for USSR in 1985. In his job he was authorized to meet w Soviet officers for official purposes. 		However, he compromised numerous Soviet assets, some of whom were executed.
Jeanne returned to lead a five-person investigative team searching for answers as to how this troubling loss of assets happened. The task was long &amp; exhaustive, complicated by the fact that many didn’t think it was a mole, but intercepted communications instead.
Spring 1985: after an alarming number of Agency assets run against USSR disappeared in rapid succession, Jeanne received a cable from the Soviet/East European Division Chief.		She later recalled: “He said, ‘…I have a Soviet problem….I want you to work on it.”
Jeanne joined CIA as a typist in 1954. As professional opportunities for female officers slowly began to grow, she earned assignments at various posts overseas. She also learned Russian &amp; found her niche in counterintelligence.		CI @ CIA: a Brief History	https://t.co/sqf1471xZJ

As the first woman to rise from the ranks to Deputy Director—&amp; now the first to be nominated as CIA Director— Haspel says she owes her success to the colleagues she has served with, the mentors, role models, and close friends who supported &amp; believed in her throughout her career.
Haspel is a DO veteran, but her assignments over 3 decades have brought her into close partnerships w officers across CIA.		"Getting to work with these officers is the greatest part of the job," she says. "They are the silent warriors who work ceaselessly to protect America."
Before being named CIA Deputy Director in 2017, Haspel held a series of senior jobs, including Chief of Staff to Deputy Director for Operations, Chief of Station in city of a major US ally, &amp; Deputy Director of DO.		She leads w compassion, integrity, discipline, &amp; humor. https://t.co/9YpzUY7R7i
As the fight against al-Qa'ida heated up, Gina requested transfer to our Counter Terrorism Center		Her first day on the job was September 11, 2001		She walked in amid the commotion, sat down at a computer, &amp; got to work. She didn't let up for 3 years, often working 7 days a week
In addition to the arrests, her operation also culminated with the seizure of computers that carried details of a terrorist plot. 		For her work, Haspel received the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in Counterterrorism.
One night, Ms. Haspel received word 2 terrorists linked to an embassy bombing, were coming to the country where she was stationed. She swiftly put together an operation that lead to the terrorists' arrest &amp; imprisonment.
Haspel’s first posting as a Chief of Station soon followed in an exotic &amp; tumultuous capital.		The skepticism of some of her male colleagues was obvious, w comments like, "I can't believe they're sending you to a place like that."		She quickly proved doubters wrong.
Later, Gian's facility with languages landed her a job overseas during the first Gulf War, where she worked on humanitarian issues with other government partners.
Haspel recalls the initial shock of witnessing grinding poverty &amp; the excitement of carrying out a clandestine mission amid billboards plastered with Marxist-Leninist slogans. She traveled the region, learned to recruit &amp; handle agents, &amp; survived a coup d'etat along the way.
Haspel’s first overseas assignment was as a case officer in Africa. "It was right out of a spy novel. It really didn't get any better than that." She arrived during the closing days of the Cold War and had a front-row seat as the struggle played out.
DDCIA: "I wanted to be part of something bigger than just me. I think with my dad's service in the military, I saw that as a natural affinity. I wanted an overseas adventure where I could put my love of foreign languages to use.  CIA delivered."
After college, Gina worked at Ft. Devens running the library &amp; foreign language lab. Soldiers (including Mike Vickers, future USD for Intel), mentioned CIA to her.		She came to understand that CIA was a place where women could serve doing clandestine work around the world.
Her parents instilled a deep love of country &amp; a commitment to public service. In high school, Gina came home &amp; told her dad she wanted to attend @WestPoint_USMA. Her dad had to tell her they didn’t admit women at the time.		The pull of service &amp; adventure, however, stayed w her.
Gina, born in Ashland, KY, was oldest of 5 children. Her father served in @usairforce &amp; after growing up overseas, she went to @universityofky, studying language &amp; majoring in journalism. She moved to Louisville her senior year for an internship &amp; graduated from @uofl w honors.

When Harriet Tubman died in 1913, she was honored with a military funeral in recognition of her work during the war. https://t.co/XklNnSfJG6
On the morning of June 1, 1863, Harriet led Col. James Montgomery &amp; his men in the attack. The expedition hit hard. They set fires &amp; destroyed buildings so they couldn’t be used by the Confederate forces. The raiders freed 750 slaves.
Gen. David Hunter requested Harriet personally guide a raiding party up the Combahee River. She was well prepared for the raid because she had key information about Confederate positions along the shore &amp; had discovered where they placed torpedoes in the water.
During the Civil War the Union Army asked Harriet to gather a network of spies &amp; was tasked with leading expeditions to gather intelligence. She reported intel to Union officer commanding 2nd South Carolina Volunteers, a black unit involved in guerrilla warfare activities.
Harriet Tubman was not only a conductor of the Underground Railroad, but also a spy for the Union.		https://t.co/a40t1Mrc9R		#HarrietTubmanDay	#WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/Kc2CDM5d3r

⚡️ “The story of two women who lived in a mansion on CIA grounds for decades”		https://t.co/ZlU0cPngFY
Margaret &amp; Florence built their lives together in the house for over 50 years. Memories of the women &amp; the house are forever ingrained in our history.	 	Today CIA employees enjoy using the quiet &amp; historic space for conferences &amp; meetings.		https://t.co/9GT98schmE https://t.co/12cmYReX8W
In 2003, the house underwent a complete renovation to become a state-of-the-art conference center. No rooms were added during the restoration &amp; the foundation was untouched, although the porch was enclosed. https://t.co/IpuOsjz1ae
Over the next several years, while the numerous proposals for what to do with the property were debated &amp; funding applied for, CIA Security Protective Officers (SPOs) slowly took over the main house &amp; brought with them their K-9 unit.
Margaret suffered a stroke &amp; passed away at the age of 92 on November 7, 1986—over 25 years after CIA began operating out of Langley. https://t.co/USscBkpaBt
Margaret did visit CIA HQ once, in 1984, when she was the guest of honor at a lunch w Director Casey.		Over  the years, several Agency officers also befriended her &amp; would stop  by to help w yard work &amp; grocery shopping. On holidays, DDA Fitzwater would bring her holiday meals. https://t.co/PfQcflKf0U
1984: Managers of the New HQ Building construction project inquired about the feasibility of infringing slightly upon Margaret’s property to expand some roadwork around Headquarters. Respecting her privacy, the CIA’s Office of General Counsel responded with a firm ‘no.’ https://t.co/enaG8ttfqe
1980s: Margaret, a pacifist, opened her home to Sandinistas from Nicaragua, while CIA had been authorized to support to the Contras. More than once, Sandinistas arrived at the CIA’s main entrance only to be redirected to the Calvert Estate.
1973: Florence passed away, at age 95. CIA DDA at the time, Harry Fitzwater, grew concerned for Margret’s safety and health &amp; instructed CIA security officers to check on her &amp; make sure she was alright. https://t.co/8Q6lcX2wZe
1950s: CIA Director Dulles began looking for a location for a new HQ building, one that would offer a campus-like setting, afford security, &amp; privacy. The land surrounding the Calvert Estate fit the bill.
Margaret &amp; Florence had been living on their estate for 15 years when @USDOTFHWA acquired 742 acres around them for a research facility. Being proactive, they made an agreement to an upfront purchase of their property, but they could remain living there until they passed away.
The 5,000 square-foot house consisted of four stories that included a large attic &amp; basement for storage. The porch was one of the women’s favorite places to sit &amp; listen to the small stream trickling across their land. https://t.co/BV2zmVL84a
Margaret &amp; Florence purchased the house &amp; 20 acres of land in 1933. They dubbed it, “the Calvert Estate,” in tribute to Florence’s distinguished lineage – her mother was a direct descendant of Sir George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore of Maryland.
1926: Margaret moved to DC to work for the American Federation of Labor (AFL) where she met Florence. They both worked @ AFL until they retired &amp; are credited w significant contributions to labor movement, including advancing women’s rights in the workplace &amp; child labor laws.

Helge was with CIA only a short time, but his talent, tenacity, &amp; presence of mind under fire earned him the respect of those far senior to him in experience.		He is honored with a star on our CIA Memorial Wall.		https://t.co/kWREInZgjN 		#inmemoriam https://t.co/IdiQ7J5G59
Helge, just 32 years old, was the second CIA officer to die in the line of duty in Afghanistan. He was survived by his wife, brother, &amp; parents. He was posthumously awarded our Exceptional Service Medallion for his outstanding performance, courage, &amp; sacrifice.		#inmemoriam
Early 2003: Helge volunteered for his second TDY to Afghanistan. 		Helge Boes was killed when a grenade detonated prematurely during a live-fire training exercise on a weapons-training range, while he was preparing for an intelligence collection operation.		#inmemoriam
Long hours &amp; cramped, primitive conditions were the norm. Helge completed his assignments w skill &amp; courage. He was close to the intelligence he needed to collect &amp; closer still to the dangers that came with the job: rocket, mortar, &amp; machine gun attacks.		#inmemoriam
As a newly graduated operations officer, Helge wanted to be on the front line of the Agency's response to terror, so in the spring of 2002 he volunteered for duty in Afghanistan - one of the first in his peer group to do so.		#inmemoriam
In only a few months, Helge showed poise &amp; skill that normally comes in years. He combined intelligence with charm, humor, &amp; concern for others. Equally at home in the classroom &amp; on the athletic field, he was a standout among the trainees of our Clandestine Service.		#inmemoriam
Helge joined CIA in January 2001 as a trainee in the Directorate of Operations Clandestine Service Trainee Class. It was a perfect fit. His gift for languages, an instinctive sense for people, &amp; a curiosity about the world, made it a natural fit.		#inmemoriam
An outstanding soccer player &amp; gifted with an agile mind, Helge studied political science at @GeorgiaStateU where he graduated in December 1992. In June 1997, he graduated from @Harvard_Law &amp; worked as an attorney in the corporate world in Atlanta.		#inmemoriam
A US citizen born in Hamburg, Germany, Helge grew up in West Berlin &amp; felt the impact of world affairs personally. Friends said that, for Helge, the choice between freedom &amp; tyranny was as stark as the concrete &amp; barbed wire that split his city in two.		#inmemoriam
On FEB 5, 2003, Helge Boes – a special ops officer who had served in the CIA for 2 years – was killed in a training accident while in Afghanistan. At the time of his death, Helge was the 80th CIA officer in 56 years to die in the line of duty.	#inmemoriam		https://t.co/kWREInZgjN https://t.co/mlIpY1YyS0

In the field, X-2 operated its own comms channels &amp; field bases. X-2 also had clandestine liaison relationships w services in liberated France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark &amp; Norway.	X-2 Branch’s #WWII successes informed CIA’s approach to counterintelligence.	https://t.co/ttIGnRbEoH
Watch List Unit monitored mail &amp; written comms for names &amp; cover names of enemy agents.		Insurance Unit monitored Axis intel ops carried out under insurance cover.		Art Looting Investigation Unit tracked records of stolen art &amp; jewelry as a means of tracking German officers. https://t.co/RtyAoM1Gyp
By 1945, X-2 had amassed hundreds of thousands of files on foreign espionage &amp; sabotage that included the identities of foreign agents &amp; firms used as cover by hostile services. Units within X-2 addressed specific CI functions.
As the CI Division’s work grew along with the need for the #OSS to build counterintelligence networks of its own, on June 15, 1943, Donovan reconfigured it into a branch-level office called X-2.		In September, the main X-2 Branch office moved from New York to Washington.
Due to volume of traffic &amp; need for compartmentalization, Brits insisted #OSS set up a separate, extra-secure component to handle material. So, Donovan created the Counterintelligence Division in the Secret Intelligence Branch, which conducted espionage operations in war zones.
Early in #WWII, British began supplying #OSS with extensive information about foreign military, espionage, &amp; sabotage activities, the most sensitive of which came from ULTRA—decrypted intercepts of German military messages sent with the Enigma machine. https://t.co/GxHPL4ca71
Before #WWII, US didn’t have military, intel, or colonial interests outside Western Hemisphere requiring a large-scale effort to protect clandestine operations. Security &amp; counterintelligence ops had been undertaken as needed by @FBI, @USArmy’s G-2 branch, &amp; Office of Naval Intel
OTD 1943: #OSS Director “Wild Bill” Donovan created the Counterintelligence Division in the Secret Intelligence Branch—the 1st centralized, national-level CI office in US intelligence history, &amp; predecessor of the CIA’s Counterintelligence Mission Center.		https://t.co/ttIGnQU3x9 https://t.co/YLhdZIKMI1

Tamarah: I want to be known, remembered, &amp; respected as an engineer that found synergies across directorates, found ways to optimize performance, &amp; contributed to achievements that resulted in major operations against hard target countries.
Kennedy: I want my legacy to be one that emphasizes my dedication to mission &amp; to my colleagues. I hope to continue to grow &amp; thrive here thanks to the many sacrifices of the African American women who came before me here, many of whom faced so much more than I will ever have to.
Chloe: When I retire from the Agency, I want to leave a legacy of black excellence that reminds people that we are capable of doing phenomenal things for this Agency &amp; for this country if given the opportunity.
Aliyah: It’s up to each officer to create an environment that fosters collaboration &amp; trust for people who have vastly different backgrounds, experiences, &amp; disciplines, but are all joined together by the same mission: protecting this great nation.
Kayla: Having a voice that is different from the majority is the best thing I can contribute to the Agency.
Kennedy: Before CIA, I was a historian, a singular position, but CIA is all about the team &amp; you have to know how to apply your strengths &amp; strengths of others to get the job done. You’ll be amazed at who you meet – cartographers, linguists, computer engineers, rocket scientists.
Joshua: After working in the private sector &amp; completing my Master’s degree in engineering I applied to CIA. It was one of the best decisions of my life because of the opportunities &amp; experiences I have had. I have been a part of something nothing short of amazing.
Kayla: I never imagined myself here, but it seemed like the perfect chance to become a part of something bigger than myself. CIA has a global reach &amp; the thought of having a chance to contribute to that mission motivated me to join the CIA.
In honor of #BlackHistoryMonth, we asked current African American officers of different ages, backgrounds, &amp; years of service to discuss why they chose CIA &amp; the legacy they hope to leave behind. Here are excerpts of their reflections.		https://t.co/TAlwLHm7sH https://t.co/RBj9CCO4dO
During his tenure as Director, Dulles approved the development of U-2 spy plane &amp; conceived &amp; oversaw construction of our Original Headquarters Building in Langley, Virginia. He is the longest serving director in CIA’s history.
Dulles joined #OSS during #WWII where he directed intelligence operations from Switzerland &amp; helped bring an early end to the Allied forces’ Italian campaign in 1945 saving hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.		He joined CIA in 1951 &amp; became CIA Director on 26 February 1953.

40 women were prosecuted in West Germany over the course of the Cold War for committing espionage. Many hearts were broken, including those of several Romeos who truly loved their Juliets. Several couples fell genuinely in love, married, &amp; started new lives.
While many women terminated the relationship when asked to spy, others fell in love not with their Romeo, but with the excitement of espionage. Their Romeos were just part of the process.
By this point in the relationship, some women had fallen in love &amp; agreed to spy to keep their affairs going; some relationships lasted for decades. For those who fell in love with their Romeos, their espionage careers ended when the affairs did.
Initially, most women were naïve about the true intentions of their Romeos; however, as the relationship developed, Juliet began to suspect that her Romeo was working for the other side. Most were not shocked when they were asked to spy for their men.
Romeo spies were warned not marry their assets even if they developed genuine feelings for them (which many of them did) because West German authorities conducted background investigations of anyone seeking marriage to a government employee with access to classified material.
Romeos were trained in espionage, given false identities, &amp; sent to West Germany. Once there, they identified a potential “Juliet” with access to the info they were after. They created a chance encounter, began an affair, &amp; finally asked the women to pass them secrets.
After #WWII many West German women took jobs in business, government, parliament, military, &amp; intel often having access to highly classified secrets. Thus they became targets for East German male spies interested in only one thing: secrets.	These men were nicknamed “Romeo Spies.”
While most think of female temptresses when they hear the term "honey trap," men too have been used as honey traps to steal secrets. For example, in West Germany during the height of the Cold War.
One of the best known seductresses was Mata Hari, a Dutch exotic dancer convicted of spying for the Germans during WWI. She was accused of being a double agent &amp; obtaining intel by seducing prominent French politicians &amp; officers. She was tried, convicted &amp; executed in 1917. https://t.co/8oWpeU1yLg
Long before current traditions of #ValentinesDay sprang forth, spymasters worldwide have used the amorous arts to obtain secrets from their enemies. Known as “honey traps” or “honeypots,” rivals ensnared their adversaries in a game of love, lure, &amp; lies.		https://t.co/xcv7zGvjcJ

DCIA Pompeo: “We do have some capabilities offensively to raise the costs for those who would dare challenge the United States elections.”
DCIA: CIA did not provide any resources to these 2 individuals who proffered US gov info, directly or indirectly at any time. The info we were working to retrieve we believed might have been stolen from US gov, unrelated to this idea of “kompromat” that appears in recent articles
DCIA Pompeo: Reporting on this matter has been atrocious &amp; inaccurate. The suggestion CIA was swindled is false. It’s our view that the same two people who were proffering phony information to the US government, proffered the same phony information to those two reporters.
DCIA Pompeo: We should all remember that Kim Jong Un's sister is the head of the “propaganda &amp; agitation department.” Our analysts are concerned that Kim Jong Un is not hearing the facts from his advisors about the "tenuous nature" of his position.

In 1967, Jack retired &amp; moved to Ketchum, Idaho, his father's last home &amp; burial place. There he taught languages, pursued his passion for fly fishing, &amp; wrote two autobiographical books. 		Jack died on December 1, 2000, at age 77.		https://t.co/hiROlzOczz	#OSS75 https://t.co/GphB8nyZAg
Jack married Byra Whittlesey in Paris, France on June 25, 1949. Julia Child, another #OSS veteran (https://t.co/q3cC4QAkGr), was maid-of-honor.		They had 3 children.		Jack worked as a stockbroker &amp; then as a fishing supply salesman. https://t.co/ypoj5b1AJw
Jack was released from @USArmy in November 1945. He flew to Cuba to visit his father, then to Utah to ski w Gary Cooper &amp; Clark Gable. 	He enrolled @umontana, although he never graduated. But while in Missoula, he decided one day he would settle down in the mountains out west. https://t.co/rwq4KYkRh7
Jack received Croix de Guerre from the French for his wartime service &amp; was awarded the Bronze Star Medal from @USARMY Commander for meritorious service in direct support of combat operations. https://t.co/u5LOGvw20t
#OSS described Jack as resourceful, courageous, &amp; self-assured enough to be an excellent ops officer. But, his new assignment to carry out secret missions in Far East was canceled @ end of #WWII &amp; he was made commanding officer @ German POW camp at Camp (now Fort) Pickett, VA. https://t.co/ra4ax5z0G5
Jack was given priority status to London, where he was debriefed by X2, OSS’s counterintel section. After reporting to #OSS HQ in DC, he was given 2 months of leave &amp; nearly 9 months of back pay.		When war started, Jack weighed around 210lbs. He now weighed under 140.
After 10 days of marching nearly 12 miles a day they arrived in Stalag VII-A.		April 29, 1945: the POW camp was liberated &amp; Jack linked up w former #OSS colleagues. They hitched a ride to @USArmy HQ where they checked in w OSS. https://t.co/RMM3gz5unM
Once, after an exhausting day of marching &amp; desperate for nourishment, Jack found a small stream. He decided to try &amp; catch a fish with his bare hands. He was successful in grabbing a seven inch trout. He &amp; 2 others ate well that night.
After several days of running, Jack was recaptured &amp; sent to Nürnberg. Shortly after arriving, camp was evacuated. As prisoners marched, they were mistakenly fired on by US pilots. Germans had prisoners lay on ground &amp; spell out “US POW” to avoid more friendly-fire.
Jack hoisted himself up onto a tank. It didn’t take long for 1st ambush. Jack escaped, but hadn’t gotten very far when he heard the explosion of American tanks being blown up by Germans. None of the 50+ vehicles survived the mission.
March 1945: Task Force Baum liberated POW camp. However, they only anticipated 300 POWs, not the 3,000 looking for rescue. Officers were able to ride on top of vehicles, the rest were told to walk 50 miles to American lines. Most were too weak to walk &amp; elected to stay behind. https://t.co/dZmzCVOrpu
One day after roll call, a German soldier asked Jack if he was related to Ernest Hemingway. Jack admitted he was. The soldier then confessed he was an admirer of his father’s work &amp; stated he had been an American Literature professor &amp; had taught Ernest’s writings.
During his interrogation it was revealed that the German commander’s girlfriend had once been Jack’s nurse when he was a child living in Austria. The questioning ended w a toast of Schnapps to the woman.		Jack was still sent to a POW camp for officers near Hammelburg, Germany.
October 1944: while on an assignment to recruit, train, &amp; infiltrate agents through enemy lines, Jack departed for a safe-house in enemy territory.		As he neared destination, German mountain troops opened fire &amp; he was hit 3 times in right arm &amp; shoulder before surrendering.
An avid fisherman, Jack packed his fishing rod w mission supplies. 		When officer in charge told Jack he was not permitted to jump w a fishing rod, Jack responded it was an antenna disguised to look like a fly rod.
Jack’s 1st mission was to parachute into Nazi-occupied France, behind enemy lines, to help w communications &amp; to act as liaison w local anti-German resistance. He also armed &amp; trained them &amp; helped resistance impede German movements in the area.
3 weeks later, Jack reported to #OSS training camp in Algeria. He was one of the youngest teachers &amp; one of the few who hadn’t seen action prior to instructing.		Students were given fake names upon arrival &amp; were never permitted to discuss backgrounds. https://t.co/VyXydI0NlW
While inspecting a military installation overseas, a commanding officer asked Jack if he could teach weapons training in French &amp; of course he could.		Officer told Jack if he volunteered for hazardous duty, he would process Jack’s application outside of regular channels.
At 19, Jack left @dartmouth to join @USArmy where he was assigned to the Military Police &amp; attended Officer’s Candidate School. His prior readings &amp; knowledge of military helped him graduate in top 10% of his class.
Jack grew up surrounded by some of the most fascinating people of 20th century: artists, poets, musicians, &amp; writers, to include Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, &amp; Gertrude Stein.		Fluent in French, English, &amp; Austrian, his language skills would earn him a position w #OSS. https://t.co/TUmaTUfc7P
Jack Hemingway: The Son Also Rises		https://t.co/hiROlzOczz		The debut novel of Ernest Hemingway, the great 20th century writer, was titled “The Sun Also Rises.” It was dedicated to his wife &amp; son, John Hemingway, known as Jack.		During #WWII Jack Hemingway served w #OSS.	#OSS75 https://t.co/zicdQyEKy5

We hope you have enjoyed following our good dogs through their training this fall, if you have missed any “tails” in our #CIAK9 series, you can play catch up here:		https://t.co/e5EZqBYbkA https://t.co/phqTvJh3iz
As new graduates were ready to receive official graduation certificates, veteran dogs &amp; handlers made their way to the back of the room, where handlers changed leashes from their old partners to their new: a passing of the torch to next generation of CIA explosive detection K9s. https://t.co/P9cYLjMuEB
Retired dogs sat quietly, heads held high, a wise calm much different than boisterous puppy antics displayed by the younger, soon-to-be K9 graduates. The crowd, made up of family, friends, &amp; colleagues cheered for the veteran dogs as they were honored for their service. https://t.co/qaSCCp2cfA
During the graduation ceremony, the handlers &amp; their retiring dogs were presented with a CIA plaque &amp; shadowbox containing photos, their badge, &amp; other mementos in honor of their service to this country. https://t.co/7FglpmYai6
Osmond, 9 yr old golden Lab, was one of the last CIA dogs to graduate from @ATFHQ program. He's won numerous K9 Explosive Detection awards &amp; has served overseas many times. He’s a silly, sweet, loyal dog who is excited to share his home w his newest buddy, K9 Freya. https://t.co/Uoo2O0OL7i
@ATFHQ Lucy, 9 yr old black Lab, spent 3 years traveling around the US promoting @PBBassociation, before joining CIA. She’s worked in challenging locations overseas 6 times, protecting lives &amp; property for us.		Lucy &amp; her new pal K9 Indigo love to play &amp; roughhouse together. https://t.co/enMcHxTdFo
Gears, 8 ½ yr old black Lab, was in very 1st class that graduated from #CIAK9 Training Center. Before we had our own training program, we trained at @ATFHQ.		Gears spent over 750 days overseas during his career. He enjoys hanging out w his new protégé &amp; housemate, #K9 Nicole. https://t.co/gLR5RFrDRR
After working together 7 days a week for 8 yrs, it’s hard to separate a team. Almost all of retiring dogs are adopted by their handlers. If a handler can’t adopt, option is given to another CIA handler. As K9 officers love them so much, dogs hardly ever retires outside the unit. https://t.co/L3mjEyKPTC
Each of the 3 CIA handlers in the fall 2017 “puppy class” had a current #K9 partner.		Tradition has it that on the day handler's new K9 partner graduates, their old K9 partner retires. Most of our dogs work for about 7-8 years.		All 3 retired K9s were adopted by current handlers. https://t.co/bt94JZiyL4
Suni’s family who raised her until she was 1 ½ asked to adopt her if she didn’t complete our program. She is now w her original family, who were thrilled to get her back! We miss the smart, silly, sassy Lab, but are so happy that she gets to live in such a wonderful, loving home. https://t.co/BwaqMeSU9t
Due to circumstances beyond his control, Suni’s prospective handler was unable to finish the fall 2017 class, which also meant Suni couldn’t finish. No other #CIAK9 handlers needed a new K9 partner right now, so the decision was made to allow Suni’s puppy raisers to adopt her. https://t.co/qNokCu9HEB
@ATFHQ @fredcova Harry—who joined in week 5 after Lulu left program—had a lot of catching up to do to graduate. We’re thrilled to report he passed all his certification tests &amp;  graduated w the class! Harry, who shares a home w his buddy Lulu, is a proud member of @fairfaxpolice. https://t.co/GgnXtcNZwv
@ATFHQ CIA K9s Nicole, Indigo, &amp; Freya all passed their certification tests!		Freya &amp; her handler were awarded class’s “Top Dog Award” for scoring 298.68 out of 300 points on her #USPCAk9 test.		Heide, who belongs to @fredcova Fire Marshal in Virginia, aced her certifications as well. https://t.co/21N86kMfnE
To graduate, pups &amp; handlers had to pass 2 national certification tests: one administered by the @ATFHQ &amp; another by United States Police Canine Association (#USPCAk9). The tests are the gold standard for explosive detection dog certification. https://t.co/s8kJ6LkAhF

Did all six pups make it through advance training? Next week we'll let you know in our final pupdate!		If you have missed any “tails” in our #CIAK9 series, you can catch up here: https://t.co/e5EZqBYbkA https://t.co/s7wSiiGb5w
Eventually, pups will search multiple rows of cars w only a single "hot," as well as several rooms containing no target odors. This helps teach them to pace themselves to increase endurance for long searches; an essential skill for any explosive detection K9 team. https://t.co/FJE1FFvtsP
Search patterns are different &amp; it can take dogs a while to learn that searching something like a car or an entire warehouse can be productive – finding a hot target &amp; getting a food reward.	To keep pups motivated, trainers start dogs out w easy search patterns &amp; multiple “hots.” https://t.co/m432OiZ1A7
It can be challenging for pups to transition from searching can-lines, cement blocks, &amp; luggage to larger items &amp; arenas. https://t.co/BkzbAfonrB
Training exercises get more difficult as teams prep for final tests &amp; graduation.	Trainers create simulated exercises for pups &amp; handlers to practice &amp; refine skills searching in different environments.	Recently, teams practiced a variety of vehicle &amp; room searches. https://t.co/32tOb73sIX
For #CIAK9 officers, working side-by-side w a dog, doing work they’re passionate about &amp; that makes a difference for our nation, is an honor. Gravity of the work our teams perform daily in order to protect CIA &amp; our country makes the job rewarding, but also extremely challenging. https://t.co/4KDXhc64T9
Having a dog for a partner is a unique experience – different than working w a human partner &amp; different than having a pet dog.	“You literally take them everywhere you go: into every establishment you go in to, on planes next to you, into war zones. It’s an amazing experience.” https://t.co/CXLhkJqtuD
Lead #CIAK9 Trainer:	“Watching an experienced K9-handler team should look like a dance. Handler should move through search area w a smooth, fluid, rhythmic motion, presenting w their hand productive areas for dog to search”	It helps w pace of search &amp; keeps pup interested/focused https://t.co/Aa6Dvqo9VD
Pups transition from working w trainers to their new handlers can be a challenge for both.	Handlers are used to working w their soon-to-retire dogs. 	Pups are used to the trainers. 	It’s like changing dance partners &amp; can take a while for the new partnerships to get in sync. https://t.co/CrXte2UP8Q

@USNavy @OregonState Robert signed on to fly for CAT in June 1948.		He was 31 years old when he made the ultimate sacrifice.		3 weeks after he was killed, his wife gave birth to their daughter, the couple’s only child.	#inmemoriam https://t.co/D7m0x7KZEQ
Robert Snoddy first took up flying in 1940 under Civilian Pilot Training program in Oregon.	He joined @USNavy in 1942 while studying aeronautical engineering at @OregonState 	He went on to serve as a Navy pilot in the Pacific.	#inmemoriam https://t.co/aNd0ijWj4m
@USMC February 1948, Norman left @USMC to fly for Civil Air Transport (CAT)–a CIA proprietary company.		He piloted CAT aircraft for 4 years before tragedy in November 1952.		Norman was 29 years old when he died in the line of duty. He was survived by his parents &amp; siblings.	#inmemoriam https://t.co/cC33kCaC1v
Norman Schwartz was raised in a working-class neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky &amp; was 5th of 7 siblings. As a teenager, his No. 1 priority was learning to fly.		He joined @USMC in 1943, &amp; became a fighter pilot in Pacific theater during #WWII.		#inmemoriam https://t.co/AsAFcmz6zS
Downey &amp; Fecteau survived. The men were captured, tried, and imprisoned by the Chinese. Fecteau was not released until December 1971; Downey was freed in March 1973.		Read &amp; watch their story here:		https://t.co/45Y3Jeg3zq https://t.co/Y5kLI3KNOK
As plane came in low for pickup, flying @ only 60 knots, gunfire erupted. Norman &amp; Robert directed aircraft nose up in wake of deadly crossfire, preventing immediate crash.	Engines cut out &amp; plane glided to a controlled crash.	Both Norman &amp; Robert died at the scene.	#inmemoriam https://t.co/xaFfqVg5br
Two other CIA officers, John Downey &amp; Richard Fecteau, were on board the plane to hoist the agent into the aircraft.		But unbeknownst to the team, they were about to fly into a trap – the agent on the ground had been turned by the Communist Chinese.		#inmemoriam
Pilots Norman &amp; Robert volunteered to fly their C-47 w a hook extended out the plane’s back door to snag a line between two upright poles on the ground. Agent would be connected to line by a harness. Once hook caught the line, agent would be snatched off the ground.	#inmemoriam https://t.co/KF2pk9FR5D

We’ll miss Lulu, but it was right decision for her &amp; we wish her all the best in her new life!		https://t.co/nPZl6YWNKb https://t.co/Mbcr9C7wUY
Lulu was adopted by her handler &amp; now enjoys her days playing w his kids &amp; a new friend, &amp; sniffing out rabbits &amp; squirrels in the backyard. https://t.co/WOImM75P1D
When a pup is removed or retires from our K9 program, the handler &amp; their family is given the chance to adopt them &amp; many do. https://t.co/EMfua7zhbT
Our trainers’ top concern is physical &amp; mental well-being of K9s.	They made difficult decision &amp; did what’s best for Lulu: stop her training https://t.co/Ss9y9LpE9q
Lulu wasn’t interested in searching for explosives.	Even when motivated w food &amp; play, she was clearly no longer enjoying herself. https://t.co/puvhDk1tRX
For some dogs, after weeks of working w them, it’s clear the issue isn’t temporary &amp; instead, this just isn’t the job they are meant for. https://t.co/bBjPz8Ng2U
Sometimes a pup is bored &amp; needs extra playtime, sometimes they need a little break, or it’s a minor medical condition like a food allergy. https://t.co/pPaBPohhqB
There are a million reasons why a dog has a bad day &amp; our trainers must become doggy psychologists to figure out what will help pups. https://t.co/iaeRpGiSUR
All dogs, like humans, have good &amp; bad days when learning something new.	Same for our pups, though it usually lasts just a day or two. https://t.co/z9lQa2uKX4
We’re sad to announce that a few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn’t interested in detecting explosive odors. https://t.co/c6lxHPfC09

CIA had informed Eisenhower about USSR plan to launch satellite, providing him w strategic advantage needed to guide US response.	#INTELCON
Today’s theme: “Achieving Strategic Advantage”  	OTD 60 years ago, USSR launched Sputnik-1, stunning public—but not US leaders.	#INTELCON
DCIA: Finally, we’re sending more of our people out to the field where our adversaries are.	#INTELCON
DCIA: 3rd, we’re investing in technology. Our ability to collect intelligence today far outstrips our ability to process it.	#INTELCON
DCIA: 2nd, we’ve streamlined decision-making in Mission Centers, w fewer people signing off on analysis or proposals.	#INTELCON
DCIA: 1st, we’re taking every opportunity to impress on officers the need to push decision-making down to lowest possible level.	#INTELCON
DCIA: We must do everything in our power to become even quicker, even more flexible.	#INTELCON
DCIA: CIA has always had a bias for quick, decisive action. It’s a tradition that goes back to WWII &amp; our predecessors in #OSS.	#INTELCON

Trainer Andy runs Suni through can lines &amp; she catches on quickly, excitedly searching for the explosive scents. https://t.co/Ftd3Eqdhmv
Cans are arranged in straight lines, &amp; trainers present a can to #K9 by walking backwards using hand to show pup where to sniff. https://t.co/KEOr9FmPZH
Trainers teach pups to sit when they find an explosive in real life, so the dogs won’t bark, pick up, or in any way disturb a possible bomb. https://t.co/MBglXuN2Tj
Pups are learning 2 important concepts:		1: “seek” – search for explosive odor		2: “sit” – when they find a “hot” (i.e. explosive odor) https://t.co/SUE1Lj3Sc3
The trainers place tiny tins containing scents into cans. As they add new scents for the pups to learn, they’ll now do so using these cans. https://t.co/8HITq7XLdx

Under Omego’s leadership, CIA began first significant efforts to increase presence of minorities &amp; women in analytic, ops &amp; tech ranks.
In 1975, DCI Colby asked Omego to create &amp; lead CIA’s first independent Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO).
Omego joined CIA in October 1955. At the Agency, as in the military, he was usually the first African American in each of his assignments.
Omego grew up in Washington, DC in the 1930s &amp; joined the @USArmy in the 1940s, becoming an Infantry Intel &amp; Recon Chief.

January 6, 1948: DC-3 from Brussels crashed on approach to Le Bourget airport near Paris, killing all 5 crew members &amp; 10 of 11 passengers.
Jane continued to serve in DC &amp; abroad in Strategic Services Unit &amp; Central Intelligence Group.	1947: Jane became an original member of CIA.
#OSS dissolved in 1945, but Jane’s work was considered important enough that her employment w US intel survived massive post-war downsizing.
Jane &amp; her teammates collected intel, found enemy agents, interrogated sources &amp; ran agents, including doubled enemy agents, against Germans
Jane worked in France in mid-1944, after Normandy invasion, as an X-2 Case Officer engaging in important field work.
Jane’s work as an analyst &amp; her French language skills brought her to the attention of James Murphy, chief of #OSS Counterintel X-2 group.
While at #OSS HQ, Jane was assigned Pictorial Records, which processed photographs by identifying them &amp; deriving intelligence from them.
Jane began working for #OSS in March 1943. During #WWII she worked in DC, London, France &amp; Germany. https://t.co/Du8G42BZzo

#Hercules died @ 85 &amp; is buried @ Trinity Church, next to his friend Alexander Hamilton	#whotellsyourstory	#HISTINT		https://t.co/2rIlZy4e6n
#Hercules &amp; #Hamilton became founding members of NY Manumission Society, an early organization founded to promote abolition of slavery.
While President, Washington updated his wardrobe through #Hercules who changed sign outside his shop to say: “Clothier to Genl. Washington.”
Washington visited #Hercules after “Evacuation Day” parade easing any doubts as to which side Hercules had been on. https://t.co/5DpW2UaVi2
After the war #Hercules feared tarring &amp; feathering or some other revenge for appearing too close w British, despite his true loyalties.
Twice #Hercules was able to solicit info from British officers about ambushes. He &amp; Cato were able to pass along info &amp; save Washington.
#Hercules would dispatch his slave, Cato, to Washington’s HQ in New Jersey to share information on the redeployment of a particular unit.
#Hercules would ask officers seeking repairs when they needed them done, if enough gave the same date, he could surmise when they’d deploy.
When Gen. Washington mentioned to #Hamilton that he was looking for a spy in #NYC, Hamilton recommended his friend #Hercules Mulligan.
1775: #RevolutionaryWar begins. After Washington was defeated @ Long Island #Hercules tried to leave New York but was stopped &amp; dragged back
#Hamilton developed his pro-Patriot views from a variety of sources, including #Hercules &amp; New Jersey Governor William Livingston.
1773: #Hercules opened his doors to student named Alexander #Hamilton who was completing his studies @ King’s College (now @Columbia).
#Hercules married niece of an Admiral in Royal Navy, but was also running w the Sons of Liberty- secret society protecting colonist’s rights
1774:  #Hercules opened a clothing emporium catering to wealthy British businessmen &amp; high-ranking military officers.
#Hercules was born in Ireland in 1740. He and his family immigrated to New York when he was about 6 years old.

#3D #model making is dynamic work that continues to evolve &amp; play an important role in protecting national security.	https://t.co/Fi3RzS0Usi
#3D #model makers face a variety of challenges in their work, such as tight deadlines, incomplete data and rapidly changing priorities.
#3D #models are essential tools for research and development.
Following operations, intelligence officers may use scale #models to record lessons learned and key takeaways.
#3D #models of terrain make complex situations easily understood regardless of an individual’s background, language or educational level.
Scale #models are used for training exercises to ensure the team members are prepared for all possible scenarios.
Scale #models have diverse usage. Intel analysts use #3D models to more effectively brief U.S. policymakers about complex issues.
“We don’t develop the same kind of #3D #models created during #WWII, but art &amp; creativity of model making remains focal point of our work.”
John, @NGA_GEOINT #model maker at CIA: “The geo-intel tech available today allows us to convey &amp; clarify info critical to CIA’s mission.”
#WWII pilots carried #3D #models of enemy positions on their laps during combat.
Scale #models of all sizes &amp; scenarios are a key resource for our officers as they tackle diverse &amp; complicated national security threats.

When Harriet Tubman died in 1913, she was honored with a military funeral in recognition of work during the war.
June 1, 1863: Tubman led Col. James Montgomery &amp; his men in attack, setting fires, destroying buildings, &amp; freeing 750 slaves.
Tubman had key information about Confederate positions along the shore &amp; had discovered where they placed torpedoes in the water.
After learning of Tubman’s capability as a spy, Gen. David Hunter requested she personally guide a raiding party up the Combahee River.
Tubman reported her intel to a Union officer commanding the Second South Carolina Volunteers, a black unit involved in guerrilla warfare.

1945: Colby led #OSS special ops team into Norway to sabotage German rail lines &amp; prevent German efforts to reinforce homeland from north.
Colby casually described #Jedburghs mission: “to harass Germans as much as possible…ambushes, blowing up bridges, that sort of thing.”
He cheated on an eye exam to become a paratrooper. Jump school &amp; French language skills made him a good candidate for #OSS &amp; #Jedburghs.
The son of an @USArmy officer, Colby attended @Princeton &amp; @Columbia before joining the military. 	#Jedburgh https://t.co/MpKGWHAWNq
One of the most famous #Jedburghs was William Colby, he would become CIA Director. At age 24, he led team into occupied France in Aug 1944.
First Operation #JEDBURGH team deployed night before D-Day. More than 90 teams parachuted into France in 1944. https://t.co/W8eLKdB7fG
Each #Jedburgh team carried a radio: a "Jed Set," which was critical for communicating w Special Forces HQ in London https://t.co/es5MjWIDGu
#Jedburghs trained in:	amphibious ops	skiing	mountain climbing	radio ops	small arms	navigation	hand-to-hand combat	explosives	espionage
US commandos on #Jedburgh teams fought in uniform w no obvious connection to #OSS to decrease likelihood they’d be shot as spies if captured
A #Jedburgh team consisted of 2 to 4 men: US #OSS officer, British #SOE officer, Free French, Belgian, Dutch, or Canadian soldier.	#WWII
OSS #Jedburghs: paratroopers sent into Nazi-occupied Europe to coordinate arms &amp; supplies, train partisans in sabotage, &amp; defeat Third Reich
Small bands of resistance fighters? An evil empire? Not just in #TheForceAwakens.	#Jedburghs	https://t.co/IvigjbsX1x https://t.co/visyby1jL8
"When we think of Greg, we will remember his generous spirit.” -Director Hayden	https://t.co/N658e7zkvr	#inmemoriam https://t.co/KUPWqRz5g7
Greg was 32 years old. More than 1,200 family members &amp; friends came from around the world to attend his funeral.	#inmemoriam
Help finally arrived &amp; the ambushers retreated. The injured were taken to a clinic &amp; treated, but Greg died at the scene.	#inmemoriam
An Agency officer was shot &amp; as Greg shielded him in order to give him time to bandage his wound, Greg was shot in the leg.	#inmemoriam
The engine failed forcing the men out of the car &amp; into a defensive position as they tried to move to a safer location.	#inmemoriam
DCIA Hayden: “At the wheel [Greg] was as calm &amp; professional as ever, despite the growing chaos &amp; confusion all around him.”	#inmemoriam
The officers took evasive action &amp; a 40-kilometer chase ensued during which hundreds of rounds impacted the vehicle.	#inmemoriam
2005: following a successful agent meeting, several CIA officers &amp; Greg were ambushed on a highway.	#inmemoriam
Greg left @USMC in 2000 &amp; became a special security services officer protecting people like @madeleine Albright &amp; George Tenet.	#inmemoriam
1996: Greg joined @USMC &amp; attended:	  Officers’ Candidate School	  Scout-Sniper School	  Army Intelligence School	  #inmemoriam
Greg attended VMI where he played football, was chief of their Emergency Response Team &amp; Forest Fire Fighting Team	CC @VMInews	#inmemoriam
Greg was born @MCB_Quantico &amp; as a member of a military family he moved 15 times in his first 13 years.	#inmemoriam
Greg was assigned to protect lives of CIA officers in dangerous locations. He was reliable, resourceful &amp; a joy to work with.	#inmemoriam

.@WhiteHouse &amp; Congress also drew several lessons from Pearl Harbor as they crafted the National Security Act of 1947.	#PearlHarbor74
For 1st time, US had single intel org for all secret activities: espionage, covert action, propaganda &amp; counterintelligence.	#PearlHarbor74
The failure to predict Pearl Harbor helped lead to President Roosevelt's decision to create OSS - forerunner of today’s CIA.	#PearlHarbor74
Clues to Tokyo's intentions &amp; capabilities laid unnoticed in volumes of unrelated or even misleading data.	#PearlHarbor74
For students of intelligence, the enduring lesson of the surprise Japanese attack was separating "signals" from "noise.”	#PearlHarbor74
Before WWII, US had small, centralized intel org: Coordinator of Information. That changed dramatically after Pearl Harbor #PearlHarbor74

#OXCART: successful IC, @DeptofDefense &amp; private industry collaboration creating strategic asset our adversaries never dreamed possible.
Our #OXCART commemorates 2 CIA A-12 pilots who were killed: Walt Ray &amp; Jack Weeks. 	https://t.co/Rtd0YXSSoS https://t.co/3aZDOrU4Vv
2007: @usairforce transferred 1 of 9 remaining A-12 #OXCART to CIA for display, the 1st to be certified @ Mach 3. https://t.co/FE4Hbj4oC8
October 1997, President Bill Clinton vetoed further funding, &amp; in June 1999 the SR-71 #Blackbird program was officially terminated.
September 1994, Congress allocated funds to reactivate SR-71s &amp; 2 #Blackbird aircraft  became operational again in 1995 &amp; 1996.
January 21, 1990 last SR-71 #Blackbird left @KadenaAirBase, &amp; SR-71 was decommissioned at Beale Air Force Base @9thRW on January 26.
In late 1980s, enthusiasm for the expensive SR-71 program waned as space-based systems grew. In 1989 @usairforce deactivated #Blackbird.
SR-71 #Blackbird continued to fly &amp; was a vital tool for intel gathering providing important info for successful US foreign policy.
1968: with little value in having both overt SR-71 #Blackbird &amp; covert A-12 fleets w similar capabilities LBJ ordered retirement of #OXCART.
A modified version of CIA  #OXCART, #Blackbird was 6 feet longer, weighed an additional 15,000 pounds fully loaded &amp; had a 2 seat cockpit.
1962 @usairforce ordered 6 “reconnaissance/strike” SR-71 #Blackbird aircraft for high-speed, high-altitude flights over hostile territory.

A detachment of 6 pilots &amp; 3 #OXCART’s based at @KadenaAirBase in Okinawa, Japan flew 29 #OXCART missions. https://t.co/jxnzbPFxKl
The only #OXCART recon ops, codenamed BLACK SHIELD, took place May 1967 - May 1968, initially over Southeast Asia &amp; North Korea.
#OTD 1965 #OXCART declared fully operational @ speed of Mach 3.2 &amp; @ 90,000 feet altitude— unbroken record for piloted jet aircraft.
#OXCART innovations:	titanium fabrication	lubricants	jet engine	fuel	navigation	flight control	radar stealthiness	pilot life-support systems
Johnson designed or contributed significantly to development of 40 well-known &amp; important military &amp; civilian aircraft, including #OXCART.
Clarence “Kelly” Johnson, creator of #OXCART &amp; #Blackbird was ground-breaking @LockheedMartin aviation engineer &amp; genius for over 4 decades.
#OXCART’s engineering innovations produced the two fastest, highest-flying, piloted jet aircraft ever &amp; pioneered stealth technology.
#OXCART’s unique design &amp; characteristics became foundation for 3 versions of supersonic @LockheedMartin aircraft: YF-12A, M-21, &amp; SR-71
#OXCART had a short but successful life &amp; the project produced 2nd longest-lasting aerial reconnaissance platform in US intel history: SR-71
CIA developed highly secret A-12 #OXCART as U-2 successor to meet need for very fast &amp; high-flying recon aircraft to avoid USSR air defenses
CIA’s A-12 #OXCART &amp; @usairforce’s SR-71 Blackbird are actually two different aircraft &amp; #OTD in 1965 A-12 OXCART became operational.

ICYMI: In honor of #ADA 25th anniversary this year, here is the story of Lyman Kirkpatrick: https://t.co/oGx0DoI6Er https://t.co/TYZPP5gz91
1959: construction of CIA HQ on old #Leiter property began, 6 years after the first @007 novel was published.	https://t.co/r3W03sOxAO
We worked w @NCPCgov &amp; @USDOTFHWA to acquire some of the #Leiter land for today's CIA HQ.	https://t.co/8MMElodCpT https://t.co/s0bPCYZ8Gg
.@NCPCgov intended to use house as a rec center &amp; tea room, but it burned down in a“spectacular fire” in 1945. https://t.co/VHXyR9qqa6
#Leiter’s land became part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway &amp; site of public trails &amp; picnic areas. https://t.co/WP1lcdGQnN
1936: after #Leiter heirs &amp; @USTreasury settled over $70K back taxes, house &amp; 167 acres were deeded to US Gov’t. https://t.co/FL6wZOrP5a
Joseph #Leiter died of pneumonia in 1932. He had acquired significant debt &amp; his 43-room country house-Glass Palace-was abandoned in 1935.
Fleming had no way of knowing that years later, the land Thomas’s father owned would become HQ to Felix #Leiter’s employer, CIA.
One of the 1st first references to the existence of CIA in pop culture was Felix #Leiter in 1st @007 novel, Casino Royale, in 1953.
Ian was such good friends w Thomas &amp; his wife that when Fleming created @007, he named Bond’s friend after them: CIA Officer Felix #Leiter
Joseph #Leiter had a son, Thomas, who became friends with a certain famous ex-British spy turned @007 novelist, Ian Fleming.

1895: Joseph’s sister, Mary #Leiter, married British aristocrat Lord George Curzon, who became Viceroy of India. https://t.co/c3f8So7C2S
Joseph #Leiter was a Chicago capitalist &amp; sportsman who inherited his father’s wealth. His 3 sisters, all wed into British high society.
#Leiter built his “country house” on bluff overlooking river &amp; installed road from house straight through present-day CIA HQ.
American millionaire, Joseph #Leiter, owned a large swath of land on western banks of the Potomac River in what is now Langley, Virginia.

After leaving CIA, Kirkpatrick taught political science at @BrownUniversity &amp; wrote several books, including The Real CIA (1968). 	#ADA
His performance earned him the National Civil Service Award &amp; the President’s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. 	#ADA
In tribute to his willingness to take independent &amp; sometimes unpopular stances, his staff nicknamed him “Hell on Wheels.” 	#ADA
At that time, polio halted a clandestine career but Kirkpatrick went on to senior jobs, including Inspector General &amp; Executive Dir.	#ADA
At the age of 36, Kirkpatrick thought he had a bad cold, but it turned out to be polio, which required months of recovery &amp; rehab.	#ADA

Known for his ops tradecraft, Abel had long spy career before his arrest. After returning to USSR he lectured on intel work.	#BridgeofSpies
Abel joined the OGPU—KGB forerunner—in 1927. In #WWII he served as an intel officer on German front.	#BridgeofSpies
Abel was fluent in English, German, Yiddish &amp; Polish, served in Red Army communications unit, &amp; worked as a language teacher.	#BridgeofSpies

President thought E Street address was well known as #CIAHQ &amp; lack of a sign fooled no one, thus sign was immediately put up at entrance.
@WhiteHouse driver had difficulty finding #CIAHQ entrance. Next day, the President called Dulles &amp; ordered a sign be added at the entrance.
For years, the entrance of the original #CIAHQ had no sign, then one day Eisenhower tried to drop his brother off to meet w DCI Dulles.
