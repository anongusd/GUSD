As fewer physicians provide bone density tests in their office patients will have a harder time accessing these vital tests.
Current and proposed Medicare reimbursement cuts for DXA testing can make it difficult for patients to find a DXA provider.
Bone density tests are critical to detecting osteoporosis and preventing debilitating and costly fractures before they occur.

Women can lose up to 20 percent of their bone density in the five to seven years after menopause.
Young women whose mothers had broken bones as an adult have an increased risk for osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis happens when you lose too much bone, make too little of it or both.
Throughout life, you are constantly losing old bone and forming new bone.
Bone is living, growing tissue that is both flexible and strong.
You need to get enough calcium and vitamin D every day to keep your bones healthy.
About two million men and eight million women have osteoporosis.
In the U.S. today, ten million people are estimated to have osteoporosis.
