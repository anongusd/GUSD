It‚Äôs a legislative issue for them to decide, you know, if they give us more charters, we‚Äôll hand them out." They, meaning state legislators.

Here's something I personally did not know: there were 22 charter spots that were revived a couple (?) years ago after those schools were closed, giving room for new charters to open. That was a one-time deal ‚Äî if a charter closes now, that doesn't open up a new spot.
We asked state officials specific questions what the Regents may do, and got just this answer: "Once the charter school cap for New York City is reached, we cannot approve new charter applications for that area per statute."
These applications must go to the Board of Regents for final approval, or they're automatically approved 90 days from today.
Committee votes to approve the first 7 charter school applications. Trustee Tisch raised some concerns about two Zeta charters being in the top 7, wondering if that's fair to other operators, but voted to support the list in the end.

Those 7 are Amber Charter School III, Family Life Academy Charter School IV, Zeta Charter School ‚Äì New York City 3, Zeta Charter School ‚Äì New York City 4, KIPP Beyond Charter School, Brooklyn Ascend Charter School 6, Girls Preparatory Charter School of the Bronx II.
We're on to new charter school applications. Chairman proposes approving the entire list of 13 applications (check item B here: https://t.co/AFUyENeD3u). First 7 on the list would get spots right now, and remaining 6 would have pre-approval if the cap is ever raised.

There's an projected annual $8.6 million cut for the Renewal School program, starting in FY20, in the mayor's proposed budget. Budget director says that's because of program "efficiencies," not a signal of the program winding down.
@NYDNBenChapman It is starting to get hard to keep up. Thank god I have colleagues who can help.
Thanks to @cveiga for pointing out that de Blasio did announce expanding 3-K to Districts 8 and 32 in his State of the City: https://t.co/q4S4UzOp6Q
Some advocates are concerned with funding for counselors in schools with high populations of homeless students, which would expire before the next budget. Mayor's proposal today does *not* include this, but it's a priority that could make it in later.
**amend this, he didn't outright say more things could be done in-house, that's my assumption. He said, DOE should find "whether there are areas they can cut back without affecting direct services for kids," directly pointing to rely on consultant contracts.
Mayor says even frontline agencies, like public safety and education, can make certain cuts. I asked what those could be for DOE in particular, and he said right off the bat he thinks of consultant contracts, that there could be more things done in-house.
The major education investment in this budget pitch is continuing to expand 3K in Districts 8 and 32. 1,900 new seats = $25 million.
As he paints a grim financial picture, Mayor says he'll ask every city agency submit plans for "real and tangible savings" ‚Äî "If agencies are not forthcoming with the kinds of reductions we need, the budget director will herself make the decisions..."
Mayor says Cuomo's proposal has $300 million less than what NYC schools need in FY2020.

Carranza enters his second hour of testimony with state lawmakers. https://t.co/bXeLypXb3m
Couple lawmakers raised concerns about expanding 3K. They're concerned about whether the dollars are there to roll it out, and how it affects the existing "universe" of child care.
In response to questions about recently designated 'struggling' schools, Carranza says, "The good news is that none of those schools were a surprise to us. When that list was released, we were already working in those schools based on specific things" they needed to improve.
I did not catch the answer to the first question (I think...the number was $750 million more in funding would achieve 100% for each school?) And for counselors/social workers, Carranza says they're very interested, it's a "matter of money."
Councilman Mark Treyger asking questions through Sen. Diane Savino. Wants to know what city can do to achieve 100% FSF for each school, and what can system do to increase # of guidance counselors and social workers?
Jackson has asked Elia, Carranza &amp; DOE's chief financial officer how much the city spends on special education. No one could provide a definitive answer. But DOE had the $ on charter schools ready: $2.1 billion a year, $69 million on rent.
Sen. Robert Jackson asks Carranza why under the Fair Student Funding formula, the city doesn't fund every school at 100%. Carranza says city schools are owed $ from CFE lawsuit. Jackson: There‚Äôs going to be a big fight if that doesn‚Äôt happen. Let me just say that loud and clear.
Carranza on mayoral control: "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. I get to do my job. I have the full weight and authority from a mayor who is accountable to the electorate to hold me and hold us accountable."
In a question about Bronx plan, Carranza acknowledges that "there are some concerns" and they're working to address those issues.
To be clear, this previous tweet refers to the new funding formula Gov. Cuomo has proposed, which would send more dollars to specific schools within districts. https://t.co/WCaAYEc160
Benedetto asks Carranza more about Cuomo's proposed funding formula. Carranza: "Funding formula, we think is, with all due respect, flawed." He said that the DOE's analysis finds that even some schools identified as struggling by the state wouldn't be eligible for additional $$.
OK, his ending remarks had to be cut off a bit, but we're moving to questions.
He's saying that the city's FSF formula is solid and drives progress. Nothing unexpected here so far ‚Äî it's not surprising that any school district would push back on the idea that a state agency would dictate spending on the school level.
Carranza says it's clear from the funding transparency law that NYC spends more on high-needs schools. "Our analysis of the Executive‚Äôs language revealed that this would mandate 75 percent of our funding increase go to 22 percent of our schools, leaving out almost 1,300..."
Talks about Bronx Plan (which would give more $$ to teachers working in hard-to-staff positions) and says the DOE hopes to announce the finalist schools in the "very near future."

He's talking now about his tours meeting parents and talking about his vision for public schools. "We can‚Äôt do things to our communities; we can only do things for communities and with communities."
Well...in New York, that is.
And now Carranza is up for his first-ever legislative testimony.
@briancolligan Brian.
I am wrong. Testimony now from Jonathan Dollhopf, from the Regional Center for Independent Living.
"I believe class is over." Elia's done after almost four hours of testimony and answering questions from lawmakers. There was no grilling, just a *lot* of questions about budget, schools policy, etc. We should be hearing from @DOEChancellor soon.

Someone near the mic accidentally (?) summoned Siri on their phone: "I'm not sure I understand."
Elia is closing in on 3 hours of testimony/answering questions. As noted before, she doesn't think Cuomo's proposed funding formula that would instruct districts on how to spend $$ on specific schools is a good model, that local districts know best for something like that.
*THIS* is insane to think about. Context: This bowl drawing decided a tie in one House race last year but ALSO the make-up of the House. The Republican won the bowl drawing, meaning Rs had the edge, meaning they had the power to choose the Speaker. https://t.co/KSA3q9CXww

She said she was sympathetic to Asian families on the SHSAT debate, ‚ÄúBut one thing I can‚Äôt accept is when they say things like, ‚ÄòOur kids have worked hard. We deserve this.‚Äô The unspoken thing is that other kids in other families don‚Äôt deserve this.‚Äù
Appreciated seeing a Bangladeshi immigrant in this @elizashapiro story. Often, I feel like society forgets that "Asian-American" is comprised of many different cultures and ethnicities. https://t.co/zS79LW6yLT
Of course this is alarming for many reasons, but.....also.........that does not look like A BIRD. https://t.co/HE6FmGdma9
Elia eventually says what Liu is trying to make her say (which was quite clear from her testimony before): "We are not happy that [governor's budget is] substantially lower than our number."
Sen John Liu: "Do you believe in ghosts?" (presumably referring to Cuomo calling Foundation Aid a 'ghost of the past')		Commissioner Elia: "Um, OK so Sen. Liu...."
After rattling off some numbers, Sen. John Liu asks Elia simply "what do you think about that?" in regards to Gov. Cuomo's budget. Elia: Well that's an interesting question.

For August graduation rates, NYC went from 74.3 percent last year to 75.9 this year. Here's last year's story: https://t.co/lNN5yP6Oyi
And according to the state, graduation rates for charter schools dropped 2.5 percentage points.
Statewide graduation rates went *slightly* up ‚Äî from 80.2% to 80.4. Rochester and NYC were the only two districts of the Big 5 where grad rates rose.
The state just released graduation rates for students who entered 9th grade in 2014. The state and NYC's rates went up. Based on June graduations, NYC's rates went from 71.1% to 72.7%.

Both were clear they didn‚Äôt like the law, which isn‚Äôt surprising. I think I heard this right: that the city is still owed $100 million in reimbursements.
In response to ??‚Äôs about charter school space, Carranza and de Blasio cited state law ‚Äî city can provide space or gets reimbursed for paying charter school rent. Carranza said if that‚Äôs something people don‚Äôt like, they should ‚Äúmake their voices heard‚Äù to state lawmakers.
Important to note: these were not *all* of the questions because that wouldn‚Äôt allow me to responsibly tweet, but I tried to share the more interesting stuff. And with that, goodnight!
Carranza ends with saying there *will* be school tomorrow. De Blasio warns of negative wind chills on Thursday, so bundle up. (Chicago is side eyeing all of this).
Mayor suggests IEPs on nights or weekends. Schools official said that can be challenging because folks like school psychologist need to be at the IEP meetings, but "absolutely need to be more flexible, absolutely can and we will." Sounds like DOE will look into it?
She said she raised this with the mayor 3-4 years ago, and he "seemed to like" the idea. Former chancellor Carmen Farina "wasn‚Äôt happy about that because she thought businesses would be upset with that," mom says.
This was interesting. Mom drafted a bill allowing parents whose kids have IEPs to show up to work late so that they can attend IEP meetings instead of "signing off" via telephone. She said modeled it after a voter law that allows voters to show up to work late.
....I really want to see this breakfast now.
School official in charge of food/nutrition says they know all kids are not eating breakfast (mayor asks for hands from parents whose kids don't like the food, tons of hands go up) and want to improve. There's going to be a parent working group looking at this issue.
Parent asks for changes in the "Breakfast in the classroom" program, which provides free breakfast. But she notices that 50% of the food goes in the trash (kids usually drink the juice, don't want the bagel). Asks about hot breakfast options.
RT @AGZimmerman: Unlike his predecessor, Carranza is not meeting weekly with Mayor de Blasio, according to his schedule https://t.co/V6vx8t‚Ä¶
Mom stands firm and says there isn't enough security. This police official is apparently going to visit her school and see if it needs more officers.
OK, PTA president of M.S. 391 says she wants more police officers to patrol school grounds at the start of the day and at dismissal. Safety is her no. 1 concern. Bronx police official says there's a lot of police staffing in the Bronx.
Her son is in the sixth grade. Mayor: "If a parent is seeing that the child is not going where they need to go, and the parent is trying to support them, it makes sense that they say, "Is what they‚Äôre getting in the classroom enough?"
...issues up with each schools staff's supervisor if they're not satisfied with a response (leading all the way to him).
So there hasn't really been a resolution. Schools staff said they're looking at curriculum and best practices (see Christina's story in this thread). Chancellor says he'll connect parent with a top schools staff tonight, but in general, parents should know that they can bring...
Mom Rosalina said she noticed her son and 6-7 of his classmates were consistently misspelling words. She raised the issue and principal suggested parents download a spelling app for Google Play. "Kids are not gonna go to the spelling apps. They're gonna go to the video games."
Woman/D12 CEC member asks, when are CECs getting more money to be able to function better (reimbursements, larger budgets)? She cites cab and childcare costs. Someone from the CEC finance work group (?) got up and said the group is considering larger reimbursements/budgets.
"When you add deputy superintendents, somewhere, someway, someone is gonna write in the newspaper, 'They are adding more administrators. They are top heavy.' ..Not because we want more people at the holiday party. It‚Äôs because we want to make sure there are people supporting you"
On a question about schools support, Carranza says they're figuring out what sort of supports district superintendents need, which could mean adding staff.
Question: Parent asks how the district is prioritizing its schools over charters when sharing building space? Mayor says they have a plan to build more seats across city, but also that the city has "no problem" saying no to charters that aren't a good fit for certain buildings.

Remember how the Regents had set up work groups to decide what sort of policies were the best for assessments and evaluations going forward? Department officials say they will now review the purposes of those groups "in the context of the new law."
And nearly three hours later, the Senate passes the Jose Peralta DREAM Act. That's the first time since at least 2013 the body chose to vote and pass the bill. Now it goes to the Assembly.

This tweet is better than mine because, well, there are puppies https://t.co/n8ELTN9klB
The bill just passed the Assembly. Now it heads to the governor's desk.
The DREAM Act is up for a vote in the Senate. We've heard from the supporters, so here's Sen. Robert Ortt (Niagra and Orleans counties): For his constituents who struggle to pay for college and are citizens, now will know "their dollars are going to pay for illegal immigrants."
And the bill passes the Senate with 60 yes votes.
.@RJackson_NYC says he's voting in support of the bill but "with reservations." He says it doesn't go far enough and, based on what advocates tell him, could actually double testing, if local districts decide they want to base teacher evaluations on some sort of test.

.@nysape agrees that the bill doesn't do enough: "Rather than the minor tweaks proposed in this legislation, we demand an immediate end to the mandated use of student test scores and student performance measures in the evaluation of educators and the closure of schools."
Opponents (namely, Republicans so far in the sate Senate) don't think the bill goes far enough.
And at the same time, the state Senate is talking about a bill that removes the state mandate that state assessments must be used to evaluate teachers (local districts can still decide). It's a union-supported bill, but not everyone is happy. Live feed: https://t.co/EolXts0Wun

@KeshiaClukey I thought more about this (I realize this is a full 24 hours later). But my thought is (and given my experience this may be a stretch), but it's possible Cuomo could stick it in the budget as leverage for sticking to his recommended level of school funding? Thoughts?

@KeshiaClukey Greaaaat question.
After all of that, Cuomo is proposing an $1 billion in education funding ($230 mil more than he floated last year), but also wants a new formula called the education equity formula -- would "distribute money to poorer districts but to poorer schools in the poorer districts."
Cuomo talking about transparency in funding: "The districts turned around and decided how to distribute the funds, and they did not distribute the funds to the poorer schools. That assumption was flawed."
There's an education mention. Cuomo calls to pass the DREAM Act (which he has before). Sounds like it will pass before the end of this month https://t.co/p1IVJusxPD

@MarieAlbiges Ah, gotchya.
And some of the pushback on the HS degree was quality and who's going to teach. What if a 17yo graduate is teaching 16yos, one person asked. Rosa says state makes teachers jump through lots of hoops to get certified, but now wants to lower the bar for substitutes.
@MarieAlbiges @PriceForDel95 @Daily_Press @HamptonVAPolice What's the tweak?
After a *lot* of discussion and pushback, state officials will remove the line that proposes a high school degree. Meaning, the lowest degree requirement for a sub in New York would be an associate's degree for teachers without a certificate IF Regents vote for it tomorrow.
Hearing this won't really affect NYC, but Regents are discussing requirements for substitute teaching. They're hung up on this suggested requirement: subs who can teach up to 40 days only need a high school diploma. Here's more (go to page 6) https://t.co/hXC6wSbtMw
Regents are talking about creating requirements for certain substitute teachers (more on that in a sec). They're talking about a teacher shortage crisis in New York, and Chancellor Betty Rosa says, "We're not building a wall."
This morning, the Regents passed a resolution that essentially rejects the recent federal decision to roll back Obama-era discipline guidelines https://t.co/SrtEwHjb0l

I was wrong on this. She was referring to factors that would require a school to receive an opt-out plan (which would start next year).
More here, from last September: https://t.co/x7jFBrSBMR
Also, this: https://t.co/cCTtZukSrr. And as Anna notes in another tweet, Elia said the Regents approved this plan for struggling schools as part of ESSA regs last year.
But Elia reiterated a couple times that it's not the *only* factor. Still, Regents feel blindsided and unsure of what to tell their district superintendents. They'll get clarity on on these factors and other info within the next 24 hours.
Commissioner Elia tells Regents that next year, six factors that will help identify which schools are "struggling." The issue being raised is this: if you have a high opt-out rate, scores for % of kids who take the test will still be counted, even if it's as low as 30 percent.
Regents have been raising concerns about how opt-out rates could affect a school's academic rating (could opting out of state tests contribute to a school being labeled as struggling?) Read this story for some context: https://t.co/Z1yrYfqjjB

de Blasio opens with talking about his time as a public school parent, and tonight's conversation with parent leaders is "overdue." Then he says he wants his friends in the news media to know [in case we don't get it] that education is "the no. 1 priority of the administration."

Technically, the final approval will come tomorrow. But there is a Board of Regents quirk here: their committee meetings that oversee proposals before they get final approval consist of all the Board members.
Main concerns expressed here: do we have enough $$ here to address suspensions, and how are we going to fulfill these ambitious goals when the state department is understaffed? More to come!
The Regents have approved this proposal. This amount -- a $2.1 billion increase -- is the same as their request two years ago. Interesting because last year, their $1.6 billion request came when there was uncertainty about the state's financial condition.
The state education department is proposing a $2.1 billion increase in education funding. Last year, the request was a $1.6 billion increase (of which $1 billion was eventually approved by state lawmwakers). Here's a breakdown: https://t.co/fgAiDO6dJh

Here‚Äôs an extremely passionate parent who took on what can only be described as the hype-man rap stance. https://t.co/eUcGEdiDeB
Support for this is a bit split. Member Eric Goldberg got a lot of boos when he spoke against it. Goldberg said the statements were ‚Äúinsane obsessions with selection and assessment," and he didn‚Äôt want to vote for something that ‚Äúdenies...we have a segregated school system.‚Äù
The CEC has been debating this proposal for a while now. Vice President Maud Maron has proposed a resolution that, in part, would ask the DOE to pull its support of the plan and allow more community engagement. The resolution is pretty critical of the mayor's plan.
Wallack again said they're all sharing the same goals, which parents just straight-up booed en masse. Also says, "A great many incredible high school options across NYC aside from the eight specialized high schools."
Parents asking Wallack to address their concern that this will create a "snake pit" in middle schools ‚Äî basically, making them almost viciously competitive. Wallack didn't directly answer that, but said there will be many issues the city will iron out as they roll it out.

RT @matt_barnum: Note: all admissions methods involve counting! https://t.co/x3eraioRd6
Important to note that not every parent here is saying the specialized high schools are "incredibly diverse." But the ones who are have not really acknowledged this: 10% specialized HS students are black or Hispanic, compared to almost 70 percent of all students citywide.
Parents yelled "everyone takes the test. That‚Äôs how you figure it out! liar! and "liar!" as Wallack tried to respond to some of the parent outrage.
A parent who is speaking just asked this 300+ person crowd to raise their hands if they oppose this plan; saw majority of hands go up. He asked for people to raise hands if they support it; didn't see a single hand (@lesliebrody may have). Crowd started laughing and cheering.
Deputy Chancellor Josh Wallack says, "We all share the same goals, and no one, of course, is trying to create a plan that will set students up to fail." A parent shouts right after he finishes, "Everyone takes the test fairly!"
Another NYU professor, Alan Siegel: "You people are proposing a grand experiment on our children."
Speaker ~7 or so, Jon Haidt, a parent and NYU professor, described the plan as one with good intentions that will backfire. "Put yourself in the place of the black and Hispanic kids," he says, who will gain admission "because of counting methods."
Here we go: first speaker says this presentation is "fake news." Says the schools are already incredibly diverse and the mayor/chancellor are trying to implement a racial quota system.
We should pause for a moment so you can read up on exactly what this is all about: https://t.co/wH4UHA4hfv

He said he hasn't approached Amazon yet about this, but the company knows he wants to talk about it. "Everyone involved with that situation is very aware of that, and that will be happening."
One interesting thing Carranza said, re: Amazon or other big companies coming to NYC. "You better believe we're going to be knocking on your door and saying, how do we create pathways for our students coming from our CTE programs right into that workplace?"
For clarity: these new programs have been opened in the last three years, so that goal to open 40 was for that same timeframe.
The new programs range pretty widely, and many are ones we're all probably familiar with. A sampling: Pre-engineering, technical theater, electrical installation, film &amp; media technology, certified nurse assisting, hospitality and tourism and certified personal trainer.
Carranza was here to announce that the DOE has opened 47 new CTE programs (for a total of 301 programs) at 135 schools. The department's original goal was to open 40 by this time. They've opened at schools in all five boroughs, but the most (17) have opened in Brooklyn.

Carranza says this is just the first step. They'll take the plan out to the community, then to committees and eventually Mayor de Blasio.
Funding proposal includes 57K more seats in schools, $750 million for improving bandwidth/technology and $550 million for new Pre-K and 3-K centers, according to the press release.
"What is so clear here today that when we give students these kind of state-of-the art" and "permanent facilities...we are helping them to achieve," Carranza says.
News: Chancellor Carranza is proposing a $17 billion five-year school capital plan, which includes the $750 million advocates have called for to expand accessibility in one-third of the city's schools. Still looking for some specifics on that.

Here's our story on this: https://t.co/COYyfc4hUX
And Price says the address on file with the House Clerk's office is her official mailing address -- where she wants to receive official mail. Her residential home is different.
Parker Slaybaugh, spox for Speaker Cox, said this: "Delegate Price‚Äôs official address on file with the House Clerks Office is in the newly drawn district. If Delegate Price is living at a different address we are not aware of that."
Republicans say they did not place lawmakers' home addresses into the same district (which would require one of them to move), but 95th District Del. Marcia Price said she is lumped in with Del. Mike Mullin in the 93rd in this new plan.
RT @gmoomaw: Republicans say they used no racial data at all. Looks like a few of the districts found to be racially gerrymandered actually‚Ä¶
Like last time, we won't be able to do a full analysis right away but we'll do what we can for y'all. I AM wondering how a map could pass Constitutional muster by not using any racial data at all when race has to be considered to some extent.
Here's (sort of) a timeline of what's happened: 	-In June, court orders redraw of 11 House districts by Oct. 30	-Northam calls a special session in late August	-House Dems propose a map on 8/29-8/30	-lots of back and forth via letters/social media/news releases	-Today's proposal
Press release from House Republicans: "The map, drawn without the use of any racial data, remedies the constitutional deficiencies, both general and specific, identified by the Eastern District of Virginia by altering 30 House districts, including the 11 challenged districts."
Just in: House Republicans propose their own redistricting map proposal. Story coming later.

That federal fraud case starts next month. Background from @PeteDujardin https://t.co/2afR6DH2cd
This was Brown's last chance to fight this case on the state level. She could try to shift the case into federal court by proving that her federal rights were violated, but remember, her attorney is also getting her ready for a redo of her federal fraud case.
Just in: Richmond Circuit Court judge denies Shaun Brown's request allowing her to file a proper appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in the ballot case. Court says 9/13 was the "drop-dead date" to print ballots and an appeal would delay this process.

@marceelias He also requested the federal court immediately take over the remedial process instead of waiting until Oct. 30. That, too, is news.

@gragonews Stop
@marcussimon I think it also means that they're declining to immediately take over the remedial map drawing process.
So actually, the news here is that the federal court has denied the AG's request to have the federal court immediately start redrawing maps. They're just asking that lawmakers get a list of special masters together in case they blow their Oct. 30 deadline.
But as our editor points out, this still affords the GA a chance to draw the map on its own. So not certain what this changes, if anything.
And just in: a federal court has asked state lawmakers to submit a list by 9/20 of special masters (independent folks) who could help redraw legislative maps in the ongoing redistricting dilemma. BUT, the General Assembly can still draw a map by Oct. 30.

Also in the filing, GOP says they're in the "advanced phases" of a redistricting plan and this call to ask the federal court to take over is unnecessary.

Here's the story: https://t.co/3AWkOLZUZN
Those Democrats are House Minority Leader David Toscano and Del. Charniele Herring, chairwoman of the Democratic caucus.
Cox said lawmakers had agreed to work together on this -- that's why this is disappointing. Democrats shift blame on to the GOP: "Given their continued refusal to take even the smallest step towards a remedy, we agree with Governor Northam that the legislature is at an impasse."
Northam says he doesn't expect Democrats and Republicans to reach a consensus on new district lines, so it's better to let the federal court work on it now. In a statement from his spokesman, this letter "surprised and disappointed" Speaker of the House Kirk Cox.
In a letter emailed to the press around 5:30, Gov. Northam has asked the General Assembly to let the federal court redraw lines on the map. Quick story coming soon.

Toscano says "he never once heard" someone request a specific racial goal for their districts when map drawers set out to redraw lines.
To be clear, Toscano and Bagby were in on some of the phone calls that happened during the drawing process but they have said multiple times that they weren't in on every single phone call.
Chairman Cole asked for a list of the drawers. Toscano said he doensn't know, then said, if they don't like the map, express your concerns.
Gilbert is really pressing Toscano on who the map drawers are/who oversaw this process. Toscano has not answered the question directly.
RT @mechelleh: .@cToddGilbert asked if anyone in particular asked to adjust the black voting age population in their district. Toscano said‚Ä¶
Toscano also said, he's not sure if anyone did specifically, maybe someone did. He said he was not present for all the phone calls.
Majority Leader Todd Gilbert has been questioning Toscano/Bagby on whether they used race as a factor in drawing these maps. Their response has been, goal was to address compactness. 		Gilbert asking which delegates asked for more/less black voters. Toscano says he doesn't know.
Bell called out the redrawing of the 95th, where the Briarfield and Carver precincts are. Both of those -- which went more than 75% for Northam last year -- were placed in the vulnerable 94th, represented by Del. David Yancey. Toscano says these voters needed to go somewhere.
RT @gmoomaw: Republicans are making hay over this blue "thumb" in western Henrico. The light blue is GOP Del. Buddy Fowler's district, and‚Ä¶
Bell said GOP found 115 things the court asked lawmakers to consider when redrawing the map. Toscano said that number sounds surprisingly high and that they focused on not making race a predominant factor. They're going through 6-7 of these 115 points now.
@tornado_loves_u Yes.
Toscano: "Del. Bell, I appreciate the cross examination technique, but I'm gonna tell you very simply ‚Äî I did not know where Republicans lived, our people did not know where Republicans lived, we did not draw anybody deliberately into a district."
At P&amp;E now, and it is tense as Del. Bell questions Del. Toscano on how this map was drawn. Apparently a couple Republican incumbents' homes were drawn into the same districts (meaning they'd have to move to run in their current districts). Bell is pressing Toscano on this.

"We intend to look at it further, intend to give it additional scrutiny as the court would expect." -- Gilbert.
House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert: the Dems' map puts four vulnerable Democrats in safe districts and weakens five incumbent Republicans. "This was clearly a very nakedly partisan move across the board ‚Äî no question about that."
Toscano is now touting their map and doubling down on, please don't delay. "It‚Äôs not a perfect map ‚Äî there are no perfect maps ‚Äî but it‚Äôs a map.‚Äù

Portsmouth Democrat Stephen Heretick is calling for an independent redistricting commission. He called HIS colleagues' proposal a "self-serving political power grab," a response of gerrymandering to gerrymandering.
The House's Privileges and Elections committee will meet this afternoon to consider the Democrats' redistricting bill, per Laura: https://t.co/X7axyuJvQm
*rejected. So basically there is no set deadline for when delegates have to return to finish this redistricting business (besides Gilbert's public promise to try, by 9/21).
The vote was 48-48. Speaker Cox broke the tie; the amendment is reject. Gilbert said they could publicly commit to *trying* to return by 9/21.
Democrats have proposed an amendment for this session that would force lawmakers to come back by 9/12 at the latest. House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert asked the House to reject because that's not enough time. House Minority Leader Toscano says it's necessary to avoid a delay.
It's been 40 minutes, House is at ease. Delegates are saying hi to eachother, as someone observed, like it's the first day of school.

@JoshhTerry the cashier at a taco bell I frequent calls me 'baby' these days.
We're particularly interested in this right now because as state officials continue to talk about the eviction rate in Virginia, others say the problem is much bigger -- that minimum wage needs to go up, specifically for the working poor.
For this week's podcast, we're going to be exploring minimum wage in Virginia and the politics behind changing it or keeping it level. Got any questions about this? Send them my way, and we'll address them.

He adds, "I have children. I don't want to evict anybody's children, but it‚Äôs a harsh reality that everybody has to face."
Landlord Russell Skidmore said he's going to court today over unpaid rent (not eviction). He says the issue is bigger; maybe the state has to focus on raising minimum wage or attracting more jobs. "Who cares about me missing my mortgage payment and me going into foreclosure?"
Fairfax: "The message I want tossed out from Virginia is that while we're parsing out the data to see where we fall, we really have been tremendously responsive in relation to this issue."
(His argument being, his requirement of salary means tenants can afford rent). Most of the discussion has revolved around education tenants/making tenants aware of resources available in the community to help.
Lots of observations on struggling tenants. Landlord David Whitley said he requires people to make 3x more than monthly rent. So he guessed that his tenants who don't pay "...smoke marijuana, or they bought a new car, or there was one person who wanted to get her nails done."
They both said that either way, it's good the study has inspired conversation here in Virginia.
Much of the same kicked off this discussion. Hampton City Manager Mary Bunting says the widely known Princeton study exaggerates Hampton's rate by about 25% based on their own study. Newport News housing authority director Karen Wilds said pretty much the same thing.
Here's the last thing that was discussed at the state level, at the state housing commission. https://t.co/ORnnlLA4ri

The other, a single mom at the time, couldn't usually pay rent on the 3rd, when it was due and faced a hefty late charge, so she took out a cash advance loan, but had to pay that back. It became a vicious cycle.
So, I sat down with two Newport News women -- now community activists -- who told their stories about struggling to pay rent. One of the women was nine months pregnant when she lost her job and couldn't meet rent.

Here we are again on election day. And I'm just thinking about Taco Bell and https://t.co/hmoPAHekqI
@Tom_Kramer Yes, detailed of course.
Almost 97% of precincts reporting, and Stewart is still ahead with 44.76% of the vote. Freitas has 43.16%. #VASen
@Tom_Kramer Bowl.
Recount law, if you're curious: No automatic recounts in Virginia. In a Senate primary, a losing candidate must ask Richmond Circuit Court for a recount only if their difference with the apparent winner is not more than 1 percent of the total votes cast for THOSE TWO candidates.
Stewart still in the lead, ahead of Freitas by just 1 percent, with 95 percent of precincts counted. Stewart has 127,639 votes (44.49%) and Freitas has 124,777 (43.49%). #VASen
Corey Stewart just took the lead. With 91 percent of precincts counted, he has 44.16% of the vote (119,525). Freitas has 43.91% (118,853). #VASen
@JournoMurph  https://t.co/yXRcOEaUbC
@JournoMurph Also some smaller locales that haven't been counted yet. And with this difference, that could also really matter.
Freitas and Stewart are just about 100 votes apart. With 90% of precincts counted, Freitas has 115,843 votes and Stewart has 115,739. #VASen
RT @jennaportnoy: .@timkaine is on his way to @JenniferWexton's victory party. Expect to see them together a lot between now and November.‚Ä¶
Spoke too soon. With 83 percent of the precincts, Stewart closing in on Freitas with 43 percent of the vote (101,309). Freitas still ahead (105,466). #VASen
Almost 80% of precincts counted and nothing has really changed: Freitas still holding on to about 45 percent of the vote vs. Stewart's 42 percent. #VASen
Freitas unsurprisingly took Richmond City with about 53 percent of the vote (1,587 votes).
With 73% of precincts counted, we've got Freitas still ahead with 94,139 votes. Stewart has 88,182. Jackson trails significantly behind with 24,961. #VASen
@JournoMurph #recountbeat
SO with close to 60 percent of precincts counted: Freitas is ahead with 73,522 votes; Stewart with 68,377; Jackson -- post correction -- with 19,123. #VASen
Recount brain has me thinking anything is possible always so, you know, that's helpful.

@JournoMurph @williamhoup @DaveRess1 What I was just thinking as well.
In the Beach with not every precinct counted, how can there be that many votes even cast?
So, with 51% of precincts counted, Jackson is now ahead with almost 80,184 votes; Freitas with 65,027 and Stewart with 60,709.
I suspect this is what did it because he's behind in virtually every other locality. https://t.co/w2koxnB7BZ
With 30 percent of precincts counted, Jackson just jumped way ahead and has 72,609 votes. Freitas has 36,619 and Stewart has 33,529. Checking on which precincts just got counted...
With about 11 percent of precincts counted, @NickForVA is ahead with 12,606 votes. @CoreyStewartVA close behind with 12,053. @ewjacksonsr way behind with 3,257.

This is the second time since December I've seen a @nytimes alert about Virginia politics (besides the November election). First on the Simonds-Yancey recount, and now on Medicaid expansion.
@geesemom Thanks for sticking with it!
Thanks for sticking around, guys. Final story (with comments from Northam and Speaker Cox) coming soon. In a secret to no one, this is a huge legislative victory for Northam. He said the next focus would be seeing expansion through.
And the budget bills pass through the House of Delegates, 67 yes, 31 no. (It was 68Y and 30N for the first bill). Now the budget bills with Medicaid expansion goes to @GovernorVA.
Del. Kathy Byron, strongly opposed to expansion: "It‚Äôs a difficult day for many of us. I believe we all come down here with principled ideas in mind with what we feel what we should or should not to do. Today is not what I consider to be a very good day."
Toscano on the House floor: "The debate over Medicaid has been too long I think, and for too many of us, we argued it was a moral imprerative. But I think with this year‚Äôs budget, it‚Äôs not just about the moral imperative ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the economic imperative."
Talked to House Minority Leader @deltoscano briefly, who said, about the prospect of Medicaid expansion, "Elections make a difference."
House of Delegates is now in session.
Here's the updated story, heading over to the House now: https://t.co/kdtml7ZXTz
And HB 5002 passes with 23 yes votes. The Virginia state Senate just passed a budget bill with Medicaid expansion. The House of Delegates is next.
Sen. Jill Vogel says she has had concerns about expansion but will vote for this budget "because there are things more than medicaid expansion" in it.
OK, all the floor amendments are done. They're about to vote, I THINK, on the final final budget bill, HB5002.
We're now five and a half hours into the Senate starting discussion and debate on the budget bills. We're approaching Hour 10 since the Senate officially convened.

@maaatter Their floor amendments are aimed at tightening up oversight of the work requirements and generally, provisions of the program. But so far, they've been voted down.
Well, here's where we are so far. The Senate has voted to approve the first steps of Medicaid expansion, but is continuing to debate on actually expanding coverage to 300,000 low-income Virginians. That final vote is still not here yet: https://t.co/kdtml7ZXTz
It's probably important to note here the Sen. Vogel has not voted consistently for pro-Medicaid-related amendments today, so she may not be totally on board with the idea. She did vote for that initial HB5001, which starts the first steps toward expansion.
Nope. Wrong. They've voted 22-18 to adopt the floor substitute, but now they'll be hearing 18 floor amendments (guess I was right about those before).
Think we've got the FINAL vote here.
Some delegates have been in and out watching the Senate. https://t.co/ejU8eUFMig

Touting the state employee and teacher raises in the budget, as well as the funding for drug courts. "I see that they work, I think we need to fund them, I think we need to put more money into drug courts."
From Chafin, who long opposed Medicaid: "For me, I came to the conlusion that no just wasn't the answer. That doing nothing about the medical conditions and the state of healthcare in my district just wasn't the answer any longer."
They just voted, basically, to continue the debate. Sen. Chafin, who voted pro-Medicaid today, is about to talk.
To this, Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw: "We‚Äôre a Commonwealth, we‚Äôre supposed to work together, but that didn't happen. And it became apparent when we didn't have a budget, when we finished on the 10th of March, that it wasn't going to happen."		https://t.co/DzZgyrKDPA

Sen. Wagner said this can help every Virginian -- "Would be my hope that we can use this effort to bend the cost curve for every Virginian." (Slips in that they need to take a look at the Certificate of Public Need).
Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Mechanicsville, said he wants the Senate to understand that $$$ is going to private acute hospitals, not "our hardworking" state hospitals.
Listening to dissent from Sen. Bill Stanley now.
Sen. Obenshain now saying this process was not transparent and did not include everyone. "This budget substitute (one from Hanger) embodies all the worst that we expect usually to see out of Washington." He says the budget is "literally spraying" money at things.
Norment, to some "Ohs" on the floor: "Are there any other sneaky little amendments that have been slipped‚Äù into budget? Hanger says no.
Invoking the need for transparency, Norment is wondering if this $2.2 million is actually being handed to HU as an incentive to cooperate with a transportation project that affects university land.
"None of that money is going toward a land acquisition, is that correct?" Sen. Wagner, who is now answering his questions, says not to his knowledge. I think Norment is pressing on whether this has something to do with acquiring land for a state transportation project.
Norment is asking a lot of questions about $2.2 million going to Hampton University, specifically its proton therapy efforts, I believe. He's wondering why it's in there.
I'm sorry -- fellow reporter tells me this was 18 committee amendments. Struggle city over here.
Votes on the first budget bill: https://t.co/ALzjTOowNj
There are 18 floor amendments on this one.
HB 5001 passes, 23-19. Republican Sen. Jill Vogel, also thought to be open to the idea of expansion, voted in support of it. Now comes HB 5002.
OK, here come the final votes on a budget with expansion.
The floor amendment over strengthening the work requirement oversight fails, 21-19.
RT @DaveRess1: in #VaSenate floor amendment that would slow the Medicaid expansion process fails after a 20-20, with Lt Gov Fairfax breakin‚Ä¶
OK we're back, it's about $25 million.
So then Norment asks, is there new money included to help support monitoring efforts? Hanger says yes, Norment asks how much, Hanger says he's not sure but it's "modest," so Norment says, let's be at ease while he finds that number.
Now questions from Norment. He asks Hanger if volunteerism counts in the work requirement. Hanger says they've tightened that up, has to lead to a job placement or earning job skills. Norment now asking who will verify that? Hanger says agencies like DMAS have this in place.
So Stanley doubled down and said, there's still no verification process then, just promises of one in the future.
Hanger says his suggestion is "a much more rigorous system" to look at individual's bank accounts to make sure they're putting money in the bank.
Stanley: "No way to tell if someone is telling the truth or taking advantage of this system." Hanger says "plain and simple" it's a work requirement and disagrees with Stanley. So Stanley asks, what's the verification process to make sure people are working?
Sen. Bill Stanley says this amendment strengthens what he calls a work suggestion: "I heard further from his excellency the governor, and even those in this body, that this work suggestion would be verified through an ‚Äòhonor system.'
OK, there are floor amendments being proposed to Hanger's bill right now. The  one they're discussing right now is supposed to "verify" that those getting Medicaid coverage are working (the work requirement) and will overseen by the state employment commission.
Whoops, I think they just voted to open it up for debate: https://t.co/cWmnTNsBEH
Senate passes first set of floor amendments from Hanger, same votes -- 22 senators supporting it with Chafin, Hanger and Wagner as the Republican 'yes' votes.
But as time went on, there were murmurs that Chafin was softening on the idea. Now they're discussing Hanger's actual amendments (Remember, this is a package of amendments that represent a compromise between Hanger and House Appropriations Chairman Chris Jones, from Suffolk).

OK, Senate is in session, two hours and 12 minutes after it was supposed to be. Here we go.

He also apologized to Lt. Gov. Fairfax if he was out of line. His comment about it being directed toward the whole Senate got some laughs.
Remember when Sen. Norment said last week that he'd be back in 2019 and 2020 "to kick your ass?" He just got up to apologize because one particular person (unnamed) thought it was directed at her. "My comment was much more universal than that ‚Äî it was (for) 39" Senate members.

There were audible gasps when Hanger asked Norment what his intent was, and Norment said that they don't have to explain their intent.
The full Senate reconvenes in less than an hour. We'll check back in then.
Basically, he thinks it was a maneuver by Norment to try to "prejudice an outcome" tomorrow. The look on Norment's face when Hanger said the motion was improper and abruptly gaveled out was something.
Hanger, after a couple reporters ran after him: "It was a maneuver, I think, intended to prejudice an outcome tomorrow, in that it had been considered twice, reconsidered and was dead, which could have been overriden by a majority vote on the floor I believe."
Sounds like there might be a rule that if something is considered multiple times and dies in committee, it limits how that *thing* can be considered by full Senate. And for everything we know, Hanger is going to propose expansion later today to the full Senate &amp; has support for.
Everyone looked completely confused.  After some back and forth, Hanger -- from the suggestion of another senator -- said it would be out of order to reconsider this amendment, and before Norment could say anything else, he said "we're adjourned." Gaveled out and got up.
The most bizarre thing just happened. After this, Senate Finance voted to adopt its original amendments about the budget (don't have Medicaid expansion). Then, before it adjourned, Norment (majority leader) asked for a motion to reconsider the vote on Hanger's amendments.
Motion to adopt the amendments from Hanger (which pave the way for Medicaid expansion) was defeated in the committee 7-9. Notable, however, because Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, voted FOR the amendments, who wants expansion but has been squishy on what he wants.
Senate originally wanted to stick with just $20 million, in cash. This plan would call for $330 million in bond proceeds to pay for the harbor stuff.
For our area: budget compromise would include House plan of $330 million for widening and deepening the Hampton Roads Harbor &amp; $20 million to plan and do prelim. engineering for widening/dredging the Norfolk Harbor Channel to 55' and the Elizabeth River's southern branch to 45'
Important point about this budget deal: https://t.co/Exx9zb8c3W
RT @MalloryNoePayne: For those REAL ü§ì who like to go straight to the source, here's the presentation comparing House budget, Senate budget,‚Ä¶
And by new bill I actually mean, the deal reached between Hanger and Jones, assuming that deal in some form gets approved by the full Senate and sent to the House. A lot of moving parts.
Why this matters: the House is poised to vote for Medicaid expansion, but the Senate has opposed it (AKA the budget delay). If Senate approves expansion, House will too (unless there are serious concerns about the new bill), meaning coverage for ~300K more low-income Virginians.
This was expected last week, but here's what actually happened: https://t.co/tHUcpZDVQU
What is expected to happen: Senate Finance will report out a budget bill today. They'll go over the deal between Hanger and Jones, perhaps some opposing amendments. That bill will be reported to the full Senate today, and they'll discuss. Final decision happens tomorrow.

@Medley Ah, thank you! Send us your thoughts and suggestions, please! We could really use it.
@JWPascale God damn it.
There is a ton of back and forth happening here. Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain gave a pretty passionate speech about how expansion is not fiscally responsible. Democrat Sen. Favola said this helps people in need, and she's not wiling to wait longer than next week for a decision.
lol guys, my newness is showing. @JWPascale was kind enough to point out to me that that is the GALLERY, not upper deck. I have no idea why I said that.
And if they do that, they likely have the votes to pass a budget plan that has Medicaid.
Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw said he's willing to wait just seven more days. Next week, if things are delayed, he or Sen. Hanger will move to suspend Senate rules and basically discharge the finance committee, allowing the full Senate to consider budget stuff.
Dems booed a little bit, no one seemed offended. Norment said expanding Medicaid is not a political issue; it's a matter of being fiscally responsible and if the money for reimbursement doesn't come in as calculated, it could be catastrophic.
Two people were kicked out of the upper deck as they yelled "do your job" and "people are dying." This was during a floor speech Norment gave. He called foul on rumors are false of him advocating Medicaid expansion or retiring. "I'll be back in 2019 and 2020 to kick your asses."
He also said that members of his caucus and Senate Finance need time to review the budget deal/amendments hashed out last night between Sen. Hanger and Del. Jones. When asked why the Senate even met today, he said "I don't know."
Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment told a few of us that he thinks it's "probable" that Medicaid expansion happens, he's just not sure what form it will be in. We tried pressing him a few different ways but he declined to elaborate.
Sen. Richard Stuart voted against having Senate Finance convene next week because he feels it's a signal that a few people are controlling the budget process. He thinks it should go into conference and be hashed out. "A lot of people that are not a part of this budget."
So I imagine that this means there won't be a vote on Medicaid today.
OK, so here's what just happened. Senate is taking a recess until 5 p.m. but the Rules Committee met briefly at a senator's desk (I didn't know they could do that). There they voted to convene Senate Finance next Tuesday at noon.
Interesting....https://t.co/gFkPD8eBt8

Interesting -- Christie Mara with the Southern Poverty Law Center said New York City just passed a law allowing those who are evicted the right to counsel (like you get in a criminal case) when you have to go to court. That would address the cost of legal fees.
Some solutions that were offered up: increase HUD funding for more affordable housing, offer up more vouchers, educate tenants about their rights.
There are mixed opinions here about how accurate the actual data is (some think it's overstated, others the opposite). But there seems to be a general consensus that this is a problem for the state's working poor, whose payments can be thrown off by one bad emergency.
Sorry, that report came out just last month. Since then, our paper, the Virginian Pilot and the Richmond Times-Dispatch have all followed up on the data to show that a problem does exist -- and this data could actually understate it. https://t.co/t3YU12eCRn

In the Senate today watching them do what's expected to be mostly procedural stuff. I want to note my astute observation of several senators eating ice cream today, some cones, some fruit and chocolate bars.

@La__Ley A few weeks ago, NN City Manager suggested that there is some part of state law that would allow councils to categorize funding, but I'm not sure if that would require approving a special ordinance or something. (Council members here said they didn't want it to come to that).
(This is based on a 3rd Quarter financial report, so it's important to note that these numbers could change).
Here's the story on those spending controls: https://t.co/1ZxxssIOSp		And a breakdown of the projects: https://t.co/dqqGWpvV3m
Budget director Lisa Cipriano says they're projecting a $4.7 million surplus for the FY18 budget, a lot thanks to spending controls after last year's budget shortfall. She says those spending controls will stay until the end of the fiscal year (June 30).
Cherry and Scott both suggested there be some meetings or at least discussions with businesses that could potentially be affected. Vick said those same concerns raise a red flag for her about this project. City manager said they'll come back with more information on this.
Council asked a lot of questions about road improvement projects the city plans to pursue grant funding for. Improvements to Oyster Point/Warwick could involve buying land from businesses, which several members didn't love. Eminent domain is guaranteed to get people riled up.

In the South, Councilwoman Saundra Cherry held on to her seat for a second term. Here's that story, by @DaveRess1 https://t.co/dOY4uFmQv0
Dave Jenkins will be the new face replacing outgoing Councilman Bert Bateman in the Central District, and Sharon Scott kept her seat for a fifth term in the North. Here are those stories:		Central: https://t.co/SaaoAIyFTG		North: https://t.co/f0CDXapr1V
And there it is: Sharon Scott beats Bethany with 22 more votes for the North District.
In the Central, Jenkins is coming out ahead with 31% of the vote. Penny has 28%, Reason has almost 25%. Three precincts left to count there.
If you're wondering, why yes, the North District is still five votes apart with 9/11 precincts counted. Bethany in the lead.
And it looks like Cherry has a pretty good chance of keeping her seat in the South. She has 50% of the vote against two challengers, with 4 precincts left to count.
With 7 precincts still left to count, Mayor Price has 54% of the vote against his three challengers.
In the South (which @DaveRess1 is covering tonight) incumbent Saundra Cherry has 49% (1,647); John Eley has almost 34% (1,128); and Latonya Wallace has 16% (536). 14 of 20 precincts there have been counted.
@brendanponton The flashbacks are happening
me https://t.co/Vy6sPCAmdc
So, that's 2,009 votes for Bethany and 2,005 for Scott. Two more to go.
Oh boy. 9 of 11 precincts counted in the North, and Curtis Bethany is ahead of Sharon Scott by 5 votes.
Almost half of the precincts counted for the Central: Dave Jenkins now ahead with 30% (913 votes); followed by Cheryl Penny and Angela Reason with 26.5% (exactly 799 votes each). David Reed with about 10% (298) and Greg Roth with 6% (190 votes).
A little more than half of the precincts counted in the North District, too. It's closer now -- incumbent Scott has about 52 percent of the vote (1,632) and Bethany has 47% (1,488).
With half of the precincts in, Mayor Price has 53% of the vote. Harris is behind him with 28%, then Green with 12% and Creekmore with 5%.
RT @DaveRess1: @reemadamin hmm. with a quarter of precincts in, turnout is already well over half the citywide total in '14
For the North District, with 4 of 11 precincts counted: Incumbent Sharon Scott has 54% of the vote with 1,112 votes. Curtis Bethany III has 45%, with 927 votes.
For the Central District, 4 of 17 precincts counted: Reason in the lead with 275 votes. Jenkins (262) and Penny (263) are neck and neck. David Reed has 70 votes, and Roth has 60.
With 11 of 46 precincts counted, Price has 50% of the vote with 2,611 votes. Harris in second with 1,213, Green with 563 and Creekmore with 237.

Councilman Harris is out here greeting voters and passing out Gatorade bottles to volunteers. And get this: woman on the right is Elektra, whose mother is rapper Linda Wiggins from earlier. #electionday https://t.co/yA7CjAexki
Both also voted for Curtis Bethany III for North District. New faces, huh? I asked. Tina‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúI like new ‚Äî new ideas, new faces. That can shake it up a little bit. It‚Äôs nice to have fresh eyes, ears and brains.‚Äù
I‚Äôve heard again and again today that the biggest issue people are talking about is the preservation of City Farm. That‚Äôs a big one for Dean and Tina Melberg, who want it to stay public. They both voted for Dom Green for mayor because they like his ideas on youth programs/crime.
Cecil Simpkins, precinct chief here, says the turnout is ‚Äúpretty bad‚Äù: 374 out of 4,308. He thought it would pick up by now since more people are off work, but it hasn‚Äôt really. He‚Äôs not sure why turnout is even lower than expected. #electionday https://t.co/AD61gvJMiB

I didn‚Äôt catch Scott in time to chat. Bethany, who has lost two previous School Board races, said he feels very good about today. ‚ÄúWe were prepared 10x more.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre usually right there with the other precincts,‚Äù she said. On another note, North District candidates Curtis Bethany and incumbent Sharon Scott both here. Bethany is posted up here with some others. #Election2018 https://t.co/RX4zdmEB8E
‚ÄúTerrible.‚Äù That‚Äôs what precinct chief Linda Odell said when I asked her how turnout was today. They‚Äôve had 379 voters of roughly 4,500 come out today. It‚Äôs low, even for an off-year municipal election, she said. #Election2018

When you've got 3 voicemails after writing stories about Comey and an ongoing local campaign, it's reasonable to believe they're going to be nasty. Instead, they were readers with follow-up questions and queries about where to find more information. A good Thursday, indeed.

Is anyone keeping count of how many times he has promoted his book?
I'm predicting that someone is going to make a GIF of Comey saying "Really, grandpa?"
There's also a lot of laughs anytime Comey promotes his book while answering questions.
(He said yes, and he would be willing to debate it in class).
When Victoria Lopez asked if it's OK for Comey to teach a course on ethics after the release of his memos, the entire room went up in "OHHHHHHHHHHHs." Like, https://t.co/ALfH9cglLu
I'm am 100% not going to live tweet this entire town hall because I'm certain that if you're interested, you're either watching CNN or watching Washington's reporters tweet about it. But I'll give some reax from students here as Comey talks.
People who got in were picked from a lottery. Two freshman were among ~15 in the waiting line in case folks didn‚Äôt show up. They‚Äôd been there since 3:30 pm; I talked to them at 6:40. They saw @andersoncooper walk in (which they admitted was pretty neat).
CNN doesn‚Äôt allow other media into their town hall events as a general practice, so I trolled outside for a bit to catch people going in. One guy, Scott Foster, said he saw Comey at his convocation in ‚Äò06, and will again today. ‚ÄúVery different circumstances.‚Äù

@TeeRiddle @TashaT0908 @Daily_Press Whoops ‚Äî I see what you‚Äôre saying. You haven‚Äôt seen one since you moved from NC.
@TeeRiddle @TashaT0908 @Daily_Press I was trying to figure out if they had a full-service store here before. How long ago do you remember seeing it in Newport News?
This would be the first full-scale Piggly Wiggly store on the Peninsula, based on the locations listed on their website. Other Virginia stores are in Norfolk, Emporia and Danville.
The store will open on June 19. More to come.
Big news for the Southeast Community: Mayor Price announces that Piggly Wiggly will take over the spot that former Jim's Local Market was in, once again stamping out a food desert in the Southeast Community. (Context, for when Jim's closed): https://t.co/gS43gKGK4g
Night meeting has started. Starting with proclamations. This week it's to honor Older Americans Month.
The program that a person would get after going through a behavioral docket -- the technical name for this -- would typically last for a year. A treatment plan would have to be designed and approved by the presiding judge.
Council members Woodbury and Bert Bateman seem to be on board with this. Haven't heard opposition from others.
It would cost about $125K to launch. The proposal is being promoted by the Newport News-Hampton Community Services Board and local judges. One of those judges says he's gotten support for defensive attorneys, the Commonwealth's Attorney's office and the Sheriff's Office.
We're moving on with the budget and discussing the proposal for a mental health court in Newport News, the first on the Peninsula. Here's some background: https://t.co/JSTXLnggTU
Another thing: the city's money would not go directly toward school raises. The city's $1 million contribution would go toward school capital needs, which NNPS says it spends surpluses from personnel funds on. So that should, in theory, ease that burden.
Sorry -- school system would cover another ~$2 million because the city has already proposed giving them $719K, before this debate boiled over. It's not clear where the money is going to come from NNPS, either.
Woodbury still criticizes NNPS on its spending (using surpluses from personnel costs to fund capital needs, which school officials say go toward underfunded things): "They find every way they can to spend it." She also calls for state law on school spending to be tightened.
Mayor Price says they're also proposing for the superintendent, city manager, mayor and School Board chair to meet quarterly. City Councilwoman Pat Woodbury and Vice Mayor Tina Vick says it really needs to be both bodies.
No details yet on where the city's contribution will come from, they're still deciding. Again, that affects the city's capital budget, which is separate from the operating budget. Part of this will be covered through some partnership with the school's fiber optics network.
*At. City Manager Cindy Rohlf says that the city will find $1 million from its capital budget (cutting its own projects, putting some demolition on hold) that would fund roughly a 1 percent raise. The school system would cover the other ~$3 million.
fAt the Newport News City Council work session, City Manager Cindy Rohlf talks about the compromise reached Friday to fund 4 percent raises. Story from last week by @byjanehammond for context: https://t.co/92PMNlNN8h

This Price quote touches on it, but raises the question over BOTH budgets: ‚ÄúBoth of us looked at our budget process ‚Äî and probably will have different approaches next year and make sure this does not happen again."
Here is my takeaway from this. After two weeks of heavy hostility between both of these government bodies, I don't see one mention of a discussion over budgeting practices -- which the city felt strongly about. Very curious to see if that came up at all. https://t.co/92PMNlNN8h

This forum briefly got ugly for a second: https://t.co/VKfflO3KnQ
A quick plug: we're going to have stories for each district race soon, in which I'll lay out everyone's top priorities. These forum stories usually focus on a couple specific questions or the topic that dominates a lot of time.
This was supposed to start at 7 p.m. We're still at opening remarks, with five more candidates to go, so hoping to get to one or two critical questions soon.
I've also noticed that every incumbent (Price, Scott and Cherry) has used the phrase "economic engine" when talking about development. Maybe I'm clueless but I hadn't heard that phrase used this much before these forums.
Marcellus Harris, Dominique Green and Santiel Creekmore -- mayoral candidates -- have all spent a good chunk of their opening remarks complimenting the SCLC and honoring MLK (who founded this group many years ago).
Scott just walked in, so we're just missing Roth, Cherry and Price.
People not here: Mayor Price and Council members Sharon Scott and Saundra Cherry. It‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs a city event they‚Äôre attending but I don‚Äôt know that for sure. Also, Greg Roth told me he has a campaign event tonight. https://t.co/U9KE2jwlmI

And now closing statements. I'm going to lay off on live-tweeting the council candidates this time around unless something different/very interesting gets said (this is forum #4, so if you're following along now, I feel as though you have been). Will tweet the final story.
Burnett: Until we can focus on what the skills are necessary for successful teachers, we can't get rid of the violence. Need proactive planning, ask kids what the issues are and then develop the programs.
Terri Best: If teachers/admin staff/custodians, if they establish relationships with kids, they will tell you when people are bringing guns. Also, youth development.
Law: Biggest piece is youth development, kids need something to do and what they're doing must feel meaningful. Pruden agrees, more youth development. Believe the system has after school programs. Must also be a comfortable environment for kids.
Sports/other activities attract wealthier people to the division, Brown says.
Thomas asks, what is the pathway if funding resources are not there. Brown: We need more of the city capital budget and operating budget. As someone who is a product of neighborhood/schools with gangs, we implement more youth development.
Still Shannon: Increasing number of resource officers in schools. Also, making sure we have the proper surveillance equipment at front, back and side entrances.
Another Q: How would you address guns in schools and gangs? Shannon: "Primary reason I decided to run, concerned about school safety. Certainly I think it's important we make sure that teachers and staff receive fair compensation. But, we also want them to be safe..."
@andipetrini I really do want ice cream now. My view is ice cream is like ice cream.

(Thomas is with Hampton University and is helping to moderate).
Bill Thomas had to ask Law if she is currently on the School Board, by the way. Feel like that's something you should know going in.
Shannon: There is a problem, and his group has heard about it. Some parents have raised concerns to him that in their neighborhoods, their children can't get to or they have to apply so it is competitive. That's why parents want Huntington to remain middle school.
Law: Says there have been opportunities for all students, and would work on that if elected.
Jay Pruden: I think Newport News does a pretty good job with this because they spend a lot of money busing kids all over the city. Also complimenting NNPS for opening honor schools up. "Is it perfect? Probably not, but overall I think they do a pretty good job with it."
Q2: Are our schools facing a diversity problem regarding student, teacher and race?Terri Best: There is a problem, also regarding socioeconomic backgrounds. People tend to live in concentrated areas. Magnet schools, for some reason, are chosen more by white students, she says.
Terri Best, answer to Q1: Says no to single-sex schools, but I too believe we need to be innovative for students to perform higher. Maybe we do a single-sex classroom (to try it out). The research, yes the girls do perform better but there are always anomalies to the research.
Jay Pruden: My view is education is like ice cream, it comes in many flavors. If research is right, then maybe we can convert a wing of a high school into all-girls only. But need to look at what the necessary skills are and how to get there.
Bill Thomas, the moderator, presses harder for solutions to the school system, says we can talk all day about what it is doing right. Law says the answer is more internships, on-the-job training. "Don't think we can do all the education within the walls of our buildings."
Lisa Law: "I think the clubs that we have in our schools really fosters the opportunities for some of that same-sex collaboration that students might want, and so that's by choice." Doesn't want to impose that on students.
Andrew Shannon: Would be opposed to single-sex schools because had it not been co-education, would not have met his wife. Also said, "I believe that we have great opportunities here in Newport News in our school system, where we have challenges we can work to overcome."
So, he would get all children to finish Algebra 1 before leaving 8th grade. In doing so, they only have one more math course to finish. (Something he campaigned on before).
Douglas Brown: Have looked at some research on this topic. Research shows that girls in all-girls schools do tend to perform slightly better; boys do the same amount worse. In essence you're benefitting one group and harming another.
Here we go. Q1: Many districts have offered "single-sex schools" at the high school level. Would you support that here? Pricillia Burnett says she needs to do more research for that. "Stay in the middle at this point if that would benefit" our students.
There we go. Running because he cares about education and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an advocate for education. And his time ended.
Shannon is the only candidate so far to not say a word about why he is running for school board. He cited his civil rights background and acknowledged community advocates for his group who are in the audience, as well as other civil rights advocates.
No reason to doubt him, but I wonder if he'll address separation of his leadership of the group and the organization of this forum for the public.

We're wrapping up here. Here's a rundown of some of the highlights the candidates discussed: https://t.co/tE0jBXzzjk
Sharon Scott and Reed both said bodies need to meet privately in a room and close the door, "this does not need to be a public spectacle," Scott says. I think that many elected officials meeting without public notice would be against open meetings laws.
Jenkin: Yes, but as a city councilman "it's not my job to find the money, it's my job to provide leadership and work with city manager" who then must find the funds. (Objective assessment on that is, that makes it your job).
Roth: Yes, but "we need to get to the bottom" of who is telling the truth about data and funding. Reed: "might be disingenuous" but he supports raises. Wants joint session between boards talking about budget to improve communication.
Bethany: Yes, supports raises, but feels like a ping-pong ball as a citizen and both bodies need to talk more, decide what to do. Reason: do support the 4% increase, wants to form collaboration between School Board, council and citizens. Cannot afford to lose quality teachers.
Scott: Pretty much the same as Cherry -- yes, but school board must decide how to spend the money and should stop making city council look like it doesn't care about the school system.
Q4: Do you support 4% teacher raises? Penny says yes, but must look at budget and see how schools are allocating money. Wallace says yes, wants city to dedicate 30% of its budget to school system. Cherry: Supports more funding, but city council doesn't dictate how money is spent
Reed: Not fiscally sound right now to raise taxes, but would like to see budget with a "fine tooth comb." Some spending can be cut, says some agencies are top heavy.
Bethany: would not look at it initially, but only after city has done everything possible. Reason: Also a no, doesn't want to place additional burden on residents. Roth: says he is a fiscal conservative, wants to bring down property taxes and reconsider BPOL taxes.
Wallace: first would look at spending before considering raising taxes. Cherry: Does not want to raise taxes, must create "economic engines" (same wording Price used). Scott: would only consider raising cigarette tax since she doesn't smoke and it's a health hazard.
Q3: Does NN need to consider a tax increase? Jenkins: No, says he is fiscally conservative. Instead, must grow city to grow revenue. Penny: Also no, it's unnecessary. Need to take another look at the budget and think about expenses.
Central District candidate Angela Reason: turn Newport News into a strong economic powerhouse, fully fund Newport News Public Schools and make it an attractive place for young people. Roth: Put a big dent in the crime rate.
Scott: Would spread city resources "equitably" throughout the city. Wants "One City" tag line to mean something. Also, to bridge gap between school board and the council, and all other city agencies that the city invests in. Bethany: Make downtown NN look like downtown Norfolk.
Wallace: bring the spirit of collaboration throughout the city and for citizens to implement more programs. Cherry: with a magic wand she would continue supporting Newport News Public Schools, and would like to see more city funding allocated to rebuilding Huntington.
Q2: If you had a magic wand, what's one thing you would change? Reed: more joint sessions between council and school board to discuss issues. Jenkins: improving school buildings, says many are in disrepair. Penny: Would wish NN would be on a Top 10 list of cities to live in.
...better transportation, and work on making the Denbigh area more attractive. Cites a study that's about to take place there.
North District candidates Curtis Bethany III and Councilwoman Sharon Scott: Bethany says he wants to add a "fresh younger perspective" (he's 26) and rebrand Newport News, improve public safety and rebuild broken communities. Scott wants to continue working on entrepreneurship
...and improving green spaces and blight.
South District candidates Latonya Wallace and Councilwoman Saundra Cherry: Wallace says she wants to curb violence, improving housing in neighborhoods. Cherry says she wants to change mindset of residents, that it is one city. Wants equitable economic development, diverse housing
Reed is also Central. Two more Central District candidates: Cheryl Penny and David Jenkins. Jenkins said it's to preserve green space (including for City Farm), foster good schools, give teachers a fair wage. Penny talked about keeping City Farm green and improving education.
First question is, what is your vision? Central District candidate Greg Roth, manager of a radio station, says it's to cut expenditures from the budget and implement more recycling throughout the city. David Reed, a teacher, says it's to improve education.

We're done here tonight. One more thing: Price said motivated teachers and students don't focus on the state of their supplies/buildings, but that he supports building new schools when needed. To that, Creekmore said families don't want to send their kids to buildings that look..
On chat about City Farm, @QuentinKidd addressed and clarified something that has driven me crazy. Candidates are constantly talking about "Riverview Farm Park," but that is already a park and is not part of a housing development pitch.
I did it again. It's Monday, right?
Price talks about lack of trust between both bodies. "I'm not trying to throw the school system under the bus," but bodies must meet more. Says both bodies have meetings the same day, so they can't go to each other's meetings.
Creekmore says again that better budget efficiency must be practiced. Harris says it's simple, that both council and school board need to sit down and evaluate the issues and what the real needs are.
Even though this really dominated the city's news cycle last week, Green tells Kidd he has not seen this data. However, the city must address trust between City Council and School Board.
Asking about how school system is budgeting -- is the fact that it has budgeted millions more in the personnel category, then uses the funding for one-time items. Nothing illegal, but some argue that it's hard to justify more city spending on raises. Is that how you see it?
In a rebuttal, Green says that the city could look at "bonds or crowdfunding" but he didn't elaborate on what he means by that.
Creekmore: Doesn't think there is "efficiencies" in the budget to his standard, so that must be explored first. After that, it may be necessary to "bump it up slightly" focusing school funding.
Price says no, "people are hurting." Better if we cultivate economic engines and grow business, which would create more revenue for the city. Green said he agrees with Price, seen better around the world in terms of challenges. "We have what we need in this city."
Is it time to consider a tax increase? Harris says school system and city's budget directors must have frank conversation about budgeting. If, after that, there is still a funding gap, maybe a tax increase is needed.
If you need clarification on what Price is saying: "How do we feel every day about this city...if we could change people's attitudes, the world is open to us."
If you had a magic wand, what's one thing you would change? Creekmore: Mass transit from north to south and east to west. Green: Remove barriers to good quality education. Harris: Better programs for the kids. Price: Better attitudes about approaching city issues.
Price: Diversified economy, notes that Tech Center is bringing in almost as much tax revenue as Newport News Shipbuilding. Better STEM programs, better paying jobs. Said the city must "continue on the path" that it is on.
Harris: A city with a lower crime rate, noting that 95 percent of shooting victims "look like me." Better funded youth programs.
Creekmore: The city needs mass transit (there is mass transit here, but I think he's saying he wants to beef it up). Helps to bring people to jobs, move people around, etc.
First question: What is your vision for the city? Green: City does not have the right vision right now. Needs focus on green technology, better paying jobs, lowering crime rate.

I just wrote "announced Thursday" in a lede for something that just happened. Sure.
A planning department staffer who has been heavily involved in this process just told me she ran down the hall when they got the news, "screaming at the top of my lungs that we were shortlisted." A fair amount of joy in my news feed today.
Ridley Place residents would get a place to live there if they still qualify for subsidized housing once the renovation is done. We've written quite a bit about this, but this article from last year tells you what you need to know: https://t.co/AL5ppBAzBt
The city was first awarded a $500,000 grant in 2016 to plan out what it would do. Now, it is waiting to see if it can get the grant to jumpstart the revitalization, which is anchored by razing the Ridley Place public housing complex and replacing it with mixed income units.
Just announced: Newport News is one of six finalists for a major grant (likely for about $30 million) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to rehabilitate the Ridley Place area in the Southeast Community. Note the name recognition of the other cities: https://t.co/VQVOnG6Fn4

Is Friday arriving for sure? Can someone confirm?
School Board Chairman Gary Hunter just spoke. He said there are surpluses, they are used for other portions of the budget that need it, and they could budget differently, but that could result in not enough pay. He said that maybe they need a new funding formula.
Things just got even more tense. Vice Mayor Tina Vick asked Brown after his speech why this is the first time they‚Äôre talking if he‚Äôs been on the board for years. https://t.co/ZO2NYfOAq4
School Board member Doug Brown, who has advocated strongly for teacher raises, tells the council that end-of-year funding can't be used for raises. The point the city has made that historically, funding looks as if it's being over budgeted in personnel costs.
.@byjanehammond and I just published this. School officials and board members have defended the budgeting practices that city folks have publicly -- and in an email last month -- raised questions over this week: https://t.co/azelYG71d2
Here is almost the whole speech. https://t.co/ZIHQIkSSMd
He didn't call the city's presentation this week a misrepresentation -- which some teachers have -- but said they've been forced to spend money on critical operating expenses. The School Board has to have a frank conversation with the council, he said.
School Board member Jeff Stodghill just gave a speech that said the budget has seen several pressures, but that the council and School Board must come together now. He said the city has increased funding by $10 million over his time as a member, but costs of things have gone up.
Mary Vause, a very vocal teacher, talks about city funding declining after Jim Bourey was hired (funding did go down in his time). She called him a failed leader, resigning after the People Express fiasco. That speech got...tense.
No meeting scheduled yet between city officials, by the way. However, Mayor Price said he reached out to School Board Chairman Gary Hunter to discuss the budget.
Ninth speaker, also a teacher, is one of several who have said that not resolving the hostility between the city and the school board is "greatly damaging" and will turn away people from wanting to work in Newport News.
Heather Marconi, a 12-year teacher, said the council "wasted an hour" on Tuesday showing the data about spending. "With a humble and exhausted heart, I am seriously considering leaving the teaching profession due to the low wages and lack of funding."
Guy up here, sixth talker, tells council "shame on you" for putting money into the pockets of "rich white men" (he's white, by the way) and taking it from the city's youth, in terms of spending on the schools.
Last time, after the city publicly displayed a chart that showed a 4-year surplus in what the schools spend on salaries and benefits, things got tense. Tonight, School Board members are here. https://t.co/jocTHGc03w

Herring said she's "a little shocked" that this would happen after the bipartisan work to even usher Medicaid expansion into a budget. "I have no idea what they‚Äôre about to propose. I guess they‚Äôre keeping it a secret."
A few House Democrats, including Del. Charniele L. Herring, the chair of the Democratic caucus, say they had no idea about this. None of them offered examples on what kind of work requirement is too strong and would lose their support.
My favorite part of being so new to this is aimlessly walking up to delegates and senators and saying, "Hey there, I see your lapel pin....senator (mumbles here)?" They fill in the rest. By favorite part, I mean the most painful.

@JRMcKinnon God bless u
Packing it in, but stay with me tomorrow if you want the latest on budget talks in Richmond. Lawmakers reconvene tomorrow for the special session.
Here is the final write-up of tonight: https://t.co/jocTHGc03w
Bateman says no one likes "this open disagreement we've had" between the council and School Board. But council members also wonder if they know the figures in and out, or if they're just acting on what's presented to them at their meetings.
One, HB 997, didn't make it out of the Courts of Justice committee. It would have repealed the act that sets up pretrial services, which helps judicial officers make bail determinations. Northam signed HB996, which requires an annual state review of each pretrial agency.
State politics and Newport News hats are combining right now: a speaker is talking about pretrial services and complimenting some bills that @cToddGilbert presented this year.
We got to about 21 speakers tonight, and this room cleared out pretty fast post-public hearing. People want one, two or all of three things: more funding for raises, the truth on what the city budget says vs schools budget and they want no more hostility between both bodies.
We're on speaker 17 now in support of more funding for teachers. Both she and her mother, Justine White, speaker 16, said there needs to be clearer information and less hostility between the School Board and the council.
Earlier, South District candidate Latonya Wallace said she supports increased funding for the school system but said there needs to be a clear conversation about where the funding is and what the real numbers are.
Greg Roth, speaker 11 who is running for City Council's central district, says that the city should fund the school system's entire request.
"How so many council members and school board members could play the blame game is beyond me." -- Speaker 10.
Teacher Mary Vause, who has sort of taken the lead of this charge, said Cipriano's presentation was a "creative use of data," and that she needs to review everything herself. She also said teachers are demanding an up or down vote before election.
Speaker 8: Asks for the 4 percent raise, to vote "prior to May 1" (that's the election). She says the city has no problem giving tax breaks to big corporations to keep HQ here. Does not acknowledge presentation.
To be clear: Vick lobbed her complaints against the School Board, not this speaker. That they are not here, that they don't want to meet with the council, and that they are spreading misinformation on social media.
It is starting to get....ugly. Vice Mayor Tina Vick apologizes to this speaker, but that she does not see "your school board members" here, and that it appears they don't want to meet with council. The speaker -- Melinda Hodgkiss -- said elected officials need to figure this out.
I spoke too soon. This next teacher: "I'm very concerned about the disconnect in the information that's being presented here and at the school board....Not our jobs to be in the go-between between the people who are governing the city." She wants both bodies to meet. Claps, woos.
Third speaker says more investment from the city in the schools would bring more people and increase overall revenue. So far, it seems the city's presentation has sort of fallen on deaf ears.
Non-teacher from Texas says teachers deserve a 4 percent raise. Second speaker, a bus driver, says the same. "No teacher should have to go and have a second job, at all."
"It is our hope that this information will allow us to have a discussion with the School Board in an open environment" to reach a consensus, Mayor Price says. Here we go with public comments.
That chart over the difference between budget vs. actual spending on teacher salaries was just shared. Heard some groans, but am also hearing some people behind me say that there must be something wrong with those numbers.
And now the public hearing begins. They're going to present basically what they presented at the work session, including the questions about personnel costs. Acting Superintendent Brian Nichols is here and said he hasn't seen the chart yet.
Former Commissioner of the Revenue Priscilla Bele got a standing ovation from the crowd as she accepted a resolution honoring her service with the city.
Standing room only at City Council tonight. Teacher pay is likely to dominate this hearing. https://t.co/W8HhRSZu4j
.@byjanehammond has contacted the school division for some initial comment. Waiting to hear back.
All of this is being presented before the budget hearing tonight, expected to have a large number of teachers in attendance. It will be interesting to see their response.
RT @byjanehammond: This was shared by at least one School Board member: https://t.co/FF1yyuUVON https://t.co/jYgm2RMARS
Clarification on this presentation -- this was presented to the School Board without the red bar. Someone is circulating THIS presentation, with the red bar, on social media (without the yellow-barred explanations).
Cherry: "They can believe what they want to believe, but we have to hold fast on what we know is true." I think when she said they she's talking about the teachers/others in the community.
Councilwoman Saundra Cherry: "Sometimes when information goes out, I don't care how wrong it is, people believe what they want to believe."
Mayor Price: "Hope that out of this we can come together for the future and do what I think all of us want -- sit down and have an open discussion about truth about funding for all of our kids."
Probably important to note that no one here has said Newport News Public Schools did something illegal when it crafted the budget. The point they've reiterated is that the school system appears to have the funding for teacher salary raises, but they've used it elsewhere.
Another chart, but just for teacher salaries. Cipriano notes that teacher salaries are usually known because of contracts, so the school staff should know who they have and what they‚Äôre going to be spending. https://t.co/nkCltiKyoh
Councilman Harris asks legally what the council can do. City Attorney says there is a section in the state code that would allow council to break funding into categories for the school system. Mayor Price: "It is my hope we don't get to that." Rohlf says it's not a recommendation
Councilwomen Scott asked if that‚Äôs legal. City Attorney said state law requires school system must return a surplus to the School Board.
This one is a bit more jarring. Based on school budget figures, the school system has overbudgeted personnel costs since at least FY2014. Cipriano says the money was used on other things in those budgets. https://t.co/1cX6NghouZ
One of those charts is apparently this one. Most of that shows the city‚Äôs funding for debt payments + operations. But that last bar doesn‚Äôt account for debt. Not a level comparison, but was presented to the public at some point (I think during a School Board meeting) https://t.co/tU4LIDAr1h
Both Cipriano and City Manager Cindy Rohlf said there have been charts presented by school officials and being circulated on social media that misrepresent funding.
At the Newport News City Council work session, things have become interesting about city funding to the school division. Budget Director Lisa Cipriano presented this chart, based on what she says are school figures, since 2008. https://t.co/F89qx3cXlQ

@robynsidersky Elections! Unpredictable fun!
Now I'm reminded of the time a man touched my upper lip at a polling place in the '16 presidential election because he thought there was something in my teeth. Don't do that either.
@BrianCoy This is acceptable.
@BrianCoy I have no idea but they are severely misinformed.
I'll put this into the #NationalHugANewsPersonDay universe: do not touch me, ever. Just read the paper, for god's sake.
.@DaveRess1 and I split up Kaine‚Äôs visits to the Peninsula yesterday. He doubled down on promises in five different areas, and true to form, took a few swings at President Trump. Read: https://t.co/FBXxugIeOT
@HeidiStevens13 @jrichardoneill But....why a thumbnail of raisins
Two local lawmakers took to Twitter today to support a potential mental health court in Newport News. 		https://t.co/ziUkHPMsNo 		https://t.co/YYjYiL62Pg
‚ÄúWill you stand up to take back the United States Senate this year? ‚ÄúWill you stand up against an agenda that‚Äôs me first and instead choose an agenda that‚Äôs for all?‚Äù Got a rousing cheer for that. And he's out. Thanks for tuning in, folks. Story to come soon.
On equality: "President Trump and many republicans, including my opponents, man, they like to blame immigrants for every woe in this country." Says women deserve equal pay, equal access to healthcare. Must protect social security -- under equality because retirees need better.
On gun control: "we support universal background checks, we support reinstating the assault ban...stop the gun lobby from buying elections in this country." Lots of cheers for that last one, too.
Kaine just got his biggest cheer yet, with a standing ovation, when he said that teachers deserve more than good thoughts and that they deserve a "living wage."
On education: "Expand our field of what it means to be educated...We gotta deal with the cost of college. We have to stop saddling our children with mountains of debt."
Kaine says he's "on the edge of his seat" watching what state lawmakers are going to do with Medicaid expansion. He says he'll do whatever he can to help it get through.
"Mr. President, if you want to help the economy, don‚Äôt start trade wars, invest in the infrastructure," Kaine says.
Kaine focusing on five pillars: education, security, health, infrastructure and equality -- for all.
Kaine saying that unlike Trump, "I am not a pessimist," still believes in the potential of the country "and the Commonwealth." In typical fashion, made some references to Trump tweets.
.@timkaine, talking about watching the news that MLK had been shot and killed 50 years ago, when he was 10. His babysitter, who he previously considered perfect, said, "Serves that 'blank' right." "And it just, as a 10-year-old, it just put a cold chill down my spine."
Kaine comes in and opens with saying hellos to local elected officials. https://t.co/WMqS1y3U98
Fairfax (who refused to say President Donald Trump's name in this church) drawing on last year's statewide elections and the high turnout, as well as the Democratic wave in the House of Delegates. "It really was about historic hope in this country and in this world."
.@FairfaxJustin is here (and so is @mikemullin4VA and Vice Mayor Tina Vick). Fairfax just gave a shout out to Mayor Price "who we're gonna re-elect." https://t.co/SFChUg4lyE
For a rally this is extremely quiet. About 100 people in the seats, quietly waiting for Kaine to come on. They've got some semi-bangers playing on the speakers.
.@SenatorLocke says Kaine and "a few more like him" can break the "gridlock and dysfunction across the Potomac." She took a couple hits at her colleagues in the Senate, too (they're all going back next week to decide on a budget plan). "But 2019 is coming."
Now @PriceForDel95 in talking about "the other side" in Richmond this year: "When you can effectively kill 70 commonsense laws for gun reform and be proud of that and brag on that on social media, you do not deserve a promotion to the United States Senate." @NickForVA is running.
.@NNMayorPriceDDS takes the stage: we have a few things in common and he would agree with that I believe. "One is that we both married up, we both have competition this year for election and we both were mayor." Says "we need (Kaine) to stay where he is."
They‚Äôre starting with some speeches before Kaine comes on. My little eye spots other City Council candidates: John Eley (currently a School Board member), Curtis Bethany and Latonya Wallace.
@timkaine @NNMayorPriceDDS @PriceForDel95 Kaine was at Hampton University earlier today for a student town hall. Rally here starts at 7:30 pm but most of the seats are filled already.

No proposed change to the tax rate, BUT assessments are probably going up for 47% of residential homeowners. Last year, it was about 20% of homeowners. This means ~$38 more on the average homeowner‚Äôs tax bill.

And that's it, folks. Public hearing dates to come.
Through other funds (those supported through fees like stormwater), there will be 11 new positions. Cipriano says the these actually save money because they aim to cut out current contracts the city holds.
For "efficiency and cost-savings," Rohlf has proposed cutting seven vacant positions throughout city departments. There will be one new position within the fire department (not a firefighter, there are two academies planned this year for that).
Rohlf is proposing an average 2% raise for city employees, based on performance, which is one percent less than what was proposed and adopted for the current budget.
Unlike the current budget, Rohlf does not want to use $5.3 million out of reserve money as "revenue." She wants to stay "realistic," Cipriano says.
City real estate assessed values are expected to hit a level they haven‚Äôt been at for almost a decade, budget director Lisa Cipriano says. https://t.co/yRo0Qb8jbC
Acting NNPS Superintendent asked the city for an increase of $700K in funding from last year. Rohlf is granting $719K. The School Board votes on its proposed budget tonight. Important: schools' budget is based on the governor's plan from Dec., which is in total flux right now.
Total operating budget (the portion that covers city services AND the portion that is paid for through utility fees/etc): $881 million. That's barely an increase from last year -- of just $555K. Last year the budget went up by 1.4 percent.
OK, here we go with Rohlf's proposed budget for fiscal year 2019 (that's from July 1 to June 30, 2019). No new taxes, but assessments will go up for 47% of residential owners. This is the first time in five years that assessments are generally going up for all property types.
Sorry, I walked back into the room a hair late and missed this. They did make appointments and reappointments ‚Äî but nothing about new members for the PAC. https://t.co/nydafWI0n2

*politics. Maybe politica should be a word, though.
RT @gmoomaw: Gov. Northam rolls out budget to special session with a twist: He  wants any extra revenue to be saved in reserves, not spent.‚Ä¶
You‚Äôll have a story coming from @DaveRess1. I tagged along today to get a better lay of the state politica land (and got to tweet in the meantime. No complaints).
For those who haven‚Äôt been paying super close attention: the House and Senate each passed a budget draft last month. But the House includes Medicaid expansion with work requirements, which most Senate Republicans balked at.
On Medicaid expansion: Northam says they were ‚Äúcloser than we‚Äôve ever been‚Äù on a deal before session ended without a budget on March 10. He does not think lawmakers and his office are ‚Äúthat far apart.‚Äù
Governor‚Äôs office has been talking to lawmakers and negotiating, Northam says when asked what‚Äôs been happening since March 10.
As the governor has previously said, Sec. of Finance Aubrey Layne will be working with the money committees before April 11.
This is all pretty much the same, I believe. The one change is beefing up the reserves even more, with surplus dollars, than he proposed in December. This is to be in the good graces of credit agencies and protect the state from a ‚Äúdownturn.‚Äù
$101 million for raises for law enforcement, firefighters, teachers and other state employees.
‚ÄúWe need more resources to provide treatment‚Äù and help those addicted to opioids, Northam says. Taking federal dollars for Medicaid expansion can free up state money ‚Äî  $108 million ‚Äî  in higher education, he says.
Returns to a ‚Äúclean Medicaid expansion,‚Äù which means it won‚Äôt have work requirements like the House proposed with bipartisan support, he says.
New proposal includes provisions to expand Medicaid, Northam says.
‚ÄúDespite much effort on everyone‚Äôs part, the GA did not pass the most important bill of all ‚Äî the budget bill.‚Äù
