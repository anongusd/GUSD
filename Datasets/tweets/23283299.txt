@BobSikes Depends on the site. Some places I have complete control. Some I get to make suggestions. Some they just write one and ignore me. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 		I don’t worry too much about it unless the headline radically misrepresents the article. I’ve complained and had a few changed before.
@mysteriousrook You’re missing my point. I’m not saying it’s ok to write at Daily Stormer. That’s an extreme and absurd example. I was commenting on people losing their minds over one specific contributor at a site &amp; then harassing other writers over it.
If you don’t like an article, yelling at some other person who happens to also contribute at the same website isn’t fair. They didn’t write what ticked you off and can’t control it. Don’t be a jerk. 2/2
Memo for people confused about how websites work: Contributors are responsible for what’s posted under their byline. They almost never have control over what’s under someone else’s byline. Editors are a different story but not all editors are involved in every article. 1/2

@puppatee @a_place_n_time And it’s not true at all that “usually a first proven offense might result in a short suspension of licensure.” Not at all.
@puppatee @a_place_n_time You’re just speculating. That’s not how the Florida process works. If it gets to the Florida Supreme Court and he fights it all the way, their verdict is final and non appealable.
They describe the procedures incorrectly too. 1st step is NOT demanding response from Gaetz. It’s an initial review by internal Bar committee to see if the allegations in the complaint, if they are true, are sufficient to show a Rule was violated. Then they’d ask for a response.
What a misleading article. Gaetz is NOT facing disbarment. *Maybe* if the tweet leads to a criminal conviction the Bar might come after him but he isn’t facing disbarment at this point. Wildly irresponsible headline. https://t.co/HzAgif4J79 https://t.co/DSptrzASd9

@klf60916 I’m not saying he shouldn’t face consequences if they are able to prove it was a hoax. Filing a false police report is a crime for good reason.
Isn’t it better to live in a country where an actor might do something dramatic for attention (pretty much the definition of 1st world problem, hmm?) rather than gangs roaming streets to attack strangers for being gay/black/etc.? Hate crimes happen but I’m thankful they’re rare.

@Popehat I actually think it’s less stressful to assemble by myself. I can take my time and if I mess up there are no witnesses. Would’ve been nice to have another person to hold the top board while I attached to frame. That was when the dresser fought back. Bruises just now fading. #ouch

Additional info: this dresser comes in *three* boxes, each of which are heavy enough that I could just barely carry them. That’s a lot of parts. I saw one blog that referred to this category of Ikea furniture as the “divorcemakers” because of the number of fights they instigate.

@Beregond That’s fair...&amp; 1 of the most salient concerns I’ve seen raised about just legalizing it. I’m still at the point of wanting to be cautious and deliberate, allowing medical use for a broad and lenient list of conditions, but strict on recreational use until have better safeguards
I want to hear his thoughts on reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I drug. Past studies have shown therapeutic benefits for some medical conditions AND side effects from recreational use.

@LisaBrite I’m not seriously expecting anyone to pay $175 for a hat. They do take several hours though so that’s why I don’t quit the day job and just make hats. Hard to make enough and sell at volume or find people willing to pay for what the labor time is actually worth. So I make gifts.
@LauraWalkerKC I’ve found some very nice blends I like. For hats wool &amp; alpaca is very nice, warm, soft...and ive found some yarn that’s still washable. I’ve done lots of other stuff in different yarns though. Mostly for gifts.

@ASFleischman Most of the people who’ve accused me of virtue-signaling are either anonymous accounts, so they’re cowards (I write under my real name &amp; photo) or they have other posts clearly showing some very nasty racist, etc. views. So yeahhh, I don’t take them seriously at all.
Cruelty is very rarely actually done accidentally. People might *claim* ignorance or that they were just joking or some sort of twisted meaning that makes little logical sense, but they almost always know that what they’re doing or saying is cruel.

Yep. I get similar accusations of “virtue-signaling” on Twitter &amp; email lately. Virtue signaling is when you’re falsely claiming some belief you don’t actually hold in order to impress someone.

@oilfieldtraitor I’m watching my friend’s sweet corgi while she’s in the hospital and if anyone even hurt that dog I’d want to kill them. A 9 lb. chihuahua? Zero threat of harm. Heck, Paris Hilton carried one around in a purse. That cowardly cop shot a purse puppy.
@thatbillokeefe Seriously. Plus also being a total garbage human. FFS the teeny bitty dog wasn’t even close enough to bite him with his teeny little teeth. Was barely barking. That cop is a cowardly bastard.
Seriously if you honestly believe a 9 lb. chihuahua poses any physical threat to you whatsoever, you do not have the physical, mental, and emotional strength to be a police officer. I mean, if you’re that much of a wimp, you might get a paper cut one day and just fall down dead.

@Stephen_Perkins Did they already swipe your card? Is it one of those places that adds a 20% tip to walked tabs? Are you OK w/that? You should be able to leave. Otherwise, unless they gave notice of cash only before you bought drinks they should forgive the tabs. Sucks for the servers though.

I’d love nothing more than to be proven wrong about this. But until then, every single member of Congress can go step on a Lego. 5/5
I see virtually no reason for hope that next year’s Congress will do anything to make it any better, or that whoever wins in 2020 will do anything either. Both parties have proven they lack solutions to rising health care costs for middle class Americans. /4
I’m honestly not differentiating anymore between the Democrats who voted for Obamacare and the Republicans who have refused to fix it. Neither of them care about the millions of Americans in my situation. They have all failed us. I am disappointed in every single one of them. /3
At this point, spending the past few years as a self-employed person who doesn’t have the luxury of employer-provided insurance, &amp; nowhere near rich enough that I can stop worrying about budgeting, our government expects me to pay an insane monthly premium for a lousy plan. /2
I find it infuriating &amp; unforgivable that every single Republican member of Congress ran for office promising to repeal Obamacare &amp; replace it w/something better, &amp; here we are rolling into 2019 with the same problems: rising premiums, limited options, unsustainable spending. /1 https://t.co/1mTQc89IFv

I sent you a DM. Several of them. You hav not responded. I also sent a Ferris Bueller gif, because I am sitting here saying the same thing over and over and getting no response. And you didn’t reply to that either. #bueller #bueller #bueller https://t.co/FHnMiAl3a8
@ReggieMoto @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp Internet
They aren’t replying so I am now sending them Ferris Bueller gifs. Come on, Seth. Figure out a way to actually provide customer service. https://t.co/3tsqTGSDcf
@LisaBrite Having moved back from 5 years out of state, that wasn’t an option
@LisaBrite The one here in Leon County has been a delight for switching drivers license and plates. Easy and very little wait.
And #sorrynotsorry @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp but your rep telling me today that the Sunday rep made a mistake &amp; no one is available until Thursday: NOPE. I was told an appt time of Mon 8 am to noon. Not “maybe we can find someone,” but actually promised someone would show up.
Ha seriously. A whole army of useless unhelpful people. I’d say it’s like the government but seriously the last time I went to the DMV it was much quicker and I did actually get what I needed!!!! https://t.co/5eRLsd7O4o
@Popehat he’s gonna need them. I asked the last person on the phone if they drug tested because I couldn’t figure out why the Sunday tech guy would tell me someone was coming Monday morning when he didn’t mean it unless he was a compulsive liar or high.
I’m learning the game now. They offer to “help however they can.” But @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp doesn’t actually give them any power to help their customers, so “help however they can” means saying “sorry for your inconvenience” but doing absolutely nothing to fix it. 🙄🙄🙄
Now “Seth” boldly ventures forth, having apparently followed his predecessors in reading NONE of the DMs that explain the whole mess. Can you send someone to fix my internet tomorrow, Seth? https://t.co/FHnMiAl3a8
@mypoophonked The internet is down. Shows it’s sending out a WiFi signal on my phone &amp; computer but it won’t actually connect to the internet. They promised to send tech repair this morning but apparently that was a lie &amp; now won’t come until Thursday
@JeremyTiermini Great song...lousy customer service 😂😂😂
Haha yep. Spelled name wrong. https://t.co/eSrAZaFald
I just spent several HOURS messaging with “Katie” and she wouldn’t help me. Anyone wanna take bets on “Autsin’s” chances? (Are you spelling your own name incorrectly, bud?) https://t.co/OyjKZPvM3p
@LisaBrite Yeah I went through that all already. Ugh. I work from home normally and now can’t because of @CenturyLink. “Century Link: Because you’ll wait a freaking century to get anyone to help you!”
@Eeindc @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp They are “sorry for the inconvenience” but refuse to do anything at all to restore internet any sooner.
I’m not the one who promised a tech repair person could be here Monday 8 am — noon. That was @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp. Apparently they just lie and tell you help is coming but they don’t actually mean it. Allegedly they now claim someone is coming Thursday. Ridiculous.
Wow. They really won’t help. Absolutely unacceptable @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp. They are now saying they do see my call on Sunday but didn’t actually assign a tech to the ticket and won’t help us until Thursday.
@brianros1 He seems to have admitted that he took the improper loans that financed the bulk of his campaign, so IMHO he should probably resign. I’ll let others speculate if some sort of criminal law issue is implicated. The party shouldn’t support him for re-election if he decides to stay.
I am so sick of how it is impossible to get customer service to do what the company promised unless I make a public complaint on Twitter. I’m not asking for special treatment; I’m asking for what I was promised. It is so tiresome. https://t.co/NvcZ9vuDyO
Update: “Katie” can’t help me and told me to call tech support again. Thanks for nothing. I’m now going through the game again. “Yes I’ve already tried turning it off and on again...” https://t.co/KSbnicupmT
This isn’t acceptable, @RossSpano. It was an egregious violation of both the letter &amp; the spirit of the campaign finance laws, which actually aren’t that complicated on this issue. Profoundly disappointing. #sayfie #flapol https://t.co/FLQ7fjkAm6
haha I had the same reaction https://t.co/dmnI5CujSC
I just sent you a DM. Please fix this. Waiting until Thursday is not acceptable when we were promised it would be fixed this morning. https://t.co/xzXJ1LinaG
Here’s the record of my 27 minute call to your customer service line yesterday, @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp. Maybe you should look up who answered a call at this time &amp; ask them what the heck they were doing instead of scheduling my tech repair visit? https://t.co/81neLYZytb
@WRGalivan3 @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp I’m so annoyed
@sirensoIiIoquy @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp That’s not an acceptable excuse at all. They told me they were sending a tech person this morning. They don’t get to just pretend that didn’t happen.
@sirensoIiIoquy @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp Here’s the record of my 27 minute call to their tech help line yesterday. They not only had no record of a tech help visit scheduled, they claimed no record of the call at all. I’ve had some bad customer service before but never had one pretend I hadn’t called. 😡😡😡 https://t.co/iV3EdFw2s2
Most annoyingly, they claimed they treat all calls with priority. What garbage. I called the exact same number today that I did yesterday &amp; they pretend I didn’t call before, &amp; refused to help restore the internet before then. Very unhelpful, @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp 3/3
They claimed NO RECORD of an active ticket for the account. Also said they can’t send someone until THURSDAY. Absolutely unacceptable. I told them I work from home &amp; this is a huge inconvenience to not have wifi. /2
Very poor customer service from @CenturyLink @CenturyLinkHelp. I returned home Sat night to find the internet down. I called Sun &amp; went through troubleshooting w/tech help. They couldn’t fix it &amp; promised to send a tech Mon 8am-noon. No one showed up. I called again just now. /1

Anyway, point is, I’ve observed the pain &amp; problems that bone spurs actually cause in person, with my dad. I don’t believe that Trump actually had them. For the guy who demanded proof Obama wasn’t born in Kenya, he should show proof of his foot ouchies. #AndReleaseHisTaxReturns
My Dad developed bone spurs after years of standing on a concrete shop floor (he’s a retired shop teacher). They were very painful &amp; had developed slowly over years (i.e., not suddenly occurred as a young man). He switched to more supportive shoes &amp; some kind of gel shoe insert
*clarification: CLAIMED he had foot ouchies. We’ve never seen evidence the bone spurs were actually real, &amp; he’s shown NO evidence of being affected by them at all, or seeking treatment for them. They don’t just cure themselves! You have to remedy what’s causing the aggravation.

@PhilAmmann cracking jokes and teasing your friends is a very different thing than ascribing evil motives to someone just because they disagree with you politically. I've seen far too many rush to advocate for someone losing their job, or even being doxxed &amp; their families harassed. UGH NO.
Apparently Avenatti arrest might not be an accurate story? I'm still blocking every weirdo in my timeline who's defending hitting a woman in the face. It's inexcusable. And the vitriol some are expressing, almost enthusiastic about finding an excuse to hit a woman, is CREEPY AF.
Some people seem to enjoy being jerks even when there's no benefit to themselves. At least when someone stabs you in the back so they can get ahead, you can objectively see the logic in it. Being mean just for the sake of being mean is pathetic. #subtweet #dontmissyoupeopleatall
@TXTylerNorris No idea what you’re talking about then, or why you’d reply that to an article about Avenatti getting arrested.
Blocking you for being evil. No excuse to beat up a woman. Period. If she was actually hitting him, he would’ve been justified in shoving her away, not smashing in her face.

“She hit me first”?! If that’s accurate, what a f***ing coward Avenatti is. I googled photos of his wife (and I’ve met him briefly).

Owning a gun doesn’t make you a killer. Having PTSD doesn’t make you a killer. Assaulting women, on the other hand, is a f***ing gigantic red flag that a man is more likely to be willing to commit increasingly violent acts. Didn’t want to derail his career with the Marines?! UGH.
You have to be f***ing kidding me. How often do these guys commit acts of violence against women, make terrifying threats, &amp; nothing done until they kill someone?! Another school system like Broward that didn’t intervene to protect from a violent man. 🤬	  https://t.co/SwuKcjgtAB

@MileHighBrendan Well in FL, the Democrat SOEs in Orange (Orlando) and Dade (Miami) managed better. Broward is an actual, documented sh**show circus mess.
@JohnGPettus I loved working Election Day. Great fun to be a part of the process
@JohnGPettus And anything that did happen was quickly and satisfactorily resolved. Again, Orange SOE is a Democrat. I had no problem working with him &amp; his lawyer. Went very smoothly. Broward is a ****ing circus.
@JohnGPettus I would hope anyone who tried that would be prosecuted. But candidates and parties are supposed to be briefed on procedures &amp; have ability to observe. I honestly am not sure what level of observational access was granted in Broward. In Orange &amp; Seminole, we rarely had problems
Here, y’all. Just ONE example of the awful incompetence of the Broward SOE. This is a south FL paper (NOT conservative media by any means!) reporting on a court ruling: https://t.co/ikAPuZ4dSk https://t.co/eAA8I1YW6a
@JohnGPettus Well I literally was an election lawyer in Florida for my home county so no conspiracies here. Just what I know.
@JohnGPettus And it’s not a conspiracy to not trust Broward SOE. There are court rulings detailing their problems.
You err on the side of counting the ballot when it’s ticky-tack stuff like the signature on an absentee envelope is a little different, newlywed changing last name etc. If chain of custody isn’t perfectly followed, you can’t. No way to trust a ballot if we don’t know the custody. https://t.co/i9dc35NlH6
@RealSagacity @FloridaGOP I’m a Southern girl. This is not new information. 😉 https://t.co/AMAMx5hG5f
I’m so effing mad about this incompetence. Gonna make a cup of tea (literally) and try to write something up. It is NOT OK. And this isn’t a partisan thing. Bill Cowles, the Orange SOE, does a solid job &amp; he’s a Democrat. Should clone him &amp; send one to Broward.
For the record y’all, I’m not saying stuff to argue. I was 1 of the lawyers for @FloridaGOP for two election cycles &amp; responsible for training &amp; supervising all our poll workers. I know the rules. Ballot security is a big freaking deal, &amp; Snipes appears to have screwed up.
Chain of custody MUST be perfect or there’s no way to trust a ballot. They aren’t printed on rare proprietary cloth paper like money. Given a few hours I could probably create passable forgeries with a laser printer and a sharpie. That’s the problem with this situation. https://t.co/l5YEk0GnRZ
@kapoano At least some of them seem to have chain of custody problems
If she failed to maintain security and chain of custody standards, they cannot be viewed as valid votes and should not be counted. Incompetence has its costs. https://t.co/nDaLevatlB
She’s absolute garbage. And that’s in a county with Scott Israel as sheriff. https://t.co/6PjQbwNuhR
@msbishop Oh it’s worse than that. The current SOE destroyed ballots in a 2016 race. The Canova vs. @DWStweets Democrat primary.
If they re-elect Sheriff Israel, maybe we should let Trump build a wall, but just around Broward County. 		(Note for the humorless weirdos: this is sarcasm. Don’t get your panties or other undergarment of choice in a knot. I have friends and family in Broward.) 2/2
Broward also re-elected all the school board members who implemented &amp; supported the idiotic discipline policies that missed multiple chances to intervene w/the Parkland shooter that would’ve gotten his counseling &amp; prevented him from legally buying guns. 1/2 https://t.co/2lfexmmSSB

And don’t give me that crap about Broward being more metropolitan. The county’s population wasn’t a surprise! They have a bigger budget &amp; are supposed to plan to manage the situation. Miami got their votes in on time. No excuse for Broward. It’s either corruption or incompetence.
@funnyfarmrodeo She. And she’s been legally declared in violation of the law before. Illegally destroyed ballots early that were the subject of a lawsuit.
There are parts of the Florida Panhandle that still don’t have fully functional roads and utilities but all those counties got their votes in on time. The Broward Supervisor of Elections is a complete embarrassment.
What the actual F is going on in Broward? If the SOE cannot maintain chain of custody and security for ballots, then we can’t trust any results. Inexcusable. https://t.co/hwVhtTE5My

@GaltsGirl @EWErickson We should take a break from politics and do a podcast or radio show just chatting about great music. And maybe comfort food recipes too.
@GaltsGirl @EWErickson Trent Reznor himself effusively praised how Cash covered his song. And, I just googled it — Paul Simon was very gracious about the cover of his.
@EWErickson @GaltsGirl I characterize it like Cash’s cover of Hurt, which makes me tear up almost every time I hear it. There’s a raw, seething pain in Disturbed’s version that isn’t there in the Simon &amp; Garfunkel version.

@LouiseMensch @jessicanseale looking like Scott and DeSantis may squeak by with very narrow wins. The polls have showed the Ds winning for weeks but within the margin of error, and as I and many other Floridians have pointed out, polling in the hurricane-ravaged Panhandle has been tough.
Good! This is the right thing to do. https://t.co/Y17AlLDkNd

FYI I’m discovering this now because of a google alert.
After the article, Graham DMed me to say a reporter from Inside Sources wanted to reach out to me &amp; I gave him permission to pass on my contact info, but she didn’t ever contact me. So I remain perplexed why she would write that I “told Inside Sources” anything. WE NEVER SPOKE.
Here’s Graham’s article. https://t.co/GhdXnJsLqN you’ll see a snarky comment at the end from me about how DeSantis might use that MA billboard in an ad. That was a joke, not a serious assessment of FL political campaign strategies.
This is super bizarre. The article seems to be paraphrasing from Graham’s Herald article but doesn’t cite it and attributes comments to me that I did not say. Not cool.
Hey @InsideSourcesDC can you explain how I “told Inside Sources” anything since I haven’t actually talked to this reporter or anyone else from your site? I chatted w/@IAMMGraham for a @bostonherald article on this topic, not you. And I never said this. 🤨 https://t.co/4XkEq05FrB

@ViennaCovfefe Duncan Hunter and Steve King’s opponents would be able to earn my vote. Honestly haven’t researched them to say for sure, but those two guys wouldn’t get my vote. I’m glad Roy Moore lost.
@SnarkActual Yep. I’m willing to evaluate races on a case-by-case basis. Some Rs are unacceptable (Roy Moore, Steve King, Duncan Hunter) because of corruption, positions they take, etc. The Ds seem mostly uninterested in doing anything to earn my vote except not be Trump. That’s not enough.
Democrats love #NeverTrump-ers except when we refuse to vote for corrupt, extremely liberal Ds. #SorryNotSorry I’m still a pro-life libertarian-conservative. The GOP hasn’t gotten a penny from me or a minute of my time since nominating Trump but I’m not refusing to vote for Rs.
I voted for Putnam in the primary. He’d be a better governor than either the R or D nominees. Gwen Graham wouldn’t have been a disaster. In judging Gillum vs. DeSantis, Gillum gives me no confidence he will be able to manage the job. Hurricane Hermine alone proved that.
I call myself a #NeverTrump-er based on my track record since Trump pushed that idiotic birther crap. I have NEVER supported TRUMP being elected to anything, period. And the reality of FL Gov means DeSantis will have to hire good people to help manage the depts. He’ll be fine. https://t.co/YvydYCCJYs
I understand why Jolly made this decision but this #NeverTrump-er is voting DeSantis. Gillum’s tenure as Tallahassee mayor proves he hasn’t earned a promotion to manage our whole state. Plus, the bribery issue! I’ll never vote for Trump but I won’t support corruption either. https://t.co/ETIJqsVSWg

@RBPundit @JayCaruso @sbsaysthings Sigh. Again. He’s not telling people to just “vote for Democrats.” He’s saying to there are races where the R may be unworthy of your vote. I wouldn’t vote for Duncan Hunter or Steve King if I lived in their districts. I’m glad Roy Moore lost.
@RBPundit @JayCaruso @sbsaysthings Sorry I don’t see your point. He’s done ads for GOP candidates and PACs for years.

@RBPundit @sbsaysthings That’s fine. I wouldn’t fault anyone for making that decision. But I also won’t fault someone for deciding in their district the D candidate is a better choice for them. If people actually studied issues &amp; voted accordingly instead of blind party loyalty we’d have better gov’t.
@RBPundit @sbsaysthings There are local races where I would vote for a Democrat. I have voted for a few local Ds over the years when the R was nuts, corrupt, very unqualified, etc. No candidate automatically gets my vote. Every single one must earn it anew every single election.
@sunnyright So if Rick goes to work for Avenatti I’ll buy you a beer. But I’m confident I’ll never ever have to buy that beer.
@sunnyright key word in that sentence is “before.”
@sbsaysthings @RBPundit I’m not voting for any of the Ds running here in FL. But I think it’s possible there’s some districts where I wouldn’t vote for the R. Duncan Hunter seems beyond sleazy, for example.
@sunnyright He wasn’t “associating” with him. We were all in Austin at the same conference. I saw Avenatti too at the Google party on evening and chatted briefly with him. I’m just not a big enough deal for anyone to report that as newsworthy.
@RBPundit He didn’t say vote Democrat. The actual quote was to analyze the race in your district because there are some where the D candidate is to the right of the R on issues like trade and spending etc.
@sunnyright yeah he’s doing just fine with the book deals. I’m laughing at how the entire conservative media world can’t see obvious trolling. He’s not working with Avenatti. 🙄

That Facebook story was covered months ago and cleared up and Gillum just flat out lied about it. Despicable. #FLGOVDebate
WOW BLATANT LIE BY GILLUM. DeSantis did NOT moderate that FB Page. Total BS. #FLGOVDebate
@DeeInHouston I’m yelling at the tv much to the amusement of my parents (at their NC cabin right now)
RT @crowleyreport: Every minute spent talking about FBI investigation does not help @AndrewGillum.
“We all have friends that sometimes let us down,” says Gillum. None of my friends have ever done anything to get me mixed up in an FBI investigation. You’ve got some crappy friends, Mayor. 😂😂😂 #FlGovDebate #sayfie #flapol

Oh FFS, Gillum just said a majority % of FL businesses don’t pay taxes. That’s because they’re LLCs, S-corps, certain types of small businesses w/pass-thru taxation. The owners pay income tax if &amp; when the business makes a profit. #FlGovDebate #sayfie #flapol

@acitrano Nope. Lots of conservatives (especially my friends in their 30s and 40s) are completely fine with all types of diversity and are disgusted by the Trumpian rhetoric. Lived in big cities, had ideas challenged /5 liberal-leaning colleges...still definitely conservative though.
@DeeInHouston Seriously!
@acitrano Amen amen
@acitrano honestly I think it’s all mixed up together. The newsrooms at NYT etc. skew liberal because their staff is almost all liberal, they don’t hire conservatives because...around and around
@acitrano Both political parties traffic in lies as it suits them. Declaring one side or the other to be the worse sinner misses the point. We can’t stop politicians from lying or humans from being biased. The answer is to make it as easy as possible to share competing ideas.
Of course, the REAL solution would be for newsrooms to make an effort to get some ideological diversity on their staff. One designated token conservative op-ed writer doesn’t really count (especially because they’re almost always moderate-bordering-on-almost liberal). 3/3
On the flip side, I’d point to the NYT &amp; WaPo as revealing their liberal bias quite frequently, &amp; would similarly say the way to respond is not to want them shut down, but to shine a spotlight on any problems. /2
I never ever said they should be able to lie. Muting you now for proving you’re unable to participate in an intelligent debate. Making up nonsense I never said is not a valid argument. #byefelicia https://t.co/iV5pUJm0X6
Maybe I’m a free speech purist but I kinda think the system is working as it should. Sinclair can do what it wants w/media properties it owns &amp; other media outlets can criticize them. If you don’t like what they say, share your own message. Would be problem if couldn’t criticize. https://t.co/w4seXTC5Yi
What a silly question. Of course not. And Schumer 1) hasn’t even been offered an ad, and 2) if she was, it would be to sell chips or beer or something, not a political statement she disagreed with. https://t.co/NJxihWq0KD
hahaha she didn’t actually have an offer to do an ad. So she’s publicly preening that she’s so righteous for turning down something she did not actually have. Oh what a joke.

@LisaBrite Fair points
I’m generally skeptical of universities claiming to achieve diversity w/such a heavy handed focus on race, but there is something to the idea that different life experiences bring a richness to an educational environment.		But if I’m not a “woman of color,” neither is Warren. 3/3
*That’s* the problem w/Warren’s story. It’s not impossible she had Native American heritage, it’s that it’s so far removed that the claim is laughable, if not offensive. The actual Cherokee Tribe does seem offended...justifiably so. She hasn’t shared their experiences. /2
My 23andMe report. This is the results other than the 98.9% that’s a sampler platter of Europe...including 0.2% Native American. 		If I tried to claim I was a “woman of color” like #ElizabethWarren — and it seems I’m more “diverse” than she is — that would be ridiculous. /1 https://t.co/EGbB1R7R8I
Ha, nice. “Trumpskeptic™️” https://t.co/SBTjrKICCy

I have zero regrets about not voting for Trump &amp; will not vote for him in 2020. But I also don’t dive into a DEFCON1 panic about everything Trump does. The judicial nominees have been solid. I have no problem saying that. 2/2
Interesting discussion. I’d still argue there are far more who aren’t extremists either way, like me, but we don’t scream as loudly and are more easily overlooked. I’ve been thinking “Trump Skeptical” might be a good description that captures where many people are. 1/2 https://t.co/cFXaQCTQUY

Whoever it was deleted the tweet but it said something about how we’d see once he got on the bench what he’s like as a judge. Again, we do have publicly available info on that exact subject.
@MrJonCryer Just a few thoughts, a long thread to reply to yours. Mostly I just hate this whole process and legitimately fear we’ve done significant harm to the institutions. I wouldn’t apply for a job if it meant submitting to humiliating questions about drinking in college. No effing way.
@MrJonCryer “Judicial temperament” doesn’t demand that judges float through life serenely &amp; meekly. He was accused of gang rape. I’d be pissed too. He’s been on the bench for years &amp; I do believe that pattern is far more deeply ingrained in him than the circus of the past few weeks.
He has literally authored over 300 opinions and that’s all been publicly available this whole time. I’ve looked up several dozen of them. They’re worth reading. Check out the EPA cases. Good thoughtful discussions of regulatory authority. (Ok maybe that’s just me being a nerd) https://t.co/SbbSygkJjv
@MrJonCryer ...focusing on the statutory authority granted by Congress to the EPA to regulate a particular issue. There are several opinions he’s written like that.
@MrJonCryer The EPA cases he’s had, for example, he’s sympathetic &amp; supportive of environmental causes. Has flat out said climate change is real &amp; needs to be a priority. When he’s ruled against the EPA, it hasn’t been voicing opposition to pro-environmental policy, but instead...
@MrJonCryer I heard Kavanaugh’s comments as being upset &amp; angry over the threats to his family &amp; the media pushing unverified stories, not a broad attack against all liberals. His substantial written record as a judge isn’t overly partisan.
@MrJonCryer Re: partisan accusations. I’ve personally criticized radical activists on both sides but not intended to impugn motives to the entire party. The alt right is detestable; not all Trump voters are racists. Radical liberals who threatened R Senators don’t represent the whole D party
@MrJonCryer I don’t know him, never met him. But I do know others who have worked with him, &amp; women who have been in offices with him. Never one whisper of inappropriate conduct. And women do chatter when a guy is a creep, to at least warn each other.
@MrJonCryer They also said they knew Kavanaugh’s wife, before they started dating. Felt protective of her. Rove mentioned some sweet nickname he &amp; his wife called her, I forgot. Point is they both said they wouldn’t have let her date Kavanaugh if they had any concerns about his character.
@MrJonCryer Neither Rove nor McKinnon are Trump fans — quite the opposite. They aren’t trying to curry favor w/the GOP right now. They didn’t like the tone of his statement but described that as an anamoly, out of character for him.
@MrJonCryer I was in Austin for the @TexasTribune festival last week &amp; Karl Rove &amp; Mark McKinnon were on a panel about the GWB campaign. Someone asked about Kavanaugh. Both knew him well &amp; had worked w/him for years. Long hours, late nights. They both defended his character without question.
@MrJonCryer This story we keep seeing with Cosby, Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly etc. where a creep isn’t a creep just once, but repeatedly, that’s the normal pattern. I’ve witnessed that myself. Thankfully never been raped, but I’ll just say #MeToo, &amp; it wasn’t an isolated incident.
@MrJonCryer I’ve known a lot of guys like Kavanaugh. Smart, ambitious, nerdy but still willing to party and drink. A lot of people who cut loose on weekends but still ended up on Law Review. An intrusive interrogation on such subjects decades later would be a shock.
@MrJonCryer I’d have to search for it but some other people have explained the calendar stuff. Re: the drinking...his actual testimony he admitted he drank and partied. I’ll admit I drank before I was 21 and had a damn good time in college. I’d never expect to be interrogated about that.
@MrJonCryer The Rs who declared her a liar before they heard from her are wrong, &amp; the attacks that she’s some kind of paid operative, ugh that’s just gross. I wasn’t there 36 years ago but *something* traumatic happened to her. Normal people aren’t good enough actors. She was clearly upset.
@MrJonCryer That letter was held by Ds &amp; then its existence leaked w/o her consent. She said she was a sexual assault victim &amp; asked for confidentiality. That understandable request was violated &amp; that was wrong.
@MrJonCryer It’s ok. Strong opinions justified here. I’m honestly of “a pox on both your houses” opinion of this. Ford wrote a letter in confidence to ask for an investigation, maybe assuming maybe he was like Weinstein or Roy Moore &amp; digging around could uncover other victims if so?

@marthaj44 This kind of experience is often more common w/people who are NOT frequent drinkers. Heavy drinkers both build up a tolerance (i.e. less likely to suddenly drop into incapacity) &amp; get a feeling for how alcohol affects them. They’ll get wasted, maybe even vomit, but not pass out.
Co-sign to this thread. The article is garbage &amp; the author didn’t bother to reach out to the MANY of us who have publicly criticized the whole “boys will be boys” crap. https://t.co/2nwdereNpV
@1975jetsfan4 great reference 🍻 https://t.co/RKdnk2lJaM
Anyone else who went to a large university finding all this handwringing over drinking bizarre? I witnessed a lot of alcohol use in college (and partook myself, not trying to hide anything). Lots of people drink — even heavily — but aren’t actually *passing out* or *blacking out* https://t.co/uUZc1OxFeY

Interesting point by @RichLowry on @TheLeadCNN: if eyewitness testimony were foolproof, there'd be no need for the @Innocence Project, which uses DNA &amp; other evidence to get people out of jail after decades, after witnesses swore they were guilty. #Kavanaugh @jaketapper

The @delta employee, Ramon, at the help desk, sincerely apologized for the inconvenience (again, something American didn’t bother to do) &amp; quickly rebooked my flight. Also asked a physical description of my bag to make it easier for them to find and track.
.@delta also tried very hard to help us make our connecting flights. The pilot asked everyone to let those of us with the earliest connections off the plane first, &amp; announced at which gate we were arriving. American did none of that on my horrible flight from New Orleans.
So I missed my ATL-TLH connection because of weather delays but happily @Delta has been superior to @AmericanAir in every aspect. Quickly got me on standby for the next flight out &amp; confirmed for a later one if that doesn’t work.

@brianros1 Apparently not. I’ve literally been getting threats all day long because I had the audacity to say on MSNBC this am that I didn’t have enough info to automatically believe Ford &amp; she needed to come forward &amp; speak. “Rape apologist” was one of the nicer things I was called. 🙄
Accusations should be heard &amp; accusers treated with respect. Those who are being accused should also be treated with respect, &amp; given the right to question their accusers (again, with respect). If you want to effect major consequences on someone’s life, you must come forward. 2/2
Exactly right. And this is why we have a long tradition in this country of settling disputes with competing testimony and cross-examination questioning, whether it’s a criminal case, civil lawsuit, or congressional hearing. 1/2 https://t.co/g59yd23v09

@mdcrosbie I’m here! I know! Where are you?
@MeredithAncret Yikes
@MSarelson @AJDelgado13 I’ve never met her but please tell her I feel absolutely horrible for her. No woman should have to deal with such horrible treatment.
It absolutely is attempted murder on the mother. Even under the best circumstances, that pill can have side effects. That’s dangerous if you don’t know &amp; don’t have medical supervision. And she did lose the baby. Horrible. Takes a truly depraved mind to even consider such a thing https://t.co/S1Vpl5p391
I sincerely hope this isn’t true. That’s a horrific crime if so. But just based on what we know about how he’s treated the two known mothers of his children, Jason Miller is a vile piece of crap. CNN should stop giving him a platform. https://t.co/bcdduyj48T

For the trolls who have listening/reading comprehension problems: I’m not a Trump supporter. I didn’t vote for him in 2016 and won’t vote for him in 2020. I cheered Roy Moore losing his race in Alabama. Bye. 🙄
Coming up next on @amjoyshow with @JoyAnnReid on msnbc! Topic: my favorite soup recipes. Just kidding, we’re talking about #Kavanaugh 😉
@msbishop It’s very annoying
@msbishop Ugh that’s annoying
On my way to the studio now! Will be on during the 11 am ET hour! https://t.co/Y5FNjiw3K1
@mchastain81 Awwww
@ProducerSusan Haha oh i feel ya
So basically he’s way more thoughtful and kindhearted than virtually every adult politician on both sides of the aisle. Kudos to him. Depressing such stories are so rare. https://t.co/2e6uCfMhP6
@ProducerSusan Ha yes. It’s me smirking at how absurd everything is lately
@PithyPunk It’s not posturing. I literally wrote multiple articles on this exact tactic. Not my fault you’re too dumb or lazy to read. Bye now.
@DiXieTwo82 Beto’s minions get my name right half the time and completely wrong the other half.
RT @DiXieTwo82: @rumpfshaker I've gotten 3 Beto texts. Not one has called me the correct name. Or even the same wrong name. https://t.co/Yq…
@TXTylerNorris I don’t care. I honestly don’t care if it was a Republican. Spamming unsolicited texts is a garbage tactic and they should be embarrassed.
I’ve given up being polite. Now I’m either openly rude or if I have time I catfish them a bit. https://t.co/upKs98QJW9
Spare me your outrage. I’ve attacked that tactic. In fact, I was the one who broke the story when he tried something similar in the 2016 Iowa primary. 🙄 https://t.co/DjGocDUa51 https://t.co/VHIzMJn2KD
@StacyLynn624 Ha but that would require me downloading cruz pics 😳
Whoever Joseph Kopser is, I never gave him my #. I didn’t give it Beto either but he somehow got it. If the Kopser campaign has it, Beto’s campaign either gave or sold them a list. Someone oughta check to make sure that is properly included on the campaign finance reports, hmm? https://t.co/BqyruoQYFx
Spamming everyone’s cell phones for Beto wasn’t enough for the idiotic Texas Democrats. Now I’m getting texts for some random congressional candidate. This is a garbage tactic. Stop spamming with unsolicited texts. This alone is enough to make me wish all of you lose. #txlege
So I’m going to be on @amjoyshow tomorrow morning on @msnbc chatting about all the latest #Kavanaugh stuff. Should be interesting. Hope you can watch!
They’re. Not. Actually. Protesting. The. Flag. https://t.co/Ive397jN1k

RT @JoePCunningham: Only witchcraft could have kept Trump on message this week, so it’s time to get a duck and solve this mystery.
@NathanWurtzel It’s my new acoustic ska polka band
Here’s today’s example in Poorly Run PACs Wasting $: “You’ve relocated to Florida. Now you need to register to vote in Florida. President Trump needs allies in Florida.”		I moved back 6 months ago, already registered &amp; DID vote in the primary. And helping Trump won’t motivate me. https://t.co/yB8GO36OkN

@pagalvin Clueless about stamps? Sure, I’d believe that. Unable to figure out how to get some? I’m skeptical. And unsympathetic.
@SooperMexican Yeah I don’t think we’ve reached a point where we have a way to conduct them accurately
@heefy The ones I’ve seen in FL and TX required stamps.
Ehhh. An “Ipsos online poll” and I don’t see details about sample size, geographic/gender/partisan balancing of the sample, and other crosstab info that would lend credibility. https://t.co/2TJN31lcaJ
I’m glad we abolished poll taxes but tbh if you’re *in college* and can’t figure out *how to google* where to buy stamps (or how to drop off your ballot at the supervisor of elections office), I’m having trouble feeling sympathetic. https://t.co/F2aEegnR5r
