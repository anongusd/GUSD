@charlie_gnarly @infooverload @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump I know they are recorded, but the FBI swears they don't listen in unless they have FISA court approval.  Of course, we know that's not true--all that's needed is a fake dossier!  BUT, YOU don't have a right to know what any of those conversations are about as you said above!
@NBCNews U.S. Attorney, Joe diGenova, said everyone who gets a letter from these committees should ignore it as it's a perjury trap. Then if they get a subpoena, they should appear in court and plead the 5th. That's what Hilliary's cohorts did! Smart advice &amp; I hope they follow it!
@MSNBC According to the Washington Post??  Oh great!  Now we have two FAKE NEWS media quoting each other?  LOL  Then it's DOUBLE FAKE NEWS!
@dcexaminer @SpeakerPelosi What a novel approach for @SpeakerPelosi to request Dems put the American people first! She knows the more 'witch hunts,' the more Trump's approval ratings keep going up, which incidentally went up again this weekend after Trump's CPAC speech!
@KamalaHarris This insane idea of yours isn't gonna get you any votes! Come up with some more ridiculous ideas &amp; you'll find yourself wondering what happened, just like Hillary did! We're not giving the gov anymore of our rights!  Try voter ID for something where people would support you!
@john_ray3dogs @KamalaHarris Hello?  This conversation is about guns, not Trump!
@JoeBunnies @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Wow you're very insightful!  Impressive!  😀
Hi Elea.  Your material is so adorable.  I'll bet your mother is so proud to have such an artistic daughter!  😀
@charlie_gnarly @infooverload @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump No you don't! Presidents have ALWAYS talked to other Presidents &amp; Prime Ministers in public &amp; by phone &amp; no one has questioned what was said before now because they might be discussing national security issues, which the public has NO right to know! It's just a Trump-hater thing!
@riconap @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Don't you know opinions are a dime a dozen &amp; everybody has one?  Please provide some facts for each of your accusations so everyone can be enlightened!  And BTW, the Prez is 72!  lol
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump U.S. Attorney, Joe diGenova, said everyone who gets a letter from these committees should ignore it as it's nothing more than a perjury trap. Then if they get a subpoena, they should appear &amp; plead the 5th. That's what Hilliary's cohorts did! Smart advice &amp; I hope they follow it!
@BernieSanders Bernie must be worried about getting some black peoples' votes!  Congress JUST passed a criminal justice reform bill!  Where were Bernie's ideas then?  He must have missed those meetings &amp; the vote!  Bernie, the black folk aren't falling for your baloney because they know better!
@KamalaHarris Blah, blah, blah! More promises when there's no way to pay for it! Just a bunch of promises that you hope people will fall for until you get elected and like a typical Dem president, the promises to the people are forgotten!  There's only one thing--the people are getting smart!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Wow, Maddow strikes twice in one day!  She's really desperate for attention today!  She must be having a blue Monday the poor person!
@BernieSanders FINALLY, ole Bernie says something that makes sense!!  But not much else he rambles on about is even close to reality!
@robreiner Words of wisdom from the wise one himself - MEATHEAD!  lol
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog This is just another Maddow drama to try to increase her ratings! She comes out with these weekly &amp; sometimes daily when she needs attention, the pitiful person!  I thought Lindsey's answer was perfect!

@SpeakerPelosi My Nancy, you really did a lot --- a lot of nonsense &amp; another chance to get your picture taken!  That's really impressive!  When are you going to do something that helps the American people?  		WALKAWAY!  TRUMP2020
@GeraldoRivera How can you be a Jewish Zionist &amp; be critical of Israel occupying the land GIVEN to them by God?  They are NOT occupying Palestinian land! That's an outright lie and if you didn't know it, Geraldo, then you should!! If you're such an investigative reporter then invesigate that!
@JoaquinCastrotx @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump I'm even more glad that the President has veto power so the wall will finally be built----no thanks to the idiotic Dems who are too lazy to go to the border &amp; see the situation for themselves!
@dcexaminer Desperados!  They are going to lose their minds if they don't find a crime soon!  @RepAdamSchiff has already lost his!
@RepHarley I'll bet if each member of the House &amp; Senate was investigated like President Trump has been, a bunch would be in prison!  One day they will all be judged by God Almighty &amp; there won't be attorneys or a jury!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Another one of Maddow's drama stories to try to keep up her ratings! She's got a new one every week &amp; sometimes daily!
@benshapiro Abortion is neither health care, nor a right!  		It's MURDER!  "Thou shalt not kill."		And @ACLU, founded by Communists, is &amp; has always been an advocate for everything evil!
@MSNBC How in the world will one figure out who's best when the list keeps growing daily? Should be interesting to watch them try to outdo each other!
@Leod11Dawn @MSNBC You live in CANADA?  And you're spewing all your hatred for Trump?  Maybe you should be more concerned about Justin Trudeau, as I understand he's not too loved right now either!  Ciao!  Shalom!
@Leod11Dawn @MSNBC I guess everyone can't be perfect like you, EXCEPT such hatred says you're certainly not perfect either! You need to attend church, read a Bible &amp; pray so you can get some REAL PEACE, because with real peace you don't talk like that!  In the meantime, chill before you stroke out!
@kealy_shae @MSNBC I can read signs, but I can't read pics like you said!   LOL  TRUMP ROCKS! I've never been to Charlottesville &amp; you probably haven't either, so I'm guessing it's something you must have seen (or read) on FAKE NEWS!  Ciao - Shalom!
@dog884 @NBCNews Some Israelis are black, some Spanish, but most are descendants of Abraham, Issac &amp; Jacob through the line of Judah (Jews). It is believed that those not descended from Abraham are of the 10 lost tribes of Israel.  But this has nothing to do with my original comment.
@PetuniaCatLand @MSNBC Why is it that radical Dems have such anger &amp; can't have a normal conversation, but instead resort to calling names? Cohen, who's going to prison for lying, produced one check that proved nothing.  Trump has been paying Cohen checks for 10 years!
@Leod11Dawn @MSNBC You want peace &amp; love (per your bio)?  Your vulgar comment sounds more like anger &amp; hate!  Your comment is simply YOUR opinion, but everybody else has one too!
@MikePrevost3 @MSNBC Hillary's incomplete investigation was a coverup by Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, etc. If you believe Hillary deleted 35,000 emails about Chelsey's wedding &amp; used bleach &amp; hammers on her equipment to destroy them, but wasn't hiding anything, then you are gullible! I sleep fine!
@dcexaminer The billions of dollars spent by the Kochs &amp; others on politics is so ridiculous!  That money could better be spent by helping to lift Americans out of poverty.  What a waste!
@MSNBC Just another liberal Democrat still "desperately" searching for anything on Trump because their 2-year search on Russian collusion has fallen apart. It's all because Hillary lost. If they spent this wasted time on getting something done for Americans, it would be a great America.
@meeknomore @MSNBC I pay very close attention! The things that outrage me are the radical Dems who believe it's okay to kill babies; that it's okay to be a people hater, especially Jews, God's chosen people, &amp; that they want to force me to give up my car, my electricity, my house, beef, etc.
@kealy_shae @MSNBC You read pics? LOL Trump rallies? I've been to a Trump rally and know they didn't look like that except when booing the FAKE NEWS!  Everybody was happy, upbeat &amp; having a blast! BUT outside the rally, radical Dems looked exactly like that screaming &amp; angry &amp; cussing &amp; not white!
@dog884 @NBCNews Oh I do?  Then enlighten me!
@kealy_shae @MSNBC That's a typical radical Dem response to use a vulgar meme!  LOL  What's funny is that's exactly what the typical radical Dem looks like these days, except it's missing anyone black, so that says a lot about you!
@dog884 @NBCNews What's patriotic about being an anti-Semite? You know the Jesus you &amp; I worship (per your bio) was a Jew! In the Bible God told Abraham, father of the Jews, "I will bless those that bless you &amp; curse those that curse you." Be careful that you don't call God's curse on yourself!
@NBCNews To:@SpeakerPelosi: If you &amp; @RepEliotEngel are in charge of the Dems, as you believe you are, then why has Ilhan Omar not been removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee. I'm furious because her comments are outrageous &amp; continue daily! She needs to GO NOW!
@1coastwriter @MSNBC When did he say that?  Please point me to the article (and not fake news) or video showing that.  Thanks!
@meeknomore @MSNBC There is something!  It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome - aka Trump haters!
@BradBurch16 @MSNBC Why did people lie about what?
@NYCMayor You're the dang mayor of NYC, so instead of whining all the time about your bad subways, FIX THEM!  Or are you running low on funds because people are moving out because of your insane ideas &amp; high taxes?  Get a grip on reality!
@AOC You should be watching Trump's CPAC speech where he's making your ideas look as stupid as they really are!  And he's hilarious &amp; so fun to watch because he's not spewing hatred!
@kealy_shae @MSNBC Maybe you're the one that needs to face reality &amp; start watching Fox News for some REAL NEWS instead of so much FAKE NEWS that has muddled your thinking!
@Ptjones1968 @BBCBreaking It's YOUR remarks trying to take my comments out of context &amp; my calling you on it that irked you! I told you to take your comments to another Trump hater so you can get some "likes." I've wasted enough time on your nonsense so a block seems to be in order!
@AOC @RashidaTlaib Tokenism? You're the "token" of the Democrat party reflecting nothing other than stupidity &amp; ignorance! And the more you mouth off with your radical ignorant ideas, the more Democrat voters you turn off who will vote Republican, including your constituents!
@MSNBC Those constantly spewing their hateful accusations about the President being racist are the ones that are the real racists!  They can't come up with any other reasons for their hatred for the President, so they resort to calling names &amp; making false accusations!
@Ptjones1968 @BBCBreaking If you have no feeling about my tweet, then why do you keep responding? LOL Again it's obvious you can read or retain what you read! I wasn't quoting a FACT; I said "I THINK!" Duh! I don't need to give Trump credibility as his record proves that! So go bother someone else!
@washingtonpost This is just another ignorant writer of FAKE NEWS! No negotiations are handled the same way. One is dealing with radical Muslims who SAY? they have NO nukes; the other is dealing with a person that DOES have nukes &amp; has threatened to use them, in case that slipped your mind!
@WireAmerican Thank you President Trump for making the wall a priority as it is a national emergency! Those who don't agree have never been to the border, so they're simply giving uneducated responses because they are Trump haters!  And don't send me hate tweets because I'll just block you!
@dcexaminer @AOC AOC &amp; her radical &amp; ignorant ideas are one of the MAIN reasons that people will vote Republican, in case she didnt know that! So she doesn't need to threaten anyone, just look in the mirror! She might think she's cutesy &amp; the boss, but she's actually a real turnoff to voters!
@Ptjones1968 @BBCBreaking If you don't like my tweet &amp; can't respond according to what I said, not what you "think" I said, then politely move on to someone who might value your opinion!
@Ptjones1968 @BBCBreaking Paul. can't you read?  Who said anything about best friends?  Re-read my tweet &amp; then respond sensibly!
RT @DavidWohl: This woman needs a thorough medical/psychiatric evaluation. There's something definitely wrong with her! https://t.co/blVbc4…
@MonitaRajpal @AOC Matthew 24:7 warns about earthquakes in diverse places. Luke 21:25 says, "... and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves. These are just the beginning of things to come &amp; will intensify as it gets closer to Christ’s return.

@PreetBharara You all are digging in the trash can for ANYTHING on President Trump.  If the President wants Kushner to have security clearance that's his perogative!  Old Cummings has been in Congress for a 100 years &amp; all he does is bark.  Looks like a bulldog anyway!
@MSNBC She's nothiing more than a racist, anti-Semite Muslim full of hatred!
@washingtonpost @RepRashida is plain spoken alright, vulgar &amp; racist!  I hope her constituents can see they've voted in a radical Anti-Semite just like Ilhan Omar and vote her out in 2020.  Michigan doesn't need to be tarnished by her!
@NBCNews Who in their right mind hands out cotton to children for a tour?  Candy maybe, but cotton?
@AOC We already knew that somebody else wrote your questions for the Cohen hearing, just like somebody else wrote your Green New Deal because you're not even smart enough! You're smarts are what come out of your mouth &amp; they are beyond nuts &amp; radical!
@dcexaminer @NYGovCuomo better get @AOC voted out of NY or she'll mess up anything that he hasn't already messed up!
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK Bernie's a loser; Hillary stole his day!  He looks like the mad scientist, not a presidential look &amp; he's too old &amp; way too radical!
@BillKristol @JoaquinCastrotx Ted Cruz is great, &amp; if Bill Kristol said this, you know it's a lie because Kristol is another Cohen, a pathological liar!  It's good to see that Kristol is watching GREAT TV, CPAC on CSPAN2.  Maybe some Americanism might rub off on him.  Great speech by VP Pence!
@BBCBreaking If this is true, I understand the Warmbier family's pain, but I think the President knows the value of the phrase, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer." He will not get N. Korea to give up nukes by being angry!
@MSNBC Great, another climate nut!	The Dems can't control blizzards, flooding, mudslides, forest fires, torrential rains, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, etc. in the U.S.	But they are going to control the climate all over the world!  	Stupid people!
@MSNBC LOL Powerful statement? From a person going to prison for lying and a mad fellow because he didn't get a White House job?  Fits right in with MSNBC's reporter's agenda!  FAKE NEWS!
@MSNBC MSNBC has the WORST website  of any I have ever seen!  I guess that's good because then you can't read/watch their FAKE NEWS!

@RezIndianFDL @realDonaldTrump That's only your opinion-worthless-because everybody has one! If there was a perfect President, I would follow him, but since there isn't, I choose President Trump because he is pro-LIFE, pro-Christian &amp; pro-Israel, all Christian principles. And your choice--killing babies? SICK!

It's hard to believe, but Bill Maher actually encouraged Adam Schiff to go on Fox News &amp; give his message. @AdamSchiff's face had a scared look on it &amp; he didn't quite know how to answer @billmaher. @seanhannity has offered him an hour! Schiff, show us what you're really made of!

@DarkTruthful Wow, I don't know what set you on fire, but you need to chill before you give yourself a stroke!  I'm not going to lower myself to your level &amp; call you names, but it does appear you have a chip on your shoulder based on your ramblings! Shalom!
@RezIndianFDL @MSNBC Radical Dems always do the following:  	1) You whine; are always the victim; "poor me!"	2) You're full of anger &amp; hatred so you call names, cuss &amp; are aggressive!	3) Nothing you spew is fact based; just your opinion!	4) Everything in the world is Trump's fault!

@VICKIKCIV @JoaquinCastrotx @SenatorCollins @SenThomTillis Because President Trump &amp; VP Pence are going to meetings to try to save our country &amp; Venezuela from total annihilation!  That's why!  If they don't, you won't be complaining about anything because you'll be dead!  Pretty simple!

@BernieSanders I can tolerate a liar a whole lot easier than a crazy man who wants to destroy my country &amp; freedoms by turning it into a radical socialist country, where the government owns me, tells me what to do &amp; say, &amp; takes away what I've worked all my life for to give it to some lazy bum!
@BernieSanders Bernard, you're still radical &amp; extreme &amp; you only WISH your ideas were supported by a majority of Americans, but they're not!  Your chances were much better in 2016, but now there are other women running that are better than Hillary!
@AOC YOU don't pay anything!  That's our taxpayer money you are spending!  If you're so concerned, then pay them extra out of your fat paycheck!  THEN you can brag about it!  This is not a "go-to attack"!  This is clarifying to you that again you talk a lot of nonsense!
@WashTimes Please, if Trump was going to kiss someone, it wouldn't be somebody that looks like her!  She's a wannabe Christine Ford looking for a GoFundMe handout or a Stormy Daniels payoff!  And don't waste your time sending me your radical Dem hate tweets because I'll just block you!

@TIME You all that don't like the President's celebration announcement should stay home so the rest of the people can have a great 4th!  A celebration without whiners, moaners, groaners &amp; haters would be awesome!  MAGA!

@dcexaminer @RepAdamSchiff @robwasinger Looks like @RepAdamSchiff was the one colluding with Russians in Colorado while loudly accusing Trump about a fake Russian-collusion witch hunt!

@314action @ShuttleCDRKelly No thanks!  We have enough gun-haters in Congress already!
@dcexaminer @ewarren You radical Dems are absolutely NOT for the working people. All the craziness that comes out of your mouths is proof enough!

@letclaybeclay @washingtonpost Just be glad your mother didn't believe in abortion or you wouldn't be here!
@washingtonpost Abortion &amp; killing newborn babies is not health care or reproductive rights!  It's MURDER!  Contraceptives are cheap &amp; often free, so women should USE THEM!  Or abstain until they get their heads straight!  "Thou shalt not kill" unless you want to send yourself to hell! Very sad!
@dcexaminer @JayInslee One more Dem whacko! Do none of  Dem hopefuls have any NEW IDEAS to run on? All running on climate change, global warming, socialism, Medicare for all, killing babies, $3 trillion tax plan, bail reform, $15/hr minimum wage, high taxes for wealthy, etc.!  Most are anti-American!

@MSNBC Only 1,100 times?  Are you sure?  The @nytimes should count again because I'm sure it's 2,020 times &amp; not nearly enough!  And where's some proof?  I would say no facts in 2-1/2 years equals desperation!    WITCH HUNT!  		TRUMP 2020!
@theblaze Poor ole @billmaher has extremely low self-esteem and a face only his mother could love, hence no wife! He lost his sense of humor as a comedian, so now his only way to get attention is to put others down &amp; get them riled up to make himself feel better! He's a typical bully! Sad!
@dcexaminer @NYGovCuomo @amazon How about you, Cuomo, &amp; @BilldeBlasio ensure that @AOC gets voted out of office and do not only NY, but the rest of the U.S. a BIG favor?
@BilldeBlasio How about you setting an example of a leader instead of a divider!
@CNN That dress is a loss!  Looks like she was trying to be a queen of somewhere!
@HuffPost "China representative chucked."  Huh?  He CHUCKED?  Are you sure?
@AOC You're toast in less than two years anyway! 		ONE-TERM ONLY!
@HarryBiron @Redphilly @KasieDC @MSNBC @kasie @KamalaHarris Are you speaking from a voice of experience or being funny?  How're they gonna transport anything to get to you?  No vehicles!  Horse maybe? No, they fart like cows!  Hmmmm, guess that's gonna be your problem!
@RepSwalwell I bet "Slawwell" is at the Oscars "slawbering" all over the other plastic people! The only one there that's probably not too plastic is poor old @robreiner, aka Meathead."
@Redphilly @KasieDC @MSNBC @kasie @KamalaHarris He could say plenty!  Self-centered for one!  You'll have plenty of names for her if she were to become president &amp; starts the Green New Deal &amp; you have to give up your car, electricity, refit your house, give up beef, etc.
@KasieDC @kasie @KamalaHarris Kamala is not important enough to Trump to be bothered with giving her a nickname!  She has to get up in the ranks with Bernie &amp; perhaps Biden first!
@Dav4Davis @DeepStateExpose If Obama was born in the U.S, then why did he have his birth record sealed in Hawaii? Why did he have his high school records sealed as well his college records at Occidental College, Columbia University &amp; Harvard Law School? What was he hiding?
@wadeharris1979 @WashTimes I don't know that to be a fact, Wad, but if it's true, that's even more disgusting!
@dcexaminer @AOC @AOC just thinks she's the boss!  She's just one "loud-mouthed" person in the House of 435!  And she's ignorant as well!  She ticked off the NY Governor &amp; the NYC Mayor over Amazon, &amp; they'll ensure she's just a one-termer of two years!
@DavidRutz @AOC just thinks she's the boss!  She's just one "loud-mouthed" person in the House of 435!  And she's ignorant as well!  She ticked off the NY Governor &amp; the NYC Mayor over Amazon, &amp; they'll ensure she's just a one-termer of two years!
@WashTimes Leave them on the bench for a few games &amp; they'll get over it! And if too many are benched so there's not enough left to make up a team, then they can just forfeit the game!  These players are just Kaepernick wannabees looking for attention!
@dcexaminer @KamalaHarris We don't need open borders for whoever to come on in &amp; destroy our country! Kamala is just looking for more illegal alien votes because everything she says &amp; does is self-centered! She could care less about Venezuelans! Be aware of the wolf she is!  	BUILD THAT WALL!  TRUMP 2020!
@CNN Isn't Pope Francis a hyprocrite? He's been aware of these pedophiles for a long time &amp; has done nothing about it, so isn't he also a "tool of Satan" for allowing these abuses of children to continue? And now all he can do is call these pedophiles names! They should be in prison!
@RussjfkV @CNN I would appreciate you providing some facts!  Or is this just your opinion?
@LisaKraft703 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Hmmmm!  Jesus was on earth a couple thousand years ago, yet you know how he posed??  Hmmmm!
@MSNBC @JoeNBC I'm no tyrant, but I do think you &amp; MSNBC are "enemies of the people" because you NEVER provide truthful, unbiased news! Instead all you people do is spin your own opinions based on the email you receive each morning giving you the required word for the day! Pathetic news!
@DaveyJo78130983 @WashTimes First of all, you bet I'm a follower of Jesus!  But your comment oozes with your radical Dem atheism, so drop the phoniness!  Use my bio part that says "advocate for the TRUTH," which Jesus taught, "Thou shalt not lie!"
@bdj183 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Sorry, Rachel Maddow: Sean Hannity is No. 1 in cable news again, making 2018 the SECOND YEAR in a row the face of Fox News Channel can make that claim.		LOL Finally in 2019, she has a couple of NIGHTS she beat Hannity! No wonder you don't know anything besides Maddow's FAKE NEWS!
@DaveyJo78130983 @WashTimes If you have further need to know some real news, try googling it and do your own research before bothering other people and showing your ignorance about what is going on in the real world around you!  Any more responses from you will be blocked!
@DaveyJo78130983 @WashTimes Again, if you spent ANY time reading/watching the news for the past several years, you would know about Mueller when he was FBI Director!  I'm not going to waste my time teaching you history, so try googling "Mueller scandals" and you''ll get 34M hits for your reading pleasure!
@DaveyJo78130983 @WashTimes For a hint on Muellar's scandals, try these: 		3 of Mueller's Scandals:	https://t.co/cADCHujBTc		Muellar Hand-Delivered U.S. Uranium To Russia at Airport Tarmac Scandal	https://t.co/9IRnRqcqms		More Mueller Scandals	https://t.co/i9aqUByf4F

@bdj183 @MSNBC @JohnBrennan First of all, your concern for others wanting to understand the teachings of Jesus oozes with your radical Dem atheism, so drop the phoniness! Hateful? Use my bio part that says "advocate for the TRUTH," which Jesus taught, "Thou shalt not lie!"
@bdj183 @MSNBC @JohnBrennan If you spent ANY time reading/watching the news for the past several years, you would already know about Brennan when he was CIA Director!  I'm not going to waste my time teaching you history, so try googling "Brennan lies" and you''ll get 12M hits for your reading pleasure!
@bdj183 @MSNBC @JohnBrennan Hint about Brennan: Lying about his illegal spying on Senate Intel Comm's computers &amp; having his lies uncovered by his own CIA's internal investigation; CIA scandal of illegally spying on emails of whistleblower officials; a scathing 6,000-page report on his CIA torture program!
@dcexaminer Thank goodness Rosenstein is leaving, the sooner the better!  I welcome an un-Rosenstein!
@dcexaminer Maybe Mueller himself didn't tip off CNN, but it's obvious one of his cohorts working on this witch hunt with him did! There's no way that CNN knew exactly the precise time to be at Stone's house at 6:00 a.m. with their lights on &amp; cameras rolling!  NO WAY!
@HuffPost I don't understand how Kellyanne puts up with this schmuck!  He seems like such a loser!  And for sure he must be a radical Democrat by the way he talks!
@AOC Be careful Cortez because after your 4-year stint, you might be the one shouting from the cheapest seats!
@WashTimes And Mueller should be right along side Manafort going to prison! He &amp; his cohorts are just as dirty &amp; crooked, if not more!  Some people have said Muellar is such an upstanding person!  Well, they said that about Comey too, until the truth started coming out!
@charliekirk11 What changed?  Their brains warped over Trump Derangement Syndrome!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog How many times are you going to tweet this?  Enough!  It's just FAKE NEWS anyway! Maddow is just looking for another drama to try to 'up' her sinking ratings!
@MSNBC I feel sad for these little children who will never have the chance to know the love of a mother! 	And don't bother sending me all your hateful tweets if you disagree because they will just be blocked!
@JudicialWatch This jerk who can't even follow the rules of the Senate he's a member of, wants to be the President?  What rules/laws would he decide as President that he wouldn't want to follow? We do NOT need a crazy radical like him leading our country!  Nor should he be in the Senate!

@BernieSanders Election Day does NOT need to be a holiday!  People can vote before &amp; after work, plus they can vote by mail.  That's sufficient Bernard!
@TeamCavuto Who cares what that idiot attorney thinks!  She can stay where she wanted to go &amp; daddy can go stay with her!
@HuffPost Has @AOC gone to the dogs?
@NYCMayor @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCHA @realDonaldTrump Like your constant ramblings aren't fooling people?  You're turning all of New York City into a mess with your high taxes &amp; high everything else, plus now you're a babykiller too, you twisted, warped,, sick man!
@dcexaminer This irks me to no end!  Cheap jerks using my tax money to go play in Africa on a pretend business trip!

@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings For heavens sakes Schiff, hold onto your britches before you lose them!  Everybody will want you to know what's in the report first before you lose your friggin' mind!  And so we don't have to see you on TV or every other tweet anymore!
@dcexaminer Be sure to tell this to @AOC because she's all hyped up over electric cars!
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Joey, don't you know 'silence is golden'?
@maddow Yes please!  Do the world a favor &amp; get her off the air!
@FoxNewsSunday If Cohen's hearing is public, it can be taped for the President. If it's not public, then no big deal. The meeting with Kim is way more important! As for the Mueller report, how many times have we heard it's coming out next week?  It will come out when Rosenstein leaves the DOJ.
@NBCNews Why don't you FAKE NEWS reporters tone down your FAKE NEWS?  You ARE enemies of the people when you can't just provide factual news without your radical opinions, which are a dime a dozen--basically worthless!
@jusxMia @davidwebbshow I think your story is UNBELIEVABLE!

@MSNBC @JoeNBC The story is not about the President, Joey! It's about the radical Dems &amp; how they get people crazed up with all the insane ideas you FAKE NEWS reporters &amp; Dems come up with! The President doesn't need to say anything when he can count on you to do all the talking, goofus!
@washingtonpost And who cares?  Geez isn't there any news you can report about?  Pathetic Washed out Post!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Sarah Sanders doesn't need to lie about anything!  The one lying would be Maddow because her ratings are goiing down, down, down!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog President Trump doesn't need to convince anybody!  People all over the world know the only countries that even vaguely liked, much less respected, Obama @BarackObama were Muslim countries looking for handouts like Iran got!  Maddow, you are really desperate for news! Try reality!
@RepAdamSchiff Schiff, you're losing your marbles with Trump Derangement Syndrome!  Your GOP colleagues aren't interested!  We're still waiting to see all this proof you have of Russian collusion!  Where's is it Schiff?
@KamalaHarris Don't feed us a line of bull about how wonderful California is!  High taxes, high housing prices, sanctuary city full of criminals/high crime, has most people living in tents, ravaging forest fires from untended forests, constant landslides in certain areas &amp; drought in others!
@dcexaminer Leave her where she's at so the taxpayers don't have to foot the bill for her prison time if she's found guilty of terrorism or treason!  She should stay where she chose to go!  Choices have consequences!  And if her father doesn't like it, then he can go join her there too!
@BernieSanders The minimum wage of $15/hour will more than likely eliminate high school kids &amp; even some college kids from getting part-time jobs.  The fast food places will want older more dependable workers for that kind of money.
@SpeakerPelosi @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Well that's a novel approach for the Dem members of Congress to decide to defend the Constitution all of a sudden!  The "swear" part is probably the only truth in Pelosi's tweet!
@LightningDuck @TIME That's only your ridiculous opinion!.  You've for sure never been to the border so you have no idea what you're even talking about!  So go post your opinion to the Washington Post FAKE NEWS!
@dcexaminer Al @alfranken is a creep!  And he has no business being in Congress!
@powertoimpeach LOL  Sounding pretty desperate!
@washingtonpost This is just another insane idea that even Obama was against when this was tried back in his day!  Give it up you idiotic Dems!
@MSNBC Oh for sure they want "to avoid further disruption on set." LOL This is a smart move on their part to protect their show!
@TIME What a waste of time!  It's not going anywhere!  Will the radical Dems EVER do anything worthwhile to help American citizens?  Unfortunately not!
@NBCNews @RichardEngel She can always fly to Mexico &amp; then come across the border!  The radical Dem Muslim anti-Semites will probably pay for her ticket!  Or maybe MSNBC reporters will!  Not much difference in how evil both are!!		BUILD THAT WALL!  NOW!
Medical devices provide life-saving solutions for millions. Congress must #RepealDeviceTax to protect patients and innovative care.
@getwhittet @HuffPost @JimCarrey All radical Dems do the following:  	1) They whine; are always the victim; "poor me!"	2) They're full of anger &amp; hatred so they call names, cuss &amp; are aggressive!	3) Nothing they spew is fact based; just their opinion!	4) Everything in the world is Trump's fault!	Pathetic people!
@washingtonpost @SteveKingIA King should NOT apologize!  The FAKE NEWS like the Washed 	out Post will attempt to destroy anyone they don't agree with!  But their reporters' days might be numbered if Bezos has to pay out big bucks to the Covington kid!
@AP That's about 50 years too late!   And these pedophiles should be turned over to law enforcement for prosecution!  They need to be in prison, not just banned from the Catholic church!

@PoliticalShort @SebGorka @RepAdamSchiff Poor pathetic Schiff is already borderline mentally ill from Trump Derangement Syndrome!  Lack of any Trump collusion will probably send him over the cliff!
@dcexaminer Another Trump accomplishment!  	TRUMP ROCKS!
@HuffPost The older @JimCarrey gets, the homlier!  Of course, he was never a dream boat, but he used to have a little sense of humor!  Now he's just a pathetic hateful &amp; ugly mess desperately trying to do or say anything to get back in the spotlight!  GIVE IT UP CARREY!  YOU'RE A BORE!
@JimCarrey LOL You can't even count to 9,000!  You're just a joker without the funny!
@JackPosobiec Absolutely as a deterrent for the next copycat looking for their 15 minutes of fame!
@dcexaminer Go @realDonaldTrump President Trump!  Keep up the great job for our U.S. economy in spite of the radical, idiotic Dems in Congress!  Drives them crazy that the economy is doing so well under your leadership,  But that's why the American people voted you into office &amp; in 2020 too!
@MSNBC @KatyTurNBC @samnunberg Nunberg is nothing more than a bag of sour grapes!  He was only an AIDE for a short time who was fired!  So he's only HOPING that Mueller will release this road map!  If Mueller had something worthwhile, it sure has taken a long dang time to find it!  FAKE!
@washingtonpost Just more of the Washed Post FAKE NEWS that is wrong on many levels.  They have no idea of the funds that are coming into the Treasury or going out, but they want us to think they know!  FAKE NUMBERS AS WELL AS FAKE NEWS!

@dscc How does 67,430 equal 67% of 207,000,000 (207 million) registered voters? They need 2 million just to get to 1%!  Somebody FLUNKED MATH in the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee!  LOL	MORE FAKE NEWS!
@WSJ @CharlesFLehman With the border secured as President Trump is trying to get done, in spite of the radical Dems, then Border Security could better spend their time controlling drugs coming in from Mexico!  Wouldn't it be a shocker if the radical Dems could help instead of hinder this effort?!
@MSNBC It would be a shocker to have these same House Democrats vote on something worthwhile that would help the American citizens, instead of a worthless piece of legislation that will do nothing!  Have they nothing else to do besides a Mueller-type witch hunt? Desperate people!
@WSJ This article failed to state that Judge Jackson &amp; Mueller are very close friends, so she is just an extension of the Mueller witch hunt.  Mueller wants the gag order so Stone can't say anything that might mess up his witch hunt!
@JohnPMasters All radical Dems do the following:  	1) They whine &amp; are always the victim; "poor me!"	2) They're full of anger &amp; hatred so they call names: rascist; homophobe! 	3) Nothing they spew is fact based; just their opinion!	4) Everything in the world is Trump's faut!	Pathetic people!
@JohnPMasters At least my "crazy" is certifiable!  And yours?  LOL  Next time when a person asks another person about their tweet, try not buttng in!  That way others can avoid your nonsense!  Please, please be done &amp; go along on your way!  Thanks!
@dcexaminer "Bernie Sanders' real significance isn't progressive policy; it's empowerment for the alienated."  Does the "alienated" include illegal aliens?
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Maddow, your dramas get bigger by the day, but there's never anything to them! They just fizzle &amp; die like your show is doing!  Maybe you should team up with @AdamSchiff because he comes up with big dramas too &amp; then nothing!
@JohnPMasters Glad you finally got something!  Hypocrite? Not at all &amp; so glad you're not my judge!  😌😌 I proudly wear the title "whackadoo" since it bothers you so much!  LOL Maybe there's hope for you yet!  My Bible says: "The truth will set you free!"  Try reading it sometime! Shalom!

@julesman @ABC Maybe because both are nice looking!
@dcexaminer @QuinHillyer WOW, a real reporter, Lara Logan, that nailed it!  Kudos to Lara Logan, Quin, author of this article &amp; the Washington Examiner!  @CBS should give Lara a huge raise for daring to tell the truth!
@nytimes You reporters are such phonies!  All you can put out on President Trump is FAKE NEWS!  Re-examination? Or just RE-PEAT of the same old made up balogney!
@WSJ And to the opinion writer, you've been to the border so you understand that it is a crisis, right?  I would guess not!
@WSJ This is probably FAKE NEWS, but if it's true, it's very disturbing that they don't have a problem with killing precious newborn babies-infanticide!
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends LOL Poor old Maxine is getting rather senile &amp; pitiful!  And she's so old now, she hasn't been able to get to the border to find out the truth!  Her sources are the FAKE news &amp; @AdamSchiff.
@HuffPost And who is @Trevornoah .......?  Somebody important or just another clown?
@washingtonpost The Washed Post is Fact Checking anyone? LOL  WP, start at home first for a novel approach!
@marklevinshow @Judgenap Napolitano has been proven wrong many times in his opinions on Fox News regarding President Trump! I'm glad they're just his opinions &amp; nothing more!
@MjubeeB @dscc Your comments are not based on facts, but everyone has an opinion such as yours!
@3kv @dscc You've been to the border &amp; know for a fact that all walls, where needed, are all in place?  Right?  Or are you relying on fake news?
@Tomme1 @stevematic @dscc I would put it somewhere at about 30%.
@JohnPMasters @BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews I don't remember asking you this question, so I'll wait to hear from the person I asked! Since the people running for office are all dirty, like it or not--all Dems endorse killing babies--I guess you'll have to pick the least dirty one!  I will pick pro-life, like your mom did!
@JohnPMasters God will be Trump's judge on the other things, as only God knows his heart, not you nor me!  ALL are born in sin, and since all sins are equal in God's eyes, we are only saved by grace through Jesus Christ! So since you were born in sin, you will be judged the same!
@JohnPMasters Baldwin needs no judging; his hatred of others forever are proven facts! If I could pick a perfect president, I would, but since there are none, I chose President Trump because he is pro-Christian, pro-life &amp; pro-Israel in line with Jesus' teachings!

@BernieSanders How can you say "we can generate massive job creation?" Are you forgetting the massive job "destruction" that will be caused from all those employed in the fossil fuel industries + loss of assets? Plus massive costs &amp; time to retrain everyone? This is all a farce in my opinion!
@BettyBowers @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Explain what the President's high crimes &amp; misdemeanors are based on some facts, please, not your opinion!
@joshuacrime @washingtonpost Well DUH!  Good!
@KamalaHarris Kamala's afraid of not getting enough votes to secure her as the Dem. candidate, but if the border remains open long enough to get thousands more illegal aliens in &amp; registered as Dems to vote, she might have a shot! She only does or says things that are always self-serving!
@GlazierBrian @MSNBC Good, then go away!
@TheTrulyMad @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Read your comments &amp; tell me you aren't personally attacking the President, but you're going to preach to me?  "Do as I say, not as I do!" You wanted to play games, so I played too &amp; then you got all grumpy!  I certainly don't need pity from you; save it for yourself! THE END!
@POTUS_15 Pssst...They didn't pass the wall funding because it wasn't a crisis at the time because there weren't caravans of thousands of people trying to come in from other countries!
@GlazierBrian @MSNBC My such anger! Why do radical Dems always resort to name calling? Perhaps it's because anger keeps one from thinking calmly &amp; rationally. Were you like that on your last job? I hope not because that could be the reason for such police hatred! It's bad for your health! Shalom!
@Deirdriu @Just_Grace89 @NY1noticias @AOC I appreciate all my rights, but what I DON'T appreciate is people like you that keep bothering other people! You've acted stupid, you've had your say, now just go away or blocking you will be next!  Go find yourself again!
@dcexaminer I wonder why Biden didn't tell them that he wanted to take the President behind the gym to TRY to whip him! That would have shown the world how senile Joe is getting &amp; regressing back to his childhood days!  That's embarrassing, although Joe doesn't realize it!
@washingtonpost The President's declaration is NOT unconstitutional or else other presidents' would have been unconstitutional too!  It's nothing more than Trump hate! What should be unconstitutional is rags like the Washed Post FAKE NEWS! If you can't post truthful news then you should be gone!
@POTUS_15 @washingtonpost He understands radical Dem. hate well; we all do! It's not checks &amp; balances or the process would have been the same for all Presidents! He spelled out exactly what would happen &amp; it's progressing just as he said!  It's called "Hate for Trump" because he doesn't bow down to them!
@TheJuanWilliams What the world really needs is for Fox to give you a desk job with no internet access! Your opinions are 99% ridiculous &amp; you always carry this chip on your shoulder about every possible subject----borderline racist &amp; division!
@GeraldoRivera And BTW Geraldo, you're not exactly one that promotes good relations between people!  I've watched you on Fox where others are having a sensible conversation, &amp; you enter the conversation like a raging bull!  Way stronger than passion, but bordering on hate! VERY irritating!
@GeraldoRivera If it's not the hat, the hateful left will find something else they don't like! That's how we lose our freedom! We have to stand up against the small things, to keep from having to resist the larger ones!  Bullies tend to back down when they meet another bully! STAND STRONG!
@joshuacrime @washingtonpost You say America has no LEFT, but your bio says you are a "LEFT libertarian."  Both can't be right!  lol
@BernieSanders Oh boy, another radical, socialist, hate-spewing Democrat! Bernie boy, you haven't a chance! The girls will wipe you out!  Don't you Dems get it?  The more radical you get, the better Trump's chances! Where is a middle of the road candidate that's not crazy? Do they even exist?
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog MADDOW STRIKES AGAIN!  Stupid comedy shows are nothing but a blip  on President Trump's mind!  Stop your NONSENSE &amp; try some news before you get your pink slip!  You are slipping badly &amp; dreadfully boring!
@dcexaminer @BilldeBlasio can only blame himself, the screwed up @AOC, &amp; @NYGovCuomo . It's all the radical Dem crooked &amp; evil politicians that are to blame--no one else!  Keep up with high taxes, insane ideas &amp; people will continue to flee your oppression, including visitors!
@washingtonpost Typical news from the Washed Out Post to try to divide people.  That's why you are worse than the National Enquirer!  At least the Enquirer can be entertaining, but this?  For absolutely nothing other than to divide!  The only good thing is that most won't even read it!
@CantTeachTrump @washingtonpost You teacher(s) have been to the border, right? So you know first hand what you're posting about based on facts, right? I'm guessing not! You teacher(s) don't just teach things you heard; don't you teach FACTS to others? Walk in our shoes, then you can preach to others with facts!
@Just_Grace89 @Deirdriu @NY1noticias @AOC Grace, I apologized to you &amp; then Gaeilgeoir (the green ERA) responded to us &amp; I responded back to Gaeilgeoir about finally speaking English. Since then you've been responding to Gaeilgeoir, not me, &amp; I've said nothing. We've both wasted enough time on Gaeilgeoir. Blessings to U!
@NicolleDWallace The GOP in the Senate are UNITED except for a couple of whiners like Romney! In the House, not too bad! This is just Wallace's attempt to divide! What's interesting is Wallace used to work for the Bushes &amp; McCain &amp; then switched sides to the Dem MSNBC! Her opinion is worth ZERO!
@CBSNews Rosenstein is just as guilty of lying &amp; fraud as McCabe &amp; Comey!  I hope the new AG gets to the bottom of this whole mess, or....is he just another Mueller bud?  Time will tell!
@washingtonpost That is so special--true love!  So glad to see the Pence family have something special to celebrate in their lives after all the hate they have to endure! Congratulations to the couple &amp; may they have a blessed life!!  	I just hope it's not FAKE NEWS from the Washed Post!
@MSNBC The President had to go somewhere after declaring the emergency to sit and watch the Democrat zoo begin to be sure his predictions were right!  He was spot on with all of the hullabaloo!  What better place to watch then while relaxing on the golf course after a nice omelet!
@KamalaHarris How about the thousands that are dying from drug overdoses &amp; deaths caused by illegal aliens? What are you doing about that? Keep the borders open so you can get some more illegal alien votes over truly caring that American citizens are safe? We don't need a self-serving Prez!
@Deirdriu @Just_Grace89 @NY1noticias @AOC Well, I'll be darned, you do know English! If you didn't like my response, then don't be tweeting to me in some foreign language trying to prove what? If you want to be in an Engish conversation, then try responding in English! You might a get more respectful reply! Caio! Shalom!
@TheTrulyMad @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Which FAKE NEWS did you get all your info from? I know, I'll bet you were there! Naw, because your bio says you're "truly mad" &amp; play Ninja all day!  And you're how old? 35 living in Mama's basement! Sorry, but I don't play with boys!  I prefer MEN! Run along now, Mama's calling!
I'll bet if you were investigated like the President has been, we would find out you're not "Bishop Perfect!" Jesus said, "Judge not lest you be judged!" Better get off Twitter &amp; start reading your Bible &amp; praying! You've lost your purpose in life!  It's to spread love, not hate!
@TalbertSwan @DZarrella12 @realDonaldTrump We idiots (in your screwed up mind) don't spend our day spewing hatred like you &amp; then call ourselves "bishops!" Bishop of what?  Better get a new job &amp; quit scamming people because one day you will give an account to God! I would hate to see you miss heaven because you hate!
@TheTrulyMad @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Pence was only in Germany where they are so messed up they don't know if they are coming or going!
@jujo28 @JRubinBlogger Uh, why are you bothering me if we have nothing to talk about! Buzz on along with your hate, killing babies, open borders so illegals can come in and kill you or your family, socialism! I prefer life, liberty &amp; the pursuit  of happiness &amp; if that's Trump disease I embrace it!
@JRubinBlogger UP:  President Trumps's ratings!		DOWN:  Congress' ratings!		UP:  Sean Hanity's ratings on Fox News!		DOWN:  Maddow's ratings on MSNBC!		UP:  The Wall		DOWN:  Law suits to stop the wall!
@JCmrytylermoore @Alyssa_Milano BUILD THE WALL!
To @AlecBaldwin:  Get over yourself!  You're a hateful has-been that needs to go into hiding far away! Your spoofs of the President are very boring! On the other hand, your brother, Stephen, is pretty decent! https://t.co/rqQyeayBBZ
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Oh geez!  I thought that old geezer @AlecBaldwin had gone into hiding!  Spare us any more Trump parodys of Trump because you leave a lot to be desired!  How come you're so darned hateful &amp; your brother Stephen is so nice?
@thecjpearson CJ, you have more smarts than the majority of people in Congress!  Keep on speaking the truth &amp; thank you.
@HanoyShan @MSNBC Donny:  How about this for some starters?		https://t.co/hNtR8Oi1Tw
@ExpertHRConsult @MSNBC @KamalaHarris Your "expert" might not be working too good!  lol
@MSNBC @KamalaHarris needs to raise more funds so she can pay MSNBC to keep putting out FAKE NEWS that her popularity is soaring!
@beanbart2 @ABC @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov I love Fox News and watch it everyday!  No fight, just calling you out on blaming everything on Trump when you're factually wrong!  You run along as well and keep it honest!  Shalom!
@drantbradley You sound like a whiner, not a doer!  If you want a black president, what's stopping you from starting your own seminary or college?
@livinginthegar1 @WSJ And you've been to the border, right?  And you know what you're talking about based on facts &amp; not just your opinion, right!  Because opinions are a dime a dozen -- basically worthless!!
@MarkYoungTruth @RepAdamSchiff You can't share anything when you have nothing!  One thing he does have is Trump Derangement Syndrome &amp; he's heading for a mental breakdown!  Pathetic narcissist!
@HuffPost @nytimes Sounds like he needs a reality check!  Lock him up!
@TheJuanWilliams Oh Juan, you &amp; your nutty radical Dem ideas on the Five!  I love when @JesseBWatters &amp; @greggutfeld put you in your place!  That's entertainment!
@KazmerDiedre @MSNBC Whew, glad to hear that you're not a rectum doc!  I happen to like our President, so we'll just agree to disagree!  TRUMP ROCKS!
@beanbart2 @ABC @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov That was my intention for insulting me, my President &amp; ICE! I don't take it lightly when people lie because they can't read &amp; just automatically start criticizing &amp; insulting others! So PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH! Chill out about racism because that's OLD! I don't follow FAKE NEWS!
@TimRyan You need to stop being a DRAG on the Republican party or else re-register as a radical Dem!  This country is STRONG against killing babies, especially after they are born!  You need a reality check!  And give up your consideration of running against Trump!  He would tromp you!
Sorry Dixon!  I don't do messages!  Twitter said it was bad so DELETED!
@JoeBunnies @beanbart2 @ABC @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov Are you the Antichrist?  He's the only one that THINKS he knows what Jesus thinks!  Otherwise, you're just a mixed up bunny rabbit who thinks he knows what Jesus thinks! (apologies to bunny rabbits).  You made me smile though because it takes all kinds...….!  Shalom!
@jackhowell55 @MSNBC Your bio couldn't have said it better!  Shalom Reverend!
@KazmerDiedre @MSNBC Wow, you must be a rectum doctor to have such wisdom!
@mikebanuelos08 @MSNBC Protecting Americans is NOT A SCAM, Miguel!
@OurRepublic12 @Elvis88697556 @MSNBC WRONG Mark Twain wannabe!  The more radical Dems open their mouth, the more President Trump's ratings go up, up, up!  TRUMP 2020 + 4!  Get your facts straight!
@calleditenough @HEIR2HERE @MSNBC There won't be any more cows to jump over the moon!  @AOC's Green New Deal eliminates all cows because their farts cause climate change!  LOL
@0JqTnGuAbz9xZQk @MSNBC LOL If the Prez bothers you so bad, why do you watch him?  Do you not have an OFF button?  You're held hostage?  How's that?  Or do you just want to whine!  Go get a life so you can feel better!  Shalom!
@gauchiste8 @MSNBC I totally agree with you.  The Prez is awesome &amp; a great piece of work too!
@Gracielyn7 @MSNBC I hate our incidious debt that Obama doubled &amp; spent more than all the other Presidents combined!  That debt?  You bet I'm ticked and glad he's gone!  Hope that makes you feel better &amp; NO need to respond -- just have a great day!
@MSNBC LOL MSNBC needs to fact check itself, but even that wouldn't clean up their FAKE NEWS!
@sentlmentl @MSNBC Pretty simple!  Move to another country!
@forever_train @JoeBiden I wonder why Biden didn't tell them he wants to take the President behind the gym and TRY to whip him? He's nothing but a big buffoon! BUT, the more these idiot Dems open their mouth, the more Trump's ratings go up!  I hope Biden is the Dem candidate because Trump will tromp him!
Awesome! https://t.co/Zq3g6VuEgV
@washingtonpost LOL Media  reports?  You mean Washed Post FAKE NEWS?  LOL  I hope he did nominate Trump because he deserves it after putting up with all your FAKE NEWS about him!
@Just_Grace89 @Deirdriu @NY1noticias @AOC Sorry Grace, but I had some idiot tweeting me pretending to be in some foreign language (above in green), but probably an offended illegal alien or relative because of our prior comments, so I said in Spanish, "Shut up idiot" to whoever!  I agree that our language is English!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Whitaker absolutely did not give contradictory testimony!  We know this because the source of this is coming from FAKE NEWS!  Whitaker was awesome and we all know it!
@washingtonpost We don't need to know anymore than we already do about @KamalaHarris She's a pot-smoking, mixed up on her music, can't sing, can;t dance, likes to shop person who dated the OLD, MARRIED ex-mayor of San Fran for years to get 2 good-paying jobs, &amp;, then got herself a white boy!
@MSNBC @maddow Nobody is numbed by the President!  HOWEVER, Maddow has had a numb brain for years with major sagging ratings!
@NBCNews I highly doubt the White House requested this, but hey, FAKE NEWS has to do say somEthing to spice up their FAKE NEWS!
@PattyMurray @PollyThomsonStr You're wrong Ms Patty!  The wall is an emergency, but you wouldn't know because you've never even been to the border!  Keep up the radical Dem idiotic ideas because Trump's favorability keeps going up!  You radical Dems are whacked out!
@fcurrocary President TRUMP looks like a President, talks like a President, walks like a President, &amp; is the greatest President ever, &amp; did I mention he'll be President for 6 SIX more years?  Better get some stress meds!
@AGBecerra @PollyThomsonStr @MarthaRaddatz @realDonaldTrump Pretty swell that idiotic California &amp; El Paso, TX file suits to block building the wall when they are the places that HAVE A WALL already built there!   		GO TRUMP!  BUILD THAT WALL!  Start in Arizona!
@SenGillibrand @PollyThomsonStr @CoryBooker plays Spartucus; @KamalaHarris goes shopping: @AOC tries to dance; @IlhanMN pretends to love Jews; @RepAdamSchiff has bad PMS; &amp; you show us how to cook!  Geez, what a show you idiots put on!  You all have ADD!  President?  Ha!  Go hug your pillow!
@FaceTheNation @ChrisCoons @margbrennan This Coonhead is the type of person that makes me give pause!  You're about as UnAmerican as McCabe, Comey, Rosenstein and the whole shebang!  Another part of the swamp!  Disgusting &amp; despicable!  RT this!!!!
@ChrisCoons Bypass Congress?  Don't blame the President for your stupid refusal to fund the wall!  He's doing what you &amp; your radical Dems should have done to protect the American people!  But what do you care?  You're talking smack when you haven't even been to the border! So shut up!
@free_2017_dom @forever_train You are absolutely right on JH. I've been tweeting the same thing about @IlhanMN pretending to not know she was being anti-semetic!  Keep up with the truth!  These Muslim haters have no place in our Congress or our country!
And old @SenSanders wants to add even more people on Social Security, the idiot! https://t.co/UJ9181zsNA
@NBCNews So what! If people chose not to vote, oh well; that's the voter's perogative!  But who knows if this isn't just more FAKE NEWS!
@dcexaminer I was hoping Whitaker would become the Deputy Attorney General because he was so awesome &amp; totally in command at the hearings!  I look forward to Rosenstein being GONE! He should have been fired before McCabe!
@realDonaldTrump To all @AngelFamilies.  My sincerest apology for all of your losses that should not have happened if the radical Dems woud have helped by closing our borders to illegal aliens!  Thank you for sharing your such sad stories &amp; for our President for allowing you to be heard!
@TIME Does anyone care what Germany thinks of our President who wants them to start paying up all the bucks they owe the U.S.  The same Germany that was responsible for the Holocaust?
@CBSNews To @LindseyGrahamSC Keep working to uncover the truth and I think you will find that Rosenstein is as big a liar as McCabe &amp; Comey!
@DiamondandSilk If you were filing your nails imitating @ananavarro, you're a whole lot classier!  Cute!  And you girls have some good moves going on!
@BreitbartNews To @AnnCoulter:  The President is an idiot?  Look in the mirror for a real idiot!  You're showing your ignorance more everyday!  Get off Twitter for awhile and go get a life or write another book or something--anything!  Just go away!
@MrAndyNgo @CoryBooker Cory Booker is one of the biggest racists there is--always Spartucus stupid trying to divide people and tell us what we need to do! He needs to go away.  He would embarrass us to the max as President!  No way!
@dcexaminer Poor @RepAdamSchiff! I believe he has become mentally unblanced because he has Trump Derangement Syndrome so bad! How many times has he come out on TV making a big announcement that HE has proof of collusion, but shows no proof of anything? He's so desperate, he's now delusional!
@Mzchawk1 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog I happen to love Koolaide &amp; I wish Trump made it!  I really think Trump's numbers are doing rather well, and the more your radicals Dems open their mouths about socialism, killing babies,  going Green insanity, the better!  Better get your depression meds before 2020!
@beanbart2 @ABC @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov Hello beanfart!  It was Border Patrol not President Trump or ICE!  Get some new glasses so you can read your FAKE NEWS better!  You're the one being whitewashed &amp; brainwashed!
@NBCNews Wonderful idea @SenTedCruz!  But getiing the radical Dems to go along is gonna be tough for any idea that makes sense!  Good luck!
@BreitbartNews @SebGorka The elite FAKE NEWS media!  Is anyone surprised?  They sure are quiet now, if only these FAKE NEWS reporters would be quiet ALL the time!  Especially @donlemon; he's the little sugar daddy FAKE of them all!  Pathetic &amp; disgusting!
@60Minutes @CBSNews McCabe hasn't sued the government yet because he knows he's a loser, who should have been fired long before &amp; should already be in prison! His lover, Lisa Page, Comey &amp; Rosenstein should be in prison with him!
@dcexaminer How could the FISA court not be mislead with a phony dossier? Pretty dimwit judge not doing his job or just another part of the swamp!  Probably a buddy of McCabe or Comey!  And why is he a FORMER JUDGE now?  Probably wanted to ensure his gov. pension in case he gets exposed!
@60Minutes @CBSNews McCabe is a proven liar, but when he says Rosenstein was the originator of removing Trump, I believe him! Rosenstein told Trump to fire Comey so he could hire Mueller to go after Trump on FAKE charges to keep himself from being exposed as being at the bottom of this whole mess!
@dcexaminer Why are all the plastic people of Hellywood &amp; the radical Dems like @SenKamalaHarris &amp; @SenBooker so quiet now?  They were all a bunch of big mouths forever about this!  Smollett is just another fake like the rest of the fakes!
@CNN @StCollinson Just more FAKE NEWS in an attempt for people to believe the GOP is all divided!  Whoever SAINT COLLINSON is, get a life and cut the phony BS!
@KimKardashian She just gets slutier looking everyday, but her children are darling, the poor kids with a mother that dresses like that!  Kim needs to go to  class for self-esteem &amp; give up the selfies!
@HuffPost Oh yeah?  John Oliver is just another big mouth that doen't know what he's talking about because he's never been to the border!  Just another HOT AIR Trump hater like the rest of the peeps!
@azcentral @gregstantonaz is just another radical AZ Democrat just like @RepRaulGrijalva! Both full of themselves who do zero for AZ! Building the border wall is not going to interfere with Luke's construction! He's just another Trump hater from AZ who has never been to the border!
@dcexaminer @IlhanMN was raised to be a Jew hater - actually Muslims are all taught from childhood to hate anyone who is not Muslim!  So she's only lying about not being anti-Semitic!  She's a snake &amp; has no place in our country much less in congress!
@TIME No, we don't need to watch a series on the Bobbitts!  With all the weirdos in the world today, you'll have them trying a repeat of that drama to get a little tv time! And I doubt anyone cares what Lorena thinks about anything else!  She's a has-been from way back &amp; a nut to boot!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Maddow, get yourself together!  There are reporters and then there is you!  Try reporting news sometime.  It might help your desperately poor rating!  I hope you improve so you don't get a pink slip!
@MrAndyNgo Absolutely excellent reporting on all these incidents!  You should RT this often to keep exposing these hateful people!  Keep up the great work!
@DebraEl25562451 @NBCNews I DON''T USE UGLY PICTURES!  TIME TO BLOCK PEOPLE WHO TALK SMACK!
@DebraEl25562451 @NBCNews No actually I was looking at yYOUR bio - fluid head!  Bye, bye!
@CRA1G @NBCNews Whatever a "poe" tweet means?  Sorry, I only understand English!
@DebraEl25562451 @NBCNews You wish you could dismiss me? Dream on! LOL Buzz off fluid head!
@EdKrassen @PasteIpunk Eddie, at least we are getting something for our tax money this time, unlike all the waste for salaries for the idiotic Dems in DC!  President Trump is NOT running Ponzi schemes &amp; ripping people off!  Sound familiar?  GO TRUMP &amp; build that wall!
@dcexaminer @marcorubio To @DiamondandSilk:  Love watching you gals!  Rubio is the mother hen of the Senate overseeing everything. It might set a new precedence? He's a little late on that one!  Obama sent billions of dollars to Iran with no approval &amp; used exec. orders!  Go Trump!  BUILDTHEWALL!
@washingtonpost Who's Dan Mallory...…..?  The Washed Post is calling someone a liar?  LOL  That's the pot calling the kettle black!  When's the last time the Washed Post put out anything besides FAKE NEWS?  So I guess the answer is nobody cares about either of you!
@dcexaminer @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Ann, you used to talk with some decent common sense, but anymore you're becoming a RADICAL IDIOTIC KOOK!  Stop with your nonsense tweets because you're wasting your time!
@NBCNews This poor 11-year-old kid is nothing more than a product of his hateful home environment!  He should be removed from that home before he is scarred for life!
@chazborn Yeah, and you've been to the border how many times?  ZERO!  And I suppose all the "angel moms/dads" are lying and that none of their kids are really dead?  GET REAL!  There is a border crisis IF you knew the facts &amp; weren't getting your info from the FAKE NEWS!
@chazborn Get on board the TRUMP TRAIN!  Whooohooooo!  Sorry Chucky, it's chugging on full charge!  Don't get left behind!
@RepMarkMeadows @Wild_Bill_STL Mark, everybody worldwide knows by now that @RepAdamSchiff is nothing but a liar!  How many times has he come out and announced that he has all this proof of Russian collusion!  He has nothing; just wants to be on TV! He should get a medal for the biggest lying phony in history!
@NBCNews Why do people continue to talk about this schmuck?  He should be stripped of everything!  Then he should take his payoff money and disappear!  He's done enough damage to football &amp; our country!  He was about money the whole time!  A total fraud!
@realDonaldTrump Go President Trump!  Best President ever in spite of your hateful radical Democrat House, some of the wimpy or grumpy (Romney) GOP Senate, the FAKE NEWS &amp; Hollywood plastic people!  And if "FAKE NEWS" offends someone, either clean up your news or get over it! Charge ahead Trump!
@windycitysoljah @HuffPost I'm loving it!  😀😀😀	TRUMP ROCKS!  	TRUMP 2020!
@J_WilliamsAZ @WillieBoy2222 @mfusk @CNN Lol looks to me like you're the fake.
@DineshDSouza @SpeakerPelosi Nancy, it's just "IMMORAL!"  Way more "IMMORAL" than a wall!
@dcexaminer Muslims are raised to hate Jews &amp; Christians! She's made remarks before, but I don't think she expected to be called out so strongly. She said her DC phone was ringing off the hook with threats! Pelosi made her apologize. She's a female Muslim wolf in sheep's clothing!
@Deirdriu @Just_Grace89 @NY1noticias @AOC idiota cerrado
@Just_Grace89 @NY1noticias @AOC Those tweeting in Spanish might be illegal aliens who haven't learned to speak English yet!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump's base will swell with the Dems new face of Socialism; the Green New Deal of no cars, no electricity, gas, nuclear or coal,--just solar except when cloudy or in winter, no cows so no beef; new law to kill babies after they are born; no borders so all terrorists welcome!
@LadyAsh15507568 I've had enough of this silly conversation!  No more responses expected or wanted.  I don't want to block you, but I will!  Blessings to you and may God open your eyes to the truth so you won't be led astray by another Jesse-type!
@LadyAsh15507568 Oh like it was all the woman's fault! What's all this good that you've actually seen Jesse do--not read about? And what good have you done?  I know I don't use the title of Reverend and go pick up married men &amp; have their kids and then show up in church all pure &amp; holy!
RT @LadyAsh15507568: @MaryBarton08 Oh, I no his background. Been going the push  for almost 50. Why the hell did she f around with a Marry…
@DarrellSr9 @washingtonpost @SpeakerPelosi You moron!  I said--&gt;"WHILE SHE SITS BEHIND HER WALLS WITH SECURITY GUARDS LOADED WITH GUNS!" Where did I say "HER HOUSE"?????? Click on the link below and maybe this can help you understand! Since you can't read, just  look at the pictures!  		https://t.co/kxNAqwxhY5
@DarrellSr9 @washingtonpost @SpeakerPelosi You're too funny!  Please point out where I said Nancy Pelosi's house in San Francisco???  You &amp; your eyes really need to take a break because your eyes are deceiving you &amp; you're getting worked up over nonsense! I'm done!  Blessings to you!
@Sean_K_Davis @dcexaminer I believe she knew exactly what she was saying! She's said anti-semetic remarks before!  She just wasn't expecting to be called out about it, and in her own words her DC phone was ringing off the hook with threats!  She's a female Muslim wolf in sheep's clothing!
@Belladora45 @washingtonpost If you're asking me, I wouldn't know a thing about religious cults?  Maybe you could better answer that one since you know what God thinks!  You really need to go take a break and chill. You're getting yourself too worked up &amp; it's not good for you!  Blessings to you!  Shalom!
@chuckbrown0916 @washingtonpost Smart answer! HUH?   LOL
@DarrellSr9 @washingtonpost What does Repubs have to do with anything?  And for your info, Newsom of Calif. is not a Rep.! They're as simple-minded as @SpeakerPelosi wanting guns banned &amp; no walls while she sits behind her walls with security guards loaded with guns!
@OversightDems @RepCummings Pitiful ole Elijah Cummings has been feeling kinda neglected, so he's trying to get in the spotlight as the new chairman of the oversight committee! He's got himself a new job now &amp; he's gonna show the world he's got some new smarts cuz he's on a new fishin' expedition! #HOGWASH!
@washingtonpost Isn't it interesting that El Paso, Texas &amp; California are the two places that have walls, yet they are the ones filing lawsuits!  How phony are those leaders?
@Belladora45 @washingtonpost Since you seem to know God's mind, ponder this:  "And he (God) changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings;" Daniel 2:21 I For a clearer understanding, I challenge you to read this excellent article at the link provided.	https://t.co/nu9nsC9q97
@Belladora45 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I have no idea where you got side-tracked with cages, abortions, adoptions, etc. My reply was about a 4-time repeat offender illegal alien who killed a newborn baby in a car wreck! Dems are pushing gun restrictions to save school kids, but not this killing by closing the border!
@mcford77 @007darB @MSNBC @AliVelshi I'll call your bluff!
@ledailytweet @MSNBC @AliVelshi It's where your MSNBC reported it, in case it flashed by you!
@dcexaminer Of course Mueller got a gag order granted by his buddy, Judge Jackson, so Stone won't say anything to mess up his witch hunt!
@FoersterRobert @Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump Wow, you are really smart, Mr. President wannabe!  LOL
@dcexaminer Erin, author of this article, perhaps you should visit the border before you write things you know nothing about! The President isn't gutting the Constitution at all by his executive order. He's protecting foolish Americans like you! The ones who hate this order are Trump haters!
@Girl2Ky @JoaquinCastrotx @NBCNews @Israel @IsraeliPM Did it not occur to you that this is a fake pic?  Boy laying on a bed with no blood on his face; next pic--same boy on same bed, but now face &amp; sheets covered with blood!  It's done by Photo Editor by someone trying to get sympathy from gullible people!  Don't fall for fake news!
@Girl2Ky @JoaquinCastrotx @NBCNews Wow, such anger!  And you keep tweeting about things that aren't even connected! Did you ever consider this?  "Cancer is caused by the suppression of toxic emotions; primarily anger, hate, resentment and grief."  Perhaps you should get help for your anger and you might heal!
@chuckbrown0916 @washingtonpost I didn't claim anything!  You were the one claiming what's on Fox News &amp; yet you admit you haven't watched Fox News in 10 years!  So obviously you don't know what you're talking about and I called you out on it!  Stick with what you do know &amp; don't make things up!
@Girl2Ky @JoaquinCastrotx @NBCNews Girl, this is the best you can do? A meme? LOL
@LadyAsh15507568 I'm going to call out anyone who is a hypocrite, who calls other people immoral when they themselves are the immoral ones!  Maybe you don't know his background and think of him as wonderful, but I do know his background and the girl he fathered with another woman, while married!
@chuckbrown0916 @washingtonpost Then explain how you know what's on Fox News every night, per your words!  Or was that just your bs talk, when you really have no clue?
@SueBee1410 @washingtonpost Tucker Carlson's program must be good enough for you to be a follower!  LMAO
@chuckbrown0916 @washingtonpost It's pretty funny that you dislike both Alan Dersowitz &amp; Fox News, but you keep watching them every night!
@ImikSabi @washingtonpost You are definitely lost in your own mind!  LMAO
@Mjaysmama @washingtonpost I'll be darned!  I bet nobody knew that but you!  Such intelligence!
@paris_livin @washingtonpost Stay in France - FOREVER!
@Belladora45 @washingtonpost And you're just plain TWISTED!
@RSCGOP @BetoORourke You go big tough-talking man!  We'll all sit and watch while you move a few shovels full of dirt &amp; pass out!  But I believe you really want open borders and will use illegal aliens to take the wall down for you!  	#BUILDTHATWALL!
@AC360 @andersoncooper It's called making America safe--not your gibberish! Border-state people don't work or live in high rise ofiices or homes in New York City.  We live in the real world of drugs pouring in, terrorists sneaking in &amp; illegal aliens forcing their way in where there are no walls!
@JoyceWhiteVance And your point is what?  	My point is -- NOTHING ON THE PRESIDENT!  😁😁	#WITCHHUNT
@CNNTonight @CNN @BarackObama is the one who threatened to use his pen for executive orders &amp; in fact he did, bypassing congressional approval often.  So go @realDonaldTrump!  At least President Trump isn't paying billions to Iran for nukes, but is using it to make Americans safe! #THANKSTRUMP
@WSJ A typical response by the Pope &amp; his hierarchy!  Talk, talk, talk, but do nothing while these pedophiles continue to hurt children &amp; nuns!  People, get out of these un-Christian churches &amp; find one where the people are nurtured, not abused &amp; warn your kids!
@dcexaminer They won't embarrass you @SenSchumer &amp; @SpeakerPelosi because you radical Dems have no shame, but they will embarrass themselves to the world, who reads this @AOC nonsense Green Deal and laughs their heads off!  They're watching to see what idiots embrace this!
@ABC Jackson is just another extension of Muellar--the swamp--another Dem Obama appointee! If Muellar wasn't buying her off, he wouldn't have any convictions! Women like her disgust me!  She has no qualms about destroying people's lives over a witch hunt!
You Dems want to support a proposal on gun restrictions, while at the same time refuse to do anything to help people like this?  You're a bunch of cold-hearted frauds! @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer https://t.co/IaxS9DWWKx
@erod214er @MSNBC @maddow Oh no, I couldn't stand to watch her!  Her tweets are way enough for me, but others that do watch her are wondering what's up.  Who knows. I actually feel kind of sorry for her because it's not fun to fail.
@Eugene_Robinson And there are about 300 in the House &amp; Senate called evil, radical Democrats!
@TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi is the biggest national emergency!  She MUST be voted out before she leads the Democrats in destroying our beautiful country because of her ego &amp; radical ways!
@AnnCoulter You don't act like a Republican, nor a Democrat, nor an Independent, nor a Libertarian!  So who the heck are you?  You're losing followers because you're whining too much!  Why don't you run for an office since you like to talk!  The only problem is, what party?
@ewarren You forgot one!  Lizzie's true heritage is an emergency too, so the poor Native Americans can get away from her and some other heritage can "un-claim" her!
@dcexaminer I'm for REAL WOMEN like @SenMcSallyAZ instead of "half &amp; halfers" like @SenatorSinema!
@dcexaminer I'm for REAL WOMEN like @SenMcSallyAZ instead of half &amp; halfers like @Sinema
@MSNBC @maddow OH boy!  Maddow, you are DESPERATE for news!  The more you post, the more pathetic you look!  This is NOT NEWS!  Geez!  When is MSNBC going to get someone that reports some semblance of news!  LOL
@AndrewPollackFL @joelpollak @realDonaldTrump I sincerely apologize to you because of the hatred of these evil Dems.  If you are Christians, be reassured that one day you will be reunited with your precious princess!  Blessings to you &amp; may God's peace &amp; love help ease your pain.
@WSJ Oh boy, a future America if @AOC's sweet Green New Deal passes &amp; we have no electricity!  Is everyone as excited as I am?  We better stock up now on paraffin stoves &amp; bikes!  #DemsGoneCrazy
@COSProject @benshapiro Since the radical Dems believe they are going to take control of the world in 2020, this will be great to contain them should they be successful!
@RevJJackson Jesse, you have no room to call anyone or anything immoral with your background of cheating on your wife!  So if you are going to keep using the title of Reverend, then you need to get on with your Christian duties &amp; refrain from calling people names!  Judge not!
@NBCNews No tricks are necessary when many come together in love from the love of Jesus Christ who is pure love!  Those of you full of hate &amp; anger, all you need to do is invite Jesus into your heart in a simple prayer, turn away from your old ways &amp; you too can have a life full of joy!
@JudicialWatch @SenBooker is no Spartacus, but rather an ignormous in such desperate need for attention. He definitely has a bad case of ADD with mental health issues!  Justice Kavanaugh was so extremely intelligent, that those demeaning him looked like childish bullies including @KamalaHarris.
@AriMelber Regression is:		"I made straight A's thru high schoo!"	"I made straight A's thru college, with just one 'B'!"	I made straight A's getting my Master's with just one 'C'!"	I made straight A's getting my PhD, with just one 'D'!"	"I can't find a decent job, so I'm working at MSNBC!"

@NBCNews @DNC Is this going to be your child?  If so, then you don't deserve to have a precious child, when it was in your power to make a difference, but your Dem ego did nothing!  Despicable Dem Congress!  There will be no excuse on judgment day before God!  Blood is on your hands!
@JoaquinCastrotx Are you saying this is fake news? If it was your family dying, THEN it would be a national crisis &amp; major emergency! You ignoramous!	NBC News @NBCNews	 Arizona and other southwestern states bordering Mexico have become a hot spot in the nation's fentanyl crisis.
@JoaquinCastrotx TRUMP ROCKS!  Call the emergency even if Joachim Castro doesn't like it!  He's not President!  #BUILDTHATWALL!!!!
@Aureliansage You believe SNOPES?  LOL  They're as radical as you are!  Russian troll??  LOL You Dems really need to have someone send you the early morning email word of the day because even Muellar has moved on from that one!  Only you &amp; Schiff hang on!  What a hack!
@Aureliansage @robreiner You are not addressing anything I said, but rather making up your own typical radical Dem mumbo jumbo.  I don't know what the heck you are babbling about so maybe you should go call someone who cares!
@realDonaldTrump Pres Trump: From a border state, my  friends &amp; I are imploring you to NOT accept the Democrat proposal. Just declare an emergency, go through the petty court appeal and then on to the Supreme Court, which will approve your emergency! Then go for full amount!
@robreiner I know who I am!  I used to laugh watching your start on TV as "meathead." You were kind of geeky &amp; goofy back then, but WOW what you have become is unreal--just a constant spew of hatred &amp; anger, both of which are killers!  Take a break, it's Valentines Day!
@Aureliansage @robreiner This EXACTLY details the country's insane, radical Democrats in the House &amp; Senate!  Fortunately, the country is becoming awakened to the fact that we don't want Socialism, Green Deals, to kill newborn babies or open borders so illegal aliens can come in &amp; murder our citizens!
To @krassenstein &amp; @EdKrassen:  Hey guys, put a little love in your heart!  It's Valentines Day!  💕
@MSNBC Typical ditzy FAKE NEWS reporter!  Isn't it a BIG WIN considering @SpeakerPelosi was determined to stand up to @realDonaldTrump with her big "One Dollar" offer and no more!  I guess her Dem reps didn't listen too well!  LOL
@JuneJacksom @allinwithchris @MSNBC I guess if anyone valued your opinion, then it might be worth something, but since everybody has one, yours is just one more--basically worthless!  So spare us!
@AOC Good for you for finally starting to open your eyes to reality! Keep looking &amp; you'll realize lobbyists are the dark side of DC. Then look more &amp; you might come to the reality that there are many evil Democrats who are strictly there for their own agenda, bought out by lobbyists!
@theblaze @realDonaldTrump's the most brilliant President ever! That's why the people love &amp; admire him! He &amp; Whitaker are a breath of fresh air--STRONG men that don't put up with nonsense &amp; drive the radical Dems bonkers &amp; always one step ahead of them!  Compare him to @RepAdamSchiff  LOL

@JacquelineKupu @Sandee05101943 @NBCNews Pro-life people care about ALL lives--children, women &amp; men--as all are equal in God's eyes! You bet we care about unborn babies &amp; now insane Dems have endorsed that it's okay to kill babies AFTER they are born!  It's called MURDER &amp; one day all those involved will burn in hell!
@JacquelineKupu @Sandee05101943 @NBCNews Chistianity &amp; Judiasm go hand in hand, as both serve the same God &amp; both are under attack every day by atheists. Muslim ban? Who are kidding?

@Jim_Jordan @AdamSchiff Shifty Schiff is a fraud from way back! He's got the most pitiful case of Trump Derangement Syndrome ever!  He is looking more desperate every day to find something, ANYTHING, on President Trump and bombs out every time!  He's like the ex-husband that never goes away!
@MSNBC @maddow Poor Maddow still looking for a drama story in last week's news, while she's missing all the good news this week.  Her ratings just keep going \\\\DOWN////

@dcexaminer @CoryBooker is such a darling drama queen.  He is so out of place in DC when he could be such an asset to Hollywood!
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Whitaker was a class act in the middle of a bunch of crazed Dem vipers!
@JoyceWhiteVance The whole "lock her up" was &amp; still is based on the umpteen crimes, too numerous to count if the truth be known, by @HillaryClinton!  If her day of reckoning doesn't happen here, it will on Judgment day, you can be sure!
@shaunking @AOC Conservatives are scared??  LOL  It's the Democrats that are falling all over themselves trying to keep up with her brainless ideas!  It's pathetic to watch!
@robreiner The honest soul of America was destroyed a long time ago by people like you with all the vile, filthy movies &amp; promotion of drugs, &amp; on &amp; on!  So don't try to stuff your opinions down our throat without some facts to back it up, meathead!
@RubenGallego For appearances to try to overcome her past behavior of her affair with the married ex-mayor!
@AOC @RepRaskin Typical childish behavior!  This is my toy, don't touch it!"  Who are you?  You don't run a darn thing except your mouth!  And you most certainly DON'T run Mr. Whitaker or the President!  So dream on with your Green DREAM Deal! You're crash day is coming!
@HuffPost Clapper is just a pitiful, extremely angry man with a really bad case of Trump Derangement Syndrome!  Whitaker was awesome!  He had those radical Dems totally frustrated!  It was so fun to watch their drama with each one trying to outdo the other, while Whitaker was very calm!
@larryelder @amyklobuchar I have a question for you. What's the difference in a white person dressing like an African American, or African Americans straightening their hair &amp; bleaching it or wearing blond wigs &amp; light makeup? We see this everyday. Aren't they both racist or neither is? Neither is racist!
@DrewMccrite @BLKFOX007 @olaeyes @MSNBC I hope so.  Maybe I'll sell turtles!  LOL
@PastorJohnHagee God needs to deliver us from the evil, radical Democrats!
@CNN @CNNOpinion I think maybe @realDonaldTrump perhaps learned how to use executive authority from @BarackObama who threatened everybody &amp; everything with "his pen" if things didn't go his way!  There is no constitutional crisis; the only crisis is the one in your foolish head!  Let Ellis know!
@MSNBC If @PramilaJayapal was genuinely concerned, she would have already been down to the border to find out for herself how many kids are supposedly separated from their families!  It was just a bunch of "I care" drama and certainly NOT sincere!
@olaeyes @MSNBC Both Whitaker &amp; Kavanaugh were fantastic! But Whitaker probably saw how the Dems tried to destroy Kavanaugh so he was way more prepared for their drama, which certainly did not disappoint us!  It  was rather enjoyable to watch the frustration of those "smart" Dems!
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump If you weren't stuck in a skyrise in DC and could venture down to the real world along the border, then you might know that it is a national emergency!
@treasonstickers Dissolve Democrat infanticide killers!
@BadExampleMan @sportslinq @treasonstickers Only if we can dissolve "Bad Examples" too!
@nowthisnews @AmatMike @RepRubenGallego People like you, Gallego, are a major part of the problem. You sit in an office &amp; talk &amp; talk and do nothing!

"Green card holders cannot do everything that U.S. citizens can. They cannot vote in U.S. elections." Are you a green card holder that's been voting illegally?
@jhnnyv123 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiff Yeah, their coffers will go down dramatically if they don't get their Big Pharna kickbacks!  I think @Pelosi should have been investigated for insider trading too!
@11thHour @MSNBC @CynthiaAlksne This ignorant woman didn't like Whitaker's answers, so a typical response from a radical Dem dimwit is to demean someone instead of attempting to give a professional answer.  Mr. Whitaker was so above this woman in intelligence, she couldn't stand feeling so stupid &amp; inadequate.
@washingtonpost I'm not okay with teens saying the "F" word.  It shows me their parents are not respectful and haven't taught their children to be respectful either. And it's really disgusting to hear @RashidaTlaib talking that way, but then what else can one expect from a vulgar Muslim woman?
@MSNBC You radical Dems, including MSNBC reporters are a bunch of people filled with anger &amp; rage &amp; always striking out at people that don't agree exactly like you. Your only defense is to try to demean people.  There's nothing pleasant about you.  You could at least be professional.
@MSNBC Is this just an MSNBC reporter whining because he had to pay some taxes this year?  I would guess this is just more FAKE NEWS from another "unnamed" source!
@AOC The saddest type of people are those like you who think they are smart because they don't have the mental capacity to know they're not!  They just keep on keepin' on in la-la land!
@SenSanders Bernie, thousands of Americans would love for you to resign from everything, but unfortunately for us that hasn't happened!  Where's the man's due process?  His guilt or innocence certainly should not be based on yours or anyone else's OPINIONS!  #SPAREUS
@the_USO Thank you to our brothers &amp; sisters who are selflessly serving to keep us the "Land of the Free &amp; the Home of the Brave."  I look foward to the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns to rule &amp; there will be wars no more!  May God bless you &amp; see you safely home!
@KamalaHarris Oh brother look who's talking! The puritan, herself! The one who dated the former MARRIED San Fran mayor, who's twice her age, for umpteen years! And as a former AG, she's conveniently forgotten that a person is guranteed due process!  Who values her opinion?  President?  No way!
@srl @HuffPost Is the woman so stupid that she didn't know her ex-boyfriend was an illegal alien? How long did she know him, an hour? Or was he ever a boyfriend?  Wonder how many other exe's she's helped vote illegally!  I don't buy that line at all!
@allinwithchris @MSNBC Rosenberg's the former clerk for fired FBI's Comey, so his opinion was left-tainted, to start! Whitaker gave the most superlative testimony to date!  He had total command of his answers and how to run out the clock, totally frustrating the Dems asking the most demented questions.
@charliekirk11 @Wild_Bill_STL @KamalaHarris Of all the Democrat candidates, @SenKamalaHarris is the most radical &amp; evil of them all. Beware of that polished phony smile and giggle she can turn on &amp; off at will &amp; then how fast they disappear! But never ever forget how cold &amp; demeaning she was toward Justice Kavanaugh! #HATE
@jaketapper Why should Fairfax resign based on allegations only?  We've seen enough Anita Hills and Christine Fords to last a lifetime! I'm tired of people being accused with no due process first!  That is not the American way and those who accuse people with no facts are the worthless ones!
@washingtonpost If the Washington FAKE NEWS Post (company owned by Bezos) is reporting this, then the emails are probably not at all illegal!  The Post has shabby reporting at best, and if the boss Bezos tells them what to report, that's exactly what they will report!
@AC360 @andersoncooper @andersoncooper:  Do you think the American people are so gullible that we believe that CNN is such a terrific reporter of the news, that they would know "with luck' to be at Roger Stone's house at precisely 6:00 am with lights on and cameras rolling? #SPAREUS
@CNN I think it would be way more fun to see Bezos take on the FAKE NEWS that CNN puts out. Except CNN wouldn't have the nerve to take on the richest man in the world.  He would bankrupt them.  But that would be a good thing.
@chuckwoolery @TuckerCarlson Good luck trying to defend @AOC.  I guess it takes one nut to defend another one!
@davidwebbshow @CoryBooker @SenKamalaHarris @TheDemocrats @nypost Here we go again!

@washingtonpost Part of the message is: "There’s someone to gather the facts. To bring you the story." What a novel approach if the Wash. Post were to gather and present the FACTS instead of their distorted &amp; untruthful opinions!
@washingtonpost Trump does everything first according to the FAKE NEWS Wash Post!

@AOC Is this kind of like the wall on the border where you've never been so you have no idea what you're talking about? Instead of running your mouth, why don't you and your Muslim friends get out and start seeing reality in our country so you can actally have some facts to work with!

@AOC @saikatc Who are you kidding @saikatc?  She says you put the information together and that's because she isn't smart enough to do it herself!
@AOC You are partly responsible for this upside-down world, that was purring along very nicely under the leadership of President Trump until you and your radical Dems started turning everything upside down with your idiotic ideas!
@MarcelMcClinton @DanCrenshawTX You are dead wrong Marc!  Mr. Crenshaw is a rational thinking man not carried away with insane radical or self-serving ideas! You should be grateful for his service or are you an @AOC freakazoid lover? Sounds like it!

@danhsmith73 @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Per your profile that says: "Quite why everyone is so emotional is a mystery. Work on it," I think you need to either revise your profile or work on your own emotions instead of preaching to others!  Your statement above is pretty darn emotional!

@RealSaavedra @AOC Absolutely both should resign! @RepMaxineWaters doesn't have the mental capacity to handle anything, much less financial issues, unless it's for her pockets! And @IlhanMN is a Muslim and they are taught to hate all Jews so she has no business being on the Foreign Affairs Comm.
@AOC You are dead wrong!  Don't be preaching to us about polls. Plls are used by Democrats to spread their lies!  REAL Americans are for a wall! We are also for immigration when done by the law!  We are still a country of laws if you would take the time to learn them!  #STOPTHELIES

@Sandee05101943 @NBCNews I wasn't offended. I'm not Catholic, but I am a Christian, who totally condemns the evil actions of these pedophiles who belong in prison! My concern was your belief that God doesn't exist because of their evil actions! God is real and is only about love!

@gmansteelers @NBCNews @GOP Stop your nonsense! Abusing children is NOT a GOP thing and certainly not a true Christian thing either. This is a Catholic issue that has never been dealt with by the Pope. These pedophiles just get shuffled around, never excommunicated or reported for prosecution!

@vbeltran13 @ananavarro If you know your Bible as a Christian, it says, "The truth will set you FREE."  John 8:32 I don't condone lying either because all liars will be cast into hell! Rev. 21:8 If we pick our politicians based on honesty, there would be very few. Shalome!
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Contraceptives are a heck of a lot cheaper than abortions!  Responsible women will use contraceptives!  And they don't have the head trips that most women feel after having an abortion, unless they are women without a conscience!  It will haunt them for the rest of their lives!
@RevJJackson @thinkprogress @SantitaJ @PatriotAM1150 @RealTalk910 The way the radical Dems want to change the tax codes and everything else, who blames them! BTW, why are you tweeting this kind of news instead of condemning news about killing babies, Mr. Reverend? I guess it depends on what type of reverend you are! Certainly not Christian!
@maddow Stop putting out your FAKE NEWS polls! Nobody but gullible people believe your polls after your presidential polls were WAY off!  LOL
@KenDilanianNBC Just another FAKE news reporter's opinion.  It's like your polls!  Wrong!
@vbeltran13 @ananavarro You really should consider removing "Christian" off of your profile of yourself!  Reading your comments doesn't show me or the world that you in anyway reflect real Christian values!  Just some food for thought as you won't answer to me on judgment day, but rather to God!
@KSD371 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Didn't we hear the same thing about his poll numbers in 2016?  All those polls the day of the election too?
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you need to give yourself some mental health counseling!  Such anger!
@nullifidian222 Historian John R. Alden maintains that George Washington himself added the phrase "so help me God" to the end after administration of his first oath.  I would say that's the beginning of our country!
RT @CriticalCripple: @MaryBarton08 believe in a god:	~85% of democrats	~93% of republicans
@robbystarbuck The only way to stop people like this is to show up at meetings like this and protest LOUDLY!  We need to stand up united against evil
@GerarddeMarigny @robbystarbuck @StanNorred I'll be more blunt.  "Thou shalt not kill!" Those who kill will be cast into the lake of fire, called hell, whether they believe in God or not!
@brothergene @robbystarbuck It's too bad her mother didn't abort her!
@Shbi25 @robbystarbuck @dbongino We need to run people like her not only out of office, but out of the country!  Sick. demented athiests!
@MSNBC Give up your danged FAKE polls!  Another poll says she's the most hated woman in America!  That one I believe!

I love what you've put in your profile because it's so true!  You should tweet that out often!
@nullifidian222 I agree with everything you've said, but it still has meaning to those who are not athiests &amp; it's been a part of our American heritage from the beginning of our country. It is sad that some people don't believe in God because if they did they wouldn't be lying &amp; stealing, etc,
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Gee, I didn't know that drones, cameras, or motion sensors could stop someone!  Get real!
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump And you've been to the border how many times that makes you an authority on what is needed? And you don't lock your doors or have any walls or fences around your house, if you have one?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I thought you were a doctor per your profile!  I didn't know you worked at a port of entry too so that you know first hand where the illegal drugs are coming in! Keep your first job because you're not doing too well at the second one--probably never even been to the border!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You probably have never even been to the border so how do you know a wall isn't needed?  You &amp; your bro. talk smack without any facts!
@TexasEEOLaw @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Be sure to keep your day job because your poetry sucks!
@nullifidian222 To athiests it's a useless phrase, but the majority of Americans are not athiests like you!
I demand to know why you are proposing to remove "So help me God" from the oath to swear in witnesses? This just shows how low the radical and Godless Democrat party has stooped. Your constituents will hear about this because most of them are God-loving people! #ATHEISTS
@FitchGm @fluv1234 @MeghanMcCain Don't argue with a fool and especially an atheist fool!  But God still loves you and maybe some day you'll feel his love instead of being so angry!  Shalome!

@MaddowBlog @MSNBC You and your FAKE NEWS!  Where's your facts?  Were you there?  "That we know of" are your key words!  You don't know jack!  Just another one of your stupid theories!  Spare us!
@MichaelFacey6 @MeghanMcCain Babies don't ask to be born - yet people kill them anyway!	Guns alone don't kill people - yet people kill people anyway! 	Both are choices by people with extreme hatred or without a conscience, with the exception of emergency abortions! It has nothing to do with politics or NRA!
@FitchGm @fluv1234 @MeghanMcCain People like you don't like big government, so why do they go seeking an abortion from government-funded abortion clinics like Planned Parenthood? What a stupid argument! How about "Thou shalt not kill!" If you don't want a baby, then don't make one! Contraceptives are very cheap!
@DakotaBelvoir07 @MeghanMcCain Then what gives you the right to decide about someone else's body, like the baby's body?  Hypocrite!
@lacasasinclair @Bigmaned12 @MeghanMcCain Just because someone doesn't believe in God doesn't mean He's not real!  How many people are there who on their dying bed want someone to pray with or for them? How many athiests had a near-death experience and came back with a whole change in their beliefs? MANY!
@AmyCaires @MeghanMcCain You might wish you'd learned a little theology like "Thou shalt not kill" when your biology is burning in hell for all eternity! Athiest women who have abortions will never erase the memory that they killed their own innocent baby!  It will haunt them forever!
@CatalinaCruzNY @AOC @DailyCaller LOL at Ms. Esquire!  @AOC is working or just making a lot of noise with her ridiculous statements?
@CNNTonight @CNN I would bet none of you idiotic FAKE NEWS reporters have even been to the border, so you're just repeating the exact words you were instructed to say when you read your morning email instructions, all just to keep a job!  You're all pathetic &amp; @ananavarro is just plain mean!
@dcexaminer @JohnCornyn and Republicans in Texas need to strongly support getting their borders controlled to keep out the influx of illegal aliens who no doubt are voting as instructed for Democrats!  You better get your voting rolls purged too! God help us all if the radical Dems win!
@MSNBC @AriMelber @AOC is just a political pawn being used by the FAKE NEWS media because she makes a lot of noise and she's probably the most inept person in Congress!  I will say she's good for laughs at all her screwups, but she'll be replaced as soon as you media find someone more interesting!
@NikkiHaley Everybody involved in this insane practice to kill innocent babies, which includes those voted into office approving this, those who voted them into office, the abortion doctors, nurses &amp; the mother are all MURDERERS &amp; will be cast into hell for all eternity! Thou shalt not kill!
@KamalaHarris Lead by example to end all violence, not just gun violence! People appointed to be a SC Justice should be treated with respect--not with your violent verbal attacks filled with HATEFUL, abusive words to Justice Kavanaugh attempting to destroy him! Gun violence begins with hate!
@dcexaminer @AOC doesn't intimidate any white "men" I know!  I do know they get a kick out of her stupidity &amp; it gives 'em something to laugh about!  She's just a political pawn for the FAKE NEWS media, somebody new to talk about because she makes a lot of noise! She'll be replaced soon!
@CNN Why is this the only "hate crime" reported by the news media &amp; @SpeakerPelosi? People are attacked &amp; murdered daily in Chicago, but we don't hear about those! What are they, love crimes? Hardly! They are all horrendous hate crimes &amp; outrageous, but nothing is done by your mayor.
@SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett How about you set the example to stop the hatred?  Don't preach to us when nothing but hatred spews out of your mouth!   You're the most hated woman in America by the latest polls and it isn't because you are so full of love!  So you lead the way!

@MercadoDollie @tombrokaw You're dead wrong Dollie!  Racism started up again with Obama!  The only people he catered to were blacks and Muslims!  If you were neither you weren't important!  The only reason he had his 2 token whites, Biden &amp; Clinton, were because he beat them both in the Presidential race!
@reezie327 @tombrokaw Nice clean comment!  I hope the rest of your Spanish is better than that or you're a digrace to your heritage, pendejo!
Laura, a BIG THANK YOU for once not talking over your guests on your Fox News show!  When you keep interrupting and talk over your guests, we can't understand them or you!  It's very irritating; otherwise your shows are great!
@KamalaHarris You are simply using your half-black heritage to try to get the black vote! But the black people are getting smart and realizing that Dems haven't done anything for them in years!  All talk and no action!  And you are one smoother talker!
@BernieSanders Who are you standing with for President, Bernie?  Hillary?  So she can screw you over again?
@ajtorres71 @PPact @PPFA Your profile says it all!  It seems you are a radical lib follower without a conscience; a cold-hearted atheist!  What a sad pathetic life; just wandering through life without any purpose!  Well, God still loves you and you still have time to turn your life around. Shalome!
@dcexaminer Sounds like @ninaburleigh has jealousy going on regarding her story about Melanie Trump! It's too bad because Melania is such a beautiful person, but each person has beauty in different aspects! Ms. Burleigh needs to find the beauty in herself &amp; stop writing untruths about others
@MSNBC @AnnCoulter what the heck got into you? You're acting like a spoiled brat &amp; your tweets are proof of that! If you want to make all the decisions, then you need to run for President! Until then, some criticism is fine, but you're way out in LEFT field! Go to your safe spot &amp; chill
@ananavarro @KamalaHarris And I look forward to the day when @CNN sees what a drag you are and boots you out the door!  You give Hispanics a bad name with your nasty attitude!  Disgusting!
@SenFeinstein @MSNBC says the shutdown cost $11 billlion, but you're saying only $3 billion. So who's right?  Probably neither one of you!  Can't you people ever get anything right?
@dcexaminer @SenSanders is a kook, Socialist, fraud &amp; liar if you believe all the stuff he's promising with no bucks to pay for it.  So you get all these freebies and then you'll pay for it with mega taxes on everything from your paycheck to mega taxes on everything you buy!  That's smart?
@SenSanders I'll settle for taking the wealth you have!  But I want it before you bankrupt the country with your crazy ideas &amp; everybody has nothing!  People with money will just take their money and the millions of jobs they create &amp; move to another country.  Then what?  Get real Bernard!
@stl_2004 @Madelyn_Teresa @KamalaHarris So are you a supporter of Kamala?  Google her racy background and how many thousands she put in prison as AG!  Guess you better look for someone else to follow if you're looking for a puritan!  I doubt you'll find one!  I'm looking for results--jobs. tax cuts, a border wall, etc.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump If this is all you can come up with, these are pretty pathetic excuses!  May I ask what have you done for anyone lately besides complain?  I would guess you have a safe room where you can go de-stress!  You need to go there and rethink your life and come out happy!
@Isaythere @KamalaHarris @BarackObama YOU keep a healthy life too because when you're forced to rely on "Medicare for all" and the country is bankrupt, you'll be up a creek. I reached my peak of learning when I finally saw the light! Keep watching and if you open your blind eyes you might see it too!  Ciao &amp; Shalome
@Isaythere @AdamSchiff Being in politics for 8 years, I learned the games people play &amp; foolish men who blindly follow along shifting the way the wind blows! I'm the Trump type that tells it like it is and does something to fix it! I'm not in any crisis except for the one our country is headed toward!
@Isaythere @KamalaHarris @BarackObama was nothing but a cocky, smooth-talking, lying, half-black Muslim apologizing for a country that gave him opportunities he didn't appreciate! But when confronted to back up his mouth, he was a pathetic coward! I refuse to sit calmly &amp; watch a repeat! That's your bag!
@SenSanders How can anybody get a word in edgewise. when you talk nonstop about nothing! @realDonaldTrump couldn't do anything to save those lives in Vegas; that was a casino issue!  But he's darn sure trying to prevent murders by illegal aliens because that is HIS job! SO MOVE ASIDE!
@AdamSchiff @Isaythere We need a way to shut you down as well! We can't watch or read the news without you giving your 2 cents worth!  Go take a long vacation and give the world a break!  #VOTE #SCHIFF #OUT!
@KamalaHarris @Isaythere You want to guarantee middle-class familes a pay increase and then take it away plus some in taxes for all your insane ideas! Just another political hack, all talk, no action! We already had 8 years of that under Obama and it brought everybody down! We don't need anymore of that!
@Madelyn_Teresa @KamalaHarris She also slept her way up the political ladder! Her MARRIED sugar daddy lover for many years &amp; 30 yrs older than her is Willie Brown, former San Fran. mayor. He appointed her to two lucrative positions and then financed her to become AG in Calif. Now she's married to a white guy!
@KamalaHarris Kamala is using her half black heritage to suck in the black vote!  She's going to push the "poor me" mentality!  Police, both black &amp; white, are being killed in larger numbers, but there's no mention of that!  She's just another politician promising a bunch of hot air!
@SpeakerPelosi Pelosi talks about standing up to hatred, when she's the number one most hated woman in America!  A complete fraud!
@KamalaHarris She says to fight for our future! I'll never forget how Justice Kavanaugh had to fight for his future while Kamala treated him like dirt, bullied him, called him a liar and talked down to him like he was a low life!  She's a phony &amp; will do or say anything to get your vote!
@dcexaminer Arrogant @SpeakerPelosi &amp; conceited @SenSchumer's days are coming!   Pride always shows before a fall &amp; what goes around comes around!  We'll just sit and watch it happen!
@PPact @PPFA You Planned Parenthood people are the most vile murderers ever of innocent babies!  That's bad enough without making up lies too!  The ban was for Muslim TERRORISTS and it wasn't about faith!  It's people like you causing division in our country!  Good versus Evil!
@DanRather You're sounding a bit jealous that you aren't &amp; never were part of a winning news channel like @foxandfriends who report true news! We remember your days when you were forced to leave your long-time news position due to the untruths you reported as the truth!  Rather fake news!
@Rosie President Trump will never be as messed up as you are!  You've got Trump Derangement Syndrome really bad!  And such anger &amp; bitterness, always ready to fight!  You used to be a funny comedian!  What happened?
@StevenBeschloss All that needs to be said is that Donald Trump is President and you are not!!  Jealous maybe or just a radical Dem?  The only assessments you have came from @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer, the two that can't tell the truth about anything!
@ABC Why don't you FAKE NEWS media just admit that these figures are what you wish they were - not what they actually are!  Your polls are always off - way off!  Why is President Trump in the White House when you told us it was going to be @HillaryClinton?  Give up your phony polls!
@djrothkopf I would much rather watch them than one more minute of @SpeakerPelosi
@MSNBC I don't see conservatives obsessed with @AOC except to respond to all her craziness, but I do see her as just a political pawn being used by the FAKE NEWS media until someone or something better comes along and then they will drop her like a hot potato!
@dcexaminer Another DESPERATE @SpeakerPelosi looking for something, anything, on Trump!  If she would spend 1/10 of her time getting something, anything, done for the American people, she might be tolerable!
@wsbtv @whpresscorps Then that should mean 500 days of cartoons!
@RepSpeier @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Jackie, keep your day job because your comedy is falling flat!
@ABC @ThisWeekABC Another FAKE NEWS POLL story because it's nosey ABC that wants to know!  Trump's tax returns are too complicated for the average person to decipher and my poll says 9 out of 10 people could care less!
@WSJ Why are a majority of the items sold in big companies like Walmart made in China! These companies make their profits from American buyers, so why are they not supporting these same people by purchasing the items they make in the USA?
@EdKrassen Indictment based on what?  Where's your facts. Eddie?  Are you smarter than Mueller and his gang of lawyers who have found nothing in two years!!  I think not; you're just another blithering idiot!
@StoneRicharde1 @BostonGlobe @KamalaHarris is doing exactly what OBama did! Obama never mentioned his white mother &amp; Kamala doesn't mention her India(n) mother in order to pick up the black vote!  But many African-Americans are figuring out they're being used by the Dems, who have done nothing for them!
@beconsistent100 @BostonGlobe @KamalaHarris long-time affair was with Willie Brown, former San Francisco Mayor, who was 30 years older and very married to a beautiful gal!  After getting Kamala two lucrative political jobs, he finally dropped her and went back to his wife, but he's probably still helping her!
Comparing @realDonaldTrump to anything Hitler is about as low-level as you can get!  It's not comedy and those who think your sick jokes like this are funny are as demented as you are!  Watching you is about as exciting as watching paint dry!  Clean up your act &amp; try true comedy!
@JoyceWhiteVance But we've all sure heard more than enough nonsense from radical Dems like yourself and meatheads like @robreiner!
@gtconway3d No they're either laughing at you or disgusted by you!  How does Kellyanne tolerate your behavior?
@idfonline @netanyahu Israel is always one of the first to respond with help to those in need, whether friend or foe! One of the greatest nations in the world!
@washingtonpost Says who?  I'm sure the Washington Post's researchers went around the march and took a survey of everyone there to find out who were moderates and who were radicals! Just another FAKE NEWS story!
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump Oh my, had the Trump haters known that, they would have stripped him of his championship titles!
@dcexaminer Tell this to @AOC because she's so intelligent she hasn't figured it out yet and @SenSanders is too old to remember what Socialism is because all he can do is spit out hate speech!
@CNN It's sad for all the losses, but the leaders there were very uncooperative and seemly were themselves unprepared for hurricanes that are not something new there! And they didn't use the supplies that were shipped by the boatloads, now sitting there rotting!  So who's to blame?
@washingtonpost This is probably more fake news! But, the IRS hasn't ever been good about responding to its mail even when fully staffed! There are probably still Obama staff holdovers taking their time in responding to inquiries from conservatives, particularly when it's non-profit requests!
@dcexaminer Does anyone truly care what the @washingtonpost thinks?  It's always either FAKE NEWS or hatred for Trump and other conservatives!  When they keep losing bucks, there will be layoffs there soon!
@dcexaminer Where are your Journalists who can simply report the news?  The world is already overflowing with opinionated writers with most often an opinion based on rewriting of the facts or a lack of any facts upon which to base an opinion!  You may be the next co. laying off people!
@dcexaminer Why are we surprised to see the Huffington Post, Buzzfeed &amp; USA Today laying off a lot of staff? It's because people are tired of FAKE NEWS! Maybe the @washingtonpost, @nytimes &amp; TVNews media will get the message and start reporting news instead of just distorted opinions!
@larryelder @AOC Excellent article written by @marcthiessen &amp; based on facts!  Larry, fortunately the Republican party doesn't seem to have such an outspoken clueless person like @AOC, except maybe @SenatorRomney!
@dcexaminer If @SenFeinstein, @MarkWarner &amp; @RepAdamSchiff were investigated like @realDonaldTrump has been the world would see who the crooked politicians are!  These Dems 2 yrs later are still looking for ANYTHING on Trump!  Their findings are ZERO to date!  Pathetic Dem Desperados!
@MarkYoungTruth @seanhannity Does this egotistical reporter @Acosta really think people will buy his book?  Only those desperate for reading material!  We can see for ourselves on the news how everything he does is all about him!  The absolute best was when Kellyanne Conway put him in his place!
@Kristin_Hook First you are a Democrat, so you were biased before you started! Next you are affected by the shutdown and of course Democrats all blame Trump because they go against anything Trump related. People living/working along the border cite completely different facts based on reality!
@kindraf @Aqualyra @lastcarlinian @Kristin_Hook And you've been to the border how many times so you can speak based on reality?  Never!  Ignorance is when you provide "supposed" facts based on nothing but your opinion, which is worthless!
@KamalaHarris How's your lover, Willie Brown, doing these days?  Is he going to help you win this race too? I will NOT support women who try to steal other womens' husbands, especially when the goal is to climb up the political ladder in order to line your pockets with big bucks! Disgusting!
@ABC Spare us with your polls!  They are always inaccurate! Remember when your polls said Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump?  We don't forget!
@RepMarkMeadows I was kind of hoping his SOTU would be held in the Senate building so we wouldn't have to look at @SpeakerPelosi's sour face! I was considering not even watching because of her, but I think the President wants her to have to sit through it and suffer!  She's such a trip!
@DanRather Shall we refer to when you lied BIG TIME and were forced out of your long-time job at CBS? That FINE print? You should have been on Trump's Reality Show and we all could have watched him say, "You're Fired!" It's time for you to retire, permanently!  Spare us from your wisdom!
@DanRather You talk real cutesy now, but I remember when you were forced to leave your long-time job at CBS for lying!  Looks like much hasn't changed!  You're just like the rest of the far-left liberal Dems!  No facts, just a bunch of your bogus opinionated rhetoric!
@theslymagpie @Morning_Joe Don't get too cocky Mag!!  @HillaryClinton thought she could crush @realDonaldTrump too, but it didn't work out too well for her!   You might end up eating your bugs!!  LOL

@TheeBamPow @MSNBC I'm perpetually in awe of your idiocracy!!
@MSNBC CORRECTION:  Sorry to say this is just one more FAKE NEWS story!!
@AP Remember how @KamalaHarris acted at Kavanaugh's hearing. Before the hearing, she said she wouldn't vote for him; then she disrupted the start of the hearing by continuing to holler for a delay; during questioning she spoke in a condescending &amp; demeaning way &amp; tweetwd false info!

@lancewallnau Amen about the pastor--cut the tithes or change churches!  But for friends, I love to give them ears full of food for thought.  But what's sad is many of them hear nothing but fake news!  I then love to give them the true news as "the truth will set you free."
@CNN Nothing, just a typical day in the life of a big city FAKE NEWS reporter!
@RepAdamSmith Adam, what is dangerous &amp; undemocratic is you spineless men hiding behind Pelosi, instead of standing up to her and leading a bi-partisan vote to build the wall and make everyone safe &amp; happy! Be the leader you were elected to be, not a folllower!  Dare to make a real difference!
@MMFlint Socialists like to end free speech so you would be out of luck and out of tweeting!  Now that might not be a bad idea!
@WillieBoy2222 No, I'm busy getting caught up on the news and tweeting!  😀
@CBSNews Well, then maybe they should ban solo men from bar for possible "pimp" concerns!
@JoaquinCastrotx Better withdraw your "as I mentioned earlier today" because it's just more FAKE NEWS.  Real leaders create true stories, not forward FAKE ONES!  Better start checking your sources and facts before tweeting!!  Let this be a lesson!
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @POTUS @PaulaReidCBS You're just repeating FAKE NEWS without checking it's accuracy, over and over and over!  Will you never learn!!
@BreitbartNews Dream on @SpeakerPelosi!  Your title is fast becoming "most hated woman in America" because of all the suffering you are causing not only to Americans, but to the citizens of Mexico and those traveling in long caravans to nowhere and those who have died enroute!  What a legacy!
@TIME What it comes down to is that @realDonaldTrump is for all Americans and @SpeakerPelosi is only for herself and her show of power (in her mind only--stubbornness in reality).
@Sen_JoeManchin It would be appreciated by ALL Americans if you would work even harder to get your Dem cohorts to bypass Pelosi and vote to fund a security wall!  That would solve everyone's problems and make for a safer America.  Are you for ALL Americans or not?  #BUILDHEWALL
@SenFeinstein How about the interest money the country is losing because you wasteful Dems failed to pass a balanced budget during the @BarackObama years, but in fact doubled the national debt?  I've never seen you express concern about that, which is much more harmful to our economy!
@DanRather And all it would take is for @SpeakerPelosi to come down off her stubborn self-appointed pedestal and call for support from the Dems to build the wall--or for the Dems to override Pelosi and vote in Congress to build a wall, then @senatemajldr McConnell could call for a vote!!
@BernieSanders Part of the problem has been charter schools taking tax-payer funds that were meant for public schools.  Charter schools did not have the same rules to follow that public schools did, so millions of dollars in assets were stolen by dishonest people.
@DanRather I believe that's how you see it, but Americans see it as spineless Dems that should override Pelosi &amp; vote to build the wall! Workers could get paid; the American people would be safer; the Hondurans would stop their long caravans to nowhere, and Mexico could end their nightmare!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Build the wall with the money saved from foreign aid to these countries!
@BernieSanders Republicans swept the midterms because we liked the message and the promises made, have been promises kept!  Your message was and still is of ZERO subtance, except for your love of Socialism/Communism!
@BernieSanders @SenSanders you are such a hypocrite! Don't spew your lies about child health care! The only time you talk tough is when you are spouting your Socialist agenda that we are not interested in hearing! Move to Venezuela if you love Socialism!
@FoxNews @SarahKSilverman What a stupid woman!  We can love the sinner, but we cannot condone their sins.  The Bible says, "“[Y]ou may be sure that your sin will find you out” (Numbers 32:23).  Disgusting, pathetic man!  	Read more at https://t.co/vv6WMsPnuP."
@BreitbartNews Poor Janey!  We would be SO HAPPY for @Janefonda if she could spend her final years by relocating to Canada where she could "breathe" in marijuana, like her good old Vietnam days!! #airheadtraitor
@foxandfriends @RichardGrenell @Ocasio2018 Alexandria Cortez is one dumb bimbo!  During high school &amp; college, she must have slept through all her classes or was smoking the same stuff Obama did in college and she was and still is zoned out! She's an embarrassment to any political party! Just a loud mouth!
@CNN The whole world remembers CNN's forecast for President in 2016!  What a shock when your forecast for Hillary was so far off!!  Right? 😊  We don't have much confidence in your forecasts! Vote Republican and go to the top Gov. Scott Walker!
When did @Barrack_Obama44 EVER tell the truth? https://t.co/hoyfSvxu4P
"You who love the Lord, hate evil!" Psalm 97:10. Jesus, himself, had righteous anger! Our liberal society rebels against all forms of opposition to evil &amp; when we do speak against evil they try blame-shifting!  It's time, right now, to speak out against evil to save our country!
@NancyPelosi It's wonderful that you and the Democrats are for all these things, but when in session, YOU VOTE FOR NONE OF THESE!!  This is only a bunch of gibberish, lies and deceit you're using during voting time!!  #DraintheSwamp of losers!
@NancyPelosi You've been in Congress for 100 years!  What have you done to get medicine prices lowered?  Not a darn thing!!  Democrats have had NO plans to do anything until it's voting time!  This is just more of your phony political hogwash to try to pick up a few Democrat votes.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan Rod Rosenstein should have been fired a long time ago.  He refuses to testify before Congress and won't turn over the papers requested because it will expose that he is at the bottom of the whole FBI &amp; DOJ scam!!
@KamalaHarris You can't erase your DNA regardless of how you choose to look! Nobody is erasing anybody--just clarifying who is born male and female! The majority of Americans do not reside in California, like you, where so many crazy ideas originate! You're as screwed up as your governor! Sad!
@KamalaHarris Nobody is going to take away anybody's health care!  Just some more lies from your pathetic self!!
@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Poor Janey!  We would be SO HAPPY for @Janefonda if she could spend her final years by relocating to Canada where she could "breathe" in marijuana, like her good old Vietnam days!!
@HillaryClinton Hillary, do the whole world a favor and go away!  Even your own Democrat party wants you to go away!  Trump was elected because people got tired of your lies &amp; underhanded rhetoric!  Accept it!! Go spend your time being a good Grandma!
@robreiner I'm amazed at how you have bought into the fake news and continue to spread it!  Of course, I forgot that you're a part of the fake people in Hollywood, so I guess it's a given for you to spread fake news!  Pitiful, cuz I kind of liked you as "Meathead."
So true! https://t.co/shUDn7Dz0F
@DemRedistrict @EricHolder If anyone knows about rigged systems in America, it's Holder! We find out daily just how rigged the FBI &amp; DOJ were under the Obama/Holder/Clinton admin. Why were these same maps fine when Obama was running for President, but now they're not? Same map redistricting since 2010!
@cynthiasido @OfficeOfMike @SebGorka @CoryBooker You, on the other hand, sound like an angry, bitter, stressed out person, which is not good for your health.  In case you didn't know it, chronic stress can cause cancer!  So you need to chill out and calm down!  Blessings to you. 😊
@cynthiasido @OfficeOfMike @SebGorka @CoryBooker Ok, by your standards, then I'm hypocrite &amp; and a happy one at that because Brett Kavanaugh is now a Justice of the Supreme Court. And by the latest news Booker sexually assaulted a gay man! And prior to that he admitted to sexually assaulting a woman! He's quite a piece of work!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews My conservative views keep me thinking rational--not racist, liberal nonsense!  You sound like an angry, unhappy person who insists that your views are the only views possible!  Might be from your life's experiences! But blessings to you and I'm done with this conversation.
LOL!  What I was replying to your comment was supposed to be "Right on," but my mouse must have highlighted the "Right" and deleted it just as I was sending it, so all you saw was "on." Embarrassing!  LOL!  But I thought your comment was absolutely great and totally accurate.
@cynthiasido @OfficeOfMike @SebGorka @CoryBooker What you really mean is if I don't agree with your judgment of Justice Kavanaugh, then you think I'm a hypocrite! I guess if I valued your opinion, your comment might mean something, but since I don't, it doesn't really matter to me what you think!!
@SenSchumer Just more FAKE NEWS and scare tactics! When are you Dems going to come up w/some ideas of your own that are positive for our nation instead of just resisting everything the Republicans propose?  You don't have much time left to leave a great legacy for yourself!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews I'll never stop with my conservative view!  You started this conversation, so you stop with the liberal, leftist, racist gibberish!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews I understand perfectly because I have a grand-son-in-law who is African-American. He's been a Little League coach for years, worked dispatch with the police and everyone loves him, maybe because he's very respectful to everyone! And he doesn't yell "racist" or take a knee!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews Kneeling during the salute to the flag only says that these few do not appreciate what our flag stands for--an appreciation for the freedoms we ALL have only because of those who gave their lives to protect those freedoms. Show respect for your freedom and protest some other way!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews Many of these kids with police problems have never had a father figure in their lives to guide them &amp; to respect authority &amp; each other. Many raise themselves, join gangs &amp; look up to these NFL players as a father figure &amp; imitate what they see!  Some are good examples; some not!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews Cops in some areas are already standing down and letting the crazy mobs burn buildings, fight each other and whatever!  Is that your goal?  No cops?
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews Why are thousands of African-American kids killing each other in Chicago? Because of the cops? Why do people call the cops when they need help?  Because they are racists?  No!  Cops put their lives on the line daily to protect everyone!  What do they get in return? They get shot!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews But tell me how taking a knee is going to end police brutality? There will always be good cops and bad cops; just as there will be good kids and bad kids!  That does not mean they are all racist!  Throwing out "racist" everytime you don't like something solves nothing!
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews I was a teen in the 1960's and if you are referring to the Civil Rights Act, that was a good thing to end discrimination because in God's eyes all are created equal.
@Lisa_C714 @NBCNews You're dead wrong! It's attitudes like yours that automatically assume everyone is racist, except you! Those kids will go farther without bringing racism into their young lives; do good in high school to get scholarships to college; then the world is theirs to do whatever!!
@JamesACorder1 You're a doctor - a phycologist??  I think you're more in NEED of a Psycologist or Psychiatrist to try a little anger management, a mouth washing and treatment for Trump Derangement Syndrome!  Chill out doc!
@NBCNews Not a good idea kids!  You might get overlooked for a draft pick if they know you're already going to be a kneeler!  The major leagues have already lost millions over this, and I'm not sure they want to lose more!  Try a different way to get your point across!
@TIME When the @Time has to include articles by @EricHolder, it is desperate for content! The Republican Americans are taking back even more votes at this mid-term election! Remember Holder, when "Republicans go high," we go WAY HIGH to the finish line. And we do it with class!
@kenolin1 @BarackObama A message for everyone:	The people of all political parties were sick of @BarackObama!	The people spoke and the Obama/Clinton policies were out!	Voting brought Donald Trump in!  	Voting definitely matters and the Republicans will prevail again!!
@OfficeOfMike @SebGorka Watch how quickly @CoryBooker will revert back to the presumption that he's "innocent until proven guilty" although for the prestigious Justice Kavanaugh, it was "guilty without any evidence!" Wouldn't Booker &amp; Avenatti make a dandy pair to run in 2020 for Pres/VP? Yikes!!
@ProudResister The Democrat party has gone WAY too far left, embracing socialism, mob mentality, sanctuary cities for criminals, advocating for open borders to let in more criminals &amp; drug dealers so more of our loved ones can die from overdoses, illegals voting in U.S. elections and on and on!
@waltshaub "Evil" comes from people like you and your Democrat leftists that support sanctuary cities as a safe haven for criminals and mobs out creating terrorist attacks against law-abiding citizens!  THAT'S EVIL!!  Nikki has done a way better job than any of your Democrat male cohorts!!
on! https://t.co/cF2UOmCVzt
@RepAdamSchiff Leftist people like you irk me way more than Russian interference because of all the lying scare tactics you spew to try to swing a Democrat vote! You're the type dividing our nation and weakening our political system, but the good people of America can see through you!
@SethAbramson Sorry Seth!!  NOT TRUE!! 	More FAKE NEWS aka LIES!!
More lies from Shifty-Eyed Dem @RepAdamSchiff! https://t.co/tit5GwpvkL
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Just about all you and your crooked Dems have left to even attempt to beat @realDonaldTrump is to keep going on either CNN, MSNBC  or CBS to spread more FAKE NEWS!  You're starting to act like a Clinton wannabe!  It's either you or Clintons on the FAKE NEWS daily.  Boring!!
@KamalaHarris Don't forget all the illegal immigrants you Dems are signing up to try to win!  Lies, scare tactics, illegals voting, convicted criminals voting, mobs protesting, fighting, etc., and you're leading the way!  Dems are stooping from low to lower - anything to win!  Despicable!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump He hasn't changed the subject of health care. This is just more of your scare tactics!  You and Schumer are avoiding immigration, so that's why President Trump has to keep bringing it up.  You want open borders so illegal immigrants can vote Democrat.  That's your only hope!!
@MichaelAvenatti Avenatti, you're the one who is nothing but a bullying bag of hot air--all talk and no action! You're not even a decent lawyer that can backup your clients or their stories!  And you owe bills everywhere you go. Clean up your own back yard before you attempt to "restore" the USA!
@CBSNews NOT TRUE!  MORE FAKE NEWS!!  CBS News READ YOUR OWN ARTICLE as quoted per the Constitution: "So while only Congress can technically declare war, the president is in charge of the military - and can decide when and where it is deployed."	https://t.co/t10DPHHCth
This is insane! https://t.co/zRWFDPJXsc
@MichaelAvenatti @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump You ought to know about smartphones because your mug shot is everywhere - gives us all a laugh because we know you really think you are capable of becoming President!  First of all, you're not smart enough; and second, Trump would tromp you in the first round!!
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Pres. Trump can't back it up? Like you really backed up Dr. Horn with a phony  witness who was such a joke! And now your playgirl Stormy owes Pres. Trump $130,000. You really know how to back 'em up! Why don't you brag about all the lawsuits pending against you! You're a phony!
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Start impeachment proceedings again and hopefully right now you can get the vote to get it done.  Then he'll be more than happy to talk and provide the papers you've requested over &amp; over.  Of course when he does that, it will come out that he's at the bottom of the whole scam!
@KamalaHarris Just another one of your lying scare tactics, along with the other hundreds you've told!!  Try the truth sometime!!
@NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette This is just another one of your scare tactics because you have nothing positive that the Democrats can run on!! You want to take away the "crumbs" given to the working class &amp; you want open borders so we can have more drugs and criminals pouring in.  But what do you care?
@BernieSanders No it shouldn't!  Period!!
@PressSec Tell me it's not true!!  UGH!  We had enough of @HillaryClinton!!
@BrianKempGA @DonaldJTrumpJr @staceyabrams is the type of person that gives African-Americans a really bad name!  If you can't at least be honest with your people, then get out and let the Georgians elect someone they can trust and be proud of!!
@englishpen @Acosta @PENamerican @guardian President Trump is NOT calling for Republicans to go get in Democrats faces like a bunch of evil mob monsters, etc. etc. etc. He's just telling it like it is--FAKE news--and we all know it. When bullies like you can't get your way, Trump is either a racist or you file a lawsuit!
@BernieSanders Bernie, you're going to see the largest Republican voter turnout in our history this year!  Get your big man Kleenex ready!!
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams Tell Juan @TheJuanWilliams to have his antidepressants and big man Kleenex ready!  😂
@BernieSanders @LizForIndiana So what are you proposing, Bernie?  That the state enroll all criminals into the University, instead of enrolling them into a prison because it's cheaper?  Your ideas get crazier by the day!!
@JeffFlake Not everybody is afraid of Soros-paid women or media who get in their face like you are Jeff!  You weren't there when the body slamming happened, if that's what really happened, so stop with your judgmental ways!  Get on back to Snowflake, Az where you came from--soon!
@NYGovCuomo Why should U.S. taxpayer funds be used for NY train tunnels?  You're the governor, so solve your own state's problems; up the tax of the people who use the trains!!  But of course if you do that you won't be governor for long!
@SenGillibrand No, I want to see a petition to recall you!!
@Acosta Jim, why does a nice looking fellow like you spread fake news &amp; yell questions at inappropriate times, seemingly to bring attention to yourself? Get out of CNN, get into a decent news media, clean up your act and you could soar to the top!  The truth will set you free!
@JordanSekulow Jordan, thank you for all the work you do through ACLJ.  God bless you and one day you will be rewarded in heaven!
@kurtyw @Acosta My brain cells??  You're the one calling yourself "Shallow."  😊
@montysport01 @Acosta Huh?  I THINK you are asking if I'm still going to President Trump's rallies.  I haven't had the opportunity, but my friend did and she brought me back a pink poster that says "Women For Trump" and I love it!
@kurtyw @Acosta What's your point, Shallow?  Heck, maybe you didn't know it's 2018!  If that's true, I apologize if my tweet offended you!  Have a lovely evening.
@Acosta Really?? It's really 2018?   We wouldn't have known that without your tweet!  You must be the keeper of the calendar for CNN.  Thanks so much!
@RichardHaass The whole premise of the Council on Foreign Relations is to bring down the United States in order to form a one-world government.  As long as @realDonaldTrump remains in office promoting #AmericaFirst and closing the border, that interferes with your globalist agenda.
@RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump President Trump hasn't looked away, so stop making up fake news!  You need a job at CNN where you would fit right in!!
@beach_coby @IVT2020 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne Just be sure you have your antidepressants ready before Nov. 7th!  😊
@BernieSanders I don't see you and your Dem cohorts doing anything except voting "no" on anything positive!  You have no platform of great or even good ideas, so all you have left is untrue scare tactics.  People with common sense, Democrat or Republican, don't buy anything you have to say!
@chuckwoolery Better watch how you tweet things, because when I first read your tweet, I thought you hated Ted Cruz.  So I had to pull up your whole tweet to realize you were just quoting a story line. 😊
@antjuansea LOL  You won't need an eye exam, you'll need some antidepressants!!  But blessings to you until then and keep reading your Bible for enlightenment.  "The truth will set you free."  😉
@antjuansea You'll see "red" as the blue fades away!!
@beach_coby @IVT2020 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne What America remembers is Obama's health insurance promise, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor," the biggest lie to go down in history, and we didn't need a fact checker to know that was a lie.  People who still believe that one are really gullible! Love FOX news!
@beach_coby @IVT2020 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne Yeah, and for your Obama Health Insurance, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor," is the biggest lie to go down history and we didn't have to go to fact checkers to find out the truth.  That's gullible!  We'll chat again after the red election.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Michael, you and Hillary really need to go away!! It's so obvious that you both just can't stand losing to @realDonaldTrump!! Accept it and move on! Better yet, turn your life around!  It's never too late. Try reading a Bible and praying and you'll find your true purpose in life.
Arizona welcomes President Trump at this Friday's rally.  There will be mega numbers of people in attendance because Arizona loves the Prez!!  #VoteRepublican https://t.co/VcxZUV8VrB
@beach_coby @IVT2020 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne Neither was I because Obama couldn't begin to qualify as the best president or really the best of anything except perhaps the best &amp; biggest liar to the American people!! It is President Trump that is #MAGA!    Get on the #TrumpTrain.
@HillaryClinton Hillary, you are so pitiful, hon. Maybe you should move to Hollywood among the stars, whose jobs are to pretend being someone else. You too could try being someone else, get a new life, walk along the beach instead of in the woods and who knows, you might finally win something!
@robreiner Rob, you've been around Hollywood too long and it's fried your brain!!  You were a meathead in the 1970's and you still are!  Such a shame!
@beach_coby @IVT2020 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne Micrazy, you forgot the most important one of all - BEST PRESIDENT EVER!  😀
@RabbiShmuley The Connors show was also disgusting and will die a quick death!  It's a big 'nothing' without Roseanne!
@LouisFarrakhan You're certainly no minister!!  Based on the evil, vile words you spew, you're more like 99.9% demonic!!  God have mercy on your day of judgment!
@realDonaldTrump This is too fun not to retweet.  Priceless indeed!  😀 #MAGA https://t.co/qXNiJM9kBW
This is absolutely amazing! https://t.co/y68oYqrI70
Get everyone out to vote Republican to stop the evil that wants to overtake our country! https://t.co/EGWhS0t0qr
@jimgeraghty I wonder if Fordham Law Review will issue a retraction?
@SenSanders Bernie, you are so far out, you're beyond being rational about health care!  How do you plan on paying for putting everybody on Medicare??  We don't need your socialism rhetoric &amp; lies! 		We'll stick with President Trumps plan -- it's working great!!
@KamalaHarris Justice Kavanaugh "hysterical?" Kamala, you and your Democrat cohorts are the hysterical drama queens!!  You're sermon should be to encourage all survivors to report these incidents immediately so they can be documented and investigated!  You don't wait for 36 years to speak up!
@Jim_Jordan What is it going to take for you House members to go for impeachment of Rosenstein for withholding this evidence? He'll hold out as long as possible to keep it from being revealed that he's at the bottom of this whole mess!
@SenSanders Well Bernie, it looks like you'll be getting out of politics real soon if you practice what you preach!  Every U. S. citizen should take advantage of our privilege to vote.  The key words are "U.S. CITIZENS," NOT all the illegals you Democrats want to flock into our country!!
@SenFeinstein If you don't like it, then stop going on recesses every other month!!  And while you are in session, try getting something done instead of wasting all your time trying to buck the President!! What a novel idea to have you Democrats actually do something positive for the country!!
@SenSanders Bernie, you forgot to mention all the people, especially Canadians, who flock to the U.S. to get medical treatment!  Spend a day at Mayo Clinic and see how many are from Canada because their health care is so bad!  Stop lying, Bernie, because you are dead wrong, AGAIN!!
@RealJamesWoods @RJT_Anim @realDonaldTrump POTUS should authorize a plane to load them up and fly them back to Honduras!  Sweet and simple!  That will at least give the Dems a new gripe and it will be a whole lot cheaper for the American taxpayers!  #SendThemHome
@RepRaulGrijalva Your statement is absolutely not true!!  The people along the border will be looking forward to a full night of restful sleep!!  You're just a bunch of hot air, spewing out untruths!
@NancyPelosi @92YOnDemand Nancy, I think your first agenda item should be to start telling the truth!!  #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp
@KamalaHarris @RubenGallego Sorry to burst your bubble, but the Republicans are even more fired up to vote to defeat the likes of Democrats like you!
@RepMaxineWaters Maxine, have YOU sought treatment for alcohol or drug abuse? I ask because your behavior is so erratic--like that of an abuser of alcohol, drugs and people! You need a lot of help! The anger that spews out of your mouth is so ugly, it might be good for you to get mental help too!
@RepMaxineWaters Maxine: Do you even understand the big word "impeachment" and have you even read the constitution?  President Trump will NOT be impeached, so accept it!! You've made enough money off the backs of the taxpayers, so it's time for you to move on out!!!  #DrainTheSwamp!!
@BernieSanders The TRUTH is that we must all take a stand and FIGHT against the lie that you are promoting called Socialism!!  You must reside in one crazy area for people to keep voting you into office!!
@SenSanders Bernie, those who can't win without allowing illegals to vote or who have people voting twice or voting for deceased people are even bigger cowards!!  It's those cheating people as well as those with extreme, radical ideas like yours that need to get the hell out of politics!!
@FAIRImmigration @cnsnews You're for securing the border until it's time to fund the wall!  You're such a joke!! #BuildThatWall
@SenFeinstein It's about time you did something decent!!  You should spend more of your time doing similar projects to keep yourself busy!!
@SenSanders With voting by mail now, there is no excuse for not voting.  We don't need another national holiday, nor do we need your crazy, radical ideas to screw up our great nation, Bernie!!  Go retire or take a long vacation!
@NancyPelosi YOU are the corruption in DC and the sooner you are gone, the better off our country will be!!  Honesty??  Nothing that comes out of your mouth is honest!!  You are very sad &amp; pathetic!!   #DrainTheSwamp
@RevJJackson What's really sad is people like you using the title of Reverend and doing NOTHING to help the black youth killing each other.  You have no business using reverend as your title when you are a complete fraud! Start reading your Bible and praying before you meet your Master!
@TheRevAl Ha!  You haven't learned anything--you're still making loud noises, but not much sense--just a bunch of nonsense! You're what they call a hypocrite!
@TheRevAl  It galls me to see a person like you use the title of Reverend. You're no reverend with the vile words that spew out of your mouth. You better get back to your Bible and prayer before you meet your Master and have to answer for your evil words and deeds over the years!
@robertjeffress Have you ever wondered what Jesus would say if he was a Tweeter?  Might make a good sermon.  It would definitely be about love.
@JeffFlake I want to thank you for your PROMISE TO VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH for the Supreme Court.  Do not let the mob crumble you again; remember the two actors who confronted you were paid for by Soros-funded orgs.  		Vote Kavanaugh and then get the heck out of town!  😅
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity President Trump:  Arizona really needs your help!  If this crook runs, God help us all! https://t.co/r50Kgkeuk5
@realDonaldTrump You weren't the only one wondering!  There are others as well! https://t.co/mAauIdtJGv
@greggutfeld @IngrahamAngle Greg, you are priceless with your tweets and love your off-the-cuff comments on your show.  Keep them coming because you are a breath of fresh air amongst all the crazyness!
@marcorubio @SebGorka @SenatorCollins She must be extremely careful!  May I add that she spoke with such eloquence &amp; grace, but only after having done extensive research into all the issues and argued with reason. What a role model and such a breath of fresh air after all the vicious, demeaning, vile, evil Dem drama!
@BernieSanders Bernie, that Hawaiian Senator was talking to old men like you when she said to "Just shut up and do the right thing."  The right thing would be for you to take a nice long nap, chill out, have some tea, go for a walk and stay off television and Twitter!  You had your day &amp; lost!
@ShannonBream Too late!  They had 36+ years to come forward!
@SenFeinstein That would make millions of people happy, just not you corrupt Democrats who have no conscience!  You sold your soul out to political gain, monetary gain &amp; personal gain, but one day you will answer to God for why you have the blood of millions of  aborted babies on your hands!
@keanothedog @realDonaldTrump You're one real sicko!!  Pretty sad human being!  Mama must be really proud of you!
@anea194 @realDonaldTrump What a potty mouth!  Clean yourself up so your mom or somebody can be proud of you!!
@Blueseros @realDonaldTrump Some of you Democrats spew nothing but hatred!  If you would get a real genuine life, you might find some sense of happiness.  Try reading a Bible followed by prayer and you'll get a whole new perspective on life filled with meaning, not hatred.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Some of you Democrats spew nothing but hatred!  If you would get a real genuine life, you might find some sense of happiness.  Try reading a Bible followed by prayer and you'll get a whole new perspective on life filled with meaning, not hatred.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Some of you Democrats spew nothing but hatred!  If you would get a real genuine life, you might find some sense of happiness.  Try reading a Bible followed by prayer and you'll get a whole new perspective on life filled with meaning, not hatred.
@SenTedCruz Why don't you propose legislation to eliminate anyone being in the halls of the Senate &amp; House?  And the whole Capitol should be restricted to only those that have a paid ticket for tours conducted by Capitol police. It's sad, but these mobs need to be stopped!
@lisamurkowski You abandoned the truth, your Party,  and participated in trying to destroy a man of the stature of Judge Kavanaugh.  But be wary because what goes around comes around and the Dems will turn on you in a minute until the day the Alaskans vote you out of office!
@lisamurkowski I'm amazed that you couldn't see through the woman's story, no details except she had one beer, uncorroborated witnesses, the lie about flying, the lie about double doors, the baby voice at the proper time, her face looking down when answering questions she wasn't prepared for?
@JudicialWatch I just admire your organization so much for constantly seeking for the truth and making people accountable.  Thank you.
@BrettKavanaugh @DanBonginoknows I think Judge Kavanaugh should sue them all--Senators, news media &amp; false witnesses--for defamation to clear his name and send a message.  Listen to the attorney discuss this on Fox News.
@NancyPelosi @RepJerryNadler When some of the likes of you, Shumer, Nadler, Harris, Booker &amp; Hirono vacate the Senate, the swamp will be much cleaner and maybe some truth will prevail!!  You're all such evil, lying drama queens out for yourselves, power and getting rich off the taxpayers backs. Nothing else!
@SenBooker @CoryBooker The woman not only misled, but lied also while under oath about her witnesses, her fear of flying, her medical notes, her double doors, etc., which disqualified her from being a valid person of sexual assualt.  She was simply a pawn to the Democrats for political purposes.
@BuckSexton Both of the above as well as a drama queen!
@KamalaHarris I agree, but if these women truly experiencing any type of assault against them don't start reporting it to the authories, it will never stop.  That's the lesson that needs to be taught, not just "Me Too."
@SenSanders Thank the Lord that you nor Hillary are the President of the U.S.!  You are not worthy of that position when you lie to the people all the time about the greatness of Socialism.  That's the sign of a warped mind!  		On the other hand, Judge Kavanaugh will be GREAT!
@NancyPelosi It depends on if the woman is telling the truth. You ought to try it sometime and you might get some respect.  In the meantime, you are just a joke and the reason for many of the problems facing our nation!  Your lies!!  A sorry person indeed and a pathetic role model for others!
@dbongino No, they live on taxpayer-funded free food stamps, rent, utilities, phones, etc. and the others are paid for by Soros funded groups and they admit it!  They have no shame!
@SenFeinstein No, you are the one that concerns me--the underhanded, dishonest Senator that hides information, leaks information, uses supposedly assaulted people for your own political gain and then plays the "who me?" ploy. You are one of the people creating all the problems in our nation!
@KamalaHarris No, you were all about trying to regain some power and went about it in the most despicable, ugly, evil &amp; dishonest way. You should take a lesson from Senator Collins, as she spent a lot of time in search of the truth and remained a lady in the process.  The truth prevailed!
@KamalaHarris It's mean?? Go back and watch the recording of you questioning Judge Kavanaugh!The look of hatred and your cocky, demeaning attitude was the most despicable display of bullying and pure meanness I have ever witnessed against a man that you couldn't begin to match in intelligence!
@senorrinhatch Some of these Senate Dimms don't understand shame!  These people have no soul, conscience, thought processes or anything else.  They are just moving through life with a blind hatred parading before the world seeking personal attention.  Very pathetic!
@RealCandaceO I think there are millions of us who happen to agree with you!  Keep up your great work!  Dare to be different -- a leader, not a follower!
@AllenFrancesMD I think perhaps YOU might have him beat!!  I happen to think he's the best!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @WhoopiGoldberg Whoopi has needed help for YEARS! Perhaps she should seek help from Dr. Horn because as a psychologist her job is to help people with mental health issues, such as Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Perhaps Joy Behar can go with her, although I believe she is beyond help.
@Alyssa_Milano No wonder you are so messed up.  You should go get some help from Dr. Horn.  As  a psychologist, she specializes in helping pathetic people like you.  It's too bad what aging does to some people.  Sad....
@NancyPelosi I am so sick of your self-righteous attitude!  You think Judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being a Supreme Court Judge or at his present judicial position, well YOU are not worthy of being in Congress or in our country!  You're nothing but a polished LIAR!!
@Sen_JoeManchin Of course you support Flake because you're nothing more than one of the puppets following along with the evil leftist Democrats!  Reflect on your life and realize how low you've stooped from your roots.  Be a leader and not a follower and do the right thing for @Judge_Kavanaugh.
@benshapiro @SaraCarterDC Also what a "FLAKE!"  He sold  out Arizona a long time ago and now  the entire country.  Arizona is so looking forward to him being gone, but not soon enough!    DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
@SenBlumenthal Your whole agenda is about Roe vs Wade.  I want to be there when you stand before God on judgment day and explain to him why you supported the murder of millions of babies, when his commandment says, "Thou shall not murder."
@dbongino @JeffFlake Flake will never have to work again.  He's spent his whole life profiting quite nicely off the backs of the American taxpayers.  He sold out Arizona a long time ago until Arizonians finally said "NO MORE" and are looking forward to his departure from the Senate.
@KamalaHarris YOU are the evil sham and the American people do deserve MUCH better!  You, Blumenthal &amp; Booker should move on to Hollywood and audition for a role there.  You would fit right in with all the other phony drama queens!!  DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
@MadDawgUSA1 @SebGorka Don't forget Diane Feinstein, Joy Behar and Whoopie Goldberg! #ConfirmKavanaughNow  #HimToo
@JeffFlake If you can walk up to Judge Kavanaugh, look him in the eye and call him a liar after all the testimony today, or lack thereof, and refuse to vote for a man of his character, then you are NOT a true LDS Mormon according to the principals of your faith! Stand up for what's right!
@RealCandaceO Double amen!  God will  have no mercy on the day of judgment!  And some of these older Democrats could be facing their eternal judgment soon.  Such a shame how people start out okay and how low they stoop toward the end of their life's journey all out of hatred, evil and greed.
@pattonoswalt @MeTooMVMT @domesticworkers @RAINN @endrapeoncampus @BeAHeroTeam Support women?  I will when it's your turn for feminist allegations against you.  What a potty mouth.  I bet your mom is real proud!!
@charliekirk11 They can always line up to get help from Psychologist, Dr. Horn!
@DavidLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump They can all line up to be treated by Psychologist, Dr. Horn.
@LindseyGrahamSC You were the shining light in a dark room today!  Thank you for finally--a man who stood up against pure evil. As suggested by Newt Gingrich, why don't you Republicans file an ethics complaint against Diane Feinstein and her staff for hiding evidence, etc.
@kathygriffin Honey, nothing would help you--not even a ball gown!!
@KamalaHarris Enough of your phony drama is enough too!!  You were at that hearing just to be heard, not to listen or to ask any sensible questions.  It was all about you!!!
@SenSanders I listened too and I totally believe Judge Kavanaugh!  That pathetic woman is delusional!  I further believe that you should never be President with you &amp; your crazy ideas.  You're as looney as she is!
@DavidLimbaugh @JeffFlake Absolutely nothing.  He's Arizona's dud! If he votes against the Judge, he won't be able to get out of Washington and Arizona fast enough!!  Maybe there is hope as he's a Mormon who says he believes in God so maybe the Judge's swearing his truth before God might help!
@KamalaHarris He's already had 6 FBI investigations! Why would anyone with a sound mind ask for another one?  Are you insinuating that the FBI is derelict in its duties &amp; might get the 7th one right? You leftist Democrat senators sounded like a broken record looking for a way to stall a vote!!
@KamalaHarris No, she is sitting there because's she's either a woman scorned by Judge Kavanaugh in their teen days because he blew off her interest in him, or there's some monetary value forthcoming, probably from Soros, or she's one of those crazy lefties that has Trump Derangement Syndrome.
@KamalaHarris Someone telling the truth would be pretty stupid to go ask for a polygraph test--"Tell me test if I'm telling the truth?" But, perhaps someone who is not sure if their story will pass muster before going public, would definitely need to go get a polygraph test done first.
@SenFeinstein Feinstein is the one abusing her power!  Do you have no shame to have reduced yourself to such low levels, particularly at the END of your tenure in office?  Vote Feinstein out; vote Kavanaugh in!
@JeffFlake If you let these Dems continue to make the rules for these judicial confirmation hearings, they will use these scams so no one of any caliber can ever be confirmed.  Instead of shutting up, it's time to stand your ground and SPEAK UP!
@AllenFrancesMD GOP state gov't??  Waterkeeper Alliance attorney Will Hendrick told the HuffPost, “This industry (hog farmers) has shown its vulnerabilities in terms of these weather events FOR DECADES and has still resisted the need for change.” Why didn't Clinton &amp; Obama's EPA do something?
