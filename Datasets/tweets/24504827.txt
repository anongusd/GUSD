@RedHatty_Social @LastWheatPenny @DLoesch Do u really think God would give u the right to kill masses of people?  It's not your "God given right."
@LastWheatPenny That doesn't make sense. Australia had lax gun laws when they had a maniac gun down a bunch of people. That incident made them put strict gun regulations in place, and now gun incidents have dropped, if not been eliminated.
@cherokeesher2 @goingglocal I agree, except I don't think Trump's coziness with the Saudis is about what's best for our country--I think it's about his personal interests. If he cared what was in America's best interest, he wouldn't be cozy with Putin.
