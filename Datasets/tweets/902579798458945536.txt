Very humbling to see and hear of people giving back to help those affected by Harvey, one day I may do the same. Stay strong TX and LA!!
Let me just say this; my second day on Twitter I am learning a lot, I am especially moved by what is being done to help those in TX and LA.
Let me begin by offering continued thoughts and prayers for the people of Texas after hurricane Harvey....
