Now we‚Äôre getting to long rumored tape of Trump hitting Melania in an elevator. Cohen says he doesn‚Äôt think that tape exists. He doesn‚Äôt believe it ever happened. In his opinion, he says Trump wouldn‚Äôt do that.
Did you meet with any Russians in Europe? Cohen: No.
Cohen: Felix Sater offered a TT Moscow Condo to Putin. It was a marketing stunt.
FINALLY! Have you ever been to Prague? Cohen: No.
Meanwhile at 30 Rock https://t.co/gAs0mFLtcq
Cohen: Trump speaks in code. I speak his code and those around him do, too.
Congressman Raskin: Republicans aren‚Äôt mad you lied for President Trump. They‚Äôre mad you stopped lying for president Trump.
Cohen says he did not want to go to the White House. Note: Among Trump‚Äôs orbit it was always widely believed that he did in fact want a gig there. But again, Cohen is denying this right now.
Both @glennkirschner2 and @Mimirocah1 say this could necessitate an interview with Sekulow about whether this was witness tampering.
Cohen says this meeting happened in the Oval.
Cohen says he had a conversation with Trump (Sekulow was there) before his congressional testimony the first time around (when he lied about TT Moscow). He says Trump told him to say there was no collusion. Cohen says he took that to mean to lie to congress.
Cohen: Not one Republican on this committee has so far asked me about President Trump.

@JakeSherman Tell me you‚Äôre joking.
I need the coffee Jim Jordan drinks.
Congressman Lynch: How did Trump direct TT Moscow negotiations during campaign? Cohen: I would report back to him.

Endorse https://t.co/UX47X6P1VG
Cohen has already suggested Alan Weisselberg, Alan Garten, and more as potential witnesses from Trump Org. (Yes, I use Oxford commas.)
Side note from the legal analysts in @Msnbc studio right now: Cohen can be helpful in suggesting what other witnesses the Cmmte should call. Folks who might have been in the room with Cohen during key moments or folks Cohen might have spoken with after meetings w Trump etc.
Now we‚Äôre on a side road talking about Cohen‚Äôs contracts with big companies for advice after Trump was elected.
Cohen: Ask Miss Patton how many African Americans are executives at the Trump Org. 		Note: Cohen was the head of Trump‚Äôs Diversity Council. He repeatedly tried to get Trump to events with African American pastors during the campaign.
Meadows brought Lynn Patton, she‚Äôs standing behind him right now. Meadows says Patton says she‚Äôd never serve a racist. Cohen: Neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor.
RT @DustinGiebel: There‚Äôs always a tweet: Cohen‚Äôs testimony edition https://t.co/71evsrzSEj
Cohen now getting heated with Jim Jordan. He says he‚Äôs taking responsibility for what he did wrong. ‚ÄúShame on you Mr Jordan.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am going to prison.‚Äù 		Note: Cohen‚Äôs temper could be a wild card.
Congressman Comer: You called Trump a cheat. What would you call yourself? Cohen: A fool.
Cohen now describing ‚Äúcatch and kills‚Äù and says agreements between Pecker and Trump existed long before Cohen started working for him.
Congresswoman Maloney: Before you had a meeting with anyone of any consequence did you have to ask Trump? Cohen: Yes. Maloney: Did you have to report back? Cohen: Yes.
Green: No one can believe this guy. He will say whatever he wants. He is a fake witness.
Congressman Green: Cohen is a scorned man.
Cohen: Trump Tower Moscow was ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù because Trump didn‚Äôt expect to win.
Cohen: ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs desire to win would have him work with anyone.‚Äù
DWS: how do we know you‚Äôre telling the truth about the Stone/ Trump convo? Corroborating evidence? 	Cohen: I suspect special counsel office and other govt agencies might have the info you‚Äôre seeking.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz asks about DNC hack (personal for her). Cohen says he didn‚Äôt know what specific emails would be released, only that there would be a dump per the convo he overheard bw Stone and Trump.
Jordan says Cohen is just like McCabe and Comey who are upset about being fired.
Jordan says Cohen is upset he didn‚Äôt get a job at the WH. Cohen says he did not. He saw how he treated his WH staff and he was very proud to serve as the President‚Äôs personal attorney.
Jordan: did the Women for Cohen twitter account help Trump or you? Cohen: it didn‚Äôt help me. It was for fun.
Note on this: wIkileaks DNC email dump started on 7/22/16
Cummings: You‚Äôre saying Trump, while he was President, was cutting you a check for reimburse you for hush money payments? Cohen: yes. Cummings: did Trump know what it was for? Cohen: Yes. I have no doubt.
NOTES:	1. Cohen can‚Äôt technically get a reduced sentence for testifying TODAY per legal analysts who cite Rule 35. (Technically is operable word, here)	2. Cohen has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. If he lies AGAIN today that could put him in MORE legal trouble.
Again Cohen admits he has no direct proof of collusion but he is now detailing a moment in Trump‚Äôs office where he believes Don Jr was telling Trump about the June 2016 TT meeting with Russians offering direct on Hillary Clinton. (Still, Cohen is not offering proof of this.)
Cohen alleges Trump was lying about the bone spur diagnosis that kept him out of Vietnam. Cohen says Trump told him, ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm stupid, I wasn‚Äôt going to vietnam.‚Äù 		Cohen just now: ‚ÄúI find it Ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.
The corroborating evidence Cohen DOES offer includes checks made out to him from Trump, Don Jr, and Alan Weisselberg, to reimburse him for the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.
**BUT** Cohen offers no corroborating evidence to prove this is true. In fact later on in his statement, he says flat out he DOES NOT have direct evidence Trump or the campaign colluded with Russia. ‚ÄúBut, I have my suspicions.‚Äù
If true, this would mean he know about the Wikileaks dump before he called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails on July 27, 2016, which was in the middle of the DNC. Transcript: https://t.co/qBPzFspEf1
Cohen on Wikileaks: https://t.co/YRT7mtf0Vd
Cohen: ‚Äúlying for Mr Trump was normalized and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either.‚Äù
Cohen: The campaign for him (Trump) was alaways a marketing opportunity.
Side note: @SRuhle just banished @Mimirocah1‚Äôs red pen from the studio.  Apparently they are bad luck. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôll never see one at a bank,‚Äù she says. #themoreyouknow üåà

The SDNY‚Äôs charging document (which was scathing) will be quoted heavily by the GOP today.
Jordan: immediately tries to shame Cummings and Dems for calling Cohen, who he calls a convicted liar, as its first witness for the 116th congress.
Cummings: because Cohen addressed Russia in his opening statement, Russia is back on the table for questioning.

Its why so many of those buildings have brass polished to look like gold.		Image is everything.		He wants to appear strong.
Remember, Donald Trump's whole life has been about creating an image of success. Image matters more than anything else.		Trump hasn't built buildings in a long time. He puts his name on them. He brands them. Its the image he sells.
It could shatter the "powerful, strong" image he was creating for himself. Wipe away the illusion.
I reported a couple days earlier that he protesters caused him to abruptly end his speech in Raleigh, NC.		For a man who had been mocking Bernie Sanders for letting BLM protesters take over his mic, calling him weak and unfit to lead, my reporting was political kryptonite
I'm asked why the President was so furious with me in December 2015. Why did he call for my firing? Why did he point me out in a crowd and indirectly endanger my safety? Why did he boycott NBC after that?		Because he thought I made him look weak.
He believes these issues make him look strong, tough.		He believes that because he got loud roars for it during the election even as he was being condemned by dems and republicans. The crowds still cheered. So he went as far as he could.
This is part of why we've seen him consistently take the hardest line position on any issue.		Terrorism: We should kill the families of Terrorists.	Abortion: Women should be punished.	Immigration: Build a wall, separate families	Muslims: Ban them all	etc etc
There is nothing POTUS is more afraid of than looking weak:		TRUMP: if you‚Äôre really, really pathetically weak, the country is going to be overrun with millions of people and if you‚Äôre strong, then you don‚Äôt have any heart. That‚Äôs a tough dilemma. Perhaps I‚Äôd rather be strong ..

. @PeterAlexander reports Trump actually said "you figure that one out" when asked if he still had confidence in Dep AG Rosenstein.		Remember Rosenstein is in charge of Mueller investigation. Also Remember Trump appointed Rosenstein. https://t.co/8QkK2OOE77

Unlike WH and GOP (who released memo selectively to friendly outlets first), DOJ says when and if they have a statement it will go out to everyone at the same time.
Reminder --- IC concluded Russia meddled in our 2016 election and will do it again. So far little to nothing has been done to protect the sovereignty of our elections.

No redactions per WH.		Questions now:  	1. Does FBI respond?	2. How?	3. What does Dir Wray do? https://t.co/PucFTFFlmf
