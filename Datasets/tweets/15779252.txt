@divalicias @HillaryClinton Your status as female does not give you the right to lecture other females about their voting record.
@divalicias @HillaryClinton LMAO!   Are you serious?  Bye Felicia.
@bell96 @HillaryClinton Agreed.   The right women.  For me, she is not the right woman.  For you, she is.
@divalicias @HillaryClinton Yes.  I am a woman.  But surely you are intelligent enough to know that all women are NOT the same, right?
@bell96 @HillaryClinton Aww.   That's a shame. My years in business have taught me:  My opinion is my opinion &amp; you don't have to agree.
@divalicias @HillaryClinton I'm not sure what "us" you speak of because she does not represent me.
@divalicias @HillaryClinton When we get more progressive women, that would be great!  I would absolutely love that.  :-)
@bell96 @HillaryClinton **eye rolling**
@divalicias @HillaryClinton But THAT is not what she implied.  She just WANTS to BE the first woman president.
@nrdavis That's NOT how she EVER presents.  SHE said it as if the FACT that she's a woman means she'll be a BETTER president.
I'm so tired of @HillaryClinton and this '1st woman president' stuff.  AS IF her genitalia gives her super powers. #DemDebate

@TBoard I know you didn't publish it.  I'm always leery of research like that.  You control the findings by controlling the sample.
@TBoard @BI_contributors Posting research findings without telling us what the sample size looked like is a bit irresponsible.

Best performance so far: #KatyPerry #Grammys2014

A 2-run home run for, wait for it . . .  #RickieWeeks.  Whaaaaat? #Brewers
8 (#Athletics) 0 (#Brewers).  This game is painful to watch.
Other than being huge #Brewers fans, I'm not sure WHY we're watching tonight's game.  Geezus!
Last place in our division?  #Brewers have got to do better.  Being worse than the #Cubs is embarrassing.
OK.  I can no longer call #LoganSchafer the Forrest Gump of Baseball.   #Brewers

@rushay I use my Gmail box like a cloud server.  So I'll likely just use the Google Drive if I need to move things over to save them.
@debontherocks Thanks for the tip.  That helped!  I did the search and it helped me clear out a lot.
@rushay It's 10GB but if I don't pay attention, I could be out of space in no time!
@debontherocks That's what I'm wondering.  If I have some huge files in my inbox somewhere.
My Gmail box was 46% full.  Deleted 4000 emails from Twitter.  3000 from Facebook.  5000 from HARO.  My box is now 42% full. WTH?

Ugh!  #Twins win it in the 15tth inning.  No, I don't need to see the game summary!
Good work by the #Brewers on that third base rundown. #MLB
Tis the season of extra innings.  Inning 15!  #Brewers #Twins #MLB
Damn, that was close. Into the 13th inning.  #Brewers #Twins  #MLB
I'm a huge #Brewers fan, but I have to follow @TimLincecum 'cuz he's PURRTY. #Giants #MLB
These tie games that go into extra innings are always fun to watch. #Brewers #Twins #MLB
12 innings.  Go #Brewers!

Never, never mix the personal and professional. Donate a kidney to your boss, then you get fired. Screw that @Anderson!
Ooooh. I get to learn more about the Amish on @Anderson - How exciting.
Send us your #pride pictures. We want to feature them on Facebook. sisterstalkradio@gmail.com #lgbt #sisterstalkradio
@berlyann30  Do you think that's really why the wife won the lawsuit?  Because it was a COP who died having a threesome?  Ha!
@berlyann30 NO WAY!  That guy was a cop? That information was left out of the story I read.
Does @JustinBieber actually use the word #Belieber? #Narcissistic much?

@Anderson I would love to see a show about women who have multiple husbands. #girlpower
Watching @Anderson. Straight women conned into this #SisterWives crap. Ask for an extra husband &amp; see what your 1st hubby says.
@berlyann30 You can have that t-shirt.  She THINKS she's cute wearing it.  Hmpf! (@AndreaKStevens )
Weighing the pros and cons of moving my office to a new location.

Ok, so the key to #Brewers success is for Brewers team members to outperform @RyanBraun. It gets his ass in gear.
