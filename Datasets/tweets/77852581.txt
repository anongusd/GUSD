@MaurizioTweets @SaysSimonson What? Killing an 8 month old baby is very illegal and no one‚Äôs tax dollars are paying for that
@SaysSimonson Right. If Planned Parenthood took money to stop providing abortions, they‚Äôd be selling out low-income and rural women who would then have their access to the procedure decimated.
@SaysSimonson Not going to debate fungibility with you on twitter. If you‚Äôre so opposed to reproductive rights that you‚Äôre fine with other family planning services being defunded, ok then! But your original point that my tweet was untrue was wrong.
@SaysSimonson Such a tired talking point. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. https://t.co/TEC6kNoMoQ
@SaysSimonson Title X money already can‚Äôt pay for abortion. It pays for other family planning services. Those services, not the abortions, are what will be impacted by this rule.
@SaysSimonson My tweet did not say ‚Äúall‚Äù doctors, and it links to my story, which fully explains the rule and its impact.
@SaysSimonson ...in fact it does. It would take Title X money away from providers who were using that money for STD testing and treatment, contraception and cancer screenings.
