@Kathlee57006424 @Caro7Joe54 They bring third world country disease. That just one danger others are human trafficking and drugs and doesn't death to thousands of Americans every year. Stop it now build the damn wall. Protect this country. Do your job democrats and republicans or get the hell out of govt.
We need to remind people that the democrats are the party of slavery. The Jim Crowe laws. And the K.K.K. why is this overlooked by the people of this country. Walk away the liberals want to enslave us all. Make us depend on the govt. No Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!
@catturd2 @PorholaBless Head scratcher indeed Obama used it 13 times not a peep from either side pretty much. Rand the democrats will try using it for circumventing the constitution weather pres. TRUMP uses it or not. Courts will back him. He's doing his job. Don't understand your logic here
@bud_cann Knew all his skeletons would be on public display. That's ok we're still coming for your corrupt lying ass.

@boxersforlife @KAG4All Liberal heads explode again after 2020 election.
Bullshit polls showing up again on Msm outlets. The only polls that matter are election results after 2020. Hildebeast found that out first hand. Ignore all polls and don't answer polls. They can be easily manipulated
Under no circumstances does the Isis bride return. What the hell we now are going to let known terrorists return to our country. This is utter madness
@hrtablaze How naive. The president only job is to protect this country from enemies. By building the wall that's what he's doing. The supreme court would only block if he's trying to circumvent the constitution he's not. Wake up Rand. Your not thinking straight

When  congress comes to the president with a new spending bill. It's time to say hell no and shut down the govt
@drawandstrike @c_wieck I will give it a shadow of a doubt right now I know our president is not stupid. Let's see how this thing with Sessions plays out.
@RealJamesWoods Still crying over the fact that their rhino candidates lost in the primary. The republicans are as much the swamp as the democrats. For the most part we can't trust hardly any politicians. And we have a pres who doesn't care about parties. He cares about making America great agai
@SPTrmp @45IsMyGuy2020 He's needs to recuse his job and resign or be fired. This is a complete joke
