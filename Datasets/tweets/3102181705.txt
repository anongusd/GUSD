@Great_Marko That is a catchy song.
@BrianHullsVoice #Askbrian Hi Brian did you already do the song you premiered on your tour or are you still working on it?
@atkpodcast @DisneyMKingdoms @ageekychick @Kookamungakat @kclovesgaming I'll welcome Prince Naveen soon.
üî¥Live: Magic Kingdom 1080p Saturday Fun - Walt Disney World Live Stream ... https://t.co/WVZaHUkZ3Z via @YouTube
@Great_Marko Hi my name is Elliot and I watch Resorttv1. I saw you in Friday's live stream with Jenna. I believe you responded with the song from the Move it Shake it Mousekedance it parade.
@atkpodcast I didn't even do it because I didn't want to get on a high leader board. I didn't know when the mini event ended.
@Great_Marko @ResortTV1 Thank you. I really like that song.
@BrizzyVoices Hi my name is Elliot and I like to watch your videos as well as Brian Hull. I liked the open mouth video you did last Feb.
I want to see this. https://t.co/qGn95Ulgyw
@ResortTV1 Hi I'm trying to find the song that goes: Rockin to the west! Celebrate and party with the best! It was on the stream you did on Friday. Do you know the name of it? I'm trying to find it. The only place I can find it on your stream from Friday.
@FINALLEVEL Happy birthday
@atkpodcast I like the new editor, Do you? I'm sure you'll talk about it on the podcast.
@atkpodcast I watched Princess and the Frog the other day.
@atkpodcast How do you think Gameloft decides what stories will be an event or permanent content? Has there been a theme to when an update will be an event or main storyline?
@kimkim32701 That's good.
@ageekychick I hope Ben gets better soon
@BrianHullsVoice #askbrain How long did it  take you to learn how to do  King Julien's voice? Love your videos!
@atkpodcast Cool. I wonder what's going to be on the livestream. Any hints yet?
@kimkim32701 How are you Kim?
@atkpodcast Yes, Moana would be awesome.
@atkpodcast What would you like the next permanent storyline to be? I think that the game ends after the Peter Pan storyline right?
@kimkim32701 Hi Kim how are you? I just wanted to see if you can get my tweets.
@ageekychick Hi Do you have an idea of when will we get the tokens for Mulan's warrior costume? Did you say that there will be ruby chests as well as another way to get tokens for the costume?
@atkpodcast @ageekychick What are your thoughts on improving the social? My idea for the social is to be able to visit your friends on Facebook parks (your friends won't have to play on the same platform as you) You will be able to collect magic and somehow send notes to them.
@BrianHullsVoice Hey Brian are you planning to get the new Kingdom Hearts game?
@kimkim32701 Hi Kim I just found you.
@atkpodcast Hi I just wanted to let you know that I'm leveling up Nick Wilde so he can do cracking the case with Judy Hopps.
@Mariska Happy birthday
@BrianHullsVoice Hey Brain I have a suggestion for a Frankenvoice. King Candy and Mad Hatter. They sound almost the same. I wonder what they will sound like together.
@Kookamungakat Hi my name is Elliot and I play Disney Magic Kingdoms. I play on windows. I checked out your blog and I like it.
@atkpodcast I have a question. What should I be using my magic for leveling up characters or unlocking more land? Right now I'm focusing on leveling up characters before tomorrow's update when the tokens will increase the amounts.
@atkpodcast I'm mean the boards that advertise DMK. The Beauty and the Beast. I hope I can get them.
@kat_tastic Hi Kat my name is Elliot and I like watching your videos. I started watching your videos about the book you wrote about two or three months ago. Could you please give an update on that book? You did weekly vlogs about writing for that book.
@ResortTV1 I'm excited to see what happens in 2019 on the ResortTv1 YouTube channel. Did you already reveal the surprise that you were going to announce? I'll have to go look and see if you did or not.
@atkpodcast I'm excited for the new Cinderella characters. I'm also excited about the billboards with DMK on them.
@BrianHullsVoice Has anyone come up to you or commented and thought you were the character?  I enjoy your videos Brian and I've been watching you for a long time.
@atkpodcast I'm working on getting Nick leveled up to 7 so I can do the Cracking the case quest. I only need 7 more of Nick's ears. I only have Minnie and Zootopia float to do that. I hope that I can start the Jungle Book storyline soon.  I'm also working on Bambi.
@DisneyMKingdoms I can't wait. I hope it'll be fun!
@atkpodcast I think DMK will talk about how we're going to be getting Crikeee into the kingdom. They might also talk at the Cinderella step sisters. 		Do you think we'll get patchnotes for the Cinderella continuing storyline? Do you think we'll be getting anything else?
@erik_niel Hi Erik my name is Elliot and I found your video about the update on your new channel. I must have subscribed to you before. Will you please post a link to your nieled it! channel.
@atkpodcast Ok good. This morning I was  trying to find it but I was looking up the wrong tv show. I looked up Little Enistiens not Octonauts but I managed to find it.
@atkpodcast I'm excited about this. I always like more permanent content. We may also get a tower challenge @ageekychick said, it might be Crikee from Mulan.
@atkpodcast Hi is the feature report like creature report from The Octonauts? I wanted to hear the song that you got that from. I'm listening to Creature report now.
@atkpodcast I got King Louie
RT @anygivenchunday: RT if you're excited to see what we've got in store for these two in #GothamSeason5 üêß‚ùì		#gothamtvwriters #gotham https‚Ä¶

@MaryKateFOX10 I like that you cover stories without interruptions like other stations tend to do
@MaryKateFOX10 I like a break from politics and hear about entertainment news.
@MaryKateFOX10 I like to listen to people's opinion to understand the story.
@MaryKateFOX10 I like to keep up with news but sometimes I don't understand because of the language  someone has to explain it to me.
@MaryKateFOX10 I don't support President Trump and I think our rights and democracy should be protected
@MaryKateFOX10 Thank you for airing my tweets. It feels good to be a part of the show.
@MaryKateFOX10 I think people should protest to show their opinion.
@MaryKateFOX10 I don't agree with Trump banning innocent people, there has to be other ways to keep us safe!
@MaryKateFOX10 I think people should be able to come to the US who are innocent. Isn't this a free country?
@MaryKateFOX10 I understand that the US wants to keep terrorists out but don't just ban people who have done nothing wrong!

@MaryKateFOX10 I think that I saw the same person on The View and he's ok.
@MaryKateFOX10 I think @AlecBaldwin is just impersonating Trump not mocking him and he should just let it go.
@MaryKateFOX10 I think teachers can educate but not give their personal views. My high school was like that. What do you think?
@MaryKateFOX10 I just eat the cheeseburger. I get a soda and and a milkshake. I saw Super Size Me in high school.
@MaryKateFOX10 I'm liking the YouTube channel
@MaryKateFOX10 I don't think President Trump sees the whole picture on how to the wall.
