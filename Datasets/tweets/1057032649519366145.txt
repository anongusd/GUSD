If you want to see TOTAL GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON, vote @TheDemocrats to take control of the House! Nothing will get done for two years! They will argue over who will be Speaker of the House, the ECONOMY WILL COME TO A SCREECHING HALT!
I‚Äôm very curious, and this is a serious question I would like to get answered! At the rally that @BarackObama attended, why is it that all I saw there were Blacks? There might have been one or two Whites, but the overwhelming majority were Black! #RemoveTheScales
