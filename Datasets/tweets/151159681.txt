I'm calling it......Mitt Romney will be selecting Rob Portman from Ohio as his Vice Presidential running mate very soon.......stay tuned!
The pic is of Condi Rice as a little girl standing in front of the White House.....she use to tell her parents...I will be President one day
I have heard from inside sources that its down to Portman or Rice for the Republican VP nomination... check out my pic! http://t.co/RTpAAZML
I sincerely believe that Governor Romney will select Condi Rice as his VP running mate....it's the only "game changer" that can swing votes
My Deepest Sympathies to KY Rep. Regina Bunch and family in the loss of her dear husband former State Rep. Dwayne Bunch.  He will be missed.
Two of the top trends on yahoo at the moment....Anthony Davis's unibrow and John Roberts and Obamacare...only in our country!
Being a Kentucky Senator, I will say that Senator Rand Paul will almost certainly be a top presidential contendor in 2016.....facing Hillary
Today marks an important milestone  in our nation's history. President Obama will almost certainly be re-elected by a large majority.
Its apparent to me that Chief Justice John Roberts wants to readminister the presidential oath to President Obama after flubbing up in 2008
Good morning my fellow Kentuckians.......I hope you're enjoying this beautiful weather!  I've got some exciting news to report very soon!
Even with all of the basketball frenzy upon us, let's not forget those suffering from the tornados in Eastern Kentucky...please help!
Such a classy move by UK President Eli Capilouto to also let UK President Emeritus Lee T. Todd join him in cutting down nets in Atlanta, GA
So proud of the Commonwealths CATS &amp; CARDS both in the 2012 NCAA Final Four  It truly is basketball nirvana for KY!  May the best team win!
As former Governor &amp; Senator of our great Commonwealth, all I can say is that REVENGE is in order for tonight as we take on Hoosiers of IU!

Everyone should be greatful for Apple Founder Steve Jobs who passed away this evening....he was the Edison of this generation.

Hard to believe but true Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich becomes the 4th Gov to be convicted of a crime others were Kermer Ryan & Walker

I'm putting my money on Michelle Bachman or Herman Cain to go against Obama in 2012  .Mitt Romney is too stiff and out of touch with reality
My most proud accomplishment was the creation of the Kentucky State Police.....Wonderful group of men and women who protect the Commonwealth
I think the big race to watch in November is the KY Attorney General's Race......it will be a cat fight!!
I love the fact that so many Republicans are endorsing Gov. Beshear in the upcoming Governor's election....
Today is the annivesary of D-Day...to all of the brave souls who fought for our freedom on that date..may they never be forgotten..God Bless
Most don't have a clue that Kentucky has more counties (120) than any other state in the nation.
One great idea for KY to save $$$.......combine/consolidate our 120 county courthouses so there aren't 120 PVA's, Court Clerks, etc.!
I've always found it strange that Kentucky has County Judge Executives they actually aren't Judges ( I was one!)
Fellow Kentuckians - stay cool out in this hot weather that we continue to have.  Hard to believe it's still 15 days away from the summer!
I think the Conway/P'Pool Race for Attorney General will be the one to watch in the upcoming election.....
I love Governor Beshear's commmercial..bet you didn't know the family first had a furniture/funeral business before just the funeral home.
The great state of the Commonwealth of Kentucky was created today back in 1792.......What a great place we call home!!!
Prayers out to all of those effected in Kentucky and other states from the devastating storms that we've had.  Hopefully, they'll end soon!
Here's another great pic of me and Republican Senator Proxmire....http://www.life.com/image/50338092  I always crossed the aisle to work!
Check out this picture of me and fellow Gov. Wetherby.....he was a great friend....http://www.life.com/image/50395400
I want to commend fellow Senator Paul for showing up at Ft. Campbell to honor our beloved troops.  Others should have done the same thing.

Interesting KY Republican candidate for Sec of State - Johnson http://kentuckybill.com/  He'll have a time going against the Jerry machine.
Let's hope the KY Governors race is not as nasty as 2010 Senate campaign.  I don't want to hear anymore aquabuddha ads or see no handshakes.
The rumor is a buzz that Donald Trump is going to enter the Prez race again. I hope he decides to "fire" himself from doing this.
Could you imagine a Hermann Cain vs.  Barack Obama ticket for the presidency?  Just watch out because it could be an awesome reality.
Funny quote I read this morning:  An American worker voting for a Republican is rather like a chicken supporting Colonel Sanders!
Hats off to Elaine Walker for doing an outstanding job this year as KYs Secretary of State her stay is short but her hard work will carry on
I'll stick my neck out and say that Lundergran-Grimes and Comer will face each other in eight years for the KY 2019 Governor's Race.......

I can't believe McConnell is already building a war chest for his next campaign.  One might think that fellow Sen. Paul will not support him
I've always respected Sen. McConnell.  However, something seems weird about this situation.
Why wont Sen. Mitch McConnell allow his military records to be released? http://www.hillbillyreport.com/blog/2007/02/senator_mitch_m_1.html

Does anyone out there even know we have a Primary Election coming up?  It never ceases to amaze me at the people who don't even care.
I must admit that fellow Gov. Beshear is indeed a smart man to pick the KY Oaks over the President's trip to Fort Campbell.
Heck, Dr. Capilouto also has a cousin working at UK.....Gilson Capilouto.  I wonder if this has ever been leaked to the news media?
Surely new University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto was investigated by the search committee negating him of any medicare fraud.
I hope the allegations of Medicare Fraud are not true.....It always bothers me to see stories like that come out about a new University Prez
Check out this article on UK President Capilouto http://www.opednews.com/articles/Major-University-Hires-a-P-by-Roger-Shuler-110504-112.html
It's fantastic to see and read that the new UK President will be living on campus and not somewhere else.
There will be a new man and woman occupying UK's Maxwell Place...It's non other than Dr. & Drs.  Eli Capilouto!  Congrads!
I wish only the best for Dr. Capilouto and hope he makes UK an even greater institution.His tenure will be short, but hopefully a great one!
Prayers go out to all of the families effected by the devastating floods and tornados throughout America.  God Bless You!
It's interesting to see that Dr. Capilouto, UK's Selected 12th President, has donated $$$ to Senator Mitch McConnell and other candidates.
From UAB to UK Eli Capilouto will make a fantastic Univ Kentucky President his academic, governmental, & medical qualifications are perfect
Dr. Capilouto started out in life wanting to pull teeth as a dentist.....now he will lead the Commonwealth's institution.
Dr. Capilouto, who will be University of Kentucky's 12th President, is 61 and a Harvard alum......background is in Public Health.
Welcome to Kentucky........Eli Capilouto.........UK President Contingent....
I believe the glass ceiling will fall today at UK.........a new "King" of higher education will be unveiled!
This will be both a shocking and historic day for the University of Kentucky.....We are a few hours away from the big announcement.......
Will the "wright" man from Praire View A&M come home to his beloved state of Kentucky? Hmmmmmmmmm.
I'll be glad when this supposedly secreative UK Prez search process is over with.  It seems like it has been going on for an eternity.
I wish we could have gotten Dr. Jeffcoat who decided on the Millikin University job.  He would have been a tremendous leader for UK.
I think everyone will be in for a shock on Sunday following the announcement of the new University of Kentucky President.  To be announced..
From my viewpoint, Fingerhut very well is not even a finalist.....this is just a way for the media to sell an audience!
I'm surpised Governor Ted Strikland (UK alum) would let the media know that Fingerhut was a confirmed candidate.
University of Kentucky President Fingerhut?  I wonder who they will report on tomorrow?  Swamy?  Duff?  Adams? Alexander?To be continued...
I can't believe there is a fight over the UK Fight Song.  What has this world come to!!
One fact that I do know.......Jude Thompson from Papa Johns and Anthem Blue Cross is not the next University of Kentucky President.
It's almost D-Day to find out the next University of Kentucky President....Swamy..Duff...Adams...Fletcher...Forsee...
The University of Kentucky is famous for promoting within it's own organization.....i.e. Charles Wethington, Jr.
Word on the street it's between UK Alum/Law man Jim Duff, Swamy, Gary Forsee, Michael Adams, and France Cordova.  To be continued....
The rumor mill is a buzz that the next University of Kentucky President will be "Swamy", as in UK's current Provost Dr. Kumble Subbaswamy.
I love the fact that Senator Paul has already announced he is running again for the Senate in 2016!
Rep. Dewayne Bunch.......your in my thoughts and prayers.....I wish for a full recovery in which you can return to our beloved capital city!
I can't believe the RMS Titanic also sunk on this date 99 years ago......it seems just like yesterday.
I'm still a little skeptical about the whole UK Presidential Search Process. I wish all of the candidates would be known to the public.
Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.........!!
Camp Breckinridge in Union County KY (where no. 42 played) was home to more than 50,000 troops during WWII

University of Kentucky President Duff? Take a look at this guy's vitae.He might be UKs next Prez http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Duff
There are reports that Rand Paul will indeed either be a Presidential Candidate for candidate for VP in the upcoming 2012 election.
The rumor mill is a buzz that the next President of the University of Kentucky will indeed be female.  To be continued......
I don't remember betting with my former governor peers when we were in the final basketball games.  How times have changed!
The rumor mill is a buzz that Gary Forsee (Missouri's ex-Prez), Mike Adams, King Alexander, Jim Duff are top candidates for the UK Prez Job
Hello fellow Kentuckians!  Let's hope for a big win in Houston this weekend!  It's hard to believe but I was at KY's 1951 Championship game!
Morehead and Louisville, KY are 130 miles apart....but have to play in Denver....I wonder how much that will cost to fire up the jets?
It's great to see two fantastic schools lead by  Wayne Andrews at (Morehead State) and Jim Ramsey (Louisville) play in the NCAA Tourney!
It's kind of crazy to think the Kentucky Wildcats have to beat W. Virginia, Ohio State, and possibly North Carolina to advance to Final Four
I know I should just keep my twittering to politics....However, was the NCAA Selection Committee asleep for the SEC  Tourney game today?
Possible UK President candidates:  Ernie Fletcher, James C. Duff, King Alexander, Gary D. Forsee, James Clements, etc.
Who would have ever thought a KY Senator would be on the Letterman show?  That would have been like me being on Jack Paar or Ed Sullivan!
Praying for everyone affected by the earthquake in Japan, Hawaii, and all of the other various islands.  May God Bless them all at this time
Back to Frankfort for the Legislators.....I hope the dropout age rises from 16 to 18 in KY.
Why can't we find a way to fix the budget in Frankfort?  It seems like we can never walk across the aisle and reach a compromise anymore.
It's seems that Rand Paul is everywhere these days....He appears to be gearing up for another campaign with all of his talk/radio shows
Let's hope these gas prices subside....people here in the Commonwealth will continue to suffer in this recession

There are several rising stars on the KY political front.  One is Ryan Quarles from Georgetown.  He could be Governor one day.
Governor Patton is and always will be our Education Governor.  He's done so much for the CPE, KCTCS, and now Pikeviille University.
Let's pray for former KY Governor Paul E. Patton...he was taken to the UK ER yesterday for a heart ailment and released shortly after.
I applaud the bill in the Ky General Assembly that requires students to recite the pledge of allegiance!  God Bless Kentucky and America!
Everyone in the Commonwealth of KY should be proud of our state's community college system, KCTCS.  They have done wonders for our state.

I respect and admire KY Rep. Cherry's bill to ban controversial midmen in our KY Pension System.  Let's hope it is passed immediately.
I respect Wendell Berry for what he has done for KY....In stating that, I also must say that he should think about his actions.

My favorite government salary is former UK Prez Charles Wethington Look http://datacenter.courier-journal.com/government/salaries/index.php
I look at it this way.....Todd can give raises before he leaves since his lame duck status will keep the new Prez from having to do such.
I rarely discuss athletics.However it seems that Dr. Todd will be keeping the UK A.D. around for a few more years with his $600,000 paycheck
I hope KCTC & OCTC can get things straightened out regarding the lawsuit firing of their former Prez..what a story! www.pageonekentucky.com
I wish we would have had flat screens tvs in the KY General Assembly when I was Governor.  Boy how times have changed!
Vice-President Paul?  I've also had a source confirm that Senator Paul might also be one is on a VP ticket some day.
President Rand Paul?  I feel strongly that Senator Paul will definitely run for the Presidency at some point in the near future
I don't think alot of people in KY know that Jerry Lundergran is closer to Prez Bill Clinton and wife Hillary than anyone else in KY
Dr. Michael Adams at the University of Georgia is also a strong contender for the UK Prez job.  He's the former prez at Centre College
Mr. Dunn's got connections to academia, politics, law, athletics, and just about everything else.  As Jim Stuckert has said, he's "superman"

The Rand Paul Jack Conway debate was great to watch....fortunately the aquabuddha did not make an appearance!
