My brother was such a good kid. So fun loving and kind. Yet so unbelievably brave.
My dad was everything I could ask for in a father—it’s cliche but so much of what he told me makes perfect sense now that I’m raising my own sons.
As my stepmother texted me today, it seems like a million years ago, but it feels like yesterday.
My dad, Billy Venable, answered the door to a would be robber who had a gun. After a struggle, my dad was shot. My brother Bill was also shot as he raced to my dad’s aid. Both were killed. 3/

A Minnesota #sunset https://t.co/TDGWf2LHQo
@MillCityRunning Can you follow for DM?
@plumandmustard On pacing a non-elite male can't pace an elite male.  The non-elite male is going to run maybe 2:40 or a minute to 90 seconds slower a mile than the elite male.  Many 2:30-2:50 runners could pace elite or near elite females.
@plumandmustard Understand your view--it is different treatment.  The trade off is that the professional women get a better race and more attention (which hopefully equals better prize money and more sponsorship opps).
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein I don’t have an answer there. Also it could have been cool for Boston or a sponsor to give an additional prize above the set prize money. 		Just to end, I do think the elite women’s start is a good thing. And the race was awesome this year (Desi!!!) in brutal weather. End
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein It’s tough to know how much those factors are worth in a single race, but that is the reasoning for separating and why she wasn’t eligible. 		That said, it is a fair question as to whether more women should have access to the elite start. /7
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein This was particularly true this year in horrible weather when drafting and pacing with 6 foot men likely provided some advantage time wise over a really tactical elite race. /6
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein For a 2:50 runner, there are going to be many more 2:50 runners (mostly male) in the main pack than in the elite women’s start. It is easier to pace off of others without thinking about “racing.” /5
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein Now onto the issue at hand. All things being equal it is probably marginally easier for the same runner to have a better time starting with the main pack than with the elite women. /4
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein It’s also worth noting at the outset that men’s and women’s prize money is even at Boston. /3
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein It was intended to elevate the excitement of the women’s race rather than having to search for the lead women in a larger field. And I think it’s generally a really cool thing to watch. /2
@goldengateblond @juliareinstein So I’ve run Boston a couple of times including this year. Just want to offer a couple of things to think about. 		The elite women’s start was moved up in most “major” marathons about 15 years ago, to put more focus on women’s running. /1
