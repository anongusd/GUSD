@allthngsgarbage @Pres_Bartlet  So there are more restrictions on cars, less cars than guns, and still there are more vehicle deaths per yr?
@fiestyseabass @Pres_Bartlet My point is that anything can be dangerous. It is the people using them that make them so.
@fiestyseabass @Pres_Bartlet And it’s actually Bugatti.
@fiestyseabass @Pres_Bartlet 84-88 HUMMVEEs can be driven legally, as well as Veyrons.
@murse13 @Pres_Bartlet You are kidding, right?
@murse13 @Pres_Bartlet How about 168, including 16 children?
@JohnPalethorpe Chicago and DC are glaring examples of it not working. Whereas Kennesaw, GA is something different.
@JohnPalethorpe Yep, works great in Chicago and DC.
@JohnPalethorpe Right, because that would be dumb.
@allthngsgarbage @Pres_Bartlet You don’t know much about how to obtain a gun, do you?
@allthngsgarbage @Pres_Bartlet Yeah, because weapons aren’t regulated to the caliber or barrel length… right?
@JohnPalethorpe So, the delivery method is not important?
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet We aren’t talking about the attacks… we are talking about the tools used and their ease of acquirement.
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet Yeah, no one remembers The name Timothy McVeigh.
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet Just about anyone can rent a Ryder truck though…
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet But then again… no one has ever used a vehicle to kill a massive amount of people… right?
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet That was the first I pulled out of the search.
@murse13 @Pres_Bartlet Not when the majority of those people safely handle and store them.
@gregsimonmusic @Pres_Bartlet Not here in GA. The CDL is only $35 with basic operating tests.
@murse13 @Pres_Bartlet Not really. There are roughly 4 times more guns in private registration than cars, yet the # of deaths is similar.
@allthngsgarbage @Pres_Bartlet A vehicle is a tool, just like a Gun. They have different uses, and both can be used for terrible things.
@jwhipp1 @Pres_Bartlet Just like Class 3 weapons.. But everything else is fair game. A 2000 lbs Fiat or a 4500 lbs Range Rover.
@JohnPalethorpe @Pres_Bartlet Except people seem to do it everyday… http://t.co/ZPpk7GSt
@gregsimonmusic @Pres_Bartlet Right, just like we have Class 3 weapon requirements. Similar to commercial vs personal.
@Pres_Bartlet We don’t limit the size or power of the vehicle one can obtain.
