Most inspiring / insightful quote of 2017 is without a doubt:		“It’s interesting the things you hear about historical facts about our presidents.” - @ScottAukerman 		#BestOf2017
Thank you so much @realDonaldTrump! This is the first time in the last 8 years I’ve felt safe enough to say “Merry Christmas”
@SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Y’all are so full of shit
@SenatorCollins please reconsider ... This is whole process is a disaster and has been rushed through.  With last minute news coming doesn't it beg the question "Why are you rushing this through so fast?" The bill is harsh and benefits the rich and will add to the deficit. https://t.co/uwxKu7Kv1k
@mikiebarb I'd be very interested in a story about why the definition of Domestic Terrorisim doesn't cover these apparently motiveless mass shootings
@mikiebarb Love the show so much but if I wanted to hear about what a nice guy he was I'd turn on @FoxNews or @CNN
@mikiebarb How about we don't normalize this person or this event. Discuss how these mass shootings are always by white males and our govt does nothing
@mikiebarb Understand that without knowing motive you can't really call it "terrorism" but the story is so tame compared to if it was a person of color
Wow. Even The Daily (@mikiebarb) is using the White Privilege language of "lone gunman" and "nice quiet guy" despite having a secret arsenal

@realDonaldTrump Also, some more facts. Your daughter @IvankaTrump is married to @jaredkushner, who is Jewish. So maybe don't side with Nazis?
