@DeplorableNew @GOP It‚Äôs just the first one I found. You can ‚Äúgoggle‚Äù it yourself. It still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Cohen lied to protect Trump.
@DeplorableNew @GOP It‚Äôs a mainstream story, not some scoop they have. Same article can be found in multiple sources.
@DeplorableNew @GOP Please tell me how lying about the Moscow Project was protecting his own ass and not Trump‚Äôs.
@DeplorableNew @GOP No I don‚Äôt think you understand. I already know the answer, I don‚Äôt think you do. He got caught lying to protect Trump. https://t.co/PmRGJJkPPh
@DeplorableNew @GOP Specifically, what did he lie about? I‚Äôm talking about the first time, not yesterday. You do realize what he got caught lying about, right?
@DeplorableNew @GOP It won‚Äôt be established until Mueller is finished investigating. Tell me, why did Michael Cohen lie to Congress the first time? What was he lying about?
@DeplorableNew @GOP I‚Äôm totally fine with Hillary being investigated for anything you or others think she did wrong. Unlike some people, I don‚Äôt blindly support a politician no matter what wrong or illegal things they do. If collusion isn‚Äôt a crime, why do you care if there was or was not collusion?
@DeplorableNew @GOP If Mueller‚Äôs report shows no collusion then I will accept it as truth. But it hasn‚Äôt been established yet, so you‚Äôre wrong about that.
@DeplorableNew @GOP Oh I wasn‚Äôt aware that Mueller was finished with his investigation.
@DeplorableNew @GOP So he said he didn‚Äôt see any evidence of collusion. You said you don‚Äôt believe anything he said. So you believe there was collusion?
@GOP So you believe him when it‚Äôs convenient?

@SNFonNBC Kelly Gregg
@darrenoestmann @triggertried @theblaze It bothers me when the President gives a speech that is inaccurate. It‚Äôs the concept, rather than what he was inaccurate about here that bothers me.
@triggertried @Schooch80 @darrenoestmann @theblaze That doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all.
@triggertried @darrenoestmann @theblaze It bothers me that the President isn‚Äôt accurate about his statistics, information, dates, quantifiable numbers, whatever you want to call them. It should bother everyone.
@triggertried @darrenoestmann @theblaze If only the left cares about being accurate, then it says plenty about the right. There‚Äôs no shame in wanting the President to be as accurate as possible no matter what party they belong to. Why would you not want to be as accurate as possible?
@triggertried @darrenoestmann @theblaze It would help all of us be able to trust what the leader of our country is saying without having to question every statistic that comes out of his mouth. These ones aren‚Äôt hard to get right. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
@Schooch80 @darrenoestmann @theblaze Why not be as accurate as you can be in such a serious and important speech? If he was speaking off prompter it would be a different story.
@triggertried @darrenoestmann @theblaze I think it matters for the President to be accurate. Maybe his speechwriting team needs to do the critical thinking here.
@darrenoestmann @theblaze Idk, I just kinda think what the President says in a written speech should be thoroughly researched and accurate no matter how close to accurate it is. Maybe that‚Äôs just me.
@theblaze Yeah!!! Who even cares about the President being accurate?!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your dad said Nazis were good people though so...
@AnthonyT2_Mufc @flamingoart @benshapiro Gotcha. Well I appreciate the clarification anyway.
Has the whole state of Virginia wore blackface at one point?
@AnthonyT2_Mufc @flamingoart @benshapiro Hm ok I see the difference. It still doesn‚Äôt change my belief that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being against religion.
@flamingoart @benshapiro Atheism is a lack of religion, not a religion.
@shaunquixote @benshapiro There‚Äôs nothing wrong with not being religious. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being against religion.
@shaunquixote @benshapiro Yes.
@PLGriffin06 @Bmacdaddy33 @benshapiro Difference being religion is a choice, being gay isn‚Äôt.
@PeteyPete92 @benshapiro Ok what if it was the distaste for bigotry against the LGBT community? And that just happened to be because of their religion.
@Bmacdaddy33 @PLGriffin06 @benshapiro It‚Äôs not simply because they're Catholic. It‚Äôs because of the views and morals they have by being Catholic. But again, it‚Äôs not prohibiting them from free exercise of religion.
@Bmacdaddy33 @PLGriffin06 @benshapiro That‚Äôs not prohibiting their right to exercise their religion.
@PLGriffin06 @benshapiro Like what?
@alleysnell @benshapiro Agreed. And people can be religious, but their religion shouldn‚Äôt entitle them to discriminate against anyone either.
@xchapyeg @benshapiro No you aren‚Äôt.
@RThe21st @The3rand @benshapiro He saved our season. I believe in him.

@OneMoreBrian @prageru @AOC You have evidence. You can make predictions about that evidence. You can make incorrect predictions. The evidence is still true regardless. What Prager here is trying to indicate is that because some made incorrect predictions, the evidence must be false.
@OneMoreBrian @prageru @AOC Making and being wrong about a prediction within a field does not make the whole field of study incorrect. It just makes your prediction incorrect.
@OneMoreBrian @prageru @AOC Right but making wrong predictions doesn‚Äôt make the entire theory incorrect.
@RyanAFournier Not even close to being the same but this is a good try.

@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Yeah that‚Äôs an incident, not a systemic issue.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @SiggySour @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Yes, if that was a rampant issue it would be a problem. It‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs not statistical evidence to prove your point.
@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Or accepting what makes them happy because it shouldn‚Äôt affect you but you let it.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @SiggySour @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Not a problem to us, it‚Äôs a problem for them.
@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Ok but what statistics suggest a transgender person is more dangerous than a straight person? An incident doesn‚Äôt prove that.
@sigtruth @SiggySour @CensoredRy @reddoor2000 @Cernovich My opinion.
@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Were you going to send me statistics?
@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich That person deserves to be in jail.
@SiggySour @CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich There‚Äôs nothing immoral about being transgender. The moral thing here is to accept people for who they are.
@CensoredRy @SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Please share.
@SiggySour @CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Absolutely. There‚Äôs nothing to suggest that they are more dangerous to a child than a straight person.
@SiggySour @CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich There‚Äôs nothing immoral about dressing in drag. It also has nothing to do with pedophilia. And Satan doesn‚Äôt exist.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich They have a right to use any bathroom they want. You‚Äôre choosing to let it bother you when in reality it shouldn‚Äôt affect you at all. It‚Äôs not their fault you‚Äôre so soft.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Why would they be scarred for life? All the person is doing is using the bathroom.
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich If that person wants to reverse, that‚Äôs completely their choice and doesn‚Äôt affect you. Suicides, if anything, are due to the bigotry and societal rejection that people like you perpetrate.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Ok but if a man feels that he is a woman inside, there‚Äôs no harm to anyone else in letting them dress or transition to a woman. It doesn‚Äôt affect you. So why let it bother you?
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Why? Why do they owe you any excuse?
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich And what does that have do with a child?
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Letting people mind their own business and not beating someone up for being different is moving forward, no matter what issues they might have.
@sigtruth @CensoredRy @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich But if what they want isn‚Äôt a bad thing, there‚Äôs no reason to let them do what they want. It might make them more stable to let them do what they want as opposed to trying to force them to be something they don‚Äôt see themselves as.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich No, I wouldn‚Äôt let a pervert share a bedroom with my child. Nothing about being transgender means perverted. Nothing.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Ok you keep saying ‚Äúfollow‚Äù as if they are stalking them. What if they just use the bathroom at the same time? You‚Äôre going to beat someone up just for that?
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Ok so the difference is that anorexia isn‚Äôt healthy. Wanting to dress like the opposite sex or wanting an operation is not unhealthy. It affects no one.
This rhetoric is dangerous and scary. https://t.co/ll6vRC4OIA
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich If you don‚Äôt tolerate it, you‚Äôre a criminal and a bigot. The world is moving forward, maybe you should too.
@sigtruth @CensoredRy @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich .@CensoredRy is.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Depends, are you just using the bathroom? If so, who cares. You‚Äôre letting something so innocent bother you. Letting someone use the bathroom they want has no negative consequences other than you being paranoid.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich What if he‚Äôs just trying to use the bathroom and minding his own business? There‚Äôs nothing perverted about that. I would mind my own business. You can‚Äôt beat people up for being different than you.
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich It‚Äôs not. Race is not the same as gender.
@SiggySour @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @Cernovich Well there goes the logical conversation I was trying to have.
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich We should help them transition if that‚Äôs what they want. I tend to agree with you on the sports issue.
@CensoredRy @sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Ok let‚Äôs say that happens. What happens after he follows her in? He uses the bathroom?
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich No
@sigtruth @reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich How about we just let people be who they are comfortable with being instead of trying to dictate what or who they have to be?
@RepJeffDuncan @POTUS You should get him to work on a commitment to the born instead.
@SiggySour Why?
@SiggySour So they should have to use the bathroom they don‚Äôt want to use because they way they look creeps you out?
@SiggySour Ok, so let‚Äôs say that person has mental issues. They don‚Äôt have the right to use the bathroom they prefer?
@reddoor2000 @SiggySour @Cernovich Why does it bother you so much?
Advocating for bullying of transgender people. Would expect nothing less. https://t.co/QSLhNZ8CyM
@SiggySour @Cernovich You don‚Äôt get to choose who you use a bathroom with, no matter how weird you might think they are. Don‚Äôt be an asshole.

@benshapiro Whoa, got him!!!
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods I just don‚Äôt think a spouses action is disqualifying for a candidate. Since you‚Äôre so high and mighty then, did you support Roy Moore?
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Again, I‚Äôve already said Bill Clinton‚Äôs conduct was wrong. I don‚Äôt condone his behavior and I‚Äôm not staying silent on it. But we‚Äôre talking about Hillary here, not Bill.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Certainly handsy, like I said. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call that groping though. But again, either way, he should stop doing that.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods The #MeToo agenda is a good thing, not a bad thing. Harvey Weinstein was a contributor to the Democrats, so that‚Äôs not remotely true. Also I voted for Hillary, not for Bill. She‚Äôs her own person.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Yes. And no. He can definitely get handsy, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs groped any little girls. Either way, he definitely needs to control himself better around women.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Yes I did. Just not gonna address the Al Franken thing, huh? But if we‚Äôre comparing parties, we can talk about Roy Moore if you want.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods It absolutely does.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods So what happened to Al Franken kind of disproves your point that liberals stay silent, no?
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods I think Bill Clinton made some very serious mistakes. Had he done it in today‚Äôs times, the consequences would have been very different. As for Ellison and Booker, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much veracity there in either case.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Like with Al Franken?
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods I‚Äôm not really sure what your point is here.
@esther63032530 @LynnLebowski @RealJamesWoods Why?

@dianelgeary @RepMarkMeadows There must be a root cause for your fears.

@dianelgeary @RepMarkMeadows I‚Äôm not. If I thought it would be worth it then I‚Äôd be all for it. It‚Äôs unnecessary. What are you so afraid of that you think a wall will prevent?
@MoultonHawk @Ravens Sorry, should clarify that it‚Äôs AFC. If we came in second place, we‚Äôd play all the AFC second-place teams instead.
@MoultonHawk @Ravens Because we play each division winner since we won the division.
@dianelgeary @RepMarkMeadows I‚Äôm aware of how determined Trump is. Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs right. The flow of illegal immigration is not a danger to our country. Should it be prevented and better managed? Yes. Not through a wall though.
@dianelgeary @RepMarkMeadows It doesn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt fund the wall. We can spend less money in a more effective way and have better border security.
@RepMarkMeadows The wall doesn‚Äôt make us safer.

The Steelers aren‚Äôt going to win a Super Bowl this year. That‚Äôs a good season in my book.

@Par2ival1 @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton If he ran as an independent, he would have split the Democratic vote and ensured a victory for Trump. He might have some disagreements with Hillary, but he's far more similar to her than you think. And as crooked as you think she is, she still would have been better than Trump.
@Par2ival1 @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton He ran as a Democrat and supported the Democratic candidate. Yes, supporting Hillary Clinton was more important than helping Donald Trump win.
@Par2ival1 @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton Because he recognized that was more important than giving Donald Trump a greater chance of winning.
@SenSanders I have a candidate in mind who is none of those things...

@Nobodieknows @JBradHacker @dbongino So why would he lie to the FBI about his contacts with Russia if he did nothing wrong? And what further help is he going to provide the FBI with if no one else did anything wrong?
@Nobodieknows @JBradHacker @dbongino It‚Äôs not.
@JBradHacker @dbongino Regardless if he actually ends up serving time, he was still found guilty for lying to the FBI about Russia and will be sentenced. That‚Äôs not a witch hunt.

@LoganSeery @benshapiro I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs referring to at all. This whole thing is about sexual assault.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro No, of course not. But this isn‚Äôt what this video is about. She‚Äôs talking about sexual harassment and the privilege that men have to not worry the same way women do with everyday actions.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro I can see how you interpreted it that way. Maybe this video would have been better if she only highlighted what women experience. Still though, I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs the only thing men experience.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro I disagree. She‚Äôs implying that those are problems that men make big deals about (because they do). She isn‚Äôt implying those are the only issues men have.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro All of the issues that she listed in her song are huge concerns for women. Again, not to say you nor I can‚Äôt experience the same fears. We might be afraid of being mugged, but we aren‚Äôt regularly afraid of being raped. We don‚Äôt think twice about our drink being drugged.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro No, I told you to tell me how men have more problems than women. Not just to list problems that men have. Of course men have their own issues too, never disagreed with that. Things are just worse/scarier for women.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro lol at ‚Äúmaid"
@LoganSeery @benshapiro I‚Äôm referencing her lyrics. In no way, shape, or form did she list those problems that men have as the only problems men have.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro If women had the same jobs as men, workplace injury rates would be the same. But anyway it‚Äôs pretty clear that we‚Äôre talking about sexual assault here.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Right. As I‚Äôve said and as she never disagreed with, those aren‚Äôt the only issues men have. You‚Äôre really not getting this.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Uh‚Ä¶what. Yes, a bar is where you go to get drinks. Your argument makes no sense. Let me lay it out simply for you. Women are more likely to be drugged than men at a bar. Therefore, women have it harder than men.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Right. I‚Äôm saying women have more problems than men. Please tell me how men have more problems than women.
"men have it just as bad as women‚Äù 		Unfuckingbelievable https://t.co/yhfdM7kh6W
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Waiting on this answer. Simple yes or no.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro You didn‚Äôt. She is listing those as problems that men have. Nowhere did she say those were the only problems men have.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Did you? Please quote where she says ‚Äúthe only problems men have is‚Ä¶"
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Wearing a mini skirt. Wearing silk pajamas. Speaking earnestly about her fears.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro It‚Äôs just the act of walking to her car‚Ä¶If you think this is more about mugging than sexual assault, you‚Äôre certainly the dense one here.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Right, she says those are problems for men. Where does it say those are the only problems men have?
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Are women more likely to be drugged at a bar? Please tell me what you think.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Can happen is not the same as more likely to happen. Women are more likely to experience these issues. And many of the things she did say really do only affect women.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Ok, where does it say those are the only problems men have?
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Because those are things men get pissed about. Just please, please explain to me why/how you think men have it just as bad as women.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Pretty sure she isn‚Äôt talking about mugging‚Ä¶and yes, females are more likely to have their drinks drugged. Again, she never said men don‚Äôt have these issues as well.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro She said those were the only problems men have? I don‚Äôt recall her saying that.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro She isn‚Äôt saying those problems are exclusively women‚Äôs, just that they are scarier and worse for women. Because they are.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro No, that you just said that men have it just as bad as women. How can you even begin to justify that?
@LoganSeery @benshapiro We really, really, really don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs ok to be afraid of being mugged, but for women this world is a much more hostile and scarier place. Baffles me that you can even say what you just said.
@LoganSeery @benshapiro Oh yeah? You‚Äôve been accused of rape?
@LoganSeery @benshapiro She of course doesn‚Äôt mean she can‚Äôt literally do those things. It‚Äôs that she‚Äôs afraid to do them because she‚Äôs a woman.
@MattWalshBlog The sad thing is she isn‚Äôt being paranoid.
@benshapiro I think you missed the point.

@Birrraay @collindonavon How??? Republicans controlled the Senate and refused to meet with him, have a hearing, or even vote on him. This isn‚Äôt a matter of opinion.
@Birrraay @collindonavon Wait until she gets elected? He wanted to have Garland confirmed before he left‚Ä¶and Republicans wouldn‚Äôt even give him a single hearing because of a made up reason. Trying to remember how many sexual assault allegations he had...
@Birrraay @collindonavon Clearly meant as a joke but still nonetheless wrong. With Moore, it was multiple accusations of pedophilia and sexual harassment of minors. You only need proof to find someone guilty in court, not to believe someone is guilty.
@Birrraay @collindonavon It‚Äôs both. But if we want to talk about just caring about keeping one's party in power, let‚Äôs talk about Merrick Garland. That was total bullshit.
@Birrraay @collindonavon Absolutely not. They would have found another candidate by now or at the very least allowed an FBI investigation. Democrats take these claims more seriously. Just look at Roy Moore compared to Al Franken.
@Birrraay @collindonavon I think they believe her story because they aren‚Äôt shitty people and actually have a sense of empathy. You think just because she tells her story now is disqualifying? Do you realize how difficult this must be for her? Cmon bro cmon.
@Birrraay @collindonavon When or why she chooses to feel comfortable enough to tell her story is irrelevant. That‚Äôs up to one person only, and it certainly isn‚Äôt you or me.
@collindonavon @Birrraay I believe that she‚Äôs telling the truth, yeah. A lack of proof doesn‚Äôt equate to lying.
@Birrraay @collindonavon It‚Äôs truly the only reason they would do it! It‚Äôs every victim of sexual assault‚Äôs dream! Really makes the trauma worth it, ya know?
@Birrraay @collindonavon And to think it all started getting good on January 20, 2017!
@Birrraay @collindonavon Ugh yeah you‚Äôre right. If only Dems paid for that 6th accuser then I think we would have been successful. Oh well!
@collindonavon In this case I‚Äôm talking about Republican Senators and voting in Kavanaugh. I don‚Äôt think every Republican is a bad person.
@collindonavon After he gets voted in? Definitely none.
Why do people continually forget that Republicans don‚Äôt have consciences or morals? No one should be surprised when Kavanaugh gets voted in.

@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox If you want, we can try the opposite direction. I went to community college. Now what?
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox I‚Äôll play along, but hypothetically. I went to Harvard. Now what?
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox A 95 degree day is hotter than a 90 degree day. Is a 90 degree day cold?
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox You know nothing about me. I didn‚Äôt say Kent State was bad, I just said I think David can go to a better school than Kent State. Again, something being better than something else doesn‚Äôt make the first thing bad.
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox I haven‚Äôt backtracked at all. You guys haven‚Äôt shown in any way how my education is relevant. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether I went to a better or worse school than Kent State.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox This is like if we were arguing about two NFL quarterbacks and someone said ‚Äúoh yeah, well how well can YOU play quarterback?‚Äù
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox There‚Äôs nothing to be called out. I may have gone to a better school than her. I may not have. I‚Äôm not going to say one way or the other because I know it doesn‚Äôt matter at all to the point I was making.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox It‚Äôs Twitter, of course etiquette doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. I can certainly take it as much as I dish it out, but if something doesn‚Äôt even pertain to the argument then I‚Äôm going to call that out. You clearly have no logical response to anything I‚Äôve said.
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox Actually I didn‚Äôt. I just said that I think he could get into a better school than her. One school being better than the other doesn‚Äôt mean one is a bad school.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox Ok let‚Äôs go down this road then. Let‚Äôs say hypothetically I went to a worse school than her or @adaffy15 . Now what? What does that mean for my argument? Now ask the same question if I went to a better school than either of them.
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox As jackass later trying? What does that even mean?
@adaffy15 @RyeDunn @KaitMarieox Good for you! Now tell me how where you are going or where I went has to do with anything.
@adaffy15 @KaitMarieox How did I make fun of her for going to college? All I said was that I think David could get into a better school than her. I‚Äôm not comparing myself to either of them.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox Following your logic, since @adaffy15 called me out on my education, should I call him out too on his education? Or you for that matter?
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox But my education has no bearing on whether I‚Äôm right or wrong about David getting into a better school than her. If I went to a worse or better school than her, it means nothing, especially in light of what I was arguing about originally.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox She‚Äôs claiming that he got Fs in school and is insinuating that he isn‚Äôt very smart. She‚Äôs calling out his intelligence and I‚Äôm calling her our because I think David can get into a better school than she can. I‚Äôm not comparing myself to her or David. So it‚Äôs irrelevant.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox It‚Äôs not relevant though. We‚Äôre talking about her and David Hogg, not me. I could have gone to Harvard or a community college, it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference to the original argument.
@RyeDunn @adaffy15 @KaitMarieox oh man, roasted!!
@adaffy15 @KaitMarieox That‚Äôs irrelevant.

@callstevejoyce @BrittMcHenry I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt either. In this case though I‚Äôm really not being condescending. Just having a conversation.
@callstevejoyce @BrittMcHenry Not at all. I‚Äôm explaining my opinion and why I think she‚Äôs wrong, and I am a man, but it has nothing to do with her being a woman and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being condescending.
@BrittMcHenry No, of course not. But a show directly about the degradation of women having a costume that can be seen as degrading is kind of hypocritical. I can understand why some would be bothered. I know in the end it‚Äôs just fiction but the show does have meaning behind it.
@BrittMcHenry I mean it‚Äôs because of what that show is about‚Ä¶lobsters don‚Äôt have the same meaning. Not really a sound argument.

@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO It doesn‚Äôt. Not having proof does not mean a statement is a lie. It just means it can‚Äôt be proven as true. Otherwise, every failed prosecution would get charged for perjury.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO If I told you I had a bagel for breakfast this morning, I have absolutely no way to prove it. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I didn‚Äôt have one for breakfast.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO No, she will try to prove that she‚Äôs telling the truth. If she can‚Äôt prove it, it doesn‚Äôt make her a liar, it just means there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to prove she‚Äôs telling the truth. You can say a true statement and not be able to prove it. Doesn‚Äôt make it a lie.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO And you have every right to think that. But neither you nor I know for a fact that she‚Äôs lying.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO In our justice system, if you don‚Äôt have proof you don‚Äôt have a case. But a lack of proof is not equal to lying. So unless if Jacob has proof that she‚Äôs making it up, he is a hypocrite.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO She might not have any. A lack of proof doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs lying, it just means she can‚Äôt prove it‚Äôs true.
@BostonGirl_4Eva @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO Correct. But not having proof doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean she‚Äôs lying either. So for Jacob to call her a liar without having any proof that she‚Äôs a liar is hypocritical.
@BostonGirl_4Eva @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO The number of years or number of sexual partners is irrelevant to whether she‚Äôs telling the truth or not.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO He‚Äôs not claiming she doesn‚Äôt have proof. He‚Äôs claiming she‚Äôs making it up. How does he know she‚Äôs making it up? What proof does he have that she‚Äôs lying?
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO Again, I understand. I‚Äôm only talking about Jacob‚Äôs hypocrisy, not the legal ramifications of what Kavanaugh‚Äôs accuser is saying.
The matter of when a sexual assault victim decides to come forward is irrelevant to the veracity of their claim. Whether it was 1 or 100 years ago doesn‚Äôt make it less true or less important.
@djvrobin @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO I understand that. But he is claiming she is making it up because she doesn‚Äôt have any proof. Yet Jacob has no proof that she‚Äôs making it up either. So he‚Äôs doing the same thing.
@BostonGirl_4Eva @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO Right, and that day could be today in this moment.
@BostonGirl_4Eva @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO It‚Äôs also pretty easy for a woman to get sexually assaulted. She could be telling the truth, she could be lying.
@BostonGirl_4Eva @JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO Nope. But I‚Äôd like to hear what she has to say. Him calling her a liar without proof is pretty hypocritical since it‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs doing.
@JacobAWohl @RealCandaceO Do you have any proof that she made it up?

@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt It‚Äôs not a belief, it‚Äôs factual. If you want evidence of open discrimination towards black people, all you need to do is look at this conversation. I‚Äôm done.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt You said they aren‚Äôt being openly discriminated against. And no, it‚Äôs not a myth. Not just the police, but the whole judicial system is discriminatory against African Americans. Conviction rates, incarceration rates, etc.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Ok but I‚Äôve never denied that racism against white people exists. On the contrary, you‚Äôre telling me that African Americans aren‚Äôt discriminated against openly. If you want to talk examples, we can take a look at treatment by the police, for one.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Why the need to resort to name calling?
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt I wholeheartedly disagree. There are countless examples of African Americans being openly discriminated against regardless if they are on Twitter or not. To deny it is racist in itself. I won‚Äôt be blocking you though.
@LiberalLogic70 @VP Going back to that article, the costs mostly come from state and local governments educating children. So that‚Äôs not something you can really remove. Also those tax burdens come back around in economic benefits we receive from immigrants.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt You don‚Äôt believe African Americans are discriminated openly against currently? Honestly I don‚Äôt know enough about Israel to say one way or the other, but I would imagine so, yes.
@LiberalLogic70 @VP I found the article you‚Äôre referring to. This is talking about immigration as a whole, not illegal immigration. It also found that White House statement to be misleading. Still though, why would that cost disappear?
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Interesting. Along with experiencing more racism, do you believe that white people have it harder in this country than people of color as well?
@LiberalLogic70 @VP Where are you getting that figure from? And why would that cost disappear?
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Do you think that‚Äôs always been the case throughout American history? If not, when did that balance shift?
@VP How are you going to pay for it?
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt So in your opinion, racism in America exists only against whites and not against people of color?
@CNET Damn, Amazon owns tribes now too?
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt The laws aren‚Äôt as explicit as what you‚Äôre looking for, but I have no obligation to explain to you how racism is systematic in America. That‚Äôs clearly a lost cause. I don‚Äôt know too much about Israel, but it seems like both sides there hate each other plenty.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Yes, there is institutional racism done by white people. Not sure why your issue with the NYT editor would affect that or prevent you from admitting that.
@SPQR43961077 @prageru @thewillwitt Do you expect me to deny racism against white people exists? Of course it does. It‚Äôs just not a systemic issue like other forms of racism.

@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant I‚Äôm done. Not sure if it‚Äôs the inbreeding or what, but you Browns fans are way too stupid and delusional to even have a conversation with. I‚Äôd rather talk to a Steelers fan. Enjoy your 6-10 season.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Nope, you never responded to my tweet that was football-related.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant You never responded to my tweet, so that isn‚Äôt me raising any white flags. I love how once you lose this argument, you just jump to ‚Äúwow you can‚Äôt stay on subject!‚Äù Nice cop out.
@DezToTheBrowns @JmickSports @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Nope, I had a separate tweet that was on subject. You can clearly see that. Beta shit.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is not incorrect here. I‚Äôm not sure why you would even think that. I also didn‚Äôt change the subject, I replied on-subject in a separate tweet. You chose to respond to the one about grammar.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant The fact that you didn‚Äôt call anyone in particular dumb is irrelevant. You called someone (again, doesn‚Äôt matter who or how many) dumb and then made an easy grammatical mistake. Yes, I would love to argue grammar.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Yes, calling people dumb means that you are calling people dumb. So for you to call people dumb but not know how to use the correct form of a word is pretty ironic. You‚Äôre making it pretty clear who the dumb one is (notice how I spelled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù the correct way).
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant How is that not calling people dumb? You really need to interpret what you say before you decide to write back.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant You can‚Äôt call someone dumb and then have a shitty grammar mistake in the same sentence. Kinda defeats your point. Also I argued back in a separate tweet, so that point is moot.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant We can talk about the now all you want. We can talk about how your team is coming off an 0-16, with improvements that should garner more wins, but not enough to win the division. Instead, you want to be delusional and the annoying overconfident fan that everyone hates.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant I consider someone who can‚Äôt spell the correct form of ‚Äútheir‚Äù to be a dumb fan.
@Rtp714 @JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Yes, he wanted a one-year deal.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Of course, as a Browns fan you have to be an ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù fan. You have no good moments to dwell on. I‚Äôm not even trying to live on past championships, just past success. Not sure if you recognize that word though.
@JmickSports @DezToTheBrowns @SEVEN0HTWO @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Ok but right now, what highlights do you like to watch? What player? I‚Äôm sure those Joe Thomas highlights are a great watch.

Coming from a 0-16 season, I think it‚Äôs probably you who should be waiting and seeing rather than trying to make these crazy claims. You‚Äôre more likely to eat your words than me.
@afbizzhop @DezToTheBrowns @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant The Ravens did better than the Browns last year.
@DezToTheBrowns @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant You went 0-16. Were there improvements? Sure. Not enough to win you the AFC North. Not even close. Get your head out of the clouds.
@AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Hahahahahahahahahaha
@DezToTheBrowns @AnthonyIde33 @DezBryant Doesn‚Äôt matter, your organization is such trash they still won‚Äôt be able to win the division.

@Aus10Smithh @pseudosapian @ShaneGoldmacher When you‚Äôre dying and need emergency care, you don‚Äôt have the choice to say no. That being said, their system is not perfect either. But still all things considered, they have a better standard of living than we do.
@Aus10Smithh @pseudosapian @ShaneGoldmacher Having to break your bank to pay for healthcare or being in debt over student loans for decades isn‚Äôt economic freedom either. Still though, they aren‚Äôt in poverty and their standard of living is better than ours.
@Aus10Smithh @pseudosapian @ShaneGoldmacher Poverty is also measured, so even with higher taxes these people are not suffering economically. What they give is returned to them in the form of essential services that are worth the taxes they pay. They have plenty of economic freedom.
@Aus10Smithh @pseudosapian @ShaneGoldmacher Correct. A lot of these factors are measured per capita, but yes, a higher population makes it harder to maintain a higher standard of living. This does nothing to refute my original point that America does not have the highest standard of living.
@p_jeanne97 @Aus10Smithh @ShaneGoldmacher How convenient to be able to clarify a statement after being called out on its bullshit. Like why even throw in the Republican thing if he was just talking about the Constitution from the beginning?
@pseudosapian @Aus10Smithh @ShaneGoldmacher I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúnuh uh,‚Äù all I said was that it‚Äôs not the country with the highest standard of living. Depends what criteria you want to focus on, but just about every list doesn‚Äôt have the US even close to first. Here‚Äôs one just as an example: https://t.co/YCq5CuqKtp
@Aus10Smithh @ShaneGoldmacher Okay, so you think the constitution and its values have been great for hundreds of years. Probably should be more specific, especially when responding to the original statement which was talking about America as a whole.
@pseudosapian @Aus10Smithh @ShaneGoldmacher It‚Äôs not. It should and could be but it‚Äôs not.
@Aus10Smithh @ShaneGoldmacher Correct. So would you like to change your statement that it wasn‚Äôt great?

@rikset1964 @realDonaldTrump He was elite. Is not any more. Has the potential to be again.
@rikset1964 @realDonaldTrump Ah dang it, ya got me.

@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Yeah you could argue that is discrimination.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones What ideology are they discriminating against?
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Discriminating against a group of people systematically is illegal. The difference here being that they aren‚Äôt doing that.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones It has absolutely no obligation not to censor people. It has every right, as a company, to censor anyone it wants to. That‚Äôs what you allow by choosing to use their service. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt use it.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Yep, it does. Every website with a public forum in the history of the internet has been banning or censoring as they see fit since the existence of the internet. All perfectly legal.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones You can threaten to sue over anything. Until you win, it means nothing. This applies to so much more than social media. If a sports team ejects you because you racially heckled a player, is that a violation too?
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones I think there are plenty of good reasons to do it in some cases. Still totally legal.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Letting a case continue isn‚Äôt the same as winning a case.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Who has won a free speech case against a social media company censoring someone?
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones What law?
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones That‚Äôs a separate debate. Right now we‚Äôre debating the legality of it. And we shouldn‚Äôt be, since it is so clearly legal for them to do so.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones I might disagree with their decision but disagreeing with it and thinking it‚Äôs illegal are two different things.
@GeorgeF32485891 @RealCandaceO @jaketapper @TPUSA @CNN This isn‚Äôt newsworthy enough.
@RealCandaceO @jaketapper @TPUSA @CNN He has no obligation to report on you being yelled at.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones He wants to be perceived as being unbiased in who he censors. But he of course has the right to censor anyone he wants on his website. If you created a blog, you could delete any comments you didn‚Äôt like, right?
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones It means the government cannot censor you. Not private companies. Just read the First Amendment, please. I‚Äôll wait for you to cite a law they are breaking.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Right, they met about censorship. They were concerned about who Facebook was censoring and if it was biased. Still, nothing to do with free speech. Please cite the law that they break by censoring on their websites.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones That wasn‚Äôt what they met about.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones It‚Äôs a private company and they can censor anyone they want to. You are so very wrong here. The First Amendment doesn‚Äôt say that companies can‚Äôt censor you. Of course they can, and for any reason they want to.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones No, it‚Äôs not. The first amendment protects you from being prosecuted from stating your opinion (with a few exceptions). It applies to public places. No one can silence you in public. Twitter is a company and can absolutely censor you if they want to.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Yes. In a privately owned space like Facebook or Twitter, both you as a user or them as a company can silence anyone they want. And yes, it is censorship and it‚Äôs 100% legal.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones I never said he didn‚Äôt. But legally, social media companies like Facebook can block or censor anyone they want.
@BobAdam81350349 @RealAlexJones Censorship and what social media deems as offensive or hate-filled material. Controversial? Yes. But has nothing to do with the 1st Amendment.
@RealAlexJones It has nothing to do with free speech.
@sportspickle Look, I know we don‚Äôt have the best unis in the NFL, but there are better targets here. Steelers bumblebee uniforms are waaaaay worse.

@MrTarbash @infowars It‚Äôs all good man, I can take it. I might be a liberal but I‚Äôm not a snowflake. We do exist haha.
@WhiteHouse If only we had some kind of plan to prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons.
@MrTarbash @infowars Thanks, you as well. See, no need for the name calling! Having a civil debate is much better, no matter how much we might disagree.
@MrTarbash @infowars I can agree that it‚Äôs a grey area for international law. In terms of just the Constitution though, social media companies are not obligated to protect speech and do not break any laws by censoring anyone they want for any reason. Whether they should or not is a separate debate.
@MrTarbash @infowars We‚Äôre talking about the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment, not the UN.
@MrTarbash @infowars Incorrect, no one is entitled to express themselves online. If a website doesn‚Äôt like your opinion, they are not obligated to protect it. I‚Äôm not arguing for or against censorship here. That‚Äôs a separate argument. My point is that they have the right to censor you.
@MrTarbash @infowars You haven‚Äôt even provided a coherent counterargument here. I‚Äôm not offended by anything you‚Äôve said. So, again, please tell me how I‚Äôm wrong. Still waiting on that.
@MrTarbash @infowars You can point it out if you want, but so far you‚Äôve only shown that you‚Äôre the idiot here.
@MrTarbash @infowars That argument doesn‚Äôt really work when you tweet in between my response and you responding back to me.
@TheRealMarkyPea @Monteveritasnp @infowars We can argue about what Facebook should or should not censor. Those can make for legitimate arguments. But freedom of speech has absolutely nothing to do with it.
@Monteveritasnp @infowars Talking about the U.S. obviously.
@MrTarbash @infowars Your freedom of speech is intact regardless if Twitter or Facebook removes your profile.
@MrTarbash @infowars What part of this are you not understanding? Free speech does not apply to social media. You can say whatever you want (with some exceptions) in public. But companies have no obligation to let you say whatever you want. That‚Äôs not how this works.
@MrTarbash @infowars Waiting...
Really don‚Äôt understand what it is about free speech and social media that conservatives don‚Äôt understand. Social media companies can censor anyone they want. Free speech is irrelevant.
@MrTarbash @infowars Tell me how I‚Äôm wrong if you can.
@Monteveritasnp @infowars Because it‚Äôs a private company and they can censor anyone they want. Free speech applies to the legality to be able to say what you want, particularly in public. Any social media company can censor anyone they want legally.
@infowars Why is it so hard to understand that this has nothing to do with free speech?

@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Agreed. I‚Äôm not saying we should disregard the threat of Islamic terrorism. But we also shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions based on someone‚Äôs religion. Doing that can lead to many many problems.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs dangerous to think that way and not fair to do to anyone. No matter how much sense you think it might make, it does make you a bigot. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you choose to recognize it as bigotry or not.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods I mean with stuff like this all you have to do is wait for the information to come out. When you base a conclusion, no matter how probable it is, based off someone‚Äôs race/religion alone, that‚Äôs bigotry. That‚Äôs how racial profiling occurs.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Okay but just because something is probable doesn‚Äôt make it absolute. So I wouldn‚Äôt have had a problem with you saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely ISIS-inspired‚Äù but to make that conclusion without knowing for sure is irresponsible.
@FoxBusiness @POTUS When did that start?
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Never said you were wrong, just said there was a chance you could have been wrong.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods That isn‚Äôt how deductive reasoning works. You don‚Äôt deduce based on probabilities. You deduce based on what you know can‚Äôt be true and in this case you didn‚Äôt know for sure.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Absolutely. But there was the possibility that he could have just been mentally ill and not inspired by ISIS. That makes it relevant.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Correct. And you‚Äôre ruling out the possibility that his mental issues were the cause of this shooting and not his religion. The reason you‚Äôre ruling that out is because of his name.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods How can that possibly be irrelevant?
@RepKHandel When did it start?
@JackPosobiec People know when that‚Äôs fake. That‚Äôs labeled as satire. Not the same.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods A good deducer would not readily rule out possibilities like that. You clearly have no grasp on how to actually deductively reason.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods I understand what deductive reasoning is. You need to rule out conclusions in order to deduce. You are deducing the possibility that this is mental illness simply because of his name. That‚Äôs wrong. That‚Äôs bigoted.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Correct. I‚Äôm not denying the existence of Islamic terrorism. But it‚Äôs wrong to make the assumption that this is because of his religion and start stating it as fact.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Not extremely probable. It still doesn‚Äôt matter how probable it is anyway, you just claiming it‚Äôs because of his religion is wrong without any solid evidence to back it up. You aren‚Äôt remaining open to the idea that it could just be mental illness alone.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Your motive is based off him having a Muslim name. That makes you a bigot. Your deductions aren‚Äôt based on evidence, just on a preconceived notion you have about Muslims.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods Correct. You can have both or just one. But neither of us know exactly what the case was. Yes, they said he seemed normal. Not the same as ‚Äúdefinitely had no mental illness‚Äù People can seem normal but actually be mentally ill.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods The difference here being that there‚Äôs actual evidence of you being a bigot. I‚Äôm not calling you one for no reason.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You‚Äôre ruling out the possibility that he could have had a mental illness simply because of his name. That isn‚Äôt deductive reasoning. Also what you just said is bullshit: https://t.co/VUwUd7JO95
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You‚Äôve showed you‚Äôre a bigot. You haven't produced a single ounce of evidence that he was inspired by his religion. You‚Äôre basing it solely off of his name and from InfoWars (actual fake news). So there‚Äôs the conclusion, no jumping.
I feel like Pro Football Focus always gives the Ravens the respect you never see anywhere else. https://t.co/za72eRSYuk
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You need a more reputable source than a conspiracy website. Also I never ruled out that he was religiously motivated, I just didn‚Äôt jump to conclusions like a bigot would.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You know nothing about me or the Toronto shooter. You judging someone solely off of their name is what makes you a bigot. I‚Äôd expect nothing less coming from a Trump supporter though.
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You just look at someone‚Äôs last name and make every assumption don‚Äôt you?
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods You aren‚Äôt sane or normal. Most people aren‚Äôt like you, thankfully.
@bellabac @RealJamesWoods You can‚Äôt seem to answer a simple question.
@bellabac @RealJamesWoods What truth is that?
@donsteaks @RealJamesWoods So is every religion but you‚Äôre just assuming because of his name that this is religiously motivated. That makes you a bigot.

@saiwarlord @FoxNews @POTUS Paul Manafort has deep connections to Russia. He was Trump‚Äôs campaign manager. The point of an investigation is to, ya know, investigate. I like how I can admit we should investigate Hillary equally but you of course want us to lay off your precious baby Trump. You have no morals
@NaturallyKatz Schoop?

@saiwarlord @FoxNews @POTUS Sure, investigate it all. I think it‚Äôs less relevant since she isn‚Äôt president. I think had she won, this is what your side would be talking about. So investigate both her and Trump. Meanwhile, can you say the same?

@aceh20000 @BillyHallowell Certainly complicated. I just want people to understand that pro-choice isn‚Äôt pro-murder, because we don‚Äôt perceive the fetuses as being alive yet. But anyway thanks for keeping it civil.
@aceh20000 @BillyHallowell It‚Äôs close enough to being a life that it feels wrong. But I still wouldn‚Äôt call it murder or taking a life. It‚Äôs just too close for comfort.
@aceh20000 @BillyHallowell I guess the thought of it being a day before birth makes me uneasy. But we have to put a definition on when something is alive, and to me that is defined at birth.
@aceh20000 @BillyHallowell I don‚Äôt see it as killing a living thing. To live means to be born. I understand how others might feel differently. But I think there‚Äôs a misconception that pro-choice people think of it as being okay with killing a living thing. We don‚Äôt feel that way.

@aceh20000 @NiceGuyMike27 @BillyHallowell Yeah I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant either

@MAGA__MIKE Or we could just not separate them and treat them humanely. Will you admit now that this was Trump‚Äôs policy though? I think it‚Äôs important that everyone understand that and not misconstrue it.
@MAGA__MIKE It was never a law, just a policy, that yes, he did create. It was part of his ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy. Keeping families together isn‚Äôt special treatment.
@MAGA__MIKE After he created it the policy to do so. He cleaned up his own mess.
@MAGA__MIKE That law doesn‚Äôt apply to children who travel with family. We‚Äôre not talking about unaccompanied minors here. The policy to separate children from their family‚Äôs was created and enforced by the Trump administration.
@MAGA__MIKE You can investigate without a full separation. And yes, I know we don‚Äôt beat them or put them in literal cages.
@MAGA__MIKE Again, that‚Äôs not true. Trump created the policy of separating parents from their children. Also just because it‚Äôs law, doesn‚Äôt make it humane. I‚Äôm asking you personally when mistreatment would go too far for you, if separating children with disabilities isn‚Äôt too far.
@MAGA__MIKE That‚Äôs not true. Family separation began and ended with Trump.
@MAGA__MIKE Depends on the country. I would suggest humane laws everywhere. Again though, and I‚Äôm not trying to berate you but genuinely curious, where do you draw the line on what is humane and what is not?
@MAGA__MIKE We can do that without separating them. No, that wouldn't be better. Can you answer my question though? If separating children with disabilities isn't too severe for you, what is? Where do you draw the line? Or is everything fair game since they are coming here illegally?
@MAGA__MIKE I mean at what point of mistreatment would you start saying ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt treat them like that even if they broke the law‚Äù compared to ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt want to be treated like that, they shouldn‚Äôt break the law‚Äù What degree of severity?
@MAGA__MIKE Not all have gotten their parents back. Yes, that would be different. I would be in much better care. Someone breaking the law doesn‚Äôt entitle us to treat them however we want, especially inhumanely.
@MAGA__MIKE No. Children should not be separated from their parents, especially those with disabilities who gravely need their parents. And you, or anyone, should feel bad for that child regardless if what their parents did was illegal.
@MAGA__MIKE @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm asking you if you have sympathy for a child with down syndrome being separated from their parents, all things considered.
It‚Äôs about damn time someone nominated a Christian white guy to the Supreme Court. #Overdue
This is the fundamental difference between Liberals and Conservatives; empathy. https://t.co/HHRBwxiubW
@MAGA__MIKE @realDonaldTrump So the answer to my question is no, you have no sympathy for a child with down syndrome being separated from his/her parents.
@MAGA__MIKE @realDonaldTrump A disabled person being separated from their parents should affect your emotions. Are you unable to have any ounce of sympathy for them?
@MAGA__MIKE @realDonaldTrump Really? What was the ‚Äúwhomp whomp‚Äù in reference to?
@Jennilootoo @realDonaldTrump Weak
@Jennilootoo @realDonaldTrump That all you‚Äôve got?

@ARTiculatedMind @good_cooke @WalshFreedom No, we don‚Äôt have to agree.

We view it as a woman making a choice with her own body.
@good_cooke @ARTiculatedMind @WalshFreedom I think this is the fundamental disagreement people like you and me have. I don‚Äôt consider it murdering children. But I guess neither of us will change each other‚Äôs mind on that point.
@good_cooke @WalshFreedom Well it‚Äôs not really a child until it‚Äôs born but yes, abortions are disturbing for everyone. But how disturbing something is doesn‚Äôt mean we can dictate whether someone has that choice.
@WalshFreedom Nobody has a problem with her making that choice. But nobody else should make that choice for her or anyone.

@beachlifenow @ADmomof3 @redsteeze The conditions of the countries they are fleeing are awful and the US has better conditions. That doesn‚Äôt mean our president should be calling them shithole countries.
@JustinRWalton @ADmomof3 @redsteeze You aren‚Äôt them. If entering legally was easier, they would do it. The conditions of the country they are coming from are still worse than being separated. It still doesn‚Äôt make it ok for us to do it.

@redsteeze You can keep nitpicking what I say, but you still have yet to admit that separating children from their families is worse no matter what the conditions are. Would think that would be a pretty easy thing to do.
@NotReallyABear2 @redsteeze These are families. So I might suggest a room with real walls. It doesn‚Äôt have to be nice, but people shouldn‚Äôt feel like animals. Do you disagree?
@roguerepub @redsteeze Better does not imply that either are good.
@NotReallyABear2 @redsteeze Of course not. I just think they should be detained in a humane fashion. Cages are not humane.
@0ryuge @redsteeze Agreed. I wish I knew about it earlier. I would have been opposed to it then had I known. Totally unfair of Stephen to say that I don‚Äôt object to it.
@redsteeze I just said I objected to it. You‚Äôre just going to assume I‚Äôm ok with it because I pointed out the difference between now and 2014? It‚Äôs awful that they are in cages but being separated is worse. Are you unable to admit that?

@jasonf31610225 @JackPosobiec I agree on not expecting him to bash him because it‚Äôs a very sensitive situation. But then to praise him like Trump did I thought was too much. North Korea has more to lose here than we do.
@jasonf31610225 @JackPosobiec Fair enough, it‚Äôs certainly not the same as him saluting him outright. Still I think he shouldn‚Äôt have done it. I doubt the general or Kim expected him to return a salute.
@TheCat09231543 @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump This isn‚Äôt minuscule
@jasonf31610225 @JackPosobiec Good will is certainly important but I think there needs to be a line drawn for when we give too much respect for someone who deserves none. In my opinion, saluting a North Korean general crosses that line. But perhaps you disagree.

@jasonf31610225 @JackPosobiec I don‚Äôt believe you.
@CypressRozay We aren‚Äôt going to get nuked because of our president not returning a salute to a general.
@CypressRozay Diplomacy and saluting a general of a dictatorship are two different things. Don‚Äôt pretend that if Obama did it you wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it.
@jasonf31610225 @JackPosobiec He has no obligation to salute back. If Obama did that, would you honestly be defending him in the same way?
@JackPosobiec Not the same as a salute. At all. Why can‚Äôt Trump supporters admit when he does something wrong?
A bunch of casual World Cup fans are about to find out that the US didn‚Äôt qualify.
@JackPosobiec One is an enemy dictatorship and one is an ally. Easy.

@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest The flag represented that. You just admitted you don‚Äôt disagree with the Nazi flag. They did the worst acts in human history. What the fuck is wrong with you?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest This comparison would only be valid if the team fought for their support of domestic violence and was disbanded because of it. Had the Confederacy survived, adapted, and admitted their mistakes, then that would make a difference here.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Ok but in your opinion, you disagree with the Nazi flag, right? I understand you are not forcing your beliefs on anyone.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Such a ridiculous argument anyway. If the Ravens stood for domestic violence as one of their tenets, then I wouldn‚Äôt be a fan of their team. Instead, they got rid of Ray Rice when that tape emerged. Neither of us know if Ray Lewis murdered anyone.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Can you answer my question? What‚Äôs the difference between the Nazi and Confederate flag?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Ok fine you still see it but it‚Äôs not flown like the Confederate flag in America. By your logic, it‚Äôs ok to fly that flag since they changed right?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Ok so now you‚Äôre trying to say it wasn‚Äôt about slavery at all? It was very clearly about both. The Confederacy was without a doubt in support of slavery, regardless of reason why.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Is there no other way to be proud of heritage without using a symbol that stands for the support of slavery?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest How come you don‚Äôt see the Nazi flag even though Germany changed?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest What‚Äôs that? They already do? It‚Äôs the American flag? Oh.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Which is why I have no problem with their state flags (except for those that contain the Confederate flag). The Confederacy is over, so it can‚Äôt change. If the South had a flag other than one for the Confederacy, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest In no way did I ever say it was solely about slavery. Meanwhile, you just told me they didn‚Äôt die trying to preserve slavery. It can be and was about both. But the fact that it was partly (notice how I didn‚Äôt say solely) about slavery, is enough to make it wrong.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Founded on it, yes. Of course back then it wasn‚Äôt the same flag. But they adapted and changed. The difference is the Confederacy died trying to preserve slavery.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze The NRA didn‚Äôt but the convention did. Thankfully they aren‚Äôt letting just any ordinary person bring a gun in. That would be insane.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze The convention banning it is not the same as the NRA banning it.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze I can see how it‚Äôs misleading and it probably should be written better. But I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs not true either.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze Actually it said the NRA Convention bans guns. And it‚Äôs clearly talking about how attendees are not allowed to bring guns in. Of course everyone knows and knew that the Secret Service and other law enforcement would be armed and present.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest It was and is an icon for the Confederacy. The Confederacy was pro slavery. It doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone wants to pretend it means to them now. That‚Äôs simply what it is. Displaying it proudly is racist regardless if they are pro-slavery or not.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze You replied to me telling me the article isn‚Äôt true.
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest I have never said that it was fought solely over slavery. I disagree that it was more about money than slavery. Regardless, the fact that it was a part of it at all renders the Confederate flag as an icon for pro-slavery, whether anyone wants it to be or not.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze I think both sides agree that trained armed personnel make venues safer. But fair enough that the SS is making the call and not the NRA. It‚Äôs still true though that the public is not allowed to bring weapons into the NRA‚Äôs own convention.
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze Right but I think the point is the NRA doesn‚Äôt trust ordinary people with guns at their own event. I will concede that saying ‚Äúguns are banned from the convention" is misleading since law enforcement will have guns.
@SethSolomon21 @benshapiro @kanyewest Before delving in to that, by making that point you are essentially telling me that just because I live in the North and tell you it isn‚Äôt racist, doesn‚Äôt make it true, right?
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze By ‚Äúonly the good guys‚Äù do you mean trained law enforcement?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Slavery was not the entire reason but it was a major reason. That way of life was an awful way of life and is nothing to be proud of. You might not care about that flag but plenty of southerners do.
@SethSolomon21 @benshapiro @kanyewest You don‚Äôt have to live somewhere to know that it‚Äôs racist. Using your logic, I live in the North, and if I say I know it isn‚Äôt racist, doesn‚Äôt that dispel your point about the North being racist just as well?
@SeahawkBurrrton @redsteeze How so?
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest It had to do with both. But the fact that it was about slavery (notice how it shouldn‚Äôt be in quotes), should be enough to disqualify the use of that flag.
@SethSolomon21 @benshapiro @kanyewest At least I‚Äôm not too stupid to know the difference between to and too. The fact that you claim you aren‚Äôt racist does nothing to dispel the fact that the South is still racist. What a great try though!
@SethSolomon21 @xDavidWooderson @benshapiro @kanyewest Again, your personal experience is completely irrelevant here. It‚Äôs pretty clear to see based on the South‚Äôs resistance to Confederate statue removals that they are still racist. And that‚Äôs just one example.
@SethSolomon21 @benshapiro @kanyewest Also considering that in your bio you think that anthem protestors ‚Äúhate the country,‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure I believe you that you aren‚Äôt racist.
@SethSolomon21 @benshapiro @kanyewest First of all, you‚Äôre just one person. Secondly, if you could care less that means you do care.
@benshapiro @kanyewest Yeah, sure, the South isn‚Äôt racist anymore. Get the fuck out of here.

@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen How is that in any way, shape, or form racist?
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen I know enough from our conversation to know that you lack empathy. I can say that with confidence.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen You‚Äôre absolutely right, sometimes people do create their own problems. But for many many people, especially African Americans, it‚Äôs just simply not the case and to deny that just isn‚Äôt fair.
@Ndymium6 @twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Absolutely true. Please do try to remember though that the majority of us did not vote for this guy. I‚Äôd like to think most Americans are good people despite our current leadership.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen You‚Äôre right, it doesn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs a start and it‚Äôs better than not caring. And it leads to helping.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen You‚Äôre not empathetic because you‚Äôre not empathetic. Your views also don‚Äôt line up with mine, but it‚Äôs not what makes your views non-empathetic.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen You don‚Äôt have to be a Democrat to care about other people. But by blaming victims for their circumstances, you show that you don‚Äôt care about other people. You should be ashamed of yourself.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Taking away environmental protections does inadvertently hurt African American populations more. It isn‚Äôt racially motivated but it‚Äôs a consequence to Trump‚Äôs political actions.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen You don‚Äôt conform to a view that cares about other people. Having empathy doesn‚Äôt put you on a pedestal, it just makes you a decent person. Honestly this is just really sad and I do truly feel bad for you.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Nope, not a hero. Just someone with a conscience.
RT @dicknenbow: we crave a different kind of buzz https://t.co/G41iD3w4vH
@Ndymium6 @twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Exactly. I didn‚Äôt want to say that though since she‚Äôs all about ‚Äúindividual cases‚Äù haha. But you‚Äôre absolutely right.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Nope. Just a white guy who cares about and recognizes other people‚Äôs problems other than ones that affect myself personally. Its what separates you from me.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Nothing racist about what he said. I‚Äôm white, and I recognize that my whiteness can blind me from seeing racism right in front of me and certainly limits my ability to truly understand what non-white people go through. I try to understand as best as I can despite my skin color.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen I agree that some people are watering it down by calling it out when it‚Äôs not. However, this is not one of those cases.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Very curious to your answer here...
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Oh true, he has a smart phone, I guess racism is dead and everything is ok
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen What evidence would there need to be for you to believe that they are actual victims and not just people looking for someone to blame for their problems?
@twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Stop making my arguments into blanket statements, because they‚Äôre not. There are times when the government protects us. Other times they fail us, as in some cases with the police. But to say the government doesn‚Äôt protect us is not true, clearly.
@godbout36 @twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Right, I never said that. She argued that government doesn‚Äôt protect people. My argument is that our tap water is clean thanks to the government. So yes, our government does protect us in some ways.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Nah, it‚Äôs the other way around. You‚Äôre a racist so I hate your opinion. I‚Äôm not a victim here, but at least I‚Äôm standing up for the real victims instead of denying the fact that they‚Äôre victims.
@Ndymium6 @twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen It‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt reply in the first place but since you guys jumped in and she made it just too easy to argue against her, I couldn‚Äôt help myself. But yeah really not worth any of our time. A lost cause sadly.
@godbout36 @twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen I responded to her about government protection. I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Oh really, you were talking about Marxists here? https://t.co/rg504kxxVy
@twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen The government has a plethora of issues and is far from perfect but it definitely protects us in many ways. Not sure how you can deny that.
@twisterwoman88 @godbout36 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Please tell me why you weren‚Äôt robbed at gun point today if the government doesn‚Äôt protect you. Or why you knew your food didn‚Äôt contain poison.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen No, not everything is racist. But what you said is. And yeah, the government failed in Flint, absolutely. Luckily that isn‚Äôt true for the entire country. And nobody here is saying that everything is racially motivated.
@godbout36 @twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen What are you even talking about? I‚Äôm counter arguing her claim that the government doesn‚Äôt protect us.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Furthermore, your argument that African Americans (or anyone for that matter) want to be oppressed is ridiculous and incredibly racist. I don‚Äôt call everything racist by the way, just racist things like what you just said.
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen If you ‚Äúcould give a shit‚Äù that means you do care about his skin color. So...
@godbout36 @twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Ok well despite your weird personal experience, most people can drink their tap water safely thanks to governmental protection. Same reason the air you breathe isn‚Äôt smog-ridden. For now anyway...
@Ndymium6 @twisterwoman88 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @godbout36 @chrissyteigen Exactly. No one here said it was racially motivated, it‚Äôs just that Trump‚Äôs policies affect African American populations for the worse, not the better. He‚Äôs racist for other reasons tho, don‚Äôt worry
@twisterwoman88 @Ndymium6 @godbout36 @KarunChandran @Mxstr @chrissyteigen Is your tap water clean?

@wrede @mitchellvii Yup. I looked at this profile from a separate browser, looks like he deleted all of his tweets with me too. Pretty funny.

@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii *about being politically blind
@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii I didn‚Äôt come here to argue for my side. You and I clearly don‚Äôt see eye to eye on much. What you think about the Dems is what I think about Republicans. I‚Äôve made my point about politically blind. Beyond that let‚Äôs just agree to disagree on issues.
@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii Well since I‚Äôm a Democrat I would obviously disagree with you but I respect your ability to think and vote independently. If the Democrats strayed from my views, I would do the same.
@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii The fact that you‚Äôre able to admit that there are things you don‚Äôt like makes you better and less blind than @mitchellvii
@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii I mean we clearly disagree politically but I‚Äôm able to admit there are things I like about him just as much as I would admit there were things I did not like about Obama. My point here is to not have blind loyalty, even if you agree with a leader most of the time.
@AnnetteSN01 Really confused why you would just copy his tweet but ok.
@wrede @mitchellvii Thanks. I‚Äôm not really sure why he‚Äôs being such a dick when my question wasn‚Äôt even insulting.
@realist2016jlp @mitchellvii Instead of assuming my answer, why not just ask me and see? Although there hasn‚Äôt been any results yet, I like how he is interested in investing in our infrastructure. And I like how he has an interest in our space program.
@mitchellvii I don‚Äôt work at Starbucks. But it‚Äôs clear to me since you can‚Äôt answer this question that all you have is blind praise for him. Thanks for clearing that up for me.
@mitchellvii My job hasn‚Äôt changed since he‚Äôs been President. I‚Äôm genuinely curious though, do you have any legitimate complaints about Trump?

@thejackruark_ This whole conversation started with you calling me a dickhead. You kinda set the tone there.
@thejackruark_ Right but claiming that Parkland students called most gun owners ‚Äúmurdering savages‚Äù isn‚Äôt correct. It‚Äôs just calling a specific group of them that.

@thejackruark_ When did I insult you?

@thejackruark_ @mrlelz @CalebJHull Right, but that isn‚Äôt calling all legal gun owners child murderers. Just the ones in the NRA.
@thejackruark_ @mrlelz @CalebJHull The NRA does not speak for nor represent all gun owners. I understand how a Venn diagram works perfectly.
@thejackruark_ @mrlelz @CalebJHull No, you aren‚Äôt.

@Jbelt22 @lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull The purpose of the march wasn't to advocate against gun ranges. If LeBron owned these guns, then that would be hypocrisy. Shooting at a range doesn't contradict the message of the march. That's why it's not the same as your PETA analogy.
@YumaKangee @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Then why did you talk to me in the first place?
@lesley_stover @Jbelt22 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull I agree with you there. Unfortunately, many gun advocates see those checks and balances as an infringement on your right to own them. Which of course, it's not.
@jerrylieb12 @judgejustice5 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Ok well if he does own them then I would be the first person to call him a hypocrite for it.
@pirtle_jake @mrlelz @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Then you're paranoid.
@ImTheRealEggMan @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull You compared weed to guns, I think most people reading this are questioning your intelligence. But ok.
@Jbelt22 @lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull And gun control advocates feel that your right to own semi-automatic weapons is not worth the risk they create. But if you want to go shoot them in a range, who cares?
@5OClockShadow_ @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Right but that gun range owner has to go through a lot more than an ordinary individual to own those weapons for a shooting range.
@5OClockShadow_ @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull A really good point you've made here.
@YumaKangee @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Really well-thought-out argument there.
@Joe431990 The whole argument of gun control advocates like myself is that the second amendment isn't just a cover-all privilege to own any gun you want. It's about putting a check on those rights.
@lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull No.
@CitizensFRTrump @judgejustice5 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull I don't support Ray Rice, not sure why you would think that.
@CitizensFRTrump @CalebJHull What?
@browngravy_93 @thejackruark_ @swoonychic @esteban_ftw @PolisProject @CalebJHull Most people, including gun control advocates, don't advocate for that.
@Jbelt22 @lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Which is exactly why he isn't being hypocritical.
@travis_adcock @lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Is that true? Could you give me a source? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just unaware on that.
@ImTheRealEggMan @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull It doesn't fit the argument.
@ImTheRealEggMan @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull To compare weed to guns is pretty dumb, come on man.
@Maleandproud @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Exactly. Which is why it's not hypocritical of him to use it because the march wasn't even referring to this weapon.
@thejackruark_ @judgejustice5 @swoonychic @CalebJHull It was at least a more creative insult than most.
@swoonychic @PolisProject @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull If this was a march against firing guns then it would be pure hypocrisy. But this march was about gun control and limiting public ownership. Shooting at a shooting range, if anything, supports gun control. It's the most responsible way to use a gun.
@judgejustice5 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Never seen a need for hostility. Unfortunately it comes from both sides. I get the passion behind it, but it doesn't further the conversation nor help you understand a point of view different than your own.
@YumaKangee @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull How am I disturbed?
@jerrylieb12 @judgejustice5 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull I'm sure he does, but not the type of weapons he's using in those pictures.
@JakeGale14 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Nobody is arguing against gun ranges owning them. I think even the staunchest gun control advocates would be ok with it in that setting.
@baileylewis23 @PolisProject @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull No? A gun range is a highly regulated place and not nearly the same thing as a regular citizen owning one. If citizens had to go through the same process to own these weapons as a gun range, then maybe I would be ok with the general public owning them.
@ItsJustMe122 @honestmckenzie @CalebJHull Correct. The risk that you'll actually be in a situation where you need to defend your family is less than the risk it creates by allowing people to own them in the first place. A handgun will suffice.
@Joe431990 If NRA members do just about all of their shooting at ranges, why can't they just keep their weapons at the range? No one would have a problem with that.
@xYooper_ @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Of course him not being the owner means something. He isn't endangering anyone's lives by renting it at a range. Allowing for mass ownership of them creates a huge risk.
@ImTheRealEggMan @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull That's not even close to a fair comparison. Renting a gun in a controlled setting is far different than taking it home with you.
@lesley_stover @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull The gun range owns it. Myself and most gun control advocates don't have a problem with shooting at a range. It's individual ownership of these type of weapons that's the problem.
@KevinJa35040557 @CalebJHull I don't understand your point.
@PolisProject @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull I think most people would agree that a responsible gun range should be able to own these weapons. That's much different than the general public.
@judgejustice5 @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull True. The pictures part did not help. Not sure why he felt the need to do that.
@CsanBoySmith @PolisProject @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull What?
@Joe431990 @KingJames You aren‚Äôt right. I would love to tell you why you‚Äôre wrong (notice how I spelled that correctly), but I knew from the onset that you were too stupid to converse with. See ya
@paganaurora12 @CalebJHull Well of course but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs relevant here to this argument.
@thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Banning them from being owned, yeah. I don‚Äôt think anyone has a problem with them being used in a controlled setting like a range. If he owned the weapon, then yes, he would be a total hypocrite.
@PolisProject @swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull Ok the gun range owns it. I really don‚Äôt understand what point you‚Äôre trying to make here. He‚Äôs happy to pay to rent one but does not own the weapon.
@thejackruark_ @mrlelz @CalebJHull So if they are mostly using them at ranges, why not keep the guns there? They should not be labeled ‚Äúmurdering savages‚Äù regardless though.
@honestmckenzie @CalebJHull In a controlled setting in which he doesn‚Äôt own the gun.
@swoonychic @thejackruark_ @CalebJHull How is that hypocritical? Shooting at a gun range is not the same as owning it. Do you disagree with that?
@Joe431990 @KingJames Damn, I haven‚Äôt seen someone misuse the word ‚Äúthere‚Äù in two different ways in one sentence. Props to you.
@RiptideAgile Yes.
@thejackruark_ @CalebJHull I have no problem with these guns being used in a controlled setting such as a shooting range, and neither do most gun control advocates. But I do agree that the photoshoot with it was not a good look for a gun control advocate.
@ItsJustMe122 @CalebJHull Yes. He‚Äôs not taking it home with him.
@thejackruark_ @CalebJHull But he‚Äôs just shooting it at a range, he doesn‚Äôt own it.
@CalebJHull Shooting at a gun range doesn‚Äôt contradict supporting a gun control march.

@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews Fair enough. Perhaps it isn‚Äôt bullying but considering he is trying to teach his son not to bully, it‚Äôs a little too similar to what he‚Äôs trying to teach against.
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews Ok sure. It doesn‚Äôt make it any more relevant to teaching anti-bullying.
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews That wasn‚Äôt my point. Even if he tells him that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs doing it, having him run because of it has nothing to do with bullying. Making him apologize or do community service would instill empathy and create more effective change.
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews Rather than just teaching that actions have consequences, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to teach him why what he did was wrong, rather than just the fact that it was wrong?
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews Also physical punishment makes more sense in sports or military because the goal is to make your soldiers/team more fit. It does nothing for anti-bullying.
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews The fact that it isn‚Äôt a new practice is irrelevant to whether it‚Äôs moral or not.
@L4stTr4in0ut @AnitaM86 @nowthisnews Exactly. I‚Äôm not saying he shouldn‚Äôt be punished. I just don‚Äôt see this as the best way.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews Indeed. I would just hope that this punishment isn‚Äôt subconsciously fueling his inner fire and desire to bully more. Sometimes it can backfire. But no point in speculating I suppose.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews I agree it‚Äôs not extreme. There are far worse ways. I‚Äôm sure the father is not a bad guy. I just have a problem with the lesson it really teaches.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews He might have learned what he did was wrong. And I‚Äôm not saying the punishment was exceptionally cruel. It is just jogging after all. I just think there were better alternatives to his methods.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews Perhaps. I just believe a punishment should be relevant to the lesson you try to teach. To me, forcing your child to run in the rain doesn‚Äôt teach him that bullying is wrong. If anything, the opposite.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews So maybe this parent is not doing a very good job if it keeps happening.
@AnitaM86 @MissCherim @AutisticWeirdo @nowthisnews He was shown actions have consequences by being bullied himself. It doesn‚Äôt help him understand how bullying is bad, just that his behavior was bad.
@L4stTr4in0ut @AnitaM86 @nowthisnews I think leading by example or maybe having him do community service. I don‚Äôt see how forcing him to run in the rain sends a message that bullying is bad.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews Perhaps. None of us know this situation well enough to really accurately judge. I will say that uploading it to for the world to see is pretty cruel.
@SOULRIC4N @AnitaM86 @nowthisnews Nope, you‚Äôre choosing to do it. If someone else made you, then yes.
@washboard61 @nowthisnews Actually sitting down and talking to your child and helping him understand would be a good start. But there are other forms of punishment that don‚Äôt involve physical labor.
@FrankNunezIII @washboard61 @nowthisnews You don‚Äôt know a thing about me. Just because it‚Äôs a common punishment, doesn‚Äôt make it right.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews It‚Äôs forced. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs severe but it‚Äôs still a physical punishment. Maybe a heart to heart conversation would have been better.
@AnitaM86 @nowthisnews I disagree, I think physical punishment is a form of bullying.
@washboard61 @nowthisnews It‚Äôs one way to raise them. Not hard to see where he got his bullying tactics from.
@nowthisnews So he bullied him?

@MindOfCrucifix @suannelqr @RyanAFournier Did I say to remove an amendment? A law banning assault weapons would help deter mass shootings, including this one.
@MindOfCrucifix @suannelqr @RyanAFournier So maybe our laws should advance too.
So sick of this notion that it has to be either a gun issue or a mental health issue. It can be (and is) both.
@trcelectric25 @RyanAFournier Yes, them too. Although he was 19 so I'm not sure how involved the parents were here.
@sblmgtrmsl @RyanAFournier Because we‚Äôre talking about guns, not abortions. I‚Äôm not going to be baited into an abortion argument.
@sblmgtrmsl @RyanAFournier Holy shit what a completely irrelevant pivot
@ryanfisher122 @RyanAFournier Absolutely. But they aren‚Äôt free of blame.
If someone gave a four year old child the keys to their car, would you blame the child or the person giving the keys for anyone that got run over? You can‚Äôt just blame the shooter. #BlameTheNRA
@ravencottage1 @SRBB65 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier I have no idea what you mean by that.
@ryanfisher122 @RyanAFournier I blame the people who allowed this to be so easy. And I blame the shooter as well.
@MichaelWButler3 @SRBB65 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier The logic of that image is incredibly dumb.
@ravencottage1 @SRBB65 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier I wouldn‚Äôt prefer any of it. Knives are harder to kill people with, we make sure acid and explosives are harder to come across, and we license truck drivers.
@ravencottage1 @RyanAFournier The NRA is the only thing standing between us and a more peaceful country.
@pbeard1975 @RyanAFournier Correct. If I had a four year old and let them drive my car, blame the four year old for running over people, not me right?
@_Jrlh_ No, they won‚Äôt.
@BrandonBroadhu3 @kruse_jamie83 @RyanAFournier What if I told you that some decisions are good and some are bad and that no country is perfect?

@bonnieherchik @RyanAFournier Why do we have laws if criminals will just break them regardless?
@SRBB65 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier I‚Äôm not saying that all people with guns kill people, don‚Äôt get that misconstrued. People kill other people easier with guns. It‚Äôs not the guns themselves, but it‚Äôs not just people either.
@AustinJude98 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier We were mediocre this year.
@SRBB65 @Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier People with guns kill people.
@CarpeNoctemNews @RyanAFournier It was Republicans in the Senate who prevented it from being passed. Dems needed 60 votes. Admittedly 15 Dems did vote no on the assault ban, so the blame is on them as well.
@WeWonMAGA @RyanAFournier Why can‚Äôt it be mental health and guns?
@CarpeNoctemNews @RyanAFournier Correct. They tried passing an assault weapons ban and also universal background checks. Both failed in the Senate.
@WeWonMAGA @RyanAFournier Ok so what do you propose be done about it besides nothing?
@JessieIElizondo @RyanAFournier Ok so what do you propose be done about it besides nothing?
@CarpeNoctemNews @RyanAFournier Tried to pass a bill and failed due to Republicans.
@Fisher_Protocol @RyanAFournier Good one.
@RyanAFournier Bullshit. You blame the people who keep allowing these problems to happen. Blame the shooter, blame the NRA, and blame Republicans.
@RyanSTTrader Yeah but it wouldn‚Äôt be about the guns, they‚Äôd make it about refugees or something.

@jerztarheel I suppose so. Thanks for disagreeing with me in a civil manner. Wish all conversations could be like this.
@jerztarheel I‚Äôm not necessarily talking about ancestors. Just speaking as an American, I‚Äôm ashamed of some of the awful parts of our history, especially slavery. At the same time I‚Äôm proud of all the great things America has accomplished. If you‚Äôre going to be proud, you have to have shame 2
@jerztarheel White privilege definitely is not BS. Do you not feel proud of what America has accomplished even though you weren‚Äôt a part of it? WWII for example.
@One_True_Czar @jerztarheel That‚Äôs insane, it will never work!
@jerztarheel That‚Äôs a separate issue that has nothing to do with the naming of schools. And the notion that you have to be alive for something to be ashamed of it is ridiculous. As an American, I‚Äôm ashamed for a lot of what America has done historically. You should be too.
@jerztarheel @DailyCaller It's not erasing history. You don't learn history from school names, you learn in the schools. Also there are parts of American history to be ashamed of and the Confederacy is definitely one of them.

@The1Bolt @seanhannity It went through the same process and was voted down by Republicans. Shouldn‚Äôt you be concerned?
@The1Bolt @seanhannity Ok but Republicans voted for this memo to be declassified but also voted down a memo that refutes the Nunes memo. So shouldn‚Äôt you want to know all the facts?
@The1Bolt @seanhannity So then shouldn‚Äôt you be for all of the memos being released, and not just the ones Republicans voted to release?
@The1Bolt @seanhannity Wouldn't "Real Americans" be the majority of voters?
@1UnderGod @The1Bolt @seanhannity ‚Ä¶yikes
@Complex My dad yell at me :(
@The1Bolt @seanhannity Same could be said about your like of Trump and how it affects how you respond. Still though, when you say ‚ÄúReal Americans‚Äù who are you referring to?
@The1Bolt @seanhannity You‚Äôre correct on his approval rating, my mistake. And yes, you are also correct that he won by the rules established. I never contested that. The argument was whether ‚ÄúReal Americans‚Äù want this shit to stop. My point still stands that most Americans do want this.
@The1Bolt @seanhannity You can‚Äôt take out California, it exists. Also 31% is his approval rating, not the percentage of votes he received. Doesn‚Äôt matter, either way the majority of people either don‚Äôt vote for him nor approve of him.
@The1Bolt @seanhannity He lost the popular vote. He won the states where it mattered most. The majority of people don‚Äôt like Trump.
@The1Bolt @seanhannity No, they‚Äôre doing their job. The gap just got bigger. What do you mean by ‚ÄúReal Americans‚Äù? Are you referring to the 31% that approve of him? The majority of people want him to face consequences for his actions.
@The1Bolt @seanhannity The only affect this memo is going to have is to forge a larger mistrust between Trump and the intelligence community. If anything it made things worse for Trump. Wasn‚Äôt worth the risk.
@seanhannity After declaring this memo bigger than Watergate, I think you should probably remain silent.

@Real_GregoryLS @JohnWPike1995 @Redskins Sean Taylor was definitely more physical but INT‚Äôs have a much bigger impact than hard hits. Just compare those stats, it‚Äôs not even close. Taylor only beats him in tackles. There‚Äôs a reason Reed will be in the HoF.
@Real_GregoryLS @JohnWPike1995 @Redskins Ed Reed is the definition of a ball hawk. No one was better at picking off and reading QB‚Äôs than him. QBs avoided him and he still managed to put up more INTs than Taylor ever did. By your logic, safeties with the least INTs are the best.
@Real_GregoryLS @JohnWPike1995 @Redskins Just look at the stats. All Sean Taylor could do was hit hard. If he didn‚Äôt die, he would barely be remembered. Majority of people would easily agree that Reed was/is better than Taylor.
@Real_GregoryLS @JohnWPike1995 @Redskins He‚Äôs definitely better than Sean Taylor and would be even if he didn‚Äôt die. Who‚Äôs better?

@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise IÔ∏è think government programs could use a lot of improving. With the right people in charge and the proper funding, IÔ∏è think it could work. IÔ∏è don‚Äôt trust certain states to take care of their citizens like they deserve.
@brainouty @SenFeinstein IÔ∏è understand the Constitution. You don‚Äôt need to talk down to me. I‚Äôm just trying to understand the reasoning.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise To make up for taking away the Estate Tax. Are you just against all taxes in general?
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise That‚Äôs actually a good point that IÔ∏è have not considered. So then maybe taxes should be higher on those with that kind of wealth in return for getting rid of the Estate Tax.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise I have no problem with it. You don‚Äôt need money if you‚Äôre dead. Yes, your children (or whoever) are entitled to those funds, but if it‚Äôs millions then it should not be a problem. IÔ∏è take it you disagree?
@mattatat138 @SenFeinstein Because they‚Äôre trained to use them. The government has nuclear weapons, does that logic apply to those?
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise Correct. I didn‚Äôt want to provide an article that had opinions, just the facts. I figured that was the fair thing to do.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise Exactly, it affects very little of the population, and certainly not many farmers. That‚Äôs why Steve Scalise‚Äôs tweet is misleading especially to those who are not aware of who the tax actually affects.
@SenFeinstein For those claiming that they need assault weapons, what are your reasons? General curiosity.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise The Inheritance Tax is only applicable to those with assets over $5.4 million in 2017. This is from the IRS: 		https://t.co/0qnMzzXl11
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise Just 5,600 small businesses and farmers would be affected by the tax in the next 70 years. It‚Äôs not a biased thing, it‚Äôs just simple math.		https://t.co/gyyyG2pkak
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise Our conversation originated by discussing exactly who the Estate Tax affects, not why it exists. So it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmight be.‚Äù I can provide a source with factual information if you‚Äôd like. I just can‚Äôt move on until that‚Äôs made clear and understood.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise Ok you‚Äôre really missing the point here. We aren‚Äôt arguing (although I‚Äôd be happy to) about the merits of the tax itself. If you can admit that this tax does not affect farmers, then I‚Äôd be willing to shift this conversation to what you want to talk about.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise This original argument is about how Steve Scalise is being misleading when talking about farmers being affected by the Estate Tax, when in reality, it does not (with very few exceptions).
@DianeM1966 @atreidesduke @DwightCooper16 @SteveScalise It‚Äôs all about the rich. The Estate Tax only affects the wealthy.
@DwightCooper16 @atreidesduke @SteveScalise In this country (as with most) we agree to pay taxes for the common good. We can argue about what should and what shouldn‚Äôt be taxed, sure. But taxes as a whole are necessary.
@DwightCooper16 @nstretcher @SteveScalise That‚Äôs a totally separate conversation that we could get into. But just to clear this up, the Estate Tax affects only the wealthy, not just any form of wealth. Top .1% wealthy.
Comparing cars to guns is probably one of the most ridiculous arguments ever constructed by the right.
@nstretcher @DwightCooper16 @SteveScalise It only affects the wealthy.
@DwightCooper16 @SteveScalise I think you need to learn about the Estate Tax, Dwight.
@SteveScalise Oh yeah? How many farmers does that affect?

@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro Why would that law abiding citizen not have been allowed to have a gun? And actually yeah, there are those people; the Republican party.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I actually do, you might not since you didn‚Äôt show me where that article mentions correlation or causation.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I fully understand the difference, thanks.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Where in that entry does it mention correlation? All I see is that it has the potential to stop crime, which is of course true.
@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro I‚Äôm going off on people who only want prayer to be the response and nothing else.
@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro That also does absolutely nothing. I‚Äôm referring to people that rely on prayer only and would not like to see any changes to laws.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro When someone is being paid to do it, absolutely.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Counterargument: https://t.co/reFT7iEumR
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro "He has been a paid consultant for the New York Police Department in litigation involving stop and frisk.‚Äù All you need to know right there.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Send me a study that shows that.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Send one of these ‚Äúdozens‚Äù of sources.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Which is what makes stop and frisk awful. That still doesn‚Äôt prove there‚Äôs correlation.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Send me a source that shows correlation, besides just raw data.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro And what did you find that seemingly zero other people could find? You‚Äôre pulling this right out of your ass.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro This article shows no mention of correlation whatsoever. I have no idea why you sourced this.
@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro I can‚Äôt because prayer has never stopped a shooter. People still believe in prayer. And it‚Äôs ok if they do but we need more than just prayer
@realDonaldTrump Oh glad it will all be solved by this week. What a relief.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Other people have and they have determined there is no correlation. Did you crunch the numbers for yourself?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro There are actual studies though as well, not just news reports. Where in that data does it show a correlation?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro No, actually they are factual. Do you have a source or nah?
@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro Why is that not a smart move? If they want to pray, fine. But believing it‚Äôs a legitimate form of action is stupid.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Source? All I‚Äôm seeing is evidence against you.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Not sure why you‚Äôre spitting lies about this. I guess I should have known better than to take your word for it.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Actually just looked into this a bit, stop and frisk doesn‚Äôt even have a correlation nor causation for decreasing violent crime.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Stopping and frisking is a much bigger inconvenience than requiring licenses. Walking down the street is different than trying to buy a gun.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Correlation is not causation. Stop and frisk proved to be an extremely racist and harmful practice.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I don‚Äôt see how providing licenses for rifles could possibly be a bad thing. Even if research isn‚Äôt in, does it hurt to try it?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro The CDC is a trusted source of information and could provide accurate, unbiased information. I want both less corruption and more gun laws.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I‚Äôm referring to the CDC being unable to research gun violence for fear of losing funding due to the NRA‚Äôs lobbying efforts.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Because of money‚Äôs power in politics, yes. The NRA doesn‚Äôt want there to be research because they are afraid of what they might find.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Because the government isn‚Äôt allowed to do research thanks to the NRA. Can‚Äôt prove it‚Äôs ineffective either.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro That isn‚Äôt the same as it doing nothing.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Where did I admit it will do nothing?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I‚Äôm barking up this tree because I‚Äôd like to see change to prevent this. Doing nothing isn‚Äôt working.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Personally I would not but punishment definitely deters some people to not do crimes because of the risk.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro How could I possibly know?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Actually it is. Your faith that the US's morality can be morphed is exactly what causes this problem to continue to exist. You deserve blame
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Punishment prevents people from committing crimes as well as morality. People care about what happens to them if they break a law.
@RetadinRizien @884REAL @benshapiro Sure, I can protest or contact my representatives. Those aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive with tweeting though.
@danjnolte @benshapiro No, I‚Äôm not for that either. Existing guns would be grandfathered in.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro But you literally just said that it‚Äôs cultural values that stops murders, not the laws. So which is it?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Actually that‚Äôs really due to Indiana‚Äôs lax gun laws that allow gun access to be so easy in Chicago. It‚Äôs two very real issues though.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I‚Äôm not sure how you can say it won‚Äôt save lives‚Ä¶but why not take the chance? Would it really hurt anyone?
@danjnolte @benshapiro Maybe rifles don‚Äôt have a place in society in general, regardless of how he acquired this particular weapon.
@danjnolte @benshapiro We‚Äôll have to see how exactly he got his weapon. If he did indeed get it illegally, you‚Äôre correct on this.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I‚Äôm asking you why as a society do we have laws if bad people will just break the law. You haven‚Äôt answered that.
@danjnolte @benshapiro What Texas law would prevent him from doing so?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I want to see legal action because I want less people to die because of guns. If you have no legal solutions, nothing will change.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro I would like to see the requirement for Texas residents to get a license to be able to buy rifles, yes. Why be against that?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro That‚Äôs not an answer to the question I asked.
@danjnolte @benshapiro He was denied the sale of a handgun, not a long rifle. That sale was legal. Would you like a source on Texas gun laws?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Probably not since the NRA has successfully prevented the CDC from researching gun violence. Do you have any legal solutions to this?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Based on this logic, why have laws?
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Laws make it harder for bad people to do bad things, not stop it completely. In this case, it would have made it more difficult.
@danjnolte @benshapiro Actually that‚Äôs only for a handgun but not a long gun. Long guns don‚Äôt require licenses in Texas. So what he said there is misleading.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Why would that have a limited benefit? Reinforcing morality and humanity is a nice thought but not an actual legal solution.
@danjnolte @benshapiro How was it illegal for him to obtain a firearm? You could be right, but I thought he acquired it legally. Agreed on not being 1 solution
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro No solution will ever completely stop any mass shootings in any country. I think it would help decrease the probability. Any reason not to?
@danjnolte @benshapiro I don‚Äôt really use hashtags that often and I have ideas for solutions. Do you?
@danjnolte @benshapiro What do you mean?
@884REAL @benshapiro I don‚Äôt work in politics, so as a citizen (besides voting), there isn‚Äôt much more I can do.
@UTFOZZIE @benshapiro Requiring people to acquire licenses to open-carry in the state of Texas.
@_Fruhmann_ @benshapiro We already do extreme vetting. But that‚Äôs not relevant to this case.
@Sam_5thEstate @benshapiro What do you mean?
@benshapiro No, we just like to see action as opposed to just offering magic words directed towards no one.

@christine5857 @zellieimani While I doubt your family is attacked on a daily basis, I recognize that police risk their lives every day and deserve safety.
@christine5857 @zellieimani You started this argument. And you being in a police family certainly wouldn‚Äôt deter me from arguing about it.
@christine5857 @zellieimani That‚Äôs irrelevant to national trends. Anyway I have no idea whether they had racist tendencies or not
@christine5857 @zellieimani It isn‚Äôt.
@christine5857 @zellieimani Saying black lives matter isn‚Äôt a negation of all lives matter. Both can and are true.
@christine5857 @zellieimani The purpose isn‚Äôt to say that blacks are the only ones oppressed by police, but that they are often more likely to be than whites.

@VargasonDelbert @petty1983 @PattyWheeler12 @DLoesch It‚Äôs funny how @petty1983 can like these tweets yet still won‚Äôt give us a single source of Hillary saying she wants to ban guns.
@VargasonDelbert @petty1983 @PattyWheeler12 @DLoesch No one will be.
@VargasonDelbert @petty1983 @PattyWheeler12 @DLoesch Like against the Las Vegas shooter? Nobody is taking your guns anyway.
@Birrraay @HillaryClinton She‚Äôs right though.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch The right-wing sources you trust obviously aren‚Äôt going to report on this. To be fair, you asked for articles from "anti-gun journos"
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch So why are you opposed to all gun sellers being required to ask for ID/background check? Or for all sellers to be licensed?
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Here‚Äôs an example of unlicensed gun sellers selling at a gun show. https://t.co/vL7IPuzfWJ
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Anyone can go online, create a Craigslist ad, and sell a gun. Examples here: https://t.co/MY93GhhuSA
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch How is it a lie?
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch So you‚Äôre just saying it doesn‚Äôt happen? Can you provide a source saying that it never happens?
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch It applies to unlicensed gun sellers. They sell at gun shows. How does that not apply?
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch It‚Äôs just saying it‚Äôs misnamed. The loophole applies to unlicensed gun sellers, who frequent gun shows.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Great. It‚Äôs misnamed. It actually proves how much worse it is, because it doesn‚Äôt apply to only gun shows.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch It sounds like you‚Äôre the one who truly doesn‚Äôt know the law.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Little girls call each other names, which is precisely what you‚Äôre doing and I‚Äôm not.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Here‚Äôs one of many. https://t.co/dRdQFffSel
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch No, actually. I advocate for this whether there is an act of violence or not.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Yes, there is. Secondary sellers (such as gun show sellers) don‚Äôt require buyers to show ID or perform a background check. In some states
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch The argument is that we believe something needs to be done about our gun problem.
@TitusFCVA @DLoesch Universal background checks, limits on certain types of weapons, closing gun show loopholes, etc.
@LombartMarc @petty1983 @alexruthrauff @DLoesch I‚Äôm open-minded. If she can show me that I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôll gladly admit it.

@GOP Fuck you.
@DevilAdvocateEh @WildChild69 @TheRealSlazor @theratzpack @BarackObama I wouldn‚Äôt say voting is little use. One can also protest, contact their reps. Tweeting is the least we can do, doesn't mean we should stop
@DevilAdvocateEh @WildChild69 @TheRealSlazor @theratzpack @BarackObama Oh ok yeah you‚Äôre right, I should incite a revolution and anything less is worthless. Is that the only acceptable answer to you?
@DevilAdvocateEh @WildChild69 @TheRealSlazor @theratzpack @BarackObama Ok well we're not going to have a revolution so I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any shame in tweeting one‚Äôs opinion. We recognize it won‚Äôt change much
@DevilAdvocateEh @WildChild69 @TheRealSlazor @theratzpack @BarackObama It‚Äôs a horror story because of the influence of money in politics. Particularly the NRA. What more can we do?

@DevilAdvocateEh @WildChild69 @TheRealSlazor @theratzpack @BarackObama We have the power to vote. Just because we are limited to that power, doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt criticize our problems as a country.

@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS You should seriously do your research before tweeting something totally wrong like that. Not a very smart guy
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS Hahahahahaha no he didn‚Äôt. Clinton won them by a 9-point margin. ‚ÄúI base everything on facts‚Äù‚Ä¶.
@Thisiswitt420 No, you're crying like a baby when you see it. You let it bother you so much. You are incredibly weak. Couldn't be more of a snowflake.
@Thisiswitt420 One person in the preseason doesn‚Äôt make it a pressing issue. That barely even made headlines. You had to even look it up today.
@KoraxInvictus He probably got a boner just from me tweeting that honestly
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS Are exactly what Trump supporters are. Uneducated suckers that are getting taken for a ride.
@Thisiswitt420 Why is that?
@Thisiswitt420 Yes it is. Kneeling during it doesn‚Äôt hurt a single person. Except maybe your soft feelings.
@Thisiswitt420 No, he should prioritize helping Americans before complaining about something that wasn‚Äôt even active at the time.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS I think it‚Äôs pretty fucked up that he cares more about a song than American citizens.
@Thisiswitt420 He‚Äôs more concerned about starting shitstorms than caring about American citizens. It‚Äôs more than just looking bad.
@Thisiswitt420 Liberals can be patriots too. I‚Äôm a proud American. Just wish I could be prouder.
@Thisiswitt420 My argument is that he created a firestorm at an inappropriate time. It shows how little he cares about Puerto Rico.
@Thisiswitt420 I‚Äôm a Liberal. I get my views from my moral compass, education, and upbringing. Our anthem has its importance but it‚Äôs still just a song.
@Thisiswitt420 So for some reason after Maria it was ok? Why not comment on it next week after Puerto Rico is doing better?
@KoraxInvictus It still hasn‚Äôt really hit me that he actually tweeted back at me at one point. Unbelievable.
@Thisiswitt420 It wasn‚Äôt a pressing issue until he commented on it. Why didn‚Äôt he comment on it before Maria if this was in response to Eric Reid?
@matthewsoffer It happened.
Memories. https://t.co/qSQlCHSvzw
@Thisiswitt420 Put it off? There wasn‚Äôt a pressing issue. He created it.
@Thisiswitt420 You just said Kaepernick protested in August. That‚Äôs false. Show me where else there was kneeling this year before Trump‚Äôs comments?
@Thisiswitt420 ‚ÄúI base everything on facts‚Äù yeah right...
@Thisiswitt420 The timing was in poor taste considering the state of Puerto Rico after Maria. He could have said the same a week or a month from now.
@Thisiswitt420 Ok I‚Äôll take this as you admitting you were wrong. So then going back, yes the President did choose when there was a protest.
@Thisiswitt420 He hasn‚Äôt been on a team this season‚Ä¶what are you talking about...
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS Yeah ok. What special interest would that be?
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS I‚Äôm referring to the kneeling that occurred this weekend after he made his comments.
@Thisiswitt420 Show me where there was? I could be wrong but I‚Äôm fairly certain there weren‚Äôt any this year until last week.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS I disagree with that but it‚Äôs beside the point. The timing of it was wrong. Not while so many Puerto Ricans are suffering. Could have waited
@Thisiswitt420 Yes, people like to be able to eat. Welfare affects people of both parties.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS The current protests happened after he made those comments.
@Thisiswitt420 There weren‚Äôt even protests this year until he weighed in. He created this current situation. Trump made it look bad because it was bad.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS Again, I‚Äôm not saying he isn‚Äôt taking action. And Maria is certainly not his fault. But I think he could have done much better.
@Thisiswitt420 Apart or a part? They want to be a state. The Puerto Rican government is in a really shitty state and needs help big time.
@Thisiswitt420 I don‚Äôt have a problem with him weighing in on it. Just the timing was bad with Puerto Rico really struggling. Not a good look.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS I‚Äôm not saying he hasn‚Äôt done anything. Just arguing he could have done a better job and put the NFL on the back burner.
@Thisiswitt420 He should have been more prepared with assistance knowing where Maria was headed. I‚Äôm sure if they voted for him it would have been better.
@Thisiswitt420 I don‚Äôt understand your point here. This wasn‚Äôt all about tweets anyway. He spent an evening making a speech out of it.
@Thisiswitt420 @POTUS Him visiting accomplishes nothing, so that doesn‚Äôt matter.
@Thisiswitt420 It‚Äôs been a pretty delayed response. His excuse about it being an island is bullshit. Also should have made priority over NFL.
@Thisiswitt420 @FoxNews @MichelleObama @POTUS It‚Äôs Kool Aid.
@Thisiswitt420 @FoxNews @MichelleObama @POTUS The government should be concerned if you are being discriminated against. Who you vote for certainly shouldn‚Äôt go against your interests.
@Thisiswitt420 @FoxNews @MichelleObama @POTUS What does this have to do with anything?
@Thisiswitt420 @FoxNews @MichelleObama @POTUS Those things matter. All of those things affect how one lives.

@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Do you think they‚Äôre lying?
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Do you think racism, slavery, and/or segregation might have played a part?
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC But they aren‚Äôt doing this for themselves. They are standing up for others who don‚Äôt have as large of a voice.
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Why do you think crime rates are so high in the black community?
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC It raises awareness. Hence why we're talking about it right now. So that's one step accomplished. Starts the conversation.
@mitchellvii You‚Äôre whining about it, how tough are you?
@ChrisWi07039636 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Everybody does and sometimes it‚Äôs needed because we can‚Äôt always evade the conversation.
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Racism is about skin color. That‚Äôs literally what racism is about.
@aaapowergroup @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC *you're
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC I agree. The socks were a bad call
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Do you think the purpose of this is to convince racists to their side? I think pissing off racists is a good thing.
@ChrisWi07039636 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Do you know what kind of person says "typical black person"? A racist.
@PCsucks66 @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC If it weren‚Äôt for Trump‚Äôs comments, none of that would have happened this weekend. So are you saying Trump is creating more racism?
@LolaFallola @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC You just said there were no race riots before Obama. Do you still stand by that claim?
@LolaFallola @LynEpar @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC So you have to be fully black to be black now? I had no idea.
@LolaFallola @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Wait wait wait. No race riots before 2009? I‚Äôll let you have a chance to revise that statement.
The same people who proudly wave Confederate flags are the same complaining about NFL players being disrespectful to the American flag. #Wut
@YVee1223 @tamiruland @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Obama really should have thought about it before he decided to be black. The nerve...
@QuEEnNiKKi @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Nah Anthony wasn't. That's who her comment was directed towards.
@YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Actually that was him during Pearl Harbor. Classic mixup
@tamiruland @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Whoa I had no idea that prior to 2009 racism was solved. Dang it Obama!
@Mr_RGP @YVee1223 @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Don‚Äôt forget about WWII. That was him too I‚Äôm almost certain
@nettan596 @orthoCurt @asusi1673 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Yeah I can‚Äôt believe none of the Native American NFL players are kneeling. Oh wait.
@Marusguy @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Oh yeah sure segregation was much less racist than now I‚Äôm sure. This is way worse than that.
@PavlikDouglas @IngrahamAngle Or the many people that don‚Äôt believe in God
@IngrahamAngle That doesn‚Äôt bind us at all.
I wonder when someone will tell him that Puerto Rico is part of the US. Maybe tomorrow? https://t.co/rZfQwxC8FG
@CNN As a Ravens fan I would do this too proudly.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump @AmericaFirstPAC Yep there was just zero racism before Obama! America was perfect! You‚Äôre so smart.
@Slate Uh, yeah?
@seomclaughlin Of course it wasn‚Äôt his purpose to be disrespectful. It‚Äôs not the point of any of this.
@AP Some say her heart grew three times larger that day
@espn The fact that you thought this picture deserved a tweet is fucking stupid.
@mitchellvii Zero people say you don‚Äôt have the right to say that.
@RayMcgangbang Or you could just stop watching and no one will care. Fortunately in this country they have the right to do this.
@fusionmeister @HuffPost I hope not but probably
@HuffPost Pretty sure they were going to get booed anyway. They are the opposing team...
Worst Ravens game ever? Worst Ravens game ever.
@DannyD343 @RavenManiac Also, they are standing up for others and not just themselves. They care about people other than themselves.
@DannyD343 @RavenManiac Here‚Äôs an example: https://t.co/u7kN9Nar3H
@DannyD343 @RavenManiac Kneeling during the anthem isn‚Äôt disrespecting troops. The anthem isn‚Äôt all about the military
@FaithR8s Ok great
@jagxteller I can, I just don‚Äôt have to obey to your arbitrary numbers and refuse to do so. Thanks for supporting the NFL by watching.
You can say next man up all you want, but eventually the reality of injuries will catch up to you #Ravens
@jagxteller Apparently three instances is somehow the magic number you need too
@jagxteller A picture with words isn‚Äôt. Ok you need to provide 14 examples of how he‚Äôs not racist. Because that‚Äôs the arbitrary number I decided on.
@jagxteller Didn‚Äôt you just provide two pictures of decades old unsubstantiated stuff
@jagxteller Again, means nothing.
@jagxteller This means nothing
@jagxteller There‚Äôs a reason every NFL owner so far has taken a stand against Trump.
@jagxteller Calling them sons of bitches and demanding they be fired.
@jagxteller I‚Äôm proud to be an American too. But I could be prouder.
@jagxteller That‚Äôs for Veteran‚Äôs Day. Do you think when they play anthems at the Olympics, they are making it about the military?
@jagxteller Correct. Again, I understand what the anthem was written about. But it‚Äôs not the reason we sing it before games.
@jagxteller No, they dislike how African Americans are being treated in this country. And now, how our president is treating them.
@jagxteller The purpose of singing the anthem before games isn‚Äôt just to support the military. I understand the context of the words.
@jagxteller I‚Äôm well aware of the words. The anthem isn‚Äôt solely about the military.
@jagxteller They aren‚Äôt kneeling because they dislike the flag.
@jagxteller The anthem isn‚Äôt all about veterans. Kneeling doesn‚Äôt make you against the military.
@RavenManiac They aren‚Äôt.
@RavenManiac Yes and nothing more American than exercising our freedom of speech
I guess the defense never made the trip over #Ravens
@mflynnJR @NFL Snowflake
*Mosley
If you‚Äôre a Ravens fan and you now dislike Suggs, Lewis, Mosely just because they kneeled, you were never a true Ravens fan anyway.
Make sure all you kneeler-haters stand for the anthem at home.

@RobertG35947779 @WhiteHouse This isn‚Äôt remotely logical.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz Some things deserve more regulation than others. Basic needs like healthcare shouldn‚Äôt be profitable. At least not as a priority.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz I‚Äôm saying our healthcare system should function like much of Europe‚Äôs. Denmark, France, Germany, UK. Not just Europe, Canada too.
@muchfish2 @FoxNews @chelseahandler It‚Äôs only been 8 months, give Trump some time.
@mflynnJR He isn‚Äôt wondering how he got in, he‚Äôs wondering why he‚Äôs still there. Kinda like how your dad isn‚Äôt anymore
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz If you trust insurance companies more than the people we voted in, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of you.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz Depends on the politician. But some of them, yeah I do. And yes they are. Again, look at Europe.
@FoxNews @chelseahandler This just isn‚Äôt fair. They are equally insane. Have some respect.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz It doesn‚Äôt currently. Such a shame.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz I don‚Äôt understand your point here.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz It can be an answer. Certainly not for everything. But it works for other countries. Healthcare here is great if you can afford it.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz Voted, pay taxes‚Ä¶pretty much just citizen stuff so far. Maybe I‚Äôll try running for office when I‚Äôm older, who knows.
@Purcell1776 @tedcruz Would love to see universal healthcare like every other civilized nation.
@RobertG35947779 @WhiteHouse How am I an embarrassment, Old Man?
@WhiteHouse Thanks for the embarrassment!
If you support Donald Trump I think deep down you must know you‚Äôre an asshole. You just have to.
I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump is just doing this to distract us from his side‚Äôs failure on healthcare. Let‚Äôs not be fooled so easily.
@realDonaldTrump Thankfully it‚Äôs not up to you.
@NFL @DeMarcusWare Future Hall of Famer
@dailycallout It‚Äôs just a song.

@TBrambley @realDonaldTrump Have you heard many excuses today
@Ripple59 @realDonaldTrump Why did you capitalize stupid
@TBrambley @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs twitter. Punctuation doesn‚Äôt make a difference at the end of a sentence here. But if i was President I certainly would
@TBrambley @realDonaldTrump The difference is that capitalizing hurricane requires extra effort while leaving out a question mark is just laziness
@realDonaldTrump Why is hurricane capitalized

@Augustus_FNV @NFL @RamsNFL @49ers @nflnetwork The point was how no one cares about these teams. Neither will make the playoffs. Doesn‚Äôt matter that it was a close one
@BS71312 @NFL @RamsNFL @49ers @nflnetwork Both are terrible and the combination of the two isn‚Äôt any better

@areezy24 And your conservative logic baffles me as well. But hey about those Ravens
@areezy24 Ok great. The people you personally know is irrelevant. There are plenty of people you don‚Äôt know who had to leave their country some way.
@areezy24 Don‚Äôt you think that if it was that easy to come legally instead of illegally, they would make that choice?
@areezy24 It‚Äôs definitely about empathy. Understanding the situations these people were faced with. And how children didn‚Äôt have a say.
@areezy24 How about we as people strive to take care of one another regardless of nationality? We‚Äôre all the same.
@areezy24 Why do you think they even left in the first place? I don‚Äôt understand how people like you can just lack any empathy whatsoever
@areezy24 They‚Äôre also human. Maybe you should wrap your head around that one and you might find yourself a little more understanding.
@areezy24 Actually their parents were. As children, they didn‚Äôt have a say in that decision. They shouldn‚Äôt be punished because of it.
@areezy24 DACA was already a legal solution. There was no need to repeal it. I would love to know what ‚Äúreal news‚Äù sources you get your info from...
@areezy24 You don‚Äôt know Mitch McConnell? Even he had a problem with Trump ending it. Why do you think it‚Äôs a good idea?
@areezy24 Even a decent amount of Republicans disagree with his decision on DACA. So maybe not just Liberal logic
@ESPNNFL So is everyone except for Cleveland
@Mo_12_Sanu Didn‚Äôt know your pilot‚Äôs name was ‚Äúgod"
@Pontifex Trump subtweet?
@RieneRichard I‚Äôm ending our conversation because it‚Äôs clear you have a mental illness. I feel bad for you. Hope you get the help you need. 100% serious.
@RieneRichard Your personal experience is irrelevant
@RieneRichard Gang violence is extremely bad in countries such as El Salvador. Also, at some point you need to eat and that costs money.
@RieneRichard What happens then?
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes https://t.co/oWpxx4fin3
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes Ok so how did he help by going that first time?
@RieneRichard There‚Äôs no law to break in that country of origin that could save them. Survival is a good enough reason I think. It‚Äôs their last resort.
@RieneRichard They grew up. And yes they had time to legalize but again it‚Äôs not that easy to do so. They are upstanding citizens w/ no criminal record
@RieneRichard Children can‚Äôt really tell their parents that they aren‚Äôt going‚Ä¶especially at a young age.
@RieneRichard No of course not. It‚Äôs the lesser of the two options.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes People on all sides have praised that. Of course it actually has to go through, unlike some of his previous donation promises.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes Yeah I know. And that‚Äôs fine. But that doesn‚Äôt mean he helped.
@RieneRichard As a means of survival, yes. I‚Äôm sure they would prefer to do so legally if it was easier.
@RieneRichard These are not the same people, as these people immigrated as children (and likely against their will).
@RieneRichard I‚Äôm sure many have tried. It isn‚Äôt easy enough to become naturalized unfortunately.
@RieneRichard I agree, people should not break the law. Let‚Äôs make it better for people to become legal citizens and help people in need.
@RieneRichard Right, so let‚Äôs make it easier for legal naturalization so there‚Äôs less illegal immigration and it‚Äôs more fair.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes He didn‚Äôt even see one flood victim the first time he went.
@RieneRichard Or to escape extreme poverty and gang violence.
@RieneRichard Can you not imagine yourself in their shoes? They didn‚Äôt choose to come here. What are they supposed to do?
@RieneRichard No, we should make the naturalization process smoother so those who want to move here legally can do so easier.
@RieneRichard Yeah but there‚Äôs a justified reason to naturalize immigrants. You even just said it was unfair to those trying to legally do it.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes What did he do that was amazing?
@RieneRichard Returning money isn‚Äôt equivalent to returning a person. This is a human being.
@RieneRichard That‚Äôs certainly true. We should make it easier for people to become naturalized citizens.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes This is a picture of Trump in Texas.
@RieneRichard No. But if your dad kills someone you don‚Äôt go to jail for it.
@RieneRichard Correct. So not the actual people themselves. Shouldn‚Äôt affect their children.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes This is Texas
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats The meme makes fun of people for resorting to name-calling, and here you are name-calling left and right. Why even send that
@RedRyan28 @TheRealSMH7 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You look so much less inbred now. Good choice.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats It sounds more like you.
@RieneRichard @KT_So_It_Goes This has nothing to do with why Democrats lost.
@TheRealSMH7 @RedRyan28 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Definitely used one of these https://t.co/OltRFIIPHD
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats  https://t.co/N8tUAAHLEi
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats So how did Obama lie about North Korea? Also I‚Äôm not sure what the problem with Snapchat is
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You never indicated that was your initial point. You just blamed Obama and Clinton for NK. Only mentioned honesty after Bush mention
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats How did Obama lie about the North Korean situation?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I‚Äôm not asking you who deserves more blame. I‚Äôm asking you why Bush doesn‚Äôt deserve any blame.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I have already accepted this point. How is Bush not responsible but Obama and Clinton are?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Yes, I know. I brought him up because you exempted him from your criticism. Who brought him up isn‚Äôt under question.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You have yet to argue why Bush is immune from sharing the same responsibility as Obama and Clinton for the North Korean situation.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You brought up his honesty. You said ‚ÄúBush did not lie to me!‚Äù I never brought up his honesty.
@Tamagura @RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Still waiting for you to show me where Obama wanted an Islamic takeover.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Ok, so I‚Äôm asking you how it does. How does Bush‚Äôs honesty excuse him from being responsible for today‚Äôs NK situation?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Yes, he was wrong about that.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Meaning just because he was honest, does not mean that he can‚Äôt share responsibility for today‚Äôs current state.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Ok let me explain very clearly. Bush‚Äôs honesty about NK is irrelevant to the argument that he bears no responsibility for the situation
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats ‚Äú‚Ä¶.to the argument‚Äù Do you understand what that means?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats To the argument, not in general. That was clear.
@Mcknnykmac @paulbubbam @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I‚Äôm thinking 9-7 but we‚Äôll see
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Quote me where I said that
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Oh ok then you‚Äôre a fucking idiot. Just a description, not an insult.
@pillarofrhodes @paulbubbam @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Good call Nostradamus
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You literally just called me a ‚Äútypical lying Liberal"
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Who is doing the name calling here? It‚Äôs been all you from the beginning. So insanely hypocritical of you.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You totally missed the point. I made my argument of how Bush‚Äôs honesty doesn‚Äôt excuse him from blame for North Korea.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You‚Äôve never had any to begin with. Your arguments are awful. You only know how to send shitty memes a grandmother would send.
@RedRyan28 @ElBartoVerdad @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It turned out to be invalid because the name is misspelled anyways. Your point is invalid because my favorite sports team doesn‚Äôt matter
@speaksonglyrics @paulbubbam @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Fan
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Not relevant to whether he is responsible for the NK situation or not. Tell me how it‚Äôs relevant
@JeanneLoza @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I can spell heal correctly. I win.
@LaciBlu @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse No need to reply to me
@CrazzzyWeed @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Your words don‚Äôt form a coherent sentence.
@paulbubbam @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse We‚Äôre 0-0
@RedRyan28 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You‚Äôre from Pennsylvania. That‚Äôs an insult in itself.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Well we know you didn‚Äôt personally post this because there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd spell any of that correctly
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I mean we can disagree about it, but it‚Äôs certainly no one‚Äôs ‚Äúcall.‚Äù How is his honesty relevant to the argument?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Whether he lied to you or not is irrelevant to how he is responsible or not for the current NK situation.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Right, so I‚Äôm wondering why you don‚Äôt think Bush deserves any blame. If you did, you wouldn‚Äôt have just focused on Obama and Clinton
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats It‚Äôs not a deflection, it‚Äôs questioning your argument. I already admitted that criticizing 42 and 44 is fair. But don‚Äôt deserve all blame
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I brought up Bush because you did not. Can you not provide a reasonable answer to why Bush doesn‚Äôt deserve any blame but 42 and 44 do?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Your criticisms should apply to each administration regardless of political party. Im a Liberal but I can admit when my party makes mistakes
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I actually never disagreed with you. I‚Äôm just wondering why you choose to omit the blame to Bush. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being fair.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Again, I‚Äôm not denying that Clinton and Obama mishandled the North Korean predicament
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats How did the Bush administration handle it with more success?
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Not that it was an easy issue to resolve, nor do I blame Trump for the current situation. Just think it‚Äôs unfair to blame 42 &amp; 44 but not 43
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Each administration shares the same responsibility of not resolving the issue. A quick read here: https://t.co/ftWzgJLufg
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Same could be said about any claim no matter how valid it is
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats You blamed the Obama and Clinton situation for our current NK situation, without any mention of George Bush
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Exactly‚Ä¶let‚Äôs see some research. You can‚Äôt make a claim and then rely on others to backup whatever claims you make.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I understand how both Clinton and Obama share responsibility for the current situation. My question is how that blame somehow skips Bush
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats How is this a problem they created, but somehow skipped over by Bush?
@Tamagura @RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Where exactly does Obama allude to an ‚ÄúIslamic takeover‚Äù?
@Tamagura @RieneRichard @TheDemocrats How so?
@AjDavey9 @RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Yeah me too. That‚Äôs what makes the current North Korea situation so scary.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Acute isn‚Äôt even spelled correctly here
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Nobody enjoys ending a potential life.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats It‚Äôs not factually incorrect that I‚Äôd rather have that.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats I‚Äôd rather have a President that shows true human emotions than the one we have now.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Yes, people are sad. If only you had the brain or the heart to realize why.
@RieneRichard @TheDemocrats Yeah because conservatives really handled 8 years of Obama well
@TheDemocrats Thankfully I don‚Äôt have one.
@Jaguars What flavor is he

@seanhannity I didn‚Äôt realize Republicans in Congress were Liberal elites
@CBSNews More importantly the generosity tho
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Ok so if I cite an American scientific source that backs up my claim, you‚Äôll accept it?
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico @Google That's one person, nothing scientific, and equivalent to wanting to raise a child to be straight anyways
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Ok but its a scientific article. This is why I asked you what sources you'd accept
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico For one, here‚Äôs a scientific journal entry from Cambridge University. https://t.co/Rn8LOszCGh
@Breaking911 Are they seceding again
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico Also the thought that prayer will help in any fashion is ridiculous
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico Cold but true. Just as many who lambast welfare are the same people who benefit from it.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Before I start citing sources, what sources would you accept? Scientific studies (not news articles)?
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Your trademark Texas trash ignorance is showing more. Time to come out of the 1950s bud
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Your personal experience is inferior to what science says about it.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico It doesn‚Äôt even need an analogy. The science has changed. There is nothing wrong with being gay.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 Haha if I get my own hashtag out of this, I‚Äôll gladly accept the title.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico I really doubt that happens. But even so, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being gay. Do you know any gay people personally?
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico We used to think cigarettes were good for our health too. Funny how science changes things over time.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 That‚Äôs why you have a leftist clown like me to enlighten you with our communist forms of communication
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico I mean at least it works. At least a #StupidLibtardedSnowflakeClown like me could figure out how a hashtag works.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Are you saying that 100% of gay children did not grow up in healthy environments?
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico Nah it‚Äôs not the alt-left, it‚Äôs just the left. And it‚Äôs a good point. Just in poor taste.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico It‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt hashtag emojis. Any simple minded person could figure that one out.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Then why do staunch religious people have gay children?
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Ok glad you got that one added in.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico If you think being gay is a choice, you‚Äôre an idiot.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico You don‚Äôt even know how hashtags work. Simply name calling isn‚Äôt roasting someone by the way.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Even if you aren‚Äôt in it for followers, it‚Äôs pretty telling you only have five. You aren‚Äôt remotely funny. I‚Äôd admit if you roasted me well.
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Not an expert, just not a total idiot. I‚Äôm not gay, but wouldn‚Äôt be ashamed to admit if I was.
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico True. And criticism is fine too. But it‚Äôs hypocritical for those who are quick to call others snowflakes to be demanding its removal.
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico Definitely in poor taste. Worth deleting though? I don‚Äôt agree
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico It‚Äôs a wonder how you have only five followers
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Why would anyone choose to be gay if they have to deal with assholes like you?
@_Mr_Clutch_44 @Mannaleemer @PrisonPlanet @politico Nah, it‚Äôs not.
@ceruleetheblue @PrisonPlanet @politico Of course they deserve to be rescued. I don‚Äôt think anyone is arguing that point.
