@TheRickWilson I recall that during the 2016 elections. I don't understand why he is still getting exposure on major new outlets?
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza It was a suggestion.... to log off  and think.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza I wouldn't waste my time defending this guy if I were you. It's just not worth it and makes you look terrible. Log off of Twitter and think about it.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza Please READ and get the FACTS. It matters.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza No comparison.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza Yep... we are talking about changing policies to deny asylum and discriminate against the brown folks... pretty simple to understand. You can keep denying this if it helps you.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza One of the reasons your CA Republicans lost most of the House seats.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza Again, FACTS please. He is delaying and denying. BTW: Obama did not have massive camps to jail immigrant children and the inhumane separating of children from their parents.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza one word: ASYLUM. Thank you.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza There isn't much comparison, I am sorry. Get the facts, please.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza It's about policy, and NOT what a church does. It's great that churches help people. Please read more about this issue and don't bring up Obama every time your current president performs an illegal action.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza Please read details of why Obama's actions and then respond, please.
@SoCalValleyGal @paolamendoza Keep making excuses for this corrupt guy.... and ignore humanity.
