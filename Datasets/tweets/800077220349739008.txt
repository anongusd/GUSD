@Michael42683406 @TomColeOK04 @GOPLeader I'm also independent, but admittedly liberal. My trouble with the "anti-abortion" crowd is that they do not support measures that are proven to decrease unwanted pregnancies - namely universal healthcare and comprehensive sex ed and bigger safety net. 1/2

@KennyKenny412 @Hkreyes12 @NRA How is the statistic misleading?		Why does my .22 rifle not qualify me as a gun owner? Or are you saying I'm not responsible? How so?		As far as @NRA , guess we'll see how the Butina thing works out.		But I think we should get $ out of politics anyway.

@JGaraf @Tampke @Hkreyes12 @NRA I think there's a big misconception that those who are against gun violence want to take all guns away and that is simply untrue for most of us. 	As I said before, I am a responsible gun owner. 	Part of that is not letting my child go somewhere where ppl...

@CShitposting @Hkreyes12 @NRA What do you propose and what have you done to that end?		I'm all ears.		And yes, it is frightening hiding in a bathroom in the dark trying to keep a lot of terrified special needs children calm and quiet.
@Tampke @Hkreyes12 @NRA Well, if you think 300,000 dead Americans (including many children) every 10 years is the price of stopping a tyrannical govt (with your semi-auto against their missiles, tanks and planes, lol) - then we'll just have to disagree.		I'm sick of dead kids.
@CShitposting @Hkreyes12 @NRA How many in 2016? 2017?  Regardless, I think 11,000 gun homicides is way too many. I also think the accidental and suicide deaths are too high.		But if you think nothing can be done, then continue doing nothing.		Have a nice life.	Don't be a statistic.
@JGaraf @Tampke @Hkreyes12 @NRA I am not a gun expert and can not identify these weapons. 		That does not make 30,000+ dead Americans ok, TO ME.		What would you do (have you done) to reduce school shootings and other gun violence?		Thank you.
@Tampke @Hkreyes12 @NRA It is fine if you don't think anything can or should be done about the deaths of 30,000 + Americans, or if you feel like your "right" to an arsenal is more important than those ppls lives, but I disagree...		Which is my 1st Amendment right.		Have a good day.
@Tampke @Hkreyes12 @NRA Not a marketing arm of gun manufacturers.	You regulate what ppl do in their homes by arresting parents for allowing access to unsecured weapons when their children kill themselves or others.	I  consider ARS and M16s military style weapons.

@CShitposting @Hkreyes12 @NRA I know that many are suicides. Stricter gun laws would help that also, but 15,000-20,000 non-suicide gun deaths are not ok either, imho.		Also, not sure why you think gun owners don't want the carnage to end.		Most of us do.
@mynameissquatch @Hkreyes12 @NRA I do not wish death on this person. I'm simply stating they could be part of this shameful statistic - and that I'm for common sense gun laws. 		I'm wishing 30,000+ Americans didn't die every year needlessly and I think we can and should do something about it
@forthepatrie @Hkreyes12 @NRA Laugh all you like. No skin off my back. You know nothing about me - yet call me authoritarian and pathetic. 		Have a good day.

@scampbell195022 @seanhannity Good for you.		The people I know are struggling with healthcare premiums of $9,000 a year (and climbing).		I also don't like paying for profit insurance co. middlemen (unlike every other developed nation).		But you do you.
@gomezaddams1947 @seanhannity How many elections gave you won @gomezaddams1947 ?
@SaraCurttright @seanhannity Winning an election is a "participation trophy"?		Good to know.
@lcdawg80 @Dick_Heimtuecke @markle_darla @seanhannity Which ideas, specifically? 		I really like her idea that all citizens should be offered the same, or better, healthcare than Congress gets - at tax payers expense.
@lcdawg80 @seanhannity And what, pray tell, is your education? 		Also, assuming you did NOT vote for @realDonaldTrump , as most educated voters did not.

@autgrind @MarshaBlackburn Respectfully, you're something like 30,000 times more likely to die from gun violence by a fellow citizen or from lack of access to affordable healthcare.		But for border security need comprehensive reform, work on visa overstays et al. Not a symbolic "wall".

@electricista545 @neeratanden @blakeleymusic That the article is about one of the things you mentioned - specifically how Russia targeted 3rd party voters as part of their interference. 		We're going to have to be able to work on more than 1 thing and reflect on our mistakes for 2020.

@rkinseth @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The part where I'm not talking about any criminal investigation, but about the fact that THE FBI VETS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SCOTUS NOMINEES, just as they did with Anita Hill, because that president wanted a full vetting. Do you understand now?
@sophiafisher66 @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Please cite your source that she said any of that.		Thank you.
@BenPalombo1 @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Again, please read about Anita Hill.		No one is talking about criminal charges. I'm talking about vetting allegations against a SCOTUS nominee - which the FBI handles if the pussy grabber requests it.		Again: see Anita Hill.
@Terrie_Duvall @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I'm not talking about criminal charges. I'm talking about FBI vetting allegations against a SCOTUS nominee. Maybe you can do some homework on Anita Hill, so you'll learn that it IS THE FBI THAT DOES THAT.
@pearlofaguitar @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Assault victims often don't come forward, for obvious reasons.		No way for FBI to vet allegations against a SCOTUS nominee 30 years ago, when he wasn't a nominee. (No one's talking criminal charges).
@bjharroun @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Definitely. Block all people with different opinions than your own  (but be sure to demean them first).		That will really make our Democracy great.
@YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I'm not angry or a Dem, so not sure who you all are referring to.		I do think all SCOTUS nominees need to have all allegations against them thoroughly vetted AND I definitely understand why assault victims don't come forward(and why we have predators in govt)
@YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The FBI vets allegations regarding SCOTUS nominees at the presidents request!!!		Just EXACTLY like happened with Anita Hill.		Not sure where people are getting the idea they don't. 		I'm not saying a criminal assault investigation. Jheez
@deanos5150 @PorkChopExPrez @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Jheez, I can't imagine why assault victims don't come forward.		I truly hope none of you has daughters. If you do though, tell them Dennis Rodman can investigate their assault, then laugh.		And,I think 1 agent can probably give a good vetting in a month or so
@donnie_mauldin @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Yes, it was worth it to her to get death threats and have her family threatened just to delay this.		Get real! 		She wanted to keep it confidential, remember? 		Why can't they wait a couple weeks/months (and do it right) on a lifetime appt?
@LindaWa88949972 @CostilowTracey @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Ok, well she is saying, on her lawyers advice,  that the FBI should vet the veracity of her info (interview witnesses, etc) before she gets grilled by Senators without this vetting.		To not follow this advice sounds stupid to me. Just sayin'
@CostilowTracey @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Ummm, the FBI investigates federal employees all the time. They've vetted Kavanaugh 6 times. They can vet this new information too - it's not illegal.		That's all she's asking for. Not criminal proceedings, which are past statue of limitations anyway.
@RyanRichard62 @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Yeah, sadly, when assault victims come forward they are victimized more.		Then someone comes along and says "if you don't want to be victimized more, shut up."		Happens all the time.		So, let's have more pussy grabbers in government! 		Makes me sick.		#MeToo
@littlelemon10 @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump She gets zero political power out of it, but is getting threats to herself and her family (by the likes of you?).		Probably why she didn't want to come forward in the first place.		Anyway,  you prob voted for the pussy grabber, so why not support a rapist.
@littlelemon10 @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump How did she do that? 		She gave a letter to her Congress person and asked to be kept anonymous.		When she was outed,she decided it was better to tell her own story and upon legal advise that law enforcement, not Senators, should investigate her veracity.
@beckybuck @YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Well I see you know a lot about sexual assault victims.		You do offer an excellent example of why so many victims do not come forward - to be victimized again, by the likes of you.		Are you one of the ones making death threats?
@YoCheerMama @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump 1st of I am not "young lady" so don't patronize me.		2nd of all the FBI has NOT investigated these allegations.		3rd of all, why would any assault victim go before Congress without impartial professional investigation 1st?

@TrumpDefined @BCISLEMAN I'll add to my long list too! Thanks.		Reading "The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion" right now and can recommend it. Very enlightening.
@BCISLEMAN @TrumpDefined @Lawrence @GOP Good points all.		I'm still hoping it can/will change.		I just feel a 2 party system is untenable. 		It leaves too many unrepresented and is just a breeding ground for the kind of tribalism and gridlock we see today, imho.
@BCISLEMAN @TrumpDefined @Lawrence @GOP For example, in our system progressives and libertarians tend to be unrepresented.Right now moderate or fiscal conservatives are unrepresented. 		Neither party has done a good job of ever representing me.		This is why so many people feel disenfranchised,imho

@BCISLEMAN @TrumpDefined @Lawrence @GOP Hope you're right,  or even better that they'll force 3rd, 4th and 5th parties - so additional views can be expressed and politicians will be forced to work together in coalitions.		That way no one party can obstruct and cooperation can be seen as a good.

@Kitchener1850 @davidhogg111 away from violent, dangerous and mentally unstable people.		I think 1 problem is that whenever common sense reforms are proposed people start saying you're trying to take all guns from law abiding citizens and that's just not true. 		#ResponsibleGunOwner
@Kitchener1850 @davidhogg111 In my personal belief, 2nd Amendment says guns should be for well regulated militia - not for random citizens to have arsenals. We already restrict full auto, anti-aircraft and other weapons, so surely we can figure out how to keep most dangerous weapons..1/

@staticchar @davidhogg111 I think you are talking about @GOP politicians. Both @GOP and @DNC and other CITIZENS agree on many things - including universal background checks.	So let's get citizens talking to each other about solutions. 	Citizens ALWAYS lead politicians. Always.
