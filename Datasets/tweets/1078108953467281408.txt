@ginamizell Is chemistry affected at all with Josh Jackson right now?
@Martin_Bonobo @DaveKingNBA @Gambo987 THIS üëè
@DaveKingNBA @Gambo987 Sarver knows everyone thinks this, but a but a definite multi-hundred dollar millionaire/ probably billionaire's pride and ego is a practically unstoppable force.
@rheaseehorn @AndyRichter Love your work so much! Truely a great actress!
@dodi70 @_waleedshahid I thought I was the only one who thought this!
@JeremyNDooley Where did you come up with the idea to do a book? Big fan!
@AndyTheG Should've just sold the microphone lol.
@MLBNetwork Plan my exit strategy out of San Diego, and to an actual contender team.
@StrummerVillage Only true Suns fans know the pain
@Zo2BigBaller Why tho,what stands out to you in Kobes career to put him past Jordan?
@Zo2BigBaller Kobe better than Jordan? Really?
@krassenstein Democracy at work
@damanr @AnthonyIrwinLA @HPbasketball Harden, and its no contest.
@GrantWoods Have you seen Better Call Saul?
@HamillHimself Hey Mark! Big fan here! Could I get a Birthday like/shoutout? Would make my day.
@shanedawson Shane could I get a birthday like/retweet? Love you!
@Bickley_Marotta The willingness to not get better. 	(Ex. Finding a decent/suitable Point Guard)
@Jumpshot8 I wouldnt like it. They need to focus more on defense in my opinion. Every game just seems to be a scoring marathon now. Just my opinion
@SenGillibrand Love you Kirsten!
@AmyNels23196500 Care to explain what you mean?
@RealJamesWoods Did you hear that the democrats blocked Steve Scalise from speaking on guns? Unbelievable!
@kyrstensinema Did you see SNL portray you last night?!
@DonCheadle Just wondering your thoughts, do you think the Lieutenant Governor Of Verginia should resign as well?
@Captain_Cunto @MagnusOpus33 @SohrabAhmari OMG üòÇ
@DuaneRankin He has no idea what he's doing!
@ryenarussillo Exactly, all while theyre getting millions!
@JeremyDBoreing Thank you so much for speaking the truth!! Cant stand her!
@AshleyNevel Its a business though, owners and General Managers will do what will make their teams better. Why cant players realize that? Its not that theyre unloyal, they just see a better opportunity. Calling them unloyal makes it sound too personal.
@TeamPelosi Love you Nancy!
@DanCrenshawTX You should get an American Flag eye patch!
@NSlowMotion24 @DougandWolf987 @Lavarbigballer @ZO2_ Comepletley agree
@phxfan54 @Gambo987 TRUE!!
@RWPUSA Do you think that the Gov. Northam incident was a plan by the GOP? While I think he should resign, I see Republican planning all over this.
@Rene3k @theScore Honestly tho
@tboneryan3 @AZSports Yes but, we already have Sarver. I truely believe hes way worse than Ball.
@CraigAHamil TRUE!!
@msannettestrong @MoveTheSticks So true
@CarolC I think the Patriots won
@JohnLegere I can't wait!
@washingtonpost New game, who dis?
@jeffgreer_ @LVann_Sports Has this actually happened? Lol
@JohnS877 @KatTimpf True
@andrewzimmern Have a favorite Superbowl snack?
@KatTimpf Surprised its not a vape
@esidery Just wondering, out of all the free agents going into the off-season who do you see the most realistic signing with Phoenix. Also do you think they'll pursue any big names?  Durant? Kyrie?
@PattyArquette @GOPLeader @SteveKingIA They never will because theyre hypocrites
Zack is so good with this family! Thats why hes the best! #GhostAdventures #OgdenPosession
@KatTimpf You should move to Portland lol
@amyklobuchar Please run! üôè
@THEKIDMERO THE BRAND IS STRONG
@Bickley_Marotta I used to hate him, but now I root for him in the playoffs, just because he's so great. You gotta admire that.
@adazona6 @JarrettGC I love this lol
@Bickley_Marotta Surround him with actually good players, and I'm sure he will be.
@melby_kyle I pray Amy runs!

@stoolpresidente @nflcommish One rule change everyone knows the rules
@Gambo987 Hey Gambo, have the Cardinals shown any interest in Matt LaFleur? Your thoughts on him?
@stoolpresidente One horrible, out of place tan, everyone knows the rules.
@TeresaYaw @kathygriffin @shanedawson Love you Teresa!
@Bickley_Marotta Encouraged, compared to the last time they played the warriors. You can see the improvement over time. I didn't expect them to win just compete, and that they did. Now sign KD in the off-season.
@RealJamesWoods while i may not agree with you politically, I just wanted to say that I love  you as an actor and person.(especially in OUATIA) Much respect to you Sir!
