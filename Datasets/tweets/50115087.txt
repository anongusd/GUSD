Mission Control will need to evolve as our missions evolve. As our human missions travel farther out we will need to rethink how we control them. It would be cool to see Mission Control closer to the mission, such as on the Moon or Mars!	~Boulos https://t.co/WAXd9euiTy

Hi Courtney!  I'm most excited about getting back into mission control!  I loved that part of my spacewalking EVA career.  I can't wait to dust off my headset! - Allison https://t.co/Zck3RJYOnc
Yes. In the very worst case an astronaut needs help we will bring them down including their crew mates. The Flight Director has the authority to make that decision alongside the ISS Commander. - Marcos https://t.co/lwU1LkvTlK
I love running! I've done quite a few half marathons (just completed the Banff Half Marathon in Canada last month).  I did my first marathon last year (Marine Corps in DC) and I'm starting to train for the Chicago marathon this October! -Allison https://t.co/P2m3glGtMh

Traditionally it was an Astronaut position, but has recently been staffed by both Astronauts and Engineers within Flight Operations.  Many of the astronauts work as CapComs when they are not in space or training for a specific spaceflight.  - Rebecca and Pooja (Former CapComs) https://t.co/NBLTEw5qBv
We do have trips to the moon planned in the next several years. Right now we are getting our vehicles designed and tested to enable the capabilities that will send us back there for many, many trips. Follow @NASA_Orion to learn more! - Marcos https://t.co/XdevL9RqHa
Landon, the more you sit in Mission Control the more you come to appreciate the importance of all the positions. It takes a well-rounded team to make space travel possible.	~Boulos https://t.co/ulrnOhLEWw
I have wanted to work at NASA since I was a kid. I have always loved space!  Once I started working at NASA as an intern back in 2001, I heard former Flight Directors Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz speak and my fate was sealed @NASAInterns - Allison https://t.co/eCctENGbG8

Communication delays will be very challenging. Not being able to know what is happening real-time until several minutes after it happens is hard. We will have to become good at staying ahead of the vehicles to support our crews. - Marcos https://t.co/JgVD6iHwNg
Our job is to always keep the following first and foremost in our mind: #1 Keeping the crew safe, #2 keeping the vehicle safe, and #3 completing the mission objectives https://t.co/KMFAKbcRGG
Captain America - Paul	Black Widow - Rebecca	Thor - Allison	Dr. Stange - Adi	Iron Man - Marcos	Black Panther - Pooja https://t.co/e2F8SKcQiI
It is very different for all FDs. Most of us have accumulated experience working in Flight Control as Systems Specialists where we develop the foundations of flight control. Understanding the responsibilities that come with the FD job is a big step in qualifying. - Marcos https://t.co/nogqdWTZ7l

Keeping our astronauts and vehicle safe is the most important thing we do! - Pooja https://t.co/UOTr41iTzm
Aurora - what an awesome space name!  The hardest part about mission control is making critical decisions knowing you're responsible for a huge space station and the 6 people on board it.  And yes, I think the crew members do like art! - Rebecca https://t.co/zMJxN261PU
I'm really excited to continue working with all the new experiments we continue to fly to ISS. Also looking forward to supporting the new commercial cargo and crew vehicles we'll fly in the next few years. - Marcos https://t.co/hc5CYfncJM
We hope so!  We are planning for missions to Mars in the 2030s  -Paul https://t.co/0HjySUI9lQ
Take a look for internship and cooperative education opportunities through your school.  It's a great way to get a foot in the door.  Several of the folks in our Flight Director class started out that way!  Good luck! - Rebecca https://t.co/grlLNW5zmb
I was born in Darlington, England and moved to the US in 1994. - Pooja https://t.co/VXFoJQAwZr

No, we primary use English on the ISS as well as Russian (using interpreters). It is easy to communicate when there is a common goal in mind! - Marcos https://t.co/9tfrZq44k5
Hi Sydney!  My previous jobs, training astronauts to do spacewalks and running the pool have prepared me with problem solving skills and leading teams - 2 skills I will need in the future! - Allison https://t.co/ewW6V8V36C
The way we motive our team members is by putting a lot of emphasis on the team itself! We are only as successful as our team, therefore creating that bond is important - Pooja https://t.co/JKBKB5nhTp
For starters, college degree in STEM fields; gaining experience in critical thinking and decision making.  Space experience is a definite plus!  -Paul https://t.co/rFc3Tv6Mj6
Hi Colton! Flight Controllers in Mission control need to eat because they are human! We sometime lose communication with our satellites which allows us to leave the room and heat up our food. These periods are called Loss of Signal (LOS).	~Boulos https://t.co/WZKU24LPlM
