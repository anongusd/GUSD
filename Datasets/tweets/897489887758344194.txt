@GovMikeHuckabee I can‚Äôt believe how afraid you all are of a first term congresswoman. They can‚Äôt issue executive orders or do ANYTHING by themselves. Wtf do you think she‚Äôs gonna do to you?? 		I think you all just miss Hilary, because you need a boogyman. So you found a new one!
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Qanon? You guys are morons
@realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúHorrific‚Äù huh?? When your own lawyer is saying that, it doesn‚Äôt sound good...		https://t.co/Zwx1F1Iisb
@realDonaldTrump Wow. All that talk about ‚Äúthe art of the deal‚Äù, and that‚Äôs all you got?? Offering nothing, shouting ‚ÄúGIVE ME WHAT I WANT‚Äù!!!! Then having a temper tantrum and storming off like a child is NOT a negotiation. Is EVERYTHING you say just part of this giant con you are pulling?
@senatemajldr You are a coward. You‚Äôre the majority leader of the senate of the United States and you‚Äôre acting like the presidents bitch. Do you suck his dick too? I bet you do.
@seanhannity Damn, she really gets to you huh Sean? I bet she haunts your dreams too, lmao!
@CindyLouHuu @AppSame @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a typo. I meant 90%. 		https://t.co/xvrJbZke1w
@realDonaldTrump You are SUCH A DICK!!! People died in those fires!! Do you just not have the mental capacity to feel human emotions???		And just for the record, these fires are NOT happening because they don‚Äôt rake their forest floors you ignorant piece of garbage.
@AppSame @realDonaldTrump 97% of those drugs come thru ports of entry, which the wall would do NOTHING to stop. If you looked at department of homeland security‚Äôs own numbers, you‚Äôd see that. Trump is pedaling disinformation. It‚Äôs AMAZING to me that his base can‚Äôt see that.
@realDonaldTrump Why would you post this? There was no point at all to this speech. You didn‚Äôt say anything new. You lied about the numbers and circumstances. What do you want, a cookie for somehow managing to read the prompter without going off into a ditch? You are such a petulant child.
I wish they would at least correct it if they insist on covering it. Especially during interviews with administration officials. There is NOTHING more aggravating than watching them tell lie after lie with absolutely no pushback. https://t.co/7VDJy0ZrKY
@GeorgeLakoff @dangillmor I wish they would at least correct it if they insist on covering it. Especially during interviews with administration officials. There is NOTHING more aggravating than watching them tell lie after lie with absolutely no pushback.
Did everyone see the big ‚ÄúChancy‚Äù speech tonight? Lol https://t.co/8cOQ1srYLo
@seanhannity Your a fucking idiot
@realDonaldTrump You said ‚ÄúThey will be coming home, NOW‚Äù!!! You must seriously think we‚Äôre all as stupid as you are! You think you can just make up your own reality every time it suits you?
@realDonaldTrump U are SOOOOO delusional!!! U lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, &amp; BARELY eked out an electoral college win. What friggen landslide are u talking about?!?!? 		Do you REALLY think that u can change reality into anything you want it to be? That may work w ur base, but not us!
@realDonaldTrump When u said this morning that you ‚Äúcan relate‚Äù to federal employees who aren‚Äôt getting paid, u AGAIN showed just how time deaf u are. When have you ever lived paycheck to paycheck? The closest thing I know of is when u went bankrupt and we‚Äôre out on a $450,000 a month budget
@realDonaldTrump 2 out of 3 Americans don‚Äôt want to waste money on ur stupid wall. Democrats just won a historic election victory BECAUSE this country is sick of u! 		The federal government is SUPPOSED to serve the people, but now it seems like the whole thing exists to serve u, &amp; that‚Äôs not ok!
@realDonaldTrump Whatever your smoking, PLEASE STOP!! You need professional help.
@realDonaldTrump How many more times do you think you have to say this before you think it magically becomes reality??
@realDonaldTrump Holy shit. I can‚Äôt even take listening to you anymore. Are you high????? Wtf is going on in that tiny little brain of yours?? You are a fucking mess man, you need serious professional help.
@realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt seem to understand how trade deals work. Mexico isn‚Äôt giving us a pile of cash for working out a trade deal. So what money are you talking about that will be paying for the wall?
@realDonaldTrump Most drugs come through ports of entry. If you looked at the stats available to you, you‚Äôd know that. Of course you‚Äôd have to have someone read it to u, and somehow make it about you, so they can keep your attention.
@realDonaldTrump Your an idiot.
@KellyannePolls just saw your interview on state of the union. You are a disgusting, soulless, sorry excuse for a human being. Do you really think that talking louder and talking over someone makes you right? You make me sick
@realDonaldTrump Wtf is wrong with you??? Are you incapable of ANY human emotion? Two children die in your administration‚Äôs custody and your first reaction is to use it as s political tool?? You should be ashamed of yourself, although shame is probably another emotion your not capable of feeling

RT @stonecold2050: ‚ÄúDear Twitter Friends ;		Whatever you do, please don‚Äôt share this picture. Rumor has it, it would greatly upset Donald T‚Ä¶
@AiyaMelinde @realDonaldTrump Yea, in a lot of ways he was MORE dangerous than Trump. At least Trump looks and sounds as crazy and stupid as he is. Reagan did some fucked up shit with a smile on his face and a gentle soothing voice. He was a lot better at disguising what a monster he was.
@AiyaMelinde @realDonaldTrump Yea, too many people have historical amnesia when it comes to Reagan. His REAL legacy is busted unions; widening income gap; deregulation which lead to market crashes every 10 years since; Iran contra &amp; all the other nations we messed with for no good reason, etc., etc.
@SenBobCorker Merry Christmas senator.
@RWPUSA @WarlickLeslie I wish it were that easy, but the party formerly known as republican would have to stand against him, and they won't do that. They should take those flag pins off their jackets &amp; replace them with Trump heads, because they sold our constitution for that tiny handed orange jackass
@realDonaldTrump Do you even understand what reality is?? I can't even imagine what it must be like inside your warped mind, but it MUST be horrifying!
Can someone please explain to me how @realDonaldTrump, who lies more than any public figure in recorded history, is loved by his base for ‚Äútelling it like it is‚Äù????? 		He doesn‚Äôt tell ANYTHING like it is!! The man doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what reality is!
@ElusiveX99 @cxcope @realDonaldTrump Yea, I don‚Äôt know if anything would work at this point. Some people don‚Äôt understand the difference between sources like Washington post and some meme they saw on Facebook. Too many people are judging the accuracy of news by whether or not they agree with it.
@SenBobCorker Twitter rants aren‚Äôt gonna stop him. You, and everyone else in the GOP senate could‚Äôve. But none of you did. Making a snide remark here &amp; there, then going back to business as usual, isn‚Äôt gonna stop him. The GOP needs to remove their lips from his ass and DO SOMETHING!!!
@cxcope @realDonaldTrump He actually bankrupted 3 casinos. Plus an airline, a football league, multiple hotels, etc., etc. 		This whole mess could‚Äôve been avoided with a simple google search. Anyone who looked into has past would‚Äôve NEVER voted for him.
@realDonaldTrump You are such an idiot. Have you EVER, even once in your life, taken responsibility for ANYTHING? 	All you do is blame him for this, blame her for that. Your the fucking PRESIDENT!!! How about a little less blaming and a lot more fixing!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Would somebody PLEASE take his Fox News away!!!! Your the president Donald!! How up and act like it, &amp; STOP basing all of your decisions on what Hannity, Coulter, Rush Limbah, etc., etc. it‚Äôs ridiculous and it makes you look childish and confused!!
@realDonaldTrump Awww, is the big bad media picking on you Donald? It‚Äôs ok, go Get yourself a lollipop from my desk and go sit in the office for a while and let those media kids calm down. And remember, sticks &amp; stones can break your bones but names can‚Äôt hurt you		You are such a fucking baby!!!
@realDonaldTrump Your SUPPOSED to talk stuff like that over with your cabinet, allies, etc., and come up with a strategy. You however, decided to do it via tweet without telling ANYONE!! Your incompetence scares me
@Jim_Jordan No, you guys just want a wall, which is a waste of money that could be better spent on actual border security. Look at the stats, most drugs, etc., comes in thru ports of entry. It‚Äôs not about facts with u tho, it‚Äôs about sucking Trumps dick because ur afraid of his voters
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôll never pass in the senate. 	#TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump You are destroying our country!!! 	#TrumpResign

@realDonaldTrump U lost your defense secretary &amp; chief of staff, stocks are plunging again, &amp; u tried to pull the Tripp‚Äôs out of Syria via a tweet, w/o telling your own cabinet. &amp; we‚Äôre staring at a government shutdown due 2 ur lack of negotiating skills. 		Anyone tired of all the ‚Äúwinning‚Äù yet?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump pjmedia huh? I‚Äôm sure their a fine news source, rotflmfao!! üòÇüòÇü§òüèªü§òüèª
@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs You getting desperate Gym? Because you sound desperate. 		I can‚Äôt wait to see you assholes in the minority next year. America has had enough of your whining, sniveling, miserable propaganda and constant need to be the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù of some weird ass made up conspiracy. 		#goebbels
@fka_max @MagicAllAroundU @andyburkholder @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan @AnnaFlagg Any uptick in overdoses for those years are due mainly to 2 things, crack and opioids. You can‚Äôt blame the crack epidemic and the opioid epidemic on immigrants. Especially the opioid epidemic, which was started by our own pharmaceutical companies to enhance their profit.
@BkoskosA @newercolossus @seanhannity Parts of the dossier have been verified. But so far NONE of it have been disproven. It‚Äôs an intelligence report, not a prosecutors report. But the guy who gathered it was a 30 year veteran of MI-5 with an impeccable record. The reports of a ‚Äúfake‚Äù dossier is right wing propaganda
@seanhannity Yea, after all the hot air coming from u idiots on Fox, the judge didn‚Äôt rule quite the way u all said he would in ur bullshit laden reporting. 		So why aren‚Äôt u reporting what happened? U ignore all news that u don‚Äôt like. How many sex crazed panda stories can u possibly have?
@realDonaldTrump Your nothing but a two bit thug and a con man, and you know it. That‚Äôs why you desperately tweet all day, repeating the same lies over &amp; over &amp; over, thinking that if u repeat them enough, people will believe them. But all it really does is show how pathetic &amp; sad u really are.
@realDonaldTrump You are a cancer, a shit stain that will be marked in this country‚Äôs history. People will study this period, trying to figure out what the fuck happened to us!! And THAT sir, will be your legacy.
@PressSec You should be ashamed of yourself. History will judge you harshly for using your position and platform to spread self serving lies and propaganda. 		You, Trump, and the rest of the administration will go down in history as a malignant tumor on this fine country‚Äôs reputation
@michaelschweitz Is Mexico gonna pay each trump supporter back for the $80 they each kicked in?? ROTFLMFAO!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@PressSec NOTHING you say has any base in reality!! Your all sounding more &amp; more like POTUS every day. You can‚Äôt just lie your way out of 17 investigations.
@molly_knight Here ya go. I hope your day gets better :-) https://t.co/fYHf8dVdU1
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Gotta keep ur supporters angry and ignorant huh. 		Guys like u don‚Äôt run on issues, u run on emotions - 2 of them specifically. FEAR &amp; ANGER.  U don‚Äôt care at all about the truth, it‚Äôs all about keeping your constituents angry and giving them someone to be angry with.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS The reason Yates told them, is because there is SUPPOSED to be a separation of the DOJ and president. The A.G. Is the liaison. POTUS doesn‚Äôt understand how our system works.		Are u REALLY so ignorant that I didn‚Äôt know that? Or does the truth just not fit ur propaganda.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS He was told by the proper person, acting attorney general Sally Yates. He did nothing about it for 18 days, until he was forced into it by media scrutiny
@Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod I read the book, but too many people haven‚Äôt. Now Trump is using your words to call for an immediate end to the investigation, even though we know that the dossier was NOT the reason the investigation was started. 		Trump will continue to spin this no matter what anyone says now
@realDonaldTrump NONE of the dossier has been disproven. However, there are things in it that have turned out to be true. So everything your saying is a LIE! You just can‚Äôt help yourself can you? Do you even know what reality is? Because you seem to live in a fantasy bubble of your own making
@RightWingWatch Wow. I bet he said that without a drop of sarcasm didn‚Äôt he. Wtf is wrong with these people?
@realDonaldTrump There will never be a state tv in this country. Why? Because it‚Äôs NOT a dictatorship, no matter how badly you want it to be.
@realDonaldTrump You are out of ur f&amp;@$ing mind!! You sound more panic stricken and crazy every time you tweet.
@realDonaldTrump Just like we have to deal with your CONSTANT lies, all day every day. 		Face it, you have lost all credibility. The only people still listening are those who are so delusional that they believe literally ANYTHING you tell them to believe, &amp; that group is shrinking everyday.
@realDonaldTrump News isn‚Äôt fake or false just because you disagree with it
@buntingbird1 @DNimphius @realDonaldTrump No he hasn‚Äôt. First he said that he knew nothing about any payments. Then he said that he only knew later on about them. Then he said that it wasn‚Äôt a crime. Now the story is that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù crime, as in a serious crime.
@chiquibon2 @apocalypsebiker @LouDobbs Yes he gave up that $400,000 a year, but he‚Äôs charged the secret service over a quarter million just in golf cart rental fees so far. He gets rent from SS at his tower, etc. he‚Äôs collecting millions from the government for all kinds of things.
@LouDobbs It‚Äôs worth every penny!! How much did the GOP Spend investigating Hilary Clinton over &amp; over &amp; over again with no indictments, no evidence of anything? At least Mueller is showing results. Multiple indictments, multiples guilty pleas, etc.
@realDonaldTrump To you and all republicans who keep trying to destroy healthcare for millions of people, then have the nerve to run on being the defenders of people with pre-existing conditions in the mid terms when they realized people actually wanted coverage, all I have to say is FUCK YOU!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Oh just stop. Your not fooling anyone, and the more times you tweet about how many people wanted the job, the more we know how hard of a time you had filling it. 		You LIE!!! CONSTANTLY!!
@DNimphius @realDonaldTrump Trump himself said that Flynn lied when he fired him. Trump has changed his story so many times that NOBODY can keep track. So to the ppl who believe him, which version do u believe? Or do u just believe whichever version he‚Äôs puking up that day?
@realDonaldTrump You LIE!!! You‚Äôve changed your story so many times I don‚Äôt think ANYONE can keep track of which version your currently telling people. 		Oh and if Flynn never lied, what was it you fired him for? Are you changing ANOTHER story?
@realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell Really?? No matter what she said, YOU have no moral high ground here. You have offended MILLIONS of Americans, over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over.... well, u get the point.
@stevedickman @andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Lmao!! Seth Rich, Uranium 1. Can you believe that shit is STILL going around???? 		I like to ask them what they think those things are, because I found that most of them have NO idea. They just roll with whatever Fox News says that day
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan You forgot to mention how she ran a child sex ring out of a pizza parlor, lmfao!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 		Judging by your response, you either don‚Äôt understand what the word delusion means, or you live in a bubble.
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan As for whitewater, what exactly do you even think that is? I would LOVE to hear you explain what u think happened there, lol
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Here‚Äôs the story about Seth Rich:		https://t.co/fq8L5XIPAj
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan The facts about uranium 1:		https://t.co/Bx3hge2Ekf
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan .... you need to check another news source besides Fox News, because nothing you said in your reply is valid, AT ALL.
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan ... they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. It was a land deal. 	As for emails, it was investigated exhaustively! If she did anything worthy of an indictment, she would have been indicted. Besides, half of trumps administration are using private emails now too...
@andyburkholder @stevedickman @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Uranium 1 was also passed by the defense and 8 other departments that had NOTHING to do with her! What do u think uranium 1 is? 	Seth Rich? Fox News has to publicly apologize to his family for dragging that conspiracy theory on &amp; on. 	Whitewater was investigated multiple times..
@stevedickman @andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Exactly!!!! The same people that STILL chant ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù. They believe EVERYTHING that Trump, a pathological liar who‚Äôs lied over 6000 times since taking office, while just ignoring every report, article, etc., that they don‚Äôt agree with. I‚Äôve never seen mass delusion like this
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôve never once heard trump say ‚Äúnobody was supposed to take me literally‚Äù in any of the hundreds of times he‚Äôs been questioned about Mexico paying for the wall since he took office. 		You do realize that he‚Äôs a pathological liar right? Please don‚Äôt tell me u think he‚Äôs truthful
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Ok. Well what I meant was, if this was never supposed to be taken literally, then what was that whole scrape about right after he took office, when Mexico said they were not gonna pay for the wall, and Trump flipped out, cancelled a plan visit by Mexico, etc?
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan I said WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OFFICE. Read before responding. And it sure as hell seemed like they took him literally when all those idiots kept chanting it at his hitler, I mean trump rallies. 		The man is a pathological liar. If his mouth is open, he‚Äôs usually lying.
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan But your right. Only an idiot would think that Mexico was gonna give us hard currency to pay for the wall. And that idiot is Donald trump, because he‚Äôs the only person who believed that. That‚Äôs why relations with Mexico broke down after he took office when they said they wouldnt
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Here. This woman said it better than I can: https://t.co/40EFz2ensa
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan So any money we save counts as a gift from Mexico? Any money saved in this deal belongs to the American taxpayers. You do understand that right? Trump promised that it wouldn‚Äôt be the taxpayers paying for this wall. Now that‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs doing. No matter how u word it
@andyburkholder @demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Don‚Äôt tell me what I thought. Trump said, multiple times, that ‚ÄúMexico would PAY for the wall‚Äù. When someone says someone will pay for something, what does that mean to you? Because to me, it‚Äôs means that the money for the wall will come in SOME way from Mexico, not from US taxes
@jlatham82 @realDonaldTrump Hahaha!! WELL SAID!!!!
@realDonaldTrump How would a trade deal pay for a wall? U do realize that trade deals are NOT financial transactions right? What they do, is lower the cost of goods traded between countries. How exactly would u use a trade deal to pay for ANYTHING????
@demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @andyburkholder @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Here‚Äôs an article laying out the trade deal. Where in it does it say that Mexico is gonna pay us?? 		https://t.co/U3oUS1knJK
@demtears2017 @MagicAllAroundU @andyburkholder @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan How exactly does a trade deal pay for a wall? How does a trade deal, something neither nation gets any money from, pay for anything? Trade deals lower the price of goods traded between countries, they aren‚Äôt financial transactions. Nobody gets paid for them
@NancyPelosi @Beaufort_Gage I‚Äôm glad that somebody is talking about it. This administration has systematically destroyed the EPA and a lot of our environmental policy. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre TRYING to destroy us.
@andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @joshmerbitz @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Wow. So under your premise, if I robbed someone, but I said that I jacked them, I couldn‚Äôt be charged because ‚Äújacked‚Äù isn‚Äôt a crime? Just because the media calls it collusion, doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not a crime. It‚Äôs called conspiracy, and it is a crime.
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan General Flynn WAS working with the Russians. He plead guilty to lying about it in court. He‚Äôs due to be sentenced for it this week. So I‚Äôm not sure what story your talking about
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan You can‚Äôt just imply that all media lies all the time. Give me specifics. Which news agencies and what specifically did they lie about? Give me something I can fact check
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Who? Who is ‚Äúthey‚Äù? And what did they lie about?
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Accredited news agencies employ editors &amp; fact checkers, &amp; they print retractions when they make a mistake. Too many people just live in a bubble, where the only news they believe is what they agree with. That‚Äôs not news, it‚Äôs propaganda, &amp; it‚Äôs terribly effective
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan So how do you get your information then? If you don‚Äôt watch or read any news
@andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @joshmerbitz @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan No, it doesn‚Äôt seem odd. They report the news, which is the same, or at least it should be, no matter what ur watching or reading. If they were all reporting different things about the same stories, then I‚Äôd worry
@andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @joshmerbitz @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan How so? I don‚Äôt follow your logic. All the news angencies u mentioned are reporting the same news, but they are all separate agencies. So do u think it‚Äôs some GIANT conspiracy?? Does that sound more logical than Fox, who‚Äôs ppl campaign for trump, is just lying??
@MagicAllAroundU @joshmerbitz @andyburkholder @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Agreed!
@MagicAllAroundU @joshmerbitz @andyburkholder @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan I agree. But they still portray themselves as a news network. I think there should be a clear distinction. Wrestling can‚Äôt call itself a sport, and Fox News shouldn‚Äôt be able to call itself news. I‚Äôd settle for ‚Äúnews entertainment‚Äù, lol
@blakehounshell Wow. She missed the mark on that by quite a bit, lol
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Wow!! The biggest bias I‚Äôve seen in recent history is Fox News hosts going on stage at a trump rally to campaign for him and people like hannity talking to him every night on the phone. If Rachel Maddow went on stage to campaign for Obama, she‚Äôs be fired, &amp; rightly so
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan The biggest change in the deal IS the name. What other big changes are there? And it‚Äôs not MY media, it‚Äôs THE media. I get my news from the New York Times, Washington post, Boston globe, LA times, Chicago tribune, etc., etc. respected news outlets that have been around forever
@andyburkholder @joshmerbitz @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan First off, the deal is almost identical to NAFTA. Trump just wanted his name on it. Second, if we pay out of increased profit, WE would still be paying for it!!
@joshmerbitz @andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan I was replying to Andy burkholder
@joshmerbitz @andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan And a wall won‚Äôt stop drugs. Look at the stats, most drugs come in through other methods. Even out of the drugs that do come over the border, most come through in ports of entry. A wall isn‚Äôt going to stop that. It‚Äôs a complete waste of money. We need smart border security.
@joshmerbitz @andyburkholder @MagicAllAroundU @splintered_Fish @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan We don‚Äôt make money from trade deals. Nobody writes us a check for that. I don‚Äôt know where trump is getting this idea that a trade deal will pay for anything??? I would LOVE to hear someone try to explain how that would work.
@realDonaldTrump And the fact that your tweeting, desperately trying to convince us that this is true, shows us that it‚Äôs NOT true. Nobody wants to be your next bitch, especially with the ship going down.
@realDonaldTrump Oh give it up already there individual 1. If you really want your wall, get Mexico to pay for it, like you promised to. Jackass!!
@Jim_Jordan Wasn‚Äôt the promise that Mexico was gonna pay for it??
@splintered_Fish @MagicAllAroundU @stevedickman @c_gkc000 @Jim_Jordan Tariffs are taxes that AMERICAN consumers pay on goods entering the country. They hurt US, not the countries he‚Äôs putting them on
@Jim_Jordan Give it up, you LOST. Elections have consequences
@realDonaldTrump That was a year and a half ago, and BEFORE we had a special counsel. Are you so desperate that you just can‚Äôt stop tweeting?? Because you seem desperate.
@mehdirhasan Well done!! The truth is very rarely a large part of our media today, and I believe that‚Äôs a big reason why we have so many uninformed voters.
@mehdirhasan That is EXACTLY how it needs to be done!! I am so tired of journalists letting Trump‚Äôs people lie on national tv without correcting them. We have a serious problem in this country with uninformed voters and it‚Äôs because there is so much propaganda and lies in our media.
@realDonaldTrump YOU hired him!! Nothing but the best people huh? Do you remember when you said that? You were gonna hire ‚Äúonly the best people‚Äù.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, and no collusion huh? Ok individual 1.
@realDonaldTrump Wtf is a smocking gun???
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Wtf is a smocking gun????
@seanhannity Wow. Do you really think that THIS is the political story you should be talking about now? We have a sitting president who was implicated in multiple felonies and your still taking about emails??
@realDonaldTrump Yea? Well it implicates the fuck out of a guy named ‚Äúindividual 1‚Äù, who is an unnamed candidate for president of the United States. Any idea who that guy is? because he‚Äôs in some shit.
@realDonaldTrump This guy is losing it, and he didn‚Äôt have much sanity to lose him in the first place. 		I‚Äôll save you the suspense. No, the report isn‚Äôt gonna list all of your made up enemies. Nothing you say makes any sense!
@senatemajldr @POTUS @EPA Even?????? Renewables don‚Äôt stand a chance under this administration!
@seanhannity Didn‚Äôt the White House keep the CIA from briefing congress??? That‚Äôs your boy Trump, not the fictional deep state you all love to quote to explain facts that don‚Äôt fit the narrative your trying to shove down your viewers throats.
@RepMattGaetz You are delusional. Your party didn‚Äôt win because your all derelict in your duty to use any oversight power congress has over this president, who is running roughshod over our institutions, courts, laws, etc. congress is NOT supposed to be a subservient arm of the White House!!
@Desert_Racer @Ocasio2018 Wow, that‚Äôs not an informed statement. We are ranked #37 in healthcare in the world. 19 of the top 20 countries have government run universal healthcare. For profit healthcare is an oxymoron, it doesn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs why nobody else uses it.
@realDonaldTrump Wow. YOU are the one who denied having ANYTHING to do with Russia on multiple occasions. Why do you CONSTANTLY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING?!?!?!?		Oh, &amp; as for running for president, don‚Äôt do us any more favors!! Asshole
@realDonaldTrump 32 indictments, 6 guilty pleas, 1 conviction, and still going.		If they‚Äôre ‚Äúin search‚Äù of a crime, they seem to be finding MANY of them.
@harry_cotter3 @realDonaldTrump Yea, and he‚Äôs charged the secret service over a half million so far in golf cart rental fees!!! He‚Äôs giving up $400,000 per year in salary, while taking millions in tax payer money!!
@realDonaldTrump You should be indicted for treason for AGAIN standing with another country against your own country!
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs EXTREMELY frustrating. He‚Äôs done hundreds of things since taking office that, ANY 1 OF, would‚Äôve ended any other presidency. But it like he‚Äôs immune to it!! If he shot a baby in the face at a rally, his supporters would all say how that baby deserved it. It makes no sense!!
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump Mr president, I believe you need to take some courses to help u understand ur surroundings more. Some that would help:	3rd grade civics	2nd grade spelling	2nd grade reading comprehension 	Kindergarten- working with others		U should just repeat elementary school. U missed a LOT!!
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump Oh, and as for Mueller not being approved by the Sentate, he DOESNT HAVE TO BE!! You are the PRESIDENT, how can you possibly be so dumb?? Or do u just count on your base being so dumb?? That will backfire on u. Not sure how, or when, but lying to ur supporters WILL turn them away
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump Our government used to serve the people. Now the people &amp; government exist to serve one man. How did we get here? 		The only hope I have is that the people who turned out last week to vote against this hostile takeover, will show up again in 2020. trump won‚Äôt go quietly
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump ... believe we are in this position. I get so angry when I see people carrying American flags to a trump rally and chanting ‚ÄúUSA USA‚Äù. How can they say they love their country, while at the same time supporting a man who‚Äôs trying to take it over for himself??...
@Beauwhite16 @realDonaldTrump That IS Trump only concern. He thinks the attorney general is his personal attorney, just like he thinks the entire government is there to serve his needs. 1		In 2020, we as a country are gonna have to decide if our loyalty is to the constitution, or to a person. I can‚Äôt even...
@prominentplay @SenBobCorker @ArleBear @washingtonpost @JeffFlake That‚Äôs a GREAT idea!! But even though neither of them ran for re-election, they still seem bound to their party.  Let me put it this way:		If what ur seeing bothers u so much that u need to speak out, then how do u justify supporting those wrongs with your vote, when it matters?
@SenBobCorker @washingtonpost Your words seem hollow, because you don‚Äôt back them up with any action. You are 1 of the few ppl who are in a position to do MORE than just speak out against it. Your term is almost over, time is short. How do you want history to remember you?
@seanhannity Ahahahaahahahaha!!!!	üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£	Even trump thinks your a suck up!!!	https://t.co/XlmbkMI632

@jentaub @realDonaldTrump The water I was drinking came back up and out of my nose from laughing when I read this comment. It was a little messy and uncomfortable, but thanks for the laugh!!  ;-)
@realDonaldTrump Your tweets are starting to STINK with desperation. Do you have evidence to back up ANYTHING you say? No, you just pop off with any weird ass thought that enters your head. You‚Äôve always been crazy, but even by your standards, your REALLY losing it lately
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs ‚ÄúIf they can‚Äôt win the voters‚Äù that‚Äôs an interesting phrase coming from a guy who‚Äôs party is responsible for constant lies, propaganda, gerrymandering and voter suppression nationwide, and stacking courts to win the fights they can‚Äôt win with their propaganda.
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity @FoxNews Wow. YOU, a republican, the party that suppresses votes across this country, gerrymanders districts to nullify the vote from people who might vote against you, stacks the courts to impose their agenda, etc. YOU talk about others being facsist?!?! YOU are the facsist mr Gaetz.
@AnnCoulter My brother is a surgeon, and he‚Äôs had to tell families that they lost loved ones. I talked to him for almost two hours after he did it once, and he was SHATTERED. So if you think they don‚Äôt have a right to comment on this, then FUUUCCCCKKKKK YYOOOUUUUU!!! You nazi bitch.
@seanhannity Lying sack of shit. You and your network are a propaganda arm of the Whitehouse, and you are America‚Äôs Josef Goebbels.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He may be corrupt but he can‚Äôt even hold a candle to your fathers corruption. Taking foreign money, pay to play, tax evasion, and all kinds of other illegal activity from him and most of his cabinet.
RT @repjohnlewis: I have been beaten, my skull fractured, and arrested more than forty times so that each and every person has the right to‚Ä¶
@senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @RepMattGaetz @Jim_Jordan  For a bunch of guys who wear flag pins &amp; preach freedom &amp; democracy, you‚Äôre ACTIONS show the opposite. Voter suppression, gerrymandering, stacking courts, propaganda, etc. These are right out of the fascist playbook.
@420RCtrx4 @randomstimuli @senatemajldr @POTUS I wish it was just an isolated issue caused by a rogue republican, but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs nationwide and systematic. Taking away peoples right to vote is one of the most unamerican things they do. How can they claim to be the party of freedom????
@420RCtrx4 @randomstimuli @senatemajldr @POTUS Yes, exact match IS fucked. So is what they‚Äôre doing to native Americans in Morth Dakota with the PO Box restriction, &amp; in Texas where they have been putting up road blocks to keep students from a black college from voting, even after the scotus sided w the students
Holy shit. This is an ACTUAL, REAL republican campaign add!! It left me speechless and stunned!! https://t.co/OuTL96Bpl4
@notlarrysabato Wow. I am literally STUNNED after hearing that!!! Is he fucking serious!?!?!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @JohnJamesMI @KidRock @TedNugent @kimguilfoyle The president is NOT looking out for the American people, he‚Äôs looking out for HIMSELF, like he always does https://t.co/lNfke10fAW
@joncoopertweets Here‚Äôs yet another example of why this tweets is so true	https://t.co/lNfke10fAW
Here‚Äôs yet ANOTHER example of Trump acting in his own best interests instead of in the best interests of the American people. This is what happens when we elect a president who refuses to separate his business interests.	https://t.co/lNfke10fAW
@realDonaldTrump Here you are AGAIN acting in your own best interest instead of the best interest of the people you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be representing!!	https://t.co/lNfke10fAW
@RealJamesWoods Wow, I never realized you had such a tenuous grasp on reality James Woods. Your page is like Fox News I‚Äôm print, a veritable smorgasbord of right wing propaganda.
@Jim_Jordan Wow. If you were really shadow banned, then how did you get 12.4k retweets and tens of thousands of comments???? I‚Äôm so sick of the CONSTANT complaining!! You are NOT a victim!! You are a U.S. congressman!! So quit your fucking whining and do your job!!
@jheil I'm gonna say illiterate and drunk, and suffering from ignoritis, which seems to be contagious these days.

@realDonaldTrump Pay attention 3 minute, 10 seconds in, when he talks about all of his business dealings with Saudi Arabia. He is a fucking LIAR! He‚Äôs ALWAYS, CONSTANTLY LYING!! https://t.co/OKQ2cx7PaC
@Jim_Jordan Your a fucking lunatic

@420RCtrx4 @senatemajldr @POTUS https://t.co/baIThf5Omx
@420RCtrx4 @senatemajldr @POTUS They suppress the vote by messing with voter registrations any way they can. Look at what‚Äôs going on in Georgia right now. or in eastern Texas, where a democratic candidate‚Äôs staffer was arrested for being a democrat. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, look it up
@Jim_Jordan Holy fuck, you are SOOOO CRAZY!!! Every damn day with this right wing propaganda!! Do you still think your being "shadow banned" too??? lmao!!
@senatemajldr @POTUS How can you say that you believe in democracy? Your party is the party of gerrymandering, voter supression, etc., and now your stacking the courts. If you were representing the PEOPLE, like your supposed to, you wouldn't need the courts to pass your laws. Your about POWER, period
@ali @EricHolder @ryanjreilly ... idiot who shot up the pizza place after ‚Äúpizza gate‚Äù didn‚Äôt hurt anyone.
@ali @EricHolder @ryanjreilly Wow. It‚Äôs funny you should mention inciting violence by democrats, when the biggest inciter of violence is Trump. Have you seen the things he says at his rallies? I‚Äôm actually surprised that none of his crazy ass supporters has shot any reporters yet, and it‚Äôs dumb luck that...
@LindseyGrahamSC How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
@SenatorCollins Is this what you have to tell yourself to be able to sleep at night or look at yourself in a mirror? 		Only one of his accusers was granted a hearing, and none of her witnesses were allowed to testify. 		Besides, his conduct in the following hearing ALONE was enough to disqualify
@RudyGiuliani So basically what you and your party are all saying about Dr. Ford is :		"The democrats screwed her over. We're on her side. We support her. We just don't believe her".
@SenJoniErnst So basically what you and your party are all saying about Dr. Ford is :		"The democrats screwed her over. We're on her side. We support her. We just don't believe her".
@GOP @senatemajldr So basically what you and your party are all saying about Dr. Ford is :		"The democrats screwed her over. We're on her side. We support her. We just don't believe her".
@SenCapito So basically what you and your party are all saying about Dr. Ford is :		"The democrats screwed her over. We're on her side. We support her. We just don't believe her".
@SenatorFischer So basically what you and your party are all saying is :		"The democrats screwed her over. We're on her side. We support her. We just don't believe her".
@senatemajldr Do you know who was really well qualified, and NOT an accused violent sexual predator with a drinking problem and a short fuse? MERRICK GARLAND!!!!
@senatemajldr I have a question. What the hell species are you???? There is nothing human about you. Not the way you look, OR act.
@senatemajldr I'm so tired of EVERYTHING about you. YOU SUCK!!
@senatemajldr ...and propaganda. You and your party take advantage of peoples anger and fear, that's how you run your campaigns. How many republican  presidential candidates have won the POPULAR vote in the last 20 years?? IF you don't know, its ONE! You do NOT represent us!!!
@senatemajldr I'm tired of your "holier than thou" rants. Your pissed because your stacking of the courts is being challenged. But why do you need to stack the courts in the 1st place? Is it because your party does NOT have a majority? You win elections with gerrymandering, voter suppression..
@senatemajldr Holy shit, would you PLEASE get down off of your high horse!! YOU started this shit with Merrick Garland, PERIOD!! Also, your current nominee is a fucking sexual predator!! Your party is only in power because of the electoral college and gerrymandering. You don‚Äôt represent us!
@senatemajldr You have got a lot of nerve bitching about obstructing. MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND!!!!
@Jim_Jordan congratulations. you weakened our country today. happy now?
@JohnJHarwood Funny he should say that after what he did to Merrick Garland.
@SenateMajLdr The only people you ‚Äústand with‚Äù are your donors. Asshole
@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley I saw your little speech. The only thing I have to say to you is MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND!! Oh, and Fuck Yoooouuuuuu!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Holy shit. You are SUCH A DICK!!! Are you just gonna deny they ever even existed next?  They were PEOPLE!! And they were American citizens!! How much of a piece of garbage are you!?!?!?!
@RepMattGaetz Results? The economy has been steadily improving for 9 STRAIGHT YEARS! You guys didn't do that, unless you time traveled. You, Jordan, Meadows, etc., all of you run your mouths about shadow banning, the economy, etc. Its all just propaganda. Thats really all you have, PROPAGANDA.
@RepMattGaetz We want DEMOCRACY! Not this autocratic, crazy ass dictator wannabe with the mentality of a fifth grader. This election may be our last chance to save the country from you assholes who want to turn it over to Trump. This election WILL be a statement by us, the people. Remember us?
@Jim_Jordan Holy shit. EVERY FUCKING DAY I see tweets from you, talking about how nobody can see your tweets!!! How the hell are you getting thousands of comments from people, telling you to SHUT THE FUCK UP, if nobody can see your tweets??? Enough with the bullshit propaganda already!!!
@FoxNews @RudyGiuliani @POTUS 17 angry democrats? I thought it was 13? Or do you just insert any number you feel like every time you spew that little piece of propaganda?
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump What the hell happened to you? I used to respect you, but you sold your soul for a few rounds of golf with the president. Your heading in the same direction as Rudy Jiulianni. Your turning into a complete joke, a sad sack who the old you wouldn't recognize.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump The economy was weak because BUSH and the republican party since Reagan, destroyed it with deregulation, union busting, etc. When Obama took office, we were in big trouble. When he left office, we were in great shape. So what "results" are you talking about?
@realDonaldTrump I saw what you said last night about the op-ed being "treason". If saying negative things about you is treason, then isn't all the things you said about Obama when he was president also treason? Using your own logic it would have to be.
@realDonaldTrump Wow. Your own staff think your losing it, and our allies are losing hope, but Chairman Kim still thinks you are doing well. If that is meant to calm our worries, you missed your mark, by A LOT!
@SenateMajLdr SO WAS MERRIK GARLAND!!
@Janet4OH Jordan has completely lost his mind. If I lived in your district, I would vote for you. But since I can't, maybe I can help in other ways. If there's anything I can do, like retweeting, etc., just let me know.
@Jim_Jordan Where do you get this shit from? Absolutely NONE of it is true. Its all PROVABLY false!! Are you gorging on rightwing media or are you just making it up?
@Jim_Jordan Christopher Steele is a British citizen who spent 30 years as the head of the Russian desk at MI-6. He couldn't care less one way or another about Trump. Also, he didn't know who he was gathering intel for. 		ENOUGH with the lies and propaganda there Goebbels.. I mean Jordan!
@Jim_Jordan #Jordin_is_the_new_Josef_Goebbels
@Jim_Jordan Holy shit, would you PLEASE Shut the fuck up already!?!?! Every fucking day I see a tweet from you, bitching about how nobody can see your tweets. Yet me and a thousand other people are commenting, telling you "We see your tweets!! Now please stop spewing this propaganda"!!!
@realDonaldTrump How can you sound so confident, yet have NO CLUE what your talking about. So you understand google's algorithm now? Nobody knows the exact algorithm, but its based on "pagerank", which sorts websites according to popularity. Political affiliation has NOTHING to do with it dumbass
@Jim_Jordan It's not a glitch. Your all just dirty, rotten, lying, propaganda spreaders, and people are confused enough already without your bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC The attorney general is not YOUR personal attorney!! He is there to enforce the laws in the constitution, not to be a loyal servant to you!!
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain You should all listen to what he said last year about regular order and working together. He was a good man. I cant say the same for most of the rest of you.
@Jim_Jordan Holy shit. Every day with this shit. How much bullshit propaganda are you gonna post? Are you trying to outdo Josef Goebbels in propaganda output? 		LET IT GO!! You guys are gonna lose in November, because u chained yourselves to  a mentally ill, hostile, childish mainiac.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yea, we need to impeach her!!! lol.		Who the hell cares about Hillary!?!?!?!? Are you THAT desperate to change the subject?
@realDonaldTrump The "other" side??? As is our POLITICAL enemies??? You are such a jackass. You don't even understand the words coming out of your own mouth do you?
@MangoMussolini3 @realDonaldTrump McRaven also called his tactics "McCarthy-era tactics" in that letter. I KNOW Trump doesn't know who McCarthy is, so a staffer probably told him. Now he's projecting it to someone else like a 5 year old. 		"I am rubber, you are glue". "Im not McCarthy, your McCarthy"!!!
@realDonaldTrump A retired Admiral calls Trumps tactics "McCarthy like", and now he's using it on other people. 		"I'm not McCarthy, YOUR McCarthy"!! Says Trump. Its the ole "I am rubber, you are glue" technique. Very mature.
@realDonaldTrump Wow. We know who McCarthy is dumbass. You probably didn't until you saw that letter from JSOC commander McRaven, when he used it to talk about your "McCarthy era tactics:".		I'm sure you asked a staffer what it meant, and now your projecting it to someone else like a 5 year old.
@Jim_Jordan @jack You are such a paranoid ass hat!! Maybe you got shadow banned for consenting to pedophilia, not political ideology? 		Also, lying and spreading propaganda to protect a criminal president is NOT political ideology, its PROPAGANDA!! Got that Goebbels??  I mean Jordan?
@Jim_Jordan Ummmm... When the the FBI "fire" Chris Steele - a citizen of the U.K., who spent most of his adult life working for british intelligence, MI-6, NOT the FBI? I didn't realize the FBI had the athority to fire agents of intelligence agencies from other countries.
@JanetLGO @JoeBarri Is that true? This is the first I've heard of It, but if it is true, it would explain a LOT about his rallies.
@JoeBarri ...they defend him. I've never seen anything like it!! Every time he does something bad I keep thinking "This is gonna be the one that finally turns them away from him". Then, I see the posts and tweets from them supporting the HORRIBLE thing he just did!!! I'm out of ideas?!!?!?
@JoeBarri I have family that I've known my whole life that support him &amp; I STILL don't get it. It's like they live in some alternate dimension called oppositeville, where everything Trump does is the exact OPPOSITE of what he does here on Earth. It seems like the worse he does, the more...
@MegaChurchMouse @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/q1RnTMnvBQ
@MegaChurchMouse @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump .... ANYTHING they can say, just to keep changing the subject. Its EXHAUSTING!!!! I gave up arguing with them. Its like trying to talk to a brick wall. An angry, racist brick wall.
@MegaChurchMouse @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump I believe the tweet was about Trump's logic. The "whataboutism" coming from cult 45 is getting worse every day. They have no way to defend their position, so they just yell "Well what about Hilary?", or "What about Obama?", or "What about flying circus monkeys on crack?"....
@RepMarkMeadows The FBI doesn't release info that could damage this and all future investigations just because you want them to, you fascist piece of garbage!! 		You guys backed a bum horse (Trump). Just deal with it and stop taking it out on the rest of the government and all of us!!!
@Jim_Jordan Its an ONGOING INVESTIGATION dumbass!!!! You wouldn't want to make the FBI give away secrets that could damage all future investigations, would you? Oh yea, that's right, you would! And since your prolly gonna be facing a sex abuse to minors investigation yourself, ur compromised
RT @MangoMussolini3: Ok  #Resisters Looking for some love #FBRparty.  	Please:  	1 Like 	2 Retweet 	3 Follow 	4 I follow back		 Copy this t‚Ä¶
@RepMattGaetz @Twitter Wow. Tou must be drinking your own koolaid huh? The GOP is launching a coop, a hostile takeover of our government, will of the people be dammed, huh? But we see thru you Gaetz! We see thru all of you!
@Jim_Jordan @SenSchumer I am so sick of all of you and the propaganda coming out of your mouths!! Anyone with half a brain and who watches the news knows its not that simple. But you guys are counting on your voters being dumb, or you wouldn't dare say this shit. Your all just Trump puppets now.
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump ...of the people? Do you care nothing about what the people want? What your doing in unamerican and facsist, and I HOPE the dems can muster enough votes to overcome your gerymander. Because if the gop keeps control, i truly beieve that Trump will destroy us &amp; you wont stop him.
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump You seem to be OBBSESSED with packing the court with as many consevative puppets as possible. But why? Are you afraid your gerrymandering and voter supression laws wont be enough to kepp you in the majority? 	You want to jam your politics down our throats. What about the will...
@kateshepnerd @realDonaldTrump I guess you haven't read his book "the art of the deal"?
@MastersShelby @realDonaldTrump "keep your own doctor" wasn't the president of the United States trying to bury a crime.  And he didn't say it OVER &amp; OVER &amp; OVER. So how exactly was it like that?
@Jim_Jordan Here's the report @Jim_Jordan I must've missed the part where it said that the dossier wasn't credible. Why don't you show us where it says that, you lying sack of crap:		https://t.co/mFkOQFKPm3
@Jim_Jordan Wow. You guys are REALLY pushing out the propaganda! Are you REALLY that confident that your supporters won't bother to read it? Because if they do, they're gonna realize that it doesn't say that, AT ALL!!
@realDonaldTrump "You can get people to believe anything. It doesn't matter if it's true or not, if you say it enough times, people will start to believe it".		--Donald Trump (from "The art of the deal)		So, how many times do you think you have to lie to get people to believe it Mr. Trump??

@jheil LOVE the profile pic!! Can you imagine how Thompson would've felt about our politics if he were alive today?
@RogerMarshallMD @MSNBC I saw your interview. That was a SAD display of subservience. Trump said "I meant to say wouldn't"? Seriously? To believe that, you would also have to believe that when he said "Putin's denial was strong &amp; powerful &amp; i believe him", that he meant "I don't believe him".
@realDonaldTrump Remember at the debate when Clinton called you a puppet? You got SOO MAD! Funny how you let Putin stick his hand up your ass and work your mouth in front of the WHOLE WORLD! 	#TrumpPuppet	#Treason
@realDonaldTrump Translations:		Many people at high levels = "I spoke to nobody &amp; I'm just making this up".		We got along well = "I was totally subservient &amp; agreed with everything he said".		Haters = Anyone who doesn't accept whatever word garbage is currently coming out of his mouth.
@realDonaldTrump Which high level intelligence people? Name ONE, at ANY level, I DARE YOU!!
@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/LEXWflRw60
@realDonaldTrump "I meant to say wouldn't"? Do you think ANYONE bought that? They would have to disreguard the rest of your statement, "Putin strongly &amp; powerfully denied it, &amp; I believe him". Lemme guess, you said "denied" but meant to say "admittied"? Fucking traitor!
I thought this captured yesterday's summit pretty well: https://t.co/zcokrGvnUC
@Jim_Jordan How about Dan Coats? Or the senate intelligence committee? Because they agree with those people you mentioned. 		How about Trump? Can we trust him? THAT seems like the bigger question right now. After yesterday, if your not asking that, your part of the problem.
@MichaelCohen212 @ABC @GStephanopoulos I hope you can see how dangerous Trump is to our country by now. PLEASE, do the right thing and tell Mueller what you know. We're all counting on you.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul And to his base - all this "whataboutism" is getting old. Changing the subject to what Obama did or what Hilary did doesn't change that awful display of cowardice and shame that Trump displayed yesterday in front of the whole world.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul You are a traitor. I don't know all of your reasons yet, but hopefully we all will soon. Your base may be blind, but the majority of this country is watching and we know who you are, all sniveling coward, who talks tough because your so afraid we'll see right thru you. Btw, we do
@influx_Divine Settle down there Josef Goebbels, don't use my tweets in your weird ass propaganda tirades.
@hollygolytlee @AynRandPaulRyan @SenateMajLdr And don't forget he changed the entire nomination procedure from 60 votes to 51 to get Trump's first guy in. McConnell does anything he wants to. Rules and norms don't concern him, as long as he gets his way.  They're gonna shove their ideology down our throats.
@SenateMajLdr Wow. This coming from the guy who refused to even consider Obama's nomination, before he chose one, and who changed the rules of the nomination proceedure to get Trump's first pick in. Fucking hypocrite.
@NicolleDWallace Muellers silence speaks volumes!! üíó tht, Thank You Nicolle.
@PressSec @POTUS It sucks being discriminated against, right? Now imagine that happening to you every day, at any time, and maybe you could START to realize what minority, LGBTQ, andany other people go thru every day. And your bosses policies are making things worse for many ppl.
@GovernorTomWolf You have our vote!
@GovernorTomWolf Thank You Governor Wolf!! ‚ù§‚ôøProud Pennsylvanian
@Scaramucci @POTUS This is a policy put in place by Jeff Sessions. Trump could EASILY end it if he wanted to, but he's instead trying to score political points by lying &amp; blaming democrats. He'll pay for this one tho. Ive seen the first cracks in his bases loyalty over this.
@realDonaldTrump You seem to think that a good economy should buy u a pass for criminal activity, but it doesn't work that way. Your day of reckoning is coming.
@WholeLottaRosex OMG!! Hate seems to be trending &amp;&amp; shit like tht can lead to someone losing their life. üòû Not cool.
@LawProfButler Hi Paul. I just saw you on Deadline whitehouse and I wanted to say thank you, for sticking up for the rest of us! Too often they refer to the 37% like their all of us. Some 63% of us are worried every day if our country &amp; democracy will survive this president.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @SteveDoocy @POTUS Is this the kind of crap your passing off as news now? I never thought I'd say this, but this is beneath even you Fox.
@AlanDersh @JustinTHaskins I saw your interview on MSNBC this morning. Why should Paul Manafort not be sent to jail pre-trial? Hundreds of thousands of people are in jail pre-trial right now. Is Paul Manafort better than them? Does he deserve special treatment?
Paul Manafort's bail was just revoked. He was sent to jail to await trial.
@RepMattGaetz Thats why he was fired almost a year ago dumbass
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS What did he get done? He praised Kim like they were dating, &amp; the only concession was by us, to end military excercises.
@Macgyver2921 How sadly true that is.
@saffire037 @seanhannity Did you see the show? Or just hear the clip that fox news played?
@Solipsy @alittlemiracle1 @EricHolder @SharylAttkisson ...be that way. You can tell a lot about any society by how they treat the poorest &amp; sickest among them. What does that say about us? The richest country in human history, where even people with insurance still go bankrupt because of major illnesses.
@Solipsy @alittlemiracle1 @EricHolder @SharylAttkisson Yep. We have many treatments, but none of them are afforable for anyone but the richest of us. The way the GOP keeps going after medicare &amp; medicaid, I worry a lot about her healthcare. We're lucky in that my little brother is a Dr &amp; we could always go to him, but it shouldnt...
@FoxNews So from reading some comments, it seems like most fox viewers would rather opinions that agree with them, than actual news. Shep is 1 of the only people on fox that could be considered a journalist. He's a dying breed on fox, who never let the truth get in the way of a good story
@Solipsy @alittlemiracle1 @EricHolder @SharylAttkisson My fiance also has MS. Our healthcare system is a disgrace. We're the richest country on earth, yet we cant do something that all other developed countries do, take care of our sick. For profit healthcare doesnt work, its an oxymoron. But with GOP in power, it will never change.
@RepMattGaetz @bpolitics You should listen to your collegues, Trey Gowdy, Paul Ryan, and others, who have more information on it than you do, and who say they haven't seen any evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI. Enough with this bullshit propaganda already, its getting ridiculous!
@realDonaldTrump , what the hell happened to your architect Trump? Looks pretty suspect...		content://media/external/file/71334
@realDonaldTrump Whats going on with this guy!?! Sounds pretty suspect Trump.		https://t.co/0YNODi1xFx
@realDonaldTrump Better be careful up there in Canada. If Justin Trudeu is capable of buring down the White House, who knows what he's capable of? ROTFLMFAO!!!!üòÇüòÇ	You are so stupid its comical!!!
Back in Nazi Germany, people were forced to go to Hitler's rallies, &amp; if you weren't cheering loudly enough, you might get a knock on your door that night from the Ghestapo. So when I see Trump try to force patriotism on people, it makes me VERY VERY nervous.

@SpeakerRyan And now u &amp; the GOP are systematically destroying everything they fought to create by shirking your duty to act as a check on a president with obvious distain for our constitution, rule of law, &amp; democracy. If he gets his way, history will remember you as the party that ended us

@saffire037 @seanhannity I thought her statment was right on point. She wasn't picking on Ivanka as the presidents daughter, she was making a statment about how a senior white house official that swore she would protect women, stood by &amp; said NOTHING when this barbaric policy was put in place.
@UWS4TRUMP @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump What treason did he committ exactly? This should be good.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Thats not collusion dumbass!!		But keep up your ranting. I bet it'll even work &amp; NOBODY will vote for Obama this election. Dont forget to toss a couple jabs at Hillary in there. We really need to impeach her! Lol
@realDonaldTrump There are WAY too many republicans running on the "I love Trump" ticket. If they hold onto their majorities, what we will be left with is a party even more subserviant to Trump. Make no mistake, THIS is how democracy's fall. If u think it cant happen here, ur wrong. PLEASE VOTE!!
@The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump Imagine if the GOP held their majorities in both houses. How would Trump see that? I think he'd see it as a sign that America is behind him, &amp; if that happens, I believe the gloves will REALLY come off. We desperately need a check on this president!! PLEASE PLEASE VOTE!!
@The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump We keep sliding backwards, &amp; Trump isnt doing this alone. He has a LOT of help from most of the GOP. Their refusal to act as a check on him is dereliction of duty, and some are even actively colluding with him. This election in November may be our last chance to stop this.
RT @The_UnSilent_: What the hell is his bullshit???		Wanna know why we kneel @realDonaldTrump?  https://t.co/x1RwiDpeeR
@realDonaldTrump PLEASE, if you ever cared about our freedom, our way of life, about everything this country is, then PLEASE get out there &amp; vote this November!!! Lets all say with one voice that we do NOT stand for tyranny, dictatorship, and subjegation!!
@realDonaldTrump November is getting closer, &amp; if republicans keep majorities in both houses, we all know that Trump will see that as a sign that we're all with him. And then the gloves REALLY come off. This midterm may be our last chance to triage democracy &amp; our constitution. Keep that in mind.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is what he is. He's not intelligent enough to change even if he wanted to. What he is doing is enacting a hostile takover of this country. But he wouldnt be able to do that alone. The GOP so far has seemed more than happy to help him, but why? What do they gain from it?
@realDonaldTrump As the November election approaches, I think all Americans need to ask themselves this question. "Why is the GOP trying to destroy democracy &amp; our constitution"? Their refusal to act as a check on Trump, &amp; with some of them actively colluding with him, we may be in real trouble.

Does anyone ACTUALLY believe that the president is above the law? I'm really curious here, and would love to hear your reasoning for your belief.
@TheAvgBlackMan @realDonaldTrump I find it remarkable that his supporters just ignore all of this. If it was Obama doing these things, republicans hair would literally be on fire about it! I know Fox news doesnt report these things, but unless they wall themselves off from all other tv &amp; social media, they heard
@realDonaldTrump That is total BULLSHIT and you know it! Or maybe you dont, your obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But either way, just saying anything you want, without any reguard for truth, WILL catch up to you. Hopefully sooner than later.
@blazingxmexican Evangelicals are the worst kind of hypocrats. They prop up a mad man because they believe he serves their agenda. One day they will realize what everyone who deals with Trump realizes, that Trump only cares about 1 person, himself.
@TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Well said!!! I am so sick &amp; tired of hearing people say that "Trump wasxsent by god". Im not a religous person, but I was raised catholic &amp; I know that Trump doesnt represent Jesus in ANY WAY, FULL STOP!
@BarackObama Mr president, I heard that you were questioning if you were wrong or too early. All I can say in my humble opinion is that the world is a better place because you were there. I miss so much having a thoughtful, human president. Thank you for your service sir.
@realDonaldTrump Yea, but your golf trips have cost the government over $50 million so far, so are you sure you wanna start pinching pennys now?
@realDonaldTrump Besides, do you REALLY wanna go there over the C word? You've used it yourself many times, as well as using the P word in the access hollywood tape. So, by your standard, shouldn't YOU be fired?
@realDonaldTrump Rosanne used a racial slur, while Samantha Bee just used a vulger word, but used it to make a GREAT point about your hypocryte bitch daughter, who pretends to be for women, but said NOTHING about your policy of ripping babies away from parents at the border.
@seanhannity If your gonna go at her for using the C word, then Trump is fair game for using the P word on the access hollywood tape. So I guess Samantha Bee &amp; Trump should resign.
@seanhannity Samantha Bee didnt use a racial slur. I know that racism is as normal at fox news as misonformation &amp; propaganda, but for the rest of us, there's a difference.
@RepMattGaetz 83% of your tax cut went to the top 1%, so spare us the whole "working families" bullshit.
@MalcolmNance Wow, that is MESSED UP!!!! I used to be proud to be an American, but I'm not anymore.
How the hell did this happen? I cant read anything on my twitter. It looks like the pic I attached https://t.co/5iQyckQs4W
@realDonaldTrump And do you NOT realize that so much of what you say is on camera now? I dont know if your aware of this, but they can replay that footage anytime they want to. So who the hell do you think your kidding?
@realDonaldTrump Or how about the next day when you had Russians in the oval office, and you said that there was so much pressure from the Russia investigation, &amp; now that you fired Comey, that pressure was removed. You might not remember what you said 5 minutes ago, but the rest of us do!
@realDonaldTrump You sound like your typing from your friend's mom's basement, where your holled up with pizza pockets and tin foil hats, just ranting about the government and conspiracies.
@realDonaldTrump YOU SAID IT ON NATIONAL TV!!! How stupid do you think we are? You think we cant remember your interview with Lester holt last year when you said "I thought to myself, this russer thing with russia is a made up story"....
@realDonaldTrump Holy shit, just shut the fuck up already!!! Your guilty, and your ranting constantly to try to convince us your not. Just let it go. Your meat head followers believe anything you say, and the rest of us have known you were guilty for a while now, so LET IT GO!!!
@realDonaldTrump Thats because what the news reports say about you is true! You should be apologizing to that disabled reporter, that gold star family, john mccain, rosie odonnell, every woman u evet met, your wife, your ex wives, and us US citizens &amp; citizens across the world!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You do know that Mueller is a republican right? And that he's a purple heart recipient &amp; decorated vietnam veteran, who spent his entire career in public service. He led the FBI thru the 9/11 attacks. 		But I'm sure you have GOOD reasons for slandering him? So lets hear them!
@realDonaldTrump Wow. You tweet 2 hours ago that you didnt have time for this &amp; needed to focus on north korea, etc.	You have the attention span of a stick!!
@realDonaldTrump You are such a whining, miserable baby!! You won, a year &amp; a half ago, and you STILL wont shut up about it!!

@olin_guy @dkong7 @realDonaldTrump ...and over. We want better infrastructure, a fair immigration policy, a better minimum wage. All you people on the right were cheering for that tax cut, while 83% of it went to the top 1%. But itll be us who have to deal w the trillion dollar hole it created.
@olin_guy @dkong7 @realDonaldTrump We dems believe in better access to healthcare for all and better education for our kids. Those teacher strikes we're happening in NY, or california.

@TeaPainUSA ...giving our country to the top 1%. The neocon movement is responsible for the deindustrialization of the US; the busting of unions; the deregulation of our finance industry that resulted in a crash &amp; recession about every 10 years since Reagan started it. They are destroying us
@TeaPainUSA ...control those votes. The only people they actually care about are their donors. But there's not enough of them to win an election, so they spew propaganda &amp; pretend to be fellow gun nuts &amp; god nuts every election. Then when they win, they get right down to the business of...
@TeaPainUSA ...voters, like gun nuts, religious zealots, abortion nuts, white nationalists, etc. The GOP doesnt care about these issues. They just know that all they have to do is convince the gun nuts that the democrats are trying to take their guns away, etc., &amp; they know that they can...
@TeaPainUSA I've been saying that for years. Theres a reason that the GOP has to rely on things like voter suppression, gerrymandering, &amp; other tactics to get elected. Because they dont have the support of the people. Its also why they have to rely on a loosly held coalition of 1 issue...

@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ @WattersWorld Are you really all THAT dumb, that you can't understand that the kneeling protest ISN'T ABOUT THE FUCKING FLAG!!! They are respectfully protesting police brutality, NOT our soldiers!! If they dont have a right to respectfully protest, then what are we fighting for anyway???
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ @WattersWorld That is the stupidist argument I've ever heard! What does repsecting the flag have to do with playing football? I feel like everyone who read this is now dumber for doing so.
@2010harleygirl @Beejay1947 @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse As a result, there are literally MILLIONS of misinformed people out there, just sucking up the propaganda spewed by Fox. Theres a reason dictators use propaganda, IT WORKS! &amp; Sean Hannity is the new Josef Goebbels. https://t.co/vH9qFYyfo5
@2010harleygirl @Beejay1947 @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse I hate Hilary. I wanted Bernie to win. But the election is over. Now its time to cover the dumpster fire we have occupying the white house. Fox is SUPPOSED to be news, yet they ignore any bad press against Trump that they cant find a way to spin.
@2010harleygirl @Beejay1947 @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse I didnt say that. I was talking about how Fox covers each of them. Its like making your top story about a minor fender bender while ignoring a story about a 50 car pileup the set a firworks truck on fire. They purposely ignore major news if it isnt good for Trump.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Your comparison sucks Mueller was wounded &amp; received a purple heart while serving his country in Vietnam. Ay the same time, Trump was getting differments for bone spurs. Mueller spent a lifetime in public service &amp; lead the FBI thru 9/11, while Trump was racking up bankruptcies.

@ChrisMurphyCT I used to say that too. But sometimes I wonder if that really is who we are as a nation. We have done a lot of brutal &amp; horrifying things as a nation since 1776.

@Gunslinger2929 @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Yes but the republicans have a majority in the comittee, so they had the power to steer the investigation any way they want to.

@Kimball1Kelly @Gunslinger2929 @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS Wow. Says the righty that probably gets their news from fox news and infowars. Im done with this conversation. We'll just have to wait &amp; see how it all turns out. Do yourself a favor &amp; googe Trump. You'll find a lot u didnt know I bet https://t.co/M5NBnbuC4N
@Gunslinger2929 @Kimball1Kelly @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS Who in this investigation broke the law?? Thats just pure nonsense. Nobody has broken any laws, they are conducting a lawful invstigation. Its amazing that even you Trump supporters arent claiming hes innocent anymore. He has to discredit the facts because the facts arent good
@Gunslinger2929 @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ ...wrong &amp; I dont understand how it was allowed to happen. But when he did come back, the comittee lost all credibility of being an unbiased oversight committee. For that reason alone, this should be stopped.
@Gunslinger2929 @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Yes, but in this particular case, the head of the intel comittee was a member of Trumps transition team, &amp; he had to recuse himself over that fiasco last year when he was caught helping the white house. How he just decided to come back after a recusal is completely...
@iWideOpen @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Yes, but this isn't discovery. This is a subject of an investigation demanding the entire case of said ongoing investigation. Discovery is only provided after charges are filed, to prepare for a court case. When have you ever seen discovery used before charges??
@Kimball1Kelly @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS Oh &amp; btw, I never skipped a class in my life.
@Kimball1Kelly @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS Yes, but according to our consitution, NOBODY is above the law. He's not supposed to be able to shut down an investigation into himself. How is that what we stand for!?!?! Thats the kinda shit you see in a bananna republic. He is not supposed to interfere in DOJ investigations!
@grammadarla @RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Yep. The debt all of these so called "fiscal conservatives" saddled us with. 83% of the benefits went to the top 1%, &amp; the rest of us &amp; our children are stuck with the bill.
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ How does it feel knowing that you can never again call yourself a "rule of law" congressman, or a friend of law enforcement? This is starting to remind me of Europe in the 1930's. Democracies fell because people didnt stand up &amp; defend them. Your now derelict in your duty as well
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ You guys investigated Hilary for 4 years!! No indictments, no anything. Yet you say that this investigation, which after 1 year has 19 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas, needs to shut down? Do you think we're all stupid? Do you think we dont remember? The double standard is so obvious
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Is rule of law now dead in this country? If we let the president proclaim himself above the law, what does that say about the principle that NOBODY is Above the law? Its a slippery slope after that. Are senators above the law now as well? How about representatives? Governors?
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ What will you say when defendents all over the country start to demand to see all of the case against them, even classified material? In this country, nobody is above the law, so if Trump has that right, why shouldn't everyone?
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ History will judge you all harshly for your behavior. Democracies arent static, they have to be fought for every day. Yet you just ignore your oversight role, instead choosing to defame our best law enforcement agency &amp; throw our justice department into chaos.
@RepMattGaetz @RepLeeZeldin @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ Im glad your still young enough to see how much damage you've done to our constitution when all of the facts come out. How will you explain to your kids that you colluded with a president who tried to destroy our democracy to save himself? Id love to be a fly on the wall for that
@justmia84 Im also in PA. I'm looking to get involved any way I can. Voting isnt enough right now. I honestly believe this election may be our last chance to save our democracy. If the GOP remains in control of both houses, Trump will use that tp say America is with him, &amp; gloves will b off
@realDonaldTrump Whats gonna happen when criminal defendents all over the country start demanding that the DOJ release their entire cases, confidential material &amp; all, to them? Any lawyer worth his salt can agrue "nobody is above the law, but if the president can do this, why cant my client"?
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS I cant wait to see how you cope with your ruined legacy when everything you've done to protectTrump &amp; destroy the rest of us is known. How will you explain to your kids &amp; grandkids why you used your position to undermine our constitution &amp; prop up a dictator?
@lawhawk @SpeakerRyan @FinancialCmte He doesnt care. We cant afford to give him millions of dollars like they can. Deregulation ALWAYS leads to greed, criminal activity, &amp; eventually a collapse. But the people who cause it dont have to pay for it, we the tax payers do. Ryan is an AWFUL human being.
@SpeakerRyan @FinancialCmte ...explain to them that your party &amp; your assault on the poor &amp; sick was more important than protecting our consitution? Democracies arent static, they have to be fought for every day. Yet in the midst of the biggest threat to our nation since the civil war, you did nothing.
@SpeakerRyan @FinancialCmte Your still a young guy, so I'm wondering something. In 30-40 years, when the full scope of what you did to protect a president who is trying to overthrow the consititution to save himself is known, how will you justify what you did to your kids &amp; grandkids? How will you...
@realDonaldTrump ...with treason. We can NOT let this become a legitimate way to act. NOBODY is above the law according to our constitution. A rule which Trump and his loyalists seem determine to overthrow. They should all be ashamed of themselves. History will judge them harshly!!
@realDonaldTrump ...this, but with so many in congress openly colluding with him, they have left our constitutional institutions almost powerless. I fear our only hope is a change in leadership in congress in November. And if we do get through it, I think many congressmen should be charged...
@realDonaldTrump With Trump's escalation of his attack against the justice department, we may be in the midst of the biggest threat to our democracy since the civil war. I'm starting to worry that our system may not hold up to this assault. If. Trump was acting alone, he could not accomplish...

@jeff_martin65 @IvankaTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Your absolutely right. I didn't think about it that way. 		I cant believe congress has given up SOOO MUCH of their power of oversight into this president. Do none of them care at all about our constitution? Or even their own legacy? I dont know whats gonna happen, but im scared.
@dalittledoggy @MForoghiyan @jrbotti @realDonaldTrump You should really google the uranium one deal before you speak about things that you OBVIOUSLY dont understand. We live in the information age, where we have access to the whole of information in our pockets. Theres no excuse for ignorance anymore.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Seriously? Whats the catch? Because this sounds like a great idea, and great ideas dont come from Trump. The guy is dismantling our constitution &amp; rule of law to get out of an investigation. THAT is the Trump I know, selfish, greedy, &amp; narcassistic.
@Zwagvaille @WhiteHouse ...mental healthcare would be a few things to look into. We can't just continue to offer "thoughts &amp; prayers) everytime this happens. When we do that, we are telling our kids that we're not gonna do anything, again, &amp; that is unacceptable.
@Zwagvaille @WhiteHouse I'm no expert &amp; I dont pretend to be. But I would propose that they get as many experts in relevant fields together as possible and start coming up with solutions. Ending gun show loopholes, having mandatory wait periods before you can buy a gun, and having better access to...
@thehill That is TERRIFYING!!
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton What a bunch of crap. Your guy is a criminal, just deal with it.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, how scared sre you?? Your lashing out, repeating yourself over &amp; over, hoping to convince us that the investigation is flawed. Well, its NOT working.
Wow, this is a LOT to infer about someone just because they were speaking spanish. I'm gonna take a nod from him &amp; infer that he's a piece of garbage.		https://t.co/tlWRRUezH7
@realDonaldTrump ...after the evidence gatherers. Your like a bumbling cartoon villian, telling us all your whole plot. But the only people who believe you are the misinformed, and people who are so emotionally invested that they cant bring themselves to see you for what you really are, a con man
@realDonaldTrump Nobody knows what evidence Mueller has on collusion, not even you, but from what we do know, it doesnt look good for you. Mueller isn't trying his case in the court of public opinion. Yet you pretend that there's no evidence. I guess when the evidence is all against you, go...
@MotherJones I signed up. I believe that this is the kind of effort we need right now to combat propaganda and disinformation across this country!
So, according to @AlanDersh this morning, its perfectly legal for any foriegn country to meddle in a US election. 	Im not a lawyer, but that sounds completely RIDICULOUS!!
@WholeLottaRosex I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my dog a couple years ago &amp; I still miss him a lot.
@realDonaldTrump Why do you guys even pretend to care. This happens FAR too often, and I don't know what the solution is. But I know that doing NOTHING, over &amp; over, isn't going to solve anything.
@VP Why do you guys even pretend to care. This happens FAR too often, and I don't know what the solution is. But I know that doing NOTHING, over &amp; over, isn't going to solve anything.
@WhiteHouse Why do you guys even pretend to care. This happens FAR too often, and I don't know what the solution is. But I know that doing NOTHING, over &amp; over, isn't going to solve anything.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, your story keeps getting more &amp; more crazy &amp; unhinged every time you tell it. A far more likely scenario is that one of your staffers saw illegal activities &amp; went to the FBI. You are like a cartoon supervillian, and you give away your plot just like they do.
@realDonaldTrump Lawrence O'donnell commented on your "animals" statement last night &amp; he said it better than I ever could. He was addressing the evangelicals who support Trump more than Trump himself, and his words were impecible.		https://t.co/guD7GIavZW
@realDonaldTrump ...you said it yourself in "the art of the deal". I believe your quote was "You can get people to believe anything, even if its not true. If you say it enough times, people will start to believe it". Like a crazy super villian, you told us your entire plan in a crazy rant!
@realDonaldTrump OMG would you PLEASE shut up about Clinton already!! We know you need an "arch enemy", because you need to deflect your own guilt, but shes not even in politics anymore!! And you sound like an unhinged maniac, just yelling NO COLLUSION constantly. We all know what your doing...
@realDonaldTrump OR, and hear me out here, one of your campaign aids saw massive criminal activity, went to the FBI, and offered to be an informant. No judge in this country would approve of a fucking SPY to be planted in your campaign. You sound like an unhinged lunatic when you say they did!
Check out this video of Bill Gates talking about an encounter with Trump. Friggen hilarious!!		https://t.co/0IuwLJOie2
@GwenAnnBarrett @CNNPolitics I agree 100%. I'll keep calling him out directly in twitter until the day he blocks me.
@GwenAnnBarrett @CNNPolitics Im also one of those people! I hate him but I cant ignore him
@CNNPolitics Also, you have to count people like me, who follow Trump and read all of his tweets, but who also HATE him. I read them &amp; respond to many, just to hopefully inject a little truth into his world of hyperbole and propaganda.
@seanhannity Who the hell cares about Hilary? You'd do anything to not talk about the shit that keeps coming out about Trump huh. Are you running out of panda stories?
@DLoesch Again, Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, is NOT a democrat. https://t.co/QARgsYQyXR
@DLoesch @WhatAimeeWrites Richard Burr is not a democrat https://t.co/FSFcL2Sc1T
@DLoesch What part of the dossier has been proven untrue? Parts of it have proven true as we learn new facts, but none of it has been proven untrue. If im wrong on that, please show me how.
@PSKEP2010 @DimentBarb @realDonaldTrump ..., etc., and they spew lies &amp; propaganda to mold weak minds into voting against their own interests. They're gutting health care, education, and many things that helped make us what we were, all in the name of tax cuts, 83% of which went to the top 1%. The GOP is NOT fo us!!
@PSKEP2010 @DimentBarb @realDonaldTrump ...it also lead to the "decade of greed, culminating with the black monday crash of 1987, savings &amp; loan scandal, recession of 1990, and in combination with other policy, a recession about every 10 years since. The GOP relys on 1 issue voters, guns nuts, abortion nuts, racists...
@PSKEP2010 @DimentBarb @realDonaldTrump You REALLY don't see that it was the neo-cons, starting with Reagan, who gutted our industry??		Reagan gutted unions, and deregulated banks and corporations. This lead to the US going from the biggest creditor nation to the biggest debtor nation, all in his term in office...
@realDonaldTrump From Trump's book, "the art of the deal":		"You can get people to believe anything. It doesn't matter if its true or not, If you say it enough times, people will start to believe it".
Hey @DevinNunes , it sounds like your pretty much alone in your opinion that this investigation is a nothing burger. I hope you end up indicted for conspiracy at the end of all this for the shit you did. You disgraced yourself &amp; the US congress. https://t.co/yliVgCqkmY
@SenateMajLdr @AjitPaiFCC You are such a lying piece of shit!! How is overturning net neutrality helping US?? It helps ISP's to charge us more money, THATS IT! Your lies &amp; propaganda sickens me!
@Aviyaytor @SenSchumer At 5 million members, the NRA doesn't represent the other 315 million of us. They don't even represnt most of the over 90 million gun owners in this country. Besides, the NRA couldn't care less about gun owners, it just uses them. It really represents gun manufacturers.
@Mattytwo2 @RepMarkMeadows Your saying that Russia DIDN'T meddle in our election? Are you high???		Here's the report released just today from the senate investigation. Its bi partisan, released by a republican &amp; a democrat. https://t.co/2CX58EBBnU
@Jim_Jordan @RepDeSantis @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows I hope that all of you end up indicted for conspiracy &amp; obstruction of justice, because what you are doing is so far beyond messed up that its hard to believe, even as I see it with my own eyes!!		This investigation is getting to the truth &amp; that MUST continue!
@realDonaldTrump 83% of that tax cut went to the top 1%. Mitch McConnell tweeted recently that "4 million Americans are seeing benefits from the tax cut". Do you think we're stupid? Thats not even 2% of us. What about the other 316 million of us? 	I live in PA &amp; Bob Casey has my vote!!
@JoeNBC He also had the CIA selling drugs to fund Iran-contra. He invaded Grenada for no real reason at all. I could go on for hours about his messed up presidency. I dont understand how so many people just have some kind of amnesia about him, but history wont.
@Debourke @JoeNBC ...like you realizing the truth about this man before its too late.
@Debourke @JoeNBC He ran an airline, 3 casinos, a hotel, and a football team into the ground, etc., etc. 		Do you really not believe that banks wont loan him money anymore? Damn, you need to get out of that bubble your trapped in and do some reading. The future of our country depends on people...
@Debourke @JoeNBC ...plummeted down to about 69 cents a share. Investors lost everything. The only public comment he made was "I was looking out for Donald Trump. They should've done a better job of vetting their investment". Basiclly saying that they were stupid enough to invest with him.
@Debourke @JoeNBC Did you research the only publicly traded company he was ever involved with? After he took his casinos public at around $65 dollars a share, he paid himself tens of millions in managment fees &amp; used share holder $ to pay for his personal expenses, all while the stock price...
@Debourke @JoeNBC ...peoples misery. Then, by the 2000's when no US bank would dare lend him $, he started going to shady Russian sources. There is dirty Russian money in the Trump towers in pananma, SoHo, Chicago, &amp; many more. PLEASE don't keep diluding yourself about who he really is!
@Debourke @JoeNBC Great businessman? Fabulos president? Are you high?? Please google his business history, all the bankruptcies, refusing to pay contractors, people who invested with him &amp; lost everything, etc. What you'll find is a decimated pile of destruction in his wake. He made $ off of...
@JoeNBC ...his term. His financial deregulation led to the "decade of greed", culminating in the black monday crash, savings &amp; loan scandal, &amp; recession of 1990. He ended his presidency embroiled in the Iran-contra scandal. I think history will judge his presidency much more harshly
@JoeNBC I watch your show every day &amp; I love it. But I think you suffer from historical amnesia when it comes to Reagan. Reagan's legacy is union busting, financial deregualtion, etc., the turned us from the biggest creditor nation to the biggest debtor nation, all during...
@realDonaldTrump Your presonal relationship? Is that a euphamisn for "He's giving my company a $500 million dollar loan"? 	You are SOOOOO corrupt!!!
@RepMattGaetz Mitch McConnell was on twitter recently bragging about the 4 million Americans that saw benefits from the tax cut. Do you think we're all stupid? 4 million isnt even 2% of us. What about the other 316 million of us? Why arent we seeing any benefits??
@RepMarkMeadows All this hype about borders but no concern about Russia meddling in a US election. Is that because they helped a republican? Is it just another form of gerrymandering or voter suppression to you now? Because if they had helped Hilary to win, your hair would LITERALLY be on fire!
@RepMarkMeadows What about when our elections are attacked? The Mueller investigation has produced 19 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas, yet you seem to think it should be shut down? Should we just let Russia continue to mess with our elections too?
@RepMattGaetz That investigation has produced 19 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas so far, &amp; is working to expose how a hostile foriegn power messed with a US election. Should we just forget that and let all these people go? Should we let Russia continue to mess with our elections?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS How many of those nominees hadca rating of unqualified from the bar association? What you guys are doing to our country is dispicable. How long do you think you can control your constituents with lies &amp; distractions? You insult the intelligence of Americans.
@realDonaldTrump So, is it "fake news" being put out by the media, or is your traitoris staff leaking? Because you cant have it both ways, it doesnt make any sense. If your staff is leaking, then its REAL news. If the media is making it up, then your staff isnt leaking!! Fucking moron.
@Fletchlivin @ThisGuyHasToGo @4football2 @FosterCindy3929 @realDonaldTrump That "phony" investigation has produced 19 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas so far, &amp; is probing election manipulation by a hostle foriegn government. Should we just forget about all that &amp; let them keep doing it?
@realDonaldTrump This must be part of Trump's new "Make China great again" policy?
@EdKrassen I hope so!! Nunez is straight up colluding with the administration, and the freedom caucas is in almost as deep as he is. Charging at least a few of them would send a powerful message to congress that THEY arent above the law either.
@treasonstickers I'd say Sanders just because of exposure. Shes out there almost every day lying to us. Rudy is like an atomic bomb, &amp; Sanders is like thousands of conventional bombs dropped over time. They both do a LOT of damage, but in different intensities.
@realDonaldTrump Be Best!!		https://t.co/g8DYEsuUTU
Is this maybe the 1st rollout of the "BE BEST" campaign?		https://t.co/g8DYEsuUTU
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Mitch trying to get back to the ocean after mating https://t.co/F2pL0YGdBG
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Yea, except for that it was republican policies like deregulation that led to the crash of 2008 and that it was the Obama administration that cleaned it up, leading to 8 straight years now of economic improvement. 		Your propaganda only works on the uneducated!
@SenTomCotton What grounds? Her support of torture &amp; participation in the destruction of evidence. Don't pretend that if that happened under a democratic president &amp; was now involving a democratic nominee, that you wouldn't be opposed &amp; outraged, because we all know better.
@John75218893 @seanhannity @SebGorka @dbongino What does Stormy's atty lying have to do with trump? Does him lying somehow mean Trump tells the truth in your warped mind? Enough "whataboutism". Trump is a liar and a scumbag, &amp; Im not moving anywhere. Im just gonna wait for Mueller to put him out of office &amp; in jail.
@ItsMeCathi Paul Ryan has always been a shady, scumbag, piece of crap but this is a new low for him. Apparently he doesn't care at all about his legacy or how history will view him.
@ThePrinceofSha1 @lad_lew @realDonaldTrump What do you take if you have to be awake at 2am to greet released prisoners so you can sing the praises of a brutal tyrant? Cocaine üòâ
@PoliticalEmilia @lad_lew Thats ABSOLUTELY the only reason! At the G20 summit last year, our allies said that whn they discussed policy, Trump's only question was "Was Obama for or against this"? If Obama was for it, he said "I'm against it", without knowing anything else about the policy.
@John75218893 @seanhannity @SebGorka @dbongino No, its from actual "vetted" news sources that have been around and trusted for decades. Long before your little demogod Trump was around. Besides, Trump lies almost 10 times a day on average, even about EASILY provable things. So why do you trust him? Im tired of this sideshow.
@primrose9919 @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump @ATT Yep!! Its called projection and he does it CONSTANTLY
@realDonaldTrump Your taking pay to play politics to a whole new level. But how long do you think you can keep getting away with lying to us constantly??		#BeBest you should give that some thought &amp; be your best self, and by that I mean PLEASE RESIGN!!!
@realDonaldTrump When our allies asked you how things would be better after you left the Iran deal, &amp; how you planned to make sure of that, you had NOTHING!! No answer!! All you could get out was that it was a "campaign promise", but did you ever consider whether is was a WISE promise? Prolly not
@realDonaldTrump Really Donald? With all of the bombshell news coming out, this is your best defense, to juat play dumb?	Well, you can lie to us but you cant lie to Mueller, so good luck with that!!
@John75218893 @seanhannity @SebGorka @dbongino NBC. &amp; confirmed by The Hill, Washington Post, New York Times, &amp; Chicago tribune, so far.
@WholeLottaRosex Me too, &amp; it helps me to understand WTF they're talking about when I argue with them. Its amazing how much some of them just parrot out what they hear without ever bothering to wonder why it sounds batshit crazy.
@WholeLottaRosex I used to watch Fox sometimes, just to see what kind of shit the Trumpers are being fed, but I can't do it much anymore. The level of complete, outright lying, pandering, and propaganda spewing that goes on there is appauling.		#SeanHannityIsTheNewJosefGoebbels
Hey @realDonaldTrump , why haven't we heard any "NO COLLUSION" tweets from you tonight? Seeing as your lawyer had $500K put in his bank account by a Russian oligarch, which SEEMS like collusion, I figured we'd hear from you by now. Just to reassure us that theres "NO COLLUSION".
@seanhannity @SebGorka @dbongino What about the breaking story about $500K being put into Michael Cohen's bank account from a Russian oligarch? Seems like pretty big news to me. But I'm guessing you haven't found a way to try to spin that one yet huh?
@EdFig81 @RepMattGaetz @POTUS If only it were that easy. This deal took years to hammer out &amp; get as many countries to sign as it did. Iran said it will not come back to the table, because they didnt breach the 1st deal, we did. I have a bad feeling that we're gonna regret this.
@EdFig81 @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Iran just released a statement saying they will look into whether they should stay in the deal with Europe &amp; other countries, or resume their nuclear program. If they do resume, that only leaves us 2 choices, 1) let them develope nukes, or 2) go to war to stop them. Not good.
@EdFig81 @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Also, what does that say to North Korea? It may say that we dont stand by our word &amp; our policy. They may believe that we will sign a deal with them, then just rip it up because we changed our mood.
@EdFig81 @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Yes but any move we make now, we do alone, &amp; that takes our power away as well. Any sanctions we level wont be supported by our allies who are still in the deal, &amp; negotiations will be on us alone, again, because everyone else is still in the deal.
@EdFig81 @RepMattGaetz @POTUS I didnt say it was a good idea just because Obama signed it, I said Trump killed it for that reason. He didnt even try to talk to Iran, not once. He ignored our allies and isolated us. We shouldve dealt with the other problems from Iran together, thru other policy.
@KellyannePolls Yea, Sniederman is pretty bad. Almost as bad as THIS guy. The people who work for him should be ashamed of themselves:	https://t.co/29bCykwcmd
@KellyannePolls Wow. You are such a hypocrite, its scary!!	Your boss paid off a porn star, a playboy model, and is being accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women. And he admitted how he treats women on tape!! 	So how can you talk about the transgressions of others with a straight face!?!?
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS All he did was tell the rest of the world that the U.S. could not be counted on to stand by our word. 	Trump's only real motive was to rip up the deal because Obama signed it, not for any other reason. Yet you all come out and try to clean up his mess, AGAIN.
@RepMattGaetz What money? I barely see a damn thing. McConnell said that 4 million Americans are seeing the results. Thats about 1.5% of us. What about the other 316 million of us??? I guess we don't donate enough to your campaigns to matter.
@realDonaldTrump You are such an idiot!! You didnt scrap this deal because you thought it was a good idea, you did it because it was signed by Obama, FULL STOP. Your recklessness with delicate international policy is gonna lead us into a war one of these days. GO FUCK YOURSELF!!
@realDonaldTrump I think the first objective of your wife's "Be Best" initiative to stop bullying, should be to shut down your twitter account.
@TheRickyDavila I dont think Fox should even be allowed to call itself news. All it is, is right wing propaganda. Wrestling cant call itself sports because its outcome is fixed. Fox should have to call itself "news entertainment", and thats being generous.
@FoxNews @SteveScalise There is NOTHING true about this statement. Its pure right wing propaganda. The economy has been steadily improving for the last 8 straight years!!! 	Fox news shouldn't even be allowed to call itself news. If wrestling is sports entertainment, fox news is "news entertainment".
@OtsentaDekada @ianbremmer @MalcolmNance @TIME ...right now. Our constitution states that NOBODY is above the law. If Trump can fire &amp; pardon his way out of an investigation, then he is saying he is above the law. Democracies fall all the time, usually slowly &amp; while the people dont notice. I worry its happening right now.
@OtsentaDekada @ianbremmer @MalcolmNance @TIME I dont advocate for Trump to be impeached w/o due process. I believe he's done plenty to be rightly impeached, but thats for the investigations to say. Until then, I think he should remaine in office. As for our constitution, I LOVE it! But I think its being underminded...
@AprilDRyan @seanspicer @CNN Sean Spicer? He's still alive? I hadn't noticed.		Your a GREAT reporter April!! He's just mad because you still have a job &amp; he doesn't.
@RWPUSA You are a good man Mr. Painter, and one of the last of a dying breed of decent Republicans. I'm not from Minnesota and I am a democrat, but i'll be rooting for you in the upcoming election!
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you stay there and leave the rest of us the hell alone
@realDonaldTrump What sources are you referring to when you say "many people have said", or "everyone knows it"? At least NBC has actual sources. You just make people who agree with you up every day. Over 3,000 lies since taking office. Can we believe ANYTHING you say???
@realDonaldTrump You called it fake news when NBC said that you were looking to shake up your legal team. Now 2 out of 3 of them are gone. Funny how all this news that you call "fake news" ends up being correct.
@OtsentaDekada @ianbremmer @MalcolmNance @TIME ...and right now, we have a wanna be dictator running our own country. If we can't find a way to get Trump out of office soon, we might as well just rip up our own constitution and throw it away, because it wont be worth anything.
@OtsentaDekada @ianbremmer @MalcolmNance @TIME I won't argue with you on that point. The United States doesn't have a very good track record when it comes to dealing with smaller countries. We tend to take what we want, &amp; install puppet dictators that will do our bidding while terrorizing their own people...
@ianbremmer @MalcolmNance @TIME This reminds me too much of what happened in the 1930's. Have we all forgetten in just 80 years what the consequences of the rise of fascism were? It took a toll of a world war and 65 million deaths to right the world again.
@TracieHenk @RepMattGaetz I'm not ALL knowing, nobody is. But I know what the facts are surrounding uranium one. Republicans are trying to make a scandel out of absolutely nothing.
@RepMattGaetz Your grasp of the facts of the "uranium one" deal are obviously flawed, so anything you have to say on the matter is invalid.
@seanhannity Thats a BOLD statement coming from someone who works for Fox news.
@realDonaldTrump Your constant bitching and lying is getting SO old!! I can't wait for the day they bring you out in hand cuffs for your "perp walk". That will be the day your reign of dictatorial terror ends and our constitution and rule of law is properly restored.
@RepMarkMeadows Your just mad because Rosenstein BLASTED you, &amp; because he is absolutely right &amp; you know it!! Its time to stop playing schoolyard games &amp; let this investigation continue so we can all know what happened. Nobody is above the law! There was a time when u knew that, what happened?
@realDonaldTrump Says the U.S. minister of propaganda
@realDonaldTrump Wow, I didn't think it was even possible to lie, brag, and pat yourself on the back so effectively in so few words. 		We ALL know that your lying Donald!
@realDonaldTrump ...we dont need all this waste, exess, &amp; stupidity. 4 bancrupties, thousands of lawsuits for not paying vemders, etc. He left just about everyone who did business with him or invested with him, ruined or at least damaged. 	 Its time to take our power back, We ARE gonna take it!!
@realDonaldTrump The worst part is, that Trump isn't even close to the most dangerous political force in our country. The hate filled, manipulative GOP, who has largely abandoned its ideals, its goals, its dignity, and its self respect...
@realDonaldTrump ...or were Anderson Cooper &amp; Rachel Maddow fighting a cage match to the death, winner  takes the prize of..... Well.... We dont seem to have a prize for the winner. Well THAT is wasted time I'll never get back.
@realDonaldTrump First off, WHAT FRIGGEN POLE!?!?!!? You always ramble on &amp; on, and give no details at all about what your raging about. What is it now? Did N.K. test fire a nuke? Or did fox news just say your name &amp; give you a new "enimies" list? ...
@realDonaldTrump ...we're doomed. U very well be known to history as the LAST US president. Not the kind of legacy I'd wanna leave my kids. Ur entire plan, to move us forward by moving us backwards is the most ridiculous things I ever heard. In fact, everyone reading Trumps tweet, is now dumber.
@realDonaldTrump You stumbled &amp; bumbled with daddys money &amp; bought every toy you could find, until it all crashed in the first of 4 bankruptcies. I don't know how you even survived this long without getting run over by a bus or something. Now you wanna run our country like your business!?!?!?...
@realDonaldTrump You wouldn't know the truth if it smacked you across the face with a lead bat &amp; knocked you back to Trump tower. Your a liar, narcissist, meglomaniac, zenaphobic, racsist, misogynistic, sociopathic, piece of human garbage we as a nation have ever had the misfortune to be stuck w.

@robasebal29 @realDonaldTrump ...argument to be true. At that point, the investigation was hopelessly tainted by Nunez's bumbling and bias.
@robasebal29 @realDonaldTrump Nunez had to recuse himself because of the fallout over that failed stunt. Yet he somehow later unrecused himself, which is technically illegal, so he could again influence the investigation, and again humiliate himself with the "Nunez memo", which turned out to prove the dems...
@robasebal29 @realDonaldTrump What 14 other memo's are you talking about? Nunez humiliated himself 3 times in the last year, starting with his midnight run to the white house &amp; susequent statement to inform the White house and press about information that turned out, came from the white house.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Im so sick of the misinformation on uranium one. We live in the information age, where everyone can access google. There's no excuse for ignorance.	https://t.co/SsGAEd1svn
@realDonaldTrump Lets not forget that the democrats also released a report on the investigation. Your little flunky Devon Nunez couldn't control that one:		https://t.co/qQEL0sy0Uh
@realDonaldTrump ...and people will start to see you for who you really are, a con man who blew through a 9 figure inheritence &amp; turned it into 4 bankruptcies, who destroyed almost everything you touched, &amp; who left business partners, investors, &amp; workers in financial ruins.
@realDonaldTrump One of these days, the "spell" you seem to have cast on your followers in this pseudo cult that your running is gonna break. When that happens, they're gonna google you &amp; find out who &amp; what you really are. This "great businessman" myth will shatter with 5 minutes of research...
@realDonaldTrump You still have the 3 REAL investigations to get through, and you can't tweet, fire, &amp; pardon your way through them. I know you THINK your a king, but in this country, NOBODY is above the law. Its almost time to reap what you've sown Donald.
@realDonaldTrump Now all you have to get through are the REAL investigations in the Senate, the special council, and the U.S. attorney southern district of New York. And those investigations don't have a Devon Nunez running them to make sure things go your way. Are you nervous? I bet you are! Lol
@realDonaldTrump So, who read the report to you? Because I KNOW you didnt read a 250 page report all by yourself like a big boy. I bet Devon came over, gave you your bottle &amp; burped you, then read it to you after tucking you in.
@realDonaldTrump Just some more "truthful hyperbole" Donald? That is the most ridiculous, stupid, nonsensical, ridiculous phrase I've ever heard. For those who don't know what hyperbole is, its lying. So his phrase is Truthful lying. Im sure your cult followers love it tho.
@realDonaldTrump You can say "NO COLLUSION" &amp; "TOTAL WITCH HUNT" until your head explodes, we still won't believe you. You said it yourself in your stupid book, "If you repeat something enough, people will start to believe it". I can't wait to see you in candcuffs!
@realDonaldTrump Of course they didn't find any evidence, they didnt LOOK for any!! Your little flunky Devon Nunez made a mockery of the investigation, multiple times. 		When the REAL investigations are done, I'm hoping they indict Nunez along with the rest of you, as a co-conspirator.

@brent_rauch @DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump Wow. So by that I assume you mean that Russia meddling in our 2016 election hoax? 	All of our intelligence agencies &amp; those of our allies, all said they did. &amp; the investigation into it has so far lead to 19 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas. But I guess thats all made up as well huh?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Why are we even appointing judges this year? This is an election year, therefore we should wait until after the election. You know, to "let the people have their say". This precedent was set by a guy named Mitch McConnell.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You and your GOP cohorts have been hell bent on obstruction for years. You count on guns &amp; god, and a constituency that isnt concerned with facts and buys your propaganda. Your destroying this country, &amp; history will judge you harshly for it.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS On the day Obama was sworn in, you made it your mission to obstruct EVERYTHING he did. Years later, you called your obstruction of him "your proudest achievment" during his presidency.	You Mitch McConnell, are a piece of human garbage!! Stick that in your neck pouch &amp; smoke it.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Democrat obstruction?? Wow, do you really think we can't remember two short years ago? 		MERRICK GARLAND
@Joan1Barb @seanhannity They don't "put" books in it, its a best sellers list. It goes by sale, period. Conservatives are a minority in this country. We only have so many in government because of gerrymandering, voter supperssion, and too many americans not voting.
@seanhannity Are we talking stand-up, sit coms, late night talk show??? They all seem like lucrative work if you can get it, but I wouldn't call them cash grabs.
@JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump Since when do we judge someones mental state by their appearence??? 		If that is the new standard then Trump looks way too orange to be sane.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they're getting tired of having to constantly confirm new people every time you have a temper tantrum &amp; fire someone. You go thru advisors like cookie monster goes thru cookies. What ever happened to "I'll have the best people"? You don't want good ppl, you want sycophants.

@CaptainBString @anna_sorget @DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump Actually thats EXACTLY what socialism is. We pay taxes, &amp; in return we get socialised programs such as police, roads, schools, etc., etc. You should look up the definition of something before you make comments. Just out of curiosity, what did u think socialism was?
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump Red wave? Where'd u hear that from, Breitbart or Alex Jones? U can pretend &amp; play make believe all you want, but the blue wave is coming &amp; no amount of wishing it away or pretending its not true is gonna stop it. But go ahead and enjoy your lil fantasy if it makes u feel better.
@realDonaldTrump You didn't mention that she only won by 5 points in a district you won by 21 points. That's a 16 point swing towards the democrats in the race, even tho the GOP threw a lot of money into the race and the democrats didn't.  So I wouldn't get so cocky if I were you.

@SenateMajLdr He wants to be our top diplomat! So his record on LGBTQ rights, immigrants rights, etc., DOES MATTER!!! I don't care what his qualifications are, he's a biggot, which makes him unqualified.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @StateDept ...and whats gonna happen then? Trump didn't hijack your base, he IS your base. Thats why they abandoned all of you and clung onto Trump. Now the rest of you are desperately trying to stay relevant by pandering to Trump. Its HILAROUS to watch, but it wont end well for you.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @StateDept One of these days, this loosely held together hodge podge of gun nuts, god nuts, &amp; millionaires is gonna realize that there's more than one ossue at stake, then they're gonna realize that you couldn't care less about any of them except for the ones with the deep pockets...
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @StateDept History will remember what you did and judge you harshly for it. Becauaw when it comes down to it, all the GOP cares about is money &amp; power, and they'll pander, as well as sell out their own constituents, to get either.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @StateDept How do you guys sleep at night or even look at yourselves in a mirror?? Conservatives have been on the wrong side of history for every major individual &amp; group rights fight we've ever had in this country. Now your selling your souls for the likes of this narcassist Trump??...
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @StateDept What difference does qualification make? You guys have rubber stamped just about every imbecille with a pulse that he put in front of you. Now we have the not only the most corrupt president in history, but also the most corrupt cabinet! The GOP is destroying the country.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Wow. You do realize that your boy Trump is each &amp; every one of those things on a MUCH higher scale right? If you set up a poll and asked people who the words Liar, leaker, pompous, egotistical, condescending, and law violater best described, I bet Trump would take the #1 spot!
@FoxNews Maybe thats because your leader is a narcassistic, lying criminal and the GOP lead congress REFUSES to act as a check on him. Or maybe its because many of you attack school shooting victims, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, etc. The GOP doesn't represnt us, it represents the top 1%.
@realDonaldTrump All of this crap your tweeting aounds like it cam right out of your book "the art of the deal". What was it you said you'd do to get people to believe a lie? Oh, thats right, you repeat it, over &amp; over &amp; over again. Kind of like "NO COLLUSION". U called it "ruthful hyperbolee".
@realDonaldTrump I thought you were innocent? If so, then why are you so worried about what Cohen could say if he turns on you? You don't act like an innocent man, you act like a maniac who's getting angrier &amp; more paranoid every day. Oh &amp; by the way, when are we gonna get to see your tax return?

@MichaelAvenatti I hope your right. He has a chance coming up to replace the US atty SDNY if he wants to, and McConnell said yesterday that he wont let any ledgislation that protects Mueller/Rosenstein even come to the floor for a vote. Sounds like the GOP may try to end this, its terrifying!!
@SenateMajLdr You are the WORST kind of person. I hope the people of Kentucky finally begin to see you for what you are, a corrupt, rotten, piece of garbage who stands for nothing except for greed and corruption.
@SenateMajLdr Oh, &amp; as for your statement about not letting ledgislation to protect Mueller come to the floor, what's your excuse gonna be when he does fire Mueller? My bet is your just gonna lie down and say nothing, because you dont stand for anything except personal wealth.
@SenateMajLdr You should all be ashamed of yourselves, but I'd bet your not. You sell your support to the highest bidder and shamelessly pander to the most corrupt president in US history. I hope your not worried about a legacy, because future generations will judge you harshly.

@dwade4u @seanhannity Healthcare is one thing I had hope for Trump on. He campainged on healthcare for EVERYONE, &amp; not touching medicare/medicaid. But then he backed the republican bill, which fixed NOTHING, &amp; took healthcare from millions of people. Trump doesnt care about any of us, all he cares...

@dwade4u @seanhannity Our elected officials love to bash other countries healthcare because they want us to believe ours is the best, when in fact it one of the worst in developed countries. Our per person cost is twice what some of the best ranked are, and our access is far less.
@dwade4u @seanhannity Oh c'mon, you REALLY believe that?? These countries aren't ranked among the best healthcare countries in the world because people wait for months to see a dr and cant choose their dr. There are problems in some countries, but many have gotten it right. Check forbes rankings
@dwade4u @seanhannity Did I hear the audio of what? U lost me??
@dwade4u @seanhannity Healthcare companies pay a lot of money to our politicians to keep things favorable to them making lots of money. Healthcare should never be a for-profit busniess, because all for profit busniesses care about is PROFIT.

@dwade4u @seanhannity Leaders of our ally countries at the G20 summit said whenever they discussed a policy, Trump only asked one question, "did Obama support this"? And if the answer was yes, he said "I'm against it". Wtf kind of crazy ass way is that to judge policy??
@dwade4u @seanhannity Some regulations are outdated and should go. But he's not concentrating on that, hes only conventrating on one thing - "did obama pas it". And if so, he destroys it, without any concern for its merrit. Thats not a way to responsibly cut regulations
@dwade4u @seanhannity From predatory bankers. His tax cuts only really help the top 1%. Mitch mcconnell tweeted yesterday that tax cuts are helping 4 million americans, but what about the other 316 million of us? Im not seeing anything in my paycheck. I cant think of anything he's doing that helps us
@dwade4u @seanhannity No. The only agenda he seems to have is destroying obama's legacy. What has he actually done? Deregulate? Because hes not picking good ones to repeal. I agree with the clean air &amp; water act, NOT dumping coal waste in rivers, and Dodd frank &amp; feduciary rule, which protect people..
@dwade4u @seanhannity The two defining emotions of Trump supporters are anger &amp; fear, and he &amp; fox play off of those emotions constantly.
@dwade4u @seanhannity You just decibed what Fox news does every day, on almost every show, for Trump. They use emotions, not facts, to connect with angry people and convince them that EVERYONE ELSE is lying.
@dwade4u @seanhannity I'm a centerist. I dont think this has anything to do with left vs right anymore, its right vs wrong. Im tired of Trump lying constantly while trying to discredit the media. Its dictator 101. The guy has been a con man his whole life. Have u ever read about his past?
@dwade4u @seanhannity Yea, I bet boston globe, USA today, Time, newsweek, etc are all involved in the conspiracy too right? So who should I get my news from instead of from trusted, vetted sources that have been around for decades? Alex Jones, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh?
@dwade4u @seanhannity Oh, do I not have enough twitter followers to impress you? I guess I better hide my head in shame huh? I'm not trying to be funny, I'm just pointing out the ridiculousness of this mess we find ourselves in right now.
@dwade4u @seanhannity I hate Hillary. I only voted for her because Trump is a sociopath. I'd love to see your evidence of all of those illegal votes. Just because yout cult god says it, doesn't make it true.

@dwade4u @seanhannity How many votes can he lose and still find a way to slip thru the electoral college?
@dwade4u @seanhannity Will do! We'll have our say in November, and again on Trump in 2020, if he's not in jail by then. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million in 2016, and I don't think ANYONE who didnt vote for him then is going to in 2020. He's not even trying to gain constituents.
@dwade4u @seanhannity Wow. You get your news from people like Sean Hannity, but I'M uninformed??? Thats hilarious!! Hannity isn't a journalist, he's a propagandist. He's the new Josef Goebbels, and Fox might as well be our version of state tv.

I can't believe he actually said this. He says that 4 million Americans are seeing benefits because of the tax cut. Well, thats not even 2% of us. What about the other 316 million of us Mitch!?!? https://t.co/0IKwaQe7c0

@revolt_caleb @TeelaResists @NBCNews Good point. &amp; they fit right in with Trump, who I think is more of a cult leader than politician himself. He &amp; his supporters don't seem to think he can ever make a mistake or be wrong. Presidents arent infallable, gods are. They seem to have inserted Trump into the god position.
@SenateMajLdr Thats a BOLD statement coming from a guy that said your proudest achievment for the 8 year period of 2009-2017 was obstructing everything Obama tried to do. 	I bet if I touched your skin, it would be slimy.

@LouDobbs How can Fox, a national news station, just lie and spew propaganda as often as you all do???	I don't think fox should be allowed to call itself news. Wrestling isn't allowed to call itself a sport, its sports entertainment. Fox is news entertainment, NOT news.
Sign up and be ready to hit the streets when Trump declares himself dictator.		Join an event to say Trump Is Not Above the Law! https://t.co/jRI4hAspjY
@nycjim LOVE the pee brain one!! 	Im worried that today might be the day he fires Mueller and/or Rosenstein. He likes to do things on Fridays. He's got Fox churning out the propaganda at full tilt. Could today be the end of rule of law in the U.S.?
@maggieNYT This was definitely written by someone else. The vocabulary is all wrong, its written in complete sentences, etc.
@realDonaldTrump YOU leaked classified information to the Russians in your office!!! Comey might have gone too far with this book, but he's definitely more credible than you are! You may be the LEAST credible person on earth. Nobody has more confirmed lies told than you do Mr Trump.
@BillKristol Trump has his minions at Fox news churning out propaganda at full tilt. It looks like they're preparing for something. My question is, if he does this, at what point do we just pronounce him dictator? How many times does he have to put himself above the law before its official?
@kelli_kay1916 @BillKristol Happy birthday!! I hope Trump doesn't destroy our constitution and rule of law on your birthday.
@Trish_M_M @BillKristol I agree. If he is going to do it, its a good bet he'll do it on a Friday evening. Fox news is in crisis mode trying to convince everyone that firing them all is good for our country. Im worried about our country.
@BillKristol I think today might be the day he moves on Mueller &amp; Rosenstein. He like to do things on Friday evenings, hoping it cools down over the weekend. 	I keep hoping congress would act if he did, but I'm not counting on it. Ive never been so afraid for the future of our country.
@Jim_Jordan Its good policy for millionaires and corporations, your donor class. It doesn't do a damn thing for the rest of us. Your loosely held constituency of single issue voters are all abandoning you for Trump. The GOP is fucked, your days running govt are numbered.
@seanhannity Wow, this is a big story! Way to have your finger on the pulse Sean. 	How long do you think you can keep this misdirection up? Maddow is killing you in ratings because she actually covers relevent, breaking news.
@realDonaldTrump Where is your "thank you"!?!?! Wow, you really are the most self centered, narcassistic, megalomaniac son of a bitch ever elected. How about this, you want a thank you? RESIGN!! Step down and i'll thank you every day for the rest of your would be term!
@RWPUSA I agree, and I believe siding with Trump is no less consequential than siding against rule of law and our constitution. If Trump wins, our democracy will lose and Trump will end up a defacto dictator. It can't end any other way.
@HassanGarat1 @krassenstein I agree, but Smith may be even worse than Goebbels. At least Geobbels had the title "minister of propaganda". Smith is doing it under the guise of free, unbiased journalism, which is even more dangerous.
@krassenstein We all need to get together and boycott Sinclair's advertisers. That would send a message that they couldn't ignore.
@krassenstein Wow. They might as well just call themselves state tv. This goes against EVERYTHING a free and adversarial press is supposed to stand for. We need journalists to report the news without fear or favor, NOT deliver the president's message.
@realDonaldTrump Yea, except that Rosenstein is a republican appointed by YOU, Mueller is a republican, and the US attorney southern district of NY is a republican appointed by you, who gave you a $5,400 campaign donation.
@realDonaldTrump Yea Putin, you can't bully our bombs, because they are good enough, smart enough, and gosh darnit, people like them.		What kind of romper room shit is this, lol!!

@waltshaub I agree 100%! How many times are we gonna let him stomp on the constitution? He's basically saying "the law doesn't matter, only I matter", and congress is refusing to go against him. So how many times does he do that before we just declare him a dictator? #Resist

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Of all of his recent tweets, THIS is the one you decide to report on? Here's a little breaking news for you:		Trump's personal lawyer's home &amp; office raided by the FBI, for an investigation into wire fraud, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations.
@JudicialWatch Wow, you guys are trying REALLY REALLY hard to change the story today huh. Hillary Clinton isn't in public office. The personal lawyer for the president of the united states had his office raided by the FBI. THAT is the story today.

@realDonaldTrump Would you quit whining about Obama and actually DO SOMETHING!! You're so santamonious it sickens me. Bitching about Obama doesn't solve anything, no matter how many times you repeat it. At least he could admit when he was wrong about something.

@JadedIndVoter @jmoseberth @gavacho1223 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Its still a free country. Trump hasn't "officially" declared himself lifetime emporer of the U.S. yet, so nobody HAS TO accept him as our president. He does NOT speak for all of us.

@realDonaldTrump You nominated your Dr to head the VA, your personal pilot to head the FAA, and your personal driver to run white house internet comms. Whats next, your massage therapist to head the EPA? Or ur favorite hooker to head national sex education?

@Comey I've never been afraid for the FBI, all our government institutions, and for the constitution itself before, but I'm terrified for them now. Our checks &amp; balances don't work when one party controls everything &amp; they're all complicit in the destruction of our democracy.
@chrislhayes Fascist, Nazi, etc. Hitlers Gestapo would've agreed with it.
@realDonaldTrump What does the dossier have to do with Carter Page being under surveillance since 2013? What it have to do with Paupodapolus drunkenly saying too much in a London bar, which lead to the investigation? All this memo stuff is garbage, meant to confuse ppl who arent paying attention.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for everything you've done to help our economy President Obama!
@realDonaldTrump Why would they call you about it? You've burned them every time they've tried to work with you in good faith. They would be better served working with republicans on congress and just sending you a bill when they're done. They could put ANYTHING in it, because you won't read it.
@realDonaldTrump You can't possibly believe that your gonna have MORE republicans after the mid term election! Your only hope is that the dems don't take control of BOTH houses of congress, and even that is a long shot.	#BlueTsunami2018
@Merxheim @realDonaldTrump I spoke out against him thru the entire election, but when he won, I tried really hard to swallow it &amp; give him a chance. But his ego &amp; ignorance is destroying our country. He's chipping away at our constitution every day &amp; we can't just sit back &amp; let him do it.
@realDonaldTrump Do you even realize that most drugs and people come through our ports, NOT over the border?? How can you have access to the entirety of our intelligence and still be so stupid? You should really try to learn before you speak!
@SpeakerRyan Neither are sick children or DACA kids @SpeakerRyan !
@realDonaldTrump You suck moldy ball cheese on a plate!
@realDonaldTrump Everyone knows that this is your fault, because you flipflop &amp; can't figure out what your position on ANYTHING is! You are an angry, sad, dumb, confused old man. For the love of this country, PLEASE PLEASE resign!!
@realDonaldTrump You are destroying this country!
@realDonaldTrump Your the one who can't figure out what he wants and keeps moving the goal posts. You &amp; the GOP are the ones running the entire government. You are the one who killed DACA &amp; let CHIP expire, starting all of this. So you can try to blame dems, but we all know that's bulls@#t!
@realDonaldTrump He's gonna lose, &amp; its gonna be YOUR fault!
@realDonaldTrump Stop using children as a poker chip, how about that!?!? This could be life or death for sick children you monster!
@Buckeyesrule17 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump What government money is going to support illegals?? The DACA kids pay taxes &amp; contribute, they don't cost us money. They were brought here as kids, &amp; this is the only home they know. They &amp; CHIP should NOT be being used by Trump as poker chips!
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump Senator Jeff Flake spoke about this on the senate floor this morning. 		https://t.co/zu1EySuYCj

Or about the former head, who stole 8 billion from it, millions of which ended up in your pocket through trump Soho, &amp; that fake trump tower scam in Georgia which you made a million bucks for? You are so corrupt!!
@realDonaldTrump You don't seem to understand at all how the diversity lottery works. So instead of educating yourself on it, you just denounce it because you think its a good sound bite for your base?? That's pretty messed up.
@realDonaldTrump You said the democrats are holding DACA hostage, but that's not true. YOU killed it, so YOU own it. You can't walk into a bank, take hostages, then say its actually the police who are holding them hostage because they won't give you what you want. Don't make these kids suffer.
@SenFeinstein You are a true American patriot Senator Feinstein. Thank you for doing the right thing and letting the people see the info they need to have an informed opinion instead of relying on the cherry picked leaks that bolstered the GOP conspiracy theory.
@realDonaldTrump There's nothing illegal about releasing unclassified testimony. Let's get everything out there so the people can see what's going on. If you truly have nothing to hide, then that should be a good thing.
@realDonaldTrump Why are you so afraid of transparency if you have nothing to hide @realDonaldTrump ?
@realDonaldTrump Your afraid of what that testimony does to your flunkies' conspiracy theory about the FBI colluding with democrats to ruin you huh? No worries, you don't need their help. Your ruining yourself every time you open your mouth.
@realDonaldTrump Oh and trying to convince us that your mentally stable by constantly telling us how stable your are doesn't work either. It just makes you seem desperate.
@realDonaldTrump Yea, people who are ACTUALLY smart don't go around telling everyone how smart they are. Einstein, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc., didn't tell everyone how smart they were. Dumb Insecure narcissists go around trying to convince everyone they're smart. If your actually smart, we know
@realDonaldTrump Do we all have to die just because you have a small penis Mr Trump?		https://t.co/FZnxSZ5KY2
@realDonaldTrump Wow, this is so realistic I thought it was a photo at first, lmao!!! I guess we now know who the "400 pound guy in a bed" is! https://t.co/t8qnY7H6cS
@krassenstein If the GOP manages to hold onto control of both chambers of congress, we are gonna be in some serious shit. I have NEVER been so crushed &amp; afraid as I've been since Trump took office. I'm ashamed to be an American! I LOVE my country, I just don't recognize it anymore.
@krassenstein Wow. We all know that trump is a maniac. But the support he's getting from some GOP congressmen, who are willing to trash the reputations of the FBI &amp; many good public servants just to prop him up &amp; protect him, is both shocking &amp; terrifying! So much for checks &amp; balances.
@PressSec @POTUS Trump a lot himself when his generation was asked to fight. Those school differments, that bone spur, &amp; what was he telling Howard stern that time? Oh yea, that having so much sex and avoiding VD was "his" Vietnam. It must've been rough out there.

@DeanHeller @POTUS Enjoy your last year in office Mr Heller, because when this bill fails to help the economy like trickledown always fails, we WILL remember on election day.
@SpeakerRyan You are all terrible people. I hope you realize that.
@DeanHeller No matter how u feel about the ACA, the fact is it led to tens of millions of people who didn't have healthcare now having it. Every GOP bill took it away from millions. We will never solve our hc problems with a for profit system, but at least it moved in the right direction.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I can't wait to see you LOSE!! The more involved you get in the 2018 elections, the harder its gonna be to distance yourself from the losses. It won't stop you from trying, as ridiculous as it will surely sound. 2018 will be the year you reap what you've sewn, &amp; I can't wait!
@GOP What, no "happy holidays" MAGA hat? Since when does the president sell merchandise to people??
@PressSec @POTUS So ISIS doesn't exist anymore? I bet that's news to ISIS and to all of the people who are currently still living under their oppression.
@SpeakerRyan If being energy independent is so important, then why have you refused to support green &amp; renewable energies? The rest of the world is leaving us behind. If republicans remain in charge of this country, we're gonna fall down into to a third world nation eventually.
@FoxNews @DrDarrinPorcher Its not about rooting for a plane crash. Its about watching as the plane goes down in flames and objecting to it.
@realDonaldTrump Trickledown economics does NOT create jobs. Employers hire &amp; expand because of increased demand, NOT because they have more capital. You'd think a guy with an economics degree from Wharton would know that! I'm starting to wonder how much that degree cost your father Fred Trump.
@FoxNews @Hallmark SERIOUSLY!?!? I hope when Disney buys you that they fire you all and make some SERIOUS changes yo your programming, because this right wing, white anger, propaganda angle is going off the rails.
@DonaldJTrumpJr All your father is doing is making it easier for bankers &amp; businesses to take advantage of the rest of us. Most regulations PROTECT us from people like you &amp; your father. When Reagan slashed regs in the 80's it led to the decade of greed. Then the crash of 87, 91, etc.
@realDonaldTrump Are you "sick of winning" yet? Lmao!
@GOP Did you hire Joseph Goebbels to run the website? Because unless its full of lies and propaganda, its not going to help your cause. Why don't you just stop the spin and call this tax plan what it is, a corporate &amp; rich peoples bill. Because THEY write the contribution checks.
How can u "crack down on ISPs that would abuse open access, when u just REPEALED the regulation that CRACKS DOWN ON IPSs THAT WOULD ABUSE OPEN ACCESS!?!?!? I'm so sick of republican lies. Just be honest, u did it because the ppl who write the checks for your campaign wanted it. https://t.co/6LsQYkbiIN
@SpeakerRyan @AjitPaiFCC @FCC Oh c'mon!!! This is a win for ISP's, NOT consumers. Just like your tax bill is a win for the rich &amp; corporations, NOT the middle class. Can you guys please just call these things what they are? I'm tired of all this spin, trying to confuse people.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You sound more &amp; more like a dictator of a banana republic every day. You think that only news favorable to you is true and the rest is fake? That's not news, it's propaganda. You might as well just hire a Joseph Goebbles and stop pretending you care about our laws.
@AHamiltonSpirit @JudgeJeanine Not one piece of evidence?!!! There are FOUR indictments!! Two of which plead guilty!! And you should check your own master Trump if your concerned about lying, he does that every time he speaks! Check the polls, the country is NOT with u on this
@thehill I can't believe it took this long to realize that.
@FoxNews @seanhannity How many people do you think are with you as you try to stain the reputation of a war vet and lifelong public servant with an impeccable record. Republicans openly criticized Hilary while investigating her multiple times. Where were you on that? You should b ashamed of yourself
@FoxNews @seanhannity Most of us have political opinions. That doesn't mean we can't act objectively and do our jobs. This investigation has produced 4 indictments and two guilty pleas, and you want to just shut it down? While opening ANOTHER one on Hilary, where 11 so far have produced no indictments
@FoxNews @seanhannity What evidence do you have that this investigation is corrupt? One guy sent some texts and he was fired. THATS IT! That's all you have! By your rational, all of the republicans who said horrible things about Hilary Clinton while investigating her had no right to do that either!

@SpeakerRyan @RepKristiNoem Trickle down economics has been shown to be a failure in the past, almost costing Reagan an election in 1984. So why will it work this time?
@SpeakerRyan @RepKristiNoem I am from PA, make $38,000 per year, rent my apartment, and have no student loan debt. Will I see a net increase right away, and if not then how long will it be until I see it?
@Real_Assange_ @realDonaldTrump Wow, so I guess you've given up ANY hint of pretending to be nonpartisan. If wikiLeaks is just another arm of the conservative movement, then how can we trust anything you put out?
@_zakali @icepk 100% AGREED!! I made a similar comment earlier.
@ezraklein I agree 100%, but it was Alabama, where only a couple democrats have won state wide election in decades, since the days of the Dixiecrats. Its a baby step, but its at least a step in the right direction.
@seanhannity That's NOT owning it Sean! You may have been for Brooks in the primary, but you hitched your wagon to that pedophile for a long time now. OWN ALL OF IT Sean!! Tell your children and all of the children you meet that your sorry you backed a monster!

@StephenAtHome Wow, your whole family are a bunch of narcissistic, megalomaniac, creepy, racist, sexist, and just generally messed up individuals, huh? If your two year old is asking his teacher that, child protective services should be stepping in.
@DeanHeller That's not what it does at all! The biggest cuts go to the rich and corporations, while the poorest will end up the worst hit when its all said &amp; done. New jobs, increased wages, &amp; growing economy? All just hopeful goals. Goals that never happened last time this method was used.
@klpsnow @realDonaldTrump That sounds like a GREAT idea!!! I'd travel anywhere in the country to be there and personally witness him stumble, lie, backtrack, and muddle his way through trying to explain something that I'm sure he doesn't really understand.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, we understand it a lot better than you do if you think you won't personally see a massive tax cut. 	All this is is a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the richest people. Its for all of your donors, not us. So stop lying to us!!

@snoqualmieCarl @DeanHeller I guess he's not. Its funny how recently trickle down was considered a bad thing to even say. Republicans NEVER brought it up. Now suddenly its the future? They didn't even change the old packaging before trying to sell it to us again.
@DeanHeller Trickle down has been tried at least three times in the last 35 years. It doesn't work. But don't take my word for it, watch Gary Cohn of the Trump administration try to sell it to CEO's:	https://t.co/kt94KHQyle
@DeanHeller How about reform that helps the 99% instead of the 1%. We could all get behind that! 	BTW, this movie was also top grossing when Reagan previously proposed trickle down economics and it didn't work then. What makes you think doing the same thing will work now?

@realDonaldTrump Try lowering taxes for lower income people as well instead of making them pay for your tax cut to the rich and dems may help you out!
@SpeakerRyan Just be honest. You need to cut taxes to the political doner class and you need the middle class to pay for it.
If Roy Moore wins this election, what would that say about the voters of Alabama? Since when is it OK to be a child molester??
@Team_Trump45 @realDonaldTrump Yep! And he stole Reagan's "worst president in history" title as well!
@realDonaldTrump So, your REALLY not gonna say anything about that pedophile Roy Moore???? What's wrong, are you afraid it hits too close to your own sexual harassment and assault history?
@thehill That would be GREAT, but how??
@realDonaldTrump Whatever u gotta tell urself to help u sleep at night. Look up the therapy term "projection". It might explain a lot. Then, PLEASE GET HELP!
@realDonaldTrump Hey Donald, ever hear the story of the pot &amp; kettle? Nobody cares what u say anymore. Its all bullshit! Your spin is weak!
@seanhannity Uranium deal was done by 9 department heads! 8 of which have NOTHING to do w Clinton. Is that the best u got? Your spin is weak Hannity!
@realDonaldTrump Or why isn't mueller focusing on the JFK assassination? Or JoanBenet? If we're just randomly trying to change the subject, makes same sense
@seanhannity Funny with ppl in trump admin using private email that this would be pushed
@MAGAPILL @SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump Wow, what a bunch of crap! Trump doesn't even know why he said it. He's an idiot, hadn't u noticed that? This will fade like all his shit
@SenBobCorker Well said Bob. Its about time someone in the GOP put their country above their party!! Now, KEEP speaking out and take action!
@VP @Colts @LucasOilStadium @SecondLady Couldn't even take a new picture for your little protest? This one is from 2014. What a waste of taxpayers money.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecondLady You seriously don't have anything better to do besides waste tax dollars on a stunt? Jackass!
@FredWalkerJr1 @HouseDemocrats Just because u paid 4 ur parents mistakes doesn't mean that EVERYONE else needs to. Being sent to a country they don't even remember is hars
@FredWalkerJr1 @HouseDemocrats I would say good, now go live your life &amp; do u. No reason to hold that against anyone else out of spite. These ppl were children, not adults
@FredWalkerJr1 @HouseDemocrats A few hundred of em are serving in the military. Do we let them finish &amp; kick em out, or just kick em out now?
@FredWalkerJr1 @HouseDemocrats Its not rewarding them, its not making them suffer for a choice they had no part in making. This is the only home, only life they know.
@FredWalkerJr1 @HouseDemocrats Many of these kids were brought here so young that they don't know any other home. How would u like 2 b sent 2 a country u don't remember
@rickprice407 @StevieBobbitt @HouseDemocrats You know that most of them contribute 2 society right? A couple hundred r serving in the military. Should they have to leave as well?

@FoxNews @POTUS I can't believe that its ONLY 56%
@AHamiltonSpirit @realDonaldTrump After all of the righteous hot air by GOP over Clinton's email, they are VERY quiet now. Party before country??
@realDonaldTrump Why? Ego, racism, millions losing possibly healthcare, trickle down economics (which has been tried and doesn't work), etc., etc.
@roberttraynham I watched your seg on MSNBC today, where u ask "what do ppl see in trump"? If u get an answer let me know. I ask myself that every day.

@SpeakerRyan Say his name Mr Ryan! Damn, I bet that spine removal operation hurt a little.
@Jesspiper7 @FoxNews @jessebwatters I just made a similar comment before I saw yours. All of the conservative "Dixiecrats" ran to the other side after civil rights act passed
@FoxNews @jessebwatters Conservative democrats, or "Dixiecrats" were the party of slavery. They all changed to republicans after the civil rights act of 1964 passed
@Newsweek Steve Bannon is living proof that whites are NOT the "master race". Just look at the guy! What a pile of angry human garbage.

@AnnCoulter You voted for him. That makes you part of the problem. Oh &amp; BTW, YOU SUCK, skeletor barbie.

@S_hantu @williamlegate @WarRaven2016 @StubbsRich @FoxNews "Blood &amp; soil" was a slogan used by Nazi's in the 1930's. &amp; they chanted "Jew will not replace us". Sounds pretty racist to me
@seanhannity @CNN Damn Hannity, always the good lil soldier. Do you have your own views, or do you just agree with Trump and parrot alt-right talking points?
@hi_hat_truth @ManMountain78R3 @realDonaldTrump Yea, every time I hear a conservative say they're the party of Lincoln or that dems were the KKK, I wanna snap &amp; give them a history lesson.
@realDonaldTrump Yea, except he never did that!! Its been debunked over and over!

@notianrapoport @realDonaldTrump Trying to grow their base, but its been getting more &amp; more out of control, and GOP finally lost control when they elected trump.
@notianrapoport @realDonaldTrump And racist zealots together ever since they became an all conservative party after the civil rights act was passed in 1964. They were...
@notianrapoport @realDonaldTrump I agree @notianrapoport the GOP has been hobbling this loosely held base of christian zealots, gun nuts, abortion nuts, anti immigrant nuts,
@notianrapoport @realDonaldTrump Anyone now either, which sucks. We really need someone to stand up and lead right now
@notianrapoport @realDonaldTrump I agree. They have a few who will stand up and make statements for a couple days, but nobody to really stand up. But the dems don't have...
@speedingisfun @ManMountain78R3 @hidehunt1 @realDonaldTrump Democrats endorsed labor unions, which finally gave workers rights and helped create the middle class. GOP are union busters.
@ManMountain78R3 @realDonaldTrump You do realize that those dems were conservatives right? Both parties used to have a liberal and a conservative wing. They would be GOP now
@realDonaldTrump Is so scary and lousy, but that's no excuse. Time to stop living in the past Mr Trump.
@realDonaldTrump OMG, the election was over 9 MONTHS AGO!!!!! Would u PLEASE get over it already!! I guess living in the past is a comfort when ur present...
@realDonaldTrump How does it feel to have the mayor of Phoenix say that he doesn't want you there? That's gotta sting a little ;-)
@realDonaldTrump Trump vs the GOP, We'll see who wins this one. If the GOP would stand together against Trump, he wouldn't stand a chance. C'mon GOP, fight!
@realDonaldTrump Statues, they learn it from books, museums, etc. And to equate guys who committed treason against us to the men who founded our nation? Wow
@realDonaldTrump So we're getting a history lesson from the guy who thought pres Jackson was mad about the civil war? People don't learn about history from..

@realDonaldTrump Try being genuine and not grumbling like your only doing it because you were forced to by the media. That was a sad display of a speech
@realDonaldTrump How long do you think you can keep this up? You obviously have no idea what your doing
@realDonaldTrump It seems to me that your losing support more rapidly than ever Mr Trump. Investigations, GOP speaking out against you, dropping poll numbers
This can't be legal. What happened to our first amendment? https://t.co/ju77K4d6et
