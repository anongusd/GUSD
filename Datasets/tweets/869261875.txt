@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow True. But as trade grows and our billionaires become greedy for more wealth, they take their business global looking for cheap labor overseas while holding our senators and congressmen hostage with campaign finance, to craft policies to help them go global. See how global we are.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Please do not say that they mean harm to USA. Are you saying Scalia hates the second amendment and USA when he agreed that AR15 was not what the framers intended to allow for WELL REGULATED MILITIA to carry? Uh? descent does not mean harm. You disagree sometimes, do you not?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow More power to you then, if you are a Native American like the CHEROKEE, NAVAJO etc. My hat tilts in respect to you.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow I respect your view. Just remember that we live and breath globally. We depend on the globe to move forward. Our alliances tell a big story. Maybe TRUMP should close all our borders, pull out of all treaties and pull out of all trade deals with rest of world and let us see result
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Mike, you know that only the Native Indians can ask the rest of us where we are from? We all did not come here together, nor from same origin &amp; we know that history well. We live with each other under same constitution regardless of our differences. That is what makes USA unique.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Mike can you tell members of senate and congress who vote against provisions of the constitution invoked by the other side, or President in power to live USA? Is that what you believe the constitution dictates-that if you disagree you are not American?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Mike, during the adoption of this very constitution, did some of the delegates vote no? Every policy including the very constitution never get 100% vote (except in communist world), that is what makes American democracy unique-you can decent and still be an AMERICAN. DEMOCRACY
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow From time to time the constitution is challenged in court and challengers are proven correct. yes? Republicans and Dems have successfully challenge in our courts Presidents who advance policies based on Constitution. Yes? What does that tell you? Rigid or Flexible? Revision?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Why then are we so divided on so many issues. Are senate rules not sort of constitution that stood test of times for decades. Yet from time to time has those rules not been overhauled just to push &amp; confirm nominations and thus policies. Abortion is one such issue
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow MIKE, please think about it. Why is it that TRUMP, OBAMA, REGAN and JFK had to make deal with other nations. NATO -security is global alliance. Trade-economy is global. Education is global. us POPULATION is global-Europeans, Africans, Native Indians, Asians, and now RUSSIANS.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Mike the constitution needs overhaul. remember, ways of life have changed since it was adopted in 1776.

@AnnCoulter remember LOCK HER UP, by FLYNN? look who is heading to jail. Remember what TRUMP said about Hilary, " be tied up in court if elected". Wow, look who is tied up in court. @seanhannity  is one step closer to being indicted. Not a sermon, just a thought.
IS NORTH KOREA HOME FOR NEXT TRUMP TOWERS, TRUMP GULF COURSES, TRUMP HOTELS, and TRUMP LAND?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow An American
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Hope you call all SICK if they plan and execute using any weapon, so we can send them to mental institutions on our dime. Sheriff confirmed that the 17 year school shooter in MD shot himself in head not the resource officer as you had cited. just for record. Thank God no AR15 use
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Use guns"A WELL REGULATED MILITIA"is in clause. Militia operate under authority only to resist tyranny as was 1700's. Disciplined, responsible, not killing students, concert goers. Show me  tyranny in USA. Tell me where to draw line on what weapon one can hold. Why have police?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow True. People who want to do mischief will go all out to do it including planning and execution. Sane people plan &amp; execute Ref. Timothy McVeigh. When we have epidemic in USA, we put measures in place to regulate/halt? FBI, CDC, ATF, etc activated to halt. Guns deserve same action
@AnnCoulter When did voting become a prerequisite for repeat screwing? Did you vote for him? Is he screwing all the women who voted for him?
@BillOReilly Incaseyou missed it, that was part of the conversation yeaterday. GUNS are the issue here. Remove them from the equation and Chicago violence is no news. All gun violence victims in USA were front and center at rally and in overall discussions. Are you watching 60mins today?
THANK YOU EMMA and team. You all ROCK and we love you. We will be behind you as you set the stage for your future as adults making and enforcing legislation. https://t.co/mqT04fKv7n

TRUMP to announce RUSSIAN diplomat expulsions for the poisoning of former Russian double agent in UK moments before the airing of the Stromy Daniels interview on CBS this evening to divert attention from the spicy juicy story. Stay with CBS and read TRUMPS tweets later.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow I am an American. Are you the GREATEST swimmer that we have ever recorded? Just curious. 	Remember Senator Pombo from Califonia? 	Thanks for asking and for engaging, that is how we can make America safer then make it Greater. Discussions can make a difference.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Mike, reports note he had not committed any crime to warrant action. Law. If FBI had taken his guns prior to crime, NRA and FOX would have screamed "the gov is coming to take your guns away"laws protect innocence. Sick people act spontaneously. He planned actions. Not sick.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Jury is out. Not confirmed who shot the shooter. For a minute, just think if he had used an AR15 as was Parkland! What would have been the casualty count? Just be honest with yourself. 2nd A calls for regulated Militia and Scalia agrees AR15 should not be in civilian hands. Stop
@seanhannity CALLED POLITIKINBG-just as Republicans do all the time. Remember, Obama regulated Pork addition to budget but TRUMP overturned the regulation. So why act surprised? TRUMP spends other peoples money &amp; when they come to collect, he declares BANKRUPTCY 8X &amp; counting. Will USA be #9
@AnnCoulter BOLTON, DiGENOVAS and rest of FOX CABLE conspiracy cabal will sanction  NORTH KOREA and IRAN to pay for wall. 	Or should I say add @seanhannity , @AnnCoulter , @TuckerCarlson , @marklevinshow, @IngrahamAngle to list above and you have your wall against MULLER, STROMY &amp; MCDOUGAL
@AnnCoulter Oh! watch!,just getting started. 8 Bankruptcies, multiple marriages, &amp; highest staff turnover recipe for bankruptcy #9 Company USA. When the MULLER, STROMY &amp; MCDOUGAL bullets start piercing the fort, TRUMP will use anything including bills to change story, deflect your attention.
Thank you Erick for standing up against the Republican destructive machine. https://t.co/bShImy9G47
@MittRomney @AnnRomney BEAUTIFUL and PLEASING before GOD.
@marklevinshow Are you enlisting to defend the forth? Because the MULLER, STROMY and MCDOUGAL armies with bullets that pierce lies, obstruction of J, slandering, name calling, payoff, tweets, bankruptcies, etc are starting to fly on Sunday-CBS. Remember, Trump boys not enlisting like their dad.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,Credit OBAMA. Talk about the growing economy, soaring stock market, low unemployment, lower crime rate and other good stuff Obama handed you? Obama inherited a rundown economy, stock M in red, crime high-yet he worked hard, restored &amp; improved all. Obama economy.
TRUMP! bring @seanhannity as Chief of Staff,  @AnnCoulter as press secretary, &amp; rest of Fox talk show hosts to beef up white house conspiracy, lies telling and name calling army to hold the white house fort against the MULLER, STROMY, &amp; MCDOUGAL BULLETS. The STORM is gathering
@KatiePhipps6 @AnnCoulter If you are correct about the women, why buy their silence? Why  fight to keep Stromy from telling her story? If innocent act like one. Did OBAMA try to stop the Benghazi probe, or call it witch hunt? Did Obama taunt any FBI agent like Trump did Mcabe? Who ended Benghazi probe?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Laws help to keep us safe. Police enforce the laws we make. President Trump want death penalty for drug dealers. If it becomes law police will enforce. Drugs kill the users not innocent people. But Gun owners are using their guns to kill innocent people. why not regulate guns.
@KatiePhipps6 @AnnCoulter Do you condone lies? do you believe women who accuse men of sexual crimes should tell their stories? did Clinton attempt to shutdown Kennet Star probe? Did Clinton or Obama ask FBI directors for loyalty? Did Obama call Bengazy probe witch hunt or did the probe run its course?
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow True. Why then do we have police and government and laws in our community? Do you mind to answer.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Sick people do not plan and execute with precision as he did. Any one who plans and executes murders like his, Forth hood, Las Vegas, New York Bike trail, and current bombings in Austin Texas are all terrorists.President called some sick and others terrorists.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow we know he bought it. so please talk about that.
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow Let us talk about what he used and how he used it. Leave hypothetical out. AR15 was the weapon he chose to use, that is what we should zero on. Some have used vehicles as weapon we can discuss them in that context. If we fail to be honest we are causing more harm to the children
@KatiePhipps6 @AnnCoulter One way you to destroy a nation and its people is to kill its economy. No money no military, no FBI, no schools. Did OBAMA destroy or restore Economy? Obama never attacked FBI and CIA. He did not interfere with their operations. Can you say that about Trump? Be honest

@KatiePhipps6 @AnnCoulter Presidents do not have to lie, apease RUSSIA undermine our NSec. President OBAMA inherited a busted economy, NO GDP, 18-25% unemployment. He worked hard with dignity- no lies, restored economy, &amp; handed TRUMP a growing economy with unemployment below 5%, GDP 2.75%. Character
@mikephelps01 @marklevinshow What about the notion that if he was not able to lay hands on a GUN, especially AR15, wouldn't these precocious 17 be alive.

Evangelist be aware. When Trump succeeds to weaken USA he will be empowering RUSSIA the BEAR as in DANIEL 7:5, who is busy propping SYRIA &amp; building IRAN. A weak USA will melt when the beast devours Saudi Arabia then turn to annihilate Israel. No man but God can reclaim Jerusalem

@thehill TRUMPS do not understand sacrifice &amp; pain. None of them enlisted including their father. President Trump has demonstrated he is a perpetual liar That is why it is simple for his children to peddle lies. President Trump boasted he will get away with kill someone on 5th Avenue.
@KremlinTrolls @ImpeachTheNazi IS HE THERE TO DESTROY EVIDENCE OR TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE?
@AnnCoulter GUNS MAKE IT EASIER TO MASS MURDER. IF YOU REMOVE GUNS FROM THE EQUATION, YOU WILL REDUCE THE MURDER RATE BY 95%.
JESUS never encouraged nor promoted bearing arms against those He disagreed with. He trained his followers to use His Words to win skeptics over and make the world a safer place. Guns do not solve our problems, they add to the complications in life. Good Christian say no to GUNS
PRESIDENT TRUMP, if a killer plans &amp; methodically executes his terror like the Park Side HS murder, NY Bike trail killer, the Las Vegas murder, should he be treated as mental deranged? PANT up and push to change gun owning age to 23 plus full fed background check. Good for USA
REPUBLICAN hate groups including ANN COULTER call the Park side teenage  who carefully planned and methodically executed his carnage a mentally disturbed young man. But if he was Black or Muslim, they would have called him a Murderer, a Thug, a Terrorist.  Sad picture.
@seanhannity @larryelder @GeraldoRivera Start by holding TRUMP accountable for publicly inviting RUSSIA to hack Hillary emails and to send them to him.
@thehill shame for being an IDIOT in teaming with @AnnCoulter to turn our High Schools to MADRASSAS to teach our children to hate, to buy guns and kill their fellow students in the name of 2nd amendment. How different are they from TALABAN, ICIS, ALKAIDA,  Jesus preached love not GUNS.
@AnnCoulter ANN COULTER want to turn our schools into MADRASSAS where she can teach our children to believe owning and shooting GUNS is better than a HS diploma; that  Violence is the way to control others, USA is not SYRIA or PAKISTAN or AFGANISTAN. Vote to 23yrs as right age to own gun.

@thehill THEN PAY THE DIFFERENCE WITH YOUR OWN MONEY NOT THE TAXPAYERS MONEY.
@thehill Senator, with a knife, he would have been pinned down by other students. But with an AR15 he was able to mow down 17 innocent lives. GUN is the difference in this equation. Without the gun at least 12-15 of victims would have lived. Please listen to the shots. sound like FALUJA
@AnnCoulter There are millions of troubled kids in world, especially in developed countries but are not mowing down other children in schools because they do not have ACCESS TO GUNS- AR15 MILITARY RIFLES. That's difference. TRUMP said he will shoot some one in 5th avenue and getaway with it.

@realDonaldTrump President TRUMP believes in GOD? How come he is not observing Gods' commandments: "thou shall not lie", "though shall not bare false witness against thy neighbor"and "Love your neighbor as you love yourself". Other principle  "REPENT when you are wrong" Obeying them is loving GOD

@realDonaldTrump HOWMANY employees will they be firing? Walmart announces bonus for some employees and simultaneously close 74 of its Sams Club stores. Comcast did same last December. Bait and switch tax cut. Both companies say the tax cut made it possible to give bonuses and cut more staff.
Thank you Senator Hatch for leading the charge against bigotry. Now we must ensure that Muller completes his investigation. God bless America. https://t.co/cKUWvI2d3e
@AnnCoulter SHITHEAD leader spews out SHITWORDS and supported by other SHITHEADS like him.
TRUMP	"SHITHOLE" is where silicon valley gets all its minerals from to line up all the high tech devices that Made America Great. Oh if you can read history, it is men and women that were brought here as slaves from SHITHOLE that built the American economy that enriched your dad.
@AnnCoulter 8 BANKRUPTCIES &amp; HOLLYWOOD TAPES TRUMP told you TRUMP cannot keep promise if not forced by court. You voted him in office despite all the red flags including "MEXICO will pay for wall" May be N. Koreans kept in dark would have said we did not know but we Republicans? Shame. Shame
TIME WE HIGHLIGHT THAT FACT. POLICIES TAKE TOME TO MATURE &amp; THE ECONOMY IS BLAZING BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE. 	Trump is steadily eroding the Obama executive orders that are supporting the pillars holding up the economy. 2008 on the way, watch this page https://t.co/qpLQiY3YN4
RT @KamalaHarris: We need to keep up the fight against mass incarceration. With the opioid epidemic raging across our country, we don‚Äôt nee‚Ä¶
US ECONOMY &amp; US Presidents	Bush sr. senior runs down economy	Clinton erases deficit and leaves 5 trillion surplus	Bush Jr. ruins economy, mounts deficit &amp; leaves country busted	Obama inherits busted economy, builds it, strengthens and grows it, 	Trump now enjoying Obama economy.
@thehill That is because they know Trump will sign anything they put on his desk. They have found a perfect conduit to move their convoluted policies like the bias tax bill to the finish line.
GO FOR IT. Just watch for Trump saying you cannot sue business people. He will pardon them if convicted. https://t.co/HU48pq7LeS
TRUMP FACTOR on display. REPUBLICAN house members including Paul Ryan and Darrell Issa run for the exit in anticipation of a tsunami of GOP meltdown in 2018 midterm elections. They are afraid of being the minority. If they can stand up to Trump now, they can grow majority. Yes??
@seanhannity Sean, do you disagree with his assertion about the death of informants? Have you read the Dossier? Has any of Stills assertion in his dossier been proven correct?	How long did Bengazi inquiry last? Why are Republican house members working hard to stop the special council?
@AnnCoulter Oh so it hurts to lose a city or a state. Tell that to the NATIVE INDIANS who once owed all of USA but have since been confined in reservations with little or no room to roam as they used to.  Regan and Republicans opened Amnesty door and Trump will open it more. watch this page
TRUMP will be TRUMP just as noted by Michael Wolff in his book. https://t.co/cHfzJGCPfi
TRUMP is putting our safety at risk by reversing all Obama safety executive orders on Oil spills, coal mining worker protections, college loan profit caps, etc
@thehill Their game plan is to make room for Trump to appoint loyal AG who can actively participate in and later shutdown Russian Investigation. That is the plan. To give Trump cover from exposure of embarrassing and criminal wrong doings. Typical Republican hypocrisy. Sad
@AnnCoulter Ann, problem is not "POTHEADS" rather "HYPOCRITES " like M. McConnell, who called to delay vote on Obamacare until Scott Brown was seated-granted. but now he refused to delay tax vote until Sen. D. Jones was seated. Republicans are killing Russian probe but completed Bengazy. Sad
IF I WAS A REPUBLICAN, I WILL VOTE FOR THE MULLER INVESTIGATION TO RUN ITS COURSE SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE THAT ARE USING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH ENDS. WE CAN ELIMINATE SUCH ROUGES. Support MULLER and SPECIAL COUNCIL and the FBI. God bless the USA.
@AnnCoulter OH! NO!. Are you just waking up? Please note that as long as you keep Trump believing he is a President, America will suffer deeper and deeper loses in all intelligent agencies. There are others in line of succession that can restore USA. We must move to restoring USA now.
@seanhannity Just remember that the adjacent cell will be for those calling for her lock up. Remember Flynn at the 2016 RNC convention? Time to lock Flynn up instead. Yes Lock him up!!!. You should be calling for release of the Fusion GPX congressional testimony. Good for America and for you.
@AnnCoulter Ann	When you hang you hopes on an empty vessel, you will certain return home with an empty bucket. No wall if Mexico is the spoken financier. Oh! Trump is bankrupt to pay a dime. He played on your emotions of hate for immigrants. A status your ancestors once were. Surprised?
@thehill BACK MAN! a barking Republican attack dog who barks to just to be noticed? Oh! Minnesota will rise above empty vessels like Back Man.
RELEASE THE FUSION GPX Congregational and Senatorial testimonies.  REPUBLICANS, man up and tell your congressional leaders to release the FUSION GPX testimony they are holding. We want to know what they told congress.
@AnnCoulter Yes, they will be preparing adjacent cells for Trump inner circle what they are convicted of collusion and other related crimes by the Muller Special Council investigation.
@thehill IF YOU TELL LIES, IF YOU MANUFACTURE AND PEDDLE CONSPIRACIES, AND IF YOU ATTACK PEOPLE, YOU WILL GET MORE HITS. PEOPLE LIKE TO WATCH AND READ FAKE NEWS LIKE FOX NEWS. IF IT IS FROM RUSSSIA, IT WILL GET MORE VIEWING BECAUSE IT IS FAKE NEWS.

@AnnCoulter NO MILES COMPLETED BECAUSE MEXICO IS NOT PAYING as the Republicans were fooled and doomed to believe. TRUMP knew he was pushing a FAKE BUTTON but because of hatred against Immigrants and Minorities, GOP voted for TRUMP empty "Mexico will Build the Wall " promise

@SierraExpress HOW? Any suggestions? 	I suggest they start pointing calling names and fingers at corrupt politicians whom they know very well. They can also vote against corrupt politicians and the party that house them. That is one way to fight corruption-remove them from power and money

ALABAMA IS BLUE LIKE VIRGINIA. TRUMP AND STEVE BERNERN WERE SENT PACKING OUT OF THE DEEP RED. THANK YOU ALABAMA. NOW TIME TO LOOK INTO TRUMP SEXUAL SINS.
ROY MORE"S HORSE WAS RELUCTANT TO RIDE HIM THIS MORNING AND ALMOST DROPPED HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS HYPED HORSE RACE TO VOTING . THAT WAS ONE SIGN OF DEFEAT FOR TRUMP.
TRUMP vote was a Hate vote against IMMIGRANTS and MINORITIES. A ROY MORE vote will be a SEXUAL IMMORALITY approval vote. Both votes will kill America and  the Church. Christ loved STRANGERS and He also hated SEXUAL PERVERTS AND SEXUAL IMMORALITY. Save the church. Vote NO for ROY
ALABAMA Republicans-if you vote for ROY you are legalizing sexual harassment, sexual perversion, child sexual exploitation, prostitution, and opening the door to open SEXUAL IMMORALITY. STAY HOME OR WRITE IN OR VOTE JONES. TRUMP vote was a mistake. correct that now.
WHY DO OUR LEADERS KEEP CALLING THE PIPE BOMB TERROR IN NEW YORK an "ATTEMPTED TERRORISM". WAS THE BOMB DETONATED? YES.WHERE THERE INJURIES, YES AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY? WERE PEOPLE TERRORIZED AS A RESULT?  Yes to all ????. A duck is a duck. Call it TERROR

@AnnCoulter And who will pay for the wall, TRUMP, or YOU. Because Mexico is not. Can you hold Trump accountable for his promise _"Mexico will pay for wall". Can't believe Republicans fell for a liar and now all our children are being taught to lie.
@BillOReilly Bill, convicted SEXUAL predators do not get to comment on crime. Let the prosecutor handle this. You had your moment and you used it to prey on volunerable women who were trying to feed their families.
@AnnCoulter Help your country find the truth about today's treats. Yesterday's treat were death with. America and our way of life is in Jeopardy of being delivered to the communists. Or shall I say you love communism?
@marklevinshow HYPROCRICY can only destroy a people and their community. When you discussed sexual harassment November 29 you delerabetly did not mention Fox predators Bill O, Roger English etc. Be balanced. Name them all or mute your mike.
@AnnCoulter Please do not confuse mask Christianity with free Christianity. Russia is still a community is the state masked behind the cross. Christians in US and other free nations enjoy first and second amendments while Russians live under communist pressure

@thehill Tell Giuliani Hilary is smart, human, forgiven and respects her oath before God.  Unlike Giuliani and TRUMP who divorce daily.
TED CRUZ might as well take back his shadowy SHAMEFUL endorsement of Trump. Democrats offer all what he cited as reason for endorsement.
LOW ENERGY-TRUMP	Obvious from debate yesterday that TRUMP has low energy. He was constantly drinking and staring as if lost or confused.
Stamina. If TRUMP cannot sustain 90min debate without drinking water &amp;sniffing every minutes how can he handle the long presidential events
Trump admits he does not pay taxes, " if I did it will be squandered" he noted. He brags taking advantage of laws. "Change laws" he said.
Clinton had substance while Trump rant with little meat. Trump has no plans to bring jobs back
TRUMP interrupts Clinton rudely during  her response while Clinton allows him to finish his point. That is very in presidential.
Trump is sniffing every minutes. Is he OK? Drinking lots if water!! Seems dehydrated like one need med attention

TRUMP	A story teller. He repeats same story with different twists each time he tells it &amp; expects you to believe all his different versions
@JuddLegum @PaulBegala All like him cannot MAN UP to denounce Trump. They are more concerned for their positions than the security of USA
Next US President must work to reset internal relationship to strengthen  nation or we risk crumbling from within. Vulnerable when didived
Remember!, B.Clinton and Democrats handed Bush and GOP $5tr surplus economy.Then  Bush &amp; GOP handed Obama &amp; Dems a crumbling economy &amp; HATE
TRUMP	Talks tough security yet has no plans for fighting ISSIS!!. He will ask generals for plan 30 days after he wins. Way to lead TRUMP!

If USA was a kingdom king Obama would not have had to deal with Mitch and Tea party GOP. America would've been grater and stronger than is.
We must remember that Republicans destroyed our economy and in Jan 09 their leaders conspired to deny President Obama any inch of success. ?
Unemployed and many in poverty need to blame the Republican Party for frivolously spending 5Tril surplus from Clinton and destroying economy

IMMIGRATION REFORM A MUST. IT IS TIED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IT BENEFITS ALL. PRESIDENT OBAMA ACT NOW
GUNS SHOULD ON THE LIST OF DANGEROUS PRODUCTS THAT KILL LIKE TOBACCO, ALCOHOL MARIJUANA AND MANY TOXIC DRUGS THAT ARE   DEADLY
Guns do not kill. but the combination of a gun and you makes a deadly portion that kills many instantly including yourself.like guns go army

@ZerlinaMaxwell  i TOLD YOU NOT TO SWEAT WITH QUESTIONS.
@ZerlinaMaxwell @AngryBlackLady YOU NEED NOT WORRY B CAUSE THE PRES WILL HANDLE HIMSELF.

GOP's ceo's failed to deliver promised profit.	Time to downsize or change at the top.	New blood can deliver better result.
@SAPOMRYAN-candidate wins if more people agree with his arguments and and vote for them. It is called TURN OUT
Generals are known to handle webs of wars and soldiers but today we see them handling web of women. It is indeed peace time-debriefing time

@DemGovs @politico 	I agree he is crook. He needs to be investigated and pay back the monies he over billed his clients
HANNITY-admitted that RELIGION was GOP's PROBLEM. Founders figured that 200 yrs ago &amp; the DEMS agreed. Religion is hypocritical &amp; dangerous

TO SURVIVE GOP FIRST MOVE IS TO MARGINALIZE McCONNell,BACKMAN &amp; GANG, J BREWER, tune off  TRUMP, BECK , RUSH, HANNITY &amp; take on IMMIGRATION.
As I predicted the GOP as we know it is history. There will be a revolution to change course &amp; reform or else it shall be history.

Good Housing market means people found great jobs. Economy has rebounded. Stimulus has paid off. Credit President Obama with your vote Thank
