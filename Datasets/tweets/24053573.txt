@robmferrier The depth increases the difficulty in finding the actual leak &amp; making the repair.
@robmferrier I have a little more info. The main where the leak is, is about 10 feet down and is 'significant' but we still think 6 to 8 hours.
@robmferrier Yes, I can assure we're doing everything we can to restore service to your home.
@robmferrier I just heard it will be at least six to eight hours before service is restored.
@robmferrier I'll let you know when I get an update.
