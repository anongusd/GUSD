You want to make the most of your fastings and prayers, deal with the barriers of SIN first.
Explosive favor responds to prayers and fastings.
If you want to grow in grace, you need to grow out of sin.
During prayers and fasting, the root of sin must be dealt with so that you can have an encounter with God.
Jesus didn't die for us to live a careless live, deal with the sins in your life before they destroy you!
