@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul We should end this conversation since we can’t agree. But let’s agree that the education system needs help.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul You are luck that $100 isn’t a big deal. I’m glad for you.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Thankfully many unions are starting to win relief to help with cost. Many lost their homes over this law. Imagine not wanting a raise.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Law implemented in 2011 called chapter 11 makes us pay for more of health insurance then the rest of the state to help tax payers. So I pay my towns school taxes and those.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul So we pay on the premium for health insurance. It’s different every year. As my salary goes up I pay more. So I never actually make more. I also pay for my disability.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul It is, I buy individual supplies each year. I’m a special education teacher. Every child needs individualized materials. Ex: I buy shelving at target for $70 or the catalog we a mandated to buy from using my $50 yearly budget. Those shelves are usually $100 minimum.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Again separate issue.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Interesting considering I’m not making much and I pay for most of my supplies!
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul I think that is a bigger conversation that has more to do with the education community becoming a corporation instead on individualizing the shaping of young minds for the future of our nation.
@LibertarianSF @M_McIntosh113 @RandPaul Right but this doesn’t bring unions in the mix.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Actually I agree with you on this. Besides 3 states the rest of our nation has lower education. NJ being number 1 and top 10 in strongest unions.
@LibertarianSF @M_McIntosh113 @RandPaul The facts about costing money to the economy are interesting, but it also doesn’t talk about what good education puts into the economy. You get what you pay for.
@LibertarianSF @M_McIntosh113 @RandPaul Do you have a research article or news article? This is a blog, not that I don’t find this interesting.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul https://t.co/dIfRFasPgp
@NightlyPolitics Yes. It’s time to come together and stop the polirization. It is contributing to trumps agenda.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Better school better town and safer town. The schools dictate the neighborhoods, they the heart of the town.
@M_McIntosh113 @LibertarianSF @RandPaul Not every state bills the tax payer first. Second, our state is first in education &amp; 1 of only 3 that rival the rest of the world. Third, if you don’t want to pay taxes for better schools you can move to a lower rated school area with cheaper houses. That is your choice.
@LibertarianSF @RandPaul Yes true. In the state I live in, the teachers a part of the union negotiate salaries, health benefits, hours, class size among other things for the entire staff in the union or not.
@LibertarianSF @RandPaul Also thanks for your intellectual and calm response.
@LibertarianSF @RandPaul When you make one salary one day and make half the next or when you have a job one day and not the next the cost of living doesn’t matter. They crowded school rooms and fired teachers giving them a one page contract that said they had a job and a new lower salary.
@zcleghern @TampaBayAJ @pandaslvsandy @RandPaul Wisconsin is the perfect example of this law hurting jobs &amp; wages. Teachers lost jobs within a day &amp; lost wages after this was implemented there. You can choose to be in a union or not. You are supporting ur job &amp; ur peers if not then u still get the wages &amp; perks they fight for.
@thedeneau @RandPaul I don’t know why this is a mystery to people. They did this in Wisconsin and amount of job loss and page wage drops disrupted the entire state. Unions are for workers.
@RandPaul Or factual information is that places with unions have better work environments, higher wages and that spills over to other work places in the area.

@marcorubio Let’s make this clear, there is a war on women. I know you tried to mansplain it differently, but you clearly don’t know what it is like to feel like a second class citizen. -someone that is truly pro life.
@marcorubio There is not logical or truly religious reason to control other’s people wish to live and have the same rights as anyone else. Legal marriage for all signifies equality. So if you are a proponent of it you are anti- equality.
@marcorubio The pro life movement needs a new name bc I haven’t met many that are actually pro life. This includes you. Prolife means protecting all life w/o controlling or endangering another life. You do not do that. You allow harmful chemicals in the environment &amp; take $ from the NRA.

@BlackpilledPage @RadioFreeTom Lastly, studies show US abortion rates are down when we put more money into educating young girls and boys. Abortions will not stop bc it’s law. More women will die doing illegally. History tells us that this country doesn’t like to be told they can’t do something.
@BlackpilledPage @RadioFreeTom There is also less education for sex education and goal setting happening in states as funding has been removed for that. If you educate girls to choose a responsible life they will not have to choose. Also why are the women &amp; doc only being punished?
@BlackpilledPage @RadioFreeTom I have 2 friends that had to have an abortion. The babies did not live. If they didn’t have an abortion there body would become septic and they would die also. If hospitals stop doing a procedure more women could die.
@BlackpilledPage @RadioFreeTom I don’t believe in abortion. However, I believe in a women’s right to safe healthcare and I do not judge others right to choose. With Roe, some states with limit reproductive health and contraceptives. Sometimes a woman needs an abortion to live.
