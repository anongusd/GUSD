@TVietor08 So you literally can‚Äôt name an example of Obama going before a hostile audience (other than Congress??) and trying to persuade them of his position the way that Rubio is doing now.
@TVietor08 Please name them. I honestly can‚Äôt remember Obama ever speaking to a room full of NRA members &amp; trying to change minds. Instead he spoke from safety of briefing room. (Also, why didn‚Äôt Obama do anything on gun control when he had majorities in 09-10?)

@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT among greatest irony of 2016 is that Trump skipped a FOX NEWS debate because he felt they were unfair
RT @ddkochel: @maggieNYT @AlexConant @AriFleischer @jmartNYT #IStandWithMaggie
@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT bottomline: for those of us engaged in 2016 your story holds up 100 %. (Also,Dems made same error.)
@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT Rubio's camp wanted nothing but more debates and tougher moderators.
@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT If RNC had allowed organic media process in 2016, we would have had more debates and fewer candidates
@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT End result is fewer debate giving celebrity candidate most airtime &amp; long-shot candidates airtime.
@maggieNYT @AriFleischer @jmartNYT Easily overtaken by celebrity candidate. RNC too weak to enforce real qualifications &amp; nets wanted show
