Re: Rush Limbaugh—&gt; https://t.co/jAA92dXenH
On CNN Rep. Darrell Issa just cast doubt on Friday’s Mueller indictment. “How do we know” the charges are accurate? “Did we hack them?” Calls the timings suspicious.
@sfheuser what does Rush say about him?
even the Fox News commentary so far is (relatively) critical. one talking head calls it a “propaganda victory” for Putin.
Trump has long insisted that Putin didn’t want to see him elected. Putin himself said otherwise today.
How can even today’s Republican Party stand for this? This is a fundamental test of Trump’s power like we haven’t seen before.
this is like GW Bush blaming New York City and the FAA for 9/11
This is surreal. The greatest Hollywood thriller never made.
Trump says “we have both made some mistakes,” talks about Mueller and Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t name a single one on Putin’s side.
