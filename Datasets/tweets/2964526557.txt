In 2018, the U.S. economy grew by 2.9%, keeping in line with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's promise of economic prosperity for the American people. In Congress, I will continue to fight for economic growth across West Virginia and around the country. https://t.co/d8qwI1S4Yk

Despite constant attacks from liberals and obstruction by Democrats in Congress, President Trump has stood firm and delivered on the promises he made to the American people....
Tonight, President Donald Trump outlined a bold agenda that will continue to grow the economy and keep America safe...
"We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" #SOTU
"We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs." #SOTU
"Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people." #SOTU
"My Administration recognized the true capital of Israel -- and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem." #SOTU
"America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are born free, and we will stay free." #SOTU
"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU #ProLife
"There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days." #SOTU #ProLife
"Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure." #SOTU
"Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.  So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe." #SOTU
"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl." #SOTU
USA! USA! USA! #SOTU
"My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.  Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations." #SOTU #Jobs #choosegreatness
"We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.		We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms." #SOTU #choosegreatness
"Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps." #SOTU
"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started." #SOTU #choosegreatness
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good. #SOTU
