@CharlesFinch Great dress.
@kashanacauley For me, this sparks joy.
Constance Wu is stunning. #oscars
@bcmystery I promise I’d take good care of it.
@MystiBerry I think you’re right.
Gunne Sax couture. That is all I will say. #Oscars
@cmclymer Couldn’t agree more.
Michelle Yeoh’s dress is stunning. I wonder if she’d let me borrow it when she’s done... #oscars
Ahhhh, Daniel Craig. My favorite Bond villain’s thug.
@tinangel You’re so right. SO. RIGHT.
@sarahmaclean They should have just sat down. So we didn’t have to cringe.
I feel like Gunne Sax couture is coming back. #oscars
@eliza_lefebvre It’s going on my list!
@AuthorJuliaT I am already in possession of the DVD!
Not thrilled to see the big, droopy bow tie making a comeback. #oscars
@cmedders Isn't he just?! I will miss tweeting with you, but this way you'll be able to fast forward through all the boring bits. #oddsaretherewillbemany
I used to try to binge all the #oscars movies I could before the ceremony. This year, looks like I'll be using the ceremony to determine which films I should watch.
What’s your #Oscars style? For me...Hair: damp, unstyled (hey, at least it’s clean!). Clothes: pajamas with top hat-wearing hedgehog and an ancient ratty cardigan. Tell me you’ve ever seen something better than that hedgehog and I’ll tell you you’re a liar. https://t.co/CMNr3cR3Zo
I'm digging Spike Lee's purple glasses. #oscars
On the one hand, I want to tweet the #oscars. On the other, I don't want to contribute to the world being snarkier and nastier than it already is.

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;	Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,	And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.		-Wilfred Owen
What candles may be held to speed them all?	      Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes	Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 	      Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,—	The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;	      And bugles calling for them from sad shires.
Anthem for Doomed Youth		What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?	      — Only the monstrous anger of the guns.	      Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle	Can patter out their hasty orisons.
Today marks the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI, a devastating conflict that destroyed a generation. I can't think of a more appropriate way to remember the dead than this brutal poem from one of the war's many magnificent poets. It will take a few tweets, so bear with me.

@david_hewson If I look at it too soon after writing it, I read what I meant to write, not necessarily what’s actually on the page. If I let a couple of months go by, I can come at it with fresh (and harshly critical) eyes.

@ATTCares Thank you. I've sent the info.
5. FIX THIS, @ATT. I have spent way too much time over the past NINE MONTHS trying to get your customer service to sort this out. Is this the way you treat your customers?
4. Ironic that we would have used @ATT for our landline here, but they don't offer service in our area. Instead, they took money they shouldn't have, never have corrected the situation, and have now erroneously sent us to a collection agency.
3. So I kept calling, kept being told the situation was handled and that we would get a check. Instead, no check and they have now sent our account to collection. I've been a loyal @ATT customer for more than fifteen years. This is the thanks I get?
2. Every single time an @ATT rep promised me it was taken care of and that we would receive a check for the money we hadn't, in fact, owed. Never got a check, but kept getting more bills for service months after the line should have been disconnected.
1. Before we moved in last June, I asked @ATT to disconnect our landline. They kept billing us. We were on auto pay, so they took money for a couple months (moving chaos prevented me from dealing with this at once) . Called multiple times to have situation corrected.

@flmom1957 Who can keep track of customs? Women only use nomina. But, wait! It’s the Imperial Age. Now they’re going with nomina + cognomina. Half my sources say they were referred to by nomina, half by cognomina….Maybe it was individual choice?
@AshleyTHoffman They’re great names! Now I just have to remember they’re praenomina and should only be used on inscriptions and by people extremely, extremely close to you. Because that makes sense.
Anybody else think it's just a matter of time before Dante springs back to life so he can add a few more circles to his Inferno? https://t.co/15sU6VxTGg
