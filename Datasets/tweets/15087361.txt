@punkrawkse @ericdnelson Hey Phil, the reason we don't have the interactive maps on right during the on sale is because there are so many people trying for the same seats at once the map would make the process a lot slower and more difficult. We often get asked by shows to remove it.
@hurricanesadie @punkrawkse @ericdnelson Sorry about that! We'll address it!
@ericdnelson Hey Eric, thanks for your note. Promoters hold some seats at the presale so that there are still good seats for the on sale, so its likely those seats were held for on sale day. Looks like you still got some great seats, and we hope you enjoy the show!
