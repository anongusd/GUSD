@RayLongstreet @primalpoly @MaxBoot @RepSwalwell The majority of handguns are double-action for convenience and safety. This technically makes them semi-automatic.

Was just having a perfectly civil conversation, but the leftist block button has a hair trigger. Smfh. @spidervontrapp	This is how you make people right wing. Fortunately I understand the sensitivity of leftists. Just remember to air out your hugbox every now and then. 🙏 https://t.co/iuxH7J5SxV
@spidervontrapp Your first statement makes literally no sense.	I was about done myself, probably feels like we're both bashing our head against the wall, but I learned something at least. I'll check out the video; I've been meaning to look at more leftist content creators.
@spidervontrapp Right, I think portraying population mixing as genetic drift (within a "small population") makes little sense.
@spidervontrapp There is a lot of assumption and vagary here. I'm really not sure what it is you're claiming, if anything.
@spidervontrapp I don't really care about race qua race. You disagree that people find it important, fine. You say it would be so slow as to be unnoticeable, but people are noticing it. I'm not sure force is necessary at all tbh. I'm not an ethnonationalist; I'd like to find a liberal solution.
@spidervontrapp Your first point is obvious hyperbole; the second point does not follow.	I've not heard anyone claim anything close to 2 gens, but large-scale trends are hard to reverse without time.	I'm not sure you know what genetic drift is tbh.	I think race affects culture even w/o genetics.
@spidervontrapp I would never claim it as a genocide; I think that's rather sensationalist. I never said it was involuntary, but to what extent are people's actions voluntary? I think society affects people, but even if they were happy about losing blackness I would feel loss. I enjoy diversity.
@spidervontrapp Well some race realists would say that there's a genetic influence on culture that differs with race. I'm unsure myself, but I understand the reasoning based on evolutionary first principles. I'd say that I care about race because other people do. I want less racial tension
@spidervontrapp Like this?	https://t.co/PooCdk8tpy	I don't see anything that would support the idea that fertility rates will equalize.
@spidervontrapp You are certainly under no obligation to talk to such a vile racist. Block me if it makes you feel better.
@spidervontrapp Well I hope it's not Viking DNA bc I don't think I have any of that! In all seriousness, if there was a danger of blacks in the US disappearing I would be very concerned. You may not agree that there is any danger, but I don't think it's unreasonable. 		I do not unfollow.
@spidervontrapp What's creepy to me is seeing a reply to me with some fatuous strawman that I hardly get to read before it's deleted.
@spidervontrapp That would be sad. Go ahead if you must. I'll follow you in another browser. I'm not fully decided on race realism, I just see the evidence pointing that way. I try to find people who disagree to get more information on the subject. If you would rather force me away, so be it.
@spidervontrapp I would love to look at your sources. I'm only just starting to look into the subtleties of population projections. I have no confidence that races will equalize birth rates even with total "equality". If they do, white rates would still have to increase to maintain population.

Many of the decades long wars we go through are to mitigate risks of such a nightmarish holocaust. https://t.co/ILgWTSoPWS
@4lternate_facts Just don't back out or attack on character. I would like to see serious argumentative opposition for once.
@QLHS23 @4lternate_facts Very interesting one-sided characterization. I've heard similarly idiotic statements from alt-right people. Maybe learn how to investigate claims &amp; present coherent opposition. If they don't provide reasoning or evidence, you should be able to make this clear. Don't be defeatist.
@AdequateEmily @4lternate_facts Someone has to do it, even if it has to be progressives.
We are all potential "genocidal maniacs". If you thought these ethnonationalists were a big enough danger, I bet you would support massacring them. Something to consider. Try not to alienate &amp; demonize the demonic aliens. There just might be better ways to approach the conflict. https://t.co/PDVG5HJs01
RT @Andywarski: We got @Styx666Official and @thealthype  having a chat with @JFGariepy of course! Come chill and let's see what happens. ht…
@joanofice @Andywarski This is the problem. We can't really know without talking to them what they actually believe. I see many violent outcomes for these ideas, but ignoring them or hiding them doesn't help anything Imo. You may disagree; I think we have some common concerns we can address peacefully.
@joanofice @Andywarski I don't think ideas are dangerous; I'm more concerned with actions. I found the discussion immensely helpful because I believe the best way to prevent dangerous actions is to understand the ideas behind them. I have never heard Spencer advocate violence, but maybe you know better
@joanofice @Andywarski I also struggle to understand this fear of people &amp; ideas. It seems to me that giving a platform to a message should only be worrying if the message is powerful &amp; you find yourself unable to effectively counter it. You feed into identitarian victim narratives by blacklisting them
@joanofice @Andywarski First, calling the alt-right Nazis is idiotic &amp; lazy. Maybe you didn't follow it, but Andy wanted very badly to get a significant foil to Spencer; the best he was able to get was Sargon, Vee and Kevin Logan. It's not his fault left would rather pussy out than face debate.
@joanofice @Andywarski Do you think his ideas stand up to scrutiny? Is it better to hide from this conflict or investigate it? Pushing a radical movement underground is not typically the most effective tactic.
@MikeStuchbery_ @Andywarski I'm curious what you mean by this.
Interesting. So JF (libertarian) and Styx are fascists. Good to know. I'm sure you think Millennial Woes is a fascist. Vee and Kevin Logan came on too. Are they fascists? Maybe you could define fascism for us. https://t.co/vR0PV2nH5R
Always fun to see people threatening violence on one another. Peace and love, peace and love https://t.co/PJdeNzXLbv
@DominusStercore Ha I can be the same way. That's why I always make myself engage seriously even if there were insults going back and forth. I often learn the most from discussions that begin confrontationally. I still think what you did was uncool but we can disagree without hatred I hope.
@DominusStercore Oh that guy looks familiar. I'll watch it when I can; I've been up all night talking with people. Some of the conversations I have are really difficult and often stressful. I'm glad we at least were able to converse civilly; that is always my primary goal. Thanks 4 challenging me
@DominusStercore No from what I understand ethics is about how you conduct research, because that's something we can actually analyze objectively, and not motivational speculation. In any case I'm try to get to the truth for its own sake so I don't think your definition of ethics applies anyway
@DominusStercore I really just wanted to get into debunking conspiracy theories but I guess I have to study IQ first. The discourse has gotten very strange &amp; difficult to navigate. I'm always very concerned about being considered a hateful evil person, which is why I responded so harshly at first
@DominusStercore Oops replied to wrong tweet lol sorry if that's confusing. https://t.co/Jod625oDFN
@DominusStercore Okay I understand that concern. I just want to understand the biology without the baggage of those who argue one way or another. I don't think it's my place to say who deserves attention when I can't at least prove their premises wrong.
@DominusStercore I'm not sure about that claim that scientists don't know what intelligence is (you said IQ which is the measurement but I understand). Do you have a source relevant to this? I've only started looking into IQ as well but from what I know it is strongly correlated with many tests
@DominusStercore I'm sympathetic to considering consequences certainly, and I even consider myself broadly utilitarian. However, I don't think the scientific truth can ever be held back indefinitely and it poisons the reputation of those who attempt it.
@DominusStercore I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying that the truth is not as important as its ramifications? This could be a misrepresentation; I just don't know what boundaries you are talking about. Unless you mean ethical studies where we should be able to find specific violations.
@DominusStercore That might be true but it doesn't change whatever the reality of races are. The argument for impact is that IQ at least would account for some socioeconomic imbalance &amp; dispel notions of white privilege through systemic racism. Regardless, I would like to learn the biology on it.
@DominusStercore I have seen those tendencies. They argue denying race is motivated by fear of racism &amp; wanting people to be naturally equal. I care a lot more about the facts than motivations, so I tend to ignore claims like these, as they are also unfalsifiable &amp; tend to generalize demonization
@DominusStercore Well I disagree with your portrayal of race. To say it is limited to appearance I think is unscientific. Obviously there is only one species, but race just refers to genetic clusters based on divergent evolution. I could be wrong on this too; there should be studies either way.
@DominusStercore It is also a good starting point in argument against alt-right conspiracy theories. If whites succeed at least in part because of high IQ (which they believe) then why wouldn't the same be true of the Jews?
@DominusStercore Well I have seen data showing clear I differences. It's possible this is due to poorly formed studies, or social factors, but I haven't seen a good analysis to show me this is the case. I am looking for some. You and I both have biases from people we trust that should be examined
@DominusStercore I have heard that too, but I have also heard that is an attempt to undermine the credibility of the science it contains, so I'm more interested in addressing the content. I'd love to see your video when it comes out; I'm considering making videos myself.
@DominusStercore Okay, those are good things to consider. Do you have a source that did an analysis of the claims? I need something that addresses the arguments &amp; studies to get any traction in debate. More information on the book's background would be good, but not as good if that makes sense.
@DominusStercore I would be glad to hear your critique of the book &amp; studies, or if you could link me to somthg that addresses it well. Literally just got the book, to investigate some of the claims &amp; I haven't read it yet. If the data shows societal causes for IQ diffs would make things easier.
@M_Konigsmarck Interesting interpretation. Have you been following the conversation? I understand the appeal of memes but I'm legitimately trying to express an openness to new information. I typically reject conspiracy theories out of hand bc there is usually a better, simpler explanation.
@DominusStercore What conspiracy theory do I buy into exactly? What that I have said do you disagree with? I'm perfectly open to being shown that Jewish IQ results are in line with the average and that they don't really hold significant positions of power. I don't think there is any conspiracy.
@DominusStercore Giving you the benefit of the doubt, which you might not be a fan of, but maybe you should consider the possible ramifications for your boredom cures on the people involved in your amateur internet PI work. I don't like seeing people hurt on either side tbh.
Well damn. Fishhook theory strikes again. Maybe it's pyramid theory? 🤔	They seem to want to push open minded people to one side or the other. I experienced this many times talking to the alt-right, being called a liberal cuck and such. Interesting to see the mirror image here. https://t.co/5IhYJmsxFG
@DominusStercore I think you purposely say little and imply very much. I don't think anyone is fooled into thinking that you published these images without attempting to damage JF's reputation. It's clear you consider him to be racist, so I understand your motivation, but these are scummy tactics
@DominusStercore Prove what? High Jewish IQ? That they hold positions of power? I didn't realize these were actually controversial. Or do you mean prove that we can dispel illusions about the Jews and paranoia? I'm only beginning to look into these issues, so I'm perfectly open to being wrong.
@DominusStercore This is why I consider you disingenuous.
@DominusStercore Except you were using this as an attempt to damage JF's reputation, when he has nothing to do with the vast majority of these discussions. You are also presenting a slippery slope when ever questioning the position of Jews, which is exactly what the optics discussion was about.
@DominusStercore My position on the JQ is that Jews have some amount of nepotism, as is only natural, &amp; they tend to rise to positions of power &amp; wealth partly because of naturally high IQs. This is consistent w/ the alt-right beliefs &amp; I think with an honest analysis we can dispel many delusions
@DominusStercore I agree. I am an atheist as well, &amp; I find the obsessive support for Christianity in some of these circles rather amusing. The Jewish question has different levels; the reason I'm interested in looking into it is to alleviate paranoia about Jews and idiotic dictator worship.
@DominusStercore I've been looking into the beliefs about the Jews, and there is a considerable spectrum when you actually consider it objectively. I have never heard anyone there seriously advocate for genocide; in fact, we kicked someone and almost banned them for joking about it.
@DominusStercore Maybe you could show me some more screenshots, or recordings that you took so I can understand exactly what you're talking about. Imagine being concerned about optics when saying nigger or Jew in a joke will get you attacked, as well as people you know. We're def all the same tho
@DominusStercore Maybe you can extend that love to some of the other people you smeared as racists and nazis
Yes, I follow more than 3,300 people. I like to keep an eye on cancerous idiots. Enjoy being a scumbag. https://t.co/GT0PA2iHmN

@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny What do you think I'm promoting? You can choose to see all of my talk of empathy and compassion as virtue signalling but I don't understand why you view me so poorly. I hope I haven't made you hate any more than before.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I care very much but I don't expect to convince you of that at this point. I think it's incredibly unfair to draw comparison between these cases.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Okay I guess you're done engaging seriously. I hope you can at least think about having empathy for some of the people who will be affected by this.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I guess we'll see what happens. You might consider this moralising but I don't see how this is funny to you. We are talking about real people who could have their lives destroyed. That makes me very sad.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I get it if you think I'm being unfair but I really did try to be empathetic about Destiny's situation; it actually sounds really fucked up and I don't know how I would react in that context. Material proof of what exactly though? Certainly not that JF raped anyone.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny That's fair. Equally fair I think would be to point out that no court has ever declared JF a rapist or chosen to pursue such a case.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I actually hate to bring up past transgressions but when Destiny claims that JF admitted to being a rapist, and thus should be deplatformed from Warski etc, an examination of his moral purity is inevitable.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Well I don't consider threatening murder against a child is anything close to mild. You don't see my interactions with other people, especially those within JF's community, where I try my best to dissuade engagement in dirt digging. I don't like JF being called a rapist.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Obsessed is a bit unfair. I care about clearing misconceptions about people I like, but I really wish this wasn't an issue. The only reason I've continued to engage, while I could be skiing, is that I don't feel this animosity between our groups or between us is productive
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Maybe you could be more specific? I tried my best to analyze the situation objectively but I've seen Destiny mention that he threatened the child and he was certainly not sorry about it. "Fuck that kid and his family" I'm trying here, but you have to give me something to work wit
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I really do try to give Destiny, and everyone, the benefit of the doubt. I'm not sure what things I've said about him you consider unfair but I'm certainly open to that criticism
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I have little reason to trust Destiny but I don't assume that he's lying about things without evidence. Even when he says something obviously false I try to think about how he might have come to believe it
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I'm open to being convinced that these things are untrue, and I really don't hate Destiny. I think he has little respect for others and I wish he would engage more civilly but I've actually heard him make good points that get ignored bc it's Destiny.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I mean, I've also mentioned to people that he threatened the life of a child and intimidated him with a firearm on the internet. I really don't like all of this uncharitable moralising though. I can even understand why he did this even though I think it's disturbed.
@truMalma @BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Now you are generalizing and denying the individuals you're interacting with the benefit of the doubt. Speaking for myself, I have never done any of that shit. The worst I've done was share a few Destiny memes bc I thought they were funny.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Sure, I think it's unfair. It was never presented as fact though, merely an expression of frustration at how unreasonable Destiny and his fans have behaved, at least in the interactions we have seen
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny 1. I don't have proof of this right now, but I am giving the benefit of the doubt and not assuming a lie on JF's part. 2. That's a fine opinion, but I don't see how this judgment could be applied to other cases. How long must the couple cohabitate?
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Okay that's a bad interpretation on my part then because your statement was ambiguous. I apologise for that I definitely overreacted looking at the context again. I think it should be considered though bc it seems some are fine with condemning this woman to never start a family.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Right, and I don't think he would ever claim that judgement as objective, hence strawman
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny 1. Attempted multiple times to engage with the family. 2. Nothing here was immediate
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Kids cannot consent in the first place, and they are not the fucking issue here. Don't muddy the water throwing that shit in here.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Retroactive removal of consent is currently illegal in the US. If you think it should be allowed, that would be a new law
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I was mostly referring to the "I AM THE OBJECTIVE HOLDER OF TRUTH" part
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny This is my point. You give nothing specific to determine what qualifies as "cases such as JF's"
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Slippery slopes can be very real. Especially if you have a law that can be interpreted very broadly without specific metrics. Side question: can retards ever have sexual relationships or children?
@Beef_Taquitos @BeastBossNasty @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I would say you need to give objective criteria for your new retroactive rape rule.
It's a great idea to attempt to humiliate people who evolve in their viewpoints https://t.co/MEZs7oEWLT
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I'm sorry but that's pretty fucked up. Do you realize the precedent this would set?
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny That's also a complete strawman of course
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I'm a big fan of the &gt; in these cases
@BeastBossNasty @truMalma @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny That is not what I said. I think we should consider her feelings and professed consent as at least part of the analysis.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I agree
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Deemed unable to consent after the fact.
@BeastBossNasty @truMalma @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I fully understand that. I was saying I would listen to my sister's feelings on the subject
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I'll admit this is a pet peeve of mine and I did understand the context. I just think there are better ways of presenting that and quotation marks should only go around real quotes.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny That was the intent behind my statement. I think we should all try to be charitable in our interpretations of one another. Not just because it's nicer, but I think it's more productive as well
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Am I being rude? I honestly try not to be, but when someone I consider a friend gets called a sociopath, for defending someone I respect, I get a little angry. So I called her an asshole.
@truMalma @Beef_Taquitos @BeastBossNasty @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I would like to think that I would listen to that family member and her feelings. You may be laughing but this isn't amusing or fun to me. I defend JF because I would be infuriated if my family member was attacked this way. I don't think it has to be a relative to have empathy.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny That's all I really wanted to say. I might be retarded but I try to respect people's feelings
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Right, that was his interpretation, unlike your supposed quotes
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Quotation marks around paraphrasing or your interpretation is very hacky. I'm not attributing intent here but they should be reserved for verbatim statements
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Yep. Try to think about this objectively for a few minutes. I know it hurts, but let's try to give the smallest amount of benefit of the doubt. I can't believe the amount of hatred coming out over this. Compassion seems to be lost in all of this and it makes me sad.
@BeastBossNasty @Beef_Taquitos @truMalma @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Bruh that doesn't fucking matter
@truMalma @Beef_Taquitos @Popehat @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny And what the fuck do you know about his feelings? You get to decide if someone is in love? Then you call people sociopathic for defending someone they respect from personal attacks? You are such an asshole.

@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Fair enough. That was always the point.
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts I would say you have an extremely strict definition of censorship. You've inferred this, but I never implied something so stupid.
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts No. Censorship is not binary like this. You are taking the extreme case to be the only acceptable use of the word. You are also implying government with the use of the "right" to listen or speak.
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts 1. Not necessarily, no. 2. Obviously. 3. What? 4. Never the issue. https://t.co/2WoblsX7Yw
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts He is certainly censured all the time. It's a nice play on words, but did you change your mind on him being censored at all?
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Government need not be involved for something to be censorship. Free speech is not a binary and it can be infringed subtly. I don't believe this tangent was irrelevant, seeing its connection to the idea of force.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts 1. You're welcome to make the case better. 2. Adding qualifiers that were not there originally is not representing things accurately. 3. Cool. 4. The way you read JF's tweet made it seem that way.
@ChristiAmador @BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Thank you. Your qualifiers are irrelevant; you have conceded the point.
@ChristiAmador @TheFrude @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Wrong. If I have a censored book, I may still be able to look up the original language.
@ChristiAmador @JFGariepy @BeastBossNasty @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts This is a very narrow conception of censorship. Hammering dicks off of Michelangelo's statues is censorship. The fact that he can make more does not change this. Redacting words from a book is still censorship even if there are other copies of the book &amp; the author can write more
@ChristiAmador @BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts He was strawmanned and slandered with the label of racism. It is not that he feels censored; he made an argument for the consideration of this behavior as such. We have already been over the point that being able to speak after the fact does not negate the censorship.

Good job on that animal sanctuary though buddy!
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts 1. It's an interpretation of the definition not "re-defining" 2. A facetious strawman is still a strawman 3. Bad source for a definition, but I think you might be correct. 4. These numbers do not mean this is a logical chain.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny This is just wrong. You have removed certain elements of my speech out of the whole. Just because some people hear the message, doesn't mean you didn't suppress it in whole or in part.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Yes yours appeared to be a genuine misunderstanding. I think a strawman implies intent. You construct an enemy that you can destroy. An unintentional misrepresentation is more like losing your glasses and swinging at a mirage.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Interesting how "unintentional" sneaks in there. I don't remember JF or myself ever saying that.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I publish a book. You put out a version that has been censored. My original message is still there for all to see. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE CENSORSHIP.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts Using quotation marks around a strawman is a hacky and dickish thing to do, censorship aside.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Censorship does not have to be total. Being allowed to speak out after having been censored in no way eliminates the first act of censorship.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts I'm not sure what you think he is implying, but I think I understood what he meant. I have a presentation which would include your argument, but I take your argument and replace it with my strawman. It is different than altering the original source material sure.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny Then I'm not sure what you think censorship is
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @ChristiAmador @thekingcowshow1 @4lternate_facts They are both theft. I'm not sure what point you think you made.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I disagree. In a strawman you are taking a message or work and portraying it differently than it was intended. You are censoring that work before you convey it to your audience. Does that sound completely stupid to you? If I leave a word out of something, is that not censorship?
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I mean that's just a bullshit analogy
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I don't know what you mean by "actual legitimate" but yes this is a semantics discussion.
@BeastBossNasty @JFGariepy @OmniDestiny I never mentioned the ethnostate debate, so you're either confused or misrepresenting me. I would probably make a distinction b/t hard censorship of preventing speech and soft censorship of suppressing or distorting the message, but I don't think JF is being disingenuous here.

@germanBruin That is fair, but after a growth rate that steep it is common to see a sharp decline. I would like to buy some but I have no confidence in growth continuing enough without losing all my principle before I can react.

@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 I made no attempt to represent the position of RaceRealist so I don't see how I could have strawmanned him. I have read that thread a few times now and your insistence on believing I haven't is incredibly immature and counterproductive.
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 Once again, I never claimed to rebut anything. The only claim I was contesting was that Kraut was not in any way saying "find the genes." I think the evidence I provided of him mocking the notion of inferring genetic causation without gene identification is worth considering.
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 This is too ironic. I called you out on your bullshit inferences which did not logically follow from what I said. You then accused me of strawmanning while making me out to be a liar. Good show sir!
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 Are you very fond on non-sequiturs?
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 I never made that claim. Perhaps it is you who does not understand.
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 I saw the thread. Repeating yourself doesn't strengthen the point.
@Onisk64 @JFGariepy @chemsavant47 He is very much saying "find the genes." He goes out of his way to mock the idea that we could infer genetic causes without identifying specific genes. https://t.co/31zjCdLorZ

So your argument is guilt by association? https://t.co/DyVbVmzGtX
@GodiBjorn So class conflict and scarcity are not caused by capitalism. But how is something that arises naturally from natural things not natural?
@ElBartoArmy I will look into it but unless it provides an alternative definition of capitalism my point stands.
@ElBartoArmy The ancient Greeks had capitalism before Christ for fuck's sake
@ElBartoArmy Well I imagine you have you're own Marxist definition of capitalism
Yes, capitalism is natural. Hence it existing in every society that has ever been. It is simply the free exchange of goods. https://t.co/i8Vt0kFfjo
@ElBartoArmy Swastika=advocating genocide? No. Symbols are open to interpretation and indirect threats do not warrant violence.
@ElBartoArmy You can imagine all you want but doesn't make it feasible. Class is a natural result of asymmetric human interactions, just like capitalism.
@ElBartoArmy Wearing a swastika is provocation enough though?
@ElBartoArmy Then how do you get to communism w/o authoritarianism? I rarely see people even pretend to try. Punching dissidents is a step the wrong way.
@ElBartoArmy I was under the impression that such revolutionaries favored authoritarianism as a means to the end of communism. A necessary intermediary.

@OscarAster No, it's called being a fucking hack. You don't put quotes around "paraphrasing" idiot.

@jesterfebruary @cgray_studio @Reuters That is what he is testifying about. We will see, with more certainty at least, whether this actually happened.
@OrganizeItAll @Reuters Somewhat, but presented more objectively than most other outlets.
@cgray_studio @Reuters No, it's not. It proves nothing. This is why we go by laws instead of feelings.

@Joha_wa_alHimar @CassandraRules @EricMorisset It is less accurate to say that the tax rate was 0 percent than to say that the tax was not in place. No tax rate without a tax.
@ronbadman @TIME The victims can't tell us how 2 prevent future attacks. The man is dead &amp; will gain far less from our analysis than potential future victims
@RickySpanish_ @CassandraRules Thanks for the platitude. Hyperbolic strawmanning is a scary thing.
Keith is hilariously unhinged. https://t.co/jVqXudRh5S
@JeffHollandaise No what's silly is putting a straw man in quotes. Leaving that up lets others encounter and believe this lie.
@Cernovich @jaketapper Stop dick measuring dick.
@Independent Because it's clearly working. The citizens can have an effect besides merely continuing to exist.
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran This response was lazy though. Jokes are jokes? Thanks Socrates. Sorry if that hurts your butt. Every snowflake is unique.
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran I'm not really offended I just think that you could do better. Also think that comedy can have serious impact &amp; thus should b based on truth
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran I do have to thank you for at least disclosing the fact that this was fake though. I had actually assumed that it was real.
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran Jokes can misrepresent reality &amp; they can very easily mislead people. There were surely people who laughed &amp; moved on without seeing your *
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran I get that. I used to watch all your videos because you were so fucking funny. Misrepresenting reality however is not entertaining. Logic.
@cultofdusty @Sa7awi @Atheist_Iran I thought you had both. What happened?

@TIME Don't take the click-bait. Encourage some actual fucking content instead of lures. Clicks are currency; earn them. #ClickBait
@JeffreyToobin @nytimes It's not a statement you hack. This is an allegation made second hand which is unacceptable to present as fact. #FakeNews
@laurenduca I've learned that you're racist and sexist, so, thx! I guess you haven't learned anything from Trump. #Sad
@RayPhillips207 @laurenduca Why would that be ideal? How is that not inherently sexist?

@WaxPringle @nf_reece @PrisonPlanet Falsely claim he was SJW? What does that mean? It's subjective characterization. His story seems biased but does death also end discussion?
