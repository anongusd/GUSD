The bee says its' purpose, is to "help students improve their spelling, increase their vocabularies, learn concepts and develop correct English usage that will help them all their lives."
The bee began in 1925! Then with just NINE newspapers coming together to promote literacy. #beefacts
The program allows more spellers from highly competitive areas, or those that don‚Äôt have sponsors, to compete at the bee- adding 238 spellers this year. https://t.co/NBUBi3HH6G
That's because the bee expanded the field of competitors through a program known as RSVBee, a program that started as a way to increase fairness among competitors. https://t.co/DhS2n24ei5

RT @EamonJavers: Weekend.
As of today, May 18- the Army Corps mission assignment is complete. PREPA, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, takes the lead on this mission from here. @fema says the lines of communication remain open, between themselves and the Congresswoman and the Puerto Rican Gov. https://t.co/7YGMKmos7L

That allows for the "lease, generation and maintenance of all three mega generators until the PREPA completes its purchase of these generators." https://t.co/epm5YoPo0K

What @PressSec just said regarding Manchin-Toomey discussions is true. Sen. Manchin told me earlier they're working today with the President and his staff, taking the bill "line by line" to see if/ what they want to change.
.@SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell on gun reform: "It's hard to get in the Capitol without going through a metal detector, an airport. We need our schools to be safe...we‚Äôre looking at all aspects of this. we had an extensive discussion about it today at lunch." @WKYT @wbkotv @WYMT
SC @SenatorTimScott another supporter of Fix NICS Act: ‚ÄúSupports the Second Amendment, and also sees a need to consider options that will help prevent bad actors from acquiring firearms, which is why he helped introduce the bipartisan Fix NICS Act late last year." @WRDW_WAGT
.@SenatorRisch tells @AshleighNDeLuca "before I get to make any decision on a bill, I'm going to see the exact language on the bill." This on Manchin-Toomey expanded background checks proposal.
GA @SenatorIsakson also a cosponsor of @JohnCornyn Fix NICS bill. "He will carefully review any proposals that come before the Senate as he continues to work for common-sense legislation that keeps our children safe without infringing upon our Second Amendment rights."
"We will protect the second amendment rights but we‚Äôve got to move on what we call gun sense," @Sen_JoeManchin shared with me this morning. Saying @realDonaldTrump is going to help them on gun reform. @WSAZnews @wtaptelevision @WDTV5News https://t.co/pfgnDA1YNl
"I believe there should be a resource officer, police officer that is armed and trained in every school, from kindergarten all the way through, and they have to be prepared and ready to protect the children at all times," @Sen_JoeManchin
"We continue to have significant discussions on Capitol Hill, and I am hopeful we will be able to find agreement on several of these items and take action to address this problem, which is what the American people are demanding‚Äù @SenBobCorker, cosponsor of Fix NICS on gun reform.
"I want to work with him and I think we have a chance to do it," @Sen_JoeManchin on his meeting with @realDonaldTrump on gun reform.
"I think actually the @NRA is very often right but on background checks I think they‚Äôre wrong and I‚Äôm the guy that‚Äôs willing to stand up and say it," @SenToomey this morning as we discussed the Manchin-Toomey bill to expand background checks on gun sales. @WENYTV @ErieNewsNow https://t.co/Tbiml0qYWO

On gun reform, Texas Sen. @JohnCornyn says to start with "Fix NICS", a bill to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with cosponsor @ChrisMurphyCT then, he says, "we can see what sort of amendments people offer that get 60 votes."

@BobtheReplier I am not being dishonest. That is what they are. It was presented as two sides. I present one and bridge to the other side.
@BobtheReplier I don't believe there is a need to mention John Podesta is the founder. People know the organization is more liberal.
@BobtheReplier I didn't mislead viewers because there were two clear sides, a Republican lawmaker and a more left leaning organization.
