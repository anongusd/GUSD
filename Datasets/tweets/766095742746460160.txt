@AmazonHelp I'm not able to access Daily Dish from the browser; it's always been an app-only option. The shopping app is the only one that's not functioning at the moment.
@AmazonHelp It's hanging on a loading circle when entering an account verification code on the iPad app (also latest OS).  If I hard close and relaunch, my account is signed in but I get the same behavior as the phone app when trying to purchase. https://t.co/HWpkamVB6b
@AmazonHelp I'll see if it works on a tablet, and yep, checked for OS and app updates both before pinging you. I do appreciate the troubleshooting help!
@AmazonHelp Unfortunately no, neither delete/reinstall or delete/power cycle/reinstall worked. Also lag when signing into Amazon account prior to trying the lunch order again; hard closed the app while stuck on loading circle and was signed in upon relaunch. Very wonky tonight.
