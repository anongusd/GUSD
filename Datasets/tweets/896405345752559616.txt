@NBCNews Because it, in no way, bans a firearm. It bans a modification piece.		You guys need to learn the difference.
@thehill Connect it to both of them, and watch it catch on fire.
@ABC Stands to gain? How about the end to a war who's older than most of the population.
@satya_or_bust @laura_Co_9 @thehill "the legislatures of three-quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three-quarters of the states."		That's what is required. Many ammendments have been proposed. Some have passed congress. The ONLY ammendments to be approved have been clarifications. Not changes.
@satya_or_bust @laura_Co_9 @thehill No. Actually. It does not.
@satya_or_bust @thehill Google the word: hyperbole.
@satya_or_bust @thehill Murder? No. An ass beating, followed by a year of study in a mandatory class on thr Constitution and Declaration of Independence? Yes.
@thehill He's not wrong.
@eileen_wag @NBCNews Yet you believe media outlets who consistently use Anonymous and Unnamed sources?		Use some consistency in your thoughts. It helps.
@charliekirk11 Really want the answer to that, Charles? Asking questions you already know the answer to is rude.
@NydiaVelazquez We already have a law requiring background checks. They don't actually DO them.		How about enforcing what we have, before writing thousands of more useless pages?
@NBCNews Probably because they are FORMER officials, and are not privy to government figures.

@satya_or_bust @thehill There are people voting for things they have... no understanding of, because politicians blatantly lie to them.		Take Obamacare. The premiums are higher on the marketplace than most other private insurance firms, and over 2,000 counties have NO PROVIDERS who accept it.

@DavidFrost95 @cjane87 Indeed. Also their endless complaints about the "top 1%," without explaining to people that many civil servants make over 400k a year... putting them in the top 1%. The average home in Maryland, near DC, runs them almost 4 million dollars in cost alone.

@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC The problem is a lot of the military make enough to put them in the top 1%.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC My parents made more while military/civil servants.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC The top 1% includes anyone making over a median of 400,000 a year. Anyone. This means, at a 70% tax rate, they drop to 120k a year... less than they even need to pay the cost of living on the 4bd average homes they have in their communities.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC It's literally allowing the rich to tax other rich, and then have authority to declare what a good life is, and isn't.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC The question arise:		Who gives anyone the right to choose what lifestyle someone else gets to enjoy? Who decides what a wonderful lifestyle is? And who, logically, believes that once we allow the government to decide what a good lifestyle is that it won't filter down?

@authorfonner @paulkrugman @AOC "We will take almost all of your income, and do with it what ever we want. If you don't like it, too bad, we will jail you."		That's theft.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC https://t.co/PMBB10AwPb
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC The problem is that our progressive tax system already has them paying more taxes than most of the world. The top 1% pay almost all the taxes collected... already.

@ManacledGerm @paulkrugman @AOC No. I think most own homes in Europe or Canada, who don't tax nearly that high.
@Buddhabman @paulkrugman @AOC Switzerland, Germany, England, Canada. None of whom tax anywhere near that at the highest.
@DrCoyle65 @paulkrugman @AOC Neither is "Tax them the highest rate in the western world."
@ManacledGerm @paulkrugman @AOC All of Europe.
@paulkrugman @AOC Prepare for the rich to ditch this country like a sinking ship, then. They can easily afford the paperwork, and other coutries would LOVE to have them.
@AOC Pointing out 1,000 flaws per idea isn't really a hidden show of the strength of your platform.		It really isn't.
@thehill "Ad-libbed riff on human trafficking"		It sounds like you're upset that he spoke against human trafficking.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump Then nothing is, since there are no charges in that which could even be twisted to mean possible collusion.
@ericawerner Schumer also objected to a vote to SIMPLY pay them, yesterday. YESTERDAY.		But let's be honest, Democrat voters don't have that kind of attention span.
@Independent Solution to ISIS - A 3,000 mile wide sheet of glass.		Otherwise the countries there need to police themselves.

@MSNBC Quick, someone build a Reichstag so liberals can burn it.
@Acosta A flashback to the burning of the Reischtag, considering how the crowd is acting.
@ABC It amazes me how much the Liberals are acting like Nazi Brown Shirts, even in the chat of this broadcast.
@sotnak @CNNPolitics When that was the case, I blamed McConnell. Once votes took place, and Democrats tore apart every one of them, I blame Democrats.		You see, I don't have to only choose on side. Especially when both are acting like children.
@sotnak @CNNPolitics Oh. I can't. Republicans are being assholes about this. 		The only reason that Democrats are at fault, currently, is the votes yesterday to refuse any form of CR to just pay people 2 paychecks and keep arguing.
@AOC @dandrezner @jasonfurman Most intelligent Tweet I've seen you make. Did you write it?
@sotnak @CNNPolitics So... hostage taking? "You give us something that we only want to show up Trump, or we obstruct opening the government until you do."
@Zodden100 @sotnak @CNNPolitics Trump smells like shit. Doesn't mean it's on him. He doesn't have a gun to senator's heads.
@thehill @RepScottPeters @HillTVLive Which the Republican bill addressed, in great detail.		Is no one going to mention that even 5 democrats yesterday said that the things Trump is demanding, even the 243 miles of steel barrier, are the top 10 things border experts say we need?
@sotnak @CNNPolitics Because the Republicans hold 54 votes. They need 60. That's why. They can do nothing for a budget without 60 votes. 		Towards the end of the day yesterday Durbin, a Democrat, tried to start working across the aisle, and Pelosi threw a fit this morning.
@sotnak @CNNPolitics No, the House has passed 10 bills to reopen it until the end of February. Which the Senate attempted to take up yesterday and Schumer objected to all 10.
RT @marklevinshow: Schumer says no to funding Coast Guard https://t.co/SZlDhtb7uv
@Independent Now show Cruz's rebuttal that made him apologize six times in his NEXT 4 minutes of talking.
@CNNPolitics It's not up to him. It's up to the House and Senate.
@business Yeah, except Pelosi already said that they will vote it down in the House.
@washingtonpost Because Empathy isn't the important thing here. If anyone else watched the 9 hours of Senate debate yesterday:		The Republicans tried 6 times just to pass a CR to pay them for the next 3 weeks, and continue the debate... Democrats opposed each one.
@Independent You, the Independent, should have been paying attention to the 9 hours of Senate debate yesterday.... or you should stay out of it. Your article is full of blatant fabrications.
@washingtonpost Except... he hasn't?  A CR only means the discussion continues, and people get paid for 3 weeks. 		If no out is found in 3 weeks, the shutdown resumes.
@AmberHumphreys7 @Independent You should read the article.
@Independent So... he wasn't banned for being gay. Only that his speech was too political, and he wouldn't change it. That's in the opening paragraph of your OWN article.		What was the point of saying he was gay? Clickbait + LGBT bait. Also a non-story.
@GeorgeTakei Yes, because that is the important fight going on. 		I respect you, George, but you've gone mushy in the head.

@CNN Has anyone mentioned to @CNN that more than half of border patrol agents are Latino?		No?		They should.
@FredQuackinbush @RealJamesWoods (Cont.) What you advocate is the physical and mental torture of people, trapped behind walls wherein human rights suits rarely escape.		I say end them. If that's less civilized, then civilization is barbaric.
@FredQuackinbush @RealJamesWoods You wish Civilized? Very well:		There are two options here. Prison or death.	We do not have Humane prisons, to the point that suicide rate for women is 9x higher than the national average for women. 		What we have is human made Hell, wherein we stuff people to suffer. (Cont.)
@CNNPolitics I'm certain we can handle a starving and beaten army. From a distance. Without firing a shot.
@FredQuackinbush @RealJamesWoods See? 		You'd rather lock them in a concrete hell to be physically, and mentally, abused for years on end instead. I say put them down quickly, and I'm the evil one.
@Newsweek The charge is simple:		"The Government wants you to disappear."
@RealJamesWoods I vote dead, not jailed.		Then again I'm a Libertarian, we're apparently evil according to Twitter.
@org_theory @thehill They had 10. They fired:		1: The person who approved that article.	2: The half of a person left after their ass was torn in half by facts.

The absolute, mind boggling, insanity of this "article" is terrifying. As they blatantly torture the english language to keep SOME semblance of racism to this story. Including using the word "others" being obviously racist.		Sad part? People believe it.		https://t.co/q8uWd3hZFi

@Independent The people. Always trust the people.
@HuffPost Are... you so out of sources you'd quote Christie? REALLY? You made fun of him for 8 months, and said he's a pathological liar.		Based on your own reporting, he is lying now.
@business But, hey, Socialism is great, right? RIGHT?!
@axios 74% of Democrats, and people who lean Democratic, are stupid apparently.
@CNNPolitics Considering the Shutdown IS the Democratic campaign? 		Why not?
@guardian Oh, but it's okay for the Media to partake in the doxing of highschool children?
It amazes me that Doxing is even legal. The excuse of "well, they are on the internet..." For most things, posting images of people without their permission is a crime.		But not social media? Everyone shares everyone else. That doesn't make making their information public okay.
@nielslesniewski @CQnow @rollcall I would, but unfortunately I can no longer watch what NBC has become. I barely make it through the drivel they post on Twitter now.
@Reuters Yes... we COULD. It would come at the expense of nations setting aside their differences for, say, about an hour.		They wont.
@freedom_moates The Left is starting to show their true colors. Demanding all Russians and Russian friendly people be deported or jailed. Caning, flogging, and doxing people they THINK might have offended them.		The list goes on. Just in the past 2 days.

@freedom_moates Didn't you know? It's okay to be violent towards evil people. Anyone supporting Trump is an evil person.		The fact that it isn't open rebellion is simply because they are afraid of guns.

@MattWalshBlog They acted like kids do everywhere. The Left finds it "funny" to post videos online of teenagers threatening their teachers in the classroom... but because these kids were wearing MAGA hats, suddenly it's bigotry and racism.		The Left NEEDS bigotry to exist, so they can exist.
@thehill So could Democrats. You really lack a point.
@maybe_caroline @axios At least, 30 years of my life.
@maybe_caroline @axios I left the Democratic party once I realized that, for some reason, for 30 years they've been "fighting for the poor and mistreated," every policy they ever enacted was worse. It dawned on me that they perpetuate that which they 'fight,' and make millions as public servants.
@AdamBaldwin Simple Rules:		1: Conservatives believe Liberals are stupid, so try to talk slower.	2: Liberals believe Conservatives are EVIL, and try to destroy them. Completely. Utterly. 		You do anything you have to do to destroy 'evil,' and Liberals do it gleefully.

@PunishedVenom2 @MarkDice @harry So do a lot of people. They're welcome to try, but I'm armed and most liberals aren't.
@CTurbeau @MarkDice @harry My 4yo thinks boys are smelly, and doesn't like them, either. Doesn't mean I give her opinion any credibility by defending against it.
@LizMair To be fair neither one has a nice set anyway. Not sure how believable they think someone wanting to see a hazy grey outline of them is.
@MarkDice @harry To be fair, still going to use their products. They're good products. I don't care if the people that make them are barely functioning at the cognitive level.		Letting companies believe we give a damn about their political stance is a mistake we keep making.

@Newsweek "Expert." I'm someone with 25 years in the IT field for network security. You never asked me about the fact the only way to hack the DNC was from the inside.		Your experts don't mean any more than my opinions.

@HuffPost Why do these stories only... ONLY... ever happen in liberal cities? I thought the evil Republicans were the racists?
@thehill What's your plan to deal with it? Have one? the climate has consistently been heating for almost 2,000 years. The trend is steady, showing no spikes due to human activity. That's from raw data, not reports via the media.

@21stCenturyFDR @RoKhanna @BernieSanders @SenSanders I'll let you in on a secret. The Democratic Party will not nominate him, for a primary, unless he runs as an independent and somehow manages to get the first independent primary run in a very, very long time. 		In a perfect world, he should win. The world is far from that.
@AaronBlake Consider: 47 billion in trade at risk, because some Saudis killed another Saudi citizen.

@denise_read @thehill Complaining about gun control, when we already have solid gun measures, is ridiculous.
@denise_read @thehill Precisely. The problem doesn't lie with the problem itself, however. What needs to happen is they need to simply demand to know why their states are not reporting to the federal database, allowing those who, by law, already can't own guns to have them.
@thehill Why is everything liberals dislike Unconstitutional, yet they openly want to strip the first four amendments?
@Asneakypete @Turntablez @thehill Correct! And as per a 2004 law their children cannot be detained with them during proceedings. None of those arriving are from countries we have listed for asylum. So... pick one.
@Asneakypete @thehill If the states will not enforce LAWFUL Federal authority, the military will be used.		The last 4 presidents sent troops to the border.  Anyone complain? Well, yes, actually, Obama had protests against him for... oh wait treatment of children and troops at the border.

@thehill It was OUR JOB to defend our country. Part of the UCMJ covers illegal immigration enforcement.		Explains why he retired.
@RepLoisFrankel Yeah... the marketplace quoted me 3x the rate I already pay with fully private insurance.		Thanks though.
@realDailyWire It makes you wonder if Democrats understand an important phrase:		"All enemies. Foreign and Domestic."
@county_kerr @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics As I'm from Texas, and it's my job to keep up with this sort of thing...		Try with someone else.
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics Beto was one, early in his campaign. Then he shifted far Left for some reason, and lost the votes.		Seems to be a trend with Democrats lately.
@business Well... maybe because a large turkey costs as much as a full dinner, if eating out?
@MonicaCrowley Is it me, or are Democrats always unhappy looking people?		What happens when you think things equate success, instead of happiness and humanity.
@AmandaPresto To be honest, most children are ugly little barbarians. I wish parents would accept that. 		I mean, my two daughters are the cutest on the planet anyway, so they are just embarassing themselves.
@TIME Mostly because they've been offered Asylum from 3 nations, and they don't want it? And now they are ignoring the laws of the places they pass through?		And people get upset when you ignore their laws?
RT @Oil_Guns_Merica: Omg how powerful would a nuke be if we put a pistol grip on it?!!!! https://t.co/aWL8d9zJou
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics Right. We already have some pretty solid laws that, if enforced, would keep guns out of the hands of MOST of those with any form of instability or criminal history. Even here in Texas we do not allow felons, or the unstable, to buy guns. We enforce it.		Thus no Texas news. Often.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics They should be arrested, not fined. They are breaking the law and letting people die.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics THERE you go. The right response to gun violence has almost nothing to do with guns. It's a symptom of a different problem that most aren't looking at.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics The age change is possible, though arguing that 21 now is the age of adulthood would be difficult.		Most states already require waiting lists and background checks by laws... laws that aren't enforced.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics Indeed! and in Britain their murder rate didn't budge, with a blanket gun ban. People started using knives.		The problem is mental, not with the tools used.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics We already require the checks - the states aren't reporting.	Define "hard to access guns."	To? You already have to be 18 to purchase a weapon.
@ABC Huh. Cut down their user count by over a third, huh? Damn.
@CBSNews Thank God they are wasting time counting ballots and people cant just concede and get on to real work.
@Karystweets @CNNPolitics Such as...? Restrictions wise. List a few.
@CNNPolitics Let's be honest. It's been a good day for a government shut down every day since the late 40s.
@guardian Probably because Pink and Blue became a fad in the 80s? Not before? Boys and girls both wore dresses in the 19th century.
@CNNPolitics Rut ro. Black female vs Pelosi. How you people will spin the victimhood here will be utterly amusing.
@MonicaCrowley Sorry. Any group of people who want to rape my daughters, and cut off my head, can get lost. That's what this guy said, but he's popular.
@jaketapper Let's not even act. If this man were Republican there would be 500 tweets in the first hour by every Left leaning outlet. This would continue for a week, until Trump said ANYTHING about it, and there would be tweets about that for a week.		This is all you will see about this guy.
@jaketapper And, no, Tapper doesn't count. This is his own account. Looking for Articles on sanctioned feeds.
@jaketapper Any news from the MSM? Nope. 		#DemocratPrivilege
@Vincent___Blain @NBCNews Precisely! Try to force her out. There is legal precedent to remove administration members. However... you said it.
@Rusty_Hook20 @NBCNews They never could. Why they now have college courses teaching them how to study, think critically, and work hard. Literally. These are entry level courses now.		And some fail.
@Newsweek He's allowed to be as bellicose as he likes. In the words of Obama:		Acosta is "in his house." Not the other way around.
@NBCNews Then... stop sending her death threats, you insane bastards.
@JohnCornyn That man... looks like a cannibal. Can we look into this?
@freedom_moates https://t.co/uGbOOgZ7Do

@Toure Did you just say... Obama spoke little about Race?
@ThisWeekABC That man has never worked a day in his life.
@Independent Pretty sure we're irritated with both sides in that issue at the moment, soooo...
@HuffPost Democrats got caught, openly, in 29 counties. THIS year.
@AndyBMcJob You can't use one example, to be fair. Chicago is also a very blue city.
@AndyBMcJob If it helps, I do this to Republicans too.
@AndyBMcJob Now cross reference internal crime rates in those states with their locations of per capita concentration, and look at the mayoral and local governing party.
@Toure @scottwongDC Prayers are never meaningless.
@Independent Like a good Democrat, I WILL make the tax payers pay money to keep counting.
@Dragynwing @NPR I'd argue the psychology of subconscious responses to names, but wont, mostly because I was just making like of a nightmare.
@Dragynwing @NPR "Wall of Flaming Death" would get people moving.
@Dragynwing @NPR I feel the same about Hurricane names. "And Betty has killed 10,000 people, and caused billions in damage."		We should name these phenomena more appropriately. More people would evacute I'd think.
@HuffPost No... he really didn't. Is the @HuffPost starting to utterly lose its mind?
@NPR Is it me, or does calling it "Camp Fire" really work in a diminutive way?
@CynthiaAppley @thehill @realDonaldTrump They are stationed in Texas, deployed across the entire line.
@thehill "We will not follow your laws, or accept your aid, because we don't like how you are handling things."		Now. You tell me. Do they need asylum, or just work?

@Toure @CNNPolitics She never owed him anything in the first place. She ran on her own merits.
@HuffPost "Because the student feels the faculty member’s actions were not based in racial bias, she has elected not to file a formal complaint..."		In your own article. 		Apparently one twitter user is an idiot.
@Newsweek Air in the Bay Area has been unhealthy for years. It explains their politics.		That said, as hollow as the Internet has made this sound, I'm praying that the winds change enough, and people come out unscathed.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump That said, you will find that this will all get worse, in a hurry, in January... and it will make more sense.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump "...Not the really high, creative loathsomeness of the great sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul..." there is an odd character in a book, by an author recently dead, who rather explained modern politics.
@ComradeVeidt @BenHowe I don't have a friend, my people were masacred.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump As a sociologist who does mercenary work for journalists and politicians, focusing on social media and media in general... the widely held statements made by people on Twitter find their way into speeches.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump The second half of his statement holds vastly more weight than the first. The first half was true, the second will be the driving point if anyone supports it.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump The problem, you will find, is an unwillingness on both sides for that. You can argue for it, and even fight for it. I have for 15 years. You just end up old before your time. https://t.co/THCnU4omOe
@RepLowenthal We also need to ensure that the accused HAVE RIGHTS.
@LeftEndPolitics @thehill @realDonaldTrump He's always acted like this. Except with Hillary and Obama, every other contest he's praised both sides.
@ComradeVeidt @BenHowe Nope. It was mexican citizens. The number of white people involved was almost nil.		Incidentally, it's only the white people who were revered. Odd how that works.
@jaketapper Has as much substance as the real one.
@ComradeVeidt @BenHowe Technically we rebelled, and became a separate nation.
@nytimes I don't mind funding birth control, though nobody asks me. I do mind funding abortions, both operative and induced via medication. 		Sad that the middle ground is so lost in this country we can't just settle and move on to actually important problems.

@violiav @washingtonpost Racism is alive and well, and will never leave until people realize they are happily voting for it.
@violiav @washingtonpost Norway has a very charged history when it comes to rape, pillage, and plunder. We need to go start protesting their evil viking ways.		Most cries of racism don't come from the south, oddly. If you watch reports, and their locations, they are from Dem states.
@Kelly_Evaz @AaronBlake Yep, but don't let that stand in the way of a good story.
@AaronBlake "Reportedly." Well. I report that @AaronBlake keeps 50 children locked in his basement. Allegedly.
@thehill Number of migrants who brought children due to 2004 LAW (not Flores settlement) at a record high as well... because it means they gain entry. Even if they stole the kid.

@CBSNews Good. Journalists have spent two years in a frenzy to divulge every secret they hear rumors from by the cleaning staff of the White House's second cousins.  This man does nothing but toss them on a website.
@thehill According to you people Trump has spent this entire two years re-enacting the life of Emporer Nero... which is funny, because he hasn't gone on the totalitarian murdering spree you promised he would.
@AndyBMcJob To primarily run Blue social programs! Once again we see Money is the arguement over happiness.		You do realize where most of our yearly taxes are spent, yes? 14% alone is Medicare.

@idaho_boss @thehill See?		https://t.co/p8frYS7yER
@mobydills @thehill Example: Christ tells followers you will forgive ALL SINS, all. Every one. All of them. He said this six times. If you do NOT do so, he will not stand between you and God's judgement of you.		"Christian" hates a man for being gay, and says it's unforgivable. He isn't Christian.
@mobydills @thehill I'm not deciding ANYTHING. It is in black and white. "If you do this," or "you do not do this" you are not of "x" group.
@mobydills @thehill Look at a list of scientific discoveries, and their religious and political stances.
@mobydills @thehill According to the Torah they aren't. The same applies to the vast majority of "Christians."		If they hold their belief in their books true, they are not what they claim.
@idaho_boss @thehill It started an argument over soup. It did it's job.
@mobydills @thehill No. I am stating that, while Liberals may make better versions of preexisting things... they are not the originators of those things. 		Humans created sunglasses, donwe get credit for sun light now that we perfected it to our tastes?
@mobydills @thehill Right, but by this logic Vietnamese make the best Chinese food, African Americans make the best friend chicken, europeans make the best bread...		And yet none of them created any of these things, but we should give them Credit? Edison thought that about Tesla.
@mobydills @thehill Manhattan didn't exist when Clam Chowder started up.
@mobydills @thehill Yeah, but it's not very good, so I won't be using it for my arguement
@mobydills @thehill They are NOW liberal. That did not start until the 1800s... chowder already being old at that point.
@mobydills @thehill Yes. And the vast majority of Torah adhering jews vote Conservative. Always have. 		 Being as orthodox is the origination point of the religion... conservatives made it. https://t.co/jcLEkHaw1l
@mobydills @thehill I really do have all evening.
@mobydills @thehill Clam Chowders origin was Libertarian. If we go by location and time of creation.
@mobydills @thehill Matzoh is Jewish, and despite "jews" voting blue - actual orthodox vote red from here to Isreal.
@mobydills @thehill You said state. Stop moving goal posts.
@mobydills @thehill That's weird... we have one of the countries top rated soup restaurants here in Austin. https://t.co/qwF0B7Y5Cq
@thehill And liberals cry in their vegan, gluten free soups.
@freedom_moates And sexist. As well as misogynistic.
@thehill https://t.co/7m0ZdMCwXP
It seems odd that Democrats see states that spend the most on public programs as somehow more successful than states with the best quality of life, happiest people, and lowest crime rates.		If your goals aren't Truth, Justice, and Happiness... maybe you're the problem here.
@sweeneybuzzz Ranked 6 for quality of life. Everything else is low.		The thing about Freedom is people get to choose how they live

Democrats: "The state has routinely failed us. Nothing ever changes. It treats us like slaves."		Also Democrats: "Lets keep voting for the same party since the 1800s. Obviously they will save us!"
@Hokieman78 @nprpolitics Yeah. The 75% tax rate had nothing to do with it.
@ThisWeekABC And I say the White House refused. The Judiciary has no authority over who is, and is not, admitted to the White House.
@thehill Welp. How about Liberals stop acting like they are fighting a war, and come to the table?
@Independent Ridiculous? Yes. Honestly beneath Democrat Poll Supervisors to let happen? No.

@TylersOH @CBSNews We do it here in Texas as well. Some years ago we had nearly 300 days without rain, and had wildfires of our own. 		It's all been caused due to environmentalists complaining in California, and judges supporting it for votes.
@TylersOH @CBSNews Pretty much. Truth is often found somewhere between the stories of the Left and Right, at least when it comes to political stories.		That is becoming more true every year.
@TylersOH @CBSNews They used to fund large scale backburning programs. California has had wildfires since the 1800s, but backburning is controlled fires set by the fire departments to clear away brush, dead trees, etc. They stopped that near a decade ago, and this has gotten worse yearly.
@TylersOH @CBSNews Precisely. California needs MORE logging, despite environmentalists complaining, and they need to reinstate backburning. They need to work to mitigate this in the future. See my other comment concerning Trump.
@TylersOH @CBSNews This article, like 50 others from the Left, is about his blame of Californian legislation that caused this to get worse... not his statement to deny funding to help, which is an utterly retarded statement that should have never been made.
@TylersOH @CBSNews FEMAd charter is for Continuity of Government. They bought the charters for Crisis Control. 		That said, you are right. California has fucked up it's forests, as far as fire control... but Trump IS being an asshole... which was not part of my statement.
@TylersOH @CBSNews You're aware that they haven't been able to handle fire control like they want for years, right? https://t.co/XkxclR6AIC
@TylersOH @CBSNews Banning of logging. Banning of backburning. Eliminating numerous patrols a year to clear brush. Electrical Wire infrastructure that was literally falling apart. 		YES. Bad policy.
@CBSNews How were they demeaning?  They were TRUE. Bad policy has created an atmosphere that breeds huge fires.		Even scientists have backed his statement.
@thehill https://t.co/RDRQvdhlYc
@thehill FLASHBACK: Former First Lady Michelle Obama is no longer relevant to the concerns of today.
@thehill I miss the days where Presidents were honest and respectable... woe for the 1700s
@Inskigator It has proven the downfall of every socialist state and nation. The ideology is not evil, but just like Capitalism... it has its evils.
@Inskigator People never seem to understand that when you are fighting for the "collective good," you invariably begin to see individuals as collateral damage. This means that the Political Ideology is more important than the people themselves. Vast wealth expended on virtue,none on function
RT @Inskigator: @SourcesForCNN #PoliticsBeforePeople I fear.  There are so many problems with our utility grids that are unknown to We The…
@Inskigator It's a problem people started pointing out back in 2013, but no one listened.
@Inskigator Indeed. The local infrastructure, which is state run, needs vast improvement. Especially electric and natural gas. 		Coupled with the fact Backburning was banned by judge ruling, which acted as fire dampers, and logging bans... the fires rage out of control.
@TheChuckMo @RoKhanna Medicare, with the parltry few million in the program, already cost 14% (and rising) of our Taxes. If you, literally, multiply the number of people under the umbrella by 10... taxes also double.
@TheChuckMo @RoKhanna The costs, currently, do not exist.  While you, directly, do not see a personal burden... because you already pay, and will still pay via taxes, you are failing to see the elevation in cost due to overhead, oversight, and funding those who refuse to work.
@TheChuckMo @RoKhanna This is an acceptable concept, however you are forgetting the millions of uninsured, government insured, or simply PRIVATE insured. These will have to be consolidated into one program (now requiring a few hundred thousand new jobs.) All of this will cost money.
@dbongino Of course? Democrats will support anyone with a D next to their name. They don't care WHO they are.		I proved that by hitting 100k followers with a Leftist account. My Right wing account was banned and refused public status, despite being the same org.
@RoKhanna If you can manage to explain how to pay for it, without doubling income tax on the entire country... you'd be the first.
@business First one to openly say she doesn't care if people join ISIS, too.
@NPR Shhh... don't point out that Leftists have allowed this to happen in ANY WAY. They will turn on you, fast.
@NBCNews If we are lucky they will head to proper points of entry.		If not, and they test the Military, this will get ugly fast... and they are to blame.
@jew4jeter @RoKhanna @BernieSanders @cenkuygur @Ocasio2018 @TYTNetwork Because Democrats abandoned the real issues long ago. They don't want to talk about them any more.		Why so many of us walked away.
@RoKhanna Generally speaking, you're the sort I would have voted for when still a Democrat. Unfortunately you have a bad habit of moving from statements like this tweet, to joining in the insanity that has consumed the Left.		The duality is disheartening.
@OfficialSPGB @charliekirk11 So... you didn't even dispute what he said. You just gave a snarky reply.
@MattWalshBlog The fact that you clarified this, to someone who apparently doesn't understand basic English, saddens me.
@ThisWeekABC Because printing ballots takes time?
@Inskigator I more blame the banning of logging and backburning. You know, the things that liberals think loom good on paper, but cause big fires.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Oh no. He didn't get along with the liberal Macron, who even most of his own country hate. How dare he?

@SenKamalaHarris First thing you've said that I agree with.
@realDailyWire @RealSaavedra Well, to be fair, it's true. That's why the only news outlet I read on my time off is @realDailyWire. The rest I have to pay attention to for work. Fox included.
@thehill He really didn't.
@Semperi95 @thehill @Ocasio2018 That's the problem. I think for myself. Therefore I get to watch both Democrats and Republicans destroy a place I grew up loving.
@Vincent___Blain That seen, calling it a racist fight doesn't make sense. It isn't racist. It is WRONG, but calling it what it isn't does not gain support.
@Vincent___Blain That one is exceedingly true. However, again, not RACIST. Evil, still, but not the same evil.		The key to getting Centrist support - which neither side currently has - is by arguing reality.		The migrant caravan coming towards the USA is a mix of latin, native, and arabic.
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist Didn't plan on it
@Vincent___Blain That one is... hard, logically, to pin down.  Isolationism and nationalism are not, really, racist. Especially has all western societies are a blend of races.
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist Hyper-realities are, by nature, flawed and eventually destined to lead to pain. Money being a well known one.		Which is why I dislike ALL current forms of fiscal governance, and only support one as a lesser of evils.
@Vincent___Blain That one is, indeed, fair. I don't like Trump, and there are proper tools to fight against a populist movement.		Sadly the only ones the Left want to use are ones easily disproven... racism, etc.
@thehill Lovely. A woman who literally said she doesn't care if people join ISIS is now a senator. 		She and @Ocasio2018 will get along great
@Newsweek Note: he wasn't from Texas. 		Oddly, the only people who feel our state is full of racism... have never been here.
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist Precisely! Which returns to the statement of Mindset.		Cities are, and always have been, too big. Too dynamic. They will never actually be controlled, at least outside of a true totalitarian state. 		You can make them work under an iron boot, or you use them as trade centers.
@Vincent___Blain For those of us who study people, and sociology, Trump was simply expected.		https://t.co/cpKw9GlKtX		Only our Media, in this hemisphere, are actually all that shocked by him.
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist Why are the suburbs more expensive? Because those who live in them do not want to live next to those with urban problems.  It's a mindset, nothing more.		Also, it's been proven that suburbs, world wide, charge more for land that is worth far less.
@Vincent___Blain Populism actually started to rise around 2011, at least in Europe and South America. Trump is a result of it's rise, the insanity that the Far Left has achieved, and the fear people have against Communism.		It didn't SEEM important until Trump.
@CNN Well holy crap. They were just LEFT there? Fire everyone in that mail facility. All of them. Right now.  They broke federal law.		If you want less than this? It's because you know this is bullshit.
@guardian Because 'discrediting' something does not render all of the information contained within as false, or moot. Something Leftists don't seem to understand. They tear at once piece of something, and declare that the whole is now trash.
@Vincent___Blain This picture shows the exact opposite of what the text says...
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist The reason is simple. People are not rats. Making people live like them brings out the worst in them.
@Vincent___Blain @TheEconomist Cities, as places of commerce and trade, work quite well. Much like industrial complexes. However, the standard of living in Suburban and Rural areas is vastly higher, and shows a direct correlation to low crime rates, better education, and more communal values.
@TheEconomist Because Urbanization has never actually been good, in the long term, for any society on the planet. Yet, we keep trying.
@Newsweek It's only taken them a few days to print more ballots, too. Not bad.
@business Pass.
@FinancialTimes Welp, the @FT was right. The only ones who could possibly lose a Trade war with China was the USA.
@freedom_moates Hitting the sauce tonight, Mike?
Insults do not work on me. I have Asperger's, and honestly won't think about you, or your insult, ever again.		Try facts. Those DO work on me.
@Kelly__Decker @SenDeanHeller You apparently have no idea what you are talking about
@stetayen @SenDeanHeller ... you're an idiot.
@JHShattu @Maryfelicetti1 @washingtonpost True. Democrats have moved further left, Republicans have moved farther right. Those are the differences between today and a century ago.		Trump IS a narcissistic asshole, but there is vastly more evidence against him being racist than for.
@VoteDemocrat2 @thehill @voxdotcom And yet again. All of them are finance crime related. MOST of them were already be investigated. 		The 12 Russians we still haven't seen evidence, so we can't actually make a determination on them... especially because they also ran sites supporting Bernie.
@Maryfelicetti1 @washingtonpost Hmm? There are over 20 cities, 5 states, who have been solidly Democrat since the early 1800s. Same the other direction. They never "swapped."
@washingtonpost That... has absolutely no connection. And the fact you are going to try to make a connection is sad.		Always remember.. the "party swap" is an easily proven lie. Democrats have ALWAYS been the party of racism.
@thehill Why do all white Democrat "leaders" look as if they joined the darkside because they were told they could stick their sabers in padawans?
@ABCPolitics @FiveThirtyEight We spend the extra money to live outside of cities because most cities are crime ridden cesspools that people in the suburbs think is JUST FRICKEN DANDY.		Mostly because they have no clue what is going on.
@VoteDemocrat2 @thehill @voxdotcom None of them more than finance crimes.
@SenBennetCO You're welcome. Now go get rid of the ACA so that we can actually have health and mental care again.		Why has no one noticed that the ACA eliminated TriCare coverage for most Veterans?
@thehill Because David Hogg is a moron. He only has a platform because he is a pretty white boy that tows the Democrat line.		What happened to any black or Hispanic students? There was one, but she was white skinned.
@Newsweek Because the color of your skin, according to Democrats, makes you different. Same as gender. It means you need to be treated softly because you are weak.
@TaarnaTaarakian @WitherRocks @AdamBaldwin I'm not white.
@undrcvrmexican @thehill Cute.
@SenDeanHeller You're welcome.  Now get to work over turning the ACA so that we can have real insurance again.		For those who don't know, the ACA changed our TriCare... a lot.
@AdamBaldwin Odd. I have 8 years of college, work in a field that most Democrats can't even grasp... While I didn't vote for Trump, I sure as hell support him against Democrats.
@thehill Actually.... they have no right to do that. There are certain freedoms humans have in this society.
@WholeLottaRosex @freedom_moates ... what?
@TIME Ignore it when people come out of the woodwork to make blatantly false, politically motivated accusations? Especially after 15 years of public exposure and six investigations?
@AlecMoody5 @CBSNews He likely buys Mahogany, to be honest. https://t.co/g6cKPrZisB
@CBSNews A: He is richer than you are.	B: He has people who use every little tax trick in the book.	C: HOW DID WE COME BACK TO THIS AFTER TWO YEARS?		Honestly. No one cared except sheeple.
@michelanna @HuffPost Huh, learn something every day. Thanks, I will look into that!
I don't agree with his political stances. However, I love his method of merely tweeting facts. Not embellished. Not skewed or twisted. He simply states what has happened. 		@CNN, @FoxNews, and @MSNBC take notes. This is what a Journalist looks like:		@justinsink
@guardian If the EU want him to stay out of their business, so be it. You don't get to tell people to f*** off, and then get upset when they do.
@TheIndyTV @Independent He's a drunk with zero standing. You should know better.
@justinsink @Acosta ... proper report. Sticks to the facts. Does not embellish. States what happened, and moves on. 		Good job.
@guardian Fear Mongering Click bait.		On par for @guardian
If anyone tells you that you should use your vote to back a particular party, merely because of your skin color, gender, or sexuality?		#WalkAway. You just met a Bigot in disguise.
@CBSNews ... okay? I invested in Napster once, and they were found guilty of alot of copyright infringement. 		Guess I should be held accountable.
@OffDutyEmperor @thehill Well, it's a Media Narrative that all black and hispanic people are Democrats.
@thehill If anyone is shocked that Democrats are willing to cheat do not seem to understand. 		If Democrats believe every one else to be evil... you destroy evil things. Not compete with them.
@business I thought that China was dominating in the world economy, and the only loser of a trade war with them was going to be the United States? 		What happened to that?
@Reuters Welp. This will get ugly, and fast. If we are lucky they will head to a proper point of entry, and not try to force their way past the military.
@thehill Isn't that what the Left was saying when Obama was in office?		Both were wrong statements.
Too far, either Right or Left, and you will find evil. Everyone seems to admit this, and yet call we centrists cowards.		How dare we not dive off of their cliff of choice.
@Independent The Left Wing just stabs their voters in the front. Yet, their voters keep voting for them.		Both ends of the political spectrum are, by default, evil. Sadly, people can't seem to see that.
@Independent How is this news? I see less News from @Independent on a given day than @voxdotcom
@mikener92 @guardian You... are aware that it costs more to live in rural areas?
@guardian We live outside of cities so that people who have never worked a day in their lives don't tell us how to live.		Democrats will never have the Rural vote.
@thehill They were assholish and uncaring. They WERE accurate, however.
@thehill So? What are you going to DO about it, other than virtue signal to your voters?		Nothing. Pelosi and the rest already said they wont try to Impeach Trump.
@CBSNews If only they had some form of gun restrictions in California.
@ABC No... no it isn't.
@thehill How. How is he stopping any votes from being counted? By sueing for them to be counted? 		Come on
@thehill Sorry, but if a man ever calls either of my daughters a whore, you can go ahead and press assault charges. There will be assault.
@HuffPost People are obsessed with a duck? Why?
@Revkin Don't forget constant lawsuits, and judge approval, to stop needed logging. Restrictions on backburning and cleanup. Etc
@business @bopinion Yes. It IS. However, there are legal ways to immigrate, and a million people a year do it just fine.
@freedom_moates Considering the Supreme Court declared income tax unconstitutional, twice? Yep.
@thehill The man is writing his final report. The President answered his questions in October (a fact the Leftist Media forgot they reported on).		His job is done. Stop fear mongering.
@Kvelez7 @freedom_moates It's number one for a reason.
@freedom_moates Every time my Taxes are used for things I disagree with, to the core of my being, my liberty is being infringed on.		But, hey.
@ThisWeekABC Rome did this. The rural places wanted to stick to the Republic, the cities were busy cheering for the Empire. 		Once the Empire took over, Rome became weak, immoral, and fell not long after.
@GladysCOProud @donco6 @ConservativAnon @thehill Okay. Yeah. I provide facts, you provide insults. This is why Democrat controlled areas are cesspools of anger, violence and proverty.		Have a nice day.
@GladysCOProud @donco6 @ConservativAnon @thehill So... you see her saying it. In numerous videos. Yet I am the liar? Okay, sheep.
@donco6 @GladysCOProud @ConservativAnon @thehill It... is... on... live video. https://t.co/fUcZ8d7iuW is being sued by 18 different groups for posting open lies. Snopes and Politifact are both openly leftist.		Try using your brain, and not someone elses.
@GladysCOProud @donco6 @ConservativAnon @thehill You could also take 2 seconds and find 500. https://t.co/Ue0A8LzLcf
@donco6 @ConservativAnon @thehill Neat.
@TomFitton Good.
@thehill Ill timed? Yes. ill informed? No. I don't think he understands the word Demeaning, it doesn't apply.
@RealJamesWoods Well, James, you're a celebrity who doesn't tow the mouth breather line... you're likely blocked by half of Twitter.
I love it when Democrats say that I am bad for America, or that I am Un-American. It's a compliment. Because their idea of America is a steaming cesspool of violence, immorality, and slavery.		My idea of America is freedom, morality, and community. Things they hate.
@donco6 @ConservativAnon @thehill You can say "liar" all you like... she really did.
@thehill That's only shocking to people who didn't expect Democrats to win in EVERY SINGLE election that is taking awhile to "count votes." 		Somehow Democrats always manage to find enough votes AFTER election day.
@KamalaHarris Roll back all the insane regulations that stop logging and backburning, maybe?
@CNN A business earned money while the elections were going on.
@thehill It takes time to print new scantrons and fill them in.
@HuffPost A liar calls a liar a liar, and they are still both liars. Weird how that works.
@Pastorlmdew @AnnCoulter On that I agree with you. However, that said, the ACA needs to be completely reworked... as the "MarketPlace" for enrollment demands over 300 dollars a month even for people with no income, ruined Veterans health, and more. 		There needs to be a solution, but they dont have it.
@Pastorlmdew @AnnCoulter The Democrats winning message was checks and balances. They can do nothing with Healthcare, they've already shown that. If anyone honestly thinks they will magically fix it..m
@jessinsco @CNN We have 12 churches, so far, establishing temporary housing, food, water, clothing and blankets here in Texas. Some people just dont listen.
@thehill Well, Trump doesn't make Marines stand over him with Umbrellas, soooo....
@CNN CNN. You can't figure out how to help your ratings. Don't tell us how to help other human beings. God already told us how to do that.
@Pastorlmdew @AnnCoulter Democrat Tweets about Impeaching Trump:		Before the election: 418	After the election: 0		And you think one of these groups is on your side?
@AnnCoulter To be fair, if he thinks he has a temporary solution in place... why bother with it?
@PaulHJossey It astounds me how the Left has convinced their neophytes that Voter Fraud is a myth that has never actually happened before. The willful blindness of Democrat voters is reaching shocking levels.
@thehill And Democrats saying they would impeach Trump also ended as soon as the election was over. This is why I happily say:		#WalkAwayFromDemocrats
@thehill Mueller is writing his final report. Despite the misdirection of the Media it was reported in the beginning of October that the President already answered his questions. 		Therefore... even if fired, the investigation is already over.
@BradSherman I highly doubt he would withhold funding at this time, and his timing is exceedingly poor.		However, instead of whining about him... go DO something.
While I love to tear down California, I've never actually wanted it to burn down. Despite our differences in political ideology, my church and 12 others in this area of Texas are preparing housing for those affected by the fires. Message me for details if you need.
@RealJamesWoods @LAPDChiefMoore While I love to tear down California, I've never actually wanted it to burn down. Despite our differences in political ideology, my church and 12 others in this area of Texas are preparing housing for those affected by the fires. Message me for details if you need.
@KatieO425 @thehill However... my statement is to the news outlet bitching about the President, not so much criticism of California.
@KatieO425 @thehill This is true. As someone with Asperger's I can often forget tact, so forgive me.
@thehill Let me learn you something. https://t.co/mfzWpIl40a
@thehill To be fair, the Northern half of California sued the state some years back for not properly running back burning and other programs.
@Independent What does their having to be black have to do with anything? He kicked @Acosta out completely, and that man is whiter than white.
@thehill ... it is counted. Your statement makes absolutely no sense.
@nprpolitics Rosenstein. He is acting AG on the case. All the hype is fear mongering.
@RecoMouse @nytimes In Texas we actually have one of the lowesr violent crime rates... with the most guns.
@RecoMouse @nytimes Right. Ultimately it's a give and take. The biggest reason for the 2nd ammendment, however, is to protect the people against the government. 		The principal is that removing guns won't remove violent crime.
@Alloverite @catpicsonly2 @nytimes Learn to read. Or even listen. Marcon said it.
@catpicsonly2 @nytimes Oh, Marcon is an idiot. My problem is that our media is celebrating this idiot simply because he doesn't like Trump.		They don't CARE if Marcon is being a moron.
@USATODAY @usatodayopinion @SteveXen Yeah, because it's not like the most gun related crimes happen in Gun Free Zones.		Oh, right, and the most police shootings happen in states with strict gun laws.
@seungminkim So, he's rude. Neat. Marcon isn't even respected in his own country. So, two assholes being assholes, but you will cheer for the one against Trump... for the moment.
@RecoMouse @nytimes And, yet, more violence per capita.
@nytimes Weren't you all bashing Trump a few months ago because he said the EU needed to raise their defense spending?		Now your bashing him because the EU wants to raise their defense spending?		Pick a damned side.
@HuffPost The last time Jim Carrey was relevant was... the 90s? Way to dredge the bottom.
@seungminkim @DavidNakamura @jameskmcauley Let them have an Army. The last time most of Europe had an army everything went okay... wait...
@AtheistMayhem @guardian It's The Guardian. Lord, even Douglas Adams made fun of them in chapter one.
@thehill But it was statistically true...
@guardian ... this is the most idiotic...
@business @bopinion The "party swap" of the 60s and 70s is a blatant, and easily proven, lie told by Democrats to cover the fact that they are now, and have always BEEN, the party that supports racism and bigotry.
@business @bopinion The race war where they signed the civil rights act? Freed the Slaves? Created inner city youth programs? Say that all people are equal and free, and race doesn't matter?		Look at Democrat rhetoric, and get back to me.
"Leader." Stop using that word. I do not have one.		We used to send our fellow citizens to D.C. to represent our local interests in a collective for the good of all.		Now you send your leaders to D.C. to tell people how they should live.		Words matter.
@ABC Better ban Youtube. He could have killed somebody.
@Independent "As long as men bow to leaders, and not send representatives, they will always be led to poverty and war."		-Me
@MikeWyatt000 @CNNPolitics If only we had those!
@elfyoutoo @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump Doesn't need to on this one.
@CNNPolitics We actually have a tax payer approved (they don't read budgets) stash of millions of dollars to pay women to be quiet about senators sexually harassing them.		Technically hush money isn't a crime.
@cnni @CNNOpinion *sees kids calling each other daddy, boys wearing women's clothes, unsure which bathroom to use, assaulting bystanders, destroying property, and...*		Yay! No more spankings!
@ElishaKrauss @realDailyWire No one ever said he was fashionable.
@RoKhanna For once? I agree with you, @RoKhanna
@AnnCoulter Especially since many of these ballots will show ink from single sources.
@ThisWeekABC The top income earners pay over 80% of our taxes already. If you people would actually learn how taxes actually worked...
@AlyceLMiller @Krasnoyarsk_923 @NBCNews She grew up upper middle class. She has never worked.
@Krasnoyarsk_923 @NBCNews If you pay attention long enough, as I did, you will see this sort of nonsense more and more from the Left.
@NBCNews She isn't "working class." She's upper middle, now with a 6 figure income.
@ericbolling For once we agree, @ericbolling
@frogbear2 @washingtonpost Democrats are so openly racist that no one believes they are racist.
@washingtonpost Stupid questions are stupid. Color had nothing to do with intelligence.
@jaketapper @kim_wehle @thelauracoates @TheLeadCNN First you have to PROVE the lies. That's the problem here. Exaggeration, hyperbole, and half truths (especially about statistics, considering most of his "lies" were true the month before) do not count as lying.		How about running on a platform of impeachment, and lying openly?
@RoKhanna @GregWeiner1 It's a balance between House and Senate.  Neither is more powerful, unless played up in your head.
@DLoesch @benshapiro I can answer this:		Occasionally stress begins to stack up. The outlet for compiling stress becomes outward expressions of violence that are acceptable in your previous life. You no longer have that outlet. It eventually grows until you break... like thi you seem normal otherwise
@NBCNews Clickbait title is Clickbait.
@mare6367 @thehill They ARE important, and a statistical impossibility that all these votes are only for Democrats.
@thehill Because some how full counties who were "finished counting" are suddenly finding more votes, but only for Democrats. 		It's happening in 4 states.
RT @EcDman: @thehill “Plead with your dad, who I think is literally Hitler, about controlling all firearms in the nation, and leaving citiz…
@thehill I still don't understand the logic behind Gun Control, and no Liberal has ever explained it. They insult you for asking, but apparently haven't thought it through themselves.
@thehill Why? They've been Democrat since the 80s. They vote politicians into the nearby cities who let those cities rot.		If they can't see that, let them stay there.
@Basicbetty5 @CBSNews We fully agree that it was not assault. Where I think we disagree is who is at fault for the situation in the first place.
@ABCPolitics @NateSilver538 Nothing? The shift was historically backed trending wise. The same thing happens to most presidents... except they opposing party tends to gain seats in the senate... which they didn't.
@Basicbetty5 @CBSNews You're aware that it is her job to take the mic? Pay attention to 1 once again... she touches him. He knew she was there. He knows her job.
@Basicbetty5 @CBSNews He hit her arm hard enough that she staggered, and her arm gave out. Not what I'd call 'assault,' but it is physicality.
@mccainin4 @VirginiaLady16 @CNNPolitics @DHSgov Tiko... the Terrabas tribe of Playa Zancudo call themselves Tiko. Sorry for the confusion there.
@mccainin4 @VirginiaLady16 @CNNPolitics @DHSgov All the ones I listed are from South America and Central America.
@Independent Oh Jesus Christ. Really? It was seen on video. He bumped her arm hard enough to make her stagger, and jerk her arm down.		Seriously? Stop covering this moron and tell her to get back to writing children's books.
@Independent Sharia law should be banned in every nation with laws against domestic assault, murder, and women's rights.
@VirginiaLady16 @mccainin4 @CNNPolitics How, exactly, is it race based? It applies to the Tiko people as well as Latin. It applies to Peruvian Natives as well as Velan.		Or do you think only Brown People live south of the USA?
@mccainin4 @CNNPolitics @CNN There were 89,000 children separated from 2012-2014. However...		Those are detentions for illegal crossings, and a law from 2004 demanded those separations (not Flores, and actual law the media wishes didn't exist.) Those weren't for Asylum.
@mobydills @ABC That one is from October
@mobydills @ABC That depends on which outlet is reporting:		https://t.co/delRCAhgVG
@mccainin4 @CNNPolitics @CNN Mostly because Asylum was always handled very rarely, and often by INS. There will now be a high rate of people reaching POEs, and they are not staffed for that.
@karenamyatt @MSNBC @JoeNBC @Yamiche Ha. Go take a look at their ratings, then cross reference it with their viewed and trending reports and the topics thereof. Their non-Trump stories receive zero. Zip. Zilch.
@Basicbetty5 @CBSNews I am talking about the imbalance of reporting here. A solid day of Acosta... the occasional quip about Tucker.
@mobydills @ABC It isn't, really. All special council investigations end with a report to the Senate. That's their final action.
@TheJakeLantz @CBSNews Exactly.
@mccainin4 @CNNPolitics So... you made my point even better for me. Thank you!
@blesh79728433 @CNNPolitics https://t.co/XSRQmzsAIV
@CNNPolitics Only if they are caught crossing illegally. They are not limited if they go to a point of entry to apply.
@CBSNews You people whine about Acosta, but these people tried to break down this journalists door.
If he is writing the final report, the investigation is wrapped. That is what final means. 		Why try to spin it? https://t.co/1pmfGMEuPc
@ABC If he is writing the final report, the investigation is wrapped. That is what final means. 		Why try to spin it?
@MSNBC @JoeNBC @Yamiche It's not a losing strategy. When Trump is gone so is MSNBC and CNN, and you know it. He is ALL OF YOUR RATINGS.
@business Well... they are talking to South Korea for the first time in a very long time, in a friendly manner. They have removed troops from their southern border (you won't cover that, sad I have to monitor 38 North for coverage.) They are dismantling facilities... soooo...
@simsimsala @CNN Actually... all I do for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, is read press across the Western World. In Sweden you complain more about your own politicians.		I didnt say social media, I said Press.
@CNN Restore some standing? With who? Junkier likes him, and he is hardly mentioned negatively in EU press outside of Britain.
@Independent Now explain that "they will only limit these if you do not apply at a point of entry, and are caught crossing illegally "
@guardian Because Gun Laws don't work.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH I swore I heard something about this in first grade...
@TIME And it will burn in the senate, and catch a Veto just for the lols.
@FT And then it will go to a higher court and get over turned. Again. The endless delays are annoying.
@ABC They get away with it in movies...
@cnni A guy guilty of drunk driving, fleeing the scene, lying about his heritage, and couldn't even beat Cruz in a debate? You'd 'paint the town red.' All of them.
If the Democrats have said they will not try to Impeach Trump. If they already have their talking heads on the news trying to convince people that now isn't the time to try to impeach POTUS....		Then all their threats are just empty virtue signals. Grandstanding for masses.
@ThisWeekABC Woot! Grandstanding. Especially since the Dems already said they won't try to Impeach... this means it's a meaningless virtue signal.
@CNN So... Democrats. These demographics have been Democrat since the 80s.		Except College Educated women, where your statistic is a lie according to Harvard which rates conservative and liberal female graduates around 50/50.
@thehill ... and now it begins.		"Thank you, morons, for electing us. We will NOT be trying to impeach Donald Trump. Thanks for the 6 figure income. Again."	-Nancy Pelosi, a summary.
@CNNPolitics It... really didn't. A few more Islamics, a few less Christians. Jews stayed about the same. Two Reps that claim "pagan" views. 		Not much changed.
@cnni How is this international news? I mean, awesome for them, but still.
@ABC When the Stock Market is happier to see Democrats than Republicans... and Democrat voters hate the Stock Market...		You have to wonder why.
@business This all started when Sony banned China from Everquest... and nobody noticed.		Not sure how this means "two internets." A lot of the world does not allow Chinese IPs.
@lightningacdc @cnni @David_Gergen @CNNOpinion Dammit, Jim, they're politicians - not people who get things done.		Or didn't Pelosi admitting that they would not try to Impeach Trump show that?
@cnni @David_Gergen @CNNOpinion For once a CNN opinion is worth being called an Opinion, and not a Rant.
@lkdobbs @thehill They mentioned it, and then spent the entire past two days attempting to completely bury it, with zero further mention.		Do you not find that to be a massive revelation  or are Democrats so used to being lied to that they now expect it?
@thehill https://t.co/oYG64GF4U9
Why? Why don't you guys cover the fact that Pelosi said that Impeachment was off the table. That Democrats will not be seeking it?		Why not cover that? Or would you expect the Mobs you created to turn on you? https://t.co/kP65KmXsMq
@thehill Why? Why don't you guys cover the fact that Pelosi said that Impeachment was off the table. That Democrats will not be seeking it?		Why not cover that? Or would you expect the Mobs you created to turn on you?
@NBCNews Perhaps because Illegal Immigration is being dissuaded?
@HuffPost Well... if Gender is fluid, and Race is fluid... why not age, right?
@thehill https://t.co/QbjfCx2nWi
@business Finally. It was a terrible trend.
@NBCNews He has a point, since those machines were "constantly breaking."
@PaulHJossey They make fun of your looks because they can't find anything else to poke holes in. Means they already lost the argument.
@PaulHJossey I tried coming up with something and failed. Eh. Oh well.
@CNNPolitics https://t.co/QbjfCx2nWi
Anyone else notice that the Media is trying so very hard to bury the fact that @NancyPelosi already said, on Election day, that the House was NOT GOING TO SEEK IMPEACHMENT.		They lied to their voters. Bold faced.		#WalkAwayFromDemocrats
@Reuters Too... bad. Pelosi already admitted the Dems lied to their voters this year about Impeaching Trump... something the Media refuses to cover.
@HuffPost Good luck? Pelosi sold you people out, and already said Impeachment is off the table.
@thehill It wasn't manipulated. It was shown even on NBC. Just stop lying to protect a guy that makes all of you look bad.
@MSNBC Good luck. Pelosi already said Dems won't go for Impeachment... a story NBC has tried to bury.
@TIME It's cost tens of millions at this point, and has found NOTHING about the campaign... just finance crimes the FBI itself could have found.
@peterbakernyt @SethMacFarlane Then you don't pay attention. At all.
@freeqgator @CBSNews Guess which states (and one territory) have almost no gun laws. https://t.co/Mzh3Vei3OH
@freeqgator @CBSNews I am glad you pointed out the idiocy of the law, while trying to correct me.
@KyleGalaga @thehill I didn't lose anything, I don't vote for either of the parties you care about.
@KyleGalaga @thehill https://t.co/5VwD6mDw3E
@YellowJrnl That's amazing that he missed the 17 journalists Obama removed passes from.
@thehill And there's nothing you can do about it.
@SeattleCityClub @RepJayapal Welp. Vote to overturn the law... and it IS a law
@CBSNews It works so well for Chicago.
@ThisWeekABC Do... you Democrats feel conned yet? You basically gave people high paying jobs who lied to you.		https://t.co/ELM9Y8Pmxc
@deliberategod @thehill @Acosta Did they stand up when Dinesh was arrested for a documentary Obama didn't like? Or the 17 reporters he had thrown out of the white house? Of course not... because they dont REALLY care.
@thehill Only by The Media. Not really anyone else.
@142_john @bryanistheway @thehill I should have said Precedent, as opposed to procedure. Any time an AG has been replaced, he recuses himself immediately if his predecessor had as well... same as with Supreme court justices.		Your first half of your first statement is very true, however. None of this is normal.
@142_john @bryanistheway @thehill Basically... @thehill and a few others are cultivating a nonissue to distract you from the fact that @NancyPelosi just said hours ago that Democrats will not move for Trump impeachment.
@142_john @bryanistheway @thehill Actually the procedure will recuse him automatically, without interjection by Trump into the DOJ. As a replacement it is SOP for his 'case load' to be the same as Sessions, Rosenstein remaining in charge.
That said, however, capitalism is the best, and least evil form of society we have currently. It inspires competiton, advancement, and it at least gives most personal value in society. It will never be fair, but socialism and communism turn mankind into worthless slaves.
However, when compared to almost every other form of fiscal governance... it is the least evil, and the most free.  The world is too shifted to go to a barter system, which is the only system more free and ensures people are valued... if you can't go back, go forward.
Are there evils of capitalism? Yes. We begin training children at age 5 to work 40 hours and never question it. We save 10 years at the end of our lives to act like human beings. Most small towns have enough money in a local bank to set the entire town up nice for life...
@NBCNews Have to love technicalities. Unfortunately they matter.
@guardian Wasn't aware they stalled? Two weeks ago there was an update from Sec of State. We just had elections.		Quit running interference for a political party in a different country... one that doesn't care about you, at that.
@thehill Because Rosenstein... is... in charge... of the Mueller Investigation. Sessions didn't matter for crap.
@Commentator_PL @NBCNews Pointing out that @Acosta is an idiot is like arguing if water is wet. He likely does most of what he does on purpose, but sure acts like one.
@FT Good! Our infrastructure sucks on a national level, if compared to other countries. 		Go fight for Health Care when you figure out how to make it work... rebuild our roads and water supply first.
@ABCPolitics If they voted Democrat, it'd go to show why my tribe never liked them. If they voted Republican, same thing.
@Newsweek Because she knew the Senate will aquit.		This has always just been a con against Democrat voters.
@bryanistheway @thehill Google is your friend. https://t.co/C7N0lrxR5N
@thehill ... why? Sessions was recused, Rosenstein is still in charge of the investigation. 		This is called "False Flag."
@NBCNews But Daddy!! JUST ONE MORE (question)!! https://t.co/QlZjdSuFfS
@NBCNews Yeah... assaulting a woman is okay. He just wanted to ask ONE MORE QUESTION. Like always. He just has ONE MORE.
The Boy Scouts of America, and organization that is literally part of American history... has no right to the words "Scouts" or "Scouting?"		Get lucid. https://t.co/LatZlyAgee
@CBSNews Seriously?
@thehill Okay? They will aquit him in the Senate. Stop barking, you have no bite.
@CNN One of them is over 150 years old... good luck?
@OfficeOfMike @Acosta https://t.co/xdGJzfrFoC
@McdouglasAlex @KamalaHarris Correct. Once aquitted by the  Senate the impeachment is overturned, just as with a criminal trial. 		The same thing happened to Hamilton.
@McdouglasAlex @KamalaHarris Impeachment requires the Senate. https://t.co/ti8m756nwc
@AndrewFeinberg @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov That... isn't a lie? Where is the lie in that. That's your Opinion.
@freedom_moates @StormyDaniels Nah, Johnny "Avenatti" Sins is already taking their newest movies.
@KamalaHarris Mostly because that, while Democrats won the house... they forgot they had Senate seats up as well, and lost them? And without those you cant impeach or demand a grand jury?
@WithWithoutPot @cnni @CNNOpinion Beat me by one minute.
@RealTomSongs @11thHour @MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @HouseDemocrats You can't without the Senate.
@11thHour @MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance He resigned.
@freedom_moates If we're lucky he will eventually over turn the ACA... it ruined our health insurance.
@Reuters Welllllll....
@thebradfordfile @OfficeOfMike https://t.co/xdGJzfrFoC

@YellowJrnl Acosta should have been removed the first time he began screaming at the administration. 		https://t.co/4gz8lXZAWa
Freedom of the Press does not equate the ability to go anywhere, when ever you please. It does not equate the ability to act however you plese.		You can be removed.		 Remember that going forward.
@RealJamesWoods Does anyone remember Obama throwing out journalists? Having a documentary journalist arrested for saying things he didn't like?		Christ.
@MSNBC Jim Acosta would like to think it is. He's acted like a spoiled brat for two years.
@NBCNews Its... RIGHT THERE IN THE VIDEO. He kept shrugging that girl away from him.
@thehill His press pass should have been pulled a year ago.
@WheyCooler @fortismind @Reuters I presume he has nothing, which is why it has taken two years - and he waited until after the election to present results he apparently already has. Beyond the known finance crimes, I doubt anything will be made clearer.
@fortismind @Reuters Most of us just want it to end already, not so much be shut down, unless Mueller doesn't deliver..	 And soon.
@Reuters It's his Att General. He can do what he wants. Even with them having the house they can't impeach.
@AaronWorthing @raysawhill "Small. Rural populations."		It astounds me how absolutely full of shit Leftists are in their own heads, being convinced nobody lives outside of huge, packed cities.
@martinjboyle @BBCWorld It really is a misconception, however. Nearly half of the country lives scattered in those huge blocks. The various states have varied numbers of reps and senators based on exactly that, density, due to that reason.
@all_saying @BBCWorld On that part, there may be something. We will just have to watch, however, as finance violations are rarely taken to prosecution.
@HuffPost Mostly because the Blue Wave became a splash. None of the committee chairs lost their seats in the House, and the Democrats lost MORE of the Senate.
@the_takingpictu @Newsweek In order to win Texas they cannot support any changes to Gun Rights or Land Ownership. Unfortunately all Democrats right now do support it.		When Beto first started out I consideres voting for him, until he shifted Left. To get in the door they need a more Centrist Dem.
@all_saying @BBCWorld I robbed a bank. 		Same weight, as far as the law is concerned, and by the above logic I am guilty.		It will be twisted that way if Mueller doesn't find a crime.
@all_saying @BBCWorld Indeed, however there has to be a crime found by Mueller that Trump tried to obstruct the execution of justice in. Until Muellers report there isn't any room to do much beyond speculate.
For those confused by my feed - I am a Social Liberal, Constitutional Conservative. If these two together don't make sense, feel free to message me and we can talk about it.
@mericanViolence @all_saying @BBCWorld This is also very true. It will be entertaining at the very least in the months to come.
@10holte @thehill They do indeed, however it is the media who will only talk about the fact that he is gay, and nothing else. It will lead many to think it was the only reason he was elected.
@all_saying @BBCWorld The senate is also needed to create law, or require a grand jury. The house oversight committees are indeed powerful, but require senate permission to act. The senate is the checks and balances of the house.
@Reuters Told you. 8 months ago.
@thehill Congrats to him! Let's hope he's good at the job, or half the country will use the only thing about him that you keep pointing out as a weapon.
I am surprised at how much the Left is celebrating today. They managed to win the house, expending all their effort and money to do so...		And lost more of the Senate, something they need to actually accomplish anything.
@BBCWorld Isn't that map amazing? Two thin lines equate more power in the house than the entire rest of the country.		Which is why the Senate holds vastly more power.
@Newsweek It also proves that Democrats forgot that the House is nice to have, but to pass law or demand a grand jury you need the Senate... which they lost seats in.
@TheEconomist And lost even more of the Senate... which they need to actually DO anything. The House talks, the Senate makes law.
@1979FTF @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Never. They will never take it seriously. Just letting you know.
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi This woman is awesome, and I hope she keeps her seat forever. Mostly because she exists as a reminder of why to #WalkAway .
@MalorySailor @Independent Because Leftists have absolutely no concept of reality.
@Independent Which is great, since the Borat character was racist as hell.
@HuffPost And the first mentally handicapped person in Congress. It's a historical day.
@axios They start trying to push things through the Senate... and fail.
@MarkDice Is it bad that I called his loss five months ago?
@thehill You need Senate approval for damned near everything. Good luck!
@nprpolitics Shocker.  She could shoot someone in the face, blame the gun and Trump, and her voters would still vote for her.
@thehill Welcome to that Blue Wave.
@NBCNews How's that wave going?
When all is said and done, remember that no one listened to me.
@seanhannity Wait... wasn't Indiana at a 72% chance to stay Blue? So sayeth NBC
@alissa914 @business @bopinion You see? And you originally thought that we wouldn't agree on things.
@alissa914 @business @bopinion Conservatives - adhering to the Constitution, and the upholding of such. 		All it means. Progressives want to change it, Conservatives don't.
@bx_eddie @business @bopinion How cute.
@business @bopinion Glad that Leftists think history is all garbage... they never learn from it, while the rest of us ACTUALLY move forward.
@thehill User Error.
Is everyone ready? The backlash from today is going to be interesting, to say the least.
@axios Welcome to God saying #WalkAway
@fortismind @guardian You must not pay much attention to Democrats.
@guardian It's just the House. They can stall things, but the Senate can override.
The error of their ways? The actions of Democrats these past two years made me #WalkAway. I think not. https://t.co/Ne7FbN54Os
@OfficeOfMike Because corrupt politicians are the ones more readily willing to lie to them about reality, and construct narratives to replace it.
@AP The AP is showing their renowned Unbiased-ness again.
@NPR You left out... a lot. Such as new agreements with those 8 nations.
@ezraklein Well... thank you Obama for making Identity Politics the mainstay of the country?
@thehill Can you say: "Read what you sign?"
@LRevenge15 @teapot_russells @TheEconomist Were you aware they hid over 20,000 water bottles, 12 tons of food, and more? They left them on the runway, and claimed he never sent them.
@LRevenge15 @teapot_russells @TheEconomist I have more. Many many more.
@charliekirk11 https://t.co/7Vvft4VwNu
Has anyone ever explained this?:		If Gender does not matter... what, exactly, does being LGBT mean? All four require gender designation.
@DavidWohl The funny thing is that the AP came out 11 years ago claiming 97% of all journalist are Democrats... and yet the Left will shriek they are unbiased.
@abbydphillip "For decades presidents have held rallies on the Tarmac of AF1."		Did you read the article, or only their title?
@LRevenge15 @teapot_russells @TheEconomist Hmm? https://t.co/10uyrpfJGa
@Zdvin @csmatteson @dcexaminer Oh? Show me the judgment on mine. Not criticism... judgement.
@NBCPolitics It's odd that Ramussen and others disagree so readily with NBC polls... especially because NBC uses them when they have numbers they like.
@USATODAY Say it with me: The FDA does not care about you.
@teapot_russells @TheEconomist They blamed Hurricanes on this administration. Don't expect logic in the upcoming days.
@business How DARE things be running smoothly. Here are 50 reasons it MIGHT not run smoothly tomorrow.
@thehill Neat. He hung up. I do that daily, mostly on calls about my articles.
@Zdvin @csmatteson @dcexaminer Check mine. Though I will, now, say the same as he did.
@abbydphillip People who've never read the book they are citing are attempting to make a drunken point.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe For once Joey said something intelligent. Screaming loses people from your cause faster than it gains them.
@BenHowe As a man who broke his neck (minor at C7)  and has been having to rebuild his arms and shoulders for eight months... I feel your pain.
@RepSwalwell https://t.co/5Fh78sX4Dv		This fake poll? I have more.
@Sanvers_TV @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews I've signed my checks as Mickey Mouse for two years waiting for someone to notice... if you think they are going to individually verify every signature...
@RealPLUTim @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews https://t.co/8TbaBMGl6w
@RealPLUTim @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews There is page after page after page of instructions on how to make mail from previous residents stop. Half of them don't work, or are temporary. 		If you don't get previous mail, congrats. You're rare.
@ungerbn103 @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews I don't watch Fox? Also didnt vote for Trump. Insults don't work on me.
@thehill If that seemed twisted. It was. Sorta like the stupid damned thing that was said in this tweet.
@thehill So... some lunatics think he supports them, despite openly calling Duke an idiot in the 90s, the KKK evil in the 80s, and winning 2 awards for supporting the black community... that he is helping them, just because the lunatics thinks he supports them?
@FoxNews Rather like Obama giving speeches, yeah?
@ungerbn103 @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews A county in California, this year, has a 116% registration vs population. Do you really believe what you just said?
@thehill Those... two things are utterly unrelated. Then again, this is @thehill we are talking about.
@RealPLUTim @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Less than 11% of people who move file a change of address form in their state of origin. While they have a tendency to file in the state of arrival, it takes up to 3 years.
@limenaz @RealPLUTim @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews So glad you could contribute that drivel.
@guardian Standing inside the caldera of an extinction level event isn't worth my life, either. Doubt I'd have been in Yosemite.
@RealPLUTim @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews If 100,000 people around the Portland area know one person who has moved this year (not hard, considering their population falloff) you essentially double your voting power.
@VoteDarlene Did you really just compare those two extremely different circumstances with a straight face?
@charliekirk11 Because feelings!
@thehill Six months ago he was cheering for Johnny "Avenatti" Sins. Literally. On stage.
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Yep. I sent in my 20,000 mailed in ballots last week by checking the mailboxes of people who have moved out of state.		That's how good that idea is.
@HoracioRoyce @SteveOtto817 @persistentpengn Can we mention that a large part of their group are Hispanic and black?
@axios We can't afford to buy houses. We can't afford new cars. Most of the past two generations can afford rent, bills and groceries and nothing else.
@Newsweek Only if Newsweek and CNN are lucky.
@AMERICA4GOD @CoreyVersho @charliekirk11 ... yes.
@realbillm @JohnAvlon @TinaMorphis @jaketapper @CNNSotu Hey, you seem like a smart guy. Want to buy a bridge?
@washingtonpost For those shrieking: "WHY?!?!?!?!" Despite condemning him for the sanctions anyway... the Sanctions on Iran concerning oil hurt a few other nations as well. This will allow them to stock up for the long haul.
@HuffPost Tell me this. Beto was able to drive all across Texas and meet people on his original salary. Now he has raised millions. What does he need the millions for? He was already campaigning. 		Answer? "I don't take corporate money... but still becoming a millionaire."
@nytimes And take these three kids outside and beat them with large sticks until they can't walk.		Racism is, in fact, rare. When it ACTUALLY raises it's head, like this, stomp on it. Hard.
@thehill The definition of Gender isn't being narrowed? We have a dictionary. 		Also - would you ask a physicist to fix your sink? No. He doesn't know how to handle Male and Female pipe fittings.
@LuciferSam37 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Now you're getting it.
@SenJeffMerkley Which is a poem. Just a poem. That was added later.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump How about we just don't let them cross at all, and have them declare asylum in Mexico?
@Libbrexit @SRuhle @MSNBC Better
@SpeakerRyan I'm getting a lot of Leftist likes to this... wondering if they realize I am saying Obama screwed us.
@SpeakerRyan How about reversing the Restructuring of TriCare, our medical and mental insurance, that Obama performed for the ACA? We aren't covered for jack any more.
@arXiv6174 @thehill 1 KKK leader supported Trump. 14 supported Hillary.		Quack quack.
@thehill Wait. There are racists who support Trump, and therefore Trump is giving them cover. 		There was a KKK grand dragon that chaired the DNC until 2010!
@USATODAY The parts of the country the Left says doesn't even matter. Huh.
@Independent To be fair, I had never hears about it until it was on the News... then again I come from a state who's only history of raciam is because people call us racist merely due to geographic location.
@thehill You mean... wait... ACTUAL JUDICIAL PROCEDURE?
@mitchellreports "Norms." Just because they became standard over 8 years does not make them normal for most of us. This is why even on NBCs current counts Democrats are well behind.
@trefoil @FoxNews You've never seen a defensive encampment then.
@thehill The Leftist media called Dak Prescott a, and I quote, "Lemonade serving negro." 		Who protects racists?
@thehill Didn't Abrams call her opponent a "Piece of Sh**" and worse? Openly. On TV.
@CNN Hey, Oprah, how is that college you opened?
@cnni Their... entire... board and HR staff are female or LGBTQ. The entire thing. A guy was fired last year for pointing that out. It was on CNN.
@freedom_moates ... ... ... I knew something felt off during my college years.
@marklevinshow Of course they don't. Racists often find patsies to say what they are thinking for them.
@Libbrexit @SRuhle @MSNBC That sounds like a terroristic threat. Also - xenophiles? Hear the word once and wantes to use it?
@BillOReilly https://t.co/Q3opitMuFd
@thehill In his wildest dreams he is.
@maddow I could have a Russian IP in under 10 seconds with the VPN on my phone.
@andrewklavan That pretty much sums it up. I've finally turned off the monitoring bot programs that track and cite sources for news programs for me. Mostlt because it stopped finding sources for most of them around Dec 2016
@ABCPolitics @AnneKFlaherty You're the ones constantly talking about it. You've been talking about immigration more than any other story since 2016.
@NBCNews @NBCAsianAmerica You mean Americans could make a difference?
Shortlist of Tools Discarded by The Left in 2018:		- Stormy Daniels	- Omarosa	- Christine Ford	- Peter Strzok	- James Comey	- John McCain		All "we will never let this go" stories.		Not discarded? 		- Illegals and their rights... mostly to vote.
@DanaPerino @dailybriefing I'm more of a cat person.
@NBCNews Yeah. Because Hawaiian culture should only be voted on by the white people who moved there and call themselves natives.		Especially since most natives of Hawaii are Conservative, and want this telescope.
@Venessa33617893 @Ahsiqa @En_vis_age @thewritesky @1EyeSmart1 @tedcruz @BetoORourke You're aware that Beto really did attempt to flee the scene due to driving drunk before, right?
@louredwoodnba @MSNBC @ChrisJansing https://t.co/1D1kNbwIBs
@MSNBC So unbiased!
@TheDemocrats Did you just say "grab your squad?"
@OfficeOfMike No. No, they do not see the difference.
@PlowPlot @TheDemocrats @justicedems @DemSocialists Both accept funding from individuals like Soros and others. Just because they skip the corporations and go straight to the billionaires doesn't mean much. It's the problem Beto is facing in Texas.
@AdamBaldwin Especially being as Democrats believe if you show up and have a kid the entire family gets citizenship.
@freedom_moates Actually, today it will be Pelosi. Give it six hours.
@freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump Because that's the oath we took. To DEFEND this country.
@freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump Ha!
@business But sadly the Federal Government now owns all mineral rights.
@PlowPlot @TheDemocrats Or Republicans. Holy crap.
@PlowPlot @TheDemocrats So... not Democrats?
@cnni Yes, but Rockwell actually had a POINT. Not a Narrative.
@sahilkapur Did you just say MS 13 lacks evidence for being afraid of?
@business Jesus. I know it's Halloween, but why are you posting ghouls this early in the day?
@CNNPolitics Dog food and Butter. Dangit.
@NBCNews Good for her? She's a middle schooler trapped in an adult body.
@NBCPolitics Could be because he's said he isn't with them since the 1980s?
@CNN @JohnAvlon @CNNOpinion Hey, what about the bombs? Supposedly HUGE story the media forgot in one day.		Seems Trump succeeded.
@RepFrenchHill Good idea, but too big a bite. Let's go for the first week in October, otherwise Halloween and the beginning of the Holiday Season will render it moot.
That's because Democrats support people due to "moral obligation." They then ditch them when they stop being useful.		How's Stormy Daniels or Christine Ford? https://t.co/ooqqszdti6
@thehill That's because Democrats support people due to "moral obligation." They then ditch them when they stop being useful.		How's Stormy Daniels or Christine Ford?
@ChrisMurphyCT This from a party that knowingly fundraises for predators and murderers.
@MSNBC Growing pressure to boot Cory Booker, too. Or did you not notice the ethics complaints?
@JoyAnnReid So ANYONE is allowed to come here and have children? You see, this is what you're failing to understand. From your view we must allow EVERYONE to cross the border... So they can have kids.
@MeetThePress There are less than 10,000 KKK members. There are less than 20,000 people who claim to be Neo Nazis.		More people attend the Super Bowl. Can we go back to ignoring them? They will go back to the woods.
@ThisWeekABC Betting they wont like what they find, like the old Transcript they managed to snag that showed he paid more than he had to
@michaeljknowles @UAHuntsville Right? We 6' 155lb guys are truly terrifying. Especially here in this part of Texas where I'm considered short and skinny.
@charliekirk11 An oldie but a goodie:		https://t.co/YSYJgSs8p4
@WSJ All you need to know about Baltimore being "Forgotten." https://t.co/wZDwqa503z
@WSJ Then... move. Nobody invited her here to Texas?
@TheDemocrats Step 4: Bring masks and baseball bats for the riots after we lose.
@CraycraftBrett @gallagher_linda @larryelder Yes, because sarcastic virtue signaling on Twitter also requires insurmountable courage.
@Independent He's a raving moron who had to move to America so people would listen to him, due entirely to his accent?
@thehill Your party advocates for the destruction of Isreal...
@larryelder @jimmyfallon @jimmykimmel @SarahKSilverman But they are Leftist Comedians. Anything they say or do is 'okay.'
@OtagOnline @AndreMills_ @NBCNews A winchester 300 magnum hunting rifle, 5 rnd clip, will kill 5 people without fail. Magazine size and pistol grips don't matter.
@OtagOnline @AndreMills_ @NBCNews Florida he used a pistol. He had an AR 15 that was never fired. The same with Pulse.		Rifles ARE used, but against unarmed people a pistol is just as deadly. Either you ban ALL guns, or you drop the entire idea. Fully automatic rifles ARE already banned.
@OtagOnline @AndreMills_ @NBCNews Pew Pew pistols are what are used in almost every mass shooting. Pistols equate nearly 87% of all gun killings. You are chasing your tail, because your initial answer is wrong.
@RoKhanna How about paying attention to the fact that you belong to a party which openly advocates for the destruction of Free Speech and Freedom of Religion. Then get back to be about the "Rise of Authoritarianism."
@CooganDonny @Johnny_Congress It's great how quick they tried to shut him down.
@RepJerryNadler It's amazing to me how Democrats will perpetuate hate, and then condemn it when it expresses itself.
@OtagOnline @AndreMills_ @NBCNews I liked America when gun ownership wasn't demonized, and we had no mass shootings.
@NBCNews Then what is the answer? Criminals will still have guns if you ban guns, that's the point of a criminal.
@ABCPolitics @matthewjdowd Pass.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog No... shit? A president nominating judges due to political leanings? ALERT THE PRESS!! Back in 1920 when it started.
@RepGraceMeng Then tell the other Democrats to stop spewing hatred for Israel?
@MeetThePress @amyewalter For once something intelligent. The "Two Party" system does not exist in this country, but they are the only parties people will pay attention to... despite the fact that since WWII they've done nothing for the people, and only amass power for themselves.
@Newsweek They stood a good chance last year. Over this year they threw caution to the wind, went for broke, and went belly up due to being caught in too many massive lies.
@business @bopinion California also has the biggest debt of any state. California also costs tax payers the most money, by a large margin.		Why don't you ever include these numbers?
@ImGraceBowers @CNNPolitics Democrats are exceptionally bad at lying but do it often, and horrible at governing. Eventually you people will realize there are independents.
@CNNPolitics It's weird how Leftist Fact Checking works. Politifact has been found to be blatantly wrong almost daily, Snooes is two liberals and a cat, and your record @CNN is over 400 mistruths a day.
@politico No. Probably. Maybe. Definitely. Yep. Not a chance in hell.
@DJBurn77 @thehill @realDonaldTrump If only we weren't divided long before he entered office.
@axios Good. GOOD. Someone look up the history of that organization, and tell me why we allow it to self manage with no oversight.
@HuffPost And your tax bracket skyrockets, no matter what, after they tax well over 50% of the money. After this the fees leave you with around 180M. Assuming you win alone, as could be seen when over 1200 people won a powerball, netting them a few grand each.
@codeAfficionado @rasmusoxenvad @HuffPost Because that's how Leftists work.
@cnni Shoot on sight. That covers both.
@guardian The fact this is news to the @guardian says all you need to know.
@RepBeatty @NationalVMM How about homes and benefits?
@MattWalshBlog No such thing any more, Matt. They will twist this how ever they can, and you should know that.		What happens next Thursday will be worse.
@BenHowe Well, no one claimed Alex has ever been right. Well, not fair, he was right fairly often when he got his start 15 years ago.
@benshapiro Because Trump was removed from some phones as an Understood Term a few weeks ago in a patch?
@VoteDarlene @thehill Darlene, you must be new to Leftist outlets as opposed to Liberal outlets.
@thehill Hipster glasses and a terrified ritus... huh.
@Henrik_Palmgren @raysawhill That is an evil damned smile
@business 6 billion in funding to immigrants who shouldn't be here. Really?
@ThisWeekABC Odd. Does he know a KKK Grand Wizard was the chairman of his party? In 2010.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni God made me a murderer, but has blessed me. I am certain God can bless any who commit any Sin
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni God also told us that we are not the judges of others. Who are we to say one Sin is greater than another?
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni No no... being gay is not blessed... but a gay man can be blessed.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni I am not trying to Manipulate. God gave us minds to use, and voices to speak. We can disagree on what we read. Our faith will save us both, and we can argue in New Jerusalem.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni All men are cursed. Our only salvation is through God.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni The Sin is not the problem. The lack of repentance, and acceptance that you are not worthy in God's eyes... is the problem. All men Sin from birth. All men. No Sin is greater than another.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni That... we can agree on.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni Indeed! Murder is Cursed, but God blessed David. Adultery is cursed, but God blessed Abraham. Drunkenness is curses, but God blessed Ezekiel.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni I am wondering if YOU understand what I am saying .
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni Having your toilet 1000 cubits from your home is also cursed.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni Then I direct you to Kings 1 and Judges. Both a King of God, and a Judge, were openly homosexual. God blessed them with authority and power.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni In Fact Darius had males in his harem.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni Homosexual relations between females are legal in Kuwait, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but homosexual acts between males are illegal.		Until the 8th century, and the the 11th, homosexuality was not seen as evil by Islam.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni I do read it. Daily. David was a murderer, Saul commited suicide... drunks, adulterers, gays and slanderers... all served God.
@hektoroftroy2 @cnni Elisha was gay, and blessed. God blesses those who do his works, without exception.
@cnni I'd assume it was the billions of dollars, but hey, yeah... being Gay is all that matters about you. I guess? I figured it was your enormous intelligence, but identity politics and all.
@Independent Too bad? You have specialized wants, they have certain menus.
@Newsweek Probably because she isn't running for office?
@MicheleB1010 @thehill Well, no. Statistical trend data of over 1,100 polls and surveys.
@thehill Neat. Isn't it supporting the patriarchy to declare a man Woman of the Year? Just curious.
@Snapzz7 @politico Loses*
@politico So... modern politics?
@MicheleB1010 @thehill If half the country supports him... who are the people? In fact, the number is drawing to 60% being as Centrists and Libertarians are starting to back him.
@thehill Good for them.  Stop calling half the country stupid, perhaps?
@CoryBooker Did Cory just actually support something important? That's a first.
@AAUWActionFund @RepLindaSanchez Except in the 1950s and 1960s. When Democrats voted for Jim Crowe and Segregation.
@bijancbayne @Toure @DineshDSouza Who brainwashed you to think a bunch of millionaire white people care about you, even after decades of turning once beautiful cities into ghettos?
@Toure It's funny how much you hate minorities who disagree with you.
@CillizzaCNN Good thing two thin strips think they should rule the rest.
Johnny "Michael Avenatti" Sins is only news because you people keep giving him a platform. Cut it out. https://t.co/a2fv8oApjE
@FoxNews Johnny "Michael Avenatti" Sins is only news because you people keep giving him a platform. Cut it out.
@RepRoKhanna Good luck. Like all Leftist organizations, they are only PUBLICLY outraged. They will still happily accept funds behind closed doors.
@HuffPost That's almost as bad as using a private server to get military people murdered... oh that was #HilarityClinton.		Or as bad as letting one drive you for 20 years, listening in on your calls... oh that was Feinstein.
@USATODAY Endless, 24/7 prodding. Insulting half the country daily. Pushing for protests and riots.		Nah. Not yalls fault at all.
@HuffPost It's amazing this happens days before the election, had no chance of exploding, and none of these people were anywhere near where they were delivered.		Why not a DNC rally or public event? Too many questions.
@CillizzaCNN Says the CNN reporter.
@mviser @KatyTurNBC Since... when... are reporters political pundits?
@LoisJohnson11 @thehill Quite certain they will... and they will win. Civil Funding is a question of executive power in such matters.
@maddow @RalstonReports God Bless Rachel Maddow for being SUCH an unpartisan reporter of the news.
@bahiawilson @thehill Oh? How's your tone been?
@NBCPolitics I'm sure they understand. They don't CARE.
@guardian Oh, yeah. It was Trump. Days before the election, and zero of the targets were in any danger?
@thehill Slow down the endless hatred, then? People can only deal with so much before it becomes violent.
@AaronBlake Yeah, because of 11 targets one was CNN. When are Leftist Journalists going to understand that they are not actually part of politics?
@Evertranquil1 @NBCNews They want this. This is good ratings.
@NBCNews Wait... George Soros, #HilarityClinton and Obama are members of the media? You guys are listed last for a reason.
@keithboykin @JoeNBC Body slamming a jackass reporter isn't political violence.
@triumphantchris @thehill Considering he's just the judge of Seattle's district?  We will see.
Part of it. And whats WEIRD is that it's a Seattle Federal court. Seattle was getting it's funding removed.		Huh. https://t.co/m2wODus8nH
@thehill Part of it. And whats WEIRD is that it's a Seattle Federal court. Seattle was getting it's funding removed.		Huh.
@cnni @gaylelemmon @CNNOpinion Is their outrage accomplishing anything? Let me know when it starts to.
@Independent And she was already down. They do it to white people, too. Not sure what her being black has to do with it. 		They will be suspended on assault charges and fired.
@tommycanyou @abbydphillip Better, at least.
@tommycanyou @abbydphillip Good luck with that. This Bot is from Texas and armed.
@SuzanneKelleher @AaronBlake @VanJones68 @CNN Well, Aaron here works for WaPo... so, yes, it's the best CNN can do.
@AaronBlake You people need to grow up. Either he is too weak, or he is starting WWIII... generally in the same week, dealing with the same country
Yet... you believe the world is fine. That we are raising our children well, and that some how this is all the fault of one group of people in the world? 		The rise of the Left is the fault of the right. Let's be honest with ourselves. It's the only way to start fixing it.	(3/3)
- Virtue is now a privilege, Morality is  archaic.	- Life is not sacred, it is merely sensory perception. 	- Regurgitation is now intelligence, free thought is an anomaly.	- The states with the most violence and crime are the most enlightened.	(2/3)
- Fully grown women call their significant other Daddy.	- Being a Man is toxic, being a Boy is healthy.	- Laws a cruel, except laws that take from people.	- Politicians are now Leaders, not Representatives, of their people.	(1/3)
@Newsweek Lunatic Bill... is right for once.
@agcia87 @swettjc @ABC https://t.co/UoQzrJtI3k
@thehill Good idea! Let's go to 5$ a gallon because someone killed a Journalist.
@marklevinshow The fact that you are surprised, @marklevinshow, of the level of depravity in which Leftist outlets have fallen... really worries me. The Left is no longer shocking to me. There again, my Degree is in Evolutionary Psychology. 		They will get worse.
@CogitabundSLH @AlisonPeterson @charliekirk11 I was living in Laurel, MD for quite some time - back when D.C. cared to hire we sociologists - and will admit I found the previous Governor quite hilarious.
@swettjc @ABC You're aware that half of Europe brought this up first, yeah? It wasn't Trump's idea.
@axios But... but @MSNBC and @CNN have been whining that #Hollywood is suffering.
@ABC Britain did. Start doing your jobs. 		https://t.co/UoQzrJtI3k
@CNNPolitics "Absentee Ballots." Look that up, and imagine why a state would ignore them.
Now mention even Liberal Britain agrees with Trump. 		https://t.co/UoQzrJtI3k https://t.co/5ga5iC4ovo
@NBCNews Now mention that Poland, and even Liberal Britain, agree with Trump.
@CogitabundSLH @AlisonPeterson @charliekirk11 LA stretchig up the west coast. The right 2/3 of the state is conservatives and liberals of varying degrees, but no where near the skew of the Democrats.
@MMMcG03 @foxnewspolitics I have. I want to see your definition.
@DeniseGundelfi1 @foxnewspolitics He it on live TV.
@MMMcG03 @foxnewspolitics Define assault weapons.
@foxnewspolitics Yeah, but he also admitted he wanted to Ban Guns. Here in Texas. His political prospects are over.
@NBCNews Run at me, or any free human being, with a camera crew and start spouting horrible, insulting, and wholly uncalled for crap into my face. It should end the same way. 		Stop acting as if you are an elite class of people with no repercussions.
@washingtonpost Because you people keep posting blatant lies about them, masked as "opinions."
@thehill Considering the damage our Media does to foreign relations... I wonder why.
@cnni Sounds like a school run by Democrats. You should be proud.
@FoxNews My mother would have just hit me... not even with the belt, probably the car.
@Independent The Boreal Forest? Which that is not.... in fact it's fine.
@politico To be fair... the Income Tax was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court... so Congress called an Emergency Session over the Christmas Holiday and forced a vote with most of Congress not even there.		Soooo...
@raysawhill They are individual. Units.
@thehill I like how Democrats still pound the pavement of the Cities and fail to realize most of the country is rural. Same way Hillary lost.

@thehill Why does this stuff only happen in Liberal Haven States? It's never those "racist conservative states." Same with all the shootings.
@thehill That's just funny though. This is the proper type of vandalism. Take notes and stop destroying property.

@martuk56 @TomFitton @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas Ever notified they have voted. Being as counties only record their OWN votes, they can claim ignorance. It is impossible to discover which pollster allowed people to vote without ID. 		Therefore. Start in the clerk's office.
@martuk56 @TomFitton @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas That's actually quite easy. Democrat county registrars purposely keep individual profiles as Residents. Even after they move away, or die. 		These are publicly available records. You compare them to active census data, and cast votes for those who are "residents," and no one is..
@business No one, and no one should. They made the right decision of simply removing the mildly unstable genius from the Chair position and making him a board member. 		He is still in charge of his company.

@emzanotti What confuses ME is that they want Gay Rights and Women's Rights... but if Gender has no meaning, then neither do the previous two.
@thehill @FLOTUS Why you people cannot understand that a wife is a wife at any level of society astounds me... there again Leftists worship the Elite and Monarchs, so they have a ridiculous view of familial life at the upper echelons of society.

@thehill That affects him now that he is no longer a Lawyer... not at all.
@jooblee @WestSilent @HuffPost That's equality, alright. The equal ability for buffoonery.
@Gigasrex Voting for Hillary was, from a Christian view, far far worse than Trump. Merely because the original candidate you wanted to win did not, doesn't mean you now go sit at home and fret after the primaries.
@Gigasrex Many did, in fact, and voted for Paul or Cruz. Once the primaries were decided, and, many even Sanders voters,  they found themselves faced with Trump or Clinton, they chose Trump.
@jooblee @WestSilent @HuffPost Guessing you have no idea what Nationalism means. How strong and independent of you, to ignore word meanings in place of trendy vernacular spoon fed to you by... men.

Because women are nothing more to Democrats than political tools to achieve their goals.
That Republicans hate women. Once they confirm Kavanaugh they will say this shows how congress is under the thumb of Trump. Afterwards there will be a massive ad campaign by Democrats for November. They will use this instance to try to get the house back...
Hearing will take place. She will suddenly remember times, dates, and names. These names will either be unreachable or they will have already said they do not remember this.		The Media will condemn the committee for not finding these people. They will claim it is proof...
@ejpa @seungminkim It will be treated as such.
@AnnCoulter Especially an accusation that is as vague as a horoscope. The story could be applied to any man, or woman, and if we are to accept the Leftist Precedent here... every man and woman in the nation is "credibly a rapist."
@AdamBaldwin God I love you, Jane. Always will.
@OfficeOfMike ALSO BREAKING: The left has now swapped to claiming Republicans are mean bullies... because they gave her what she wanted.
@kenolin1 Stop saying "credible accusation." Makes you look more like a scripted liar.
@AdamBaldwin No. Bullying someone who can't even remember if it was a rape attempt, or where and when it happened. Or who was there. Actually, eveyone she said was there has called her a liar.
@andrewklavan @jack @RealJamesWoods Explains why I hadn't seen James lately. What'd they lock his account for? Being a Russian Bot? Makes sense.		While we're here, have them unban my public interest account lol. If he said "get a job and you won't worry about welfare reform," I think I know why he was banned.
@seungminkim Sadly the Polygraph, and the Trauma Experts, cannot be admissible in court - and thus wont be accepted by the committee. Neither are actual objective evidence. At most they can attest that she is convincing.
@AdamBaldwin My default position is to believe people who show themselves to be truthful, and all others can piss off... could be why I don't trust people like @peterdaou

@ChandlerGeorge8 @MattWalshBlog Precisely. She doesn't even remember the year. How she got there, the day, the time of day, the general location, who else was there, or any other basic details.
@michaeljknowles Their logic escapes me. They hold a man up on a pedestal that supports pedophilia being legal. RBG said legal age should be 12. 		But IF THIS GUY groped a girl in high school. If. Then we must destroy his life. Even if he didn't, destroy it anyway.
"He is ruining MY COUNTRY."		It isn't yours. It is ours. That level of entitlement needs to stop.
@petron @ajaxsinger @CNNPolitics Possible.	Mostly true (they run initial background checks. They do not investigate sexual assault claims)	True - 2 new mills. 4 reopened.		Perhaps you should understand the difference in conflicting opinion and lies.
@MattWalshBlog As someone who knows a real victim of sexual assault  (and her support group she attends weekly)... they do not forget the location. The date. The day, the hour, the minute. They likely never will.		The woman is a liar, and should be condemned by #MeToo
@ajaxsinger @CNNPolitics Have you ever READ the WaPo Fact Sheet? 		"Trump cited statistics from the month before, and used them as if current statistics."	"Trump misrepresented wages at 16.50. The actual wages are 15.25."		Really? Lies?

@life_as_a_nomad @jaketapper @NewDay On that same logic, I can pay someone to testify that it is, in fact, Charles. This would mean it is true.
@therealdmdavies @jaketapper @NewDay Actually I've known who he was for over 15 years. His opinions have been used by the Supreme Court for longer.		Did you know his parents put hers in the poor house while they were in high school? His mother was the judge over a case involving her parents.		Lets go with evidence.
@pbfa @thehill Over 1000 'Yalies' fight weekly to block conservative speakers from campus, too. How about evidence?
@mhenson56 Yes... because everyone who claims assault is telling the truth. 		No, incidentally. In fact, statistically 87% of claims are found to be entirely unfounded. Which does nothing but make actual victims seem like liars. 		Did you know his family put hers in the poor house?
@Reuters And promptly ignored as having zero evidence, and timing this accusation flawlessly as an obstructionist tactic.
@therealdmdavies @jaketapper @NewDay He did? Magically, before his confirmation, one woman appears and says he tried to rape her.

@NBCPolitics A: Releasing classified information is a criminal offense. B: Releasing lies, in writing, to damage an individuals reputation is a criminal offense. C: Repeating statements made during briefings is a Criminal Offense (See: 1)
@politico Mostly because Obama was ACTUALLY a threat to Democracy?
Oh. Interesting little article here. Especially from an outlet that CONTINUES to try to say Trump is ruining America. https://t.co/RdXzsmpOEY
@thehill Sad! For you.
This country has more than two parties. This country is NOT a "for us or against us" nation. If you think these things, I know a few countries you would be at home in.
@FoxNews @BarackObama Right. Which is why you don't vote for Democrats.
@redsteeze https://t.co/4SxAUcka9f
@OfficeOfMike Well. He gave us a solid, rock bottom starting point.
@MattWalshBlog Got it in one.
@brendenweber_ @MattWalshBlog Actually - smoking and being high are both, in most states, not even illegal. Possession, however, and intent to sale, are.
@MattWalshBlog Actually, most are there for Intent to Sale, or Intent to Distribute. Granted they can charge you for this merely for having a plastic baggy with it, but that is the actual charge.
@damianjh @realDailyWire By 56 seconds.
@thehill Hitler disarmed his population. Hitler declared all communism as hate speech and hate crimes. Hitler demanded control of production, and a "fair" division of wealth.		Who's that sound like?

@redsteeze Opinion on "Settled Law?"		https://t.co/E4SGNYtkwN
@emzanotti Well... that is an education in its own right... assuming we are returning to Peter's days in Greece.
@CNNPolitics Only if it is an unlawful order.
@thehill Oh. What do you know. Turns out that just because the media says we should support something... doesn't mean we do.
@OfficeOfMike Anyone heard about Stormy? Is it me or did Avenatti use her to get on the news, and ditched her like a bad habit.		Shows how much Democrats really care about poor, used women.
@BenHowe @CoryBooker That is a shocker. Is anyone going to point out to Cory that he is also white?
@hillary3197 @GregAbbott_TX @abc13houston It was an honest question, you leftist brat.
@GregAbbott_TX @abc13houston Well Greg, thanks to some policies of an unnamed AG of Texas men in this state pay more in state fees and taxes than they do child support. Take some money from that.
@hillary3197 @GregAbbott_TX @abc13houston Our taxes have risen for 30 years. Teachers have been paid piss poor in this state since the 50s. Tell me... how long has Greg been governor?
@brithume For once I agree with @brithume
@Cernovich Mike... there is a pervasive sickness in the country now days called Identity Politics. It is, sadly, on both sides.
@BenHowe We are.
@thehill Welp. How about throw her in jail for assault?
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Most distinctions such as those are fundamentally arbitrary. The reason I choose state governing over federal is merely to provide more choices for the individual. That, like most things, is simply opinion however.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Of course. The ideal society, for me, is small collectives living apart from one other, governing themselves - with a body chosen over the land for the sole purpose of mediation between groups. Thereagain I was raised on a reservation.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Personally I think people should be allowed to do what ever the hell they like, as long as it doesn't hurt someone else. I'm a social liberal, however. I AM against abortion past the point of neurological activity, but that is a personal opinion and shouldn't be law.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews In an ideal world, YES! Unfortunately with a less-than-homogenous society, and the scale of the population, State government is about as small as one can go without reverting to a county system - which I am all for, but the realities of that aren't feasible.
Which is odd coming from a man who joked in 2013 about voting to remove term limits so Obama could be president for life. https://t.co/ZursKR8aOy
@hardball @SenBlumenthal Which is odd coming from a man who joked in 2013 about voting to remove term limits so Obama could be president for life.
@thehill Yeah. Worked well for Booker.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Example: Roe vs Wade. The people of Texas, by and large, are for abortion, but not past 20wks. This is different to those in California. Therefore, if each state can CHOOSE... as they historically could...
@realestchrispy @NBCNews It is a question of scale. It would, likely, be more accurate to describe myself as a Jefferonian.  If the states determine their own internal laws you, the individual, have 49 more options to live in a collective of similar beliefs and values. Federal rule negates this.
@OfficeOfMike He is more @MSNBC material. He isn't rich and white.
@DonaldTrumpSr4 @CNNPolitics Eh, Erik is a weaselly looking guy, to be sure.
@nprpolitics Grassleys office has been open 24/7 for records since the day the nomination was declared. The committee was given over 1 million documents (more than any other nomination in history.).		lets go with... they are liars.
@thehill No.
@larryelder Nike dropped the ad. Colin lost his job. Proof of how bad it is under Trump.
@benshapiro @benshapiro called it, and said it would happen yesterday. 		If only the Daily Wire had somewhere to actually write in as OpEds I wouldn't be stuck randomly throwing them at CNN... who has me listed as a Conservative Contributor so my stuff sits on the back burner.
@emzanotti Eh, Rand floats between Libertarian and Federalist fairly often, actually. Not a huge difference, but a notable one.
@DonaldTrumpSr4 @CNNPolitics His name was Fred. Donalds father, that is.
@CNNPolitics 5 reasons Leftist Media has been distracted from Kavanaugh...
@benshapiro You haven't realized that this entire time has been treated like a reality show?		- Omarosa goes rogue as Manafort declared guilty and Trump signs 2 executive orders.	- Cohen flips as Protests start... protests disappear.	- Kavanaugh coverage? OP-ED
@whitemalevoter @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC Because Leftist media is easily distracted by Drama. Omarosa unleashed her stuff RIGHT as Trump signed 2 executive orders and Manafort was declared guilty.
@MSNBC Mostly because he can forward an email without personally knowing who it is about? Why not report WHO it was forwarded to? Investigators
@RealRedWave https://t.co/VX23KWlSQu
@ezraklein For once we agree @ezraklein
@nprpolitics Booker released emails already approved for release. YAY!
@emzanotti Democrats are having their party splintered by Progressives. The Senators, who aren't up for election right now, are Grandstanding in the hopes of getting progressive votes before the party breaks in half.
@OfficeOfMike How dare you assume his age identity?
@washingtonpost Random intelligent statement by WaPo? Oh, it's an opinion piece.
RT @seungminkim: NEW statement from Bill Burck, GWB’s records representative who led the review of Kavanaugh’s records https://t.co/6MQSbgB…
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Never said I wasn't pro choice. I am, also, however pro states rights.
Always nice to see a political party splinter and fall apart. Once in a century event. Last time this happened it was The Wigs. https://t.co/lRx5RsK8cX
@dbongino It was brilliant, though. He released documents that just made Democrats look stupid. I vote we let him keep going.
@Speechless_PDG @thehill Same! Have a good day at work.
@Speechless_PDG @thehill Assuming you've never actually paid attention to facts.
@washingtonpost Yes. He is. Because Democrat senators are used to ignoring it when they want.
@SpeakerRyan Leftists don't care. They only care about getting their way. They burn the American flag, and scream about what is "good for America."
RT @RHinCHELSEA: @SourcesForCNN @thehill They deal in salacious headlines - knowing that the majority of their (intellectually lazy) follow…
@Speechless_PDG @thehill You are blindly taking the word of people. I am listening, looking at his past published opinions, and making my OWN decisions.
RT @RVA_dave: @SourcesForCNN @Speechless_PDG @thehill Stop with your damn facts and logic. That’s not Twitter works!
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Thus why even we Libertarians are against Roe vs Wade. Not because we want Abortion banned, but because it should be up to the states. If you don't like the laws in a state... move.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Because you've hit it on the head!  There isn't a single arguement. Which is why it should be up to the states, not the federal government. States of people who agree it is killing babies have their own rules, and vise versa.
@Speechless_PDG @thehill No. He flat out said factual statements. He gave zero indication that he would overturn the decision.
@TheDemocrats Nothing? Less fear mongering for @TheDemocrats ? You will just protest something else.
@BretBaier Eh. Because out of slanted propaganda, at least Fox is consistent.
@SeanKymalainen @brithume Nobody hid anything?

@thehill Which... even according to your own article... he did not express a willingness to overturn it?
@Independent Then go ahead. If it exists.
Thought it was a "top official?" Now it's an Aide? Pick one. https://t.co/RLDJFnQyD9
@Independent Thought it was a "top official?" Now it's an Aide? Pick one.
@nprpolitics Just admit it. You people just want people released if they have kids with them. Even when they kidnapprd the children.
@Newsweek None of the above. Simple. Trump had a speech writer write it. It uses the exact same turns of phrase as the writer for Pence and for the Inauguration.
@redsteeze https://t.co/E4SGNYtkwN
@redsteeze If Roe was settled law, 1/3 of the states wouldn't be sueing over it.
@OfficeOfMike Probably both. Progressives are shoving Democrats out of office, splintering their party. They are now grandstanding for votes.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Very true as well. Incidentally, in this "debate" Lefists have to attempt to make it about Women's bodies because when they tried the Fetus debate in the 70s they couldn't get women to support it.
@redsteeze If only. At least then a decent story would cross my desk from NYT that wasn't an obvious fabrication.
@Newsweek Welp. That was a stupid thing to say. He could have pointed out tha fewer women enter surgical fields, buuuuuut nope. Had to be sexist.
@JamileeD @TIME No. I'm suggesting Kavanaugh was the main media event and this is released. Omarosa began releasing her tapes when Manafort's Trial was on. Cohen "flipped" when...		It's been happening since 2016. Amounts to nothing but a media frenzy.
@bellocquotes @MattWalshBlog Mostly because the Church has a tendency to remain silent when she should be screaming... and screaming when she should be silent.
@washingtonpost Yep. Woodward. The WaPo journalist that managed to take down Nixon. Who ultimately tried to steal a tape.
@TIME It's odd... in fact the entire cabinet had statements ready to go. Almost as if they knew it was being released.
@CNNPolitics Well...
@guardian The Supreme Court, to Liberals, is an emergency arm of government to force new laws through. Of course they think Kavanaugh is the problem. He disagrees.
@CakedaddyINTL You think Dixiecrats and Democrats are different. You're told by your political party that you are too dumb to pass in school, too weak to represent yourself, and too ignorant to think for yourself... because of your race... and you think I'm stupid?
@kenolin1 Wait... old school Republicans had integrity? You democrats have called them all racists since the 60s. Pick a story, Kenny.
Lol... I'm telling you, @benshapiro, Trump had a speech writer write it. There is extensive evidence to support the fact he not only controlled this, but Omarosa, Woodward, and Cohen - so far. https://t.co/OOimsbIHnK
@benshapiro Lol... I'm telling you, @benshapiro, Trump had a speech writer write it. There is extensive evidence to support the fact he not only controlled this, but Omarosa, Woodward, and Cohen - so far.
@realestchrispy @NBCNews Yep. But honest.
@benshapiro I actually rather think @POTUS asked for it to be written. The ploy with Omarosa faded quickly, as did the play with Cohen.
@TomFitton @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Being as he likely approved it being written? Not likely.
@JRLHouston @NBCNews Especially since they received over 1 million pages within hours.
@NBCNews "Can you think of any laws that allow people to murder other people legally?"		Stop claiming this is about your body. Most of you nobody wants to sleep with anyway.
@TheresaPil @Gigasrex @Everytown @MomsDemand How about blame the actual murderers? The homes with no morals, no present parents, no standards?
@CBSNews Nike also dropped the ad. Sad!
@HuffPost Mostly because they don't have shit on him. He is an Originalist, Textualist judge who has pissed off Republicans and Democrats alike over the years.
@Newsweek Not what was said. Moving on.

@MSNBC https://t.co/QCK1Km7Ze5
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight Yeah. Progressives are taking their seats in the house. The senators are grandstanding for votes. Done.
@MattWalshBlog No, this is sedition.
Leftists 2016: "Morality and Civility are wrong, and part of white privilege."		Leftists 2017: "Trump is ammoral, corrupt, and completely lacks civility! Remove him!"		Leftists 2018: "Waaatghahsggdhshgdnznoeodugxbwooeifhimpeachurvwosufbeo."
@thehill Jesus Christ. Soon @thehill will be reporting that Nibiru is coming because @POTUS called the Anunaki during a tornado on Samhain.
@CBSNews He should stick to pudding.
@AshGoldsmithh Yes. Because 60 million do not speak for the other 300 million.

@lupaPadmae35 @ABCPolitics The full amount: https://t.co/XxDZRb4iUG
@lupaPadmae35 @ABCPolitics They released 42,000 MORE last night. They released 400,000 two months ago, to the Committee. The problem many democrat senators have is that they did not get copies... because they aren't on the Committee.
@NBCPolitics Where? Where in any of his writings has it even been alluded to? They are all public record. Has ANY of these senators quoted anything?
@emzanotti 18 hours ahead of you.
@RandPaul They should merely revert the funds back to the American People. However, let's be honest, congress has never cared where the money comes from.
@GOP @tedcruz Well... he's not wrong.
@lupaPadmae35 @ABCPolitics There were 480,000 documents given to the committee. What are you on about?
@ABCPolitics Could it be because his big problem, the problem Democrats have with him, is that he has repeatedly refused to rule on things that the Legislative branch should be handling?
@thehill Because he has said he does?
@DoraRoseRose @CNNPolitics @ChuckGrassley 480,000 documents were handed over. How was it not transparent?

@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR It requires a change of thinking that, such as our friend pointed out, started for Canada in the 60s. They have had time, as a society, to adjust.... our society relies to heavily on Insant Gratification.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR I think our friend is tired, and becoming combative. Seems he took offense to something he read wrong. Either way.		There are ways that we could, as I've said almost a dozen times, improve our system. The problem is that it will not happen instantly.
Why is it so hard for Democrats to understand that the people living in cities do not represent the totality of the American People? This misunderstanding that most who live in the countryside do so because we can afford to commute.
@MoozhanT @thehill Which is 80% of the totality of the landmass. Not our fault most of the population packed into cities like sardines.
@thehill Well... because there is an endless onslaught of news, 24/7, of hate against the guy. Incidentally his ratings ARE fairly high for this month.
@adeliakittrell @AnnCoulter You can't be Denied Citizenship if you are a citizen. This isn't about a denial of benefits.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR https://t.co/b4G3VwZ9u2		How about 30% of all medicare spending right now? Due to patient requests or demands.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR People, by and large, lack logic to the extremes .
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR The middle part of your paragraph screams of naivete. Are you aware of the countless, endless lawsuits that will begin immediately? The government will have to cover them. You keep missing the point that I agree with the end goal, but not with the time frame.
@paulkrugman Is he aware healthcare was MORE affordable before the ACA? My coverage went from 200 a month to over 900 a month just for my insurance.
@thehill And these are the people the Left want in charge of their medical care, schools, and even food?
@AnnCoulter Which means more benefits available to actual citizens... and, yet, somehow the Left will spit hatred about this.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR With the doctor unable to say No. A Right means the doctor cannot say no, even if your request is outlandish or outside their field, or they feel they cannot do it.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR Indeed! You have a right to life... which Democrats ignore in the abortion debate... however you do not have a right to demand that others keep you alive, even when you make mistakes. It becomes slavery when you can walk into a doctors office and demand treatment.
Ever notice that Leftist outlets just keep giving this man a platform? Almost like they have a motive. https://t.co/o4JoVB7GzU
@HuffPost Just going to keep posting this one... https://t.co/VTKjK7qXuL
@NBCNews Could be because most Labor Unions are terrible for the actual workers. Then again, most democrats get huge kick backs from unions, soooo hey.
@thehill I love how quickly Democrats use death as political tools.
@FoxNews @nedryun Our education system is an abject failure on a counts, let alone covering socialism.
If no one has noticed... our education system is an abject failure all around. https://t.co/aBvwSwFPGF
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR This is where the argument becomes a bit... legalistic. To deem something a Right means that there can be no denial of it. There is a cultural difference in Americans and Canadians that will turn from Right to Slavery quickly. The slavery of contractors and doctors.
@raysawhill Illegal immigrants are near free labor. Why Democrats want them here, but do not fight for their citizenship.
Glad to see I'm not the only one who sees that Leftists are the first to throw stones... and the first to claim the stone hurt their hand. https://t.co/HSlmcKJ4vK
@michaeljknowles Meh. https://t.co/w0FTlnkTQc
@thehill Unions tend to do more harm to workers than good.
@RobbyCab @michaeljknowles @SikhProf @jack @yaf Says the WHITE BOY.
@michaeljknowles They do it to me, too, and I'm red. Didn't know I had privilege, especially since they like to whine about MY land being taken.
@michaeljknowles I am confused how many of my peers graduated beside me that, apparently, learned absolutely nothing.
@darby_wendy @captainpearson @NPR Because it needs a full rework from the ground up, which I support. Until that, I do not support scaling up what we have.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR Which, I  agree with you. I disagree with the Leftist "plan" for it, but I agree that housing and health care are not RIGHTS... but they are the right things to provide everyone.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR The main issue is that it is hard to sell something that people but billions in with taxes, in fact Medicare tax is separate from Income Tax... but the system is terrible. The government has promised fixes for almost 40 years but never actually changes it.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR Oddly, the average citizen tends to want to support their neighbors quite a lot, especially in the south and the bible belt. Most towns and counties have many assistance programs for all forms of expenses and chairty.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR Read my other reply.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR Actual single payer is a pipe dream that will murder many people until we actually can manage the few tens of millions we already try to care for, if we just scale it up... which is what the left continues to argue for.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR THAT is the correct answer the Left should be looking for, but aren't. It is easy to qualify, in any state, for Medicare if you cannot afford care. It's free, but gives garbage results - that should be fixed.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR The Government of the United States is terrible with health care management. The VA proves this. The current Medicare system proves this. Forcing it on 300 million people will result in a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in very poor care.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR The definition that I use for this arguement ud the same arguement that has been proven, time and again, by the current medicare system of the USA. Doctors are unable to discuss pricing with Medicare, and as such do not perform certain tests, procedures etc. People already die.
@captainpearson @darby_wendy @NPR Correct! But not Universal Single Payer. There is a very big difference, one that would end with millions dead due to inept care in the USA.
@AdamBaldwin Because Putin spent all his money paying #HilarityClinton ?
@guardian That is the most idiotic headline I've ever seen from @guardian, opinion or not. That is saying a great deal.

@NBCNews Democrats don't believe in souls. Good news! The fight is already over?

@KyleLeitao @rabbitlover81 @NBCNews They have no desire to work on the root cause. Democrats exist merely to fight poverty, racism, bigotry, etc. They need these things to survive as a political party... therefore they perpetuate them.

@OfficeOfMike It's odd. When he ran against Obama he was a racist, sexist, lying homophobe that had a history of hating black people. Until he disgreed with Trump, of course.
@thehill He has? Odd. Most everyone I know has received pay raises. Weird.
@freedom_moates Same thing.
@CNN The fact that this is an outright lie, and the fact that this has NOTHING to do with the administration, and everything to do with @CNN getting its panties in a bunch because their PRR was denied... is sad.
@CatHammer2 @freedom_moates Hmm, we could follow the mountains and slice off Portland and Vancouver that way.
@otte6th @NoLongerBennett They will just remove the word Custodial, then quote you. It will look like this on @MSNBC:		"Government is... rapes we all do together."
@emzanotti It's been awhile since there was a Martin Luthur.
@emzanotti Historically the Church has always feared what books might say? It is due to an extremely limited understanding of the idea that God is infinite, and can be responsible for everything science finds.		That said, the Church has long needed an independent review of practice.

@J777EnriQ @Newsweek Showing Care does not often involve hurling racist remarks, threatening women with rape, children with dismemberment, etc... incidentally that is Leftists on Twitter, let alone anywhere else. Also - I'm not right wing.
@Orbital_Lexicon @copter_dave @Newsweek I understand them quite well. Much the way I understand when my dog has to go outside by him standing by the door making noise. There is a lot in common there.
@Orbital_Lexicon @copter_dave @Newsweek Ahhh... an imbecile. I understand now.
@ElJefeStewart @heidebur_justin @dmaliciouz @FoxNews Not sure how your point about Republicans dismisses the point about Leftists. "They do it too" is not a argument that justifies anything.
@Orbital_Lexicon @Newsweek Not sure what that has to do with anything.
@ElJefeStewart @heidebur_justin @dmaliciouz @FoxNews Yes? I was talking about Leftists, I can go on all day about BOTH sides.
@ElJefeStewart @heidebur_justin @dmaliciouz @FoxNews Well, no, that is a side effect of Oligarchy. As a system of governance it merely means being run by a group of societal elites.
@ElJefeStewart @heidebur_justin @dmaliciouz @FoxNews Hanen is a social liberal, fiscal conservative. He's a centrist, to be fair... just one I disagree with. But we centrists allow each other to disagree.
@heidebur_justin @ElJefeStewart @dmaliciouz @FoxNews It's the concept that undermines Leftist thinking. They prefer monarchy, kritarchy, or oligarchy. This is why they worship celebrities, foreign rulers, and they consistently abuse the judicial system to MAKE laws, not merely rule on existing/pending laws.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Could have just said a "couple in South Florida." Except you're baiting again. He's a bigotted murderer, put him to death and move on.

@adulcinj @toadgeek @WSJ @CrispinSartwell Of course. It isn't a question, at least for me, of whether some of these programs are good ideas... but to what extent. Our Walfare State has grown to the point of fiscal irrationality. We could reallocate the money to other things like Homelessness.

@U1776S Fluoride. To answer your question. Ingested fluoride lowers testosterone in males, and works to slow neurological impulses. It's why Prozak and most SSRI antidepressants are direct fluoride compounds.
@U1776S @andrewcuomo @CNNPolitics Also - if you'd like some far better stats I have some. It's rather what I do for a living.
@U1776S @andrewcuomo @CNNPolitics You REALLY should look at my profile.
@U1776S @andrewcuomo @CNNPolitics I am not with those other two. Why am I here?
@OrangutanJTrump @thehill I've never once said Fake News. Some media outlets simply have as much credibility as a 9yo caught stealing cookies.
@jstephenson1984 @CNNPolitics At this stage there is nothing anyone CAN do. Democrats survive on racial disparities, and Republicans didn't care at all until it was late. So one side thrives by keeping it alive, and have convinced millions the other side will always hate them somehow.
@jstephenson1984 @CNNPolitics Ahhhh you're Canadian. Just noticed. Most of the problem lies on the fact that, for 8 years, black people were told to segregate themselves because white people "obviously hated them." They never noticed that, just maybe, the actual racists were the ones telling them that.
@jstephenson1984 @CNNPolitics There, maybe, would be the root of the problem.
@jstephenson1984 @CNNPolitics "You Guys?" Not a republican. Not white. Not sure who "you guys" are?  Dak Prescott said that exact same thing, that the root issue should have something done about it instead of kneeling. A democrat called him a "lemonade serving negero" and Democrats cheered.
@thehill What amuses me is only @thehill has reported this. Smells lile bullsh**
Loses support from Texans. Maybe @KingJames will give him a job. https://t.co/HJTaUxZ6vr
@CNNPolitics Loses support from Texans. Maybe LeBron will give him a job.
@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace But... what he told Congress was that Trump was a criminal. Wait a second. So he ISN'T a criminal? You democrats need to pick a story.
@BretBaier While I do not always agree with @BretBaier, I must admit he is my favorite to listen to from his outlet.
@BWaaseyaa @BernieSanders @SummerForPA @Innamo That's called a Democracy. A Greek Democracy to be exact.
@DiracDeltaForce @BretBaier The problem is (while my numbers were indeed tossed out almost at random) a "random sampling" is invariably taken in one city. One town. Etc.
@thehill Good.
@BretBaier 1,000 people. 500 from rural locations, 500 from suburban and urban areas. 20 per state, split as above.		That's a poll I'd believe. Until then I don't trust polls from anyone in the media.
@BernieSanders @SummerForPA @Innamo Heh https://t.co/TgPFzTsY03
@CBSNews Yep. All we savages here in Texas.
@michaeljknowles Other Democrats: "Why does it have to be TACOS? That's racist. It must just mean 3 food items per year. Let's call it per annum. Well, that means we all have a right to 3 full sized briskets per year. Those with jobs have to buy for everyone."
@michaeljknowles Constitution: "You have 3 standard tacos alotted to you, per year."	Democrats: "Wait. Hard Tacos or soft tacos? Sometimes a soft taco is the standard. Wouldn't a burrito be the same? What's the average that people get at Taco bell? Let's ammend it to say you can have 3 XXLs free"
@thehill I like that the Democrats assume they are "America," and keep forgetting the 60 or so million people that supported Trump.
@thehill Weird since Democrats are the ones who hug antisemites and hate Isreal. Guess he survived for that, then.
@wrcactus @ThisWeekABC Rofl. How pathetic.
@dthreetwo @ZanyZealZone @washingtonpost In my case... I grew up on the Choctaw reservation, mother being Choctaw, my father was half white, half Sioux.
@dthreetwo @ZanyZealZone @washingtonpost Some of us are a bit more "descended," genetically speaking.
@dthreetwo @ZanyZealZone @washingtonpost As an ACTUAL Native (unlike Beth Warren) I don't really care. In fact I never met anyone on the reservation I grew up on that cared. We just see ourselves as Americans with a few older traditions.
@wrcactus @ThisWeekABC Thought you lefties hated Whataboutism? Always gets screamed when someone mentions #HilarityClinton or #Obama
@AbelB67 @realDailyWire Sounds like an odd Justification. Pence ACTUALLY openly supports a lot of changes that people were afraid Trump would make. Wouldn't you rather be embarrassed?
@ZanyZealZone @washingtonpost That's the problem, in the case being referenced. They showed up to try and claim it was Federal Land that he was misusing. It had always been his and his family's. He won the court case, but WaPo has to try to wring some sort of racist narrative out of it.
Okay... being against the government trying to confiscate PRIVATE LAND is not a white supremacist thing. Come to Texas and try it.. see what happens. https://t.co/ezZXiX25Uk
@wrcactus @ThisWeekABC "Top trump associates." They also keep referring to Cohen as one of Trump's Confidants. They are manipulating wording to sell articles and subscriptions to idiots.
@washingtonpost Okay... being against the government trying to confiscate PRIVATE LAND is not a white supremacist thing. Come to Texas and try it.. see what happens.
Do these people realize... if Trump is impeached, they just get Pence? Who is more conservative. https://t.co/2DOslGGZFf
@AbelB67 @realDailyWire Then you just get Pence. Who's more conservative. Have fun!
@MarkWarner Which is why we only voted for Obama Once. Granted he got elected twice anyway.
@ThisWeekABC "Top associate" really doesn't apply to Cohen. You people are the only ones who ever said he was a "confidant."
@HuffPost We haven't Criminalized Migration. We've Criminalized jumping the fence and never reporting you're here. We did that a LONG time ago.
Did this woman literally just defend bile and hatred because someone died? We've all lost family members. That is no excuse. https://t.co/DoyQnwwtcD
It amuses me that I've yet to actually have a Leftist provide ANY actual factual data to back up their claims about Trump. Not once. Just a bunch of CNN and MSNBC articles. Not one time have they provided ACTUAL reasons that Trump is a racist, sexist, fascist.
@OfficeOfMike I've been under the impression, for awhile, that Trump has actually maintained control of the media narrative this entire time. Even things like Omarosa and Cohen. 		I've my reasons, but I don't like writing articles for Twitter.
@CNNPolitics You guys have said this for two years. Try this:		Wish in your left hand. 	Sh** in your right hand.	See which fills up first.
So they have said for two years...	 Getting boring. https://t.co/hvDc3jQJ1t
@ResistNW @thehill Wish in one hand, s*** in the other. See which fills up first.
@JudyChu06634420 @thehill Oh? He did something WORSE?
@HuffPost Could be because, no matter HOW much Democrats hate him, and like to point to 7 of 182 businesses that have failed.... Wallstreet trusts him immensely.
@DannyBlazevic @RDNatoli @thehill @realDonaldTrump Oh. I know. They can't understand the idea of "praise him when he does right, bash him when he does wrong." Most Democrats are extremely single sided individuals who cannot hold two thoughts at once.
He's said that since Cohen hit the news the first time. YOU people said he was a "Trump Confidant." https://t.co/kfQfLrTvFA
@NBCPolitics He's said that since Cohen hit the news the first time. YOU people said he was a "Trump Confidant."
@TheLastWord No. That was easy.
The Left EXPLODED @POTUS over this... then simply, unapologetically, states they lied. Tomorrow they will move on. https://t.co/yV2Dccy0iH
@NPR ... ha. Especially considering how much the Left exploded at Trump over it.
@RepLanceNJ7 How's this: Mueller discloses his current findings, properly redacted, on the current investigation.  (I.E. Trump Campaign Collusion with the Kremlin) At that time, if he has nothing there, we shift his focus to prosecuting what he DOES have after almost 2 years.
@RDNatoli @thehill @realDonaldTrump How? Actually curious.
@thehill Too bad? Either stick to your Democrat Guns and go for Medicare for All, or go back to private. Obamacare is one of the worst things Obama did.

@TJohnson93 @Independent There are 4 triangles in the top quarter alone.
@cnni Oh look... cowardly kids attacking something they have no idea what it is.
@Independent 10. This isn't math, however. It's pattern recognition.
@John_Beckham14 @hardball @SenSherrodBrown Yes.... he is the one making us a laughing stock. Not the whiney college kids destroying their country litterally because of metaphors.
@hardball @SenSherrodBrown Is it because you want to charge the little guy 80% taxes, or because most of your candidates are rich white people?
@MSNBC If President Trump fires lasers at the moon, and melts all the cheese - will he be guilty of the millions of deaths the tidal forces cause?		I can do it too.
@CNN Dang. Rather expected only one person to take the fall. In groups of Democrats, one gets elected to go to prison for the rest.
@Ligerzero459 @thehill Re-read it. Deleted my tweet because I also googled Ms Nikki Fried, who is a lobbyist for a grower in another state. Being as I expect stupid arguements, I'm not walking back - just out.

@alanfair12 @cnni Not... really? Social Democracy has been part of the economy of the USA for decades. Socialism hasn't.
@MarkRenton_SA @Reuters It appears you have no concept of what Freedom of Speech means, glancing at your feed. Not sure why I'm arguing with someone who supports only their opponents being silenced.
@MarkRenton_SA @Reuters Oh. Yes. Because Twitter is so very important to life and liberty.
@MarkRenton_SA @Reuters Who's done that?
@Independent Thought you guys didn't have guns? Or gun crime?
@alanfair12 @cnni THAT is true, and a lesson the United States could learn from. However, not free.
@alanfair12 @cnni Try to actually bring up CANADIAN websites as examples.
@alanfair12 @cnni It's on der interwebs, must be true!  Eh. https://t.co/XJNyrD1wFk
@alanfair12 @cnni Canada isn't Single Payer outside Ottawa and Saskatchewan. Canada does NOT offer free education. You actually have no idea what Canadas policies are, do you?
What truly amazes me is that rich white people have convinced a massive percentage of black people that THEY are the good rich white people. They OTHER rich white people hate them... and black people fall for it.
@MarkDice They can't do that. It would ruin the narrative that only white people are evil... which is an admittedly weird narrative for a bunch of white people.
@thehill https://t.co/mrBSs5UH6E
@alanfair12 @cnni I've already loaded up articles of Canadians calling Americans stupid for thinking they are any more socialist than the USA. Awaiting your answer.

@CNN Of course? Nobody knows the guy any more, and he has no contracts that need a clearance. He could use the media attention for awhile.
@thehill Because... it's not a crime. People have said this from the left, and right, for almost two years.
@jaketapper Persona A: "This is, absolutely the truth."	Person B: "No, it isn't."	Person A: "Yes it is, it is true to a lot of people."	Person B: "Then the Truth isn't the Truth."		Literally how that conversation went.

@tomlinson_fran @MSNBC @CNN Good evening.
@tomlinson_fran @MSNBC @CNN @CNN is, most definitely, not centrist beyond them claiming it. Very well, I should have said Leftists.
@thehill Well, Democrats should Boycott the Catholic Church... wait, nobody would notice.
@CNNPolitics Mostly because nobody knows this guy any more, he has no big contact that needs a clearance, and he could benefit from @CNN and @MSNBC putting him on the news every day for a week.
@CNN @ForecasterEnten https://t.co/3BuU83dZt0
@Newsweek No... she said he DOES hire black people, but she THINKS he only hires them as window dressing. If you're going to quote someone, make sure it is accurate. Especially about a story that has been running for almost 24 hours.
@pattitatum @CNN @GregJKrieg Actually, I run these stats 5 days a week at work... pretty sure I could compile one tomorrow.
@CNN @GregJKrieg Considering how many times @CNN has said the word Trump this year on Twitter, I bet I could make a case for Freudian Love
@tomlinson_fran The ONLY reason this one can be blamed on Democrats, is because many Republicans don't believe in climate change - thus their outlets don't care to grab these stories and run with them.
@tomlinson_fran I read it, I don't watch it. Same with @CNN and @MSNBC. I only read any of them due to work.
@tomlinson_fran Living in Texas we have far less rain, a longer summer, barely any freezing winters, etc. We see it too. As I said, the problem isn't with the fact climate change is real... it is when Democrat news agencies run with stories like this, and then they get disproven... it hurts.
@tomlinson_fran If you follow the links from the first one, about polar bears, it links you to @MSNBC ,@CNN, and others. These are OPENLY Democratic organizations.
@CBSNews BREAKING: #HilarityClinton has a 96% chance to win the presidency.
The press IS an important part of democracy. Liars, hecklers, propaganda machines, and fabricators of "truth" aren't. Some how cable news assumes it is the only "Press." https://t.co/OJ03xmrhIZ
Even when you agree with Lefties, they just continue to try to fight you. If you don't run around shrieking about virtues they don't actually have - they go into an autopilot attack mode. Wont be long before they turn on each other completely.
@tomlinson_fran You are trying to fight someone who doesn't disagree with the scientists you are linking me to.
@tomlinson_fran You... are missing a point. A big one. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. As I have stated three times now. Fake stories using fake pictures, to try to make people get amped up about climate change - do harm to people believing it is real.
@tomlinson_fran https://t.co/2LLFI6ZIGD	https://t.co/2AqOfLfCgu	https://t.co/KLBl8dwGfW
@tomlinson_fran If you read it, that article provides both. Concerning polar bears.
@tomlinson_fran Climate change IS real. People ARE making it faster, and worse. Things like these stories make people disbelieve the entire thing, however.
@tomlinson_fran Polar bears are sitting at 3x the population they were 30 years ago, however:		https://t.co/OcUzSu7zI5		I can actually provide a sad number of stories like it.
@tomlinson_fran @politico Do you live IN D.C.? I lived in Laurel, and having to actually go to the office once a week was the worst part of working there.
I'm not sure about that. Seen some of the stuff @Ocasio2018 has said on tape? Her beating down of the credibility of @TheDemocrats has been pretty brutal. https://t.co/XdMETzHO1v
@FoxNews Dunno. Seen some of the things @Ocasio2018 has said on tape? She beat herself pretty brutally.
@SoulBlossom_Wen @thehill Of course not. He's a lawyer.
@Johnny_Congress Unfortunately the Left has lost all interest in conversation.
@Cernovich So... partisan censorship is better than "saying things we think are lies?" The Democrats give a peek at their true face again.
@rangersfan1966 @thehill Even I can admit that was funny.
@thehill I think he meant to say truth isn't Fact, and screwed up. Rudy is about 200 years old, and was never all that stable.
@politico Having lived in D.C... Laurel, just outside of it, is pretty great. D.C. itself is over priced for living in a trashed, stinking city that smells like a papermill with no mill in sight. It has higher rent than most of CA, while somehow being worse to live in.
@FoxNews It's okay, this is Texas. He won't survive.
@58Wedge @FoxNews Wtf does sessions have to do with this one?

@michaeljknowles Most of the Left claim to be college graduates, right? How did I survive college with more than one brain cell left?
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill I wasn't defending his underlying reason, but the actual sentiment in the statements.
@GrippleDeGrap @DineshDSouza You'd have to ensure zero government funding, or oversight.
@emzanotti Still, go to better places if it's been read six times lol
@emzanotti Oh, jesus. Thanks for the clarification. I just read it through the thumbnail, and gagged. Reading it in a different view it is actually sorta funny since it seems like something a Leftist would actually upvote on Twitter if posted alone.
@GrippleDeGrap @DineshDSouza People do that already with birth control? Also who decides what class of people to offer this to? What happens when they refuse? Eugenics becomes a slippery slope very quickly.
@DineshDSouza The sad part is that theaters fail to contain the gas well enough. I'm sure that Lefty could tell you why the Nazis shifted to enclosed rooms.
@emzanotti That is sickening on an entirely new level. You need to go to better places, Emily.
@thehill Yet Democrats get cheers for hugging Louis Farrakhan... an open antisemite.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill He will be gone in 2-6 years, and the country will keep moving. As a social liberal, legal conservative - all around libertarian - I have the benefit of the patience to just wait it out. Support what he does right, condemn what he does wrong, and plan to work fixing it later.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill And it's a childish activity. I rarely feel the need to comment on the actions of children, as they are often foolhardy and not worth my time. Therefore I can agree with the sentiment, even if the basis of HIS PERSONAL reasoning is idiotic.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill Because I agree with Trump on the fact she SHOULD be investigated. That part is very true. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill I, actually, would like to see Trump and Hillary both in jail. That is the major flaw here.
@paulkrugman How dare you quote Ingsoc?
@mlportn @PyrrhosPal @thehill Not a conservative. Swing and a miss. You two have a nice day.
@PyrrhosPal ... LMFAO. Okay, you "win." Yeah, the 3 years of independently verified FACTS are conspiracy theories, when they are against people you like, but conjecture is real against people you dislike. This conversation is at an impasse.
@Revkin @MSNBC @chrislhayes @NatGeo I think you missed my point. Reread it, slower.
@PyrrhosPal You are missing an older, and bigger picture here:		https://t.co/S8rlGVSpmu
They didn't call him a Left Wing Extremist? Odd. They make CERTAIN to add that when it's the other way around. https://t.co/ovM9kDLq3F
@CNN Don't be a terrorist. Lesson learned.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill So. It's "whataboutism" when a conservative does it, but just fair play when a liberal does it? Gotcha.
Wait... I get it now. #HilarityClinton blames Trump for what she has done, so obviously him pushing the blame back to her is "Takesy Backsies," and she called No Take Backs before she tagged him. Makes perfect sense now. https://t.co/uZFG5gG47K
@MSNBC That is the funniest damned thing I've read today. Thanks @MSNBC.
@PyrrhosPal @mlportn @thehill Not sure how that proves his point. Someone commits crimes, blames them on someone else, and walks away scott free.
@PyrrhosPal @thehill Seems to have worked for #HilarityClinton
@freedom_moates @BetoORourke Somehow they even got my number for my work phone, and tried texting it. Which is actually vaguely funny since they have me listed as a Conservative Commentator.
@redsteeze Socialist thinking at it's finest. "We f***ed up, but it's obviously not our fault. YOU should try harder."
@redsteeze It amazes me how hard Lefties push for social media to block and ban conservatives, while with a straight face shriek "FIRST AMMENDMENT" when someone just ignores them.
@business And you people were worried, and shrieking about this... while it was actually getting done. You just weren't paying attention - all your focus on the shrieking.
@washingtonpost About 6 years ago.
@Jensenfive5 @freedom_moates You're*
@freedom_moates To be fair, I block people all the time on Twitter. Mostly once we've had our conversation, and they resort to shrieking at me that I am a Republican in disguise defending "dear leader," and other such nonsense.
Because we've been on a proven warming trend for 11,000 years - and while science supports the fact that humans are speeding up the process, Democrats like to try to shriek out emotional appeals about penguins and polar bears that get rapidly disproven? Maybe? https://t.co/k2L3acM0NJ
@MSNBC @chrislhayes @Revkin Because we've been on a warming trend for 11,000 years, and instead of sticking to the facts about human rapidization of the process you leftists like to shriek out emotional appeals that fall flat?

@thehill Because Democrats support Freedom, obviously.

@DavidWohl @MSNBC @FCC "A lie told often enough becomes the Truth." - Lenin
With has often as the Left has been screaming "Authoriarian" at everyone on the right... one has to wonder if they've any idea what a political map looks like. https://t.co/mSZC7N6Ifj
@thehill You people support the government owning the means of production, regulations on all aspects of life... but keep calling the Right Authoriarians. Ever seen a political map?
@plouiseivans @mckeonmk @thehill No. Democrats by the millions shrieked because of people being blocked on Twitter... then clapped when right wingers get censored. You pointed out that small, extreme groups on the right support censoring speech. 		Not the same at all.
@TheDemocrats - Rob the rich and give to the poor.	- Immigrants can bypass the immigration system if they are young.	- Slavery of Doctors.	- Bankrupt small businesses, while leaving corporations alone.	- Climate Changes anyway, we've been on a warming trend for 11,000 years.
Tribalism is the downfall of civilization. When the tribes around the world met in congress with one another, settled their differences, and created governments and laws - tribalism was meant to be a thing of the past... but here we are.
@plouiseivans @mckeonmk @thehill No, just pointing out the foolishness of constantly holding only the right accountable for things the Left is equally guilty of. All that invokes is tribalism, which is fundamentally opposed to civilization.
@plouiseivans @mckeonmk @thehill Not so much. https://t.co/9FRjJlafVE
Keep an eye on the ties people in politics wear when they are on TV. Make a note of the color. Even the stupid will notice a trend.
@Newsweek Former. Also wearing a blue tie. Keep an eye on the ties worn during public appearances.
@mckeonmk @thehill Leftists only care about the 1st ammendment* when people are saying things they agree with.
@thehill He openly said that, because of what he was briefed on, the President is X, Y, and Z... none of which have any proof yet. That's too far.
@thehill Dunno... LBJ is pretty high up there.
What confuses me is watching the Leftist train of thought. 		-Conservative said it? Obviously a lie.	-Leftist now says it? They are also obviously liars.	-Media gets caught telling 50 lies in 50 days? Doesn't matter, Media is telling the truth.	-Why do conservatives lie so much?
@Cher47 @Newsweek Historically? Not at all.
@Newsweek https://t.co/xD7yk3sjmt
@MidkiffJoan @kenolin1 You must not see too many of his tweets. The sober comment made me realize it.
@rowdyrr9 @thehill Distinct? That is an understatement. They should let them out of the basement more often. They might keep readers.
@kenolin1 Drugs! That explains things about you.
@AmandaPresto Censoring free speech!!!! Isn't that what leftists were screaming a couple years ago about conservative public accounts blocking them?
@CBSNews Maybe he will actually have to defend himself this time.
@raysawhill A truly dark day.
@CNN You can hope. Doesn't help, but everyone needs hope for something.
Did conservatives break into @thehill , tie everyone up, and start tweeting for them? Or is @thehill finally realizing they went so far left they lost even most Democrats. https://t.co/fzTtJkAZ1T
@thehill Did conservatives break into @thehill , tie everyone up, and start tweeting for them? Or is @thehill finally realizing they went so far left they lost even most Democrats.
"If President Trump fires lasers at the moon, and melts all the cheese - will he be guilty of all the murders the tidal forces cause?"		See? I can do it too. https://t.co/5FtjcQpzsP
@MSNBC "If President Trump fires lasers at the moon, and melts all the cheese - will he be guilty of all the murders the tidal forces cause?"		See? I can do it too.
The left ADORES bashing Christianity... annnnnnd forgot about the Black Church. Whoops. https://t.co/4fUITtY7X3
@CNNPolitics Because - just because you shriek racism endlessly doesn't mean people believe it. It also helps that the constant leftist attacks on Religion has pushed the black church to the Republicans.  You guys forgot there are black christians, didn't you?
Anyone else wish the Media would stop using the term "The N-Word?" We all know what it means. They just want to put the word in our heads so we think it for them.		Either sack up and say it, or just leave it out and call it 'racial slur,' or something. https://t.co/6RcJLrlUxX
@Newsweek The man is 70. Means he was raised in the 50s. It would be extremely shocking if he never said it. 		Also - stop saying "N-word." We know what it MEANS.  You just want us to think it for you, instead of you just saying what you mean. Either just say it, or leave it out.
I'm noticing that it just utterly seems to ruin the day of many Leftists when they try to respond to me by insulting Fox News, and I agree with them. For some reason they simply cannot comprehend that there are more than two kinds of people in the world.
@MisaMK1 @CNN Nah, Fox was always full of shit.
@RobPurdue2 @CNN Who said fake news? Also - it's a quote FROM A CNN REPORTER.
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill That simple statement gained you a follower. Have a nice evening!
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill I admittedly write articles for right leaning sites far more than left leaning - at least these past two years - mostly because of the echo chamber effect  (social liberal, governmental conservative - all around libertarian) and unfortunately many on the left attack it.
@AdamBaldwin He will likely forcefully declassify a bit of stuff two weeks before the midterms to limit counter arguments, and give it time for coverage.
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill Editorials written by those on the Left. However, I could link you PDF after PDF from my Left folder (you likely know many of the examples in my Right folder), but I would not change your mind. I'm still here because you are actually talking instead of insulting. An oddity.
@CNN Sadly words from @CNN are mattering less and less each day. Their fact to opinion ratio has almost completely traded places since 2008.
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill Of course not. https://t.co/qYMDCYdUNi
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill And I am a sociologist who does this for a living. Both sides are blatant liars, most often via spin more than malicious alterations of fact.
@TurboKia @JohnNorcali @thehill That one can be difficult at times, as realpolitik and snopes are extremely biased, just in opposite directions. I believe what I see with my own eyes, the rest I take with a grain of salt without seeing stats from at least 2 sources.
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill Actually... it's about even. The best bet is finding reports about the same topic and seeing what they agree on. More often the closest to truth you can find. That said @thehill blatantly lies more often than naught.
@136or142 @JohnNorcali @thehill Really any major news outlet, actually. Though why you'd only list one side is fairly obvious.
@CNN and @MSNBC both flat out lied in their tweets about this, claiming he said that they were utterly unbiased... and @thehill accidentally told the truth. What backwards world is this? https://t.co/DdSbVs6i4s
@JohnNorcali @thehill You won't find that on the internet, sadly.
@thehill Holy shit did @thehill actually just tell the truth with a tweet headline that even @CNN tried to flat out lie about?
Well, he can't be guilty of murder if he's an illegal immigrant. Obviously. Because that would mean admitting an illegal immigrant was a criminal. https://t.co/vntia8VMn1
@KatelynLoveren @ABC I... I would think so. Never thought about it, really.
@ABC Their police actually protected free speech? That burns, it really does.
@washingtonpost Nixon, also, ultimately just tried to steal a tape. That was it. Literally... that was it.
@King21Wild @KlangLouisville @jonnyspeech @Cernovich So it's okay to use racist terminology, so long as you actually make sure one of them is around? Awesome! Thanks for the advice.
@PaulHJossey Accuse Hilarity Clinton of colluding with the Russians. It worked last time. About two weeks later the DNC was hacked.
@caplan_g @thehill https://t.co/mWHgr4scHl		Who's lands and property they inherited. Therefore, technically correct, but still...
@PaulHJossey @jack Beat me by a minute.
@DavidWohl No. That'd actually be wrong. Just demand @CNN present a new representative, and un-invite them from the white house until they do.
@thehill I... love the comments to this.		@jack "Yes, we kinda ban some conservative stuff. We lean to the left. We are working on it."		Leftists: "LIAR! Not true, no you dont. Nu uh. You guys don't ban conservatives, because that's wrong. Not happening!"
@Newsweek I like the wording of stuff like this. "New REPORT says." "X outlet claims..." no one can call you a liar - if all you are reporting is that someone else reported something.
@enemyofstatists @thehill Until they get very few negative comments. It's how @thehill works. They delete the tweets that people shoot down.
@thehill Hero to some, villain to others. For example: the Emancipation Proclamations exempted the slaves owned by Grant, Lincoln, and others from receiving Freedom.		Hero to some, villain to others.
@Reuters @joel_schectman @Bing_Chris Let me guess... he lost his election.
@bjbloompf4 @redsteeze Nah. He likes Pompeo pretty well. He might have one, too.
@TariffMYtaxCUT @FoxNews They can see what CNN and MSNBC have been saying all day, too. So what?
@FoxNews See what happens when you throw the book at someone? It can miss if you're wrong in chapter 4.
RT @redsteeze: Ivanka is going to be only person left with a security clearance when this is over.
@bjbloompf4 @redsteeze Why? Lol it's funny.
@redsteeze This... this is hilarious.
I was wondering how long it would take for Leftists to begin to implode - simply for not being radical enough. Historically happens to all extremist groups. https://t.co/2eR79MIGge
@Ahmed_Baines @TheBeatWithAri Mmmm... Leftists eating each other. Was only a matter of time.
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Everything to Leftists, that they don't like, is somehow against the constitution. Despite, in many cases, the constitution doesn't even APPLY. Like this one.
@thehill Bush's "VA Chief" was one of the worst we have ever had. Hell, Obama handled the VA better. Let's not quote this guy.
It went from him asking me for examples about Republicans - me giving them to him - and suddenly  him attempting to flip the script,  despite getting what he wanted. Oh well, was a fun talk for a while. https://t.co/bN7Kc4xOc2
@healthpicker @thehill You're somehow going from actual conversation, to blind accusations. Interesting. No, I gave examples - with supported facts - that are easily found. They are unpleasant facts to you, so you are resorting to anger instead. This is why violence is more common on the left.
@healthpicker @thehill Though, on the fascist bit... right now both sides are guilty of ignoring their fascist groups.
@healthpicker @thehill Which is also a fair assessment! One of them is true, and eventually everyone will know which is which. I am a weird one that can accept either one.
@CNNPolitics Personal Opinion: Perform a DNA test on them. If they ARE the parents, let them come back in and petition for asylum together. If not, keep the children here for their safety. They were already kidnapped once.
@healthpicker @thehill So, while I think he's a rich old bigot, I actually believe him when he says he doesn't support the KKK or Neo Nazis.
@healthpicker @thehill Insofar as racism against a specific ideology, or color, not so much. Claiming people from Haiti all have aids, or that educated blacks have an advantage over educated whites (about 30 years ago) and such show him to be bigoted, but not overtly racist.
@healthpicker @thehill Actually, I have plenty of that as well! However, if you even google badly - let alone actually do this for a living as I do - the sheer amount of Leftist hate, bile, and threats is enough that even Democrats have spoken against it, from congress to media.
@healthpicker @thehill Well, unfortunately his calls for such things as police officers roughing up gang members is not really hate speech, as gangs aren't a protected class. It's blatantly stupid, and irresponsible, but not hate speech. That said, I happily bash Trump when he's wrong.
Look! Turkey supports Alex Jones, too! https://t.co/Y0p4ZYJzWS
@Newsweek ...hahahahaha. Yet Trump is mad at Apple at the moment. Good job, Turks!
@thehill Funny... @Ocasio2018 said they were.
@healthpicker @thehill Better example:		https://t.co/IocIj8UGHk		Or the endless antisemitic stuff thrown at Ben Shapiro for the past couple of years by Democrats.
@healthpicker @thehill Well, what I am linking (I have a LOT) are extremely common on the Left right now. Louis Farrakhan also is a very open antisemite that enjoys hugs and selfies with Democrat congressmen. No, however, it is not only Democrats... just more common today. Was the other way under Obama https://t.co/9kdB4BnDJk
@healthpicker @thehill If it were a lot of Democrats would be in jail. No, however. Some cities have ordinances against it - but at a federal level it only becomes a crime if it DIRECTLY calls for, and incites, violence.
@thehill Trump didn't claim this. Hell, he isn't even the 10,000th to claim this. This claim started months ago.
@CNN And yet most of your stories today are about morons like @MichaelAvenatti ? Really?
@thehill Insane woman... actual villain... liar who claims to be of my people... hmm..		However, considering how many female Democrats there are... it isn't exactly a big number.
@CNN https://t.co/vXLPcHdfH5
Anyone heard from poor, poor Stormy Daniels lately? Seems like Democrats ditched her as fast as the guy who used her for news coverage. https://t.co/EuUPOAxwzl
@redsteeze and @AshGoldsmithh need to f*** and get it over with already. The heavy petting via tweeting is getting uncomfortable.
@NBCPolitics Virtues mean nothing to Democrats, unless they can say an opponent has none. They sell them every day while cheering for ACTUAL racists, nazis, and sexual predators... because of the idea "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
@AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze @GrantGambling Will you two fuck already?
@NBCNews Probably because, like all things, winning is more important to Democrats than virtue. As much as they TALK about virtues, they will happily sell them if it means more Democrats.
@ABCPolitics A weird thing for Nazis to do...
@TIME If I saw that with no explanation, I would have thought it was an article about babies born to drug addicts.
@nytimes https://t.co/xD7yk3sjmt
@LBC1983 @AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze As a sociologist, who's entire world is basically stats and numbers, I must agree with that logic. Though, as devil's advocate, I have to point out the joke only has 140k people on Twitter, plus retweets. Of the totality, it may land badly if seen by everyone.
@LBC1983 @AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze https://t.co/OB5gWN4Xud
@JeanneB1962 @kenolin1 @realDonaldTrump Well... bye I guess.
@freedom_moates @NASFortWorthJRB Dude, really? Go to NAS Dallas. Better view, and more to do when you're done relaxing.
@JeanneB1962 @kenolin1 @realDonaldTrump I realize I just described MOST politicians. On both sides. Making lesser of two evils arguements (which most Democrats and Republicans DO, just to stick up for their party) still means choosing evil.
@LBC1983 @AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze None. Some people find some things funny, others don't. Caring which one is which just distracts people.
@AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze Eh Steven is on break. Conservatives and Progressives take the weekends off to play on Twitter, they all go back to spinning bullshit on Monday.
@thehill A prisoner strike? Are they not going to go to work, and just stay home... ahm... err... wait...
@kenolin1 @realDonaldTrump Eh Trump is a complete ass, a narcissist, and exaggerates everything to the point of parody... still take him over Democrats that happily support criminals, racists, sexual abusers, and worse... just to play for votes.
@AshGoldsmithh @redsteeze Yeahhhh one dude. About 500 lefties a week, maybe 5 kids who follow various conservatives in the same week. Point stands.
@redsteeze Wtf is the leftist obsession with followers on Twitter, anyway? Do their lives get validated if they get enough idiots to see what they say? Is it somehow a scale of worth to them?
@kenolin1 Yes... obviously it's Trumps fault that Leftists are assaulting people, waging war against families, destroying property... how DARE the principles of the Left be brought low.
@redsteeze The Left completely lack humor. It's one of the hallmarks. What they consider funny tends to be very vulgar, racist, or sexist... granted when anyone else makes those jokes they try to get the government involved.
@john_zannis @thehill Yet... even the main stream media were bouncing off the walls in anger over people blocking others on Twitter.
@thehill Free Speech only matters to Democrats when THEY are the ones silenced. Then they shriek the walls down. Anyone else who is silenced, and complains, are pathetic whiners.
@Independent Trump isn't the one who started the claim. Hell, he isn't the 10,000th.
@michaeljknowles I'm curious why the left is happy with politicians who incite division, racism, and fiscal policy that bankrupts people... but truly hate someone because they're a jackass.
@TIME Belladonna. Done.
@NBCPolitics Put those kids back with their parents!! Now then, pull them apart again.
@thehill Weird... this chick thinks so...		https://t.co/xD7yk3sjmt
@RepLowenthal Independent science should get independent funding. Why it is called Independent. Otherwise the government has a say over your research... like this.
@kenolin1 This was ALMOST clever. You're getting better.
@NBCPolitics It isn't just conservatives claiming it, but we centrists and left leaners too.
Republicans: "The press is currently the enemy of the people."	Democrats: "TREASON!! Constitution!!"	Socialist Star: *actually bans the press* "This is so people feel safe."	Democrats: "... shit."		 https://t.co/2WrDQTF40i
@thehill So... she politely said that the Press is the Enemy of the People? Hmm
@brithume Could be because when you have a security clearance... get information and run to the news (even if you just make up shit, and CLAIM it's stuff you learned), you lose your clearance. If he were military they'd court marshal him and throw him in prison.
@ABCPolitics The Press are part of the Residents. Granted Democrats feel journalists are a different class of people, so I see where her mistake was.
@thehill Except your own article calls your headline a lie? None of the quotes from the judge support this headline. More click bait.
@cpw_Numenor @thehill No. That was easy.
@thehill That's because Democrats only support THEIR speech. Everyone else should be banned, boycotted, or harassed for theirs. Just like proper socialists.
@aohillbilly @FoxNews @SebGorka Which applies to the NEXT president as well, whether Democrat or Republican.
@FoxNews @SebGorka As someone who knows a few of the adjudicators? I'd actually have to agree with Gorka for once. Being sent to the principal too many times in Middle school can disqualify someone, but staff for Congress or the President get pushed straight through, generally.
@marklevinshow Democrats never supported #MeToo beyond lip service for votes. You can rather tell by many of the comments they made towards Republican women.
@thehill Would You want more ammunition for the Leftists? Jesus a week ago @thehill was trying to spin what the President drinks as a soda into a view of racism.
@thehill Thank God. Between her voice, and the sheer insanity she displays, the fact it existed in Netflix at all annoyed me.
@strodel1 @CNN Considering that in the last 37 cases of police officer Excessive Force the officers in question have been suspended pending review. So...
Anyone going to admit that we already have these units? That the "Space Force" is simply putting them under a cohesive command structure. No? Eh, okay. https://t.co/KTHlb5OogC
@CNNPolitics We... already... HAVE THESE UNITS. All the "Space Force" is? Placing them under one cohesive command. That's it. So a majority of Americans are A) stupid, or B) more likely CNN ONLY ran their poll in LA or NY.
@TulpaOmega @CNN Nah, not a good reach. Let's just point out the hypocrisy of their headlining like I did :p
@615Gamecock @CNN I just did it for them.
@CNN If the officer had been white the headline would have been "White officer beats black man. Only gets suspension. Tonight at 9."		That said, good. ALL police officers should have to answer to the community they serve.
@notarealliberal @JohnBar75173976 @dbongino Hmm. I was having fun talking to him, and now he's gone. Why I don't generally link actual vides. Solid proof is less amusing.
@jakebarrett78 @NPR That is, to be fair to the idiot (Trump), a likely outcome. Despite all of his fuck ups, his policies toward the military and the VA have been incredibly solid.
@jakebarrett78 @NPR Actually MY view is that it's just a ridiculous cost in general, hold the parade elsewhere. I tend not to care about potential underlying motivations. There is no reason for, as an example, 15m of that to be directed to the police - as MPs patrol along side them for parades.
@jakebarrett78 @NPR D.C. wanted to charge over 21 million in city services. They charged 2m for a parade under Obama, 4m under bush. The cost of the entire parade was raised by over 43m due to DoD contractor standard percentage mark up because they front municipal fees.		https://t.co/WTCLSJ8UiX
@JohnBar75173976 @richard23704 @dbongino I had two more replies, before his statement about you being a bot - 3 full replies as one statement.
@JohnBar75173976 @richard23704 @dbongino I actually agree with you on that. However I also believe in absolutely proving crimes first. Both should be investigated, completely, and any guilty parties should serve a jail term. Incidentally most Democrats dislike me because I don't think conjecture is proof.
@richard23704 @JohnBar75173976 @dbongino Well, he isn't a bot. The tweet pattern is randomized with no set criteria of topic, responses, or any logical contextualized repetition. However, whether he can understand my point is a very different question.
@JohnBar75173976 @richard23704 @dbongino ...3... merely a week before that. The articles still exist. Therefore it becomes hard to take the narrative seriously, as it looks simply like a switch of blame, especially considering her vast Russian contacts. Therefore... some of us are waiting on Mueller and aren't judging.
@JohnBar75173976 @richard23704 @dbongino ... a very easy remote command via WinPE or Diskpart (which they could execute) is very questionable. The instant reaction was a very concerted lashing against Donald Trump by 23 outlets, the entire DNC, and more... despite Hilary being the one questioned about Russia...
@JohnBar75173976 @richard23704 @dbongino The primary issue is that Hilarity Clinton was, in fact, being accused of collaboration with the Russian government well before the election really took off. The counter to the narrative, especially as the hackers merely removed files and did not encrypt the drives on exit...
@thehill This is playing out like a produced drama... and it's a crappy one.
@dbongino Because only Republicans can do wrong? Democrats are the woke, progressive, saviours of our country... though, if the country was never great, one wonders what they are saving exactly.
@KevinMKruse So we will ignore the 75% tax rates, the growing control over material production, and a few other issues and cherry pick one line of various documents. Neat. Especially since only 4 confederate states had slavery referenced in their actual constitution at all.
@NPR They want to charge over 92 million dollars for it. It was 1/10th that last time (nearly).
@HuffPostPol @BretBaier Hmm?		https://t.co/HJAdHRDbfB
@AlGreen88157887 You'd be amazed at how little I care about Trump, beyond his policies. Don't care what else he says, does, looks like, or did in the past.
@TheSoapboxToday @washingtonpost Following 2 briefings to both him, and to Congress, explaining the massive costs.
@washingtonpost Yeah... except she did the Democrat thing and blatantly ignored that it was the DoD who had major problems with the cost.
@shaneharris https://t.co/nb9m322gnU
@thehill Because Quarterly earning reports cost money, man hours, and more... and they mean absolutely nothing?
@MurielBowser @jaketapper Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.... btw it was 11 DoD officials who initially had a problem with the cost. Trump just made the final decision.
@thehill There... has... to... have been a crime for him to obstruct the justice being carried out ON that crime. Just because you guys keep screaming, doesn't make it real.
@USATODAY I like how you guys crammed in the fact that, in fact, it was the officials that had a problem with the massive budget. Tried to make it all about Trump to start with.
@business @macmargolis @bopinion So... like Americans.
@ungerbn103 @washingtonpost He has absolute autonomy over the DoD
@washingtonpost Which is funny, since @thehill tried to claim he was just rolling back Obama era regulations on cyber warfare... without saying WHY. Pretty bad when even WaPo says more.
@thehill Well... say something stupid and get stupid responses.  Then again no one accused Andy of being smart.
@TheCompWiz @CNNPolitics Same, I was wondering if Comey was supposed to be Beavis.
@michaeljknowles SOS received. Will alert short man in the hat to send care package until extraction.
@michaeljknowles Will send help.
@MSNBC @maddow https://t.co/th5ZhlImOQ
@Cernovich Well... to be fair... Leftist pasts are rather the same as their present. Angry, believe the world sucks, rather racist and sexist tendencies, and support what ever the greatest evil in the world currently is.
@washingtonpost That he should have never HAD a clearance? True.
@thehill "Former" hmm.
@Newsweek He is also contradicting the actual FISA warrant.
Considering how much racism, and sexism, the Left portray daily? Not surprising. What is surprising is that they STILL convince people they aren't the racists. https://t.co/LcZ7n7LSJH
@thehill Probably because he'd have to see their current funding?
@thehill For yet-another-example of how stupid Democrats are becoming....
@thehill Of what crime?
@thehill Because him calling them rapists was a 12s clip of a 30m conversation about MS-13 specifically? #LyingByOmission
@MSNBC ..... hahahahaha
@hardball Neat.
@USATODAY Yeahhhhh I've walked from the USA to Mexico and back to get lunch and a haircut (Mexico for lunch and haircut in the USA). The town is called Eagle Pass. The fence doesnt cross the road.
Yeah... that's "all" he said. Lying by omission is still lying.		 https://t.co/iVbF3N999B https://t.co/ToAp0wb6eG
@thehill Yeah... that's "all" he said. Lying by omission is still lying.		 https://t.co/iVbF3N999B
@TheCompWiz @CNNPolitics That's almost as bad as all Democrats. Don't even joke like that.
@CNNPolitics Heh. Kinda funny.
@BillAdkinsKY @postwarO27 @ABC @trish_regan Thankfully they, while having most of the wealth, actually own quite little of the means of production. Take the billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. He owns all of 4 companies.
@thehill Just In: None of these tapes have amounted to anything. Except that if they were real she would have already released them.
@GOPChairwoman @exjon I like how sexist the Democrats are being in these replies. It reminds me how racist and sexist they truly are. No wonder they always feel guilty.
@thehill So... she's stupid?
@CNNPolitics Okay. Again. As I told @thehill, who started this story trend - all news papers in the nation  (other than 27) are owned by 18 conglomerates. These conglomerates are controlled by 5 corporations, or their subsidiaries. 4 of these are openly democrat. 		Your numbers mean nothing.
@axios Google Employees need to realize they work FOR a company. Why they are called employees. Tired of seeing headlines about people who don't know workplace dynamics.
@TheEconomist You expected that to change over a mild disagreement?
@hardball 350 newspapers? NEAT. All news papers (other than 27 nation wide small outlets) are owned by a total of 18 conglomerates. Which are owned by 5 corporations. 4 of which are openly democrat. So, really, the numbers mean nothing.
@justice67135 @BillAdkinsKY @ABC @trish_regan And now I invite you to read the 500 or so articles that AREN'T merely from 2012, right as it happened. This article was the start.
A strangely eloquent Leftist.  However, let's begin:		Serfdom: Feudal Labor. Aka working for the state. Which is what happens when the government owns the means of production... Oh that's the socialism he supports in the thread.		Rest: So somehow people being rich isn't freedom? https://t.co/TkJK3HpRqK
Brennan exercised his freedom of choice. Freedoms come with prices. He picked what he wanted.
When you get a security clearance that is an understanding that you now get to know things the public isn't allowed to know. You don't get to know them AND talk about them... you pick one or the other. Brennan chose to talk, so he lost the ability to know. https://t.co/MRmYmqbtxA
@CNNPolitics He wasn't silent to begin with. Why it was revoked. You don't get access to secrets AND the ability to talk about them. You have to pick one, and Brennan did. He made his choice.
@BillAdkinsKY @postwarO27 @ABC @trish_regan Also? Serfdom? That means Feudal Labor. Aka working for the state with no recourse... you know, what happens when the state owns all means of production. Wait... that's socialism...
@BillAdkinsKY @postwarO27 @ABC @trish_regan Systemic breakdown? No. Faults within the system? Blatantly obvious. Too many bureaucrats (unelected). Too much autonomy amongst groups of people with no over sight. Too many redundant programs that get in each others way (See: EPA, NPS, FWS.). A breakdown, however? No.
@realDailyWire What I find interesting is that she doesn't release them all at once... almost like they have a production time.
@AlGreen88157887 True patriots do not purposely, and knowingly, violate their contracts that they sign in order to obtain a clearance.
@BillAdkinsKY @postwarO27 @ABC @trish_regan You think how much money people have is a scale of freedom. You have a nice day, I don't debate the disabled.
@NBCPolitics Because it's true. The Freedom of the Press is a good thing. We just currently have a LOT of idiots called journalists.
@thehill The fact you don't see the joke in that Tweet follows my idea that Democrats no longer believe anyone but them are allowed to be funny.
@KaMarie345 @Newsweek Oh... look... Omarosa saying Trump was in no way racist and that she knew the Real Donald Trump..		https://t.co/WsvxT4aN8Y
@Newsweek Trun trum trum trum, TRUMMMMM
@washingtonpost Hundreds of newspapers owned by 18 conglomerates owned by 5 corporations, 4 of whom are openly Democrat... wait, sounds like something I had to explain to @thehill. Come on WaPo, don't go THAT low.
@thehill Hundreds of newspapers owned by 18 conglomerates, owned by 5 corporations... 4 of whom are openly Democrat. Yet another @thehill article that is meaningless.
@maddow sure loves trashing how the government works, but repeatedly shows a lack of understanding, or knowledge, of how the government works. https://t.co/D7uNpoETk5
@freedom_moates Yes... I could fight it. No... don't care, never been a huge Twitter fan.
@freedom_moates Considering the fact my "public interest" account was removed from Twitter because one of their enforcers read an article of mine that was posted to Disqus? About the education system? Going with yes.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog The Process is handled at Andrews Airforce Base. The final ruling is handled by the Secretaries of the various forces. The absolute final word CAN be the president.
@freedom_moates @msonenote Evernote for preference.
@mitchellreports @jmclaughlinSAIS There are not "13 reasons why," which is a crap show btw. There are 13 precedents. They are not limits.
@BillAdkinsKY @ABC @trish_regan Cute. The person who wants the government  (that they hate) to be in absolute control of their lives thinks they know what Freedom is.
@NathanHRubin @Gigasrex Also - public schools, public parks, fire departments and highways are run by states and counties. Partial financing from the Fed. The others are government contracts, not goverment owned, except the DOD.
@NathanHRubin @Gigasrex Just... a quick example... Denmark almost collapsed and took massive sweeping austerity measures. Mostly an example because Denmark is upheld as the pinnacle example of working socialism:		https://t.co/a9t1BjK3vP
@NBCNews Resurrect the guy and beat him to death again?
@HRCDemocrat @thehill You do know that Democrats controlled congress for almost 30 years, right? And began that racist war on drugs, the war on poverty (on poor people*) etc?
@thehill Maybe this one will come work at @thehill and actually give you guys some form of News Cred.
@thehill And when people ACTUALLY read this the company was hacked. 20 people recieved it. 		@thehill lying at 5am every day for your pleasure.
@BillAdkinsKY @ABC @trish_regan As a Libertarian  (not a republican as all Democrats assume anyone who isn't a democrat is), I am likely the most fundamentally against socialism person you will find in these comments. Go try it on someone else.
@BillAdkinsKY @ABC @trish_regan Denmark almost collapsed and took massive, sweeping austerity measures. Their government programs were all rolled back. Try again.		https://t.co/a9t1BjK3vP
@ABC Good ol socialism. Right on schedule.
@FoxNews Both times this guy's girlfriend has stood around looking at him like he's a moron. Poor guy.
@hardball The janitor? The door man? A secretary?
@OfficeOfMike If it helps, Michael, my 'public interest' accout was banned because of an article I wrote ELSEWHERE about the education system creating liberals from kindergarten up. Feel good. Lol
@thehill So... socialism.
@RepKarenBass They are civilians now. To leave them able to access classified places, and data, is unwise merely from a security standpoint. The fact that is "practice" shows a grevious lack of security.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Yet... he no longer needs his clearance. He is no longer in a position that needs access to classified data.
@freedom_moates @dc_chronicle And won't give me one, despite providing 10 years of research, and articles with a few hundred thousand views. Meh.
@thehill How? Also - many of them weren't the parents. Shall we sell them back?
@freedom_moates And 250 adjudicators cheered.
@thehill https://t.co/uUd9FN0yu8
So when are we going to discuss the fact that in 2016 Omarosa said she has known "the real Donald Trump" for a decade and absolutely loved him? That he was in no way racist? 		https://t.co/WsvxT4aN8Y
@LesFry3 @Independent You've no idea what's going on in the country I take it?
@realDailyWire I wonder why?		https://t.co/WsvxT4aN8Y
@Independent Well... Democrats elected a maniac socialist - maybe they felt they needed to balance the insanity scale?
@freedom_moates @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump So was her botox, but we aren't as judgey.
@thehill Sooooo, wait. She was happy working for, and with, these horrible racists until she was fired? Then suddenly they were horrible racists? Gotcha.
Did I miss the memo that said we were becoming a Kritarchy? Do we get a vote? https://t.co/TiFg6dUaV5
@freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends When did we become a Kritarchy? Did I miss an email?
@Argggenough3 @bryan_helten @benshapiro No, said it was contradictory. I don't support Trump. I wasn't disputing the statement, just the article. It does what all Democrats try to do - lump every aspect of a group into one category, no matter if it has to lie or not.
@Argggenough3 @bryan_helten @benshapiro Is it now time to point out that the wikipedia "article" contradicts itself 7 times, just to stuff the word Right on top of other pages that talk about Leftism?
@Independent Of course? That's how he makes a living.
@WSJ @greg_ip Yes. Because too many senators have most of their money spread around the world.
@KindObserver What they keep showing pictures of is nothing more than a housing. Not a gun.
@KindObserver If you want a printer that can print a plastic polymer able to withstand the gas expansion of even a .22 LR shell... no.		See above.		The chamber, pin, feed mechanism, trigger mechanism cannot be made of plastic. Why undetected guns are made of armor grade ceramics.
@_7H3_W1Z4RD_ @thehill I like you. :) I'm a social liberal, fiscal conservative, all around libertarian. I get to see the sickness that both sides fling at each other, mostly because it flies over my own sick little foxhole.
@Cernovich @mattgaetz Wait until Monday, we've ordered all new Samsung phones for our employees and we intend to terminate out iPhones and service. Then it gets expensive.
@_7H3_W1Z4RD_ @thehill You've classic liberals - not bad people at all. Then you have Leftists. Their entire twitter is hatred against someone (recently Trump), they even attack Democrats who aren't far enough Left on the political spectrum, cheer when Antifa burn down buildings and assault people. Etc
@_7H3_W1Z4RD_ @thehill Have you paid ANY attention to Twitter? Or social media at all for about 2 years? Democrats scream if you say anything about a leftist woman, but they call right leaning women the most foul, degrading things on the planet. They do the same to black Republicans.
@socialcontraire @thehill "We know X. If only we had PROOF of X! Nah, screw proof." -Translation
@thehill Omarosa: "I had a call with these two women."	Two Woman: "No? We didn't?"	Democrats: "Lying, feckless c***s. We know all Republican woman are stupid, pregnant breeders. Who can trust them?"		Democrats now days.
@thehill Waiting for proof of who any of the people are for the next 30 years.
@thehill San Francisco and Ethics don't mix.
@Cernovich @mattgaetz Alex is bat sh** insane. Always has been. However, that said, his censorship is sheer hypocrisy on the left since the MSM shrieked over Twitter accounts blocking people. My wife and I ended a 150k/yr contract with iTunes, over this, through our business.
@KB805 @MSNBC I agree with you - but not in the way you like, so I am a troll. This is why Democrats defeat themselves. Have a nice day. Also 34 years in Texas.
@CNN @AnushayHossain @CNNOpinion How?
@michaeljknowles They've no idea. It is todays version of Nazi, since that one backfired. Racist backfired. They just need something to call people they disagree with, since actually trying to debate people fails so quickly for them.
@KB805 @RWPUSA @deanbphillips Precisely. Which is an arguement that I, myself, fully support. Before he started spouting Democrat slogans I was very fond of Beto.		I made a simple statement, and somehow that was twisted into an arguement of how he is better than Cruz... which is pointless since I agree.
@KB805 @RWPUSA @deanbphillips You keep bringing up Cruz for some reason. No one else is discussing Cruz. Yes... that is easily seen without leaving the Summary. You are missing a big point here...
@KB805 @RWPUSA @deanbphillips The point being that him not accepting any PAC donations is not exactly new for a Representative. If he does the same as a senator I will be surprised.
@KB805 @RWPUSA @deanbphillips Indeed! And he has a good deal of support in Texas. The largest chunks of money, however, are from companies not from Texas. While no PAC donations (admirable) the figure is closer to 54% being from external sources.
@KB805 @RWPUSA @deanbphillips I never said I support Cruz, either. Haven't for over a decade. I was merely pointing at what was said HERE.  		https://t.co/wf9VJ8im1a
@Independent Why are leftists so ashamed to show their faces? Never "protest" someone or something if you can't even put your face behind it.
@NBCPolitics @oneunderscore__ Personally I find it hilarious. Just saying.
@RWPUSA @BetoORourke @deanbphillips @BetoORourke accepts most of his money from OUTSIDE of Texas, however, because he made nothing IN Texas.
@mitchellreports @GeoffRBennett Not only that but if the "tape" she claims she has actually existed @mitchellreports would already have it linked to Twitter... same as every news outlet.
@OfficeOfMike If the tape existed it would be on muscily, iTunes, and every news network in the country. Why I figure it doesn't.
@darrensands If this tape existed, it would be on every news network, https://t.co/o0jV96BbbK and itunes.
@Albert_Camus14 @washingtonpost They only care when they don't have anything else to throw at him
@washingtonpost I'm guessing that WaPo knows we actually have better climate laws in our country than the Paris Accord demanded of us... also guessing they don't care.
@thehill Hmmm... wonder why THAT could be...
@thehill Buuuuuut... you people elected them.
@CNN Most of us are bored with it, to be honest. The Mueller Team has purposely stated with every series of indictments "we don't think any Americans had anything to do with this." To wit the left screams "IMPEACH," and the right screams "GOOD GUY." Both are wrong.
@FoxNews Democrats are guilty of double think? Who knew.
@axios Wouldn't you?
@raymondalaneve @mark_msmith856 @RepLanceNJ7 Lol
@raymondalaneve @mark_msmith856 @RepLanceNJ7 The problem with white supremacists, nazis, etc... attacking them proves their point - at least to their sick thinking. Already feeling under assault, when they are assaulted, the moderates amongst them who can still see logic if it's presented get blinded by anger. Like Antifa.
This. This is why I am currently condemning the Left far more than I condemn the Right. Once you reach the far ends you find the difference between misguided and truly evil. https://t.co/l3NLQdzKL4
@washingtonpost So... he bought expensive stuff. That is mostly the rundown of this so far.
@MarlaHooch1 @Lawrence @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon As someone who isn't white... I preferred people being color blind rather than assuming I'm a leftist in real life and a republican trump supporter on Twitter. Back when the value of an arguement meant more than how I looked.
@Lawrence @SenWarren @CynthiaNixon This is the same woman who politely said blacks cannot keep up in the education system and pushed for lower passing grades... sounds a lot like a racist to me.
@woody_tobias @jaketapper Yeahhhhh you're just looking for a fight, despite someone agreeing with you. Just not saying what you are saying angrily enough for you. Have a nice day.
@GaryThatcher14 @freedom_moates You aren't in a position of high authority and in charge of two of the most critical cases in the past 50 years. No one cares what you text.
@freedom_moates GOP turning their full attention on Mueller in 3... 2... (realized the glares are already there)
@woody_tobias @jaketapper No... I just agreed he should go to prison for murder. Try re-reading my reply.
You show me the kid with a quarter million dollar 3d printer, the materials to feed it, and the extra gun parts that can't be made of plastic... and I will show you a rich kid who isn't going out shooting people. https://t.co/ISRYOgT1iu
@MeetThePress Welcome to the reality of the Democratic Party.
@Newsweek You show me the kid with a quarter million dollar 3d printer, the materials to feed it, and the extra gun parts that can't be made of plastic... and I will show you a rich kid who isn't going out shooting people.
@woody_tobias @jaketapper How is a law that allows you to protect the life of you or family, but only if you yourself/family members are in danger... a bad law? He should go to jail, and personally I feel it should be murder. When he shot the guy the threat was over.
@woody_tobias @jaketapper Do you have any idea what the law IS?
I had to actually research the picture. It is actually not surprising to find that the places with the strictest gun laws are the most violent in the nation. https://t.co/iz6RxZuUTz
@jaketapper Turns out it wasn't self defense. Contrary to leftist opinion, stand your ground laws do not equate the wild west.
@mitchellreports @jmclaughlinSAIS It isn't supposed to.
@thehill Now THIS is a good solution
@Strandjunker @HuffPost He really didn't, if you actually watch the hearing.
@HuffPost Still fired.
@johnnyrwhitsett @dbongino The FBI has its own internal policies to meet before letting someone go. Their main office is not in an At Will Hire area.
@nprpolitics Hard to remember bs, even when you write it down. Why the Media tends to tell a different story from the ones they told a year ago.
@mark_msmith856 @RepLanceNJ7 If you attempt to get rid of hate, through violence, you create more hate. It's proven true for the entirety of human history.
@Kristen_Not_Wig @RepLanceNJ7 Try a better source. https://t.co/enBWbjxdQx
@creynol350 @dhays553616 @ThisWeekABC @MSNBC @ABC @thehill @CNN It isn't MY video. You asked where I first found it. Try using google, like I did, to verify or deny information. Your opinion means nothing.
@creynol350 @dhays553616 @ThisWeekABC @MSNBC @ABC @thehill @CNN Initially from below, then set off to confirm it elsewhere.		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill And your behavior is of a leftist troll with a very sad life. Have a good day.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill There were even protests for God's sake.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill You seriously need to look that one up. They were NOT detained with their parents. @MSNBC has plenty of articles on it from 2014.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill Lmfao. I am from Texas, the Choctaw reservation. The fact that I can easily disprove your statements, so you jump to the fact that i am Russian, is pathetic.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill 89,000 children were kept in cages under the Obama administration. That's an objective fact. Now then. Try again.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill African countries are shit holes... they are also only half of the black nations on earth. I saw him call MS13 rapists and criminals, if you actually watch the entire video and not what MSNBC posted. 7 Muslim countries, and not even the most populous... 7 countries Obama listed.
@drabbott66 @ABC You also need to take European opinions on American politics with a grain of salt. To the European political spectrum the Right is Authoritarian and the Left is anarchy. In the USA it is the opposite. Being as they are looking from the outside, they base ideas on that.
@drabbott66 @ABC One psychological analysis doesn't really apply, since I have one saved for the comedy of it that shows Democrats are all scientologists due to similarities of modus operandi and social structure.
@MyCharlestonPad @thehill Let me see a few of those videos? I've watched a ton, have yet to see a racist one. Sexist? Yes. Stupid? Yes. Racist? Not yet.
@Intense_XEnergy @ABC Not really sure how that applies to anything.
@_CrimsonAvenger @thehill What's odd to me is that she recorded a perfectly polite conversation, but nothing of Trump being racist. Despite supposedly having so many recordings.
@thehill And she should be in prison. That said, if you listen to the recording, Kelly was nothing but polite. How about she show the tape of Trump saying something racist? If she supposedly recorded so much...
@Independent How... pathetic.
@drabbott66 @ABC It makes them ignorant.
@drabbott66 @ABC Ahh, them. The group isn't really so large, but it is large enough to be uncomfortable. Here in Texas we don't actually really have that group, as it sesms to more be to our east. They aren't really, by the numbers, his base... that said it also doesn't really make them racist.
@CWW72 @ABC Democrats call some Antifa very fine people. They're both wrong.
@drabbott66 @ABC Those neo nazis voted Democrat 12 years ago. Hard to call them a base when they swing back and forth. David Drake supported Trump this time around, other KKK leaders supported Hilary.
@ABC Democrats: "We want Trump to denounce racism!!"	Trump: "Didn't think I needed to state the obvious? I dont support racists."	Democrats: "LIAR!!!"
@thehill For which she should go to prison. However, the funny thing? If you listen to the recording, it was nothing but polite.
@clnfairfax @thehill Yes. We do. And we can ignore a few idiots and live our lives.
@thehill He's right. Those of us who aren't racist don't give a f*** about race to sit and discuss it every day.
@realmansplainer @CBSNews Nah, they were down in Charlottesville celebrating the anniversary. Most leftist outlets have ignored it because they attacked an NBC reporter.
@CBSNews And it stayed mostly peaceful... this is how this situation SHOULD go. Incidentally, in Charlottesville for 2 days, Antifa was assaulting people and destroying property to celebrate the anniversary.
@politico It changed the facts that A: you made racist rednecks famous for the first time in 50 years, and B: now we can't stop talking about racist rednecks.
@icefire99 @Hadding_ @ParamjitGarewal @DineshDSouza Use a better source, as even that Snopes article says he said many other racist things... BUT an @MSNBC reporter thinks he only said them to get other racist democrats to support him.
@icefire99 @Hadding_ @ParamjitGarewal @DineshDSouza https://t.co/JrEA6l3Wuh
Either congress is terrified of Antifa... or they secretly do not mind the masked thugs using violence to silence others. Both are terrifying prospects. https://t.co/wMzJ6a4lgt
@RepLanceNJ7 So... condemn Antifa, too? Let's start by getting rid of violence. Then we can get rid of hate.
@HuffPost More pointy boobed pics of Marilyn hitting the net in 3...2...1...
@guardian That's what God thought of the opening act.
RT @charliekirk11: This is the face of the Democrat party		White liberals swearing, accosting, and taunting a black majority police force…
@xmr13x @KevinMDoris @Fremdschaemen76 @ABC That said... the Left likes to play with the idea of Socialism. Which still hasn't actually worked, even in Europe, but European nations have come closer to making it work than any others... in culturally homogeneous nations. If you want socialism to work, you need a shared view.
@xmr13x @KevinMDoris @Fremdschaemen76 @ABC Did you have that Democrat slogan copied? Doesn't make you wrong, however. I think where they become confused is that immigrants who share our vision and dream should not only be welcomed... but we need them. Conversely we do not need those who do not share them.
@creynol350 @dhays553616 @ThisWeekABC @MSNBC @ABC @thehill @CNN I monitor 94 outlets across the USA lol...the four prime Leftist networks are no where near all there is.
@oriole7574 @ABC I'd google the word, though as a "lawyer" it saddens me if you believe the word only means race.
@rhonda_harbison @thehill Nope. Condemning them both.
@xmr13x @KevinMDoris @Fremdschaemen76 @ABC Personally? I think she made a stupid rich girl comment, and was likely meaning a shift in cultural demographics. While I highly doubt that she is actually racist, I am fairly certain she is an elitist snob that is very unhappy with her neighborhood changing. (Moved for both)
@mikemnyc @ABC There ARE good white nationalists... they have evil beliefs. Like Louis Farrakhan who is an open antisemit... but also a fairly decent person. People can be dualistic in nature - in fact most people are.
@danisumerford @ABC David Duke also openly voted Democrat over Bush. Where are we going with that? The man is an imbecile.
@mikemnyc @ABC Im not a republican. That's just a common assumption about me because I am also not a Democrat.
@mikemnyc @ABC Also:  https://t.co/XPuJKYCWTY
@mikemnyc @ABC No, they really aren't. Only in the inner cities. Blacks that are republicans are the worst recipients in this nation today of racism... from Democrats. You can see it here on Twitter if you watch. They scream racism endleasly and loudly, and laugh about it over cocktails. https://t.co/hnCg0EG94g
@mikemnyc @ABC No. I see racism from Democrats climbing to the point that a NY Daily Caller personality called Dak Prescott a "lemonade serving negro" and other democrats cheered. You're simply blind to where the racism IS.
@mikemnyc @ABC If you mean complaining about demographic changes... the word demographics means around 50 criteria  other than Race. It means ONLY race if you want to find Racism.
@tom_news2 @mlportn @ABC Cute how that works. According to you lefties I can't be racist since I'm not white.
@mikemnyc @ABC She didn't actually say anything racist. Point to the quote or segment.
@Fremdschaemen76 @ABC Which is possibly true! And the instance she actually says something racist I will be among the first to demand that she is off the air. However, conjecture is not enough to deem someone racist... or shouldn't be.
@royster47 @ABC Being as I think Donald Trump is a narcissistic asshole, the fact you assume I support Trump because I don't think every white person is secretly racist is amusing.
@jeannefisher17 @MSNBC I could send you a copy? 		https://t.co/pnao0IkGdH
@mlportn @ABC I listened to them, too, and while my opinion that she's a ditzy blonde with as much intelligence as my cat... Still haven't found the racism in her segment.
@ABCPolitics That's because Lefties are all psychic geniuses who can see the objective 11th dimensional reality since they are all so Woke, and will say they know what she REALLY was thinking.
@CNN And the counter protesters mostly stayed peaceful. This is how this SHOULD go.
@ABC Mostly because the leftists "know what she was REALLY thinking." Because they are all psychic geniuses who are the only ones to see 11th dimensional reality.
@rhonda_harbison @thehill That in no way counters what I said.
@nanettee60 @MSNBC No. Just logical. Thanks to a "condition" I don't have emotions to get in the way of looking at situations objectively. Democrats spout more vile, open racism every day than any other group in the nation.
@MSNBC Let's talk about which party is, in actuality, racist... https://t.co/UbEH0bEEo5
@MarkTimms81 @DineshDSouza No, I am hung up on the fact that socialists of other leanings, non-practicing Jews, and others were left completely alone by the Nazis. They only harassed actual communists and practicing Jews.
@ParamjitGarewal @DineshDSouza Going with this, personally... https://t.co/cFpGC2SOUL
@Johnny_Congress @AdamSchiffCA @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOPChairwoman @TuckerCarlson @EricTrump @mike_pence I'd vote for anyone that ISN'T Adam Schiff at this point, just so I can quit seeing that stupid face reciting party slogans.
@MarkTimms81 @DineshDSouza It doesn't matter what they BECAME. What they started as was a socialist party. They maintained that line until their end. I like how people look back at these situations and say "well, THEY weren't real socialists because of X"
@MarkTimms81 @DineshDSouza You can laugh, but the Nazis were socialist.
@thehill Democrats have shown more open racism in the past 10 years than Neo Nazis have... and yet are always the ones calling others racists.
@MarkTimms81 @DineshDSouza He was a socialist. Which, so were the nazis.
@Compos_mentis01 @charliekirk11 Nope. I cited the sources. You get to read the data.
@Compos_mentis01 @charliekirk11 US DoJ, FBI statistics, DHS statistics... take a pick and grab a google.
@o_marianne @charliekirk11 US DoJ
@charliekirk11 You could literally show every court document from the past 25 years. Spend a year counting the cases, and verify the numbers PRECISELY... and leftists would ask for your source, then say you were lying.
@DineshDSouza I am not sure people understand who the Nazis WERE. One idiot for NBC claimed Albert Einstein would have been in a Nazi Camp... despite not having been a praciting jew and having attended catholic school.
@kenolin1 I'm still waiting on you to repost your tweet from earlier trying to claim Trump supporters are the ones pushing segregation... despite it being Democrats who keep openly pushing races apart.
@thehill Antifa terrorists also attacked an NBC reporter last night, too, but admitting that would be to admit they aren't the 'good guys' you play them off as.	https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@CNNPolitics Good for her! About time the boys realized some chicks could kick our asses. Granted in the Army we knew that lol
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics Nothing new there. Why you people can't ignore them is what confuses me.
@creynol350 @dhays553616 @ThisWeekABC That really is my only issue. It happened last night, and plenty of outlets reported it. Just not @MSNBC ,@ABC ,@thehill  or @CNN. The story doesnt fit their narrative, so they will ignore it. Just like they did last year
@redsteeze Mostly because democrats like to lie until someone spits out the truth... then the new truth was ALWAYS the truth, and pointing out the past lies are the new lies.
@alexissmirks @redsteeze Exactly.
@SkarlKarl @thehill Are you a racist?
@Geek_Prince @TIME ... is that they spend 3-6 months unhappy with each other, make a decision that it "just isn't working," and give up. They expected their marriage to always be happy.
@Geek_Prince @TIME We hit a wall back when we were 19, we've been dating since we were 14. I know I'm in a lucky one, and no I know that marriage will not last for everyone... not exactly zealous about religion myself. However one of the hardest parts of marriages that I have watched fall apart...
@Geek_Prince @TIME It's never static. I said easy. Yes, people grow and people change, and if they do not change together there can be rocky patches. Accepting that you will not ALWAYS be happy, that marriage is not a thing in the clouds, and you can grow back together.
@freedom_moates @thehill @antifa Wait, wait...		https://t.co/kf3Yi5tIFM
@Journo_Christal @redsteeze Burning of the Reichstag! I've been waiting!
@Geek_Prince @TIME 33. Married for 12 years. I just happen to have entered it the right way.
@freedom_moates @thehill is the Sturmabeilung.	@antifa are the Brown Shirts.		Who else is waiting for them to burn down the Reichstag? In this instance I'm guessing something in D.C.
@redsteeze Yeah, I noticed that the wide spread, and growing, Nazi movement turned out to be 30 jackasses.		https://t.co/URvAb6BAHQ
@TIME Marriage is easy. Assuming you actually waited to get to know the person.
@creynol350 @dhays553616 @ThisWeekABC They're beinf attacked by the people they are claiming are the "good guys." Mostly because it's a lie.
@thehill Yeah..	 All 30 of them. The WIDE SPREAD racist movement. Who were 30 rednecks. 		https://t.co/URvAb6BAHQ
@ThisWeekABC https://t.co/OKIUCdqHTJ
Is it me or is @MSNBC guilty of letting it's journalists be assaulted, and don't say a word, just to keep a narrative? How could you work for these people?		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@ABCPolitics How about this?		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@MSNBC Still skipping over last night...		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@MSNBC You guys are just gonna skip this from last night, huh?		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@freedom_moates And you told me my comment yesterday was uncalled for. Lol. Yet, both of our comments are true.
@jaketapper @TerryMcAuliffe We're just gonna ignore last night, huh?		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@thehill Pretty certain that the administration had nothing to do with it, since only the secretary was appointed by Trump. All the analysts and adjuticators have been there for years.
@ABC How about covering TODAY in Virginia?		https://t.co/lMwVJcnRfo
@DLoesch Just now figuring out that Antifa is not on the side of the media?
@WSJ Don't... network... the voting machines. Done.
@thehill I'd brace for the fight the "counter protesters" are going to start... or do you not see the rage in the face of the bystanders?
@shabbus @NateSilver538 Look at my replies to Kyle.
@AdamBaldwin Their best candidate - This is true. Not sure about "saving the country," since he acts just like Trump, just counter pointed.
@RWonkins @passion_4truth @thehill Wait, me or that one?
@thehill @Lawrence is rather an idiot, too.
@thehill Unsure anyone who works at @thehill get the idea that putting America first is not the same as isolationism.
@guardian When was it ever in question that Isreal was the jewish state?
@ThisWeekABC How will they know? Are we going to all start having to identify our political beliefs to move in society? Just a question.
@thehill Who'd have guessed? Oh...
@ABCPolitics No. Bout the same as always. The difference is that you made them famous. They used to just be rednecks who came out of the woods once a year.
@MSNBC Well, actually, her book said she NEVER heard him say anything like it. Then in an interview she said she heard him say it in person. THEN today she said she heard a TAPE of it. Sounds more like being paid "say this" money more than hush money.
@TMCCA_ @dbongino Which, at that point, taxes increase AGAIN to pay them.
@jamesclossick @lej2343 @BrandyG700 @thehill Looking at your twitter... you have NEVER provided sources.
@jamesclossick @lej2343 @BrandyG700 @thehill The first two. The last one is true
@PerrytheDoofens @RobertLConley @Sherry63K @thehill I'm actually a policy conservative, social libertarian lol. Thus I don't mind calling out both Republicans and Democrats for their racist members that they fail to denounce.
@connordpeters @CNN Not yet. Probably will, though it will be like Martha Stewart... same crime, and now same amount of coverage.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @FBI @JudicialWatch @hannity @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews You said this twice already. This is the third. Don't act like @thehill . I actually like you.
@thehill The concept of Chain Migration isn't the problem, the problem is that people figured out how to use it to bring in 10-20 people at a time.
@Bandrel @Reuters He said it a year ago, if you look up the articles.
@Reuters He said that a year ago. Nobody listened. Just like today.
@jamesclossick @BrandyG700 @thehill Yep, those pictures were from 2014, and MOST outlets retracted them. Yes, he is an utter jackass. No, I'd say Wilson was the worst presidential decision the people have ever made.
@TheEconomist Easily. There are sham elections all over the world.
@tedcruz @DineshDSouza Screw those Calvary Scouts. Don't question why I know they're stationed there...
@historBilia @PerrytheDoofens @thehill Guessing you have no idea the history of the Democratic Party... even very very recent history.
@RobertLConley @Sherry63K @PerrytheDoofens @thehill Penny for the guy.
@thehill "Look at us!! We're @thehill and we've got absolutely nothing but a bunch of anger towards Trump, but all out shots at him have failed! Look. He might chew on paper like 23 out of 100 people!!"
@dbongino They'd need jobs before they could pay more taxes.
@cloroxgal @jamesclossick @thehill Also - it isn't whataboutism in any way? He said "Trump did X." We said "No, he did not do X, soandso did X." Not "Well, what about when soandso did it, too?"
@cloroxgal @jamesclossick @thehill It DID exist then. Sadly most people have the attention span of a goldfish, which is why the media managed to make half the country shift that anger 2 years and onto Trump.
@thehill More celebrity idolizing? Sad.
@Newsweek I generally don't condemn Nazis in my day to day dealings, either. Mostly because I feel no NEED to condemn what everyone already knows to be evil and ignorant.
@PerrytheDoofens @thehill Democrats had a Grand Wizard for a Chairman until 8 years ago. Who's base, again?
@thehill You mean the Chairman of the DNC until 2010? Oh, that was a Grand Wizard. Sorry, got the two mixed up.
@jamesclossick @thehill Brandy said it first. Those pictures were all from 2014... Obamas administration.
@HuffPost You guys are REALLY late on this one. Just saying.
@andrewklavan The hard part is getting the sea otter to sit still long enough to tie those danged things in a knot. They always get playful halfway through.
@thehill Which immigration policies? Not allowing illegal immigrants across the border? Seems to be the only policy people have a problem with.
@guardian They've only been deadly, for nearly 50 years, when people show up to start fights with these rednecks.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @FBI @JudicialWatch It's mostly because the FBI is terrified to show what it's leadership became under Obama.
@business @bopinion *BUZZZZZ* Sorry! That was the incorrect answer. Please play again when one of your economists are at work. Stop doing these articles on the weekends.
@Newsweek This is the photo from BEFORE Donnie J decided he was funny. @CNN disagrees with your deficit idea. https://t.co/cPOwTlH1rQ
@allisonBeDemure @SenSanders 2013 Iceland begins severe Austerity Measures.	2016 Iceland performs a massive rollback of government programs.
@SenSanders You mean by doubling the taxes of everyone in the United States?  Of course it would save dollars... for all your jobless voters.
@IngrahamAngle @SCMPNews They could just have dinner with @SenFeinstein and pleasantly chat about all this. I'm sure something could be worked out. Maybe her husband pays more in taxes to China?
@thehill Good! Why this is news, I am not sure. They have the right to refuse service, so they are using it. Only reason you're reporting it is because it's against the redneck idiots that NONE of us like.
@andrewklavan Look... at... her eyes! Why does no one but me notice the absolute insanity in her eyes? Maybe it's because I stayed in a mental ward for 30 days...
