@cspan @RepJerryNadler Smarmy bastard. That's not sweat on Whitaker's brow, it's contempt for the proceedings oozing out of him like pus from a fetid wound. I think he watched the Kavanaugh hearings as part of his preparation.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary I watched the Whitaker hearing today and I have questions: 	-Why didn't anyone ask him whether Trump asked for his loyalty or how he voted in 2016? 	-Why put up with his attitude? Why not warn him once &amp; then find him in contempt? Because contemptuous is what he was.
@cspan @RepJerryNadler I was surreptitiously listening to the hearing while working and was so shocked by Whitaker's disrespect that I made an extended gasp. It's as if Whitaker's prep included watching the Kavanaugh hearings, in order to fine-tune the degree of his disdain for the Dem members.
