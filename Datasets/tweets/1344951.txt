Fortunately, there are many people inside &amp; outside of the AI community working to draw attention to biased algorithms and find ways to detect and fix them. So while algorithms can absolutely be biased‚Äîjust like with people we can do something about it. 8/ https://t.co/GtbGDNN82Q
Why does this keep happening? One reason is that data used to train algorithms tends to reflect historical biases in society. It might also be a reflection of how the world‚Äôs pool of AI researchers is not very diverse: only an estimated 12% women. 7/ https://t.co/13HIU3Vcm8
When the algorithms were put to the test, Microsoft‚Äôs could identify the lightest male faces in a collection of photos as men every time. When shown darker female faces, the service mis-gendered them 21 percent of the time. Both companies say they have improved their services. 6/
Here‚Äôs another example of biased algorithms: Last year, researchers showed that Microsoft and IBM were selling face analysis services that were much less accurate for dark skinned women than light skinned men. 5/ https://t.co/ditACpI0W7
Part of Google‚Äôs solution was to make Photos blind to gorillas and chimps altogether, to prevent it applying those labels to people. The fact even Google can‚Äôt trust its AI algorithms shows the trickiness of this problem: algorithms lack common sense. 4/ https://t.co/Un7lxEUx7B

Machine learning algorithms pick up patterns in data, including when those patterns reflect societal biases. Researchers found two photo collections used in AI research had a gender bias in who was shown doing activities such as cooking and sports. 2/ https://t.co/WJVj3GsFwe
