@DailyCaller @KamalaHarris The Democrats fabricated the Laramie Project/ Matthew Shepard murder claiming it was gay hatred crime.  Obama even signed a Matthew Shepard act in 2009. But the truth came out later it was a drug deal gone bad, not a hate crime. Maybe the Dems could stop Wagging the Dog!
@charliekirk11 It's a false dilemma. Capitalists recognize the failure to the system. We don't live in a Capitalist society. We live in a mixed society... Capitalism with a safety net. Pure Socialism will fail, just as pure free market economy failed before. We have achieved pareto optimality.
@RealJamesWoods Remember when @BarackObama signed the Matthew Shepard Act of 2009 based upon a drug deal gone bad that was twisted into a gay hate crime? Feds came in and had the court issue gag orders to cover up the false claims.  https://t.co/HVmV4VhpMI

@WGrundler @BambinoPearce @DineshDSouza To be fair, the battle for the sneakiest most ruthless normally happens in Congress.
@SenSchumer According to Senate reports, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors arrive at the US border every year. Many of them are victims of human trafficking. You are enabling traffickers without adequate border security. Illegal immigration costs $116 billion per year. #integrity
@RealJamesWoods @KamalaHarris According to research by https://t.co/m8KWWiX2h9 Illegal immigration costs the U.S. $116 billion per year. Just think about all the American children in poverty and homeless veterans that money could be helping. Or how about paying off our massive debt #integrity
@StephenKing Writing another storyline for the next book? Here is a horror fact for you. Illegal immigration costs the U.S. $116 billion per year. Just think how many children and vets could be helped with that #integrity
In any relationship, if you create common goals, work towards achieving those goals, you will be successful. When it comes to politics, the left calls the right Nationalist and the right calls the left Communist. Unless we find common ground, the US will cease to exist #integrity

@BambinoPearce @amyrlin53 @DineshDSouza Answer the question.... is your family Anglo-Saxon?
@FreedomWorks @KevinARing @SenTomCotton Repubs freed the slaves, gave them the vote, and gave women the right to vote. It was the Democrats that encouraged slavery, and who support Islam today, who continue to enslave people in Africa. LBJ created them and JCE/WJC imprisoned them. Incarceration incentives need to end.
@amyrlin53 @BambinoPearce @DineshDSouza The problem is that under our law, there are religious exceptions. While these laws are mostly designed under 1st Amendment rights, and Christianity is the majority religion, I fear it could open the door for some Sharia law exceptions. Loopholes will be exploited.
When Public Policy creates negative side effects upon a certain demographic, it is the government's responsibility to correct that action. Slaves were freed, women earned the vote, and family unity should be restored again. The family is the smallest unit of society. #integrity
It is one thing to be politically opposed to a @POTUS  But to actively try to undermine everything @POTUS does, critique his every move, and then go after his family, is disgraceful. America has become the Nation of hate. Strengthen family values, you strengthen the country.
@BambinoPearce @MrGQ37 @DineshDSouza And to your point about English not being labeled as the official language, all that means is that you aren't required to learn English to live here. That needs to change. Legal immigrants should be mandated to learn English in order to earn their voting rights.
@BambinoPearce @MrGQ37 @DineshDSouza There is no need for being racist here Steven. Pearce is an Anglo-Saxon name, is it not?
@BambinoPearce @MrGQ37 @DineshDSouza Yes you have a right to practice a religion. But that doesn't give you the right to infringe on someone else's right to practice their religion. The issue at hand are religions exceptions which I believe should be banned altogether.
@BambinoPearce @DineshDSouza Assimilate into our culture and beliefs. When immigrants do not assimilate, and have completely different values, different laws, we no longer are a nation, but a collection of nation states operating within a border. It creates radical thought and conflict.
@CatoInstitute Teachers no longer teach. They are facilitators of government curriculum telling students what to think and no how to think. Studies have shown kids decline in divergent thinking after the start of their formal education.
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Religion, and ideology(political, culture, etc), are often forced upon children by their parents. I would even categorize feminism as a religion of sorts.
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Agreed. The Living Constitution agenda is promoted by socialists. Google Roscoe Pound and Sociological Jurisprudence. Harvard Law Dean hated the Constitution and Nazi Germany gave him an award for his ideology.
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr "Family values, work ethic, manners, integrity" these are what are missing in society But do you understand why the 1st Amend gave us Freedom of Religion? Not even all Christians agree on scripture. Forcing religion upon someone today is just as bad as making everyone Protestant
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Gian, do you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights?
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Seems like you are both agreeing on the problem, just not the solution. Though socialism is promoted in Universities, the capitalist - socialist debate is a false dichotomy used to distract. The U.S. is a mixed economy. Essentially a capitalist society with a safety net.
@GianKeys @CriticalRiposte @DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Brainwashing claims can made from both sides. The problem with EDU in general is that we are not taught how to think, but what to think. Studies suggest divergent thinking decreases as formal education increases. Socialism had a stronghold in Universities since the early 1900s

@DineshDSouza @GOP @JerryFalwellJr Dinesh, I agree. GOP gave blacks and women the right to vote also. But who do they mostly vote for now? Do you understand why? As Americans, we need to find common ground and build on that. Our culture has an infestation of immorality and a lack of self respect.
@FreedomWorks @MarcALevin @RightOnCrime @TPPF Criminal justice is an industry, just like the $50 billion/yr  divorce industry. Private prisons have lock up guarantee clauses at 80% capacity in the contracts. Cost to incarcerate $33k/yr yet poverty rate is $12k/yr. If you invest in people and strengthen families, crime drops
@JohnLegere Very few things in this world are free. You would contribute more to society by making people earn their phone, just as those people who actually built the phone earned their salary through blood, sweat, and tears. Remember, respect is earned. #integrity
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the media encourages partisan politics for the click. The 1st Amendment doesn't allow someone to run into a building and yell fire merely to cause a reaction. That's what the media is doing. We need a Truth in Media Act that separates fact from opinion. #integrity
@gunther1970h2 @BambinoPearce @DineshDSouza Yet we currently rank 24th in Science and Reading, and 30th in Math globally. American kids today no longer believe in the American dream. Families are destroyed by policy and the $50 billion /yr divorce industry while the buying power of the American dollar has decreased.
@CNN @smerconish National average for incarceration costs are $33k/yr yet poverty rate is set at $12k/yr. We have private prisons requiring 80% lock up guarantees. Shouldn't we be investing in people who can pay into SSI instead of creating criminals at taxpayer expense? #integritypolicy
@Honor_C0de @redsteeze @DonaldJTrumpJr LBJ's War on Poverty created more poverty among single parent homes, which is the direct result of trading fathers in for a government paycheck. Divorce increased. It also led to Mass incarceration in the 70s -80s. All Dem policies.  Check out this book https://t.co/DYEuGRCooC
@DineshDSouza The American male has been so emasculated by the family court industry, the criminal justice industry, and the feminist movement that it is very doubtful a patriotic resistance will come to fruition. Especially since we lack common ground with immigrants who don't assimilate.
Laws are generally a reactive approach to address an issue. this merely creates criminals. To be free, one must have integrity. If we truly believe in a free society, we must teach about morality/ integrity, and hold those without integrity accountable starting w/ Congress

@CatoInstitute Public Policy, or a lack thereof, often creates societal problems. The more problems a society has, the more jobs it creates, mostly out of fear. This expands the need for more govt, more public spending, and less Freedom. We need to undo the damage created by govt. #integrity
@redsteeze @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe if we worked more on finding common ground instead of letting our emotions fly, we might be able to save the Republic. De Tocqueville warned us about what would destroy America and our version of democracy. If you want change, demand a Truth in Media Act. #integrity
@TomFitton In order to save the Republic, we must hold accountable those who violate public trust. It doesn't matter left or right. If half of Congress goes down with Hillary, as she suggested, so be it!

@Heritage This is an opinion piece. Both sides accuse each other of voter fraud. In some cases it is valid. In others, it is merely political rhetoric. Several current lawsuits allege voter fraud by the Dems. If fraud is legit, they should be prosecuted and voting held again. #integrity
@BKPragmat @APEastRegion @AP While your statement is true, there are currently other ways to deal with remains. This issue is more of a lack of integrity and respect that is not longer taught at home. Strengthen the family unit, and crime is significantly reduced. The problem is crime creates jobs.

@UN_Women Feminists are constantly in a state of self victimization, like the covert narcissist seeking an empath to feed their needs. Rights come with responsibility and accountability. One who cannot accept the latter, should not be empowered with the former. #Equality
