RT “@wfaachannel8: Famed North Texas pianist Van Cliburn has died, the @startelegram reports. More information soon.”

Asked by Hunt if she should have disclosed Trinity East deal Suhm says looking back now "would've helpful."
@AngelaHunt says after 8 yrs on council she now "mistrusts" Suhm for briefing council no parkland drilling after deal to try to make happen.
Dallas CM @AngelaHunt grills Suhm for deal she would help driller get approval for parkland w/o telling council in 8/08.	Calls "dishonest."
Asked by Mayor @Mike_Rawlings Suhm says she followed what the council majority wanted and that was lease to Trinity East to drill.
@MaryKSuhm says was her intent no parkland but included knowing it would still need special use permit appoval later from council.
CM Griggs recounts how Suhm, staff told council in '08  no parkland drilling. "Troubling" public, council told one thing Suhm does another.
Perkins conclusion gives Suhm legal cover but not political cover entirely. Expect sharp ques from drilling foes CM Griggs, Hunt.
Dallas City Council had expressed it did not want surface drilling on parkland. Suhm says prop records slow update didn't record 22 acres.

The times we live in. Dallas City Council approves $80.6K for 2 X-ray inspection machines for increased security at city hall.
Enjoy the arches! Cost of I-30 McDermott bridge design now $115M from $74M orig.  Mostly paid by US, city/county, RTC $. Some private.
Dallas City Council passes funding plan 10-2 for I-30 McDermott bridge cost overrun. City adds $1.9M along with private, $2M county $.
Dallas City Council chamber earmark friendly zone today. I-30 McDermott bridge over Trinity River will be built w/ $91M in fed earmark $.
But McDermott bridge/arches has many defenders for "signature" design. CM Atkins says in Big D we do things "big." Others think cost is big.
Dallas City Council mem Scott @griggs4dallas concerned 1% of total streets budget goes for maintaining Hunt, I-30 bridges. That's $600K/yr.
