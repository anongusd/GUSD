@CarolForden @ballerinaX Very fair question. Wish I had an answer (or that it was included in the article).

@CarolForden The state of Utah has a not-so-great record of supporting the underprivileged, working poor, and children with legislation (the Church typically handles that stuff).

If you hate your website or are considering a redesign you'll want to subscribe to my newsletter today. I'm going to share tips to make the process SO MUCH EASIER. The next email goes out tomorrow am. Subscribe! https://t.co/GSueHSuPkV
@freshbooks I know. That's been the tipping point for me. More clicks to add and edit time, modal that covers content, requires a click to move out of the way, NOT fewer clicks.
OMG This! GA is basic, core functionality of any site. Inexcusable if forgotten.		If they forget to install GA or push back in any way, get out of your contract STAT and hire someone to fix what they've messed up (because they will have screwed something else up). https://t.co/54T4IR6jzN
@freshbooks None of the suggestions have been implemented. The "cute" and extra clicks and hiding key information with modal windows has only gotten worse. It's discouraging and time-sucking. Editing an expense now takes 3x the clicks. This isn't good, or fast.
@freshbooks I've submitted multiple tickets with suggestions over the past year and submitted several bugs. I'm not big on repeating myself but thanks for the offer.
@Greeblehaus @freshbooks Fast and efficient, that's all I need. I don't need extra modal windows all over the place. I need it to log stuff, track stuff, and bill stuff (and for their QA team to not tell me I'm full of shit when I report a bug - yes, I cleared my cache).
@kristy @freshbooks I'm still on a legacy pro plan - still cheaper than quickbooks but quickly not becoming worth the extra time. There are better options that also handle proposals. I don't want cute and clicky, I want it to work quickly and efficiently.
Hi @freshbooks. I've used you guys for over 6 years now but I'm not loving your redesign. I've given it a solid chance You've sacrificed functionality for "cute" design and increased the number of clicks needed to perform basic tasks. I think we might be breaking up. #ItsYouNotMe

@amazon From advocating for the creation of duplicate accounts to support Prime/commerce and Kindle accounts, to elimination of the gifting of popular subscriptions, teens have no reason to trust Amazon with their time or money.
I've been an @amazon customer since 1997. I used to have the coffee mug to prove it (it wore out). It's become very clear that they have no desire to support the next generation of consumers (teens).
@AmazonHelp why can't I gift Kindle Unlimited? I've given this to my teen for THREE YEARS now and I'd like to renew the subscription. You guys are making it SO HARD to give you my money.

@deanshaw @chrisbrogan I disagree. I don't think they're designed to be difficult, I think they wind up becoming difficult and restrictive based on some shitty business decisions to place short term profits above return purchases. I'm a member of one program that I love and is easy to use.

@petit_elefant this is our first experience with one. 90% of the neighborhoods down here are gated and HOA-driven.
The next time I go to an HOA meeting, I'm bringing beer. Lots of beer.
I love supporting local businesses but this local bank's online system is so antiquated I may have to leave.

The state of SC did a fantastic job with the evacuation. The re-entry on a local/county level is an absolute shit show. Little communication
Just sitting in my car, drinking a beer and charging electronics..as one does when you don't know when the power will come back on.
Current status in hood: 90% glamping. Outside hood: 60% "The Stand" (but without the super flu and getting tormented by Randall Flagg).

@juleeslc nope. They were sold out at the Home Depot in Atlanta. We got one of the last chainsaws. We're almost to the county line now.
Tweeps. Any last minute supply recommendations for living 7-10 days without power? This is what I'm mentally prepping for. #glamping
@Greeblehaus thanks. I'll take all the good wishes and patience you care to throw my way. We're going to need it.
Beaufort county is still officially closed but  husband is a secondary responder. Interesting to see if we can enter. Expecting a shit show.
Going to try and get home today. Reports at the county line of roadblocks, rising tensions and generally poor behavior.

@wxnerd Not at all. It's scary.
@unculturedswine heh, yeah. Our area hasn't seen a hurricane for 10 years. Will be interesting to see what happens in the next 48 hrs.
@petit_elefant It's more nerve wracking than anything. It's got my Type-A over-planner personality in overdrive. :-)
@petit_elefant We're not "for sure" leaving yet, just getting ready to if we get the evac order. Would probably be Thursday.
Asked neighbor if they're planning on leaving - "Nope, gonna buy beer and have a hurricane party." Okay then. #TheSouth #HurricaneMatthew
@Jenndola possibly. Depends on track and strength.
@Jenndola we'll be far away when/if it hits, no worries! Just stressful.
Drive to Atlanta is normally 4 hours. We're planning on a 12+ hour drive. OMG, where's the xanax? #HurricaneMatthew

@matt_storms just because you live in or are from the south doesn't mean you're stupid.
I'm learning more about hurricanes and weather modeling than I ever wanted to. #HurricaneMatthew
@matt_storms "We're in evac zone A, what criteria needs to be met to issue a mand. evac? Cat 2, 3?" "I can't tell you that ma'am." Helpful.
@matt_storms The schools here are MUCH better than UT, so, they can read. I think it's just a power trip and holding info tight to the vest.
You know who's not helpful with information and guidelines? The South Carolina Emergency Management Division. So, that's awesome.
I accidentally made coffee strong enough to degrease engine parts. Happy Monday! #ZOOM
The phrase that causes me anxiety this weekend, "the cone of uncertainty." #HurricaneMatthew
Sometimes, a phone call from a good friend is all the therapy you need.
Well, I guess I'll double check my 72 hour kit and evacuation list this weekend. #Matthew
@alainashearer I bet it's beautiful with the changing leaves!
@alainashearer Our area hasn't been hit since 1999 (Floyd). So, that's good.
@alainashearer A direct path from a Cat 2 will trigger mandatory evac orders. Cat 1 everyone ignores evac orders and stays home.
