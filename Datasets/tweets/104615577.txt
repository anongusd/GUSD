Read our full analysis of today's budget and economic outlook at https://t.co/tAAvCXrJDZ
CBO continues to project strong economic growth for 2019, but real annual growth will fall below 2 percent for most of the decade.
The entire improvement can be attributed to two factors that may not ultimately materialize: lower assumed disaster spending and new tariffs imposed by the Administration.
Cumulative deficits through 2028 are projected to be $1.2 trillion lower under current law than in CBO’s last baseline from April 2018.
Growing deficits &amp; debt are the result of rising spending &amp; depressed revenue. Under current law, spending will grow from 20.3% of GDP in 2018 to 22.7% by 2029 while revenue will remain around 17% of GDP through 2025 &amp; rise to 18.3% by 2029, assuming many recent tax cuts expire.
Under the AFS, trillion-dollar deficits will return by next year and the budget deficit will exceed $2 trillion late in the decade.
Annual budget deficits will also steadily rise under current law, eclipsing $1.1 trillion by 2022 and reaching nearly $1.4 trillion late in the decade.
Under CBO’s Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), debt will reach 105 percent of GDP by 2029, approaching the all-time record set just after World War II.
Here are some more high(low)lights from today's CBO budget outlook.		Debt as a share of the economy will rise rapidly, from today’s post-war record of 78 percent of GDP to nearly 93 percent of GDP by 2029. https://t.co/tAAvCXrJDZ
Our analysis of today's CBO budget and economic outlook is hot off the presses. Read it at https://t.co/tAAvCXrJDZ		Debt held by the public will increase by more than $12.5 trillion under current law over the next decade – from $16.1 trillion today to $28.7 trillion by 2029.
CBO's Alternative Fiscal Scenario, which assumes the extension of various tax and spending provisions currently set to expire, shows the deficit reaching above 7% of GDP by 2029 and national debt close to the all-time record by then https://t.co/ofMiOEBOAa.
They should come up with a plan now while the economy is strong to put our debt on a downward path and phase it in to avoid the much more disruptive choices that procrastination will bring.		See the full statement https://t.co/5E5AWd0BlB
CBO’s annual report is a reminder that the situation is getting worse, not better. Lawmakers need to stop the digging, but even that will keep debt growing.
The debt doesn’t just burden future generations, it also stands in the way of economic and political progress today. With the government now reopened, it is time for the new Congress and the President to work to put the country on more solid fiscal ground.
Numbers don’t lie, and anyone with a calculator on their phone can see that debt is a problem that can’t be ignored.
You need to go no further than this report to see the real state of the union – our national debt is rising rapidly, and trillion-dollar deficits are just on the horizon.
Under CBO’s Alternative Fiscal Scenario, which assumes the continuation of current policies, debt would reach 105 percent of the economy by 2029 and exceed record levels set after World War II by 2030.
Today's CBO outlook shows that national debt is still on an unsustainable path. See our statement https://t.co/5E5AWd0BlB.		CBO projects debt will rise from 78% of the economy today to almost 93% by 2029 and over 152% within 30 years.
"Under CBO's current law projections ... Debt held by the public would grow from 78 percent of GDP in 2018 to 93 percent of GDP ($28.7 trillion) by 2029, the highest total as a share of GDP since 1947." https://t.co/ofMiOEBOAa

The shutdown is harmful and a national embarrassment, but lawmakers should not resolve every disagreement by charging it to the national credit card.

Instead, a reasonable discretionary cap deal would set achievable and affordable levels of spending over the next decade and pay for the cost with revenue and mandatory spending adjustments.		Read the full statement https://t.co/LKqeNObzEC.
Once the government is funded for the current fiscal year, we should talk about funding levels for future years. Under current law, discretionary spending will fall by 10 percent next year; but if we extend recent increases, we could add nearly $2 trillion to the national debt.
Our debt is already on an unsustainable path, and to suggest more borrowing is the solution is to shirk responsibility of actually budgeting. Keeping the lights on and paying federal workers should not be leverage for more spending. https://t.co/LKqeNObzEC
The current government shutdown is an embarrassment, and it needs to end. But incurring billions more in debt is not the way to do it. Why on earth should we be asking our children to pay for our leaders’ inability to do their jobs? https://t.co/LKqeNObzEC

"With the budget deficit headed toward the trillion-dollar mark, we cannot continue to pursue fiscally irresponsible tax and spending proposals."
"Increasing defense spending to $750 billion would double that cost to $100 billion. The deficit would rise even further if, as in past budget deals, new defense spending was coupled with non-defense spending increases."
"Even the President’s initial proposal to allow a 2 to 3 percent decline in defense spending would still leave 2020 spending 10 percent above 2017 spending, which would cost the federal government about $50 billion in 2020 alone."
"Policymakers have increased defense spending by 13 percent in the past two years, with no plan to pay for that increase. It would be irresponsible to consider further debt-financed spending hikes."

We very much hope that this can mark the start of an ongoing effort to improve our budget process and fiscal situation, that the members of the JSC continue their work, and ultimately come up with a comprehensive set of reforms.
It is true that the recommended reforms were too modest to truly fix the broken budget process. Changes are needed to increase accountability and enforceability, put an end to “crisis-driven-budgeting,” encourage compromise, and ultimately improve our fiscal situation.
It is discouraging that the JSC was unable to pass even the smallest of reforms. The possible looming government shutdown is a perfect example of why we need to fix the process.
The failure of the Joint Select Committee to pass even modest reforms is disappointing and emblematic of our broken political system.

"And let’s not forget that tax cuts put on the credit card don’t pay for themselves – not even close."
"At a minimum, tax writers should adhere to the President’s commitment that new tax cuts be revenue neutral. Even then, it would be far better to use new offsets to finance the cost of tax cuts and spending hikes from the past year than for new expensive tax cuts."
"Recent tax cuts and spending increases significantly worsened our fiscal outlook and threaten long-term economic growth; further unpaid-for tax cuts would make a bad situation far worse." https://t.co/zG7pluPHzv
"Interest payments, meanwhile, will approach $1 trillion within a decade, eclipsing what we spend on Medicaid or defense. "

Those elected to Congress this year will face stark and difficult choices to put the debt on a downward path and protect our nation’s social programs from insolvency. It’s no longer a problem for the future.
It’s an unsustainable fiscal course that will lead us to debt overtaking the size of the entire economy in as soon as a decade, and not long after topping all-time highs as a share of the economy not seen since World War II.
As expected, recent tax cuts and spending increases – all put on the national credit card – are making a bad problem even worse.
Under current projections, annual interest payments on the debt could top $1 trillion by 2030.
Interest on the debt rose by $62 billion over the previous year to $325 billion, which amounts to twice as much as we spend on the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security combined.
This year’s deficit amounts to $6,200 per household and is more than we spend each year on Medicare or defense.
Deficits are rising – and fast. In as soon as a year, they will top $1 trillion and never come back down unless Congress acts.
The Treasury Department today reported the official fiscal year 2018 deficit was $779 billion, an increase of $114 billion, or 17 percent, from last year. See our statement https://t.co/Wq326p5y4T

And while they are at it, they should control spending rather than increase it. Instead, policymakers’ choices seem to grow more irresponsible every day.		See the full statement at https://t.co/VeA2VLzyNz
Congress should scrap this plan and pursue real tax reform that broadens the base to finance lower rates, closes loopholes, simplifies the code, and creates lasting economic growth while reducing or at least not worsening the national debt.
The tax cut bill was a sad, missed opportunity.
Our society is aging, and our largest trust funds and social programs are running out of money. It’s a fiscal hole in the trillions that isn’t going to be fixed with more unpaid-for tax cuts.
With trillion-dollar deficits coming as soon as next year according to the White House’s own projections, it is beyond irresponsible to put even more tax cuts on the national credit card to fuel an economic sugar high that won’t last.
Tax reform 2.0 should be about correcting the first round, not locking in its mistakes. 		Debt-financed tax cuts do not pay for themselves, and they certainly won’t stimulate the economy into surpluses.
The $657 billion score of the plan understates its true costs, since it is mostly over the final three years. We estimate the legislation will cost $4 trillion over the next 20 years, or $5 trillion with interest.
This is a plan built on quicksand – sinking in the very debt that finances it. Not only will it add hundreds of billions to the deficit, but it may actually slow long-term growth, especially if recent spending increases are also made permanent.

Over the long term, #GDP growth is expected to slow considerably. High and rising debt is likely to stunt long-term economic growth by reducing productive investment https://t.co/jbgZM8fcnM https://t.co/TIzJ6mOf3T
#GDP growth is expected to be closer to 3% for the rest of the year https://t.co/jbgZM8fcnM https://t.co/93ciiUImBE
At the same time, many analysts believe the second-quarter #gdp growth numbers are artificially inflated by shifts in consumption to avoid the new tariffs announced this quarter. https://t.co/22RgxfyaD6
Most of this growth comes from the one-time surge in consumption that accompanies deficit-financed legislation. We recently estimated that other deficit-financed bills would generate a further 0.2 percent of growth.
CBO recently estimated that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would boost the 2018 economy by about 0.3 percentage points, and the 13 percent discretionary spending increase from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and FY 2018 omnibus spending bill would have a similar effect.
The boost in #gdp growth is being further assisted from the temporary stimulative effects of recent tax cuts and spending increases, as well as timing shifts of certain economic activities https://t.co/jbgZM8fcnM
As we explained at https://t.co/YYfYyjGX9A, higher growth was expected this year as part of the ongoing recovery from the Great Recession
Our take: The q2 #gdp growth rate of 4.1% "is largely the effect of a one-time sugar high and is not representative of likely growth over the course of the next year, let alone the next decade." https://t.co/jbgZM8fcnM

The 115th Congress risks going down in the history books as an utter fiscal failure. The least Congress could do is vote on a plan that attempts to make the situation a little bit better.
Instead of budgeting, Congress spent the past year gorging on debt with unpaid-for tax cuts and spending increases – without regard to generations of Americans who will be saddled by its historic weight with a lower quality of life.
A budget is the opportunity for our leaders to lay down their priorities – and if they can’t make the numbers add up, it is a sign they need to reassess those priorities and deal with the trade-offs that real budgeting requires.
A budget doesn’t need to solve all our problems overnight, but at a time of surging, unsustainable and record red ink, there is absolutely no excuse to take a pass on passing a budget at all.
The House should take a vote on the budget resolution passed out of Committee or else an amended budget. The Senate should come forth with its budget as soon as possible.
This nation has a dependence on debt that can’t be sustained and is a great threat to our children, and our leaders are doing nothing.
In this week’s Long-Term Budget Outlook, the Congressional Budget Office found the debt is on course to nearly double today's level over the next thirty years. Meanwhile, Congress couldn’t even pass a tiny rescission bill cutting 0.002 percent of spending over the next decade.
If Congress heads home for the fourth of July without a budget – three months after the deadline – they will have abdicated one of their most basic of responsibilities.
Congress Should Vote on the Budget 		The following is a statement from Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget https://t.co/end63iuHjo.

"the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget... found that if the individual cuts were kept in place, federal debt would be twice the size of the nation’s economy, and annual deficits would exceed 13% of the GDP over the next 30 years" https://t.co/c6BjhBNSNa
On the other hand, waiting a decade to begin stabilizing the debt would mean raising revenue by 17 percent or cutting non-interest spending by 15 percent https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
Policymakers would have to raise revenue 11 percent or cut non-interest spending 10 percent to simply stabilize the debt at today's high level if they start today https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
The CBO outlook also shows that waiting to fix the debt will make it harder to do https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
If recent tax cuts and spending increases are extended, income could be as much 6 percent or $6,000 lower by our estimate https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
In fact, CBO’s projections of GNP per capita show that in three decades, currently projected rising debt will reduce average income by about 3 percent – roughly $3,000 per person https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
CBO warns that rising debt will likely slow economic growth and reduce future incomes by crowding out investment. https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
In the alternative scenario where tax cuts and spending increases are continued, interest would be the largest spending program by 2042, much earlier than CBO's current law projection https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
In our alternative scenario where tax cuts and spending increases are extended, spending on Social Security, health care, and interest will exceed all revenue by 2033 – eight years earlier than what CBO projects under current law https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
By 2050, interest will be the single largest federal spending program, eclipsing Social Security, Medicare, and all discretionary spending https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
By 2041, spending on Social Security, health care, and interest will exceed all revenue. Essentially, the rest of government spending will be done with borrowed money https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
If recent tax cuts and spending increases are extended instead of expiring under current law, we estimate national debt will exceed the size of the economy by 2027, hit a new record by 2029, and double the size of the economy by 2048 https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
As a result, annual deficits are projected to grow from 3.9% of GDP in 2018 to 9.5% by 2048, approaching the post-World War II record set in 2009 https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
From our new analysis of today's CBO long-term outlook: Federal government spending is projected to grow rapidly, from less than 21% of GDP in 2018 to over 29% by 2048. Revenue will grow much more slowly, from less than 17% of GDP in 2018 to nearly 20% https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9
Under current law, CBO projects national debt will exceed 150% of GDP by 2048. If tax cuts and spending increases are extended instead of allowed to expire, debt will reach roughly 200% of GDP according to our calculations https://t.co/NQA77AEZn9 https://t.co/UVbQ6CjNL9

Without the rosy economic assumptions in the House FY 2019 budget, debt would rise slightly in the near term then fall to about 75 percent of GDP ($22.2 trillion) by 2028, from this year's level of 78%. https://t.co/NPSikyZA5c https://t.co/Qrhy50KNAB
The most actionable part of the budget resolution are the reconciliation instructions to achieve at least $302 billion of savings over ten years.
The budget assumes no changes in revenue despite calls to extend the recent tax bill and change the tax code (directly and indirectly) as a result of Affordable Care Act "repeal and replace" legislation.
The budget also calls for $1.1 trillion of savings from discretionary spending, the net effect of $735 billion of defense increases, $340B of non-defense cuts, $160B of highway spending cuts, and $1.35 trillion of savings from assuming a drawdown of war and emergency spending.
$950 billion of the mandatory cuts in the budget are “undistributed,” and many of these are unspecified or unrealistic (for example, the budget calls for cutting improper payments by 50 percent).
The budget also includes $2.6 trillion of non-health mandatory savings over ten years. About $900 billion of these cuts come from income security, through stricter work requirements and reforms to SNAP and other programs.
$1.5 trillion of savings comes from reductions to Medicaid and other health spending, which appear to come largely from Obamacare repeal but do not appear to reflect the full cost of any "replace" legislation. The budget also calls for $537 billion of savings from Medicare.
The House FY 2019 budget resolution aims to balance by 2027, but only gets there with rosy economic assumptions. See our new analysis https://t.co/NPSikyZA5c https://t.co/cCqLblEA4A
Read our full statement on the FY 2019 budget resolution at https://t.co/XIjY3lWqFl
Today’s proposed budget should be the beginning of this fiscal process, not the end.
Certainly, passing $302 billion of deficit reduction would represent a step in the right direction, but much more must be done. It is long past time to stop the games &amp; propose real, meaningful solutions that set today’s priorities without leaving future generations with the bill
... given that tax cuts and spending hikes over this past year are responsible for $450 billion of next year’s nearly trillion-dollar deficit, and will add at least $2.4 trillion to the debt over a decade.
While we certainly support the effort to achieve substantial deficit reduction, Congress’s credibility is compromised ...
The budget also fails to account for the costs of extending the recent tax cuts or replacing the Affordable Care Act, despite continued efforts to enact these policies.
While the budget resolution calls for $8.1 trillion of deficit reduction relative to CBO’s baseline, most of these savings come from rosy economic assumptions or unreconciled and often unrealistic spending cuts.
With trillion-dollar deficits about to return and debt on course to exceed the size of the economy in a decade or so, lawmakers must pursue trillions of dollars of deficit reduction to bring the debt under control.
These reconciliation instructions are modest enough that they should be achievable with policies that both parties support, though unfortunately they are not nearly enough to solve our unsustainable fiscal situation.
Reconciliation is one of the most powerful tools in the budget process, and we are very supportive of including these savings in the budget.
We are also glad that the proposed budget sets a fiscal goal that would put the debt on a downward path relative to the economy and includes reconciliation instructions to reduce projected deficits by at least $302 billion over the next decade.

For the first time since 1982, Social Security will spend more than it raises in revenue &amp; collects in interest. Its trust fund will be exhausted by 2034, resulting in benefit cuts. See more from our new analysis of today's Social Security trustees report https://t.co/w0BsO3E5TW
The Medicare Trustees' report estimates that the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund will be exhausted in 2026, three years earlier than projected last year.
Theoretical combined Social Security trust funds will run out in 2034.
The Trustees also project that Social Security faces its first deficit (inclusive of interest) since the 1983 reforms – starting this year and continuing indefinitely through the projection period.
According to the Trustees, Social Security faces a 75-year shortfall of 2.84 percent of payroll (over 1 percent of GDP), which will grow to 4.32 percent of payroll by the 75th year.
Here's our quick take on the new Trustees reports on Social Security and Medicare. Check back for more analysis later today and in coming days https://t.co/68QyTcdDLU.

Messaging and talking points that don’t add up won’t right our dire fiscal situation. 		We desperately need a real budget plan that puts the national debt on a sustainable path and strengthens our economy for future generations. 		That starts with a budget. (7/7)
At the same time, the Joint Select Committee on Budget &amp; Appropriations Process Reform should propose reforms going forward to ensure budgets have meaning and are regularly passed by Congress. (6/7)
We strongly encourage Congress to propose, consider, and pass a budget resolution. 		That budget should set an achievable fiscal goal to put debt on a sustainable path and facilitate achievement of that goal through reconciliation instructions and other changes. (5/7)
Annual interest payments in just over a decade will hit the trillion-dollar mark.		Without a plan to bring revenue and spending in line, debt will reach new records shortly after that. (4/7)
The nation’s budgetary challenges are large and the choices are difficult, but ignoring the problem doesn’t make them any easier. 		On the contrary, every day that passes, they become more difficult. (3/7)
With trillion-dollar deficits around the corner, now is not the time for Congress to make history. To budget is to govern, and it is as important as ever that Congress not fully abdicate its fiscal duty. (2/7)
Congress has never before failed to at least consider a budget. Yes, budget deadlines have been missed and budget resolutions have failed to pass, but since the modern budget process was established, a budget has always been approved by at least one of the Budget Committees.(1/7)

RIGHT NOW: @MayaMacGuineas joins @TeamCavuto on @FoxBusiness to talk about rising budget deficits.
We are running up the national credit card when everything is going our way economically.		It shows Congress has lost any will to make hard choices to fix near-record debt levels we’re already facing. https://t.co/itvbP4QJ6J
We need a budget with a long-term fiscal plan that can be implemented and addresses our unsustainable debt head-on, not more meaningless messaging, delay, and denial. (7/7)
With debt poised to overtake the size of the entire economy in just over a decade, it is astonishing that Congress would skip on a budget this year – especially after spending the past year passing budget-busting tax cut and spending bills. (6/7)
Last year’s budget actually called for almost $1.5 trillion more in deficits, and this year, it is looking likely that Congress won’t even pass a budget. (5/7)
The FY 2017 budget resolution demanded only a paltry $2 billion of deficit reduction over an entire decade; that’s just $200 million per year when we are facing looming trillion-dollar deficits. (4/7)
Sadly, Congress has considered many symbolic budgets that balance on paper, but lawmakers have shown little interest in fiscal discipline when it mattered. (3/7)
But fiscal rules must be realistic, and they don’t replace the need for hard choices.		Anyone supporting a balanced budget amendment should also have a plan to achieve a balanced budget and support efforts to implement such a plan; otherwise, it is not a serious proposal. (2/7)
It is long past time for the United States to put in place stronger fiscal rules. To the extent that calls for a balanced budget amendment are a first step toward fiscal discipline, we welcome that conversation. (1/7)

Under our alternative scenario, interest costs will exceed $1 trillion (3.6 percent of GDP), and the country will spend more on interest than defense or Medicaid. https://t.co/wFaBSeN9vV
Interest costs will be the fastest growing part of the budget. Under current law, we project interest will grow from $263 billion (1.4% of GDP) in 2017 to $965 billion (3.3% of GDP) by 2028, at which point it would be 14 percent of the budget.  https://t.co/N3s8GdTC4g
We estimate debt would grow by an additional $3.6 trillion if various expiring policies were extended. Under that alternative scenario, debt would reach $33 trillion and 113 percent of GDP by 2028. https://t.co/iCUnozISTR

Occasionally, CHIMPs lead to actual cuts in mandatory spending.		But in practice, most of them in recent bills are phantom spending cuts to pay for real spending increases. https://t.co/fQSBgmZS6s
Deficits make sense at certain times in the business cycle, or if you are making a one-off public investment.		That’s not why we are borrowing now. We are borrowing for political expediency. https://t.co/v7Lc4H2He4
