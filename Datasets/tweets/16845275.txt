@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall I have never said anything to her that rubs it in. She has suffered enough. But she will do anything to stop people from getting pitbulls, including adopting them and having them euthanized. She is not going to let other children be eaten alive if she can help it. She is smart

@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall She beats herself up enough as she looks at what happened to her baby by ignoring the warning signs and all the people who told her how dangerous pitbulls are.Her unwillingness to see the reality of the danger that is so easy to find, has made her the loudest anti-pit voice ever.
@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall If family members were in danger, I would call the department of child and adult services or the police and report the situation. If someone had done that for my friend, her child would still have a face. My friend cannot forgive herself. She knew better. She will never recover
@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Some cities, countries, counties, all military bases and most apartment complexes have laws or rules re: pitbulls that would get you a huge fine and force you out of your residence if pitbulls are reported to the authorities. So, yes, do report them before they kill your baby

@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Everyone knows how dangerous they are, so why else would they get the breed over hundreds of other breeds who don't eat babies for lunch? If they do it because they are stupid, then they are not smart enough to be allowed to parent without supervision.
@Linda61874379 People who allow pitbulls in their families are the most dangerous and stupid people who ever lived. There is a reason that they kill and maim more people than all other breeds combined. Only an idiot would keep one as a pet. Total sadistic idiots.
@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Sorry, but I am too smart, too educated and love my family way too much to inflict a pitbull on their happy lives. Anyone with a pitbull does not love their family, that is obvious. They are hoping for a tragedy to happen and they have one less kid or the kid has one less face.
@Linda61874379 No, people who allow pitbulls in their homes to kill and maim their family are mean, and they are unfit parents. They should have their children removed because the parents obviously do not love them or try to keep them from danger.
@Linda61874379 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Pitbulls kill and maim MORE PEOPLE AND PETS THAN ALL OTHER BREEDS PUT TOGETHER. What part of that do you not understand? They rip your child's face off in a few seconds. You must hate your family if you allow pitbulls around them. Get a rattle snake for a pet. Makes as much sense

Get someone to teach you how to do research.
@IreneGuesta @chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall It is the breed, not the breeders. PItbulls, no matter how they are raised, kill and maim more people and pets than all other breeds combined.That is a fact that cannot be argued. They have jaws that can kill in an instant and do grotesque damage to innocent people.They are unfit
@Kayboom99 @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall That is total bull.  Ask anyone whose kid is dead or mom is dead or whose face has been ripped off by their pitbull who was so sweet.........until she wasn't. Exposing humans and pets to pitbulls is just a very stupid and careless thing to do. It needs to stop.
@ParrishCarolyn @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall HiDEOUS dog. Why would anyone get such an ugly and dangerous dog when there are hundreds of better breeds. Good grief. What poor taste, what lack of brains, what lack of concern for friends and family. Pits should be banned forever, eliminated for good.
@IreneGuesta @chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Pitbulls are the most dangerous breed, responsible for more deaths and injuries than all other breeds combined. Time to face the facts. Take a look at the injuries inflicted by pitbulls. If you still allow them near children or the elderly, you are sick, sick, sick and perverted.

Only the dumb have pitbulls,the most dangerous dog
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Stop living in denial. Learn to do REAL research which will make it clear that pitbulls have jaws made to kill, and they DO kill, more than any other breed.There is something wrong with people who choose those dogs from hundreds of breeds.Really, it is sick, sick, sick. Seek help
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall The figures are not skewed. There are hundreds of studies about pitbulls and they all come up the same (except for the fake studies by some bs pitbull breeders that are known to be nonsense).You are like a drug addict,unwilling to face the facts of the danger of pitbulls. Stupid.
@chortletown @IreneGuesta @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall I have hundreds of links, but they are all to complicated for the average pitbull owner to understand (pitbull owners are on the bottom of the IQ scale. If they were smart, they would never get a dog like that to begin with). No matter where you look, the facts are bad for pits!
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Not delusional. I have taken more statistics courses while getting my degrees than you can count.I've been studying pitbulls and the damage they do for decades.They are like human serial kil.lers in dog form. People who choose that breed of dog have serious problems to begin with
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Recommending that people not be exposed to a dangerous breed of dog that kills more people and pets than all other breeds combined is not stupid. It is wise.I do research and I have the facts. Been studying pitbulls for years and the disturbed people who get them. Serious sickos.
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Reading actual facts is challenging to people who live in a fantasy world where pitbulls are acceptable pets. Pits are no allowed in cities, countries and residences because they kill and maim more people and pets than any other breed. They earned their ugly killer reputation.
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall The experts know more than you do and that is how they are codified. There is no way that you can count the deaths and injuries from pitbulls and minimize or normalize them no matter how many lies you tell. There are hundreds of dog breeds. Get a decent breed as a pet. NO pitbull
@ParrishCarolyn @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall Posting junk from non-legitimate sources is just wasting time and spreading lies. You need a reality check. Learn how to do real research. It is indisputable that pitbulls kill and maim more than all other breeds combined. Period.
@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall You are wrong. All breeds have bad owners/good owners. Pitbulls kill and maim more people and pets than all other dogs combined. Parents who allow pitbulls around their children really want to get rid of the kids so they don't have to pay child support or some other sick reason.

@chortletown @Stacey5899 @MjaneMarshall With pitbull attacks, it is often the lucky victims who die. Others are left with horrible injuries that keep them from ever experiencing a full life.
