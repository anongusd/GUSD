@mbkratter @NYGovCuomo “If we want to give people the opportunity to successfully live in our communities, we want to give them the opportunity to vote and be stakeholders,” @Myrna_Perez director of the Voting Rights and Elections Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
@mbkratter 18 states +Washington, D.C., allow parolees to vote. @NYGovCuomo restored voting rights to people on parole by exec order, codifying it into law makes it so another gov would not take that away.
@mbkratter @CoreyinNYC #AutomaticVoterRegistration streamlines voter registration saving paper + tax payer 💰	     You probably saw what happened in Georgia’s midterms, many people’s registrations held back to help one candidate. AVR makes sure everyone has an equal opportunity to their right to vote.
@mbkratter @CoreyinNYC So glad you have never had a problem. 	     Reasons like having more than one job, work schedules, child care, elder care, if you need help getting to your polling place (my grandma voted at age 105, but she did not drive) these are all reasons #EarlyVoting is helpful.
