"We‚Äôve got to help these young servicemen &amp; women understand what real economic oppty, what the American dream looks like.

"We want to hire you because we know that you have the soft skills and ability to learn to succeed in our companies." -@Prudential's Chuck Sevola #LeftofTransition
Service members: "Corporations understand that when you transition you might want to do something different than what you‚Äôve spent many years doing in the military." -@Prudential's Chuck Sevola #LeftofTransition
At times, your leadership and core values are more important than what your previous experience is in.  @OshkoshDefense's, Kerry Rocole #LeftofTransition
"Your personal brand goes beyond just your resume. Make sure you are putting your best foot forward not just in person, but also on #socialmedia." @FirstCommand's Bill Edmundson #LeftofTransition
Another great #SocialMedia #ProTip for job seekers: "Your social media is a great storytelling tool. Leverage your social media to talk about issues that may apply to the job you want." @CarMax's Jack McCarthy #LeftofTranstion
"Job Seekers: Think very broadly about the companies you are looking at. Subject matter expertise can go a long way. It‚Äôs not just about what you know, but what you can teach others." -@CarMax's Jack McCarthy #LeftofTranstion
Roxann Griffith of @VETS_DOL recommends transitioning service members to look into the @USDOL Apprenticeships Program. Learn more here: https://t.co/29rCDS5EfH #LeftofTransition
#PersonalBranding tip from @HiltonNewsroom's Abie Chong: "Brand yourself not for the job you did, but the job you are pursuing." #LeftofTransition
Resume #ProTip: Tailor your resume for the job you are applying for. Consider making sure you are highlighting some of the same terminology that is used in the job posting.  Andrea Hanley of @TroopsTransport #LeftofTransition
Transitioning service members: Take this time before your separation date to start preparing for your new civilian career by reviewing your resume, taking certification courses, and building your network. -Chuck Sevola of @Prudential #LeftofTransition
