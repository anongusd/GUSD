Republicans have always been about solutions, and have truly fought against coloring ourselves, trying not to put people in groups of difference, we think everyone is equal and solving problems is not racism or hate.	VOTE RED our country needs us ! https://t.co/BLtAsLMOJO

The United States has been Hijacked w/ Judge Anna Von Reitz https://t.co/MiBTVlSPby via @YouTube
https://t.co/n12YbKuquy	Judge Anna von Reitz from Big Lake Alaska.
9	I just read this and thought it interesting , I do not know if this Judge is correct , but if she is C Schumer and democrats are the corrupt people we believe them to be.
8	And now you all know why Democrat Chuck Schummer appeared to shut down the government for three days "for no reason".
7	... and is not interrupted by any more chicanery for a year and a day.	Thereafter, his work will stand and his term will run and there won't be anything that anyone can say or do against it.
6	To counteract this, he has to re-take his Oath of Office, re-do the things he wants to stick--- re-sign legislation, re-issue Executive Orders, etc.---and begin the whole timeline over again, being sure that his Office cures and ..
5	...and are scheming to invalidate everything he has done and everything he will do this next year and after---- just by sitting back and not telling him that his Office never cured.
4	Now, either he did this to himself because he wanted to void out mistakes made during the first year of His Presidency, or, far more likely, the Dems saw their opportunity to "win" by technicality and ...
3	As a result, nothing that President Trump did during his entire first year in Office, all the laws and Executive Orders and Directives he signed---- technically didn't cure.
2	His Office, his Trust, would have become law on January 21st of this year--- but that didn't happen, because Chuck Schummer contrived to shut down the government for three days at precisely the critical time.	This is called "breaking the continuity of the evidence".
By Anna Von Reitz	1	Everyone--- pay attention.	Last year on January 20, 2017, President Trump took his Oath of Office. An Office in the Territorial Government is a Public Trust.	Trusts do not become law for a year and a day.
@Comey We trusted our gov for too many years ...Thanks to TRUMP who I never wanted to vote for but did because Hillary was worse...	Now our prays have been answered, who knew GOD would use a flawed man to save America? Keep praying!

@ChuckGrassley @BOURRELL As of Friday morning, Ford‚Äôs Wikipedia entry also identified her occupation as ‚ÄúPsychologist.‚Äù According to California law, all of these are false. Ford is not a psychologist. She is a researcher and teacher, she has no license in CA that can be found online
@ConservaMomUSA I am not medical, but have family&amp;friends with mental issues, I read body language easily.	She needs help I hope she gets it. I just wish it could be now because they are using her to destroy a good man. Even as a child I could read people and knew who to avoid. thank you sharing
@TomCottonAR @SassyT_Joy @SenFeinstein I think Ford has real CHILDHOOD/trauma not from her teens. Her body language goes to adult to child. She only cry for compliments. I believe she is sick.I do not believe Kavanaugh did anything to cause her problem.
@BuzzPatterson @m27731630 I thought I was the only one who noticed her body/speech was really odd. He had righteous anger with frustration/hurt and seemed more normal .	I think she had childhood trauma/abuse. I do not believe he harmed anyone.
@GriffinMaga @ConservaMomUSA this is my belief, had a friend who acted childlike then adult in and out , most people just thought she was being silly but years later she told on uncle.
@ConservaMomUSA I noticed her going from childlike sing song voices to adult educated voice to foggy memory to exact memory. could she be bipolar / or schizophrenia they are very high function my brother in law is .
They need her complete medical records.Or Kavanaugh will have to sue her to get them to ever clear his good name. She may be schizophrenia/bipolar her symptoms look like my brother in law. Child like talk then adult talk. https://t.co/56Qow34Wtg
I suspect they do not want her medical records out,	They must know her memory going in and out is from family child hood abuse not Kavanaugh. She was abused but not by him. She goes fro child to adult. watch her again https://t.co/yHhOwygLOG
@MittRomney Get her complete Medical records , I suspect her memory loss and child to adult talk is a symptom of sever childhood abuse. She needs intervention and help before she destroys a good man. A boy being fresh would not cause her mind to break. Confirm Kavanaugh

@TheLastRefuge2 that woman most likely had Abusive dad, or brothers and suffers from trauma from her home life. I had a friend who lost time like that when we went places. Turns out she had mental issues from abuse. I believe him but poor woman is very sick and needs help.
