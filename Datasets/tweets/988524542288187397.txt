@RudyGiuliani Actually, we plan to wait until we flip the House. If we release it before we flip the House, you &amp; your corrupt GOP-Russia allies will stomp it out before people can get the whole story. We'll go dark before the election, though, so time for you to do the same!

People like Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, and many others do get opportunities in private sector, but not due to security clearance. They get it due to expertise in general. Many, in fact (Clapper good example, as is Mueller), instead choose government service at less pay anyway.

@SistahSHE @DrWAVeSportCd1 @peterdaou @VerneLaVurl @jaketapper @JohnBrennan @JeffFlake Absolutely.

@hzackman @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton The FBI, thankfully, has acted against a corrupt political regime seeking to institute Russia-like rule in the U.S. For the record, this same FBI acted in a way that clearly hurt the Clinton campaign, for which tRump supported Comey until he discovered he was under investigation.
@hzackman @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Actually, Inspector General did not conclude as much.

@hzackman @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Then we also reopen the FAKE investigation "conducted" by Nunes and company (heard the tapes?) concurrent w/Mueller wrapping up the probe. Then by fall or winter of 2019 or so, we complete impeachment process and turn it over to the Senate for indictment.
@hzackman @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Let me give you the Dem playbook, which I have been advocating and supporting for a long time. Currently House is controlled by GOP. It needs a simple majority to successfully impeach, but it won't get that until after midterms when we flip the House.

@goingglocal @WintersPilar Whole reason tRump continues to decry FAKE NEWS. Best tRump can do is reinforce the high floor of 30 percent (maybe even 25 percent or less eventually as I have forecast) by convincing them to discount all but his words.

@gevinella @Alyssa_Milano @cadenceofmylife Yep, we take polls seriously. The credibility of polls is easily defied w/Putin's help. Trust me, it is "priceless" for tRump when Russia owns the fake billionaire.
@Alyssa_Milano @cadenceofmylife Moreover, in pretty much every prior midterm, it has been a massive wipeout of the party losing the generic poll in advance by such a margin. Anyone telling you otherwise is trying to spin in desperation of huge GOP loss.  Yes, we need to stay active.  But Blue Wave for real.
@Alyssa_Milano @cadenceofmylife We do need to stay active, but MSM (&amp; especially CBS) leans right in any event. Other polls w/historic precedent, such as the generic congressional ballot polls, show Dems hovering from 8 to 12 point advantage almost every time surveyed. https://t.co/ny9iB1A38S

6/6 GOP, however, will pay a serious political price in 2018 &amp; probably 2020 because other than the 30% floor tRump inhabits w/supporters, most of the rest of the country notices: A) GOP controls all the government &amp; B) it‚Äôs even worse now. Fascism fail, democratic republic win.
5/6 In other words, the recipe has come together, as I had predicted and as others like Albright observe. However, tRump attempts to capitalize on the events unfolding by directing the (mostly) uneducated masses (and usually white males) against government institutions.
4/6 One reason is generally related to work opportunities, so if work opportunities become poor or suspect during periods of rising mistrust of government, it amplifies the mistrust. Additionally, propaganda can affect the how people view government, either for better or worse.
3/6 Potentially the most dangerous factor in aiding in the emergence of fascism is strong mistrust of government, w/trust in government swerving from 70% or so trust circa 1960 to about 20% by 2017. It worsens among the uneducated or poorly educated for a couple of reasons.
2/6 It resonated especially because I have an unfinished manuscript in which I argued along very similar lines specific to U.S. regarding a cycle we experience culturally every half-century or so, w/the due date coming up by about 2020. The main point for me is relevant for 2018.
1/6 While reading Madeleine Albright's book Fascism: A Warning, I found Chapter Nine in particular to resonate w/me because of its coverage of modern day sociopolitical, sociocultural, &amp; socioeconomic factors worldwide, but especially in U.S., fertile for fascism's rise.

@KimBrker @strollo5 @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN Yes I actually believe they feel threatened that "black culture" has claimed something over which "white culture" no longer exerts the same control, a usurpation of power I applaud. :)
@KimBrker @strollo5 @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN I've been around black &amp; white friends (not me though) who exchange it between themselves, and I don't criticize it. If they have an understanding, not my place.  But an all white bunch I will oppose every time.
@KimBrker @strollo5 @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN I teach the history of the word, but at the same time, I have been the "lone white person" in many social groups during my life. These groups were usually low-income w/significant, legitimate gripes against white culture in general, though they didn't direct it at me. So I get it
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN A white person who feels the need to use the word, except in the case of some who might get "passes" due to immersion in the counterculture (vast majority of white people DO NOT get "passes"), are seeking to exert dominance &amp; control over a word that black counterculture claimed.
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN I understand your position, but I also understand the counter-culture pushback. My position is this: as a white person, I feel no need to ever use the word, and while I despise the word, I respect the counter-culture pushback. Moreover...CONT'D
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN For example, in my first response above, I shut my mouth when black passengers used the word in my presence and threw out white passengers who did after they failed to observe my warning. It flips "white power" on its head. It will reveal white supremacists as well, trust me.
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN In a way, I believe it is a form of social justice even if I disagree. If we censor white people who use it pejoratively and stop criticizing black people who use it in an oppositional way, it can be empowering until we eradicate the word entirely, if possible.
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN I despise it too. But let me try to explain my point. I have driven cab a lot in my life.  When I drove, some passengers used the word. If they were white, I threw them out of my cab literally after 1 warning if they used it again. If they were black, I shut my mouth.
@strollo5 @KimBrker @Hopejoe3 @MerlePearl @PastorMaxwell @CNN I'd suggest you teach them about the word "fuck" too since you seem so willing to invoke it readily.  Just a thought. :)

@tribelaw I agree w/you, but I would add that for the evidence to matter, in my opinion, the House would need to vote to impeach successfully (midterm flip). I do not believe U.S. people would be swayed much w/o indictment process, even if Senate failed to indict.  GOP political suicide.

9/9 Bottom line, the GOP, Rand Paul, and the squatter in the WH are betraying the country. TREASON. Senator Flake called Trump's actions treasonous, and I dare say it is becoming a blanket statement.	https://t.co/QS5YjSf7zb
8/9 It seems that the GOP and Rand Paul have decided to run interference for Russia and Trump whenever the heat gets too severe. A true patriotic party and president would NEVER allow this kind of blatant diminution of the United States on the world stage. https://t.co/pG89pMN4UF
7/9 All of this should be even more frightening since before the date (26 July) on the White House (WH) memo about Brennan and others who may have security clearance revoked, a Putin-connected Russian basically described the ‚Äúlist‚Äù being compiled by the WH on 24 July. https://t.co/eyWTA9IQTw
6/9 Now, I have written before that I believe Murdoch &amp; Genie Energy have some kind of deal w/Trump to get Syria ‚Äústabilized‚Äù to facilitate access to Golan Heights oil. Moreover, we now see what appears to be Russian coordination for some kind of Ukraine offensive.
5/9 This is important because it could broadcast further plans since the Mussolini/Hitler relationship eventually slammed into friction over Hitler‚Äôs seizing of Romanian oil that Mussolini wanted. In response, Mussolini attempted to invade Greece (big fail) w/o telling Germany.
4/9 A) Trump is Putin‚Äôs bitch, i.e., ‚ÄúYes, I did. Yes, I did.‚Äù &amp; B) telegraphing moves in advance in coded ways to have a public record to display how he ‚Äúflaunted outmaneuvering adversaries publicly.‚Äù Putin‚Äôs actions strongly reflect a kind of revised Mussolini/Hitler meeting.
3/9 When Mussolini &amp; Hitler first met in June of 1934, Mussolini made Hitler wait for half-an-hour before joining Hitler at a parade, dominated public speaking events w/the two present, &amp; pranked Hitler w/salt in coffee. Now I believe Putin revels in telling the world two things:
2/9 While reading Madeleine Albright‚Äôs book Fascism: A Warning, I could not help but notice just how similar some aspects of the Mussolini/Hitler relationship, and even events between the two fascists, mirrored the Putin/Trump fiasco the world was and is witnessing.
1/9 I have been working on a theory that seems to be supported by more evidence emerging now. Basically, I believe Putin has Trump &amp; the GOP by the gonads and enjoys flaunting it to the world, and Trump and company try to do damage control constantly.

5/5 Had they been successful &amp; the story been spun properly, then Murdoch, Cheney, Trump, Russia, and maybe even Netanyahu would all benefit (not to mention Bashar al Assad in Syria). Scary shit! So Trump and Carlson, probably per Murdoch, had to vent about it in a childish way!
4/5 A former CIA couple who went private sector may be connected to an attempted coup, a coup that may have redirected Montenegro‚Äôs trajectory toward Russia had it succeeded. Note that this couple, surname Assad, is celebrated in Christian circles and even connected to Netanyahu.
3/5 However, to get the public to be accepting of any kind of Assad regime, many people in the U.S. would need a PR campaign to lessen the negativity of what the name Assad invokes in their minds. Enter Russian mini-nemesis Montenegro. Overall, it is of little consequence EXCEPT
2/5 The name Assad really only has 1 major conjuration in the minds of the American public: Bashar al Assad in Syria. Now keep in mind that if Syria ‚Äústabilizes‚Äù under Assad, Golan Heights oil, to which Murdoch, Cheney, &amp; others on Genie Energy have rights, may become accessible.
1/5 Bear w/me because this one is a little ‚Äúout there‚Äù but not nearly as far out as ‚ÄúSpace Force.‚Äù You have to think like narcissistic would-be global dictators. Why would Tucker Carlson &amp; Donald Trump bother chatting about Montenegro? Maybe it is relevant to Murdoch/Trump/Putin.

@MatthewWolfff @dannyoconnor1 Balderson's win is analogous to a team avoiding a safety by running from out of the end zone to the 1 yard line when they needed a surge to break momentum of a team beginning to crush them on the scoreboard.  GOP can spin it any way they want.  It's bad news.  Blue Wave.
@MillenPolitics Nevermind.  Latest report I see is about 2700 provisional ballots and a mistaken report on the absentee ballots.  It won't be an O'Connor win at this point (we'll see them again in November) but it is a win for Democrats.  The House is ours. :)  Now the Senate!
@MillenPolitics Not sure yet.  I see reports that there may be somewhere near 10k absentee or provisional ballots.  Those need to be counted, if so, because O'Connor ran at 60-70% on early voting.  60% or more on 10k votes equals win for O'Connor.
@RonsonMartinez @KamalaHarris Best explanation: entire Republican party consists of the uncles and other relatives we all hate when we go to holiday events.  We dunno why they are like that, but we know it's not the whole damn family.
@MsProudLatina Yep.  It will be between 2018 and 2020 that we begin to see a Trump economy unfolding. :)  It's generally at least near end of next administration before last administration's inertia in economy wears off.

8/8 The likelihood of Trump using Russia for central organization of its campaign strategies goes beyond calling on Russia 26 July 2016; the Alfa Bank-Trump Tower communications appear to coincide with the events described above. Why not investigate this @ChuckGrassley?
7/8 In other words, if Clinton did indeed hire Fusion GPS, as it appears she did, it was a private contract with a private company, much like Cambridge Analytica (CA) EXCEPT it now appears that CA further coordinated with Russia. Trump appears to have made Russia its quarterback.
6/8 On the other hand, Steele would be resource added to Fusion GPS research BUT not resourced primarily as a foreign government interest. For further distinctions, Clinton never publicly requested the assistance of a foreign government or engaged Steele directly--was Fusion GPS.
5/8 It would make sense, then, if an international intelligence asset was in place to pick up on serious Russian chatter or activity, it would be significant at this juncture (June/July 2016) if indeed the Trump campaign had (as they did) engaged Russia for election assistance.
4/8 While Fusion GPS picked up new sponsors, Trump claims he was unaware of Jr. meeting w/Russians in June while Cohen claims Trump knew before meeting.  Giuliani has even bumbled and inadvertently described another meeting that Cohen never even mentioned.  They are panicked.
3/8 Now, it lines up even more likely that @tedcruz or Cruz donors were paying Fusion GPS because they bailed after Republican nomination went to Trump. Why would Dems bail &amp; start new contract AFTER Trump got nomination? Fusion GPS just picked up where it left off w/new contract
2/8 The specific sponsors seem murky, but a lot of evidence points to @tedcruz or donors to Cruz as the original sponsors of Fusion GPS. It is not illegal (perhaps unethical, not illegal) to pay a company to dig up dirt on an opponent, which totally makes sense for dirty Cruz.
1/8 Some people seem to want to equate the Fusion GPS (aka Steele dossier) research on Trump w/Trump-Russia. It sounds like something @ChuckGrassley would jump right on, but it fails terribly. I outline why as follows. To begin, Fusion GPS was originally sponsored by Republicans.

@stealthmaster97 @amjoyshow @ConnieSchultz I liked your reply because I believe you need friends.  I am certain you cannot have real friends in the alternate universe in which you live, so I have extended my hand to you. :)
6/6 As a result, Russia &amp; the GOP fell into bed together w/Donald Trump.  Putin never actually believed Russia could or would elect Trump as a puppet.  Trump was just a blip in the ‚Äúother‚Äù plot.  But once Putin got inside help w/GOP for election attack, Putin zagged &amp; ran w/it.
5/6 Russia had a big play intended, but somehow law enforcemnt &amp; IC, probably w/international assistance, disrupted what was a much more explosive plan (going to assert it had connection to international neo-Nazi movements).  Now the scary part: some if not many GOP know or knew.
4/6 Essentially, Russia had a network of spies &amp; agents in key positions, including the NRA but extending into political influence and possibly even within important government institutions (e.g., see the spy in Moscow accessing Secret Service information). Bigger plans for sure.
3/6 While Trump and many so-called law and order, institution-supporting GOP (what a joke!) attack federal law enforcement &amp; intelligence community (IC), I have become convinced that IC and others helped to defuse a serious socio-political haymaker attempted by Russia in 2016.
2/6 Hayden points to the 2015 Jade Helm misinformation ploy as a Russian campaign before the 2016 election. Moreover, Hayden argues, I believe correctly, that Putin is more a short-term tactician pursuing long game objectives. Putin has long term goals but zigs &amp; zags on way.
1/6 After having read books by Malcolm Nance, James Clapper, Michael Hayden, &amp; others, along with more reading I continue, it is becoming even more apparent that Russia had a plan of a nefarious nature well beyond an election attack. My key points get pulled together as follows.
@amjoyshow @ConnieSchultz Don't forget, Trump's own father was an unashamed racist, and Trump began very early in real estate to discriminate based on race until legal action interceded.  Trump went underground as a racist until Putin's white nationalist brand became realistic for him w/GOP support.

@SunflowerSoul71 I appreciate your optimism but I also believe the Republicans have backed themselves into a "Cult 45" corner.  They are dependent on Trump supporters now because they have alienated almost all other Americans, and that means most will be out of office in time.

@SunflowerSoul71 The "public" revelations from 2018 to 2020, with Mueller findings coming public further, would absolutely crucify the Republicans and Trump without actual impeachment. Blue Tsunami in 2020. And even if by some miracle Trump remained in office, would be able to impeach and indict.
@SunflowerSoul71 A failure to indict would give a second wind to Trump and Republicans heading into 2020.  A better strategy would be to stall impeachment in House w/new Trump-Russia investigation because of slanted prior House investigation, strengthened w/Manafort, Butina, and other findings.
@SunflowerSoul71 Even if House impeaches, the Senate, even if it flips, will not get enough Democrats for a 2/3 majority indictment. Republicans would need to step across partisan allegiance for the rule of law, but they won't. They are spineless, Russian-NRA pawns willing to be oligarch puppets.
@SunflowerSoul71 The House could push impeachment after flipping to appease a significant portion of base, but an even better approach would be to get investigations underway across all linkages while Mueller wraps up marching toward 2020.  It would be catastrophic for GOP as I explain further.
@SunflowerSoul71 After midterms, Congress will rail against Trump attempt at self-pardon after House flips, and maybe even Senate.  It would be further GOP suicide for all but base.  I have a different "long ball" idea in mind as follows.
Even bigger point, IMO, Oliver North new NRA president in wake of Butina raid.  I.E., NRA needed massive image overhaul, Reagan-Russia symbol invocation chosen!  Did alleged Russian spy Maria Butina cause a leadership shake-up at the NRA? https://t.co/sHq7VF2N7T via @MotherJones
@SunflowerSoul71 Well, I'm still holding on to my belief Mueller knows strategy. I think timing of Manafort &amp; Butina (Cohen sideshow) help get the proper connections in place for House to investigate Pence (Manafort-&gt;Pence) &amp; GOP leadership (NRA &amp; Russia). Midterms. Flip House. Investigations.
